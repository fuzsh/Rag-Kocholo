        "text": "When Queen Elizabeth I appointed Sir Edward Osborne (grandfather of Sarah Offley Thorowgood) the first Governor of the newly formed Turkey Company in 1581, Her Majesty declared:\n\nWhere our welbeloved Subjects Edward Osborne, Alderman of our Citie of London, and Richard Staper of our said City Merchant, have by great adventure and industry, with their great costs and charges…traveled, and caused travel to be taken, as well by secret and good means, as by dangerous ways and passages both by land and sea to find out and set open a trade …into the land of the Great Turke …[and as] the said Edward Osborne hath been the principal setter forth and doer in the opening & putting in ure [Old English: take effect] of the said trade…the said Edward Osborne shall be governor of all…. [1]\n\nFrom Apprentice to Merchant\n\nHow had Edward Osborne changed from a promising Clothworker’s apprentice into a major economic force? He truly was the right man in the right place at the right time. At about age 14 or 15, Edward was apprenticed by his father, Richard Osborne of minor gentry in Ashford, Kent, to William Hewett, a master of the Clothworkers’ Company. No one could foresee their destinies. Whether or not Edward Osborne leapt from London Bridge to rescue Anne Hewett, his master’s child, he clearly was a risk taker and made the best of an opportunity. While William Hewett was achieving his own success and notoriety, Edward was learning the trade as well as making important connections. In 1553, the year that Hewett was elected Sheriff, Edward became a freeman at the Clothworkers’ Company. In 1559, when Hewett was elected Lord Mayor of London, Osborne took on his first apprentices and started trading unfinished cloth in Antwerp. Whatever incident or reasons made Sir William Hewett decide to give his only living descendent in marriage to his former apprentice around 1562, he had chosen wisely. [2] See post: The Fall of Anne Hewett\n\nWool broadcloth production had fueled England’s economy for much of the medieval period and was the primary export to Northern Europe in the 16th century, despite a mid-century decline. However, around the time of Sir William’s death in 1567, Edward decided to leave the Clothworkers’ Company for new ventures, and for the next 10 years, he exported dyed and dressed English cloth to Spain and Portugal in exchange for oil, raisins, wine, and spices. Osborne started a lifetime partnership with Richard Staper, who had married Dionis Hewett, William Hewett’s niece, and they were named assistants in the new Company of Spain and Portugal. During that time, Osborne also became more influential in political affairs, becoming an Alderman of the City of London in 1573 and its Sheriff in 1575-76. [3]\n\nOpening Eastern Trade Routes\n\nOsborne and Staper set their sights on an ever-expanding horizon. In 1575, they arranged to import goods from Bombay and started to explore possibilities of opening more trade to the East, either along the long land route through Poland and Russia or a sea route through the pirate-infested Mediterranean. They first focused on the northern land route and became prominent in the Eastland Company and then the Muscovy Company in the search for the elusive northeast passage to China and the Pacific Ocean. Osborne was also approached about opening trade in Brazil in 1578, and he did give some financial support to Sir Francis Drake in his West Indies exploits. Everyone seemed to want Osborne and Staper on the team. However, their interests lay in the East, not the West. [4]\n\nWhile Anthony Jenkinson secured permission to trade in Turkey from Suleyman the Magnificent in 1553, that did not open up regular trade with England. At their own expense, Osborne and Staper secretly sent agents through Poland to Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1575 to initiate negotiations and, by 1578, the reigning sultan Murad III granted Osborne’s factor, William Harborne, safe passage to Constantinople and free access to the Turkish domains. Harborne was a skilled negotiator and, despite attempts by the French to undermine English access, he obtained permission for English merchants to trade with Turkey as well as guarantees that they could come and go by land and sea without molestation. That, however, did not stop trouble from the Barbary pirates or other privateers/pirates (including some English) in the Mediterranean Sea. [5]\n\nThe England-Turkey Connection\n\nQueen Elizabeth received envoys from Istanbul, and she and Sultan Murad III corresponded in Latin to arrange the final details. Harborne was appointed the English ambassador, and in 1581 Queen Elizabeth sanctioned the formation of the Turkey Company as noted above which granted 12 merchants under the leadership of Osborne a monopoly on the trade with Turkey for 7 years. Of the 12 merchants, 10 had been involved with the Spanish Company and 9 with the Muscovy Company. These were prestigious and experienced merchants.[6]\n\nThe Ottoman Empire reached its peak during the reign of the prior sultan Suleyman, the Magnificent, from 1520-1566. Murad III had only been the ruler since 1574 when he was approached by Osborne’s emissaries. Despite a history of conflict between Muslims, Christians, and Jews, the Ottomans allowed some toleration of religion in this period as long as taxes were paid and laws followed. The Queen and Sultan expressed mutual respect. Murad addressed Elizabeth in one of his letters as “the pride of women who follow Jesus, the most excellent of the ladies honoured among the Messiah’s people, the arbitress of the affairs of the Christian community….” Murad even suggested that there could be an alliance between them as Spain was a mutual enemy and he thought Protestantism had more in common with Islam than with the idolatrous Roman Catholicism. With the 1585 outbreak of hostilities between England and Spain, they considered a collaborative Muslim-Protestant campaign against Spain, but the Ottomans were instead pulled into conflict with Persia.[7]\n\nTurkish Delights\n\nOpening trade with the Turks made a dramatic shift in how English merchants did business. While the still ongoing Company of Merchant Adventurers made their money through cloth exports, the Turkey Company was primarily focused on the money to be made in imports. These Turkey merchants, as they were called, imported the much desired raw silk, mohair, cotton, carpets, tapestries, medicines, spices, Corinth currants, white soap, and indigo dye in exchange for highly prized English tin, kerseys, cloth, and tanned cony (rabbit) skins. There was widespread English support for this endeavor, and even the Queen invested in this joint stock venture. In its first 5 years, the Turkey Company made 27 voyages using 19 ships and paid over £ 11,359 in customs. They reported a 300% profit through the selling and re-exporting of the goods, despite some loses through piracy. However, the Company had to provide the money to maintain the ambassador in Constantinople and make payments to the Turks.[8]\n\nDespite the controlled monopoly, competition developed with the Venice Company of English merchants which had been set up in 1583 to circumvent Venetian trade tariffs, particularly on currants. There was much overlap in the cargoes of the two companies. When it came time for their charters to be renewed in 1588-89, both appealed to the Crown. The Turkey Company prevailed with an agreement to create the new Levant Company which would incorporate both. Some merchants, however, were jealous of the success of the few and argued against the monopoly and/or engaged in illicit trade. The new charter was issued January 7, 1592, authorizing an expanded 53 merchants to hold a monopoly of trade with the Middle East over 12 years with Sir Edward Osborne again as their first governor. However, Osborne was in ill-health by the time the charter was finalized, and he died a month later on February 4, 1592. He was succeeded by his partner Richard Staper.[9]\n\nOn to India\n\nOsborne and Staper were not content, however, with just the Turkish trade. As they were establishing the Turkey Company, they also funded an expedition of John Newberry to Persia in 1580-82 and the later famous expedition of Newberry, Ralph Finch, William Leedes, and John Eldred through Persia on to India in 1583. The group went to Aleppo, then Baghdad, and into the Persian Gulf where they were captured and imprisoned by the Portuguese. They escaped in 1584, and Newberry, Leedes and Finch made it to north central India where Leedes stayed as the court jeweler (his prior occupation). Eldred returned from Syria in 1588 with, according to Hakluyt, “the richest ship of English merchant’s goods that ever was known to come into this realm.”\n\nNewberry died trying to return to England, while Fitch continued further into India, to the base of the Himalayas, and through Burma (Myanmar). He served as the Levant Company’s Consul in Aleppo and Tripoli. When Fitch finally returned to England eight years later in 1591, he had been presumed dead and his will had been proved. However, he was very much alive and became a crucial advisor when the East India Company was formed from the Levant Company in 1600.[10]\n\nThe Currency of Currants\n\nThe English appetite for the sweet black Corinth currants (yes, those tiny dried grapes) and peppercorns helped transform the English economy. The amount of currants imported by the Levant Company skyrocketed, and they were reported to have imported as many as 2,300 tons a year. These Zante currants, as they are known today, provided a sweetness to foods in an era when Europe was discovering its sweet tooth through New World sugar cane production. Venetian merchants had tried to control the currant trade from the Greek Isles, but it continued to be the most lucrative staple of the Levant Company for many years. The English still love currants in their hot cross buns and Christmas fruit cakes. The supply of raw silk and cotton imported through the Levant Company was also important and gradually led to the establishment of the silk and cotton weaving industries in England.[11]\n\nBecoming Sir Edward Osborne\n\nEdward Osborne’s success as a merchant led to other honors. In 1583 he was elected by the city’s aldermen to be the Lord Mayor of London, and he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I on February 2, 1584. It was in his year as mayor that the Throckmorton plot was discovered in which some English Catholics planned to rise up against Elizabeth, supported by a French and Spanish invasion, to place Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne. In 1586, Sir Edward was elected as a Member of Parliament and was among the group who supported the execution of Mary Queen of Scots after the Babington Plot of that year was discovered. Edward Osborne was a brilliant and tough business man who used available loopholes, but was also known to be fair and was sometimes asked by the Privy Council to arbitrate merchant disputes.[12]\n\nThis portrait commonly associated with Sir Edward Osborne was included in a later printing of Richard Hakluyt’s “The Principal Navigations” and was found at Hornby Castle, the home of the Dukes of Leeds. Many have questioned its connection, as Sir Edward never served in the military and would have been more likely painted in wealthy merchant attire or the robes of office. The Company of Clothworkers has recently identified this portrait as John, 1st Lord Mordaunt of Turvey, not Edward Osborne.[13]\n\nFamily Issues\n\nAnne Hewett stood by her husband’s side through his times as merchant and mayor, but sadly died in 1585, leaving five surviving children– Alice (married Sir John Peyton, 1st Baronet in 1580), Hewett (married Joyce Fleetwood in 1588), Anne (married Robert Offley on February 3, 1588), Edward (married Alice Boteler/ Butler, then Frances Harvey), and Jane (married John Wellbye). Sir Edward himself remarried in 1588 ( making 3 family weddings that year) to Margaret Pratt Middleton Chapman, but they had no children. He prepared a will, but there is no evidence it was probated, so it is reported he died intestate. The will stated that his widow would receive her third, a third would go to his eldest son Hewett, and the remaining third was to be divided between his widow and his “unadvanced” children, the two older married daughters each having already received a generous dowery.\n\nAnne’s husband, Robert Offley, had joined Sir Edward as a Turkey Merchant, and he and Richard Staper were designated to be overseers of Sir Edward’s will. They likely settled his business affairs. However, Sir Edward’s widow quickly remarried again, and inheritance disputes arose between Osborne’s children and their step-mother Margaret Pratt Middleton Chapman Osborne Clarke. An agreement was reached that she could hold onto the Philpot Lane property in exchange for other estate properties. While the tiny statue one can see today on a building on Philpot Lane of two mice fighting over cheese was created long after the Osbornes lived there, it is rather symbolic of the struggle for his property. [14]\n\nSir Hewett Osborne did not pursue his father’s merchant career, but instead studied law at the Inner Temple and became a soldier, fighting with English forces in France, in the capture of Cadiz, and in Ireland where he died in a skirmish in 1599. His son, Sir Edward Osborne (II) became the 1st Baronet of Kiveton, but it was his son (Edward I’s great grandson) Thomas Osborne who achieved the greatest notoriety as the 1st Duke of Leeds. Despite scandals and a brief time in the Tower of London, he was one of the Immortal Seven who invited William III, Prince of Orange, to depose James II in the Glorious Revolution in 1688. The 12th and last Duke of Leeds, Francis D’Arcy Osborne died in 1964, and the dukedom became “extinct” for lack of male heirs. Lady Camilla Osborne, the living daughter of the 11th Duke, could not inherit the title or peerage, as she was a woman.\n\nOn another family line, Sarah Offley (Thorowgood), the daughter of Robert Offley and Anne Osborne, was the first of Sir Edward I’s descendants to live in the New World. Although she was born after her grandfather had died, she seemed to have inherited his tenacity and love for adventure. See prior post: The Fascinating and Formidable Sarah Offley Thorowgood Gookin Yeardley\n\nA Merchant Prince\n\nSir Edward Osborne was buried at St. Dionis Blackchurch on February 15, 1592 where a statue was erected in accordance with his will near his usual seat. Unfortunately, the statue was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. He was not forgotten, though. In summation of Osborne’s ventures, historian A.C. Wood concluded “With argosies on all the seas and ventures in every clime, he [Edward Osborne] was in fact the prototype of the merchant prince of the modern world.”[16]\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1.

Not of Adam (Thorowgood), but of his wife Sarah Offley’s grandmother, Anne Hewett. A fall believed to set in motion destinies. It would have begun as an ordinary day on the crowded and noisy London Bridge with its “sumptuous buildings and stately and beautiful houses… inhabited by wealthy citizens and furnished with all matter of trades, comparable in itself to a little Cittie.” At times, there were as many as 138 shops on the Bridge. In the mid-16th century, William Hewett, a noted and wealthy merchant and member of The Clothworkers Company, was assumed to have lived in one of those shop-below, home-above houses on the Bridge. However, whether one lived on the Bridge or not, it was a part of Londoners’ lives.[1]\n\nThere had been a bridge at that same spot on the Thames during Celtic and Roman times, but it was not until the reign of Henry II that construction of a massive stone bridge intended to support housing was begun. It was completed 33 years later during the reign of King John. Although the London Bridge later required countless repairs and much restructuring, it was a marvel among inhabited bridges in Europe, being the longest (919 feet long )and 20-26 feet wide. The Bridge was used for a remarkable 622 years until it was demolished in the reign of Queen Victoria. It had 20 arches which supported 3 to 6 storied buildings as well as the beautiful gothic Chapel of St. Thomas à Becket in its middle to memorialize the canonized martyr, at least until Henry VIII had it defaced.[2]\n\nIndeed, as London Bridge was the only bridge over the Thames in London until 1750, it witnessed much of the history of England. Over and under the Bridge, kings traveled to their coronations, brought their brides with lavish processions, and returned victorious after battles. In 1390, King Richard II sponsored a thrilling jousting match between the Champion of England and the Champion of Scotland on the narrow Bridge. However, the Bridge was also the site of bloodshed and revolt, as dissident groups tried to capture the city, including the Wyatt rebellion in early 1554 over Queen Mary’s proposal to King Phillip of Spain. The occupants of the Bridge watched armies come and royals flee during the complex War of the Roses and saw Henry VIII bring his succession of brides to the city. During seasons of plague, they also watched as throngs fled out of London.[3]\n\nIf those entering or leaving London needed a reminder of who was no longer in the king or queen’s favor, they only had to look up when they came to the Drawbridge or sometimes called Traitor’s Gate on the Bridge. In 1305, King Edward started a macabre tradition when he ordered the head of the captured Scot rebel, William Wallace, to be placed on a pike on the Drawbridge for all to see on land and water. Over the years, there were sometimes more than 30 rotting heads on display at a time, the mighty along with lesser known criminals. They were maintained by the appointed Keeper of the Heads who mounted the bloody heads on poles, and, when they were no longer of importance, threw their whitened skulls into the river.\n\nDuring the tumultuous political times when William Hewett lived in London, he would have seen many heads displayed of the once powerful who fell into disfavor, including Sir Thomas Moore, Bishop Fisher, and Sir Thomas Cromwell, and then, as the elected sheriff, would himself have had to send heads of Sir Thomas Wyatt’s rebels to be mounted there. In 1577, the Traitor’s Drawbridge Gate was torn down, but the display of heads was simply moved to the Great Stone Gate at the Southwark end of the Bridge.[4]\n\nThe earliest known written account of the day of the famous fall is in John Strype’s well-respected 1720 Survey of London, as it is not found in John Stow’s 1598 Survey of London which Strype incorporated. Strype said he also received some information from Rev. John Hewyt who had it from Edward Osborne’s great grandson, Sir Thomas Osborne, the 1st Duke of Leeds. On that particular day, screams from the home of William Hewett may have mixed with the usual din on the Bridge for to Hewett’s\n\nDaughter this mischance happened; (the Father then living upon London Bridge.) The Maid playing with her out of a Window over the River Thames, by chance dropt her in, almost beyond expectation of being saved. A young Gentleman, named Osborne, then Apprentice to Sir William the Father…at this calamitous Accident, immediately leapt in bravely, and saved the Child. In Memory of which Deliverance and in Gratitude, her Father afterwards bestowed her in Marriage on the said Mr. Osborne, with a very great Dowry.[5]\n\nEdward Osborne’s impulsive leap was considered brave, but also very risky. To support the weight of the Bridge with its buildings there were nineteen massive boat-shaped piers that acted like weirs, increasing the turbulence of the constricted water as it moved under the Bridge. Skilled and adventurous boatmen would sometimes attempt to “shoot the bridge” when the rapids would reach their peak during low tide, but not all survived. Thousands of people died in the waters under the Bridge, either by inadvertently falling off the Bridge, tumbling out of a boat, or not maneuvering through its arches. Boatmen around the Bridge were alert to help rescue when they could, but there were also dredgers who retrieved bodies from the shores.[6]\n\nThe Facts, Just the Facts\n\nOr did that incident ever really happen? Modern scholars now consider the story as apocryphal. They point out that dates do not support it. While Strype gave no dates or ages, Pennant in 1791 dated Edward’s rescue as early as 1536. However, Anne was not born until 1543/4. In addition, there is no record that William Hewett lived or had a business on London Bridge during Anne’s early years, if ever. It was also unlikely that a young child could have fallen that distance without serious injury or death or that anyone jumping into those rushing waters could have reached and retrieved the child so quickly, even if boatmen below were available to help. However, amazing things can happen. Recently, on May 2, 2021, a man dove 25 feet off a bridge into the Assawoman Bay in Maryland to successfully rescue a 2-year-old who had been ejected in a truck crash. [7]\n\nThe Victorian Legend\n\nThe Victorians had no difficulty believing the story. It was just the sort of chivalrous deed that caught their imagination. Anne Manning, an English novelist, who, like the earlier Jane Austin, never married, published 51 articles and books, several of which were historical fiction. In 1852, she published The Colloquies of Edward Osborne: Citizen and Clothmaker of London, imagining the challenges of his apprenticeship, his rescue of Anne, and concluding with their joyous wedding. Only a few years later in 1855, Charles Kingsley published his historical novel Westward Ho! telling the story of a privateer who sailed to the Caribbean with Sir Francis Drake. While recounting “The Most Chivalrous Adventure of the Good Ship Rose” in Chapter 16, Kinsgley had his protagonist describe a grand dinner in London onboard Drake’s Pelican, which had sailed around the world:[8]\n\nLook at the men all around; a nobler company you will seldom see….At the head of the table sites the lord mayor; whom readers will recognize at once, for he is none other than that Sir Edward Osborne, clothworker, and ancestor of the dukes of Leeds, whose romance is now in everyone’s hands. He is aged, but not changed, since he leaped from the window upon London Bridge into the roaring tide below, to rescue the infant who is now his wife….\n\nSo what do we actually know about Edward, William, and Anne?\n\nSir William Hewett\n\nWilliam Hewett was born in Wales in 1496, but served his apprenticeship in London as a young man. He was admitted to the Clothworker’s Company of London before 1529 when he started taking on his own apprentices and eventually worked with his brother Thomas and nephew Henry at his successful business on Candlewick Street. He became a Master of the Clothmaker’s Company in 1543, the year that his daughter Anne was born, and was elected an alderman.\n\nHewett was then elected as one of the two sheriffs for London for the year 1553/4 at which time he was asked to countersign the letters of King Edward VI who, dying young, had designated Lady Jane Grey, his Protestant cousin, as his successor. However, Catholic Queen Mary, his half-sister, took the throne from the “nine-day queen” and within months, Hewett, as sheriff, was ordered to arrest and oversee the execution of Lady Jane Grey, her husband, father, and others involved in Wyatt’s January rebellion.\n\nHewett was probably relieved when that bloody year ended. Having been a sheriff, he was then qualified to be elected for the usual one year term as the Lord Mayor of London. That occurred in September 1559, the first year of Queen Elizabeth’s reign. Sir William Hewett was knighted by Queen Elizabeth at Greenwich on January 21, 1559/60 and was the first member of the Clothmaker’s Company to serve as Mayor. [9]\n\nWilliam Hewett married Alice Leveson around 1536, she being the third daughter of Nicholas Leveson who was also a wealthy London mercer and had served a term as sheriff. In addition to his business on Candlewick, the Hewetts had a home on Philpot Lane as well as several country houses and estates. Although they had at least three sons in addition to Anne, only Anne survived to inherit. Alice Hewett was known for being pious and doing charitable acts, and, when she died in 1561, she was buried with much ceremony. Anne’s mother, thus, was not present when Anne married her father’s apprentice Edward Osborne around 1562. Sir William died January 25, 1566/7, leaving most of his considerable wealth and lands to Anne and Edward Osborne. He also contributed money for charitable works, including a water conduit for London, care for inmates of London prisons, and for schools and hospitals. According to Stryke, Sir William had a remarkable estate valued at £6000 per annum when he died.[10]\n\nUnanswered Questions\n\nIf the tale of Edward’s leap leaves unanswered questions, so do the facts. As has been referenced, Sir Edward Osborne also was knighted and became a sheriff, mayor, and an even more successful overseas merchant than his father-in-law. With such acclaim and prosperity during their lives, what purpose would it have served for someone to concoct such a story about them and why about the Bridge? As with so many rumors and legends, could there be a kernel of truth in it? Was the story known, but not recorded by Stow by 1598, or was it a family story passed on and maybe elaborated by the Osborne children? Could something have happened to them at the Bridge even though they were not living there? Perhaps Edward’s rescue of Anne took place at another location or in a different manner. One constant in the story is the idea that because Edward had rescued Hewett’s daughter, he was preferred above all others to marry her. Rescued her from what though?\n\nAnother known suitor of Anne Hewett was George Talbot, the sixth earl of Shrewsbury, a fellow member of the Clothworker’s Company, and an intimate friend of William Hewett. Yet, Sir William was reported to say, “Osborne saved her, and Osborne should enjoy her.” If there were not some type of incident, why then did Sir William decide to give his only child and most of his wealth to his apprentice from an undistinguished family when there were more prestigious offers? Did Hewett see in Osborne the sons he had lost and recognize Osborne’s remarkable potential as a partner? Or might the real story be even more of a romance where the daughter of the rich man fell in love with the poorer, but worthy servant, and they convinced the father to let love prevail? That sounds like a Shakespeare kind of tale, and he certainly had no qualms about embellishing history in that era.[11]\n\nMore relevant to this blog, would any of this history have impacted Adam and Sarah Offley Thorowgood in Virginia in the 17th century? Sometimes people can be influenced more by what they believe occurred than the actual events. The reputation and positions of the Osbornes and then Offleys might well have been a consideration in their marriage and likely would have been known and respected by the gentlemen, their wives, and the successful merchants in the New World. Colonists may not have heard of “the fall,” yet, being a descendent of William Hewett, Edward Osborne, and Robert Offley would have brought status in their new society. (see coming post)\n\nHappily Ever After\n\nEven if this wonderful tale is now considered to be a legend of the Renaissance, it presents a new twist on a favorite archetype: a brave unknown young man gallantly thrusts himself into the belly of the raging river “beast” to rescue a beloved child only to be handsomely rewarded by a grateful father. One wonders what it was about these three very verifiable people that such a story was attributed to them. Whether or not William Hewett, Anne Hewett, and Edward Osborne ever lived on London Bridge or Edward leapt from it to rescue Anne, their names and romantic story have become part of the Bridge’s lore. The best part: the real Edward Osborne and Anne Hewett did marry and live happily ever after, or at least until Anne’s death on July 14, 1585.\n\nNext post: Mighty Merchants of Distinction: The Elizabethan Sir Edward Osborne and Robert Offley of the Stuart Era\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1] Pierce, Patricia, Old London Bridge, (London: Headline Book Publishing, 2001), 4, 128-129, 143. “London Bridge,” Wikipedia, 1-6.

They responded:\n\n“Whereas Mrs. Sarah Gookin hath been often times by several orders of this Court formerly and also at this present summoned to give an account according to the Act of Assembly of all the estate belonging to the children of Adam Thorowgood deceased in her custody and possession which Mrs. Gookin utterly refuseth as by a letter under her hand appeareth….This court to set a further…punishment on the said Mrs. Gookin as they shall think fit.” [1]\n\nThe court had asked nicely and then threatened fines, but Sarah had ignored their multiple requests. Yet, seven years after Adam’s death, they still had done nothing about it. Sarah not only “utterly refused,” but she belittled their authority in her letter. Many have assumed this matter was resolved pleasantly when the twice widowed Mrs. Thorowgood Gookin shortly thereafter married the former governor’s son, Francis Yeardley. Yeardley reassured the court that he would attend to the matter, and the fine was dropped. However, eight years later on April 16, 1655, shortly after Francis’ death, the court again ordered Sarah on behalf of her children to produce “a true and full account of the estate of …Capt. Adam Thorowgood.” [2]\n\nSarah and the Courts\n\nWho was this woman who defied the county elites and an Act of the Assembly and was never punished? What was she like, and was she likable? It is a challenge to bring 17th century settlers to life, especially women, based on the limited records available. Sarah stands out as she appeared in many and varied records of the Lower Norfolk County Courts over a period of 20 years. However, as court cases revolve around conflicts, those records can give a distorted view of a total person. One could possibly conclude from the above incident that Sarah was obstinate or disorganized or that there was animosity between her and the justices. Her relationship with the justices was complicated. Sarah’s first husband Adam had been the first presiding justice of that court, and it initially met in their home. Many of the justices likely dined at her elegant table with her bone-handled knives and forks, silver spoons, and European ceramics as they and their wives socialized with Sarah and her husbands. Thomas Willoughby declined Adam’s request to assist Sarah as an overseer to his will, but then went into business a year later with Sarah’s second husband, John Gookin. Despite the ongoing conflict regarding the accounting, these justices generally found for Sarah in her other suits in Lower Norfolk County Court.[3] See prior “Knives, Forks, and Silver Spoons.”\n\nThis post is intended as an introduction to Sarah, and all of these incidents and more will be considered in greater detail in the coming months. In Sarah’s defiant letter of refusal, she argued that her position as a mother who was given full guardianship of her own children by her husband at his death should set her apart from court-appointed guardians and exempt her from the Act’s demands. She disputed that she should be asked to give accounts to anyone but her children. The justices, who had not had legal training, may have been frustrated with Sarah and not agreed with her arguments, but they were hesitant to take action against her. Sarah was involved over 90 times in court matters as plaintiff, defendant, witness, or party to, during those years, far more than other women and most men in Lower Norfolk County.\n\nAt the end of her letter, Sarah included a postscript addressed to Thomas Ivy, the High Sheriff who delivered her letter: “My respects to yourself and wife most kindly remembered to whom I have sent a small basket of apples.” There is no physical portrait or description of Sarah, and attempting to draw her personality portrait also has its limitations. Sarah could easily be judged litigious by her number of court cases, but not knowing the number of apple baskets she gave away makes it hard to know if she was also kind and generous to friends.[4]\n\nGrowing Up Offley\n\nSarah Offley was christened on April 18, 1609 at St. Benet, Gracechurch, London. She grew up as one of the youngest of 13 siblings, two boys having already died in infancy. Her father, Robert Offley was a leading merchant in London, a member of the East India Company and the Levant Company (he was a “Turkey” merchant authorized to trade with the Ottoman Empire), and an investor in the Virginia Company and the Bermuda Company. Sarah’s mother, Anne Osbourne, was the daughter of the famed Sir Edward Osbourne and Anne Hewett whose story of a daring rescue was still famous during Sarah’s upbringing and will be covered in the next post. As important merchants, Sarah’s grandfather and great grandfather were both knighted and elected Lord Mayor of London. Sarah’s family had both wealth and notoriety in England.[5]\n\nSarah’s childhood home on the fashionable Gracechurch Street in London was likely stimulating and comfortable. She grew up hearing of far away places and discoveries and would have been aware of the business dealings of her father and older brothers. Although there were some schools for girls in that era, most were taught in their homes by their mothers and/or tutors who also instructed their brothers. Among the wealthy, daughters would have learned to read and write as well as refinements such as dance, music, and needlework in addition to the skills needed to manage a household. Some even learned a modern or ancient language (usually French), but daughters did not have access like the sons to a university education. Based on some of the Virginia court proceedings, we know Sarah did read and write, and from an inventory taken when her third husband Francis died that they had nine books in their Virginia home that were valued at a substantial 500 pounds of tobacco.[6]\n\nThrough a quirky twist of fate to be explored in another post, the unfinished 1619-1624 account book of Sarah’s older brother John Offley in London ended up being brought to Virginia and used 50 years later to record the Lower Norfolk County Court proceedings. That surviving record reveals that John, his father, and several other brothers worked together as harberdashers (importers and suppliers of small luxury personal and household items). Knowing some of the goods they obtained during this period of Sarah’s childhood provides a window into the types of items she would have seen and enjoyed in her home as a rich merchant’s daughter. Her family dealt in expensive spices, such as four types of peppercorns, cloves, and nutmeg from the Spice Islands as well as Persian carpets, Turkish silks, Cordovan leather, diamonds, and the new expensive European watches which they obtained from exotic ports that included Constantinople, Aleppo, Marseille, Florence, Venice, Dunkirk, Antwerp, Amsterdam, Greek Isles, and the East Indies.[7]\n\nKey questions prompting the initiation of this blog were how Sarah Offley and Adam Thorowgood got together and why she left her comfortable life to come to Virginia. In an earlier post, it was noted that there were no connections between their fathers, Thorowgood being a minister in Norfolk and Offley a merchant in London and both having died while Adam was serving his indentureship in Virginia. It was more likely that Sarah and Adam’s older brothers had a part in connecting them or at least giving approval for the match of 23-year-old Adam and 18-year-old Sarah in 1627. Sarah, with her considerable dowery and family connections, likely would have had other prospects and could have lived a predictable and comfortable life in England. Yet, something attracted her to adventuresome Adam when he returned to England and excited her about a more challenging and uncertain life far away from family. See prior “How Sarah Offley Met Adam Thorowgood”\n\nAlthough Adam had received an inheritance at his father’s death, it was probable that a significant part of Sarah’s dowery went to pay for the transport of the 46 headrights they brought with them when they sailed to Virginia in 1628, and the 59 headrights they paid for in subsequent years. In marrying Adam, Sarah found her way to become an adventurer and investor in her own future like many in her family lines. Although marriages were mostly arranged between families, women had the right of refusal. Sarah would have known Adam’s plans to return to Virginia and his desire to recruit headrights. Sarah’s older sister Anne and her family later joined Sarah in Lower Norfolk County, Virginia, but Sarah was on her own in those early years of marriage and during the initial adjustment to a life with less luxury. Although Adam made a return trip to England, Sarah never did. See prior “Pied Pipers to Virginia” and “Competing for Emigrants.”\n\nA Femme Sole and a Femme Covert\n\nWas Sarah involved in so many court cases because she was a difficult woman or because being a woman in that era made it difficult for her to fulfill a man’s responsibilities? Or was it some of both? Adam Thorowgood had left Sarah as the sole executrix of his will and sole guardian of their children and estates. Did she feel she had to prove to others that she could competently handle one of the largest estates in Virginia while still raising 4, then 5, small children? Like her husbands, Sarah had workers to assist her, but she would not have had access to the informal, back-room ways to resolve conflicts and do business with the other gentlemen. Most of the suits she initiated were for debt collection. Did she feel the need for judicial backing to show the community that she meant business? Finding how to be taken seriously is a dilemma that has faced many women with executive responsibilities.\n\nComplicating everything was the legal status of single vs. married English women at the time. The overriding principal of coverture in English common law was that a woman’s rights, particularly property rights, were different depending on a woman’s marital status. The affairs of a young unmarried woman were handled by her father. When she married, she was considered a femme covert, and her property and family decisions were controlled by her husband. When she was widowed or if she remained an unmarried single, she became a femme sole who had the right to own property, enter contracts, and manage her own affairs. While sounding simple, there was actually much variance in how the concept was applied both with regional differences in England and significant variations within and between the colonies regarding the rights of women.[8]\n\nWith the high death rates in the colonies, remarriage was common and desirable for life in the New World. For a woman, though, it was not just about the adjustment of creating new family bonds, but also relinquishing her freedom and property to a new husband to manage. For some, it would have been a relief to let go of that burden; others may have found it hard to give up control of their lives. Sarah chose to remarry a year after Adam’s death, but John Gookin died two years later, leaving her with another child and more estate to manage. It was four years before Sarah decided to marry again. Her marriage to Francis Yeardley lasted about 10 years, when after his death in 1655, she remained a widow until her death in 1657. Sarah’s use of the courts is even more astounding considering that she was a femme sole for only about 7 total years. Did she find it hard to step in and out of that role? Did she enjoy being in charge or prefer being cared for? One wonders if she acted or was perceived differently when she was married.[9]\n\nMuch is made of Sarah not providing the requested lists of livestock to be passed on to her children, but few mention her successes. Sarah managed large and complex holdings, vigorously pursued debt collection to protect her children’s assets, defended the family’s reputation and honor, and arranged for good marriages for her daughters. By the end, she was in charge of the large estates left her by all three of her husbands.\n\nSarah’s Reputation Over Time\n\nThe reaction of the justices indicates that Sarah stood out from the norm of women in the eyes of her contemporaries. It is not known how many more strong, wealthy widows there were in Virginia similar to Sarah, as unfortunately many county court records have been lost or destroyed. Authors and historians have had varied reactions to Sarah. In the 1881 articles in the Richmond Standard about the Thorowgood family history, she is only mentioned as Adam’s wife. In the early 20th century, when Phillip A. Bruce wrote his books on the economic, social, and institutional histories of 17th century Virginia, he called Adam Thorowgood a “principal figure” of his era, but Sarah was only mentioned because of her English pedigree which added social stature to Virginia. In the address by Rev. Beverly Dandridge Tucker in 1921 for the Tercentenary of the arrival of Adam Thorowgood, Adam and his ancestors and descendants were praised, but Sarah was mentioned only for her marriages and items in her inventories, not for her part in creating their “goodly heritage.” [10]\n\nBy the mid-20th century, more writers took notice of Sarah, but not all descriptions were flattering. Louisa Kyle in the Norfolk Virginian-Pilot in 1955 brought favorable attention to Sarah Offley as the “first lady of Lynnhaven” who dispensed “first Virginia hospitality.” In recounting incidents in Sarah’s life, Ms. Kyle concluded Sarah was “more remarkable than her husband.” However, when transcribing the incident when the justices fined the sheriff in 1647 for not having collected a fine from Mrs. Gookin, the transcriber of the Lower Norfolk Court records, Alice G. Walter, added an editorial comment that “Sarah must have had the men in her spell, or they were afraid of her.”[11]\n\nIn 1973, George H. Tucker, a writer for The Virginian-Pilot who relished exposing eccentricities of Norfolk’s historic residents, characterized Sarah thus: “The testy character of Madam Sarah Thoroughgood Gookin Yeardley, first grande dame of Lower Norfolk County, has rumbled down the centuries like the muffled thunder of far-off artillery….One of the first things a newcomer learned in her day was to steer clear of anything remotely connected with her. Those who disregarded the warning usually had the sheriff pounding on their doors before their criticisms were cold.” Florence Turner concluded in her history of early Princess Anne County that Sarah was “a woman so strong that she was the envy of every woman in the Colony and a match for any man. Sarah Thorowgood managed to bend every man to her will. Although her ambitions were purely selfish, she was an outstanding leader of women as well as men.” [12]\n\nIn 1994, Thomas Parramore had a different take and made Sarah and her defiance of the justices a central focus of a chapter in his history, Norfolk: The First Four Centuries. He exclaimed: “A vexation to magistrates and a terror to traducers of her family, her independent spirit and dogged defense of what she conceived as her right was as close to the essence of Anglo-American self-government as the seventeenth century was to come. Sarah is as entitled as any man to be considered a founder of Norfolk society and its special character.” [13]\n\nThe Final Court Case\n\nIn discussing Sarah’s final court case on August 18, 1657, just prior to her death, Ms. Turner surmised that “Sarah’s death was no doubt a relief to many, including her son….He soon came of age…and moved his large family…into his mother’s house.” We do not know the cause of Sarah’s death or whether she was ill before she filed a suit to resolve the boundary of an orchard with a neighbor. Was she spending her last breath with a final act of harassment or trying her best to make sure everything was in order for her heir? Would anyone have even commented on the timing of this suit or the inconvenience of waiting for an inheritance if it were a gentleman on his deathbed? Adam II was still an unmarried minor at Sarah’s death and did not have a large family waiting to move into her house. Archaeological evidence indicates that Sarah’s Chesopean site home burned around the 1650s, so Adam II had to build his own family residence. [14]\n\nReframing Sarah’s Reputation\n\nI will now try my hand at sketching Sarah’s personality with support to be provided in the coming months. I see Sarah as competent, strong, bold, confident, and adventuresome. She was assertive, self-assured in her positions, and not concerned with the opinions of others. Sarah had a strong sense of what she perceived as justice, little tolerance for being wronged, and a desire for success. She was fiercely loyal and protective of her family. Sarah was a partner to her husbands and engendered trust and confidence from them. She probably would not have been described as “sweet,” meek, or patient, but I do not see her as essentially selfish.\n\nThese traits were evident in an event near the end of Sarah’s life. It appeared to be with pride that her third husband, Frances Yeardley, wrote on May 8, 1654 of the following incident to John Ferrar, Esq., the former treasurer of the Virginia Company in London. More context and detail will be given in a future post. Francis had befriended a native tribe in North Carolina and invited its chief to visit him in Virginia. The chief accepted the invitation, but when he appeared with his great men, Francis was away conducting business in Maryland. The coming of the chief created concern and displeasure among Sarah Yeardley’s neighbors. Not one to be intimidated by native peoples or neighbors, Sarah acted boldly and took the situation literally in hand. Francis wrote:[15]\n\n…in my absence, some people…murmured and carried themselves uncivilly towards them [the Indians]…and by some over-busy justices of the place, (my wife having brought him to church in the congregation), after sermon threatened to whip him and send him away. The great man was very much afraid and much appalled; but my wife kept him in her hand by her side, and confidently and constantly… resisted their threatenings….She worthily engaged my whole fortunes for any damage should arise by or from them [the Indians] till my return….\n\nWhat kind of a woman would do something like that? Let’s find out.\n\nNext Post: The Fall of Anne Hewett (Into the Thames) and the Rise of Edward Osborne\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1] Walter, Alice Granbery, Lower Norfolk County, Virginia, Court Records : Book “B,” 1646-1651/2 (Baltimore: Clearfield, 2009), 47-48.\n\n[2] Walter, Book “B,” 53.

For 19 years, he had prospered in Virginia, skirting fatal fevers, salt poisoning, Powhatan attacks, trans-Atlantic mishaps, and political intrigues. When Adam accepted the prestigious appointment as a member of the Governor’s Council in 1637, he surely thought it would open greater opportunities, not lead to his death. Adam’s will was dated February 17, 1639/40 and was entered into probate at the Quarter Court held in James City on April 27, 1640. As the Julian Calendar was still in use in England, the year did not end until March 25th which created confusions even at that time, as most of Europe had already changed to the Gregorian Calendar which began with January 1. Thus, Adam’s will was probated 8 weeks after being written, not a year and eight weeks later. The original copy of Adam’s will as recorded in James City no longer exists, but fortunately the content was preserved when it was printed in The Richmond Standard by one of his descendants in 1881. [1]\n\nAdam had presided at the Lower Norfolk County Court on October 18, 1639. He likely passed the Christmas season at home with his family, although being of a Puritan persuasion, there would have been little celebration. Adam and several of his servants then traveled to James City to attend the General Assembly convened on January 6, 1639/40 by Governor Francis Wyatt who had just replaced the disgraced Gov. Harvey. Under the new leadership, it was a busy and productive session with 34 Acts passed. [2] We do not know when it concluded, but somehow and sometime in that period, Adam Thorowgood and his accompanying servants took ill. Within weeks, Adam died.\n\nTreatment by Dr. George Calvert\n\nKilling fevers were the scourge of Jamestown, but they could result from many disorders. Adam Thorowgood had been fortunate to spend his “seasoning” period in the vicinity of Elizabeth City and the rest of his time in Virginia mostly away from the disease-ridden Jamestown. It is not known what killed Adam. It was not the season for malaria, and “remittent fevers” were more likely in the spring and fall, although scarlatine fever was found year round. Contaminated food and water were common and could lead to typhoid fever or bloody flux (dysentery) at any season. Influenza, more typical in the fall or winter, was also a common cause of fever deaths. [3]\n\nIn 1610, Dr Lawrence Bohune was the first English physician sent to the Virginia Colony. Dr. John Pott was sent to replace him in 1620, but few trained doctors followed in subsequent years. Physician services were so expensive that the General Assembly noted in 1639 the “immoderate and excessive rates and prices exacted by practitioners in physick and chyrurgery.”. Most Virginians tried herbs and remedies on their own, sometimes seeking out a surgeon instead of a physician as they were cheaper, though not as well regarded or trained. Despite their political differences, Gov. John Harvey even asked the English courts to overturn a 1630 Virginia court conviction of Dr. Pott because he was “the only physician in Virginia skilled in epidemical diseases” at the time. In 1639/40 when Adam became ill, Dr. Pott had moved to the area that would become Williamsburg, but a new physician, Dr. George Calvert, had arrived who was acquiring land using his headrights in the Buckroe area of Elizabeth City. Dr. Calvert was called upon to treat Adam. [4] When Adam’s estate was being settled in April 1641, it was noted in the James City Quarter Court that\n\nthe estate of Adam Thorowgood, deceased, stands indebted to the estate of George Calvert, physician, in the sum of £ 20:16.6 sterling for physics administered to the sd. Capt. Adam Thorowgood and his servants in the time of their sickness. [5]\n\nThe “physics” or treatments would likely have followed the popular theory of Galen’s system of four bodily “humors” with the heat of a fever being thought to be too much hot blood in the system. According to Dr. Sequeyra of early Williamsburg, the diseases of winter and spring were “generally of the Inflammatory kind; require plentiful bleeding…and sometimes blisters.” This, as well as the popular purges, left many patients in a more weakened and dehydrated state which exacerbated the course of diseases. William Harvey, an English physician, challenged that thinking with his 1629 book On the Motion of Heart and Blood, and treatments began to include more chemical and metallic remedies. It is not known if English-trained Dr. Calvert tried any of these new ideas or treatments on Adam. Sadly, Dr. Calvert himself did not survive long in Virginia. [6]\n\nThe Burial\n\nNo one is certain whether Adam Thorowgood was treated by Dr. Calvert and died at James City or in Elizabeth City on transit to his home or if he was able to make it back to Lynnhaven before he died. All three of those sites were easily connected by water. Wherever, he had sufficient strength and awareness to prepare a comprehensive will in which he left instructions for his burial: “I bequeath my soul into the hands of my Creator and Redeemer and my body to the earth from which it was taken, to be buried in the Parish Churchyard near my children….” Adam was leaving behind four young children who were very much on his mind in his will, and he would have wanted them to remember him. Some have speculated that Adam might have been referring to unknown buried children. As happened to many settlers, Adam and Sarah likely had other children born to them in their earlier years of marriage who died young, but there is no record of them.\n\nAdam had given land for the Lynnhaven Parish church to be built on the Lynnhaven River near his home. It must have been at least started by the time of his death when he willed “to the Parish Church of Lynnhaven one thousand pounds of tobacco in leaf, to be disbursed for some necessary and decent ornament.” While the lot where that church stood has now been reclaimed by the river, a visitor there in 1819 recorded that the black marble tombstones for Sarah and her second husband John Gookin were still partly above water and readable. However, by 1853, another visitor, William Forrest, noted “the old church has long since fallen to ruins; indeed no vestige remains to mark the identical spot which it occupied …and the old graveyard has also disappeared!” However, he knew of a tall man who had walked out into the river up to his chin and stood on the church gravestones. The first Lynnhaven Church is now memorialized as Church Point in Virginia Beach. There has been discussion of doing underwater archaeology, but nothing has been done yet to explore that site. [7]\n\n“My Dearly Beloved Wife”\n\nWhile it was common in a will in those times to refer to one’s wife as “beloved,” the conditions of Adam’s will indicate genuine love, respect, and confidence in his wife of just over 12 years. He perceived the feelings to be mutual as he also referred to her as “my loving wife.” He made her not only his sole executrix, but also stated that “she shall have the guardianship of all of my children and their estates, until my daughters come to the age of sixteen years, and my son Adam to the age of one and twenty.” In that era, children were considered orphans when their fathers died, and they were typically appointed male guardians who were relatives or men of standing in the community. With his position and status, there were many Adam could have chosen as suitable guardians for his children, especially for his son who stood to inherit so much, but he unequivocally chose Sarah. In addition to the other bequests Adam had made to her, he added, “and for my wife’s care and pains in bringing up the children in good virtue and training, and likewise for handling and looking after their stocks of cattle, my will and desire is that she shall have all the male increase during the time of their guardianship.” He recognized her efforts as a mother and that his death would increase that burden. The term “cattle” was sometimes used to refer generically to livestock. [8]\n\nWidows were entitled to a portion of their husband’s estate to enjoy during their lifetime. Adam gave Sarah “all the houses and the orchard with the plantation at Lynnhaven… and the ground called by the name of the Quarter during her lifetime.” as well as one of the best sows and calves, a half dozen breeding goats, four breeding sows, and, remarkably, “one mare and one foal, she to take her choice of which she pleaseth…all of which I give her as a memorial of my love.” In accordance with the custom of primogeniture, their only son, Adam II, was to receive “all the rest of his father’s houses and lands in Virginia and elsewhere” when he turned 21 as well as the property willed to his mother after her death. “In Virginia” would have referred to the properties Adam owned in the area of Elizabeth City. “Elsewhere” probably referred to the small land holdings in England Adam had inherited in his father’s will. Adam Thorowgood provided for his daughters Ann, Sarah, and Elizabeth by dividing among his wife, daughters, and son the remaining cows, goats, hogs, mares and horses, servants, crops, and the rest of his estate (excluding his other bequests). Adam and Sarah had at least three enslaved servants at that time, but also had indentured servants under time-limited contracts that would have been passed on. In 1645, his wife Sarah designated Mary as her chosen enslaved servant. [9]\n\nWhile there are not exact birthdates for any of their four children, they were all young at the time of Adam’s death. When Sarah Thorowgood Gookin, once again a widow, submitted a letter to the Lower Norfolk Court on July 13, 1647 regarding her children’s inheritances, she indicated none had yet reached majority. Adam II may have been the youngest as he was not 21 when his mother died in 1657, so he requested his brother-in-law (his sister Sarah’s husband) Simon Overzee as his guardian. Thus, daughters Ann, Sarah, and Elizabeth would have been born after 1630 and Adam II after 1636. [10]\n\nGoat Gifts\n\nWhat would be an appropriate token to show appreciation to those outside one’s immediate family? How about a goat? Living in a tobacco economy with no banks or accounting houses in Virginia to hold cash, the gift of a breeding goat was like giving away stocks today. If one cared properly for the gift, it would increase and bring returns for many years to come. The raising of livestock was profitable in 17th century Virginia. The most common animals to raise were hogs, cows, and goats that could be left to roam and forage for themselves rather than being wholly dependent on cleared pastures and crops raised for their feed. This practice led to some contention between neighbors over damaged gardens, and in 1631-32, a statute was passed requiring landowners to fence in their crops if they wanted them protected from hungry and destructive livestock. It was during that busy 1639/40 Assembly session that the law changed to required settlers to pen in their hogs, but that was later repealed in 1642. [11]\n\nFew sheep were raised in Virginia until the second half of the century when fenced green pastures became more available and wolves somewhat less abundant. However, for many years the most valuable of the animals was the prized, but scarce, horse. In 1649, there were only 300 horses in Virginia. Even as late as 1688, a mare and a foal, such as Sarah received, were worth eight cows. In the Lower Norfolk County area, the numerous streams and rivers served as natural fencing which helped to contain livestock. However, Adam Thorowgood had had both a cow keeper and a goat keeper to look after his animals. In a 1642-43 accounting of Adam’s estate, there were 63 cows and steers, 107 goats, 58 of which were breeders, and 7 horses as well as an undetermined number of hogs. So who got Adam’s goats? [12]\n\nEdward Windham\n\nIn his will, Adam Thorowgood referred to Edward as his “well beloved brother,” but used the term “brother” in a broader kinship relationship. Edward was actually the brother of his sister-in-law, Ann Wyndham, who had married his older brother Rev. Thomas Thorowgood. Adam had brought Edward to Virginia as a headright in 1634, and by 1637, Edward was serving as a justice with Adam in the Lower Norfolk Court. He also served as a Burgess. Edward received a cow calf and a breeding goat. [13]\n\nRobert Hayes\n\n“My brother, Robert Hayes,” was actually Adam’s brother-in-law who had married Sarah’s older widowed sister Ann Offley Workman. At age 44 in 1637, Robert claimed a certificate for the transportation of eight people to the Colony, consisting of him and his wife; Amos, Mary, Thomas, and John Wortman/ Workman; and Alexander and Nathaniel Hayes. Robert purchased land around Little Creek in Lower Norfolk, represented Lower Norfolk as a Burgess in the Assembly, and was a vestryman for the Lynnhaven Parish. This Robert Hayes was not the son Robert of Sir Thomas Hayes, a Lord Mayor, but may have been kin as Sir Thomas moved in many of the same merchant circles as the Offleys. Adam willed a breeding goat to Robert and one “to each of Robert Hayes’ three sons.” Ann Hayes who survived her husband Robert by a few months, mentioned four sons, Nathaniel and Adam Hayes and Thomas and John Workman, in her 1650 will, leaving one to wonder which one did not get one of Adam’s goats and why. Amos Workman signed the codicil to Ann’s will, but his relationship to Ann Hayes was not explained. [14]\n\nAdam Keeling\n\nThe entry “To my godson, Adam Keeling, one breeding goat,” explicitly stated Adam K.’s relationship to Adam T. who was his godfather and namesake. Thomas Keeling, Adam K.’s father, had been been brought to Virginia as a headright by Adam Thorowgood in 1628 aboard the Hopewell. In 1634, Thomas himself transported four headrights to the Colony, including his wife Anne. In 1637, he was an agent for Adam Thorowgood, and in 1640 he was appointed a vestryman for the parish. Thomas became an Ensign and then a Lieutenant in the militia. He acquired property across the Lynnhaven River from the Thorowgoods, and their descendants were neighbors and friends for many years. Like the later brick Thoroughgood House, there is a privately-owned brick ancestral home of the Keelings from that same era that gained the name “Ye Dudleys.” When Thomas died, Ann Keeling married Robert Bray. [15]\n\nBecause of the many close connections between those two families, some online family trees have claimed that Thomas’s wife was an Anne Thorowgood and the sister or niece of Adam Thorowgood. However, Adam’s only sister was Frances who married and stayed in England. Neither was Ann Keeling the daughter of his brother Sir John Thorowgood of Kensington as has also been suggested, because Sir John had no surviving descendants as confirmed in his will. If she were a Thorowgood, there were multiple other families of that name in England. However, no 17th century documents have been provided by those making the claim to verify Ann’s maiden name or ancestry. If Anne Keeling had been a relative, Adam Thorowgood surely would have acknowledged that relationship in his will as he did with Windham and Hayes. [16]\n\nJane Wheeler and William Stephens\n\nJane Wheeler and William Stephens each received both a breeding goat and a shoat (young pig). However, there are no records of any connection they had to Adam Thorowgood. Neither Jane nor William appear in court or land records with the Thorowgoods or their associates nor were they prominent in the Colony. Ann Hayes included a kinswoman named Jane Needham in her will, which might lead one to speculate a re-marriage or transcription error, but Adam Thorowgood gave no relationship to this Jane. Perhaps Jane Wheeler and William Stephens had rendered special services or assisted in the time of Adam’s illness. Whatever, they were both recipients of a generous gift. [17]\n\nOverseers of the Will\n\nIn that era, overseers were sometimes appointed to assist and supervise the work of the executor of a will. To assist with the Virginia affairs, Adam Thorowgood selected his “well beloved friends” Capt. Thomas Willoughby and Henry Seawell who both served as justices at the Lower Norfolk Court like Adam. However, sometimes one can be wrong on how “beloved” friends might be. After Adam’s death, both declined to serve in that capacity without explanation, so it is not known if they did not have the time, did not want to be entangled in Adam’s affairs, did not want to work with his wife Sarah, were encouraged to withdraw by Sarah, or thought everything was in order. Adam had planned that each overseer would receive a gold ring of 20 schillings value as “a pledge of my love,” which hopefully they did not accept as they did not do the work. [18]\n\nFor the English affairs, Adam appointed his “dearly beloved brother Sir John Thorowgood of Kensington” and Mr. Alexander Harris whom Adam identified as his wife’s uncle living on Tower Hill. It was logical that Adam would rely on his brother Sir John who was a Gentleman of the Bed Chamber of Charles I and with whom Adam had been involved with tobacco shipments. However, the identity and involvement of Mr. Alexander Harris is a mystery. Sarah did not have an “Uncle Alexander,” and there is no Harris to be found in the extensive official Offley Pedigree or known of in the Osbourne line. Even if Harris were extended kin to Sarah Offley Thorowgood, she had several wealthy and influential brothers living in London who could have handled any claims. Perhaps, Harris worked for or with one of her uncles. In that era, Tower Hill was still the main place for executions, but, according to the London tithable list for 1638, Alexander Harris was one of the wealthy living there amongst the almshouses, foundry, small shops, and housing for foreigners. Was he the Alexander Harris who was the former warden of Fleet Prison or the one involved with shipping to Virginia? How Adam connected to Alexander is still a puzzle. [19]\n\nAdam’s older brother Sir John Thorowgood of Kensington was not all that some have claimed. Fortunately, Adam used the designation “of Kensington'” because there were two Sir John Thorowgoods in London at the time. Unfortunately, their identities were merged in mid-19th century publications in America, and many historians and genealogists have since perpetuated the claim that Adam’s brother had been a secretary for the Earl of Pembroke who had close ties to the Virginia Company. However, Pembroke’s secretary was Sir John Thorowgood of Charing Cross who served as a Minister of Parliament. Likewise, the 17th century portrait of “Sir John Thorowgood” often seen today is most likely of this other Sir John. Adam’s brother was never in Parliament, but remarkably managed to go from the court of Charles I to a responsible trustee position in the Interregnum government back to an honored position in the court of Charles II in the Restoration. More relevant to this post, though, Sir John lived comfortably in England to the age of 80. Adam achieved success, but the New World adventurer was dead at 36.\n\nSpecial thanks to Jorja Jean for sharing her insights and research.\n\nNext Post: Sarah Offley Thorowgood Gookin Yeardley, A Formidable Woman of the 17th Century\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] “The Thorowgood Family of Princess Anne County, Va, ” The Richmond Standard, 4:13 (26 November 1881).

The igniting spark was that Harvey had not forwarded to the King the original reply of the councillors and burgesses regarding the King’s proposed tobacco plan. Angry and suspicious, Harvey had his Secretary John Kemp roused that night to arrest three leaders of the protest (Francis Pott, Capt. Martin, and William English) and to summon his Council to consider trying them under martial law.\n\nWhen the Council met on April 29, most of them preferred to decide the matter as a civil case, but the Governor demanded each councillor write without discussion what should be the plight of those arrested, which several refused to do. The following day when George Menefie, a usually moderate councillor, answered Harvey’s question about the colonists’ complaints, the Governor decided Menefie must be complicit and struck him on the shoulder declaring, “I arrest you on suspicion of treason.” At that moment, Councillors Samuel Matthews and John Utie jumped up, seized the Governor, and placed him under house arrest. At a signal, Dr. John Potts, brother of arrested Francis Potts and himself a former interim Governor, had Harvey’s house where they were meeting surrounded by 40-50 armed musketeers “at the ready.” [1]\n\nOr something like that. Governor Harvey wrote his version; Samuel Matthews prepared his own statement; Secretary Kemp sent a version to the Privy Council, and Sir John Zouch’s son sent his recollection to his father in England. Matthews complained: “the Governor usurped the whole power, in all causes without any respect to the votes of the council.” The Governor countered: “Instead of giving me assistance, they stand contesting and disputing my authority, averring that I can do nothing but what they shall advise me, and that my power extendeth no further than a bare casting voice.” There were small variances in the accounts, but the basic facts were undisputed. [2]\n\nThe incident was about the division of power much more than an unsent letter. With no granted authority, the Governor’s Council “thrust out” their governor and forced him to return to England to appear before the Privy Council. The Virginia Council then selected one of their own, John West, as the temporary governor. After some maneuvering, John Harvey returned to England on May 23, 1635 with two of his accusers. It was a successful coup and America’s first rebellion against royal authority, but the conflict was not yet over. [3]\n\nRound 2: Win for the Governor\n\nSir John Harvey won Round 2 on January 18, 1636-7, when he landed back in Virginia as the recommissioned Governor of His Majesty, King Charles I. Although Harvey had had to pay for the sailors, supplies, and repairs to the leaky Black George to return, he had gotten his payback in having the accusers who had accompanied him to London themselves arrested before they could take action against him. When he appeared before the Privy Council in December, they found the councillor’s charges against him to be groundless. Gov. Harvey returned to Virginia not only with his commission but with warrants for Councillors Samuel Matthews, John Utie, William Pierce, John West, and George Menefie to answer charges in England. [4]\n\nWith his fiercest opponents gone, Gov. Harvey convened a much calmer General Assembly with his modified council and the elected burgesses on February 20, 1636-7. Harvey’s reconstituted council included those more favorable to him: Secretary Richard Kemp, George Donne, Thomas Purifye (or Purfoy), Henry Browne of the Four Mile Tree property, Francis Hooke, and four newly appointed Councillors: Adam Thorowgood, William Brocas, Francis Hooke, and John Hobson. George Donne, son of the poet John Donne, wrote a lengthy defense of Harvey when he was in England. [5]\n\nThis second term of Governor Harvey was less contentious, but, unfortunately, not well documented. There is an extant letter dated February 20, 1637-38 signed by Governor Harvey, Thorowgood, Brown, and Brocas to the King supporting the request for increased income for Secretary Richard Kemp. In the Assembly which met March-April of that year, the Burgesses continued to oppose the King’s proposed tobacco policy and requested free trade. However, they and the Govenor exchanged letters this time rather than blows. Repairs were ordered for the Point Comfort Fort, and construction of the first statehouse was approved. Yet, the prior power struggle was still not over. [6]\n\nPrelude to the Fight\n\nWhat had led to the literal stand off between Harvey and his Council? John Harvey had been a successful, though temperamental, sea captain who was awarded a tract of land by the Virginia Company in 1622 for transporting persons to the Colony, and he had invested in potash production there. In 1623, Harvey was appointed by King James I to chair the royal commission consisting of John Pory, Abraham Piersey, and Samuel Matthews (all influential in Jamestown) to ascertain and report on the conditions in the Colony after the recent Powhatan Uprising. While in Virginia, the colonists were suspicious of the commission, and Harvey garnered a bad reputation from his autocratic and threatening behavior with his ship’s crew as well as Virginia planters.\n\nThe commission reported to the Privy Council that the Colony was in better shape than expected, but was sorely lacking in needed arms and munitions. However, it was severely critical of the leadership of the Virginia Company. King James decided in 1624 to revoke the charter of the Virginia Company and make the settlement a royal colony. Many colonists opposed this and were fearful it would result in confiscation and reallocation of their land as the English had done in Ireland. For his part, John Harvey was knighted and designated to be the governor in 1628 after the death of Governor George Yeardley. [7]\n\nWhile John Harvey had been an effective, if difficult, sea captain, he was poorly suited to run a “ship of state.” He did not come to Virginia as governor until 1630 when he replaced Dr. John Potts, the interim governor who was indicted for stealing cattle. Although Harvey had worked with Matthews on the commission, as governor, he soon ran afoul of the powerful coalition of councillors led by Samuel Matthews and William Claiborne. As important and wealthy tobacco planters and merchants, they had been working with influential London merchants to have the Virginia Company rechartered which Harvey opposed. Harvey’s negotiated peace with the Powhatans also displeased some councillors who wanted to take a harder stand.\n\nVirginians were also strongly opposed to the charter given Lord Baltimore for the Colony of Maryland in which they were not only given land that had earlier been part of Virginia but also allowed Catholic settlers. They were upset when Harvey recognized Maryland’s royal charter and provided assistance to their colonists. Harvey also did not support his own councillor, William Claiborne, on his claims to Kent Island in the Chesapeake Bay against Maryland. Claiborne was absent from the “thrusting out” council meeting which fortunately kept him from being indicted with the others. Then there were the infamous temper tantrums of the Governor, such as when he took offense and bashed out several teeth of council member Richard Stephens with a cudgel and then justified his action because it was done in private and not in an official meeting. Remarkably, Harvey later married Stephen’s widow. [8]\n\nCurrent historians recognize, though, that there were good projects and policies implemented during Harvey’s term which are often overlooked because of his personality and conflicts. Working together, the Assembly and Governor created the eight county shires, established local courts, completed the palisade across the Middle Penninsula to protect settlers and enclose livestock, increased production of grain, and diversified endeavors. In 1633, Virginia was able to provide for their doubling population as well as send between 5,000- 10,000 bushels of grain to New England. [9]\n\nWas It The King’s Fault?\n\nA leader bears responsibility for selecting good subordinates, and John Harvey had clearly shown that he did not have the appropriate temperament to lead the Colony. However, many Virginians would not have been satisfied even if Harvey had been pleasant, because he was dutifully supporting the king’s unpopular initiatives. When Charles I became king after his father had dissolved the Virginia Company, there was great anxiety as to what it would mean to be a royal colony which Charles did not clarify for years. During this time, King Charles asserted he could rule on his own and disbanded the English Parliament for 11 years, leaving Virginians to wonder if they would be allowed to keep their lands and representative government. It was, after all, Charles who had given Virginia land to Maryland. [10]\n\nAnother concern was how power would be balanced and decisions shared between the king, his governor, the assembly, and the local colonists. Neither the King nor Governor Harvey tolerated dissent. Even the spark that ignited the incident was of the King’s making. His proposal to create a royal monopoly over the tobacco trade united the factions of Virginia tobacco growers in opposition. To exert his royal privilege, King Charles did recommission Governor Harvey, but he did not give Harvey much support or seek to change or clarify the troubling situation in Virginia. The King insisted that Governor Harvey had to return “even if for only one day,” but delays in receiving his owed salary forced Harvey to have to borrow from those he was supposed to rule. [11]\n\nAccepting a Council Appointment\n\nThere was no position in Virginia, except governor, with more power and prestige than that of a member of the governor’s council. Councillors were appointed and could serve for life, not elected like Burgesses. They had executive powers as advisors to the Governor, legislative powers as members of the unicameral General Assembly, and judicial powers as justices of the colony’s General Court. While they were supposed to act for the welfare of all Virginians, they were sometimes known to promote their own interests and those of their wealthy friends. [12]\n\nAppointing Adam Thorowgood upon Harvey’s return in 1637 would have been a logical and wise choice. With his brother, Sir John Thorowgood of Kensington, serving in the court of Charles I and his vast land grant in Virginia coming at the recommendation of the King’s Privy Council in 1634, Adam Thorowgood had influential connections in both the Colony and England which could be helpful to Harvey. While himself a merchant-planter, Thorowgood had not closely aligned himself with the Matthews-Claiborne faction. Thorowgood supported free trade with the Dutch and diversified his land use, raising livestock as well as tobacco. However, he was not fully aligned with Harvey’s agenda. Adam was of Puritan background and likely would have opposed taking land assigned to Virginia to create the Catholic haven of Maryland. Still, he had not embroiled himself directly in the conflicts with Harvey and had served under him previously as a Burgess. Adam’s rapid rise in 15 years from an indentured servant to councillor indicates he was probably persistent, but also pragmatic.\n\nThorowgood likely added a stabilizing influence on the troubled Council. Adam would have been familiar with those on the Council, particularly his prior neighbor on the Back River, Thomas Purifye, with whom he had served as both a burgess and a justice from lower (eastern) Elizabeth City. Purifye along with Henry Browne were known to usually be supporters of Governor Harvey. This reconstituted council, though, soon had more vacancies as Purifye, Hooke, and Thorowgood all died by 1640. Adam Thorowgood did not have much opportunity to make his impact as a councillor. [13]\n\nRound 3 and The Knockout: The Dismissal of Governor Harvey\n\nGovernor Harvey probably felt justified and secure in sending his rebellious councillors to England, but it ultimately worked against him. He had alienated many people and had few friends he could count on to pursue his case there. On the other hand, Matthews, Claiborne, Potts, and others aligned with them had close relations with the wealthy and influential London tobacco merchants and those formerly connected with the Virginia Company. Rather than facing condemnation and dismissal, they managed to convince the Privy Council and King that Governor Harvey should be replaced by a former governor, Francis Wyatt.\n\nIn November 1639, Sir John Harvey was dismissed. He stayed in Virginia into 1640, but found himself “badly in debt and widely despised.” He returned to England and struggled to collect debts owed him in Virginia and England. Sir John Harvey died in poverty and disgrace in 1650. On the other hand, Samuel Matthews and the others were not convicted in England and were reinstated to their powerful places on the Council when they returned to Virginia. [14]\n\nAfter the Fight\n\nGov. Francis Wyatt was both cautious and conciliatory toward the Council in his second term. However, many Virginia governors after Harvey also experienced power struggles with their councillors. In 1694, Reverend James Blair, the commissary of the Bishop of London for Virginia, was appointed to the Council of Governor Edmund Andros. While Andros was not “thrust out” like Harvey, Blair and his faction of councillors successfully lobbied in London for his dismissal, and Andros resigned in 1699. Nor did they like Governor Nicholson who succeeded Andros, and they got Nicholson dismissed in 1705. Despite Lt. Governor Alexander Spotswood’s success in containing piracy and expanding westward, the Council under Blair also contended against him and had him unwillingly removed in 1722. Finally, Governor Dunmore and his family fled Williamsburg in the middle of the night in June 1775, ending the rule of British governors in Virginia.[15]\n\nGovernor Harvey’s difficulty with governing did not happen in isolation. In the following decade, England itself was engulfed in Civil War over the power struggle between Parliament and King. Ultimately, King Charles I was not only “thrust out,” but beheaded. While the ousting of Governor Harvey was not a populist movement like the later Bacon’s Rebellion in 1676, it was clear and early evidence of the developing desire of the English colonists for self-determination and participatory rule.[16]\n\nNext Post: The Death Of Adam Thorowgood\n\nFootnotes:\n\n[1] Billings, Warren M., The Old Dominion in the Seventeenth Century (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2007), 314-318.

Most coming to Virginia were not wanting to break with their Mother Country, but rather to expand their own opportunities in an undeveloped land under the same governing rules. Seventeenth-century England had a well established court system and extensive English Common Law precedents. But how would these fit with the new circumstances of colonial life?\n\nRemarkably, the records of the Lower Norfolk County Court have survived for 384 years despite the area’s humid climate, poor storage conditions, wars, and fires. Many of Virginia’s county court records that had survived to the 1860s were sent to its capital during the Civil War for “safe keeping,” but were unfortunately lost in the burning of Richmond. However, according to tradition, “a level-headed clerk” of Princess Anne County (as the county was then called) “loaded his precious record books into a covered wagon and drove off into the Dismal Swamp, not to reappear until the fighting was safely over.” [1] Wherever those records were kept, they fortunately survived along with those of a few other Virginia counties. As the Lower Norfolk Court began meeting in 1637, its records are among the oldest of the Virginia courts and provide an invaluable window into the dilemmas of early colonial life.\n\nLower Norfolk County’s First Court Case\n\n“At court holden in the Lower County of New Norfolke the 15th of Mae, 1637,” Capt. Adam Thorowgood, Esq. presided over the first of its courts in his home with the following appointed justices: Capt. John Sibsey, Edward Windham, William Julian, Francis Mason, and Robert Came. [2] This was not Adam’s first time sitting on a court, although neither he nor any of the other justices had had any legal training. On March 20, 1628, Adam Thorowgood had first been appointed a commissioner of Elizabeth City’s monthly court by Gov. Francis West and was authorized to hold court in his home, as was customary in those early years. [3] A justice was a lifetime appointment, but one for which there was no payment. Adam served until his death in 1640, presiding for 12 of Lower Norfolk’s first 13 sessions.\n\nThe first case of the first court was actually brought by Adam Thorowgood against a woman, Ann Fowler. Thorowgood’s servants had found and marked a lost cask by the seaside which William Fowler later came upon and took to his house. It was not the taking of the cask which was at issue, but Mistress Fowler’s responses when Adam’s servants came to claim it. Mistress Fowler was brought to court because, when told the cask would be returned to Capt. Thorowgood, she declared, “Let Capt. Thorowgood Kiss my arse.” She also called the agent of Thorowgood, Thomas Keeling, a “Jacknape, Newgate rogue, and brigand” and threatened if he did not leave, “she would break his head.” When this was confirmed by other witnesses, the court found that Anne Fowler did “in a shameful, uncomely and irreverent manner…with aggravation of many unusual terms” disrespect Adam Thorowgood and in a “shameful and reproachful manner…with abusive names and promiscuous speeches” defame Thomas Keeling. She was sentenced to 20 stripes on her bare shoulders and required to ask forgiveness of Adam Thorowgood and Thomas Keeling at the court that day and at Church on Sunday, both of which were held at the Thorowgood house. [4]\n\nWhat kind of a court was this that could demand both physical punishment and contrition in church? What basis did they have for their decisions? How could justice be done with such conflicts of interest?\n\nEstablishing County Courts in Virginia\n\nIn the transformational year 1619 when Virginia became the first English colony with representational government, it was proclaimed that colonists would "
