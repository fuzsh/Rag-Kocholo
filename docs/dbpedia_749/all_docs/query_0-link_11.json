London: John and Edward Bumpus, 1906. xii+169pp.\n\nAnonymous account of a journey undertaken during a summer sometime in the 1890s. In a breezy narrative the English author describes his journey by train from Warsaw to Odessa and his travels with a Russian companion through the Crimean peninsula and along the Black Sea coast. They take the train through Georgia to Tiflis and proceed by horse into Persian territory. The text is enlivened with illustrations by Ambrose Dudley from sketches by the author (pp. 1-105).\n\nBishop, Isabella Lucy Bird, Korea and her neighbors: a narrative of travel, with an account of the recent vicissitudes and present position of the country. With a preface by Sir Walter C. Hillier. London: John Murray, 1898. 2 vols.\n\nThe author of four books of travel under her maiden name of Bird by the time of her marriage to Dr John Bishop (d. 1886) in 1881, Isabella (1831-1904), in 1892 the first woman to be elected F.R.G.S., was in Vladivostok from early November to 10 December 1894 between visits to Korea. In Vladivostok she became close friends with Eleanor Pray (see J138). Bishop visited Korean settlements in Siberia and journeyed along the Trans-Siberian railway as far as Ussuri (vol. I, pp. 213-41).\n\nHarris, Walter Burton, From Batum to Baghdad via Tiflis, Tabriz, and Persian Kurdistan. Edinburgh and London: William Blackwood and Sons, 1896. xii+335pp.\n\nHarris (1866-1933), F.R.G.S., Times correspondent and Moroccan specialist, who had been in Archangel some years earlier, sailed from Constantinople for Batumi in April 1895 and went by train first to Tiflis and then by carriage to Erevan, and on into Persia, without incident or much of note (pp. 25-84).\n\nMuir, Hal Moncreiff, A tour in Russia. Leith: printed for the author by Mackenzie and Storrie, 1898. 76pp.\n\nA “humble account of travel” by an Edinburgh Scot, author of similar efforts for Switzerland and the Pyrenees, who sailed with three friends from Grangemouth to Cronstadt “several years ago”, presumably c.1895. A conventional description of the sights of Petersburg and its environs and of an excursion to Moscow suddenly changes tack and is followed by a string of “stories” illustrating Russian religious, social and village life (pp. 26-70).\n\nPerris, George Herbert, Russia in revolution. London: Chapman & Hall, 1905. xvi+359pp.\n\nOffered as “a review of the last thirty-five years of Russian public life” and making copious use of printed sources and the active contribution of many Russian revolutionaries in exile, this account, dated 15 April 1905 and thus published before the tragic end of that year, is suffused with Perris’s own memories from numerous visits to Russia during the first decade of Nicholas’s reign. Perris (1866-1920), who had published Leo Tolstoy, the grand mujik (1898), contributed articles while in Russia to various papers including the Daily Chronicle.\n\nDillon, Emile Joseph, The eclipse of Russia. London & Toronto: J.M. Dent and Sons, 1918. viii+420pp.\n\nDedicated to the Russian premier Count Witte for whom Dillon had worked as private adviser from 1903 to 1914, this work, representing Dillon’s bleak view of Russia under Nicholas II, also includes a chapter entitled ‘Some personal recollections’ (pp. 61-82). (See also I157 and, under pseudonym of Lanin, J89.)\n\nHodgetts, Edward Arthur Brayley, Round about Armenia: the record of a journey across the Balkans through Turkey, the Caucasus and Persia, in 1895. London: Sampson Low, Marston & Co., 1896. xii+296pp.\n\nHodgetts (see I79, J113) was later to call this trip on behalf of the Daily Graphic to report on the Turkish massacres of Armenians “the most interesting of the many journeys I had ever undertaken”. It took him to Tiflis and Baku and into both Russian and Turkish Armenia.\n\nJefferson, Robert Louis, Awheel to Moscow and back: the record of a record cycle ride. With a preface by A.R. Savile. London: Sampson Low, Marston & Co., 1895. xii+172pp.\n\nCycling enthusiast Jefferson’s first venture into Russia, making a round trip from Warsaw to Moscow in fifty days in April-June 1895 (pp. 61-159). (See also K30, K48.)\n\nPearson, Henry John, “Beyond Petsora eastwards”: two summer voyages to Novaya Zemlya and the islands of the Barents Sea. With appendices on the botany and geology by Col. H.W. Feilden. London: R.H. Porter, 1899. xiv+335pp.\n\nThe Nottingham foundry-owner and dedicated ornithologist (1850-1913), together with his brother Charles, the Rev. Slater, and Col. Feilden, sailed on a small steamer, the Saxon, to Russian Lapland and the islands of Kolguev and Novaia Zemlia in the summer of 1895, recording and collecting birds and their eggs. In 1897, on a larger steamer, the Laura, he and Feilden went as far as the Kara Sea. Their observations were first published in Ibis in 1896 and 1897.\n\nDemidov, Elim Pavlovich, Hunting trips in the Caucasus. London: Rowland Ward, 1898. xvi+319pp.\n\nThe immensely rich Demidov (1868-1943), 3rd Prince of San Donato, born in Vienna and dying in Athens, provided a “faithful account of three shooting trips to three different parts of the Caucasus”. The first took him to the Kuban in the autumn of 1895; the second along the Russo-Persian border in the summer of 1896; the third, again to the Kuban, in the autumn of 1896. The last two accounts were in fact written by Dr H.D. Levick, who accompanied Demidov. The book was dedicated to St. George Littledale, who was also on the third expedition and who had shot in the Caucasus several times in earlier years. (For further expeditions, see K31 and K69).\n\nPatterson, John Edward, My vagabondage, being the intimate autobiography of a nature’s nomad. London: William Heinemann, 1911. xix+373pp.\n\nPatterson (1866-1919), Yorkshire-born merchant seaman and later novelist, recounts his adventures at sea, including disastrous shore-leave in St Petersburg at the end of the nineteenth century (pp. 252-66).\n\nKenworthy, John Coleman, A pilgrimage to Tolstoy: being letters written from Russia, to the ‘New Age’, January 1896. Croydon: Brotherhood Publishing Co., 1896. 45pp.\n\nKenworthy (1863-1946), leader of the Croydon Brotherhood Church, came under the spell of Tolstoi’s writings in 1890 and soon thereafter began a correspondence that led to his visit to Moscow at the end of 1895 and early 1896. In between his meetings with Tolstoi he paid a visit to Kostroma to see the “real” Russia of the countryside.\n\nPalmer, Francis H.E., Russian life in town & country. London: George Newnes, 1901. xii+271pp.\n\nBased on a residence of several years in Russia (the author mentions incidents in 1895 and 1900), Palmer’s contribution to the Newnes’s ‘Our neighbours’ series is a detailed, informed and sympathetic account of the social and domestic life of the Russians in town and village.\n\nJoubert, Carl, Russia as it really is. London: Eveleigh Nash, 1904. xii+300pp.\n\nJoubert (d. 1906), an Englishman of Huguenot descent, who claimed to have visited as a tramp (brodiaga) almost every part of Russia including Sakhalin during nine years from c.1881, travelled there several times thereafter. It is a journey in 1896 that he recalls in particular in this first of three books he wrote in the space of eighteen months, condemning tyranny, the penal system, and anti-semitism, and sensing revolution.\n\nOlufsen, Axel Frits Olaf Henrik, Through the unknown Pamirs: the second Danish Pamir expedition 1898-99. London: William Heinemann, 1904. xxii+238pp.\n\nLt. Olufsen (1865-1929) of the Danish army led two expeditions to the Pamirs in the 1890s. The first left Copenhagen on 25 March 1896 and returned on 1 March of the following year, travelling from St Petersburg via Georgia to Baku, across the Caspian, and by the Transcaspian railway to Samarkand, thereafter by tarantas and horse into the Pamirs. This journey was seen as essentially one of reconnoitring for the second expedition that lasted from 23 March 1898 to 22 November 1899. It was this second expedition, following the same outward route as far as Osh and then proceeding deep into south Pamir that produced the material for the book.\n\nOlufsen, Axel Frits Olaf Henrik, The emir of Bokhara and his country: journeys and studies in Bokhara (with a chapter on my voyage on the Amu Darya to Khiva). London: William Heinemann, 1911. xii+599pp.\n\nIn a complementary volume to his 1904 work, Olufsen, now retired from the army, a professor and secretary to the Royal Danish Geographical Society, concentrates on a comprehensive study of Bokhara, both before and after it became a vassal state of Russia. Both Danish expeditions spent extended stays as guests of the emir in Bokhara.\n\nBigham, Clive, A ride through Western Asia. London: Macmillan and Co., 1897. xii+284pp.\n\nAnxious to get to Armenia, Bigham left England on 22 June 1895 by what seemed, given the political situation, the most difficult route via Constantinople. He traversed Persia and eventually entered Russian territory on 20 April 1896. He travelled through Russian Turkestan and visited Bokhara and Samarkand, briefly entered China, and then across the steppe to Omsk and homewards by the Trans-Siberian to St Petersburg, which he reached on 26 June. He calculated that he had travelled in Asia over 8,000 miles, half of which were on horseback (pp. 205-69).\n\nGordon, Samuel, A handful of exotics: scenes and incidents, chiefly of Russo-Jewish life. London: Methuen & Co., 1897. x+297pp.\n\nIn his preface, dated September 1896, Gordon offers, as an amateur ethnographer, a series of “light sketches endeavour[ing] to depict the Russian Jew in his native surroundings”. Two of the ten tales are devoted to non-Jewish subjects, “illustrating the environments in which the Russian Jew moves”.\n\nMalcolm, Ian Zachary, Trodden ways 1895-1930. London: Macmillan and Co., 1930. xii+288pp.\n\nSir Ian (1868-1944), 17th chieftain of the clan Malcolm and a M.P., was attached to the British embassy for three weeks at the time of the coronation of Nicholas II in May 1896 and he records his impressions in an essay entitled ‘The last coronation’ (pp. 44-68). In 1916 he returned to Russia as British Red Cross commissioner, mainly in Petrograd but also visiting Kiev. He includes a description of his audience with the tsar at Tsarskoe selo (pp. 69-92).\n\nLogan, John Alexander, Jr., In joyful Russia. London: C. Arthur Pearson, 1897. x+275pp.\n\nThe American army officer Logan (1865-99) records “a thoroughly delightful” trip and defends his “rose-coloured” view of a country “in holiday attire” for the coronation of Nicholas II in Moscow on 26 May 1896. He even plays down the tragedy at the festival at Khodynskoe pole on 30 May for “it is not best to let the unthinking brood too deeply over the irretrievable” and what happened only underlined the “sympathy” between the people and the throne. Logan, his mother, and his friend G left Moscow for St Petersburg on 7 June, where they enjoyed further delights before “departing the land of the Great White Tsar with regret”.\n\nGrenfell, Francis Wallace, Three weeks in Moscow. London: for the author by Harrison and Sons, 1896. iv+152pp.\n\nLt-General Sir Francis (1841-1925), afterwards 1st Baron Grenfell, was in the suite accompanying the Duke and Duchess of Connaught to attend the coronation of Nicholas II. In a series of letters to E. (Evelyn, his first wife), he describes their departure from Sheerness on 11 May on board the Victoria and Albert and arrival a week later at the English Embankment in St Petersburg, proceeding to Moscow by train. Five days after the coronation he was also present at the public festival at Khodynskoe pole and reports on the tragedy that ensued. They sailed from St Petersburg on 9 June (pp. 10-116).\n\nGrenfell, Francis Wallace, Memoirs of Field Marshall Lord Grenfell. London: Hodder & Stoughton, 1925. xv+236pp.\n\nGrenfell recalls his visit in 1896 (pp. 127-42).\n\nCreighton, Mandell, Life and letters. By his wife [Louise Creighton]. London: Longmans, Green, & Co., 1904. 2 vols.\n\nCreighton (1843-1901), Bishop of Peterborough, represented the Anglican church at the coronation, travelling with W.J. Birkbeck, the acknowledged British authority on the Russian church. He describes his visit in letters to his wife and in a notebook, detailing his meetings with, among others, the patriarch and Pobedonostsev (vol. II, pp. 148-64).\n\nSykes, Arthur Alkin, The coronation cruise of the ‘Midnight Sun’ to Russia, Whitsuntide, 1896: a record. London: for the author, 1896. 118pp.\n\nSykes (1861-1939), contributor to Punch and translator of Gogol’s Revizor, joined a three-week tour (11 May-6 June) of five northern capitals that was designed to coincide with Nicholas II’s coronation. Grenfell (see K20) mentions the “cheering” British tourists (168 in fact) on board the Midnight Sun, who made their way to Moscow for the great event but left before the tragedy of Khodynka (pp. 49-82).\n\nDavis, Richard Harding, A year from a correspondent’s note-book. New York and London: Harper & Brothers, 1898. x+305pp.\n\nJournalist, novelist, playwright, and F.R.G.S., Davis (1864-1916), later renowned for his war reporting, describes his visit to Russia for the coronation in May 1896 in an article previously published in Harper’s Magazine, but makes no mention of the Khodynka tragedy (pp. 3-65).\n\n[Maude, Aylmer], The tsar’s coronation as seen by “De Monte Alto” resident in Moscow. London and Croydon: Brotherhood Publishing Co., 1896. 128pp.\n\nA healthy counterblast to accounts that “present nothing but the conventional, superficial laudations of a spectacle which enlightened conscience and sober reason must see in a wholly different light”. Maude (see J86), the “resident” concealing his identity, follows the preparations for the event , the pageant itself, and in graphic detail the “catastrophe” at Khodynka on 18 May 1896, before penning an epilogue, suffused with the teachings of Tolstoi and railing against the perils of ultra-patriotism that affects equally the British.\n\nAddams, Jane, Twenty years at Hull-House, with autobiographical notes. New York: Macmillan, 1910. 462pp.\n\nSocial activist, founder of the U.S. Settlement House movement and recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize, Addams (1860-1935) travelled with wealthy debutante Mary Rozet Smith to Russia in July 1896. Addams was yet another enthusiast for Tolstoi’s social writings, but her meeting with him proved awkward and confrontational (pp. 266-74).\n\nSimpson, James Young, Side-lights on Siberia: some account of the great Siberian railroad, the prisons and the exile system. Edinburgh and London: William Blackwood and Sons, 1898. xvi+383pp.\n\nA journey undertaken in the summer of 1896 that took Simpson (1873-1934), who had recently graduated from Edinburgh University, along the Trans-Siberian. Offering not so much a travelogue as an investigation into the potential of Siberia and much about the penal system, Simpson sought “the truth” mid-point between the views of Kennan and De Windt, but predicted that revolution was inevitable.\n\nMavor, Sam, Memories of people and places. London, Edinburgh and Glasgow: William Hodge and Co., 1940. iv+327pp.\n\nRussia played a large role in the life of the electrical engineer and industrialist, whose memoirs, gathered together when he was seventy six, comprise mainly articles he had written at various times for his firm’s Apprentices magazine. Mavor (b. 1863) first went to Russia in the summer of 1896 to inspect the installation of electric lighting at the Thornton woollen mills in St Petersburg (pp. 5-9). He also describes a momentous journey to deliver a Tyne-built steamer from Newcastle to St Petersburg and then by the waterways to Astrakhan (pp. 163-86). In 1899 he made a pilgrimage to Solovetsk from Norway (pp. 187-213). His final visit to St Petersburg was in 1912.\n\nFraser, John Foster, Round the world on a wheel: being the narrative of a bicycle ride of nineteen thousand two hundred and thirty-seven miles through seventeen countries and across three continents, by John Foster Fraser, S. Edward Lunn, and F.H. Lowe. London: Methuen, 1899. xii+532pp.\n\nCycling trip by three friends across the world that began on 17 July 1896 and took 774 days was chronicled by Sir John (1868-1936). They entered Russia from Romania in the autumn en route for Odessa and thereafter cycled through the Crimea to the Caucasus and through Georgia to Erevan. Passing Ararat, they left Armenia and entered Persia (pp. 28-90). (See also K88, K90, K301)\n\nJefferson, Robert Louis, Roughing it in Siberia; with some account of the Trans-Siberian railway, and the gold-mining industry of Asiatic Russia. London: Sampson Low, Marston & Co., 1897. 252pp.\n\nForsaking for once his bike for the railway, Jefferson (see K7) accompanies three business associates from Moscow to Krasnoiarsk, the then terminus of the railway, and then down the Enisei in January-April 1897. Visited gold-mines, interviewed owners and miners, gathered samples of ore.\n\nDemidov, Elim Pavlovich, After wild sheep in the Altai and Mongolia. London: Rowland Ward, 1900. xii+324pp.\n\nDemidov (see K9) travelled with his wife and the great travellers St. George Littledale (1851-1931) and his wife Teresa (1839-1928) from London in April 1897 to shoot the wild sheep (ovis ammon), and much else.\n\nGillis, Charles J., A summer vacation in Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Russia. New York: Printed for private distribution, 1898. 55pp.\n\nSeasoned traveller and author of a number of privately printed travel accounts, Gillis joined a party sailing from New York on 26 June 1897 for Scandinavia and Russia.

New York: D. Appleton and Co., 1898. iv+146pp.\n\nA three-month round trip from New York in the summer of 1897 that takes the American tourists Dana (1819-97) and his wife first to Odessa by boat from Marseilles and then on to Batumi, through Georgia to Rostov and the railway link to Nizhnii and Moscow (pp. 17-101).\n\nSymons, Arthur William, Cities. London: J.M. Dent & Co., 1903. xii+261pp.\n\nIn this collection of essays, printed previously in journals, the prolific literary scholar and author Symons (1865-1945) included ‘Moscow’, which he visited in the hot summer of 1897 and which he “hated”, as much as Naples, in contrast to St Petersburg, which had “nothing to say” to him (pp. 155-85).\n\nRidley, James Cartmell, Reminiscences of Russia: the Ural mountains and adjoining Siberian district in 1897. Newcastle-upon-Tyne: A. Reid & Co., 1898. 100pp.\n\nPrior to attending the International Geological Congress, held in St Petersburg in August 1897, Ridley and another unnamed delegate from Newcastle embarked on a long journey that took them by train via Warsaw to Moscow, where they arrived on 27 July. They then travelled by various forms of transport via Samara as far as Ekaterinburg and looped back to Moscow via Perm and Kazan, before proceeding to the capital for the conference. Highly impressed by “a great country”, they sailed for home on 6 September.\n\nHayes, Matthew Horace, Among horses in Russia. London: R.A. Everett & Co., 1900. xiv+214pp.\n\nCapt Hayes, a leading authority and author on all things equine, paid four visits to Russia. The first in July-September 1897, at the invitation of the imperial guards stationed at Krasnoe selo outside St Petersburg, was quickly followed by a second in October with further horses and a visit to an imperial stud at Dubrovka in Ukraine. Two further visits followed in March and August 1898, during the second of which he was later joined by his wife, a formidable horsewoman. Much valuable information on the famous Orlov stud and Russian horse-breeding.\n\nHoneyman, Abraham Van Doren, and Mason, Abbie Ranlett, From America to Russia in summer of 1897. Edited by A.V.D. Honeyman. Plainfield, New Jersey: Honeyman & Co., 1897. 167pp.\n\nTwo chapters in this third collection of travel accounts by members of Honeyman tourist groups from New York and New Jersey are devoted to their visit to Russia in early August 1897: Mason describes their arrival in St Petersburg from Finland, their tour of the city sights, and a visit to the military review at Krasnoe selo (pp. 88-97); Honeyman (1849-1936) recounts the party’s less enjoyable trip to Moscow, where they note the greater level of poverty and social disorder compared to St Petersburg (pp. 98-114).\n\nMiles, Nelson Appleton, Military Europe: a narrative of personal observation and personal experience. New York: Doubleday & McClure Co., 1898. x+112pp.\n\nU.S. major-general (1839-1925), veteran of the Civil War and Indian wars, arrived in Russia on 15 August 1897, was received by the tsar at Peterhof, and observed the annual manoeuvres of the Russian army at Krasnoe selo, before proceeding to Germany and France (pp. 73-94).\n\nRenshaw, Charles Jeremiah, Travels in Russia. London: National Union Publishing Co., 1900. 32pp.\n\nDr Renshaw of Ashton-on-Mersey travelled by train to Moscow with a party of thirty men and ten women to attend the 12th International Medical Congress in August 1897. He briefly describes their outward journey, their stay in Moscow, their visit to Petersburg and homewards via Finland.\n\nKerr, John, Leaves from an inspector’s notebook. London: Thomas Nelson & Sons, [1913]. 278pp.\n\nKerr (1830-1916), senior chief inspector of schools in Scotland, travelled to St Petersburg via Sweden and Finland en route for Moscow, where he also attended the Medical Congress that opened on 19 August in the Bolshoi theatre.

Andrew D. White. New York: The Century Co., 1899. xvi+398pp.\n\nIn part II of his book in which he details his experiences with tramps in various parts of the world, Flint (b. 1850) includes ‘With the Russian goriouns [unfortunates]’, describing his visit to Russia in 1897, when he not only went to see Tolstoi but also “tramped” for some days in Vitebsk district (pp. 200-28).\n\nPerowne, John Thomas Woolrych, Russian hosts and English guests in Central Asia. London: The Scientific Press, 1898. xvi+198pp.\n\nPerowne, Cambridge graduate and translator from French and German, does “nothing more than describe a journey, made in November and December last, over the Transcaspian Military Railway”. One of a party of twenty-five English who left Constantinople on 6 November 1897, Perowne, styling himself “something of a Russophil”, charts their progress to Batumi and on to Tiflis and Baku, where they take the steamer to Krasnovodsk. There they board the Transcaspian railway for a three-week journey to Samarkand with various stops en route, including a reception by Kuropatkin, the governor-general, on their return to Ashabad.\n\nPhibbs, Isabelle Mary, A visit to the Russians in Central Asia. London: Kegan Paul, Trench, Trübner & Co., Ltd., 1899. viii+238pp.\n\nTravel writer in the same party as Perowne, although neither names the other, offers her account of the “marvellously interesting journey”, which for her was marred only by a bout of influenza that made the return by train “almost entirely a blank”.\n\nLoch, Emily, The memoirs of Emily Loch: discretion in waiting, Tsarina Alexandra and the Christian family. Edited by Judith Poore. Kinloss: Librario, 2007. 394pp.\n\nEmily (d. 1932), lady-in-waiting to Helena, Princess Christian, accompanied Princess Helena, Princess Christian’s eldest daughter, on visit to the Russian imperial family during the winter of 1897-98 (pp. 183-252).\n\nCobbold, Ralph Patteson, Innermost Asia: travel & sport in the Pamirs. London: William Heinemann, 1900. xviii+354pp.\n\nWith the modest aim of making his book “the standard work of reference on its subject”, Cobbold charts his travels and hunting through the Pamirs in 1897-98. Coming from the Chinese side, he crossed the Russian border at the beginning of January 1898 and travelled to lake Balkash, where he shot his first tiger. He returned to Kashgar before receiving permission to travel in the Russian Pamirs. At one stage detained as a spy, Cobbold is ultimately glad to make his way to “freedom” in British Kashmir (pp. 92-210).\n\nSalter, John Henry, Dr Salter of Tolleshunt D’Arcy in the county of Essex, medical man, freemason, sportsman, sporting-dog breeder and horticulturalist.
