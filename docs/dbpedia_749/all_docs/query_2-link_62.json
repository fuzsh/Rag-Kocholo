        "text": "American actor (1919-1973)\n\nAlexander Crichlow Barker Jr. (May 8, 1919 – May 11, 1973), known as Lex Barker, was an American actor. He was known for playing Tarzan for RKO Pictures between 1949 and 1953, and portraying leading characters from Karl May's novels,[1] notably as Old Shatterhand in a film series by the West German studio Constantin Film. At the height of his fame, he was one of the most popular actors in German-speaking cinema, and received Bambi Award and Bravo Otto nominations for the honor.\n\nEarly life\n\n[edit]\n\nBarker was born in Rye, New York, the second child of Alexander Crichlow Barker Sr., a wealthy Canadian-born building contractor and stockbroker,[2] and his American wife, the former Marion Thornton Beals.[3] He had an elder sister, Frederica Amelia \"Freddie\" Barlow (1917–1980). Of English and Spanish ancestry, Barker was a direct descendant of the founder of Rhode Island, Roger Williams, and of Sir William Henry Crichlow, historical governor-general of Barbados.[4][5]\n\nRaised in New York City and Port Chester, New York, he attended the Fessenden School and graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy. He played American football and the oboe. He attended Princeton University, but dropped out to join a theatrical stock company, much to his family's chagrin.[6]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nTheatre\n\n[edit]\n\nBarker made it to Broadway once, in a small role in a short run of Shakespeare's The Merry Wives of Windsor in 1938.[7] He also had a small role in Orson Welles's disastrous Five Kings, which met with so many problems in Boston and Philadelphia that it never made it into New York City.[8]\n\nWorld War II\n\n[edit]\n\nIn February 1941, 10 months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Barker left his fledgling acting career and enlisted in the U.S. Army. He rose to the rank of major during the war.[9] He was wounded in action (in the head and leg) fighting in Sicily.[10] He was awarded the Purple Heart twice.\n\nEarly film roles\n\n[edit]\n\nBack in the US, he recuperated at a military hospital in Arkansas, then upon his discharge from service, traveled to Los Angeles. Within a short time, he landed a small role in Doll Face (1945), his first film.\n\nA string of small roles followed, in films such as Two Guys from Milwaukee (1945) and Cloak and Dagger (1946).\n\nRKO\n\n[edit]\n\nBarker signed a contract at RKO. He had small roles in The Farmer's Daughter (1947), Crossfire (1947), and Under the Tonto Rim (1947).\n\nBarker went to Paramount for Unconquered (1947). Back at RKO he was in Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome (1947), Berlin Express (1948), Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House (1948), The Velvet Touch (1948), and Return of the Bad Men (1948), playing Emmett Dalton.\n\nTarzan\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Tarzan's Magic Fountain (1949), Barker became the tenth official Tarzan of the movies. His blond, handsome, and intelligent appearance, as well as his athletic 6'4\" frame, helped make him popular in the role Johnny Weissmuller had made his own for 16 years. His Jane was Brenda Joyce who had been in Weissmuller's last three films.[12]\n\nBarker's second Tarzan was Tarzan and the Slave Girl (1950), where Jane was played by Vanessa Brown. In Tarzan's Peril (1951), Barker's Jane was Virginia Huston, with African location footage. Dorothy Hart was Jane in Tarzan's Savage Fury (1952), directed by Cy Endfield.\n\nBarker got the chance to play a non-Tarzan role in Battles of Chief Pontiac (1952), a Western.[15] He returned to the role one last time in Tarzan and the She-Devil (1953).\n\nWesterns\n\n[edit]\n\nBarker supported Randolph Scott in Thunder Over the Plains (1953).[16]\n\nAt Universal he starred in the Western The Yellow Mountain (1954) and The Man from Bitter Ridge (1955). He went to Columbia to make Duel on the Mississippi (1955).\n\nBarker had a rare non-Western role in The Price of Fear (1956), a film noir with Merle Oberon. He was in the war movie Away All Boats (1956) and the thriller The Girl in the Kremlin (1957).[17]\n\nBarker made two films for Howard W. Koch: War Drums (1957) and Jungle Heat (1957),. He went to 20th Century Fox for The Deerslayer (1957), then did The Girl in Black Stockings (1957).[19]\n\nItaly\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 1957, as he found it harder to find work in American films[why?], Barker moved to Europe (he spoke French, Italian, Spanish, and some German), where he found popularity and starred in over 40 European films, including two movies based on the novels by Italian author Emilio Salgari (1862–1911).\n\nHe started his European career with a British thriller The Strange Awakening (1958). He went to Italy to star in Captain Falcon (1959), Son of the Red Corsair (1959), The Pirate and the Slave Girl (1959), and Terror of the Red Mask (1960).\n\nBarker had a short but compelling role as Anita Ekberg's fiancé in Federico Fellini's La Dolce Vita (1960).[23]\n\nHe went back to swashbucklers: Knight of 100 Faces (1960), Pirates of the Coast (1960), Robin Hood and the Pirates (1960), and The Secret of the Black Falcon (1961).\n\nWest Germany\n\n[edit]\n\nBarker had his greatest success in West Germany. There he starred in movies based on the \"Doctor Mabuse\" stories (formerly filmed by Fritz Lang), in the movies The Return of Doctor Mabuse (1961). He was in Doctor Sibelius (1962).\n\nBarker then played Old Shatterhand in an adaptation of the novel by popular German author Karl May (1842–1912), Treasure of the Silver Lake (1962).[25] It was a huge hit, and 11 movies adapting stories by Karl May followed until 1968.[26] Barker did the comedy Breakfast in Bed (1962), then the adventure movie Storm Over Ceylon (1963). He returned to Italy for The Executioner of Venice (1963)[28] and Kali Yug: Goddess of Vengeance (1963).\n\nBarker reprised his role as Old Shatterhand in Apache Gold (1964), Old Shatterhand (1964) and Last of the Renegades (1965). He went to South Africa for Harry Alan Towers' West German-British international co-production Victim Five (1964), then returned to West Germany for other adaptations of May books: The Treasure of the Aztecs (1965), The Pyramid of the Sun God (1965) . 24 Hours to Kill (1965) was a British movie. The Hell of Manitoba (1965) and The Desperado Trail (1966) were Westerns.\n\nThough Barker did speak German, he was almost always dubbed in his West German films. His go-to dubber was Gert Günther Hoffmann, whose distinctive voice contributed to Barker's success.\n\nIn 1966, Barker was awarded the \"Bambi Award\" as Best Foreign Actor in West Germany, where he was a very popular star.[32] He even recorded two songs in German: \"Ich bin morgen auf dem Weg zu dir\" (\"I'll be on the way to you tomorrow\", composed by Martin Böttcher, the composer of some of the soundtracks of the Karl May movies) and \"Mädchen in Samt und Seide\" (\"Girl in Silk and Velvet\", composed by Werner Scharfenberger).[33]\n\nLater films included Killer's Carnival (1966), and Winnetou and the Crossbreed (1967). In the same year, he starred in a Eurospy film Spy Today, Die Tomorrow, a horror film The Blood Demon, and appeared in the anthology film Woman Times Seven (1967).\n\nHe returned to the United States occasionally and made a handful of guest appearances on American television episodes, but Europe, and especially West Germany, was his professional home for the remainder of his life.\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nBarker was married five times:\n\nConstance Rhodes Thurlow (1918–1975) (married June 27, 1942–divorced 1950), a daughter of Leon Rhodes Thurlow, a vice president of the Decorated Metal Manufacturing Company.[35] They had one daughter, Lynn Thurlow Barker (April 11, 1943 – 2010) and a son, Alexander \"Zan\" Crichlow Barker III (March 25, 1947 – October 2, 2012). In 1952 Constance Barker married her second husband, John Lawrence Adams, a descendant of John Quincy Adams.[35]\n\nActress Arlene Dahl (married 1951–divorced 1952)\n\nActress Lana Turner (married September 8, 1953–divorced July 22, 1957). Turner's daughter Cheryl Crane later accused Barker of having repeatedly raped her when she was between the ages of 10 ½ and 13.[36][37] and that this was the reason for the breakup of the marriage. According to Crane, to avoid public scandal, no charges were ever filed.\n\nIrene Labhardt (married 1957–1962; her death from leukemia), a Swiss actress. They had one son, Christopher (born 1960), who became an actor and singer.\n\nTita Cervera (married 1965–divorced 1972, although divorce not deemed legally valid), a Spanish beauty pageant winner. Voted Miss Spain in 1962, she later became the wife of movie producer Espartaco Santoni in 1975 (the marriage turned out to be bigamous) and later still, in 1985, the fifth and final wife of billionaire art collector Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza.[38]\n\nDeath\n\n[edit]\n\nBarker died on May 11, 1973, of a heart attack, three days after his 54th birthday, while walking down Lexington Avenue on New York City's Upper East Side, to meet his fiancée, actress Karen Kondazian.[39] The funeral was held in New York. He was cremated and the ashes were taken by his estranged wife Tita to Spain.\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1945 Doll Face Coast Guardsman Uncredited 1946 Do You Love Me Party Guest Two Guys from Milwaukee Fred Cloak and Dagger Rescued Man 1947 Olaf Holstrom Crossfire Harry Under the Tonto Rim Deputy Joe Unconquered Royal American Officer Uncredited Dick Tracy Meets Gruesome Ambulance Driver 1948 Berlin Express Soldier Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House Carpenter Foreman Paul Banton Return of the Badmen Emmett Dalton 1949 Tarzan's Magic Fountain Tarzan 1950 Tarzan and the Slave Girl 1951 Tarzan's Peril 1952 Tarzan's Savage Fury Battles of Chief Pontiac Lt.
