London: Chapman and Hall, 1854. xii+195pp.\n\nAfter taking part in the bombardment of Odessa, HMS Tiger ran aground on 12 May 1854 and Royer and other officers and crew were captured by the Russians. Royer’s account, however, is highly sympathetic to his “captors” in Odessa and elsewhere during his journey through Ukraine to Moscow and, by rail, to St Petersburg, where he was received by the tsar at Peterhof and freed to return to England at the end of June 1854. More of a tourist’s guide than a war journal, it was published in September 1854 and went into six editions by the end of the year.\n\n[Barker, William Burckhardt], Odessa and its inhabitants.

Tiger, which sailed to the Crimea in 1854 and took part in the bombardment of Odessa. Barker was among those subsequently captured. His book is thereafter essentially a very sympathetic account of the few weeks he spent in “captivity”, befriended by the Potocki family and enjoying the social life of Odessa. He also published under his own name A short historical account of the Crimea, from the earliest ages and during the Russian occupation, compiled from the best authorities (1855).\n\nMontagu, Victor Alexander, A middy’s recollections, 1853-60.

A first section describes his service with the Baltic Fleet in 1854, remaining in the Baltic Sea until October (pp. 26-32). He re-enters the war in early 1855, when he sailed to Balaklava. Though he largely remained at sea, he made excursions to the battle sites of Balaklava and Inkerman. He details his average day as a midshipman, his involvement in the capture of Kerch on 25 May 1855 and of the successful assault on Kinburn on 17 October 1855. He sailed for home in late October 1855 (pp. 39-76).\n\nMontagu, Victor Alexander, Reminiscences of Admiral Montagu.

Commanding the paddle steamer HMS Lightning, he conducted many invaluable surveys of the shallow waters around the islands, leading to successful actions against fortresses, before he returned to England in the autumn of 1855.

His detailed letters (beginning on 21 February 1854) and journal (from 21 February 1855) range wide over military, legal, logistical, and social matters (until 23 March 1856). The first of two appendices includes the proceedings of the Court of Inquiry, held on 9 November 1854, into the maltreatment of Russian prisoners following the battle of Inkerman, with related correspondence (9 November 1854 to 21 June 1855).

Dr Stothert (1827-97), chaplain to the Naval Brigade. Stothert was in Crimean waters between April 1854 and early January 1855, and between mid-April and early October 1855, much of the time on board HMS Queen.

He was promoted to brevet major on 22 September and became adjutant-general of artillery. He arrived in the Crimea on 14 September 1854 and was present with the headquarters staff at the Alma, Balaklava, and Inkerman, serving throughout the siege of Sevastopol, and remaining until June 1856.\n\nAdye, John Miller, Recollections of a military life. London: Smith, Elder & Co., 1895. x+382pp.\n\nSir John merged his personal experiences of the Crimean campaign with a general account of military strategies, achievements and failures (pp. 15-120).

He was present at the Alma on 20 September 1854, at Inkerman on 5 November and the following year, in the failed assaults on the Malakov and Redan in June and September. Between early December 1855 and February 1856 Allan was back in England, but returned to the Crimea in early March 1856 to describe events following the Treaty of Paris (pp. 46-174). His letters to his parents were edited for publication by his wife Jane Husey Allan. In an ‘Epilogue’ she describes a two-week trip with her husband to the Crimea in May 1893 and their visiting many of the battle sites (pp. 184-89).\n\nAndrews, Mottram, A series of views in Turkey and the Crimea; from the embarkation at Gallipoli to the fall of Sebastopol.

He landed at Kalamita Bay on 14 September (pp. 111-42). He accompanied wounded to Scutari on 8 December and returned to camp before Sevastopol on 4 January 1855, fell ill, and was evacuated to Scutari in early February and returned to England at the end of March (pp. 148-52). The eighty letters to his wife are more religious than medical or military in content.\n\nB., H[arry], Letters from the Crimea, during the years 1854 and 1855. London: Emily Faithfull, 1863. vii+151pp.\n\nThe letters sent to his parents by an anonymous soldier in the 2nd Rifle Brigade cover the period from 14 September 1854, the day of the landing, until 24 September 1855, shortly before his death during the second British assault on the Redan in early September 1855. He fought at the Alma, Balaklava and in the failed assault on the Redan on 18 June 1855.\n\nBarnston, William, and Barnston, Roger, Letters from the Crimea and India. Edited by Michael Trevor-Barnston. Farndon: M. Trevor-Barnston, 1998. xviii+270pp.\n\nThe Barnston brothers, William (1832-72) and Roger (1826-57), served in different regiments during the war: William in the 55th Regiment that landed in Evpatoriia Bay on 14 September 1854; Roger in the 90th Regiment, arriving at Balaklava on 6 December 1854. William’s letters describing the Crimea run from 17 September 1854 until 14 November 1854. Wounded at Inkerman, he was then invalided to Scutari. He was back in the Crimea from 1 March until his departure for Malta on 5 May 1856 (pp. 1-10, 17-26). Roger’s more extensive letters run from 6 December 1854 until his departure on 30 June 1856. Subsequent to his promotion to deputy assistant quartermaster general on 16 January 1855, his letters describe his surveying duties. Later letters reflect his passion for photography. From May 1856 onwards he was involved in organising the embarkation of the British army from the Crimea (pp. 33-170).\n\nBell, George, Rough notes by an old soldier, during fifty years’ service. London: Day & Son, Limited, 1867. 2 vols.\n\nMajor-General Sir George (1794-1877) commanded (as a lieutenant-colonel) the 1st Battalion Royal Regiment in the Crimea from 14 September 1854 to 16 March 1855. He writes critically of the privations and difficulties of camp life due to lack of supplies and provisions during the biting winter of 1854-55 and includes the text of a letter he sent to the Times, written on 12 December 1854, describing the real condition of the camp and state of the British campaign in contrast to the deceptions he believed were fed to the British public (vol. II, pp. 173-263).\n\nBostock, John Aston, Letters from India and the Crimea: selected from the correspondence of the late Deputy Surgeon-General Bostock. London: George Bell & Sons, 1896. xx+270pp.\n\nBostock (1815-95), who later became the deputy surgeon-general and honorary surgeon to Queen Victoria, was attached to the Scots Guards during the Crimean War. Letters detailing his experience in the Crimea run from 27 September 1854 until he leaves for Malta to recuperate on 30 March 1855. While rarely alluding to his work as a surgeon, they describe, often angrily, the deteriorating condition of the army, the limited and inadequate supplies, the severe weather conditions, and the spread of cholera with occasional notices on the recent events of the campaign (pp. 198-250).\n\nBurgoyne, John Fox, Life and correspondence of Field Marshal Sir John Burgoyne, bart. Edited by Lieutenant-Colonel the Hon. George Wrottesley. London: Richard Bentley and Son, 1873. 2 vols.\n\nA lengthy section relates to Sir John’s (1782-1871) service in the Crimea as lieutenant general in the British army between 17 September 1854 and 20 March 1855. A principal strategist during the first months of the war, he was made a scapegoat for the initial limited progress of the siege of Sevastopol and recalled by Secretary of State for War, Lord Panmure on 24 February 1855. There is extensive discussion of strategic planning at key moments during the campaign, disputes between the British and French military staffs, descriptions of the conduct of the siege, and angry letters ridiculing the British press’s charges of incompetence; the last items reveal his reaction to his recall (vol. II, pp. 85-279).\n\n[Calthorpe, Somerset John Gough], Letters from head-quarters; or, the realities of the war in the Crimea. By an officer on the staff. London: John Murray, 1856. 2 vols.\n\nLt.-Col. Calthorpe, later 7th baron Calthorpe (1831-1912), edited and published anonymously letters he had sent to friends from the Crimea, where he served as aide-de-camp to his uncle, Lord Raglan, whose reputation he stoutly defended. The letters run from 18 September 1854 until 30 June 1855 when, following Raglan’s death on 28 June, Calthorpe returned to Britain. In addition to the detailed account of military actions, Calthorpe mentions his participation in a decoy mission by ship to Yalta in late May 1855 and recalls a pleasure trip he had made to the southern Crimean coast in the summer of 1851.\n\n[Cardigan, James Thomas Brudenell, Earl of], Eight months on active service; or, a diary of a general officer of cavalry in 1854. London: William Clowes and Sons, [1855]. 122pp.\n\nCardigan (1797-1868), commander of the Light Brigade, kept a diary during 1854 in which the most notable entry not surprisingly relates his leading of the first line of the charge at Balaklava on 25 October 1854. Ill in November-early December, he was invalided to Constantinople on 6 December 1854.\n\nChodasiewicz, Robert Adolf, A voice from within the walls of Sebastopol: a narrative of the campaign in the Crimea, and of the events of the siege.

An officer in the 1st Battalion of the Rifle Brigade, promoted to captain of the Light Division in December 1854 and brevet-major in July 1855, he was awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions at Inkerman on 5 November 1854. His letters and journal, mainly from the British camp before Sevastopol, offer an often detailed commentary on the siege, camp-life, and his opinions on the army leadership.\n\nColebrooke, Thomas Edward, Journal of two visits to the Crimea: in the autumns of 1854 & 1855: with remarks on the campaign.

Between 14 September and 3 November 1854 he was on board HMS Britannia, witnessing the British landing at Kalamita Bay, visiting British camps at Evpatoriia and at Balaklava, recording his impressions and conversations with military personnel. On a second trip from 26 August until late October 1855, he notes how Balaklava had changed and offers a commentary on the British army’s conduct of the siege of Sevastopol. In a third and final section Colebrooke offers his “remarks on the campaign”.\n\nDallas, George Frederick, Eyewitness in the Crimea: the Crimean War letters (1854-1856) of Lt. Col.

He writes of the harsh realities of camp life, but also of the developing friendships in his regiment and offers more cheerful anecdotes about camp life. He also writes critically of British strategy and the failures of the army’s military leadership (pp. 32-255).\n\nDuberly, Frances Isabella, Journal kept during the Russian war: from the departure of the army from England in April 1854, to the fall of Sebastopol.

He was initially maltreated but subsequently received better treatment from Russian officers. He describes his march into captivity at Voronezh, via Simferopol, Ekaterinoslav, Kharkov, his experiences of being billeted on local families, his relations with fellow prisoners, and the beating he received on reaching prison. In August 1855 he was sent to Odessa and returned eventually to Balaklava on 27 October 1855.\n\nGodkin, Edwin Lawrence, Life and letters of Edwin Lawrence Godkin. Edited by Rollo Ogden. London: Macmillan & Co., 1907. 2 vols.\n\nGodkin (1831-1902) may lay claim to being the first British reporter of the Crimean War, sent out to Constantinople in October 1853 by the editor of the Daily News. Reporting initially from Turkey, Bulgaria and Rumania, he then sent back many dispatches from the Crimean battlefields after the British landings in mid-September 1854 until his departure in the late summer of 1855. Sadly, his letters have not been collected, mere extracts in this biography reflect his talents as a war correspondent (vol. I, pp. 21-108). He subsequently emigrated to America, where he founded The Nation in New York in 1865 and remained its editor until the end of 1899.\n\nGoodlake, Gerald Littlehales, Sharpshooter in the Crimea: the letters of Captain Goodlake, VC.

He was present, as participant or observer, at the major battles of the campaign. His account fuses later narrative comment with extracts from contemporary letters and journals (pp. 143-320). In 1884, when he was major-general of the Grenadier Guards, he was invited by Alexander III to attend a review of the Russian army.

He had arrived in the Crimea on 16 September 1854, but left on 11 November on the death of his father; he returned on 23 February 1855 and was joined for some months by his wife, before he finally departed on 9 December 1855. Extracts from his journal (pp. 15-151) are followed by later written chapters defending his actions in various battles, as well as other appendices, most interestingly, the comments on Paget’s account by Lieutenant-Colonel John Douglas (1810-71), who led the 11th Hussars during the charge of the Light Brigade.\n\nPeard, George Shuldham, Narrative of a campaign in the Crimea; including an account of the battles of Alma, Balaklava, and Inkermann.

He served as an officers’ servant attached to the British HQ in the camp before Sevastopol. He was involved in a number of the major military events, but the entries do not describe these in much detail: rather, they describe the camp life of an average soldier. He departed on 25 April 1856 (pp. 11-22)\n\nRobinson, Frederick, Diary of the Crimean War.

Heavily based on personal observations, but supplemented from official sources and the testimony and correspondence of others, his journalistic account follows the campaign until the fall of Sevastopol. Strongly critical of Westminster politicians, he emphasizes the hardships and horrors of war (vol.

His book, based partly on his “hurried letters”, recounts movingly his experiences with the British forces from the end of December 1854 to February 1855. He combines on-the-spot observation with “tourist” information gleaned from printed sources (pp. 12-128). After six weeks he returned to Constantinople and visited the hospitals at Scutari.

Upbeat in tone, his letters for the most part describe the idleness of camp life but he gives a detailed account of his part in the failed British assault on the Redan on 18 June 1855 and his search for war trophies in the evacuated Sevastopol fortress. He participated in the Allied expedition that captured Kinburn in mid-October 1855. His last letter from Crimean soil is dated 10 May 1856 (pp. 9-98). Subsequent letters describe his service with the Boundary Commission, fixing the new frontier between Russia and Moldavia and Wallachia and then in Armenia between Russia and Turkey. He weaves in and out of Russian territory, including Georgia, from the end of June 1857 until finally leaving for Constantinople in mid-November (pp. 147-205).\n\nHawley, Robert Beaufoy, The Hawley letters: the letters of Captain R.B.

Within weeks, on 23 March, Kelly was captured by the Russians and he describes his experience as a prisoner of war as he journeys from Sevastopol, via Simferopol and Ekaterinoslav, to Riazan, where he arrives on 25 May 1855. On his release he travelled back to Balaklava via Kursk, Kharkov, Poltava, Odessa and Constantinople between 14 August and 14 September 1855. An appendix contains letters regarding his falsely reported death in the British press in mid-March 1855 and a letter describing his time as a Russian prisoner Kelly wrote in October 1868 to the historian A.W.

The resulting two-volume work offers an inevitably French account of the campaign, an exhaustive narrative prefaced and concluded by sections on the war’s origins and outcomes. It is written as an official history, but includes to a degree the personal observations of Bazancourt, who was in the Crimea from January until the autumn of 1855, together with the testimony of others and the evidence of despatches and correspondence.\n\nGoodman, Margaret, Experiences of an English Sister of Mercy. London: Smith, Elder & Co., 1862. 234pp.\n\nGoodman was a Devonport Sister of Mercy, a member of the group travelling with Florence Nightingale to the hospital at Scutari, where they arrived on 4 November 1854.

London: Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1856. x+195pp.\n\nPorter (1827-92), a major in the Royal Engineers, offers an anaesthetized and uncritical account of his time in the Crimea between January and May 1855, when he was invalided to Scutari. Many of his descriptions of camp life and daily routines are rarely linked to specific dates or events, but he includes extracts from his diary from 3 March to 11 May 1855 (pp. 23-180).\n\nDavis, Elizabeth, The autobiography of Elizabeth Davis, a Balaklava nurse, daughter of Dafydd Cadwaladyr.

After his return from Scutari, Reid describes the terrible losses amongst the British and French forces in the trenches due to their proximity to the Russian lines and how in the wake of the failed British assault on the Redan on 8 September, he worked non-stop for forty-eight hours. His final letters describe the festivities following the fall of Sevastopol and his visits to the Russian lines following the Treaty of Paris (pp. 4-175).\n\n[Sullivan, Edward Robert], A trip to the trenches in February and March, 1855. By an amateur.

Taking with him his “photographic van”, a wine-merchant’s carriage converted into a mobile darkroom, two assistants, and letters of introduction from Prince Albert, Fenton left England on 20 February 1855. Over the next few months he photographed military commanders, local figures, and studies of camp life, and wrote copious letters, mainly to his wife Grace and to Thomas Agnew & Sons, the sponsors of his trip. The Gernsheims include extracts from the surviving twenty-five letters, preserved in two letter-books, over the period 27 February to 25 June 1855.\n\nFox Maule, 2nd Baron Panmure, The Panmure papers: being a selection from the correspondence of Fox Maule, second Baron Panmure, afterward eleventh Earl of Dalhousie, K.

He describes camp life at Balaklava, visits the site of the charge of the Light Brigade, and gives an account of the battle of Chernaia in August 1855, but in general he offers more an indulgent tourist’s journal than a soldier’s memoirs, describing trips taken purely for amusement (pp. 87-137).\n\nHall, Jasper, Letters from the Crimea: Captain Jasper Hall of the 4th (King’s Own) Regiment of Foot to his sister and father. Lancaster: King’s Own Royal Regiment Museum, 1977. 36pp.\n\nLieutenant in the 4th Regiment, promoted to captain on 29 December 1854, Hall (d. 1856) was appointed aide-de-camp to General Codrington in December 1855.

Skene himself made at least two visits to Sevastopol, the first following the Russian evacuation from the city on 10 September 1855 (pp. 317-22), the second a few months later, when he accompanied Lord Stratford (pp. 338-46).\n\nMoney, Edward, Twelve months with the Bashi-Bazouks.

London: Charles J. Skeet, 1860. xii+307pp.\n\nAuthor of numerous works of military theory, history and fiction, Sir Frederic (1828-65) recounts the time he spent as an assistant-commissary of the Field Train with the Turkish Contingent at Kerch, where he seems to have been based between autumn 1855 and summer 1856. The tone of the chapters is journalistic and often light-hearted, as he describes camp life, including much on the quality of food, servants and quarters. His relations with the Turkish Contingent were often poor, but he includes descriptions of various interesting individuals he met, his relations with and his views on the French troops, the organization of horse racing following the armistice and excursions out into the countryside around Kerch (pp. 12-217).\n\nBeddoe, John, Memories of eighty years.

They were to travel to Tiflis, where they remained for a month, before Lake and Thompson were ordered in January 1856 to proceed to Penza. They journeyed through the Caucasus, reached the Don at the beginning of February and travelled via Tambov to Penza, everywhere treated with respect and hospitality. It was in Penza that they were freed from captivity with the ending of the war, and they travelled home via Moscow and St Petersburg (pp. 246-337).\n\n[Anon.], Observations on the Turkish Contingent. By a field officer of the force. London: Printed by Smith, Elder and Co., 1856. 31pp.\n\nWritten at Kerch, the pamphlet is a rebuttal of criticisms of the Turkish Contingent which was staffed by East India Company officers.
