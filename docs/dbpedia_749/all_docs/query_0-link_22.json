        "text": "1st April 1663, Letter from John Bankes to Sir GO, London\n\nBL, Add. MS. XX,XXX, f. 82\n\nEditorial history\n\n04/06/09, CSG; Completed transcription\n\n14/12/11, CSG: Created page & posted transcription to wiki\n\nAbstract & context\n\nThe London merchant John Bankes (alias Banks) (b. 1627, d. 1699) wrote to Sir George Oxenden from London on April 1st 1663 on behalf of his kinsman, Alexander Grigsby.\n\nJohn Bankes described Alexander Grigsby (b. 1638, d. 1673, at Surat) as a former servant of his, reporting that as his servant \"hee was Injenyous & apt to busyeness & very honest.\"\n\nGrigsby was was John Banks' first cousin; the son of his father's sister, Elizabeth, who had married Thomas Grigsby in 1622 in Maidstone. At the time of John Banks' letter, Alexander Grigsby's father was dead, having died ca. 1650, when Alexander was still a child.[1]\n\nThe first mention of Alexander Grigsby in English East India Company records is in 1658 in connection with a planned, but aborted, mission to establish a factory in China.[2] Grigsby was described then as \"a youth,\" which matches a suggested birth date of 1638.[3]\n\nAlexander Grigsby was later appointed a member of the eight man council at Surat, though stationed initially at the Keralan town of Cale Velha, a few miles south of Cochin.[4] Subsequent probably to John Banks' letter, though perhaps before the letter's arrival in Surat, Grigsby was moved to the coastal town of Porcat with fellow factor John Harrington, where he and Harrington were located in December 1663.[5] Grigsby was to die in Surat in his mid-thirties in 1673.\n\nAt the time of writing John Banks was about thirty-six years old. Son of Caleb Bankes, a Maidstone merchant,[6] John Banks he had built his commercial career in the 1650s. Unusually for a London merchant, he had attended university, being admitted a pensioner to Emmanuel College, Cambridge, in May 1644.[7] His intellectual interests continued, with election as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1668.\n\n1657 there were rumours of a new Excise farm involving a \"syndicate of merchant financiers.\" D.C. Coleman commented in his biography of Sir John Banks that, although the deal was not consumated, \"the leading members of the syndicate make an interesting group: Dethick, Noell, Ford, Banks, John Frederick and Nathaniell Temms.\"[8] Coleman suggests that key to the rise of such merchants were their close contacts with the Commonwealth government and their involvement in naval finance and procurement.\n\nJohn Banks' career was assisted by marriage about 1657 to Elizabeth Dethicke, daughter of Sir John Dethicke (alias Dethwicke), London merchant and mercer.[9] John Banks successfully made the transition into the commercial world of the Restoration (as did his father-in-law), being made knight and baronet in 1661. However, Banks did not resume his political career started as M.P. for Maidstone, 1654-1659, until 1678, when he was elected M.P. for Winchelsea.\n\nSir John Banks acquired the manor of Shales-court, Aylesford, three miles to the North-West of Maidstone. Hasted stated that the manor had been alienated to him in the early 1660s from Sir Thomas Hendley of Coursehourne.[10] However, the official website of the Friars, Aylesford, known also as Aylesford Priory, states that Sir John Banks acquired the building in 1657 from the widow of the London merchant Sir Peter Rycaut and her son, Sir Paul Rycault.[11] The house was reported having twenty-five hearths at the Lady Day 1664 hearth tax assessment.[12] Banks carried out extensive building work on the house, transforming it, according to D.C. Coleman \"from an only partially converted medieval priory into an elegant country house,\" with much of the expenditure in the late 1670s and early 1680s.[13] At his death in 1699, Banks gave his residence as Aylesford, Kent.[14] The main block of the Friars is now a listed building.[15]\n\nThe father-in-law of Sir John Banks, Sir John Dethwick, had a seventeen hearth house in Tottenham, Middlesex, as recorded in the 1666 Lady Day hearth tax returns.[16]\n\nSee Maidstone\n\nTo do\n\n(1) Check transcription against physical manuscript at BL\n\n(2) Summarise Latham & Mathews entry on Sir John Banks\n\n(3) Look at Samuel Pepys' meetings with, and comments on, Sir John Banks[17]\n\nImages\n\nThe Friars, near Aylesford, Kent\n\nPossible images\n\nShepherd, George Sidney, 'The Fryars at Aylesford, the seat of Lord Aylesford,' engraver Benjamin Winckles, in XXXX, England's Topographer series (London, 1828-1831), steel line engraving on paper.

Rider how he rose; and others. By and by joyned with us Sir John Bankes; who told us several passages of the East India Company; and how in his very case, when there was due to him and Alderman Mico 64,000l. from the Dutch for injury done to them in the East Indys, Oliver presently after the peace, they delaying to pay them the money, sent them word, that if they did not pay them by such a day, he would grant letters of mark to those merchants against them; by which they were so fearful of him, they did presently pay the money every farthing.\"[23]\n\n\"Friday 13 October 1665 ...To-night come Sir J. Bankes to me upon my letter to discourse it with him, and he did give me the advice I have taken almost as fully as if I had been directed by him what to write.\"[24]\n\n\"Friday 26 January 1665/66...Thence with Sir J. Bankes and Mr. Gawden to the ‘Change, they both very wise men. After ‘Change and agreeing with Houblon about our ships, D. Gawden and I to the Pope’s Head and there dined and little Chaplin (who a rich man grown). He gone after dinner, D. Gawden and I to talke of the Victualling business of the Navy in what posture it is, which is very sad also for want of money.\"[25]\n\n\"Thursday 24 May 1666...Home, and Mr. Hunt come to dine with me, but I was prevented dining till 4 o’clock by Sir H. Cholmly and Sir J. Bankes’s coming in about some Tangier business. They gone I to dinner, the others having dined.\"[26]\n\n\"Monday 11 June 1666...Late comes Sir J. Bankes to see me, and tells me that coming up from Rochester he overtook three or four hundred seamen, and he believes every day they come flocking from the fleete in like numbers; which is a sad neglect there, when it will be impossible to get others, and we have little reason to think that these will return presently again. He gone, I to end my letters to-night, and then home to supper and to bed.\"[27]\n\n\"Wednesday 27 March 1667...But it comes into my mind here to observe what I have heard from Sir John Bankes, though I cannot fully conceive the reason of it, that it will be impossible to make the Exchequer ever a true bank to all intents, unless the Exchequer stood nearer the Exchange, where merchants might with ease, while they are going about their business, at all hours, and without trouble or loss of time, have their satisfaction, which they cannot have now without much trouble, and loss of half a day, and no certainty of having the offices open. By this he means a bank for common practise and use of merchants, and therein I do agree with him.\"[28]\n\n\"Saturday 4 April 1668...Thence home to the office by water, where we sat till noon, and then I moved we might go to the Duke of York and the King presently to get out their order in writing that was ordered us yesterday about the business of certificates, that we might be secure against the tradesmen who (Sir John Banks by name) have told me this day that they will complain in Parliament against us for denying to do them right. So we rose of a sudden, being mighty sensible of this inconvenience we are liable to should we delay to give them longer, and yet have no order for our indemnity.\"[29]\n\n\"Wednesday 23 December 1668 Met at the Office all the morning, and at noon to the ‘Change, and there met with Langford and Mr. Franke, the landlord of my father’s house in Fleet Streete, and are come to an arbitration what my father shall give him to be freed of his lease and building the house again. Walked up and down the ‘Change, and among others discoursed with Sir John Bankes, who thinks this prorogation will please all but the Parliament itself, which will, if ever they meet, be vexed at Buckingham, who yet governs all. He says the Nonconformists are glad of it, and, he believes, will get the upperhand in a little time, for the King must trust to them or nobody; and he thinks the King will be forced to it. He says that Sir D. Gawden is mightily troubled at Pen’s being put upon him, by the Duke of York, and that he believes he will get clear of it, which, though it will trouble me to have Pen still at the Office, yet I shall think D. Gawden do well in it, and what I would advise him to, because I love him.\"[30]\n\nSir John Banks monument, Aylesford parish church\n\n\"Aylesford church is a handsome building. It contains various memorials of the Aylesford branch of the Finch family; and of the Colpepper, Suke, Banks, Rycaut, and Sedley families. On the costly monument of Sir John Banks, Bart., who died in 1699, aet. 72, is his effigy in marble, with that of his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Sir John Dethick.\"[31]\n\nGrigsby family\n\nA genealogical web page suggests that Alexander Grigsby was born in Maidstone, Kent and christened on March 4th 1628 at Ashford, Kent. The same site suggests he died on June 25th 1673 at Surat, aged 35. This parents are given as Thomas Grigsby (b. 1599, d, ca, 1650) and Elizabeth Bankes (b. 1607, d. 1675).[32]\n\nElizabeth Bankes, alleged mother of Alexander Grigsby, is shown on the genealogical website as the sister of Caleb Bankes (and thus the aunt of John Bankes, who wrote to Sir George Oxenden on April 1st 1663 regarding his relative (that is his first cousin). Elizabeth Bankes marriage to Thomas Grigsby is given as June 9th 1622 at All Saints Church Maidstone.[33]\n\nCale Vela, East Indies\n\n\"...Walter Travers, John Harrington , and Alexander Grigsby.

The Hopewell had on board eleven parcels of opium, and ' baggs of chicqueenes of gold ', consigned to John Harrington and Alexander Grigsby, the Company's factors at Porcat ; she carried no arms, ammunition, or contraband goods. Porcat is about fourteen leagues south of Cochin and is a place of no defence, having no garrison or fortifications ; only about five guns lying on a sandbank by the sea, and these are used more to salute friends than to offend an enemy. About 1649 the Company's ship, the Discovery, laded a large quantity of pepper at Porcat, and since then the English have traded there, being several times invited by the King or Rajah of that place and the country thereabouts, who is neither a Portuguese or Moor, but a Gentue, and tributary to the Samareene or Emperor, who lives up in the country and whose dominions extend from about Carwar to Cape Comorin and who is neither tributary nor vassal to the King of Cochin. The Dutch had not obtained any victory or conquest over the King of Cochin, who was not dependent upon, neither had he any protection from, the Portuguese, being a free Prince and only tributary to the above-mentioned Samareene. His residence is in the upper town of Cochin, up in the country, so that the pretence of the Dutch to the conquest of the King of Cochin appears to be but a fallacy, as they only obtained the conquest of Cochin, which was in the possession of the Portuguese. In 1660 the President and Council of Surat sent factors to settle a factory and to reside at Porcat. They were very courteously entertained by the Rajah, who undertook to build them a house (which he did), and give it freely to the English, who should only pay the ordinary customs and be free from all molestation and encumbrances..\"[40]\n\n\"The Court therefore, appointed Sir George Oxinden to be President at SURAT, with a Council of Eight, viz. Mr. Gerard Aungier, Mr. Mathew Gray, Mr. Thomas Rolt, Mr. Henry Young, Mr. Streynsham Master, Mr. Charles James, Mr. Philip Gofford, and Mr. Alexander Grigsby, five of whom were constantly to reside at Surat, particularly Mr. Aungier, Mr. Gray, and Mr. James.\"[41]\n\nEEIC, 1677-1679\n\n\"The account of Alexander Grigsby [Grigby] to be re-examined and reported.\"[42]\n\nPossible primary sources\n\nTNA\n\nC 2/ChasI/B103/26 Short title: Banks v Ingram.
