Austria had an Empress, not a Queen so what is the title about? She marriedÂ Sigismund III Vasa, king of Sweden and Poland. It was a love match. The Poles sent border guards to keep her out, but she infiltrated, got toÂ KrakÃ³w and married and became Queen. When she followedÂ Sigismund to Sweden to be crowned at Uppsala, the Poles demanded she leave her daughter behind. They had five children, but only Vladislaus survived to adulthood.Â Sigismund remarried another Habsburg, Anna's sisterÂ Constance.
