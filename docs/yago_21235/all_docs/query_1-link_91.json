        "text": "The tradition of shortening Polish names was popular in California during the early 20th century. Examples include Kalinowski becoming Kalin, Adamczyk becoming Adams, and Lukaszewicz becoming Lukas. The suffix \"—ski\" is a common element in Polish surnames and usually means \"of\" or \"from,\" indicating a person's place of origin or ancestry. The reasons behind the tradition of shortening names also includes practicalities such as easier pronunciation, avoidance of stereotype, and cultural reasons such as maintaining a connection to Polish roots while simultaneously building a new American identity.\n\nIn some cases, anglicization of foreign names is simply a matter of personal preference or trendiness. For example, individuals may choose to adopt a nickname that is easier to say and remember, such as Steve Wozniak becoming known as \"The Woz.\" In other cases, people may choose to modify their names in order to fit in with the dominant culture or to make it easier for others to communicate with them. While this practice has been around for centuries, it has become more prevalent in modern times due to the globalized nature of our society and the increasing popularity of social media and online communication. Despite the name changes, many people continue to maintain a strong connection to their heritage and culture, and find ways to honor their traditions in their daily lives.\n\nThis practice has become exceedingly prevalent in Hollywood, a social phenomenon by that it is often considered a rite of passage. It is a means of creating a more marketable persona. Many famous actors, actresses, musicians, authors, journalists, performers, entertainment professionals, creatives, designers and artists have altered their names to make them more appealing or easier to remember for audiences.\n\nShortening Polish names contributed to the sense of heritage and tribute to the culture and tradition of the Polish immigrants in America. By choosing a shortened version of their name that was still recognizable as Polish, they were able to honor their heritage and culture while adapting to American society. This provided them with a sense of connection to their roots while embracing their new identity, which helped them feel more at home in their new country.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the history of the English language in America and Polish immigration to the United States resonates from the late 19th century when the first English-language book was printed in California by Felix Wierzbicki. He was a Polish immigrant, veteran, and a doctor of medicine who published \"California as it is, and as it may be,\" in 1849. According to the Library of Congress, the book was a valuable guide to California for prospective settlers that includes a survey of agriculture, hints on gold mining, a guide to San Francisco, and a chapter on California's Hispanic residents and Native American tribes.\n\nMany place names in California and the Western United States were Americanized in the early 1900s, a similar trend to the anglicization of Polish names. For example, Los Angeles was originally named \"El Pueblo de Nuestra Señora la Reina de Los Ángeles del Río Porciúncula,\" translated to “The Town of Our Lady the Queen of the Angels of the Porciúncula River.” It was shortened to the more easily pronounceable \"Los Angeles.\" Similarly, San Francisco was originally named after Saint Francis of Assisi as \"Mission San Francisco de Asís,\" but was shortened to its current name for convenience. These examples illustrate how Americanization was not limited to the anglicization of Polish names, but was a widespread phenomenon in the early 1900s.\n\nThe anglicization of Polish names also ties into the revolutionary ideas of \"Golden Liberty\" and the concept of the Sejm parliament in Poland. It’s inspiring that Polish American Revolutionary War heroes Tadeausz Kosciuszko and Casimir Pulaski (Father of the American Cavalry) played important roles in decolonization. The idea of \"Golden Liberty\" arose in the Kingdom of Poland and Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which established that the szlachta, or nobility, elected the king and forbade them from issuing laws without the consent of the Sejm parliament. This system of governance was founded on the principles of democracy and consent of the governed, and it served as a precursor to the first written constitutions, such as the Fundamental Orders and the US Constitution. Interestingly, Matthew Kalinowski’s matriarchal Hoyt name has a legacy tied to the Fundamental Orders and the early founding history of Connecticut.\n\nKalin translates to viburnum and represents the beginnings of something new. It is the potential for future development, a genitive plural (e.g. “ogród pełen kalin” means “a garden full of guelder roses.”), and a diminutive form of Kalina(Kalyna)/Kalinowa. Kalisz and Kalin are nearly etymologically synonymous as a “root,” “bud,” or “sprout” of earth in which can translate as “new earth” and “new beginnings” in Slavic languages. Notably the Statute of Kalisz (Kaliski) shares the spirit of the nomenclature, a revered document establishing Judaic order and civil rights in the 13th century. This root word is shared with the pagan mystical viburnum and berry bush of kalina, kaylina, and kalinowa that is often spelled Kalinowski meaning “of Kalinowa.” Kalinowski is the variation derived from Kalina and is used in Slavic languages to describe the Guelder Rose Viburnum.\n\nThe Kalina Guilder Rose Viburnum, is well known from the song Kalinka, where it is heard as “snowberry” or “snowball berry.” Kalin is prominently featured in Eastern European folklore and mythology. On many occasions Kalina is viewed as an example of celebrating the connectedness of the Earth and its energy with the Moon, Sun, and Stars, which are seen as eternal and powerful forces of the universe that bring resurgence of inner strength, creativity and wisdom to our lives. The Kalina Guilder Rose Viburnum is deeply connected with the human spirit and tells the story of how a rooted thing, a “flowering bush from the Earth,” can be celebrated and respected, no matter our origin.\n\nKalina Viburnum is a deciduous shrub native to temperate regions of Europe and North America, with clusters of white flowers and bright red berries. The plant is often called the 'Ukrainian, Russian, or Polish national flower' and is part of their national symbolism and traditions.\n\nThis linguistic journey from proto-indo-european roots to \"kolinos\" (holly) in Celtic traditions, with its descendants \"celyn\" (Welsh), “cuileann” (Irish/Scottish/Gaelic), and \"kelenn\" (Breton), to \"kalina\" (viburnum) in Slavic languages, demonstrates how different cultures have developed symbolic associations with similar natural elements. The Kalina Guelder Rose Viburnum, a deciduous plant that embodies the full cycle of life, is deeply woven into Central & Eastern European folklore and mythology, much like evergreen holly in Celtic lore. Visually, both plants share a striking similarity with their bright red berries with lush green leaves, further enhancing their symbolic prominence. For the Druids, holly symbolized resilience and protection, standing out prominently in the landscape. Similarly, Kalina, with its striking presence reaching up from the depths toward the stars, symbolizes renewal and the cyclical nature of life. Phonetically, the words \"kolinos,\" \"celyn,\" and \"kalina\" resonate with one another, sounding remarkably similar and evoking the same level of reverence in their respective cultures. Both plants are imbued with mystical significance, representing nature's enduring power and its connection to the cosmic forces that inspire inner strength, creativity, and wisdom.\n\nThe noble starosts, gallantly featured in tales of Poland, Italy, and Vienna, includes prominent namesake Grand Crown Hetman Voivode Hrabia, Governor, Deputy to the Sejm, and Senator (“Commander-in-Chief” Princely Count/Duke & Member of Parliament/Senate First Polish Republic) Marcin Kalinowski h. Kalinowa, husband of Princess Helena née Korecka. His family's legacy and monuments are present in Poland and Eastern Europe. They are of the largest and prestigious landowners in Polish history. Their holdings included the 16th century “Palace of Anna Vasa” in Brodnica. Notably, the palace was also owned by starosts Queen Maria Kazimiera, the wife of the elected King John III Sobieski, and Queen Constance of Austria, the wife of the elected King Sigismund III Vasa (House of Gediminas branch, the Jagiellons and grandson of Queen Bona Sforza of Milan). Other substantive properties owned by the Kalinowski family include Sydoriv Castle in Husiatyn, Zhvanets Castle, Château de Kremenets, Krzyztopór Ossolin Castle in Ujazd (largest palace in Europe until the French Versailles), Tulchyn Estate, Skalat Estate, Uman Estate, Chernihiv Estate, among over twenty-five villages owned by the family throughout their provincial voivodes Russ, Podolia, Wołynia, and Bracław granted by the Jagiellonian Dynasty and the Henrician First Republic. The Kalinowski’s were interconnected both politically and hereditarily to the Potocki family, markedly Count Stanisław \"Rewera\" Potocki, husband of heiress Zofia née Kalinowska, 2nd great grandparents of Count Stanisław Kostka Potocki (awarded The Order of the White Eagle, The Order of Saint Stanislaus, and The Legion of Honour); the family is considered of the most influential royal houses in Poland with impressive fine art, palaces, and castles comprising their holdings that includes Potocki Palace in Warsaw, located opposite the Presidential Palace.\n\nSignificant famous names of Polish heritage also include Saint Raphael Kalinowski, revolutionary Konstanty Kalinowski, and Princess Olga Oginska née Countess Kalinowska-Potacka (first love of Emperor Tsar Alexander II Nikolayevich Romanov of Russia, who sired her son Prince Bogdan Nikolay Oginski). Architect Zdzisław Kalinowski played an important role in the reconstruction of the ancient town of Kalisz and other Polish cities. His designs blended traditional and modern elements, representing the ongoing transformation of Polish culture.\n\nThe palatyn hrabia Kalinowski herbu Kalinowa z królewsci szlachta magnate family name (Her/His Excellency H.E. - Counts of the Holy Roman Empire, royal nobility of the Kingdom of Poland), which symbolically means \"fire trinity” (sun, moon, and stars), represented by the radiant viburnum opulus guilder snowball rosebush & crimson berries, can be seen as a metaphor for the blossoming of new life from the roots of Kalisz to Kalinowa, similar to the way a lotus flower blooms from a ravine. Immortal nature, the nomenclature and etymology of Kalin resonates with “kalen” as a word symbolic of agricultural cycle or “koło,” like Poland’s fabled founder Piast Kołodziej and the kalendarium of the seasons — Piast, a humble descendant and wheelwright of the legendary progenitor Lech at Gniezno, was elected by the citizens to become a prince. He became a symbol of a righteous citizen and ruler who was chosen through democratic election. Phonetically, Kalinowski is similar to “kolejnośći,” meaning the “order,” (e.g. “kolejnośći królewieci” means “the royal order of kings.”) The Festival of Kalina and the Kalyta holiday are traditional celebrations of varying forms throughout Eastern Europe that honors the beauty and iconic significance of the viburnum guilder rose through cultural activities and the traditional products such as vinok Kalina flower & berry crowns.\n\nIn this context, the anglicized internationalization of Polish names can be seen as a way for Polish immigrants to embrace the democratic ideals of Golden Liberty and the US Constitution while still maintaining a connection to their heritage. By shortening their names to make them more easily pronounceable in English, they were able to adapt to American society while still honoring their cultural identity. This tradition can be seen as a tribute to the democratic traditions of Poland, which ultimately influenced the development of democracy in the Western world. The practice that has been going on for centuries, and it's not unique to any one country or culture. In the United States, it has been used as a means of smithing new identities and embracing individualism. Many view this as a metamorphosis of cultural heritage, and see it as a way to adapt to a new environment and create a unique sense of self. This practice reflects the American spirit of independence and self-determination. It's not about conforming to a certain standard or ideology, but about creating something new and meaningful that reflects one's personal identity."
