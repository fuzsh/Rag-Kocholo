        "text": "Paintings of art galleries do not only represent works of art, they also provide us with a visual understanding of the context in which they were once displayed. Of special interest is the art gallery of Rubens, an artist who himself owned a reputed collection of antique sculptures and paintings that is presumably depicted in the seventeenth-century painting The Studio of Rubens. Only, is it indeed Rubens' studio that is represented? In this paper, the diverse aspects of the painting, such as the represented works of art, the staffage, and the provenance, as well as the placement of The Studio of Rubens within the tradition of depicting art galleries in seventeenth-century Antwerp, will be examined. As a result, the study of The Studio of Rubens draws connections between creators, patrons, dealers, and connoisseurs – of art.\n\nThis paper focuses on three practical issues which are of major relevance for large format paintings: handling, transportation and presentation. Peter Paul Rubens’ Last Judgement is an excellent example with respect to the implications of large size and heavy weight. Wherever this painting has been in its c.400-year history, the difficulties with its handling and transportation have caused damage. Indeed, projected locations for presentation had to be changed. Taking Neuburg as an example, numerous newly discussed documentary sources such as travel or annual reports illustrate these processes. For the first time, the work’s historical presentation at the Neuburg Jesuit court church is discussed by means of a photomontage. The paper exemplifies that careful study of documentary sources in the actual historic and topographic context will add valuable information to conventional art-technological studies. Moreover, it recalls the painting’s other, often neglected, history of its life b...\n\nDespite Rome and Mantua being considered the artistically most influential and fruitful periods of Rubens’s Italian journey, the painter visited several other cities. As one of these, Florence and the way the city and its art influenced the Flemish master still demands deeper investigation. Rubens visited Florence at least twice: in October 1600, when he attended – in the retinue of his patron Vincenzo Gonzaga – the marriage of Maria de’ Medici, and in March 1603, while he was on his way to Spain for a diplomatic mission, again, in the name of the Mantuan Court. This paper aims at providing a holistic perspective on both Rubens’s stays in Florence and on the artworks he encountered and studied there. By doing so, it seeks to shed new light on his Florentine sojourns, arguing, moreover, that he visited the city primarily in the role of a diplomat rather than in that of an artist. Reverberations of Florentine art, however, can be found throughout his oeuvre, especially when referring to the works of art by his compatriot Giambologna, which had a crucial impact on Rubens’s multidimensional understanding and handling of figures.\n\nDuring the preliminary study of the Western European Fine Arts Collections of the Georgian National Museum, special attention was paid to the artwork entitled “The Love Scene” (seventeenth century, oil on panel, 87 x 80 cm, inv. No. სხმ/დ-ე ფ220; Museum of Fine Arts, Georgian National Museum) (Fig. 1), attributed to the Circle of Peter Paul Rubens, perhaps the most renowned painter of Flemish Baroque period. The X-radiograph and IR refectograph of the painting revealed certain changes in the paint layers of the picture. The latter discovery initiated the further comprehensive research that aims to answer those multiple questions which arose in regards to the selected artwork: provenance, interpretation, iconography, dating and medium studies. Thereby, it opened the discussion towards the reattribution of the regarded painting."
