Revolution filled the air at the end of the 1800s and beginning of the 1900s, destroying many monarchies. The majority of the revolting nations replaced their thrones with communist governments. Despite that, on June 4, 1918 the Council of Lithuania voted to invite Prince Wilhelm of Urach, Count of Württemberg, to become the king of a newly independent Lithuania. He was elected on 11 July 1918, taking the name King Mindaugas II. Through marriage to Duchess Amalie in Bavaria (1865–1912), is related, also, to the Lithuanian princess Louise Caroline Radvila of Biržai.It is very symbolic that the rare documents such as the letter of Pope Benedict XV, welcoming Wilhelm's selection as the future king of Lithuania (the copy of the document could be found in Stuttgart archive) and letters between General von Ludendorff and Swiss government stating the election of the king in 1918 (courtesy The Lithuanian cultural center in Germany) become known to Lithuanian public.\n\nDespite the global economic and political crises, the leading monarchies of the world manage to overcome these hardships with much dignity, through giving their nations the sense of unity, missing in other modern forms of government. In Lithuania, we may, recently, observe the active revival of the monarchist’s movement and the public opinion steadily grows favorable to monarchy re-establishment. We agree with the majority of Lithuanians, who believes that the throne pretender choice should be based not only on dynastic principles but also on ability to serve to the people successfully. The Royal House of Lithuania Association(headed by H.E. Stanislovas Švedarauskas), the oldest and most reputable monarchist’s movement of Lithuania, did a profound case study of the potential legitimate candidates and arrived at the conclusion that H.S.H. Prince Inigo von Urach, Count of Württemberg suites for position of the Lithuanian throne pretender more then anybody else.\n\nInigo von Urach (born 1962) is the direct descendant of the last Lithuanian king Mindaugas II, Roman Catholic, family man and dedicated father of 3 children (2 of them-boys). He is connected to Lichtenstein, Luxembourg, British, Russian, Monaco, Bavarian and Portuguese Royal families by birth. The Prince is actively working on positive country image establishment leading to deeper European integration. He supports Lithuanian cultural center in Germany, learning its language and culture. Inigo is constantly visiting the country of his ancestors, meet Lithuanians from a wide spectrum of life, understands their interests and daily problems. His social activities gained interest of the international media, people’s love and recognition (he is a honorary citizen of Kaunas town).The throne pretender should, obligatory, have successful military career to be able to play an important role in recognizing and supporting the work of the Armed Services. Inigo is the only von Urach family member to hold high military rank, serving currently in the army, and regularly participating in NATO military exercises. Finally, His Highness is willing to carry out important work in the areas of public and charitable service, through partnership with Royal House of Lithuania Association in the frame of the joint socio-cultural project called ”King Mindaugas Institute”.\n\nFollowing the formal offer, done by the most numerable monarchist movement of Lithuania and recognition of his high statues, H.S.H. Prince Inigo von Urach, Count of Württemberg officially accepted the position. His full title since now will be: H.R.H. Grand Duke Inigo of Lithuania, Fürst v. Urach,Count of Württemberg. The Association and His Royal Highness are now partnering for bringing to Lithuania maximum social prosperity, national unity strengthening and stability effect regardless of the monarchy re-establishment.\n\nFor more information:\n\nâ€œThe Royal House of Lithuaniaâ€ | Facebook\n\nMessage received by the Administrators...\n\n​\n\nThe leading monarchist movement of Lithuania, The Royal House of Lithuania Association, is honored to inform that\n\nHSH Prince Inigo von Urach, Count of Württemberg\n\ngreat-grandson of the last King Mindaugas II of Lithuania,\n\nwas elected and recognized as the legitimate pretender to the Lithuanian Royal Throne.\n\n​\n\nFor many centuries Lithuania has been shaping its state.

He is the author of other historical novels such as \"Afghanistan,\" \"Hawaii\" and many others. I was so fascinated with \"Poland\" that I didn't put it down, except to sleep and eat, until I finished it. It has a broad historical sweep, showing people of all classes, including elected kings and defenders of Poland against encroachment, as well as Polish people who became the leaders of modern Poland (with a flavor like Doctor Zhivago about Russia).\n\nThere is considerable discussion in this novel about who became rulers of Poland and why, coming usually from the nobility, but different segments of the nobility who had differing ambitions and goals.\n\nThis thread is very interesting historically.\n\nThe Scots also elected their kings in the eras before the Stuarts became hereditary kings. I don't remember how the Stuarts became hereditary, but it probably was similar to the way in which the Carolingians took over from the previous dynasty of the Merovingians. The Carolingians were \"mayors of the palace\" to the Merovingians and did the day to day business of the crown, and finally took over, although Carolingian kings married Merovingian princesses to give authority to their rule. The Stuarts started their ascent as similar aides to the kings of Brittany and later Scotland, such as King David I of Scotland. Finally they became the ruling thread of the land, and also gained legitimacy by marrying noblewomen and a king's daughter such as Marjory Bruce.\n\nMy own family was perhaps a notch below the Stuarts as \"aides\", since they seem to have been aides to the Stuarts in England and then followed them to Scotland and always supported them even when it meant loss of their lands and power.\n\nPoland's last dynastic monarchs vs. later elected monarchs\n\nHello everyone!\n\nFrom what I best remember in my memory... I believe King Sigismund II Augustus was the last dynastic king (monarch) of Poland.\n\nHe ruled until about 1570 (again... as best I remember). After that, as so many people here have pointed out, Poland became an \"elective monarchy\" -- with the country's powerful nobility choosing their own rulers.\n\nMuch of our conversation here has been about an \"elective king\" (or queen) coming back to the Polish throne, and who that person/family might be.\n\nSigismund II Augustus was the last king of the Jagiellon dynasty, which was actually a branch of the Gediminid dynasty that ruled neighboring Lithuania for centuries.\n\nAlthough this is all only theoretical... if Poland were ever to have a monarchy again, would it be possible that they would draw from the Polish/Lithuanian Jagiellon Gediminids?\n\nOr, because the Poland of today is a Republic, would the country by more inclined to look for families who descend from one of the later elected royal families?\n\nNo matter which past monarch the country would choose to look to... would it matter since any new monarch would still have to be \"elected\" (in some way) by the modern Polish Republic?\n\nPlease share your thoughts!\n\nHi Noble Consort Ming,\n\nYou are right... and yes, I do remember Anna Jagiellon.\n\nShe and her husband had a period of rule right after the Polish King Henry III. Yes, I know Henry doesn't sound like a Polish King's name, however he really existed! Henry was a French royal who was elected the throne of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth... at the end of Sigismund II Augustus' rule.\n\nYou are correct that Anna was born as a Jagiellon, since she was Sigismund II Agustus' sister.\n\nIf my memory serves me correct, however, she was considered as elected to the monarchy like her husband (and so was not what we would commonly call a \"dynastic\" ruler). She was, however, from the same family as the last dynasty, so maybe we can both be correct in a way... since perhaps it just depends how we look at it.\n\nAnna Jagiellon ruled as queen along with her husband... King Stefan Bathory.\n\nI think the Union of Lublin -- which transitioned Poland to elected monarchs -- had already taken place when she became queen (because of her brother Sigismund passing away without any legal heirs).\n\nSo perhaps we are both right. Even though Sigismund II Agustus was the last Jagiellon who technically inherited the throne... one more Jagiellon did sit on the Polish throne as a monarch. It seems she was the country's logical choice to be one of the first elected monarchs, because of the link she provided to the previous dynasty... while at the same time being elected.\n\nShe ended up having an interesting role in Polish history, as a sort of \"transitional\" monarch.\n\nAnyway... I'm probably getting us off topic. Any ideas anyone as to which past dynasties Poland might theoretically look to... if ever re-establishing a type of monarchy? The Jagiellons (who ruled at some of Poland's greatest centuries), or later elected monarchs?\n\nWith all the different elected monarchs that came later... it seems like there might be a greater number of heirs to consider if Poland took that approach. Then again, as they were non-elected monarchs... the Jagiellons would not be in perfect step with the spirit of Poland's Republic government of today.\n\nsupertigerCh,\n\nDespite the fact that my grandfather's family comes from the Polish gentry I have no desire to see Poland a monarchy again. I do think that our best and favorite kings comes from the period of the elected monarchy(I'm thinking Bathory and Sobieski) so electing the person people think could do the best job seems like it could get us a better ruler then just throwing a person up on the throne because of their family tree. Then again we had some crappy elected kings too so I really have no idea. If some people had their way I think they would love to see a Walewski(descendant of Napoleon) on the throne since Poland adores Napoleon. We sing about him in our national anthem(it was a march/song Polish soldiers in his army sang while on the Italian campaign). Even I have a giant portrait of him in my house. We might be the only country that doesn't see him as a tyrant and dictator.\n\nDoes anyone know the titles of some good books on Poland. I havr been researching my husbands family and I have a lot to learn.\n\nWhat type of information are you looking for exactly? It might give me a better idea of what to recommend.\n\nHi all.\n\nA recent feature on an Australian 'news' program (I call it that lightly) claimed that there was a family living here pretending to be descendants of Polish royalty. A quick google search identified a few pages, and a link to this forum. Unfortunately I haven't been able to find any definitive proof. From what I can gather, the guy claims some kind of relationship, albeit distant to some family of note in Poland.\n\nUnfortunately I don't read Polish, so that limits my ability to research the matter.\n\nThis is one of the pages with a history of the families\n\nThe Princely House of Kasperski-Labedz\n\nAny help would be appreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nBobby\n\nThe particular family in the link claims to be part of the noble Kasperski family. Poland had/has non-royal princes. Their connection seems dubious. And they should only be using the surname Kasperski-Łabędź as Łabędź is the clan and coat of arms to which the family belongs and shares with many other noble families and not part of the surname written in this manner.\n\nOn the home page they discuss their history and refer to the old Polish noble families of princely status as royal which they were not. I'm from Poland and my grandfather's family is from the gentry(lower nobility) so I know a little about what I'm talking about.\n\nHis family is an old aristocratic family from Poland, which dates back to the 15th century.\n\nCount Jan Kanty Zamoyski was the seventh and youngest child of Count Andrzej Zamoyski (1852-1927) and of his wife, née Princess Maria Carolina of Bourbon-Two Sicilies (1856-1941). Maria Carolina was a daughter of Prince Francesco di Paola, Count of Trapani, and of his wife, née Archduchess Isabella of Austria, Princess of Tuscany.\n\nTwo of Andrzej and Maria Carolina children married to Bourbon relatives; more precisely, Countess Carolina Zamoyska married to her maternal first cousin Prince Ranieri of Bourbon-Two Sicilies in 1923, and they were the grandparents of the current Duke of Castro. Count Jan Kanty married to his first cousin once removed Infanta Isabel of Spain, Princess of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, who also was a niece of the above mentioned Prince Ranieri.\n\nOf their other five siblings, one died unmarried in his twenties, another brother married to a (German) Countess, by whom he had five children, and the other three sisters married to Polish noblemen.\n\nCount Andrzey was the owner of the Castle of Podzamcze, where in 1926 his grandson Prince Ferdinando of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Duke of Castro, was born.\n\nAnother branch of the Zamoyski family, more precisely the descendants of Andrzey's younger brother Count Adam, owns the magnificien Palace of Kozlowka, which is opened to the public as a museum.\n\nHere is a genealogy of the Zamoyski family:\n\nZamoyski"
