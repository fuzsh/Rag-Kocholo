        "text": "Synopsis:\n\nKing Philip of France and the Duke of Austria, on behalf of Arthur, begin to lay siege to the city of Angiers, property of the English monarch. John and his army arrive. Each king demands that the citizens of Angiers allow the “King of England” to enter, but the citizens ask for proof as to which (John or Arthur) is the true king. When the kings decide to join forces to destroy the city, the citizens propose that the kings instead become allies through a marriage of the French Dauphin Louis to John’s niece Blanche. To further this proposed alliance, John gives up five Continental provinces and makes Arthur Duke of Brittany and Earl of Richmond, while Philip abandons Arthur’s cause.\n\nEnter, before Angiers, ⌜at one side, with Forces,⌝ Philip\n\nKing of France, Louis ⌜the⌝ Dauphin, Constance, Arthur,\n\n⌜and Attendants; at the other side, with Forces,⌝ Austria,\n\n⌜wearing a lion’s skin.⌝\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n0285 Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.—\n\n0286 Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,\n\n0287 Richard, that robbed the lion of his heart\n\n0288 And fought the holy wars in Palestine,\n\n0289 5 By this brave duke came early to his grave.\n\n0290 And, for amends to his posterity,\n\n0291 At our importance hither is he come\n\n0292 To spread his colors, boy, in thy behalf,\n\n0293 And to rebuke the usurpation\n\n0294 10 Of thy unnatural uncle, English John.\n\n0295 Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.\n\nARTHUR\n\n0296 God shall forgive you Coeur de Lion’s death\n\n0297 The rather that you give his offspring life,\n\n0298 Shadowing their right under your wings of war.\n\n0299 15 I give you welcome with a powerless hand\n\n0300 But with a heart full of unstainèd love.\n\n0301 Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.\n\nDAUPHIN\n\n0302 A noble boy.
