        "text": "Just a few notes about 2009. Since I had no holidays for years and a case of guardianship in the family, I decided to do as much as possible short trips across Europe. Unfortunately the reviews I wrote on TripsByTips disappeared. Fortunately I got them back, since I knew the owner. Ensure you save your experiences first offline, before publishing them. Since I wrote my thesis about cultural factors of consumer behavior, I was most impressed by the collective unconsciousness, consciousness, bounded rationality and choice of people and rethorics in normal conversations (memory). From a pychological view it is about self construal. Pathologically it is about delusions, tolerated by the states or not. To enrich your perceptions, clustering and wording might be helpful to use an advisor. Here some simple thoughts about my travel history of 2009:\n\nAmsterdam, 8.4. – 14.4.2009\n\nLiving in a nice guesthouse next to a canel, I was strolling around the city visiting some coffees and doing some shopping. Also amazing for what different reasons people visit the city, some only for Abercrombie, others for budget shopping, some for the flower market, others for the coffee shops or the nightlife. Was impressed by a chinese man, living in Vienna who told me that he is spending every weekend in Amsterdam, because Vienna made him depressive, due to the big white buildings there. He preferred the small red ones. Never heard before that people might feel different in different cities due to the scenery.\n\nPotsdam, 27.4.-29.4.2009\n\nThere I was amazed by how quickly they rebuild the historical city and dealt with the further planning of the area. The reason for the journey was a seminar. I was a bit disappointed they did no team building events outside the hotel.\n\nParis, 30.4.-3.5.2009\n\nWas just in the mood for strolling around in the city and found some clothes for challenging people hardly to find in Germany. Further I discovered some districts in the city I have never visited before, like canal St. Martin a new area for the hipsters.\n\nBerlin, 7.5.-10.5.2009\n\nWent to Berlin for business reasons and added some days to have a change of scenery. Basically I spent most of the time in Charlottenburg, where I was living and exploring Mitte and Prenzlauer Berg, districts undergoing an impressive change. People were discussing the development critically.\n\nCannes, 30.7.-5.8.2009\n\nHaving worked in Nice for some months 14 years ago, I did not manage it to visit Cannes at that time. So we were discovering the beaches in the area and spent most of the evenings in one of the many restaurant along Rue St. Antoine to enjoy the manifold meals and watch the tourist streams walking up and down the alley. Liked some hidden beaches outside, but also the sports beaches within the city and the impressive yachting harbor. One day we went to Nice.\n\nIbiza, 10.9.-24.9.2009\n\nA typical party holiday. I was sleeping most time of the day and visiting the famous clubs at night. Was a bit annoyed that the gods started playing at 2 or 3 o’clock in the morning. On the other hand quite interesting to get up at night and visit one of those dream like spectacles at Amnesia. Feels like finding oneself in another dream. Was meeting people who spent all of their holidays there for decades and found it a bit complicated to enter those well practiced groups. On the other side I met people who avoided to meet somebody of their groups. One day I went to the legendary Cafe del Mar to watch the famous sunsets there. Since it was to busy I went to another place at the promenade.\n\nMadrid, 29.09.-4.10.2009\n\nBeing the first time in this city I was busy with exploring all of its amenities. Was impressed by the massive colonialist merchant and trading houses in the inner city and the pulsating nightlife. One day I spent in the Prado, dealing with european history and the leisure area next to it. Was at a birthday party and amazed, that people were discussing about what language the spanish king should speak, and some people refused to sit at a table where a spanish flag was in the middle, and not the one of their region. A phenomenom to observe probably in most countries.\n\nCopenhagen, 7.10.-11-10.2009\n\nThere I was taking part in the Kulturnatten, where several cultural venues opened their doors and offered manifold events. In the parliament I was amazed by the development of regulations for german and danish minorities in both countries. At the post museum they discussed how many CO2 an email is producing and the dark sides of the technological revolution. Then I visited the royal guards and dealt with their development and function. Later I enjoyed the view over the city from the round tower. The next day I visited the outdoor exhibition “100 places to remember” due to the world climate summit taking place there this year. Then I had a stroll through the autonomous community of Christiania to find out, how they life.\n\nWarsaw, 14.10.-18.10.2009\n\nIn Warsaw I was amazed by the manifold faces of the city reflecting the regimes of the past in close neighbourhood: historical old town, ghetto, socialist and modern area. Was amazed by an exhibition dealing with the fears of polish intellectuals of the westernization of the country in the 80s.\n\nBudapest, 21.10.-27.10.2009\n\nWas visiting Hungary for their national holiday and was surprised by immense national socialist demonstrations within the city, learning about their view of the development in the last decade in Europe. Then I was attending an exhibition of Turner and dealt with the making of his travel sketches and paintings. Apart from that I was doing the obligatory sightseeing, shopping, dining and clubbing.\n\nLondon, 29.10.-2.11.2009\n\nNot having been to London for 20 years I wanted to check, how the city has developed since then. First the typical tourist programm, walking up and down Oxford Street, strolling along the riverside and enjoying the nightlife around Leicester Square. Since having visited Turner already in Budapest the week before, I went to the National Gallery to see his finished oeuvres. Then I discovered the Building Centre and was dealing with New London Architecture especially the London Plan. Loved the British Music Experience Museum for the smart entrance card enabling the storage of what you did and what you have seen.\n\nLisbon, 5.11.-9.11.2009\n\nHaving been there for the first time, I visited all the mayor spots of interest. First I climbed around the old castle, then I had a look at the old town. Was very impressed by the exhibition park, the oceanario and the Vasco da Gama bridge. If I remember it right, I have seen the first self check-out supermarket there. Then I went to the Gulbenkian Foundation and dealt with artistic, social and cultural developments.\n\nBerlin, 11.11.-15.11.2009\n\nBerlin again for a job interview. Living in Prenzlauer Berg for the first time, I explored this part of the city. Liked the many comfortable brunch places.\n\nKrakow, 24.12.2009-7.1.2010\n\nWas taking part in blind booking from Germanwings and got Krakow. The weather was that horrible, that we were not allowed to land. The pilot announced that he would land anyway, because his stewardess wanted to spend christmas there. If he wouldn’t manage it, we could complain with the airline. Holy night I spent in St. Mary’s Basilika famous for the hejnal, new years eve first at the public party on the main square, then in a trendy club. Liked the Kosciuszko Mound outside, the medieval city center, Kazimierz and the many clubs. Crazy history. Still learning about it. I met a bloke who took me to Zakopane, a famous skying resort there, where I went to the hairdresser without understanding a word.\n\nHaving time some years later, I enriched my experiences with additional memories and information in a seperate website. If you visit it, you will find out, that my experiences with all countries are probably unique, and might give you another view than on other sites.\n\nHere a creative option, what you can do in Paris. In 2014 I was focussing on sports and was exploring the city by running. Additionally I spent much time in sporting clubs. For my birthday I was looking for the best club of my network in town, Health CityChamps Elysees, and spent most of the day there. The club in the Galerie des Arcades. was recently taken over by another one, probably due to different business models. Unfortunately the spa area was not that comfortable and spacious, so I did three fitness classes instead, but was loving it. Since most french are not that anglophil they were not participating in the usual LesMills programs but having their own classes and playing their own electronic sounds, to be bought at Fnac next door, remembering me of my youth. Was also loving Healthcity La Motte Piquet, where you can box with passionate women. Finished, you could try some premium food from Maison Verot.\n\nTo keep record of what sportive activities I was doing, I registered with the Fitocracy community some years before. I liked the proposals for further actions, depending on your fitness level, and was sometimes sharing my activities on Facebook, unfortunately without social or monetary reward.\n\nHere my running map of beautiful Paris. I would advise people to do a fighting sport, since people can be quite envious not only for money, but advantage of all sorts. Kajyn is quite good for that.\n\nMaybe there are several possibilities to optimize connectivity and gratifications. A task for companies and other communities. Of course we are living in a world of competition, strength and weaknesses, and people are having concepts of themselves. But in most cases there is probably a discrepancy between imagination and reality. So also regarding this point I hope that artificial intelligence is helping us to bridge this gap, or at least enlighten the confusion about the self and others, imagination and reality. If you want to deal with the fuzzy concepts people and groups might have, check the self-enhancement literature.\n\nHardly to imagine what happened in Paris since Hugh Capet in the last few hundreds years, inclusive the fights about new technologies. There were five world exhibitions in the 19th century and several wars, that destroyed the city. Here a book with postcards from Paris 1900.\n\nHere my France timeline. Maybe someday I will add further experiences:\n\n1979; Colmar; school camp\n\n1980; Strasbourg; City Exploring\n\n1981: Avignon; Palace of the Popes\n\n1983: Paris; City Exploring\n\n1985: Paris; Student Exchange\n\n1985: Crozon; Student Exchange\n\n1987: Paris; Business Travel, Club Mediterranee\n\n1988: Lauterbourg; Excursion\n\n1994: Nice; Business Travel, Simon-Kucher\n\n1994: Paris; Business Travel, Simon-Kucher\n\n1995: Annecy: Business Travel, Simon Kucher\n\n2008; Cannes; Beach Holiday\n\n2009: Paris; Shopping\n\n2010: Paris; Business Travel, eBookers\n\n2013: Paris; Leisure\n\n2014: Paris; Sports\n\nThe cultural heritage of France, is dealing with the development of today’s France from the tribe of the Gauls, already known before the Roman Empire, with its various subdivisions, famous from Asterix and Obelix. The ressistance of Merovech led to the foundation of the first french empire, the Merowingian Dynasty, with different divisions, accepted by some germanic tribes and extended by christianization. Legal base was the transfer of authority over the western Roman Empire by emperor Constantin the Great to the pope. Charlemagne achieved the largest territorial expansion of the Frankish Empire with his strategy. Later the empire was divided into West, Middle and East Francia. All systems developed into feudalism, without roman tax and bureaucracy, leading to the Capetian–Plantagenet rivalry in the western part of West Francia and the hundred years war about hereditary succession. The castles of the Loire Valley are testimonials of that time. Middle Francia was pulled back and forth between both neighbours. A spectacular act was the relocation of the papacy from Rome to Avignon by the capetian dynasty. This led to the first Estates General. Avignon in the Kingdom of Arles, was disputed between the new Holy Roman Empire (former East Francia) and France (former West Francia). By decision of the Council of Constance, the papal seat was moved to Rome again, but the czech leader of the reformation Jan Hus was executed. The further process of state building, centralization and another succession crisis led to the french wars of religions. Both parties received support from external powers. The Bourbon dynasty transfered France from feudalism to capitalism and was an amalgamation of absolutist power that reached its zenith with Louis XIV (l’etat c’est moi). The french revolution (le sang impure) was followed by the First French Republic, that initiated the napoleonic wars and led into a fluctuating array of european coalitions. A new political and constitutional layout of Europe including boundaries was agreed upon in the Congress of Vienna, that declared Napoleon as an outlaw, who returned from his exile on Elba but was banned again. During the Concert of Europe changing alliances were formed again. The Bourbon Restauration was followed by the Second French Republic, initiated by revolutions, and ended by Napoleons nephew Napoleon III, who declared himself emperor of the Second French Empire, that was ended by the Franco-Prussian War. The Third French Republic lasted until the Second World War and comprised regulations about colonialism and the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Under the assistance of the USA the Fourth French Empire was formed, to foster cooperation between both longtime enemies and to prevent another war between both countries. Due to a lack of consensus in the Algeria crisis, the parliamentary system was replaced with a semi-presidential system by Charles de Gaulle, who formed the current Fifth French Republic (timeline french constitutions). The legislative electoral system was changed to a two-round system, with further consequences on the political space in France. The blueprint of France 2030 is intended to improve innovation and further strengthen the position of France in a globalized world, with further implications on the franco-german relationship.\n\nMerken\n\nMerken\n\nMerken\n\nMerken\n\nMerken\n\nMerken\n\nMerken\n\nMerken\n\nSo, what was I doing in London 2013? I have been there from October 26 till December 18. This time I did things I never did before. Much time I spent at Natural History Museum, where I was amazed by the history of the earth and possible projections into the future. Of course a question of the statistics you are using. Also liked the Biodiversity Center, where they still register new species, people find in the nature. Also never was dealing with some medical topics like Endocrinology, they explain quite well.\n\nIn the Science Museum the “Making of the Modern World” exhibition and the Climate Science Info Zone made me think. Liked those carbon footprints, if you want to find out about your massive energy consumption. Then I had a look at the future possibilities of 3D printing.\n\nAlso discovered the Welcome Collection and the Hunterian Museum, where they deal with the cruel history of medicine and future developments. I was drawing a choroid plexus. Then I was thinking about investing 200 Pounds in a MRI scan.\n\nThen I strolled through the major colleges. At Kings I was hypnotized by the ice rink, at UCL I liked digital frontiers and at Imperial I went to a job fair for IT students. All are establishing Farmer Markets and are dealing with much data. Further I visited the UAL and joined some projects they did at Elephant & Castle Shopping Center. Liked this Photomat, were you had to scream to trigger a photo and the artistic visualizations of psychiatric diseases. A wonderful opportunity to realize a hairdresser is necessary.\n\nOf couse I also had to visit the olympic parc and to have a look at the transforming environments and neighbourhoods.\n\nNot to forget my visit at Tate Gallery, where I was impressed by the interactive tools of Bloomberg Connect, where you could “visit” studios of artists all over the world. Further I contributed a digital artwork by drawing the view to the City of London from there.\n\nAlso the first time I went from London to Paris via the Eurotunnel by bus without knowing what was expecting me. Quite interesting, to sit in a bus, the bus drives into a cargo container, the container is put on a train and you travel under the channel (well described here). I felt like a product.\n\nMaybe some day I will digitalize the super 8 movies, I did as a teenager, to tell you about my first stays in London, reporting proudly that I stood the passage on the ferry with vomit of other people dropping from the stairways onto my head, due to the stormy weather conditions on the channel. Or in a plane, that nearly collapsed due to unpredictable weather in this short distance. Also have to integrate the photos from my victorian phase I had during my stay in London 2011. Maybe I am also going to tell you about my other visits in this amazing city.\n\nHere my travel history:\n\n1982: School, Tunbridge Wells\n\n1984: School, Denmark Hill\n\n1989: Work Experience, Chelsea\n\n2009: City Trip, Westminster\n\n2010: Business Travel, Westminster\n\n2010: Business Travel, Westminster\n\n2013: General Education, Camden\n\nUnfortunately I never had electric devices with me. So maybe I add some relevant thoughts later to this chapter as well.\n\nMy personal experiences and feelings regarding Amsterdam are very diverse. Let me start with the most positive one: The flower market. I went twice to Amsterdam, just in order to buy a Ficus tree for my living room.\n\nMany people appreciate Amsterdam for the liberal culture symbolized by the coffee shops and red light districts. 1996 I had a blackout due to low sugar levels, because I spent the whole day at the wonderful beach of Sandfort without eating something and went to Amsterdam later. The ambulance came, gave me some meds and it was over. So never forget eating and drinking, you are not a camel.\n\nCompared to that I had a blackout in Cologne in 2002. they brought me to a psychiatrist, who had no idea what to diagnose, but wanted me to take medication for several years. He insisted in a psychosis. Due to this medication I had a lasting change of personality and consciousness, not enabling me to leave Cologne for years. 2006 I made a new try to go visit Amsterdam and had to turn around before entering the city. After stopping this medication I visited Amsterdam in 2009, where I still had problems to take part in normal life.\n\nRecovered and dealing with psychiatric medication and diagnoses in 2013, I found out, that they may control and condition behavior of all people in responsibility of their hospital ill or not in some jurisdictions. They may also have the right to abuse people for political objectives or an employer. Since I did not agree with my conditioning, I was asked to leave Germany twice in 2013. Both times I had to flee to the Netherlands because it was the closest border from my home. Unfortunately the political hospitals have also access to people abroad. The first time I fled to Maastricht, there suddenly all coffee machines were black children. I wet to a psychiatric hospital there, that refused help. Then I fled to Switzerland to a hospital, that also refused help. Obviously they are in competition with the police in some juristictions regarding criminal prosecution.\n\nBack in Germany I was asked another time to leave the country in 2013. Then I went to Amsterdam. This time it was nearly not possible for me to leave the hotel, since they went against everything in the city. I managed it to the airport. There they induced all sorts of hallucinations, to avoid me entering a plane. I walked around in this airport for one week, and had no idea what to do. Somebody approached me and said: “Only think about one sentence: My father was an architect, my other was a worker”. I made it back to Germany with this help.\n\nMy learning from this story is to deal intensively with international public, private and special laws before this cases might arise and when going abroad. There might be different procedures in administrative districts, countries and subcultures within them. Choose the place you are living and your employer accordingly. Check the reports of the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) for details. 40 per cent of countries don’t have mental healthcare. If not dealing with those questions, you might loose all your property and your life due to the rights of political hospitals in some countries. Being in a foreign country, the guest country should have the possibility to intervene.
