        "text": "Duke Maximilian, of the House of Wittelsbach married Ludovika, a royal Princess of Bavaria and they were an eccentric family. His passions were: horses, women, music, books and the circus. He was often away pursuing these passions but they had 8 children. Max taught the girls to ride side saddle from both sides, by altering the position of the pummel, and with no stirrups. Their lives were very free in the family home at Castle Possenhoffen in the beautiful alpine countryside.\n\nElizabeth was their third child, born on Christmas eve in 1837 and had the most skill at horsemanship as she had a great sympathetic relationship with the horses. Her elder sister, Helene (born 1834) was however the one chosen by the Archduchess Sophie and her mother as a probable wife for the new emperor. She was sufficiently intelligent and, importantly, could be obedient to Sophie. Also the Habsburgs needed to secure blood ties with Bavaria. So, a meeting was arranged in August 1853 at Bad Ischl in Austria where Ludovika took Helene and Elizabeth to meet Franz Joseph and his mother. Unfortunately the Emperor could not resist a pretty face and immediately decided that Elizabeth should be his wife. Helene would have been far better suited as she was quieter, obedient and mentally stable and the history of Europe would probably have been quite different.\n\nThe marriage was arranged for the following April 24th when Sisi (as Elizabeth had always been called) was sixteen years old and they were married in Vienna amongst great pomp and formality. He was too young, humourless and a slave to the enormous task of ruling the Habsburg empire. But as the heir to 600 years of pomp and privilege and the right to rule a vast empire he was not a suitable husband for a young girl from a free and easy background. She immediately hated the formality of court life and pined for her early life. The antipathy between her and her aunt Sophie was very great. Sophie was a slave to duty and Sisi hated all the balls, ceremony, protocol and staff that had been chosen for her household from suitable Viennese families with whom she had nothing in common. Her only escape was to the royal stables. Franz Joseph would not interfere between his mother and Sisi and felt his mother had to be obeyed."
