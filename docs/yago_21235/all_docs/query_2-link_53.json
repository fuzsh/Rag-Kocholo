Two short works for piano, inspired by Polish folk music, which in turn inspired Franz Liszt.\n\nOn the same oblong 12-line sheet of paper, Chopin carefully inscribed in brown ink a 24-bar Allegretto (“Alltto”) in A major, then in “Minor” (as Chopin wrote), on 3 systems of 2 staves; then after a staff left blank, a 14-bar “Mazur” (Mazurka) (18 bars with reprise) in 3/4 D minor, on 2 systems. Each piece is signed with a double “Ch” at the end of the staves (four times in total).\n\nJean-Jacques Eigeldinger, who dates this page around 1832-1833, has not been able to identify in the Polish songbooks the melodies of these short piano works inspired to Chopin by the popular music of his native country; but he points out that “his memory was marked by such songs from his earliest years,” and that the harmonization is entirely Chopinian. He also pointed out that this modest Allegretto has left its mark on Franz LISZT’s work: in the Duo-Sonata for violin and piano S 127, and in No. 2 of Woronince’s Glanes for piano S 249. In the portfolio containing this precious manuscript, the signatures of Arthur Rubinstein (1931) and Vladimir Horowitz (1978) were mounted, who probably admired it.\n\nBibliography: first published by Jean-Jacques Eigeldinger, “Un autographe musical inédit de Chopin,” Schweizerische Musikzeitung / Revue musicale suisse, CXV/1 (January-February 1975), pp. 18-23; Krystyna Kobylanska, Frédéric Chopin: Thematisch-bibliographisches Werkverzeichnis (1979), no.
