Having studied economics and been voted Sweden’s best sommelier in 1986, Hans went on to work in the hospitality industry. During this period he established the Swedish Sommelier Association and helped create “Grythytteakademin”, the first academically based wine and food education programme in Sweden, and where today one can graduate with a doctorate.\n\nHans continued to gain invaluable experience in the international wine world, working as Director and Vice President of Sales for Peter Lehmann Wines, and thereafter assuming the role of General Manager for Hess Family Estates, spanning four continents and seven wineries.\n\nIn recent years, Hans has become a member of the acclaimed Académie du Vin (AIV).\n\nSTEPHEN COWLEY\n\nCEO\n\nStephen grew up in Constantia and graduated from the University of Cape Town with a Bachelor of Business Science Degree and a Post Graduate Diploma in Accounting.\n\nHe registered as Chartered Accountant (SA) after completing his training contract and qualifying exams whilst at Deloitte Cape Town.

He became the CEO in 2020 with his focus on local operations.\n\nMATTHEW DAY\n\nWINEMAKER\n\nMatthew grew up in Johannesburg, but a keen interest in winemaking saw him relocate to the Cape to pursue an education in this field.

In 2012 he stepped up and took the reins as winemaker – becoming only the third winemaker since the farm was revived in the 1980s. Already voted as one of The Drinks Business’s Top 30 winemakers under 40 to watch, Matthew has also been named Tim Atkin’s Young winemaker of the year for 2016.\n\nCRAIG HARRIS\n\nViticulturist\n\nCraig’s interest and passion for wine began in 2001 but his instinct for farming stems from his teens, growing up and participating in chores on a working family farm.\n\nHis viticulturist experience to date has been in the cooler climate areas of Hemel-en-Aarde Valley and Elgin where he worked for Bouchard Finlayson and Paul Cluver Wines, respectively.\n\nFocussing on Pinot noir, Chardonnay and Sauvignon blanc, his repertoire expanded to include Riesling, Gewürztraminer and Shiraz. Craig has participated in a harvest in Burgundy and has experience working in vineyards in Alsace.\n\nHis interest and experience with aromatic varieties and dessert wines makes Klein Constantia the perfect place for Craig to be."
