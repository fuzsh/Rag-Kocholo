The first turn the players will also need to do research about their factions, if needed with each others' assistance. The outcome of actions is decided at the end of each chapter/turn. Rules and more details about the system is listed at the bottom of this post.\n\nPROLOGUE\n\nThe year is 1603. After the defeat of the Armada and the de facto independence of the Netherlands, Spain is no longer the major power in Europe. England has through diplomacy and warfare successfully prevented many invasions and with it's colonies and fleet become a power of considerable importance after a century of internal problems. The newly independent Netherlands have developed very effective trade and is a flourishing nation with an untraditional power structure, open-mindedness to trade and an effective fleet, but with limited offensive capabilities. The Holy roman empire is comparatively stable, even though many external threats are in the process of building up. Russia has gone from being a number of smaller principalities occupied by mongols to, under the leadership of Muscovy, become a large empire intent on expanding further west. The Ottoman empire might be expanding well inland, but their naval domination has been limited since the battle of Lepanto many decades earlier.\n\nIt is a time when many nations are about equal in power, but also a time of instability where the strategies of the leaders could have huge consequences and make one nation insignificant, while another becomes an empire.\n\nMap of 1600 AD: http://www.euratlas.com/big/big1600.htm\n\nTasks for this turn:\n\n1. first choose a faction to play as (England, France, HRE, Poland, Spain, Sweden). After choosing faction, make a post in this thread to reserve that faction. The first who posts that he wants a certain faction gets that faction.\n\n2. make some research about your faction. This information will be available to all players, and is later to be used to plan your strategies. The knowledge about what happened after 1603 is supposed to be used to better understand the present situation in 1603, not to be abused as hindsight - I'll deliberately lay out the story in a way that prevents hindsight that couldn't have been known at the time from having any effect (after the first chapters it'll become clear what I mean by this). Things to research:\n\na. name of your leader, and of the living heirs of your leader\n\nb. your current alliances in 1603. Look at which alliances were broken in the coming 50 years and why, to try and find information about the nature and strength of the alliances at this time\n\nc. current pacts/leagues (with pact I mean a bunch of nations all in alliance with each others, the pacts must also be public whereas alliances can be of a more secret character)\n\nd. current wars that your nation is engaged in\n\ne. regions that historically rebelled against your nation during the period 1603 to around 1648, and why. Did any of the rebellions happen at critical times during wars with outside nations, or did the rebellions for other reasons have greater effect than their military strength alone would imply?\n\nf. a list of the major military campaigns, crucial economical conflicts and other major events during the period 1603 to around 1648 for your nation\n\ng. in 1603, how is your army organized? how many men are available through conscription? how many men constitute a standing army? what equipment and training have they got? how is the quality of the artillery? and how did these things change in the coming 50 years?\n\nh. how well is your nation doing economically? are you in debt or is the economy flourishing? which are the key strategic locations that gives you income? tax, trade routes/tolls, farming or industries? How many people live in your realm?\n\ni. which countries are your major trading partners at this time and what products do they buy/sell from/to you?\n\nj. how centralized is rule? what is your role as leader? military defender of your people? reformer? if your rule isn't centralized, is local unhappiness most directed towards you or the local rulers?\n\nk. what is your leader's religion? what is the stance of different religions in your nation - acceptance, tolerance, non-tolerance or persecution?\n\nl. what's the social situation for farmers, workers etc.? are they in a position to rebel over their social situations?\n\nm. are there any provinces of your nation that are eager to break off and form an own country? i.e. Portugal for Spain etc.\n\nPLAYERS\n\nHere the players commanding the nations will be listed for reference when during play you need to contact them by PM for diplomatic deals.\n\nEngland - Fisherking\n\nFrance - Swordsmaster\n\nHRE and Austria - Arjos\n\nSpain - Prince Cobra\n\nNetherlands - El Barto\n\nPoland - Free (formally Csargo)\n\nSweden - Free (Formally autolycos)\n\nRULES/INFO ABOUT HOW THE INTERACTIVE WORKS\n\n- Your objectives: the objective is to achieve as much as possible in all these fields: conquest of provinces, conquest of strategic positions, strengthening the economy and controlling trade, having an appearance of strength and determination to outside threats by successfully defending and counter-attacking aggressors, have a good diplomatic rumor, and help spread whatever religion you choose. All these factors will be added together and the factions which achieved most in all these aspects will be winners by the end of the game.\n\n- First turn - in the prologue turn you'll not make any decisions but only do research about your faction.\n\n- How to play - every turn, I'll list questions about the most relevant matters for the player to decide about. However, each turn it's also possible to decide about things that aren't listed under that turn. Examples of things that you can decide are listed here for reference during the game:\n\n* thing made publicly in this thread:\n\na. declaring war\n\nb. hiring mercenaries\n\nc. propaganda - if your nation wants to use propaganda actions it's posted as a public proclamation in the public thread. This can also be a general call for, say \"the Catholic cause\" etc. but also actions for your own population. Normal actions that aren't explicit propaganda can also have propaganda effects.\n\nd. choosing stance on religion, and the leader's religion - this will affect relations with the pope, relations with other countries, relations with local rulers etc.\n\n* things made by sending a PM to me that turn (sometimes this information risks to leak out to the public forum):\n\ne. reorganizing your army - this is made by PM, but info will leak out\n\nf. diplomatic discussions - it'll always leak out that a meeting has taken place, but very seldom what was said during the meeting, unless the two parts wish to make an official proclamation as result of the meeting. Because some of the diplomatic correspondence can leak out, try to make the PMs with historical phrasing, and it's also a good reason to, even if you're planning on backstabbing, not expressing such things too explicitly in the PMs... The diplomatic discussion in a turn may only be carried out as a series of max 3 PMs, i.e. 1. offer, 2. counter-offer/accept/decline, 3. accept/decline/counter-offer to consider for next turn/suggest discussions continue next turn. The reason for this rule is to make the discussion fast enough to not delay chapters, but also to simulate some of the difficulties of diplomatic discussion and not make the diplomacy an overly effective tool. The PMs from the correspondence should be sent to me by PM each turn so I know which deals took place so I can determine the outcome of the turn.\n\ng. choosing where to launch offensives and which tactics and key targets to use - you're allowed make very complex strategies with conditional plans and diversions etc. Just remember it must be logistically feasible within the length of the chapter. Also remember that pushing soldiers too hard can result in undisciplined behavior, mutiny and desertion etc.\n\nh. starting war without formal declaration\n\ni. determining what to do about rebels - you decide which and how many troops, what tactics they are to use etc. I'll ask more specific questions and give the suitable player options for how to act when a rebellion takes place\n\nj. choosing whether to use your own leader in combat - using the leader in combat can boost morale, but also keeps him away from home which may be tempting to some rebels, and it also puts him at the risk of dying in action. If the leader has gone to the front, the other nations will know it before long through hints in the public thread (this thread).\n\n* other decisions:\n\nk. you can decide about almost anything you can think of that isn't very historically unlikely, say send away mercenaries without pay, choose whether to kill prisoners of war or not, etc. etc. Those decisions can be sent to me by PM. Bear in mind that every character affected by your decisions has some form of power which he can use against you.\n\nI'll be the HRE/Austria, by the evening I'll have the research done ;)\n\nedit:\n\n- Leader: Rudolf II, several illegitimate children (Julius, Karl, Charlotte, Matthias, Anna Dorothea, Dorothea), alive brothers (Matthias, Maximilian III, Albert VII), alive first cousins (Ferdinand II, Maximilian Ernest, Leopold V, Charles II).\n\n- Allies: Spain, very strong, ruled by a branch of the same house.\n\nDuchy of Modena and Reggio (Cesare d'Este), strong, supported his claim during a succession war. Duchy of Mantua (Vincenzo Gonzaga), strong, dynastic ties. Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (Sigismund III Vasa), strong, desire by Sigismund to centralise power.\n\nWallachia (Radu Șerban), Moldavia (Ieremia Movilă), Zaporizhian Bazavluk Sich (Ivan Kosyi), Grand Duchy of Tuscany (Ferdinando I), Duchy of Savoy (Carlo Emanuele I), Republic of Ragusa (Marin Tudišević), Papal States (Clement VIII) and Serbian Hajduk due to common league against the Ottoman Turks.\n\n- Pacts/Leagues: Holy Alliance against the Turks.\n\n- Current Wars: Long Turkish War, mainly over the possession of Wallachia, Transylvania and Moldavia.\n\n- Rebellions: Bocskai Uprising in 1604-1606 due to Rudolf II accusing Hungarian nobles of treason and war weariness.\n\nHabsburg \"succession crisis\", not a rebellion per se, but the Habsburg house was not pleased with Rudolf's tolerance and when later Rudolf fell ill his brother Matthias was made head of the house and the latter used a personal army to force Rudolf to yield the rule of more and more territories from 1608 until 1611, when he effectively became ruler in all but name. Matthias was also looking to strengthen the empire by tolerance, but without heirs he was eventually forced to nominate the later Ferdinand II as successor, backed by the other brother Maximillian, leading the inflexible Catholic faction within the family. This led to the following.\n\nBohemian Revolt in 1618, following the defenestration, it was the first of the religious rebellions, which started to spread across Europe, due to the policies of the intransigent Ferdinand II, who panicked and called for international support, eventually bringing the intervention of other powers, losing any religious ideals as the cause of the conflicts (since the revolts were generally dealt with and never expanded beyond their local areas), escalating as the Thirty Years War.\n\n- Major Campaigns: Long Turkish War (29 July 1593 – 11 November 1606), within of course was also the Bocskai uprising.\n\nWar of the Jülich Succession (10 June 1609 – 24 October 1610 and May 1614 – 13 October 1614).\n\nThirty Years War (1618 - 1648), with also its peripheral conflicts like the Bohemian Revolt (1618 - 1620) and the War of the Mantuan Succession (1628 - 1631).\n\n- Army: the imperial army was attached to the person of the emperor, who could raise troops directly only in imperial cities and his personal domain. This was structured in regiments, between 1,200 and 2,000 men each, costing every year 260,000 florins for infantry, 450,000 florins for cavalry and 600,000 florins for artillery. It is difficult to determine the size of the Habsburg standing army, since the concept pretty much took off with the Thirty Years War, but for example in 1601 35,000 men and 40 cannons were mustered. While later Ferdinand II agreed to raise 20,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry under Wallenstein. By 1628 the imperial army numbered 110,000 men, a fifth being cavalry.\n\nThe electoral states were largely autonomous and it was the Imperial Diet that could muster the army of the Holy Roman Empire, whose contingents had been fixed at around 20,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry. This was called a Simplum, and its upkeep stood at 10 florins for cavalrymen and at 8 florins for infantrymen. During wars the number could be doubled or tripled, in theory even more, by calling extra contingents (the Duplum and Triplum). Indeed by 1681 the Simplum consisted of 28,000 infantry, 2,000 dragoons and 10,000 cavalry. Nevertheless this force due to political differences could hardly be called upon, especially because the nobles and the clergy were reluctant in parting with their workforce.\n\n- Economy: Europe was slowly experiencing the transition from a predominantly agrarian economy to a monetary and market economy. Indeed all the conflicts of the time required money to pay for the soldiers and the control over taxation became vital. The Habsburg Empire had a populous and productive manufacturing center in Bohemia, complemented by textile and iron industries in Upper Austria and Styria. While the Hungarian plain, the Archduchies and Silesia provided a firm agricultural base. Moreover the resources from mountainous territories made the Habsburgs one of Europe's foremost producers of key minerals. However the regional economies tended to operate independently and were not yet integrated in a single economic policy, but this was mainly due to the political administration of the empire.\n\nIssues were the shift of trading routes towards the Atlantic, influx of American gold and silver, plus the increased Swedish extraction of copper and iron. Together with the war weariness in Hungary and the constant Turkish raids. Overall the economy in the previous century had focused on commodity production, ignoring investments in the manufacturing, as a result, when the downturn in Europe at the start of the 17th century brought a decline of 50% in grain and livestock prices, the economy of the empire lost a good chunk of its income, this being felt particularly in Hungary. To contrast this the noble landowners strove to maximize productivity, increasing the number of days the serfs had to work for them and by starting small cottage textile industries. The lords also imposed that the peasants use mills, breweries and other facilities within their own domains, so that they could buy the products at lower rates and then export them through their own agents at the market price. They could also force their peasants to make purchases in their own towns, causing the imperial free towns to also lose business. Indeed the imperial free towns were losing the favour of the emperor and in Austria and Hungary all together came to have just a single vote in the Diet, while the magnates were gaining individual representation.\n\n- Trading Partners: productive areas mostly focused on trading the the German states, but also overall trading with English and Dutch middlemen.\n\n- Centralisation: although having to deal with the framework in place within the empire, the figure of the emperor was quite strong. Generally uncontested, however the emperor relied on the cooperation with the electoral princes and the Spanish Habsburg House to preserve prominence. Troubles arose with emperors like Ferdinand II, whose pro-Catholic position made it impossible to keep friendly terms with most princes. Also the choice by Rudolf II and Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria, to reestablish Catholicism in 1607 and the later decision by the Imperial Diet in 1608 to restore catholic land as it was at the time of the Peace of Augsburg caused the establishment of the Protestant Union (internally split between Lutheranism and Calvinism), which was answered by the formation of the Catholic League.\n\n- Religion: in theory Rudolf II was a Roman Catholic, being also forcefully raised at the Spanish court, but he was very tolerant and held more occult and scientific interests. He rejected a lot of aspects of the Catholic life and supported different political lines, when it comes to religious matters, depending on his needs.\n\n- Social Status of Farmers and Workers: as noted here there was a patchwork of serfs and freemen, but with little representation. Overall without a prince taking their side, the commoners really couldn't do anything.\n\n- Possible Break-off Regions: not really any in particular at this time. In the eastern territories it was more of a matter of whose side provided more benefits to the local nobility between the Habsburgs and the Ottomans. While Protestant territories became rebellious with the change in policies by Matthias and the ascension of Ferdinand II.\n\nRecruitment:\n\nDuring the game you might want to increase your armed forces to vitiate the evil plans of your opponents or to foster your own evil plans.\n\nAs we all know, money is the root of all evils and this is especially true at the 17th century. If you want to have an army, you have to pay them.\n\nSo if you have some money to spent, here is how you can recruit troops. I think it is plain to see that Europe needs a common currency so I introduces the gulden.\n\nFirst of all the land forces. These are based on foot soldiers, let' call them lansquenets. To raise a new regiment (about 3.000 men), you appoint a colonel and give him the money to recruit a new regiment. The colonel then will go to a certain area, this could be a part of your country, but you may also recruit regiments from abroad, esp. from Switzerland, Germany or Italy. Here he gathers volunteers and equips them.\n\nPractically you give the order to form such a regiment, pay the money (300.000 gulden) and at the end of the year, the new regiment will be ready for service. A regiment has a standard mixture of different weapons, halberds, swords, pike, archebuses etc. Of course you may want to change this, but other equipment may raise the costs.\n\nPlease note that you will have to keep on paying the same price each year as long as you want the regiment fight for you. And be careful if you disband troops, cause this might also cause trouble.\n\nOf course you may also want to recruit cavalry, the most noble branch of service. In principle, it is the same, however, the regiments are smaller (500) and the price is 500,000 per year.\n\nLast but not least there is the new branch of artillery - although you may say that this is certainly something a Christian sovereign should keep his hands off – others may use them. Artillery is extremely expensive. Therefore, an artillery regiment of 100 men with four guns costs 150,000 per year. Please note that there is a limit in increasing the numbers of guns in your army due to the capacity of your casting houses.\n\nSome of you may also want to extend their military actions to the sea. Alright, there are two different ship types available, Great Ships, galleons mounting 38 guns and\n\nSmall Ships with 28 guns. They cost 300,000 and 200,000 per year. Building takes on year and is limited to the capacity of your ship yards.\n\nAdditionally to your regular troops you may also want to have some city guards. These are free, but they have a limited fighting power and the more men are in service the less are working and paying taxes.\n\nSome countries have special troops with special regulations, like Polish hussarias. We will find a way to handle this.\n\nMoney\n\nBy now you may realize that money is something you would like to have. There are basically several ways to get money. First of all there is the income from taxes and customs. However, if taxes are too high, this may cause unrest or people may leave the country. Therefore it may be better to support the growth of your economy. You may make trade agreements with other countries, but keep in mind that custom fees are an important source for money.\n\nTrade is everywhere in Europe, but the most important areas are the Mediterranean and the Baltic Sea as well as the Oversea Trade across the Atlantic. Military conflicts may interrupt trade routes and lead to less income.\n\nSome of you may have a kind of constitution, which limits their ability to raise taxes.\n\nThere are two other sources for money, though. First of all you may find an ally, who does not want to get involved directly into your wars but may be willing to support you with gold. As said before, money is as good as soldiers. And if you are successful, you may have rich prey or may force the enemy to pay tribute.\n\nSo get yourself some money and have fun.\n\nBy he way, I will send you the status of your forces and your finances soon. Do not worry if you think you do not have enough soldiers, you may recruit more. And do not be too happy if you have a big army, you will have to pay for it."
