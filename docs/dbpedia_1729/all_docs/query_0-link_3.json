        "text": "What is neurosyphilis?\n\nNeurosyphilis is an infection that affects the coverings of the brain, the brain itself, or the spinal cord. It can occur in people with syphilis, especially if their condition is left untreated. Neurosyphilis is different from syphilis. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) with different signs and symptoms. There are five types of neurosyphilis:\n\nAsymptomatic neurosyphilis means that neurosyphilis is present, but the individual reports no symptoms and does not feel sick.\n\nMeningeal syphilis can occur between the first few weeks to the first few years of getting syphilis. Individuals with meningeal syphilis can have headache, stiff neck, nausea, and vomiting. Sometimes there can also be loss of vision or hearing.\n\nMeningovascular syphilis causes the same symptoms as meningeal syphilis but affected individuals also have strokes. This form of neurosyphilis can occur within the first few months to several years after infection.\n\nGeneral paresis can occur between three to 30 years after getting syphilis. People with general paresis can have personality or mood changes.\n\nTabes dorsalis is characterized by pains in the limbs or abdomen, failure of muscle coordination, and bladder disturbances. Other signs include vision loss, loss of reflexes and loss of sense of vibration, poor gait, and impaired balance. Tabes dorsalis can occur anywhere from five to 50 years after initial syphilis infection.\n\nGeneral paresis and tabes dorsalis are now less common than the other forms of neurosyphilis because of advances made in prevention, screening, and treatment. People with HIV/AIDS are at higher risk of having neurosyphilis.\n\nPenicillin, an antibiotic, is used to treat syphilis. Some medical professionals recommend another antibiotic called ceftriaxone for neurosyphilis treatment. Treatment outcomes are different for every person.\n\nPrognosis can change based on the type of neurosyphilis and how early the disease is diagnosed and treated. Individuals with asymptomatic neurosyphilis or meningeal neurosyphilis usually return to normal health. People with meningovascular syphilis, general paresis, or tabes dorsalis usually do not return to normal health, although they may get much better. Individuals who receive treatment many years after they have been infected have a worse prognosis.\n\nHow can I or my loved one help improve care for people with neurosyphilis?\n\nConsider participating in a clinical trial so clinicians and scientists can learn more about neurosyphilis and related disorders. Clinical research uses human volunteers to help researchers learn more about a disorder and perhaps find better ways to safely detect, treat, or prevent disease.\n\nAll types of volunteers are needed—those who are healthy or may have an illness or disease—of all different ages, sexes, races, and ethnicities to ensure that study results apply to as many people as possible, and that treatments will be safe and effective for everyone who will use them."
