        "text": "Overview\n\nSyphilis develops in four stages. Each stage has a different set of symptoms.\n\nPrimary stage\n\nDuring the primary stage of syphilis, one or more sores (chancres) form at the site where the bacteria entered the body. This often occurs within 3 weeks of exposure but can range from 10 to 90 days. A person is contagious during the primary stage and can easily pass the infection to others.\n\nA chancre often appears in the genital area. But sores may also occur in or near the anus or in or near the mouth. The sores are usually painless and raised. They may go unnoticed.\n\nSwelling of the lymph nodes may occur near the area of the chancre.\n\nThe chancre usually lasts for 3 to 6 weeks. It heals without treatment and may leave a thin scar. But even though the chancre has healed, the person still has syphilis. They can still pass the infection to others.\n\nSecondary stage\n\nDuring secondary syphilis, a person is contagious. A rash may appear 2 to 12 weeks after the chancre develops and sometimes before it heals. The rash often forms over the body, often on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet.\n\nThe rash usually consists of reddish brown, small, solid, flat or raised skin sores that are less than 2 cm (0.8 in.) across. But the rash may look like other more common skin problems.\n\nIn people who have darker skin, the sores may be a lighter colour than the skin around them.\n\nThere may be small, open sores on mucous membranes. The sores may contain pus. Or there may be moist sores that look like warts (called condyloma lata).\n\nThe skin rash usually heals within 2 months on its own without scarring. After the rash heals, the skin may be discoloured. But even though the skin rash has healed, the person still has syphilis and can still pass it to others.\n\nOther symptoms may also occur. The person may have:\n\nA fever.\n\nA sore throat.\n\nA vague feeling of weakness or discomfort throughout the body.\n\nWeight loss.\n\nPatchy hair loss, especially in the eyebrows, eyelashes, and scalp hair.\n\nSwelling of the lymph nodes.\n\nHeadaches.\n\nLatent (hidden) stage\n\nWithout treatment, an infected person will progress to the latent (hidden) stage. During this stage, the bacteria that cause syphilis stay in the body without causing symptoms. This time with no symptoms usually happens after the secondary-stage rash goes away. But the latent stage can also happen between the primary and secondary stage. It may last for years.\n\nOften during this stage, an accurate diagnosis can only be made through blood testing, the person's history, or the birth of a child with congenital syphilis.\n\nSome people have a relapse of the infection during its latent stage. A relapse means that the person was symptom-free but then started having symptoms again. Relapses can occur several times.\n\nWhen relapses no longer occur, a person isn't contagious through contact. But those who are pregnant may still pass the infection to their baby. They may have a miscarriage or a stillbirth. Or their baby may be born infected (congenital syphilis).\n\nTertiary (late) stage\n\nIf a person doesn't get treatment, late (tertiary) syphilis can develop. It may start several years after someone was first infected. A person with syphilis may never have this stage of the illness.\n\nDuring this stage, syphilis may cause serious blood vessel and heart problems, mental disorders, blindness, nerve system problems, and even death. The symptoms of tertiary syphilis depend on the complications that develop. They may include:"
