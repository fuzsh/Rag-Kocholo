        "meta_description": "Objectives This study aimed to describe the clinical features of neurosyphilis in Chinese patients in an attempt to find clinical features that are helpful for the early identification of neurosyphilis.\n\nMethods This retrospective study included people with syphilis who visited Shanghai Skin Disease Hospital between January 2010 and December 2020. Lumbar puncture was performed on those who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The diagnosis of neurosyphilis was based on clinical and laboratory findings. The parameters were analysed statistically.\n\nResults Of the 3524 patients with neurosyphilis, 2111 (59.9%) and 1413 (40.1%) were asymptomatic and symptomatic neurosyphilis, respectively. General paresis was the most common type of symptomatic neurosyphilis (46.8%). The clinical manifestations of symptomatic neurosyphilis include psychiatric and neurotic symptoms, among which general paresis predominantly presented as psychiatric symptoms such as affective (66.7%) and memory disorder (72.9%). Tabes dorsalis is often presented as neurotic symptoms. One hundred fifty patients (10.6%) with symptomatic neurosyphilis presented candy signs, a rare and specific neurosyphilis symptom that is common in general paresis. Girdle sensation was presented in 13 patients, mainly with tabes dorsalis, which had not been reported in previous studies.\n\nConclusions Notably, the candy sign is identified as a specific symptom of general paresis, while girdle sensations are highlighted as a particular symptom of tabes dorsalis. This is the largest study describing the clinical spectrum of neurosyphilis since the onset of the penicillin era and could help doctors learn more about the disease. A comprehensive description of the possible clinical manifestations of late symptomatic neurosyphilis, particularly highlighting rare symptoms, can identify suspicious patients and prevent diagnostic delays.\n\nAll data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as supplementary information.",

        "text": "Diagnosis and classification of neurosyphilis\n\nThe diagnosis of neurosyphilis was based on clinical and laboratory findings. Peripheral venous blood was collected from all patients.\n\nPeople with syphilis underwent LP in accordance with the Chinese national guidelines12 under the following conditions: (1) they presented with neurological or psychiatric symptoms; (2) they did not exhibit neurological or psychiatric symptoms, if: (a) non-treponemal test titres of patients experiencing treatment failure did not decrease by at least fourfold within 12 months after therapy, or their non-treponemal test titres shift from negative to positive or increased by more than fourfold compared with the latest treatment levels, and (b) the patient requested neurosyphilis evaluation due to persistent positive results on the non-treponemal test (ie, the test remains positive despite a sustained decline) after at least a year of anti-syphilitic treatment. Under the collaborative diagnostic assessment of multidisciplinary medical professionals, an LP was considered beneficial to uncover the progress of the disease.\n\nNeurosyphilis was defined according to the following criteria, referencing both the Chinese national guidelines and the US/European guidelines:13–18(1) Reactive treponema and non-treponema tests in peripheral blood (screening for syphilis using rapid plasma reagin (RPR) test and confirmed by TPPA test), along with a reactive CSF-venereal disease research laboratory (CSF-VDRL) and CSF- TPPA tests; (2) when the CSF-VDRL test yielded non-reactive results, but a reactive CSF-TPPA test was present along with either or both of the following: (1) elevated CSF-protein (>50 mg/dL); (2) WBC count (>10 cells/µL) in the absence of other known causes of these abnormalities. The classification of symptomatic neurosyphilis was defined as the combination of clinical symptoms or signs consistent with neurosyphilis without other known causes for the clinical abnormalities and in accordance with the laboratory diagnostic criteria for neurosyphilis. Patients who suffered from more than two clinical types were defined as multiple types. Asymptomatic neurosyphilis was defined as conforming to the laboratory diagnosis of neurosyphilis without clinical symptoms or signs.\n\nDemographic characteristics\n\nBetween 2010 and 2020, a total of 71 484 cases of syphilis were referred to and/or diagnosed in our STD outpatient department. 3524 eligible participants (neurosyphilis) were included in this analysis. Among those who were diagnosed with neurosyphilis, 1413 (40.1%) patients were with symptomatic neurosyphilis and 2111 (59.9%) were with asymptomatic neurosyphilis, respectively. General paresis was the leading underlying symptomatic neurosyphilis (661, 46.8%) while other underlying symptomatic neurosyphilis, in descending order, were patients with multiple types (478, 33.8%), tabes dorsalis (174, 12.3%), meningovasculitis (81, 5.7%), gummatous syphilis (11, 0.8%) and meningeal syphilis (8, 0.6%) (figure 1). Among them, patients with multiple types were mainly characterised by general paresis combined with tabes dorsalis (370, 77.4%).\n\nDuring the 11-year study period, there was a marked predominance of males (online supplemental figure 1A and table 1); the highest male-to-female ratio for patients with neurosyphilis occurred in 2011 (ratios: 3.4; 104 to 31). In terms of age, the neurosyphilis epidemic was concentrated among individuals who were 51–60 years of age. However, in the same age group of people with syphilis, the highest constituent ratio of patients with neurosyphilis was detected in those aged 61 years and above (online supplemental figure 1B and table 2). Among the patients with symptomatic neurosyphilis, the number with general paresis increased significantly (online supplemental figure 1C and table 3).\n\nSupplemental material\n\nSupplemental material\n\nWe identified 3524 (35.0%) patients with syphilis who were newly diagnosed with neurosyphilis during the 11-year study period (table 1). The group of 51–60 years (1238, 53.5%) had the highest concentration of patients with neurosyphilis (online supplemental table 2). Most patients with neurosyphilis were men (2546, 72.2%) and more than half of the patients (2242, 63.7%) had a serum RPR titre ≥1:32; 33.5% of patients with neurosyphilis had a history or co-infection of multiple STD infections (table 1).\n\nCompared with patients with asymptomatic neurosyphilis, symptomatic neurosyphilis was more likely to be seen in the elderly (medians (IQR): 57 (50–62) years), men and individuals with higher CSF-VDRL. These patients were also more likely to be co-infected with multiple STDs and have diabetes, autoimmune disease or cancer (p<0.001). Conversely, they were less likely to be men who have sex with men (MSM) or people living with HIV (p<0.001; table 1).\n\nThe median time from onset of psychiatric and/or neurotic symptoms to patients seeking care was approximately 40 days (IQR 7.0–250.5 days); Significantly, it took another 211 days (IQR 98.0–399.0 days) before the diagnosis was confirmed. The time taken to diagnose meningovasculitis was the shortest (173.0 (61.0–309.5) days), while the time taken to diagnose gummatous was the longest (334.5 (198.5–478.8) days) (table 2).\n\nPsychiatric and neurotic features of tabes dorsalis\n\nTabes dorsalis was found in 12.3% of symptomatic neurosyphilis cases in this study. It is recognised that the symptoms of tabes dorsalis mainly include ataxic gait, lightning-like pains, impaired deep and proprioceptive sensation, and thermal sensation,7 due to the demyelination of the posterior roots of spinal nerves and posterior columns of the spinal cord. Among our patients with tabes dorsalis, predominant neurotic symptoms were observed, particularly limb anaesthesia (107, 61.5%), limb weakness (78, 44.8%), lightning-like pain (70, 40.2%), gait ataxia (48, 27.6%), walking on cotton feeling (43, 24.7%) and girdle sensation (10, 5.7%). Limb anaesthesia and lightning-like pain often manifest less frequently in the early stages of the disease and are often ignored by patients, indicating that once these symptoms appear, patients may be in the late stage. Notably, girdle sensation, indicative of spinal cord lesions,24 was also noted in tabes dorsalis, a finding not previously reported. The emergence of girdle sensation typically signifies a late stage of tabes dorsalis and is challenging to alleviate with conventional therapy.\n\nMost clinical descriptions concerning neurosyphilis stem from the pre-penicillin era. Tabes dorsalis, characterised by chronic meningeal reaction caused by invasion of spirochete and destruction of adjacent neural tissue,7 was the most common manifestation of neurosyphilis in the pre-penicillin era.10 However, since the advent of the penicillin era, the spectrum of neurosyphilis has undergone significant changes, with reports indicating a marked decrease in the incidence of tabes dorsalis.9 25 In our cohort, tabes dorsalis accounted for 12.3% of cases. Conversely, general paresis remains the most common form of neurosyphilis, no matter whether in the pre-penicillin era10 or in the modern era.9 11 In our dataset, 46.8% of symptomatic neurosyphilis cases with general paresis. These findings suggest that while penicillin may inhibit the development of tabes dorsalis, its influence on general paresis development is minimal. Therefore, it is imperative to identify effective strategies to impede the progression of general paresis.\n\nReal-world clinical studies indicate that some patients with early syphilis, even after standard treatment, may progress to symptomatic late-stage neurosyphilis.26 Our findings also suggest that neurosyphilis operates as a spectrum disease. As the disease progresses, its clinical spectrum can evolve, with asymptomatic neurosyphilis potentially developing into symptomatic neurosyphilis in very subtle ways, that may go unrecognised by the patients. Different types of neurosyphilis may share similar pathophysiological processes,11 leading to overlapping clinical manifestations. Therefore, it is crucial to monitor disease progression closely to accurately classify symptomatic neurosyphilis and ensure timely and appropriate intervention.\n\nWe conducted a comprehensive analysis of baseline data in patients with neurosyphilis and found that most were male and aged 50 years or older, consistent with our previous study.15 Additionally, male and elderly neurosyphilis patients were more likely to present with symptomatic than asymptomatic forms.27 Given that the cohort of patients diagnosed with syphilis at our institution between 2010 and 2020 had a gender ratio of 1:1, there was no gender bias in the present study. The impact of sex hormones on neurosyphilis accounts for this sex difference. Our previous studies indicated that the predisposition of elderly individuals might result from an impaired clearance of T. pallidum due to a weakened host immune response.15 Neurosyphilis has been associated with diabetes28 and hypertension29 in previous studies, which may also contribute to its higher prevalence among the elderly. In this study, diabetes was more likely to occur in patients with symptomatic neurosyphilis than in asymptomatic neurosyphilis ones, warranting further investigation into the underlying causes. The prevalence of symptomatic neurosyphilis was lower among people living with HIV and MSM in our study compared with Western countries.30 This difference might be attributed to regular annual syphilis screening and early treatment during the early or asymptomatic neurosyphilis stages of HIV infection in China.\n\nThere are several limitations to our study that need to be considered. First, as a retrospective study, it did not elucidate the underlying mechanisms. The association between clinical features and disease cannot infer causality because these clinical features are not universally present in symptomatic neurosyphilis. Second, we analysed the clinical features at a single baseline level, which prevented us from assessing the potential changes in the clinical syndrome over the course of disease progression. Third, our data were retrospectively analysed from a single institution, which may have introduced selection bias. Finally, the participants in our study were all Chinese; it is necessary to investigate patients from other biogeographical regions to confirm our findings. This limitation affects the generalisability of our conclusions to other races and ethnicities."
