        "text": "Exactly what caused GPI remained unclear until the definitive proof that it was caused by syphilis. Syphilis had first been identified in 1494 in Naples,[i] and became an endemic disease which was greatly feared (especially in its congenital form). That the newly observed phenomenon of the 1700s – GPI – represented a final and fatal phase of the newly virulent neurosyphilis was not at all clear. As early as 1857, two German doctors von Esmarch and Jessen suggested that syphilitic infection was the cause of general paralysis, and this idea persisted but was not taken seriously by everyone.[ii] Numbers of GPI cases increased in the later 1800s, and between 1875 and 1900 the number of cases of neurosyphilis admitted to Prussian asylums increased by five times.[iii] It accounted for as many as 15% of male asylum cases in Britain in the late 1880s.[iv]\n\nThe fact that it was largely younger men and middle-aged men of working age, particularly soldiers, that developed GPI meant that a causal link between sexual activity and the disease began to be established more firmly in the later Victorian period.[v] Those showing symptoms had been infected for some years and were in the final stage of the disease. The link between syphilis and GPI was fairly clear by 1900, and a consensus was forming that it was a final stage of syphilis, but the exact mechanics of the disease were still uncertain.\n\nA discussion in The British Medical Journal in 1902, showed how much had been learnt, but how much remained to be explained. Frederick Mott (1853-1926), neuropathologist to the London County Asylums, and the leading advocate for a syphilis link to GPI, wrote, ‘The relation of syphilis to insanity is of importance, because syphilis is a poison which is remarkable for its persistence, its prevalence, and its potency. Owing to existing social conditions we cannot regard it as preventable, but it seems to me the time has come when serious efforts should be made to diminish its prevalence. There is no tissue in the body which the syphilitic poison does not affect, but it selects those tissues in which there is an inherent or acquired locus minoris resistentiae, and it very frequently forms an alliance with another devitalising poison, alcohol. Syphilis may act in many ways as the cause of insanity.’[vi]\n\nGPI as a final stage of neurosyphilis was now accepted by many, Mott explained:\n\n‘What part does syphilis play in the production of general paralysis? There has been for some time past a diversity of opinion, but now, more and more, the syphilitic doctrine is finding acceptance. The relationship of syphilis to general paralysis is regarded by different authorities (1) as of no real importance ; (2) as of minor importance ; (3) as of considerable importance ; (4) as by far the most important factor, but not absolutely essential ; (5) as absolutely essential. In my opinion the last-named position cannot be proved, although the chain of circumstantial evidence strongly supports it, and it is safer ground to take the fourth premiss as established. Practically speaking, ” no syphilis, no general paralysis,” is a logical conclusion even if this premiss can be maintained.’[vii]\n\nSeveral steps were made towards establishing a clear causal link and in trying to find a cure in the Edwardian period, particularly in Germany, which formed the first major locus of syphilis research and treatment. In 1905 German scientists discovered the syphilis bacterium, and tests for the presence of the disease were discovered soon after.[viii] Such tests were useful, but still often returned false or confusing results. Finding a treatment for syphilis was an urgent medical question, despite the continuing belief amongst the population that it was a punishment for sin. In 1914, it is possible that as many as 7% of the adult population in Britain had the disease in some form. Neurosyphilis had also found its way into all social strata, and both sexes.[ix] Tests for the disease, such as Wasserman’s test, were developed in the early 1900s. Trust in new testing techniques was strong, and The Lancet proclaimed in 1912, ‘Never more than in the last few years has the medical profession appreciated the importance of this disease to those who have been infected with the virus, to the nation at large, and in fact to the whole human race … A positive Wassermann is conclusive evidence of the presence of the disease even in the total absence of all manifestations.’[x]Although not as reliable as first thought, the test paved the way for laboratory work on treatments and cures. Testing led to a fear amongst some that the true scale of syphilis in the population would be uncovered – a huge reservoir of infection, ‘It is terrible to think from these (asylum) figures that such a large amount of poison dwells unrecognised among us’.[xi]\n\nPaul Ehrlich’s development of salvarsan (a synthetic derivative of arsenic) in the early 1900s became the first – albeit unpredictable – treatment for syphilis. It was touted as a ‘magic bullet’ which would finally solve the scourge of the disease, although along with acclaim came opprobrium when the idea of providing a treatment for a disease spread by ‘immorality’ became known. The drug was first tested on patients in 1909, which Ehrlich monitored carefully, fearing a repeat of Robert Koch’s disastrously chaotic tests of the tuberculosis drug tuberculin. Salvarsan proved effective, mostly in cases with advanced symptoms of less than two years. Despite some problems and side effects, further trials in Britain proved that it was at least partially effective in reversing symptoms. Burroughs Wellcome (founded in London by Americans Silas Burrroughs and Henry Wellcome) managed to synthesise a similar drug (kharsivan), thus solving the problem of supplies from Germany during WWI. The British anti-syphilis drug was tested during warfare, and proved effective. This laid the ground for more developments in drug treatment in the 1920s, and aided the research into insulin.[xii]\n\nDrugs synthesized from arsenicals remained the basis of syphilis treatment for the next twenty years. Other experiments which began in Austria, in which advanced GPI patients were given malarial fever, also proved effective in many cases. It was around the second world war however, when effective antibiotics were developed, beginning with penicillin, that syphilis became fully treatable, and began to die out. What had been a disease with which to scare the young, even featuring in seaside exhibition model sideshows of syphilis-ravaged bodies, started to disappear. The disease had been a warning against immorality, but effective treatment removed this weapon in the armoury of moralists and conservative campaigners. Neurosyphilis had been a terrible disease, which in its final stages led to a long and agonising death, treatment for which had proved difficult to formulate and which proved only partially successful. The advent of advanced bacteriology and antibiotics effectively killed it. That is not to say that it went away entirely, and there have since been periodic small epidemics of syphilis, particularly at times of war, or when antibiotics have lost their full power, and also in developing countries at times of social dislocation. Syphilis is now a thing of the past, but it still appears occasionally in some parts of the world, and when the human race is under particular stress.\n\n[i] Kaplan, Part 1 p.17\n\n[ii] Wallis, p.791\n\n[iii] Kaplan, Part 1 p.20\n\n[iv] Hurn, p.7\n\n[v] Wallis, p.790\n\n[vi] BMJ, p.1215\n\n[vii] BMJ, p.1216\n\n[viii] Wallis, p.791\n\n[ix] Kaplan, Part 2 p.23\n\n[x] Hurn p.142 (‘Our Knowledge of Syphilis’, Lancet, 20 July, 1912, pp 163-4)\n\n[xi] Hurn p.174 (asylum report from the Journal of Mental Science, 1915, 16, p.303)\n\n[xii] Williams\n\nFurther Reading:\n\nJuliet D.

Many deaths in the asylums in the mid-1800s were attributed to ‘exhaustion from mania’ or ‘exhaustion from melancholia’. Other terms which seem ill-defined to us today include religious mania, ‘excitement’ and ‘moral insanity’. One phrase used in diagnosis of patients became more common as the 1800s wore on – ‘general paralysis of the insane’ (GPI) or ‘general paresis’. The phrase GPI was used with chilling frequency, and indicated a medical mystery in the early 1800s, but one which became explicable as medical knowledge grew. Despite this, GPI’s connection to a long-established and feared disease – syphilis – was still not a unanimous opinion in the medical profession at the dawn of the twentieth century.\n\nGPI involved a slow loss of co-ordination and delusional episodes. It affected reflexes and caused a weakening of the muscles. Early neurologists found that a loss of movement in this disease was not a true paralysis of muscles, but a loss of ‘the will’ to move – hence the alternative name of ‘general paresis.’[i] Once these symptoms had manifested themselves there was little that could be done, and the patient would die within a short time, probably a couple of years. The delusional aspect of the disease sometimes led to financial trouble, as Jennifer Wallis explains, ‘the erratic behaviour of the general paralytic…might get themselves into financial or legal difficulties. Delusions about their vast wealth led some to squander scarce family resources on extravagant purchases – one man’s wife reported he had bought ‘a quantity of hats’ despite their meagre income – and doctors pointed to the frequency of thefts by general paralytics who imagined that everything belonged to them.’[ii]\n\nThis description of a typical GPI patient was written by the superintendent of Bethnal House Asylum, Bethnal Green, in 1859: ‘A person who is insane…(shows) slight tremors of the lips…and feeble, straddling, or devious (gait)…He is full of all manner of schemes…and talks of the wealth he fancies his projects have brought him…The whirl of the spirits increases…Arrived at this pitch, everything becomes invested with immensity, grandeur, or beauty. Common pebbles are transformed into gems…(Thereafter) incessantly talking and restless, violent and destructive, tearing everything tearable to shreds…he lies on his bed…or on the padded floor of his room in a dream of happiness and splendour, which contrasts horribly with his hollow features and emaciated, squalid body. Happily death is at hand – exhaustion or paralytic coma soon closes the scene.’[iii]\n\nThis form of delusional behaviour, followed by dementia and paralysis had first been observed in Paris in the late 1700s, and soon spread all over Europe, producing asylum cases in Britain in the 1820s. It appears that several factors had combined to give a new boost to syphilis, creating neurosyphilis – a variation which directly attacked the brain. The upheaval and mass movements of people caused by the Napoleonic Wars had given syphilis a new chance to mutate and re-establish in its human hosts in a new form.[iv]\n\nExamples of GPI cases can be found in the surviving records of most asylums in Britain, and Staffordshire’s asylums are no exception. Military men were prominent amongst the GPI cases we have investigated from the county. The availability of sex for sale in garrison towns played a large part in high infection rates amongst troops. Walter Towner was 36 when he was admitted to Stafford asylum in 1904, with general paralysis caused by syphilis. His father had served in India, and Walter eventually decided to follow the same career path after working as a carter and labourer. He may well have become infected before he joined the army, as he had only been a soldier for about five years, and syphilis was a slow acting disease, with only its GPI phase, if it came, acting swiftly. His father had been stationed at Aldershot at the time of a large syphilis outbreak in the garrison, so it could be that Walter became infected in the womb. Walter died in 1905 in the asylum. John Hodgetts was admitted to Burntwood asylum in 1896, aged 29. He was a Royal Artillery Gunner and had been ill for seven years. He came from a family of coalminers and nail makers from Rowley Regis. He enlisted in the army in 1887 aged 20, and no doubt looked forward to the prospect of decent food, regular pay and travel away from his industrial roots. However, ill health dogged him and he ended up in military hospital with gonorrhoea, and in 1889 with what sounds like a case of primary syphilis. STDs were seen as an occupational hazard by soldiers, and they were endemic in military areas. He was sent in turn to Netley Military Hospital, Stafford asylum and Burntwood asylum. It appears that he was yet another victim of the historically high levels of syphilis in circulation in the later 1800s.\n\nThe fact that GPI represented the final, tertiary phase of neurosyphilis was not finally proven until the early twentieth century. Previous theories explained GPI as the result of insanity, rather than the cause of it.[v] Speculation about GPI, and whether it was linked in any way to sexual activity, was continual throughout the 1800s. In 1822 Antoine- Laurent Bayle was the first physician to describe general paralysis accurately, and it became known in France as the ‘maladie de Bayle.’ Bayle found that around a third of his male asylum patients developed GPI, and through the still infant science of pathology proved that many GPI patients had physical changes and inflammation in their brains. Despite this breakthrough, he identified causes such as alcohol, overwork and violent excess. He also observed that around one fifth of patients had been sexually hyperactive – the closest he got to establishing a link with venereal disease.[vi] Throughout the 1800s, cases of general paralysis were sent to asylums, but the mystery around what caused it continued.\n\nFollowing Bayle’s sixty year old observations, a study of 1880 suggested that GPI was caused by alcohol, excessive mental activity, tiring physical labour or emotional strain, or even a blow to the head.[vii] Many still suspected that sex was the ultimate root of the disease, although this suspicion often identified ‘sexual excess’ rather than sexually acquired syphilitic infection. Excessive behaviour was often blamed in general for the onset of the disease, before syphilis was definitely identified as the culprit. When Tory politician Randolph Churchill died, his excessive lifestyle was mentioned by many as the cause of his paralysis, without pinpointing sexual activity, although the sexual undertones of some press comments could be interpreted by readers. The Lancet said: ‘Lord Randolph Churchill’s case throughout has been typical of general paralysis…He led an over-full life in every direction… being distinguished alike by his relentless tactics towards opponents and his irresponsible attitude towards friends, he drained to the very dregs the heady cup of politics…while he continued to double with the life…of the stormy statesman the life of the great nobleman and the man of pleasure, sport, and fashion.‘[viii]\n\nAs Jennifer Wallis explains, many nineteenth century medics thought of GPI as a ‘disease of civilisation’, prominent in towns and linked with wider fears about urbanisation and the degeneration of the human stock.[ix] Syphilis itself, although still to be linked conclusively with GPI, had long been considered an urban disease, as growing urban populations in early modern Europe lead to men being infected by prostitutes. The infection found its way back to their original countryside communities, with both husband and wife infected. The only known treatment was mercury, which killed many syphilitic patients and often did more harm than good.[x]\n\nThe perceived links between urbanisation, ‘immorality’ and disease were strong in the 1800s. ‘Degeneration’ of the human race became a common theme for medics and writers. It was believed that the sexual and alcoholic license practiced by men in port towns was leading to their degeneration. Similar fears of human decline, taken up by both the eugenics movement and liberal social reformers, were highlighted more starkly by the number of men rejected as volunteers when the Boer War began in 1899. Alcoholism and GPI were often conflated, and telling the two apart proved difficult for many asylum doctors.[xi] GPI remained mysterious because it was seen as part of a wider general ‘degeneration’, and its cause was conflated with other symptoms of societal decline and physical demoralisation.\n\nOur next instalment describes how syphilis was finally identified as the disease which caused GPI, and how effective treatments were finally developed.\n\n[i] Hurn, p.14\n\n[ii] Wallis, p.790\n\n[iii] Hurn, p.6 (J.
