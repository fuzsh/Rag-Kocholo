        "text": "Syphilis refers to an infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum.\n\nSyphilis is predominantly a sexually transmitted infection (STI) caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum. Transmission occurs from direct contact with infectious lesions, usually during sexual intercourse.\n\nUntreated, syphilis can affect almost any organ in the body and was traditionally called the ‘great imposter’ because it can mimic many diseases in its late stages. Before the era of antibiotics syphilis was very common but it is now easily treated with penicillin when detected.\n\nThe prevalence of syphilis has been growing in the UK over the last decade.\n\nTraditionally, Syphilis was a common condition but the incidence dropped with the widespread introduction of antibiotics in the 1940s. Since then, incidence has varied, but sustained growth since 2000 has been seen with a significant increase in cases in the UK between 2013-2018. Worldwide there were >19 million cases of syphilis in 2016.\n\nNew cases are most common in young adults (aged 20-29 years) and >75% of cases in 2018 were among men who have sex with men (MSM). Among MSM, up to 40% with syphilis have co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). In addition, almost 50% of MSM with syphilis were diagnosed with another STI during the same episode or within the previous year.\n\nSyphilis can be categorised into four stages known as primary, secondary, latent and tertiary.\n\nSyphilis is categorised into four stages:\n\nPrimary\n\nSecondary\n\nLatent: divided into early latent and late latent\n\nTertiary\n\nSyphilis may also be categorised into early and late:\n\nEarly: primary, secondary or early latent syphilis\n\nLate: late latent and tertiary syphilis\n\nPrimary\n\nCharacterised by development of a painless ulcer known as a chancre. Develops at the site of inoculation. May go unnoticed depending on the site of infection (e.g. posterior pharynx) and may be associated with lymphadenopathy.\n\nIncubation period (time from infection to development of chancre) is 3-90 days (mean 21 days). Usually resolves in 3-10 weeks.\n\nSecondary\n\nHighly variable stage seen in approximately 25% of untreated patients (i.e. 1 out 4 patients who are not treated for primary syphilis). It is characterised by a systemic illness with multiple clinical features. Usually develops 4-12 weeks after appearance of the chancre and resolves within 3-12 weeks.\n\nLatent\n\nAn asymptomatic period in which there is serological evidence of infection but no symptoms. Divided into early or late latent syphilis:\n\nEarly latent syphilis: < 2 years from infection\n\nLate latent syphilis: > 2 years from infection\n\nTertiary\n\nSince the era of antibiotics, tertiary syphilis is rare. Most commonly develops 15-40 years following infection. It is characterised by cardiovascular syphilis (e.g. aortitis, aortic regurgitation, heart failure), Gummatous syphilis (granulomatous lesions most commonly seen in the skin and bone) and neurosyphilis.\n\nLate neurosyphilis is characterised by two presentations:\n\nGeneral paresis: affects the cerebral cortex. Presents with dementia-type picture, personality change, seizures and motor defects.\n\nTabes dorsalis: affects the dorsal columns of the spinal cord. Presents with paraesthesia and dorsal column changes (abnormal proprioception, abnormal vibration, abnormal sensation, upgoing plantars, absent ankle jerks).\n\nCongenital syphilis\n\nSyphilis infection increases the risk of miscarriage and stillbirth.\n\nCongenital syphilis refers to a child born with the condition due to vertical transmission between mother and fetus. Divided into two types:\n\nEarly: presenting < 2 years after birth. Typically presents with rash, haemorrhagic rhinitis ('bloody snuffles'), lymphadenopathy, skeletal changes and hepatosplenomegaly. Many other features can be present.\n\nLate: presenting > 2 years after birth. Persistent inflammation predominantly affects bones and teeth leading to characteristic features (see clinical features).\n\nSyphilis is caused by T. pallidum, which is able to penetrate mucus membranes or pass through skin abrasions.\n\nSyphilis is due to infection by the spirochete T. pallidum, which is most commonly sexually transmitted. As such, syphilis is normally checked as part of a STI work-up.\n\nTransmission\n\nThe organism can be transmitted by direct contact with infectious lesions, between mother and fetus or sharing needles among those who inject drugs.\n\nDirect contact with infectious lesions: contact with the chancre of primary syphilis (a painless ulcer) or infectious lesions of secondary syphilis can transmit the organism.\n\nVertical transmission: the organism can be transmitted between mother and fetus during pregnancy because the bacteria easily cross the placenta. Screening for syphilis is part of antenatal care in the UK.\n\nSharing needles: intravenous drug users can acquire syphilis from contaminated needles.\n\nEarly syphilis\n\nT. Pallidum is able to penetrate mucous membranes or pass through skin abrasions. At the site of inoculation a small papule develops, which progresses to a painless ulcer known as a chancre that is highly infectious. The chancre is most commonly located in the genital region, but can occur at any area depending on the site of contact and it may be hidden to the patient (e.g. pharynx, anus, or vagina).\n\nThe incubation period ranges from 3-90 days (Median 21 days). There is a local infection, which can spread to regional lymph nodes and may disseminate. Around 25% of untreated patients will develop a more systemic illness weeks to months (e.g. 4-12 weeks) following infection known as secondary syphilis. Secondary syphilis is characterised by a variety of clinical features (see below) and is highly variable.\n\nLate syphilis\n\nLate syphilis is also highly variable and may develop 1-30 years following initial infection. There may be a long latent period before clinical features develop. Around 25-40% of untreated patients can develop late disease. Patients with late syphilis do not necessarily need to have had clinically symptomatic primary or secondary syphilis.\n\nClinically, late syphilis is characterised by:\n\nCardiovascular syphilis (80-85%)\n\nGummatous syphilis (late benign)\n\nNeurosyphilis (5-10%)\n\nWithin the cardiovascular system, syphilis is characterised by endarteritis (inflammation of arteries) and there is a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction with an incomplete immune response. Aortitis (inflammation of the aorta) is classic of cardiovascular syphilis, which can lead to complications such as aortic regurgitation and heart failure.\n\nIn the central nervous system, there is infiltration of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with T. pallidum. Spontaneous clearance can occur. However, without clearance there is risk of ongoing inflammation and subsequent ‘symptomatic neurosyphilis’. Symptomatic neurosyphilis may occur in secondary syphilis (e.g. meningitis, cranial nerve palsies) or tertiary syphilis (e.g. General paresis and tabes dorsalis).\n\nSyphilis is diagnosed using serological tests.\n\nSerological testing is used to make a diagnosis of syphilis. It is based on the interpretation of two tests:\n\nNontreponemal tests\n\nTreponemal-specific tests\n\nVarious laboratory algorithms are available that dictate which tests should be completed first, and which are required as confirmatory tests.\n\nNontreponemal tests\n\nThis refers to two different tests:\n\nRapid plasma reagin (RPR)\n\nVenereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL)\n\nThese are non-specific tests that assess serum reactivity to cardiolipin-cholesterol-lecithin antigen from an infected or suspected infected patient. Positive tests are reported as a titre (e.g. 1:32). Following treatment, the titre of antibody will fall allowing use in patients who have previously been treated for syphilis.\n\nTreponemal-specific tests\n\nThis refers, but not limited to, the following tests:\n\nT. pallidum particle agglutination assay (TPPA)\n\nFluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS)\n\nT. pallidum enzyme immunoassay (TP-EIA)\n\nDetects antibodies that react to specific treponemal antigens. They are more specific, but following infection with T. pallidum they remain reactive life-long, even if the bacteria have been cleared. Reported as a qualitative result (e.g. reactive or non-reactive). Often a screening treponemal test is completed first and then followed by a confirmatory test.\n\nThe treatment of syphilis is with parenteral penicillin.\n\nPatients with confirmed syphilis on serological testing or those with suspected syphilis based on clinical findings (e.g. chancre, recent exposure) can be given treatment.\n\nPenicillin is the treatment of choice for syphilis, which is given to all stages. However, the dose and course length of penicillin is dependent on the stage.\n\nTreatment recommendations\n\nEarly syphilis:\n\nBenzathine penicillin 2.4 Million units, IM single dose.\n\nLate syphilis (cardiovascular or gummatous):\n\nBenzathine penicillin 2.4 million units, IM weekly for three weeks (3 doses)\n\nPrednisolone 40-60 mg for three days if cardiovascular (see Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction)\n\nNeurosyphilis:\n\nProcaine penicillin 1.8-2.4 million units IM once daily plus probenecid 500 mg QDS for 14 days, OR\n\nbenzylpenicillin 10.8-14.4 g daily, given as 1.8-2.4 g IV every 4 hours for 14 days.\n\nPrednisolone 40-60 mg for three days (see Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction)\n\nSyphilis in pregnancy:\n\nBenzathine penicillin 2.4 million units IM single dose in the first and second trimesters. Further dose in the third trimester followed by a second dose after one week.\n\nPenicillin allergy\n\nIn patients with a penicillin allergy always confirm the nature of the allergy. Some patients may have an intolerance rather than overt allergy and administration of parenteral penicillin may actually be appropriate.\n\nIt may be necessary to refer patients for allergy testing prior to initiation of treatment. In those with a confirmed allergy, alternative antibiotics choices can be used including doxycyline, ceftriaxone, azithromycin or erythromycin. This is guided by GUM specialists.\n\nJarisch-Herxheimer reaction\n\nThis refers to an acute febrile illness that usually presents within the first 24 hours of treatment for syphilis with headache, myalgia, chills and rigors.\n\nThe reaction occurs after the initial dose of anti-treponemal treatment. It occurs in 10-35 % of patients and is most common in early syphilis. It usually self-resolves without intervention in 12-24 hours. Anti-inflammatory drugs can be used (e.g. NSAIDs).\n\nDue to the potentially life-threatening nature of the reaction in patients with late tertiary cardiovascular or neurosyphilis, steroids are usually recommended (prednisolone 40-60 mg once daily). They are given for three days starting 24 hours before the initial dose of anti-treponemal antibiotics.\n\nLast updated: June 2021\n\nFurther reading\n\nBritish Association for Sexual Health and HIV (BASHH) guidelines."
