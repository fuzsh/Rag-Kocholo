        "text": "History has suggested that syphilis is a disease of early times. The disease might have been prevalent among the indigenous peoples of the Americas before Europeans travelled to and from the New World.\n\n“Pre-Columbian theory”\n\nThe \"pre-Columbian theory\" holds that syphilis was present in Europe before the discovery of the Americas by Europeans. The disease is described by Hippocrates in Classical Greece in its venereal/tertiary form.\n\nThere are other suspected syphilis findings for pre-contact Europe, including at a 13–14th century Augustinian friary in the north eastern English port of Kingston upon Hull. This city's maritime history, with its continual arrival of sailors from distant places, is thought to have been a key factor in the transmission of syphilis.\n\nThe “French disease”\n\nSome historians believe that the disease first made its appearance in the French troops besieging Naples and Italians called it morbus gallicus (‘French disease’). On the other hand the French preferred to call it the ‘Neapolitan disease’ or a disease from the Naples.\n\nSyphilis - the “social disease”\n\nReferences to the disease are present in history with many well-known persons succumbing to it. It was termed a social evil and both Syphilis and gonorrhea were “social diseases,” and the effort to combat them was the “social hygiene” movement. “Social evil” meant prostitution.\n\nEarly 1900’s\n\nIn 1911 California became the first state to require physicians to report cases of venereal disease and that, to assure confidentiality.\n\nIn 1913, Hideyo Noguchi, a Japanese scientist, demonstrated the presence of the spirochete ''Treponema pallidum'' in the brain of a progressive paralysis patient, proving that ''Treponema pallidum'' was the cause of the disease. Without its cause being understood, syphilis before this time was sometimes misdiagnosed and often misattributed to damage by political enemies. Mental illness caused by late-stage syphilis was once one of the more common forms of dementia. This was known as the general paresis of the insane.\n\nTuskegee Study\n\nBetween 1932–1972, the U.S. Public Health Service conducted what became known as the Tuskegee Study of Untreated Syphilis in the Negro Male (also known as the Tuskegee Syphilis Study or the Tuskegee Experiment). It was a clinical study, conducted in Tuskegee.\n\nNearly 400 poor, mostly illiterate, African-American men with syphilis were systematically and intentionally denied effective treatment so that researchers could observe the natural progression of the disease when left untreated. This unethical behavior raised severe controversy and eventually led to major changes in how patients are protected in clinical studies.\n\nBy 1953 the Eisenhower administration proposed eliminating the social hygienists and their PHS (Public health service) venereal disease program since they felt their job was essentially done. But syphilis along with other sexually transmitted infections like gonorrhea, herpes, chlamydia, and AIDS returned.\n\nHistory of diagnosis\n\nSyphilis was effectively diagnosed first using a test in 1906. This was called the Wassermann test. It did yield a few false positive results but was a major advance in the prevention of syphilis. By allowing testing before the acute symptoms of the disease had developed, this test allowed the prevention of transmission of syphilis to others.\n\nThis was followed by the Hinton test, developed by William Augustus Hinton in 1930’s. This was based on the principle of flocculation and showed fewer false positive reactions than the Wassermann test. Both of these early tests have been superseded by newer analytical methods.\n\nHistory of syphilis treatment\n\nEarlier syphilis was untreatable and usually progressed to its later stages. The Spanish priest Francisco Delicado in 1525 wrote about the use of ''Guaiacum'' in the treatment of syphilis.\n\nAnother common remedy was mercury. This gave rise to the saying, “A night in the arms of Venus leads to a lifetime on Mercury.” Mercury was taken orally or by injection or by rubbing over the skin. Another way was to fumigate the infected person in a box filled with mercury fumes with his head sticking out. References to mercury use for syphilis dates back to ''The Canon of Medicine'' (1025) by the Persian physician Ibn Sina (Avicenna). Giorgio Sommariva of Verona is recorded to have used it for this purpose in 1496.\n\nThe first antibiotic to be used for treating disease was the arsenic-containing drug Salvarsan, developed in 1908 by Sahachiro Hata while working in the laboratory of Nobel prize winner Paul Ehrlich. This was later modified into Neosalvarsan. This was not fully effective especially in tertiary stages.\n\nThese treatments were finally rendered obsolete by the discovery of penicillin, and its widespread manufacture after World War II.\n\nNotable syphilis-infected people in history\n\nKeys: S—suspected case; †—died of syphilis\n\nEndre Ady (1877-1919), Hungarian poet †\n\nMaurice Barrymore (1849–1905) actor †\n\nJohn Batman (1801–1839), founder of Melbourne †\n\nCharles Baudelaire (1821–1867), poet †\n\nKaren Blixen (1885–1962), writer\n\nManuel Maria Barbosa du Bocage (1765–1805), poet †\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821), emperor of France S\n\nAntónio Botto (1897–1959), poet\n\nCamilo Castelo Branco (1825–1890), writer\n\nBeau Brummell (1778–1840), fashion arbiter\n\nAl Capone (1899–1947), gangster †\n\nHenry Stuart (1545–1567), second husband of Mary Queen of Scots\n\nFrederick Delius (1862–1934), composer †\n\nGaetano Donizetti (1797–1848), composer\n\nBedřich Smetana (1824–1884), composer †\n\nPaul Gauguin (1848–1903), painter †\n\nHeinrich Heine (1797–1856), poet †\n\nHenry VIII (1491–1547), king of England S\n\nIvan the Terrible (1530–1584), Czar of Russia\n\nScott Joplin (1867/8–1917), composer †\n\nJohn Keats (1795–1821), poet S\n\nWilliam Lobb (1809–1864), plant collector S\n\nÉdouard Manet (1832–1883), painter †\n\nGuy de Maupassant (1850–1893), writer †\n\nFriedrich Nietzsche (1844–1900), philosopher S\n\nJack Pickford (1896–1933), actor †\n\nMartin Alonso Pinzon (1441–1493) captain of ''Pinta'' †\n\nLeo Tolstoy (1828–1910), writer S\n\nTheo van Gogh (1857–1891), art dealer †\n\nVincent van Gogh (1853–1890), painter S\n\nOscar Wilde (1854–1900), writer S\n\nEugen Sandow (1867–1925), bodybuilder S\n\nFranz Schubert (1797–1828), composer S\n\nHenri de Toulouse-Lautrec (1864–1901), painter †\n\nJohn Wilmot (1647–1680), writer †\n\nHugo Wolf (1860–1903), composer †\n\nMikhail Vrubel (1856–1910), painter\n\nKostas Karyotakis (1896–1928), Greek poet\n\nLord Randolph Churchill (1849–1895), British politician, father of Winston Churchill\n\nHarry Nelson Pillsbury (1872–1906), chess master †\n\nAdolf Hitler (1889–1945), politician S\n\nEleanor of Toledo (1522-1562), Duchess of Florence S\n\nFurther Reading"
