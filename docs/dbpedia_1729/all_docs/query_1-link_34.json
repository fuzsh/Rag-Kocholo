        "text": "Neurosyphilis emerged as a clinical entity at the beginning of the nineteenth century with the condition, 'General Paralysis of the Insane' (GPI). Noted for its sudden appearance in mostly men in mid-life, patients invariably died in hospital within one to five years from the first onset of symptoms. Our study sought to examine the impact of GPI and other manifestations of neurosyphilis on asylum admissions in Queensland in the pre-antibiotic era, analysing the patient records of the Goodna Hospital for the Insane in the period 1880 to 1920. Those diagnosed with GPI on admission were more likely to be married and employed in professional, administrative, technical/trade occupations. The average age of death was just over forty-three years. Conversely, those admitted for other psychiatric presentations where syphilis was presumed to be causal, tended to be predominantly unmarried, and more likely to be in labouring occupations. Average age of death was fifty-two years.\n\nPrior to the advent of the Wasserman Test as a diagnostic tool for Syphilis, the identification rate for Syphilis at the Mysore Government Mental Hospital in Southern India was 1%. With the introduction of the test, there was a dramatic increase in the diagnosis of Syphilis, with 17% of the patients testing positive. This paper throws light on the early notions of Syphilis and GPI, societal responses to the disease, early misdiagnosis, the advent of the Wasserman test and treatment management as reflected in the records of the early 20th century at the Mysore Government Mental Hospital (currently known as NIMHANS).\n\nThis article explores the history of general paralysis of the insane (GPI) and its treatment in Turkey. GPI was considered as “a disease of civilization” at the end of the nineteenth century. From the early years of the twentieth century, Turkish psychiatrists discussed and interpreted the causes of GPI and followed the European diagnostic and treatment methods of the disease. Austrian psychiatrist Julius Wagner-Jauregg (1857–1940) introduced and developed “malaria fever therapy” for general paralysis in 1917. Malaria fever therapy spread to other countries and, during the 1920s, the treatment was also used in Turkey. This article not only aims to illuminate an unnoticed aspect of the history of psychiatry in Turkey but also uses GPI as a model to illustrate how psychiatry in Turkey was influenced by the developments in Europe.\n\nThis paper seeks to identify the extent to which the early taxonomies of mental disorders (Kraeplin, 1902 and Mendel, 1907) had an impact on the diagnosis of the mentally ill in pauper and private asylums in Great Britain. It draws on doctoral research of mental health care and treatment in two Hampshire asylums and contextualises this with respect to the national picture allowing diagnostic and aetiological comparisons to be made. Developments in identifying ‘forms’ of mental disorder in the early twentieth century are analysed in the context of theories of social and medical history. Data from early asylum medical records provide an illuminating insight into the development of the medical model and physician autonomy.\n\nModern accounts of “self-harm” commonly attribute self-inflicted wounds with emotional or other psychological “meaning”, while assuming that these acts are a product of twentieth-century concerns. While self-harm is certainly a modern concept, the attribution of meaning to self-inflicted injury – above and beyond the physical existence of the wounds themselves – is not new. This thesis explores the way in which medical writers in the later nineteenth century understood and explained what they called “self-mutilation”, situating this debate within the history of asylum psychiatry (where most discussion occurred). Self-mutilation as a concept, it is argued, could only exist within the context of a prior understanding of “the self” as a specific physical and psychological entity, and physiological, anthropological and psychological approaches to selfhood are closely associated with medical attention to self-injury. While it might have been expected that writing on self-mutilation emerged from the bureaucratic nature of the contemporary asylum system, and psychiatric concern with the expansion of diagnostic nosologies, this was not necessarily the case. In fact, most of the alienists writing on this topic did not embrace “medical materialism” and hereditary models of illness wholeheartedly, but drew on a wide variety of fields – including anthropology, normal psychology, spiritualism and religious and literary allegory – in their efforts to understand self-injurious acts. This approach encouraged the idea that self-mutilation described more than just a physical wound, but was an act which could be analysed to uncover underlying mental or emotional meaning. In the writings and practices of these psychiatrists and, indeed, in cases of so-called “insane self-mutilation” reported more widely, I show that ideas and attitudes towards self-mutilation in this period can also inform the historian about ideas of the human condition, normal versus abnormal behaviour, and the very idea of selfhood."
