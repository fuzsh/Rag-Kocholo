As such, syphilis is often classified as acquired or congenital.\n\nCongenital syphilis is associated with stillbirth and increased childhood morbidity and mortality\n\nT. pallidum enters the blood stream via mucous membranes or abraded skin and enters the bloodstream and lymphatics. It has an incubation period of about 3 weeks.\n\nIt can cause many complications, and death.\n\nAll genital ulcers should be considered syphilis until proven otherwise!\n\nSyphilis is often found alongside HIV. It is thought that syphilis increases the risk of HIV transmission.\n\nAll newly diagnosed syphilis patients should have HIV screening, and those with HIV should have regular screening for syphilis\n\nSyphilis causes different specific phases of infection. After the initial primary syphilis symptoms, 75% of patients will enter an asymptomatic latent phase – hence the need for screening of at risk populations.\n\nTreatment is typically with a single stat dose of 1.8mg benzathine penicillin IM. Late syphilis will require longer courses (typically up to 3 weeks). Resistance is very uncommon. Alternative effective treatments include azithromycin and doxycycline, although it is recommended that those with penicillin allergy first undergo desensitization rather than use an alternative drug.\n\nSyphilis is believed to have been brought back from the New World by sailors on the first voyage of Christopher Columbus to the Caribbean in 1492/93.\n\nEpidemiology\n\nAbout 5,000 cases per year in the UK\n\nRates are rising particularly quickly in men who have sex with men (MSM)\n\nThe number of cases in the UK is on the increase. In recent years there have been particular outbreaks in certain cities in the UK.\n\nOver the last 5 years, rates have increased by:\n\n200% in heterosexual men\n\n1500% in MSM\n\n25% in women\n\nIn Australia, there are outbreaks in Aboriginal populations in WA, QLD, NT and SA.\n\nPresentation\n\nAbout 50% of patients will have no symptoms at all and will only be diagnosed on serological testing.\n\nPrimary syphilis – Usually, a painless, solitary ulcer – chancre\n\nAll genital ulcers are syphilis until proven otherwise!\n\nNot all cases cause an ulcer\n\nSome ulcers may go unnoticed – e.g. if on the anus, cervix or in the mouth\n\n30% of cases have multiple ulcers\n\nSecondary syphilis – a rash which typically affects the trunk, face, palms and soles\n\nTertiary / Late syphilis – the solitary ‘gumma nodule’\n\nThis is a non-cancerous granuloma, whch can occur in any tissue of the body, typically, skin, bones, testes, mucosa.\n\nStages of syphilis\n\nThe bacterium enters through any abrasion or graze in squamous or columnar epithelium.\n\nInfection of non-genital sites is rare, but possible.\n\nPrimary syphilis\n\nAn ulcer at the site of the original infection. This is usually the genitals (typically, penis, vagina, or rectum), but can be any point of contact.\n\nThe incubation period is 9-90 days, but typically 2-3 weeks\n\nOften beings as a painless hard macule, and develops into a painless ulcer known as a chancre\n\nUsually solitary (70%) of cases\n\nOften unnoticed, especially if in the mouth or around anus\n\nSometimes the chancre may be “atypical”\n\nMultiple\n\nPainful\n\nPurulent (produces pus)\n\nIn men typically found on the penis. In MSM may be found in the anus and in the mouth\n\nIn women, they can found on the external genitalia, or rarely internally\n\nCommon extra-genital sites include the mouth, lips, fingers and buttocks\n\nTypically persists for 4-6 weeks before healing spontaneously\n\nUsually also involves a local painless lymphadenopathy\n\nPatients often otherwise asymptomatic\n\nEXTREMELY INFECTIOUS!\n\nSecondary syphilis\n\nSecondary syphilis affects about 25% of infected untreated patients. Typical symptoms include fever, rash, malaise, headache and lymphadenopathy.\n\nThe other 75% of patients enter a latent asymptomatic phase – which in 50% of these patients persists for life (I.e. they have no further symptoms)\n\nOccurs 4-8 weeks after the chancre has healed (can be up to 6 months later). Consists of a rash of the trunk, palms, soles and sometimes face. The rash and any papules present are highly infectious. The rash can be confused with pityriasis roses, psoriasis or drug eruptions.\n\nThere may also be:\n\nMalaise / fever\n\nSore throat\n\nArthralgia\n\nLymphadenopathy\n\nAlopecia\n\nCondylomata lata\n\nThese are number moist papules found around the genital region\n\nUlcers of the palate and buccal region\n\nSnail track ulcers – found in the mouth and genitalia.\n\nRare:\n\nMeningism\n\nNephrosis\n\nUveitis\n\nSecondary syphilis is the most infectious phase!\n\nLatent syphilis\n\nA state of being infected with treponema pallidum but without clinical signs or symptoms. It occurs after the signs of primary and secondary syphilis have subsided (or were not noticed). Patients are not infective during this period.\n\nEarly latent syphilis – two years since the initial infection\n\nLate latent syphilis – >2 years since the initial infection\n\nThe differentiation between early and late syphilis is important, as it has implications for treatment. Those with early latent syphilis can be treated with a single IM dose of benzathine penicillin, those with late latent syphilis require more doses of therapy.\n\nIn real-life situations, knowing when the initial infection occurred can be difficult, and thus in these cases it should be assumed that the disease Is late latent syphilis.\n\nTertiary syphilis\n\nUsually occurs after a latency period of >2 years. Typically it occurs several years after the primary infection, but it can be 10+ years later.\n\nCan cause a very wide range of non-specific symptoms and thus may not been easily recognised.\n\nSyphilis should be considered as a differential in any patient present with cardiological or neurological symptoms – especially where the symptoms are unexplained\n\nIt is only rarely seen – possibly because many patients may end up being treated when they receive antibiotics for other indications and thus never knew they had syphilis.\n\nThere is the appearance of gummas:\n\nSoft granulomas. Affect any tissue.\n\nThe result of the inability of the immune system to clear the infection\n\nThe gummas induce a state of chronic inflammation\n\nLate stage syphilis. Can result in many complications:\n\nCardiovascular:\n\nAscending aortic aneurysm\n\nAortic regurgitation\n\nNeurosyphilis:\n\nMeningovascular\n\nTabes dorsalis refers to neurological disease where the functions of the dorsal column are lost due to syphilis\n\nSensory ataxia\n\nShooting pains\n\nTakes 15-25 years to develop after infection\n\nDementia\n\nCranial nerve palsies\n\nStroke\n\nGeneral Paresis of insane (GPI)\n\nDementia\n\nPsychoses – can be fatal if untreated, can be reversed with treatment\n\nDegeneration of sensory neurons\n\nSensory ataxia\n\nSensory loss – legs, nose, chest\n\nLightning pains\n\nGastric crisis\n\nLoss of reflexes\n\nArgyll – Robertson Pupils – bilateral, pupils constrict excessively when accommodating (focussing on near object), but DO NOT constrict in response to bright light.\n\nAka Prostitiues pupils – like prostitutes, they accommodate, but they don’t react!\n\nInvestigations\n\nScreening\n\nRecommended for men who has sex with men (MSM) at least annually, up to x4 per year\n\nHIV positive MSM – 4x per year\n\nRoutine antenatal screening\n\nRoutine immigration screening\n\nRoutine sexual health check\n\nUpon diagnosis of syphilis screen for STIs including HIP, Hep B and Hep C\n\nClinica indications in symptomatic patients include:\n\nGenital ulcers\n\nMSM with any genital symptoms or any rash\n\nAny rash of the palms or soles, which is persistent\n\nPUO\n\nPersistent lymphadenopathy\n\nAlopecia\n\nUnexplained liver disturbance\n\nSpecific tests for presence of treponema\n\nThese tests are unable to distinguish between syphilis and other treponema diseases (e.g. yaws) – however the other treponema diseases are rare.\n\nTreponemal enzyme immunoassay (EIA)\n\nIgM or IgG tests avilable\n\nIgG becomes positive 5 weeks after infection\n\nRequest “EIA IgM” or often just “syphilis serology”\n\nThis IgM test remains positive for life after infection, and thus does not confirm active infection\n\nIf positive, diagnosis usually confirmed with a cardiolipin antibody (RPR) test – which is much less specific – but confirms active infection\n\nT. pallidum chemiluminescant assay (CLIA)\n\nSeveral other types of test exists for detecting syphilis Ig – such as TPPA, TPHA tests\n\nTests should be repeated at 12 weeks if the initial test is negative and there is a strong clinical suspicion of syphilis.\n\nCardiolipin antibody\n\nNot very specific\n\nSometimes referred to as VDRL – Venereal disease reference laboratory or RPR – rapid plasmin reagin\n\nGives a specific titre result\n\nEasiest to detect in primary syphilis, levels decrease as disease progresses\n\nTest will be negative after treatment\n\nMainly used to monitor the progress of treatment\n\nDetecting T. Pallidum\n\nIt may be possible to directly detect the T. Pallidum bacteria in some circumstances\n\nThis is not routinely performed\n\nBiopsy from lymph nodes and swabs from skin lesions in early syphilis\n\nMay be performed to confirm early syphilis where serology could still be negative\n\nCan be detected with:\n\nDark Field Microscopy\n\nPCR\n\nDirect fluorescent antibody test (DFA)\n\nManagement\n\nPatients should be referred to a sexual health clinic\n\nContract tracing\n\nPatients who contract syphilis are at risk of re-infection. Opportunity should be taken to provide safe sex advice\n\nOffer screening for other STIs – particularly HIV\n\nAdvise no sexual contact for 7 days after treatment\n\nMedical management\n\nPrimary syphilis\n\n1.8g benzathine penicillin IM STAT dose\n\nAlternatives\n\nAzithromycin 2g PO STAT\n\nDoxycycline 100mg BD for 2 weeks\n\nIt is recommended that those with penicillin allergy first undergo desensitization rather than use an alternative drug.\n\nBENZATHENE PENICILLIN is NOT the same as benzylpenicillin – it has an especially long half life and lasts in the blood stream for several weeks – hence why only a one off dose is required. It has a consistently like toothpaste, and is often injected into the buttocks (half of the dose into each buttock). It is a painful injection.\n\nLate syphilis\n\nBenzathine penicillin 1.8g IM weekly for three weeks\n\nNeurosyphilis\n\nProcaine penicillin 1.5g IM daily for 14 days\n\nPLUS\n\nOral probenecid 500mg QID\n\nProcaine penicillin – can cause an unusual reaction with a feel of impending doom and hallucinations. Usually only lasts about 30 minutes. Warn patients this can occur.\n\nJarisch-Herxheimer reaction\n\nA reaction to treatment that can occur with early syhpilis\n\nUsually occurs 6-12 hours after onset of treatment\n\nCauses fevers, headaches, myalgias\n\nUsually resolved within 24 hours\n\nRarely is life-threatening\n\nManagement supportively with paracetamol and rest\n\nImportant in pregnancy\n\nOccurs in about 40% of cases treated during pregnancy\n\nCan cause fetal distress and premature labour\n\nUncommon in late syphilis\n\nNo evidence that the use of steroids reduce morbidity or mortality associated with Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction\n\nIntrauterine syphilis\n\n70-100% of infants of infected mothers will contract syphilis\n\n25% of pregnancies in women with untreated syphilis will result in miscarriage or stillbirth\n\nA further 10% result in neonatal death\n\nIn children born to infected mothers, infection can either present:\n\nEarly – <2 years age\n\nLate – >2 years ago\n\nIgG tests in neonates can be positive from maternal antibodies\n\nPositive IgM testing indicates a congenital infection\n\nTests can be negative in infants that are infected late in pregnancy and should be repeated at 3 months of age\n\nManagement\n\nAll pregnant women should be screened for syphilis\n\nAny woman with positive serology should be referred to a sexual health specialist urgently\n\nOlder siblings should be screened\n\nSexual partner should be screened\n\nBabies born to mother who have been treated during pregnancy should be screened with IgM testing at birth and at 3 months\n\nTreatment in pregnancy is the same as the general population – 1.8g stat of benzathine penicillin IM\n\nHOWEVER – pregnant women require close FU and specialist involvement to ensure the infection has been effectively treated\n\nAlso be aware of the increased risk of the Jarish-Herxheimer reaction as above\n\nReferences\n\nSyphilis – Australian STI guidelines\n\nSyphilis – patient.info\n\nMurtagh’s General Practice. 6th Ed.
