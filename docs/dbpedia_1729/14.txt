General paresis is one form of neurosyphilis. It usually occurs in people who have had untreated syphilis for many years. Syphilis is a bacterial infection that is most often spread through sexual contact. Today, neurosyphilis is very rare.

With neurosyphilis, the syphilis bacteria attack the brain and nervous system. General paresis often begins about 10 to 30 years after the initial syphilis infection.

Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. During the exam, your provider may check your nervous system function. Mental function tests will also be done.

Tests that may be ordered to detect syphilis in the body include:

CSF-VDRL

FTA-ABS

Tests of the nervous system may include:

Head CT scan and MRI

Nerve conduction tests

Spinal tap (lumbar puncture)

The goals of treatment are to cure the infection and slow the disorder and prevent further damage. Your provider will prescribe penicillin or other antibiotics to treat the infection. Treatment will likely continue until the infection has completely cleared.

Treating the infection will reduce new nerve damage. But it will not cure damage that has already occurred.

Treatment of symptoms is needed for existing nervous system damage.

Contact your provider if you know you have been exposed to syphilis or another sexually transmitted infection in the past, and have not been treated.

Contact your provider if you have nervous system problems (such as trouble thinking), especially if you know you have been infected with syphilis.

Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have seizures.
