        "text": "OrlÃ©ans, Louis I, duc d' (duke of) (b. 1372, Paris, d. 1407, Paris), younger brother of King Charles VI and first in the second dynasty of dukes of OrlÃ©ans. He initiated the power struggle with the dukes of Burgundy that became the dominating factor in 15th-century France. Known for his ambition and his love of pleasure, he was said to have had a liaison with the Queen as well as with other ladies.\n\nLouis was at first titled comte de Valois; in 1386 Charles granted him Touraine, which he exchanged in 1392 for the duchy of OrlÃ©ans. In 1386 he married his cousin Valentina Visconti, daughter of the Duke of Milan, who brought as part of her dowry lands in northern Italy and awakened OrlÃ©ans's ambitions for founding a kingdom there. Her hereditary right to Milan furnished her descendants, the kings Louis XII and Francis I, with a pretext for the wars they undertook in Italy.\n\nOrlÃ©ans sat on his brother's council. When Charles VI went mad, a power struggle developed between OrlÃ©ans and his uncle Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy. When Philip died in 1404, the rivalry continued with his son John the Fearless, culminating in OrlÃ©ans's assassination by John's agents in 1407. A long feud ensued between the Armagnacs, partisans of OrlÃ©ans's heirs, and the Burgundians. OrlÃ©ans was the father of the poet Charles d'OrlÃ©ans (1394-1465), head of the Armagnacs after his father's death and grandfather of Louis XII."
