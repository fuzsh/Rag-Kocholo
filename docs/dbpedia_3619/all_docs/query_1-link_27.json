François de Fénelon was his tutor and wrote Télémaque for his use. Louis was the rallying point of the opposition to Louis XIV—reactionary nobles and liberals alike—and miracles were expected of him. When he died suddenly during an epidemic (possibly of scarlet fever), rumors of poisoning circulated. His death is described in a famous passage in the memoirs of the duc de Saint-Simon. He was the father of King Louis XV of France and the brother of King Philip V of Spain.\n\nThe Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. Copyright © 2024, Columbia University Press.
