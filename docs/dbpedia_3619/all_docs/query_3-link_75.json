        "text": "As a decentralised and fragmented polity with a long-standing electoral system for appointing its monarchs, the late medieval and early modern Holy Roman Empire presented unique challenges and opportunities to the aristocratic dynasties based within its notional borders. It is a commonplace of German historiography that the Roman monarchy became ‘dynasticised’ in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, which is to say that it became the target of princely families seeking to enhance their Hausmacht. Yet in some respects this interpretation misrepresents the characteristics of ‘dynasty’, in terms of how contemporaries in the Empire seem to have conceptualised this notion. As historians, we find it convenient to subsume the aims of political actors within reified ‘dynastic’ wholes (the ‘Luxemburger’, the ‘Wittelsbacher’, the ‘Hohenzollern’, and so on), while the late medieval sources seem more concerned with princes and nobles as individual rulers (or co-rulers) tied to a territorial zone and political community (Landschaft, Herzogtum, comté, États, etc.). For those princes who aspired to become, or succeeded in becoming, kings or emperors of the Romans, there is a similar lack of evidence of purely ‘dynastic’ ideas in the sources. Instead, these accentuate the traditions and functions of the office of the imperial monarchy, as well as defining the monarch in relation to his other territorial and jurisdictional titles and rights. These discursive and ideological patterns in the late medieval evidence will be substantiated by reference to two of the most important ducal dynasties with royal aspirations in the Empire: the ‘Valois’ house of Burgundy (domus Burgundie, maison de Bourgogne) and the ‘Habsburg’ house of Austria (domus Austrie, Haus Österreich). The dukes of Burgundy ruled a growing territorial complex which brought them increasingly into the orbit of imperial politics, and in the fifteenth century they sought to obtain royal status, whether through election as kings of the Romans or through the acquisition of a new crown of Burgundy (or ‘Lotharingia’). Though these ambitions were never fulfilled, the negotiations for a Burgundian crown reveal a recurrent emphasis on the territorial and communitarian foundations of the dukes’ authority and dynastic legitimacy. The dukes of Austria, meanwhile, were scattered amongst an archipelago of south German territories, and the political image of each member of the dynasty was crafted primarily by reference to the specific titles he bore and the local relationships that came with it. At the end of the fifteenth century, as one ‘Habsburg’ branch gained a firm grasp on the crown of the Romans, a preoccupation with a mythologised Austrian dynasty did emerge, but only in conjunction with more customary references to official functions and the claims and agendas of subject territories and regions. The paper will draw from these examples the need to avoid isolating ‘dynasticism’ as a ‘factor’ in late medieval politics. In a fragmented and competitive political space like the Holy Roman Empire, dynastic concerns were always embedded in a nexus of aims which had to take into account – and discursively valorise – the territorial and communitarian components of a prince’s patrimony.\n\nAbstract: At the end of the 14th century, the County of Flanders, held by Louis of Male, was inherited by his daughter Margaret and her husband Philippe the Bold, Duke of Burgundy. The new sovereigns had to prove their authority in the face of significant privileges previously gained by the cities in the county, one of the most developed territories in Europe. The Revolt of Ghent and the Battle of Roosebeke (1384), won by the ruler, confirmed the control of the Valois Burgundy Dynasty over the recently acquired lands. The conflict between cities and the political aspirations of the Dukes of Burgundy would be a constant problem throughout the 15th century in the Low Countries, as confirmed by the many other riots and revolts that took place in Ghent and Bruges.

The comparison between the iconographical analysis of the manuscripts, tapestries and other pieces from the collection of the duke and the chronicles of Jean Froissart, Georges Chastellain and Enguerrand de Monstrelet allows a deep understanding of the image of mightiness created by the court around the figure of the duke of Burgundy in relations to the collapsed cities. The result will finally show how was constructed the image of the early modern city in peace with a sovereign dominating it and if it corespond to the ducal ideology of justice, equity and common good. ABSTRACT: At the end of the fourteenth century the county of Flanders held by Luis of Male was inherited by his daughter Margaret and her husband Philip the Bold, duke of Burgundy. The new sovereigns had to prove their authority against the strong privileges previously gained by the cities of that county, one of the most developed territories in Europe. The revolt of Gent and the Battle of Roosebeke (1384) won by the ruler, confirmed the control of the Valois Burgundy dynasty on the recently acquired lands. The conflict between cities and the political aspirations of dukes of Burgundy would be a constant problem throughout the fifteenth century in the Low Countries as showed many other riots and revolts in Gent and Bruges. Every conflict between the city and the sovereign inspired the court to celebrate the victory and to applaud the ducal control on Flemish cities. Ducal control was expressed by the iconography of art works, emphasised during the spectacular entry of the duke to the humiliated city."
