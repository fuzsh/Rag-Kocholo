        "text": "Duchy of Burgundy (French: Duché de Bourgogne) was a peace of land in France that has been claimed by Spain many times, Burgundy used to be a Kingdom, but it became a Duchy in 1004, Burgundy was not yet apart of France though, it was back then a different country. The Duchy was then put in the Crown of Spain by the Marriage of Phillip the Handsome and Joanna the Mad.\n\nBurgundy was apart of Spain until the war of the Spanish succession, when Burgundy was given back to France, but Spain still uses the title \"Duke/Duchess of Burgundy\" despite having no power over Burgundy.\n\nThe Duchy of Burgundy was abolished during the French Revolution.\n\nKingdom of Burgundy (300? - 1245?)[]\n\nBefore becoming a Duchy, the Kingdom of Burgundy was created by Gjúki of Burgundy in the 4th century, He took the title \"King of the Burgundians\".

Odo was a member of the christian kingdoms that follow the Catholic church, the ottomans were Islamic people who wanted to extend there empire into Europe. The symbol of the Catholic's were crosses, and Mary holding baby Jesus. Odo's niece Eleanor of Aquitaine was currently the most powerful person in France, Odo gained support of Eleanor and the crushed crusaders going into France.\n\nReign of Mary the Rich[]\n\nIn the late 1400's Duke Charles the Bold died, his daughter Mary the Rich became the new Duchess.
