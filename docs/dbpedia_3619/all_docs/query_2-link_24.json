        "text": "There have been topics discussing alternate children for the Catholic Monarchs as well as Louis XIII (with all of Anne of Austria's stillbirths/miscarriages being carried to term) so I figured why not do a similar topic on the children of Louis XV. This French King was quite unlucky with his Polish Queen. They had a total of 10 children, but only two sons (one of which died young). The other eight were daughters. Only one of his daughters married, to the Infante Philip, later Duke of Parma. Two of the daughters died young, but the others never married, and one even became a nun. It was suggested that they never married because of the awkward period in which they were born left a lack of suitable princes to marry them, and thus remaining unmarried and at Versailles was considered much more suitable. So instead, let's give Louis XV his many sons in lieu of his daughters. To matters simple, we'll give these children the life spans of their OTL counter-parts.\n\n- Louis (OTL Louise Elisabeth), the Dauphin: 1727-1759\n\n- Philippe (OTL Henriette, twin of Louise), the Duke of Anjou: 1727-1752\n\n- Charles (OTL Louise, died young), the Duke of Burgundy: 1728-1733\n\n- Louise (OTL Louis, the Dauphin): 1729-1765\n\n- Marie Thérèse (OTL Philippe, Duc d'Anjou, died young): 1730-1733\n\n- Charles Stanislaus (OTL Marie Adelaide), the Duke of Burgundy: 1732-1800\n\n- Louis Joseph (OTL Victoire), the Duke of Aquitaine: 1733-1799\n\n- Charles Philippe (OTL Sophie), the Duke of Berri: 1734-1782 - Stillborn Child: 1735\n\n- Philippe François (OTL, Thérèse), the Duke of Alençon: 1736-1744\n\n- Louis Auguste (OTL Louise-Marie), the Duke of Alençon: 1737-1787\n\nNames just based on what was popular within the royal family at that time, going back to Louis XIV's time. With more sons, one would certainly bare the name of his Polish grandfather. I'm fairly certain all these sons would be granted appanages, I just used what was considered at the time\" Louis XV's historical second son was granted Anjou, and I went from there, as one of his grandsons was granted Burgundy and another Aquitaine, before Louis XVIII and Charles X were granted counties: I'm unsure why Louis XVIII was granted Provence, but Charles X was specifically granted Artois because he was born shortly after Robert Damiens attempted to assassinate the king, and was from that province. The grant of Artois to his grandson was to show the people of that province that he still loved them. Without anything to rock the boat, all these sons are certainly made Dukes.\n\nLouis XV would still be deprived of his eldest son before his own death, so would probably still be succeeded by a grandson. It's possible though, that the Dauphin fails to have heirs and so Louis XV would instead be succeeded by the Duke of Anjou. As for his lone surviving daughter in this scenario, she will probably marry a Spanish Prince, likely the Infante Philip, as the earliest marriages of Louis XV's children were to patch up things with the Spanish branch. In this case, the Dauphin probably still has a Spanish wife, who may or may not survive, or he could die without heirs. As for the other sons, it'd be interesting to see who they might marry. Like the ill-fated princesses, might some of them not marry out of lack of suitable princesses at the time? The Austrians are not yet allies, so these princes won't benefit from the diplomatic revolution that saw Louis XV betroth his grandson to an Austrian Archduchess. As long as there are suitable princesses in the places that the French royal family married into (Bavaria and Savoy come to mind), the six surviving sons might see themselves wed. I know there were a couple Savoyard Princesses much like their French counterparts that were abandoned because of lack of suitable princes to marry. It seems especially in the period of 1730-1740, there were many princesses born into European royal families, but not enough princes to counterbalance it.\n\nThat's a very interesting scenario... Louis XV having that many sons (and so few daughters), it would change things in France and secure the succession.\n\nIn this scenario, out of the 11 children of Louis XV, only 7 of them will survive up to adulthood: six sons and one daughter. While the daughter will surely be married for political reasons, some of the sons might not: it's possible at least one of them ends up in the Church. Of the sons who would probably end up in the Church, my guess is Philippe (the second one) would be a good candidate, since he's the twin of the Dauphin (Louis): though the Monarchy has decided who's first among the twins, there would be room for contestation so it would be best to ensure one of the twins doesn't have children. Another good candidate for the Church would be the youngest one, Louis Auguste, because he's the sixth son and thus very far from the throne. On a side note, boys who will enter the Church do not receive an apanage in France if memory serves me right.\n\nThe succession of Louis XV will depend on when his sons are going to marry and if they will leave male sons behind. From the looks of it, it's likely we get a son of Louis XV's eldest son to become King (Louis XVI?) of France in 1774. If not, possible successors would be sons of the Dauphin's twin, Philippe, if he has some or Charles Stanislaus (third son) and his bloodline.\n\nI have no real clue on the possible brides of Louis XV's sons. The two brides of the OTL Dauphin, Maria Theresa Rafaela of Spain and Maria Josepha of Saxony, are among the likely possibilities since they are around the same age as Louis XV's sons. For the others, I would have to look among the princesses of allied families (Bourbon-Parma, Bourbon-Sicilies, Savoy, etc...) for possibilities as well as into French nobility for the youngest ones, be they cousins (Bourbon-Orléans, Bourbon-Condé, etc...) or not. As for Maria Theresa, the only daughter of Louis XV in this scenario, it's likely she ends up married to the Duke of Parma like her \"OTL sister\".\n\nThe succession is definitely secure, and I agree that one of the sons could end up in the Church. I would assume even with so many sons, Louis XV will tire of his queen and probably end up living a similar lifestyle. He lost interest in her not because they had so many daughters, but he found her boring and he wasn't able to hold an interest in her. Many of his daughters were religiously devout and sided with their mother over the king and his mistresses, so I think one of the sons could certainly decide to enter the church to atone for the sins of his father.\n\nMaria Theresa certainly ends up married to the Duke of Parma, and the Dauphin probably marries Maria Theresa Rafaela as OTL, they are simply different people marrying the same people as their similar counterparts. Spain was still angry over Louis XV's original bride being sent home, so the king will want to appease them, and a double match will do well fix things. We'll go ahead and say the youngest son enters the church, as it was also Louis XV's youngest daughter who chose to become a nun. The marriages of the children will probably be split between the elder sons (those born between 1727-1732) and the younger ones (from 1733 onwards). Louis Auguste will join the church, and two sons died young, leaving five to marry. The youngest 'marriageable' son, the Duke of Berri would be a suitable age gap that he'd be a suitable husband to one of daughters of Don Carlos, King of Naples until 1759. The Bourbon-Parma and Bourbon-Sicilies branches didn't exist as we know them in the 1740s/1750s, but would certainly be around once these princes have married and settled down. The Bourbon cadet branches within France were also lacking, I believe. I know the Duke of Orléans had no children aside from his son and heir, for instance. The Princes of Condé and Conti were in similar straits in this generation. As for the five sons and daughter, I figure these marriages might work. I'm only discussing first marriages, as it would be too much to discuss second or third ones.\n\nThe Dauphin: Maria Theresa Rafaela, as the OTL Dauphin did. They would probably wed around 1745-1746. The OTL wedding was in 1744, when the OTL Dauphin was 15, but he was also the only son. With so many sons, it could certainly be pushed away until he was a bit older.\n\nThe Duke of Anjou: Maria Felicita of Savoy, although either of her sisters, who were suggested brides for the OTL Dauphin work as well. I imagine they could do a double wedding with that of the Dauphin, considering they are twins, but also as a cost saving measure, as even as early as this period were there protests over royal extravagance.\n\nLouise, Madame Royale: As stated before, she will marry the Infante Philip, later Duke of Parma.\n\nThe Duke of Burgundy: One of the princesses of Bavaria, sometime in the early 1750s. One of the Saxon Princesses might be considered too, but I think a Bavarian one might be a bit more likely.\n\nThe Duke of Aquitaine: If the Duke of Burgundy takes a Princess of Bavaria, he could marry a Princess of Saxony. There's also the fact that he'd be coming of age in the early 1750s. The Diplomatic Revolution could be sealed with him, and he could marry an Austrian Archduchess, maybe Maria Anna, despite her disability (she would be the only daughter old enough at that point). The marriage would have to happen before 1756, though. I don't imagine any marriage being celebrated in the midst of the Seven Years War. If no bride is found before then, he may have to wait until the conflict is resolved, or not marry at all. He could possibly end up the most unhappy of Louis XV's children, as I could totally see the match to Maria Anna pursued, despite her disability. As the fourth son, he isn't in any pressing position to have children, so I could see him pushed into marriage with this disabled Archduchess and totally resenting it; or them getting along, but ultimately having no children. He could also end up being forgotten and not marrying at all.\n\nThe Duke of Berri: The Duke of Aquitaine marrying an Archduchess is a stretch, as it'd have to happen before the Seven Years War, but could happen. Berri would probably be the last child of Louis XV's to marry, and it might be fairly late, especially as he'd be coming of age in the mid to late 1750s. At any rate, he probably snatches one of the daughters of Charles III, who is certainly King of Spain by time of the marriage. Infanta Maria Josefa is likely. He could also marry a Portuguese Infanta: compared to his other brothers, he'd be marrying in his mid to late 20s, even his early thirties, and his bride would be in most cases in her twenties (although the first Portuguese Infanta listed would be in her teens), his with marriage being used to reinforce ties with Spain or rebuild them with Portugal. Like Aquitaine, he could end up 'forgotten' and end up not marrying at all."
