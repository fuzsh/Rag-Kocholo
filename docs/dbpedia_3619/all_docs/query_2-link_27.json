        "text": "Duke of Burgundy (French: duc de Bourgogne) was a title used by the rulers of the Duchy of Burgundy, from its establishment in 843 to its annexation by the French crown in 1477, and later by members of the House of Habsburg, including Holy Roman Emperors and kings of Spain, who claimed Burgundy proper and ruled the Burgundian Netherlands.[1]\n\nQuick Facts Dukedom of Burgundy, Creation date ...\n\nClose\n\nThe Duchy of Burgundy was a small portion of the traditional lands of the Burgundians west of the river Saône which, in 843, was allotted to Charles the Bald's kingdom of the West Franks. Under the Ancien Régime, the duke of Burgundy was the premier lay peer of the Kingdom of France. Beginning with Robert II of France (r. 996–1031), the title was held by the Capetians, the French royal family. In 1032 King Henry I of France granted the duchy to his younger brother, Robert, who founded the House of Burgundy. When the senior line of the House of Burgundy became extinct in 1361, the title was inherited by King John II of France through proximity of blood. John granted the duchy to his younger son, Philip the Bold, in 1363. The Valois dukes gradually came to rule over a vast complex of territories known as the Burgundian State, and became dangerous rivals to the senior French royal line of the House of Valois.\n\nWhen the male line of the Valois dukes of Burgundy became extinct in 1477, the Duchy of Burgundy was confiscated by Louis XI of France. The title \"duke of Burgundy\" passed to Habsburg monarchs after Mary of Burgundy married Maximilian I of Austria in 1477. The Habsburgs used this connection to claim Burgundy proper and to rule their Burgundian inheritance until the Napoleonic era. The title was subsequently revived for several younger sons of the House of Bourbon and since 1975, branches of it have used \"duke of Burgundy\" as a revived courtesy title.\n\nBosonid dynasty (880–956)\n\nMain article: Bosonid dynasty\n\nThe first margrave (marchio), later duke (dux), of Burgundy was Richard of the House of Ardennes,[citation needed] whose duchy was created from the merging of several regional counties of the kingdom of Provence which had belonged to his brother Boso. Richard was the son of Eccard of Macon and Richildis of Arles, Boso the son of Bivin of Gorze and Richildis of Arles.\n\nHis descendants and their relatives by marriage ruled the duchy until its annexation over a century later by the French crown, their suzerain.\n\nRichard the Justiciar (880–921)\n\nRudolph (921–923), then King of the Franks\n\nHugh the Black (923–952)\n\nGilbert (952–956)\n\nRobertian dynasty (956–1002)\n\nMain article: Robertian dynasty\n\nOtto (956–965)\n\nEudes Henry the Great (965–1002)\n\nHouse of Ivrea (1002–1004)\n\nMain article: Anscarids\n\nOtto William (1002–1004)\n\nHouse of Capet (1004–1032)\n\nMain article: House of Capet\n\nIn 1004, Burgundy was annexed by the king, of the House of Capet.

In the same year, Mary married Maximilian, Archduke of Austria, giving the Habsburgs control of the remainder of the Burgundian Inheritance.\n\nAlthough the territory of the Duchy of Burgundy itself remained in the hands of France, the Habsburgs remained in control of the title of Duke of Burgundy and the other parts of the Burgundian inheritance, notably the Low Countries and the Free County of Burgundy in the Holy Roman Empire as well as the County of Charolais in France. They often used the term Burgundy to refer to it (e.g. in the name of the Imperial Circle it was grouped into), until the late 18th century, when the Austrian Netherlands were lost to the French Republic. The Habsburgs also continued to claim Burgundy proper until the Treaty of Cambrai in 1529, when they surrendered their claim in exchange for French recognition of Imperial sovereignty over Flanders and Artois.\n\nMaximilian I (1477–1482 with his wife; regent 1482–1494)\n\nPhilip IV the Handsome (German: Philipp der Schöne; French: Philippe le Beau), titular Duke of Burgundy as Philip IV (1482–1506)\n\nCharles II (Holy Roman Emperor Charles V and King Charles I of Spain) 1506–1555\n\nMore information Picture, Name ...\n\nPicture Name Birth Became Duke Ruled until Death Notes Arms Philip IV the Handsome\n\n(Philippe IV le Beau)22 July 147822 February 148225 September 1506Eldest son of Duchess Mary by Maximilian of Habsburg Charles II24 February 150025 September 150616 January 155621 September 1558Eldest son of Philip the Handsome.
