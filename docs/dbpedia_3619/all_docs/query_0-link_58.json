        "text": "Louis I, duke d’Orléans (born March 13, 1372, Paris—died Nov. 23, 1407, Paris) was the younger brother of King Charles VI and first in the second dynasty of dukes of Orléans. He initiated the power struggle with the dukes of Burgundy that became the dominating factor in 15th-century France. Known for his ambition and his love of pleasure, he was said to have had a liaison with the Queen as well as with other ladies.\n\nLouis was at first titled comte de Valois; in 1386 Charles granted him Touraine, which he exchanged in 1392 for the duchy of Orléans. In 1386 he married his cousin Valentina Visconti, daughter of the Duke of Milan, who brought as part of her dowry lands in northern Italy and awakened Orléans’s ambitions for founding a kingdom there. Her hereditary right to Milan furnished her descendants, the kings Louis XII and Francis I, with a pretext for the wars they undertook in Italy."
