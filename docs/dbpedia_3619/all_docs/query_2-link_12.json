        "text": "Our Descent from St. Louis IX, King of France, and Kinship With the French Royal Family\n\nOn my mother's side, we have traced a line of descent from James II, King of Scots (died 1460), whose wife Marie of Gueldres was a descendant of Jean II le Bon (John the Good), King of France (died 1364). King John the Good was a great-great-grandson of St. Louis IX, King of France (died 1270), one of the most renowned of the medieval Kings of France. St. Louis was noted for his Christian piety and holiness of life, and he died on 25 Aug. 1270 while on Crusade near Tunis in north Africa. He was canonised by Pope Boniface VIII in 1297, and his feast day is celebrated on August 25. All of the later Kings of France are male-line descendants of St. Louis. In addition, because of the numerous intermarriages of the descendants of St. Louis, my mother's Stewart ancestors had several lines of descent from him. For example, not only Marie of Gueldres, but also her husband James II, King of Scots, was a descendant of St. Louis.\n\nFor the sake of simplicity, the following table presents my mother's descent from St. Louis through Marie of Gueldres, alongside the genealogy of the Spanish Bourbons, who are the senior male-line descendants of the House of Capet and therefore the rightful heirs to the French throne.\n\nST.
