        "text": "At one time in France, when Louis XIV was King of France, there were four generations alive which shows how the titles would probably be distributed.\n\nIn general in French royal history. it seems the second sons were given the title “Duke of Anjou”. Louis XIV’s brother Phillipe was Duke of Anjou until he became the Duke of Orleans. As Duke of Orleans he was allowed to pass this title on to his own male descendants but he apparently let the title “Duke of Anjou” revert back to Louis XIV’s control.\n\nLouis XIV’s sole legitimate son was Louis, the Dauphin, AKA the Grand Dauphin. The Grand Dauphin had 3 sons, who were the grandsons of Louis XIV.\n\nThe eldest son of the Grand Dauphin was (another) Louis and he was known as the Duke of Burgundy, and also as the “Petit Dauphin” to distinguish him from his father. This Louis, Duke of Burgundy, had 3 sons, all named Louis, two of whom died young. The first Louis was given the title Duke of Brittany which had not been used in over 200 years. After the first Louis died, a second Louis was born and he was given the title Duke of Brittany. When his little brother was born, (the third Louis), that little brother received the title Duke of Anjou. This third Louis, a great-grandson of Louis XIV, would become King Louis XV.\n\nThe second son of the Grand Dauphin was Philip, known as the Duke of Anjou until he became King Philip V of Spain. His title of Duke of Anjou then went to his nephew, the third Louis who would become Louis XV.\n\nThe third and youngest son of the Grand Dauphin was Charles known as the Duke of Berry.\n\nThe eldest, unmarried daughter of a King of France was known as “Madame Royale”\n\nThere had never been 4 generations of French royals alive before this time but they suffered untimely deaths during the long war over who was to rule Spain. The Grand Dauphin, the Petit Dauphin and two of the 3 sons of the Petit Dauphin and Charles Duke of Berry all died before Louis XIV, leaving him to be succeeded by his 5-year-old great-grandson.\n\nI think, based on this, that currently Prince Charles would be the Dauphin (having been born as the Duke of Burgundy). Prince Andrew would be the Duke of Anjou. Prince Edward would be the Duke of Berry. Prince William would be the Duke of Burgundy. William's son George would be the Duke of Brittany. Princess Anne would have had to give up the title of Madame Royale, once she married.\n\nI looked at the titles of the children of some later French Kings and , like Victoria mentions, the names Aquitaine and Angoulême, among others, appeared in close conjunction with the names used in Louis XIV’s time. So, guessing now, Prince Harry could easily be the Duke of Aquitaine.​\n\nOnce Prince Andrew dies, Prince Harry could inherit the title of Duke of Anjou as the second son of Prince Charles. And when Prince Harry dies, Prince William's second son who is named (wait for it)... Louis .... would be the new Duke of Anjou, Prince William's daughter, Princess Charlotte, would be Madame Royale once Prince William becomes King.\n\n​\n\nI'm far from an expert on the French monarchy but from what I know, Duke of Orleans in the Duke of York equivalent.\n\nDepends on the period. Orléans was actually pretty unimportant (as things went) when it was given out to Charles VI's brother. It was only through his brother's scheming and wheeling-dealing that the Orléans \"estate\" was built up. He traded the dukedom of Touraine back to the crown in exchange for some other lands. That estate passed to his son and his son passed it on to Louis XII who picked up a few more fiefdoms through inheritances and court cases. Then, added with the \"foreignness\"/extinction of Burgundy, Anjou, the extinction of Berri etc, Orléans became the \"most prestigious\".\n\nOrléans was then given by François I to his second son because it would've been François' title once Louis XII died with no sons (had Charles VIII survived). In fact, it's not quite sure what lands a hypothetical son of Louis XII, as duc d'Orléans, (born after Renée) would've gotten, since, by 1508, François I had essentially taken the lot. Then, Henri II gave it to his second born son, Louis. When Louis died, Henri recreated it for his third son (Charles IX), and when Charles IX became king, he awarded it to OTL Henri III. However, Henri III relinquished the title in 1566 for the \"more prestigious\" duc d'Anjou.\n\nHenri IV never actually created his second son (Nicolas Henri) duke of Orléans. At the time of N.H. (which were initials to designate the child was male and unnamed/unbaptised, which were later turned into \"Nicolas Henri\")'s birth, he was called \"Monsieur d'Orléans\" but there is no official creation of him as such. The main reason why Gaston was created \"duc d'Orléans\" was because Marie de Medici fancied herself a spiritual descendant of Catherine de Medici. After Henri III relinquished the title to the crown, Charles IX created his mother as \"duchesse d'Orléans\" (not that unusual, see Marguerite, duchesse de Berri; or how Renée de France was created duchesse de Chartres, or Louise de Lorraine/Margot de Valois were both given appanages (duchy of Berri)) in reward for her services as regent.\n\nErgo, Marie pressured Louis XIII to create Gaston \"duc d'Orléans\".\n\nThen, in 1640, Louis XIII wanted to create his second son \"duc/comte d'Artois\" after the French victories, but he was talked out of it (Louis XV later created Charles X that to show that he bore Artois no ill will for \"spawning a monster like Robert Damiens\"). Louis XIII fell into the regular royal pattern of \"duc d'Anjou\" as a second son.\n\nAt one time in France, when Louis XIV was King of France, there were four generations alive which shows how the titles would probably be distributed.\n\nNot exactly.\n\nLouis XIV broke with \"tradition\" and as such, Louis XV cited this as \"precedent\" when he dreamed up titles for his grandsons.\n\nLouis XIV created the first born son of the dauphin, \"duc de Bourgogne\". By rights, the \"Petit Dauphin\" should've been \"duc d'Anjou\". The \"duc de Berri\" was named to the title, but the lands attached to it were the traditional lands belonging to the dukedom of Alençon (and Berri's children would've been titled \"d'Alençon\" rather than \"de Berri\"). Louis XIV then created the eldest son of the \"Petit Dauphin\" the \"duc de Bretagne\", and again, relegated \"Anjou\" to a secondary status for Louis XV.\n\nLouis XV followed the traditional pattern of \"dauphin\" and \"Anjou\" for his own kids but then got \"imaginative\" for his grandsons.\n\nEldest son of the dauphin was \"duc de Bourgogne\" (Louis XV cited the precedent set by Louis XIV)\n\nSecond son of the dauphin was \"duc d'Aquitaine\" (not Guienne, which was the traditional dukedom that had passed to all of Charles VI's sons except the youngest). Although I'm unaware of the reason for this creation. May simply have been that Louis thought the Anjou title was \"bad luck\"\n\nThird son was \"duc de Berri\" (again, precedent set by Louis XIV)\n\nFourth son was \"comte de Provence\" (unaware of the reason for this creation).\n\nFifth son was \"comte d'Artois\" (see reason cited in my previous post).\n\nIt's telling that on his marriage, Provence was given the \"dukedom of Anjou\" for his revenues, and then, in 1774, Louis XVI gifted his brother also the dukedoms of Vendome, Maine and Alençon. Same for Charles X, he was created comte d'Artois, but, post 1774 his revenues came from the \"dukedoms of Berri, Angoulême, Mercoeur and the county of Ponthieu\" (all lands which had been granted to the duc de Berri under Louis XIV's lettre de cachet).\n\nThen there was also the return of La Grande Mademoiselle's inheritance to the crown in the dying years of Louis XV's reign. The sale of several titles/lands had practically gone through before Louis XVI cancelled it on his accession (ICR why he did this), which meant that, on the death of the comte d'Eu (last surviving child of the duc du Maine), those titles went to the duc de Penthièvre and thus into the house of Orléans.\n\nWhich means that titles aren't necessarily \"fixed\" in France. It seems that the titles are subject to a combination to the whim of the monarch and what's available at the time. It's telling to note that none of Louis Philippe's sons (except the eldest and youngest) had \"traditional\" Orléans titles (Nemours was created as such by Louis XVIII, for instance; I can't find out what Joinville's deal was; Penthièvre came from Louis Philippe's mom; Aumale was likewise a creation of Louis XVIII).\n\nObviously it depends whether the line with the title carries on or dies out.\n\nIt's been a weird thing in British history that the Dukes of York have not lived on for centuries - Frederick, son of George III had no children, for some reason Victoria did not create one, if she had it would have been where Connaught was, and thus would have outlasted several OTL Dukes of York. The next was the younger brother to Albert Victor - these were the sons of the Prince of Wales, and the eldest, Albert Victor was create Duke of Clarence, with George the youngest being Duke of York. When Albert Victor died, George became Duke of Cornwall and York - i.e. his father the Prince of Wales' subsidiary title, and his own title. He would eventually succeed as George V. George V's second son, Albert, was created Duke of York but after Edward VIII's abdication would become King George VI. Andrew as Duke of York has 2 daughters but recent reforms means that Beatrice will succeed as Duchess of York in her own right.\n\nAs can be seen, if Frederick had had children.... well they would have become king instead of Victoria, so the title would have ended anyway. If Albert Victor had lived, George Duke of York would have married someone other than Mary of Teck (cos his brother would have married her) and if he has a son, then a parallel York line would have continued. If Edward VIII had not abdicated, then Bertie's York line would have continued.\n\nIt would be the same in France, with the Duc d'Orleans - the title lived down through the generations because sons were born, and eventually one became king in 1830. So it wasn't available to give out again, and its place seems to have been taken by other titles\n\nAndrew as Duke of York has 2 daughters but recent reforms means that Beatrice will succeed as Duchess of York in her own right.\n\nI wasn't aware of this, and I find it as ridiculous as replacing the discrimination against gender (gender-blind succession) with discrimination of age (whoever gets born first). Neither factor is in anybody's control: George didn't choose to be born ahead of Charlotte or Charlotte ahead of Louis any more than people who are saying police horses are guilty of the same crimes as the police. The horse didn't have a choice in the matter, nor did George or Charlotte. But people older and (supposedly wiser) than them decided that this was how it must be, so there you have it.\n\nIt would be the same in France, with the Duc d'Orleans - the title lived down through the generations because sons were born, and eventually one became king in 1830. So it wasn't available to give out again, and its place seems to have been taken by other titles\n\nI disagree with this \"it would be the same in France\". France's title systems didn't always work the same as Britain (look in Louis Philippe's descendants after the fall of the monarchy, titles are reused, but sometimes it's not even in the same order or the same line of descendants (I had a family tree of the house of Capet on my bedroom wall as a teenager - there was one of the Habsburgs and Queen Victoria's descendants as well). That said, it's \"telling\" to note that no Orléans prince has ever been created something like \"duc d'Anjou\" any more than a Legitimist/Carlist prince has been created \"duc d'Orléans\" (even though, technically, the title of duc d'Orléans is extinct - last \"duc d'Orléans\" was Philippe (VIII), son of the comte de Paris).\n\nAs I pointed out, Nemours, Joinville and Aumale (while all in the Orléans gift basket) were never used since they'd come to the Orléans family, but were created by Louis XVIII instead. Louis XV/XVI never dictated what titles Orléans and his brothers had in similar fashion. Similarly, when Louis Philippe I became king he made very certain that the titles and estates his children were accredited did not become part of the royal demesne (this was why his daughters were \"princesses of Orléans\" and not \"princesses of France\" for instance). French titles are a headache for this reason."
