The young prince exudes a sense of nobility and grace, dressed in elaborate historical French costume. His portrait is a testament to the rich history and culture of France during this period. Louis, Duke of Burgundy was known for his intelligence and charm, making him a beloved figure among the people. As the Little Dauphin of France, he held an important position within the royal family and was seen as a symbol of hope for the future. The intricate details captured in this print by Bonnard showcase the artistry and craftsmanship that went into creating such historical works. From his ornate attire to his dignified expression, every aspect of Louis' image speaks to his importance within French society. This lithograph from Le Bibliophile Jacob's Costumes Historique de la France is not just a beautiful piece of art but also a window into the past, allowing us to glimpse into the life and times of one of France's most influential figures. Louis, Duke of Burgundy may have lived centuries ago, but through prints like these, his legacy continues to endure.\n\nRate this comment thumb_up thumb_down\n\nSAFE SHIPPING\n\n30 Day Money Back Guarantee\n\nFREE PERSONALISATION*\n\nWe are proud to offer a range of customisation features including Personalised Captions, Color Filters and Picture Zoom Tools\n\nSECURE PAYMENTS\n\nWe happily accept a wide range of payment options so you can pay for the things you need in the way that is most convenient for you\n\n* Options may vary by product and licensing agreement.
