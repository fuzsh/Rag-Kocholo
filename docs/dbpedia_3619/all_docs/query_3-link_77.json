        "text": "An important anniversary in Anglo-French history will soon be upon us. It is six hundred years since the treaty of Troyes was sealed in the Cathedral of Troyes on 21 May 1420. By the terms of this treaty Henry V, king of England (1413-1422) was recognised as heir to the French crown by Charles VI, king of France (1380-1422). Although Charles was allowed to keep the throne for the rest of his life, at his death Henry (or his heir) would become king, the Valois line thereby being displaced and a double monarchy of England and France established: ‘les deux couronnes de France et Angleterre à toujours mais perpetuellement demourront ensemble et seront à une meme personne, c’est assavoir en la personne du Roy Henry tant qui’il vivra et de là en avant ès personne des ses hoirs…et que les dits royaumes seront gouvernez…non diviséement soubz divers Roys ..mais soubz une mesme personne.’\n\nThe treaty of Troyes was surely the peak of Henry V’s achievement, finally transforming into reality the title of King of France which Edward III had first formally adopted in 1340, thereby beginning what is popularly known as the Hundred Years War. By contrast, the treaty of Troyes marked one of France’s darkest hours, since it was not only the result of several years of military failure against Henry V but also the logical outcome of civil war between the Armagnacs and Burgundians which had weakened and divided the French response to English attack.\n\nOn 10 September 1419 the henchmen of the Dauphin Charles, the last surviving son of Charles VI and expected heir to the throne, had assassinated Duke John the Fearless of Burgundy on the bridge at Montereau. Instead of the meeting between the Dauphin and Duke John leading to reconciliation and a joint endeavour against the English, it had created a final breakdown in French political society. In pursuit of vengeance the Burgundians had little choice but to agree Henry V’s terms and his acceptance as heir to the French crown as finally laid down in the treaty of Troyes. When in 1521 a Carthusian monk showed Francois Ier the skull of John the Fearless he commented ‘Sire, c’est le trou par où les Anglais passèrent en France.’\n\nWhilst there is indeed a direct link between the murder of Montereau and the treaty of Troyes, it is more accurate to see Normandy as the route by which Henry V came to his moment of triumph in May 1420. Importantly, the duchy of Normandy was the only area of France mentioned by name in the treaty. Gascony and Calais were not mentioned at all since they were deemed by Henry V already to be under his direct rule as king of England, in accordance with the treaty of Brétigny, the treaty agreed between Edward III and Jean II in 1360 when French fortunes were in a low ebb following the capture of the French king at the battle of Poitiers in 1356.\n\nClause 18 of the treaty of Troyes laid down that ‘quant il avendra que … le Roy Henry venra à la couronne de France, la duchié de Normendie et aussi les autres et chascun lieux par lui conquis ou royaume de France seront soubz la jurisidction, odbeissance et monarchie de la dite couronne de France. ‘The implication of this clause was that until Charles VI died and Henry V became king of France, Normandy remained under the direct rule of Henry. Indeed even when Henry died on 31 August 1422 leaving his infant son Henry VI as king of England and heir to the French throne, Normandy was intended to remain under direct English rule. The seal which Henry V had used in the duchy was handed over to John, duke of Bedford, who became governor of Normandy, acting in the name of Henry VI. As it happened, it was only a matter of weeks before Charles VI died and Henry VI became king of France in accordance with the treaty of Troyes. Before long, the separate administration of Normandy was ended and the duchy came once more into the direct control of the French crown of Henry VI of England.\n\nTo understand Henry V’s ambitions, and the policies which he pursued in his conquests we can learn much from his actions in Normandy. That war between England and France was likely to be reopened by Henry almost as soon as he became king of England in 1413 is partly explained by the French civil war. The English were well aware of divisions which they could exploit. Indeed they had already done so in the reign of Henry IV: in 1411 troops had been sent to help the Burgundians, and in the following year to assist the Armagnacs, in the hope that concessions might be won which restored the large swathe of territory acquired by the English in 1360, and which had been largely lost in the French military recovery under Charles V. Such French recovery had prompted Edward III and his successors to call themselves Kings of France once more, having dropped the title in the years of peace between 1360 and 1369.\n\nAware of continuing French divisions, Henry V adopted a hard line in diplomacy in the first years of his reign, and finally launched a major invasion in the summer of 1415, with, at 12,000 soldiers, the largest army to leave England since Edward III’s invasion of 1346, which culminated in the battle of Crécy. Henry’s campaign of 1415 is famous for his victory at Azincourt on 25 October but his intention had actually been for conquest : he had contracted his troops to serve for twelve months. Only Harfleur had been taken and Henry had decided to return to England rather than continuing the effort to capture more places. The conquest of Normandy was already his target, however. In this, he was creating a new strategy for the English in France which he was able to implement fully in the next expedition which he led in person in the summer of 1417, again with around 12,000 men contracted for twelve months’ service in the first instance.\n\nWhy Normandy? After all, Edward III had actually shown himself willing to abandon a claim to Normandy in 1360 in favour of territorial gains in South West France. English kings had of course ruled as dukes of Normandy until Philippe Auguste conquered the duchy in 1204, but had confirmed the loss in the treaty which Henry III made with Louis IX at Paris in 1259. The only English claim to Normandy therefore came with their claim to the crown of France as a whole, and that was indeed the claim put forward by Henry V which justified his invasions of 1415 and 1417. Strategically there were many potential benefits for the English in landing in Normandy, not least the relative ease of invasion from the south of England. The duchy was a key element in French royal resources. Therefore conquest of it would provide financial benefit to the English and a corresponding loss to the French. An invasion of Normandy was a major insult to the French in its own right as well as offering a potential base for attack on the heart of the French monarchy in the Ile de France.\n\nNo English king had ever attempted systematic conquest in France on the scale which Henry V did in Normandy. Landing at the mouth of the River Touques on 1 August 1417 Henry established control over the coastline before besieging Caen. Once that town fell, he took his army directly southwards, thereby dissecting Lower Normandy in two and making coordinated resistance all the more difficult. By the New Year he had taken Falaise and armies were sent simultaneously westwards to reduce the Cotentin and eastwards towards the Seine. As towns and fortresses fell, English garrisons were installed. By mid July 1418 almost all of Lower Normandy was under Henry’s control and he was in a position to lay siege to Rouen, the largest place ever to be besieged successfully over the whole course of the Hundred Years War. The capital of Normandy fell in January. Many places in Upper Normandy chose now to surrender rather than offering resistance. By mid summer, with the Burgundians now in control of both king and capital, serious negotiations with the English began, in which Henry insisted on Normandy becoming his.\n\nHenry had been completely absorbed in, and by, the conquest of Normandy. There is much evidence to suggest that he was inspired by memory of the Anglo-Norman duchy of the past which he was keen to recreate. After the fall of Caen he visited the tomb of Duke William in the abbey of St Stephen. He gave his soldiers and administrators lands in the duchy, a ‘Norman Conquest’ in reverse: indeed, the king called for the abbey founded by William the Conquerer on the site of the battle of 1066 to send him the roll of names of those Normans given lands in England after the Conquest. Henry also re-established old ducal institutions and officials, such as a seneschal, and even called himself duke of Normandy (alongside his title king of France) : after the fall of Rouen he appeared in Rouen castle wearing the old ducal robes, and planned to build a new palace on the north bank of the Seine at the western extreme of the city.\n\nHenry’s political strategy aimed to fan Norman separatism in a hope of winning over the population to direct English control. His chosen landing date of 1 August 1417, a date refered to on so many occasions in documents issued by the English in Normandy, was chosen deliberately : as the Feast of Saint Peter ad Vincula, where the saint was released from his chains by an angel, the symbolic intent was to liberate the Normans from their French chains and to restore the Anglo-Norman duchy of the past. He established a new chambre des comptes at Caen once the town fell to him, and staffed it with both English and Norman officials. The king’s holistic approach, combining both military and political matters, is revealed by the fact that he had a new Chancery enrolment created to record in Normandy the royal decisions taken during his conquest – the Rotuli Normannie (Roles normands). These rolls, surviving in The National Archives series C 64, record almost 8,000 royal grants and decisions taken between 1 August 1417 and the king’s death on 31 August 1422, affecting many individuals and communities in the duchy as well as the Englishman to whom he granted lands.\n\nHenry’s reign as a whole lasted nine and a half years. For at least a third of it he was in Normandy. He paid several visits in the two years following the sealing of the treaty of Troyes but most significantly, he had spent just short of two years continuously in Normandy up to the failure of the negotiations with the French at the end of June 1419. In these negotiations Henry appears to have been willing to come to a settlement based on the restoration of the lands of treaty of Brétigny along with full sovereignty over Normandy and marriage to Catherine, daughter of Charles VI. The failure of these negotiations was caused by French hopes that the duke of Burgundy and the Dauphin Charles could be reconciled with each other and act in unity against the English. Henry’s reaction was swift. He began his march towards Paris, beginning with an assault on Pontoise on 30 July, although he also expressed a wish to continue negotiations with the French king. He now added Pontoise and subsequently the whole of the Vexin to his territorial demands.\n\nAs is well known, French hopes of reconciliation of the Burgundians and Armagnacs failed in a rather spectacular manner, with the Dauphin’s henchmen assassinating John the Fearless, duke of Burgundy on the bridge of Montereau on 10 September 1419. The fear of the royal council in Paris that Henry would continue his advance towards the French capital is obvious, and led to their own overtures to the English king. Henry took advanatage of the situation. Detailed study of the events between the murder at Montereau shows that the essential terms of the treaty of Troyes – that Henry’s claim to the throne should be recognised and that the two kingdoms of England and France should have the same king once Henry or his heirs came to the French throne – were Henry’s, and were first announced to the royal council in Paris on 27 September. The notion of a double monarchy was also established, with both kingdoms living in mutual friendship and peace with each other, alongside guarantees that neither kingdom should be subordinate to the other. Henry and Catherine should marry, but henry would not require the French to pay any dowry. To the comments of the council that the English king’s demands were rather different from those he had been willing to accept in June, his emissaries responded that ‘les choses sont autres’, indicating that they were quite aware of the new situation created by the murder of Duke John.\n\nOver the next months the terms were extended further, with an explicit regency for Henry being added in by late October. By Christmas 1419 the new duke of Burgundy, Philip, had accepted Henry’s proposals, with the king at Troyes confirming this Anglo-Burgundian agreement on 17 January and condemning the behaviour of the Dauphin. Here Duke Philip had been assisted in his decision by various concessions in favour of the Burgundian party, later embodied in the treaty, but most of all by the prospect of revenge against the Dauphin and his Armagnac supporters. At the request of Duke Philip, Henry agreed not to make any truce with the Dauphin. Henry had already promised by early October to employ himself against those rebellious to Charles VI. But by the time the final terms were drawn up, this had been revised into a clause which obliged Henry to work ‘de son povir et le plus tost que faire se pourra prouffitablement ‘to bring into royal obedience all those supporting, or being of the party vulgaument appellée du Daulphin at d’Armignac ‘. The treaty of Troyes was ostensibly a treaty of peace yet it committed Henry to continue the war. Immediately after the sealing of the treaty at Troyes on 21 May 1420 Henry departed for the sieges of Sens and then Montereau, where the body of Duke John the Fearless was recovered. He spent much of his time in France thereafter in military action.\n\nHow was it possible for Henry V, the leader of the ‘ancient enemy’, who had brought humiliation on the battlefield and had conquered a major part of royal France, to be accepted as heir to the throne? The murder of John the Fearless is clearly the catalyst for the specific situation which led to the treaty of Troyes, along with fears of Henry’s military advance towards the French capital at a time of division and disarray, and with a French king known to have bouts of insanity. But there is another element to consider, which links back to the policies Henry had pursued in the conquest of Normandy. An assembly in Troyes of nobles, churchmen and town representatives in early April 1420 recommended that Henry’s terms be accepted, first because of what they had heard of the king’s character ‘ lequel on disoit estre prudent et sage, amant dieu, paix et justice ‘ ; secondly because he had real concern for the parlous state and division of the kingdom caused by the Dauphin and his party ; and thirdly that the Dauphin had broken his agreement with the Duke of Burgundy and therefore was no longer worthy of any dignity, honour or obedience. The proposed treaty was therefore deemed ‘moult convenable, moult prouffitable et necessaire‘.\n\nWhilst accepting that the French had little choice but to accept Henry’s terms given the circumstances, his reputation for justice and good government was acknowledged even by his enemies. From even the earliest days of his conquest of Normandy he had offered reconciliation. Those who accepted his rule were confirmed in their possessions and their rights. Only those who fled had their lands confiscated and granted to Englishmen, and even men who had initially resisted were often brought back into the fold, and raised to high office, as for instance, Guy de Boutellier who held out in the long siege of Rouen against him, or Louis Bourgeois whom he appointed as president of the Chambre des comptes. As we have noted, Henry encouraged the pride of the Normans in their own rights and privileges. He paid special attention to the protection of the inhabitants of Normandy against the excesses of his soldiers, the taking of provisions without payment, and the arbitary behaviour of officials, and to the protection of the church and commerce. The Norman rolls are full of examples of the rights of citizens not only being confirmed but being observed in practice. At a time of bitter civil war and disruption in France, it is hardly surprising that based on his rule of Normandy Henry should have been seen as fulfilling all the expected qualities of a military king – as strong in arms as in the exercise of justice, a protector of his people.\n\nA study of his time as regent indicates that he did not disappoint, attending diligently to government, reforming the currency and giving serious attention to law and order. In this respect he fulfilled the promises he had made at Troyes, many of which had been included in the treaty at his behest. He promised there that justice should be administered according to the laws, customs and rights of the kingdom, without exception of persons, to keep the people of France in peace and tranquility and defend them from all violence and oppression. He would not make unreasonable and unnecessary exactions on the population. He would take advice. He would maintain French institutions, to work to the profit and honour of the kingdom, to appoint able people to office, to protect and honour the king and queen.\n\nWhilst Henry, by the terms of the treaty, was to retain Normandy until he became king, he had to make concessions even in the duchy, since any of the Burgundian party who had lost out in his conquest were to be recompensed. There was to be no English take over: he promised that Charles VI should remain in France. Henry promised too that he would no longer call himself King of France. Indeed, ironically, there are signs that the treaty of Troyes was not popular in England since it was felt that Henry had to some degree sold out to the French. At the parliament of December 1420 there were explicit fears expressed that England would be subordinate to France in the future. Henry had achieved more than any of his predecessors in the war with France, but the settlement was undermined by his early death. Henry was a realist. He understood that the English claim to France could only be fulfilled if the French recognised it, and that his own rule as heir and regent depended upon his being able to draw on the support which the French owed to their acknowledged king, Charles VI. His realism remained with him to his death bed: by urging there that the English should never cease to make every effort to retain Normandy, he was acknowledging that it would not necessarily be easy for his successor to implement the terms of the treaty of Troyes. Normandy continued to hold a special place in his mind even to the end.\n\nAnne Curry*\n\n*Anne Curry is an emeritus teacher at Southampton University, and has edited La Guerre en Normandie, XIe-XVe siècle (Presses Universitaires de Caen, 2018)."
