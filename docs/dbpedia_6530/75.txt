Did you know that Elizabeth I of England was fluent in five languages? This video is all about the monarch who ruled England for 44 years and whose reign is still regarded as a golden age for England - Queen Elizabeth I.

Elizabeth I reigned as queen of England from 1558 to 1603 CE. Her 44-year reign was so long and packed with momentous events that the second half of the 16th century CE is now known as the Elizabethan era and still regarded as a 'Golden Age' for England.

Throughout her reign, Elizabeth never had children, nor did she ever nominate an heir, which meant that the throne of England went to her closest relative, James VI of Scotland the son of Mary Queen of Scots, who became James I of England, establishing the Stuart Dynasty that would rule until 1714. Elizabeth remained a popular monarch after her death and an inspirational figure going forward. “Good Queen Bess” was regularly invoked throughout the Victorian Period and in the wars of the 20th century whenever England was threatened by foreign powers, and her name still resonates today.
