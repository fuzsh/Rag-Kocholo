        "text": "About Elizabeth Tudor\n\nQueen Elizabeth I ruled England during most of Shakespeare’s lifetime. She was born on September 7, 1533, in Greenwich, and she died on March 24, 1603, in Richmond, Surrey, after 45 years as queen.\n\nEarly life\n\nThe daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, Elizabeth received the education of a prince. She knew five languages and was a talented musician, dancer, and horsewoman.\n\nBecoming queen\n\nThe dangers that surrounded Elizabeth during the reign of her Catholic sister Mary only served to make her politically savvy at an early age. When Mary died in November 1558, Elizabeth was prepared to take on the responsibility of the throne at the age of 25. She was crowned in January 1559.\n\nVictory over the Spanish Armada\n\nDuring her reign, England defeated the Spanish Armada. Because the Spanish navy was considered superior to the British navy, this victory raised the status of England in Europe.\n\n“The Virgin Queen”\n\nQueen Elizabeth I never married. She is sometimes called “The Virgin Queen.”"
