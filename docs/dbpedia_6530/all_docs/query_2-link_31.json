        "text": "Profession: Queen of England and Ireland\n\nBiography: Elizabeth I was Queen of England and Ireland, she was last monarch of the House of Tudor and was known as the \"Virgin Queen.\" She was the daughter of Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn, and was the third of Henry's children to take the throne in the years after his death.\n\nWhile Elizabeth was imprisoned during the reign of Mary I, she would succeed to the throne upon Mary's death, with Mary having failed to produce an heir. This led to the first period of enduring stability for the crown since Henry VIII, with Elizabeth ruling for 44 years.\n\nElizabeth's reign is known for its flourishing cultural aspect, particularly for English drama with the Elizabethan era being the age of William Shakespeare. The period was also characterized by the feats of various English maritime adventurers: Francis Drake, for instance, and Walter Raleigh.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy, Elizabeth navigated affairs carefully in an initial effort to avoid war with Spain. Ultimately the two would clash, however, and for this Elizabeth is known for ruling during the defeat of the Spanish Armada which had been intended to support an invasion force that would depose Elizabeth and reinstate Catholicism in England.\n\nBorn: September 7, 1533\n\nBirthplace: Greenwich, London, England\n\nStar Sign: Virgo"
