        "text": "The Pilgrims talked a little differently than we do today. If you visit the Museum's 17th-Century English Village, you will notice that the townspeople say words you know in a funny way, or even say some words you don't know at all. That's because they are speaking in 17th-century English, not 21st-century modern English.\n\nHere are a few examples of English words, greetings and phrases that would have been used by the Pilgrims. Practice them at home and you could talk like a Pilgrim too!\n\nInstead of \"Hi, how are you?\" the colonists might say:\n\nGood morrow\n\nHow now?\n\nHow do you fare?\n\nWhat cheer?\n\nInstead of \"Goodbye,\" the colonists might say:\n\nGod bye to you\n\nFare thee well\n\nPray remember me\n\nInstead of \"Cat,\" the colonists might say:\n\nMouser\n\nInstead of \"Backward,\" the colonists might say:\n\nArsy varsy\n\nInstead of \"Pillowcase,\" the colonists might say:\n\nPillowbere"
