        "text": "When Queen Elizabeth I appointed Sir Edward Osborne (grandfather of Sarah Offley Thorowgood) the first Governor of the newly formed Turkey Company in 1581, Her Majesty declared:\n\nWhere our welbeloved Subjects Edward Osborne, Alderman of our Citie of London, and Richard Staper of our said City Merchant, have by great adventure and industry, with their great costs and charges…traveled, and caused travel to be taken, as well by secret and good means, as by dangerous ways and passages both by land and sea to find out and set open a trade …into the land of the Great Turke …[and as] the said Edward Osborne hath been the principal setter forth and doer in the opening & putting in ure [Old English: take effect] of the said trade…the said Edward Osborne shall be governor of all…. [1]\n\nFrom Apprentice to Merchant\n\nHow had Edward Osborne changed from a promising Clothworker’s apprentice into a major economic force? He truly was the right man in the right place at the right time. At about age 14 or 15, Edward was apprenticed by his father, Richard Osborne of minor gentry in Ashford, Kent, to William Hewett, a master of the Clothworkers’ Company. No one could foresee their destinies. Whether or not Edward Osborne leapt from London Bridge to rescue Anne Hewett, his master’s child, he clearly was a risk taker and made the best of an opportunity. While William Hewett was achieving his own success and notoriety, Edward was learning the trade as well as making important connections. In 1553, the year that Hewett was elected Sheriff, Edward became a freeman at the Clothworkers’ Company. In 1559, when Hewett was elected Lord Mayor of London, Osborne took on his first apprentices and started trading unfinished cloth in Antwerp. Whatever incident or reasons made Sir William Hewett decide to give his only living descendent in marriage to his former apprentice around 1562, he had chosen wisely. [2] See post: The Fall of Anne Hewett\n\nWool broadcloth production had fueled England’s economy for much of the medieval period and was the primary export to Northern Europe in the 16th century, despite a mid-century decline. However, around the time of Sir William’s death in 1567, Edward decided to leave the Clothworkers’ Company for new ventures, and for the next 10 years, he exported dyed and dressed English cloth to Spain and Portugal in exchange for oil, raisins, wine, and spices. Osborne started a lifetime partnership with Richard Staper, who had married Dionis Hewett, William Hewett’s niece, and they were named assistants in the new Company of Spain and Portugal. During that time, Osborne also became more influential in political affairs, becoming an Alderman of the City of London in 1573 and its Sheriff in 1575-76. [3]\n\nOpening Eastern Trade Routes\n\nOsborne and Staper set their sights on an ever-expanding horizon. In 1575, they arranged to import goods from Bombay and started to explore possibilities of opening more trade to the East, either along the long land route through Poland and Russia or a sea route through the pirate-infested Mediterranean. They first focused on the northern land route and became prominent in the Eastland Company and then the Muscovy Company in the search for the elusive northeast passage to China and the Pacific Ocean. Osborne was also approached about opening trade in Brazil in 1578, and he did give some financial support to Sir Francis Drake in his West Indies exploits. Everyone seemed to want Osborne and Staper on the team. However, their interests lay in the East, not the West. [4]\n\nWhile Anthony Jenkinson secured permission to trade in Turkey from Suleyman the Magnificent in 1553, that did not open up regular trade with England. At their own expense, Osborne and Staper secretly sent agents through Poland to Constantinople (Istanbul) in 1575 to initiate negotiations and, by 1578, the reigning sultan Murad III granted Osborne’s factor, William Harborne, safe passage to Constantinople and free access to the Turkish domains. Harborne was a skilled negotiator and, despite attempts by the French to undermine English access, he obtained permission for English merchants to trade with Turkey as well as guarantees that they could come and go by land and sea without molestation. That, however, did not stop trouble from the Barbary pirates or other privateers/pirates (including some English) in the Mediterranean Sea. [5]\n\nThe England-Turkey Connection\n\nQueen Elizabeth received envoys from Istanbul, and she and Sultan Murad III corresponded in Latin to arrange the final details. Harborne was appointed the English ambassador, and in 1581 Queen Elizabeth sanctioned the formation of the Turkey Company as noted above which granted 12 merchants under the leadership of Osborne a monopoly on the trade with Turkey for 7 years. Of the 12 merchants, 10 had been involved with the Spanish Company and 9 with the Muscovy Company. These were prestigious and experienced merchants.[6]\n\nThe Ottoman Empire reached its peak during the reign of the prior sultan Suleyman, the Magnificent, from 1520-1566. Murad III had only been the ruler since 1574 when he was approached by Osborne’s emissaries. Despite a history of conflict between Muslims, Christians, and Jews, the Ottomans allowed some toleration of religion in this period as long as taxes were paid and laws followed. The Queen and Sultan expressed mutual respect. Murad addressed Elizabeth in one of his letters as “the pride of women who follow Jesus, the most excellent of the ladies honoured among the Messiah’s people, the arbitress of the affairs of the Christian community….” Murad even suggested that there could be an alliance between them as Spain was a mutual enemy and he thought Protestantism had more in common with Islam than with the idolatrous Roman Catholicism. With the 1585 outbreak of hostilities between England and Spain, they considered a collaborative Muslim-Protestant campaign against Spain, but the Ottomans were instead pulled into conflict with Persia.[7]\n\nTurkish Delights\n\nOpening trade with the Turks made a dramatic shift in how English merchants did business. While the still ongoing Company of Merchant Adventurers made their money through cloth exports, the Turkey Company was primarily focused on the money to be made in imports. These Turkey merchants, as they were called, imported the much desired raw silk, mohair, cotton, carpets, tapestries, medicines, spices, Corinth currants, white soap, and indigo dye in exchange for highly prized English tin, kerseys, cloth, and tanned cony (rabbit) skins. There was widespread English support for this endeavor, and even the Queen invested in this joint stock venture. In its first 5 years, the Turkey Company made 27 voyages using 19 ships and paid over £ 11,359 in customs. They reported a 300% profit through the selling and re-exporting of the goods, despite some loses through piracy. However, the Company had to provide the money to maintain the ambassador in Constantinople and make payments to the Turks.[8]\n\nDespite the controlled monopoly, competition developed with the Venice Company of English merchants which had been set up in 1583 to circumvent Venetian trade tariffs, particularly on currants. There was much overlap in the cargoes of the two companies. When it came time for their charters to be renewed in 1588-89, both appealed to the Crown. The Turkey Company prevailed with an agreement to create the new Levant Company which would incorporate both. Some merchants, however, were jealous of the success of the few and argued against the monopoly and/or engaged in illicit trade. The new charter was issued January 7, 1592, authorizing an expanded 53 merchants to hold a monopoly of trade with the Middle East over 12 years with Sir Edward Osborne again as their first governor. However, Osborne was in ill-health by the time the charter was finalized, and he died a month later on February 4, 1592. He was succeeded by his partner Richard Staper.[9]\n\nOn to India\n\nOsborne and Staper were not content, however, with just the Turkish trade. As they were establishing the Turkey Company, they also funded an expedition of John Newberry to Persia in 1580-82 and the later famous expedition of Newberry, Ralph Finch, William Leedes, and John Eldred through Persia on to India in 1583. The group went to Aleppo, then Baghdad, and into the Persian Gulf where they were captured and imprisoned by the Portuguese. They escaped in 1584, and Newberry, Leedes and Finch made it to north central India where Leedes stayed as the court jeweler (his prior occupation). Eldred returned from Syria in 1588 with, according to Hakluyt, “the richest ship of English merchant’s goods that ever was known to come into this realm.”\n\nNewberry died trying to return to England, while Fitch continued further into India, to the base of the Himalayas, and through Burma (Myanmar). He served as the Levant Company’s Consul in Aleppo and Tripoli. When Fitch finally returned to England eight years later in 1591, he had been presumed dead and his will had been proved. However, he was very much alive and became a crucial advisor when the East India Company was formed from the Levant Company in 1600.[10]\n\nThe Currency of Currants\n\nThe English appetite for the sweet black Corinth currants (yes, those tiny dried grapes) and peppercorns helped transform the English economy. The amount of currants imported by the Levant Company skyrocketed, and they were reported to have imported as many as 2,300 tons a year. These Zante currants, as they are known today, provided a sweetness to foods in an era when Europe was discovering its sweet tooth through New World sugar cane production. Venetian merchants had tried to control the currant trade from the Greek Isles, but it continued to be the most lucrative staple of the Levant Company for many years. The English still love currants in their hot cross buns and Christmas fruit cakes. The supply of raw silk and cotton imported through the Levant Company was also important and gradually led to the establishment of the silk and cotton weaving industries in England.[11]\n\nBecoming Sir Edward Osborne\n\nEdward Osborne’s success as a merchant led to other honors. In 1583 he was elected by the city’s aldermen to be the Lord Mayor of London, and he was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I on February 2, 1584. It was in his year as mayor that the Throckmorton plot was discovered in which some English Catholics planned to rise up against Elizabeth, supported by a French and Spanish invasion, to place Mary, Queen of Scots, on the throne. In 1586, Sir Edward was elected as a Member of Parliament and was among the group who supported the execution of Mary Queen of Scots after the Babington Plot of that year was discovered. Edward Osborne was a brilliant and tough business man who used available loopholes, but was also known to be fair and was sometimes asked by the Privy Council to arbitrate merchant disputes.[12]\n\nThis portrait commonly associated with Sir Edward Osborne was included in a later printing of Richard Hakluyt’s “The Principal Navigations” and was found at Hornby Castle, the home of the Dukes of Leeds. Many have questioned its connection, as Sir Edward never served in the military and would have been more likely painted in wealthy merchant attire or the robes of office. The Company of Clothworkers has recently identified this portrait as John, 1st Lord Mordaunt of Turvey, not Edward Osborne.[13]\n\nFamily Issues\n\nAnne Hewett stood by her husband’s side through his times as merchant and mayor, but sadly died in 1585, leaving five surviving children– Alice (married Sir John Peyton, 1st Baronet in 1580), Hewett (married Joyce Fleetwood in 1588), Anne (married Robert Offley on February 3, 1588), Edward (married Alice Boteler/ Butler, then Frances Harvey), and Jane (married John Wellbye). Sir Edward himself remarried in 1588 ( making 3 family weddings that year) to Margaret Pratt Middleton Chapman, but they had no children. He prepared a will, but there is no evidence it was probated, so it is reported he died intestate. The will stated that his widow would receive her third, a third would go to his eldest son Hewett, and the remaining third was to be divided between his widow and his “unadvanced” children, the two older married daughters each having already received a generous dowery.\n\nAnne’s husband, Robert Offley, had joined Sir Edward as a Turkey Merchant, and he and Richard Staper were designated to be overseers of Sir Edward’s will. They likely settled his business affairs. However, Sir Edward’s widow quickly remarried again, and inheritance disputes arose between Osborne’s children and their step-mother Margaret Pratt Middleton Chapman Osborne Clarke. An agreement was reached that she could hold onto the Philpot Lane property in exchange for other estate properties. While the tiny statue one can see today on a building on Philpot Lane of two mice fighting over cheese was created long after the Osbornes lived there, it is rather symbolic of the struggle for his property. [14]\n\nSir Hewett Osborne did not pursue his father’s merchant career, but instead studied law at the Inner Temple and became a soldier, fighting with English forces in France, in the capture of Cadiz, and in Ireland where he died in a skirmish in 1599. His son, Sir Edward Osborne (II) became the 1st Baronet of Kiveton, but it was his son (Edward I’s great grandson) Thomas Osborne who achieved the greatest notoriety as the 1st Duke of Leeds. Despite scandals and a brief time in the Tower of London, he was one of the Immortal Seven who invited William III, Prince of Orange, to depose James II in the Glorious Revolution in 1688. The 12th and last Duke of Leeds, Francis D’Arcy Osborne died in 1964, and the dukedom became “extinct” for lack of male heirs. Lady Camilla Osborne, the living daughter of the 11th Duke, could not inherit the title or peerage, as she was a woman.\n\nOn another family line, Sarah Offley (Thorowgood), the daughter of Robert Offley and Anne Osborne, was the first of Sir Edward I’s descendants to live in the New World. Although she was born after her grandfather had died, she seemed to have inherited his tenacity and love for adventure. See prior post: The Fascinating and Formidable Sarah Offley Thorowgood Gookin Yeardley\n\nA Merchant Prince\n\nSir Edward Osborne was buried at St. Dionis Blackchurch on February 15, 1592 where a statue was erected in accordance with his will near his usual seat. Unfortunately, the statue was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. He was not forgotten, though. In summation of Osborne’s ventures, historian A.C. Wood concluded “With argosies on all the seas and ventures in every clime, he [Edward Osborne] was in fact the prototype of the merchant prince of the modern world.”[16]\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1.
