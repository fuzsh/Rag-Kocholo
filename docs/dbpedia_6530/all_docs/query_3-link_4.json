        "text": "Hatshepsut (c1507 BC–c1458 BC)\n\nAncient Egyptian pharaoh\n\nOne of only a few known ancient Egyptian female pharaohs, Hatshepsut reigned in her own right from c1473–58 BC. However, Hatshepsut’s royal reign really began in c1479 BC when she acted as regent for her infant stepson, Thutmose III. By the end of his seventh regnal year, Hatshepsut had been crowned king and had adopted all pharaonic titles and regalia, co-ruling with her stepson. In images, she was depicted with a male body wearing the traditional pharaonic kilt, crown and false beard.\n\nAmenhotep III (c1401 – c1350 BC)\n\nPharaoh of Egypt\n\nDuring his long reign, Amenhotep III presided over a golden age during the 18th dynasty when Egypt was the most powerful nation on Earth. Although his grandson Tutankhamun is far more widely known today, it is Amenhotep III who was taken as the ultimate role model by subsequent monarchs. The finest Egyptian craftsmanship was created under his personal patronage, as was the ambitious construction programme that made him the most prolific builder in Egyptian history.\n\nGreat reputations\n\nMember exclusive | In our podcast series, expert historians discuss the contested reputations of key historical figures, charting the lives and afterlives of Cleopatra, Napoleon Bonaparte, Emmeline Pankhurst and more…\n\nListen to all episodes now\n\nAlexander the Great (356 BC–323 BC)\n\nKing of Macedonia\n\nWhen the son of Philip II of Macedon inherited the throne in 336 BC, he set about reasserting Macedonian authority in Greece, aiming to conquer the Persian empire. By the time of his death in Babylon at the age of 32, Alexander had created an empire that spanned three continents and covered around 2 million square miles. Commenting on what makes Alexander the Great such a ‘great’ leader, historian Professor Paul Cartledge said: “He combined immense personal charisma and bravery (he often led his troops from the front). Plus he had a priceless ability to identify the key moment in a battle and act decisively to ensure he won that moment.”\n\nAshoka the Great (c304–c232 BC)\n\nIndian emperor of the Maurya Dynasty\n\nAshoka the Great was an Indian emperor of the Maurya Dynasty who ruled over most of the Indian subcontinent from c268–c232 BC. Considered one of India’s greatest emperors, he also promoted the spread of Buddhism across ancient Asia. The Ashoka Chakra (the “wheel of righteousness”) appears on the flag of modern India.\n\nJulius Caesar (100 BC–44 BC)\n\nRoman ruler, general and statesman\n\nA successful politician and general who greatly expanded the extent of the Roman republic, Julius Caesar seized power in 44 BC, naming himself consul and dictator. He implemented a number of wide-ranging reforms – including the introduction of the Julian calendar – and is considered to have been a great military leader who conquered Gaul and invaded Britain twice. Caesar’s assassination, carried out by a group of republican senators on the Ides of March, was to become the focal point of one of William Shakespeare’s most famous history plays.\n\nCleopatra (69 BC–30 BC)\n\nLast active pharaoh of ancient Egypt\n\nThe last active pharaoh of Egypt, Cleopatra helped bring prosperity to a divided country but is more often remembered for relationships with Julius Caesar and Mark Antony, her alleged beauty and her suicide – possibly by snake bite – after defeat by Octavian. She assumed control of Egypt in 51 BC following the death of her father and initially co-ruled with her brother, Ptolemy XII.\n\nDiscover the lives of 100 of the most influential and important women in history – both famous and lesser-known – that have changed the world.\n\nRead about more women who changed the world\n\nCaesar Augustus (63 BC–AD 14)\n\nConsidered the first Roman emperor\n\nThe man born Gaius Octavius and known as Octavian was adopted by Julius Caesar as his heir. After defeating Antony and Cleopatra at the battle of Actium in 31 BC, he took the name Augustus and became Rome’s first emperor in 27 BC. Read more about Augustus’s bloody rise to power by Adrian Goldsworthy, author of a biography of the emperor.\n\nJesus Christ (c6-4 BC–30 AD)\n\nReligious leader central to Christianity\n\nMuch of the information we have about the life of Jesus comes from the four Gospels, written between c60 and 90 AD – decades after his death. They tell us that Jesus was the son of God, born to the wife of a carpenter in Nazareth, crucified in Jerusalem. Christianity, based on the teachings of Jesus, is the world’s biggest religion with more than 2 billion followers. It originated in the Middle East, and spread across Europe, Syria, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor and Egypt, becoming the Roman empire’s official religion in AD 380.\n\nRead more | When did Christianity first arrive in Britain?\n\nBoudica (c30–60)\n\nAncient British queen of the Iceni tribe\n\nQueen of the Iceni people living in what is now Norfolk and parts of Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, Boudica (also called Boudicca or Boadicea) led a daring revolt against the Romans who invaded Britain in AD 43. Her forces destroyed Colchester – capital of Roman Britain – as well as London and St Albans.\n\nMore from us\n\nHistoryExtra members can explore this topic further with exclusive content from our archives\n\nWhat if Boudica had defeated the Romans?\n\nBoudica’s rebellion: a blood-soaked blow to the Roman empire\n\nWhat did Boudica’s Iceni warriors look like?\n\nNot a HistoryExtra member? Explore our latest membership offers\n\nKing Arthur (possibly sixth century)\n\nLegendary British warrior and king\n\nThis legendary British king takes centre stage in a plethora of TV dramas, film adaptations and novels. Although he is largely considered to be a figure of folklore, some historians – notably archaeologist Miles Russell – suggest that King Arthur is a composite of several real medieval characters.\n\nWu Zetian (624–705)\n\nEmperor of China\n\nWu Zetian is the only woman ever to have sat as emperor of China in her own right. She ruled from 690 to 705 and was ruthless in her quest for power, killing her own newborn child and framing her predecessor’s empress for the murder. “Wu Zetian was clearly a dangerous person to know, particularly if you were standing in the way of her route to power,” says Professor Rana Mitter.\n\nRead more | Empress Wu Zetian: the only woman to rule China\n\nAlfred the Great (849–899)\n\nKing of Wessex\n\nBest known for his defeat of the Danish king Guthrum’s Viking forces in 878 at the battle of Edington, Alfred is also remembered for his social and educational reforms. “There are many Anglo-Saxon kings who were great military commanders – what makes Alfred stand out is that he was also interested in learning, and in the promotion of English as a written language,” says Barbara Yorke, professor emerita of early medieval history at the University of Winchester. Part of a pelvic bone thought to belong to the Wessex king was discovered in a box at Winchester Museum in 2014. He is also the only English monarch known as ‘the Great’.\n\nÆthelflæd (c870–918)\n\nAnglo-Saxon ruler of Mercia\n\nThere is little information on Æthelflæd's childhood; she first appears in the historical record as an adult married to Æthelred of Mercia, who had served King Alfred as a loyal lieutenant. Their marriage brought together the kingdoms of Wessex and the newly reclaimed Mercia. \"Æthelflæd is one of the few known women who not only held a role within the household as mother and lady, but also wielded power on the battlefield,\" says historian Janina Ramirez. \"She went on to secure some of the most significant victories in battle of the early 10th century.\"\n\nHarold II (c1022–1066)\n\nEngland’s last Anglo-Saxon king\n\nHarold II, also called Harold Godwinson, was the last crowned Anglo-Saxon king of England. He held the crown for nine months before he was killed by Norman invaders under William the Conqueror at the battle of Hastings.\n\nRead more | Why is Harold Godwinson a hero of the Bayeux Tapestry?\n\nWilliam the Conqueror (c1028–87)\n\nFirst Norman king of England\n\nThe first Norman king of England, William the Conqueror (previously William, Duke of Normandy) defeated the Anglo-Saxon king Harold II at the battle of Hastings on 14 October 1066 – a triumph famously recorded in the Bayeux Tapestry. William the Conqueror transformed the face of Anglo-Saxon England: he secured his hold on the lands he had invaded, replacing the English ruling class with Norman counterparts and building defensive fortresses at strategic points throughout the kingdom. Under William the feudal system [a hierarchical system in which people held lands in return for providing loyalty or services to a lord] was introduced; the church was reorganised and England’s links to Europe were strengthened. But no one at the time called William ‘the Conqueror’ – the earliest recorded use of that nickname occurred in the 1120s, and the name didn’t become commonplace until the 13th century.\n\nEmpress Matilda (1102–67)\n\nClaimant to the English throne\n\nNamed heir to the throne by her father, Henry I, Matilda would have been England’s first queen regnant after his death. Instead, however, her cousin Stephen of Blois seized the throne. In the resulting civil war Matilda came within days of coronation before being forced to abandon her claim. Her son was later crowned Henry II.\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine (c1122–1204)\n\nQueen of France, Queen of England, mother of Richard I and John\n\nEleanor, Duchess of Aquitaine, became one of the most powerful women in Europe when she married Louis, heir to Louis VI of France in late July 1137. The French king died the following month and Eleanor became queen of France, a title she would hold for 15 years. Her second marriage to the future Henry II saw her become queen of England. Two of her sons, Richard and John, would go on to become kings of England, while Eleanor herself played a key role in the successful running of Henry’s empire, managing territories in England and France. In 1189 she acted as regent for Richard I when he departed for the Middle East to join the Third Crusade, despite being in her mid-sixties.\n\nHenry II (1133–89)\n\nFirst Plantagenet king of England\n\nThe son of Empress Matilda continued his mother’s fight for the English throne, winning the crown in 1154 following the death of Stephen. Henry II’s feud with Thomas Becket, archbishop of Canterbury, ended with Becket’s murder in Canterbury Cathedral in 1170, allegedly on the king’s orders.\n\nWilliam Marshal (c1146/47–1219)\n\nAnglo-Norman soldier and statesman\n\nKnight, advisor, tournament fighter: William Marshal (c1147–1219) had quite the CV – not to mention the five kings he called employers (Henry II, Henry the Young King, Richard, John and Henry III).\n\n“Two aspects of his life stand out,” says Thomas Asbridge, author of the Marshal biography The Greatest Knight (Simon & Schuster, 2015). “Firstly, his unprecedented rise to the heights of power and social status, and secondly, the abiding sense that he believed in the value of chivalry and honour.”\n\nHis services to the crown included becoming guardian to Prince Henry (later Henry the Young King) and serving as King John’s closest advisor. After John’s death in 1216, Marshal became regent for nine-year-old Henry III. Marshal is seen by many as the architect of Magna Carta.\n\nRichard I (1157–99)\n\nEnglish king, known as ‘the Lionheart’\n\nAn expert military tactician, Richard I – also known as Richard the Lionheart – is perhaps the most famous crusader of the Middle Ages (although he ultimately failed to take Jerusalem). He is most notably remembered for his confrontation with the Muslim leader Saladin during the Third Crusade, as well as for rebelling against his father, Henry II (1133–89).\n\nRead more | Does Richard I deserve his reputation as a martial genius?\n\nGenghis Khan (1162–1227)\n\nFounder of the Mongol empire\n\nGenghis Khan wasn’t always known as such; he was born in c1162, the son of a tribal warrior chief, and named Temujin. Over the course of a century, Khan and his successors built the largest contiguous empire in the history of the world – the Mongol Empire, a 12-million-square-mile swathe of land that stretched from the Sea of Japan to the grasslands of Hungary in the heart of Europe.\n\nKing John (1166/67–1216)\n\nKing of England who sealed Magna Carta\n\nKing John is perhaps best known as being the king who sealed the historic document Magna Carta. His reign was blighted by civil war, a French invasion and numerous acts of cruelty and betrayal – so it’s no wonder that John remains a controversial monarch. “Many argue that Magna Carta was a long time in gestation, and that many of the grievances expressed in 1215 had been brewing for decades,” says Marc Morris, author of a biography on the much-maligned king. “My view is that more blame should be placed on King John himself.”\n\nRead more | Why King John was truly a dastardly monarch\n\nSimon de Montfort (c1208–65)\n\nRebel baron and early of Leicester\n\nFrench-born nobleman Simon de Montfort came to England in 1229. He quickly became one of King Henry III’s favourites – and was even married to the king’s sister, Eleanor – but went on to lead a revolt against Henry III during the Second Barons’ War. His victory against Henry in May 1264 at the battle of Lewes made him the most powerful man in the kingdom.\n\nEdward I (1239–1307)\n\nKing of England\n\nEdward I is considered one of the great medieval kings, credited not just with beginning the unification of the British Isles, but also for masterminding vast improvements to England’s legal system. Son of King Henry III, he was crowned king of England at Westminster Abbey on 19 August 1274.\n\nRead more | Reassessing Edward I: battle-hungry aggressor or dutiful conqueror?\n\nMansa Musa (c1280– c1332/37)\n\nEmperor of Mali\n\nMansa (emperor) Musa I, who ruled the Mali empire for 25 years from about 1312, has a claim to being the richest person who has ever lived. He inherited an unprecedentedly wealthy empire and spent a great deal of his reign enlightening himself and his people, establishing a new centre of knowledge in the city of Timbuktu. “What’s incredible about his story is that Musa ruled with absolute power – yet, by focusing on learning and on writing things down, he divested some of that power,” says Gus Casely-Hayford, director of London’s V&A East.\n\nIsabella of France (1295–1358)\n\nQueen consort of Edward II\n\nIsabella of France married King Edward II of England in Boulogne, northern France, on 25 January 1308 when she was 12 and he was 23. She went on to lead an invasion of England that ultimately resulted in the deposition of her king and husband in January 1327 – the first ever abdication of a king in England.\n\nJohn of Gaunt (1340–99)\n\nThird surviving son of Edward III\n\nJohn of Gaunt, third surviving son of King Edward III of England, is notable for being a commander in the Hundred Years’ War. Following the death of his father and his brother Edward the Black Prince, John became effective regent of England during the minority reign of his nephew, Richard II. In October 1399, after overthrowing Richard II, John’s eldest son was crowned Henry IV, the first Lancastrian king of England.\n\nKatherine Swynford (1350–1403)\n\nThird wife of John of Gaunt\n\nIn 1396, John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster, made the somewhat surprising decision to marry his children’s governess, Katherine Swynford. Katherine – a widow – had previously been the wife of one of Gaunt's retainers, Hugh Swynford, with whom she had two or possibly three children. She gave birth to four children with John of Gaunt, who were subsequently legitimised under the name ‘Beaufort’ and would go on to found the most famous dynasty in British history: the Tudors.\n\nOwain Glyndwr (c1350–c1416)\n\nWelsh ruler and rebel\n\nOwain Glyndwr was a Welsh leader who instigated a long-running rebellion against English rule in Wales in the 14th century. On 16 September 1400, Glyndŵr was proclaimed Prince of Wales – the last native Welsh person to do so. His fate is uncertain, though one chronicler recorded that he died in 1415. He is considered a Welsh national hero.\n\nHenry V (1387–1422)\n\nKing of England and victor at Agincourt\n\nCreated Prince of Wales at his father’s coronation in 1399, young Henry’s military prowess was noted at the battle of Shrewsbury in which he fought, aged just 16. Henry V owes much of his reputation as one of England’s greatest medieval warrior kings to William Shakespeare. Henry V (c1599) depicts the transformation of the young prince from wayward youth to heroic ruler, leading England and Wales to victory against the French at the battle of Agincourt – a significant encounter in an era of conflict between the two countries known as the Hundred Years’ War. Henry became heir to the French throne in 1420 but died, probably of dysentery, just two years later, leaving his nine-month-old son to rule as Henry VI.\n\nJoan of Arc (1412–31)\n\nFrench martyr, saint and military leader\n\nJoan of Arc (c1412–31) became a heroine of the Hundred Years’ War thanks to her actions at the siege of Orléans, only to be executed as a heretic two years later. \"Her tale is both profoundly familiar and endlessly startling: the peasant girl sent by God to save France, dressed in armour as though she were a man; the martyr who became a legend – and later a saint – when she was burned at the stake by the English enemy,\" says Helen Castor.\n\nCecily Neville (1415–95)\n\nMother of Edward IV and Richard III\n\nCecily Neville, mother of Richard III, is typically glossed over in the story of the Wars of Roses. But behind the scenes, she fought her own war, using intrigue, manipulation and the power of words to support her family’s struggle for power.\n\nVlad the Impaler (1431–76)\n\nPrince of Wallachia, Romania\n\nVlad the Impaler – or Vlad III – was prince of Walachia (now in Romania). His methods of punishment – impaling his enemies on stakes – gained him notoriety in 15th century Europe and it is suggested that he may have served as inspiration for Bram Stoker's acclaimed gothic novel Dracula.\n\nElizabeth Woodville (1437–92)\n\nQueen consort of Edward IV\n\nA widow and a commoner, Elizabeth Woodville married Edward IV in secret. She was crowned queen in 1465, whereupon she promoted many members of her family to positions of power. Her story was the focus of the 2013 BBC drama The White Queen, based on Philippa Gregory’s historical novel series The Cousins’ War.\n\nEdward IV (1442–83)\n\nFirst Yorkist king of England\n\nEdward IV became king in 1461 after his Yorkist forces defeated the Lancastrian king Henry VI at the battle of Towton. His reign was interrupted in 1470 when Margaret of Anjou reclaimed the throne for her husband, Henry VI. The remainder of Edward’s rule was fairly peaceful but after his death his sons, Edward and Richard (the ‘princes in the Tower’), disappeared in mysterious circumstances during the reign of his younger brother, Richard III.\n\nRead more | 7 things you (probably) didn’t know about the houses of Lancaster and York\n\nMargaret Beaufort (1443–1509)\n\nMother of King Henry VII\n\nBorn in 1443, Margaret Beaufort belonged to a Lancastrian noble family with royal ancestry. By age 13, she had been married twice, widowed and given birth to a son, Henry Tudor. Margaret went on to marry two more times and survived several regime changes during the Wars of the Roses, as Lancastrian Henry VI was deposed by Yorkist Edward IV, before Edward’s brother Richard III eventually took the throne. After the battle of Tewkesbury in 1471, her son Henry Tudor went into exile, returning to England in 1485 to defeat Richard at the battle of Bosworth and claim the crown as Henry VII. “Margaret played the 15th-century game of power-politics with bravery and determination,” says historian Michael Jones. “On 22 August 1485, her perseverance was rewarded when her son, Henry Tudor, defeated Richard III at the battle of Bosworth to become king.”\n\nChristopher Columbus (c1451–1506)\n\nItalian explorer and navigator\n\nChristopher Columbus was an Italian explorer and navigator long credited with the discovery of the New World (although Vikings had technically visited North America many centuries previously). His transatlantic adventures were sponsored by Ferdinand II and Isabella I of Spain.\n\nIsabella I of Castile (1451–1504)\n\nQueen of Castile and Aragon\n\nIsabella of Castile was one half of a 15th-century power couple that united Spain and helped propel the west towards global dominance. Married to Ferdinand of Aragon – whom she had been betrothed to since the age of six – she became queen in December 1474. “he impact of her legacy on Spain was significant and she is today considered one of Spain’s most revered monarchs.\n\nLeonardo da Vinci (1452–1519)\n\nItalian Renaissance polymath\n\nThe illegitimate son of a Tuscan lawyer, Leonardo da Vinci became one of the most influential artists, sculptors, engineers, scientists and inventors of the Renaissance. The parachute and the helicopter are just two of many inventions credited to the Italian genius, while his painting known as Mona Lisa remains one of the most recognisable, and reproduced, portraits in the world.\n\nRichard III (1452–85)\n\nKing of England\n\nHe’s loved, he’s loathed, he’s been dug up and reburied: it’s the divisive Plantagenet king Richard III (1452–85). Interest in the Yorkist king reached fever pitch in 2012 when his remains were found beneath a Leicester car park. Mystery still surrounds Richard, not least whether he was responsible for the deaths of his nephews – the princes in the tower – who mysteriously disappeared from the Tower of London in the summer of 1483.\n\nRichard III’s death at the battle of Bosworth heralded the dawn of the Tudor dynasty as Henry Tudor took the throne of England, marrying Richard’s niece, Elizabeth of York. Five monarchs would sit on the throne for more than a century of Tudor rule.\n\nAnne Neville (1456–85)\n\nQueen consort of Richard III\n\nAnne Neville was wife to both the last Lancastrian heir to the throne of England and later the last Yorkist king, Richard III. She married the latter in the spring of 1472, when she was still in her mid-teens, and had a son with him named Edward. In 1483 Richard was appointed Lord Protector of his 12-year-old nephew Edward V, who had become king following the death of his father. However Edward and his younger brother were soon declared illegitimate and thrown into the Tower of London. They disappeared shortly afterwards, in what is considered as one of history’s enduring mysteries. Richard ascended the throne and, with Anne, was crowned in 1483 in the first joint coronation in 175 years. Anne died at the age of 28, due to tuberculosis.\n\nHenry VII (1457–1509)\n\nFirst Tudor king of England\n\nBorn to the teenage Lancastrian Margaret Beaufort, Henry VII’s claim to the throne lay in a distant kinship to Edward III. In 1471, when Edward IV’s Yorkist forces defeated the Lancastrians at the battle of Tewkesbury, Henry was forced to flee to France but after Edward’s death he returned to claim the throne. Henry’s victory over the usurper king Richard III at the battle of Bosworth in 1485 saw a new dynasty ascend to the throne of England, the unification of the houses of Lancaster and York, and an end to the Wars of the Roses.\n\nRead more | How Edward IV reclaimed his throne at the battle of Tewkesbury\n\nElizabeth of York (1466–1503)\n\nQueen consort of Henry VII\n\nThe eldest daughter of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville, Elizabeth of York united the houses of York and Lancaster with her marriage to Henry VII in 1486 – helping to end the dynastic conflict known as the Wars of the Roses. The first Tudor queen, Elizabeth was mother to Henry VIII, founding a dynasty that ruled for 118 years. Next year will see the 550th anniversary of her birth.\n\nThomas More (1478–1535)\n\nTudor statesman and author\n\nThomas More was a Tudor statesman who rose rapidly to prominence in the court of Henry VIII, where he succeeded Thomas Wolsey as Lord Chancellor. He was executed for refusing to accept Henry VIII as head of the church of England and is recognised as a saint by the Catholic Church.\n\nRead more | Thomas More: saint or sinner?\n\nMartin Luther (1483–1546)\n\nGerman theologian\n\nOn 31 October 1517, after witnessing corruption in the Catholic church, German theologian Martin Luther supposedly nailed his 95 Theses to the door of the Wittenberg Castle church. In them, he condemned the practice of selling ‘indulgences’ to absolve sin and stated that salvation could be reached by faith, not deeds. Luther was condemned by the Catholic church but his work sparked the Protestant Reformation.\n\nCatherine of Aragon (1485–1536)\n\nSpanish-born first wife of Henry VIII\n\nCatherine of Aragon was the first wife of Henry VIII. Their marriage was eventually annulled on the grounds that she had previously been married to his late brother, Arthur – allowing the king to remarry Anne Boleyn. “[Catherine] was a woman of great integrity who put principle before pragmatism and, in defying Henry VIII, showed great courage,” says Alison Weir.\n\nThomas Cromwell (1485–1540)\n\nEnglish statesman\n\nThe star of Wolf Hall – the 2015 BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel’s prize-winning novels, which focuses on his relationship with Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn – Thomas Cromwell rose from blacksmith’s son to Henry VIII’s right-hand man. After six years as chief minister, he was executed for treason, without trial.\n\n“Cromwell was a fascinating man who held sway at court for a decade and changed England’s religious and political life forever,” says historian Tracy Borman, author of a 2014 biography on the controversial politician. “He masterminded some of the most seismic events in our history, from the break with Rome to the revolution in government. Far more than a cynical bureaucrat in search of personal gain, he was committed to reform, and undoubtedly Henry VIII’s most faithful servant.”\n\nMargaret Tudor (1489–1541)\n\nDaughter of Henry VII, sister of Henry VIII\n\nMargaret Tudor, the eldest daughter of Henry VII and Elizabeth of York, is almost forgotten compared with other members of her famous family. And yet she briefly presided over a golden period in Scottish history as the wife of James IV.\n\nHenry VIII (1491–1547)\n\nKing of England\n\nOne of the most famous kings in British history, Henry became heir to the throne after the death of his brother, Arthur, in 1502. Known for his six wives, two of whom were beheaded, Henry VIII is also remembered as the father of the English Reformation, which saw the country break with the Catholic church in Rome and establish its own Church of England. Henry’s 37-year rule also saw permanent changes to the nature and role of parliament, wars with Scotland and France, and the creation of the Royal Navy.\n\nAnne Boleyn (c1501–36)\n\nWife of Henry VIII and mother of Elizabeth I\n\nAnne Boleyn was Henry VIII’s second wife, and mother to one of England’s greatest queens – Elizabeth I. The king’s determination to annul his marriage to Catherine of Aragon to marry a woman with whom he was infatuated, sparked the English Reformation and a break with the church of Rome. But after failing to give Henry the son he craved, Anne was sentenced to death, having been charged with adultery, incest and conspiring the king’s death. Debate still rages as to whether she was the victim of a court conspiracy or actually guilty.\n\nKatherine Parr (1512–48)\n\nSixth and last wife of Henry VIII\n\nThe sixth and last wife of Henry VIII, Katherine Parr has gone down in history as the wife who 'survived'. But according to historian Derek Wilson, she “was the cleverest, most devout and passionate of Henry VIII’s bedfellows”, holding an important place in the history of the English Reformation.\n\nRead more | Katherine Parr: the truth about the wife who ‘survived’\n\nAnne of Cleves (1515–57)\n\nGerman-born fourth wife of Henry VIII\n\nAnne of Cleves was Henry VIII’s fourth wife. The royal couple were married for just six months, making her the shortest reigning of all Henry’s queens. She is often referred to as the 'ugly wife' – according to reports, Henry VIII was so revolted when he first clapped eyes on Anne that he immediately instructed his lawyers to find a way to end the marriage.\n\nCatherine de Medici (1519–89)\n\nItalian noblewoman and queen of France\n\nCatherine de Medici was the queen mother of France during the reign of her three sons: Francis II of France, Charles IX of France, and Henry III of France. She is remembered for being one of the most powerful French queens of the early modern period. However, none of her sons were able to secure the dynasty and Catherine was ultimately blamed for many of the atrocities that occurred during their reigns.\n\nCatherine Howard (c1524–42)\n\nFifth wife of Henry VIII\n\nCatherine Howard was the fifth wife of Tudor king Henry VIII. They married on 28 July 1540, just three weeks after the annulment of the king’s brief marriage to Anne of Cleves. At nearly 50 years old at the time of their wedding, Henry was at least 30 years older than the teenage Catherine. Their relationship ended in tragedy when Henry discovered information about Catherine’s sexual past – including an affair with Thomas Culpeper. She was charged with adultery and treason, and executed at the Tower of London on 13 February 1542.\n\nBess of Hardwick (1527–1608)\n\nElizabethan noblewoman\n\nElizabeth ‘Bess’ of Hardwick was the richest woman in England after Queen Elizabeth I towards the end of her life, and yet she hailed from comparatively humble beginnings. Born to a moderately prosperous Derbyshire gentry family, Bess accumulated her wealth through a series of marriages that propelled her into aristocratic and royal circles. She had a somewhat tumultuous relationship with the queen, particularly when Bess began grooming her granddaughter Arbella to succeed to the crown.\n\nElizabeth I (1533–1603)\n\nQueen of England\n\nElizabeth I is one of England’s best-loved monarchs. Her refusal to dilute her power through marriage earned her the soubriquet ‘the Virgin Queen’, while her navy’s famous victory over the Spanish Armada in 1588 won her the adulation of her nation. Elizabeth’s reign also heralded an age of exploration and discovery in the New World.\n\nOda Nobunaga (1534–1582)\n\nJapanese feudal lord\n\nOda Nobunaga was born during a period in which Japan was split into warring fiefdoms whose samurai fought endless battles with one another. Oda, who inherited a fief in central Japan, used firearms and surprise tactics to defeat his enemies. He used the power he gained to unify Japan and lived by the motto “rule the realm by force”. “In battle after battle, Oda showed himself to be a first-class tactician. He defeated far larger forces than his own by using surprise attacks,” says Dr Christopher Harding.\n\nRead more about Oda Nobunaga\n\nLady Jane Grey (1537–54)\n\nQueen of England for nine days\n\nNamed queen on 9 July 1553 in a bid to prevent the Catholic Mary Tudor acceding the throne after the death of Edward VI, the ‘Nine Day Queen’ is often seen as a victim of her power-hungry family. She was charged with high treason and executed in 1554. But was Lady Jane Grey really an innocent victim? Read more about her tragic story here\n\nFrancis Drake (c1540–1596)\n\nEnglish admiral and navigator\n\nOne of the most famous seamen of the 16th century, Sir Francis Drake is best known for being the first Englishman to circumnavigate the earth. Sponsored by Queen Elizabeth I, Drake initially attempted the feat in November 1577, although bad weather forced him to turn back. He tried again in December 1577, beginning his venture from Plymouth and setting sail for the Pacific coast on his ship the Pelican. Drake and his men returned to Plymouth, England, on 26 September 1580, after successfully circumnavigating the earth. He was knighted for his efforts.\n\nRead more | Francis Drake’s forgotten role in the English slave trade\n\nMary, Queen of Scots (1542–87)\n\nScottish queen and French queen consort\n\nHaving become queen of Scotland at just six days old, Mary returned to her homeland in 1561 after the death of her husband, the French king Francis II. She became the focus of several plots to place her on the English throne and was eventually sentenced to death by her cousin, Elizabeth I.\n\nAkbar (1542–1605)\n\nMughal emperor\n\nAkbar was the grandson of Babur, founder of the Mughal empire, who in 1525 invaded northern India from Afghanistan. Under Mughal principles, princes did not inherit the throne by primogeniture but were instead expected to fight for it – subsequently, Akbar was crowned as a teenager in a Punjab field in a bid to forestall rivals. Over the course of his rule, he reconciled the majority of inhabitants of an overwhelmingly Hindu empire to Muslim rule. “This almost exact contemporary of the English queen Elizabeth I transformed a foreign occupation into a strong, cohesive empire of 100 million ethnically and religiously diverse people,” says historian Diana Preston. At the time of his death – on 15 October 1605, a date that may also have been his own birthday – he had more than 300 titular wives.\n\nWilliam Shakespeare (1564–1616)\n\nEnglish poet, playwright and actor\n\nWilliam Shakespeare, Stratford-upon-Avon’s most famous son, remains one of the world’s most well-known yet enigmatic authors. His works have been translated into some 80 languages, and the Oxford English Dictionary credits him with introducing almost 3,000 words to the English vocabulary. As well as writing 37 plays and 154 sonnets, Shakespeare was also an established actor who performed before James VI and I.\n\nBorn in 1564, much about the playwright’s life remains a mystery. Yet the fevered speculation about everything from his authorship to his sexuality is perhaps only a reflection of our fascination with the Bard.\n\nLady Arbella Stuart (1575–1615)\n\nEnglish noblewoman\n\nFirst cousin twice removed to Elizabeth I, Arbella was at one time considered a possible heir to the Virgin Queen. She died in the Tower of London after being imprisoned there by King James VI and I for marrying without his permission.\n\nOliver Cromwell (1599–1658)\n\nEnglish soldier and statesman\n\nOliver Cromwell appeared on the political scene in 1628 when he became MP for Huntingdon, and opposed Charles I’s interpretation of Protestantism, which clashed with his own strict Puritan views. During the Civil War, Cromwell became one of the commanders of parliament’s New Model Army, and in 1649 was one of 59 signatories on Charles I’s death warrant. In December 1653 he became lord protector of England, Scotland and Ireland; his brutal treatment of Irish Catholics remains controversial.\n\nRead more | Oliver Cromwell: Hero or Villain?\n\nCharles I (1600–49)\n\nKing of England, Scotland and Ireland\n\nCharles I is remembered for his belief in the divine right of kings (the idea that a monarch’s authority is bestowed by God). His clash with parliament resulted in the Civil Wars, the conflict between Royalists and Parliamentarians that wracked the British Isles in the middle of the 17th century.\n\nCharles II (1630–85)\n\nKing of England, Scotland and Ireland\n\nCharles II was the first surviving son of King Charles I and Queen Henrietta Maria, born on 29 May 1630 – the first child to be born as heir to the three crowns of England, Scotland and Ireland. The so-called ‘Merry Monarch’ was restored to the throne in 1660, marking the end of 11 years of republican rule that followed the execution of his father, Charles I. His reign saw London engulfed in flames, thousands die from plague, and a financially crippling war with the Dutch.\n\nLouis XIV (1638–1715)\n\nFrench monarch, known as the Sun King\n\n“Louis is best remembered today for his domestic achievements,\" says historian Philip Mansel. \"He earned his place among the pantheon of French monarchs through his actions on the home front – ruthlessly consolidating his control of an increasingly centralised France; weakening the influence of the Paris parlement and the military might of great nobles to give himself a secure power base. And he was a master at projecting that power – most notably through the enormous palace of Versailles, which he completed between 1666 and 1688.”\n\nRead more | King of the world: how Louis XIV turned France into a global power\n\nIsaac Newton (1643–1727)\n\nMathematician, astronomer and physicist\n\nRecognised as one of the most influential physicists and mathematicians in history, Isaac Newton was key to the 18th-century scientific revolution. Among many achievements, his work laid the foundations for classical mechanics and calculus. “There are always new stories to tell about the Briton who invented gravity and unwove the colours of the rainbow,” says historian Patricia Fara.\n\nCatherine the Great (1729–96)\n\nEmpress of Russia\n\nThe daughter of a minor German prince, Catherine (born Sophie Friederike Auguste von Anhalt-Zerbst) became a member of Russian royalty following her marriage to Grand Duke Peter, heir to the Russian throne. Catherine overthrew her husband shortly after he became tsar in 1762, and was declared empress, a title she would hold for more than 30 years. Expanding the empire was her priority: territories gained during her reign include Crimea, Belarus and Lithuania. She was also a great patron of the arts and education.\n\nGeorge Washington (1732–99)\n\nFounding father and first US president\n\nA founding father of the United States, George Washington commanded the Continental Army that won independence from the British, and stood as the nascent America’s first president. He presided over the Philadelphia Convention that drew up the US Constitution and once declared that “the Constitution is the guide which I will never abandon”.\n\nThomas Jefferson (1743–1826)\n\nFounding Father and third US president\n\nThomas Jefferson is one of American history’s greats: he was the 3rd President and the lead author of the Declaration of Independence, the ground-breaking document that laid the foundations for the modern-day United States.\n\nMarie Antoinette (1755–93)\n\nAustrian-born queen of France\n\nKnown for her extravagant tastes and lavish spending, Austrian archduchess Marie Antoinette became queen of France and Navarre in 1774 when her husband, Louis XVI, took the throne. She met a bloody end during the French Revolution when she was executed by guillotine.\n\nRead more | Did Marie Antoinette really say “let them eat cake”?\n\nAlexander Hamilton (c1755/57–1804)\n\nAmerican statesman and politician\n\nAlexander Hamilton came to the attention of George Washington during the American Revolutionary War, becoming the general’s aide-de-camp. After training as a lawyer, he was elected to the lower house of the New York legislature and eventually earned himself a place at the Constitutional Convention as representative for New York. Hamilton was consequently one of the founding fathers of the US Constitution, and had a profound influence on its ratification. When Washington was elected to the presidency, he appointed Hamilton the country’s first secretary of the treasury.\n\nHoratio Nelson (1758–1805)\n\nBritish naval commander\n\nHoratio Nelson’s naval career began when he was 12. By the age of 21 he had become a captain, seeing service in the West Indies, the Baltic and Canada. But it was during the Napoleonic Wars that Nelson’s extraordinary talents as a commander and tactician came to the fore, notably at the battle of the Nile in 1798, during which he completely destroyed Napoleon’s French fleet. Between 1794 and 1805 Nelson contributed to a number of naval victories against the French – losing both the sight in one eye and an arm in the process – but it was the battle of Trafalgar, on 21 October 1805, that propelled him into the history books. Victory in that battle saved Britain from the threat of invasion, but cost Nelson his life.\n\n1st Duke of Wellington (1769–1852)\n\nBritish prime minister and military leader\n\nIrish-born Arthur Wesley (Duke of Wellington from 1814) joined the army in 1787, and subsequently demonstrated his military talents. He is best known for his victory against Napoleon at the battle of Waterloo in June 1815. “Victory at Waterloo ushered in decades of peace for Europe, brought a long overdue end to the Napoleonic Wars and snuffed out Napoleon’s extraordinary, expansionist career for good,” says historian Justin Marozzi, who nominated the ‘Iron Duke’.\n\nNapoleon Bonaparte (1769–1821)\n\nFrench military and political leader\n\nDescribed by many as one of the greatest military leaders in history, Napoleon Bonaparte rose to prominence in the wake of the French Revolution, becoming commander of the French army in Italy in 1796. His talents as a commander and strategist saw Napoleon win a number of battles during the French Revolutionary Wars of 1792–1802, conflicts fought between the French Republic and several European powers.\n\nIn 1799, Napoleon was made First Consul of France, and crowned himself emperor in 1804. “He was a towering historical figure and military genius,” says historian Professor Peter Hart.\n\nJane Austen (1775–1817)\n\nEnglish novelist\n\nEnglish novelist Jane Austen’s first known writings date from c1787, with Sense and Sensibility the earliest of her novels to be published in her lifetime, in 1795. Austen, who never married, is celebrated as one of England’s favourite authors: her six novels – all published anonymously at first – are a window into the life of the landed gentry in the 18th and 19th centuries. She is believed to have died of Addison’s disease, an endocrine disorder.\n\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839)\n\nRuler of the Sikh empire\n\nMaharaja Ranjit Singh, the \"Lion of Punjab”, founded the Sikh empire and presided over an era of toleration and stability. He also famously owned the Koh-i-Noor – one of the largest cut diamonds in the world. “His reign marked a golden age for Punjab and north-west India,” says historian Matthew Lockwood. “Under his leadership, infrastructure was improved, commerce opened and expanded, and the arts flourished.”\n\nBenjamin Disraeli (1804–81)\n\nBritish prime minister\n\nTwice prime minister, Disraeli was a key player in the creation of the modern Conservative party. The first Jewish-born prime minister (although he was baptised a Christian during childhood), Disraeli was a staunch opponent of Liberal William Gladstone, and their mutual loathing was well known. A firm favourite of Queen Victoria, Disraeli did much to improve public health in Britain, and passed laws to prevent labour exploitation.\n\nMary Seacole (1805–1881)\n\nMary Seacole was a Caribbean-born, Anglo-Jamaican businesswoman and pioneer nurse best known for the comfort that she provided for wounded British soldiers in the Crimean War. Her 1857 autobiography, Wonderful Adventures of Mrs Seacole in Many Lands, is one of the earliest memoirs of a mixed-race woman. In 2004 she was voted the greatest black Briton, and in 2016 a statue of her was erected in the grounds of St Thomas’ Hospital, London.\n\nIsambard Kingdom Brunel (1806–59)\n\nBritish civil and mechanical engineer\n\nIsambard Kingdom Brunel built the most ambitious bridges, ships and railways of the 19th century. From his office at 18, Duke Street, London, he spearheaded an engineering empire involving a professional staff comprising some 30 engineers, clerks and draughtsmen working on multiple projects at a time.\n\nRead more | 7 famous Victorians: from Brontë to Brunel\n\nAbraham Lincoln (1809–65)\n\n16th US president and opponent of slavery\n\nAbraham Lincoln, who became the 16th US president in 1861, led the Union to victory in the American Civil War of 1861–65 and introduced the 13th Amendment of 1865, which abolished slavery in the US. But although he managed to prevent the fragmentation of the country, Lincoln saw only six weeks of peace during his tenure and was assassinated in April 1865.\n\nCharles Darwin (1809–82)\n\nBritish naturalist, geologist and biologist\n\nDarwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection – that the varying survival of individual organisms with different characteristics in specific environments results in the promotion of those traits – brought him into conflict with the Anglican church. His groundbreaking work The Origin of Species was published in 1859, provoking outrage among creationists. But his 1871 Descent of Man caused even more controversy with its claims that humans and apes were descended from a common ancestor.\n\nWilliam Gladstone (1809–98)\n\nBritish prime minister\n\nLiberal politician William Gladstone served as British prime minister four times – more than any other – and campaigned on a variety of issues including reforms to the justice system and the civil service. Gladstone was regarded as a champion of the working classes, spent large amounts of his own money on what he saw as the rescue and rehabilitation of prostitutes, and spoke out against slavery. But his views provoked strong reactions, and he was not always popular. Queen Victoria disliked him immensely, describing him as a “half-mad firebrand”. One of Gladstone’s major acts was the Representation of the People Act of 1884, which increased the number of men who were eligible to vote in an election. But his proposed bills to allow a system of home rule in Ireland never became law.\n\nCharles Dickens 1812–70\n\nBritish writer and social critic\n\nCharles Dickens is widely regarded as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. He wrote a string of bestselling novels and short stories including The Pickwick Papers, Nicholas Nickleby, A Christmas Carol and Great Expectations and invented some of literature’s best-known characters. His books are still in print and have been adapted for stage and screen.\n\nHe was buried at London’s Westminster Abbey.\n\nKarl Marx (1818–83)\n\nGerman philosopher and political theorist\n\nThe theories of socialist philosopher Karl Marx on the role of class struggle in economic change have influenced intellectuals, labour unions and political parties across the world. His 1848 work The Communist Manifesto, co-written with Friedrich Engels, has been described as one of history’s most important political manuscripts.\n\nQueen Victoria (1819–1901)\n\nBritish queen and empress of India\n\nQueen Victoria, the United Kingdom’s former longest-reigning monarch (overtaken by Elizabeth II in September 2015), ruled for more than 63 years. Her empire spanned Canada, New Zealand, Australia and swathes of Africa and she became Empress of India in 1876. Her links with other royal families prompted the nickname ‘grandmother of Europe’.\n\nFlorence Nightingale (1820–1910)\n\nFounder of modern nursing\n\nFlorence Nightingale led the first official team of British military nurses to Turkey during the Crimean War, fought between Britain and Russia (1853-56). More soldiers died from disease than wounds in this conflict and Nightingale – as well as tending the sick – reported back to the army medical services on how to reduce avoidable deaths. Nicknamed ‘the Lady with the Lamp’ for the night rounds she made tending to the wounded and sick, Nightingale continued in her work after the war and was instrumental in establishing a permanent military nursing service and implementing improvements to the army medical services.\n\nNikola Tesla (1856–1943)\n\nSerbian-American inventor\n\nInventor and engineer Nikola Tesla first travelled to America in 1884 with just four cents in his pocket and began working at Edison Machine Works improving DC generators. His invention of the induction motor that would work with alternating current (AC) is considered a milestone in modern electrical systems.\n\nRead more | Edison, Westinghouse and Tesla: the history behind The Current War\n\nEmmeline Pankhurst (1858–1928)\n\nBritish suffragist and political activist\n\nIn 1903, the social reformer Emmeline Pankhurst founded the Women’s Social and Political Union to campaign for the parliamentary vote for women in Edwardian Britain, ‘Deeds, not words’ being its motto. A charismatic leader and powerful orator, Pankhurst roused thousands of women to demand, rather than ask politely, for their democratic right in a mass movement that has been unparalleled in British history. Always in the thick of the struggle, she endured 13 imprisonments, her name and cause becoming known throughout the world.\n\nCândido Rondon (1865–1958)\n\nEngineer\n\nColonel Cândido Rondon was an army engineer who laid more than 4,000 miles of telegraph line through the jungles of Brazil. His expeditions into the Amazon included exploring the Western Amazon Basin, but his most famous was the Roosevelt–Rondon scientific expedition in 1913–14. In 1910, he was appointed the director of the Indian Protection Service (SPI). He encouraged the later creation of the Xingu National Park, a territory where both indigenous people and the environment are protected. In Brazil, Rondon is a national hero, and the state of Rondônia is named after him.\n\nSitting Bull (1831–90)\n\nNative American leader\n\nSitting Bull was a warrior who fought against US forces in Red Cloud’s War (1866–68). He played a key political and strategic role in the Great Sioux War of 1876, and fought at the battle of the Little Bighorn. As settlers encroached on the northern plains, slaughtering buffalo herds and irrevocably disrupting traditional nomadic life, he joined Buffalo Bill’s Wild West Show. Viewed as a leader by his people until the end, Sitting Bull died when an attempt to arrest him ended with his being shot in the chest and head.\n\nMarie Curie (1867–1934)\n\nPolish-French physicist and chemist\n\nMarie Curie’s discoveries of strange, glowing radioactive elements rocked Victorian Europe. Hailed as a 'celebrity scientist' in her lifetime, she was the first female to win the Nobel Prize in 1903 – for her pioneering research on radioactivity – and the first person to win a second Nobel Prize.\n\nTsar Nicholas II (1868–1918)\n\nLast emperor of Russia\n\nTsar Nicholas II was the last emperor of Russia until he abdicated under duress during the February Revolution of 1917, amid a military crisis and domestic unrest. By renouncing the throne, he brought an end to the Romanov royal dynasty that had ruled Russia for more than 300 years. Nicholas was replaced by a provisional government until October 1917, when the country was engulfed by revolution once again, as the Bolsheviks – led by Vladimir Lenin – seized control.\n\nMahatma Gandhi (1869–1948)\n\nBorn to a wealthy Hindu family in north-west India, Gandhi’s first experiences of nonviolent civil disobedience came while he was practising law in South Africa, in response to the Indian community’s struggle for civil rights. In around 1921 he became leader of the Indian National Congress, leading campaigns for a number of social causes and to end British rule in India. One of his most famous protests was the 240-mile Dandi Salt March of 1930, challenging the British-imposed salt tax. Gandhi was assassinated in 1948.\n\nVladimir Lenin (1870–1924)\n\nRussian communist revolutionary\n\nVladimir Ilyich Ulianov was a fanatical Marxist who led the Bolsheviks to power in 1917 and built – on a foundation of war and oppression – the world’s first communist state. He envisioned the end of capitalism at the hands of the working classes of the world and – through a series of revolutions – laid the foundations of communist totalitarianism under Joseph Stalin.\n\nWinston Churchill (1874–1965)\n\nBritish wartime prime minister\n\nVoted the Greatest Briton in a 2002 BBC poll, storming home with just over 28 per cent of the votes, Churchill is remembered as the man who led Britain to victory during the Second World War. He was prime minister from 1940–45 and again from 1951–55, standing down as an MP in 1964 after a political career spanning more than six decades. Churchill’s speeches, delivered during some of Britain’s darkest days, are rated among the most rousing in history, but many of his strategic decisions – particularly the blanket bombing of German cities continue to divide opinion. Churchill was also a talented artist and exhibited some 50 works at the British Academy. A keen writer, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1953 for, in the judges’ words, “his mastery of historical and biographical description as well as for brilliant oratory in defending exalted human values”.\n\nSamuel Coleridge-Taylor (1875–1912)\n\nBritish composer/conductor\n\nSamuel Coleridge-Taylor was a British composer and conductor who wrote a number of acclaimed pieces of music. He entered the Royal College of Music as a teenage violinist but soon showed great ability in composition. In 1898, he composed the cantata ‘Hiawatha’s Wedding Feast’, which became a great success, and he was invited to perform in the US on several occasions. However, the royalty agreement he signed for ‘Hiawatha’ earned him relatively little money and his family were left impoverished when he died of pneumonia aged only 37.\n\nJosef Stalin (1878–1953)\n\nSoviet revolutionary and dictator\n\nDictator of the USSR from 1929 until his death, Stalin transformed the Soviet Union into an industrial and military superpower.

He died in 1945 when he was captured by anti-fascist partisans.\n\nAdolf Hitler (1889–1945)\n\nDictator of Nazi Germany\n\nAdolf Hitler joined the German Workers’ Party, later known as the Nazi Party, after Germany’s surrender at the end of the First World War. Identifying with the party’s nationalist, anti-Semitic beliefs, in 1921 he became its leader.\n\nIn 1933 he was appointed chancellor of Germany, and began to mandate the exclusion of Jews and other ‘undesirables’ from public life, a process that would lead to the deaths of millions in concentration camps. In 1939 Hitler’s Germany invaded Poland, triggering the Second World War – a conflict that resulted in the deaths of more than 60 million people.\n\nWW2 | The Big Questions\n\nMember exclusive | Historian and broadcaster Laurence Rees explains major moments of the global conflict in this five-part series.\n\nListen to all episodes now\n\nFrancisco Franco (1892–1975)\n\nMilitary dictator of Spain\n\nSpanish general Francisco Franco ruled Spain as dictator from 1939 to 1975, following the Spanish Civil War.

In 1952 Turing was convicted of gross indecency – the charge resulting from a homosexual affair. He chose chemical castration over imprisonment but committed suicide in 1954.\n\nRosa Parks (1913–2005)\n\nAmerican civil rights activist\n\nRosa Parks was an American civil rights activist best known for her pivotal role in the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955, when public transport in the US state of Alabama was racially segregated. She subsequently became an iconic figure in the civil rights movement. On the centenary of her birth, the then-US president, Barack Obama, called upon all Americans to honour Rosa Parks’s “enduring legacy”.\n\nJohn F Kennedy (1917–63)\n\n35th US president\n\nJohn F Kennedy – also known as Jack or JFK – was the 35th president of the United States. Elected in 1960, he was assassinated in 1963 in Dallas, Texas. Lee Harvey Oswald was charged with the murder but was himself killed before he could stand trial.

However, in 1964 he was sentenced to life imprisonment for his opposition to the regime. He was to serve 27 years in prison, most notably on Robben Island. On his release, after being elected his country’s first black leader, Mandela’s government focused on tackling the legacy of decades of apartheid.\n\nAmílcar Cabral (1924 – 1973)\n\n20th-century African independence fighter\n\nIn the 20th century, most of Africa was faced with the task of liberating itself from foreign colonial rule. The struggle for independence in Guinea was led by Amílcar Cabral, who also played a leading role in the liberation of Portugal’s other colonies in Africa. He was one of the founders of the Movimento Popular Libertação de Angola, and founder and leader of the Partido Africano para a Independência da Guiné e Capo-Verde. “Under Cabral’s leadership, the people of Guinea achieved great advances – progress that induced the government of Portugal to plot to assassinate him. His murder was carried out in 1973, just before Guinea achieved independence from Portuguese colonial rule,” says Professor Hakim Adi.\n\nMartin Luther King (1929–68)\n\nReligious activist and civil rights leader\n\nIn 1956, Baptist preacher Martin Luther King became a leading figure in organising the boycott by African-Americans of buses in Montgomery, Alabama in support of Rosa Parks, who had been arrested for refusing to give up her seat to a white man.
