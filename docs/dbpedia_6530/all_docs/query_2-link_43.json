        "text": "Almost 500 years ago, a princess called Elizabeth became Queen of England.\n\nPeople were worried. It was unusual to be ruled by a woman, because at the time, they were seen as weak and not as clever as men.\n\nBut Elizabeth proved them wrong!\n\nShe was strong, loved by many, and some say, became one of England's greatest ever rulers.\n\nElizabeth was the daughter of King Henry VIII. She didn't expect to be Queen. She was third in line to the throne. Both her brother and sister died without having children so Elizabeth became Queen.\n\nTo show people she could rule the country well, she had portraits painted of her as strong, mighty and rich, just as a queen should be.\n\nBut Elizabeth had enemies like King Philip of Spain.\n\nIn 1588, he sent the Spanish Armada, a fleet of more than 100 ships, to invade England. Elizabeth stayed strong. She told her soldiers and sailors: \"I know I have but the body of a weak and feeble woman, but I have the heart and stomach of a king, and of a king of England too.\" Her ships attacked and the weather helped blow the Armada away from England. England and Elizabeth had won!\n\nQueen Elizabeth ruled for nearly 45 years.\n\nHer reign was called the Golden Age.\n\nThere were many great artists and writers. William Shakespeare, the most famous playwright ever, performed his plays in front of her.\n\nWhile Elizabeth was Queen, England became wealthy and powerful.\n\nShe had shown that a queen could be just as strong as a king. That a woman could do as good a job as a man!"
