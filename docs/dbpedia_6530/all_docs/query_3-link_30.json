        "text": "*Originally published by Felix in February 2023 and updated by Ian S in March 2024\n\nThe 17th century is one which had the most historical activities across the globe. It was the century when the west experienced most of its developmental changes since more European nations attempted to locate new lands. These developments led to economic, political, religious and social developments across the globe. There were disruptions and movements that led to fights among nations and as a result, many people became famous as they fought for their countries’. As time passed, more and more personalities rose to fame in their fields. Some of world-renowned writers like William Shakespeare and Galileo Galilei are among the famous people during this period. These artists, scientists, and writers created influential histories that have existed for centuries.\n\nThis article will explore some of the top 20 famous people from the 1600s. Among them include:\n\n1. William Shakespeare\n\nWilliam Shakespeare was a well-recognized English poet, actor, and a play writer born in 1564. William Shakespeare was a famous figure during his time because of his writings. Shakespeare’s plays have survived for centuries as they have been replicated, rewritten, and performed on stage in the modern world. He also had poems that have continued to be a part of English teaching and poetry. William Shakespeare had 154 sonnets, two narrative poems, and 38 plays, among other poems, in his collection. Thanks to his friends who preserved his works, we can access part of the works that the legend wrote in his time. He focused on different cultural backgrounds while writing his plays, which are accepted globally in different cultures. He would later die in 1616.\n\n2. René Descartes\n\nRené Descartes, a great and creative mathematician, was born in 1596. René Descartes became an important metaphysician and scientist. He ventured into several noble careers, including mathematics, philosophy, and metaphysics. As a mathematician, he developed techniques that made algebraic equations solvable. As a natural philosopher, he was a key figure in various achievements like the co-founder of the sine law of refraction, proposing the critical account of the earth’s empirical formation, and even shaping human thinking about the world that is still used today. René Descartes would later possess many achievements in meteorology, geometry, dioptric, the discourse method, and mediations of the first philosophy. René Descartes died in 1650 from Pneumonia.\n\n3. Isaac Newton\n\nBorn in 1642, Isaac Newton was an English mathematician, astronomer, and physicist who was recognized for discovering gravity and the laws of motion. Isaac Newton is also known for inventing calculus during the mid-1660s. His discoveries would later change the world of mathematics and physics as the laws have been utilized to change the world. Newtonianism would become a huge part of science at the start of the 18th century giving relevance to his works. Isaac Newton became a dominant figure in the continent thanks to his many published works, which led to Newtonian science’s flourishing. By his death in 1727, Isaac Newton’s works and achievements had been published globally, leading to global recognition.\n\n4. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek\n\nBorn in 1632, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek would become a household name in the Netherlands and globally. He was a Dutch microscopist who discovered bacteria and protozoa in an attempt to find a cure. His numerous research materials helped in the discovery of protozoology and bacteriology. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek made highly effective microscopes using shorter focal lengths. These would come in handy at the time as they were precious. His contribution to microbiology also included discovering spermatozoa in humans and dogs in 1677. Antonie van Leeuwenhoek would, later on, be the first man to offer a description of red blood cells. His achievements were made available to the general public and generations to come through philosophy and passing on through education. He died in 1723 from a rare disease that would later be called Leeuwenhoek’s disease.\n\n5. Galileo Galilei\n\nBorn in 1564, Galileo Galilei was one of the most recognized men of his era. Galileo Galilei significantly contributed to astronomic discoveries and the strength of metals and materials. The study of motion was first initiated because of the discoveries made by Galileo on falling bodies. The field of astronomy also changed due to his findings in the 17th century. These discoveries led to the acceptance of the movement of the solar system. His continued advocacy of the system would lead to the launching of continuous interrogation against him. He would later teach mathematics and Aristotelian philosophy. Having attained many achievements throughout his career, Galileo Galilei died in 1642.\n\n6. Rembrandt van Rijn\n\nBorn in 1606 Netherlands, Rembrandt van Rijn became famous for his artworks. He was a painter whose work was recognized in the Netherlands, all of Europe, and globally, and he became Holland’s artist of the “Golden Age.” He started to work in his native Leiden, where he had also studied. He was unique in his learning because he did not travel abroad but looked keenly at other artists’ work, especially those from Italy. He was far apart from other painters because of his ability to critically study those close to him and his environment. Rembrandt van Rijn successfully created more than 300 etchings with different colors and illuminations, such as “The Three Crosses of 1653.” Rembrandt van Rijn died in 1669, a tragic year for the family because they had just lost their only son a year before.\n\n7. Louis XIV\n\nBorn in 1638, Louis XIV was the youngest man to rule France. His tenure was one of the most popular, not because he ruled for the longest. Louis XIV took over leadership at five years after his father died and ruled for the next seven decades. He had the longest reign among the European monarchs. He was the only leader who came closer to actualizing the theory of absolutism in real life. At a young age, the king faced a horror attack that made him believe that every person in the world was a threat to him. Therefore he studied tactics that would help him have absolute power over his subjects and be safe.\n\n8. William Harvey\n\nWilliam Harvey is famous today for his contribution to science by accurately describing blood circulation in a human. Born in 1578, William Harvey proved his blood circulation theory by bisecting several animal species and studying their hearts. Although his act was considered cruel to animals, his discoveries would go far to improve the science of blood circulation. Regardless, this is how he managed to arrive at his conclusion. His theory was not disapproved of as it was outstanding and replaced the previous theory by doctors suggesting that blood was pumped through the liver. One of his famous quotes, “All we know is still infinitely less than all that remains unknown,” can give us a better understanding of his continued research and work in human physiology and anatomy.\n\n9. Baruch Spinoza\n\nThere were few radical philosophers during the 17th century than Baruch Spinoza. He combined thoughts of epistemological and metaphysical principles in his works. Baruch Spinoza contributed to the current world by adding other elements from ancient medieval Jewish rationalism. He believed that God, knowledge, and philosophy significantly contributed to people’s passions, emotions, and happiness. Baruch Spinoza believed these would lay a firm ground for democratic political thoughts and continuous critics, which would depend on the scriptures of the sectarian religion. Even after he died in 1677, Baruch Spinoza’s teachings and beliefs remain relevant to the current generation.\n\n10. Johannes Vermeer\n\nJohannes Vermeer was one of the Dutch’s best artists who created different paintings and the most beloved images in art history. More than 30 of his best artworks are in various museums today to remind people about the 17th century. His art focused on the biblical themes and myths in society, making him a unique painter and artist of his time. Johannes Vermeer would later make his art pieces special, which was why so many people believed in him and followed him. Many people were willing to connect and interact with his works which came in handy, especially during the time associated with much spiritual growth. Johannes Vermeer died in 1675 after experiencing a heart attack.\n\n11. John Milton\n\nJohn Milton (1608-1674) was an English poet, polemicist, and civil servant renowned for his epic poem “Paradise Lost.” Written in blank verse during a time of religious and political turmoil, the poem addressed the fall of man and elevated Milton’s reputation as one of history’s greatest poets.\n\nHe served under the Commonwealth of England and Oliver Cromwell, and his celebrated work “Areopagitica” became an influential defense of freedom of speech and the press. Milton was a pioneer in introducing new words to the English language and employing unrhymed verse outside of theatre or translations.\n\nDescribed as the “greatest English author” by his biographer, Milton’s critical reception has oscillated due to his republicanism, but he remains regarded as a preeminent writer in the English language, revered by poets like William Blake, William Wordsworth, and Thomas Hardy.\n\nHis views developed through extensive reading, travel, and experience during the English Civil War, and despite his impoverished later years, Milton was famous throughout Europe and unrepentant about his political choices.\n\n12. Cardinal Richelieu\n\nCardinal Richelieu (1585-1642) was a French statesman and prelate of the Catholic Church, known as “the Red Eminence.” Appointed Foreign Secretary in 1616 and later chief minister to King Louis XIII, Richelieu sought to consolidate royal power and restrain the nobility, transforming France into a strong centralized state.\n\nIn foreign policy, he aimed to check the power of the Habsburg dynasty and ensure French dominance in the Thirty Years’ War, making alliances with Protestant states. Despite suppressing Huguenot rebellions, his power depended on the king’s confidence, as shown by the Day of the Dupes incident in 1630.\n\nAn alumnus of the University of Paris, Richelieu renovated the College of Sorbonne, founded the Académie Française, and patronized the arts. He advocated for New France, founding the Compagnie des Cent-Associés and negotiating the return of Quebec City to French rule.\n\nRichelieu is credited with inventing the table knife with a dull, rounded blade to discourage bad dining manners. He has been portrayed as the villain in popular fiction, notably in Dumas’s The Three Musketeers.\n\n13. Blaise Pascal\n\nBlaise Pascal (1623-1662) was a French mathematician, physicist, inventor, philosopher, and Catholic writer. A child prodigy educated by his father, Pascal made significant contributions to various fields. At age 16, he wrote a treatise on projective geometry.\n\nHe corresponded with Pierre de Fermat on probability theory, influencing modern economics and social science. In 1642, he pioneered work on mechanical calculators, establishing himself as one of the first inventors of the calculator. Like Descartes, Pascal was a pioneer in natural and applied sciences, defending the scientific method and making important contributions to the study of fluids, pressure, and vacuums.\n\nIn 1646, he and his sister identified with the Jansenist movement within Catholicism. Following a religious experience in 1654, he wrote influential philosophical and theological works, including Lettres provinciales and Pensées, which contains Pascal’s Wager, a probabilistic argument for God’s existence.\n\nHe also wrote about the arithmetical triangle and the cycloid’s use in calculating the volume of solids.\n\n14. John Locke\n\nJohn Locke (1632-1704) was an English philosopher and physician widely regarded as one of the most influential Enlightenment thinkers and the “father of liberalism.” Considered one of the first British empiricists, following Francis Bacon, Locke’s work significantly impacted epistemology and political philosophy.\n\nHis social contract theory influenced Voltaire, Rousseau, Scottish Enlightenment thinkers, and the American Revolutionaries, with his principles reflected in the United States Declaration of Independence. Internationally, Locke’s political-legal principles continue to influence limited representative government and the protection of basic rights and freedoms under the rule of law.\n\nLocke’s theory of mind is often cited as the origin of modern conceptions of identity and self, figuring prominently in later philosophers’ works.\n\nHe postulated that the mind at birth is a blank slate or “tabula rasa,” and knowledge is determined by experience derived from sense perception, a concept known as empiricism, contrary to Cartesian philosophy based on pre-existing concepts.\n\n15. Oliver Cromwell\n\nOliver Cromwell (1599-1658) was an English statesman, politician, and soldier, widely regarded as one of the most important figures in British history. He rose to prominence during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, initially as a commander in the Parliamentarian army and later as a politician.\n\nA leading advocate for the execution of Charles I in 1649, he ruled as Lord Protector from 1653 until he died in 1658. Educated at Cambridge, Cromwell was elected MP in 1628 and became a religious Independent in the 1630s. During the English Civil War, he demonstrated his military abilities and played a key role in defeating the Royalists.\n\nAfter Charles I’s execution, his military victories firmly established the Commonwealth under his dominance. However, Cromwell remains a controversial figure due to his use of the army to acquire political power and the brutality of his campaign in Ireland.\n\nHis historical reputation continues to be debated, with some viewing him as a military dictator and others as a hero of liberty.\n\n16. Queen Nzinga\n\nNzinga Ana de Sousa Mbande (c. 1583 – 1663) was a prominent southwest African ruler who governed the Ambundu Kingdoms of Ndongo and Matamba, located in present-day northern Angola. Born into the ruling family of Ndongo, she received military and political training as a child and demonstrated diplomatic skills as an ambassador to the Portuguese Empire.\n\nIn 1624, she assumed power over Ndongo after her brother’s death. During her reign, she navigated the rapid growth of the African slave trade and Portuguese encroachment in the region. Facing war with the Portuguese in 1626, her army was eventually depleted, leading her to ally through marriage with Imbangala warlord Kasanje.\n\nWith this new alliance, she conquered the Kingdom of Matamba from 1631 to 1635. Njinga formed strategic alliances, including with the Dutch West India Company, to reclaim parts of Ndongo.\n\nThough unable to capture the Fortress of Massangano, she continued fighting the Portuguese until a peace treaty in 1656, having sold nearly 200,000 slaves during her reign. In the centuries since, Njinga has been recognized as a major historical figure, celebrated for her intelligence, political wisdom, and military tactics.\n\n17. Thomas Hobbes\n\nThomas Hobbes (1588-1679) was an English philosopher best known for his influential work Leviathan, published in 1651. In this seminal book, Hobbes expounded on his formulation of social contract theory, which became a cornerstone of modern political philosophy.\n\nBeyond political theory, Hobbes made significant contributions to diverse fields such as history, jurisprudence, geometry, theology, and ethics.\n\nBorn in Malmesbury, Hobbes attended the universities of Oxford and Cambridge before becoming a tutor to the Cavendish family. His experiences during the brutality of the English Civil War from 1642 to 1651 heavily influenced his advocacy for governance by an absolute sovereign in Leviathan.\n\nThe work also popularized ideas like the state of nature (“war of all against all”) and laws of nature.\n\nIn addition to Leviathan, Hobbes’ major works include the trilogy De Cive, De Corpore, and De Homine, as well as the posthumously published Behemoth.\n\nHobbes is regarded as one of the founders of modern political philosophy, and his impact on social contract theory remains highly influential.\n\n18. Henry Purcell\n\nHenry Purcell (c. 1659 – 1695) was an English composer of the Baroque era, celebrated for his uniquely English musical style that incorporated Italian and French elements.\n\nPurcell is generally regarded as one of the greatest English opera composers, and he has been placed alongside John Dunstaple and William Byrd as England’s most important early music composers.\n\nPurcell’s compositions, which blended various influences into a distinctly English voice, have cemented his legacy as a pivotal figure in the country’s musical heritage.\n\n19. Artemisia Gentileschi\n\nArtemisia Gentileschi (1593 – c. 1656) was an Italian Baroque painter, considered one of the most accomplished artists of the 17th century. Working initially in the style of Caravaggio, she was producing professional work by age 15.\n\nIn an era when few opportunities existed for women artists, Gentileschi became the first woman member of the Accademia di Arte del Disegno in Florence and had an international clientele. Many of her paintings depicted women from myths, allegories, and the Bible, including victims, suicides, and warriors.\n\nNotable works include “Susanna and the Elders,” “Judith Slaying Holofernes,” and “Judith and Her Maidservant.” Gentileschi was renowned for her naturalistic depiction of the female figure and her skillful use of color to express dimension and drama.\n\nWhile her achievements were long overshadowed by the story of her rape and torture during the trial, Gentileschi’s life and art have been re-examined and celebrated by scholars in recent decades, with major exhibitions at esteemed institutions recognizing her talents.\n\n20. Athanasius Kircher\n\nAthanasius Kircher (1602-1680) was a German Jesuit scholar and polymath who published around 40 major works on diverse subjects like comparative religion, geology, and medicine.\n\nOften compared to Leonardo da Vinci for his vast range of interests, Kircher was honored as the “Master of a Hundred Arts.” He taught for over 40 years at the Roman College, where he set up a renowned cabinet of curiosities.\n\nWhile Kircher’s attempts to decipher Egyptian hieroglyphs were largely inaccurate, he correctly linked the ancient Egyptian and Coptic languages, leading some to regard him as the founder of Egyptology. His encyclopedia on China revealed the early presence of Nestorian Christians there.\n\nKircher studied volcanoes, and fossils, and was one of the first to observe microbes through a microscope. He proposed the plague was caused by an infectious microorganism and suggested preventive measures.\n\nAttributed inventions include a magnetic clock, automatons, and an early megaphone. Though eclipsed by rationalists like Descartes later in life, Kircher’s aesthetic works regained appreciation in modern times, with scholars describing him as “a giant” and “the last Renaissance man” who rightfully claimed all knowledge as his domain.\n\nThe 1600s was a time of rapid change, innovation, and global progress that changed the world forever. These changes were made possible by the famous people who lived during the century making history that has influenced the world today. Among other prominent people in the 17th century, scientists, writers, artists, and philosophers made contributions that are celebrated today."
