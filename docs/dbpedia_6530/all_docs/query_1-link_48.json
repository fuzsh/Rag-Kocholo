        "text": "News Story\n\nCrowned Queen of Scots at just nine months old; married, crowned Queen Consort of France and widowed all by the time she was 18 years old: Mary Stewart's life was nothing if not eventful. Let's dig into the facts about her tumultuous life and death.\n\n1542\n\n14 November: Battle of Solway Moss\n\nDevastated by his army's defeat by the English at Solway Moss, James V withdrew to Falkland Palace, Fife. He is reported to have laid down and turned his face to the wall.\n\n8 December: Mary's birth\n\nMary was born at Linlithgow Palace, to James V, King of Scots, and his French second wife, Marie de Guise. She was the only legitimate child of James to survive him. She was also the great-niece of Henry VIII of England, giving her a claim to the English throne.\n\n14 December: Death of James V\n\nJames V of Scots died just six days after the birth of his daughter. In reference to the origins of the Royal Stewart Dynasty, James is supposed to have said: 'It began with a lass and it will gang with a lass.'\n\n1543\n\n1 July: The Treaties of Greenwich\n\nThese treaties between Scotland and England included a marriage agreement between Mary and Edward, son of King Henry VIII of England. This was an attempt to gain control of Mary and weaken French influence in Scotland.\n\n9 September: Queen of Scots\n\nMary was crowned Queen of Scots aged just nine months. The ceremony was conducted in the Chapel Royal of Stirling Castle by Cardinal David Beaton, Archbishop of St Andrews. He was Scotland’s most senior Catholic cleric.\n\nDecember: The Rough Wooing\n\nThe Rough Wooing began when the Earl of Arran, the Regent of Scotland, renounced the Treaties of Greenwich in December 1543. Henry VIII attacked Scotland to force a marriage between Mary and Edward. The Rough Wooing continued until 1550.\n\n1546\n\n1 March: Murder or Martyrdom?\n\nAlarmed by the support for the Protestant Reformation, Cardinal Beaton had the Protestant reformer; George Wishart arrested and burnt at the stake. In retaliation Beaton was assassinated by Wishart’s supporters.\n\n1547\n\n28 January: Death of Henry VIII\n\nHenry VIII’s death left England with a minority government. The Duke of Somerset acted as Regent for Edward VI and continued the Rough Wooing. On 9 September 1547, the Scots were defeated at Pinkie, east of Edinburgh. Mary was sent to Inchmahome Priory for safety.\n\n1548\n\n7 July: The Treaty of Haddington\n\nThe Treaty of Haddington strengthened Scotland’s links with France. The King of France, Henri II, agreed to provide military support against England. Mary was promised in marriage to Henri’s son, the Dauphin François.\n\n7 August: La petite Royne - the little Queen\n\nAt the age of five Mary was taken to France. Henri II thought her 'the most beautiful child he had ever seen', François adored her. Henri’s wife, Catherine de Medici resented Mary as she was a Queen, giving her precedence over Catherine’s daughters in the royal nursery. In Scotland, Mary's mother, Marie de Guise was to become Regent ruling in Mary's name from 1554.\n\n1558\n\n24 April: Marriage to France\n\nMary and François married in Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris on 24 April 1558. She wore a lavishly decorated white gown. With her auburn hair and pale complexion the effect was dazzling, if unconventional. Traditionally white was reserved for royal mourning in France.\n\n17 November: Elizabeth I Queen of England\n\nMary Tudor, England’s Catholic queen, died in 1558 and was succeeded by her Protestant half-sister Elizabeth. As the great granddaughter of Henry VII of England, Mary believed that she had the stronger claim to the English throne. Henri II encouraged Mary to display the Arms of England with those of France and Scotland.\n\n1559\n\n10 July: Queen Consort of France\n\nIn April England, France and Spain signed the Treaty of Cateau-Cambrésis, bringing peace to most of Europe. Henri II was fatally wounded during a jousting tournament in June 1559, held as part of the peace celebrations. François became King, making Mary Queen Consort of France.\n\n1560\n\n11 June: Death of Marie de Guise\n\nScotland’s Protestant Lords appealed to England for support against the regency of Marie de Guise. She was forced to retreat to Edinburgh Castle, and died there on 11 June. Scotland and England signed the Treaty of Edinburgh, which ended the Auld Alliance.\n\n5 December: Death of François\n\nOn François’ death Mary was bereft. She wrote: 'My heart keeps watch for one who's gone.' Catherine de Medici became regent for her younger son, Charles IX. Keen to secure the position of her own children, Catherine made sure that Mary could not remain in France.\n\n1561\n\n14 August: Adieu to France\n\nBefore leaving France, Mary met both Catholic and Protestant delegations from Scotland. She aligned with her Protestant half-brother, Lord James Stewart (the future Earl of Moray), who advised her to maintain the religious status quo.\n\n2 September: The Royal Entry to Edinburgh\n\nMary arrived in Leith on 19 August 1561 and made her official entry into Edinburgh a few weeks later. She was presented with the keys to the city, a Bible and a book of Psalms. The celebrations blatantly promoted the Protestant cause and attacked Catholicism.\n\n4 September: First audience with John Knox\n\nMary summoned the Protestant Reformation leader Knox five times to answer allegations he made against her. During their first audience she accused him of provoking armed revolt. He compared her to the tyrant Nero. Mary held her own till Knox left, then broke down in tears.\n\n1562\n\nSummer: Heir for England?\n\nMary believed a face to face meeting would convince Elizabeth to name her as heir. Arrangements were well advanced for that summer, but were abandoned when England became embroiled in the French Wars of Religion. Elizabeth contracted smallpox, delaying a meeting still further.\n\n1563\n\nJanuary: A Spanish marriage\n\nMary considered several options for a husband. In 1563, her first choice, Don Carlos, heir to the Spanish throne, failed after he suffered brain damage in a fall down some stairs.\n\n1564\n\nMarch: An English husband\n\nElizabeth I wanted Mary to marry a Protestant and proposed the Earl of Leicester, Robert Dudley. Neither Mary nor Dudley wished the match. Mary declared she had no intention of marrying 'a mere subject of Elizabeth’s'. Dudley proposed Henry, Lord Darnley in his place.\n\n1565\n\n17 February: Henry, Lord Darnley – the right choice?\n\nHenry, Lord Darnley was a Catholic and was descended from both James II of Scotand and Henry VII of England. When Mary met him for the first time at Wemyss in Fife she thought him 'the lustiest and best proportioned lang (tall) man she had seen'.\n\n29 July: Marriage to Darnley\n\nMary and Darnley were married in the Chapel Royal of Holyroodhouse. She proclaimed Darnley King of Scots the following day without the consent of Parliament. The announcement was met with stony silence. Only Darnley’s father cried 'God save His Grace'.\n\n26 August: The Lords in revolt – the Chaseabout Raid\n\nOpposition to Mary’s marriage arose very quickly. Her half-brother, the Protestant Earl of Moray, feared that Mary’s marriage to a Catholic threatened the Reformation, so he led an attempt to overthrow both Mary and her King Consort. The episode was more an armed chase than an outright rebellion.\n\n1566\n\n19 June: A son\n\nMary's son by Darnley, James, was born in Edinburgh Castle. By this time, however, her marriage to Darnley had broken down. He had plotted against her and even been part of a conspiracy to murder her Catholic secretary, David Rizzio, in her presence.\n\n1567\n\n10 February: Murder of Darnley\n\nIn the early hours of 10 February 1567, an explosion blew up Old Provost's Lodging at Kirk o'Field in Edinburgh, where Darnley was recuperating from illness. Darnley was found dead in the garden, apparently murdered. Mary herself was implicated in the plot, but the prime suspect was James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell.\n\n15 May: Marriage of Mary and Bothwell\n\nBothwell was tried and acquitted of Darnley's murder. His next move was to abduct Mary on her return to Edinburgh from Stirling, where she had been visiting her son – for the last time, it would transpire. It is not known whether Mary was a willing participant in the plot or not, but two weeks later the couple were married. Bothwell had divorced his first wife just twelve days before.\n\n24 July: Abdication of Mary, Queen of Scots\n\nAlienated from her closest advisors, Mary’s monarchy floundered. After failing to quash a rebellion of Scottish peers, Mary was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle and forced to abdicate in favour of her one-year-old son.\n\n1568\n\n2 May: Escape from Loch Leven\n\nWith the aid of George Douglas, the owner of Loch Leven, Mary escaped and raised an army to face the forces of the Earl of Moray at the Battle of Langside on 16 May.\n\nDefeated at the Battle of Langside, Mary fled from Scotland. She crossed into England convinced her cousin and fellow monarch, Elizabeth I, would help her regain her throne. Elizabeth however was unsure how to deal with this unexpected ‘guest’ and ordered Mary’s detention at Carlisle Castle.\n\nDecember: Hearing at Westminster\n\nElizabeth wanted proof Mary was innocent of Darnley’s murder before agreeing to a meeting with Mary. Hearings were held into the matter, first at York in October, and then at Westminster in December. At this, Mary’s half-brother the Earl of Moray produced a silver casket that had belonged to Mary, in which were found some incriminating letters. However, these were almost certainly doctored to suggest her guilt. Despite no conclusive evidence, Mary was held in captivity for the rest of her life.\n\n1569\n\nFebruary: A life in captivity begins\n\nIn February, Mary was taken to Tutbury Castle in Staffordshire, which belonged to the Earl of Shrewsbury. He became her jailer for the next fifteen years, but was relatively kind to her. She was permitted a staff of 30 including Scottish nobility, her secretary, physician, maids, grooms and cooks. She was occasionally allowed to ride and her failing health was bolstered by spells at Buxton Spa. Tutbury was one of over ten castles or manor houses in which she was held.\n\n1584\n\nThe Bond of Association\n\nThere were several failed attempts to free Mary. Determined to prevent more, Elizabeth I's principal secretary and 'spymaster' Sir Francis Walsingham introduced the Bond of Association. This made Mary responsible for any plots instigated in her name, whether or not she knew about them, or approved them.\n\n1586\n\nThe Babington Plot\n\nMary was secretly corresponding with supporters, unaware that Walsingham’s agents were intercepting her letters. This allowed them to trick her into agreeing to a plot proposed by Anthony Babington, to assassinate Elizabeth I and make Mary Queen of England. This sealed Mary’s fate. She was moved to Fotheringhay Castle in Northamptonshire in September.\n\n15 October: Tried for treason\n\nMary was tried for treason at Fotheringhay Castle where she was she remained in captivity until her execution.\n\n1587\n\n8 February: Execution of Mary, Queen of Scots\n\nMary was 44 years old and had spent 19 years in captivity. Deposed by her country, abandoned by her son, all she had left was her faith. Those present at her execution spoke of her great courage and dignity. She left tokens of friendship to her friends and attendants to remember her with, including the Penicuik Jewels, reputedly left to Gilles Mowbray."
