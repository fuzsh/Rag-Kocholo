        "text": "Transcript\n\nIllegitimate daughter. Virgin Queen. Glittering symbol of a nation.\n\nWho was Elizabeth the First?\n\nElizabeth I was born on September 7, 1533, to Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn—the king’s second wife, whom he’d married in defiance of the Roman Catholic Church and expected to bear a son, not another daughter.\n\nBefore Elizabeth reached her third birthday, Henry had Anne beheaded for flimsy charges of adultery and treason.\n\nHe even convinced Parliament to declare the marriage invalid, thus making the child illegitimate.\n\nFor the first years of her childhood, Elizabeth was in no way in line for the throne. When Henry’s third wife, Jane Seymour, gave birth to a son, Elizabeth finally landed in her father’s good graces.\n\nRecognized again as legitimate, she was declared third in line for the throne.\n\nAfter Henry’s death, Elizabeth’s half-brother Edward succeeded him as king. When Edward died, Mary I succeeded him.\n\nAnd the cycle continued among Henry’s children: when Mary died in 1558, it was Elizabeth’s turn to rule. Elizabeth’s reign returned England to the Protestant Reformation, a religious shift initiated by Henry VIII’s first divorce but halted by Mary I’s dedication to Catholicism.\n\nElizabeth, like Mary, had to fight against the expectation that a queen didn’t have as much power as a king. She quickly made it clear that she intended to govern in more than name alone, and, while she surrounded herself with advisers, she didn’t hesitate to trust her own instincts over theirs.\n\nEven when everyone around her believed that she should marry, produce an heir, and ensure the line of succession, Elizabeth steadfastly refused to choose a husband—earning for herself the nickname “the Virgin Queen.” Elizabeth I died on March 24, 1603. James VI of Scotland, the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, succeeded her on the English throne."
