        "text": "Video\n\nDid you know that Elizabeth I of England was fluent in five languages? This video is all about the monarch who ruled England for 44 years and whose reign is still regarded as a golden age for England - Queen Elizabeth I.\n\nElizabeth I reigned as queen of England from 1558 to 1603 CE. Her 44-year reign was so long and packed with momentous events that the second half of the 16th century CE is now known as the Elizabethan era and still regarded as a 'Golden Age' for England.\n\nThroughout her reign, Elizabeth never had children, nor did she ever nominate an heir, which meant that the throne of England went to her closest relative, James VI of Scotland the son of Mary Queen of Scots, who became James I of England, establishing the Stuart Dynasty that would rule until 1714. Elizabeth remained a popular monarch after her death and an inspirational figure going forward. “Good Queen Bess” was regularly invoked throughout the Victorian Period and in the wars of the 20th century whenever England was threatened by foreign powers, and her name still resonates today.\n\n— SUPPORT US VIA OUR PATREON—\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/join/whencyclopedia\n\n— BUY OUR MERCH —\n\nhttps://www.worldhistory.store​/​\n\n— CHAPTERS —\n\n0:00​ Introduction\n\n0:48 Early Life of Elizabeth I\n\n3:30 Succession to the Throne of England\n\n5:34 Issues of Religion and Politics\n\n9:04 The Spanish Armada\n\n10:37 Elizabethan Culture\n\n13:03 Death and Successor of Elizabeth I\n\n14:35 Outro\n\n— WANT TO KNOW MORE? —\n\nElizabeth I of England\n\nhttps://www.worldhistory.org/Elizabeth_I_of_England/\n\nElizabeth I & the Power of Image\n\nhttps://www.worldhistory.org/article/1562/elizabeth-i–the-power-of-image/\n\nGallery of Elizabeth I Portraits\n\nhttps://www.worldhistory.org/Elizabeth_I_of_England/\n\nMary, Queen of Scots\n\nhttps://www.worldhistory.org/Mary_Queen_of_Scots/\n\nSpanish Armada\n\nhttps://www.worldhistory.org/Spanish_Armada/\n\n— WATCH NEXT —\n\nFullers of Ancient Rome (The Clothes Cleaners of Rome)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQi6Wm9CBv0\n\nAncient Rome and the Spread of Christianity\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csBHLmZ01xg\n\nThe Five Good Emperors of the Roman Empire\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYnK5IeOFGY\n\nAn Introduction to the Punic Wars - Ancient Rome vs. Carthage\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ex0ZtLjsQQg&t\n\n— ATTRIBUTIONS —\n\nYou can find all attribution and credits for images, animations, graphics and music here - https://worldhistory.typehut.com/the-life-of-tudor-queen-elizabeth-i-of-england-images-and-attributions-18485\n\nThe music used in this recording is the intellectual copyright of Michael Levy, a prolific composer for the recreated lyres of antiquity, and used with the creator's permission.
