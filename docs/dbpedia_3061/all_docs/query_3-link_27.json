        "text": "On the back cover of Peg Robarchek’s recently published faith memoir titled Welcome to the Church of I Don’t Have a Clue: My Irreverent, Post-Evangelical, Sacred Life there is a short blurb by my friend Frye Gaillard, the author of Southernization of America (with Cynthia Tucker) and many other books about the American South. Frye’s blurb reads, “In this page-turning memoir, Peg Robarchek writes of growing up in the segregated, Christ-haunted South, searching for God in all the wrong places.”\n\nI think it is fitting that Frye is listed as one of the endorsers of this book, for he is an expert on the role that religion has played in the history of the South. As Frye has discussed in many of his books, Southern culture is steeped in conflicting religious traditions. In her memoir, Peg also writes about Southern religious traditions, but she focuses on her own personal responses to these traditions. The result is an irreverent yet deeply spiritual memoir.\n\nFor much of her adult life, Peg has lived in Charlotte, and Charlotte figures in the second half of her memoir. I recently contacted Peg and asked her about how her experiences in Charlotte relate to the themes that she explores in her memoir. Here is what she sent to me:\n\nWhen I moved to Charlotte in 1980, I had no idea that the next couple of decades would change my life completely. Charlotte seemed friendly and progressive and like the perfect place to put down roots. It also came across as completely different from Birmingham, Alabama, the city where I’d grown up and escaped as soon as I was able.\n\nI found like-minded people, including other journalists and writers. I also found, however, that Charlotte did have one thing in common with my hometown—a church on nearly every corner. And plenty of those like-minded people started inviting me to their churches. This wasn’t an invitation I welcomed or expected.\n\nIn my memoir, Welcome to the Church of I Don’t Have a Clue, I share a spiritual journey that started in childhood when I walked out on church and God—a journey that ultimately brought me to a different understanding of both the Divine and a life of faith. One of the experiences that set me on a different path took place when I attended a lecture and meditation event at Charlotte’s Spirit Square. The concert and event venue on North Tryon had been a prominent church in this city of churches. It sat empty for a while after its original congregation moved to a new location. Spirit Square turned out to be a favorite spot in my new city, a place where I was able to see some of my favorite performers over the years, from Allison Kraus to Lyle Lovett to jazz great Cleo Laine, and many more. Also, as it turned out, the evening when I sat in that former church sanctuary with hundreds of others and experienced a guided meditation became a turning point in my spiritual journey.\n\nAnd ultimately, I found a community of seekers and clergy and others who became my companions on the journey to connect with the Divine, an outcome I never expected. Charlotte not only became my home in a way that my hometown never was, but it also became my spiritual home.\n\nFor readers who would like to meet Peg, Park Road Books will have a reading and book signing at 7 p.m. on Thursday, March 21. For readers who are interested in purchasing Peg’s book on Amazon, here’s the link: https://www.amazon.com/Welcome-Church-Dont-Have-Clue/dp/B0CNZRG4B9/ref\n\nAs Peg makes clear in her memoir, Charlotte’s faith community extends beyond the buildings and belief systems associated with traditional organized religion. Charlotte is sometimes known as a city of churches, bit it is also a city of stories. Peg’s memoir is one of Storied Charlotte’s most riveting and revealing accounts of a deeply personal faith journey.\n\nMy father grew up in New York City. He spent most of his boyhood living in a Jewish neighborhood in Brooklyn, and that experience shaped his taste in movies. He loved movies set in New York, and he especially loved the New York movies written by Neil Simon. He felt a special bond with Simon in part because they shared a birthday. My father was born on July 4, 1928, and Simon was born on July 4, 1927. I remember going with my father to see Simon’s The Out-of-Towners as soon as it came out in 1970, and I have loved the movie ever since. The movie stars Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis, and it deals with a middle-aged couple (Gwen and George Kellerman) who leave their home in Ohio and go to New York so that George can interview for a new job. What follows is a series of hilarious mishaps that tests the couple and changes their perspective.\n\nI thought about The Out-of-Towners when I discovered In the Key of New York City: A Memoir in Essays by Charlotte writer Rebecca McClanahan. Published by Red Hen Press in September 2020, this book is Rebecca’s eleventh book and her second memoir. Like Gwen and George Kellerman, Rebecca and her husband, Donald Devet, left the security of their comfortable home and headed off to New York City to explore new possibilities. Rebecca and Donald were about the same age as the Kellermans when they went to New York in 1998, but unlike the Kellermans, they ended up staying in the Big Apple for eleven years. Rebecca and Donald, like the Kellermans, approached New York from the perspective of outsiders, and this perspective helped them notice details that native New Yorkers often ignore as they bustle about their business. Rather than provide a chronological record of her years in New York, Rebecca writes focused essays in which she delves into particular moments and events. I recently contacted Rebecca and asked her for more information about In the Key of New York City. Here is what she sent to me:\n\nWhen my husband and I moved from Charlotte to New York in 1998, it was a midlife leap into the unknown. We’d talked for decades about living in the city someday and had visited New York whenever we could. Then one day, while we were walking on 8th Avenue celebrating Donald’s 50th birthday, I surprised myself by saying, “If we’re going to make the move, we better make it now.” That was in May, and by August we had put our house on the market, stored the possessions we had not given away, found a furnished sublet, left our jobs, and said goodbye to family and friends—and even to our cat! Neither of us is impulsive by nature, but I guess the urge was strong. We figured that with the sale of the house and our savings, we could make it for two years if we didn’t find jobs there. We ended up staying for eleven.\n\nIn the Key of New York Cityis a memoir-in-essays about the first several years of our time there. We were newcomers, outsiders, and, as is the case with most outsiders, our senses were heightened as we struggled to navigate an alien landscape. Despite my training as a military brat who moved often during childhood, I was extremely lonely at the beginning, or maybe homesick is a better word for it. We’d been comfortable in our North Carolina lives and I missed that easy comfort. I missed my home and garden, my friends and family, my students and colleagues in the writing community.\n\nMaking a community in New York was a tough learning experience, but little by little we made connections—through our new jobs, mostly, and by reconnecting with New York area friends we’d lost track of over the years. But much of the growing feeling of connection came from the constant interaction with strangers. This was due in part to street activity—with walking rather than driving, encountering diverse faces close-up and personal, hearing the broth of languages on our walks, sharing subway seats or park benches, and learning how to give each person we met their own valuable space. It may sound strange, but I discovered a new form of intimacy in those encounters. I felt part of a world much larger than myself, my neighborhood, or my circle of friends. I hadn’t expected the intensity of this feeling and it surprised and comforted me. So, sprinkled among the longer essays in the book are brief moments that suggest these connections: an encounter on the subway involving two sleeping children, the drunken young man on 8th avenue holding a dying pigeon out to me as if I might save it, the post 9/11 park scene where I see a Muslim woman in a headscarf running toward a child who is in danger. All of these encounters, and more, forced me to imagine what New York—or, indeed, our nation—might look like if we all, horror of horrors, went “back where we came from.”\n\nThe book opens and closes with scenes of Central Park. The park bench was such an important part of my experience of New York—not only as my own physical (if temporary) stake on the landscape and a place from which to view the scene, but also as an opportunity for conversations with strangers who were always eager to share their stories and their odd but intriguing wisdom. A park bench is where public and private meet, which echoes my experience of the city. The book moves between the public and the private, the joyous and the sorrowful (9/11, my cancer surgery and recovery, moments of loneliness and regret) and the present and the past.\n\nThe title (“In the Key…”) is of course related to music, and music weaves its way throughout the book: in sounds heard through apartment walls, the cacophony of the streets and subways, the music I hear during the 9/11 prayer service, and even in the hospital essay when I hear the dying man’s wife echoing his cries—an opera of shared pain. Music touches the deepest parts of our experience; it transcends language. Which is why music is such an important part of the book.\n\nIn another way, though, the “key” to New York could also be seen as an object, something that opens the door into a new experience. That is what I hope the book might do for readers, not only those readers with connections to New York. I hope that the book’s reach extends to anyone who has ever been uprooted or who has felt like a newcomer or outsider, who has longed for connection, and who has been lucky enough to experience a place that changed them in remarkable ways. Maybe that’s reaching too high, but that was my aim in writing the book. I am grateful to each and every reader. Readers make books possible. Thank you, Mark, for the opportunity to talk about my book.\n\nRebecca and Donald, like the Kellmans, have returned home. Rebecca is maintaining her connections in Charlotte, including teaching in The Queens MFA program, and Donald is working as a video producer here in Charlotte. Rebecca is having great success in her writing career, the details of which can be found on her website: http://www.rebeccamcclanahanwriter.com\n\nRebecca still sees herself as a Charlotte writer, but her experinces living in New York have rippled through her writing career in a variety of ways. Her embrace of both Charlotte and New York is reflected in the fact that she is the recipent of fellowships from both the North Carolina Arts Council and the New York Foundation for the Arts. As I see it, Rebecca’s new book adds an appealing New-York-City vibe to Storied Charlotte.\n\nFor long-time readers of The Charlotte Observer, Nancy Stancill’s name might seem familiar, for she worked as an award-winning investigative reporter and editor for the Charlotte paper for fifteen years, beginning in 1993 and ending in 2009. Although she retired from her career as a journalist, she has never stopped writing. In 2013, she published the first of two mystery novels set in Texas, where she lived before moving to Charlotte. This month, her publisher, Black Rose Writing, is releasing her memoir. Titled Tall: Love and Journalism in a Six-foot World, this fast-paced memoir explores how Nancy’s status as a six-foot tall woman has impacted her journalistic career, her relationships, and her sense of self. For more information about Tall and Nancy’s other books, please click on the following link: http://www.nancystancill.com/\n\nOne might assume that the process of writing a memoir would be a solitary endeavor, but not for Nancy. While writing Tall, she found support from former colleagues who worked with her at The Charlotte Observer, various writing teachers and mentors, and fellow writers she has met in classes and workshops. Nancy sees herself as a member of a community of writers. I recently contacted Nancy and asked her how this community of writers contributed to the writing of her memoir. Here is what she sent to me:\n\nMy biggest help in getting Tall done was a weekly class I took several times called “Under Construction.” The class is offered by Maureen Ryan Griffin each fall and spring with a few sessions in the summer. Maureen is a longtime prize-winning writing teacher who is also a gifted poet and writer. The classes usually consist of 6-8 advanced writers who are working on long-term projects. What Maureen’s class did for me was to give me deadlines. I knew that once a week I had to present a new or revised chapter to the class. My fellow classmates would offer valuable, gentle feedback. That was enormously helpful.\n\nSince I’m a former Charlotte Observer investigative reporter and assigning editor, I use my former colleagues to get good feedback as well. I normally meet with two writers every week where we do parallel writing. That means essentially that we sit at a table and work on our own projects, stopping to talk occasionally.\n\nI also have several excellent mentors. Poet Dannye Romine Powell has been an invaluable help on my two published novels set in Texas as well as my memoir. She has read all of them and given generous feedback. Another wonderful source has been former Observer copy editor Steve Johnston. Steve copyedited Tall and also takes care of my website. I don’t know what I would do without him.\n\nThere is plenty of help available to writers in Charlotte. I took a poetry class offered last spring by Charlotte Lit. Dannye Powell was teaching it. Charlotte Lit is also a great source for daylong seminars and for long-term programs for writers looking to start or finish novels or memoirs. The writers’ organization offers high-quality programs and will send out notices to members. Membership is low-cost and well worth it.\n\nTall tells the story of my life, but many people played a role in the writing of my memoir.\n\nWith the publication of Tall: Love and Journalism in a Six-foot World, Nancy joins several other Charlotte writers who have recently published memoirs. This group includes Judy Goldman, the author of Together: A Memoir of a Marriage and a Medical Mishap; Patrice Gopo, the author of All the Colors We Will See: Reflections on Barriers, Brokenness, and Finding Our Way; Molly Grantham, the author of The Juggle Is Real: The Off-Camera Life of an On-Camera Mom; and Tommy Tomlinson, the author of The Elephant in the Room: One Fat Man’s Quest to Get Smaller in a Growing America. Like these other Charlotte memoirists, Nancy shares a personal story, but in the process, she and her fellow memoirists contribute to the varied narratives that make up Storied Charlotte."
