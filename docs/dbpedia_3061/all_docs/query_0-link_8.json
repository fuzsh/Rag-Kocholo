        "text": "The University of Kansas School of Medicine celebrated the 25th anniversary of A Grand Affair on Jan. 14 at the Kansas City Convention Center.\n\nThe formal event is a celebration of the work of medical students, staff and faculty as well as an opportunity for the medical students to show their appreciation to their educators and mentors.\n\n“Every year, we set aside this night to celebrate our medical students’ commitment to and passion for their chosen profession,” said Akinlolu Ojo, M.D., Ph.D., MBA, dean of KU School of Medicine.\n\nThe event returned to its traditional time of mid-January after being moved to mid-March in 2022. At that time, the change was due to concerns about the rise in the COVID-19 variant Omicron in the Kansas City area. A Grand Affair was held as a virtual event in 2021 because of the pandemic.\n\nRainbow Award\n\nA Grand Affair’s pinnacle prize is the Rainbow Award, presented to the faculty member who exemplifies professionalism in medicine and the willingness and capacity to mentor others. The 2023 winner was Annabel Mancillas, M.D., MPH, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology.\n\nMancillas practiced as a registered nurse for three years before entering KU School of Medicine and graduated in 2011. She completed post-graduate training at Wesley Medical Center in Wichita and then worked for five years as an obstetrician/gynecologist in the Kansas City area. She is fluent in Spanish and has participated in multiple medical trips to Latin America.\n\nShe joined the University of Kansas Medical Center in 2021. “I entered medical education because I felt like there was more that I was meant to do,” Mancillas said. “Working with medical students, especially while fulfilling my passion of providing care to underserved communities, gives me hope that I can continue to foster that altruistic calling that brought so many of us to the medical profession.”\n\nA student who nominated Mancillas for the Rainbow Award wrote, “I felt compelled to nominate Dr. Mancillas because of her exemplary traits that make her an incredible clinician and teacher. … With Dr. Mancillas, no question is stupid. She makes students feel comfortable and allows students to learn by action.”\n\nMancillas said the Rainbow Award was an honor. “To be nominated by the medical students, the people who witness your direct patient/physician interactions and how you practice medicine, is such an honor because the medical students see exactly who you are as a physician on a daily basis,” she said.\n\nAdditional nominees for the 2023 Rainbow Award included:\n\nGerman Berbel, D.O., associate professor of surgery\n\nMeredith Gray, M.D., associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology\n\nLyndsey Kilgore, M.D., assistant professor of surgery\n\nMike Rouse, D.O., assistant professor of internal medicine\n\nMore award winners\n\nMany more awards were presented at A Grand Affair. Yegor Pashchenko, M.D., a resident in the Department of Surgery at KU School of Medicine-Wichita, was given the Excellence in Residency Award. “His care for medical students was apparent not only in his personal interactions with us, but in his dedication to teaching,” his nominator wrote. “I've lost track of the amount of times I've seen Yegor sitting down with us students for a few hours to go over oral board cases and to answer all of our questions.”\n\nThe Ad Astra Award is given to the physician who donates time to the education of KU medical students and exemplifies excellence and professionalism. The 2023 winner is David Grantham, M.D., clinical assistant professor in the Department of Surgery at KU School of Medicine-Wichita.\n\nLocke Uppendahl, M.D., clinical assistant professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at KU School of Medicine-Wichita accepted the Sunflower Mentoring Award. This honor allows students to recognize an outstanding part-time physician educator."
