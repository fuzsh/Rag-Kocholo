        "text": "Photography is my art, and one branch of that art is working with the male physique. The shapes, contours, tones, and textures. A sculptural element. How light plays across a muscle, or reflects in the hair. A glint in the eye. A playful moment. How the figure relates to, or contrasts with, the surroundings. The mimicking of shapes. The strength of man mirrored in the environment - the relationships that are captured. A moment in time. A sexy moment in time... I've been lucky... my work has captured some attention recently. There have been a couple of exhibits, inclusion is several anthology photography books, and even a few Magazine covers. Don't get me wrong - I love that attention, but it's not why I create. I create for me, and for the models. I create to push myself - to think about things differently, to see things in a new light. And now I am creating for you - I hope you enjoy this look into my world! -Mark"
