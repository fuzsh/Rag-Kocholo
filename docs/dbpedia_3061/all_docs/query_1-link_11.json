        "text": "About the Author\n\nChris Grantham is a born-and-bred Kiwi (of English and Swiss stock) currently based in Auckland. His speaking and writing and the occasional stand-up comedy get him out and about plenty. Chris is the author of The Kiwi Bible and The Kiwi Bible: Some of the Early Stuff (both published by Penguin). He has worked for several international Christian development agencies, and in previous lives was an accountant and a school teacher. He and Jocelyn have two grown-up kids, one of whom is the Chocolate Seller on Broadway."
