        "text": "“Wild Tales,” Graham Nash’s 2013 memoir, concludes with him swaddled in domestic comfort in Hawaii, long married, with three children and a newborn grandchild. The island sun seemed to be setting on a life in music that began with the Hollies and the British Invasion and continued through Laurel Canyon, Joni Mitchell, C.S.N.Y., and six solo records.\n\nThe opening lines of Nash’s new album, “Now,” suggest that he has another wild tale to tell:\n\nI used to think that I would never love again\n\nI used to think I’d be all on my own\n\nI really thought that it was coming to an end\n\nAnd just the thought of it chilled me to the bone\n\nBut not now.\n\nTo his children’s dismay, Nash, who is eighty-one, left their mother for a woman half his age, a New York-based artist named Amy Grantham, whom he met nine years ago and married in 2019. They live together in a two-bedroom apartment on Second Avenue overlooking St. Mark’s Church.\n\n“I’ve always walked into my life,” Nash explained recently, over a late breakfast at Veselka, the East Village Ukrainian joint. “I planned very little of it.” For example, he recalled the day in 1968 when he met Stephen Stills and David Crosby, in Joni Mitchell’s Laurel Canyon house, the place with “two cats in the yard” that inspired Nash’s C.S.N.Y. song “Our House.”\n\n“I wanted to spend some time with Joan”—Joni, with whom he was in love. “But when I pulled into the parking lot I heard voices.” Crosby had recently been fired from the Byrds, and Stills’s band, Buffalo Springfield, had broken up; the two men were working on material as a duo. They sang Nash a new tune, “You Don’t Have to Cry,” and after listening to it twice he added his voice to theirs. “Forty-five seconds in, we had to stop.” The vocal blend stunned them. “It was ridiculous,” Nash said. “Once I heard that, I knew what I had to do.” He quit the Hollies, left his native England, and moved to California.\n\nThe same thing happened when Nash met Grantham (who bears a resemblance to a young Mitchell), at a C.S.N. show at the Beacon Theatre. “I said, ‘Holy shit. There’s that feeling again.’ ” He walked into a new life. With the new album, he said, “I wanted to wear my heart on my sleeve. I wanted people to know that it doesn’t matter how fucking old you are. If you’ve got the passion, you can still do it.”\n\nNash was shaken by Crosby’s death, in January: “Like an earthquake, with aftershocks whenever I see his face on Instagram.” He added, “He was my best friend.” Nash’s unsparing account of Crosby’s addiction in “Wild Tales” ruptured their friendship; they hadn’t spoken in a decade. Shortly before Crosby died, “he left a voice mail saying, ‘I really need to talk,’ ” Nash said. “So I set a time, and I waited and waited. He never called. And then he was gone.”\n\nHe has remained close to Mitchell. “You can’t be in love with Joni Mitchell and then lose it,” he said. “All these years, every birthday I send her a dozen roses—usually eleven white ones and one red one, or eleven red ones and one white one. I don’t know why.”\n\nNash likes to read depressing books: drug-resistant strains of bacteria, the next pandemic, social decay. “My wife calls my side of the bed the ‘bummer pile.’ ” His work has always been political, and one of his new songs references “when the MAGA tourists took the Hill.” “I kind of feel like the American empire is crumbling,” he said.\n\nNevertheless, Nash is upbeat. He’s had COVID twice, but his high tenor is intact. And even though he stood between Stills and Neil Young “playing full fucking blast for forty years,” he can still hear, with the help of hearing aids. He has four tours planned this year.\n\nAfter breakfast, he strolled east. “Whitman, Poe—they walked these streets,” he said. “And Tesla. He thought that every single thing has a vibration. Tesla had this pure-white pigeon, who would fly into his window. In his biography, he says that one day this incredible blue flash came out of its eyes, and that’s how he knew he was done.”\n\nAs Nash walked, he snapped pictures with his iPhone. He passed a silver birch on East Third: “They could have knocked it down. But look at it.” Snap. A young man balanced on one leg atop a concrete barrier—snap—on which someone had scrawled “Love Is the Law.” “Graham Bond wrote that song,” Nash said. In Tompkins Square Park, someone was screaming, “Man is an artist! Feed the artist!”\n\n“Crazy people, brilliant people, all of them right here,” Nash observed. A flock of pigeons blocked his path. He walked right into it. “I’m waiting for that blue flash,” he said. ♦"
