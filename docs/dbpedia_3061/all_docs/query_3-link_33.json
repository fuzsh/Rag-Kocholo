We also advise on auctions and undertake commission bids, and assist with collection development and management. Established by Mark James FLS and Anke Timmermann PhD (Cantab.), FLS, Type & Forme is more than just a bookshop: we also research, present and publish on rare books and their history.\n\nType & Forme is located in Grantham, the Lincolnshire town in which the young Isaac Newton was first educated, and the home to famous historic libraries, from the 16th-century chained Trigge Library at St Wulframs (originally just 240 titles) to the library of Belton House (ca 11,000 volumes). Our book room and office at the Grantham Museum, in the historic heart of Grantham, may be visited on appointment, and we also exhibit at national and international book fairs."
