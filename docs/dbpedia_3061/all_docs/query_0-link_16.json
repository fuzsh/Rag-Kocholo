        "text": "Introduction\n\ni) The Problem\n\nThe outbreak of bubonic plague that struck London and Westminster in 1636 provoked the usual frenzied response to epidemics. The national government republished the books of orders for controlling outbreaks and wrote to aldermen and justices of the peace, urging them to stay at their posts. Parishes assembled physicians, nurses, and surgeons to care for the sick and hired searchers and bearers to find and transport the dead and dying. Thousands fled the city; thousands more were quarantined in their homes or isolated in pesthouses. Though by the end of 1637 the outbreak in London and Westminster proved to be a milder one than those of 1625 or 1603 had been, it still carried off 10,400 individuals—7.5% of the city and its liberties' estimated total population.1 In addition to nearly decimating the region, plague created physical, psychological, and economic suffering for thousands more. In the opinion of various contemporaries, some of the mortality and much of the suffering could be attributed to the controversial policy of household quarantine.\n\nIn 1636, quarantine was still a relatively new policy to England. Italian urban authorities first began to use quarantine as a response to bubonic plague around 1348.2 However, long before then, they had implemented isolation policies for leprosy and other diseases. Quarantine, a word derived from quarantenaria, a forty-day period, was first mentioned with regard to disease in 1127 in Venice. Following the Black Death, many governments applied a similar set of mandates to plague.3 In England, however, it took the royal government until the late sixteenth century to include quarantine and isolation in its books of orders related to plague control. Though, once it was adopted, it was adopted rigorously. Parishes in afflicted cities were required to use both household quarantine and publicly operated pesthouses to isolate both infected individuals and those members of their household who had been exposed to people suffering from plague.4\n\nThroughout outbreaks, the government asserted that plague control measures were acts of public health for the benefit of all. However, contrary to this government narrative of disease prevention there was a popular narrative that portrayed quarantine and isolation as personal punishment rather than prudent policy. Printed government orders called for the equal implementation of plague policy for all individuals, but handbills and other mass-produced writings contradict this egalitarian vision. The central question is why was there such a disconnect between government and popular rhetoric? In examining the 1636 outbreak on the parish as well as the individual level, reasons for this inconsistency between official and unofficial perspectives emerge. Quarantine and its effects were not classless, and its implementation was not always strictly in the name of public health.\n\nii) The Evidence\n\nHistorians of the early modern period have long recognized quarantine as an important aspect of plague policy, and many have written about it and the controversy surrounding its implementation. This work has often been from the standpoint of the national government. What is lacking in historical writings is a close analysis of how quarantine worked in practice. Only by attempting a detailed analysis of the measures taken can we assess its impact and better understand how it was perceived. Traditionally, a major stumbling block to this end has been the lack of sufficiently detailed records. Many of the plague-related records that historians have worked with refer to burials. While the mortality rate certainly reflects one aspect of plague's impact, it neglects the larger number of people who were affected by epidemic conditions but did not die.\n\nBecause of its scale, progression, and surviving records, the 1636 plague outbreak provides a particularly appropriate case study for examining the government system of plague control and regulation in early modern England, and especially the parish's use of quarantine and isolation. Like all outbreaks, it was pervasive and deadly, although not as disastrous as earlier ones, such as 1625, or later ones, like 1665.5 This allowed parishes to implement policies of quarantine and isolation that were difficult to enforce during more catastrophic epidemics.6 Furthermore, the 1636 outbreak followed a relatively common outbreak pattern, with major ports and London recording some of the earliest cases. From that point, the disease spread throughout the parishes and later moved into smaller country villages.7 The government quickly issued a series of proclamations and reprinted the book of orders for plague. This similarity to other outbreaks makes 1636 a good choice for investigating the effects of plague policy on individuals because it is typical of the period.\n\nThere are a number of detailed records surviving from 1636 that help reconstruct both the institutional and the social history of the outbreak. These include books of orders reissued by the government during the outbreak, detailed records from the Privy Council, court cases from the Westminster Sessions in 1636–1639, and account books outlining parish expenditures. The historical value of financial records varies by parish. Some parishes preserved only minimal records and listed merely the sum of additional expenses. Other parishes, like St. Martin in the Fields, kept detailed records documenting every expenditure related to the epidemic. The St. Martin records are particularly rich because they captured expense data at the quarantined household level, indicating the location, number of residents quarantined, number of surviving individuals from each household, and additional outlays for nurses, watchmen, bearers, and searchers. This provides an exceptionally detailed reconstruction of the social and economic experience of quarantine in this large and populous parish.8\n\nPlague and its Perception\n\nBubonic plague was a prominent feature of sixteenth and early seventeenth century England, particularly in cities like London and Westminster. Outbreaks occurred once every ten to fifteen years.9 At the time, physicians did not understand the disease's etiology and attributed it to a broad range of causes. As William Kemp explained in a 1665 treatise, “The cause of the pestilence is either supernatural, or natural.”10 Though he elaborated upon both categories, Kemp never reached a conclusion as to the origin of plague. Present day science points to Yersinia pestis, a bacterium, as the causative agent of plague. Infected fleas transmit the disease to black rats, an intermediary for the illness. Healthy fleas then feed on the blood of infected rats, internalizing the bacteria, which forms a digestion-blocking bio-film in the flea's foregut. When the flea vector leaves the rat and attempts to feed on humans, it is unable to ingest its blood-meal, and vomits the blood along with saliva and bacteria-containing bio-film fragments back into the innoculum. The bio-film inhibits flea digestion, leading to starvation. To combat this, fleas attempt to feed more frequently, often biting a single victim multiple times. This ensures that a high bacterial load is transferred, causing infection.11\n\nModern cases of plague have approximately a 50% fatality rate if untreated, and given that medical practices at the time often worsened a patient's condition, the mortality rate may have been significantly higher.12 The first indication of plague was usually a painfully swollen lymph node called a bubo, which occurred near the fleabite. Infected individuals also suffered from fever, a characteristic spotty rash, and severe headache. The bubo turned a dark purple or black color, making the positive identification of clinically evident disease relatively easy in many cases.13\n\nVisitations of plague brought terror. In Thomas Dekker's description of the epidemic of 1603, plague was personified as “the tyrant not the conqueror, making havoc of all when he had all lying at the foot of his mercy.” No one was safe from the suffering of plague. Dekker continued, adding that, “Men, women and children dropped down before [plague]. Houses were rifled, streets ransacked, beautiful maidens thrown on their beds and ravished by sickness, rich men's coffers broken open and shared amongst prodigal heirs and unthrifty servants, poor men used poorly but not pitifully.”14 This indiscriminate calamity gave plague a distinct moral place in popular thought. Though the disease clustered to a certain extent in back alleys and took a great toll on the poor, contemporaries recognized the risk it posed to even the most noble, wealthy, or godly. In this sense, plague was “morally indifferent” and therefore particularly frightening.15\n\nHowever, the published accounts of plague may have exaggerated the extent of the dislocation it brought. While authors like Dekker and Daniel Defoe wrote about plague in the same terms as many of their continental counterparts, government records from 1636 suggest that plague was only one concern among many to England's rulers. Privy Council records yield frequent commentary on the outbreak, its progression, and attempts to contain it, but these items are interspersed with decisions regarding the ongoing business of national economic, social, and foreign policies ranging from regulating the soap-making industry to negotiations with France over trade.16 The testimony from “London Looke-back,” a poem written in 1625, that “uncouth Grasse; and Haruests … grew where once [was] … th' Market-place”17 was not the case in places like London and Westminster, where daily life had to continue. Even in 1625, it is unclear if the city experienced such post-apocalyptic conditions.\n\nQuarantine and Isolation in Early Modern England\n\nThe government-implemented system of quarantine and isolation in London and Westminster integrated two key features: the shutting up of houses and the pesthouse. Individual parishes did not always have enough pesthouses or room in them for additional victims, so quarantining houses occurred concomitantly. Scarcity of resources and lack of overarching organization made household quarantine the most common approach to controlling the epidemic.\n\nThe first major component of plague control was the shutting up of houses. When a parish-appointed searcher identified a house in which a person had died of plague, the local constable would padlock the door, closing all living inhabitants inside. He then marked the door with a red cross and the words “Lord have mercy upon us” to signify its status as an unhealthy space containing plague-exposed individuals. By law, watchmen were to remain outside the house at all hours. This served a dual purpose. A watchman could prevent sick or exposed individuals from leaving their house and spreading plague, and he could stop healthy individuals from entering the house and catching plague. From parish records, it appears that watchmen were less common than the law suggested.18\n\nTraditionally, quarantine lasted for 40 days, but this time was extended if a household resident died during confinement. Householders with two residences were permitted to move healthy family members and servants to be quarantined separately from the already ailing.19 Because fleas could be carried on clothing or bedding, this did not eliminate the likelihood of contracting plague.20 Nevertheless, under the humoral paradigm, doctors considered it beneficial to escape the poisonous environment of the first location. It may have distanced some individuals from residences infested with plague-carrying rats and thereby reduced infections. However, many individuals were not fortunate enough to have a second residence, so quarantine commingled the sick and the well. Critics claimed that this increased the death toll during outbreaks.21\n\nThe second key feature of plague control was the construction of parish pesthouses for isolating individuals. If searchers discovered an individual suffering from plague, bearers could take her to the pesthouse instead of quarantining her inside her house. Members of her household might also accompany her to the pesthouse, or they might remain quarantined in the house where they had been residing. The decision whether or not to send an entire family to the pesthouse does not appear to have followed any strict guidelines.22 One explanation may be that if the other residents appeared to be healthy, overseers and physicians judged that the risk of moving them to an environment filled with invalids was greater than that of leaving them in an infectious house. Even if the entire population of a household died or moved to the pesthouse, the building was nevertheless quarantined. The only difference was that the constable marked its door with a red cross but did not add any further inscription. The parish appointed doorkeepers to watch uninhabited houses as well, to prevent anyone from entering or looting them.\n\nDocuments regarding the architectural specifications for pesthouses mandated the construction of two buildings: one for the sick and another for the healthy but exposed.23 They were to be built in the same style, with stone or brick walls, high ceilings, and large windows to facilitate airflow and allow miasmas to dissipate. Overall, the aim was “not so much gorgeousnesse as cómodiousnes.”24 In practice, it is unclear if parishes in London and Westminster adhered to such strict guidelines.\n\nParishes in London and Westminster had distinct pesthouses that served as hospitals for the sick. A master or a mistress oversaw them and employed nurses and watchmen. Locked gates sealed pesthouses to prevent escape. Perhaps because the pesthouses soon became overfilled or because of objections to the housing of sick and sound in close proximity, parishes like St. Martin built pestfields. These were fenced in and supervised areas with separate housing units for families or small groups. In St. Martin, these filled the open spaces of Soho and included repurposed tenements.25\n\nIt is hard to gain insight into the quality of life inside pesthouses and pestfields. Ideally, they were spaces similar to later tuberculosis sanatoria—places for the infirm to convalesce in an hygienic environment, where all their daily needs were met and they did not have to work.26 Theoretically, pesthouses would be “open unto the Sun, & high, & by a riuer side” and surrounded by natural spaces where the ailing could go to enjoy fresh air and exercise.27 However, the spatial realities of London and Westminster parishes make this seem unlikely.28 Regardless, certain aspects of life continued even in the pesthouse. One example of this was Barbara Spencer, a woman from Westminster who was pregnant when diagnosed with plague and sent to the pesthouse. At the pesthouse, she both recovered and, six weeks into her eight-week stay, delivered her baby, who was healthy enough to be released along with her, on November 26, 1636.29\n\nSt. Martin in the Fields and the Parish Experience\n\nThe parish of St. Martin in the Fields is located on the eastern edge of Westminster. Its demographics and record keeping in the early modern period make it a valuable case study for the parish experience of quarantine. In 1636, St. Martin was a fashionable district thanks to its proximity to the centers of government and the increasing popularity of London's West End. J. F. Merritt estimated that the population in 1625 was between 9,500 and 11,000 (larger than many English cities) and continued to grow throughout the seventeenth century.30 Though many residents were relatively wealthy, the parish's growth was mostly through the influx of poor immigrants. The percentage of householders receiving assistance from the parish was 14.9 in 1603 and rose to 19.3% by the 1660s.31 This was lower than in the neighboring parish of St. Margaret in the Fields, where by the 1660s, 47.6% of the population received assistance, but St. Martin received a similar level of aid to the relatively poor London parish of Southwark.32 It serves as a good location for understanding the social dynamics of urban quarantine because its population included distinct social classes.1\n\nThe plague outbreak that visited London in 1636 first came to the attention of the English government in October 1635. The Privy Council reported that France and the Low Countries were suffering from an outbreak and ordered customs officers to turn away or quarantine infected ships, fearing “dangerous consequences, if tymely care not [be] taken therin.”34 Despite such preventive methods, by February 1636, plague had spread to Yarmouth. The Privy Council wrote to the bailiff of Yarmouth about the proper treatment of French citizens temporarily detained there. These individuals were some of the first to violate quarantine during the 1636–1637 outbreak. The government allowed Baron de la Forte and other French nationals from Brill to stay in Yarmouth on the condition that they remained only in the housing provided for them until they proved free of any contagious disease. Nevertheless someone who remained anonymous gave the Baron and his company horses, allowing them to leave Yarmouth and make their way to London and Westminster to visit the court.35\n\nBy March 1636, plague had begun to break out in the suburbs of London, and on the April 10, 1636, the Privy Council reissued the books of orders for plague.36 The bill of mortality for April 28 to May 5, 1636, reported plague in four London parishes outside the city walls.37 Over the subsequent weeks, plague spread throughout the city and surrounding parishes, arriving in St. Martin at the end of June. In compliance with the books of orders, in June 1636, the parish officials quarantined two houses on Spur Alley, a side street running off the Strand, south of St. Martin's Lane. The next houses quarantined in St. Martin were on St. Martin's Lane and Long Acre, tracing a line north from the river and through the center of the parish.38\n\nIn July, the outbreak continued to spread north through Soho. By August, newly quarantined houses were scattered throughout the parish from St. James' Park in the west to Drury Lane in the east and from Long Acre in the north to Hartshorne Lane in the south.39 By the end of the month, twenty-two households including a total of 100 people were in quarantine and an additional thirteen households with a total of 81 people had already been reopened in the time since the outbreak emerged in the parish. Of those thirteen households reopened, five of them had lost one or more family members while under quarantine.40\n\nThe number of households quarantined per month in St. Martin continued to increase through November then began to decline until March 1637, when it started to go up once again.41 The summer of 1637 saw a second peak in quarantines that dropped sharply by August. The parish continued to provide aid to quarantined individuals through early 1638.42 Throughout the outbreak, quarantined houses were predominantly centered around Covent Garden and Soho and along St Martin's Lane and Long Acre.\n\nIn 1636, the government of St. Martin used pesthouses in tandem with household quarantine. Three different forms of quarantine arose as a result. Some individuals were sent directly to the pesthouse without being first isolated in their homes, others were isolated in their homes then eventually sent to the pesthouse, and a third group never went to the pesthouse.43 It is difficult to determine what factors led to which scenario. Individuals who lived alone tended to be sent directly to the pesthouse, but there was not a clear mandate requiring this measure. It is possible that these situations arose out of insufficient pesthouse space. In 1636–1637, the maximum number of individuals in the pesthouses of St. Martin was sixty six.44 If more space had been available, the parish might have followed the 1630 Privy Council recommendation for the use of pesthouses as a “better and more effectual course” of plague control.45\n\nAffected households tended to cluster spatially and temporally. This fact did not escape pamphleteers and other writers at the time. Thomas Dekker observed in his 1604 work, Nevves from Graues-end sent to nobody, “Whole housholds; and whole streets are stricken/The sick do die, the sound do sicken.”46 To illustrate this using some of the data from parish records, in September and October of 1636, thirteen houses in Round Court, a small area off the strand, were quarantined—a large number for the location.47 In the following fourteen months of the outbreak, there were only three more houses shut up in Round Court. This phenomenon has a few of explanations. It is possible that the rat population in Round Court became infected with plague around the same time in the late summer or that infected rats moved to Round Court in the fall, thereby infecting the residents all at once. Since some individuals survived quarantine, the sharp drop off in newly quarantined households and absence of re-quarantining in the records could have been the result either of the death of the infected rat population and failure by new infected rats to re-colonize the area or of the survivors' immunity. Plague has an incubation period of one to six days in humans and as low as five in fleas, creating the potential for the disease to spread rapidly but fade quickly in a small population.48\n\nThe Microeconomics of Plague\n\nSickness and death aside, plague's most tangible burden was economic. Though it is hard to quantify economic hardship, a number of surrogates can be used. These include analysis of the economic status of those affected, the need of quarantined individuals for parish subsidies, and assessment of the potential impacts of policy measures. Overall, those who paid most dearly during times of plague were the lower middling sort. While the poor faced significant difficulties, their aid status changed little, and quarantine and plague presented less of a threat to their livelihood or to the livelihood of the most affluent.\n\nIn Paul Slack's analysis of outbreaks in Bristol during the same time period, “plague picked out the narrowest alleys and poorest houses and hit them hard.”49 While this may have been true for some parishes, the records for St. Martin reflect a different trend.50 The majority of shut up houses were located on major streets such as the Strand and St. Martin's Lane. Only 99 of the 345 houses (29%) quarantined between June 1636 and December 1637 were located on alleys or in yards or courts. Because records of the total number of houses in St. Martin located on alleys, yards, and courts are not available, this number serves only for speculation rather than as a rigorous indication of a greater trend toward quarantine in theoretically disadvantaged areas. Furthermore, not all alleys, yards, and courts were inferior locations. However, it is a suggestive figure.\n\nIn order to try to quantify inferior living conditions, it is useful to approximate the quality of residence by establishing whether or not the street on which individuals lived was included in Boyle's book of London streets, London and Its Environs, when it was published in 1799.51 The assumption behind this is that locations that were sufficiently fashionable or wealthy would have a permanence not afforded to lower income housing. St. Martin was not burned during the Great Fire of London in 1666, so the majority of changes in street patterns were the result of deliberate demolition and redevelopment. Using street permanence as an indicator, still only 104 of the 345 quarantined houses (30%) were located on unlisted streets. It is possible that this 30% was a significant portion of the parish relative to the actual part of the population that resided off main streets, but as is the case with using alleys, yards, and courts as a measurement, no proper denominator exists to measure this in absolute terms. Presumably, wealthier individuals who fled Westminster during the outbreak lived on larger thoroughfares or more significant streets, lowering the number of occupied houses to be quarantined in such locations. Adjusting for vacancy would give greater weight to the 30% of houses not on main streets, but it is unclear to what extent this would change the significance of the figure.\n\nThe primary occurrence of quarantining on major streets suggests that those most impacted were the middling sort because they were affluent enough to afford housing on larger thoroughfares but not affluent enough to have left during the outbreak. Other historians have noted the lasting impact of plague outbreaks on populations of self-employed tradesmen.52 More successful shopkeepers, craftsmen, and traders would have located their businesses and residences on streets like St. Martin's Lane and the Strand and near Charing Cross.53 The sizable number of quarantined houses in such locations reinforces the notion that plague hit such individuals particularly hard.\n\nQuarantine records from St. Martin give a rough indication of the socioeconomic status of quarantined individuals. The records note whether households were “chargeable,” “partially chargeable,” or “not chargeable.” Chargeable households were those who were financially dependent on the parish for material support during the period of quarantine. Partially chargeable households paid for a portion of their keep, and not chargeable ones supported themselves. Over the course of the 1636–1637 outbreak, 84% of the individuals were chargeable, meaning they could not afford to pay the 4 pence per quarantined person per day that the parish charged for support. Though this was a relatively low cost, it was significant enough to encompass some of the lower middling sort who, though comfortable, lacked the resources to endure long periods of expenditure without income.54 It also included those who were chargeable at the time of the outbreak but who were required to later pay back some of the compensation they received. Such individuals who were given loans made up a small but not insignificant portion of the chargeable households on the parish roll.\n\nThe percentage of quarantined individuals who were fully chargeable remained relatively constant. The constancy of this value as a proportion of the total number quarantined is an important indicator because it shows that plague's disease profile with regard to socioeconomic status was consistent in St. Martin. This may be because daily patterns during an epidemic were fairly regular. There were no major parish policy shifts or drastic measures that either opened up a whole new class of people to greater risk or dramatically reduced the risk for another group. This was confirmed by the policy records from the Privy Council, which did not reveal any significant alterations of the traditional books of orders.55\n\nBetween 15% and 19% of the population of St. Martin was on poor relief, totaling around 1,700–2,000 persons. During the 1636 outbreak, 5,367 people were quarantined, of which 4,485 were chargeable, more than the total number of those regularly receiving poor relief. Therefore, at least 2,500 of those chargeable were otherwise financially independent from the parish. Because more people were fully chargeable than were on the poor rolls, it appears that plague made otherwise financially self-sufficient individuals depend on parish aid.\n\nThe government intended for plague regulations to help individuals cope with the economic hardship of quarantine, but infection's impact on households lasted beyond the duration of the outbreak. A Privy Council order from January 7, 1637, prohibited the owner of a previously shut up house from “tak[ing] into his house any person whatsoever to lodge” for the year following the quarantine. To insure that householders followed this rule, each parish's churchwardens had to compile a list of quarantined houses for the local Justice of the Peace.56 For households that lost renters or supporting members, this order made the recovery process more challenging because they could not recoup any lost rent or compensate for reduced productivity by taking in a lodger. There was no accompanying order to provide relief to households for which the anti-lodger order was a financial burden. Presumably, such individuals had to find other means of coping. This touches upon the irony of quarantine. The period of quarantine was theoretically supposed to attest to the health of a household, but in practice quarantine placed a stigma on the location, which remained even once the red cross was washed from the door.\n\nIn Westminster, each parish distributed poor relief independently. There was no central system of collections, as there was in the city of London, so problems had to be dealt with either locally or by the crown. Each parish collected taxes from its wealthier inhabitants and redistributed them to the poor. The poor, like those quarantined, were divided into those fully chargeable and those partially chargeable. During times of plague, the rolls swelled with the sick, widowed, and quarantined. Many people were unable to continue doing business or lost their other means of support, and the rules of order mandated that the parish “minister necessaries vnto [the quarantined] at their own charges (if they be able) or at the common charge if they be vnable.”57 To handle the increase in demand on the relief system, parishes drew from neighboring parishes and townships when requesting aid for the “poore visited,” floated bonds, and converted treasuries of gold and silver plate to cash in order to cover costs because collections and loans were insufficient.58\n\nFrom June 1636–April 1637, the collections, donations, and parish bonds for supporting the ‘poor visited’ of St. Martin totaled 1,039 pounds, 7 shillings, and 2 pence. Of this, 390 pounds was in bonds that later had to be repaid.59 The parish church did not absorb all this institutional debt. Some chargeable homeowners, presumably the better off of those chargeable, were lent money during their time in quarantine. An example of this was Issac Mills of Spurr Alley, who appeared in the rolls as chargeable but was lent ten shillings during the four weeks for which his family was quarantined. The total amount the parish paid for his household of three while they were shut up during November was identical to the amount the parish paid for another household of three that was shut up for the same four weeks. The only difference was in the records, which listed Mills as having received the ten shilling loan during that time.60 The parish's equivalent expenditure on both households shows that the loan was not an amount above and beyond the typical level of compensation. Giving relief in the form of loans may have been a way in which the parish passed the costs of quarantine on to those quarantined, even when they were unable to pay at the time.\n\nImplementation of Plague Regulations\n\nThanks to bills of mortality and other indicators, the officials of St. Martin were aware of the presence of plague in London before any cases were found in the parish. However, extant regulations aside, they were not entirely ready for the outbreak. A bearer from the neighboring parish of St. Giles in the Fields carried the bodies of the first plague victims in St. Martin to the graveyard because the parish had not yet hired any of its own bearers.61 The parish soon recruited its own bearers and other outbreak workers. Expenditure records show no pre-existing pesthouses or anticipatory construction. On June 19, 1636, after the outbreak had reached St. Martin, the parish commissioned the construction of twenty-two pesthouses. During July, the parish ordered the construction of twenty-four more pesthouses, some of which were large buildings, others of which were smaller free-standing houses in the open areas designated as pestfields. Construction at some sites first required the demolition of abandoned or decrepit buildings on the property, retarding resource mobilization. Basic infrastructure also was slow to come. Rinhard Colly dug a well for the main pesthouse on July 24, 1636, six weeks after plague appeared in the parish and four months after it appeared in London.62\n\nThe lagging pace of plague response may have stemmed from a reluctance to scale-up before an epidemic proved itself to be of sufficient degree to merit major financial investment. Plague often existed at low levels even on non-outbreak years, so officials may have hesitated to spend money preparing for a disaster that might not come to pass.63 Furthermore, a different understanding of the transmission of plague may have led some parish officials to believe they could escape infection through other forms of spiritual readiness.\n\nOnce the parish began plague preparations, they went smoothly. The parish recruited nurses, doorkeepers, bearers, and searchers within the first week. By the end of July 1636, the parish employed three nurses, ten doorkeepers, three bearers, and two searchers.64 The numbers of bearers and searchers varied little, even as the number of quarantined households changed. The number of doorkeepers was more strongly correlated with the number of locations of quarantined households than they were with the absolute number of quarantined households. To clarify, the three houses quarantined in Bennett's Alley during August 1636 count as one location but three separate households. As seen in figure 2, there appears to be a linear association between the number of locations and the number of doorkeepers. The number of doorkeepers was closely correlated with (correlation coefficient = 0.895) and closer to the number of locations (average of 1.8 locations per doorkeeper) than for the number of households (correlation coefficient = 0.834 and average of 2.9 households per doorkeeper). This suggests that the parish assigned doorkeepers to watch more than one house. Such a scheme would have been particularly effective if the parish designated doorkeepers for regions, such as a street or a court. These measures would have financially benefited the parish by reducing labor costs while still meeting the requirements in the books of orders.\n\nIn looking at figure 3, a profile of the 1636 outbreak in St. Martin as a whole, a number of trends emerge.65 First, there was a temporal trend. New quarantines peaked in October and November 1636, and then there was a small increase in April 1637. This pattern of a primary wave of infections followed by a smaller one during the following year was common among plague outbreaks, but the peak in autumn 1636 was a little late. Plague usually flourished during warmer months because of the population dynamics of its hosts—rats and fleas. However, 1636 was unusually hot and dry. In his diary, John Evelyn wrote that, “This Yeare 1636, being extreamely dry, the Pestilence much increased in London and divers parts of England.”66 Evelyn lived a few miles south of London. Even in Newcastle, which is 200 miles north and has a far cooler climate, the plague only subsided in October and November.\n\nSecond, though the number of households quarantined followed a similar pattern to the number of people quarantined, the average number of persons per quarantined household declined steadily after August 1636, as the outbreak increased in size. From the beginning of the outbreak until the end of August 1636, average quarantined household size was 5.9 people. The average number of individuals per quarantined household for houses quarantined between September 1636 and August 1637, when the parish records end, was 3.8 people. This may be interpreted in a few ways. It may suggest a gradual trend towards infection at specific social levels, as indicated by deviation from the mean number of persons per household, which in 1695 was 5.1 for individuals living outside the city walls of London.67 Given that the wealthiest would flee but might leave servants behind to tend to the house, it is possible that the low average is the result of quarantining more under-occupied residences.68 This would have had a two-fold effect because mean household size values were often inflated through the inclusion of wealthy households' large servant and apprentice filled dwellings. The decline also may be because of continued migration away from the parish during an outbreak. As the outbreak worsened, householders who initially stayed may have changed their minds. Another possibility is that the decline was because of the parish's preferential use of pesthouses for treatment, rather than keeping individuals in their homes. Not all household members would necessarily be sent to the pest house. In the case of Richard Bould, only two of the eleven inhabitants of his house were sent to the pesthouse. The rest were quarantined in their home.69 With pesthouse space at a premium, only the sickest or most immediately exposed might have been sent away.\n\nPlague and the Popular Experience\n\nWhile the numerical data paint an image of the parish experience of quarantine, the social experience appears primarily in court records, as few other documents survive about quarantined individuals.70 People charged in the Westminster Sessions for violating plague regulations in 1636 tended to fall into one of two categories: those who neglected their official duty or those who refused to follow orders. The former category included Thomas Parker, a constable who was sent to the Gatehouse prison for neglect after he opened an infected house before the full period of quarantine had finished, and the more serious case of Friswide Williams and Edith Flastoe, two searchers who were bribed to lie about the cause of death of a servant.71\n\nParker's case was rather cut and dried. The court may have convicted him as an example to others who might be swayed by homeowners to open apparently healthy but still quarantined houses before the complete term of isolation was finished. The Williams/Flastoe case is similar in that it concerned a type of situation that may have been commonplace during plaguetime. The case also highlights one manner in which plague regulations may have been unjustly applied to persons of different socioeconomic levels. Williams and Flastoe were searchers for the parish of St. Martin when they were sent to examine the body of a servant at the house of “the Prince His Highness' shoemaker” in Covent Garden. When they arrived, they declared the cause of death to be pestilence and quickly placed the corpse in a coffin and nailed it shut. However, before they could leave, a servant came to them with ten shillings from his master for each of them and suggested they tell the shoemaker, who had allegedly authorized the bribe, whether or not the man had died of plague. The searchers went on to tell the shoemaker that the man had died “only ‘of a surfeit.’” Upon hearing this, the household decided they were safe and waited until the following day to bury the coffin.72 This went against the ideal of an honest and impartial squad of public health officials who would judge which deaths were caused by plague based on personal expertise rather than convenience.\n\nThough the presence of a court record signals that someone eventually identified the servant as having died of plague, presumably leading the parish to shut up the shoemaker's house. This record may be typical of plague-related offenses facilitated by wealth and class. A wealthy household could afford to bribe searchers and watchmen as well as presumably hide infected persons without attracting public attention. Early in the 1636–1637 outbreak, the government recognized households' concealment of infected servants as a challenge to plague regulations. In May 1636, the Privy Council wrote to the mayor and aldermen of London and Justices of Middlesex, Surrey, and Westminster to condemn the practice whereby people would “ordinarily remove their [infected] servants to their gardenhouses or other private place” in order to prevent their house from being shut up. The Council called this a public health risk and ordered that “when any p[er]sons shall bee found to bee sick or to dye of ye Plague in any such gardenhouse or other private place, that ye said houses bee forthwith shutt up, and also ye houses from whence they were first removed.”73 This attempt to prevent corruption indicates that the government sought to apply plague orders as fairly and equally as possible. There is no further indication as to the efficacy of this order.\n\nThe wealthy had greater access to privacy both because they were not dependent upon lodgers or other families in order to pay for a home and because more expensive dwellings offered greater space for segregating the infirm. Had a servant died of plague, the likelihood that the parish would quarantine a building was far higher than if a servant was merely sick but recovered. Illness was more easily hidden, especially if no one called a doctor. In theory, individuals were obligated to alert the local health examiner or other parish official if anyone in their household was sick. The books of orders dictated that “the Master of euery house, assoone as any one in his house complaineth, either of Botch, or Purple, or Swelling … shall giue knowledge thereof to the Examiner of health within two houres after the said signe shall appeare.”74 This standard required both the family members to correctly identify the illness as plague and the householder to act in good faith and inform the examiner. Searchers visited each house after a reported death in order to ascertain its cause, making the successful bribing of the searchers the only opportunity for concealment in such cases.\n\nInstances in which the parish was not informed of infected households were not always unequivocally the fault of one party. Using the case of Thomas Osborne, a draper of St. Clement Danes, as an example, symptoms could be difficult to detect, and self-interest encouraged ignorance. On January 21, 1637, Osborne met with the Master of the Pesthouse of London about his apprentice, who was infected with plague. Osborne sent his apprentice to the pesthouse and gave the Master of the Pesthouse 46 shillings to cover related expenses. The apprentice died eight days later, but Osborne claimed that he had been unaware that the apprentice was sick until the day before he sent him to the pesthouse. The case came to the attention of the justices at the Westminster Sessions because Osborne had continued doing business at his shop for a month after the time at which he sent his apprentice to the pesthouse, thereby avoiding quarantine for nearly four weeks. That violation aside, the accompanying certificate from William Upton, the Keeper of the Pesthouse of London, claimed that the bubo on the servant “was very small” and “if he had died at home [it] would hardly have been seen or felt.”75 Though Upton may have been bribed, and Osborne did not act in good faith by skirting quarantine and continuing to sell cloth after the death of his apprentice, the certificate suggested that not all violations were out of malice, and concealment could be plausibly explained away through medical excuses.\n\nThe inconvenience and suffering of a family under plague regulations, particularly quarantine, may have motivated the majority of the second kind of offender: those who refused to follow orders. Such offenders tended either to refuse to pay the additional tax for the relief of visited houses or to break quarantine. Both types of offenders were mostly of the middling sort. Coachmakers, grocers, fishmongers, tailors, and innholders were among those charged.76 There was a conspicuous absence of the poorest from the Sessions' rolls.\n\nThe high-profile case of Stephen Smyth, a fishmonger in St. Martin, demonstrated some motivations for breaking quarantine and how multiple members of a household could aid and abet in the crime. Three people were charged in the case. William Busby, a doorkeeper in St. Martin who was assigned to shut up Smyth's house and watch it, was charged with neglecting his duty and allowing Smith and two of his servants to come and go from the house. Smyth and William Fenn, one of his servants, were both charged with concealing Margaret Burton, a servant, when they knew she was sick with plague, selling fish while quarantined, and leaving a quarantined house.\n\nSmyth did not conceal Burton's illness by hiding her away from all others. On the contrary, Smyth's sister and husband visited on Friday, January 19, 1636, during the period when Burton was sick and saw Burton. Rather than continue to stay with Smyth in an infected household, they chose to find other lodging. On the 20th, Busby asserted that Burton was “so sick” and that “his master was persuaded it was the plague, yet nevertheless [Smyth] sold fish openly,” in clear violation of the rules of order.77 No one in the household took action until the night of the 22nd, after John Sherman, Smyth's brother-in-law, informed Smyth that Burton ought to be sent to the pesthouse. Even after taking action, Smyth did not inform the local authorities that one member of his household had been infected.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 24, Smyth's house was finally shut up. He left Fenn and two other servants to care for the residence and moved his family into a house on Long Acre. Busby, the doorkeeper, allowed the servants to leave the house periodically to walk in the fields and take in some fresh air. Whether or not this was standard policy is unclear, but its appearance in the testimony suggests it was a violation. Three weeks later, before being officially released from quarantine, Smyth sent one of his servants to the house on the Strand and had him remove the padlock from its door, so the family could return. They returned five days later, and Smyth began selling fish again. All three defendants were convicted of violating the rules of order and threatening the health of the community. The court considered the sale of Smyth's fish to be an additional hazard because it was thought to carry the seeds of infection. All fish that could be taken back was collected and locked in the infected house. The justices sentenced Smyth to a term at Moorgate Prison, though the Privy Council later reconsidered his sentence.78\n\nThe case of Stephen Smyth exemplified the desire of a tradesman of the middling sort to carry on his business. Quarantine took twice the usual toll on vendors of perishable goods. They lost income both from reduced sales and spoilage of their product. Given this increased liability, Smyth's evasions are understandable. In a time when plague was an untreatable illness, the businessman's desire for self-preservation overruled order and public health.\n\nMany of those violating quarantine attempted to do so clandestinely. However a number of cases exist of open and, at times, violent rebellion. Jeremy Wright and Kellaway Guidott, both gentlemen of St. Clement Danes were charged in July 1637 after Wright assaulted the constable and the constable's assistant when they went to shut up Wright and Guidott's houses.79 Though ineffective in the long run, this passionate outpouring of displeasure likely centered on the inconvenience and the fear of being locked away from society. As gentlemen, Wright and Guidott likely would have been financially solvent enough to tolerate a few weeks of quarantine. Yet, for men accustomed to a certain standard of social interaction, the isolation would have been a marked change. Fear of plague also may have occasioned the assault, but those of higher social class, as seen in the Smyth case, often had access to other quarters in which they could stay while waiting for their primary residence to be reopened and aired out.\n\nPopular Narratives of Quarantine\n\nPopular narratives, even when not rejecting quarantine directly, critiqued it as a punishment. The author of “London, Look-Backe” described the experience, saying,\n\n… The time\n\nThen held it an inexipavle Crime,\n\nTo visit a sick friend: Strange Stoure, wherein\n\nLoue was a fault, and Charitie a sin'\n\nWhen Bad did feare infection from the Good,\n\nAnd men did hate their cruell Neighbour-hood …\n\nA sicknesse comfortlesse; when we doe feare\n\nTo see those friends whom we doe loue most deare.80\n\nQuarantine was portrayed as uncharitable, cruel, and an inversion of traditional values. Government attempts to impose discipline were refashioned as undercutting the meaning of love, charity, and goodness because the words held not only an emotional but also a practical component. They had to be performed, and that involved direct contact with the object of one's goodwill. By criminalizing visiting the sick and other demonstrations of goodwill towards the infirm, plague policy disrupted conventional patterns of kinship and neighborliness. According to the books of orders, government-hired plague officials were the only individuals allowed to enter and exit infected houses, and they were required to distinguish themselves in the streets so that others could avoid them.81\n\nIn some communities, fear of contagion and government mandates were sufficient to prevent casual visitors to quarantined homes. However, certain immigrant communities did not comply with regulations. On June 7, 1636, after a number of cases of French and Dutch congregations “sending their consolators to houses where the persons are visited, and after go[ing] into the company of others,” the Privy Council strengthened the order that no visitors be allowed into quarantined households.82 If the consolators refused to stop visiting infected houses, they were to be shut up along with other person exposed to plague. This threat was an attempt to force individuals into a pattern of behavior contrary to the prevailing custom of Dutch and French churches.\n\nThe forceful application of quarantine also led to a public perception of it as punishment. The primary agents responsible for shutting up houses were local constables and their assistants. When they failed to secure a house or convince a family to go to the pesthouse, they called upon additional help. In early 1637, John Clarke, a shoemaker living on St. Martin's Lane, refused to leave his home and move into a house in the pestfields nearby. The Justice of the Peace and other officers of St. Martin were ordered to send the bearers and other plague-time workers to open Clarke's house and tell him and his family to leave. If they refused, the bearers were expected to force them out. 83 This violent approach to enforcement added to the negative public perception of quarantine and the suggestion that it was punishment rather than aid.\n\nGeorge Wither's “History of the Pestilence,” a poetic account of the 1625 outbreak, which he wrote shortly after the epidemic, underscored the militaristic nature of plague regulations and the apparent unfairness of quarantine. He described the rules of order and their implementation, saying,\n\n… what was gravely Councelled …\n\n… might carry\n\nSome likenes to proceedings military\n\nA band of Halberts mustred were, to guard\n\nThe People from the Plague in eury Ward.\n\nAnd if they found by making inquisition\n\n(Or had but any probable suspition)\n\nWhere lodgd it had (althought but for a night)\n\nThat man was banisht from the publick sight,\n\nImprisned in his house both night and day,\n\nAs one that meant the Citie to betray.\n\nAnd (to compel that his vnwelcome guest\n\nShould keep wthin) his dore was Crost & blest\n\nAnd for that purpose, at the same did stand\n\nAn armed watchman, strengthned by comaund.84\n\nStigma transformed previously accepted individuals into enemies of the state, unwelcome even in their own neighborhoods. Their houses became prisons, and their every move was suspect. Plague policy made the sick into a dangerous other. Even those who were well were still under “inquisition” and treated as though they too might at any moment fall ill, metaphorically turning their backs on attempts to stop the spread of infection.\n\nWither's frustration at the punitive nature of quarantine was further developed in a later argument where he attributed the ebb and flow of disease to “Gods hand.”85 That is, if plague was an act of God, then government intervention was useless, if not outright harmful because it attempted to take plague control out of the hands of God. The policy of quarantine was, as also noted in “London, Looke-Back,” uncharitable, and therefore unchristian, another offense against God. Wither issued a final critique against plague regulations. For,\n\nIn humane Pollecy, wee sawe no hope,\n\nBut as the Stones, and Timber wch doe stop\n\nA Breach at ffirst; when all is drowned ore,\n\nDoe nothing els but make the waters rore.\n\nSo when our Sickness, and our Pouertie\n\nHad greater wants then wee could well supply;\n\nStrict Orders did but more enrage our greife,\n\nAnd hinder in accomplishing releife.86\n\nHuman intervention could do nothing, according to Wither, except worsen grief and suffering. The flood of plague was stronger than the weak dam formed by the books of orders, and strict regulations only prevented individuals from providing spiritual solace to the sick—the one thing they could offer under Wither's paradigm of divine orchestration.\n\nThe inevitability of plague's toll in “History of the Pestilence” stands in contrast to the concept of public health promoted through the books of orders. Though medical literature at the time was unsure of plague's etiology, government regulations confidently suggested actions for parishes to take in the prevention of disease. The Privy Council repeatedly urged local magistrates to continue upholding quarantine, creating a public face of control and orderliness that reached from naming of the regulations, “necessary directions,” to the methodical level of detail on subjects like taxation and compensation.\n\nPublic Health or Punishment?\n\nGiven the strength of the government narrative that quarantine was a policy of public health for the parish to apply “without favor or partiality,” the question becomes, how did the public narrative that quarantine was punishment arise?87 Quarantine was never described in the published books of orders as a means of punishment. Rather, it showcased government visions of a disciplined public in times of “collective calamity.”88 Quarantine was promoted as a measure for the preservation of the city as a whole, and those breaking quarantine were punished because they were threats to public welfare.\n\nThe explanation is threefold. First, plague disproportionately affected people of middling or lower socioeconomic status, who lacked the financial resources to flee. This created an imbalanced subset of the population that was subjected to quarantine. Second, quarantine was designed in a manner that caused the least amount of hardship for the poorest and the richest, but the middling sort often suffered financially because of the policy, leading to a sense of inequity and penalization. Lastly, the government engaged in double-speak; it claimed to only use quarantine as a method of isolating the sick and exposed, but in practice it also employed quarantine as punishment for breaking other regulations. The first two points were ways in which quarantine combined with social inequality gave the appearance of punishment. The third point is more notable because it was an intentional use of quarantine as punishment, lending credence to public opinion.\n\nFlight was a common plague measure for those who could afford it. The popular recommendations were simple: “flie far … flie speedily …[and] returne slowly.”89 Each suggestion increased the necessary financial outlay. Distance and speed were contingent on reliable and strong means of transport, and the longer an individual or family was away, the greater their personal savings had to be to support them. The monetary barrier was significant for the lower middling sort and the poor, who often lacked transportation options, places they could stay, and the money to finance a journey. As a result, they tended to stay in the city and wait out the epidemic, hoping they would be spared.\n\nPlague then spread throughout, leading to a skewed population sample. As the government responded by quarantining houses, the apparent pattern was one of discrimination. In neighborhoods that would normally have sizable populations of wealthier individuals, only the poorer were left. Narratives of plague that centered on its tendency to impact the indigent and marginalized likely drew from this phenomenon.\n\nThe financial bias of plague policy against the middling sort was a second unintentional way in which quarantine became punishment. Wealthy individuals who remained in the city and were subject to quarantine often had enough money to tolerate an extended period of expenditure with decreased income. The poorest were fully chargeable and parish support may have constituted an improvement in income and lifestyle—daily food and drink without obligation to seek work may have been a relief. The absence of court cases about quarantine involving the poorest suggests that there was little incentive for them to carry on daily life. They did not have to maintain self-run businesses, they did not have social reputations to uphold through regular visits, and they were unlikely to own a house, so the provisions forbidding lodgers were of less concern.\n\nFor the middling sort, the situation was very different. Whether chargeable or only partially chargeable, quarantine was a financial punishment. Regional blacklisting of quarantined merchants, prohibitions on renting, loss of perishable goods, and decreased business all contributed to the economic hardship. Plague regulations included a tax increase to finance quarantine and make it less damaging to those unable to support themselves on savings alone throughout the four to six week period of sequestration. However, the government did nothing else to soften the blow in other ways.\n\nFor partially chargeable individuals, quarantine was damaging for similar reasons. However, unlike households that were fully chargeable, those partially chargeable did not receive as much parish aid. It is unclear whether the income gap between fully chargeable and partially chargeable households was large enough to create a significant difference in financial outcome.\n\nIn contrast to ways in which quarantine appeared unjust through unintentional circumstance or shortsighted policy, the government also used quarantine as a punishment in addition to a tool of public health. The Privy Council specified in its internal records, but not in published books of orders, that individuals were to follow the rules of order and that “whosoeuer shall doe the contrary shall be shutt up in the same house as in an infected house for soe long a time as …[the] Justices of Peace shall [think] meete.”90 This applied to householders who so much as entered a house that was not yet fully aired out after quarantining. The manner in which the order specifies that those breaking the printed orders should be shut up “as in an infected house” acknowledges that such individuals were not contagious. Their punishment was meant to fit the crime. For risking infection, the healthy had to live under the same conditions as the sick.\n\nThe same logic extended to individuals who chose to “sitt at the doores” of quarantined houses.91 Such individuals were not just shut up in their own houses but were seen as having crossed the line that separated infected homes from safe surroundings. The Privy Council commanded that such persons “be shutt vpp wth ye rest of ye infected p[er]sons.”92 This was a step further than other orders that suggested individuals be locked up as if they were infectious. Quarantining a healthy individual amidst those infected because the healthy person had stayed too long in close proximity to an infected house directly endangered those who otherwise were at low risk for contracting plague. In this case, quarantine was a punishment that not only made the offender understand the inconvenience suffered by invalids but also threatened his physical health.\n\nThe use of quarantine as a punishment was not limited to directly health-related violations. The parish ordered lodgers within six miles of the Castle of Windsor to leave before it “shut them up in theire houses as … infected & dangerous.”93 The mere status as a person unable to afford a home or away from home put individuals in a marginalized class. The government characterized travelers as disease vectors and commonly instituted policies preventing individuals from visiting the court or traveling to various royal residences. Printed versions of these policies did not specify a particular punishment for those who broke them. The internal records demonstrated that quarantine was used as a method of punishment for non-compliance.\n\nBy standing contrary to the traditional government mantra of quarantine as public health, shutting up houses for punitive reasons may have contributed to the negative public perception of the practice. Government uses of quarantine under circumstances of dubious exposure and for suspect classes were not egalitarian. They incorporated moral judgments about the poor and the unsettled into public policy. The policies blamed non-compliant individuals for transmission. This transformed plague from a morally ambivalent disease to a disease of ignorance and apathy. Those who were expected to know better (e.g., watchmen and searchers), and failed in their duties were punished severely. As such, the government suggested they should be imprisoned in Newgate Prison “as an Example to others.”94 The underlying assumption was that officials would understand why what they had done put the public at risk. Their punishment was meant to make them suffer. Ordinary citizens were punished as though they lacked such a sophisticated view. Sentencing a person to quarantine was a means of instilling a fear of the consequences for ordinary people of violating plague regulations, namely, having to be shut up with the sick and dying, unable to carry on one's business or daily life.\n\nConclusion\n\nGovernment implementation of quarantine was remarkably effective. Despite a lack of early preparations, economic stress, and public opposition, parishes managed thousands of infected and exposed individuals in a system that, for many, helped ensure compliance. Pesthouses gave parishes a secure place to put individuals for the full duration of quarantine and insured that they would receive care. The coordination of parish officials provided daily support to the needy. To save money, the parish devised strategies to minimize expenses and to bring in some returns. Policies like having watchmen assigned to areas rather than individual houses had little public opposition. Others, like giving aid in the form of loans, may have been less popular.\n\nHowever, quarantine could never be uncontroversial. The flight of the wealthiest from London and Westminster left only the more socially vulnerable to be quarantined. Plague policy was financially sensitive to the poorest but costly in the short and long term to the middling sort. Most significantly, government implementation of quarantine was not always as fair and equal as official public documents purported it to be.\n\nThe government used quarantine directly as a punishment to control individuals found breaking other parts of the books of orders. Though this was not publicized, popular narratives continually included grievances about the cruelty and inequity of quarantine and the militaristic nature of its implementation. Quarantine was depicted as uncharitable and unchristian because it prevented family and friends from supporting the ill by conventional means. In response to the perceived inequity of quarantine, individuals, most often the middling sort, broke out of their houses, hid the sick, bribed parish officials, and violated the books of orders in other ways.\n\nSimilar public arguments against quarantine continued to arise throughout the rest of the seventeenth century. During 1665, the last great outbreak of plague in London, individuals printed dozens of pamphlets and published numerous books meticulously detailing the points against shutting up the infirm and exposed. In the end, opposition to plague policy died out only when plague itself did.\n\nAuthor notes\n\n© The Author 2012. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.
