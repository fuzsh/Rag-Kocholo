        "text": "View Upcoming PerformancesRegister Your Performance\n\nDeeply moved by the murder of a young gay man, acclaimed conductor Craig Hella Johnson composed an evocative and compassionate musical response that leaves audiences hopeful and joyous. Austin’s own GRAMMY® award-winning Conspirare premiered the piece in 2016. It has now been performed by hundreds of choirs across the world, spreading the music’s message of compassion and understanding. Collaborating with the Matthew Shepard Foundation, Conspirare continues to offer artistic and technical assistance to choirs to continue to spread the work’s anti-hate message which is more relevant than ever.\n\nConspirare is bringing back Considering Matthew Shepard in a newly staged performance.\n\nBass Concert Hall (Austin, TX) October 3, 2024\n\nTickets on Sale Now!\n\nMann Center (Philadelphia, PA) October 10, 2024\n\nTickets on Sale Now!\n\n“This oratorio is one of the most profound and moving shows ever created in Austin.”\n\n– Michael Barnes in the Austin American Statesman 24-25 Arts Season Preview\n\nIt takes All of Us.\n\nLearn how you can help bring Considering Matthew Shepard back to Austin!\n\nListen & watch to learn more about Considering Matthew Shepard\n\nListen to the complete recording of Conspirare performing Considering Matthew Shepard on Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube Music, or Pandora.\n\nWatch the KLUR/PBS special about Conspirare’s Considering Matthew Shepard.\n\nComposer Craig Hella Johnson explains the inspiration for Considering Matthew Shepard.\n\nCraig Hella Johnson describes what new listeners can expect from Considering Matthew Shepard.\n\nWatch highlights of the world premiere.\n\nPeek behind the scenes of the world premiere (part 1) and (part 2).\n\nWatch Conspirare perform “Cattle, Horses, Sky and Grass”\n\nWatch Conspirare perform “Ordinary Boy.”\n\nWatch “All of Us” sung by 477 singers in a virtual choir performance.\n\nAbout Considering Matthew Shepard\n\n‘This is about all of us.’ Matthew Shepard oratorio remains painfully relevant in 2024.\n\nThis three-part fusion oratorio speaks with a fresh and bold voice, incorporating a variety of musical styles seamlessly woven into a unified whole. Johnson sets a wide range of poetic and soulful texts by poets including Hildegard of Bingen, Lesléa Newman, Michael Dennis Browne, and Rumi. Passages from Matt’s personal journal, interviews and writings from his parents Judy and Dennis Shepard, newspaper reports, and additional texts by Johnson and Browne are poignantly appointed throughout the work.\n\nConspirare’s 2-CD recording of Considering Matthew Shepard debuted at #4 on Billboard’s Traditional Classical Chart in 2016. Audiences describe this work as “brilliant,” “powerful,” “innovative,” “dazzling,” and “gripping.” The Bay Area Reporter wrote “it has the richness, depth and complexity to compel repeated hearing, and the power to get you the first time out,” and from The Washington Post: “’Considering Matthew Shepard’ demonstrates music’s capacity to encompass, transform and transcend tragedy. Powerfully cathartic, it leads us from horror and grief to a higher understanding of the human condition, enabling us to endure.”\n\n“Matt Shepard and his story have led me on an inspiring, challenging and deeply meaningful journey that I continue to this day. In composing Considering Matthew Shepard I wanted to create, within a musical framework, a space for reflection, consideration and unity around his life and legacy.”\n\n– Craig Hella Johnson, composer\n\n2024 Concert Sponsors\n\nThank you to our 2024 Considering Matthew Shepard Concert Sponsors\n\nLead Producer: Lynne Dobson & Greg Wooldridge\n\nInspiration Catalysts: Fran & Larry Collmann, Lee Manford & Casey Blass, Anonymous\n\nAgent of Change: J.

Something timeless and precious. Something to be remembered the rest of our lives.” – Glenda Goehrs, audience member\n\n“Considering Matthew Shepard is by far the most intricate, beautiful and unyielding artistic response to this notorious anti-gay hate crime.” – Jason Marsden, Executive Director, Matthew Shepard Foundation\n\n“[A] powerful message of transformation and love. Brilliant!” – Vance Y. George, Director Emeritus, San Francisco Symphony Chorus\n\n“Considering Matthew Shepard is, for all its rich range of text and musical language, most simply an act of love.” – Shawn Kirchner, composer\n\n“A study in the human condition, our dark side and the light… powerfully important” – Christopher Cross, musician\n\n“Considering Matthew Shepard offers up a unique chance brew of compassion, sorrow and even joy at a level of sophistication one rarely experiences.” – Gregory Hinton, author, filmmaker\n\n“To say that I was moved would be an understatement…” – Peter Bay, Music Director and Conductor, Austin Symphony\n\n“Craig Hella Johnson’s simple eloquence in making a tragedy transcendent is felt in every moment of this piece.” – Evans Mirageas, Artistic Director, Cincinnati Opera\n\n“I was both deeply moved and very impressed… the emotional impact, the highest level of performance artistry, and [Craig Hella Johnson’s] mastery of every element of compositional craft.” – Donald Grantham, Composer, Professor, Butler School of Music, University of Texas at Austin\n\n“One of the most original and innovative American works of the past several decades” – Robert Kyr, composer\n\n“It’s right up there with playing ‘Sisters of Mercy’ with Leonard [Cohen] in the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam looking out at 3000 lighters waving… This is an important work that now has its wings.” Mitch Watkins, guitarist\n\n“In this stunning masterwork, Craig Hella Johnson has achieved not only an elegant tribute to Matthew Shepard, but he has succeeded – like Philomena in Greek mythology – in transmuting vast pain into profound beauty.” – Dorothy Walters, author\n\nAudience Comments\n\n“This performance stabbed me with the beauties of healing, love, and unified creation. This work lifts us to deal with imponderables and reminds us that human potentiality is the least understood and most squandered resource on earth. Too often we attach value to things man does, but not what man is. We have national anthems, but no anthems for humanity. Man’s achievements and power are heralded, but the preciousness of life is unsung. No longer… thanks to the artistry of Craig Hella Johnson and Conspirare.”\n\n“This work is a prism for refracting deep meaning and truth. It celebrates the noblest faculties of human life – the ability to share sorrow, create hope, and embrace human oneness and act upon it.”\n\n“Thank you for digging so, so deep and sharing it with us. It awakened our most tender, troubled and hopeful places. Great art does that – holds the paradox, makes it visible – but it takes courage and determination to stay there until it’s rooted in our bones. I can tell it is part of you forever, now transformed, and I’m thankful that it is now part of me, as well.”\n\n“The show was a study in the human condition, our dark side and the light.”\n\n“Words and music have conveyed the agony of an innocent boy enduring the irrational hatred of those who tortured and killed him. It is the most outstanding Conspirare concert I have experienced – and I have been to almost all. Thank you and I hope the whole world experiences this incredible work of art.”\n\n“I felt the pew shaking and realized it was my husband next to me trying to suppress his sobs. Wow!”\n\nLGBTQ+ Youth Resources\n\nMatthew Shepard Foundation matthewshepard.org\n\nThe Trevor Project (crisis intervention for LGBTQ youth) thetrevorproject.org\n\nMatthew’s Place (Matthew Shepard Foundation site for LGBTQ youth) matthewsplace.com\n\nPFLAG (LGBTQ support group) community.pflag.org"
