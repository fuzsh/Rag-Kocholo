Caythorpe, Skillington and – of course – Barrowby are all in Lincolnshire.\n\nI suspect that he moved from Essex to Barrowby in the 1970s, then to Caythorpe, and afterwards to Skillington. But alternative scenarios are possible.\n\nBack to top of this page\n\nThis website does not gather or store any visitor information.\n\nCopyright Bob Trubshaw 2021–2022\n\nNo unauthorised copying or reproduction except if all following conditions apply:\n\na: Copy is complete (including this copyright statement).\n\nb: No changes are made.\n\nc: No charge is made."
