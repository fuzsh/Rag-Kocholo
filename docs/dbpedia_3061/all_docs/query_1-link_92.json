        "text": "Virginia Carver Grantham Masters passed away January 18, 2023, surrounded by family. She was born on August 26, 1936, to Lester and Ida Mae Carver in Griffin, GA. Virginia, or Jenny as she was known to many, moved to Cleveland, OK as a teen to help care for her nieces and nephews. After high school, she married Doyle Grantham and moved with him to several locations. During this time, she gave birth to her three sons, Mark, Kent and Paul. Following the death of her husband in 1960, she moved back to Cleveland to be close to family. She called Cleveland home ever since. After working out of town for several years Virginia got a job at the Cleveland Bank. In the early 1980s she began working for the City of Cleveland where she finished her career after 37 years of service. Virginia was a people person and enjoyed getting to know all sorts through her work.\n\nVirginia was devoted to her immediate and extended family, and went out of her way to make sure they had what they needed. Her created family included a large network of friends that were as close as family. Virginia rarely encountered a stranger and always sought to take care of others. One way that was reflected was in the way she always tried to feed you when you walked through the door, regardless of if you were hungry or not, she'd make sure you ate something! If you didn't have a place to go for the holidays, you were strongly encouraged to come to be with her and the family around the table because there was more than enough for everyone. She believed no one should be without and often took clothes and food to those in need or cleaned someone's house because there were bugs. Another way she sought to help others was by attending almost every Tupperware party she was ever invited too. She wasn't one for clubs, but if you were trying to start your own business in Tupperware, Mary Kay, Pampered Chef or Avon, she'd be more than willing to buy something to help you out. Even if she didn't need a fifth set of mixing bowls!\n\nVirginia enjoyed socializing and especially playing games with family and friends such as Yahtzee, Bunko, Uno and Nerts. Whether hosting a get together or attending, she always made sure there was enough to eat by cooking way too much food. Luckily her family and friends loved to eat! Virginia was also a collector of many things. If you ever wanted to go to a garage sale or the flea market, she was your gal. She spent many hours with good friends stopping at every garage sale sign they found on the weekends. When she became less active, she was always a phone call away. Many will miss her warm 'hi baby' when she answered the phone. She was always there for those she loved and will be greatly missed!\n\nVirginia was preceded in death by her parents; her brother Charles and sisters Mildred, Betty, and Anne; her nephew Frank and niece Darla; and beloved granddaughter Darrah. Also by husbands Doyle Grantham and Roy Masters. Virginia leaves behind her three sons: Mark and daughter-in-law Eileen of Hominy, OK; Kent and daughter-in-law Brenda of Benton, KS; Paul and daughter-in-law Rhonda of Cleveland, OK; sister Patricia Moore of Griffin, GA. Beloved Grandchildren Nicki and husband Gabe Sullard of Poteau, OK; Jennifer Grantham of Hominy, OK; Lara Nguyen of Andover, KS; Heather Grantham and husband Indra Dutta of St. Paul, MN; Will Grantham of Mustang, OK; and Alice Grantham of Terlton, OK. She is also survived by great grandchildren Spencer Nguyen, Ryli Nguyen, Brody Sullard, Levi Sullard, Shiprah Dutta, Cameron Sullard, Shomeer Dutta, Sidney Grantham, Shabhit Dutta, Aydin Boyd and Oscar Grantham. Other beloved family Linda Davidson, Denise Norrid, Cindy Davis, Sheryl Thatcher and many more.\n\nCopyright Notice\n\nÂ© 2023 (Chapman-Black Funeral Home)\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED.
