        "text": "Grantham History, Family Crest & Coats of Arms\n\nOrigins Available:\n\nEngland\n\nThe ancient history of the Grantham name begins with the ancient Anglo-Saxon tribes of Britain. The name is derived from when the family resided in Grantham, a town located in the county of Lincolnshire. The name was derived from the Old English word grand which may have been derived from the personal name Granta and the Old English word ham meaning \"homestead\" 1\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Origins of the Grantham family\n\nThe surname Grantham was first found in Lincolnshire at Grantham, a market town within the South Kesteven district, which was first listed in the Domesday Book as Grantham. 2 3\n\nThe place name probably meant \"homestead or village of a man called Granta\" derived from the Old English personal name + ham. Alternatively, the name could have been derived from the Old English word \"grand\" meaning \"gravel\" + ham. 4\n\nOne of the first records of the family was Thomas de Grantham who was listed in the Curia Regis Rolls for Hertfordshire in 1220. 5\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly History of the Grantham family\n\nThis web page shows only a small excerpt of our Grantham research. Another 103 words (7 lines of text) covering the years 1328, 1544, 1573, 1589, 1604, 1612, 1629, 1630, 1634, 1640, 1641, 1655, 1692 and 1718 are included under the topic Early Grantham History in all our PDF Extended History products and printed products wherever possible.\n\nLoading...\n\nGrantham Spelling Variations\n\nUntil quite recently, the English language has lacked a definite system of spelling rules. Consequently, Anglo-Saxon surnames are characterized by a multitude of spelling variations. Changes in Anglo-Saxon names were influenced by the evolution of the English language, as it incorporated elements of French, Latin, and other languages. Although Medieval scribes and church officials recorded names as they sounded, so it is common to find one person referred to by several different spellings of his surname, even the most literate people varied the spelling of their own names. Variations of the name Grantham include Grantham, Grantam, Grantem, Grantum, Granthem and others.\n\nLoading...\n\nEarly Notables of the Grantham family\n\nNotables of this surname at this time include:\n\nSir Thomas Grantham (1573-1630), an English politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1604 to 1629, matriculated at Christ Church, Oxford (1589); and his son, Thomas Grantham (1612-1655), an Eng...\n\nThomas Grantham (1634-1692), was a general Baptist divine, \"born at Halton-Holegate, near Spilsby, Lincolnshire, in 1634.

Unfortunately, the majority of them traveled under extremely harsh conditions: overcrowding on the ships caused the majority of the immigrants to arrive diseased, famished, and destitute from the long journey across the ocean. For those families that arrived safely, modest prosperity was attainable, and many went on to make invaluable contributions to the development of the cultures of the new colonies. Research into the origins of individual families in North America revealed records of the immigration of a number of people bearing the name Grantham or a variant listed above:\n\nGrantham Settlers in United States in the 17th Century\n\nAndrew Grantham, who landed in Newbury, Massachusetts in 1667 7\n\nGrantham Settlers in United States in the 18th Century\n\nJer Grantham, who arrived in Virginia in 1706 7\n\nJohn Grantham, who arrived in Pennsylvania in 1772\n\nJohn Grantham, who settled in New England in 1778\n\nGrantham Settlers in United States in the 19th Century\n\nPeter Grantham, who settled in New York in 1807\n\nPeter Grantham, aged 28, who landed in New York in 1807 7\n\nHenry I Grantham, who landed in New York, NY in 1816 7\n\nJames Grantham, who arrived in Philadelphia in 1851\n\nGrantham migration to Australia +\n\nEmigration to Australia followed the First Fleets of convicts, tradespeople and early settlers.

Mottoes first began to be shown with arms in the 14th and 15th centuries, but were not in general use until the 17th century. Thus the oldest coats of arms generally do not include a motto. Mottoes seldom form part of the grant of arms: Under most heraldic authorities, a motto is an optional component of the coat of arms, and can be added to or changed at will; many families have chosen not to display a motto.\n\nMotto: Honore et amore\n\nMotto Translation: With honour and love.\n\nCitations +\n\nBardsley, C.W, A Dictionary of English and Welsh Surnames: With Special American Instances.
