        "text": "Manuel Immanuel was thought to have been born around 1758. He may have been the son of a painter and illustrator of manuscripts of the same name in London. He was an immensely talented artist, and also designed scenery and interior designs of theatres. He used transparencies and lamps to illustrate his work, often illustrating full size animals such as elephants.\n\nIn 1805 The New Street Theatre on Red Lion Street in Boston was built to house Robertson’s Touring Company. When it was completed in January 1806, it could accommodate 1,079 people. It was reported that the interior decorations from ‘the Masterly pencil of Mr Immanuel, evince a taste and genius, which add to the reputation he already acquired as an artist’. Whilst in Boston he joined the local Lodge of Freemasons.\n\nIn 1809, there were many celebrations to commemorate King George III, who had acceded to the throne nearly fifty years before. At St Ives in Cambridgeshire, Mr Immanuel, who was at that time living in Bedford, painted a large transparency and was given huge acclaim for his work. At was noted that he had recently produced a similar piece in Huntingdon.\n\nBy 1814 he was living in Grantham, when he subscribed to a book called A genealogical history of the English sovereigns, from William I. to George III. inclusive: Accompanied with a brief statement of the principal events ... and illustrated by genealogical tables, by William Toplis. On 27 March 1815, his one man panoramic exhibition opened at the Lyceum theatre in London and lasted until mid May. His paintings were in oil, painted on velvet, and occupied 2,160 square feet. The display space was a segment of a circle, and so it was described as panoramic. Some paintings were copies that he made of a variety of famous paintings, such as Ruben’s ‘Daniel in the Lion’s Den’, while others were his own composition such as ‘Rural Scene’ and ‘African Wilderness’. The entrance of the theatre from the Strand was newly painted, and the royal family visited the exhibition in April.\n\nThe painting of Grantham Market Place in 1820, showing the opening of the mid-Lent fair, was thought to be by Immanuel. The painting appears to show an exhibition of paintings and may have illustrated his work. This painting now forms part of the Lincolnshire Collection. At the same time he transferred his Freemason membership to the Lodge in Grantham.\n\nManuel Immanuel continued to live in Grantham, in his house on the Market Place, where he had established an academy and taught drawing. In July 1821 Grantham celebrated the coronation of George IV. The church tower was draped with a flag, and the bells were rung from seven in the morning until the evening. The Corporation processed in their robes to church, where a service was held. Over 500 children from local Sunday School also attended. A meal was served afterwards in the Town Hall and local hostelries, of roast beef, plum pudding and strong beer. Women and children were given money to enjoy themselves at home. In the evening a large bonfire was lit in the Market Place and a general illumination of transparencies and exhibitions took place. Many shop keepers also had transparencies in their windows, including Mr Immanuel. Over the next few years, Immanuel stayed in Grantham and is mentioned as subscribing to several books. He continued to teach at his drawing academy until his death in 1834, aged 71. He is described in the Stamford Mercury as a drawing master and rigid observer of the laws of Moses, and celebrated as a connoisseur, an antiquary and a Hebrew scholar. Some of his paintings are now in the Lincolnshire Collection. He is buried in Nottingham in the Sherwood Street Jewish cemetery."
