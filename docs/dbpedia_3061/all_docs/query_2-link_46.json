In 2018, Steve Forbes awarded him the Triple Crown in Economics for his work in economic theory, history and education (see www.mskousen.com).

He has written articles for the Wall Street Journal, Reason, Human Events, the Daily Caller, Christian Science Monitor and The Journal of Economic Perspectives. He has appeared on CNBC, ABC, CNN, Fox News and C-SPAN Book TV. In 2008-09, he was a regular contributor to Larry Kudlow & Co. on CNBC.\n\nHis economic bestsellers include “The Structure of Production“ (NYU Press, 1990, 2007, 2015), “Economics on Trial” (Irwin, 1991), “Puzzles and Paradoxes on Economics” (Edward Elgar, 1997), “The Making of Modern Economics” (Routledge, 2001, 2009, 2016), “The Big Three in Economics” (M.

In “volume 2” of his life, the Skousens compiled and edited Franklin’s writings from 1757 until his death in 1790, resulting in “The Completed Autobiography, by Benjamin Franklin” (Regnery, 2006). It covers his life as a colonial agent, signer of the Declaration of Independence, ambassador to France, and signer of the U. S. Constitution.\n\nBased on his work “The Structure of Production” (NYU Press, 1990), the federal government began publishing a broader, more accurate measure of the economy, Gross Output (GO) -- www.grossoutput.com --, every quarter along with GDP . It is the first macro statistic of the economy to be published quarterly since GDP was invented in the 1940s.\n\nIn honor of his work in economics, finance and management, Grantham University renamed its business school, “The Mark Skousen School of Business.”\n\nDr. Skousen has lived in eight nations and traveled and lectured throughout the United States and 70 countries. He grew up in Portland, Oregon.

She has co-authored several books on finance and economics with her husband Mark Skousen and was the editor of the monthly newsletter “Jo Ann Skousen’s Money Letter for Women” until it was merged with “Mark Skousen’s Forecasts & Strategies.” She teaches English literature and writing at Chapman University and Sing Sing Correctional Facility and was a featured teacher in the HBO documentary, “University of Sing Sing.”\n\nFor over twenty years Jo Ann taught scripture study classes for her church while also teaching Classic Mythology and Bible Literature in her Honors English courses. Both of these teaching experiences, one focusing on religion and the other on literary archetypes, have given her great insights into the hearts and lives of the people who inhabit the scriptures. An avid traveler, she has led groups through the Mediterranean from Athens to Rome, relating both the classical myths and the Bible stories that took place in each location.\n\nMatriarchs of the Messiah: Valiant Women in the Lineage of Jesus Christ is the first book to focus entirely on the dozen women who are identified in the Bible as direct maternal ancestors of Jesus Christ. The list includes the wives of the prophets Noah, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, but it also includes cultural outsiders like Tamar, Rahab, Ruth and Bathsheba, who were grafted into the lineage of the Messiah through marriage and motherhood. Skousen’s well-researched book offers a bold new look at the women of the Bible. She presents them as valiant, courageous problem-solvers who exercised agency in determining the right path for their posterity."
