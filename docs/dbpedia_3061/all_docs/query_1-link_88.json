        "text": "Summary:\n\nIn the near future, a few young women manifest extraordinary abilities called \"Shine.\" Each girl's ability is different. Some develop extraordinary mental abilities. Some become physically strong. Others have powers that defy description. But the world does not embrace these Shines. It fears them.\n\nAs professional hellraisers, sisters May and Lillie Wheaton believe they’re prepared for any situation. A client hires them to find her missing daughter and it seems like just another job until they realize the lost girl is a Shine. She’s been captured by New York’s most devious gang, the Xeros. May and Lillie track down the Xeros, but are horrified to learn the gang uses Shines in violent, deadly cage fights. Too late, May and Lillie realize the Xeros are smarter than they expected and, armed with the explosive power of Shines, are incredibly powerful. The lines between ally and enemy, between sister and friend, are about to change--fatally.\n\nRelease Date: February 5, 2014\n\nAge Group: YA\n\nSource: Review copy from author\n\nReviewed By: Kelli"
