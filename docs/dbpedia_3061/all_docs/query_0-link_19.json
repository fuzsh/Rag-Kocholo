However, some of the members ask her to take a look at the club first. While touring the grounds, she starts to fall in love with the place and also with one of its handsome patrons. Jane soon finds herself embroiled in a hazardous love triangle.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nShelley Martin as Jane Robinson\n\nBrian Cobby as Bob Sutton[7]\n\nNatalie Lynn as Aunt Meg\n\nAnthony Oliver as Stephen Blake\n\nJoy Hinton as Carol Sutton\n\nJacqueline D'Orsay as Gloria Phillips\n\nPaul Kendrick as Tim Sutton\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nIt was one of only two films directed by Herrington, the other being Compelled (1960), also produced by the Danzigers.\n\nCritical reception\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Monthly Film Bulletin wrote: \"Games, bathing, sing-songs and rock'n'roll punctuate this ingenuously written and acted piece of propaganda; but without the slightest stimulus of some kind of showmanship the sight of bare bodies basking in a Technicolor sun begins to pall very early on.\"[8]\n\nKine Weekly wrote: \"The picture cunningly uses its uninhibited story to mirror the many aspects of nudist camp life, including, games, swimming and sing-songs. Shelley Martin shows plenty of spirit and a well-upholstererd chassis as Jane, Brian Cobby is a manly Bob, Jacqueline D'Orsay fills the bill as the unscrupulous Gloria, Anthony Oliver registers as the caddish Steve, and Natalie Lynn gives a homely touch to the proceedings as Aunt Meg. The sensational is avoided by familiarising audiences with sex, Technicolor gives a professional sheen to the 'brochure' and the musical accompaniment is first-class.\"[9]\n\nPicture Show called the film a \"sugary, sweet coy romance set in a nudist colony.\"[10]\n\nThe Manchester Guardian wrote: \"It's the Citizen Kane of nudist films.\"[citation needed]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
