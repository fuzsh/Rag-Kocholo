        "text": "Under the forest canopy\n\nMany have read Shel Silverstein’s book The Giving Tree about that altruistic tree that gave and gave to a selfish, little boy until there was nothing left to give. I think of that sad tale sometimes when walking in the forest and see a very different story with a more satisfying ending. Rather than sacrificing themselves for others, trees are doing their best to survive and flourish. Luckily, byproducts of their efforts benefit animals, birds, insects, plants, fungi, humans, and even one another.\n\nSometimes when two trees grow into one another, the bark is worn away exposing the cambium layer. When they heal, the two trees are fused together in what is known as inosculation (from Latin ‘osculari’ for ‘kiss'). We could learn a lot from these kissing trees about facing adversity and getting along.\n\nEven in the middle of a busy week, I feel like I'm on vacation when I take a walk in the woods. Every step there is something different to see in the diversity of an unplanned forest where only the laws of nature apply. Trees continue to give throughout their lives and long after they have died eventually becoming part of the soil itself.\n\nThese photos show some of the ways that trees are benefiting their neighbors.\n\nThe fallen part on the left looks like 'rabbitat' to quote forester Dode Gladders. The still standing part of the trunk on the right is gradually eroding into the soil.\n\nKissing Maple Trees on the Brookside Park Trail\n\nA beaver dam on Blackberry Way in the Sawyer Brook Headwaters seen on a hike led by Dave Wood of the Grantham Conservation Commission.\n\nA pileated woodpecker's morning work on a tree on Butternut Trail\n\nA convenient place of safety for a skittish bear cub\n\nJoey Holmes and her friend Evelyn Munson in 2012\n\nJoey Holmes is the beloved matriarch of Grantham and will be celebrating her 90th birthday on February 27th. I'm encouraging everyone who reads this to send Joey a birthday card. She is living with her daughter Cindy Dyer at 141 Miller Pond Road in Grantham.\n\nI interviewed Joey during the pandemic summer of 2020 and the following was posted on August 21, 2020:\n\n​This is about a well loved local legend who has a unique history with our small town of Grantham. Her name is Joey Dunbar Holmes and here's her story:\n\nIn 1900, Joey’s great uncle Lorenzo donated money for a library in memory of his wife Ellen. The library was named The Dunbar Free Library. Eighty years later when Linda Moore was the librarian, Joey would check out books for patrons while Linda ran the story hour. Her volunteer work led to Joey’s being hired as an assistant librarian where she worked for forty years before retiring as Assistant Director of Inter-Library Loans.\n\nJoey grew up in a house next to the library where the parking lot sits today. After her mother passed away, the home was sold and eventually acquired by the library. A much needed addition to the library was planned in 2009 which would mean that the homestead would have to go. The original plan called for clear cutting the lot with demolition of the house, barn, and outbuildings, and all the shrubs and trees.\n\nEnter a Knight in Shining Armor--Andy Gelston. Andy is Joey’s fellow library staffer who “didn’t want Joey, the town matriarch, to have to witness her childhood home being smashed with an excavator and hauled off in dumpsters.” Rather than tearing them down, it took Andy and another local hero Otis TenHaken three months to dismantled the buildings. All the reusable wood was sold with the proceeds going to insurance (in case Andy or Otis fell off the roof) and to the library’s construction fund. Many people took advantage of the wood sale. Joey enjoyed speaking with the people who came in to the library to pay for their materials. To be honest, there were a few midnight requisitions. (I hope those thieves got splinters.)\n\nI like to think of the wood from Joey’s well loved home being embedded in rooms and sheds all around town. Grantham Garden Club member Janie Clark wrote “We too are enjoying part of it..... The huge rocks in the rock garden here are from the foundation of Joey's house. Matt Gallien moved them from the cellar hole to our garden.\"\n\nThe original clear cutting plan also included destroying the flowering crab apple tree that Joey had planted for her mother as a tiny sapling on Mother's Day in 1957. Despite his not being a restoration expert, Andy changed the plans to save the tree. The tree that sits in the island outside the library to this day and is pictured below.\n\nLike many of the gardener club gardeners’ homes I have visited, there are keepsakes and transplants to remind them of their earlier lives. When I interviewed Joey at her home off Rte. 10, she pointed out the granite slab entrance to her house that once was the entrance to her old home next to the library. Growing outside her window are the roses that bloomed outside her mother’s. Her favorite tree flourishes by the town library for her, and for all of us, to enjoy.\n\nThank you, Joey, for all you have done for the library and the town!\n\nPhotograph of the crab apple tree in all its Spring glory was taken by Sir Andy Gelston.\n\nJanie Clark's garden with her rock garden on the right.\n\nGGC members Amelia Lantz, Renee Gustafson, Kathy Houghton, Marty Gearhart, and visiting volunteer Sierra Keat\n\nSeven years ago Renee Gustafson was looking for a project to complete her master gardener certification and liked the recommendation by Grantham Conservation Commission member Dennis Ryan to create a pollinator garden in Brookside Park. Renee chose the site of the old apple orchard in the park and invited Kristina Burgard and Patty Eaves, who were also in the master gardener program, to join her. Renee, Kristina, and Patty engaged with other people and organizations in and around Grantham to help them including:\n\n- Eastman Charitable Foundation funded the purchase of trees, bushes, seeds, daffodil bulbs, and soil (lot and lots of soil).\n\n- Dunbar Free Library loaned them a sun plotting gizmo.\n\n- Hortons Farm donated horse manure.\n\n- Dunkin Donuts donated bags of coffee grounds. People dropped off coffee grounds at a pail located at the park entrance.\n\n-Dennis Ryan and fellow Conservation Commission member Dave Wood cut down four white pine trees and pruned some of the apple trees.\n\n- Dick Hocker, another Conservation Commission member and Renee's husband, erected a kiosk at the orchard area which Renee populated with information.\n\nAfter months of hard work including lugging an enormous amount of soil and planting trees, bushes, seeds, and bulbs; Renee, Kristina, and Patty had created a garden area they could be proud of. I happened upon it in June of 2021 and was so impressed that I wrote a blog post called The Secret Garden. I never knew who was responsible for the sweet garden until recently. (Picture of flowers are the last one in the collage below.)\n\nA few years ago, Marty Gearhart moved to Grantham and joined the Grantham Conservation Commission where she has worked with them on a number of projects including making Grantham a Pollinator Pathway. One link in the pathway chain that needed some more work was that well loved land in Brookside Park where Renee, Kristina, and Patty had made such a difference. Marty formed a team with Renee and Amelia Lantz that I'm calling Phase II. They went to the property together to discuss what was doing well since Phase I, what needed work, and how they could help the aged apples trees. They invited three environmentalists to visit the area to help them make decisions about what to keep, what to cut, and what to plant. Those three remarkable environmentalists are pictured below.\n\nRecently, I overheard that the team was going to work on the site and asked if I could tag along. When Amelia and Renee showed up with their chain saws, I knew this was going to be cool. Marty brought her own tools and recruited Kathy Houghton who came with her pole cutter and Sierra Keat who was visiting from DC and looking for volunteer opportunities to fulfill her AmeriCorps requirements. With the team of five women in place, the sawdust was soon flying. Amelia, Renee, and Kathy pruned while Marty and Sierra hauled away the cuttings to a large brush pile for animals which Dode Gladders calls \"rabbitat.\"\n\nMore advisers were brought in before major cuts were made to the trees. Jeff and Susan Figley who own King Blossom Farm on Dunbar Hill Road spent almost two hours answering questions about the trees and making everyone more optimistic about the future of these historic apple trees. Janie Clark, who grew up near her Dad's 156-acre orchard in the Hudson Valley, also came out to help. On February 2nd, I was there to take some pictures of Dave Wood pruning high in the apple trees to give the them more sunshine, more breathing space and less wood to help them use their energy to flower.\n\n​This year's pruning is done but the work isn't over yet. In the spring, I will send out volunteer requests to the Grantham Garden Club to help Marty, Renee, and Amelia plant flowers which will give people the opportunity to contribute to this fun project.\n\nI admire Renee, Kristina, Patty, Marty, Amelia, Kathy, Sierra, Lionel Chute, Dode Gladders, Gail McWilliam Jellie, Jeff, Susan, Janie, Dave, and the Grantham Conversation Commission members who have dedicated so much of their time, energy, and talent to making Grantham a better place for pollinators, trees, and flowers, and for us ordinary people to enjoy.\n\nSullivan County Environmental educator Lionel Chute at Brookside Park with Marty in September\n\nForester Dode Gladders with Amelia and Renee in the old orchard area in October\n\nUNH Extension Program Assistant in Food and Agriculture Gail McWilliam Jellie\n\nTeleschistaceae lichen on volcanic rock in Iceland\n\n​I read a sign near the Capilano Suspension bridge in British Columbia last April which read: Lichens are one of the most bizarre forms of life because each lichen is actually composted of two, possibly even three, distinct species of organisms. Lichens are a partnership between fungus and algae that grow on rocks, tree branches and the bare ground. Lichens are considered living fossil plants since they are directly linked to the original plant life that first inhabited the Earth.\n\nEver since I happened upon that sign, I've been on a quest to take pictures of as many lichen and lichen-lookalikes that I could find. Luckily my PictureThis plant identifier app can differentiate lichen from just plain fungus and algae. PictureThis often identifies them as ‘lichenized.’\n\nLichens have no roots, stems, flowers, or leaves. They get their nutrients from the air and from rainwater. They are often grow in dark places where nothing else will. They can be found from the arctic to the tropics and some even survived a two week experimental stint in outer space. They contribute 80% of the nitrogen needed in a forest and are extremely sensitive to air pollution so are like the canary in the coal mine. Where there's lots of lichens, the air quality is better. Studies have shown that lichens growing on headstones in rural cemeteries are much more abundant and diverse than those in urban ones. When I google “lichens and cemeteries,” ads for detergents to kill lichen were the most numerous hits. Sounds like a bad idea to me.\n\nHere’s a crazy bit of info for you—if it wasn’t for lichens and their friends the mosses and bacteria, the Great Wall of China might be a 13,000 mile long pile of rubble. Scientists studied the 'biocrust' made up on lichen, algae, and bacteria that grew there. They theorize that this living skin strengthens the wall and shields it from moisture and temperature fluctuations.\n\nIf in your travels near and far you should spot an interesting lichen-like plant or perhaps some growing on a famous tombstone or, better yet, on the Great Wall of China; please send me a picture. I’ll add it to this collection of lichen photos.\n\nBubblegum lichen on berm behind Grantham Town Hall\n\nTeloschistaceae lichen was reclassified in 2013\n\nUmbilicariaceae lichenized fungus in Knight's Hill in New London\n\nShadow lichen\n\nFruiticose lichen in Eastman, NH\n\nCandleflame lichen in Iceland\n\nParmeliaceae lichen on a tree beside Eastman Lake\n\nReindeer lichen in Heath Forest--In Europe it provides 2/3 of reindeer and caribou diet\n\nLichens grow on the memorial in Gettysburg National Military Park to the 2nd Massachusetts Infantry where on July 3, 1863, 45 of their number were killed in action including my great-great grandfather.\n\n​A holiday centerpiece-making frenzy happened on December 8th, but not before the many moving parts were put in place by a bunch of dedicated garden club members and their connections.\n\nPlanning started in March when Kristina Cole, Kathy Houghton, Tina Gleich and I met to discuss the feasibility of making holiday centerpieces for Meals on Wheels. Steve Rudolph connected us with Jay Welenc who runs Meals on Wheels in Lebanon. Jay enthusiastically approved the project. Kristina volunteered take the lead assisted by Kathy. The centerpiece project was the perfect opportunity to adapt the club’s pandemic-abandoned plan to run a boxwood tree workshop in 2020. Right after Christmas in 2019, Elise Kendall and Sue Coakley purchased deeply discounted Christmas decorations—oodles of adorable Christmas decorations. The little bulbs, ornaments, and wired sticks sat in storage for almost three years. The club loves to reuse and repurpose items and ideas.\n\nKathy had the resourceful idea to repurpose mushroom containers, and asked club members to keep those containers for the centerpiece workshop. Thank you to all the folks who obviously ate lots of mushrooms. As a retired small business owner, Kristina has lots of contacts and used her connections to get mugs and other items needed for the centerpieces. One contact, Jamie Loura of COVER Home Repair in White River Junction, Vermont, donated 50 holiday mugs. Kristina, Kathy, Diane Cameron, Sue Berg, and I scoured thrift shops and bought Christmassy mugs. Between the mushroom containers and the mugs, we had more than enough bases for all the centerpieces.\n\nSweet smelling, fresh greens were needed and lots of them. Dotsy Miles accompanied Kathy and me to Balsam Woods Tree Farm and introduced us to the delightful owners Kristian and Sebastian Baca who graciously donated a large amount of freshly cut Balsam branches. (If you’re in the market for a Christmas tree or wreath, stop by Balsam Woods Tree farm at 240 Maple Street in Newport, NH which is opened on weekends.)\n\nKristina’s contact at Nicols Tree Farm Amy Nichols offered the club a nice discount. Jenny Gelfan walked around the farm with Kristina and helped her harvest perfect centerpiece-making boughs. (If you live in that area, consider checking out Nichols Tree Farm on 163 Dartmouth College Highway in Lyme, NH.)\n\nWe still weren't sure if we had enough greenery so got permission from Christine Cecchetti of Eastman Recreation to take some of the branches left over from their wreath making workshop. That greenery was pruned from the woods by the Eastman Maintenance Department. We ended up with more than we needed, but I am happy to report that ALL of it was put to good use.\n\nGrantham’s own Recreation Department’s Emily Rinde-Thorsen ran Breakfast with Santa in the Town Hall the previous weekend and, when asked, left lots of her lovely decorations up to make our event even more festive. Of course none of this was possible without the Town of Grantham and the use of their wonderful facility.\n\nThe day before the event, a group of volunteers came to set up and load tables with green boughs, decorations, tubs and mugs. They soaked environmentally friendly Agra-wool and stuffed them in the tubs and mugs.\n\nWhen December 8th finally arrived, lots of people showed up bringing in baked goods to share. Some people brought more holiday decorations, mushroom containers, and mugs. Our cup runneth over. Kristina presented a brief Centerpiece Making 101 presentation before folks picked out their bases, ornaments and greenery. It was a personality test based on what they chose and how they arranged their works of art. The original plan was to make 120 for Meals on Wheels. That morphed into an additional dozen for the Grantham Food Pantry. Since folks were having so much fun and we had extra makings, another 14 were made and given out to various deserving folks around town including the club’s five civic sponsors Bar Harbor Bank, Shepherd Realty, Coldwell Banker Lifestyles, Lady Grantham Apiary, and Willis Auto.\n\nSo what did we do with the leftovers greens? Participants were encouraged to take branches home for their own holiday decorations, and many did. Dana Ramsport at the Transfer Station had us pile up some of the remaining branches accessible for people wanting to take some. Lastly, Lin Hill brought a large bunch of the fresh greens to her friend Cammie in Plainfield who fed them to her sheep Daisy and Clover.\n\nThank you to the army of people who helped make this happen. Picture those 146 lovingly made centerpieces spreading holiday joy all over the Upper Valley. ​Happy Holidays!\n\n​When generous Garden Angels purchased 818 daffodil bulbs for the town, the idea to plant two rows all along the post office was hatched. Project Post Office took a lot more muscle than the usual garden club volunteer gig. Most of the men were recruited at Eastman's pickleball courts. Russ Miles lives on Stocker Pond Road and has mail delivered so doesn’t even have a horse in the race. Russ brought his pick up truck and his son’s trailer with a handy dumper which was integral to making it all work.\n\nThe challenge was to dig up zillions of small rocks and clear a trench 12 inches deep, 12 inches wide and 42 feet long. When one guy started singing “That's the sound of the men working on the Chain Gang” everyone joined in--complete with grunts and laughter. Sue Berg was a one-woman bucket brigade with help from the men when a bucket got too full. Sue kept the diggers supplied with empty buckets making the entire process run like a well oiled machine.\n\nOnce the trench was dug, the work was far from over. The team headed to the Transfer Station. Having a place to dump the truckload of rocks and fill it back up with free compost was crucial to the project’s success so a big thank you goes to Dana Ramspott who gave his okay.\n\nThe whole project came in ahead of schedule (3.5 hours) and on budget ($0) with the hard work of volunteers Ben Lavoie, Bob Munson, Bruce Altobelli, Jim Berg, Kevin Williams, Mark Kendall, Russ Miles, Stephen Handley, and Sue Berg. For most of these folks, giving up pickleball on a perfect Sunday morning was a sacrifice. Everyone deserve kudos for a job well done. Can't wait to see all those daffodils in the spring.\n\n​Despite being over 300 miles away, Longwood Garden is known to many people in Grantham. Often when I told fellow garden club folks that I had visited Longwood, their eyes would light up as they told me of their trips there.\n\nTwo of the aspects of the garden that stood out to me were the army of docents peppered throughout the property eager to point out hidden gems and interesting facts. The other was the water fountains including small, medium, and huge ones. The fountains were the idea of Pierre de Pont, the wealthy entrepreneur who purchased the land in 1906 to prevent the arboretum on the property from falling into the hands of a greedy logging company.\n\nWhen Pierre was six years old, he visited the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia where he saw a huge water fountain display. He used some of his fortune to have elaborate fountains installed at Longwood. Visitors were drawn to the fountains on that hot summer day when I visited. Little children ran in and out of strategic locations to get optimally soaked by splashes from the fountains. Pierre would have smiled at the sight.\n\nNow that I've visited Longwood in late summer, I'm anxious to return in spring, and autumn, and...\n\nThe Conservatory is open year round\n\nTropical dogwood growing in the Conservatory\n\nElise Kendal helps out some young customers\n\nThe Grantham Recreation Department runs Music in the Meadow which is a quintessential small town event. where families bring their lawn chairs and listen to talented performers. After their picnic dinners, they often are up for something sweet, and that's where the garden club comes in.\n\nEach week a couple of volunteers don the GGC aprons, load up a table with home baked goodies, and accept donations for the scholarship fund in exchange for the sweets. They chat with the performers, the food truck folks, soccer moms and dads, couples, and lots and lots of children.\n\nI love it when a tot comes to the table clutching a dollar bill and picks out the cookie of his or her choice. The parents aren’t there (though I suspect they’re watching nearby) as the child has his or her first solo purchasing experience. Definitely a rite of passage!\n\nFive-year-old Sutton is a regular at our table and calls us the Olive Garden Ladies according to her mom Emily Rinde-Thorsen who runs Grantham Rec. Another regular, four-year-old Ludo recommended that we make enough cookies to give one to every single person in the large crowd. He and his pal Darby had an absolute blast at the first event this year when a sudden downpour interrupted the music. They ran around the field getting as wet as they could and then figured out that could get even wetter if they stood under the edge of the GGC awning. They ran to each side begging the tall grownups to push the awning. In true GGC spirit, we obliged.\n\nOver these two summers, we have doled out more than a thousand cookies and brownies. Imagine the hours of time the volunteer bakers have clocked making their sweet treats. None of this could happen without them. Last summer, Kristina Cole attended a concert and offered to bake cookies and she wasn’t even a member (then).\n\nIf you haven’t had a chance to attend Music in the Meadow yet, consider coming on August 22nd or 29th. Bring your appetite ;-)\n\nSutton who coined the Olive Garden Ladies\n\nUnder the GGC awning with Carolee Shevlin and Betsy Fowler with Ludo and Darby's fathers Emmanuel and Adam\n\nLudo and Darby"
