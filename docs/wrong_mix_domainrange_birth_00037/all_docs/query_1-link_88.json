        "text": "Prime Minister Theresa May has paid tribute to the former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan, who has died aged 80, calling him a \"great leader\".\n\nHis foundation announced the death on Saturday following a short illness.\n\nMrs May said Mr Annan reformed the UN and made a \"huge contribution to making the world he has left a better place than the one he was born into\".\n\nFormer prime minister Tony Blair said he was a \"great diplomat, a true statesman and a wonderful colleague\".\n\nMr Anann served as UN chief from 1997 to 2006 and was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nThe diplomat, who was originally from Ghana, died in hospital in the Swiss city of Bern. He had been living near Geneva for several years before his death.\n\nFormer PM Gordon Brown also paid tribute to Mr Annan, who was the first black African to become UN secretary-general.\n\nMr Blair said: \"I'm shocked and distressed to hear the news about Kofi. He was a good friend whom I saw only weeks ago.\"\n\nHe said Mr Annan was \"widely respected and will be greatly missed\".\n\nMr Blair's spell in No 10 coincided with Mr Annan's time as secretary-general and the pair clashed over the 2003 invasion of Iraq, by US and British troops - a war which Mr Annan called illegal.\n\nMr Brown, who is currently the UN special envoy for global education, said it had been \"a privilege\" to work with Mr Annan.\n\nHe said: \"Kofi Annan was a leader of leaders, a wonderful humanitarian and the most compassionate and caring of individuals.\n\n\"Personally modest and always softly spoken, he was a titan amongst world statesman who saw wrong and righted it and who witnessed evil and always fought it.\"\n\nMr Brown added: \"Even in his later years he fought against poverty, injustice and war with all the vigour of youth and I had the privilege of working with him in recent times.\"\n\nForeign Secretary Jeremy Hunt also paid tribute.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .
