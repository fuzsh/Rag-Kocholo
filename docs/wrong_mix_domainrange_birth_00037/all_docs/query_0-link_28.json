        "text": "Ghana is a coastal developing country in West Africa. It is known for being the first African country in 1957 to declare independence from Europe, which influenced other countries to follow suit over the following decades. Today, Ghana has one of Africaâ€™s most stable governments and sixth largest economy on the continent; the country is rich in resources such as gold, petroleum and cocoa beans. The country is also known for being the birthplace and home of the world-renowned former UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan.\n\nSafety & Security\n\nTravellers and expatriates should exercise a high degree of caution in Ghana. Due to political and ethnic tensions, Government of Canada warns tourists and expatriates excise caution and avoid events during the December 7, 2016 election period. Be aware of your personal belongings as purse snatching by individuals on motorbikes are increasing in Ghana. Also, there have been cases of violent robberies targeting foreigners travelling in taxis at night. Please try to limit visits and trips during day-time hours.\n\nHealthcare in Ghana\n\nMajor medical facilities are outside urban areas.
