        "text": "Kofi Atta Annan was born in Kumasi, Ghana, on April 8, 1938. He earned degrees from Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota (1961); the Graduate Institute of International Studies (Geneva); and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, Massachusetts (1971-1972). Annan began his career with the United Nations in 1962 and held various posts, including Deputy Director to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (1980-1983) and Under-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping (1995-1996). Annan was the first Secretary-General chosen from the ranks of the United Nations staff, serving in that post from 1997 to 2006. In 2001 Annan and the United Nations were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their ongoing work in global peace and cooperation."
