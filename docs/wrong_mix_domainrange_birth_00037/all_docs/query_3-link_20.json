        "text": "(1938–2018). The first black African to hold the post of secretary-general of the United Nations (UN) was Kofi Annan. The career diplomat spoke several African languages, English, and French and was well respected in the international community. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2001.\n\nKofi Atta Annan was born in Kumasi, Gold Coast (now Ghana), on April 8, 1938, to Henry and Victoria Annan. His family came from the cape coast on the Atlantic Ocean, but Annan spent most of his childhood in the inland town of Bekwai. His father was the elected governor of the Ashanti province and was a chief of the Fante people. The younger Annan studied at the University of Science and Technology in Kumasi and won a Ford Foundation grant that enabled him to study in the United States at Macalester College in Minnesota. While studying economics there, in 1960, he won the Minnesota state oratorical contest. He received a postgraduate certificate in economics from the Institute for Advanced International Studies in Geneva, Switzerland.\n\nFrom 1962 to 1971 Annan worked for the UN as an administration and budget officer with the World Health Organization in Geneva. He received a master’s degree in management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1972, where he was an Alfred P. Sloan fellow. From 1974 to 1976 Annan was managing director of the Ghana Tourist Development Company. Those were his only years away from the UN.\n\nAnnan’s career leading up to the UN’s helm progressed from such day-to-day jobs as assistant secretary-general for program planning, budget, and finance, to head of human resources and security coordinator, director of the budget, chief of personnel for the high commissioner for refugees, and administrative officer for the Economic Commission for Africa. When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, Annan was responsible for getting hundreds of thousands of Asian workers out of Kuwait. He was in charge of the UN peacekeeping operations as undersecretary beginning in March 1993. Annan also served as special UN representative to the former Yugoslavia. He was widely praised for his diplomacy in implementing the accord among Bosnian Serbs, Muslims, and Croats. He also led peacekeeping operations in Burundi, Somalia, and Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo).\n\nAfter nearly four decades of service to the United Nations, Annan was appointed to lead the organization, marking the first time that a secretary-general was elected from the ranks of the UN staff. He succeeded Boutros Boutros-Ghali in December 1996 as the UN’s seventh permanent secretary-general after a contentious nominating period during which the United States was the only member country to position itself against Boutros-Ghali’s reelection. Annan quickly gained the support of the Security Council after three other African candidates under consideration withdrew their names from the list of candidates in the hopes of building a consensus for a secretary-general from Africa. Annan was elected by acclamation and immediately set to work on a reform plan to be instituted in 1997.\n\nAnnan’s vision for the UN included peacekeeping and establishing norms for international law, with an emphasis on the values of equality, tolerance, and human dignity mandated by the UN charter. He brought a deep commitment for a more efficient and leaner UN and an unyielding advocacy for universal human rights. One of his first challenges as secretary-general was to convince the United States to begin paying the 1.4 billion dollars in back dues the country owed. Annan considered the fight against HIV/AIDS to be a personal priority, and he called for the establishment of a global fund to help increase the flow of money for health care in developing countries.\n\nAnnan used his influence in several political situations. Among these were his efforts to convince Iraq to comply with Security Council rulings and his role in effecting the transition to civilian rule in Nigeria. In 1999 Annan facilitated an international response to widespread violence in East Timor. Not content to focus solely on the rights of citizens around the world, Annan also tried to improve the position of women who worked in the Secretariat of the UN, and he began to build stronger relationships with nongovernmental organizations. In June 2001 Annan was unanimously reappointed for a second term as secretary-general. Later that year, the Nobel committee bestowed the Nobel Peace Prize jointly to Annan and the UN on what was the 100th anniversary of the venerable award.\n\nIn 2005 Annan was at the center of controversy following an investigation into the oil-for-food program. That program had allowed Iraq—under UN supervision—to sell a set amount of oil in order to purchase food, medicine, and other necessities. A report described major corruption within the program and revealed that Annan’s son was part of a Swiss business that had won an oil-for-food contract. Although Annan was cleared of wrongdoing, he was criticized for his failure to properly oversee the program. Annan’s second term leading the UN ended in 2006.\n\nIn 2007 Annan was named chairperson of the Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, an organization helping small-scale farmers. That same year he founded the Kofi Annan Foundation, a nonprofit organization that promotes peace, sustainable development, human rights, and the rule of law.\n\nAnnan continued to play a role in international diplomacy. He helped resolve the Kenyan election crisis that began in late 2007, eventually brokering a power-sharing agreement between the government and the opposition in February 2008. In 2012 Annan served as Joint Special Envoy for Syria, which was wracked by civil war, but he was unable to resolve the conflict.\n\nAnnan coauthored a number of works. His memoir Interventions: A Life in War and Peace (cowritten with Nader Mousavizadeh) was published in 2012. Annan died on August 18, 2018, in Bern, Switzerland."
