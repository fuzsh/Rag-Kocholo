“We are stoked to be coming back to Auckland," the Bryan brothers said in a statement posted on the tournament website. "We’ve got a bit of a point to prove. We we’ve won 114 titles together but are yet to get the W in Auckland. We’ve got to change that! Here’s hoping 2019 can be our year.”

It will be Bob Bryan's first tournament since undergoing hip surgery last spring.

In Bob's absence, twin brother Mike Bryan partnered Jack Sock to sweep the Wimbledon, US Open and Nitto ATP Finals championships surging to the world No. 1 doubles ranking.

The Bryan brothers have won more ATP titles than any other doubles pairing in history, a total of 114 together.

The Bryans lost to Sock and Isner in the Indian Wells final in March, bouncing back to win Miami and Monte Carlo before Bob pulled the plug on his season. Bob underwent hip surgery on August 2nd.

Mike Bryan won five titles in 2018, raising his career title total to 121.
