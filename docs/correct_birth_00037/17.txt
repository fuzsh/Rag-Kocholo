Bob and Mike Bryan’s history with The Ojai Tennis Tournament predates their illustrious professional playing careers.

“We always remember as little guys drinking the delicious orange juice and always taking extra cookies,” Bob Bryan told TheOjai.net.

“We also found the grounds to be fun to explore when we were 5 or 6 years old when our parents played in the event. … The whole scene there was so magical for us.”

The 41-year-old twins from Camarillo will return to the magic in April, when they will be toasted as Tournament Honorees for the 122nd Ojai Tennis Tournament.

“The park was so beautiful and majestic, and we were amazed at the large crowds that filled the stands,” Mike Bryan said. “And we always dreamed of someday playing there ourselves.”

The most success doubles team of all time, the Bryans retired in 2020 having won 16 Grand Slam doubles titles together, as well as a record 119 ATP titles, a Davis Cup in 2007, Olympic gold in 2012, and 1,107 total matches.

That run began at the Ojai, where the Bryans won five doubles titles in the 1990s, including the Boys’ 16s in 1993 and 1994, the Boys CIF interscholastic in 1995 and 1996 as Rio Mesa High students, and the Pacific-10 doubles title in 1998 as Stanford students.

Mike and Bob Bryan first burst onto the tennis scene in the 1990s, winning five doubles titles, including the Boys’ 16s in 1993 and 1994, Boys’ CIF Interscholastic in 1995 and 1996 for Rio Mesa High, and in 1998 while sophomores at Stanford.

“There is nothing comparable to playing The Ojai as a young junior growing up in Southern California,” Bob said.

The Bryans are among the 92 Grand Slam winners on The Ojai Wall of Fame.

The Ojai returns Libbey Park and beyond from April 24-28. The Bryans will be honored during a special Friday night fundraising event at Ojai Valley Museum. Tickets are $175 and available at TheOjai.net.

The Bryan Bros. All-Star Band, which includes Mike on guitar and drums and Bob on keyboards, are also scheduled to perform.

The event will be the highlight of a special week in Ojai, which will include potentially the final Pac-12 Conference championships, as the conference faces a murky future. The conference began men’s competition at Ojai as the Pac-8 in 1951 with the women joining in 1982.

The Ojai will also host the California Community College Athletic Association state championships, CIF singles and doubles, and Boys and Girls junior events.

The men’s and women’s Open singles and doubles events features an overall purse of $20,000.

“The Ojai Tennis Tournament is one of the crown jewels of Southern California tennis and we are excited this year to honor the Bryan brothers as Mike and Bob are two of our great champions,” said Carolyn Burke, President of the Ojai Valley Tennis Club. “Come out and join us.”
