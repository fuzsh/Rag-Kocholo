As the most dominant doubles team of all time, pro tennis players Bob and Mike Bryan wowed fans worldwide until their retirement in 2020. But the crowd-pleasing identical twins, known for their signature high-flying chest bump after each victory, echo that thereâs no place like homeâespecially when that home is Californiaâs Central Coast. Though they now live elsewhere, the pair often returns to Camarillo, in Ventura County, roughly halfway between Los Angeles. and Santa Barbara. We sat down with the high-flying pair at the home of the BNP Paribas Open, Indian Wells Tennis Garden near Palm Springs, and asked them to serve up their views on everything from how theyâd spend a perfect day in their home state to their favorite local place for soft tacos.

Where do you live?

Mike: We grew up in Camarillo, and I have a second home there, in Santa Rosa Valley. We live on a little five-acre horse farm; my wifeâs a big horseback rider so weâve got some land out there in the same development as Gary Sinise. Heâs my neighbor.

Bob: Iâm out of state, but Iâm hoping to come to get back to California when my kids are older. Maybe when my daughter goes to Stanford, my alma mater, Iâll move out there.

Why there?

Mike: [My Santa Rosa Valley home is] close to my parents, close to where our roots are. We love the areaâweâve traveled the world and thereâs no place like home. It's just beautiful: the mountains, the ocean five miles away. Thatâs gonna be the place weâll stay once weâre done playing. Weâll probably die in that house.

Bob: I like the variety and diversity of Californiaâmountains, oceans, desertsâthereâs not really any place like it that has it all.

Who or what is your greatest California love?

Mike: Itâs tough to beat the Ventura County and Santa Monica beaches. We grew up bodysurfing there. And we love the mountains tooâup behind Ojai in the Santa Monica Mountainsâmy mom and wife go horseback riding there all the time. We love the Channel Islands tooâon a clear day and you see them on the horizon. It's a great view.

Bob: The fact that you can escape into nature on a trail and see what the Native Americans saw hundreds of years agoâitâs cool.

What is the biggest misperception about California?

Mike: That itâs all about showbiz and Hollywood. You get a whole range of people hereâeven cowboy types. Itâs so diverse.

Bob: Yeah, everyone sees the Hollywood sign and thatâs what they attach to Californiaâbut thatâs just a very small part of this place.

What is the stereotype that most holds true?

Mike: The language. âDudeââitâs what we grew up saying. When people hear us talk they know weâre from California.

Bob: Yeah: âChill out, dude.â

What is your favorite Golden State moment?

Mike: The sunsets on the beach. We always go to the huge sand hill on the way to Malibu. I go up that and watch the sunset and the waves crashing. Mornings are great tooâthe crystal-clear air, the blue sky, the crispness. You can wake up on Christmas and go outside to a 75Âº day.

Bob: The cool shade. The airâs a little thicker on the east coast. I like the freshness in Californiaâjust throw on a light sweater at night and a t-shirt during the day.

Time for a road tripâwhere are you going?

Bob: Iâd go up Highway 1 and stop at Santa Barbara, Hearst Castle, Big Sur, then spend the night at Ventana Inn. Then go to the Santa Cruz boardwalk, and Iâve gotta stop at Stanford. Then go across the Golden Gate Bridge into Muir Woods and then keep going up to Napa to do some wine tasting. Then come back and do it all over again.

Mike: I'd hit the national parks. Weâd go to Sequoia National Parkâmy wife has never been and I want her to see those big trees. Then weâd hit Yosemite, then Lake Tahoe and go out on a boat on the water. Weâd drive around the lakeâon the California side, of courseâroll all the way up the state, then zoom down the I-5 to Joshua Tree National Park.

If you could decree an official state culinary experience, what would it be?

Bob: A carne asada soft taco or a chile verde burritoâthey seem to get it right in Southern California. Iâm always looking for authentic Mexican food.

Mike: Weâd always go to Somis Cafe and Market near Camarillo. It was in the middle of nowhere, and we hit it almost every day. It was pretty greasy and fattening, but it had the best flavor, and you couldnât match those beans and rice and the sauces and salsas. To this day our favorite is Mexican food. A huevos rancheros breakfastâyou canât beat it.

Bob: Yeah, if we had one last meal on this earth, it would be Mexican food from Somis Market.

Best California song?

Bob: âCalifornia Loveâ by Dr. Dre and Tupac.

Mike: And any songs by the Beach Boysâmy dad went to high school with them. He taught us to play music at an early age, and he taught us all the Beach Boys songsââSurfinâ USA,â âCalifornia Girls.â

How would your California dream day unfold?

Bob: Weâd wake up early, drop the kids off at school. Weâd go on a bike ride in Ojai, maybe take a boat out on Lake Casitas, then swing over to Carpinteria Beachâthe so-called safest beach in the worldâand do a little body-whomping. Come back down, pick up the kids, go to the Santa Barbara Zoo, maybe do some shopping at the outlets. Then bedtime with some good Mexican food.

Mike: Iâd wake up early, go get some great breakfast down in Venice, then go roller-blading along the beach. Take off the blades and go into the ocean for a little dip. Then get some lunch in Bel Air, maybe catch a concert with friends at the Hollywood Bowlâ¦

Bob: Which concert?

Mike: Maroon 5. Then Iâd go watch the sunsetâ¦

Bob: Where?

Mike: In Yosemite.

Bob: Youâd need a space ship. Sounds like a good day.

Mike: Then Iâd come back and do some horseback riding with my wife, then shut it down. Yeah, that sounds like a good day.
