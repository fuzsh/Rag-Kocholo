He then retired from Builders Supply.\n\nBob was an avid Illini and Bears fan, with a small nod to the Chiefs. He enjoyed snowmobiling in Wisconsin and loved to ride around Fisher in his golf cart.\n\nA visitation will be from10 a.m. to noon Monday at Lux Memorial Chapel, 1551 E. Grove, Rantoul.\n\nMemorials may be made to the family.\n\nThe family would like to thank Carle Hospice for their wonderful care and support.
