        "text": "The Venerable Robert A. Bryan '45 Presented with Distinguished Alumni Award\n\n\"In recognition of his impressive efforts to improve the lives of rural communities and the environment in eastern Canada and New England, in honor of his genuine dedication to making the world a better place; and in praise of his desire each day to live out Green Vale's motto, Optima Durant - the Best Endures,\" Bob Bryan received Green Vale's Distinguished Alumni Award on May 15th, 2007.\n\nIt was a wonderful day, with Bob speaking to grades five through nine in the afternoon and then again to 60 fellow alumni in the evening. Following his presentation, the group moved to the dining room for a delicious dinner (on the same old blue benches) and amusing reminiscences of former Green Vale school days.\n\nBob, his brothers Bill '36 and Jim '31, and his four sisters, Hope '33, Ruth '38, Joy '44 and Hazel '50, are all graduates of Green Vale. Since the Bryan family, only one other family has produced seven graduates. From Green Vale, Bob went on to Choate, Yale University (BA) and Yale Divinity School (M Div). In 1957 he became an Ordained Deacon of the Episcopal Church and the following year an Ordained Priest.\n\nBob was the Chaplain at Choate from 1959 to 1967, before becoming the Assistant to the Superintendent of the International Grenfell Association for three years. This organization attends to the needs of fisherman in Northern Newfoundland and on the coast of Labrador. Since 1959 he has devoted most of his life to supporting the rural communities and environment of eastern Canada and New England. He has provided \"ministry by aircraft\" to the north shore of the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Quebec. He founded and remains the Chairman of the Quebec-Labrador Foundation, Inc., Atlantic Center for the Environment. Incorporated in 1963, QLF has not only given assistance to communities who have no other source of support, but it has provided volunteer opportunities to young adults, educating them in the importance of reaching out to others as well as preserving our environment.\n\nOne of the most astounding things that the students and alumni learned while listening to Bob's talk is that when he first began to visit these remote communities he found that children were being educated only up to the second or fourth grade level. Where he settled, in Harrington Harbor, Quebec, school went only to grade eight. Largely due to Bob's efforts, children living there today are going off to college and vocational schools"
