        "text": "It breaks our hearts to announce the passing of Robert E Bryan, on 8/1/2023, at age 65. Bob passed away peacefully at home in Hilliard, OH with his loving family by his side. He was a devoted, loving husband and father who was always there when we needed him. He will be sadly missed and will always hold a place in our hearts.\n\nBob was born in Loch Haven, PA in 1958, son of the late Robert H Bryan and Eileen (Donnelly) (Bryan) Rivet, and raised in Torrance, CA. He was a 1976 graduate of West High School in Torrance, CA.\n\nRobert Bryan, CPO (SS) - US Navy (Retired), was a proud submariner. From the initial school at Naval Submarine Base New London, CT, first submarine USS Tang, then USS Atlanta, to his final submarine USS Alabama in Silverdale, WA, Bob loved the Navy, the Submarine Service, and serving his country. He finally retired in 1995 as the Navy downsized. During these years, he also earned a bachelor’s degree, and met and married Carol Lynnette Cline in 1992.\n\nAfter the Navy, they moved to Lynnette’s hometown area Hilliard, OH, to settle down. Son Ethan Robert was born soon thereafter, forever the greatest pride, joy, accomplishment, and light of his parents’ entire lives. Bob then started a second career, in civilian business admin and marketing. He worked at 21st Century Communications/West Corp/Intrado Corp for 24 years, until he retired in 2023.\n\nThroughout his life, Bob was known for his hard work, dedication, and sharing his knowledge and enthusiasm with others. He volunteered with the Boy Scouts of America for 19 years, lovingly guiding son Ethan from Tiger Cub in Pack 148 to Eagle Scout in Troop 734, plus serving in many roles at the pack, troop, district, and council levels, rangemaster, and merit badge counselor until his passing.\n\nOn his 65th birthday, as he reflected on those 65 years, Bob said his greatest joy in life was being a dad to Ethan. When his time came, he carried himself with dignity, strength, and full of love for those who went before him and those who remained behind.\n\nBob was predeceased by his parents, mother-in-law Barbara Cline, father-in-law George Cline, and sisters-in-law Janet Cline and Paula Cline.\n\nBob will be forever loved, missed and remembered by his surviving: wife of 31 years Lynnette Bryan; beloved son Ethan Bryan (Amber) of Dayton, OH; sister Diane (Darrell) Greenwald of Indio, CA; brother Thomas (Cynthia) Bryan of Torrance, CA; brother-in-law David Cline of Columbus, OH; nieces and nephews Cynthia, DJ, Kristen, Katie, and Emily; friends, and countless people whose lives he touched.\n\nAs per Bob’s request, no public funeral or memorial service will be held. He wished to be cremated, and the family has chosen a gentle water cremation, “aquamation,” arranged by Edwards Funeral Service. Then his cremains will be kept at home with his loving family. Thank you to everyone for your thoughts and prayers for Bob and the Bryan Family!\n\nIn Bob’s memory, instead of flowers, the family invites you to:\n\n1) Make a donation in his honor to Boy Scout Troop 734, and mail to 5354 Cemetery Rd, Hilliard, OH 43026\n\n2) Spend some quality bonding time in the great outdoors with your loved ones in his memory\n\n3) Please remember life is fragile and short, there is no guarantee of health or time. Enjoy every day, tell your loved ones how you feel, hug them, kiss them. Make those special family moments and memories along the way, do NOT put off until tomorrow.\n\nA submariner’s prayer:\n\nDear Heavenly Father, when we too are tired, and would prepare ourselves to slip beneath the final wave, grant that we may let loose the moorings and sink slowly into the deep waters, trusting like them, to wake with Thee. We commend into Your hands of mercy, most merciful Father, the soul of our shipmate, Chief Robert Bryan. He now sails under Your orders on his Eternal Patrol.\n\nTo Chief Robert Bryan, as you enter Eternal Deployment, may you be met with fair winds, following seas, and bright stars to set the proper course, as you report to the “Staff of the Supreme Commander.” Sailor rest your oar, may our Heavenly Father take you from this life and place you in the comfort of Eternal Peace and Rest.\n\nThere is no longer pain or suffering for Chief Robert Bryan. He is now beyond this life on earth, but his memories will be with us forever. Take comfort that he sails in the company of heroes like himself. May our nation never forget the sacrifice the submarine force has made so that we may all live in peace. AMEN"
