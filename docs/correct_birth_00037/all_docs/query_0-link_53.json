        "text": "TENNIS: Camarillo twin brothers end four-month drought without title\n\nby winning L.A. Open.\n\nThe drought is finally over.\n\nAfter coming away empty- handed in their previous eight tournament appearances, Bob and Mike Bryan turned to a familiar event to snap their winless streak.\n\nThe top-seeded Bryan brothers won their fifth L.A. Tennis Open doubles title, defeating the German tandem of Benjamin Becker and Frank Moser 6-4, 7-5 (2) Sunday afternoon at UCLA’s Straus Stadium.\n\nTheir four other L.A. titles came in 2001, ’04, ’06 and ’07. The Bryans, who were born in nearby Camarillo, extended their Los Angeles winning streak to 12 matches – all without dropping a set.\n\n“The last one feels the freshest,” Bob Bryan said. “This is definitely our most successful tournament. We have some great memories.”\n\nAs of late, tournament wins were hard to come by. It had been nearly four months since the Bryans last won a tournament, doing so at the U.S. Men’s Clay Court Championship in Houston.\n\n“We came home from Europe without a title,” Bob Bryan said. “We lost a few tough finals, so it isn’t like we weren’t knocking on the door.”\n\nThe duo lost in the semifinals in Barcelona, in the final in Rome, in the semifinals again at Roland Garros and then in the Wimbledon final.\n\n“We weren’t playing bad tennis,” Bob Bryan said. “I thought we played some of the best tennis we’ve ever played at Wimbledon.”\n\nThe Bryans, who improved to 5-3 in eight finals this season, played well to start Sunday, breaking their German counterparts in the second game. Yet Becker and Moser battled back to break the Bryans in the very next game.\n\nAfter that initial exchange, the Bryan brothers broke again in the 10th game to claim the first set.\n\nWith each team holding serve, the second set went into a tiebreak. But the Bryans eventually pulled away, taking the tiebreak 7-2 and sealing the day with their signature chest bump.\n\n“It’s the extra focus we have playing in front of all of our friends and family,” Mike Bryan said. “They are cheering on every point and kind of nudging us forward. It’s your time to show them how good you are.”\n\nNow the Bryans plan on showing the world their musical talents, releasing a pop-rock album along with a DVD documentary at the U.S. Open later this month.\n\nThey both acknowledged that it’s mostly just a fun activity, though they plan on performing on the tour.\n\nThe Bryans had plenty of on-court fun this week, becoming the first five-time winners in tournament history. The team’s success in Los Angeles already has them thinking about next summer.\n\n“It’s going to feel good coming back next year and seeing another year up on the board,” Bob Bryan said. “That means a lot to be up there five times.”"
