        "text": "FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE May 24, 2007\n\nWORLD’S NO. 1 DOUBLES TEAM, THE BRYAN BROTHERS,\n\nCOMMIT TO 81st COUNTRYWIDE CLASSIC, JULY 16-22, AT UCLA\n\nCamarillo twins have won three times on their “home court”\n\nLOS ANGELES – The five-time Grand Slam champion Southern California doubles team of Bob and Mike Bryan has committed to the 81st Countrywide Classic, July 16-22, at the Los Angeles Tennis Center-UCLA. The Bryans join two-time Los Angeles champion Tommy Haas of Germany , Chilean star Fernando Gonzalez and Scottish teen sensation Andy Murray among the early commitments.\n\n“We are delighted to have our own world champions, Bob and Mike, joining us again for the Countrywide Classic,” said Tournament Director Bob Kramer. “Their energy, prestige and success always lend a great deal of excitement to the draw.”\n\nThe Bryans , the world’s No. 1 doubles team three of the last four years, had their most match wins together (66) in 2006, when they won an ATP-high and personal best seven titles in 10 finals, including the Australian Open, Wimbledon and their third Los Angeles title (2001, 2004 and 2006). They have won at least five titles six consecutive years, including six this year. They own 39 ATP career singles titles as a team, tied for fifth on the all-time list, including five Grand Slams and seven ATP Masters Series crowns. The other Grand Slam titles were Roland Garros in 2003, the U.S. Open in 2005, and the Australian Open this year. They have won each Grand Slam event at least once. In 2005-06 they became the first team in the Open Era (since 1968) to reach the finals in seven consecutive Grand Slams. They also won seven titles in 2004, and helped the U.S. to their first Davis Cup final since 1997 by going 4-0. Their wins this year were at the Australian Open, Las Vegas , Miami , Houston , Monte Carlo and Hamburg .\n\n\"I don’t think we’re dominating like Roger (Federer),” Bob Bryan said after the twins’ Hamburg title. “That guy was losing just a couple of matches a year for the past three years. We’re just happy that we’re playing great tennis and we’re starting to find some of the form that we found last summer when we went on a long streak. We’ve been catching some breaks and we’re on a good run so far.\"\n\nStanford alums, the Bryans attract spectators with high-energy theatrics and chest-bumping celebrations. Left-hander Bob has a huge first serve and a world-class forehand while right-hander Mike has explosive returns. Off the court, Mike plays drums and Bob keyboard as part of the Bryan Bros. Band.\n\n\"We consider the Center Court at the Los Angeles Tennis Center our home court, “said Bob Bryan. “We’ve played on it so many times during our juniors and college days. It has great atmosphere and we get amazing fan support there and that’s probably why we’ve won the event three times.\"\n\nShould they win the Countrywide Classic again this year, the Bryans would become the only tandem in the event’s 81-year history to win the title four times. The only other three-time winner is the legendary duo of Lew Hoad and Ken Rosewall.\n\nThe Countrywide Classic features a 32-player singles draw and a 16-team doubles competition. The landmark Southern California ATP tournament is the longest running annual professional sporting event in Los Angeles , and offers total player compensation in excess of $1 million.\n\nFor the fourth consecutive year, the Countrywide Classic will be a part of the U.S. Open Series, the eight-week summer tennis season linking 10 major ATP and WTA Tour tournaments to the U.S. Open. Television viewership for the 2006 U.S. Open Series was a record 42 million.\n\nWith 63 tournaments in 30 countries, the ATP showcases the finest athletes competing in the world’s most exciting venues. From Australia to Europe and the Americas to Asia , the stars of the ATP Rankings and the top tandems in the Stanford ATP Doubles Race contend for prestigious titles at ATP Masters Series and other ATP tournaments. The season’s top eight singles players and doubles teams earn coveted berths at the elite Tennis Masters Cup, the circuit-ending championship held in China .
