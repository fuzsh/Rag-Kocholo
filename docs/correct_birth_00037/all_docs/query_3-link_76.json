        "text": "This park was built on the site of the former Pleasant Valley Cemetery. In the early 1940s, Mike Dizdar donated funds to relocate the cemetery and replace it with a public park. The park is now part of the Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District .\n\nThere was plenty of diagonal parking available on Glenn Drive that afternoon. The park was wide open with no fence. The chain-link fence to the right were the tennis courts for the church school and were not open to the public.\n\nThe trees inside the park were mature and provided shade where needed. A tall hedge bordered part of the park and ran next to the playground.\n\nNear a picnic table, someone had used chalk to draw a large eye on the sidewalk. A barbecue and drinking fountain were also located near this picnic table.\n\nA second picnic table was located near to busy Ventura Boulevard. The church school lay just beyond the park.\n\nA statue of the founder of Camarillo was at the southwest corner of the park. This statue of Don Adolfo Camarillo seated on a horse was installed in 2000. This park is the site for the annual July Camarillo Fiesta and Street Fair .\n\nThe park was formerly a cemetery owned by the Pleasant Valley Baptist Church. About 70 people were buried there. Most were relocated to Ivy Lawn Cemetery, and a few were reclaimed by families."
