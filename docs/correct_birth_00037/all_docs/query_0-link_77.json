        "text": "The K-Swiss Junior Tennis Camps featuring Camarillo’s Mike and Bob Bryan, Mardy Fish and Thousand Oaks High graduate Sam Querrey will take place on the campus of Cal State University Northridge this summer.\n\nThe Byran brothers, seventime Grand Slam doubles winners and the world’s top-ranked team, will highlight the first week of activity, scheduled for July 5-9.\n\nFish, of Beverly Hills, and Querrey are scheduled to attend the second week, July 12-16.\n\n“We are really excited about doing these camps,” Bob Bryan said. “Junior tennis represents the future of the game, and anything that we can do to get more kids on court is a win-win.”\n\nCal State Northridge women’s tennis coach Gary Victor will direct the camps.\n\n“The K-Swiss Junior Tennis Camp is more than just a camp or academy; it is an opportunity for some of the best players in the world, all residents of the Southern California area, to give back to the tennis community and be a part of the future growth of the game in the area,” Victor said.\n\nK-Swiss is a Southern California company headquartered in Westlake Village. K-Swiss is sponsoring the camps and continues to build its powerhouse of tennis players on the ATP Tour.\n\nThey have recently signed all four of the players participating in the camps and are also a sponsor of the upcoming Easter Bowl USTA Spring Nationals in Rancho Mirage, Calif.\n\nSaid John Tobias, president of Best Tennis, “These four players are always looking at ways to build community and work with junior players in the Southern California area. Best Tennis is proud to be connected with the camps and the K-Swiss brand.”\n\nBest and K-Swiss will be providing several scholarships to area youths to attend the weeklong camps."
