The tournament is so large it takes over virtually every tennis court in the western part of Ventura County for five days.\n\nThis year, the Bryan Brothers from Camarillo will be the tournament’s special honorees. Bob and Mike Bryan are considered to be the greatest doubles team of all time, winning 16 Grand Slam doubles titles together. The Bryans won Olympic Gold medals in 2012.\n\nThey’ll be honored at a special April 26h event which is a fundraiser for youth tennis programs, as well as for the tournament."
