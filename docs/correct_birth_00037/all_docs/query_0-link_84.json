        "text": "In the Fall of 2021, Weil Academy will be entering its 25th Year as the premier Tennis Boarding Academy in Southern California. When our doors first swung open at Weil Tennis Academy & College Preparatory School in June 1997, it was the first and only full-time Boarding School and Tennis Academy program on the entire US West Coast. Today, Mark, together with his diverse International Coaching Staff, innovative Teaching Faculty, and caring Support Staff never rest in their quest to improve their methods and deepen the positive culture here at Weil, considered by many, to be the most successful full time, high performance tennis academy in the world.\n\nRenowned Tennis Coach, Author and Speaker and Southern California Tennis Hall of Famer Wayne Bryan, Father / Coach of the greatest Men’s Doubles Team of all time, Mike and Bob Bryan, has called Weil Academy the “best academy in the world” ; his nephew Carl attended Weil full-time and he holds Clinics at Weil periodically to run his patented cavalacade of fun games. Bryan thinks it is Weil’s enthusiasm that makes him so special.\n\n“I’m a huge Mark Weil fan. He has enthusiasm, he has charisma, and is a great leader,” Bryan said. “He’s passionate about tennis, and he cares deeply about the kids. He’s honor-bound to do his best to get them a college scholarship, and improve their tennis, and take good care of them. I really admire him really as much or more than anybody in all of tennis.”\n\n“ I couldn’t hit a backhand over the net, I double faulted 24 times, I threw up before the match I was so nervous, and I lost 6-0, 6-0 in a very short time: but, something else happened…….I fell in love with tennis that day. I became a tennis player. And I couldn’t imagine anything cooler than that! So, I cried a little after the match, then stood up, gritted my teeth and vowed to the Heavens to work my butt off to get good enough to come back and beat this kid who had crushed me that day……a big chip on my shoulder was born that day and it’s motivated me my whole life to continue to improve, to get better and better in every way!,” Mark recalled.\n\nCoach Mark has fostered special relationships with many Collegiate tennis coaches like UCLA Men’s Head Coach & Southern California Tennis Hall of Famer Billy Martin and It is common for these top NCAA coaches to visit Weil Academy and get to know his players. “When I first opened, I had to beg college coaches to come to the academy and meet our terrific kids,” said Weil. “But over the years, we’ve been able to strike up unique relationships with many, many fantastic college coaches, like Coach Martin at UCLA. These College Coaches know how we prepare our players to be the Best Team Players they can be, so our students are being sought out more than ever by college coaches.”\n\nCoach Martin’s son Wil enrolled at Weil Academy for his senior year of high school. “Being a college coach for 30 years, I’ve seen a lot of kids who have come through academies,” Martin said. “I had coached players who had attended Weil and heard what a great job Mark, and Coach Mohamed and everyone has done here for many, many years. It wasn’t an easy thing to send my son away for his senior year of high school. But he was ready and really wanted to focus on his tennis and achieve his goal of playing college tennis. Our experiences with the Weil Academy have been A+, and I would highly recommend it to any parent considering sending their child to Weil to focus on his and her tennis and place them in a great college. It’s really a no-brainer, and I thank Mark so much.”\n\nMark’s dream was to play on a Division 1 college tennis team and so followed his private tennis coach, Dr Don Losman, to the University of Louisiana at Monroe, lettering as a Varsity team member for the Warhawks.\n\nDuring college, Mark discovered a love of Theater also, acted in several productions while balancing his classroom & tennis team responsibilities, and won Best Actor at ULM for 1980 for his role as the Boy in the musical production of The Fantasticks.\n\nAfter graduating college, Mark moved to New York City to enroll in a top Acting Conservatory, The Neighborhood Playhouse, where he studied with future Academy Award winner Alison Janney, and many other prominent Televison and Broadway actors, writers and Producers. Upon completing his studies at the Playhouse, Weil began coaching tennis in New York City and coached both juniors and adults at several prestigious clubs around Manhattan. But his passion for theater was also growing and so Weil founded and served as Managing Director of the Stillwater Theater Company in Manhattan for five years from 1987 to 1991. His company produced 14 American plays in five years and was a critical success."
