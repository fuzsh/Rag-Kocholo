        "text": "Jacob Bryan, 40, of Bonne Terre, passed away March 18, 2024, as a result of a house fire. He was born February 29, 1984, in Milwaukee, WI, to Robert “Bob” and Catherine (Wianecki) Bryan. Jacob fought a long and courageous fight against brain cancer since 2006, for a house fire to be his final destiny. He was told in 2009 his fight against cancer was over, but the side effects were now his battle.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his father, Robert “Bob” Wayne Bryan, Jr.; maternal grandparents, Al and Joan Wianecki; paternal grandparents, Bob and Margie Bryan; and one uncle, Shelton “Noot” Bryan.\n\nJacob is survived by his mother, Catherine “Katie” Bryan; brother, Wesley Bryan and wife Crystal; niece, Morgane Bryan; step-nephew, Robert Palacio, Jr.; aunt, Susan Bryan-Dix and husband Dave; uncles, Rick Wianecki and wife Marsha, Bill Bryan and wife Dani; several cousins and other family members also survive.\n\nThere will be a celebration of life at a later date, to honor the memory of Jacob Kyle Bryan and his father, Bob Bryan, Jr. Memorials may be directed to C.Z. Boyer and Son Funeral Home in Desloge, to help with funeral expenses."
