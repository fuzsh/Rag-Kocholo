        "text": "Hometown: Camarillo, California, USA\n\nEquipment: Blackout 300, Hyper-G\n\nCareer High Ranking: 1\n\nTeaming up with his brother Mike Bryan, Bob Bryan forms the most successful doubles partnership in the Open Era, clinching a remarkable 112 team titles. They boast an unparalleled all-time team record of 16 Grand Slam victories, achieving their historic 100th title milestone together at the 2014 US Open.\n\nThe Bryan brothers etched their names in tennis history as the sole doubles team in the Open Era to triumph in each Grand Slam tournament at least twice. Their extraordinary consistency is highlighted by securing one or more major titles in 10 consecutive seasons (2005-2014) and accomplishing the rare feat of simultaneously holding all four major titles.\n\nIn a display of sustained excellence, the dynamic duo concluded the 2014 season as the No. 1 doubles team in the world, marking their record-setting 10th time atop the rankings in a span of 12 years. Their unrivaled consistency and dominance on the court solidified their status as one of the greatest doubles teams in the history of tennis."
