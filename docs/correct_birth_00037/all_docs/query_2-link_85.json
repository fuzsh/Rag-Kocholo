        "text": "Robert Bryan, known as “Bob” by his work colleagues, was born on July 2, 1949, in Oklahoma City, OK, to Millard and Kathleen Bryan. He graduated from Harding High School and enlisted in the Navy. During his time in the Navy, he was a dental technician stationed in California. Robert married his one and only love, Linda, on December 23, 1969. At the time of his passing, they had been married 52 years.\n\nAfter the Navy, Robert went on to receive his undergraduate degree from Central State University and then his Master’s Degree in Business Administration from Oklahoma City University, all while working and raising a family. Robert and Linda moved to Guthrie in 1983, where they put down roots in the community. Robert loved the peacefulness of a small town.\n\nRobert was one to live his life by example; he taught the people in his life to be respectful, loving, and kind by the way he treated them. He wasn’t afraid to stand by the truth no matter the cost. He was a family man who gave everything to his wife, children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. He was a faithful member of the Mother of Salvation Catholic Church under Pope Gregory the XVIII at the Magnificat in Canada. He also served as President at the Life Simple Center in Guthrie, OK. He supported life and was often the clear voice of reason.\n\nRobert worked as the Director of Operations in the hospital revenue cycle for the past 30 years. He was a devoted employee and committed himself to a high standard. He was a leader at work and well respected by his peers.\n\nRobert was preceded in death by his grandson, Gavin John Bryan; parents, Millard and Kathleen Bryan; mother and father-in-law, John and Ann Darling; brother, John; and sisters, Barbara and Anne.\n\nRobert is survived by his wife, Linda; children: Bill, Chris, Erin, and Chris Christian, and Jessie; grandchildren: Trinity, Genesie, Madi and Matt Portwood, Gage, Emma, Nathan, Bella, Clark, Abby, Oliviah, Baylee, Blaise, and Cross; one great-grandson Creed with one more on the way; brothers: Allen, Joni, and Steve Bryan; countless in-laws from the Darling Family; and a whole host of nieces and nephews.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the family has asked that donations be made to The Simple Life Center, PO Box 125 Guthrie, OK 73044\n\nOh, my good judge. Mercy, mercy, mercy."
