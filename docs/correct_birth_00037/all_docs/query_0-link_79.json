        "text": "The state of California has a rich history of tennis. California has hosted multiple professional events, including the Indian Wells Open, a Southern California tournament often referred to as the “fifth major.” The state has also produced several of the most accomplished tennis players of all time, including Serena Williams, arguably the greatest ever.\n\nSerena Williams was born in Michigan but moved to Compton, California, at a young age. She turned pro in 1995 at age 14. She won the United States Open four years later, the first of 23 major singles titles, more than any other man or woman in the Open Era of tennis. She added five wins at year-end championships, five year-end №1 rankings, and 14 doubles majors with her older sister, Venus. The Williams sisters have paired for three gold medals at the Summer Olympic Games. Serena also won the gold medal in singles in 2012. She spent 319 weeks at world №1.\n\nWhile Venus Williams may not be as accomplished as her sister, she is one of the most winning players in tennis history. Born in Lynwood, California, Venus turned pro one year before her sister but did not win the first of seven singles majors until 2000, when she won both Wimbledon and the US Open. In addition to her doubles achievements with Serena, she won two mixed doubles titles and was an important part of America’s win at the 1999 Fed Cup, an international team competition. Venus spent 11 weeks as the world’s top-ranked player.\n\nPete Sampras was born in Washington, DC, and moved to Palos Verdes, California, at the age of 7, partly so that the promising young man could play tennis year-round. Sampras more than delivered on that potential: he won 14 major titles, a record at the time, and spent 286 weeks at №1, the third most of any male player as of the 2024 ATP season. Sampras also won seven titles at the year-end championships and Grand Slam Cup and helped lead the 1992 and 1995 Davis Cup teams to victory.\n\nCalifornia has also produced some of the finest doubles players of all time. Identical twins Bob and Mike Bryan, born in Camarillo, are the most successful doubles pairing of all time, winning 16 major tournaments, nearly 120 tour events, and multiple Olympic gold medals.\n\nOther accomplished tennis professionals from California include three-time major winner Tracy Austin; San Diego native Maureen “Little Mo” Connolly, the first woman to complete the calendar grand slam; and Lindsay Davenport, a Laguna Beach resident who won a combined six majors in singles and doubles competition. Davenport was the №1 singles and doubles player of the year multiple times. Oakland’s Don Budge was the first man to win the calendar grand slam. Billie Jean King, also a California native, won 12 majors in singles in addition to a staggering 27 major wins in doubles and mixed doubles. King is even better known for her off-court advocacy for equity in women’s athletics."
