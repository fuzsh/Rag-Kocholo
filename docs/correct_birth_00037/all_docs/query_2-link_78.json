        "text": "November 14, 1994: The day Martina Navratilova retired from the Tour\n\nEach day, Tennis Majors takes you back to an important moment in tennis history. On this day in 1994, Martina Navratilova played her final match on the WTA Tour before making a doubles comeback in 2000\n\nAlexandre Sokolowski\n\nNovember 14, 2023\n\nAndy Murray’s legacy: “I would be happy if it might inspire other players to never give up”\n\nI’ve always thought and written that there was the Big 4 and then everybody else. As Andy Murray heads to the Monte-Carlo Masters for the first time since 2017, does the fact that he is back to a really competitive level with a hip implant prove the case again?\n\nCarole Bouchard\n\nApril 7, 2023\n\nSave the doubles!\n\nOnce one of the pillars of the sport, the doubles game is slowly fading into oblivion. We trace its decline and what can be possibly done to revive its appeal\n\nHaresh Ramchandani\n\nDecember 28, 2022"
