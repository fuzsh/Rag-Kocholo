        "text": "Robert was born August 5, 1932, in Guymon, OK to William Jennings and Lurline Audrey (Shahan) Bryan. His siblings were William Jennings Bryan, Jr. and Eileen Audrey (Bryan) Marshall.\n\nRobert was saved as a young child and soon after joined the Guymon Nazarene Church. He was raised in a loving Christian home. He attended Guymon Public Schools and, upon graduation, enrolled in Bethany Peniel College. Here he met and married the love of his life, Dorothy (Dottie) White on August 11, 1953.\n\nIn 1956, daughter, Robyn, was born, and Stephanie joined the family 13 months later. After a brief time of living in Compton, California, the family moved to Rocky Ford to a farm owned by Dottie’s parents, Enos and Bertie White. Bob worked in the construction and roofing business and helped on the farm. David was born while the family was living on the farm, and one year later, Mark was born. The family was quickly outgrowing the 28-foot trailer home, so Bob and Dottie bought a lot and he started building the home where the family has lived since 1962. Later, Bob hired out for the Santa Fe Railway as a fireman, hostler, and, later was promoted to engineer.\n\nBob and Dottie were active members of the La Junta Nazarene Church where he worked as the church treasurer, church board member, delegate to district assemblies, and, of late served as NMI treasurer. Bob oversaw the construction of the parsonage. Later, Bob was instrumental in helping build this church building under the supervision of the general contractor, Merle Ritchie. Bob was able to take time off at the railroad and spent about 2 years helping with the church construction.\n\nBob has always had a heart for world missions. He went on 7 foreign mission trips to help on the mission fields in Ecuador, New Zealand, Kenya (twice), Nicaragua, Nova Scotia, and South Africa. Bob’s passion for serving on the mission field caught on and several of his family members were excited to join him on those ventures.\n\nBob could often be found with a grandbaby or great-grandbaby on his lap, rocking them to sleep while humming the hymn “Rock of Ages.” All of his children were a source of great joy.\n\nOne of his favorite verses in the Bible was 3 John 1:4: “I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.” He leaves behind him a faithful Christian legacy.\n\nBob is survived by his wife, Dottie; his 4 adult children and their spouses; 9 grandchildren and spouses; and 12 great-grandchildren.\n\nFuneral services will be Friday, April 14, 2023, at 10:00 a.m. at the First Church of the Nazarene with Reverend Mark Callister officiating. Interment will follow at Fairview Cemetery. Visitation will be Thursday, April 13, 2023, from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. at Peacock Memorial Chapel.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be sent in care of La Junta Church of the Nazarene for World Missions.\n\nPeacock-Larsen Funeral Home & Arkansas Valley Crematory is in charge of arrangements."
