        "text": "Thomas O'Malley is the charming and charismatic lead alley cat. He lives as a free spirit with no attachments but secretly desires to be part of a family. This role requires a strong actor, singer, and mover. He should also be comfortable flirting with the actress playing Duchess. When auditioning, mix and match your O'Malley and Duchess hopefuls into different pairs and look for the best chemistry. The success of the show largely hinges on the energy of this leading cat so cast your strongest performer in this role.\n\nDuchess is the elegant and nurturing mother of the Aristokittens. This leading role requires small group singing, but no solos, so cast your strongest actor and mover, rather than singer. Look for a mature actress who is able to convey a maternal figure. Try to audition Duchess hopefuls with O'Malleys and Aristokittens to see who works best together.\n\nEdgar is the villainous butler of Madame. He's allergic to the pampered Aristocats and secretly hates tending to them. This leading part requires one of your strongest and most mature performers with excellent acting and singing skills. Cast an actor who can portray a believable sneeze, possesses excellent comedic timing, and is unafraid to be mean.\n\nToulouse and Berlioz are Duchess's sons. Since these Aristokittens are in the majority of the scenes but require little solo singing, cast two of your stronger actors who can sing well. Toulouse yearns to be seen as tougher than he is and has a small singing solo, so cast accordingly. If possible, the Aristokittens should be physically smaller than Duchess.\n\nToulouse and Berlioz are Duchess's sons. Since these Aristokittens are in the majority of the scenes but require little solo singing, cast two of your stronger actors who can sing well. Berlioz a slightly smaller part than Toulouse and requires no solo singing. If possible, the Aristokittens should be physically smaller than Duchess.\n\nMarie is the spirited and sassy daugher of Duchess. She is the youngest child and a charmer just like her mother. Since she's in the majority of the show and has a small singing solo, cast a stronger actor rather than singer. When auditioning, mix and match Aristokitten hopefuls into different trios to see who works best together.\n\nRoquefort is the na√Øve yet ultimately brave house mouse who overcomes his fears and saves the Aristokittens from Edgar. This role requires a strong singer and character actor who can believably play innocent and frightened. If possible, cast someone physically smaller than the Alley Cats to in order emphasize his vulnerability when confronting them. Roquefort can be played by either a girl or a boy.\n\nMadame is the eccentric and kind human owner of the Aristocats who loves her pets more than anything else in the world. This small character role requires a good actor who possesses the maturity to play a maternal role. She should also be capable of delivering a short singing solo. Since Madame only appears at the beginning and end of the show, consider double casting her as an Alley Cat for the country section of the show.\n\nGeneral Napoleon and Private Lafayette are two country dogs in a comedic power struggle throughout the show. Napoleon is the power-hungry leader and Lafayette the not-so-subservient private. These roles do not require solo singing, so cast based on acting and the ability to move like a dog. Since this comic duo feeds off of each other, cast actors who can work well together. If you have a small cast, consider double casting them as Alley Cats in the opening number and for \"Ev'rybody Wants to Be a Cat.\" Napoleon and Lafayette can be played by either girls or boys.\n\nGeneral Napoleon and Private Lafayette are two country dogs in a comedic power struggle throughout the show.

These are smaller acting roles that require good movers and solid singing voices appropriate for small group singing.

These comedic characters sing a duet (but no solos), so cast solid singers and actors. It's also important for Amelia and Abby to be able to move convincingly as geese.

He or she is ultra hip and enjoys introducing the Aristocats to jazz music. Scat Cat leads the song \"Ev'rybody Want to Be a Cat\" so cast a strong singer and smooth mover. When auditioning, look for a child that's willing to go over-the-top on both movement and acting improvisations. The more creative and able to perform outside the box, the better. Scat Cat can be played by either a girl or a boy.\n\nThe Alley Cats (Hep, Mad, Slick and Wacky), although small acting parts, are the glue that holds Disney's The Aristocats KIDS together. These storytellers set up and comment on the action as well as execute the scene changes. These roles require actors with strong speaking voices who can focus onstage for long periods of time. They should also have good memories for the more complicated blocking of scene changes and transitions. Casting extra Alley Cats is a great way to use additional children you may have. Depending upon ability, they can take part in all or only some of the production numbers which call for the Alley Cats. Use some strong singers in these roles to help fill out the sound of the chorus."
