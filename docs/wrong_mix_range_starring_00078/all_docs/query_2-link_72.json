        "text": "Three Alabamians were go-to actors for Walt Disney Films. The distinctive voices of Betty Lou Gerson, Pat Buttram and George Lindsey brought characters to life in numerous animated films, from Cruella de Vil to the Sheriff of Nottingham.\n\nDisney Wikia\n\nAt times, two Alabama actors were featured in the same film. For instance, the two dog characters in \"The Aristocats,\" Napoleon and Lafayette (shown above), were voiced by Buttram and Lindsey. Let's take a look at other roles.\n\nDisney Wikia\n\nBetty Lou Gerson\n\nBetty Lou Gerson was born April 20, 1914, in Chattanooga, but was raised in Birmingham. She had small roles in a handful of feature films, including Nurse Andersone in 1958's \"The Fly,\" and the Old Crone in 1964's Mary Poppins. But Gerson, a one-time radio performer, is perhaps best known for voicing two of the most important roles in Disney film history, including Cruella de Vil in 1961's \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians,\" shown above.\n\nDisney Wikia/AL.com File Photo\n\nGerson was also the narrator in 1950's \"Cinderella.\" She died in 1999.\n\nAL.com File Photo\n\nPat Buttram\n\nPat Buttram, born June 19, 1915, in the Winston County town of Addison, parlayed his unusual voice into well-known roles in both television roles and voice work. He starred in numerous westerns and played Mr. Haney on \"Green Acres\" (1965-1971) and \"Petticoat Junction (1966).\n\nDisney Wikia/Wikimedia Commons\n\nButtram's voice work in Disney roles includes: the Sheriff of Nottingham, \"Robin Hood,\" 1973.\n\nDisney Wikia\n\nNapoleon, \"The Aristocats,\" 1970.\n\nWikimedia Commons/Disney Wikia\n\nChief in 1981's \"The Fox and the Hound.\"\n\nWikimedia Commons/Disney Wikia\n\nEmcee at Possum Park in 1995's \"A Goofy Movie.\" Buttram died in 1994.\n\nAL.com File Photo\n\nGeorge Lindsey\n\nGeorge Lindsey was born December 17, 1928, in Jasper. He was best known for his portrayal of Goober on \"The Andy Griffith Show\" (1964) and on \"Hee Haw\" (1972-1992).\n\nWikimedia Commons/Disney Wikia\n\nLindsey's voice roles in Disney films include Lafayette in 1970's \"The Aristocats.\"\n\nWikimedia Commons/Disney Wikia\n\nTrigger the Vulture in 1973's \"Robin Hood.\"\n\nWikimedia Commons/Disney Wikia\n\nDeadeye the Rabbit in 1977's \"The Rescuers.\" Lindsey died in 2012."
