        "text": "Disney’s The Aristocats KIDS, by Nelson Youth Theatre Company at the Theatre Royal, 27 September 2023.\n\nReviewed by John van Gosliga\n\n‘Everybody wants to be a cat’ was the final song in this fabulous Disney musical brought to the stage with over 50 of Nelson's up and coming actors.\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed this fun show and was blown away by the talent on stage.\n\nWithout giving too much away, the story is about a mother cat and her kittens that get cat-napped from central Paris and dropped off in the countryside and must find their way back home with the help of Thomas O’Malley cat and his entourage.\n\nI really enjoyed the stage presence, singing and acting by Duchess, played by Maia Eagle, and O’Malley, played by Tane Williams. The story had laughter, suspense and triumph and the whole cast never missed a beat.\n\nI thought Roquefort the mouse, played by Catherine Kissell, was cast well. She was both humorous and spoke well in her role.\n\nThe singing and acting were entertaining, and from the reaction of the audience it was enjoyed by everyone. All the actors on stage were animated and looked like they were having as much fun as the audience. The costumes and makeup were fantastic and the backdrop added a depth to the show.\n\nThe show runs for 45 minutes so is perfect for all ages.\n\nI can see so much potential with all the lead actors and can’t wait to see what the future holds for them. With this sort of talent in Nelson, the Nelson Youth Theatre is in great shape for years to come.\n\nThere was a full house for the opening night, and I am sure every show night will be the same. I wouldn’t wait for door sales as I am sure all shows will sell out fast."
