        "text": "It's time for some FOOOOOTBALL.\n\nNot American football, that is. I'm talking about footie. Soccer. The most popular sport in the world.\n\nThe last time the United States was a host country for the Men's World Cup was 30 years ago back in 1994.\n\nWell in 2026, the United States, Mexico, and Canada will all be host countries for the Men's World Cup.\n\nThere are many cities and big stadiums slated to host games during the 2026 World Cup. However, the big news is the big game...the championship game. THE FINAL. (I'll get there).\n\nGillette Stadium is one of the host cities, which is wildly exciting for New England soccer fans. Gillette has seven games on the calendar.\n\nThe games at Gillette that are scheduled, according to a Boston Uncovered article, are:\n\nGroup stage games at Gillette:\n\nSaturday, June 13, 2026\n\nTuesday, June 16, 2026\n\nFriday, June 19, 2026\n\nTuesday, June 23, 2026\n\nFriday, June 26, 2026\n\nSecond-round game at Gillette:\n\nMonday, June 29, 2026\n\nWorld Cup Quarterfinal at Gillette:\n\nThursday, July 9, 2026\n\nSo back to the big game, the 2026 World Cup Final. The Final will take place at New Jersey's Met Life Stadium (the home stadium for the NY Jets and the NY Giants). It is less than a four-hour drive from Boston, MA if anyone from New England plans to try and get tickets.\n\nAnd since it is the World Cup, and not American football, the turf stadium will even install a grass field in preparation for the final.\n\nIf you are curious about the other games being played in the US and other host countries, the “North American” World Cup tour will take place at 16 stadiums across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Collectively, these stadiums will host 48 teams, the most in World Cup history, according to Boston Uncovered.\n\nIt will be the biggest and most inclusive World Cup. Below are all participating stadiums:\n\nEastern US (Coast and South):\n\nGillette Stadium; Foxboro, Massachusetts (Quarterfinal)\n\nMetLife Stadium; East Rutherford, New Jersey (Final)\n\nLincoln Financial Field; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania\n\nMercedes-Benz Stadium; Atlanta, Georgia (Semifinal)\n\nHard Rock Stadium; Miami, Florida (Quarterfinal)\n\nCentral US:\n\nAT&T Stadium; Dallas (Arlington), Texas (Semifinal)\n\nNRG Stadium; Houston, Texas\n\nArrowhead Stadium; Kansas City, Kansas (Quarterfinal)\n\nWest Coast:\n\nSoFi Stadium; Los Angeles (Inglewood), California (Quarterfinal)\n\nLevi’s Stadium; San Franciso (Santa Clara), California\n\nLumen Field; Seattle, Washington\n\nMexico:\n\nEstadio Azteca; Mexico City, Mexico\n\nEstadio BBVA; Monterrey, Mexico\n\nEstadio Akron; Guadalajara, Mexico\n\nCanada:"
