She also reflects on the changing role of OTT platforms, the power of social media, and her aspirations beyond acting\n\nIn this week's Big Interview, we delve into the world of Sanya Malhotra, as she candidly shares her exhilarating journey from her cinematic debut in Dangal to her latest venture in Shah Rukh Khan's Jawan. From her remarkable experiences working alongside Bollywood legend SRK to the transformative influence of visionary director Atlee, Sanya offers valuable insights into her evolving career and the changing tastes of Indian cinema audiences. She also reflects on the changing role of OTT platforms, the power of social media, and her aspirations beyond acting. Read on to discover how SRK changed her life as well...\n\nAre you still pinching yourself after having shared screen space with Shah Rukh Khan?\n\nActually, Iâm very happy and Iâm fully enjoying it. I was pinching myself two years ago when I first started shooting for the film. But I am at a stage where I know that this is going to be a massive one. So, Iâm totally enjoying the success, and Iâm very happy to be a part of it.\n\nHow did you transform into Dr Eeram from Jawan?\n\nMukesh Chhabra called me and told me that it was a Red Chillies film starring Shah Rukh Khan, and Atlee was going to direct it. Atlee Sir wanted to meet me, so we did a Zoom call with Atlee Sir to know the story and all that. Atlee sir humbly narrated to me the whole script, but five minutes into that meeting, I had made up my mind that I wonât let go of this opportunity. That's how I got on board to play Dr. Eeram.\n\nWhat was the brief that Atlee gave to you?\n\nThere were so many things. Firstly, he told me the story, and I had my own prep. He has a very unique prep, and the tone of the film was different from what I had done by then. So, I only knew that I had to surrender and live Eeramâs life to believe that it was happening around me.\n\nWhen we were doing the flashback hospital scene, I was very fortunate that sir was giving directions not only to me but also to the actors who were playing the kids and their parents.\n\nThere was a point when Eeram entered with the oxygen cylinders. When we were shooting it, I didnât know how we would do it. I was shaken to see all the actors because they were performing so well. It is a sign of good direction. Not once did I feel that I was not in a real space with real people. That really helped me perform the way I did.\n\nAnd the confidence that Atlee sir had in me. There were times when I felt that I would not be able to do it, but Atlee sir had that confidence in me which made me feel like if my director has so much confidence in me that Iâll be able to do it, then Iâll do it.\n\nHow did you react to the doctor who tweeted that she related to your character in Jawan?\n\nFilms are a reflection of society, and it is bound that somebody will see that thereâs something that they have been through. And it is a film like that. We are seeing ourselves in the characters that are shown in Jawan. Itâs a connection that you feel as an audience.\n\nThe film sucks you in. People were dancing when \"Zinda Banda\" was playing or clapping when Deepika Padukone maâam appeared on screen. It makes you feel a part of that world. So, itâs bound that people see themselves in what we are trying to show.\n\nCan you share some memories of working with Shah Rukh Khan during Jawan?\n\nThere are many actors and people like me who get inspired by what he has to say about so many things in the world. I watch and rewatch most of his interviews, and his wisdom has given me so much knowledge and understanding of the world.\n\nIt was surreal to be around him and be so close to him, and I had so many questions. I thought that when heâs not that busy, Iâll ask him those questions. And I did get an opportunity to ask him all those questions. I think that I have a tendency to overthink. I think Iâm able to avail it, but he sensed that Iâm an overthinker. So, once he told me, âTu dimaag bohot lagati hai. Thoda dil se kaam kara kar.â And I think thatâs his mantra too. Thereâs an ease to whatever he does. Heâs not rigid. That stayed with me.\n\nSo, when I was on the Sam Bahadur set, for the first time, I was like âIâm going to be easy. Thereâs no point. This is what I love doing. Thereâs no point overthinking anything.â You just have to enjoy, and the passion and the love that he has for cinema reflects in whatever he does. Thereâs so much that you can learn from him.\n\nWhat have been your major takeaways from the experience of working with SRK?\n\nThere are so many. In acting, he was my go-to person on set. Because it is a very different space, to be honest. So, to see him gel with this world so easily was inspiring to me.\n\nHow does Shah Rukh Khan conduct himself on set?\n\nHe is so good. He is easy. Heâs talking to people as well as listening to their stories. He never went back to his vanity to chill. It was so hot outside when we were shooting for \"Zinda Banda.\" Anyone would have gotten tired, but sir did not stop. All of us girls were so excited to be dancing alongside Shah Rukh Khan. It was a pinch-me moment for everyone. I wanted to rush back to the hotel and call my mother and tell her, âMumma maine Shah Rukh sir ke saath kaam kiya, bilkul saath mein khade hokar. Itâs unbelievable.â Neither did he stop nor did he ask to change the step. He completely surrenders to the vision.\n\nAfter the success of Jawan, do you feel it would be safe to say that the audiences are back in theatres?\n\nYes. It is an exciting time for the industry and artists whether itâs theatres or OTT. The ecosystem has increased and how. Thereâs so much that we can make and experiment with content. There are some actors and directors who are getting their name and fame which was long overdue. Thanks to films like Pathaan, Jawan, and Gadar 2, people are coming back, and that charm is coming back.\n\nI couldnât stop myself from dancing at Gaiety Galaxy. It was the second time I was watching the film. The first time I watched the film with the people I couldnât have danced with, âWoh thoda zyada ho jaata.â But I couldnât stop at Gaiety Galaxy because no one was in their seats when \"Zinda Banda\" started.\n\nIt was surreal that I was in the song dancing with the girls and Shah Rukh Khan. And people in the theatre are standing and dancing with us. It is a surreal feeling. It feels like a festival. I was not watching the film as an actor. I was celebrating it.\n\nHow happy are you with your journey from Dangal to Jawan?\n\nIt has been a fulfilling journey for me as an actor. I have been part of such amazing films whether it was Dangal, Photograph, Badhaai Ho, Pataakha, Ludo, Pagglait, Meenakshi Sundareshwar, Love Hostel, Jawan, and Sam Bahadur which is going to release in December. 'Mrs' will release anytime soon.\n\nWhen I was not an actor, I used to sit by myself and imagine doing films that I am being a part of, working with actors whom I used to dream about working withâ¦ if I could sum it up Iâd say, âKisi cheez ko dil se chaaho to puri kainat ussey aapko milane ki koshish mein lag jaati hai.â It is so true in my case. As an actor thereâs nothing that I havenât got which I had truly wanted.\n\nI had given myself six months in Mumbai. It didnât happen in six months, but many people would tell me, âAbhi toh tum aayi ho. Dus-pandhrah saal toh lagenge.â So, I used to get scared. But I would say, âNo, not 10-15 years. Iâd do something before that.â I intuitively used to feel that my dreams would come true. That positivity is important and I get that from the people around me who keep me grounded and keeps me believing in myself and my dreams.\n\nItâs been seven years and I have done fifteen years worth of work but sometimes Iâm disconnected from what I am doing. I love it. The life that I am living now, I used to dream about it. So these seven years â from Dangal to Jawan have been dreamlike.\n\nAs an actor, did you feel that the authentic content will be made more for the OTT platforms and not for cinema?\n\nOTT picked up during Covid. 'Shankuntala Devi', 'Ludo', 'Pagglait', 'Meenakshi Sundarteshwar' were released when there were restrictions on going out. It was gratifying too at that time. I remember I felt so good that even though I was not ready to step out of the house, I was able to entertain the audience with my work.\n\n'Ludo' and 'Shakuntala Devi' were loved so much. 'Pagglait' kind of changed my career graph and the way the industry looked at me as an actor. So, I honestly feel that OTT has been a great catalyst and a game-changer in my career for sure.\n\nFor us, the ecosystem has increased, and so many good actors are getting to do good work whether in a web series or films. Itâs not a battle between theatres and OTT. Itâs art at the end of the day and it has to coexist. The only motive behind making a film or series is entertainment. The audience doesn't mind it at all.\n\nIs it difficult to cope with social media and all that it brings with it?\n\nI love it. Itâs such a nice way to connect with the people who are watching your films. And even if theyâre not watching your films, they like your personality on social media. If used properly, thereâs so much that you can do through social media.\n\nI honestly feel that it has really helped so many of us to promote the work that weâre doing that we might not get that easily. I like using social media. I have a different connect with the people who are watching it. There are so many people who I meet outside who say that they like watching my dance reels. Thatâs also a connection, right?\n\nCan you share any anecdotes from the filming of \"Zinda Banda\"?\n\nOn the second day of the shoot, I noticed that Shah Rukh sir had got a bruise, but he was going on and on. And I told him that he had got a bruise on his hand, and then all of us checked our hands and saw that we all had bruises. That was a bit surreal.\n\nDid you have a choice to pick which of the girl gang members you wanted to play?\n\nNo. Dr. Eeram was given to me, and that was Atlee sirâs vision which is so solid. He knew what he was making and he knew what he wanted from us as actors.\n\nPeople say that Jawan is a good blend of North and South. Do you agree?\n\nItâs Indian cinema. I would say, it describes Indian cinema. Itâs not North and South for me. It is artists coming together and creating something good.\n\nHow would you describe Atlee's process as a director?\n\nHe gives so much freedom to actors. There were times when I went to him with my suggestions, and he used to be up for it. He has a solid vision for the film, and I was grateful for that because it was such a new territory for me as an actor. He really helped me push myself out of my comfort zone. He gave us enough freedom to experiment.\n\nDid anyone tell you that your role In Jawan was short?\n\nPeople have been saying that to me since Dangal, but I donât listen to them. I know that the decisions that Iâm making in my career are landing correctly, and they will continue to land correctly. Nitesh Tiwari sir had told me during Dangal, âAs an actor, always remember that when you get a film or a character, see what you can add to the script with your acting. The length does not matter. What matters is what you add to it with your acting.â\n\nHe had told me at the Aamir Khan Productionsâ office while we were having chai and Parle G. That has stayed with me as an actor, and length has never been an issue for me to say no to a character.\n\nWhat's the next step in your life and career?\n\nThis is just the beginning. Itâs been only seven years. Thereâs a lot for me to do. Last year, I did five films. There was a time when I went from one set to another. I was hopping across studios, airports, and cities. I shot for more than 280 days in the last year. I was exhausted at that time, but I am bearing the fruits of my hard work now.\n\nDo you want to pursue ambitions other than acting? Maybe turn a producer?\n\nWhy not? I would love to. I am at a point where I have so many ideas that I would like to develop, and I am also at a position where I can develop those ideas. I have so many producers and directors who trust me as an actor, and so many of those are nice enough to take those suggestions. So, why not use this position? I would like to get into production, maybe direction too.\n\nWhat can you tell us about 'Sam Bahadur'?\n\nVicky Kaushal is a brilliant actor, and he is magic on screen as Sam Manekshaw. And I cannot wait for the audience to see it because I used to be in awe of him as an actor. He has completely transformed himself, and I am fortunate to have been directed by Meghna Gulzar maâam because she helped me find Siloo and how. There are other ways of looking at things that you think youâll be able to do, and she was the person who guided me towards Siloo. I feel very excited, and Iâm looking forward to the people watching it in December.\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nâSuhana Khan exudes effortless styleâ\n\nEntertainment\n\nBest Indian destinations for eco-friendly holidays\n\ntravel\n\nSumona Chakravarti's top stylish sarees in trendy designs\n\ntv\n\nâ10 birds with distinctively coloured beaksâ\n\nLifestyle\n\nMeena radiates elegance in vibrant yellow!\n\nEntertainment\n\n9 inspiring quotes to hang on your childâs bedroom wall\n\nLifestyle\n\nDivya Bharathi dazzles with radiant beauty\n\nEntertainment\n\nTamannaah Bhatia commands attention in a backless jersey gown\n\nLifestyle\n\nâPratibha Ranta dazzles with her radiant and timeless eleganceâ\n\nEntertainment"
