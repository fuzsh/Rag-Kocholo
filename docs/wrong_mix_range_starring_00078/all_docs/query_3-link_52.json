        "text": "For a list of the company's April Fools' Day jokes and hoaxes, see List of Google April Fools' Day jokes.\n\nThe American technology company Google has added Easter eggs into many of its products and services, such as Google Search, YouTube, and Android since at least 2000.\n\nEaster eggs are hidden features or messages that not many people know about, inside jokes, and cultural references inserted into media. They are often well hidden, so that users find it gratifying when they discover them, helping form bonds between their creators and finders. They are mostly found in video games, yet Google does make their own. Google's employees are encouraged to use 20% of their time for projects of personal interest, and Easter eggs are sometimes created during this. Google avoids adding Easter eggs to popular search pages, as they do not want to negatively impact usability.\n\nWhile unofficial and not maintained by Google themselves, elgooG contains all Google easter eggs, whether or not they have been discontinued by Google.\n\nGoogle Search\n\nFor more details, see Google Search\n\nAs Google searches are case insensitive, search terms are listed in lower case except where case sensitivity is explicitly referenced.\n\nGeneral\n\nTotal Eclipse 2024 makes an eclipse appear (also works with Solar eclipse)\n\n\"2022 FIFA World Cup \" or \"World Cup 2022 \" makes Argentina's flag appear. Argentina won the edition of the World Cup.\n\n\"Women's World Cup 2023 \" makes Spain's flag appear. Spain won that edition of the Women's World Cup.\n\n\"2/22/22 \" or \"Twosday \" would make confetti appear with number 2's and a phrase saying \"Happy Twosday 2You!\" on February 22, 2022.\n\n\"a long time ago in a galaxy far far away\" resulted in the same tilted, scrolling style that the introductions to the original Star Wars movies were presented in. This included the music, which was muted but could be heard by clicking on or selecting the muted speaker icon on the page. However, this was discontinued on June 28, 2017.\n\n\"ascii art\" showed the logo as if it was created with ASCII characters. This has been discontinued.\n\n\"askew \" causes the results page to be slightly tilted to the right. This effect once worked for the Google search of \"tilt\".\n\n\"baby yoda \", \"grogu \", \"the child \", \"the mandalorian \" or \"Din Grogu\" will bring up a Grogu (baby yoda) image button on the bottom right corner of the screen; when pressed, Grogu will use the force to pull off a result and throw it to the bottom of the screen. It is possible to press the button multiple times to remove more results.\n\n\"barbie\", \"ryan gosling\", or \" margot robbie\", shows little rose fireworks and then, the interface changes to color rose. This was made for the 2023 Barbie movie. As of 8/28/2023, this has been discontinued.\n\n\"binary\", \"hex\", \"hexadecimal\" and \"octal\" showed the number of search results in the respective numeral system. This has been discontinued.\n\n\"<blink> \", \"blink tag\", or \"blink html\" includes samples of the blink element in the results.\n\n\"Cha Cha Slide \" adds a glittering microphone next to the link to the official music video. Click it through each stage, and it will recreate the main chorus in the browser. In August 2023 this easter egg had disappeared temporarily, due to DJ Casper's passing on August 7, 2023. The easter egg has been restored.\n\n\"chicxulub \", \"chicxulub asteroid\", or \"meteorite \" will show an asteroid falling on the results page. Then, the whole page will shake slightly.\n\n\"christmas \", \"hanukkah \", and \"kwanzaa \" will show decorations next to the search bar for each respective holiday.

Each year, new decorations are shown. \"hanukkah\" changes the \"Goooo...gle\" page indicator at the bottom of every result page to show Hanukkah cakes instead of o's.\n\n\"Cricket World Cup \", \"2023 Cricket World Cup \", a minigame titled Mini Cup is shown allowing selections from the various teams participating in the 13th-edition of the Cricket World Cup, the game features batting with a tally of the teams having the highest scores.\n\n\"conway's game of life \" on a desktop browser generates a running configuration of the game to the right of the search results. The process can also be stopped and altered by the user.\n\n\"diwali \" will show a lamp which when clicked starts a lamp lighting game.\n\n\"do a barrel roll \" or \"z or r twice\" causes the result page to do a Star Fox-style barrel roll.\n\n\"drag queen\", \"gay pride \", \"homosexuality\", \"stonewall\" and other LGBTQ+-related searches, at times of gay pride festival activity, cause the results page to have a rainbow themed header.\n\n\"drop bear\n\n\"dutch angle \" shows the results page in a slightly tilted angle.\n\n\"dvd screensaver \" causes the Google logo on the top left corner of the screen to bounce around the screen, shifting colors between blue, red, yellow, and green every time it hits the page boundaries.\n\nEvery time the tab currently engaged in the Easter egg is returned to after being clicked out of, the bouncing logo will always be in a position where it hits perfectly into a corner.\n\nThis feature is disabled if a major google doodle is occurring instead of the normal google logo.\n\n\"easter \" changes the \"Goooo...gle\" page indicator at the bottom of every result page to show Easter eggs instead of o's.\n\n\"festivus \" shows an image of the Festivus pole beside the search results and the message \"A festivus miracle!\" next to the number of search results.\n\n\"fifa \" and \"world cup\", during FIFA World Cup 2010, caused the \"Goooo...gle\" page indicator at the bottom of every result page to read \"Goooo...al!\" instead.\n\n\"fireworks \", \"fourth of july\" and other search terms containing \"firework\", on US Independence Day â€“ July 4th, will display simulated multi-colored fireworks for several seconds.\n\n\"Forrest Gump \", a runner appears at the top of the screen with more runners following him as he runs.\n\nSearches related to \"Flyana Boss \" will have two female runner emojis glide across above the search.\n\n\"Friends glossary \" will show definitions for quotes in the show\n\n\"google in 1998 \" on a desktop browser will generate a layout similar to the one Google used for its search engine in 1998.\n\n\"Ghostbusters \" around October will have three ghost emojis, followed by a van emoji, glide across over the search.\n\n\"googly eyes \" will cause a pair of googly eyes to slide from the top of the page to cover each letter \"O\" in the top Google logo.

Kerning refers to the process of adjusting the space between letters in a word.\n\n\"keming \" will remove spaces between the letters of the word \"keming\". This refers to improper kerning, particularly when not enough space is used between letters, which can cause mistakes like \"kerning\" to be read as \"keming\".\n\n\"la tomatina \" will add an animation of a jumping tomato next to the summary of Tomatina. When clicked, the user can now throw tomatoes onto the website by clicking anywhere, referencing the festival. At the bottom, a button also appears to wash the thrown tomatoes off.\n\n\"lunar new year\", \"chinese new year\", or \"year of the rabbit\" caused fireworks to shoot up in the search page.

Eid Mubarak to you and your loved ones!\"\n\n\"rabbit rabbit rabbit \" shows three emojis of rabbits moving up and down at the top of the screen.\n\n\"rat czar \" causes a rat emoji and crown emoji to move across the result count area, as a reference to New York City's appointed director of rodent mitigation, referred to as the \"Rat Czar\".\n\n\"RRR\" (\"rrr \") shows an emoji of a horse rider and a person biking emoji, referencing the characters of Alluri Sitarama Raju and Komaram Bheem from the 2022 Indian film.\n\n\"solar eclipse\" near a solar eclipse shows an animation of the moon covering the sun.

The red balloons are the most common tactic that \"Pennywise the dancing clown\"/\"It\" uses to make their victims scared.

Clicking it will cause its fingers to snap, disintegrating half of the links and images on the page, as well as counting down the number of results to half. This is a reference to the 2018 film Avengers: Infinity War, in which the character Thanos destroyed half of all life in the universe with the Gauntlet on his hand by snapping his fingers. It was added in celebration of its sequel, Avengers: Endgame. Clicking the gauntlet again restores the previously disintegrated results' content.

An animation of a dog's paw pressing the button will play as you idle. Clicking on the button will cause the button to disappear, and a dog will bark as it presses down on the page and leaves a paw print in its place. Clicking anywhere else on the page will cause more dogs to bark as they leave their paw prints on the results page. Clicking on the \"X\" at the bottom will cause a water animation/effect to play with the sounds of a sink as the paw print(s) are washed off of the search results.\n\nSearching \"Best in Show\", a film about a similar dog show, activates this Easter egg as well.\n\n\"wizard of oz\" will display a pair of ruby slippers in the Knowledge Graph. Clicking on them will cause the page to spin in a tornado-like effect while an audio file of Judy Garland saying \"there's no place like home\" is heard.

Whichever is randomly selected may be opened, or the wheel may be spun again. It was added in celebration of Google's 19th birthday.\n\nCalculator\n\nIn late 2011 Google added a graphical calculator to search results, using natural language processing to determine that search results might be mathematical in nature. Woven into this feature are several, not entirely academic, results which might be considered Easter eggs.\n\nA Google web search for:\n\n\"baker's dozen \" shows the additional result \"1 baker's dozen = 13\".\n\n\"once in a blue moon \" will give the additional result of \"once in a blue moon = 1.16699016 Ã— 10âˆ’8 hertz\".\n\n\"the answer to [the ultimate question of] life the universe and everything \" provides the answer \"42\" as a result in reference to the Douglas Adams novel series, \"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\". It is believed to be the first Google Easter egg, predating the calculator in which it is now revealed.\n\n\"the number of horns on a unicorn \" shows the number \"1\" on the calculator.\n\n\"what is the loneliest number \" shows the number \"1\" in the calculator.\n\nThe result of multiple Easter eggs may be calculated; for example: \"the number of horns on a unicorn plus the answer to life the universe and everything \" will return \"43\".\n\nAhead of Pi Day 2021, Google added an Easter egg game to the calculator tool which tested players' knowledge and memory of Pi.\n\nImage search\n\nA Google image search for \"atari breakout\" or just \"breakout\" would start a game of Breakout, using the gallery of image results as bricks. Once the bricks were destroyed, a random phrase was automatically searched, the player got an extra ball, and the game restarted. The Easter egg was added in 2013 in celebration of the 37th anniversary of the original Atari game. As of May 2020 the game is no longer embedded on Google's Image Search.\n\nGoogle Maps and Google Earth\n\nFor more details, see Google Maps and Google Earth\n\nVisiting \"Salford Lads' Club\" with 3D buildings activated will show Morrissey of The Smiths at the entrance.

A yellow icon with a question mark would show up at the bottom of the directions page, next to the start navigation button. Tapping on the icon would allow the user to have Mario and his kart as the navigation arrow. Tapping the icon 100 times would activate a 1-UP sound like in Nintendo's games.\n\nExtraterrestrial\n\nWith the release of Google Earth 5, the Mars feature allowed users to speak to a primitive ELIZA clone on the planet, by searching for \"Meliza\".\n\nOn July 20, 2005, the 36th anniversary of the first human landing on the Moon, Google debuted a version of Google Maps that included a small segment of the surface of the Moon. It is based entirely on NASA images and includes only a very limited region. Panning causes the map to tile. Zooming to the closest level used to show that the Moon was made of cheese. The map also gives the locations of all Moon landings, and the Google Moon FAQ humorously mentions a connection to the Google Copernicus hoax, which Google claimed to be developing. Supposedly, by 2069, Google Local will support all lunar businesses and addresses.\n\nPegman\n\nFor more details, see Google Street View#Pegman\n\nTrigger location or occasion Pegman's appearance Reference Dragged onto Legoland in Carlsbad Lego minifigure Dragged onto Sun Valley, Idaho Skier Dragged onto the coast of Hawaii , Florida , Bali , or The GalÃ¡pagos Islands Mermaid Dragged onto Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, CA Wearing a tie-dyed shirt Dragged near the Arthur Ashe Stadium, Flushing Meadowsâ€“Corona Park Tennis player holding a racket Dragged near the Kennedy Space Center Astronaut Dragged around Groom Lake in Nevada and Area 51 UFO Dragged around the southern point of Half Moon Island, Antarctica, where Streetview is available Penguin Loch Ness Green Loch Ness Monster wearing a tartan hat Around some royal residences, such as Buckingham Palace (and the surrounding palaces), The Palace of Holyroodhouse and Hillsborough Castle A representation of Queen Elizabeth II, \"PegMa'am\".

As time went on, redditors and other interested parties experimented with translation combinations, posting their results on sites including Hacker News where reader \"iamdave\" is reported to have posted \"a pretty comprehensive Google Translate beatboxing guide\". Three years later Time magazine published an article indicating that Google had acknowledged the existence of this \"feature\" with an Easter egg \"Beatbox\" tooltip when hovering over the \"speaker icon\" button after setting everything up to the aforementioned specification.\n\nIn January 2018, a Reddit user posted a discovery that when using Google Translate to translate the Funniest Joke in the World (\"Wenn ist das NunstÃ¼ck git und Slotermeyer? Ja! Beiherhund das Oder die Flipperwaldt gersput!\") from German to English, the result was \"[FATAL ERROR]\".\n\nPast August 27, 2023, translating \"happy birthday\" and pressing enter, will rain Google-colored confetti, on the occasion of Google's 25th birthday.\n\nGoogle homepage\n\nRolling over the I'm Feeling Lucky button causes the button text to spin, landing on a random phrase.

Enjoy!\"\n\n\"www.google.com/humans.txt \" is a simple plain text file serving to remind its readers that Google is created by a large team of humans using many technologies. It asks for interested readers to visit their careers page.\n\n\"www.google.com/killer-robots.txt\" was a plain text file in robots.txt format that instructed The Terminator not to kill the company founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, but has since been removed.\n\n\"www.google.com/teapot \" states, \"418. I'm a teapot. The requested entity body is short and stout. Tip me over and pour me out.\" Clicking on the picture of the teapot or tilting the mobile device will result in an animation of it pouring tea into a teacup. The web page is a reference to the Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol.\n\nAndroid\n\nFor more details, see Android (operating system)\n\nSince the version 2.3 (Gingerbread) of Google's Android operating system an Easter egg has been hidden. The Easter egg can be accessed through the \"Settings\" application, in the \"About phone\" section, by repeatedly tapping the \"Android version\" section. The animation is different in every version of the OS.\n\nIn 2.3 â€“ 2.3.7 (Gingerbread) there is a painting of an Android next to a zombie gingerbread man, surrounded by zombies using cellphones.\n\nIn 3.0 â€“ 3.2.6 (Honeycomb) there is a blue honeybee. Below it, there is the text \"REZZZZZZZ...\" as a reference to Tron: Legacy.\n\nIn 4.0 â€“ 4.0.4 (Ice Cream Sandwich) there is pixel art of an ice cream sandwich android. Long-pressing it will result in many ice cream sandwich androids flying across the screen, dubbed the \"nyan droid\" as they are a tribute to Nyan Cat.\n\nIn 4.1 â€“ 4.3.1 (Jelly Bean) a red jelly bean appears, which if pressed will show its face along with the OS version. If this jelly bean is then long-pressed, an interactive jelly bean mini-game will appear. This is where one can fling the jelly beans around. In 4.2 and above, another minor Easter egg is included: going to System > About Phone and continuously tapping the Build number section results in a notification stating \"You are now a developer!\", which enables the Developer Options screen.\n\nIn 4.4 (KitKat) a rotating letter \"K\" appears, which if continually tapped turns into the text \"Android\" in the styling of a KitKat logo. If the Android logo is then long-pressed or twisted with two fingers a tile interface, known as \"a daydream\" called \"Dessert Case\", loads with icons from all previous versions of Android. It appears to be a mock of the Windows Phone interface.\n\nIn 5.x (Lollipop) and 6.x (Marshmallow), a colored circle appears (or a circle with a stylized M inside in Marshmallow). If continuously tapped, it will turn into a lollipop with the text lollipop inside (or the M changes into a marshmallow in 6.x). Tapping the circle changes the color. When long-pressed, a game of Flappy Bird starts with the Android mascot instead. In Marshmallow, tapping the plus sign adds extra players (up to five), which can be controlled by the user or other players.\n\nIn 7.0 (Nougat), an \"N\" appears, which will enable another Easter egg if tapped. This Easter egg, titled \"Android Neko\" as a reference to the cat collecting mobile game Neko Atsume, can be accessed from the Quick Settings menu, and allows the user to create virtual treats, which will eventually attract kittens. The kittens can be viewed in a gallery-style screen. Additionally, long-pressing on the aforementioned \"N\" repeatedly will alternate between displaying the no symbol and the cat face emojis, respectively toggling the Easter egg on and off. \"No\" and \"cat\" is a mondegreen for \"nougat\".\n\nIn 8.0 (Oreo), instead of the normal way of going to the Easter egg, heading to System > About Phone and tapping on the Android version repeatedly will launch the Easter egg. An orange circle appears, representing an \"O\" for Oreo. Long pressing on the center will open a blue screen representing a sea with an octopus floating around. The \"O\" in octopus represents Oreo while the eight legs on the octopus represent the version (8.0). The octopus can be moved by dragging the head around.\n\nIn 9.0 (Pie), the Easter egg is found by going to System > About Phone > Android version and then tapping three times on the Android version on the next screen. A white, extended \"P\" will then appear, usually with concentric colored circles disappearing into the \"P\". Each time the Easter egg is invoked, it displays different colors. The animation can be pinched to zoom.\n\nOn Google Pixel phones (that run 9.0 Pie), tapping the \"P\" icon several times will reveal a drawing app.\n\nIn 10.0, the text \"android 10\" will appear, where each of the texts \"android\", \"1\", and \"0\" can be moved and rotated. Rotating \"1\" and merging with the digit \"0\" will result in the \"android Q\" text. In this state, tapping the \"Q\" several times will reveal a Nonogram game, where the resulting pictures are various icons of Android.\n\nIn 11.0, a dial will show up. It can only go up to 10. If a user turn it to the max three times, it will go up to 11. After this is done, a virtual cat Easter egg is unlocked. This one is also called \"Android Neko\", much like the Easter egg in Nougat releases.\n\nIn 12.0 and 13.0, a clock will show up. Setting it to the 12 o'clock position (or setting it to the 13 o'clock position in 13.0) will show many circles with the colors of Material You, resembling an Ishihara color test plate. This Easter egg may trigger Trypophobia in some users, as the spots are close together. After opening the Easter egg, a widget will be added to the list of available widget which, when tapped on, shows all the colours in the Material You colour palette and tapping on one will open the share menu with details about the colour. In 13.0, If you click on many circles, you will see different emojis.\n\nIn 14.0, the \"Upside Down Cake\" logo will pop up. If held long enough, along with the vibrations, a space-based game will appear. You can pilot a ship and discover 6 planets in a system.\n\n\"Spells\" may be \"cast\" on an Android phone by saying \"Ok Google\" followed by \"Lumos\" or \"Nox\" to turn the flashlight on and off, or \"Silencio\" to silence the ringer and notifications.\n\nAndroid applications\n\nIn the Google Play Games app, if the player swipes the Konami Code, a box will appear with three buttons â€“ a B, an A and an â–º. Pressing B then A then â–º unlocks a secret achievement called \"All your game are belong to us\", a reference to the well known \"All your base are belong to us\" phrase.\n\nIn the Google Phone (Dialer) app, inputting the \"Emergency Number\" \"0118 999 881 999 119 725 3\", advertised to replace \"999\" in The IT Crowd's season 1 episode \"Calamity Jen\", will cause the phone to vibrate and the call button to flash blue and red. The feature is supported to work on stock Android Marshmallow and Android Nougat, and is still present on Oreo (8.1) devices.\n\nIn Google+, if the device is shaken while viewing a photo, snow will fall; if the device is shaken again it will save an animated GIF of the image with falling snow to the pictures directory. Note that Google+ no longer exists, as it has been replaced with a now defunct social app called Google Currents in 2019 after its shutdown.\n\nSearching for \"let's go caroling\" or \"let's go carolling\" on Google Now will result in an extra card which displays a list of Christmas carols. The phone will play the music and show the words if one of them is selected.\n\nOn YouTube Creator Studio, swiping down the screen repeatedly will show a cat at the top of the screen.\n\nEntering the tabview on the Google Chrome app and swiping up on a tab five times will cause the tab to do a backflip.\n\nOpening more than 99 tabs in the Google Chrome app will result in \":D\" shown instead of the number of opened tabs. In incognito tab it will show \";)\".\n\nTapping on the dinosaur, which is shown if the Google Chrome app is not able to connect to internet, will start Dinosaur Game.\n\nGallery\n\nGingerbread\n\nHoneycomb\n\nIce Cream Sandwich\n\nJelly Bean\n\nKitKat\n\nLollipop\n\nMarshmallow\n\nNougat\n\nOreo\n\nPie\n\nQueen Cake\n\nYouTube\n\nFor more details, see YouTube\n\nOn YouTube for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and on YouTube TV, holding rewind (left on a gamepad thumbstick, left Left or J on a keyboard) for a few seconds while at the beginning of a video, will cause an animated image of a small dog to run across the video's progress bar. This easter egg is no longer available.\n\nOn a video published by Numberphile on June 22, 2012, titled \"Why do YouTube views freeze at 301? \", the view count is intentionally frozen at 301, referencing a bug that prevented the view counter from refreshing beyond 301 views.\n\nAdding \"&wadsworth=1\" to a video URL would apply \"Wadsworth's constant\", skipping the first third of the video.\n\nWhile viewing any video, typing \"awesome\" makes the progress bar and other player elements flash multicolored. Typing \"awesome\" again stops it.\n\nYouTube's robots.txt file at \"www.youtube.com/robots.txt \" states that it was \"Created in the distant future (the year 2000) after the robotic uprising of the mid 1990s which wiped out all humans.\" This is an ostensible reference to the song \"Robots\" by Flight of the Conchords.\n\nOn December 12, 2015, in celebration of the release of Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the progress bar was changed in order to look like a Lightsaber. By signing up to a specially created page, users were able to follow the Light Side (which would change the progress bar to blue) or the Dark Side (which would change the progress bar to red). Account users had the option to return the effect to normal. Google disabled it for all users, February 1, 2016.\n\nA Snake game could be activated in the Adobe Flash player by pressing a combination of arrow keys while videos were paused or playing. Once started, the snake could be controlled by further use of the arrow keys, directing it to \"gobble up dots\" to increase its size. If the snake hit the edges of the video window, the game ended. The feature no longer works with the HTML5 video player.\n\nWhen watching a video with \"fidget spinner\" in the title, the buffering icon would change into a spinning fidget spinner. This easter egg no longer works.\n\nIn 2011, the Nyan Cat video on YouTube was updated to show a custom progress bar with an animated Nyan Cat and a rainbow trail. The custom progress bar was later removed at an unknown date.\n\nIn December 2011, a button was added that would overlay a falling snow effect over most YouTube videos.\n\nThe title for Adult Swim's Too Many Cooks short on YouTube is displayed in the same font and color as the title cards in the video are.\n\nYouTube search\n\nA YouTube search for:\n\n\"beam me up scotty\", a reference to Star Trek, would cause the search results to beam down onto the screen, as in Star Trek.\n\n\"doge meme\" changes the font on the search result page to pastel color Comic Sans typical of the Doge meme, but has since been removed\n\n\"do the harlem shake\" will cause the Harlem Shake song to play and the results to dance around.\n\n\"technoblade\" will cause a prompt to show up under the search bar, which reads: \"Did you mean: technoblade never dies\" This is in tribute to Technoblade, a popular Minecraft Youtuber who died on June 30, 2022.\n\n\"use the Force luke\" causes the results to levitate, as if by the Force mentioned in Star Wars.\n\n\"webdriver torso\" will return the results but with a red background and a blue rectangle around some videos. It also says \"aqua.flv â€“ Slide 000[0â€“9]\" at the bottom left of the page. This Easter egg is a reference to the Webdriver Torso mystery. Google has confirmed that it is behind the Webdriver Torso mystery; it is one of many test channels used by YouTube to ensure video quality.\n\nChrome\n\nFor more details, see Google Chrome\n\nIf the user tries to browse when offline, a message is shown that they are not connected to the Internet. An illustration of the \"Lonely T-Rex\" dinosaur is shown at the top, which blinks occasionally, designed by Sebastien Gabriel. From September 2014, tapping the dinosaur (in Android or iOS) or pressing space or up (on desktop) launches a browser game known as the Dinosaur Game in which the player controls a running dinosaur by tapping the screen (in Android or iOS) or pressing space, up or down (on desktop) to avoid obstacles, including cacti and, from June 2015, pterodactyls. In 2016, another feature was added to the game. When the player reaches 700 points the game begins to switch between day (white background, black lines and shapes) and night (black background, white lines and shapes). During September 2018, for Google Chrome's 10th birthday, a birthday cake causing the dinosaur to wear a birthday hat when collected was added.
