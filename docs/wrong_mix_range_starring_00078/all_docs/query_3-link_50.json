Celebrity endorsement is a widely used marketing strategy where companies hire celebrities to promote and endorse brands in advertisements. Celebrities are seen as dynamic, attractive, and likeable, and companies aim to transfer these qualities to the brands and products endorsed. Celebrities can attract attention, create brand awareness and recall, and help brands appeal to consumers by associating the brand with the celebrity's image and cultural meanings. Effective celebrity endorsement requires carefully selecting celebrities that align with the brand objectives and ensuring the endorsement delivers the intended marketing effects.",
