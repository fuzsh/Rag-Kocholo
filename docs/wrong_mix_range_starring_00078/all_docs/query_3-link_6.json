        "text": "Shah Rukh Khan is an institution in itself. Over the decades he has spent in the industry, he has given a plethora of films to his massive fan base to cherish and remember him by. His film graph shows diversity in heaps and bounds, however, he will always be the quintessential King of Romance to his fans and well-wishers. This ’90s superstar who is still busy ruling our hearts has had a few of the most loved rom-com and hard-core romantic films that are truly timeless. On that note, let us have a look at 5 of his all-time favourite and blockbuster Shah Rukh Khan Romantic movies that you must watch.\n\n1. Veer Zaara (2004)\n\n2. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998)\n\n3. Kal Ho Na Ho (2003)\n\n4. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995)\n\n5. Om Shanti Om (2007)\n\n1. Veer Zaara (2004)\n\nThis period film proved that no one does romance better than Shah Rukh Khan. His chemistry with Preity Zinta was loved by the audience and this film went onto win many accolades that year. SRK played the role of a respectable Indian army pilot named Veer in this film who loses the love of his life and gets imprisoned in Pakistan for life due to spying accusations. Preity played the role of Zaara who sacrifices her entire life believing her lover is dead. This timeless love story gave the Indian audience one of SRK’s career-best performances.\n\n2. Kuch Kuch Hota Hai (1998)\n\nThis cult classic not only made Shah Rukh the most loved romantic hero but was a huge deal for Karan Johar who debuted as a director with this film. This movie came out in the mid-’90s when SRK was unstoppable, he had well established his niche in the industry. This film further corroborated his stardom and made him a superstar beyond reach. Probably one of the most iconic love-triangles in a Bollywood rom-com, this film will always be one of a kind.\n\n3. Kal Ho Na Ho (2003)\n\nThis rom-com was infused with a little bit of tragedy. SRK played the role of a happy go lucky guy named Aman who vouches to help another guy get married to the girl they both love. Shah Rukh played the role of a dying man whose last wish is to make sure the love of his life has a loving husband and a happy life after he dies. Imbued with romance, comedy, and drama – Kal Ho Na Ho cannot be missing from this list.\n\n4. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge (1995)\n\nThere has to be some reason why this is the only movie that still brings in the countless audience at the Maratha Mandir where the screening of this film is a forever ongoing affair. DDLJ as the millennials call it is a timeless love story with the iconic pairing of Kajol and SRK in the lead. No one can help but fall in love with the ever-charming Rahul in this Aditya Chopra directorial. Shah Rukh’s character in this film still rules hearts till today and you have to watch the film till the end everytime it drops on your screens.\n\n5. Om Shanti Om (2007)\n\nThis film paved the way for the grand entry of a future superstar – Deepika Padukone. And Shah Rukh Khan made this film a thousand times more special with his enigmatic presence in it. This film showcased the power of love in all its might with the storyline of a junior actor falling in love with a superstar. This was a story of reincarnation where Shah Rukh revived the role of a modern-day superstar in the second half of the film who later on gets back his memory and decided to take revenge for the unfair death of the love of his life. With a stunning climax and a delightful cast – this movie was a grand tribute to the celebration of love."
