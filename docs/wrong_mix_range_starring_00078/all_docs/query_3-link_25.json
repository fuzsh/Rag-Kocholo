        "text": "Rating: **\n\nDirector: Rahul Dholakia\n\nCast: Shah Rukh Khan, Mahira Khan, Nawazuddin Siddiqui, Atul Kulkarni, Mohammed Zeeshan Ayyub\n\nAggressive promotions, big league stars, battle with the censor board; Rahul Dholakia's Raees' has seen it all. Being one of the most controversial films in recent times, Raees' has nothing exciting to offer, unfortunately. Guess the makers have tried hard to make a film on the famous bootlegger of Gujarat and his illegal business but ended up making a quintessential Shah Rukh Khan film instead.\n\nRaees (Shah Rukh Khan) lives a miserable life with his mom in Fatepura, Gujarat. Eventually, he starts illegal bootlegging for Jairaj (Atul Kulkarni). He grows and becomes popular in the business. Along with his best friend Sadiq (Mohammad Zeeshan), he decides to start his own business due to which he and Jairaj end up at loggerheads. Amidst all this, Raees proposes marriage to his lady love Razia (Mahira Khan).\n\nSoon after, Raees expands his business and joins hands with Musa bhai (Narendra Jha) who gives Raees a contract to kill Jairaj. IPS officer Majumdar (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is transferred to Fatehpura and is after Raees to bust his illegal bootlegging business, thus commencing their hide and seek game. Gradually, the life of infamous Raees turns upside down when he faces political bashing from the CM of the state and other political parties. And then begins a so called intriguing chase of betrayal and revenge.\n\nDirector Rahul Dholakia made an honest attempt to make a typical masala entertainment for the mass audience but gets confused between story telling and making a Shah Rukh Khan film. The film deals with too many issues like his previous film Lamhaa'. The pace of the film is slow too especially in the second half. First half holds a slight promise to offer an interesting chase but fails to impress gradually. The biggest hiccup of the film is its weak plot. Except for the hide and seek between Shah Rukh Khan and Nawaz, Raees' is a yawn fest. The narrative of the film has been uselessly complicated by giving the political angle to it. The film could have been much more thrilling and gut-wrenching. It is a typical 70's drama but in 2017, it doesn't excite much.\n\nThe reviewer wonders, what was so extraordinary about the film that along with the makers, Shah Rukh Khan himself thought to push the release date of Raees' to avoid its clash with Sultan' or Dangal'. That's not it, Raees' also created much stir with its clash with Kaabil' but to no avail.\n\nShah Rukh Khan surely steals the show in his rugged and intense character of a bootlegger. He knows the trick to survive a bad script. Nawazuddin is the master of his craft. He is a like a fresh breath of air in the film. He brings comical element which is commendable. Debutante Mahira Khan is awful. She is probably the first ever actress paired opposite Shah Rukh Khan who fails to ignite the spark with her chemistry on screen. A tinge of romance is sprinkled in the songs between the two which is soothing but songs are just fillers. Mohammad Zeeshan, Narendra Jha and Atul Kulkarni are good.\n\n'Raees' is certainly a one time watch but don't expect the unexpected at all. If you are seeking a plot with enough twists then you will be disappointed. It's just the run-of-the-mill chor-police' chase, which you must have seen infinite times in the past. Strongly recommended for Shah Rukh Khan fans.\n\nP.S. Raees' is a slightly better film than Dilwale' and Fan'.\n\nMovie Name : Raees (English : Wealthy)\n\nStarring : Shah Rukh Khan , Nawazuddin Siddiqui , Mahira Khan , Atul Kulkarni, Mohammad Zeeshan Ayyub\n\nDirector : Rahul Dholakiya\n\nProducer : Farhan Akhtar, Shah Rukh Khan, Riteish Sidhwani\n\nRating : **** (4/5)\n\nStory :\n\nThe story as we all know is set in the backdrop of 1980's Gujarat. It dwells on the life of a man called Raees (Shah Rukh Khan) who wants to make it big. His life has a simple funda which is based on his mother's teaching: Koi bhi dhandha chota nahi hota'. The movie explores the ris and fall of Raees who builds up an empire from the scratch. His philosophy in business makes him the most feared man in the state of Gujarat. Soon, situations take a drastic turn with the entry of Majmudar (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), who is on a spree to end Raees's raj. The film revolves around the epic clash between the two.\n\nRaees starts off from Raees' childhood to his adulthood to his violent yet warmth upbringing. Meanwhile this menacing Raees also has his love interest played by Pakistani beauty Mahira Khan.Raees has a golden heart and an impeccable business sense that helps him rise.\n\nPerformances :\n\nWe have seen Shah Rukh Khan do wonderful roles in the past and this one is definitely an add-on to that list. Miyan Bhai SRK stole the thunder with his power packed performance. He has nailed it this time. Last time in Fan and now in Raees SRK has shown and proved \" Form is temporary, Class is permanent \"\n\nCome to Nawaz bhai , He has too done full on justice to his role as Inspector Mujumdar.\n\nI'd mention his entry scene. It has been shot as well as acted perfectly and outstandingly.\n\nMahira looks beautiful , and has a little to do which she did nicely. Zeeshan and Atul both made their presence felt.\n\nWhat's Good :\n\nShah Rukh Khan and Nawazuddin s bravura performances, Action sequences, Well researched script, Music, Screenplay , Editing, and Climax\n\nWhat's Bad : Nothing really (as people get what they expect from Raees ) but still if I have to say something then Film gets slow for sometime in second half but it picks up later. So it hardly matters.\n\nVerdict\n\nOn the whole , Raees is a full on Masala Entertainer packed by power full performances and adrenaline charged action sequences. Made for Classes and masses alike. Action , Acting, Romance, Violence, Music and Masaledar dialogues all add up to the genre.Taking in consideration the Clash with another solid film kaabil , Raees may find it hard to hit to the fullest but it will be a sure shot Block Buster and may take big lead over kaabil.\n\nI'm going with 4 stars out of 5 ! Highly recommended !\n\nWhat's Good: Raees is a complete package of action, romance and drama. A wholesome entertainer of sorts!\n\nWhat's Bad: If you connect the story in terms of reality, then it celebrates a false hero.\n\nLoo Break: None extra needed.\n\nWatch or Not?: Raees is certainly a one-time watch. With Shah Rukh Khan in lead, many may not need me telling them to watch it. Also, Nawaz is a complete show-stealer here!\n\nUser Rating:\n\nRaees (Shah Rukh Khan) is a bright child, who early on in his school going years learns the trade of alcohol in a dry state (Gujarat). After working under a popular liquor smuggler (Atul Kulkarni) in his early years, he soon decides to start his own business.\n\nHis only rule, \"Koi dhanda chota nai hota, aur dhande se bada koi dharam nai hota, jisse kisika bura na ho.\"\n\nThanks to his tedha dimaag' this Battery (because of his spectacles) soon manages to make it to the big league. His growing success is rightly caught by Superintendent of Police Jaideep Ambalal Majmudar (Nawazuddin Siddiqui). Thus, begins a cat and mouse chase between the two.\n\nWhile Raees' street smart ways and political network work in favor, Majmudar's patience in following up with the criminal is a true laudable value.\n\nWill Majmudar be able to nail Raees? Can Raees be tamed?\n\nRaees Review\n\nRaees Review: Script Analysis\n\nRight at the start of the film, we are shown a disclaimer that the film is not based on anyone's life. I would have to agree with this decision of the censor board considering in other case, it would have been a film celebrating a real life villain.\n\nThe first half of the film takes off extremely well, with a great build up to Raees' character from his childhood and also at setting the milieu. Starting from a lighter note, we are further sucked into the twisted baniya dimaag' of Raees and also his otherwise Robinhoodesque image. That's the part that irks, it would have been a treat to watch SRK just as a gangster, we don't need the heart of gold touch.\n\nThe key element to Raees' story is to keep the audience hooked and it pretty much works here. The film shifts from politics, to romance and action seamlessly, thus keeping a Bollywood fan entertained.\n\nDialogues are completely, Deewar style and could surely get whistles blowing at most theaters. Particularly, \"Main Dharma Ka Dhanda Nai Karta\" and \"Battery Nai Bolneka\" will be major hits. Also, \"Aa raha hoon\" gets another meaning altogether in the film.\n\nScript wise, the film starts to become dull in the second half when there is too much of heroism portrayed by Raees. Also, the climax is stretched way out of hand and could have been limited.\n\nRaees Review: Star Performance\n\nShah Rukh Khan looks dreamy as Raees. His kohl eyed look suits him. Coming to the acting bits, he particularly excels in scenes where he shows extreme anger and also the one where he breaks down. Overall, he is in much better a space compared to his previous acts such as Dilwale and Happy New Year. For his fans, this one will be winner!\n\nMahira Khan's casting has been the talk of the town. Unfortunately, she does nothing special here and for all we care, any Bollywood actress could have pulled off that role. She even fails to emote appropriately in a few scenes.\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui is a star. Every scene with this man is loaded with entertainment and he is the true key to why this film is a fun watch. Loved him all through!\n\nZeeshan Ayyub is a great actor and as the sidekick, once again does his job well.\n\nAtul Kulkarni, Sheeba Chadda, Uday Tikekar put up a great supporting cast.\n\nSunny Leone sizzles in her item number Laila'.\n\nRaees Review: Direction, Music\n\nRahul Dholakia's Raees has been up for release since last year. We finally get to see it now and one can say, this is a safe bet for Shah Rukh Khan, considering its utterly commercial appeal.\n\nThe 80s setting is captured well and a good job from the production design team. Also, a special mention to the costume department for making Shah Rukh look sexy in bell bottoms.\n\nDholakia succeeds in making an entertainer that has a confluence of all elements needed to appeal a Bollywood freak. First of all, he gets Shah Rukh on board, then makes him a villain with a heart of gold, then laces it up with SRK style romance, a slow-motion action and chase sequence and lastly a dramatic climax.\n\nThe VFX on one particular chase sequence involving Shah Rukh looks shoddy. We almost see him flying off places and climbing like spider-man. The action overall too, could have been choreographed better.\n\nBackground score is good and the songs are hummable. Yet, they form as a jerk in terms of a gripping story-telling.\n\nThe run-time should have been limited to 2 hours which was easily possible with a shortened climax.\n\nRaees Review: The Last Word\n\nRaees is a paisa-wasool entertainer for massy Bollywood fans! A 3.5/5 for this one."
