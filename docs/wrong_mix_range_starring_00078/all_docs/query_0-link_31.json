        "text": "For Gucci, the year has been one extended blowout birthday bash–the attractions and ‘wow’ moments keep coming fast and thick. Whether it was the Gucci x Balenciaga hacker collection that became one of the most talked-about fashion moments in recent history, the Gucci Garden Archetypes which paid homage to 15 quintessential Gucci campaigns, or its creation of Demetra, a luxury material developed by in-house Gucci technicians, the year has had the muscle of an Olympic lifter for the Italian luxury house.\n\nThis month, on 1st July, the house celebrated another historic moment: the new home of the Gucci archive in Via delle Caldaie in Florence, housed in the 15th century Palazzo Settimanni. Located on the left bank of the river, it was once the nexus of artisan and artist workshops, which started drawing aristocrats who set up residence by the 16th century. A transformation, which, in fact mirrors itself in Gucci's stylistic codes that marry an intricacy of knowledge with inimitable refinement.\n\nThe building’s restoration, commissioned and designed by Creative Director Alessandro Michele, is very much intertwined with the larger house narrative. “Palazzo Settimanni, now free of earlier additions, is transformed into a magical place to which I have restored a sense of porousness: you pass through it, air gets in, you can walk through it as if it were a journey. I’m porous, absorbent, permeable”, explains Alessandro Michele. “I have restored to the Palazzo a fairy-tale aura which, for instance, allows the small entrance hall to become a gateway to a dream dimension. I envisaged it as a sort of secret place within the House, an inner sanctum from where one sets out for Gucci's holy lands”.\n\nThe ground floor is home to the house’s vintage handbags, small leather goods and vintage belts, an exhibition room (Swan hall), vintage and contemporary jewellery and vintage luggage. Walk onto the first floor and you'll find textile heaven–scarves and dresses–and footwear partitioned across rooms like The Alchemist's Garden, Serapis, and Aveugle par Amour. Lastly, on the second floor, we find the Façonnier des Rêves hall, with its striking wall reimagined classics like the Bamboo bag or the Jackie, in myriad versions and materials. The jewellery room, a symphony of vintage and contemporary, play with dimension and the idea of infinity through its reflective walls."
