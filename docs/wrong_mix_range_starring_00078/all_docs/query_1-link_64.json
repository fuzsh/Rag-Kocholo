        "text": "Bonjour mes amis! Throughout this project I’ve been looking at the animated features as pleasant little islands of excitement in a sea of obscure live action films. Some islands are more exciting than others, but hey, every animated feature is somebody’s favorite.\n\nDisclaimer: This blog is purely recreational and not for profit.

The opinions expressed therein reflect those of the authors and are not to be viewed as factual documentation. All photos are from Animation Screencaps unless otherwise stated.\n\nAristocats puts me in a weird spot. On its own merits, this is not top-tier Disney. Out of all the animated films, I’d rank it at the bottom-middle at best. It makes no sense, it’s got the Xerography art style I’m not a fan of, it’s not very memorable, and most of what it does has been done better in previous films. On the other hand, it’s a movie people have heard of! It’s animated! I actually know what I’m talking about kind of in Music and Artistry! It’s animated oh praise Walt, it’s animated! It’s incredible how many live action movies there are throughout these two decades, and it’s even more incredible how few of them are any good, so even a mediocre animated movie feels like a breath of fresh air.\n\nSpeaking of the 60s, that’s when The Aristocats began life. To be exact, 1961, and that means Walt was still with us to task two men named Harry Tytle and Tom McGowan with finding a good animal story to turn into a two-part miniseries on The Wonderful World of Color. So, like, another one of those weird True Life Fantasies that also has people in it but the narrator still won’t shut up. They uncovered some obscure nameless childrens’ book about a mother cat trying to find her kittens loving homes in New York City and a true story about a rich French woman who left her large fortune to her cats. Along with a third writer named Thomas Rowe, they combined these two into a draft about a greedy butler and maid named Elvira (to be voiced by Elsa Lanchester!) bumbling and fumbling in their attempts to steal a large inheritance from their mistress’s cats. The setting was changed to Paris after the London setting added so much charm to their previous animal-centric film.\n\nWhen Walt read that script in 1962, he liked it fine. Unfortunately, no one else did, so it was rejected. To appease his team, Walt suggested some unspecified changes, including removing Elvira and adding a mouse character. Rowe wasn’t happy about it, but Tytle went ahead and did as he was told. It was around this point that preparations for Mary Poppins and the 1964 World’s Fair were really starting to amp up, so between that and all the other million and one movies in the 60s, they just didn’t have the resources to focus on The Aristocats. So, in 1963, the project was shelved. However, by 1966, Jungle Book was almost finished and they needed another story to follow it up if the ailing animation department was to continue. Once again, Walt saved the day, suggesting to Ken Anderson to dust off the Aristocats project and see if they could make it an animated feature. He approved a script and some preliminary sketches and then….\n\nWe’ve seen just how badly the studio floundered following that crushing blow. They weren’t sure how or if to continue making animated films, or even making films at all. But ultimately, they asked themselves the immortal question: what would Walt do? And Walt would want them to continue. Animation built this studio. They couldn’t quit now. So they continued on pushing Aristocats down the conveyer belt as best they could. Winston Hibler (???) briefly took the lead before good old Wolfgang Reitherman decided that he could be both producer and director because he’s Wolfgang freaking Reitherman. And guys. Choices. Were. Made. Somehow, they decided it was a good idea to shift the focus of the movie from Duchess trying to get home to her loving family to the comedy of the piece, cutting the emotional center of the cats’ love for their human in favor of more slapstick. I don’t know why this surprises and infuriates me after all the boring “lighthearted” comedies where I don’t care about anyone or anything because it’s all just wackiness, but it burns me up.\n\nBut I’m getting ahead of myself. Audiences of the loved the final product, which grossed $191 million on its $4 million budget and became the most popular film of 1971 in England, Germany, and France! The comedy landed, the songs stuck in heads, and the celebrity voice actors voicing their strong characters brought in droves of fans. Marie in particular continues to be wildly popular in Japan, and that popularity carries over to the American merchandise shelves. Seriously, go on shopdisney and search Aristocats. Something like 99% of it is just Marie. What’s more marketable than a cute kitty with a pink bow? She was also set to star in one of those dreadful Disney sequels, where she would develop a crush on another kitten and stop a jewel thief aboard a cruise ship, and an animated series where she and her brothers would go on adventures with a breakdancing cat named Delancey (not to be confused with Abraham Delacey). Yes, really. Thankfully, neither of those ideas got very far.\n\nOpinions on this film seem to have cooled somewhat in more recent years, and it’s not hard to see why. I watched this movie like two hours before writing this and I still can barely remember anything that happened because it’s all so inconsequential and makes absolutely no sense from any angle. Moreover, everything it tries to do has been done better in previous films. Take a shot every time I mention Dalmatians or Lady and the Tramp in this review. Or don’t. You might die. Uptown girl/street guy romance? Lady and the Tramp. Cute animals trying to get home before somebody kills them? Dalmatians. Jazz music? The Jungle Book. It’s just so derivative. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not the worst Disney animated film and this isn’t going to be another Peter Pan situation, but it’s hard to watch this without thinking of how much better it could have been. And hey, Sword in the Stone made me think the same thing! That said, this was the last film Walt approved of, even if it changed a lot through its long production. All sources seem to say either Aristocats came out or the animation department shut down. I, for one, am very glad they went with the former. If you look at it as the film that kept the lights on, maybe this won’t be such a catastrophe.\n\nSTORY\n\nEven the credits of this movie feel like they’re ripping off Dalmatians’ unique credits, though due to budget constraints we get rough sketches in front of a colored background instead of anything truly creative. The transition’s cool, though, with Toulouse’s abstract painting melting into the establishing shot of Paris. Madame Adelaide Bonfamille rides up to her villa after a long day of being rich and French with her cats. Duchess and little Marie sit nicely to be praised for their beauty while the two male kittens, Toulouse and Berlioz, pester the driver Edgar and the horse, Frou Frou. Edgar makes a big show of helping Madame from the carriage to really hammer home what a dutiful servant he is, and she offers Frou Frou a sugar cube for her services. Or, she would if they’d bothered to draw one. Cut down to the cats who suddenly get a lot more anthropomorphic. Duchess teaches her kittens the importance of saying please and thank you, much to Frou Frou’s delight and amusement.\n\nEveryone heads inside, and Madame informs her faithful butler that she’s expecting a visit from the best character in this movie, her lawyer Georges Harcourt. This man is a mess and I love him. He zooms up in Mr. Toad’s motor car and stumbles out, belting Ta-Ra-Ra-Boom-De-Ay at the top of his voice while doing his very best impression of Dick Van Dyke as Mr. Dawes Sr. Edgar patiently puts up with his bad jokes and stubbornness and resigns himself to helping the world’s oldest man up the stairs because “elevators are for old people!”. It goes poorly. And by poorly, I mean this disaster of a human catches poor Edgar’s suspenders on his cane and catapults himself onto Edgar’s back for a piggy back ride. It’s no wonder at all that Edgar looks distinctly less put together by the time he gets Georges up to Madame’s parlor. While he was struggling, Madame was changing her clothes and Duchess’ character design (it’s not just her collar, her nose is huge in this scene) while batting off a small army of stray pencil lines.\n\nThe two old friends catch up and reminisce about the good old days when Madame was a famous opera singer and starred in Carmen. After a friendly dance and a classic “cute animal spins on the record player” gag, it’s time to get down to business. He puts on his amazing bug-eyed glasses and sits down to help Madame write her will. Edgar eavesdrops on the whole conversation through the house’s speaking tube, and the whole movie unravels. Madame has no no spouse or children or any other living relatives, so the sensible thing would be to leave her worldly possessions to Edgar. But nah, that would be ridiculous. She matter-of-factly backpedals on the implication that Edgar gets everything and says she’s going to leave everything she owns to her cats like that’s a thing normal people do. Naturally, Edgar’s a little peeved at this, but the thing is, there’s no functional difference! Pets are considered property according to most laws, so Georges shouldn’t even be entertaining this madness. Not to mention, what are cats even going to do with stocks and bonds? The most she can stipulate is that Edgar has to use X amount of money towards cat food and toys and stuff but he’d have control over the cash so what’s the difference?\n\nUgh. This plot, you guys. This plot annoyed me when I was five. I know roughly about as much about inheritance law now as I did then, but it still irks me. Anyway, Edgar somehow fails to realize that cats can’t spend money and he’d be in control of it whatever the words say. He starts panicking about how each cat, one after the other, lives nine consecutive lives, which he thinks means he doesn’t get the money until after he dies. Edgar’s terrible math would make an all right gag, but as the crux of the entire movie it’s just as infuriating as the premise of a woman leaving her fortune to four cats and expecting us to believe she’s of sound mind. Because he cannot do math, Edgar declares that he has to kill the cats so he can inherit first. Oh, wait, nope, he just wants them to go missing. What kind of cruel devil would try to kill adorable baby animals?\n\nBefore our conflict gets going, we have to see what life is like for our protagonists now. The kittens Marie, Toulouse, and Berlioz run inside, bickering about who gets to go through the cat flap first. Marie sasses them back that she should go first because she’s a lady that’s why, and the three scamper around play fighting as kittens do. Duchess slinks into the room in a different collar than she had on earlier and chides them for behaving in such an undignified way. This is the first we hear of Toulouse’s desire to be a big tough alley cat, and he pretends to be one by puffing up his fur and hissing in a bit of animation we’ll see reused at least three times throughout the movie. Even prim, proper Duchess can’t help but laugh, but there’s no time for fun and games. It’s time for the kittens’ art and music lessons. Toulouse starts off by painting a portrait of Edgar that, while not very flattering, is pretty good considering it was done by a kitten. I have to say, I’m starting to get where Madame’s money came from. She’s got cats that can paint and play piano! You could make a boatload off that! But Duchess chides him for making fun of their loving caretaker anyway.\n\nSaid loving caretaker pours an entire bottle of sleeping pills into their dinner. An entire bottle. Enough to bring down an elephant, let alone a kitten. Oh, but he’s not trying to kill them. Just put them to sleep. So now our plot doesn’t only hinge on dumb decisions and junk math, but a plot hole you could drive a semitruck through! I mean, the previous year showed a crazy woman threatening to poison, drown, or bash puppies in the head! And a lethal dose of sleeping pills doesn’t even count as an attempt to get rid of the protagonist because… reasons. I don’t like spending this long picking at plot holes, but this movie has so many glaring ones. This movie revolves around plot holes Aargh. Anyway, the kittens continue their self-improvement with some music lessons and one has to wonder if the humans hear the cats yowling and banging on the piano. Oh, and Toulouse gets paint all over the ivories. No wonder Edgar’s a bit peeved at them.\n\nThe music lesson comes to a stop when Edgar serves the kittens their favorite dinner, Crème de la Crème à la Edgar. A little mouse named Roquefort pops out with a cracker to join them for dinner, because these aristocats are much too refined for chasing mice. We spend ages oohing and aahing over how yummy it is. Suddenly, Berlioz yawns. Roquefort scampers off to grab another cracker, but he sways where he’s standing until he passes out. And okay, he should definitely be dead. There is no excuse for this. Just like there’s no excuse for the next sequence. Edgar loads the cats into a basket and drives his motorcycle through a bunch of famous Parisian landmarks, then winds up in the countryside where we meet the dogs.\n\nNapoleon and Lafayette mark the first of several Disney appearances by Western stars Pat Buttram and George Lindsay and their completely out-of-place Southern accents. It’s also the third time Woolie Reitherman has repeated the same “animal military operation” schtick and it’s not even the last. That’s a really weird fixation, you’ve got there, my dude. Actually, the dialogue here is very funny, featuring some of the witty repartee I’ve missed with the past decade’s focus on slapstick and physical comedy. As hilarious as their back and forth is, though, they have nothing to do with anything and don’t even interact with the protagonist cats. The dogs just have a real vendetta against vehicles for no real reason and they chase Edgar’s motorcycle around and around and around the farm for a solid ten minutes. The cat basket flies off the back and lands in the river, and Edgar leaves his hat, shoes, umbrella, motorcycle sidecar, and dignity with the pointless dogs.\n\nTen minutes later, it’s back to the main story. Duchess wakes up confused and frightened on the side of the river. She panics, but her biggest concern is for her kittens. She finds Marie stuck in a tree and Berlioz pulling himself out of the river, but where’s Toulouse? Oh, wait, he’s fine. At the start of this review I was going to give him credit for suspecting Edgar when no one else did, but during my second viewing I noticed he actually briefly opens his eyes before Edgar sets off on his bike! So he actually saw Edgar kidnapping them, which is an interesting touch that doesn’t really go anywhere. Mood rain starts pouring down because the cats are sad, and as they pile back into the basket they all mourn their terrible situation. The same storm wakes Madame, who goes over to the cats’ little canopy bed to comfort them. But they’re gone! She runs through the house in a panic and for once I don’t blame her, if my dog ran away I’d be pretty freaked out too. Roquefort hears her screaming for her beloved cats and throws on his raincoat and deerstalker to search for his friends. I must say, he makes a great mouse detective.\n\nThe storm passes and Duchess wakes up to a friendly voice introducing himself Jellicle Cat style, telling us his name and all about who he is to make a case why he should go to the Heaviside Layer. Or something. Abraham de Lacey Giuseppe Casey Thomas O’Malley struts his stuff and instantly snaps into flirtation mode when he sees a pretty girl cat. Duchess is wise to his sweet talking tricks, and plays coy while not-so-secretly eating it up, and the kittens watch from the basket as this homeless guy schmoozes on their mom. You know, stuff that would be super weird if they were people but they’re not so it’s fine. As charming as Thomas is, Duchess has to get home, but that just means Thomas has to change his angle. He promises to show her a whole new world on a magic carpet ride to Paris… but whoops, the pretty girl he’s trying to pick up has kids! Awkward. The kids think he literally has a magic carpet, and Duchess laughs as all Thomas’s slick lines crash around his ears. Those kids didn’t just spawn out of thin air, she’s done this a time or three and he’s not fooling anyone. It’s kind of great. She turns to go, calling her kittens behind her, but to her surprise, Thomas turns it around.\n\nThomas draws an X on the ground to mark where his magic carpet will land. Sure enough, Horace and Jasper’s van rumbles past, now painted blue and moonlighting as a milk truck. But it’s the same car. He leaps onto the hood, yowling to scare the poor milkman into stopping so the family can climb into the back. That’s his good deed for the day, so he’s content to wave his goodbyes and let them get back to Paris. But oops, Marie tumbles off the back of the truck! Because of course it’s Marie. With some more recycled Dalmatians animation, Thomas grabs her and hauls her back to her mother, and now it looks like he’s along for the ride. He offers to show them all the true beauty of life as an alley cat, but as thrilled as Toulouse is, they have to get back to Madame. She’s all alone in that big mansion, and doesn’t your heart just bleed for her? Actually, there was supposed to be a song here called She Never Felt Alone that would emphasize how much Madame and the cats needed each other, and I think developing that relationship would have done wonders for the movie. As it stands, we’re just supposed to feel bad for her as she stands stationary in the window and Duchess speaks in rhyme about the poor little rich lady. It’s Jungle Book’s relentless cheeriness all over again. Why can’t we have actual emotion anymore?\n\nBut yeah, Madame’s worried for her cats. So are Roquefort and Frou Frou, and we actually spend a little time with them fretting about how Roquefort couldn’t find their friends. Only one person in the house is cheerful: Edgar, of course, and he just can’t help gloating. Somehow, the catnapping made the front page because it’s not like there’s anything else going on in Europe in 1910. I guess when you’re as rich as Madame, you can pay the press and the police to focus on your problems. Okay, I’m kidding, it’s just a movie, but this is still some kinda storytelling. Villainous monologues aren’t uncommon, but come on, he’s just spilling his evil deeds to the good guys? That’s what you’re going with to tell your story? I know Edgar doesn’t know they can understand him but this is a really pathetic excuse for storytelling. As he blathers, Edgar suddenly realizes he left a whole bunch of his stuff at the scene of the crime. Now, none of this stuff could realistically be traced back to him in any way given the technology of the time except MAYBE the sidecar, but he freaks out anyway and declares that he just has to go and get rid of the evidence.\n\nBy now, Thomas has committed wholesale to this stepdad thing, and he promises the kittens breakfast. He goes the extra mile by pretending to do a magic trick to make it fun for them, and unveils a whole bottle of cream fresh for the taking. He’s so good with the kids that he instantly endears himself to Duchess (in case he hadn’t done that by saving Marie). While they fall in love, the milkman glances through his rearview mirror and sees a bunch of mangy animals in the milk he was trying to sell! He chases them off by throwing things at him which while understandable is kind of a jerk move. It’s the first time Duchess has encountered such cruelty from a human, but Thomas is sadly used to it. Either way, looks like they have to walk the rest of the way. Thomas leads the way across a rickety train bridge and wouldn’t you know it? The train comes! Four out of five cats hide on a rail under the track, but one falls off. No points for guessing which one!\n\nYep, Marie’s being a liability again, so Thomas dives into the river to save her. Again. He manages to toss her up to her mom, but gets caught in the current. Wait, that almost sounds like peril. We can’t have that in our lighthearted comedy! Luckily, Abigail and Amelia Gabble are here to keep things from getting too interesting. And they are infuriating. Monica Evans and Carole Shelley, whose voices we’ll also hear again, basically reprise their roles from The Odd Couple except now they’re geese, because Disney was pretty desperate to stay relevant at this point. And boy does it show. The joke about being stereotypical nosy British tourists would land a whole lot harder if half the voice cast wasn’t also British. So neither of their big gags really work in 2021, and we’re stuck listening to these two giggle vapidly while accomplishing nothing for a solid third of this movie’s runtime. Case in point: they spend a ludicrously long time figuring out that this cat they found in a river is in fact drowning and not trying to learn to swim and only when the bubbles have nearly stopped do they think to do something. It’s mildly amusing at first, but man, does the joke drag on.\n\nDuchess thanks the geese profusely for saving her new pseudo-boyfriend, and they take another solid five minutes to introduce themselves because they cannot stop giggling. Seriously, cutting all the obnoxious goose giggles would shave a solid fifteen minutes off this movie. It only finally stops when Thomas curtly informs them that he and Duchess are not, in fact married, at which point they become snotty and vicious because how dare a male and female interact without being wed? The scandal! Credit where credit is due, they don’t cast aspersions on the unwed mother in the room, but still, chill out please. To Thomas’s chagrin, the geese are also on their way to Paris to meet up with their Uncle Waldo at a fancy restaraunt, so they offer to show them the way and they all waddle down the countryside together.\n\nIt only takes those three brief encounters (the milkman, the train, and the geese) to get back to Paris, which is a whole lot less interesting than the Dalmatians’ harrowing journey, I tell you what. But the cats and geese don’t go their separate ways, they go together all the way to the restaurant to meet the geese’s Uncle Waldo who is absolutely sloshed because he’s been basted in white wine. Okay, this scene is even more utterly pointless than the dogs, but Bill Thompson’s line deliveries are classic. He’s previously been in quite a few Disney films, as Mr. Smee, The White Rabbit, and approximately half the cast of Lady and the Tramp. This was his final film before his death, and I’m gonna miss him. Even Amelia and Abigail’s laughter doesn’t get annoying because Waldo’s just such a happy drunk. Is it silly? Yeah, but it’s a whole lot more fun than the rest of the geese’s screentime.\n\nSpeaking of pointless filler, the filmmaker loved the performances of Pat Buttram and George Lindsay so incredibly much that they wrote in another scene for Napoleon and Lafayette. It wasn’t needed, it doesn’t go anywhere, and it has nothing to do with the cats’ problems, but sure, as long as you’re happy, filmmakers. You can really tell Walt wasn’t around to make sure this script stayed tight and everything served the narrative. Anyway, Edgar hops onto what’s left of his bike to retrieve all the evidence he left behind. Roquefort tries to tag along, but falls out along the way. The dogs hear his squeaky shoes and wake up for some more clever back-and-forth, then fall back asleep so Edgar can spend approximately forever trying to scratch Napoleon’s belly so he can get his hat. It’s even worse because it includes sounds I never needed to hear Pat Buttram make ever. Eventually they wake up and we spend another forever with the dogs chasing his motorcycle out of the farmyard.\n\nThe cat family files across the rooftops of Paris. They’re so close, but the kittens just can’t walk anymore. The Dalmatian puppies say ‘cry me a river’, but they’re close to an abandoned building Thomas calls his pad, so they can rest there for the night. Oh, wait, no, anachronistic Dixieland jazz music blares out the windows. Don’t you hate when your friends crash at your place when you’re not home? But Duchess gets all excited to meet Thomas’s “schvinger” friends, Scat Cat and his band of ethnic stereotypes and… okay. Guys. I usually (usually) try to keep things PG-13 on this blog, but only because I write at work. But does anyone else think the structure of this scene is a little… mm… one of those jokes that the filmmakers wrote for the parents? There’s the double meaning in the word swinger, and Duchess’s line “if you want to turn me on.” And then the party slowly builds and builds, then gets really wild and psychedelic, then mellowwwwws waaaayyyyy out. I’m not saying this Disney movie made primarily in the late ’60s would dare imply drug use, but I’m not not saying that either.\n\nThe story stops dead again but hey the song slaps and it’s the only part of this movie anyone actually remembers so I can’t be too salty unlike with the geese. Scat Cat’s gang crashes through the building and takes the party out to the streets, leaving the family to get some rest. Duchess tucks her kittens into a bed with some animation ripped directly off Figaro in Pinocchio, and heads outside for a grown-up conversation with Thomas. They both want her to stay on the streets with Thomas, but they know they can’t. Berlioz’s sad declaration of “we almost had a father” is probably the closest thing this movie ever comes to a tug of the heartstrings. It falls a little flat because the class divide isn’t illustrated nearly as starkly as in Lady and the Tramp so there’s no real reason they can’t at least see each other especially since we saw the kittens just out and about in the unfenced front yard at the beginning of the movie. Still, Frank Thomas has a real skill animating romantic scenes, and the cats holding tails in the moonlight is adorable so it’s not all bad.\n\nThe cats return to their neighborhood without further incident because there are absolutely no stakes in this movie. In the window, Roquefort tries to warn them that Edgar’s inside celebrating his victory, but the kittens think he’s jumping for joy. Meanwhile, Duchess and Thomas say their goodbyes and go their separate ways but it’s just so brief you don’t get to feel any of it. Edgar lets the cats in, but only to catch them in a sack. When Madame hears the meowing, he panics and hides them into the oven which he doesn’t turn on because again, what kind of cruel devil tries to outright kill their animal foes? I don’t condone that obviously but if you’re going to go down the road to villainy, commit to it, geez. As the butler assures Madame that she was imagining the sound of meowing, Duchess urges Roquefort to get O’Malley, who urges Roquefort to get Scat Cat and his band of ethnic stereotypes.\n\nYeah, sending the mouse after the stray cats goes about as well as you’d expect. He panics so badly that he can’t remember O’Malley’s name (how many Irish cats can there possibly be in Paris?), and the cats almost eat him. Roquefort has an adrenaline/terror-fueled moment of clarity and screams that he never should have trusted O’Malley, and the Scat Cats realize this is serious. They all rush out to the mansion to help their friend because they may be hippies but they’re good dudes all the same. Oh, and some dude sees a mouse chasing cats and decides he’s had enough to drink which is pretty funny, if a bit predictable. They make it to the mansion just in time to see Edgar finish a phone call and run out to the barn to dump the sack into a trunk addressed to Timbuktu. I don’t know how a French colony in modern day Mali (Africa) became the quintessential “really far away place” for cartoons, but here we are.\n\nAs Edgar pushes the trunk out for pickup, Thomas jumps onto his head yowling to save his girl. More slapstick ensues until Edgar pins Thomas against the wall with a pitchfork, but that mild peril doesn’t last long before the cavalry arrives in the form of Scat Cat’s band. Roquefort tries to pick the trunk’s lock while Edgar tries and fails to fight off all these cats, but all that slapstick gets very noisy and… hold on a sec, can Edgar hear Roquefort talk? What? Are we just gonna skip past that? I guess we are. So we just skip past that, Thomas gets Duchess and the kittens out of the sack, and through a series of hijinks and a well-placed kick from Frou Frou the cats lock Edgar in the trunk and he ends up on his way to Timbuktu.\n\nAll’s well that ends well. Duchess and her kittens are back home safe and sound, and Madame has a new cat! That’s right, just like the Tramp before him, Thomas gave up his free-roaming alley cat ways and settled down with the love of his life to become a loving stepdad. Georges Hartcourt is there, too, ready to alter Madame’s will, but she’s too focused on getting a family photo of her kittens. Besides, he knows what to do. As far as she knows, Edgar has disappeared without a trace, leaving all his belongings behind, and she doesn’t even look for him. She just takes him completely out of her will. That’s cold, man. But she makes another change to her will, one much more sensible than just leaving millions to her own pets. She decides that when she’s gone, her home will become a cat shelter! I can get behind that. For some reason, the humans can hear the alley cats playing jazz music and the geese, horse, and dogs return for a rousing reprise of Everybody Wants to Be a Cat.\n\nThis movie is a very mixed bag. Some of it’s entertaining, but other parts are a slog. The plot didn’t hold up to my five-year-old self’s eyes scrutiny, let alone a deep dive like this, because it’s completely nonsensical and riddled with more holes than a block of Swiss cheese. And that’s just when the movie focuses on its plot. There is an ungodly amount of filler that I can’t imagine surviving one of Walt’s story meetings, had he been around. Some of it, like the dogs or Uncle Waldo, is legitimately entertaining, but it’s still filler. And it’s a real shame, because, as we’ll see, somewhere before a lot of cuts, additions, and rewrites was a solid story. We were robbed of the storyline with Edgar and Elvira (voiced by Elsa Lanchester. Please do not forget this.) teaming up to concoct their nefarious plans to bump off the cats, and there was another plan for Duchess to search for homes for her three talented kittens. Both of these would have given this movie a direction and an urgency that the final product sorely lacks, especially when you compare it to the much more solid films that came before. As it stands, it’s more of a fluff piece than a really hard-hitting piece of cinema.\n\nCHARACTERS\n\nDuchess is introduced as a very good mom, but as the movie progresses we get to see a little more depth. Not very much, mind, but a little. She sees right through Thomas’s pickup lines and, between that and most of the big dance number, you get the idea she’s been around the block for such a spoiled and pampered housepet. The characters in this movie bear a strong resemblance to Lady and the Tramp, but Duchess is a lot less naive. That’s kind of a good thing, but I still like Lady better. Lady grows and changes throughout the story as a direct result of her relationship with Tramp, while Duchess kinda stays the same. Her voice is fantastic, though, provided by the lovely and talented Eva Gabor, one of very few actors to portray more than one lead character in a Disney animated film. Wolfgang Reitherman described her as “the freshest femme voice we’ve ever had”, which I quite agree with even though her French accent constantly slips back into her native Hungarian. Close enough, right?\n\nThomas O’Malley marks the second of three times Phil Harris plays the exact same character. The Tri-Phil-cta, if you will. Apparently, he was directed to play Thomas as more of a suave ladies’ man like Clark Gable to make him stand out from Baloo, but I don’t see it. Maybe if there were some female characters in The Jungle Book for Baloo to interact with, that difference would stand out more, but in the films we got, yeah, they’re the same cool, laid-back guy. They don’t give him the same “wrong side of the tracks” vibe Tramp had, either. Tramp was constantly struggling to survive and aware that one wrong move could land him in the pound, but the alley cat life in Aristocats looks pretty sweet, actually. So his decision to leave it behind and marry Duchess kind of feels empty. I do really enjoy his interactions with the kittens- it takes about five seconds after the initial shock wears off for him to step up and decide he’s a dad now. It’s adorable.\n\nMarie is by far the most enduring thing about this movie, which is incredible considering how incredibly annoying she is. Sure, she has two good, iconic lines towards the beginning of the movie, but what is there past that and a highly profitable design? She constantly needs rescuing, she’s stuck up and holier-than-thou, and her sole focus is on love and romance. Not exactly the best role model for little girls (especially compared to Duchess or Madame) but hey, she wears a pretty pink bow! I really liked her when I was little but I think that was just because my middle name is Marie. In the actual film, she doesn’t do all that much to stand out from her brothers… except fall off stuff, of course. Her name comes from Marie Antoinette, the last queen of France who was beheaded for her flippancy towards her destitute people which… yeah, that tracks.\n\nBerlioz’s eyebrows in this shot had me cracking up. He’s the quietest, most introverted of the kittens, but I think he’s my favorite anyway. He doesn’t have that many lines but the ones he does have as well as his facial expressions exude sass in a way Marie could never. Speaking of, his interactions with his sister and brother are the most sibling energy I have ever seen. You think this kid sits down quietly to his music lesson? Nah, he messes with his sister as long as he can. You think he’s worried when Marie falls off the bridge? Nah, he gives her a hard time. He’s a little snot and it’s adorable. As a pianist, it fits that his name comes from French composer Hector Berlioz, best known for his work Symphonie Fantastique, one of the earliest pieces of music to tell a story (in this case, the oh-so-kitten-friendly tale of a poet who descends into hallucinogenic madness for love of a woman).\n\nToulouse is a little fighty boy and I love him, too. Seriously, why is Marie the standout when the other two are so much more fun? I love Toulouse’s instant bond with Thomas and his readiness to throw down at the drop of a hat, even if his mom doesn’t. And he’s a talented painter as cats go! His voice actor, Gary Dubin, is the only child actor of the three kittens to continue his career. He played Eddie Marchand in Jaws 2 and was a frequent fixture in anime dubs before his untimely death from bone cancer in 2016. Like his brother, he takes his name from a Frenchman famous for the kitten’s favorite hobby. Henri de Toulouse-Latrec was most famous for painting the sign for the Moulin Rouge, though he frequently also painted impressionistic portraits of women.\n\nEdgar Balthazar is bar none the single worst villain in the entire Disney animated canon, and that’s coming from a die-hard Disney villain aficionado. He’s a complete failure on every possible level. His motivation is nonsensical, arguably even pitiable, his plan is weak, and his execution is pathetic. This movie is so easy to compare to Dalmatians, and poor Edgar does not come out of that matchup looking good. Cruella, he ain’t. I mean, the movie goes way out of its way to assure the viewer that he’s not trying to kill the kittens, even when two of the “obstacles” he creates- the sleeping pills and the oven- could very easily have been turned into a real threat. He’s a symptom of just how hard Disney tried to avoid anything remotely dramatic or narratively interesting throughout the late 60s and early 70s. And the thing is, he could have been so much better! Boris freaking Karloff, master of horror, was considered to do his voice, but sadly he passed away while the film was in production. His replacement, surrealist comic Roddy Maude-Roxby, does fine with the role such as it is, but the material is just so bad. Pretty much the only thing I like about him is the use of old-fashioned squash-and-stretch animation on his face.\n\nMadame Adelaide Bonfamille is the coolest crazy cat lady I’ve ever seen. I mean, it’s 1910 and she’s a female self-made multimillionaire. That’s awesome! She’s still a crazy cat lady, though. I mean, who wills their money to their pets? That is not a thing normal people do. The fact that this is based on a true story only makes it more baffling. Still, she’s just so classy that it’s hard not to admire her even if her love for her cats goes a little past the socially acceptable. Hermione Baddeley has finally found a role that isn’t a maid! She’s moving up in the world for her last Disney performance after Ellen in Mary Poppins, Mrs. Worth in The Happiest Millionaire, and Miss Chesney in Bullwhip Griffin.\n\nRoquefort tries to be useful, bless him. He just fails at almost every turn. He doesn’t find the kittens the first time he goes out to look, he falls off Edgar’s motorbike the second time… poor guy can’t catch a break. But even though he’s kind of a pointless character and Harry Tytle lamented including a mouse in the story at all, there’s something likable about him. It’s probably Sterling Holloway’s voice! That’s right, he’s back! His tenure with Disney is almost over, but his most iconic role is yet to come.\n\nScat Cat and his band represent yet another desperate effort to recapture the magic of Lady and the Tramp. Remember how almost every character in that film represented a different ethnicity, from the Scottish terrier to the Italian chefs to the Russian wolfhound? Yeah. Same deal here, but it doesn’t work as well. The characters in Lady and the Tramp (except two) had a charm to them that Scat Cat and his band just don’t have the screentime to achieve. I didn’t even realize the English, Italian, and Russian cats had lines until this watch through, and I’ve seen this movie as an adult! But they do, and their voices are provided, in order, by Lord Tim Hudson (one of the vultures in Jungle Book), Vito Scotti (Pepe in the Boatniks), and the great Thurl Ravenscroft (you know who Thurl Ravenscroft is). Yeah. They’re so unmemorable that I forgot about Thurl Ravenscroft. Also, they have names, apparently? Hit Cat, Peppo, and Billy Boss. All right then.\n\nAnd then there’s Shun Gon.\n\nFor better or worse, the best-remembered caricatures in Lady and the Tramp are the Siamese Cats. And as I mentioned in that review, Si and Am are horrible racist caricatures and they didn’t need to be. But Shun Gon is worse. Not only is he voiced by a white dude (whose name I will leave out because we all want to think of him fondly because of one of his other characters), but at least Si and Am serve the plot! They didn’t have to be Asian stereotypes, but having someone be sneaky and conniving and cruel to Lady kicks off the plot and drives her out into the world to meet Tramp. Shun Gon’s in about ten seconds of the film just to spout vaguely Chinese-sounding gibberish. It’s offensive just to be offensive, and in a movie that’s otherwise perfect to plunk small children in front of for an hour, it’s really, really jarring. This past decade or so has had a lot of extraneous anti-Asian racism and I’m sure it’s a direct result of the Vietnam War but that only makes it worse and I can’t wait until it’s over.\n\nScat Cat himself marks the second time the studio tried to bring friend of Walt’s Louis Armstrong in to do a voice. He’s even drawn like Armstrong, with a gap in his teeth and his iconic trumpet in hand. Unfortunately, Armstrong became too ill to perform and in fact passed away shortly after the film’s release. His replacement, Scatman Crouthers, was instructed to do his best impersonation of Armstrong despite being a talented actor and musician in his own right. He performs the role with a glee that makes the big song and dance number the film’s standout scene, so he can’t have been too insulted!\n\nMUSIC\n\nThis movie’s soundtrack is a wild, wild ride so bear with me because I have a lot to say. I’m convinced that a big chunk of the reason why this movie took almost ten years to make is because the soundtrack is so all over the place. For the most part, the score is pretty straightforward. Old standby George Bruns is back, filling the movie with a jazz sound straight out of The Jungle Book with a little bit of musette thrown in there for that authentic French tune. As always, there are a few standout little bits of score, notably the bouncy little theme that is the only good thing about the goose scene and I’m not just saying that because it reminds me of the chocobo music from various Final Fantasy games. One of his trademarks was to incorporate the melodies of the film’s lyrical songs throughout the score, but therein lies the problem: which songs to choose?\n\nAs Disney’s staff songwriters and all-around awesome guys, The Sherman Brothers were originally assigned to infuse this soundtrack with their signature friendly, ear-wormy sound. However, due to the many story rewrites, all but two of their songs were removed. The sleight of having all that hard work tossed out proved to be the final straw for good old Richard and Robert, and they left the studio. The Aristocats would be the final work they completed as the studio’s staff songwriters, though they completed work for a few more films that would be released after this one. They’d also work on a few songs for the theme parks, especially Epcot, and return waaaaay later in 2000. So, we’re not entirely done with the Shermans yet!\n\nDuring all those brutal cuts, we the audience lost out on not only She Never Felt Alone (which, you may have remembered, contained the film’s emotional impact), but quality songs like Pourquoi and, the biggest tragedy ever, How Much You Mean To Me/Court Me Slowly, a villainous love duet between Edgar and the cut character Elvira the maid. One, the world needs more villainous love duets just as a matter of principle. Two, do you remember who was initially slated to voice Edgar and Elvira? Boris Karloff and Elsa Lanchester were initially slated to voice Edgar and Elvira! Somewhere out there is an alternate universe where Frankenstein’s monster and his bride had a love song together and we were robbed, man. But enough about what could have been, let’s take a look at what is.\n\nThe Aristocats has a rather interesting story behind it for such a forgotten song. When they heard that the writers had set the story in Paris, the Sherman Brothers started brainstorming how to make their theme song sound as authentically French as possible. Richard Sherman had the brilliant idea of bringing back Maurice “Mr. Paris” Chevalier, who you may remember they’d previously worked with on In Search of the Castaways and Monkeys Go Home. Unfortunately, Chevalier had long since retired. Richard recorded a demo version of the song doing an impression of Chevalier and sent it to him anyway. Happily, he loved it and came out of retirement to do record one last song before his death. He even joked that he sang it in an impression of Richard’s impression of him!\n\nI’ll get into more detail about this later, but the opening song is the only thing about this movie that feels authentically French. It accomplishes what the Shermans set out to do and Chevalier is clearly having a ball with all the wordplay and gleeful gratuitous foreign language. I just think it clashes a little with the jazz in the rest of the songs and score.\n\nScales and Arpeggios has a lot of nostalgia for me that has almost nothing to do with this movie. Back when I took voice lessons as a teenager, my teacher, knowing I’m a huge Disney fan, chose this to use as a warmup exercise! So that was very sweet of her and it made me like the song a lot more that I otherwise might. The Shermans wanted it to feel like a lesson song, and they achieved that in the simple, unpolished sound. I didn’t notice this until I read this interview Entertainment Weekly did with Richard Sherman, but there are no notes in this song at all that couldn’t be reached by a kitten’s little paws– they’re all very close together on the musical scale. Those Shermans were so clever!\n\nThomas O’Malley convinced me that the title character escaped from Andrew Lloyd Weber’s abomination– I mean musical. Oh, sure, eventually he’s singing to Duchess, but when we first see him he’s just kind of introducing himself and what he’s about to the audience in much the same way the Jellicle Cats do. Ergo, he’s a Jellicle Cat and I do not take criticism at this time. Jokes aside, this is the first song that’s not written by the Sherman Brothers, though they did have a piece written for Thomas’s introduction called My Way’s The Highway where O’Malley was actually Irish. Once Phil Harris was cast, though, Terry Gilkyson returned to try to recapture the magic of Bare Necessities. It doesn’t quite get there. I’ve been quite critical of Gilkyson as a songwriter in the past and this song just adds fuel to my belief that he’s not a great lyricist (“feel the grass that’s green?”). I do really like the instrumentation of the song, though, especially the big brand brass that blares after each line of O’Malley’s name.\n\nEverybody Wants to Be a Cat is the best remembered part of this movie, and for good reason. Sorry, Shermans. Le Jazz Hot was a really fun song, but Floyd Huddleston and Al Rinker’s replacement blows it out of the water. I don’t even care that the movie stops dead for like the fourth time or that jazz wasn’t really popular in France for another decade. This song is awesome. It’s so catchy, with a lot of slinky clarinet and hyperactive piano that perfectly encapsulates what being a cat is all about, all through music. The lyrics make no sense, but hey that’s jazz, baby! Not for nothing is it a common fixture on Disney compilation albums, and it’s been covered by artists like Brian Setzer and Charles Perry. I very definitely know who these people are. Yup.\n\nARTISTRY\n\nGood Lord is this movie ugly. I’m not a big fan of the sketchy Xerography style to begin with, as necessary as it was, and it’s at its worst here. I praised the visible pencil lines in Dalmatians, but that was a much looser kind of story with a much looser, laid back vibe. Here, the sketch lines are even more prevalent, to the point where they distract enormously from the what the story tries to convey. They want us to think of class and elegance, but the bleeding colors and scraggly lines give the exact opposite impression. I don’t get Belle Epoque France from the look of this movie, I get “massive eraser shortage”.\n\nActually, why is this movie set in Belle Epoque France? I get that they were trying to recapture the atmosphere the London setting gave Dalmatians, but they missed that mark by miles. And centuries. In fact, if they wanted atmosphere, they could have accomplished that within the constraints of the Xerography technology that saved the studio by choosing a different time and place. I’m thinking specifically of 1920s New Orleans- a setting where Southern accented dogs and Dixeland jazz music would actually make sense. A city with a reputation for being both classy and a party town could let the animation be laid-back and sketchy in much the way the modern day setting of Dalmatians allowed us to see these characters as drawings come to life. It also would allow the class divide between the aristocat family and O’Malley and the Scat Cats stand out while still portraying both in a relatively positive light. Not that I want the Paris setting to go full Les Mis, but the insistence on beauty and grace hurts this film and its characters a bit.\n\nSpeaking of characters, five of Walt’s Nine Old Men spent 18 months working on character designs for this film. I was able to pick out a few of them, after all the time I’ve spent researching these men and their work. Milt Kahl’s signature head swaggle is in full force on Edgar, Ollie Johnston brings his cute, rounded style to the kittens, and as previously mentioned, Frank Thomas hasn’t lost his touch with the romantic moments even if the script doesn’t give him many to work with. As for the other two, Eric Larson and John Lounsberry are two of the less famous, lower-key names of the Nine Old Men, but Larson’s experience with animals like Figaro and Pinocchio is apparent in other kitten scenes, and Lounsberry’s sense of humor makes Georges Hartcourt a standout.\n\nI feel like the feline animation has, oddly, taken a step backwards after Jungle Book. It’s most noticable on O’Malley, who occasionally rears up on his hind legs in a way that comes off as almost… bearlike during his song. That’s not to say there isn’t some catlike behavior, especially on Duchess, but you can tell this was meant to be a cartoon more than a piece of art. It’s a shame, because they’ve definitely done better than this in the past on every level. The humans still look fine, especially in the elderly Georges’ legs and Madame’s graceful hands, but they’re not really the focus here.\n\nTHEME PARK INFLUENCE\n\nNinety-nine percent of stuff you’ll find for this movie comes in the form of Marie merchandise. However, most of the characters are meetable in some form or another. Marie is obviously the most common one, appearing in all six Disney resorts around the world (though I think she’s been retired from Florida because we can’t have nice things). Her brothers also make rare appearances in Paris and Tokyo and in Shanghai’s daytime parade, Storybook Express. I’m really not sure why Toulouse and Berlioz don’t exist over here in the states other than the aforementioned we can’t have nice things. I was surprised to find that an Edgar walkaround character exists, created specially for an event called Disney Loves Jazz at Disneyland Paris, and he looks like he’s having the time of his life. And last but not least are my sleep paralysis demons, Scat Cat and his band rendered in technicolor with truly terrifying faces. It makes sense; this film opened in December 1970 and would have still been the hot new thing when Walt Disney World opened in October 1971. But why did they have to be so creepy?\n\nAs far as attractions go, there’s nothing overt, but there are some little references if you know where to look. The various Small Worlds that include Disney characters (Toyko, Hong Kong, and California) include a little Marie figure in the France section because of course they do. The lounge at Disney’s Port Orleans Resort is calledScat Cat’s Club, which in recent years expanded to include the former dining area of a restaurant called Bonfamille’s, also after The Aristocats. Adds fuel to my theory that this movie should have taken place in New Orleans, doesn’t it? Speaking of Disney resorts, the brand new Riviera Resort contains art that represents several different Disney films that take place in and around France, including a little tribute to good old Uncle Waldo. And there are some more eats that pay homage to our feline friends: Aristocrepes in Disney Springs and the Center Street Coffee House in Tokyo Disneyland both feature art as well.\n\nFINAL THOUGHTS\n\nThe Aristocats feels more like a rough draft with potential than a finished product. The more I worked on this post, the more I found myself slipping into the same mindset I used when workshopping my peers’ short stories for the past four years of my creative writing degree. It was a weird feeling. But the fact remains that there are several simple things that could have helped the story stand on its own as more than a sad shadow of better films that came before. And they are as follows:\n\nChange the setting to New Orleans\n\nExpand the dogs’ role. Maybe they’re neighborhood dogs that know the cats and want to stop Edgar from hurting them. Maybe they smell the cats in the basket and take them out but Edgar chases them away. They’re very funny characters, they just have nothing to do with anything.\n\nBy the same token, CUT THE GEESE.\n\nMore peril, higher stakes. What makes Dalmatians’ similar plot work so much better is that we want the puppies to overcome the harsh winter conditions and escape the villain who wants their skins. The kittens… have to walk through pretty countryside or Madame will be sad. That’s it. That’s the most we’re given to care about. Maybe Madame’s making her will because she’s ill and knows she doesn’t have very long, or maybe Edgar’s hoping she’ll die of a broken heart so he’ll inherit. Yes, that’s morbid and a bit much for a Disney film, but hey, they’re not afraid of puppy skinning and I’m just throwing out ideas for the conflict this film so sorely lacks.\n\nTwo of these ideas include a third major issue. Make Edgar threatening. Give me a guy who wants these cats out of his way no matter the cost. None of this messing around with a nice little basket or miraculously not killing them with a whole bottle of sleeping pills. I want a proper Disney villain who can stand up next to Cruella without looking like a total doofus.\n\nIt just baffles me that Reitherman is the man behind such thrilling action scenes as Monstro the Whale or the Maleficent dragon, yet only one of the films he directed aspires to anything more than a fun romp. This is one of the worst of the lot, and it’s a tragedy, because it didn’t have to be that way. Give this script a few more drafts, and we could really have another classic. Maybe in the inevitable live action remake?\n\nFavorite scene: The first scene with Napoleon and Lafayette. “No, that’s mess call!” “Made a mess of it, huh?” “You can be replaced, you know.” There’s a lot of fantastic back and forth between these two and I really do love it. I just wish it had more to do with anything else that’s happening."
