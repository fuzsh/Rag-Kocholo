        "text": "Films shape and change the views those people hold about the world at large and its public in particular. The film producers have managed to lift the veil on a concealed quandary. It might be about a bias to a marginal, or the bold story of transformation by a single character, but either way, it raises consciousness about the issue at hand. (Robert Oakes, \"Movies Promoting Social Change\"). Cinema is an influential medium. It speaks with the tongue of universality. Cinema through story-telling, documentary, realism or narrative through its very nature demands a universal language. By accessing and understanding what makes a universal subject, the audiences can better connect with the world around them. Films symbolize and at the same time imply. They remix the real, the unreal, the present, real life, memory, and dream on the same-shared intellectual level. There are many factors important for a movie to leave an impact in the memory of the audience. Quality of the movie is one of those factors. It must have a forceful and persuasive storyline that can effortlessly bond with the viewers but also reveal varied issues in a clear and easy manner. Madhuri Dixit starrer ‘Hum Apke Hai Kaun' is a very apt example of this kind. ('Hum Apke Hai Kaun'.) There are many pieces of research on the role of films and their effect on the values of a human being and society to create social awareness and knowledge. Movies have a very powerful force in creating an idea and social awareness. The force is added by using glamour, sex, music, gaudy visibility and new styles are adequate to reinforce this concept. Films can be treated as a media of enjoyment in people's everyday lives. They are viewed and enjoyed by all, irrespective of class, gender, and age. It is a very powerful means to make our ideas conduct in some way or another and the impact may be both good and bad. There is a direct and quick link between films and their outreach as changing means. Most of the persons would automatically change their thoughts after viewing a film. Nobody can deny their very strapping means to transform the outlook of the society. In India, films are a popular, cheap and mainstream way of entertainment, as there was, no other popular, cheap and easy way of entertainment. Edgar Dale conducted 13 studies to prove this point. He classified movies into 10 groups after important study. Bollywood filmmakers, artists and actors claim they are the torchbearers of 'feminism' in the new-age cinema. In lectures, they advocate the woman's rights on the ground of the equality of the sexes. But in Indian films, women are treated as the toy of a man. They hardly get a good role. They are depicted very wrongly, e.g. a woman, betrayed by the lover/groom picks up a bottle of alcohol and walks the streets while an old 'Hindi' song plays in the background... In the latest development, in the films- a woman, tired of doing the daily chores in the kitchen, pulls a chair and begins to sip some wine with her husband and other 'men'. This is women empowerment and feminism of Bollywood. Such critics fail to understand the story of women's valour and their brave, harsh, radical decision. It was their choice. That was dear to their feminism. It was their power and freedom to choose. It was Padmavati's choice and free will to not give herself up to Khilji. The question about life after rape does not arise. She, out of her free will, chose to embrace the fire rather than the debauch Alauddin. It was a matter of choice and not forced upon them by their husbands! Films, ads, opinions that portray women doing things that man do is lauded and celebrated as 'feminism'. According to Bollywood films, feminism and equality are reduced to women smoking, drinking, gambling, body showing, free-sex etc on screen. It is a matter of pride that, Indian cinema has not only remained popular in India, but it has increased its boundaries elsewhere in the world. It is really encouraging to see a ‘double bottom-line' production house in India. Films are a really powerful medium in India. Now, activism has crept into Bollywood. A whole generation of young writers is growing up in the shadow, pomp and show of activism. But their approach is very negative. In the name of art, they support the cause of artists from Pakistan and anti-Hindu storyline. Such activists always try to defame the nation and malign the Hindus. Stars like Aamir Khan, Naseeruddin Shan, Javed Akhter, Shabana Azmi etc indulge such type of negative activism. Even terrorists are shown as victims. These art movies show nation and ideas in poor light. But art, real spirited art that does not hunt for easy crutches, achieves far more in the course of moving us and amusing us than activism ever does. The film ‘Newton', for instance, shows with considerable power the absurdity of democratic process in an impoverished tribal region; and that extreme uprightness in a person is actually a psychiatric condition. The film tried to depict Maowadi terrorists as victims of the system and tried to generate more sympathy for the \"Maoist terrorists\". All this discussion is enough to say that in India, the power and reach of a film have not being used in the nation building and create a positive approach about the nation nada the society. On the contrary, they create a very negative image of the nation, society, women, Hindus, Indian history and Indian society. The Government and the censor board need to tackle these issues and force the Bollywood to change. The society must understand that while judicial verdict and laws help, but the nation and any faith should not be demonized. The society's attitude towards them must change. This is an area where the people have to join the battle.\n\nThe last decade of the 20th century was very crucial for India since enormous changes happened in the political and economic sphere. These changes made a slow intrusion into the social and cultural landscape of the country as well. The two significant changes were liberalization, creating a solid impact on the Indian economy, and the Ram Janam Movement which was followed by early signs of Hindu majoritarianism and communal violence. The events were recorded by historians, journalists, and anthropologists. Filmmakers too participated in this record-keeping exercise through their available medium. In fact, the violence of the 80s and especially the 90s became a shaping force for the Bombay film industry. As Bombay bore considerable damage, the film industry couldn't act like a spectator. Instead, it chose to record and document this transformation through its medium of cinematic storytelling. It participated in this memory creation while recognizing the vitality of the visual medium. In fact, the Bombay film industry recorded these shocking waves in its own capacity. It created a new template to address these new issues through its unique ‘memory archive’. This ‘memory archive’ was not linear, a unified one, instead it was composed of multiple narratives. The present essay is an attempt to locate this ‘big change’ that entered the Bombay film industry as well as the multiple narratives that were born out of this transformation. In order to locate this departure, we need to understand the historical context of this change and see how the Bombay film industry reacted to it. How did the film industry invent a new template due to the change in its contemporary cosmos? How did it change its nature and norm and went beyond its conventional storytelling method to adapt itself? And lastly was it successful in creating a receptive audience that could resonate perfectly with this newly emerging genre?"
