        "text": "or\n\nEverybody Wants To Be A Cat\n\nContents:\n\nFilm Synopsis\n\nOriginal Text\n\nRelease Date\n\nBudget\n\nRecycled Animation\n\nCharacters & Voice Actors\n\nCreation\n\nMusic\n\nEaster Eggs\n\nAwards\n\nBits and Bobs\n\nFilm Synopsis\n\nThe Aristocats tells the story of Madame Adelaide Bonfamillie, which literally translates to ‘good family’ who creates a will and plans to leave her entire fortune to her cats, then after they pass away it would go to her butler. When the butler, Edgar, AKA animal hater, overhears this, he isn’t happy and decides to transport the cats far away. The four cats, Duchess, Marie, Berlioz and Toulouse then must find their way back to their beloved owner. Along their journey they meet many other animals who help them along their journey, most importantly, another cat, Thomas O’Malley.\n\nOriginal Text\n\nThe Aristocats was not inspired by fairy tale like most Disney films, instead it was inspired by a true story of a group of Parisian cats that inherited their owners fortune in 1910. The film is based on a story by Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, however finding any reliable information on this subject has been a lot harder than you would think so if anyone know anything, please leave the info in the comments below. Thanks\n\nSo I thought I would tell you about some real life events of people actually leaving money to their pets:\n\nTommaso was a nameless cat roaming the streets of Rome (get it? Roaming, Rome? Never mind) when he was given a home by Maria Assunta. When Assunta passed away in 2011 she gave a job to her lawyers to find a respectable animal welfare charity to give her 13 million to, along with the job of looking after her cat. I believe she did this because in Italy cats cannot inherit money.\n\nDavid Harper passed away in 2005 and he left his $1.3 million and his cat Red to the United Church of Canada, with the deal to look after his cat.\n\nWhen Dusty Springfield (British singer if you didn’t know) passed away in 1999, she stated in her will that she wanted her cat, Nicholas, aged 13 years old to be fed with American baby food, live in a tree house lined with scratch pads and catnip and that Dusty’s songs should be played to her cat every night.\n\nRelease Date:\n\nThe Aristocats was released in 1970.\n\nIt was originally going to be a live action, two part series that would be shown on The Wonderful World of Colour TV show, which is a TV show that showed cartoons and live action features and promoted films and the development of Disneyland and then Walt Disney World. However there were so many problems and they had to rewrite it so much that Walt choose to make it as an animated film.\n\nBudget\n\nInitial budget was $5million.\n\nRecycled Animation\n\nThis film, along with many others including Robin Hood and The Jungle Book, all directed by Woolie Reitherman, contains recycled animation. Recycled animation is when animators will reuse animation from previous animated films. This would happen through drawing over existing animation cells with new characters and settings but with similar movements. This process is called rotoscoping.\n\nA lot of people believe that recycled animation is done to save time and this is true, it does, but animators still need to draw the characters which takes time so this isn’t the only reason they used recycled animation. A lot of the reused animation is of dancing or two or more characters coming in contact with each other, which from an animators point of view is more tricky to do than scenes where they don’t come in contact. so if you start of with a sequence that you know works it will make it easier to make the scene work. In my opinion there is no point in coming up with a brand new sequence of moves when previous sequences can be used. Personally as long as it doesn’t seem forced, I don’t see what the problem is.\n\nCharacters and Voice Actors\n\nThe dogs Napoleon , who was voiced by Pat Buttram and Lafayette who was voiced by George Lindsey are named after war generals. This duo of voice actors would work together on The Rescuers and Robin Hood. They were created to add comedic relief to the film.\n\nSome of their barks were recycled from 101 Dalmatians during the twilight bark scene.\n\nToulouse is named after the artists and illustrator Henri de Toulouse -Lautrec and Berlioz is named after the composer Hector Berlioz. If you watch the Italian version of the film Berlioz’s name is Bizet, which is named after the French composer George Bizet.\n\nO’Malley’s appearance was based on Phil Harris who voices him. Harris also voiced Baloo in The Jungle Book.\n\nNow here comes my favourite characters fact, the famous, the one, the only Mel Blanc voiced the frog, uncredited. I have no idea if this is true seeing as it’s uncredited, but it is on his IMDB. After going back and listening to the voice of the frog, I am more impressed than ever by Mel’s talents.\n\nThe character Marie, my favourite character, has actually become very popular in Japan more so than anywhere else around the world. In 2015 a company called Kodansha teamed up with Disney and together they created a manga series called Miriya and Marie.\n\nScat Cat was originally intended to be voiced by Louis Armstrong which is why plays his trumpet like Louis plays his trumpet, however he was unable to take the role as he was ill. His replacement was Scatman Cruthers.\n\nThurl Ravenscroft was the voice of the Russian Cat (he is also the voice of Tony the Tiger from the Kelloggs Frosted Flakes ). He also did several singing pirate roles for Disneyland attraction Pirates of the Caribbean and the Enchanted Tiki Rooms as Fritz, Tangaroa, the birds.\n\nMusic\n\nThe Sherman Brothers, who worked with Disney on The Jungle Book, Mary Poppins, Sword in the Stone and many others, were in charge of the soundtrack. They also talked Maurice Chevalier who was a French singer and actor, out of retirement to sing The Aristocats, the title song of the film. This ended up being the last piece of work he ever recorded before his death in 1972 due to cardiac arrest after surgery.\n\nSome of the lines in “Ev’rybody want to be a cat” that were sung by the Chinese cat, Shun Gon were later seen as politically incorrect and had to be removed from the soundtracks. From what I can tell it is the part of the song where Shun Gon sings “Shanghai, Hong Kong, egg foo yong, fortune cookie always wrong” and he does this while playing the piano on chopstick. Some of the public also have a problem with the fact that Paul Winchell, the guy who voices him is white, American, instead of the Asian character he is voicing. However if you watch the home release and are interested in listening to the “politically incorrect” version you can. When watching this movie, an hearing Shun Gon, all I can think about is Tigger because that is who Paul has also voiced in most of the Winnie the Pooh movie.\n\nBits and Bobs\n\nThe reason why they based this film in Paris is because of two major reasons. 1) They realised how good basing 101 Dalmatians in London was for sales and guiding the style of the film, so they wanted to mirror this with The Aristocats and also 2. The original story was set in Paris. Tytle, the guy who wanted to make The Aristocats happen, actually worked directly with Tom McGowan and Tom Rowe, the original authors of the story.\n\nWalt was also the one who decided that the cats needed to be able to talk amongst themselves, but never too, or in front of humans, this is another similarity to 101 Dalmatians.\n\nIn 2005, there was a plan to make a direct-to-video sequel to be released in 2007. It was going to centre around Marie, it was also going to be in CGI, but it was cancelled in early 2006 when John Lasseter became the CEO of the company.\n\nOriginally Edgar was supposed to have a partner in crime named Elvira who was going to be the maid of Madame Adelaide, she was also going to be in love with Edgar and have “bride book” which would inform Edgar on how to court her and propose to her.\n\nIn early designs there was going to be a fourth kitten named Waterloo but they decided against keeping him in the film because they felt like there was too many.\n\nOverall Opinions, Spoilers!\n\nTo me, this film is a perfect and simple love story. I know that isn’t the main plot of the story, but this part is what I most like to focus on most. Neither Duchess or Thomas needed anyone else in their lives, I believe Duchess could have brought those kittens back home without anyone’s help, ladies can do that, but together it’s so much easier, they just seem to fit.\n\nSo your probably thinking that I would enjoy this film if Duchess and Thomas were the only main characters, no kitten involved, but you wrong, being a girl with two older brother I can understand and relate to the relationship dynamic between the siblings. I only wish I was able to command as much authority as Marie.\n\nIf there is one thing you need to remember from this film, it is this:\n\n“Ladies don’t start fights, but they can finish them.”"
