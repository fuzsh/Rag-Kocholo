        "text": "Arun Kumar better known as Atlee, started life in Tamil films as an assistant to S. Shankar in the films Enthiran (2010) and Nanban (2012). He made his directorial debut with the film Raja Rani (2013), after that, he has directed mass hits like Theri (2016), Mersal (2017) and Bigil (2019), all featuring Vijay, all of which became commercially successful at the box office and won several accolades. His latest venture, Jawan (2023), starring Shah Rukh Khan in a double role, broke all sorts of box-office records when it was released on September 7. At the time of writing this, it has grossed over 1000 crores worldwide. It has been talked about its anti-establishment stance as well. Atlee says he has always made films which have high emotional content with a social message thrown in. He’s super happy about the kind of crazy success that Jawan has been generating. There are rumours that he’s already working on the sequel. The director talks about his philosophy and more in a candid interview.\n\nIt is a massive year to be a part of Shah Rukh Khan’s filmography…\n\nYou have dealt with many sensitive topics in Jawan in a nuanced manner; was there ever a fear of backlash?\n\nDid you always wish your Bollywood directorial debut to be with Shah Rukh Khan?\n\nWhat was the last conversation you both had before the film was released on September 7?\n\nWas there ever a Plan B had Deepika said no to the role of Aishwariya?\n\nWhat did you observe about her when she was doing emotional scenes?\n\nThe biggest South and Bollywood stars have come together for the film; how was the energy on the set?\n\nWhat were your takeaways from Jawan?\n\nSpeaking of your wife, how does she balance out your life?\n\nYour child, Meer, born this year in January, must be a lucky mascot for you…\n\nAfter all the rumours that were there, do we get to see a movie where Vijay and Shah Rukh Khan come together?\n\nIt is a massive year to be a part of Shah Rukh Khan’s filmography…\n\nIt is a gift for a director when your lead star is having the best year and of course your pressure comes down and you know if you have merit in your film, you are going to fly. So, I was happy for Khan sir. I was happy for everyone who was a part of this film and I was personally also happy about that.\n\nYou have dealt with many sensitive topics in Jawan in a nuanced manner; was there ever a fear of backlash?\n\nI do this in every film of mine. As a filmmaker, you must be responsible and entertaining. It is grammar and I have learnt from Shankar and Amitabh Bachchan’s films. Every film will have a good entertainment zone along with a solid responsibility. I think I carried my film with merit and that’s why you all loved the film.\n\nDid you always wish your Bollywood directorial debut to be with Shah Rukh Khan?\n\nI have never thought that I’m going to make a Bollywood film. Shah Rukh sir said, “Let’s make a film for everyone.” It’s an Indian film. So it’s not only for Bollywood, South, West, or East; it’s for everyone. Shah Rukh sir has a good heart. He was humble and sweet to come and say to just a four-film-old director, “Can you make a film with me?” And I was surprised and speechless when he said that I’d make a difference. I was so happy, I pinched myself. The meetings continuously happened between us every now and then. He used to call me and ask, “How’s it going? No pressure, all going well?” He didn’t ask whether the script was ready or if you were thinking about it. But he was always looking to see whether I’d made the right film at that time. When I was making Bigil, he was always behind me and said that the film was coming up well. If you need any help, let me know. Finally, after finishing Bigil, I started writing. I started my love letter to Shah Rukh Khan.\n\nPlease go on…\n\nWe all know him, but being closer to him, I got to know him much better. By heart, he is simple and he knows his craft well. He knows how to make a film. He’s a serious producer. He can be extremely supportive of the director and the technician and their vision to make the film better and better. I think I was blessed to have him in my fifth film. I think my graph and ideology have improved and become better.\n\nWhat was the last conversation you both had before the film was released on September 7?\n\nWe met in the mixing studio after finalising the climax reel and we saw the film. Then we had coffee together. I said everything had come out really well, sir. The background score and everything and I think we have made our film. Now only we have to leave everything to God and we have to send our good prayers to him.\n\nWas there ever a Plan B had Deepika said no to the role of Aishwariya?\n\nI asked Pooja (Dadlani, SRK’s manager), “Can we approach Deepika for Aishwarya’s character?” She said, “Yeah, let’s speak to Shah” Then Shah Rukh sir said, “I’ve already spoken to her; she’s interested. She will do it, let her get free. Then we’ll go and narrate; if she feels merit, she will definitely do it.” And I was also happy about it. So then we flew to Hyderabad; she was shooting for Kalki 2898 AD. We went to her hotel and spoke for 2–3 hours with her.\n\nHer reaction was, “Why do you have to narrate? You don’t have to narrate it to me. I’m coming.” I told her, “No, ma’am. It is not a small character. It is the central pillar of the film and you have to know before you’re doing it.” But she said, “No, no, I will do it.” Nevertheless, she heard it. After hearing it, she said, “Oh, This is a very solid character. Oh my God.” With respect, love and in the most positive way, she came on board and I really had a fun and inspiring time working with Deepika. She’s something else.\n\nWhat did you observe about her when she was doing emotional scenes?\n\nWhen you meet her next, just observe her eyes. Eyes can speak more than dialogue. I always went for a close-up shot of her. She has great eyes and she speaks the scene through her eyes more than through dialogue. I edited a lot of her dialogue because she’s such a wonderful actor to work with. For instance, she will come near the bar in that jail scene in the film and say, “Vikram kahan hai?” Before she speaks, you can feel her anger. She aggressively asks about Vikram. She came and did it in one take. I think she has a lot of stuff within her. Any director who is going to get her, I think they are blessed. They’re going to get whatever they want onscreen through her performance.\n\nThe biggest South and Bollywood stars have come together for the film; how was the energy on the set?\n\nIndia is all about unity in diversity. It feels great when everyone comes together for one reason. So if we all come together, if we all put our energy into one zone, I think it’s going to shower a lot of goodness. When I was on my set, there were multiple people speaking multiple languages. My camera operators were from Hyderabad, so they spoke in Telugu. Our team speaks Tamil. The art department speaks Malayalam and most of the actors speak Hindi. It felt homely and connected. So that is the synergy and positivity converted into a film. All the best brains and best cultures have been fused together to make Jawan, and that’s why, personally, I think this film has one X factor where all synergies are coming together to give a great positive.\n\nWhat were your takeaways from Jawan?\n\nSee, every film teaches you a lot of stuff. This particular film has taught me patience and calmness. If you really wish for something, you have to wait and be a little patient and that’s the best learning I have had. I didn’t have patience before. I have always been like, I have to finish the film and I have to move on, this and that. But now I am really calm and it’s worth it. It was. I think I have to give credit to my wife Priya and Shah Rukh sir. Yeah, I have to give credit to both of them. They both made me patient and calm. Their presence in my life made this film better.\n\nSpeaking of your wife, how does she balance out your life?\n\nI am a very fast person. I have to finish, which means I rush a lot. But she holds me and says that it’s okay. It will take time. You’re pulling a mountain now; it can’t happen like that. So you have to really be patient and see. She’s my best positive energy and that keeps me growing at this level. In 10 years of directing five films, where I am today is all because of my wife. I’m really thankful.\n\nYour child, Meer, born this year in January, must be a lucky mascot for you…\n\nYeah, after his birth, life has really given me a new grammar. He, in his own way, makes me calm. A lot of things are happening. The film is being showered with love, reviews, and box office numbers, but I’m at home. Sitting with him, we both look at each other and I’m extremely calm. It’s like he’s saying, “You have nothing more important than me in the world, so concentrate on me.” And he’s right.\n\nAfter all the rumours that were there, do we get to see a movie where Vijay and Shah Rukh Khan come together?\n\nOh yes, back then, there was a rumour saying that Vijay and Shah Rukh were coming together. Good things always happen to me. Let’s see."
