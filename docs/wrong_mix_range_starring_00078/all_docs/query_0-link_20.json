        "text": "Pundits in India are speculating over who will win the clash between actor/producer/director Ajay Devgn’s action-thriller Shivaay and Karan Johar’s romantic drama Ae Dil Hai Mushkil, which launch on Friday in India and Bollywood-friendly markets.\n\nNone has seen either film so it’s pure guesswork, and as each tackles very different subjects and genres, it’s highly likely that audiences will not face an either/or choice. Besides, there is plenty of time to see both during the Diwali holidays.\n\nMoviegoers have been starved of compelling Bollywood fare since the middle of the year so both titles could well turn out to be blockbusters. “We feel both will be major hits,” says Kamal Gianchandani, CEO of India’s biggest circuit PVR Cinemas. Reliance Entertainment is releasing Shivaay in more than 60 territories, the widest ever international roll-out for the Bollywood star who has more than 100 acting credits.\n\nKoimoi.com’s Joginder Tuteja predicts the thrilller will deliver the second best opening day of Devgn’s career behind Singham Returns’ 32 crore ($4.8 million) in 2014, way ahead of Bol Bachchan’s 12.1 crore ($1.8 million) in 2012. Ae Dil Hai Mushkil star Ranbir Kapoor notched his best opening day in 2013 with Besharam’s 21.56 crore ($3.2 million). Johar’s Student of the Year took 9.25 crore ($1.4 million) on its first day in 2012, so both look set to have a career-best debut. The website RealBoxOffice!! reported strong advance sales for Shivaay and that there were ovations and tears at special screenings.\n\nDevgn has said he does not expect his film to open with big numbers on Friday as people prepare for Diwali, but by Monday he believes the audience “will know which is a better film and that will take away all the benefits.” Directing his first film since 2008’s U Me Aur Hum, a romantic drama about a couple dealing with Alzheimer’s, Devgn has succeeded in keeping much of the plot under wraps, revealing only that he plays a Himalayan mountaineer named Shivaay, an innocent everyman “who is capable of transforming into a mean destroyer when he needs to protect his family.”\n\nThe trailer focuses on the protagonist’s relationship with his daughter played by English actress Abigail Eames (TV's Mr Selfridge, Doctor Who) and the lengths to which he goes to protect her. In her Bollywood debut 19-year-old Sayyeshaa plays a woman who joins him in his quest to rescue his daughter. The cast includes another newcomer, Polish actress Erika Kaar, together with Vir Das, Girish Karnad and Saurabh Shukla.\n\n“ When viewers step out of the theater, I want their eyes to well up with emotion and a sense of happiness . The film should make them connect with whoever they love the most,” Devgn told The Times of India.\n\nJohar’s film is described as the ultimate story of unrequited love as it follows three characters. Ranbir Kapoor is Ayan, the sweet, quirky son of an industrialist who nurtures a hidden passion for singing. Anushka Sharma is Alizeh, the charming, funny but neglected youngest daughter of a family of aristocrats. Aishwarya Rai Bachchan is Saba, a beautiful divorcee who pours her pain into her poetry. Shah Rukh Khan has a cameo, six years after he starred in Johar’s My Name Is Khan.\n\nEros International initially was involved in the production but subsequently withdrew. The film has been the center of a controversy because Pakistani actor Fawad Khan is in the supporting cast. The Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS) party initially banned the release as part of a campaign to exclude Pakistani artists from India. That followed a terrorist attack on an Army base in Kashmir on September 18 which killed 18 Indian soldiers and wounded 30, for which India blamed Pakistan.\n\nThe row was settled when MNS agreed to the release on the proviso that all producers who employ Pakistani artists pay 5 crore ($752,000) into the Indian Army’s welfare fund as a so-called atonement. Subsequently exhibitors in Pakistan indicated they will lift their self-imposed ban on the screening of Indian films.\n\nThe Shivaay shoot in freezing conditions at the highest peak of Bulgaria's Pirin Mountain turned out to be physically and emotionally demanding for Devgn. In the extreme cold he got hypothermia. The doctor advised at least two days of rest but he insisted on returning to work after just 30 minutes, despite temperatures as low as minus 19 degrees Celsius.\n\nSayyeshaa, the daughter of actors Shaheen Banu and Sumeet Saigal, told local media, “Shivaay and Ae Dil Hai Mushkil belong to different genres and viewers will have an appetite for both if they are good. I am a little selfish and want my film to work, but I will definitely watch both movies. There shouldn't be any negativity when two films are releasing on the same day.”\n\nThe omens are very positive for Hindi films released during Diwali. All six titles launched in that period since 2011 have amassed at least 100 crore ($15 million). The Shah Rukh Khan starrer Happy New Year, which debuted in 2014, holds the record with an opening of 44.97 crore ($6.7 million). Salman Khan’s Prem Ratan Dhan Payo, which launched last year, is in second spot with a 40.35 crore ($6 million) debut."
