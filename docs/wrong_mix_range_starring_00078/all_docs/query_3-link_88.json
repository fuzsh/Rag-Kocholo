        "text": "By\n\nSharada Iyer\n\nI must say I was completely and unabashedly bowled over by the brilliant performance of Shah Rukh Khan in his dual avatar in the recently released ‘FAN’. The movie itself was very engrossing from start to finish with a taut script, racy narrative and no deviations from the central plot. On top of it there are no songs!!! Even the catchy song released as a teaser-‘Jabra fan ho gayaa…’ was only for the You Tube promotions. It is not part of the film. Indeed the film showcases two SRKs- both in an unusual light sans his popular romantic image, no star-heroine and as I mentioned no songs…\n\nThe film with an interesting plot of a superstar and his look-alike fan is basically a psychological thriller and hence may not appeal to SRK’s usual family audience but there is no doubt that he has shown tremendous guts in accepting such a project highlighting the negative shades in both the characters. True, SRK did attempt such characters in the beginning of his career like Darr, Baazigar, Anjaam and Hum Tumhare Hain Sanam but to have one Shah Rukh pitted against another throughout the film is a novel aspect.\n\nThe story in a gist is about a fan who is obsessed with his favourite superstar and would go to any lengths to meet him and just spend five minutes with him. What he fails to realize is that he is only one among the countless fans spread all over the country with similar dreams and aspirations. Ironically he not only resembles him in looks but also hails from a middle-class family in Delhi and wins a prize every year for the best act in a local ‘mela’ or fair by imitating him and all this makes him feel even closer to his idol.\n\nBut when destiny does bring him face to face with his idol, things go completely wrong and this chance meeting turns out to be a complete antithesis of whatever he had dreamt of. With the result, his attitude takes a 180 degree turn and he now hates the very man who had possessed him mentally and emotionally all these years.\n\nThus starts a cat-and-mouse game between the two with unexpected twists and turns and thrilling chase sequences showing the extent to which a human mind can plot and plunge when desperation sets in. Revealing anything more of the plot would spoil the fun for those who have not yet seen…but it would suffice to say that in spite of a few loopholes, there is not a single boring moment.\n\nShah Rukh Khan brings out the complexities of both the characters beautifully but it is as the star- obsessed-fan that he steals your heart from the very first scene. The typical Punjabi-Delhi accent, his body language as that of a 25-year old Delhiite and his camaraderie with his parents are all superbly executed. In a country like ours obsessed with Bollywood stars, his maniacal obsession is very believable and the audience would be inclined to understand and empathize with him completely. A special mention about the outstanding prosthetics and make-up used to create a younger looking SRK albeit with a difference in their jawline and hairstyle. This gives a very authentic touch to his whole get-up.\n\nShah Rukh as the superstar is also not an easy act to pull through. To play a character who for all practical purposes is modelled on his real life persona and exposes the vulnerable and not so-likeable aspects of any star in his/her real life requires gumption and to SRK’s credit, he has given it his all and come out in flying colours.\n\nAs we leave the cinema hall, we cannot help but wonder as to how we as a nation are so obsessed with our stars and subconsciously feel a connection with them… the kind of joyful madness which makes people travel from different parts of the country, stand for hours in front of their house in a milling crowd just to get a glimpse of, or just a wave from their favourite star… and in the process derive so much pleasure…\n\n…And do these stars, who work day in and day out to entertain us and capture our hearts and sell us dreams, really understand what it is to be a true and loyal fan? To quote the fan’s dialogue from the film where he tells the star – “Tum nahin samjhoge…” (You will never understand). Eventually both the star and the fan become victims of the images created on celluloid and are caught in a web of emotions of their own making.\n\nIt is immaterial whether the film rakes in rupees 100 crores in the first week or beats the record of his earlier films or is even termed a flop, it is a treat for SRK fans… and for those who are not his fans, all I can say is you are missing something…\n\nBy\n\nSharada Iyer\n\nAcknowledged as one of Hindi Cinema’s greatest legends, Kundan Lal Saigal was hailed as ‘Shahenshah-e-mausiqi’ (emperor of music) as well as the ‘ghazal king’ and became a phenomenon in his lifetime. He appeared at a time when recording techniques were rudimentary and the film industry was on the brink of changing from ‘silent films’ to ‘talkies’. As songs started becoming an integral part of movie scripts, he had to devote his time equally between acting and singing. Within a short span of 15 years and without any formal training in music, the irresistible spell cast by his golden voice remains unparalleled and his songs recorded eighty years ago evoke the same kind of magic even today…\n\nOften while writing columns on superstars of Hindi Cinema, the counting incongruously starts with the triumvirate of Dilip Kumar-Dev Anand-Raj Kapoor who dominated a large part of the Black&White era. But what is forgotten is that these three towering personalities though incomparable and charismatic have charmed the audience only from 1948. Such articles choose to ignore the fact that the film industry which started in 1913, was already 35 years old by the time these stars made their debut. There were other luminaries before them whose immense contribution to the world of Hindi Cinema in its nascent stages has often been undermined and overlooked with the passage of time, the brightest among them being -Kundan Lal Saigal.\n\nApart from being the film industry’s first ‘Superstar’, K L Saigal is also hailed as the ‘founding father’ of Hindi film music as well as the ‘architect’ of the market for film records. The phenomenal success of his film ‘Devdas’ in 1935 and the songs sung by him in the film prompted New Theatres to release gramophone records of film songs under its own label. Thereafter, Saigal’s each and every song was separately recorded and had unprecedented sales all over the country. HMV, which had earlier ignored film songs, realized the power of film music and began recording every film song thereafter even producing records of earlier popular hits.\n\nIn 1933, the bandish ‘Jhulana jhulao…’ in raag Jaunpuri, a non-film song, became Saigal’s very first recorded song on gramophone and created history by selling over 5,00,000 copies. His records were played in shops and restaurants to attract customers. Saigal’s songs attained the supreme status of ‘people’s music’ and his foremost legacy is thus the introduction and popularizing of film songs to the Indian public as he took screen music into every home and in doing so lent dignity and stability to film music. He is said to have turned music into a simple emotional poetry of the soul and the music maestros of his time were stunned by his instinctive knowledge of the ragas which they felt had the touch of divine.\n\nJhulana jhulao\n\nThat Saigal was destined to become a phenomenon in his lifetime can be best understood by looking at the events of his life which eventually led this school drop-out from Jammu to reach Calcutta as a young lad and become associated with B N Sircar of the New Theatres and finally end up in Bombay, which was to become the mecca of the Hindi film industry…\n\nEarly life:\n\nBorn on 11th April, 1904, to Amar Chand (a tehsildar in the service of the maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir) and Kesar Devi (a home-maker who loved singing bhajans and folk songs), Kundan Lal Saigal was the third of their four sons and probably inherited his musical genes from his mother. Ironically his parents engaged a music tutor for his elder brother overlooking the real talent in their home.\n\nRight from a very young age Saigal loved to accompany his mother and would sing along with her in the local ‘Ram Lila’ celebrations and played the part of Sita, the singing heroine and would be thrilled with the applause he received. His alarming disinterest in studies and his growing love for music caused worry to his parents especially to his father who was very upset. No punishment had any effect on him and sometimes when he would be made to work in the kitchen, instead of feeling bad, he picked up tips which in later years is said to have turned him into an expert cook.\n\nSaigal picked up singing from listening to wandering minstrels, folk singers and famous classical musicians who visited the maharaja’s court. When his father retired and the family moved to Jullunder, he picked up Punjabi folk tunes also. With the passage of time, his quest for understanding the special meaning and mystery of music made him more and more restless and one day around 1922-23, he decided to leave home without telling anybody and for the next eight years travelled to different cities and took up small jobs but he continued singing and kept his passion for music alive. However, he kept in touch with his mother to convey news of his well-being during this period.\n\nThere is not much written record of his exact whereabouts during this time but there are stories, from people whom he met or stayed with for short periods of time, about his taking up odd jobs in different towns and cities. However, there is no evidence that he learnt music from any teacher during this period. Finally he landed in Calcutta but there are different versions as to how he exactly came in contact with B N Sircar to start his tryst with New Theatres which turned him into the legend that he became later.\n\nThe ‘Saigal Era’:\n\nSaigal took the country by storm and the period between 1932 and 1945 is often referred to as the ‘Saigal era’. Never before had the Indian screen presented such a glorious singer with so much emotion and pathos in his voice. People didn’t merely love Saigal. They revered his glorious voice which directly touched their hearts.\n\nHe had the good fortune of singing songs composed by accomplished music directors like R C Boral, Pankaj Mullick, Timir Baran, Khemchand Prakash, Gyan Dutt and Naushad and got to work in some great films under the baton of brilliant directors like P C Barua, Nitin Bose, Jayant Desai, Hem Chunder and Phani Mazumdar who contributed immensely in turning him into the greatest actor-singer of his time.\n\nWith ‘Alam Ara’ in 1931, sound was introduced in Indian Cinema and songs became an integral part of our movies. In 1932, New Theatres launched Saigal with the film ‘Mohabbat Ke Aansoo’ followed by ‘Zinda Laash’ and ‘Subah Ka Sitara’. Though he did not gain popularity with these three films, appreciation came his way with hits like ‘Puran Bhakt’ and ‘Yahudi Ki Ladki’ in 1933 and ‘Kaarwan-e-Hayat’ and ‘Chandidas’ in 1934. In fact, the latter film was a super-hit establishing him as an actor-singer of reckoning.\n\nIn 1934, he married Asha Rani and the couple had a son and two daughters and also adopted his niece as their own.\n\nThe ‘Devdas’ phenomenon:\n\nThe spectacular success of Devdas, released in 1935, turned Saigal into a national icon and the powerful appeal of the romantic-tragic hero made ‘Devdas’ a cult figure. Apart from a sterling performance, his enchanting melodies created a sensation among the youth of that time. Songs like ‘Baalam aayo baso more man mein…’ and ‘Dukh ke din ab beetat nahin…’ became an addiction for millions of his fans. They would throng the cinema halls to watch Saigal, with his drooping lock of hair and would memorize the dialogues in a bid to imitate him. The film set the pace for the popularity of doomed hero on Indian screen and the term ‘Devdas’ replaced ‘Majnu’ to symbolize a deeply dejected lover.\n\nBalam aaye baso morey man main\n\nPost ‘Devdas’:\n\nAfter ‘Devdas’, a spate of films came and there was no looking back. Films like ‘Inquilab’, ‘President’, ‘Crorepati’, ‘Pujarin’ , ‘Street Singer’, ‘Zindagi’, ‘Tansen’, ‘Shah Jahan’,etc., had Saigal gems like ‘Ek Bangla Bane Nyaara…’, ‘Piye ja aur piye ja…’, ‘Andhe ki laathi tu hi hai…’, ‘ Diya jalaao jag mag jag mag…’ ‘Nuktacheen hai gham-e-dil…,’ ‘Karun kya aas niraas bhai…’, ‘Soja rajkumari soja…’, ‘Jab dil hi toot gaya…’, ‘Chaah barbaad karegi maloom na tha…’, etc.\n\nAye Qatibe-Taqdeer\n\nDo naina\n\nMain kya jaanu\n\nDiya jalao\n\nIn fact, today on You tube, one can listen to the classic-‘Baabul mora, naihar chhuto hi jaaye…’, sung by many great ghazal singers and exponents of classical music like Jagjit Singh, Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, Begum Akhtar, Kishori Amonkar, Ghulam Ali, Girija Devi, etc. No doubt, they have all added their brilliance to this thumri composed by R C Boral and set to raag Bharavi, but without exaggeration it can be stated that none can even come close to the magic Saigal brought to the song. It is his resonating voice and rendition which remains in our hearts long after we have ceased to listen to the song.\n\nA special feature of the song is that it was recorded live with Saigal walking the streets, singing and playing the harmonium, while a mike followed him in a truck behind. This was done because Saigal who plays a street singer in the film wanted the song to appear natural and in tune with his character.\n\nBabul mora\n\nSuch was the impact of his singing and the level of his reverence that the first generation of playback singers of Hindi cinema, viz., Mohammed Rafi, Kishore Kumar, Mukesh and Talat Mehmood as well as his contemporary C H Atma are said to have idolised Saigal and tried to adopt his style of singing as can be seen from their first recorded songs. Lata Mangeshkar in one of her early interviews is said to have confessed her love for Saigal.\n\nSaigal, the actor:\n\nSaigal’s acting abilities were always overshadowed by his singing genius. He belonged to the era when singer-actors were ruling the industry. For him acting was only a means to showcase his singing talent. But to his credit, he came up with very natural performances in all his films. Though not considered conventionally good-looking, at 6’1”, he was very tall, lanky and had a deep baritone with excellent diction and clarity of dialogue delivery. He was actually bald and wore a wig in his films. Yet there was something about his common-man demeanor which appealed to the public and they thronged the movie halls to see and hear him.\n\nThe fact that the choice of his roles –that of a singer, a poet, a saint, a gypsy, etc., matched his personality and allowed him to have great songs picturised on him was a big plus point. He was brilliant in ‘Devdas’ ,’Tansen’, ‘Street Singer’, ‘Bhakt Surdas’, ‘My Sister’, etc. and his pairing with the beautiful Khurshid in ‘Tansen’, Suraiyya in ‘Parwana’ and Jamuna in ‘Devdas’ was a delight to watch.\n\nMore balapan ke saathi(duet)\n\nNone of his contemporaries in Calcutta or Bombay could match his singing prowess. Ashok Kumar did offer some competition but Saigal’s talent was peerless.\n\nShift from Calcutta to Bombay:\n\nThe Second World War brought about many changes. There was a rush for newer equipments and the studio system started disintegrating. New Theatres was affected. As the hub of the film industry shifted to Bombay, even though the industry there could not match up to the creative excellence of their Calcutta counterparts in terms of direction as well as music, the atmosphere became more commercial and Saigal’s health suffered.\n\nMany of the artistes shifted to Bombay and eventually Saigal also had to move out. He was hired by Ranjit Movietone in Bombay for a contract of three films at a princely sum of rupees one lakh, unheard of in those days. His very first film under the contract was ‘Tansen’ which turned out to be a runaway hit with all thirteen songs creating a sensation. His last movies were ‘Parwana’ and ‘Shahjahan’ and had music by the great Naushad . Together they created immortal melodies like ‘Jab dil hi toot gaya…’, ‘Chaah barbaad karegi…’, ‘Ruhi, ruhi ruhi… ,’\n\nJab dil hi toot gaya\n\nTreasury of ghazals\n\nHe also bequeathed to the world of music a rich repertoire of non-film ghazals and bhajans. He selected and composed some on his own especially Ghalib’s poetry and preferred to sing them at private gatherings with his friends. In fact, it was his ghazals which first fetched him popularity among the connoisseurs of the music world before his film songs became a rage.\n\nNukta cheen\n\nGhazal-duniya mein hoon\n\nMirza ghalib-non-film\n\nSaigal was a very unassuming, humble and kind-hearted man who was always ready to help anyone. Once he is said to have given away his diamond ring to help a poor widow. It is sad that a singer as gifted as Saigal fell prey to the vice of alcohol and started taking a small peg of whiskey (which he referred to as ‘kaali paanch’) in between rehearsals and this ultimately took a toll on his health. He was also suffering from acute diabetes and it was with great difficulty that he managed to finish his last two films. Music director Naushad managed to convince him to record the songs of ‘Shahjahan’ without his usual whiskey and when he heard this version, Saigal lamented that if only he had met Naushad earlier in his life, he could have lived a few more years.\n\nAnd so it was on 18th January, 1947, at the young age of forty-two, even before our country became independent, this musical genius departed leaving behind gems in his deep sonorous voice. He made his songs sound so effortless and it is only when we try to sing them do we realize the finesse in his technique and the true power of his hold over ‘swara’ and ‘sur’ in the composition. He set very high standards for the singers after him and thus became the first institution in playback singing…\n\nTribute to Saigal by the great music director Naushad :\n\n“Aisa koyee fankaar-e-mukammal nahin aaya\n\nNagmon ka barasta hua badal nahin aaya\n\nMausiquee ke maahir bahut aaye hain lekin\n\nDuniya mein doosra koi Saigal nahin aaya”\n\n(English Translation: A perfect artiste like Saigal, a cloud bursting with melodies has yet to be seen again, many maestros of music have appeared on the scene, but no one has been able to match Saigal’s genius)\n\nBy\n\nSharada Iyer\n\nIt has been a week since director R Balki’s latest venture ‘Ki & Ka’ hit the screens across India. While the critics came down quite strongly with their scathing reviews giving the film an average of 2 -2.5 stars, the audience in general seem to have accepted it and the film has done very good business in its first week. Considering the unique theme of the film and the absence of any big star, this is quite an achievement.\n\nBox-office collections:\n\nKi And Ka – 34.89 crore [6 days]\n\nGhayal Once Again – 34.25 crore [7 days]\n\nWazir – 30.05 crore [7 days]\n\nKya Kool Hain Hum 3 – 29.65 crore [7 days]\n\n(source: http://www.koimoi.com/box-office/box-office-ki-and-ka-reaches-35-crore-mark-in-6-days/)\n\nAll those who have seen Balki’s earlier films- Cheeni Kum, Paa and Shamitabh- will by now be familiar with his penchant for unusual storylines and well-defined characters. In Ki & Ka also he has chosen a unique subject of ‘gender reversal’.\n\nThe film takes us on an imaginary ride of what all can happen if the roles, as ‘conceived’ by our society all these years, are reversed for a man and woman. “What if, in a marriage, the woman decides to go out and earn and the man decides to stay at home and cook, clean and manage the house?”- is the question the film poses. It is the story of a couple wherein the wife is shown to be a hard core professional, a workaholic, whose sole aim in life is to climb up the corporate ladder as fast as possible and become the CEO of the company which according to her is the ultimate thing to be achieved in life. Her husband on the other hand is very unique as he has no interest in working in any office or be part of the usual ‘rat-race’ in any business but just wants to be a home-maker.\n\nEverything is fine for a while till he starts getting popularity inadvertently for being such a sweet, understanding and supportive husband to the woman he loves. Suddenly he is sought after by different companies, women’s organizations, cookery shows (he is shown to be an expert chef) to come and deliver talks on gender equality and how roles should not be compartmentalized for men and women and that it should be left to the individual to make the choice to pursue what they want in life.\n\nUnexpected popularity obviously brings in unexpected ego issues and Kareena is not able to handle the sudden attention being bestowed on Arjun Kapoor. According to her he should just remain her husband and not really have an identity of his own because he is not the earning member and so does not deserve all this attention. The film thus beautifully highlights the plight of a home-maker and throws up many questions about his/her value and contribution in building a life. So often is the person staying at home taken for granted and for lack of any ‘earned’ income their role is undermined.\n\nAny marriage comes with its share of problems and so is the case with this couple also. In fact the gist of the film is beautifully brought out towards the end of the film by Swaroop Sampat, who plays Kareena’s mom. She explains how the partner who goes out to earn, irrespective of whether it is the man or the woman, automatically starts believing that he or she is the more important and powerful person in the relationship and the one who stays at home and looks after the members but does not draw a salary for it, attains secondary importance. This ultimately leads to ego issues and hurtful situations and sometimes damage beyond repair takes place.\n\nThe film also makes us think –Why is it considered wrong for a woman to be career-oriented or ambitious? Why is a man considered to be a weirdo by his own family members themselves, if he wants to look after the house? There is another point which comes to fore- Usually women never tire of cribbing about the lack of their husband’s involvement in household chores but here she gets a man who does everything for her and yet she is not happy…\n\nThe director makes us ponder on some relevant points-How many of us in real life would be willing to accept this kind of gender reversal? As a society, we seem fine when it comes to a woman being a home-maker but the moment it is a man we think he is wasting his time and not contributing to society and living off his wife’s income… So can such an imaginary situation ever become a reality? And if it does become, will it bring happiness ?…\n\nOne of the best things about the film is that there are no preachy messages and advice offered. In fact, the film tells us not to be harsh and judgemental towards any one person, instead it throws up valid points and questions to be reflected upon…\n\nIn terms of performances, Arjun Kapoor gives yet another sensitive performance after his superb act in ‘2 States’. He carries off the role with an endearing finesse and aplomb and the fact that his character in the film like in his real life, has lost his mother to whom he was very attached seems to give him a better understanding of the role adding a quiet dignity to it. Kareena looks her age and after a long time has taken a film which showcases her talent and not her item numbers. She is perfectly cast and looks stunning. It was nice seeing Swaroop Sampat on screen after ages. Music is a big let-down and the songs could have been better.\n\nThe film is not without its minus points and a few clichéd things but on the whole, it was thoroughly enjoyable. Balki has hit the right note!!!\n\nBy\n\nSharada Iyer\n\nPriyanka Chopra is on an unbelievable roll. Achieving new milestones one after the other, she is adding a new dimension to her multi-faceted personality almost every day. Her steely determination coupled with terrific hard work, unwavering focus, relentless perseverance and an extraordinary will to excel in whatever she does has turned her into a national as well as an international icon with a huge fan-following which boasts of more than 10 million Twitter followers and more than 3 million on Instagram. She was named the”Most Influential Indian in the Social Media Circuit” by the digital advertising firm Pinstorm.\n\nIt was on 30th November 2000 that a young 18-year old Priyanka Chopra announced her arrival in the national as well as international glamour scene by conquering the ‘Miss World’ title with her beauty and brains. That was just the first of the innumerable feathers she was going to add to her alluring persona over the years. Sixteen years later, she has once again wowed the world with her amazing acting prowess and her incredible ability to fit into international television as well as any movie scenario effortlessly. She has not only made a distinctive name for herself, but also brought laurels to India as well.\n\nAN ACTRESS PAR EXCELLENCE\n\nHer unique career graph has no parallel anywhere in the world. The former Miss World started off as a model and soon went on to win the coveted beauty pageant title before taking the entertainment industry by storm. Her career as a Bollywood actress is studded with many unique roles where she bravely tackled several intriguing characters and proved her versatility with every film. Today, after thirteen years in the industry, she is not only our industry’s best actress, she can unequivocally be termed as Hindi Cinema’s first female ‘Superstar’ considering the number of box-office hits as well as the variety of roles she continues to tackle with aplomb.\n\nTwice in her career- in 2005 and 2008, she had as many as six releases to her credit which is a record for any artiste in our industry. In 2009, she took on the challenge of playing twelve characters in the film ‘What’s Your Raashee?’ and till date holds the world record among both male and female actors for playing twelve roles in a film. In the film, when the hero is forced to marry within a short period of time by his family, he decides to meet a girl from every sign of zodiac or ‘raashee’ before taking the plunge and Priyanka plays the twelve girls bringing out the subtle differences in their persona beautifully.\n\nHer bag of trophies includes awards under various categories ranging from Best Debut Award, Best Supporting Actress Award, Best Performance in a Negative Role,several Best Actress Awards, Entertainer of the Year Award, National Award for Best Actress and the latest crowning glory being the prestigious civilian award-Padma Shri, which was conferred on her recently.\n\nSome of her other awards in India during her eventful professional journey include Most Searched Female Actor on Internet, GQ Woman of the Year, Most Impactful Debut on Television, Green Globe Award for Contribution to a Greener Earth, Indiepop Song of the Year, Woman of Substance, Videocon India Youth Icon Awards, India’s Style Icon, World’s Sexiest Asian Award, Style Diva of the Year, India’s Best Dressed, Ambassador of Beauty and Substance, Punjabi Icon,etc.\n\nShe is also a singer, television host, runs a production company, is a humanitarian associated with many charitable causes and has recently acquired popularity abroad with her role in the American TV serial Quantico in which she plays the lead role of FBI Agent Alex Parish. She has also bagged an important role in the Hollywood movie ‘Baywatch’ based on the popular television series of the same name.\n\nMULTI-FACETED\n\nFew are aware that the she started her acting career with a small role in singer Daler Mehndi’s music video titled ‘Satrangiya’. The video was a hit and she had taken her first steps towards her goal.\n\nSajan Mere Satrangiya – Ek Dana | Priyanka Chopra & Daler Mehndi | Daler Mehndi\n\nIn 2002, she decided to enter the world of films and chose a Tamil film ‘Thamizhan’ as her debut vehicle opposite Southern Superstar Vijay. The film was a big hit. Encouraged by her co-star Vijay, she even managed to record her first song for the film. So her acting and singing debut happened simultaneously.\n\nThamizhan│Ullathai Killathey Thee Vaithu Sellathey Song\n\nIt was in 2003 that she got her first break in Hindi films. The film titled ‘The Hero: Love Story of a Spy’, had her in a supporting role and she shared screen space with Sunny Seol, Preity Zinta and Amrish Puri. She followed this up with some stellar performances in negative roles in Andaaz and Aitraaz before getting roles as the main heroine.\n\nSome of her not to be missed films include Aitraaz, Fashion, Dostana, Gunday, Dil Dhadakne Do, Mary Kom, What’s Your Raashee?, Kaminey, Don, Don 2, Barfi, Saat Khoon Maaf, Bajirao Mastani, Jai Gangajal, etc.\n\nHer item number in Ram Leela:\n\nA LOOK AT SOME OF HER UNIQUE HONOURS:\n\nMusic\n\nHer first single, “In My City”, debuted on September 13, 2012, in a TV spot for NFL’s Thursday Night Football. This single – which also features American rapper Will.i.am – went triple platinum in India; winning her the Best International Debut award at the People’s Choice Awards.\n\nIn December 2012, she received three nominations: Best Female Artist, Best Song and Best Video (for “In My City”) at the World Music Awards. She also received the Trailblazer Award from the South Asian Media, Marketing and Entertainment Association for becoming the first Bollywood actor to win a major record deal in the U.S.\n\nShe released a second single in 2013, and a third in 2014: both of which had some chart success in multiple countries.\n\nAwards\n\nShe became the first South Asian actress to be honoured with the Best actress trophy at the People’s Choice Awards for her performance of an FBI recruit in American TV series “Quantico”, and beat TV heavyweights Emma Roberts, Jamie Lee Curtis, Lea Michele and Marcia Gay Harden to bag the prestigious award.\n\nShe has also bagged a nomination in the best actress category at the 8th Annual Shorty Awards which highlight the best content across the social media landscape including Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, YouTube and Instagram. ‘The 33-year-old actress, who has a huge fan following across all social media platforms, will compete with big names like Amandla Stenberg, Cara Delevingne, Elizabeth Banks, Gabourey Sidibe, Kerry Washington, Maisie Williams, Olivia Wilde, Reese Witherspoon, Taraji P Henson, Uzo Aduba and Zendaya’, said The Hollywood Reporter. The awards will be presented at a ceremony to be held in April in New York.\n\nAt the 88th Oscar awards held on February 29th, 2016, Priyanka Chopra was one of the 13 presenters and was asked to give the award to Margaret Sixel for Best Film Editing for “Mad Max: Fury Road”.\n\nAt the People’s Choice Awards, she got the opportunity to present ‘Fast And Furious 7’ star, Vin Diesel with the Favourite Movie and Favourite Action Movie Awards.\n\nPriyanka Chopra shared the stage with actor Pedro Pascal to present the award for Outstanding Male Actor in a Drama Series at the 22nd annual Screen Actors Guild Awards held in January 2016.\n\nWorld of animation\n\nIn 2013, Priyanka was featured as the voice of Ishani in Disney’s “Planes”! Her other cartoon voice credit includes the voice of Ms. Marvel for the Avengers Academy video game (2016).\n\nRecently she took over the voice of the character ‘Kaa’ to dub in the Hindi version of one of India’s most loved animated series ‘The Jungle Book’. Her playful and sultry voice was apt to match Scarlett Jahansson’s sensual rendition of “Kaa’ in the English version.\n\nOther Achievements\n\nOn January 15th, 2016, Priyanka Chopra’s production house, Purple Pebble Pictures (PPP) announced its foray into regional cinema, outlining details for three films one each in Bhojpuri, Marathi and Punjabi, and are expected to release in 2016 itself. The vision of her company is to create a platform for great stories to be told, irrespective of their genre and language, and also to provide a solid platform for new talent not just in acting but also across all other areas including direction, script-writing etc.\n\nPriyanka has turned co-producer for a mobi-series “It’s My City” for a video entertainment mobile app. It has been created by celebrity digital network Fluence and produced in association with her production company Purble Pebble Pictures India and Endemol-Shine India. The series which will also feature the actress herself in an important role, revolves around the everyday lives and struggles of four young girls – Manika, Sonali, Tina and Nikki – living together in the same flat in Mumbai. Mirroring the reality of everyday lives, the series captures the ups and downs of these girls as they set out to achieve their dreams.\n\nHollywood calling\n\nAfter taking the American Television scene by storm with her role in Quantico, she has been signed in a Hollywood film to play a negative character, Victoria Leeds, in ‘Baywatch’ – the film. She will be starring along with Dwayne Johnson, Zac Efron, Alexandra Daddario and Ilfenesh Hadera. The film is slated to release in May, 2017.\n\nHumanitarian efforts\n\nStarting in 2009, Priyanka began writing columns for such credible publications as The Hindustan Times, The Times of India, The Guardian, and even the New York Times!\n\nIn 2010, she was appointed a UNICEF National Ambassador, with the responsibility of promoting issues relating to child rights and adolescence.\n\nShe also supports many environmental charities, and is brand ambassador for NDTV’s Greenathon: an initiative to support eco-friendliness and improve electricity supplies to rural villages. She has also appeared for telethons and shows to raise money for such targeted causes as: to increase the understanding of leprosy, to help the victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, and to help fund NGO Cancer Patients Aid Association. To promote the practice of organ donation, Priyanka publicly pledged her own organs after death.\n\nBeing the daughter of physicians in the Indian Army, she got the opportunity to live in various places thanks to her dad’s postings. Starting from Jamshedpur where she was born to staying in places like Delhi, Chandigarh, Ambala, Ladakh, Lucknow, Bareilly, and Pune and even a 3-year stint in USA where she lived with her aunt, she learnt to adjust and adapt easily in all these locations. It is this background which probably makes it easy for her to shuttle between continents and juggle her assignments.\n\nAt the moment she is basking in the glory of her role as ‘Kashibai’ in the super-hit ‘Bajirao Mastani’ for which she has already won several awards. In the role of SP Abha Mathur in the recently released Jai Gangajal, she has also done some superb action sequences.\n\nMISS WORLD 2000 Crowning moment\n\nPriyanka Chopra – In My City ft. will.i.am\n\nPriyanka Chopra’s 2015 Quantico Official Trailer HD\n\nPriyanka Chopra Unique Role\n\nLooking at her life one cannot help but remember the following lines from the poem:\n\nTHE ROAD NOT TAKEN\n\nBy Robert Frost\n\n…I shall be telling this with a sigh\n\nSomewhere ages and ages hence:\n\nTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I—\n\nI took the one less travelled by,\n\nAnd that has made all the difference…\n\nHere’s wishing this wonderful actress all the very best in all her future endeavours…\n\nBy\n\nSharada Iyer\n\nThe heroine of Raja Harishchandra, the first full-length feature film of Indian Cinema, was a male actor Anna Salunke cast in the role of Queen Taramati. Acting was a profession looked down upon in those days and the restriction was more so in case of females because of which Dadasaheb Phalke, the father of Indian Cinema, could not get a female actress to play the heroine’s role. After searching for many days Phalke settled for an effeminate looking Anna Salunke, to dress up as a female and thus in 1913 when the film released, technically he became Indian Cinema’s first ‘Heroine’…\n\nFrom time to time the male actors of our industry have donned the female attire without any qualms to raise a few laughs and provide some change from the usual. The scripts of stories have been tailored to include situations where such scenes can be incorporated with ease, for instance to escape some bad guys or cops during chase scenes, to trick the villains in a bid to catch them, to enter a girls’ hostel stealthily, to fool the would-be father-in-law or maybe just for a lark.\n\nThough some actors only came for a few scenes some lucky ones also got to lip-sync to a catchy number sung by a female playback singer which gave the whole get-up a really hilarious touch. Two notable exceptions have been when Amitabh Bachchan and Kishore Kumar dressed up as females, they sang their own songs.\n\nHere’s a look at some of the popular songs picturized on our ‘Drag Queens’…\n\nBiswajeet in Kismet, 1968\n\nBiswajeet’s name was immortalized in Bollywood history when he got to lip-sync to this outstanding duet along with Babita dressed up as a man. Composed by the genius O P Nayyar and sung by Asha Bhonsle and Shamshad Begum, this remains the most melodious song sung in this manner in Bollywood.\n\nKishore Kumar in Half-Ticket, 1965.\n\nAnything that this genius maverick has ever done remains inimitable. Imagine singing a duet in both female and male voices- in the female voice for himself dressed as a gypsy girl and in the male voice for Pran! It is said that for some reason, Lata Mangeshkar could not reach the recording studio to record the duet and it took poor Kishore Kumar a lot of time and effort to convince music director Salil Choudhary to allow him to sing in two voices…\n\nPran in Jangal Mein Mangal, 1972\n\nThis romantic-crime thriller had veteran Pran playing a double role with aplomb. He also managed to shock his fans when he decided to masquerade as a woman along with Kiran Kumar, also dressed in drag, and sing this hilarious song.\n\nI S Johar in Bewakoof, 1960\n\nI S Johar dons the garb of a widow and pretends to seduce the actors Ulhas and Mukri and keep them occupied so that Kishore Kumar, his friend in the film, gets time to spend with Ulhas’s daughter Mala Sinha. He seems to be enjoying the whole experience…\n\nAmitabh Bachchan in Lawaaris, 1981\n\nIn 1981, Amitabh Bachchan sent a shock wave with this song as nobody had expected this from the then Superstar. The song however became a rage and also became a part of every stage show he performed thereafter where Jaya Bhaduri would come on stage for the stanza ‘Jiski biwi choti…’\n\nKamal Hassan in Chachi 420, 1997\n\nKamal Hassan took up this act a step further by dressing up in drag for an entire film- Chachi 420. He dresses up like a middle-aged woman and by a quirk of circumstance gets employed as a nanny to his own daughter in his wife’s house. He has both Amrish Puri and Paresh Rawal fall for him and the ensuing love-triangle is very entertaining.\n\nDara Singh in Lootera, 1965\n\nWho could have imagined our He-Man Dara Singh to don the female attire with panache and convincingly sing and dance also? All the other ‘girls ‘also seem to be males dressed like this in an attempt to fool the ‘bad’ guys and catch them ‘red-handed’.\n\nSheikh Mukhtar in Hum Sab Ustaad Hain, 1965\n\nAnother huge and hefty man of his time, Sheikh Mukhtar, the ‘bad guy’ here, decides to disguise as a Parsi lady and ends up being a part of this lovely Kishore Kumar number.\n\nRam Kapoor, Saif Khan, Riteish Deshmukh in Humshakals,2014\n\nThese three talented artistes play triple role in Humshakals and bring the house down with their ridiculous antics. Here is a song where one set of the trio decides to become females and romance their look-alikes from another set of the triple role. While Saif romances the female Riteish and Riteish romances the female Saif, Ram Kapoor romances his own double…\n\nShashi Kapoor in Haseena Maan Jaayegi, 1968\n\nShashi Kapoor decides to have some fun by dressing up in different types of female attire in different stanzas of the same song but he does look at ease in all of them…\n\nShammi Kapoor in Bluff Master, 1963\n\nDonning the female avatar for a stage show, Shammi Kapoor brings the house down in this unique type of qawaali.\n\nJohny Walker in Choo Mantar, 1956\n\nIn this song, actress Shyama comes to his rescue by singing for him and Johny Walker can be seen to be enjoying himself.\n\nGovinda in Aunty No. 1, 1998\n\nGovinda can be seeing imitating many of Madhuri Dixit’s steps from some of her popular dance numbers but sadly gives a vulgar touch to the scene.\n\nSome actors owing to their fair skin and effeminate features actually ended up looking beautiful.\n\nAamir Khan in Baazi, 1995\n\nSo convincingly does he do this cabaret number that it could put seasoned ‘item’ girls to shame.\n\nRishi Kapoor in Rafoo Chakkar, 1975\n\nRishi Kapoor and his friend Paintal witness a murder and to escape the murderers, they dress up in drag and enter a female compartment and meet the heroine Neetu Singh and her friends. For a large part of the film, they keep changing between the drag character and the real character.\n\nAll these songs became very popular. While some of the actors like Kishore Kumar and Shammi Kapoor were really funny, some like Govinda and Dara Singh looked weird and some like Rishi Kapoor actually ended up looking cute. But all were undoubtedly entertaining.\n\nWhatever the audience response may have been, all these actors who dared to take the plunge deserve to be applauded for their audacity…\n\nBy\n\nSharada Iyer\n\nIn October 2015, after a five-year hiatus post her delivery, Aishwarya Rai made a grand comeback with the taut thriller Jazbaa, which had her essaying the role of a suave criminal lawyer with effortless ease. The film made me wonder why our industry makes such few films focussing on lawyers and courtroom drama and even fewer ones where the female protagonist is a lawyer.\n\nLooking back one realizes that this genre has never been accorded much importance in our films which probably explains why many of our top male stars like Raj Kapoor, Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, Shammi Kapoor, Aamir Khan, Shahrukh Khan, Salman Khan, etc., have refrained from essaying the role of a lawyer.\n\nAfter a lot of research, I came across 15 remarkable films where our actresses have had the opportunity to don the black robe. Interestingly out of these, except for Insaaf Ka Tarazu and Phir Milenge, in all other instances our lady lawyers have emerged as the winner in the cases they represented. In all of them, they were pitted against brilliant actors in the role of the opposing counsel like Ashok Kumar, Danny Denzongpa, Paresh Rawal, Anupam Kher, Dr Shreeram Lagoo, Rajesh Khanna, etc., and the actresses matched these stalwarts in their acting prowess by coming up with outstanding performances.\n\nAishwarya Rai as Criminal Lawyer Anuradha Verma in Jazbaa (2015)\n\nAishwarya Rai plays a prominent criminal lawyer and a single mother who reportedly charges hefty fees but also has the reputation of never having lost a case. But one day, her six-year old daughter is kidnapped and she is forced to defend a rapist-cum-killer and have him pronounced innocent within seven days in order to have her daughter released without any harm. Thus starts a series of events interspersed with interesting courtroom scenes. Aishwarya Rai does a wonderful job of her well-defined role and could not have asked for a better comeback vehicle.\n\nPaoli Dam as Public Prosecutor Kajori Sen in Ankur Arora Murder Case (2013)\n\nPaoli Dam, plays a prosecution lawyer representing the mother whose child Ankur dies at the operation table due to negligence of the surgeon. By mistake the child consumes a few biscuits just one hour before the operation. The surgeon played by Kay Kay Menon should have either postponed the surgery or made use of an instrument called riles tube to pump out the contents of the boy’s stomach before conducting the surgery. He does neither and the child dies.\n\nWhat follows is a gripping drama of lies, deceit and cover-up by the surgeon and the brilliant court room scenes where Paoli unmasks this killer bit by bit. She may not be a well-known actress but Paoli comes up with a superb performance and gives the entire proceeding the necessary gravitas. Wonder why this medical thriller based on a real-life incident did not get the kind of publicity and popularity when it was released in 2013 which Talvar, also based on a real life incident had managed to garner recently.\n\nSushmita Sen as Defence Lawyer Neeti Khanna in Main Aisa Hi Hoon (2005)\n\nIn this film, Ajay Devgn plays an autistic man and Sushmita Sen as his defence lawyer helps him to get custody of his seven year old daughter. His wife Esha Deol had run away as soon as she gave birth to their baby and after some years commits suicide due to depression. But before she dies she writes to her father Anupam Kher, informing him that she has had a daughter and requests him to embrace both her husband and her child. But arrogance and anger clouds Anupam Kher’s judgement and he files a case for custody of his granddaughter and is out to prove that Ajay is an incapable father.\n\nSushmita Sen displays amazing poise and dignity and comes up with a very mature and convincing performance. The scene towards the end where she appeals to the judge asking him to think with his heart is very well done and her acting is very good. Really one cannot help but wonder why our industry could never come up with strong characters for talented actresses like her.\n\nKareena Kapoor as Defence Lawyer Priya Malhotra in Aitraaz (2004)\n\nHere Kareena Kapoor plays the defence lawyer who defends her husband Akshay Kumar. His ex-girlfriend Priyanka Chopra wrongly accuses him of a rape attempt because he thwarts her advances and refuses to have a physical relationship with her to satisfy her sexual fantasies. In a bid to take revenge and teach him a hard lesson for having hurt her ego, he is asked to resign from the company of which she is the Managing Director and her husband Amrish Puri the owner.\n\nThough Kareena’s scenes as a lawyer are restricted to only the last half-hour of the film, she comes up with a brilliantly restrained and dignified performance where she shows her real mettle as one of the finest actresses in our industry.\n\nRani Mukherjee as Defence Lawyer Saamiya Siddique inVeer Zara (2004)\n\nShah Rukh Khan gets framed wrongly on charges of being an Indian spy and ends up languishing in a Pakistani jail for 22 years before he meets Rani Mukherjee who decides to take up his case. She is determined to exonerate him, restore his name and identity, and return him to his country. Though she enters the film only in the second half, her courtroom scenes are laced with a lot of emotion and form the highlight of the film. She comes up with a memorable performance.\n\nMita Vashisht as Advocate Kalyani in Phir Milenge (2004)\n\nShilpa Shetty is a young professional working in an advertising agency and shares intimate relations with her boyfriend Salman Khan. Unfortunately after one such encounter she tests positive for HIV and when the word spreads around, her world turns upside down as she is removed from her job by unfair means. Angered by this turn of events, she files a case against her boss and here the boss is represented by defence lawyer Mita Vashisht.\n\nThough she has very few scenes as a lawyer, she does a wonderful job in her brief role and lends the required natural touch to the proceedings.\n\nSimi Garewal as Public Prosecutor in Insaaf Ka Tarazu (1980)\n\nA film unanimously considered to be ‘unique and outstanding’ for the mature way in which the subject of rape was dealt with, it has riveting court room scenes laced with powerful dialogues and brilliant performances from one and all. A rich and famous businessman, Raj Babbar in a fit of rage and jealousy rapes a top model-cum-beauty-queen Zeenat Aman in her own apartment. In the absence of any incriminating evidence against him or any witness to prove his heinous crime, Simi Garewal as Zeenat’s lawyer is unable to nail him and he manages to get away without any punishment.\n\nBoth Zeenat Aman and Simi Garewal have given their career-best performances in the film. In the role of the Public Prosecutor Simi is simply astonishing. The amount of conviction and honesty she brings to the role is indescribable and it can be said without hesitation that this is perhaps the best role written till today for a female lawyer.\n\nSmita Patil as Public Prosecutor/Defence Lawyer Rajni in Aaj Ki Awaaz (1984)\n\nRaj Babbar with the help of public prosecutor Smita Patil files a case of rape against Dalip Tahil but she loses the case because of false testimony given in his favour by a top Minister. Dalip Tahil escapes and to teach Raj Babbar a lesson, enters his house with many other goons, ties him to a chair and in front of his eyes not only ruthlessly kills his mother but six of them rape his sister repeatedly and kill her. Raj Babbar decides to take the law into his hands by tracking down every person associated with the dastardly act and ends up committing a chain of murders and then surrenders himself to the police.\n\nAt this stage, Smita Patil acts as his defence lawyer to plead justice on behalf of the man who had to resort to violence only because he did not get justice initially and the rapist was allowed to go scot-free. Powerful courtroom scenes with a superb performance from Smita Patil are the highlights of this film.I must add that it felt a little strange to accept Raj Babbar in this role after seeing him play a cold-blooded rapist in Insaaf Ka Tarazu.\n\nRekha as Public Prosecutor Shakuntala Devi in Mujhe Insaaf Chahiye (1983)\n\nRekha plays a public prosecutor who puts a case on Mithun Chakravorthy, the spoilt son of a rich industrialist, Danny Denzongpa. He pursues Rati Agnihotri, a small town girl, makes false promises of marrying her, tricks her into having sex with him and ends up getting her pregnant. When confronted with the truth, he not only refuses to accept the child as his but also completely disowns Rati and ends up marrying an upper-class rich girl Ranjeeta.\n\nRekha fights on behalf of Rati to get the due rights of the child as the son of Mithun and forces the family to accept the child as their rightful heir. Rekha shines as a lawyer in the courtroom battle and gives a superb performance.\n\nPriya Rajvansh as Defence Lawyer Karuna in Kudrat (1983)\n\nThis is a film based on re-incarnation and has an interesting story-line wherein Raj Kumar is accused of having raped and murdered Hema Malini in her previous birth. In the current birth the images keep flashing in her mind until she finally comes face to face with him and remembers everything. Rajesh Khanna who had been her lover in her previous birth also, plays the prosecutor while Priya Rajvansh who plays Raj Kumar’s daughter is the defence lawyer.\n\nThe last 45 minutes of the film are devoted to some engaging courtroom scenes. Pitted against superstar Rajesh Khanna, Priya does manage to hold her own and comes up with a creditable performance. The case is shown to be evenly matched till the end when there is an unusual twist of proceedings and the case takes an unexpected turn.\n\nSuchitra Sen as Defence Lawyer Suparna in Mamta (1966)\n\nThis film has Suchitra Sen in a memorable double role playing both mother and daughter. By a quirk of fate the older Suchitra Sen is separated from her lover Ashok Kumar and gets married to an alcoholic. She becomes a ‘devdasi’ and her daughter is brought up by Ashok Kumar without letting her know the identity of her mother. Circumstances take a nasty turn and Suchitra Sen is forced to kill her alcoholic husband who has now turned a blackmailer also.\n\nMeanwhile the daughter following in Ashok Kumar’s footsteps grows up to be a lawyer. The last scene of the film which is both emotional and impactful has the daughter Suchitra Sen as the defence lawyer pleading her mother’s case and she comes up with a splendid performance which leaves the audience stunned.\n\nHema Malini as Public Prosecutor Seema in Dard (1981)\n\nThis film is a remake of the 1960 classic Mamta with a few alterations in the script the most important being the role reversal of the protagonists. Instead of the mother and daughter angle, here the story revolves around father and son duo with the double role being essayed by Rajesh Khanna. Ashok Kumar’s role as a lawyer in the former is reprised by Hema Malini in the latter.\n\nThe film starts with a court scene where Hema Malini as public prosecutor gets the ‘father’ Rajesh Khanna mistakenly imprisoned for a murder he has not committed. Years later in another case, she acts as his defence lawyer and pleads innocence blaming the unfortunate circumstances which lead him to commit the crime. Though the film could not match up to the classic Mamta in terms of treatment and direction, Hema Malini suits the role beautifully. She plays the role with great aplomb and lends a graceful dignity to her character.\n\nMala Sinha as Defence Lawyer Shanti in Pooja ke Phool (1964)\n\nThe last 45-minutes of the film are devoted to some interesting and dramatic courtroom scenes and the confrontation between Mala Sinha who plays defence lawyer and her father Ashok Kumar who plays public prosecutor is one of the highlights of the film. Dharmendra is charged with the murder of an unknown young woman who travels all the way from the city to a small village where she is killed and thrown off a small cliff in the village. In order to protect his sister’s husband Pran, who is the actual murderer, Dharmendra takes up the blame on himself. Mala Sinha does a splendid job and proves her versatility as an accomplished actress of her time.\n\nPoint to ponder: Both in Dard as well as Pooja ke Phool our heroes take it upon themselves to mislead the investigation of a murder and mess up with the judicial inquiry by taking the blame on themselves. Not only do they tell lies but also decide that the sister in question should continue to live with a murderer and pretend that nothing untoward has happened. How on earth do they expect their sisters to live happily with murderers and where is the guarantee that more such murders won’t be committed? Further, they are never shown to get punishment for tampering with evidence and committing perjury in the court.\n\nSharmila Tagore as Public Prosecutor in Badnaam Farishtey (1971)\n\nIt was by sheer luck that I came across this unheard of film Badnaam Farishtey while browsing through some YouTube videos. The movie delves into the circumstances which force twelve young unemployed honest young men from small towns to embark on the path of thieving, dishonesty, looting etc. While Sharmila Tagore as the public prosecutor appeals for severe punishment to these young men to teach them a lesson for becoming a menace to the society, Rajesh Khanna as their defence lawyer pleads with the judge to consider the human aspect blaming the corrupt society, unfortunate circumstances and tragic incidents which force them to take this recourse and calls them ‘Badnaam Farishtey’ who need to be given a second chance in society.\n\nThe full film is a series of courtroom scenes with the incidents being shown in flashbacks. Though Sharmila Tagore comes up with a convincing performance, it is certainly a mystery as to why these two stars ever agreed to be part of such a B-grade film with third-rate production values and a dull team of actors. But for this blog it was a good film to write about…\n\nNargis as Defence Lawyer Rita in Awaara (1951)\n\nThis is perhaps one of the earliest instances of a female lawyer being shown in our cinema. The film starts with the courtroom scene where Nargis walks in to announce that she is going to defend Raj Kapoor in this case much against the wishes of Prithviraj Kapoor-the father-like figure who had brought her up. The film then proceeds to unfurl in a flashback with Nargis relating the story of Raj Kapoor’s life.\n\nAfter this, the courtroom scene is shown only towards the fag end of the film where Nargis pleads before the judge to take into consideration the horrendous circumstances which turn young boys into criminals and in this case, blames his father, Prithviraj Kapoor for abandoning his son at the time of birth. Needless to say, Raj Kapoor’s direction is flawless and Nargis’s acting simply brilliant. Such a gifted and natural actress like her is yet to be seen in Hindi Cinema.\n\nThere is a buzz that there is a role for a female lawyer in the upcoming biopic on cricketer Azharuddin titled Azhar. Slated to release later this year it has Emran Hashmi in the title role and either actress Nimrat Kaur or Lara Dutta is expected to play the role of the lawyer.\n\nBy\n\nSharada Iyer\n\nThe countdown begins…only one week left for December 18th…The audience waits with bated breath as two major, big-budget, star-studded films will hit the cinema halls simultaneously- director Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s historical romance-Bajirao Mastani starring Ranveer Singh, Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone , and director Rohit Shetty’s action-romance-Dilwale starring Shah Rukh Khan, Kajol, Varun Dhawan and Kriti Sannon.\n\nBoth directors are highly respected and admired for their special kind of cinema and have a commendable track-record of box-office hits. The promotional activities are in full swing and as both films have a lot at stake, the makers and artistes of both films are leaving no stone unturned to market their films and create as much hype as possible to raise the curiosity level and get that coveted record-breaking ‘first day collection’ and ‘first weekend collection’.\n\nThe trailers of both have been released a few weeks back and garnered a record number of hits within 24 hours and the songs have already become chartbusters…\n\nSame release date invariably leads to uncalled for but unavoidable comparisons of the films in question. So here goes…\n\nLet us look at the story first…\n\nBajirao Mastani is based on the real life of one of the greatest Peshwas of Maratha Empire- Peshwa Bajirao I (1700-1740), a brilliant Maratha general and one of our greatest historical war heroes who became prime minister to the fourth Maratha Chhatrapati – Shahuji Raje Bhosale when he was just 20 years of age and during his regime, he is said to have won all the 41 battles he took part in. While his first wife Kashibai was a Hindu, his second wife Mastani was half-Muslim due to which their relationship faced many a storm. The film focuses on the relationship between these three and this absorbing real-life drama has whipped up a lot of intrigue and interest in the film.\n\nOn the other hand, there doesn’t seem anything unusual about the story of Dilwale. It appears to be a typical Bollywood-style ‘masala’ entertainer. SRK and Varun play brothers and have their respective love-stories woven into the script. The focus is obviously more on the pairing of SRK and Kajol and seems to have a parting and reunion angle incorporated as well.\n\nComing to production values…\n\nFor director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, Bajirao Mastani is a culmination of his eleven-year old dream. One can imagine the passion and dedication that has gone into transforming his vision into celluloid. His penchant for detailing can be seen in the spectacular sets, grand battle scenes, brilliant music and magnificently choreographed dance-sequences which would be a visual treat on the big screen. The colourful costumes have been designed after a lot of painstaking research and utmost care has gone into every weave and design of the fabrics in order to recreate the authenticity of the era in question.\n\nOn the other hand, everything about the scenes of Dilwale in the trailer gives us a feeling of ‘deja-vu’ -awesome picture-perfect foreign locales of Bulgaria and Iceland, fast-paced chase sequences replete with cars flying and blown apart typical of all Rohit Shetty kind of films. Song sequences have nothing unique save for some imaginatively used VFX shots.\n\nPreparation for the role…\n\nTo get to play historical characters of 18th century and be part of such a lavishly mounted film is indeed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for any actor. It not only becomes a challenge to test his/her acting prowess but also entails a lot of patience, dedication and special preparation-both emotional and physical-to get under the skin of the character in terms of thought process, body language and dialogues apart from getting used to wearing those heavy costumes. All the actors have put in tremendous amount of hard work especially Ranveer(Bajirao I), Priyanka(Kashibai) and Deepika (Mastani).\n\nFor Dilwale, all the actors are just being themselves playing to the gallery by highlighting their plus points and taking care of their star-image. Nothing really challenging there for the actors involved.\n\nSongs and their Picturization…\n\nAfter Ram-Leela, director Sanjay Leela Bhansali once again dons the hat of a music director for Bajirao Mastani as well and has come up with an incredible variety of splendid songs and all of them have been picturized in a beautiful manner. I am posting a link to the video of the song ‘Pinga’ from the film, which is a ‘twin dance’ sequence featuring both the heroines dancing to a magnificently choreographed ‘lavani’ number.\n\nThis is probably the first time that such a dance sequence has two top heroines dancing together. Both Priyanka Chopra and Deepika Padukone not only look stunning but have danced like a dream. Incidentally, such ‘twin dance’ numbers are a very rare feature in today’s films (refer to my earlier blog-post https://myviewsonbollywood.wordpress.com/2015/07/ ). The director definitely deserves to be applauded for attempting something so different and difficult and coming up with an unforgettable number.\n\nThe second song ‘Deewaani Mastaani’ picturized on the lovely Deepika is also a beautifully shot dance number with a set designed on the lines of Mughal-e-Azam.\n\nThe third song- ‘Malhari’ comes across as a victory dance after perhaps one of Bajirao’s war triumphs. The drum beats, the tune, the lyrics and the pulsating choreography capture the joy and triumphant fervour that usually follows the aftermath of a war victory.\n\nTwo more songs- ‘Aayat’ -a mesmerizing romantic number with a little bit of qawaali, and ‘Gajanana’ a resonating prayer song, have had only the audio of the song released so far and are brilliant compositions.\n\nComing to Dilwale, here is the link to the most popular number from the film titled ‘Gerua’. Though melodious in tune, the director seems to have concentrated more on the stunning locales and made the duo stand in awkward poses behind waterfalls and atop dangerous mountains and even a broken plane to give us picture-perfect backdrops . Instead, if he had only focussed more on the lead pair’s chemistry, the result would have been magical. And pray, why is SRK wearing those blue shades? It looks as if he doesn’t want to look into his lady-love’s eyes…\n\nMaybe everyone involved is trying too hard to recreate the Raj-Simran magic of DDLJ. Let us hope that the film’s biggest USP does not end up being its biggest limitation…after all, 20 years is a long time and expecting to whip up the same magic could be really difficult…\n\nSimilar is the case with the other song –a duet ‘Janam Janam’- again picturized on SRK and Kajol. Sadly in some articles, this song is even being advertised as a tribute to Raj Kapoor-Nargis. Wish we could refrain from even mentioning any of our classics in a bid to catch the viewer’s attention…\n\nThe third song-‘Manma Emotion Jaage Re’ is not only a very ordinary number but also has a very irritating female voice singing a few lines for Kriti Sannon.\n\nCuriosity factor…\n\nBajirao Mastani has three of our current top stars Priyanka, Ranveer and Deepika –all charismatic and brilliant actors coming together for the first time and thereby lending an enigmatic appeal to this triangular love story.\n\nOn the other hand, Dilwale has the industry’s most loved iconic couple Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol coming together for the seventh time . Since their last outing was five years back ,the curiosity factor riding here is phenomenal.\n\nThough the pre-release buzz in the media is tilted more towards Dilwale thanks to ShahRukh Khan’s magical charisma and enormous fan-following, I feel everything about Bajirao Mastani is so novel and different that it scores in every respect over Dilwale. Only time will tell who will emerge as the winner…\n\nOn another note, one can’t help wondering as to why such big-budget films must compete with each other by releasing on the same day when there are 52 weeks in a year giving them ample time to space out their release. At times such clashes take a nasty turn because all this ruthless clamour for good cinema halls and vantage show timings only seem to give rise to unseemly bad blood between stars/producers/directors as well as unnecessary monetary losses for all parties involved. Even the audience is thrown in a quandary to choose between films.\n\nEarlier clashes down the years have seen one of the two films suffer because of this unhealthy competition. Take the case of director Farah Khan’s Om Shanti Om (OSO) vs director Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Saawariya in 2007. While the former was the launch-pad for Deepika Padukone and the latter the launch-pad for Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam, the presence of superstar SRK tilted the scales heavily in favour of OSO resulting in heavy losses for Saawariya. As a result both the directors stopped talking to each other for a long time.\n\nSimilarly in 2006, the SRK starrer Don, albeit being a shoddy remake of the classic original emerged the clear winner as compared to the Salman-Akshay-Preity Zinta starrer Jaaneman.\n\nIn 2012, the clash between YRF’s Jab Tak Hai Jaan and Devgn Films’ Son Of Sardar became quite ugly as Ajay Devgn dragged producer Aditya Chopra to court claiming that the latter had used his power and position to take away all the important cinema halls and show timings. Needless to say he not only lost the case but also incurred heavy losses.\n\nBut here the story goes deeper. In this case Aditya Chopra is said to have got even with Ajay Devgn because back in 1991, Ajay Devgn had won the battle when as a mere newcomer his debut film Phool Aur Kaante had met with resounding success while veteran Yash Copra’s Lamhe,which released on the same day had turned out to be a total washout.\n\nBut the ‘baap’ of all clashes will be witnessed during Eid in 2016 when SRK’s Raees will clash with Salman Khan’s Sultan. This would really be an interesting clash to watch out for…\n\nNo longer is anyone talking about who acted well because the only question doing the rounds is who made how many crores…\n\nBy\n\nSharada Iyer\n\nOur film industry has been very fortunate to have had some of the most brilliant child artistes who have given memorable performances in scores of films. These child-stars have endeared themselves to us with their spontaneity and natural acting. Coupled with their innate innocence and amazing confidence, they have effortlessly stolen the show from their seasoned co-stars on screen.\n\nDaisy Irani, Honey Irani, Baby Naaz, Baby Tabassum, Baby Farida, Baby Gowri, Wonder child-Bobby, Baby Guddu, Master Raju, Master Ratan, Master Sachin, Master Satyajeet, Master Alankar, Master Shahid, Master Tito, Junior Mehmood, etc., are some of the names which immediately come to our mind though there are many more who have been associated with our films. It is really difficult to comprehend how such small children could memorize such long dialogues and bring such perfect expressions and emote with so much feeling and understanding…\n\nThey have been an integral part of many of our popular social films and family dramas of the fifties, sixties, seventies and eighties. Often entire films have revolved around the character of the child artiste, for instance Pyaar Ki Pyaas revolved around Honey Irani, Nanha Farishta had Baby Rani in the title role, Mastana was all about ‘wonder child Bobby’, Boot Polish was the story of Baby Naaz and Master Ratan, Do Kaliyan had Baby Sonia in a classic double role, Majhli Didi had Master Sachin in a pivotal role, and more recently Bajrangi Bhaijan centred entirely around little Harshaali Malhotra.\n\nSometimes films started with or showed in flashback the childhood scenes of our heroes and heroines like Awaara, Sangam, Deedar, Muqaddar Ka Sikander, Satyam Shivam Sundaram, Afsana, Haathi Mere Saathi, and more recently Dhoom 3, etc. Some films have many children coming together as part of an ensemble cast in Brahmachari, Chillar Party, Parichay, Koi Mil Gaya, Jaagriti, Hum Hain Raahi Pyaar Ke, Ghar Ghar Ki Kahani, Bachpan, Raju Chacha, Mr India, etc., with all of them putting up a brilliant act due to perfect team work and unbelievable tuning and timing.\n\nAt times, they have not been given too much screen time yet were important to the plot thereby contributing to the whole film, eg., Mrinal Jadhav in the recent Drishyam, Sana Saeed in Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, Sarika in Satyakam, Daisy Irani in Dhool Ka Phool and Duniya Jhukta Nahin, Master Raju in Woh Saat Din, Junior Mehmood in Do Raaste, Master Alankar in Deewaar, ‘wonder child Bobby’ in Amar Prem, Sweeni Khera in Cheeni Kum,etc.\n\nMost of the popular child artistes became big stars of their time with a round-the-clock shooting schedule. Daisy Irani and Honey Irani with their wide innocent eyes and curly mop of hair were much in demand. Baby Naaz was the highest paid child actress of her time and even got international recognition when she was awarded a special merit certificate for her role in Boot Polish at the Cannes Festival that year. Similarly Junior Mehmood reached such dizzying heights of fame and popularity that at the height of his success he is said to have owned many imported cars like the big stars of his time. Some like Jugal Hansraj and Parzan Dastur became popular with just one film, viz., Masoom and Kuch Kuch Hota Hai, respectively.\n\nMany big stars of our industry started their career as child artistes and worked in a few films before moving on to adult roles like Meena Kumari, Madhubala, Nargis, Aruna Irani, Mumtaz, Mehmood, Jagdeep, Shashi Kapoor, etc. Some like Rishi Kapoor, Hrithik Roshan, Aamir Khan, Sanjay Dutt, etc., acted in just one or two films.\n\nSadly, all was not hunky-dory with the lives of all the successful child artistes. Some child-stars had a sad story of an overambitious mother or father who exploited them mercilessly and they were forced to become bread winners of their family. Baby Naaz is one such example. Her mother made her sign so many films that she could not attend school because of which she was rusticated and she was very bitter about it. Sarika also was a victim of an over-ambitious mother. Meena Kumari and Madhubala were exploited by their fathers and forced to work as their families depended on their income. Daisy Irani in one of her interviews has mentioned that sometimes she had been slapped or pinched on the sets so that she would be able to get natural tears for the required scene…\n\nBut a vast majority of our writers and directors have been very patient with the child artistes and had an uncanny knack of extracting superb performances from them. Director Chetan Anand deserves a special mention for capturing some touching and poignant moments of a one and a half year old child in his film Aakhri Khat, which remains a rare and unbeatable experiment by any director.\n\nHonestly there are so many terrific performances by various child artistes in a variety of films, that it is a really difficult task to list all of them at one go. This blog is just an attempt to highlight some outstanding acts which are my personal favourites:\n\nBaby Naaz and Master Ratan in Boot Polish (1954)\n\nIt is said that Raj Kapoor scouted at least twelve schools in Mumbai before zeroing in on Baby Naaz to get the perfect child actress to play the main role and what a find she turned out to be! Her outstanding act as the little orphan slum girl ill-treated by her aunt is heart-rending and remains a classic act to this day. Master Ratan as her elder brother also gives an equally brilliant performance.\n\nDaisy Irani in Bandish (1955)\n\nThis is a very unusual film and basically revolves around Ashok Kumar and Daisy Irani. Daisy Irani plays a boy in the film and after a chance encounter with Ashok Kumar in a park one evening the child refuses to leave him as he firmly believes that Ashok Kumar is his Dad. Ashok on the other hand tries his best to dump him and get rid of him .This results in many interesting confrontation scenes between them which are both funny and poignant. Meena Kumari breezes through in a small but light-hearted role. Little Daisy Irani is simply brilliant in the film and gives an equal ‘takkar’ to veteran Ashok Kumar .\n\nDaisy Irani and Honey Irani in Zameen Ke Taare (1960)\n\nIn this Chandulal Shah production both the sisters play the role of boys who are friends. While Daisy Irani is very rich and has a stepmother, Honey loses his mother because the father beats her everyday. Both of them set out in search of God to request him to give back Honey’s mother. Thereafter the movie basically deals with the various incidents that happen during the course of their eventful journey. Both of them come up with a commendable performance.\n\nHoney Irani in Pyaar Ki Pyaas (1961)\n\nHoney Irani plays a little orphan girl who is adopted by a childless couple. Initially life is like a fairy-tale for the little girl but trouble starts brewing when the mother gives birth to her own child after which Honey Irani is completely ignored. Her performance is top-notch and the character leaves a deep impression in the minds of the audience.\n\nMaster Babloo in Main Chup Rahoongi (1962)\n\nThis is the Hindi version of the Tamil film Kalathoor Kannamma with which superstar Kamal Haasan had made his debut in films at the tender age of four. Well! The Hindi version had Master Babloo as a child artiste and his performance was simply outstanding. His natural expressions and dialogue delivery outmatched all his adult co-stars- Sunil Dutt, Meena Kumari, Nana Palsikar, Raj Mehra, etc.\n\n(An interesting trivia about the film is that it also had a Telugu version. In all the three versions there is a prayer which is sung in the orphanage by the children. The tune is the same and the meaning of the words is also more or less the same. However, the deity in front of whom they are singing changes in accordance with the language/region they represent. In the Hindi version it is Lord Krishna, in the Tamil version it is Lord Kartikeya (also called Lord Murugan) and in the Telugu version it is Lord Balaji. For readers who are interested here are the links to the three versions:\n\nHindi\n\nTamil\n\nTelugu\n\nMaster Sachin in Majhli Didi (1967)\n\nDirector Hrishikesh Mukherjee manages to extract an unbelievably brilliant performance from a very young Master Sachin. In the film, the child first loses his mother tragically and later ends up being ill-treated by his step-sister- Lailta Pawar (in one of her most venomous screen avatars ever). His yearning for maternal love and his unique bonding with Meena Kumari (in the title role) tugs our heart and forms the crux of the film\n\nBaby Sonia in Do Kaliyaan (1968)\n\nI remember seeing this film on big screen when I was very small yet it left such a powerful impact that to this day it remains one of my favourite films and personally I feel one of the finest children’s film made in our industry. Baby Sonia (Neetu Singh) is outstanding in a double role and brings about the subtle differences in the mannerism and demeanour of the two sisters. After the divorce of their parents, one grows up with the father and one with the mother. Initially they fight a lot in school but later become friends and decide to interchange places to get to know the other parent and experience the love they had been missing. There is a scene in which the interchanged Baby Sonia meets her mother for the first time. The way she calls out ‘Maa’ with so much emotion and expression and runs to Mala Sinha to hug her is just amazing . The tone in the child’s voice not only conveys the sheer joy of the child meeting her mother for the first time but also the sadness that she had been away from this love for so long…\n\nMaster Mahesh Kothare in Raja aur Runk (1968)\n\nThis is a colourful costume drama based on Mark Twain’s ‘The Prince and The Pauper’. Two look-alike children are born on the same day and at the same time but into different families –one is a prince and the other a poor commoner. They meet each other by chance and decide to have some adventure by exchanging places. Master Mahesh is a delight to watch in both the roles and delivers a heart-warming performance.\n\nBaby Rani in Nanha Farishta (1969)\n\nA small child is kidnapped by three dacoits after killing her rich parents and looting their wealth. How the child’s innocence and her friendship with the dacoits bring about a transformation in their characters forms the crux of the film. Baby Rani delivers a remarkable performance.\n\nBobby in Mastana (1970)\n\nThe story revolves around the unique friendship between Mehmood -an illiterate poor man and Bobby-a rich child neglected by her parents and ill-treated by her governess. Her effortless expressions and natural dialogue-delivery rightfully won her the title of ‘wonder child’.\n\nMaster Sachin, Junior Mehmood and Master Shahid in Bachpan (1970)\n\nThe story revolves around three children yearning for parental love in a village who become emotionally attached to a toy-seller because he is kind to them and also because he has lost his own children in a flood. When he is accused of a murder he has not committed, these three kids come to his rescue as they had inadvertently witnessed the real murderer committing the crime. The story had enough juice to extract terrific performances from the child artistes.\n\nMaster Mahesh and Junior Mehmood in Ghar Ghar Ki Kahani (1970)\n\nOne of the really good children’s films to have been made, the film teaches the value of hard-earned money and how important it is to spend it wisely. While Master Mahesh comes up with an outstanding performance and gives tough competition to veteran Balraj Sahni, Junior Mehmood is brilliant in a role which has a comical touch.\n\nMaster Jugal Hansraj in Masoom (1983)\n\nWith his wide innocent eyes and a beautiful face, there could not have been a better choice for the role of the child who is hated by Shabana as he reminds her of her husband’s one-night stand with another woman. For no fault of his, he is treated badly and the pain and anguish he brings to his eyes are just too good and have left an indelible mark in every cine-goer’s heart.\n\nAyesha Kapoor in Black (2005)\n\nThe 11-year old child actor Ayesha Kapur came up with a stunning performance as the blind Michelle McNally – playing the younger version of Rani Mukherjee in Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Black. She effortlessly brings out the frustration and anger of having to cope up with blindness as well as the joy when she finds a ray of hope with her new teacher Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nMaster Darsheel Saffrey in Taare Zameen Par (2007)\n\nLittle Darsheel Saffrey plays the role of a dyslexic boy and comes up with a heart-tugging brilliant performance. The subtle nuances in his expressions are top-class and will remain one of the most challenging roles written for a child artiste.\n\nMaster Harsh Mayar in I Am Kalam (2010)\n\nA superb film dealing with poverty, illiteracy, child-labour, self-belief, and survival of the human spirit is brought to life by the earnest and winning performance of the child artiste Harsh Mayar, who won several awards for this film.\n\nParth Balerao in Bhootnath Returns (2014)\n\nThis youngster is so confident in the film that he makes Superstar Amitabh Bachchan look like an ordinary actor. His dialogue delivery is very natural and he also gets to mouth some great one-liner jokes. In the film the child doesn’t realize Amitabh is a ghost and treats him as some magician friend and their scenes together are superb. It is indeed admirable how this young child artiste is so unaffected by the presence of a towering actor like Amitabh…\n\nHarshaali Malhotra in Bajrangi Bhaijan (2015)\n\nReleased in July this year, this movie created a sensation by breaking every box-office record. As the mute girl separated from her mother by a quirk of fate and left behind in a new country, she puts up an outstanding performance. Her expressions take us through a gamut of emotions from helplessness and fear to joy and excitement which spoke volumes of the talent of this little girl. To share screen space with Salman Khan and Nawazuddin Siddiqui and yet manage to be the scene-stealer and that too without uttering any dialogues is not a small thing at all.\n\nIrrespective of whether it is a mega-budget film with big stars or a small budget Children’s film, they always leave an indelible mark in the role allotted to them. Hats off to all the writers and directors who gave them ample scope to display their skill which is why each one of them is remembered to this day for his/her outstanding work…\n\nHere are links to some more popular numbers picturized on our child artistes:\n\nDeedar\n\nDo Kaliyaan\n\nTaare Zameen Par\n\nHere is the link to Part II of the post :\n\n(https://myviewsonbollywood.wordpress.com/2016/11/17/the-lovable-child-artistes-of-hindi-cinema-ii/)\n\nBy Sharada Iyer\n\nThis post is a walk down memory lane to visit some songs belonging to a unique category in our films, which can be referred to as- ‘Twin Dances’. The dance sequences usually involved two or more female dancers performing more or less the same dance-movements side-by-side in unison.\n\nThis trend not only gave us some very melodious numbers but visually also it was a treat to watch the perfectly synchronized dance steps of the artistes involved. One cannot help but salute the makers who came up with such an idea, the lyricists who wrote those lovely lyrics, the music composers who gave us priceless compositions, the dance directors for the enjoyable choreography and finally the dancers themselves for putting so much life into their dances…\n\nIt was in the fifties and sixties that ‘Twin Dancing’ numbers became very popular. Apart from bringing together the singing giants Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhonsle in many of these priceless numbers we also had the good fortune of listening to some unique combinations like Lata -Minoo Purushottam, Lata-Geeta Dutt, Asha-Usha, Asha-Shamshad Begum,etc.\n\nIt is not possible to list all such dances in one blog. However, I have tried to include many of the important ones and some for their unique aspects.\n\nIn 1955 came a film Azaad starring Dilip Kumar and Meena Kumari. It was a remake of the 1954 Tamil film Malaikallan. The Tamil version had a synchronised dance number by two sisters, Sai and Subbulakshmi which became very popular and the makers may have decided to retain the dancing sisters in the Hindi version also. They were very popular for their sheer exuberance, expression, speed, precision, body control, grace and effortlessness. They danced in perfect synchronization and seemed to merge effortlessly with the song and were referred to as ‘pambara sahodarigal’ or ‘spinning-top’ sisters.\n\nThough they started in Tamil films, they have a string of hit songs in Hindi films as well. The famous songs ‘Aplam Chaplam …’ and ‘Balliye Ni Balliye…’, both from Azaad featured the dancing duo for the first time in Hindi films. While the first song has them dressed similarly, in the second song, one of them is dressed as a male and the other a female. As far as melody is concerned, these songs composed by maestro C Ramchandra and sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhonsle remain unbeatable till date in this genre. Enjoy both these numbers:\n\nIn 1956, the duo were back again, this time dancing to a classic Lata-Asha number from Chori-Chori -‘Man Bhavan Ke Sang Jaaye Gori…’. The song is picturised during the wedding sequence of Nargis when she is thinking of Raj Kapoor but getting ready to marry Pran.\n\nThe 1956 film Halaaku starring Ajit, Pran and Meena Kumari had a lovely number again by Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhonsle, ‘Aji Chale Aao…’, this time picturised on Helen and Minoo Mumtaz. Lyrics by Shailendra are set to tune by Shankar Jaikishen.\n\nIn the 1958 costume drama Yahudi directed by Bimal Roy, Geeta Dutt joins Lata Mangeshkar to sing the lovely number ‘Bechain Dil Khoi Si Nazar…’ picturized on the two dancing divas of our film industry – Cuckoo and Helen. The two of them look great together and dance with perfect understanding to make this Shailendra-Shankar Jaikishen song a memorable one.\n\nThe two dancing divas get together again in the 1958 laugh-riot Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi. This time they dance to a lovely mujra ‘Hum Tumhare Hain…’ displaying their prowess in Kathak . The song is written by Majrooh Sultanpuri, composed by S D Burman and sung by a unique combination of AshaBhonsle and Sudha Malhotra.\n\nHere is a song in this category shot outdoors for a change and this beautiful number sung by Lata and Asha is from Shammi Kapoor’s hit film in 1962-Professor. Shot in the picturesque backdrop of Kashmir, it has the heroine Kalpana and a starlet Praveen Chaudhary dancing joyfully to the song, ‘Koi Aayega Aayega Aayega…’, composed by Shankar Jaikishen and written by Hasrat Jaipuri.\n\nIf the 1963 costume drama Shikari is still remembered today it is because of the immortal music and memorable songs composed by G S Kohli, an unsung composer of our industry. The scintillating choreography and the energetic and effortless dancing by Helen and Ragini in the number ‘Tumko Piya , Dil Diya…’ makes it one of the all-time best dance songs of Hindi Cinema.\n\nThe same film Shikari had another beautiful composition by G S Kohli sung by Asha Bhonsle and Usha Mangeshkar and picturized on Madhumati and an unknown dancer. Though the dance is not as energetic as the more popular Helen-Ragini number, this song has a charm of its own.\n\nAnother film in 1963 which had a popular ‘twin dance’ number was the super-hit Parasmani. Written by Asad Bhopali, the musical duo of Laxmikant Pyarelal came up with a fast-paced and catchy number ‘Hansta Hua Noorani Chehra…’ sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Kamal Barot. Picturized on two unknown dancers, the song remains a veritable treat to watch even today . Incidentally, “Parasmani” was the first released movie for music directors Laxmikant Pyarelal and proved to be very lucky for them.\n\nIn 1963, Sai-Subbulakshmi had another fabulous dance number in Bharosa, ‘Dhadka O Dil Dhadka…’set to a superb composition by Ravi and sung once again by Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhonsle\n\nChitralekha in 1964 had a unique number. While the heroine Meena Kumari is sitting in her special quarters and playfully singing to her lover Pradeep Kumar sitting next to her, there are four dancers-two sets of ‘Twin Dancers’- who are dancing in the background and the effect is beautiful The lilting composition ‘Ae Ri Jaane Na Doongi…’ penned by Sahir Ludhyanavi and set to music by Roshan is sung by Lataji.\n\nIn 1964 we had another superb musical film Jahanara which had a ‘Twin Damce’ number- ‘Jab Jab Tumhe Bhulaya Tum Aur Yaad Aaye…’. Penned by Rajendra Kishen the music was by Madan Mohan. Sung by Lata and Asha this was picturized on a grand scale in the court of Empress Jahanara played by Mala Sinha. The dancers were Minoo Mumtaz and a very young Aruna Irani.\n\nHere is a unique dance in this category. This song ‘Jab do dil ho bechain natija pyar nikalta hai…’ is from the 1966 film Akalmand directed by Roop Shorey and has Kishore Kumar and I S Johar dressed up as women and actually doing a synchronized dance number!!! The song composed by O P Nayyar is sung by Asha Bhonsle and Shamshad Begum. Only Kishore Kumar is capable of pulling off a stunt like this and actually have Ashaji sing for him. Though the video quality is not very good, it is a must-watch for all Kishore Kumar fans…\n\n1966 had another Lata- Asha gem this time from the film Dulhan Ek Raat Ki and picturised on Helen and Lakshmi Chaya- ‘Hamaar Kaha Maano,Rajaji…’ . Written by Raja Mehndi Ali Khan the music here is by Madan Mohan.\n\n‘Huzurewaala, jo ho ijaazat, toh hum yeh saare jahan se keh de…’ is another brilliant song composed by O P Nayyar in 1967 for the film Yeh Raat Phir Na Aayegi . Here Helen is joined by her look-alike Madhumati and for a change the song is set in a club that gives a chance for the dancers to wear western outfit and the viewers get to enjoy a completely different kind of dance. The beginning tune of this song is superb and Asha Bhonsle’ s vocals have a haunting quality in this song…\n\nO P Nayyar created magic again in the 1967 film CID 909 for a song penned by Aziz Kashmiri. The song ‘Dhadka Toh Hoga Dil Zaroor…’ is sung by Asha Bhonsle and Kamal Barot and picturized on Mumtaz and a dancer Meenaxi. They are joined for a stanza by Feroz Khan. Here the ‘Twin’dancers are joined by a third dancer for a while.\n\nThis is a song from the 1972 Rajesh Khanna-Sadhna starrer Dil Daulat Duniya which had Sadhna, Helen and Bela Bose teaming together to give us this catchy number ‘Deep Jale Dekho…’.Written by Verma Malik and composed by Shankar Jaikishen the song is sung by Asha Bhonsle, Usha Mangeshkar and Rekha Jaikar.\n\nIn 1973, came a gem of a song form the film Daag, the first film under the Yash-Raj banner. Written by Sahir and set to tune by ever dependable duo of Laxmikant-Pyarelal the song is sung by Lata Mangeshkar and Minoo Purushottam. This ‘twin dance’ like the one in Professor, is a rare number as it is shot outdoors. Some energetic dancing by Padma Khanna and an unknown dancer make this song unique and memorable.\n\nAfter a long gap, in 1989 came the super-hit film Tridev which had a scintillating number – ‘Gajar ne kiya hai Ishaara…’ and was picturized on all three heroines- Madhuri Dixit, Sonam and Sangeeta Bijlani. The song was a big hit and the fast-paced choreography remains a treat to watch even today. The music is by Kalyanji-Anandji –Viju Shah and sung by Sadhna Sargam, Sapna Muukherjee and Alka Yagnik. This is again a rare instance of a synchronized dance number in a climax sequence…\n\nIn 2002, director Sanjay Leela Bansali got Madhuri Dixit and Aishwarya Rai for a fabulous dance number in Devdas. Written by Nusrat Badr and composed by Ismail Durbar the song-‘Dola Re, Dola Re…’ picturised on a lavish scale and having lots of background dancers as well, formed a major highlight of the film.\n\nIf rumours are to be believed, Sanjay Leela Bhansali (SLB) has done it again after 13 years. In his upcoming magnum opus Bajirao Mastani expected to be released on 18th December 2015, a special ‘Lavani’ dance number with a mix of folk and classical dance is being picturized on both the heroines Deepika Padukone and Priyanka Chopra. Both the actresses are putting in tremendous hard work and long hours of practice to come up with perfect synchronisation.\n\nSLB needs to be lauded for this effort and knowing the director’s penchant for majestic song sequences involving grandiose sets, colourful costumes and foot-tapping music this song is sure to be a winner.\n\nToday’s films do not offer much scope for different genres of music like ‘Lori’ (lullaby), ‘Bhajan’ (prayer), qawwaali (a special type of group number), etc. But we do have ‘Item Number’. At least once in a while our film-makers can think of including a ‘Twin Dancing’ ‘Item Number’ with well-choreographed dances instead of the vulgar ones in vogue and have them picturized on top actresses. Not only would this be a novel idea, it would also bring together some of current lot of top singers and top stars.\n\nAt least this way this genre could be kept alive otherwise it seems to be on the brink of extinction…\n\nBy Sharada Iyer\n\nThe box-office success as well as critical acclaim of recent biopics Paan Singh Tomar, Bhaag Milka Bhaag and Mary Kom celebrating the spirit and determination of our sportspersons seems to have spawned a plethora of biopics in our industry. We are attacking this genre with a new found vigour and enthusiasm.\n\nIn fact this year on 23rd October, 2015, the biopic on our very own Mahendra Singh Dhoni, Indian Cricket Captain is going to hit the theatres. Titled M S Dhoni: The Untold Story, the film is directed by Neeraj Pandey and young Sushant Singh Rajput will be essaying the role of the Indian Captain while Alia Bhatt will play his wife Sakshi. The link below shows the stars who will be playing the other members of the Indian squad.\n\n13th May 2016 will see the release of Azhar, the biopic on cricketer Mohammad Azharuddin and will have Emran Hashmi in the title role. The film is being produced by Ekta Kapoor and directed by Tony D’Souza. The film also stars Prachi Desai.\n\nOn 14th August, 2015, a biopic on the life of a freedom fighter Gour Hari Das is releasing. After fighting against the British rule six decades ago, Gaur Hari Das, 80, fought with the Indian government for 32 years to get his freedom fighter’s certificate. Now, his struggle to get recognised as a freedom fighter has been caught on celluloid. The film titled Gour Hari Dastan has been directed by Ananth Mahadevan and will have Vinay Pathak essaying the role of this octogenarian.\n\nOn August 21st,2015, Ketan Mehta’s Manjhi – The Mountain Man will hit the theatres. It tells the incredible story of a poor labourer Dashrath Manjhi, who took 22 years to carve a path out of a mountain in the Gehlour hills, Bihar, to lay a road. In 1959, Manjhi’s wife, Falguni Devi, was grievously hurt when a boulder from the mountain crashed on her, and despite best efforts she could not be given medical treatment in time to save her as the road from Gehlaur to Wazirganj,where the nearest hospital lay, was 80 km long. When he finished the task, the distance had reduced to 13 km. The brilliant actor Nawazuddin Siddique will be essaying the role and from the looks of the trailer, the film promises to be deserving tribute to this amazing son of the soil.\n\nIn the biopic titled Neerja Bhanot, actress Sonam Kapoor brings to life the incredible courage and gallantry displayed by the 23-year old air-hostess Neerja Bhanot , who died while saving the passengers on board Pan Am 73 flight (Bombay-Karachi-Frankfurt-New York). Neerja was killed in the shootout following the hijack at Karachi International Airport on September 5, 1986. Posthumously, she became the youngest recipient of India’s highest civilian award for bravery, the Ashok Chakra. While Shabana Azmi will be seen playing the role of Neerja’s mother, music composer cum singer Shekhar Ravjiani (of Vishal and Shekhar fame) has been roped in to play the lead opposite Sonam. This film is also slated to release later this year or early next year.\n\n18th December will see the release of director Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s lavishly mounted Indian historical Bajirao Mastani. The film narrates the story of the Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao I and his second wife Mastani with Ranveer Singh and Deepika Padukone portraying the main protagonists. Priyanka Chopra in the role of Kashibai, Bajirao’s first wife, forms the third angle of the triangle.\n\nDANGAL– is a biopic where Aamir Khan plays the role of wrestler Mahavir Singh Phogat, the father of two female wrestlers Geeta and Babita who won gold and silver medals, respectively, at the Commonwealth Games in Delhi, 2010. Mahavir also happened to be their coach. The movie directed by Nitesh Tiwari proposes to capture the story of the struggle, determination and success of Mahavir, who dared to chase his dream to see his daughters as champion wrestlers despite inhibitions from society.\n\nDirector Omung Kumar ,who directed Mary Kom last year will be starting work on his next biopic titled Sarabjit , which will trace the struggles of Dalbir Kaur (to be played by Aishwarya Rai Bachchan) who runs from pillar to post to get her younger brother Sarabjit (to be played by Randeep Hooda) out of the Pakistani jail. Sarabjit Singh was an Indian National who was convicted and sentenced to death by a court in Pakistan in 1991 for his alleged involvement in the 1990 serial bomb blasts in Lahore and Faisalabad that killed 14 people. Sarabjit claimed that he was a farmer and a victim of mistaken identity, who strayed into Pakistan from his village located on the border, three months after the bombings. After languishing in the Pakistani jail for 23 years, he was finally killed by his prison inmates on 26th April, 2013.\n\nIn Ketan Mehta’s Indo-British production Jhansi Ki Rani, Kangna Ranaut will be essaying the role of the warrior queen and actor Hugh Grant is being considered for the character of General Hugh Rose who witnessed her legendary bravery in 1858.\n\nCharles Aur Main is a movie that revolves around Charles Shobraj, a French serial killer of Indian origin, who preyed on Western tourists throughout Southeast Asia during the 1970s. Randeep Hooda will be seen in the title role of the enigmatic con man and vicious killer.\n\nIn the pipeline:\n\nDirector Rohit Jugraj has approached Dara Singh’s son Vindoo with a project with Akshay Kumar playing Dara Singh. Interestingly there is another Dara Singh bio-pic in the pipeline, this one in Punjabi. The final decision has yet to be taken.\n\nFilmmaker Karan Johar has bought the rights to make a biopic on hockey legend Dhyan Chand. The producer-director took to Twitter to announce that he has the rights to depict the story of the greatest hockey star Dhyan Chand. Though there were rumours of Shah Rukh Khan bring roped in to play the lead, no official announcement regarding the cast has been made.\n\nArjun Rampal will be seen in a film titled Daddy which will be produced by Mandar Dalvi. The actor is said to portray the role inspired from gangster turned politician Arun Gawli in the film.\n\nDirector Raj Kumar Hirani is all set to make a biopic on the actor Sanjay Dutt and is keen to cast Ranbir Kapoor in the title role. This idea does seem very strange – Firstly what is so inspiring about Sanjay Dutt to make a biopic on him at this stage of his life and secondly Ranbir being a star in his own right, would he manage to look convincing as Sunjay Dutt!!!\n\nRanbir Kapoor is also being roped in to play the title role in the Kishore Kumar biopic being planned by director Anurag Basu. Ranbir’s physique is nowhere close to Kishore Kumar’s and just putting on weight is not enough to reprise the enigmatic personality of the one and only Kishore Kumar.\n\nThere are also talks of Vidya Balan being offered three biopics – M S Subbalakshmi, Suchitra Sen and Benazir Bhutto.\n\nKangna Ranaut is being considered by director Tigmanshu Dhulia for a biopic on the late actress Meena Kumari and the film would be an adaptation of Vinod Mehta’s book ‘Meena Kumari: The Classic Biography’. She has also reportedly been signed by director Hansal Mehta for a biopic rumoured to be based on a mountaineer.\n\nActress Sonakshi Sinha is all set to shed her glamorous avatar to essay the role of Amrita Pritam- a biopic being planned on the poetess.\n\nActress Rani Mukherjee is all set to bring to life the character of Begum Samru, an 18th century nautch girl who went on to become the ruler of Sardhana.\n\nTennis star Sania Mirza has expressed that she would like actress Deepika Padukone to play her in her biopic whenever it will be made.\n\nBiopics require tremendous research and authenticity to bring to life the spirit and essence of the character. Too much cinematic liberty may kill the very motive behind such ambitious projects. Too much emphasis on the bold scenes between Randeep Hooda and Nandana Sen in the publicity posters kept the audience away from Rang Rasiya, the brilliantly made biopic on our great genius Raja "
