        "text": "Bob Saget, the actor-comedian known for his role as beloved single dad Danny Tanner on the sitcom Full House Â and as the wisecracking host of Americaâs Funniest Home Videos, has died, according to authorities in Florida. He was 65.\n\nThe Orange County, Florida, sheriffâs office was called Sunday about an âunresponsive manâ in a hotel room at the Ritz-Carlton in Orlando, according to a sheriffâs statement on Twitter.\n\nâThe man was identified as Robert Sagetâ and death was pronounced at the scene, the statement said, adding that detectives found âno signs of foul play or drug use in this case.\n\nSaget was in Florida as part of his I Donât Do Negative Comedy Tour, according to his Twitter feed.\n\nFellow comedians and friends praised Saget not only for his wit, but his kindness.\n\nâI am broken. I am gutted. I am in complete and utter shock. I will never ever have another friend like him,â wrote John Stamos, who co-starred with Saget on âFull House. âI love you so much Bobby.â\n\nNorman Lear, who called Saget a close friend, wrote the comedian âwas as lovely a human as he was funny. And to my mind, he was hilarious.â\n\nâIn often a ruthless business he was historically not just hilarious but more importantly one of the kindest human beings I ever met in my career,â actor Richard Lewis wrote on Twitter.\n\nSagetâs publicist didnât immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nSaget, also the long-time host of Americaâs Funniest Home Videos, played squeaky clean Danny Tanner, a widower and father to three young girls, on Full House, the ABC sitcom that also brought fame to the Olsen twins when it debuted 1987.\n\nSaget the stand-up showed his flip side with what become a much-talked-about cameo in the 2005 documentary The AristocratsÂ _ in which 100 comics riffed on the worldâs dirtiest joke _ that revealed his notoriously filthy sense of humor."
