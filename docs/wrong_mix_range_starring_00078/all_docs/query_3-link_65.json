        "text": "This article explores new forms of serial structure found in transmedia story worlds, with particular attention to the innovations of amateur transmedia works. Although the term transmedia has most often been associated only with corporate media at the center, taking amateur works as the paradigmatic example produces new insights into the affordances of digital technology, beyond the industry’s limitations, namely how transmedia creativity can function in the absence of the need to remain marketable, to maintain a coherent brand, and to work within a corporate family of conglomerated media companies. This study thereby focuses on fan fiction, art, and “vids”, a form of remix video collage, to demonstrate how contemporary amateur production interacts with professional content, but also produces its own type of complex narration through unique forms, aesthetics, and story structures, likewise encouraging alternate reception practices as a result. This article identifies at least three types of transmedial seriality elucidated by studying amateur fan media. First, fan works emphasize the increasingly complex nature of seriality in all transmedia and the way in which serial effects do not vanish, but increasingly depend upon the viewer’s choices. Secondly, fan works create their own kind of flexible and multiple serial effects wherein meaning does not depend on consuming a specific sequence of narratives, but instead upon reading any collection of narratives within larger cycles or tropes to assemble a sense of flowing norms, genres, and preferences. Finally, fan works also uniquely analyze and reconfigure the serial effects of tropes found not only across the transmedia components of individual stories, but also across the breadth of popular culture. By remixing and reimagining repeated structures of representation, fan works often call attention to latent forms of seriality within popular culture as a collective whole.\n\nThis thesis concerns the synthesis of two discourses which, at first glance, might seem quite disparate. On one hand is cinephilia, currently emerging as a type of self-reflexive love of film. Writers like Christian Keathley have begun, in the last decade or so, to outline an attitude to and discourse about film which is both adoring and analytical. In my first chapter, I look at the origins of cinephilia: we see how it emerged in France in the middle of the last century, notably on the pages of Cahiers du Cinema, as a style of writing about film which was both highly enthusiastic and intellectually engaged. We look at how it functioned and what made it different from what had been before. I go on to outline Willeman&#39;s idea of the cinephiliac moment, where a writer seems to fixate upon a certain passage of filmic text. How this discourse functioned and continues to function today is then examined at some length. The second chapter of this thesis concerns fandom, fan studies, and...\n\n\"Much can be made of the influence of new technologies in shaping spaces for fandom, and in shaping the nature of fandoms, leading to essays on the development of online fan communities and the changes wrought by web 2.0. However, the intertextuality of fan experience does not remain on the screen. Fan ‘craft’, such as the knitting patterns to replicate the Firefly/Serenity character Jayne’s hat, involves the use of older technology to reshape the fictional into the physical, leading to intense debates about copyright and authorship. Bringing a physical item across the boundary from the fictional realm in this manner disrupts the dissemination of cultural items as monetised commodity. This paper examines the ways in which new and old technologies are used by fans and producers alike to mould and shape an intertextual world, in which the boundaries between real and unreal, physical and immaterial, are increasingly blurred. Savvy producers are recognising the meta-textuality of self-reflexive fan culture: before the release of Iron Man 2 a corporate site went live for a subsidiary of the fictional Stark Industries and ‘recruiters’ for the firm attended San Diego ComicCon. However, this strategy disrupts the traditional advertising modes; the fictional corporation logo on a t-shirt does not necessarily directly link the uninitiated to a purchasable product such as a film or book. Memorabilia advertising aspects of a fictional world, such as promotional t-shirts for fictional businesses, are popular in cult fandom; encouraging the market for collectibles, and the display of insider knowledge, whilst preserving a distance from the corporate media who own the rights to the texts themselves. Drawing on Michael Saler’s analysis of the ‘literary prehistory of virtual reality’ this paper suggests that cult fandom uses the widest rage of technology available to its practitioners to establish and maintain a disenchantment/reenchantment dialectic. By embedding the physical manifestations of their favourite fictional world into their IRL existence, fans are not simply living the escapist fantasies of modern Walter Mitty’s. In fact, fan craft activity and independent purchasing reshapes the world to resemble their preferred fictional environment, whilst attempting to defy or reinterpret models of ownership and authority. \"\n\nIn light of the Fan Studies Network's statement regarding fan studies being overrun with whiteness, we are in a unique position to engage in scholarship that challenges the overwhelmingly white and Global North-centric structures that define how we study fan cultures. Multidisciplinarity, which may be understood as disciplines laid side by side, should be contrasted with interdisciplinarity, which requires true dialogue. Despite recent field-shifting work by fan studies scholars such as Bertha Chin, Lori Morimoto, Rukmini Pande, and Rebecca Wanzo, more work needs to be done to both acknowledge and build on current research in transcultural fandom. In a dialogue that reflects the progress of our own striving toward interdisciplinary and transcultural work in fan studies, we seek to demonstrate a possible way forward for the field of fan studies to become more truly interdisciplinary and transcultural in its focus.\n\nThe success of a contemporary fantasy production such as Game of Thrones (2011–) is heavily dependent upon the use of visual effects to bring its amazing world to the screen. This chapter will attempt to interrogate such creations in order to establish a conceptual rapport between the fantasy genre and the psychoanalytic theory of fantasy. The most compelling account of psychoanalytic fantasy and film comes from Todd McGowan (The Real Gaze, 2007), who offers a four-fold typology of cinema: fantasy, desire, integration and intersection, and it is to this third category that I will attend. However, where McGowan finds a dishonest experience in a cinema of “integration” that conflates fantasy with desire, and where he also passes over the fantasy genre without much consideration, I will, instead, examine the role of computer-generated imagery in the creation of contemporary fantasy film and television as a properly Lacanian “fantasmatic supplement” (the necessary presence of fantasy in our relation to the world) at the formal level. I will suggest that it is, crucially, through the combination of live action with visual effects that a series such as Game of Thrones presents us, as spectators, with an aesthetic experience closely approximating psychoanalytic reality (i.e. how psychoanalysis theorises everyday experience). By paying close attention to “making of” featurettes I will suggest that they offer a particularly Lacanian perspective: laying bare the processes behind the creation of sequences such as The Battle for The Wall in Game of Thrones in order to demonstrate the ways in which the realms of desire (limitation, incompleteness; live action) and of fantasy (plenitude, wholeness; VFX) work together in order to constitute the world. In sum, this chapter will offer a reappraisal of the current neo-Lacanian approach to film theory in order to claim, ultimately, that there is more reality in fantasy than in other, so-called, “realist” modes of film and television.\n\nThrough the in-depth analysis of a single fanwork, Luminosity’s concept-vid Scooby Road (2005), made with images appropriated from the acclaimed TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer, this paper will investigate the strong and complex relationship between fan communities and media. A vid is a form of remix that consists in appropriating clips from movies or TV shows, and setting them to music. The author of the remixed work, the vidder, uses editing strategies in order to comment upon the sources, criticize them or praise them. Building on the concept of fandom ecology, and providing an overview of the main characteristics of the vidding community, this paper will focus on how the shared knowledge of both the original work and of fannish interpretations of such work, combined with fannish conventions and modes of media consumption, shape fandom creative productions. After examining the relevance of Buffy the Vampire Slayer for the vidding community and its history, we will then focus o...\n\nThis volume brings together a variety of critical perspectives in the rapidly growing field of fan studies. We have engaged with multiple disciplines and theorists in order to explore the various methods of fan production and research. Whether fans engage in the real-world, online, or define themselves by their lack of engagement, the ability of fans to participate and share their enthusiasms with one another is one of the most striking and intriguing features of the fandom phenomena. Fan communities have directed their remarkable fervour towards charitable causes, bringing television shows and book characters back from the dead, and honing their creative skills before pursuing fandom-worthy material of their own. We explore fandom as a social space and constructed identity, fuelled by talented creators and enthusiastic consumers, and building on the global connectedness born from the digital age.\n\nLiterary theorist Gérard Genette defined paratext as those things in a published work (the author's name, preface, illustrations) that accompany the text. He described the paratext as a form of ‘airlock’ between the reader and the textual world, an influence that “is at the service of a better reception for the text and a more pertinent reading of it” (1997). Jonathan Gray, however, believes the paratext “does not stand between reader and text as much as it infringes upon the text, and invades its meaning-making process” (2006). He argues that ‘official’ paratexts such as episode guides, cast and crew interviews, games, trailers and DVD commentaries inform viewers’ knowledge of the text and give us ways of looking, and frames for understanding or engaging, with it (2010). Gray also, however, refers to fan-created paratexts. Citing fan fiction, fan film and video, ‘filk’ and fan art, amongst others, he argues that these also play a role in “challenging or supplementing those created by the industry […] in carving out alternative pathways through texts” (2010). Drawing on Gray’s notion of the fan-created paratext, this paper seeks to examine the role which the fanmix plays in framing the on-screen narrative by undertaking a textual analysis of X-Files fanmixes and the meta and picspams that occasionally accompany them. I argue that by adopting songs which are neither officially sanctioned or entirely fan-created these ‘fan-adopted’ paratexts provide other fans with new ways of engaging with and understanding the text."
