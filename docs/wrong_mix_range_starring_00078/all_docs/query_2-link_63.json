        "text": "I spent most of my childhood living overseas in Europe and Middle East. As a general rule, we didn’t have many options in terms of English-language television and current movies — this was the 90s, so digital streaming was not really a thing yet. As a result, I watched old movies, mostly the same 15 or so movies that my parents owned. It was mostly Disney movies and a few very random others (e.g. Wayne’s World, The Field of Dreams, etc.). But the movies we owned were all classic Disney — not the most popular Disney of the time. The ones we owned were the movies that preceded Disney’s big revival in the late 80s and early 90s spurred by hits like The Little Mermaid (1989), Beauty and the Beast (1991), Aladdin (1992), and The Lion King (1994). Those hits were big when I was a kid, but I just wasn’t into them because we didn’t own.\n\nSo the Disney voices and animation styles that I most enjoyed and that I got really used to growing up were from what I would consider the “classic era” of feature-length Disney animation. I know that’s a somewhat arbitrary designation that encompasses various styles and periods. But it’s useful for me just the same. It’s an era that extends from Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs in 1937 and through to The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and The Rescuers in 1977. For context, here are the major feature-length majority-animated films that Disney released during that period:\n\nSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937)\n\nPinocchio (1940)\n\nFantasia (1940)\n\nThe Reluctant Dragon (1941)\n\nDumbo (1941)\n\nBambi (1942)\n\nThe Three Caballeros (Anthology film) (1945)\n\nMake Mine Music (Anthology film) (1946)\n\nFun and Fancy Free (Anthology film) (1947)\n\nMelody Time (Anthology film) (1948)\n\nThe Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad (1949)\n\nCinderella (1950)\n\nAlice in Wonderland (1951)\n\nPeter Pan (1953)\n\nLady and the Tramp (1955)\n\nSleeping Beauty (1959)\n\nOne Hundred and One Dalmatians (1961)\n\nThe Sword in the Stone (1963)\n\nThe Jungle Book (1967)\n\nThe Aristocats (1970)\n\nRobin Hood (1973)\n\nThe Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh (1977)\n\nThe Rescuers (1977)\n\nOne of the fun things you’ll notice if you watch those older Disney movies is that they seem to recycle both character types and occasionally even animation sequences, as well as voice actors. Some of the best and most memorable voice actors keep showing up again and again. I was reminded of this because I recently decided to get rid of my Disney+ subscription and have been rewatching some old Disney movies just for fun. It made me decide to finally do a little more research about some of the wonderful voices of my childhood and make a list for you.\n\nI ended up with 25 on the list, which, as usual, is longer than I initially intended. I did include a few voice actors who were better known for their work on shorter releases—people like Pinto Colvig (long-time voice of Goofy and Pluto) and Clarence Nash (long-time voice of Donald Duck). I also included people who voiced some pretty regrettable Disney characters—that is, some of the more racist ones, such as Dandy “Jim” Crow (in Dumbo), the Indian Chief (in Peter Pan), and Shun Gon the Chinese cat (in The Aristocats)—but I included them because they did memorable voice work in other pictures as well.\n\nIn any case, many of these voices are unforgettable and have been burned into my brain from childhood. To all of these actors and actresses, I just want to say: I’m forever grateful.\n\n1.) Phil Harris\n\nPhil Harris (1904–1995) was an American musician, actor and comedian.
