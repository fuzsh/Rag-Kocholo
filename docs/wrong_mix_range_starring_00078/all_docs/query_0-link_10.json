        "text": "Sounds like one I'm going to pass on. The vast majority of American theaters that I've seen Indian movies in do not respect intermission, unfortunately.\n\nSaw two Indian films today, one Tamil language, one Telugu.\n\nThe Telugu film was Virata Parvam, about a young girl, played by Sai Pallavi (Shyam Singha Roy and Love Story) who falls in love with the Communist poetry of this Naxalite guerrilla leader, and seeks him out. I didn't have a whole lot of sympathy for any of the characters, who while not as murderous as Stalin or Mao, it appeared to be mostly for a lack of opportunity.\n\nVeetla Vishesham is a Tamil language remake of Badhaai Ho about a couple in their late 50s shock to find themselves pregnant, much to their sons embarrassment. Some of the intra family arguing is pretty nasty, and some of it seemed like the sort of thing that would produce long-lasting hurt feelings that would interfere with the required Bollywood \"and in the end we all realized we're family and love each other\" ending. But the older brother's relationship with his more modern girlfriend was interesting.\n\nThere were a few cringy moments, but for the most part it was blessedly free of them.\n\nOne thing - nobody does color like Bollywood! The scenes in the family's drab little housing area contrasted with all these beautifully colored sarees was incredible eye candy.\n\nThe most recent Bollywood film was the Telugu language romance Sammathame. College graduate goes off to his first job at tech company, building a new house for his widowed father and his long-running, on and again off again romance with a young woman who knows her own mind. Meanwhile, both are constantly dealing with their families trying to set them up for arranged marriage.\n\nNothing special, but enjoyable enough. It did have some of the worst translation we've seen in a Telugu movie in a while. We did have a large crowd in this theater, who were getting a lot of jokes that were not there in the translation. I wish they'd had a better translator, or at least someone do a second pass on the construction of the English sentences.\n\nThe need to hire real Bollywood stars and a Bollywood director if they're going to have dance sequences. Kumail Nanjiani was game and got himself buffed up for his Bollywood scene in The Eternals, but as someone who's seen a few hundred Bollywood movies, there was no way that this guy was the biggest Bollywood star in the world.\n\nIt's like \"dude, I've seen Shah Rukh Khan and you are no Shah Rukh Khan.\"\n\nAlso playing at my nearest AMC. I will see if I can work it into the schedule this week.\n\nSpeaking of SRK, he was in a film we saw today - Rocketry: The Nambi Effect. He plays himself interviewing rocket scientist Nambi Narayanan, the designer of India's liquid fueled rocket. The film was shot in English, Hindi and Tamil, with SRK in the Hindi version which we saw.\n\nNarayanan was educated at Princeton, and was offered a very lucrative job at NASA, but turning that down to try to help India develop a rocket capable of launching satellite payloads - and in fact his rocket was capable of putting his satellite in Mars orbit.\n\nBut his life was practically destroyed when he was falsely accused of espionage on behalf of Pakistan and nearly beaten to death by police who wanted a confession (torture never produces truth, just confessions.)\n\nNot really a \"Bollywood\" film as there were no musical numbers at all.\n\nHighly recommended.\n\nRashtra Kavach OM was a Hindi language action film featuring a commando who's basically a bulletproof, unstoppable killing machine and a scientist who invented a widget that somehow manages to completely disarm all incoming nuclear weapons.\n\nNothing special, but an enjoyable enough time waster.\n\nThe third was Pakka Commercial about an ethical judge and his son the money and status obsessed lawyer. Not at all recommended, we should have learned our lesson a long time ago about Telugu comedies.\n\nI went to see \"Jugjugg Jeyo\", and it left me rather flat. Usually in a romantic comedy/light drama with a \"Are they really going to get a divorce?\" story line, the audience roots for the couple to stay together. In this case, I thought that both wives should have left their husbands ten times over. The lead character was especially unlikable. I went to a matinee showing, which turned into a private screening, as I was an audience of one.\n\nVickie and I are in the theater during the intermission of a very unique looking Tamil language film (just to remind myself, Tamil is Kollywood) - Iravin Nizhal.\n\nThe film is a single camera take. Unlike a lot of films that appeared to be a single take, like 1917, which were actually shot in long pieces but edited together with visually seamless transitions, they actually built a 2 km long set and shot it in a single 2 hour long take.\n\nAny technical problems meant starting all over again the next day - as one of the transitions involved the character smashing through a wall, which they had to rebuild out of rocks and cement and it had to dry.\n\nThey finally got one complete take, the day before India's COVID lockdown.\n\nMaking it even more complex, is the film is a musical by the great AR Rahman.\n\nAnyway, 2 minutes until the end of intermission. The part before the intermission, was basically a half hour long making of the film.\n\nWe are the only people in the theater."
