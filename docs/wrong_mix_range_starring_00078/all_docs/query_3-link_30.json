        "text": "Swades- We, the people is a 2004 film directed by Ashutosh Gowariker exploring themes of rediscovering one’s Indian roots.\n\nDirector: Ashutosh Gowariker\n\nMohan (played by Shah Rukh Khan), an Indian expatriate working for NASA, returns home to find his cherished nanny, Kaveri. He finds himself promoting reform in a village while he is there and in the process rediscovers his roots.\n\nAfter landing in India he takes a van from his friend and travels to his hometown. The first song Yuhin Chala Chal Rahi sung by by Hariharan, Kailash Kher, and Udit Narayan is like a cool road trip song and describes about the beauty of nature.\n\nThe first scene where he on boards plane and movie name comes as swadesh in many different languages and the AR Rahman score is a treat to hear in this scene . In this scene itself, we will get goosebumps.\n\nThe traveller travels… just like that, The traveller travels…just like that How beautiful is, this world Forget. all tension… Watch flowers’ festivals…Very colourful is, This world…This path is now telling me …That there is someone now, to meet me, somewhere…Why the heart is anxious …Who am I going to meet?\n\nThis is a character of NRI who is not that much touch in India . Once he comes to India audience can see many high maintenance and in many scenes he carries a mineral water bottle even in his nanny’s home he won’t drink the water instead he uses mineral water bottle which are brought by him.\n\nAs the movie progresses he roams in his village and everyone will respect him and he makes friends with a post office head for letters and mails . Another young guy approaches SRK to help him with his US visa process .\n\nAs the movie progresses we can see lots of parallel between foreign cultures and Indian culture etc. Movie never says foreign culture is bad but it says don’t forget our roots, culture and tradition. Swades also depicts the problems in India mainly in rural villages where caste discrimination, education of girls and basic needs like electricity etc . In one scene where village heads bashing foreigners by saying ‘maybe foreigners are all having education,electricity , building but they don’t have tradition , culture and ethics. Then Shahrukh replies every country has their own traditions and culture which may be different to other countries and we have to fight with a corrupt system and have to proactively do our own village needs by coming together . A great scene indeed.\n\nThe song Yeh tara wo tara ( Source Google: by Artists: Udit Narayan, Master Vignesh, Baby Pooja, Kids) depicts the scene correctly. And explains caste systems are made as part of profession but not based on births and when different persons from different professions (castes) come together and work as an unity then India automatically improves based. You can read lyrics here\n\nThis star, that star, every star …This star, that star, every star …Whichever one you see looks lovely…This star, that star, every star…When they all come together in the night then the whole sky shimmers When they all come together …In the night Then the whole sky shimmers…The shining stars…Two stars, nine stars, hundred stars…The shining stars…Each star is a separate spark\n\nWhen the hero discusses to the heroine that he will come to India to take the nanny with him she listens and gives a task to get money from Hari Das who is in debt to the hero nanny . This scene changes the emotional graph of the movie as by showing the poverty stricken family . The message it gives is very powerful as Hari Das family is eating only one meal for the day and when him and his friend visit his house, they gave that meal to him as per Athithi Devo bhava (always respects guests). This showcases that the corrupt rich are looting people for more money while a poor man shares his only meal with his guests . Next day morning Sharukh gives money instead of collecting it and shows how much he transformed.\n\nWhen the boy takes the train home, he sells water in small pots, but the first protagonist drinks dirty pot water, except mineral water. The scene where boys of this age struggle to earn money instead of studying is very powerful. On the train, there are a lot of people changing to another train and selling various things throughout the day.\n\nSure, sometimes we meet bad people, but we have to rejoice that we are far better off, and we have to be sad at the same time. Because in return for many blessings, neither I nor you, we will do.\n\nOnly some people are giving back to society and we also have to take initiative.\n\nThe scene where the people build their own electricity project, again a powerful scene depicting we can improve our villages if we unite and do things for society and can change many lives with these kind of small projects.\n\nAfter vacation Mohan goes to NASA but he can’t think anything except his home, village and country (swadesh) . It’s not just about the people he is missing but he genuinely wants to improve the condition of his country . Shah rukh is alive in this song ,his expressions, emotion and acting on to a different level . Yeh Desh ho tera is a song that will be remembered for generations.\n\nHow can you ever forget the scent of the earth (of your homeland),\n\nwherever you go, you will come back.\n\nin new paths (that you take), in quiet sighs\n\nto your lost heart, someone will say\n\n[the someone here is nothing but an inner voice of himself\n\nFinally Swadesh is a very underrated masterpiece. Every actor shined in their roles , the direction was brilliant and music was extraordinary. This movie should be viewed not only by NRI but every Indian should watch this because its theme is universal."
