        "text": "Some unique type of Mushrooms. It's very interesting to know about different types of Mushrooms. #Savenature #savebiodiversity #fungus #Mushrooms NB: ( I'm sharing this video for educational purpose on biodiversity and its conservation. Please don't use videos or pictures as reference to choosing edible mushroom because it need thorough checking or identification to avoid poisonous species. If someone interested to eat mushroom, please identify or confirm each mushroom species is edible or not before cook or eat. Everyone may not aware about all mushroom species). VC: _gardening_ for _beginner,IG\n\nAmerican Rivers just put out this fantastic video that explains dam removal. NJ has become a national leader in this effort. We understand the value of open rivers. PA, NY and NJ are home to the east coast's only free and open major river. The Delaware! Here at NOAA we are proud to be the sponsor of so much of this activity along with our many partners across the nation. https://lnkd.in/d_Uqh3R5\n\nGreat news - Global deforestation has over halved in recent years üå¥ The total global deforestation around the world has decreased by over half. With deforestation rates continuing to decrease every decade and year. The Industrial revolution then 2 world wars, actually did the most damage to global forestry. With meaningful progress to better manage and replace forest by conservatists and investors. It breaks down into 2 types of conservation. Natural expansion, where a forest, can regenerate it's tree population and expand. Between 1990 to 2020, 53 million hecatres of forest were lost. 30 million hectares were naturally. Then there are situations where tree planting occurs, either as replacement forest or managed forest. Between 1990 to 2020. 30 million hectacres were lost, with 12 million hectares planted. In recent times, things have got much better. With danger zones such as the Amazon in just the last year, seeing a 53% decrease in deforestation. Whilst overall, globally, deforestation rates continue to decline, while replacement seems to be getting better. Now, that doesn't mean we don't have a ton of work to do, as conservationists, with our investors. BUT, it's a meaningful message. That our efforts are having impact. Maybe, just maybe, we can end this climate crisis and achieve a win for nature and the world. Let's end deforestation and get our forests, by the mid-Century #deforestation #forestry #climatecrisis #treeplanting\n\nInvesting in Artificial Reef‚ùó Did you know that the global Artificial Reef Market Size is expected to grow significantly by 2030 at a CAGR of 7.70% The market for artificial reefs is expanding mainly due to growing concerns about the preservation of marine ecosystems and biodiversity that have been degraded by coastal development and the climate change sequences (water acidity, increasing sea level, increasing temperature). Our approach combines traditional knowledge with modern science to create sustainable solutions for marine conservation, at Fujairah Research Centre we began to develop prototyping in 2022, including different shapes of artificial reefs with palm leaves and oysters üåäüå¥ü¶™. Highlighting the commitment to sustainability, the project will feature: - Build 10 square km of Artificial Reef - Rehabilitate of Marine Habitat - Enhance Fisheries Yield and Food Security - Waste Management and Circular Economy #MarineConservation #EmiratiTechnology #DatePalm #CoralPropagation #SustainableInnovation #FujairahResearchCentre #EnvironmentalStewardship #Biomaterials #OysterShells #MarineEcosystems"
