        "text": "PALO ALTO (CBS SF) - Hewlett Packard is making some moves before its PC/Printer spinoff in the second half of this year.\n\nIt's selling online photo-printing and storage business Snapfish to Maryland-based Digital Photo for an undisclosed sum. HP bought Snapfish in 2005 for $300-million and had been reportedly up for sale by HP since last year.\n\nHP is also partnering up with online security provider FireEye to offer joint products through HP's IT services, including threat-protection services for 24/7 monitoring against cyber attacks getting around traditional defenses.\n\nMilpitas-based FireEye signed a similar partnership with Israel's Check Point Monday."
