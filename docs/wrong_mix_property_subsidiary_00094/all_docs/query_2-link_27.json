These Terms may be changed or updated at any time at the sole discretion of Dinuba Pharmacy.

Please read this Section carefully. It affects your rights and will impact how claims you and we have against each other are resolved.\n\nContact Dinuba Pharmacy first. If a dispute arises between you and Dinuba Pharmacy, our goal is to address your concerns and, if we are unable to do so to your satisfaction, to provide you with a neutral and cost effective means of resolving the dispute quickly. Disputes between you and Dinuba Pharmacy regarding the Dinuba Pharmacy Services may be reported to Customer Service online at https://www.Dinuba Pharmacy.com/mktg/contactus/contact-us-landing.jsp?formCatId=125 , at any time, or by phone at the number listed in the Customer Service section of the site.\n\nApplicable Law. You agree that the laws of the State of California, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern the Terms of Use and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between you and Dinuba Pharmacy, except as otherwise stated in this User Agreement.\n\nAgreement to Arbitrate. You and Dinuba Pharmacy each agree that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between you and Dinuba Pharmacy shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court, if your claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.\n\nProhibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief. YOU AND DINUBA PHARMACY AGREE THAT EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH YOU AND DINUBA PHARMACY AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S OR PARTY’S CLAIMS AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER DINUBA PHARMACY USERS.\n\nArbitration Procedures. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”) under its rules and procedures, including the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA’s rules are available at www.adr.org. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA’s website at http://www.adr.org.\n\nThe arbitration shall be held in the county in which you reside or at another mutually agreed location. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, you or Dinuba Pharmacy may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on you and Dinuba Pharmacy subject to the arbitrator’s discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by telephone by you and/or Dinuba Pharmacy, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.\n\nThe arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of California, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Dinuba Pharmacy users, but is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Dinuba Pharmacy user to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator’s award shall be final and binding, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.\n\nCosts of Arbitration. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA’s rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, at your request, Dinuba Pharmacy will pay all filling, administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. Any request for payment of fees by Dinuba Pharmacy should be submitted by mail to the AAA along with your Demand for Arbitration and Dinuba Pharmacy will make arrangements to pay all necessary fees directly to the AAA. If the value of the relief sought is more than $10,000 and you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, Dinuba Pharmacy will pay as much of the filing, administration, and arbitrator fees as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive. In the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) you assert in the arbitration to be frivolous, you agree to reimburse Dinuba Pharmacy for all fees associated with the arbitration paid by Dinuba Pharmacy on your behalf that you otherwise would be obligated to pay under the AAA’s rules.\n\nSeverability. With the exception of any of the provisions in subsection (a) of this Agreement to Arbitrate (“Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”), if a court decides that any part of this Agreement to Arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, the other parts of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall still apply. If a court decides that any of the provisions in subsection (a) of this Agreement to Arbitrate (“Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief”) is invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this Agreement to Arbitrate shall be null and void. The remainder of the User Agreement, including all other provisions of this section (Disputes with Dinuba Pharmacy), will continue to apply.\n\nOpt-Out Procedure. You can choose to reject this Agreement to Arbitrate (“opt out”) by mailing us a written opt-out notice (“Opt-Out Notice”). For new Dinuba Pharmacy users, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 Days after the date you accept the User Agreement for the first time. [If you are already a current Dinuba Pharmacy user and previously accepted the User Agreement prior to the introduction of this Agreement to Arbitrate, the Opt-Out Notice must be postmarked no later than 30 days after you first accept and acknowledge these revised Terms. You must mail the Opt-Out Notice to Dinuba Pharmacy Co., Attn: Litigation and Regulatory Law Department, 104 Wilmot Road, MS 1431, Deerfield, IL 60015.\n\nThe Opt-Out Notice must state that you do not agree to this Agreement to Arbitrate and must include your name, address, phone number, and the email address(es) used to log in to the Dinuba Pharmacy account(s) to which the opt-out applies. You must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. This procedure is the only way you can opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of the Agreement to Arbitrate, all other parts of the User Agreement, including all other provisions of this section, will continue to apply. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any previous, other, or future arbitration agreements that you may have with us.\n\nAUTO–REORDER & SAVE\n\nCONSENT:\n\nBy placing, modifying and/or cancelling any auto-reorder, you expressly and affirmatively consent and agree to terms and conditions of the Auto-Reorder & Save program described herein.
