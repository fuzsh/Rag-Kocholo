Snapfish, based in San Francisco, claims more than 13 mln registered members, many of whom store prints in photo albums that can be viewed through the company's Web site.\n\nSnapfish President Ben Nelson will lead the new division within H-P. Terms of the deal weren't disclosed\n\nSnapfish charges 2.99 usd to develop a roll of film, and sells individual prints starting at 19 cents each.\n\nNelson, and Larry Lesley, H-P's senior vice president of consumer imaging and printing, said the deal pushes both companies forward in their efforts in the online photo market.\n\n\"It's a natural extension of our photo strategy,\" Lesley said. \"The digital photo market is about self-expression, and we think we have the products to get people to want to be creative with their digital photos.\"\n\nThe deal puts H-P up against Eastman Kodak and its Ofoto service, which will change its name to Kodak EasyShare later this spring.\n\nH-P said it expects the deal to close in April.\n\nCopyright 2005 AFX News Limited.
