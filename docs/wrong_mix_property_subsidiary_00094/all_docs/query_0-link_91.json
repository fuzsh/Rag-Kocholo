        "text": "The review, which is being led by HP's procurement department, is believed to cover Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The print technology giant confirmed that it is in the process of drawing up a list of about 10 agencies that it is interested in speaking to, although it said the process was at a very early stage.\n\nIn the UK, HP has worked with agencies Publicis Dialog and Gyro International for its direct marketing. The review is not believed to involve Publicis Dialog's work for HP's Imaging and Printing Group unit, one of HP's three divisions.\n\nGyro International, which works on HP's large format print business, refused to comment. The agency won a bronze at the 2006 DMA Awards for its work promoting HP's digital print capabilities.\n\nLast March, Publicis lost the European advertising account for HP's Personal Services Group, while Publicis Dialog won the below-the-line work for HP's Imaging and Printing Group.\n\nPublicis appointed ex-Visa marketer Karen Hughes to head its European regional HP account last autumn to replace Dennis Kerslake when he was promoted to chairman of Publicis Dialog.\n\nHP was formed in 1939 in a garage in California by Stanford university classmates Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard. The company's first service was to make sound equipment used by Disney in early films.\n\nIn 2002, the company merged with Compaq and in 2005 acquired online photo services company Snapfish."
