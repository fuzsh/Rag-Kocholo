V Krishnan, GM, Consumer Sales, Imaging & Printing Group; (IPG), HP India Sales Pvt Ltd said that these would take digital photography to the 'next level'. \"Today's announcement brings HP closer to realising our vision for creating an all-digital photography marketplace\". \"By establishing a footprint of 3000 retail photo outlets with HP Retail Photo Solutions by 2010 and photo delivery through Snapfish across India, we hope to change the dynamics of the photo printing market\", he said. Snapfish will offer consumers free online photo sharing, unlimited online photo storage and professionally developed digital camera prints for as low Rs 2.95 (4x6 size).

Consumers could also print photos on key chains, mugs, t-shirts, mouse pads, photo greeting cards, posters, calendars and coasters at HP Retail Photo outlets or place orders on Snapfish website. RPS will allow consumers to print on various substrates such as art paper, canvas and can also print instant photo albums. will work with retail partners to roll out RPS in supermarkets, photo specialty stores, electronics stores, office product stores and traditional photo service stores.
