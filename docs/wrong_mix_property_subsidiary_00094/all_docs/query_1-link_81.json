Whether it is capturing pictures of marriages, prom, science projects, your child's first steps, babies, graduations, first dates, sports successes, or the family trip to Disney World, having just a digital copy of an image is never as satisfying as a photo you can hold in your hands. This photo sharing/upload service grown to be one of the best digital photo printing services online. Below, I will review what makes Snapfish's services great.\n\nSnapfish photo book example.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nOwned by Hewlett-Packard, Snapfish is a web based photo printing and photo sharing service. Unlimited photo storage and free file uploads are available to members.\n\nBusiness partners Suneet Wadhwa, Rajil Kapoor, Shripati Acharya, and Bala Parthasarathy launched Snapfish fifteen years ago. Snapfish was then purchased by HP in 2005. Based in San Francisco, California, Snapfish hosts more than two billion digital pictures and has over 90 million members.\n\nFeatures on Snapfish are free for the most post part. While providing the best value, their mission is to help their customers enjoy, make the most of, and preserve their memories.\n\nServices & Specialities\n\nFrom your camera, Snapfish allows you to upload both your digital videos and prints whether you are a videographer or a photographer. With PictureMover, an application you can install on your computer, Snapfish provides its account holders with a tool to make the printing process simpler. You pictures can be moved to your Snapfish account directly from your media devices, camera, computer, or memory card with PictureMover.\n\nTo upload photos to your Snapfish photo album, you do not have to download PictureMover. The Photo & Video Organizer is another way you can do it. You can import photos straight from Flickr and Facebook accounts in addition to uploading photos from your computer with this feature. Snapfish also gives you the following organizing features once you have uploaded a photo:\n\nTag - You can create face tags and tag photos by event.\n\nShare - Through social networking sites or email, you can share albums and photos with friends and family.\n\nRearrange - You can sort photos into albums according to name, date, event, or place to keep them organized.\n\nSearch - You can search for photos by phrases and keywords once you have tagged or captioned your photos.\n\nCreate - From directly within your photo album, you can choose to create a variety of projects.\n\nCaption - To know what exactly you were feeling or doing at the time a photograph was taken, you can add a caption.\n\nView - To see a larger image, you do not have to open each photo individually. Instead, you can just roll over it and click on the magnifying glass.\n\nYou can also use the editing tool to add boarders, remove red eye, change tint, rotate photos, and make other minor adjustments. You can also have captions printed on the back of your photos.\n\nWhat You Get for the Price\n\nFor the purposes of this review, I am going to focus on the pricing for printing digital photos on photo paper, but I would be remiss if I did not point out that you can have your photo printed on just about anything with Snapfish. Their bestsellers are photo mugs, games, clothing, office items, ornaments, jewellery, mouse-pads, stationery, blankets, posters, calendars, cards, photo canvas, and more.\n\nSnapfish always has discount deals going on, Check the top of this page for the latest Snapfish Coupons and deals.
