        "text": "President Akufo-Addo has charged Ghanaians to unite and free the nation from the economic arrangement designed by the country's former colonial power.\n\nTaking to Twitter to commemorate Founders' Day on August 4, the President noted that such collective action is the best way the country can \"pay homage to successive generations of Ghanaians who played significant roles towards the liberation of our country from colonialism and imperialism.\"\n\n\"We must, as a mark of reverence to our forebears, work to free ourselves from the economic arrangements designed by the former colonial power to serve its particular purpose at the time, which continue to bind us,\" he stated.\n\nHe also rallied for support to end the neo-colonial structure of the raw material producing and exporting economy.\n\nAccording to President Akufo-Addo, rectifying the economic structures of the colonial power will help drive the country to a \"united, developed, prosperous, free, democratic and independent Ghanaian nation.\"\n\nPreviously, the country celebrated Founder's Day on September 21 annually, but was changed by President Akufo-Addo during his first term of office, to Founders' Day on August 4.\n\nThe day is set aside to celebrate the achievements of the men who led Ghana to independence. They are referred to as the Big Six.\n\nThe fallen heroes who make up the Big Six are; Kwame Nkrumah, Ghanaâ€™s first President, Ebenezer Ako-Adjei, Edward Akufo-Addo, Joseph Boakye Danquah, Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey and William Ofori Atta."
