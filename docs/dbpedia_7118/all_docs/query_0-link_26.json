The boy in America grumbles his way through school and wonders when he can go home to play video games. The boy in Africa throws a sack of bean pods over his shoulder that is much too heavy for him. At the end of the day the privileged kid will climb into his bed with no worries. The child slave will climb into bed, exhausted, with no…\n\nOn the bus ride to our hotel in Accra, one of Africa’s safest capital cities, all of our eyes were wide open to take in all of the sights (Briggs 121).
