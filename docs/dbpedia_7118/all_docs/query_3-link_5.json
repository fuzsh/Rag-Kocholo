        "text": "West Africa: Beginning in Accra, the Republic of Ghana\n\nMade it to my hotel in Accra, Ghana, late Sunday night, got a good night’s rest, had a hearty Accra City Hotel buffet breakfast and began my Monday getting a personalized tour from Kelvin, my guide, and Alex, my driver, with Stellar Tours of Accra. Today was a national holiday and although some places were closed, this energetic capital city was full of hustle.\n\nExploring the present, must begin with the past. So, let’s take a quick look at the Republic of Ghana and Accra’s past. It was March 6, 1957 when the Gold Coast (now known as Ghana) gained its independence from Britain and became a member of the Commonwealth of Nations. And, it was Dr. Kwame Nkrumah who led the country to independence and transformed it into a republic, with himself as president. Accra, a prosperous trading center, became the capital of the British Gold Coast colony in 1877.\n\nBefore Ghana became independent, the Portuguese first settled on the coast in 1482, the present site of Accra, which was occupied by several villages of the Ga tribe. The Ga’s are said to be descended from immigrants down the Niger and across the Volta rivers during the 17th century.\n\nThe Portuguese built the Castle of Elmina, (which I’ll visit towards the end of my stay in Ghana) the first European settlement on the Gold Coast where they acquired Africans to be sold as slaves and gold in trade for European goods. Successful trading news spread quickly, and British, Dutch, Danish, Prussian and Swedish traders arrived as well. The European traders built several forts along the coastline. The Gold Coast had long been a name for the region used by Europeans because of the large gold resources found in the area.\n\nThe slave trade became a major part of the economy when European nations began to explore and colonize the Americas. Soon the Portuguese and Spanish began to export African people to the Caribbean, and North and South America for enslavement. The Dutch and British also entered the slave trade, at first supplying markets in the Caribbean and the coast of South America. By the latter part of 19th century the Dutch and the British were the only traders left. And when the Dutch withdrew in 1874, the British made the Gold Coast a crown colony until Ghana gained its independence in 1957.\n\nTomorrow starts my TransAfrica tour through Ghana, Benin and Togo. But for now, here’s some of present-day Accra, Ghana."
