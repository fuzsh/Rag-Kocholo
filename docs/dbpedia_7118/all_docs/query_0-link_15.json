        "text": "Ghanaâs history before the 15th century is concentrated primarily on oral traditions. However, it is believed that people may have inhabited present-day Ghana from about 1500 BC. European contact with Ghana began in 1470. In 1482, the Portuguese built a trading settlement around the coast. Shortly thereafter, for three centuries, the Portuguese, English, Dutch, Danes, and Germans all controlled different parts of the coas.\n\nIn 1821, the British took control of all of the trading posts located in the Gold Coast. From 1826 to 1900, the British then fought battles against the native Ashantis, and in 1902, the British defeated them and claimed the northern part of modern day Ghana. In 1957, after a plebiscite in 1956, the United Nations determined that Ghanaâs territory would become independent and merged with another British territory, British Togoland, when the entire Gold Coast became independent. On March 6, 1957, Ghana became independent after the British gave up control of the Gold Coast and the Ashanti, the Northern Territories Protectorate, and British Togoland. Ghana was then chosen as the new name for the newly independent colony in place of the Gold Coast.\n\nFollowing its independence, Ghana was demarcated into ten (10) different regions for effective administration of the country. Kwame Nkrumah was the first Prime Minister and President of modern Ghana, and he was pivotal in the struggle for the total liberation of the African continent. He was a fierce advocate for the unification of the African continent and worked assiduously towards the realization of his vision of offering his country and the continent at large, freedom and justice and quality education for all. His government was however, overthrown in 1966.\n\nGhanaâs political governance was subsequently, characterized by series of insurrections from 1966 to 1979. In 1981, Ghanaâs Constitution was suspended, and political parties were banned in the country. This led to severe economic depression and the migration of many Ghanaians later to other countries.\n\nIn 1992, political stability was restored. There was a return to democracy and Ghana adopted a new Constitution for its democratic governance. The economy was revived and Ghana remains the leading example of a democracy in Africa with extra 6 regions created in 2018, making 16 regions in Ghana."
