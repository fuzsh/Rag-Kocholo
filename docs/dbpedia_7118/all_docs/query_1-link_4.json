        "text": "dbo:abstract\n\nEbenezer Ako-Adjei (* 16. Juni 1916 in , Ghana; † 14. Januar 2002 in Accra) war zu seinen Lebzeiten einer der bekanntesten Politiker, Rechtsanwälte, Verleger und Journalisten Ghanas. Er hat sich besonders im Kampf um die Unabhängigkeit des Landes und die Staatsgründung hervorgetan. Unter anderem war er Gründungsmitglied der ersten Partei Ghanas, das zur damaligen Zeit noch die Kolonie Goldküste war. Nach seinem Tod wurde Ako-Adjei bei einem Staatsbegräbnis bestattet. (de)\n\nDr. Ebenezer Ako Adjei (17 June 1916 – 14 January 2002) was a Ghanaian statesman, politician, lawyer and journalist. He was a founding member of the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC), the first political party of Ghana (then Gold Coast). As a founding father of Ghana, he was one of the leaders of the UGCC who were detained during the height of Ghana's struggle for political independence from Britain, a group famously called The Big Six. Born in Adjeikrom, a small village in the Akyem Abuakwa area, Ako Adjei had his tertiary education in the United States and the United Kingdom. After his studies abroad, he returned home to join the movement of Gold Coast's struggle for political independence by joining the United Gold Coast Convention (UGCC) as a founding member. Ako Adjei was instrumental in introducing Kwame Nkrumah into Ghana's political scene when he recommended him for the full time post of Organising Secretary of the UGCC. Following Ghana's Independence, Ako Adjei served in various political portfolios including being the first Minister for Interior and Justice for the newly born nation, Ghana. He also became Ghana's first Minister of Foreign Affairs when the portfolio was changed from Minister for External Affairs to Minister for Foreign Affairs in May 1961. Ako Adjei's political career was however precluded after his detention for allegedly plotting to assassinate the then president Kwame Nkrumah in the Kulungugu bomb attack in 1962. After his release in 1966, Ako Adjei spent the rest of his life in relative obscurity. He remained unseen or unheard in the Ghanaian national and political discourse. He resolved to focus on his family and his career as a legal practitioner. In 1992 he published a biography of the Ghanaian businessman and statesman Mr.George Grant. In 1997 he was awarded the Order of the Star of Ghana award – the highest national award of the Republic of Ghana, for his contribution to the struggle for Ghana's independence. Ako Adjei died after a short illness in 2002.Ako-Adjei can be applauded for his contributive effort for considering the Organising Secretary post in UGCC to be given to Kwame Nkrumah.Ako-Adjei teaches us to be people who refer or bring individuals whose goal are like ours and can help us in achieving them together. Ako-Adjei is celebrated for his role for introducing Kwame Nkrumah, who played a significant role in Ghana's Independence. (en)\n\nЭбенезер Ако-Аджей, Эбенезер Ако Аджей (англ.
