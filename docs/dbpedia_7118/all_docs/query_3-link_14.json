        "text": "On August 4th each year, Ghanaians celebrate Founders' Day - a day to recognize the efforts of the people involved in helping to found Ghana as we know it today. Specifically, the day commemorates the big six - six men who together were crucial in achieving Ghana’s independence from colonial rule in 1957. Dr. Nkrumah, Edward Akufo-Addo, Joseph Boakye Danquah, Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey, William Ofori Atta, and Ebenezer Ako-Adjei are names that will always be remembered in Ghana.\n\nOn this Founders’ Day, we’d like to recognize 6 Ghanaians who are founders in their own right. They built organizations that have gone against the odds in an array of industries and have put Ghana on the map, just as their forefathers did. Here are 6 ground breaking Ghanaian Founders and their amazing companies.\n\nVanessa Leonie-Mensah\n\nFounder of VDL Fulfillment\n\nVanessa Leonie-Mensah is the founder and female entrepreneur behind VDL Fulfillment - an African based e-commerce order fulfillment platform that accelerates the growth of online businesses in Africa.
