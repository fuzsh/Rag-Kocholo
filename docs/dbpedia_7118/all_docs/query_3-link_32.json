        "text": "A few weeks ago, unknown faces plastered its walls with pastors inviting the faithful to crusades, church service or politicians announcing their intentions to contest parliamentary or presidential elections.\n\nThe posters make a nasty patch of colours offensive to the eye. The Accra Metropolitan Assembly(AMA) huffed and puffed and hoped to ward off persons posting them. It did not work.\n\nSneaky and mostly under the cover of darkness, the perpetrators defied the iconic ‘post no bill’ signs to deface the walls of the Ako Adjei Interchange.\n\nThe painting of the walls of the giant national landmark, named after one member of the Big Six who led the fight for Ghana’s independence in the colours of the national flag, did not help much.\n\nBut not anymore. At least, that is what the Creative Arts Council says, as it turns the walls of the interchange into a painters’ canvass.\n\nSplashes of colour, culture and heritage have taken over the walls of the interchange, formerly known as Sankara Circle, as Ghanaian artiste put Ga culture and heritage on the hitherto defaced walls.\n\nIt is a befitting adornment for the nation’s first interchange, which was completed in 1999.\n\nThe Interchange is located between Ring Road Central and Independence Avenue and is along Liberation road in Accra.\n\nIt links commuters towards the 37 Military Hospital, Accra Central, Ring Road Central and the Police Headquarters.\n\nIt has contributed to easing traffic in the capital.\n\nBefore the new face of the interchange, most of the streets, walls, and buildings in Ghana had banners, stickers, and notice from Pastors, entrepreneurs, schools among others.\n\nSome students with ‘much youthful exuberance’ also leave their prints on the wall “#Me too I was there some, Total Support, We will overcome.”\n\nBut with the new facelift of the Ako Adjei Interchange, this growing canker may soon become a thing of the past.\n\nThe paintings on the interchange are to project Ghanaian culture with an emphasis on chieftaincy, commerce and history.\n\nThe artists, with acrylic colours, clad the base with painted symbols adorning the middle and tops with elements that depict the Ghanaian culture.\n\nRanging from dressing, coiffeur, scarification, tradition, dances, religion, and festivals are the new face of the Ako Adjei Interchange.\n\nThe Creative Arts Council lead, Gyankromaa Akufo-Addo expressed excitement at the first phase of Art for all projects.\n\nShe said the Ako Adjei Interchange project was the first part of the beautification project the council was undertaking.\n\n“We are using Art, public spaces filled with public works to beautify the city. We are using this phase as multi prone phase and we want to project and promote their work within Accra,” she indicated.\n\nShe hoped that the public would use and cherish the new project.\n\n“We are hoping it gives a ripple effect to people in Ghana and Accra, so as not to defecate in public spaces, paste notices on walls and learn to cherish what we have as a country.”\n\nOne painting showcases flamboyant music and dance.\n\nAccording to Miss Akufo-Addo, it was a period of renewal, communal blessings, and glorification of the ancestors. Strong African woman."
