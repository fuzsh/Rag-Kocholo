        "text": "We were delighted to host senior healthcare executives from the India, Middle East and Africa region this week for a productive and insightful visit to Northern Ireland, where they had the opportunity to engage with our thriving Life and health sciences sector. The programme kicked off with a dynamic networking day, featuring one-to-one meetings with some of our companies. This was followed by two days of site visits to medtech, precision medicine and diagnostics companies as well as cutting-edge research centres and hospitals in the North West and Belfast. This visit was a fantastic opportunity to showcase the innovation and expertise that Northern Ireland’s Life and health sciences sector has to offer. Thank you to everyone involved in making this visit a success.
