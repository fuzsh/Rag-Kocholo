        "text": "(Accra Central, Accra, Ghana)\n\nIn 1945, he traveled to Europe and helped organize the 5th Pan-African Congress in Manchester, where he and other leaders planned decolonization efforts. This event catalyzed African diaspora leaders' voyages to independence, including that of Nkrumah, and Jomo Kenyatta of Kenya. Other notable attendees included W.E.B. Dubois (who would later relocate to Ghana and advise Nkrumah), George Padmore, a Trinidadian freedom fighter, and Amy Ashwood Garvey, the wife of Marcus Garvey,\n\nNkrumah collaborated with five other main leaders of Ghana to crusade for independence. These leaders included Edward Akuffo-Addo, Ebenezer Ako-Adjei, Joseph Boakye Danquah, William Ofori-Atta and Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey. Together, they became known as the “The Big Six”. The Big Six, also known as the Founding Fathers of Ghana, are commemorated on the country’s currency, the Ghana Cedi. With Kwame Nkrumah’s efforts, Ghana became the first country in Southern Saharan Africa to gain independence from colonial rule. Upon the country’s independence, Nkrumah renamed Gold Coast, ‘Ghana’, as a homage to the Ancient Ghana empire, which translates to ‘Warrior King’ in the Soninke language."
