        "text": "The Danquah Institute (DI), a policy think tank focusing on advocacy, training, media and communications has emphasised the need to recognise and celebrate all who contributed to Ghana’s independence.\n\nOn Thursday 4 August 2022, to commemorate Ghana’s Founding Fathers, the Institute held a lecture on the theme “The Independence Struggle: Our Heroes and the Fight for Democracy”.\n\nThe aim of the lecture was to bring to the fore the untold contributions made by different groups of people in the lead-up to Ghana’s independence.\n\nSpeaking at the lecture in Accra, the executive director of the Institute, Dr Antoinette Tsiboe-Darko, who is also a research fellow at the Centre for Social Policy Studies at the University of Ghana, Legon, first talked on the symbolic importance of the 4 August Founders’ Day celebration.\n\nShe said that Ghana’s independence was the collective effort of many individuals whose role and contribution are being recognised.\n\nShe talked about the formation of the Aborigines’ Rights Protection Society (ARPS) by J W de Graft Johnson, Jacob Wilson Sey, John Mensah Sarbah, J E Casely Hayford and J P Brown, among others, to fight against a law that sought to transfer all lands of the Gold Coast to the British. This was a part of the fight for independence.\n\nOn 4 August 1947, the United Gold Cost Convention (UGCC), the first political party to fight for freedom, justice and ultimately independence was inaugurated. The UGCC was formed in a bid for self-governance by the politician, author and lawyer Dr J B Danquah with George Grant as chairman, R A Awoonor-Williams, R S Blay, Edward Akufo-Addo, William Ofori Atta, John Tsiboe and Kwabena Kessie.\n\nThe UGCC became one of the most influential political parties in the Gold Coast. It is well documented that the outspoken and revolutionary African Kwame Nkrumah was subsequently brought down to the Gold Coast to be the UGCC’s general secretary.\n\nThe celebration of “Founders’ Day” calls for Ghanaians to reflect and remember the sacrifices of these forebears.\n\nThe honour also gives their families recognition and shows appreciation for their sacrifice for Ghana. Again, it ensures that our rich history does not just remain in libraries but that we relive it by having discussions and dialogues.\n\nRecounting the life stories and contributions made by some of these individuals, Dr Tsiboe-Darko talked about Osagyefo Dr Kwame Nkrumah who became Ghana’s first president. The memory of Osagyefo is celebrated annually on 21 September.\n\nThe significance of his leadership role as the first prime minister and first president of our great nation will for ever be honoured.\n\nShe described how Kwame Nkrumah, together with Ebenezer Ako-Adjei, Edward Akufo-Addo, J B Danquah, Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey and William Ofori-Atta, earned the name “the Big Six” after they were incarcerated for their alleged involvement in the 1948 riots in the Gold Coast.\n\nThis worked to their advantage as they planned how to attain independence from the colonial administrators.\n\nIt was also during this time that Dr J B Danquah, through research, provided the justification for the Gold Coast to be renamed Ghana after independence.\n\nDr Tsiboe-Darko mentioned that another important group of people documented in our history who we must recognise as founders are the traditional leaders of the time. Here we can go as far back as the Akwamuhene who defeated the Danes in 1693, Sitobo who founded the Dagomba Kingdom, Yantuare who founded the Mossi Kingdom and Tohogo who founded the Mamprusi Kingdom.\n\nThere were also the 1863 and 1865 wars in which the Ashantis and Fantes, respectively, fought and defeated the British. Closer to independence, King Aggrey of Cape Coast, the Komenda and Asebu, the Denkyirahene and Nii Kwabena Bonne of Osu Alata must all be acknowledged as making very significant contributions. The unification of the many kingdoms was a very important part of the struggle.\n\nAmong the founders were also great women whose tireless efforts worked to gain us independence. They include Rebecca Naa Deidei Aryeetey, whose image can be seen on the 50-pesewa coin; Susan Al-Hassan, Mabel Dove Danquah, Theodosia Salomey Okoh, Agnes Oforiwaa Quarcopome and many others who contributed to the struggle in diverse ways.\n\nThe DI executive director further emphasised that there are lessons that can be gleaned from the life stories of these individuals.\n\nFirst, that traditional leaders are and have always been pacesetters in leadership. As such they must endeavour to ensure that they continue to hold our societies intact through good leadership, and not allow the new politics which is more divisive to destroy the good values of our society.\n\nShe also emphasised on the need for individuals to develop themselves before entering into politics. This, she noted, was a key feature of the founders, who were scholars, learned men and women, businesspeople, traders and the like. She cautioned the youth to ensure they develop themselves professionally before entering politics.\n\nThis way, the contribution they make will be more selfless and fulfilling.\n\nShe further encouraged everyone to understand and protect the historical antecedents which characterised the struggle for our independence and the implications of this for the path of development we have chosen to follow as a nation."
