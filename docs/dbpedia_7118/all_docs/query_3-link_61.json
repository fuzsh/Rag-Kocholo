        "text": "The Republic of Ghana is named after the medieval West African Ghana Empire.\n\nThe Empire became known in Europe and Arabia as the Ghana Empire after the title of its Emperor, “the Ghana” which means “The Warrior King”.\n\nThe Empire appears to have broken up following the 1076 conquest by the Almoravid General Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar.\n\nAccording to oral traditions, the ancestors of the Akan people, today the largest ethnic group, entered the country from the north and spread southwards between CE 1200 and 1600.\n\nThe Fanti State of Denkyira was at that period already established on the coast.\n\nBy 1400 the Akan had established their Bono and Buida kingdoms in the forested central region.\n\nTheir highly developed culture was centred on the city-state, surrounded by vassal villages, and rule by a court where the queen mother was often a more powerful figure than the king who, being sacred, was hidden from the people and consequently often politically isolated.\n\nThe Akan traded gold and kola nuts for salt and cloth, in the west and north, and were also involved in the slave trade.\n\nIn the 15th century, the Ashanti people waged war against the Denkyira Kingdom and by 1700 had gained control of the slave trade.\n\nThey developed a powerful army and a centralised state, ruled by the Asantehene (king of the Ashanti nation).\n\nPortuguese traders, arriving after 1450 in search of gold and ivory, named the country Gold Coast; appropriately since, by the end of the 16th century, it produced ten per cent of the worldâs gold.\n\nFrom the middle of the 16th century other Europeans began arriving; in the mid-18th century there were Dutch, Danish and British settlements.\n\nThe British became involved in internal conflicts when they backed the Fanti against the Ashanti who were extending their power into the coastal areas. There were four wars in the 19th century.\n\nThe Bond of 1844, entered into by Britain and the Fanti chiefs, endorsed British control of small pockets of settlement; six years later Britain set up a legislative council to govern these areas.\n\nThe British took over abandoned Danish settlements in 1850 and the Dutch settlements in 1871.\n\nBy Orders in Council (1901) Britain declared the southern territory a colony by settlement, the northern territory a protectorate and Ashanti a colony by conquest.\n\nIn 1922 a part of the adjoining German territory of Togoland was placed under British administration by a League of Nations Mandate and after World War II it became a UN Trust Territory.\n\nThe principle of elections was introduced under the 1925 constitution.\n\nDuring the first half of the 20th century, there was growing national pressure for self-determination, and the UK gradually surrendered control.\n\nThe 1946 constitution required the legislative council to have an African majority.\n\nFollowing civic disturbances in 1948, the UK agreed that a committee consisting entirely of Africans should examine the structure of the countryâs government.\n\nIn the 1940s, African merchants, such as George Alfred Grant (“Paa Grant”), were ready to finance the organization of a political movement to assure their commercial interests in the face of unfair colonial practices.\n\nThe party was founded by J. B. Danquah on 4 August 1947 by a combination of chiefs, academics and lawyers, including R. A. Awoonor-Williams, Robert Samuel Blay, Edward Akufo-Addo, and Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey.\n\nÂ\n\nOn 10 December 1947, Kwame Nkrumah returned to the (British colony) accepting Danquah’s invitation to become the UGCC General Secretary.\n\nBig Six member Ebenezer Ako-Adjei recommended inviting Nkrumah, whom he had met at Lincoln University.\n\nNkrumah was offered a salary of Â£250, and Paa Grant paid the boat fare from Liverpool to Ghana.\n\nDanquah and Nkrumah subsequently disagreed over the direction of the independence movement and parted ways after two years.\n\nNkrumah went on to form the Convention People’s Party and eventually became the first president of independent Ghana.\n\nThere was a meeting between Nkrumah and members of the party which occurred in Saltpond, a town in Central region.\n\nIt was said Nkrumah rejected a proposal for the promotion of fundamental human rights.\n\nThe UGCC performed poorly in the 1951 elections, winning only three seats.\n\nThe following year, it merged with the National Democratic Party and disaffected members of the Convention People’s Party, to form the Ghana Congress Party.\n\nIn 1949, Kwame Nkrumah set up the Convention Peopleâs Party (CPP) to campaign for independence.\n\nElections took place in 1951, and the following year Nkrumah became the countryâs first Premier.\n\nThe 1954 constitution provided for a legislative assembly of 104 directly elected members, and an all-African Cabinet; the UK kept responsibility for foreign affairs and defence.\n\nThe CPP campaigned for full independence.\n\nThe general election of 1956 returned the CPP with a big majority.\n\nModern-day Ghana was formed when the British-administered part of Togoland voted to join the Gold Coast in an independent state, in a UN-supervised plebiscite in May 1956.\n\nGhana achieved independence within the Commonwealth on 6 March 1957.\n\nIn 1960 Ghana became a republic, with Nkrumah as President, and in 1964 a one-party state, the CPP being the sole authorised party.\n\nHowever, less than a year later, Nkrumah was removed by military coup, the first of four coups.\n\nThe army and police set up a National Liberation Council, which dissolved the legislative assembly and suspended the constitution while a new one was drafted.\n\nPolitical activity was permitted again in 1969; a general election followed in August.\n\nIt returned the Progress Party; its leader Dr Kofi Busia became Prime Minister, with the National Alliance of Liberals as the opposition.\n\nIn 1972, another military coup led by Colonel Ignatius Acheampong overthrew Busiaâs government and set up a National Redemption Council.\n\nIn 1978 Acheampong was replaced by General Frederick Akuffo, who promised civilian rule by the middle of the following year.\n\nTwo weeks before the elections were to be held in June 1979, a military coup led by junior officers ousted the government.\n\nFlt-Lt Jerry J Rawlings and the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council declared that they had assumed power, in order that an honest election could take place.\n\nElections were held as scheduled; they returned the Peopleâs National Party, whose leader Dr Hilla Limann took office as President in September 1979.\n\nAnother coup, in 1981, put Rawlings back in power.\n\nHe suspended the constitution and banned political parties. From December 1981 until November 1992 Ghana was ruled by a Provisional National Defence Council (PNDC).\n\nIn May 1991 the PNDC government set up a 260-member consultative assembly to oversee the restoration of multiparty democracy.\n\nA committee of constitutional experts was appointed to draft a new constitution for submission to this assembly.\n\nIn April 1992 the draft constitution was overwhelmingly approved in a referendum; political associations were unbanned; and six opposition movements were granted legal recognition.\n\nThe National Democratic Congress (NDC) was formed to contest the elections on behalf of the PNDC which they won by majority vote.\n\nThey ruled for 8 years after getting elected again in 1996.\n\nIn 2000 the NPP party won the general elections, after 8 years power changed hands back to the NDC.\n\nIn 2016 the NPP won back power under the persevering leadership of Nana Addo Dankwa Akuffo Addo, and astute lawyer whose father From 31 August 1970 until his deposition by coup d’Ã©tat on 13 January 1972, was President of Ghana in the Second Republic.\n\nReal power rested with the prime minister, Dr. Kofi Abrefa Busia.\n\nOn 17 July 1979, Akufo-Addo’s father died of natural causes.\n\nGhana is home to many tourist sites.\n\nWith Ghana you get beautiful hinterland, sunny beaches, rich culture, lively cities, welcoming locals, tons of wildlife, and easy access to all parts of the country.\n\nThereâs a big difference between northern and southern Ghana â including different religion, geography, and culture.\n\nBut youâll still feel like the country is one harmonious unit.\n\nIf youâve never been to Africa, Ghana is known as âAfrica for beginners,â making it a perfect destination for those who want to get their feet wet.\n\nAccra :\n\nIn Accra, the Capital of Ghana, one can visit the National Theatre, International Trade Fair, the Kwame Nkrumah memorial, Independence Square, and W.E.B. Dubois Centre and the famous Art Centre.\n\nThe Artists Alliance Gallery\n\nThis gallery will blow you away with its contemporary and fine art collections.\n\nCreated by respected Ghanaian artist, Ablade Glover, the three story gallery is a treasure chest of Kente clothe, furniture, Asafo flags, masks, and unique metal sculptures.\n\nYou can see almost every prominent Ghanaian artist represented and most of the pieces are for sale.\n\nLabadi Beach\n\nArguably Accraâs most popular beach, Labadi is the perfect city beach.\n\nGreat food and cocktails are available, as well as local entertainment and people watching.\n\nThe beach itself is maintained by the surrounding hotels so be forewarned that there is a small entrance fee for those not staying there.\n\nIf you happen to be there on the weekend youâll for sure catch some native drumming, local reggae bands, and plenty of spots for dancing to hiplife â a unique music style that blends hip hop with Ghanaian culture.\n\nLake Volta\n\nThe largest man-made lake on Earth is Lake Volta in Ghana.\n\nStay in the neighbouring towns of Ho or Ewe as you explore this lush and beautiful area.\n\nEnjoy Aburi botanical gardens, music cruises on the lake, canoeing, monkey sanctuaries, fishing, waterfalls, and a Kente weaving village.\n\nIf youâre up for it, you can hike to the top of Mount Afadjato, Ghanaâs tallest peak.\n\nBe sure to check out Shai Hills, a wildlife preserve, and Xavi, a bird watching sanctuary, while youâre there.\n\nThis is truly one of the most beautiful parts of Ghana and not to be missed.\n\nLake Bosumtwe\n\nJust 32km from Kumasi is Lake Bosumtwe.\n\nThis crater lake is almost 90 metres deep and created when a large meteorite collided with Earth.\n\nThe lake is surrounded by fantastic trails for hiking, biking, and horseback riding.\n\nIn addition, youâll find that many locals visit here as the lake is a sacred sight for the Ashanti people.\n\nFolklore holds that the peopleâs spirits come to Lake Bosumtwe after death in order to say goodbye to the god “Otwi” translated as “The Antelope god”\n\nIf youâre looking for a relaxed place for water spots, this is an excellent weekend destination.\n\nTamale\n\nInhabited primarily by the Mole-Dagomba group, Tamale is the countryâs northern capital.\n\nThere are several gorgeous mosques here and the cultural centre has craft shops, dance and music performances.\n\nConsidered to be the âkitchenâ of Ghana, youâll find fantastic local and exotic foods here.\n\nItâs probably the fastest growing city in West Africa and itâs also probably one of the most welcoming.\n\nFarmers by tradition, this hot and arid land is located close to the Sahara Desert.\n\nDonât miss the two traditional palaces of Dapkema and Gulkpe Naa.\n\nKumasi\n\nThe second largest city in Ghana is Kumasi, once the capital of the powerful Ashanti kingdom.\n\nThe city itself is still heavy with Ashanti traditions.\n\nThe main attraction here is the Kejetia market.\n\nA place where you can get lost for days.\n\nIn fact, sometimes the entire city can feel like one big market.\n\nVisit the Manhyia Palace and learn about traditional African democracy.\n\nWhile youâre there, donât forget to check out the National Cultural Centre and sit in on a dance or drumming class.\n\nCape Three Points\n\nFor discerning beachcombers, Ghana offers Akwidaa â with a long and pristine white sand beach, youâll find itâs one of the best that the country has to offer.\n\nExplore the nearby cocoa plantations and forests and get a night-time guided tour of the turtle nesting spots along the beach.\n\nIf you like, you can take a canoe ride to Cape Three Points, the southernmost tip of Ghana.\n\nThereâs a great bar scene, good food, and plenty of local attractions to provide a good combination of lazing about and seeing new things.\n\nMole National Park\n\nThis is the place for family safariâs in Ghana.\n\nMole National Park covers a large savannah filled with African elephants, buffalos, baboons, warthogs, and kob antelopes.\n\nYouâll find almost 100 mammal species and at least 300 bird species here.\n\nThe park allows walking and driving safaris and you can rent a park vehicle if you donât have your own.\n\nGoing between December and April is the best time for elephant sightings, though youâre guaranteed to see plenty of mammalsâ year round.\n\nBusua Beach\n\nPerhaps the most chill beach in Ghana is Busua.\n\nItâs a magnet for the backpacker and volunteer crowds who love to come to unwind on the beach for a few days at a time.\n\nRoughly 30k from the city of Takoradi and situated right between Dixcove and Butre, the village of Busua has potential for great excursions, making it an ideal base camp.\n\nMany beaches in Ghana have a strong surf, making swimming a little precarious, but Busua waters are as relaxed as its vibe.\n\nBecause itâs primarily a tourist town, youâll find great hotels and restaurants, shopping, and renting surfboards and bicycles.\n\nElmina Castle\n\nThe first European slave trading post in Africa was Elmina Castle.\n\nBuilt in the 15th century by the Portuguese, it is located in what is now present day Ghana.\n\nOver the centuries itâs been controlled by the Dutch and the British and primarily served the Caribbean and Brazil slave routes.\n\nYou can see the luxury accommodations up top, where the Europeans stayed and then visit the dungeons below where one cell held up to 200 people.\n\nItâs a very eye opening look at a difficult aspect of African and European history.\n\nThe castle is a designated UNESCO World Heritage Monument and is part of the national museum system.\n\nNational Museum of Ghana\n\nHistory buffs will love the National Museum of Ghana.\n\nThere are a number of exhibits dedicated to the Atlantic slave-trade and the African lives that where irreparably changed because of it.\n\nIf youâre looking for a good explanation of the ethnographic diversity of modern-day Ghana, this is the place to go.\n\nGet insights into the past and present people, see traditional household objects, art, the royal Ashanti tools, and learn how to weave Kente cloth.\n\nCape Coast\n\nCape Coast is a former European colonial capital and one of the most culturally significant spots in all of Africa.\n\nOriginally called Cabo Corso by the Portuguese, the town was once the largest slave trading centre in West Africa.\n\nIt was here that slaves where brought, locked deep in the towns intimidating castle, and then loaded on to vessels heading to the New World.\n\nWhat you will see and experience here will move you deeply.\n\nToday Cape Coast is primarily a fishing town with an artsy vibe.\n\nOld colonial buildings line the streets perfect for leisurely strolls.\n\nUse Cape Coast as your base for exploring Anomabu, Elmina, and Kakum National Park.\n\nÂ\n\nKakum National Park\n\nA visit to Kakum National Park makes a great day trip from Cape Coast.\n\nThere youâll find 40 mammal species, 300 bird species, and over 600 butterfly species.\n\nThe most popular part of the park is the canopy walk.\n\nItâs a string of viewing platforms that are linked by safe and bouncy suspension bridges roughly 30 metres above the park floor.\n\nFor a deeper look into the park, make arrangements ahead of time for a park ranger or guide to take you further in.\n\nÂ\n\nWritten by: Henry Kwadwo Amoako (ð¬ð­Ghanaian Historian,
