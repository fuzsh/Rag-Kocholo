        "text": "CHAPTER 4 – OXFORD DAYS\n\nOn 29th August 1949, I left Accra for London with my colleagues, Patrick Anim and Kenneth Dadzie by an Argonaut airplane called R. M. A. Manton. It took us 24 hours to travel from Accra to London, instead of the 6 hours which today’s jumbo jets take to do. It was my first time travelling by air. As the plane was racing to take off, I held my breath with sheer curiosity, but once we were airborne, I felt relaxed without any anxiety. From the way my colleagues suddenly began to converse with me when we were airborne, it was clear that they had also been anxious. The journey itself was smooth with occasional bumps, but the experience was exciting. Over the Sahara we strained to look out of the glazed window to see miles and miles of sand dunes with occasional oases. The plane touched down at Lagos airport, Kano, Castel Benito (as Benghazi was then called by the Italians), and Rome. Great was our relief when our plane finally landed at the London airport. We had arrived at the great metropolis safe and sound.\n\nWe were met by an officer from the Office of the Director of Colonial Students. A coach took us to Victoria Station whence we rode by taxi to Balmoral Hotel, a hostel for students, situated near Earls Court. We were thoroughly briefed about life in England and directed to the Colonial Office where we met the Director of Colonial Students, Mr. Keith. He confirmed that I had a place at Exeter College, Oxford where I could read Politics, Philosophy and Economics (PPE). I had hoped that I would be permitted to read Jurisprudence for my degree, but I was politely informed that it was not then the Colonial Government’s policy to give scholarships for Law, as there were too many lawyers already in the Gold Coast. What the country needed was an efficient class of administrators, engineers, agriculturalists and medical doctors.\n\nThere was still time before the start of the academic year and so I decided to sight-see London and enjoy its delights. Meantime, I wrote to Mr. T. K. Impraim, who had written to me from Exeter College congratulating me on my admission to his college, that I had arrived in London. He was kind enough to visit me at Balmoral Hotel and to inform me when we could travel together to Oxford.\n\nIn London, I did some shopping and bought the necessary clothes for the university. Sightseeing was made easier for me than it would have been by Kweku (Kuuku) Sekyi who insisted on showing me around London. He himself had come on holidays from Cork, where he was studying Philosophy and Law. He was also staying at Balmoral Hotel and so it was a joy to have some “old coaster” on hand. As I was a newcomer to England, I was called JJC (Johnny-Just-Come) by those who had come to England a year or so before me. Mr. Sekyi and I travelled by “tube”, the underground train, to a number of places all over London. We visited Westminster Abbey, St. Paul’s Cathedral, the Houses of Parliament, the Tower of London, the Royal Albert Hall, Madame Tussaud’s and Hyde Park. Madam Tussaud’s gallery of criminals in wax was fascinating as well as frightening. The gallery of famous men was really inspiring.\n\nAll the places we visited were of great historical interest. As I stood in the House of Commons, I had an instant dream of being a Parliamentarian and the history I had learnt about Disraeli, Canning, Pitt the younger, Peel, Gladstone and Asquith kept coursing through my mind. It was an awe-inspiring chamber. As for Hyde Park, I visited the Speakers’ Corner a few more times to listen to the soap-box orators. I heard Mr. Kwesi Lamptey and Mr. Joe Appiah at various times making rabble-rousing speeches amidst heckling and booing and clapping. Both were “old boys” of my school, Mfantsipim. Joe Appiah definitely had the gift of the gab and seemed simply unruffled by the incessant heckling from an elderly English gentleman who kept shouting back at Joe, “can you hold your self-government if we give it to you? Can you? Can you?” and Joe would go on raving and ranting “our forefathers ruled themselves in Ashanti before the white man came;” “we prefer self-government to slavery.” I must say that I was attracted by Joe Appiah’s inveigling against British imperialism and colonialism. Paradoxically, Mr. Appiah later became a barrister-at-law and married Peggy Cripps, the only child of Sir Stafford and Lady Cripps. Sir Stafford was a famous Chancellor of the Exchequer in Clement Atlee’s Labor Government.\n\nMy days in London slowly drew to a close and I had to leave for Oxford. But I had enjoyed my short stay at the Balmoral Hotel. Never had I met so many West African and West Indian students in my life. There was a general solidarity and camaraderie among the students from the various countries. However, what baffled me somewhat was the occasional outburst of acrimonious exchanges of words between West African students, especially Nigerians, on the one hand, and West Indian students, especially Jamaicans on the other. Apparently, West Indians had the silly habit of referring to those of us from West Africa as “bushmen”, while West Africans referred to West Indians as “sugar cane men” who did not know their roots. But, of course, this was a simple matter of lack of understanding and a dearth of proper communication. There had been individual friendships which have lasted until today. When I myself went up to Oxford, I befriended Hector Wynter, who was my year at Exeter College studying Modern Languages, and the redoubtable Dudley Thompson who was reading Jurisprudence at Brasenose College. Both men hailed from Jamaica and they were destined to play vital roles in the affairs of Jamaica. Hector Wynter became Editor of the newspaper “The Gleaner” and was Ambassador to Trinidad and Guyana for Jamaica while Dudley Thompson became a noted senator and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Jamaica.\n\nThe trip to Oxford, my first, I have not forgotten. Mr. Impraim and I took the coach from Victoria Coach Station. Mr. Impraim gave me a running commentary as we passed through Slough, Amersham, High Wycombe and a number of small towns on the way. We arrived at the Oxford coach station at dusk. From there we took a taxi to college. I remember asking Mr. Impraim, as we drove through Oxford, where the University was. My friend did not answer me at all, because he apparently read my thoughts. I had expected to see a campus a bit outside the city of Oxford with open fields and trees shielding the halls of residence and blocks of lecture rooms. Instead, I saw clusters of buildings and what I thought were church spires, narrow streets, and bicycles upon bicycles with their riders wearing black short-sleeved gowns over their coats.\n\nWe entered a gate when we got down from the taxi. We had sent ahead our baggage by train. As soon as we entered the college, Mr. Impraim intoned, as if in some chapel, “this is Exeter College; we are standing in the Porter’s Lodge; the green lawn you see in front of you is called the quad. You are a freshman.” A quad at Oxford meant quadrangle and a freshman or fresher was a student in his first year at the University of Oxford.\n\nIntroductions done, the porter showed me a list where I saw my name against which were written 3:6. I had the 6 rooms on staircase 3. As I entered the quad and made for my staircase, I felt as if I had come to an ancient monastery. Little did I realize that I had entered a beautiful college, established in 1314 for West countrymen by Walter de Stapledon, the Bishop of Exeter, a distinguished statesman of the reign of Edward II? I was indeed an undergraduate in a famous and ancient seat of learning, whose beauty must be discovered to be appreciated. As I stayed for three years, Oxford grew on me, and then I recalled what a science lecturer and preacher at Achimota College had once said in the Gold Coast, “Oxford is a spirit – you live it.”\n\nMy two rooms in college suited me. There was a spacious study and a rather smallish bed room. My study room had two doors, the outer one being an oak door. Tradition had it that a student was not to be disturbed on any account once the oak door had been bolted.\n\nI felt miserable on my first night. It was a cold October night and I was completely unprepared to sleep in a room without a heater, which was what my bed room lacked. Nobody had advised me to buy a hot water bottle and it was an effort to sleep in cold sheets and once I slept, it was a struggle to come out of bed when my “scout” woke me up the following morning. A scout was the name given to a college servant at Oxford. In Cambridge and Durham he is called gyp. Tom was my scout. He had been a scout for thirty years before my arrival in college and he used to regale me with anecdotes about the college. He even informed me how students scaled the walls when the college gate was bolted at midnight. It was he who told me that the first Prime Minister of Pakistan, Lingat Ali Khan, lived on my staircase many years before me. Tom liked tiger nuts which I had brought from the Gold coast and so I lavished them on him in return for favors!!\n\nOn my second day in college, I had to meet my Moral tutor, Dr. Dacre Balsdon, a Greats man who had written a book about Oxford and was indeed an institution in the college. When I complained about my cold bedroom, he promptly advised me to procure woolen undershirts and wear them in addition to my pajamas. As he smiled at me, he said “you see why we Englishmen are hardy; we sleep in cold rooms.” I did not know whether I had to take what Dacre said as a joke, but I felt my pride pricked. Throughout my stay in England, I did not wear woolen undershirts and underpants beneath my pajamas; I used hot water bottles in my bed sheets.\n\nI also met the sub-Rector who was also the Dean in college to discuss my course of study. Mr. W. G. Barr explained the Oxford lectures and tutorials to me. My tutors in various subjects would indicate which lectures were necessary and which were optional. He said Lord Cecil’s lectures in English Literature were popular and, as they would broaden my knowledge, I could attend some of them. But Mr. Barr emphasized that tutorials were a must and a diligent approach to them would be rewarding in the end. The College expected me to pass the first university examination or Mods., as Oxford called the first examination, at the end of the second term. In addition there were “collections” at the beginning of each term. These were college tests which a student must pass in the subjects in which he had been tutored the previous term. I was informed that my tutor in politics would be Mr. H. G. Nicholas, a Fellow of the College. For Philosophy, I was assigned to Professor Kueale, also a Fellow of Exeter College. My Economics tutor was to be Mr. E. Ward-Perkins, Fellow of Pembroke College. I had Dr. Hla Mint, a Burmese economist who was at Meffield College to teach me Colonial Economics (as economics of underdeveloped countries was then called). For Moral Philosophy I had a professor of Magdalene College, while Mr. J. Richardson of Exeter College taught me Economic Organization. For university lectures, my tutors guided me in my choice from a list of topics and lecturers which was promoted for every term.\n\nI found the tutorial system at Oxford very beneficial. I wrote an essay every week. The usual practice at the end of the tutorial was that the tutor who would have read your paper of the previous week would question you on a number of points and you would have to defend your position or some contention made by some author. A lively discussion would ensue at which the tutor would bring up fresh ideas to supplement yours. Your tutor insisted on giving you a long reading list and requested you to read as much as possible on any given subject. My economics tutor wanted me to “produce sparks”, meaning I should do some original thinking. I always looked forward to my tutorials. The days on which I had no tutorials I spent reading at the Bodleian library or the Radcliff Library, which I found comfortable. At Oxford, an undergraduate was very much on his own and he had to organize his time in such a way that he would find time for other pursuits.\n\nIn my very first year, it dawned on me that Oxford education was something much more than lectures, seminars, classes and tutorials. While these were vital for a degree, a lot more was required of a student – the acquisition of a vigorous independence of mind. Undergraduates bathed in the sea of accumulated knowledge and sifted wisdom of centuries. It was incumbent on them to make the most out of what Oxford offered. I met mature students in my time, some of whom were ex-servicemen or had completed their National Service at some outpost of the British Empire. There was rising expectation everywhere and we all looked forward to a brave new world, where there would be full appreciation of the worth and dignity of the human person. For me, the challenge my studies at Oxford posed was overwhelming. I came from the Gold Coast where there was a new awakening. I had no doubt that I had a vital contribution to make after my studies in the building of a new nation where there would be prosperity, unity and peace.\n\nThe University of Oxford was a veritable bee-hive of activity. A freshman was often bombarded with invitations to join this or that club or society. My pigeon-hole was inundated with invitations and notices. The Cosmos club, the United National Students Association, the Socialist Club, the Labor Club, the Tory Club, the West African Students Association, the Oxford Intercollegiate Christian Union (OICCU), the Students Christian Movement (SCM), the Oxford Union usually called The Union, the Majlis Association and other clubs too numerous to mention were all available for an undergraduate to pick and choose from. I still recall the occasion when I was effectively canvassed and convinced to join the Labor Club by Miss Shirley Catlin of Somerville College. She later became Mrs. Shirley Williams and a famous Minister of Education in a Labor Government. She did not see eye to eye with the Labor Party leadership and became one of the Labor party dissidents who resigned to found the Social Democratic Party, which she represented as a Member of Parliament.\n\nI myself knew that I could join all these clubs at Oxford and had to content myself with a select few. I became a life member of The Union, and joined the West African Students Union, the Labor Club, and the OICCU. For some reason, my English friend, Tony Wilmot, did not think that the SCM offered the kind of spiritual nourishment I needed and so he suggested that I join the OICCU instead.\n\nI had a full life at Oxford. Both college and University life had their joys and pinpricks. At Exeter College, the communal life was pleasant. We had breakfast, lunch and dinner in Hall, with its polished wooden tables and benches for college students and a high table for fellows. While breakfast and lunch were not formal and compulsory, college members were expected to dine in and we had to wear our gowns. I wore a Commoners gown, a short gown falling to the waist line with short sleeves and two long straps hanging loosely from each shoulder. Scholars and Exhibitors had their own separate gowns. Apart from dinners, students and fellows wore gowns for lectures, tutorials and to most college and university official functions.\n\nIn those days, we in Exeter College had communal baths and toilets towards the Broad Street. This meant that I had to walk across the quad from my staircase to reach these facilities. In winter, I did not cherish the idea of walking all this distance and I must admit that I was happier as far as this aspect of life was concerned when I moved into “digs” in my third and last year. Otherwise, I enjoyed myself immensely in college. I got invited to the Rector’s Lodge a few times. The Rector in my time was Dr. Barber, a wily looking intellectual with a patrician but warm personality. On each occasion of my visits, I drank port, a habit which was rather common at Oxford. My Politics tutor, Mr. H. G. Nicholas for his part, served claret which I liked.\n\nOn one occasion, after my Politics colleagues had had claret at the rooms of our Politics tutor, we got so tipsy that we gave vent to our feelings as we got down to the quad. Unknown to me, my colleagues had conspired to debag me. I was suddenly mobbed. I struggled and got free and I was chased round the quad until I was overpowered. All I knew was that I was being carried shoulder high like an African chief, but without my trousers! We ended up by going down the basement to drink beer at the bar. Exeter brewed its own beer.\n\nI played hockey and table tennis for my college. I was even fried for Oxford Three at table tennis. I also did a lot of punting and swimming during the summer. On my first May Day morning at Oxford, that is, on 1st May I observed tradition by waking up early at five in the morning and joining my friends at Magdalene College. We had commandeered a punt the previous night, and as we sat on this, there issued form the top of Magdalene Tower, at six o’ clock in the morning some melodious music sung by the Magdalene College Choir. It was a refreshing and delightful experience for me. On that occasion, there were crowds of undergraduates and people milling all round the college and the Magdalene Bridge listening to the singing of the choir, presumably for the first time like me. Of most things at Oxford, you might do it once. When it was all over suddenly, there were picnics all over. My friends got into our punt and I punted them near to some meadows where we had our picnic. Punting was an art in which I was much practiced. It had to be done adroitly, otherwise you fell into the river, if your pole got stuck in the mud and you tenaciously held on to it.\n\nApart from going on the river during the summer for relaxation, I did some swimming at “Pastor’s Pleasure”, so-called because the legend was that that part of the river had been reserved for pastors, dons and Oxford me to swim naked. I heard that there was a counterpart for ladies called “Ladies Delight” but I never ventured in that direction.\n\nI did occasional walking to sample the beautiful spots all around. To walk along Christ Church and Merton Meadows or to stray into the Fellows Gardens at St. John’s College or Exeter College was a treat. I was fond of showing off Exeter College Fellows Gardens to my friends and visitors. I would take them to the garden walk up to the walk which was like a parapet. There we viewed Brasenose College (BNC), Radcliffe Library, the Sheldonian Theatre, Hartford College, the spires of the University Chapel, all in one sweep. It was on these occasions that I bathed in the spirit that was Oxford.\n\nI attended the clubs which I had joined as a member rather religiously. At the meetings of the Labor Club I met budding socialist politicians some of whom became my friends. Through them, I became a member of a small group which met on most Wednesday nights in the rooms of G.D.H. Cole at All souls. Professor Cole declaimed on workers’ participation in industry, sharing ideas with management for the more effective organization of industry and sharing in the profits accruing. I was fascinated by Professor Cole’s Guild Socialism and became a devotee. It was during this period that I considered myself a socialist, vowing that I would one day work with workers and organize them to understand the part they had to play in industry and agriculture and in the general reconstruction of the economy and the society of Ghana.\n\nI took my membership of the Oxford Union seriously as I had learnt that the Union had been the nursery of many English and world politicians and statesmen. I nursed ambitions for office at the Union, but I quickly discovered that to become an officer you had to literally spend all your time at the Union premises, wining, lunching and dining and speaking “on the paper”. To speak “on the paper” was to be listed to speak in a debate, either in support of, or against the motion. To be listed to speak in a debate, you must have attracted attention by your powers of oratory or your potential as a good speaker, by making evident interventions from the floor of the “house”. In a few cases, the fame of good speakers had gone up to Oxford before them as they came from Eton or Harrow or Winchester or Charterhouse. An African from “one of ours”, as an old English lady had once referred to me, had not got much of a chance.\n\nOnce or twice after I had made interventions from the floor, I heard a remark that “here is another Nelson-Williams”. This was an obvious reference to Mr. Nelson-Williams, an eloquent and debonair Nigerian who had read Jurisprudence at BNC and had risen to the enviable position of Secretary of the Union. I had missed him by a year or so, but my English friends would often mention his name to spur me on. One such friend was Robin Day who became President of the Union.\n\nI did observe that some of the best speakers at the Union gulped some alcoholic beverage before they entered the “house”. Like that Queen of the Netherlands, mentioned in Harold Nicholson’s delightful book “Diplomacy”, who had insisted that any Ambassador accredited to her Court had “to be capable of absorbing large quantities of intoxicating liquor without being deranged”, so did the Oxford Union seem to encourage many a brilliant orator to imbibe some amount of port or sherry or brandy before a speech. A bit of alcohol, it was believed, loosened the tongue! Speakers at the Union tended to imitate members of Parliament in their mannerisms and general demeanor. Such outbursts as “hear, hear”, “Mr. President Sir”, “shame”, “rubbish”, “sit down”, “point of order” were part of parliamentary behavior which I learnt at the Oxford Union. Years later when I myself became a member of Ghana’s Parliament, I felt very much at home because of my experience at the Union!\n\nA lot of Oxonians whom I knew at the Union emerged as prominent personalities on the British or international scene. I cannot forget William Rees-Mogg of Balliol who was President of the Union when I joined it in the academic year 1949-50. My freshman’s impression of him was of a solid and unemotional figure not to be trifled with. Although he was not my friend, I took an interest in what he would do in later life. I was not a bit surprised to learn that he had become the distinguished editor of the London “Times” and had become Sir William. Another Union member I very well remember was Robin Day of St. Edmund Hall (Teddy Hall to Oxonians). He succeeded Rees-Mogg as President of the Union and it was under his presidency that I spoke “on the paper”. He became a distinguished member of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and his program “Panorama” became a popular feature and one which I enjoyed watching when I was working in London as a diplomat. He too became Sir Robin. Then there was Jeremy Thorpe of Trinity College. He was my year. He was superbly eloquent and became an effective President of the Union. That he rose to become the leader of the British Liberal Party and a good Parliamentarian did not surprise me. There was also Keith Kyle of Magdalene College, another eloquent speaker. The last time I saw him was at the United Nations delegates Lounge, where he interviewed me on Africa and the United Nations. He had become a journalist and was a special correspondent for a British paper. Others like Ivan Yates of Pembroke, Dick Taverne of Balliol who became a Labor Member of Parliament and a Cabinet Minister, but later joined, like Mrs. Shirley Williams, the Social Democratic party, and Raghavan Iyer of Magdalene, a brilliant Indian scholar, were notable speakers at the Union, whose gift of the gab stood them in good stead after Oxford.\n\nI must put it on record that it was Robin Day, as President that I got noticed at the Union. I also got invited on occasions to the President’s receptions before a debate. On one such occasion I met Randolph Churchill, son of the famous Sir Winston. He chatted with me and wanted to know all about Africa, of which he knew next to nothing. On another occasion, I met the redoubtable Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), Sir Godfrey Huggins. He and I got locked in an animated argument about self-government for the British colonies. He was at pains to make me feel that as an African from the Gold Coast, I was quite different from the African in Rhodesia. I tried to convince him that it was all a matter of opportunity and not a question of any inherent superior qualities that I possessed. He then propounded his “pyramid” doctrine, that the white settlers would remain at the apex and offer leadership to the blacks who would form the base of the pyramid. He thought it would take 50 years for the Africans in Rhodesia to start climbing to the top.\n\nThis heated argument between me and Lord Malvern, as he later became took place in 1951. Ten years later, in 1961, it was I, as the Permanent Representative of Ghana to the United Nations, that challenged in the General Assembly the British delegation’s insistence that the General Assembly could not discuss the question of Southern Rhodesia because it fell within the purview of Article 2 paragraph 7 of the Charter of the United Unions. I argued succinctly before the General Assembly that Southern Rhodesia was a colony, albeit a self-governing one, but the white minority of settlers could not presume to represent the black majority who did not even have a vote. I urged with great success the General Assembly to accept with a thumping majority that Southern Rhodesia was a colonial issue and should be treated as such. I was also one of the outspoken advocates for the dismantlement of the ill-fated Central African Federation. Like Caliban in Shakespeare’s “The Tempest”, I had been taught language by my British masters and I “knew how to curse”.\n\nAs I have narrated before, it was under Robin Day as President of the Union that I made my maiden speech at the Union. This was during the debate about Seretse Khama’s marriage to an English lady typist. What happened was that soon after leaving Balliol College, Seretse Khama, the son of King Khama of the Bamangwato tribe in Bechuanaland (now Botswana) decided to marry an English woman. This was against the express wishes of his people, especially of his uncle Tsekedi Khama, then Regent of the Bamangwatos, who maintained that the marriage was not acceptable as it was a taboo for the tribe. With the connivance of the British Government, which exercised protectorate powers over Bechuanaland, Tsekedi Khama banned his nephew from the tribe and would not permit him to enter Bechuanaland. Seretse Khama was, of course, the heir apparent to the throne. The whole episode was sensational and convulsed Oxford and England at the time. The Oxford Union was seized of the issue and the motion was to the effect that Seretse’s marriage to an English woman was proper and that the ban was improper. I spoke against the motion, supporting the ban by Tsekedi. My speech was mentioned by “Isis”, the University journal as follows: “Notable among the speakers was Alex Q. Sackey (Exeter), who spoke with simple fervor”. I subsequently became more enthusiastic as a member of the Union, but my other clubs also claimed my attention and time.\n\nThe West African Students Union was also a good forum where a student’s “tour de force” in speech making was noticeable. After all, the club was mostly concerned with political and economic matters affecting Africa in general, and West Africa in particular, and it was necessary that members should be abreast of the events occurring in West Africa at the time. Ghana and Nigeria were much in the news with Kwame Nkrumah, Nnamdi Azikiwe and Awolowo stealing the limelight. We organized debates and discussions on issues which were topical. But we also had discussions on African culture, religion and social change.\n\nWe were 25 students from West Africa reading different subjects and having diverse interests. For example, Ernest Amanor Boateng read geography. He later became Professor of Geography at the University of Ghana, Legon, and Vice-Chancellor of the University of Cape Coast in Ghana. Solomon Pratt read economics and statistics; he later became an international civil servant in the International Labor Office (ILO) and then Minister of State in Sierra Leone, holding various portfolios. Alex Kyerematen read social anthropology; he later became a Minister of Local Government in Ghana and author of the “Panoply of Ghana”, depicting the rich cultural heritage of the Ghanaian people. T. K. Impraim read history; he later became a District Commissioner and a renowned Ghanaian civil servant rising to become Deputy Secretary of the Cabinet and Head of the Civil Service. Eldred Jones read English; he later became Professor of English and then Principal of Fourrah Bay College. Richard Akwei read PPE; he later became a diplomatist and Ghana’s Ambassador to Switzerland and the European office of the UN in Geneva, then Permanent Representative of Ghana to the United Nations in New York, and later Ghana’s Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China. Lastly, Tunde Lawson who also read PPE, later became a distinguished Nigerian public servant, rising to become the Secretary to the Cabinet of the Federal Republic of Nigeria. These are notable examples I have given to show the high caliber of the membership of the West African Students Club. I became the President of the Club in my last year with Eldred Jones as the Secretary. On the whole, West African student at Oxford in my time were highly motivated and were destined to play important roles on the African continent.\n\nI made many friends at the university, with some of whom I still maintain contacts. Friends like Mervyn Jaspan (now Professor of Social anthropology) and David Jenkins made me conscious of the issue of race and set me on the track in search of racial harmony. Mervyn came up to Exeter College from South Africa where he had seen apartheid in action. He used to keep me informed of the different racial laws in South Africa and unashamedly told me that he could not invite me to South Africa to stay with him as a friend but only as “a shoe-shine boy.” He never tired emphasizing the seriousness of the obnoxious governmental system under which the African was chafing. In the case of David Jenkins (also of Exeter College), he wrote to me a letter from Caux where he was attending a moral rearmament conference, apologizing to me for looking down on me as a black man. He was making this confession in his letter and begging me to forgive him because he had been brought up as a child to look upon Africans as savages. Up to the time I received David’s letter we had been good friends, exchanging visits to our rooms and discussing problems together. Afterwards I became conscious, very conscious, that I was an African at Oxford.\n\nFriends at Oxford who are still close to my heart are Heinz Hellin, John Black and Peter Barker. Heinz Hellin, a college friend, became close to me when the two of us were tutored together in general Philosophy at Magdalene College. He was one year ahead of me but philosophy brought us together. His home in Radhill, Surrey, became my home and his mother looked upon me and my wife as her children. After Oxford, Heinz had a stint as a civil servant and then joined Unilever Brothers serving as a Director in a number of countries including Nigeria, Sri Lanka and Thailand. It was when he was serving as Marketing Director that he and his wife, Ann and children visited our home at Winneba, Ghana and spent a few days with us. I am Timothy’s godfather (Timothy is his second son). I have just recently visited him and Ann in Bramwall near Guildford in Surrey, England.\n\nJohn Black read PPE at Trinity College. He became friends in our very first year. It was a purely genuine friendship based on mutual admiration. He was a bit retiring but very warm at heart and he did not think much of a lot of the undergraduates he met. I spent my first Easter holidays with him and his family in Cheltenham. We cycled all the way to Cheltenham from Oxford and back. It was a rare experience, riding through the Cotswolds and enjoying the delights of the English countryside.\n\nIt was during the same Easter holidays that John, David Jenkins and I planned to walk along the Roman Wall. We met at David’s home in New Castle, from where we visited Durham University, Hexham Abbey and the York Minister. We then made for the wilds of Cumberland and walked on Wall for miles. Each of us had a rucksack on the back containing some clothing, food and maps. John was a pilot and map reader and he led us to spend our first night at “Once Brewed”, a small inn, and then on to “Twice Brewed”. At each place, we cooked our own food. I remember cooking groundnut soup and rice. There was some pepper in the soup which was too hot for my two English friends. But they ate it and said it was “lovely.” I could sense their agony! We walked all the way from New Castle to Chesters, doing on the average fifteen miles per day. We formed an interesting trio – two Englishmen and an African singing lustily as we walked along. Some motorists became curious and slowed down to gaze at us or offer us a lift where we had thumbed. We hitchhiked through the Lake District from Chester back to New Castle, where John and I bade “au revoir” to David and took a train to Cheltenham.\n\nJohn Black became Professor of Economics at the University of Exeter. Since leaving Oxford, I have visited him in Birmingham and Exeter and he got in touch with me when he and his wife visited New York. I am still in touch with him. Unfortunately, he has not yet visited Ghana to see my home.\n\nOf all my English friends, only Peter Barker has stayed and worked in Ghana. For twenty-eight years he stayed in Ghana, first as editor of a monthly, “The New Nation” and later as a Presbyterian priest.\n\nI first met Peter after an OICCU meeting one afternoon during the first term of my first year. He was reading History at Teddy Hall. He was instantly and genuinely friendly and I reciprocated. I invited him to tea in my college and he in turn invited me to spend my first Christmas holidays in his home at 38 Pope’s Grove, Twickenham. He was a chorister at St. Stephen’s Church near Twickenham and I joined the choir during the Christmas holidays serenading with carols from house to hospital. My love of the Choir of King’s College, Cambridge, was first aroused at Peter’s house on 23rd December, 1949, a day before Christmas Eve. I was sitting by the fireside with Mr. Charles Barker, Peter’s father, listening to the radio, when there beamed out melodious voices of the Choir singing “Once in Royal David’s City”. Apparently it was a processional carol sung as the Choir was entering King’s College Chapel. I was enthralled as they sang carol after carol. Papa Barker’s “beautiful”, “this is beautiful”, as the choir sang summed up my own feelings that night. I was particularly overjoyed when the Choir rendered “In Dulce Jubilo”. Since that night I have tried to listen to the Choir of King’s College every Christmas Eve. If I did not spend my holidays in England, I played the latest carols by the King’s College Choir.\n\nRev. Peter Barker has been an indefatigable Christian worker with the Christian Council, having taught for a number of years at the Akuapemman Secondary School at Akropong. His humanity and his ready assistance to whoever needs his help are outstanding. Whether he came to Ghana because of our friendship or because of the challenge Ghana offered, it has been difficult to surmise. But I can testify from my own experience of his person that he has been a man of God who has served mankind and loved his neighbor as himself, thus fulfilling one of the greatest Commandments of our Lord Jesus Christ. He has sacrificed his own welfare, his wife’s and his children’s to labor in the Lord’s vineyard, without counting the cost. Sometimes, I have felt guilty because he was toiling in my country while I was, for most of the time, my country’s envoy abroad. Thanks to God, whenever he could make it, he stayed at our house in Winneba. He has been a great influence in my life.\n\nBut apart from such kind friends I have mentioned from whom I have learnt a great deal, Oxford itself had a profound influence on me, especially in my outlook and thinking. It was there that I had a peep into the British way of life. It was there that I developed a love of British institutions and British constitutional and political history. It was there that my Christian faith got jolted and I had a mental revolution regarding relation. It was there that my political ambitions got sharpened. It was there that I developed a vigorous independence of mind.\n\nI went up to Oxford thinking that I was a Christian and a budding politician. What happened to my political ambitions will be reserved for a later chapter. But what jolted my Christian faith was a matter of great concern to me.\n\nI had been brought up to regard reverend ministers and priests as models of elegance and perfection. When I discovered that they were fallible and even not up to the standards of conduct inculcated in me in the Gold Coast, I became palpably disenchanted.\n\nAt the Methodist elementary school, I was caned when I failed to go to church. At Mfantsipim School, it was compulsory to attend church. We marched to Wesley Chapel every Sunday morning in the sun, a distance of about three miles. If I did not attend Wesley, I had to work in a village near Cape Coast as a member of the Mfantsipim Evangelical Group (MEG), preaching a sermon or dispensing medicine, or cleaning a wound and putting medicated cotton wool on it and bandaging it. At Achimota, I was a staunch member of the SCM. At Oxford I began to attend the College Chapel and also the local Methodist Church. But I had taken my faith for granted and I had not accepted Christ meaningfully and by faith.\n\nThe test of my faith came, when I attended church, especially in the London area, and I found pews empty with a few elderly people around, when I began to observe the behavior of people who claimed to be Christians but did not measure up to standards and when, again outside Oxford, I noticed color prejudice in some churches I visited. True, I had learnt years before what Aggrey of Africa had once said that there was a vast difference between Christianity and “Church-i-anity”. And if I had been more introspective and had accepted Christ, I would not have reacted the way I did. I stopped going to church and began to be suspicious of anyone who professed to be a Christian. It was a curious period of doubt and uncertainty and when I began to read moral philosophy, my doubt became complete. In a word, I was in a state of utter confusion. I was in that state until I graduated.\n\nBut it seemed that I was not completely beyond the pale of religious reasoning. As soon as I returned to Ghana, I wrote to my friend Tony Wilmot. Although I had followed his prescription by reading my Bible with the guide of Scripture Union daily notes which he had sent me, and read carefully a book Tony also sent to me called “Who Moved the Stone”, I still entertained doubts as to the need for religion at all. Like my friend, John Black who was an avowed atheist, I believed that the Jews of Europe would not have been massacred by Hitler and his cohorts if there had been God. How could six million Jews be killed just like that with God looking on?\n\nAs luck would have it, I had to return to England in 1954 barely two years after my return from Oxford to attend a conference on African administration at Cambridge and to undertake a six months’ course for Labor Officers from different parts of the Commonwealth. I spent the Christmas of 1954 with John Black and his parents in Birmingham. It was while I was staying with the Black family that I gained an insight into my own religion, which changed my state of mind. Papa Black and I got into a discussion about religion one day. He informed me of his parents’ plans for him to become a rabbi, being of the Jewish faith. He was a mathematical wrangler at Cambridge and had read about the various world relations. He reiterated what John, my friend, had maintained that no God would stand by in the face of Hitler’s extermination of six million Jews. However, he went on to say that the Christian religion appealed to him immensely. Christ’s precepts to turn the other cheek when you are struck on one cheek, love thy neighbor as thyself, and lastly, obey God and do His will were too profound to be ignored. Unwittingly, the old man had set me to think from a fresh angle. It was clear to me that if I could follow these precepts I would be Christ-like. After all, on reflection, my communion with God was personal and did not require the stamp of approval from any individual. Through an atheist, I had discovered the spirit of truth. I could not love my neighbor as myself if I did not know myself. I began then to examine myself and that was the starting point of my embracing the Christian faith as I know it today.\n\nThe last great influence on my life at Oxford was our wedding at the Park Lane Methodist Church in Norwich on 7th April 1951. Elsie, who had been engaged to me on 18th December 1948, won a Methodist Mission scholarship to do a Diploma in Education at the Norwich Teachers Training College, then affiliated to Cambridge University. She came to Norwich in the summer of 1950. The wedding was conducted by Rev. Mr. Barnes assisted by the Chaplain of the Norwich Training College, Rev. Mr. Cyster. Elsie was given away by the Mayor of Norwich, Mr. Dickson, whose son was an administrative officer in Ghana. It was an exciting moment for me. Friends came to Norwich to attend the wedding from different parts of England. There was Henry K. Richardson and L. Y. Graham from Ghana doing accountancy in Norwich, Kwame Bosque-Hamilton, a good friend from my Achimota days who came from Nottingham to be my best man. My friends John Black and Peter Barker also came to grace the occasion. Elsie’s friends from the Training College all came to the wedding, which was widely reported in the local press.\n\nThus, I spent three full and active years at Oxford. It was not easy to leave friends and well-wishers and tutors who had contributed to my acquisition of knowledge and experience. Mr. Bird and her family took very good care of me in my last year when I moved from college into “digs” at 46 St. John’s Street. My room was comfortable and I was privileged to have my breakfast in bed throughout the whole year! After school, I took a leave of the University and went down to London.\n\nMy wife also completed her Diploma in Education with distinction in the summer of 1952, and she and our son, Egya Akumbia, who had been born on 10th September 1951 joined me at 16 Park Road, Radhill, Surrey, where I was staying with Heinz Hellin and his mother.\n\nHaving completed our studies in England, my wife and I decided to have a real honeymoon on the continent of Europe to supplement the short honeymoon we had enjoyed at Oxford after our wedding in Norwich. Luckily we had been invited to a Quaker Conference held at Harlem in the Netherlands. Therefore, we left our ten-month-old son with a private nanny who had seven English children under her care at home. It was our first trip to the continent of Europe and we made the most of it. We visited Amsterdam where we had a boat ride, visited F. Haals museum in Harlem, and went to The Hague, Volendam and Edam where we visited the famous cheese market. We saw the Great Dyke and crossed the Zuyder Sea.\n\nThe conference itself was useful. The theme was Peace in our time. There were young men and women from Yugoslavia, Spain, Greece, France, Germany, Holland, Ghana, the United States, the Republic of China, England, India, the West Indies, Scandinavia and Latin America. It was a veritable international gathering and by the time the conference was over, we had gained mutual understanding, respect and the worth and dignity of the human person. At the very beginning, the young delegates from Yugoslavia would not talk to the Spaniards or the Greeks. Soon, there was harmony all round. We were all determined to fight for peace in our time.\n\nFrom The Hague, Elsie and I took the train to Paris where we spent three glorious days before we crossed over to Dover and London to be reunited with our son. Incidentally, Egya looked healthy and cheerful, but we discovered that his hair was untidy and disheveled. Apparently, the English nanny could not manage the crinkly hair of an African!\n\nAt last, we received notification of our bookings on the mv Aureol which would sail from Liverpool in September. It was from Radhill that we left for Liverpool and home. It has been a terrific experience staying in England for three years to be prepared for the task ahead. I had seen something of Britain and Europe. I had acquired some little knowledge. I had received rude knocks of racial prejudice. I had come to appreciate classical music. I had made many friends. I had acquired a wife and got a son. I had had my doubts. Thenceforth, I was ready to face life with confidence.\n\nChapter 2 – FIVE YEARS AT MFANTSIPIM\n\nIn 1941 I entered the portals of Mfantsipim Secondary School situated on Kwabotwe Hill in Cape Coast. Mfantsipim’s nickname is “Kwabotwe”.\n\nMfantsipim had a rather chequered history before it got going on 12th November 1907 with the arrival of the Rev. W. T. Balmer. The School was established on 3rd April 1987 as Wesleyan High School. In 1891, it became known as Wesleyan Collegiate School. The first principal was James Picot, who was about eighteen years old then and possessed only the College of Preceptors Certificate. James Picot was the brother of the Rev. Thomas R. Picot who was then Chairman of the Methodist District of Ghana (then the Gold Coast).\n\nAs the fortunes of the school waned, two illustrious old boys, J. Mensah-Sarbah, who later became one of the greatest Ghanaian jurists, and William Edward Sam, decided to do something to save it, and found a truly national school. The “Fanti Public Schools Ltd.” Was formed by a number of stalwart Methodists and the school was formally opened on 3rd April 1905 as Mfantsipim. According to Mr. F. L. Bartels in his “Roots of Ghana Methodism”, pages 165 – 167, the opening service was conducted by the Rev. A. W. Parker of Methodist fame. “The hymn “O God of Bethel” which still remains the opening hymn of the school’s Founder’s Day Service was followed by the reading of Job 28 by “Father” Brown, President of the Aborigines Rights Protection Society. “The school motto”, said J. Mensah-Sarbah, when he rose to speak, “is not in Latin or English, but in plain Fante, ‘Dwen Hwe Kan’ (Think and look ahead). Three months later, it was decided on the initiative of Bartrop (the Reverend Chairman of the Methodist District) that the new foundation and the older Collegiate School should be amalgamated under the name of Mfantsipim. Mfantsipim began again, this time with 17 pupils, but soon got into difficulties in the face of keen competition from the Cape Coast Grammar School which was to continue until Egyir Assam (a former Assistant Headmaster of the Collegiate School who had retired in 1898) [my own brackets] decided to rejoin the Methodist Ministry. On 12th November 1907 the Rev. W. T. Balmer, Principal of Richmond College, Freetown, reached Cape Coast on a commission of inspection of Wesleyan School on the West Coast, his aim being to promote the educational work of the Church, particularly in the matter of establishing secondary education on a firm footing, and to formulate a plan whereby the Methodist districts in West Africa could work together and feed a central college, in which ministers and laymen would be trained. Balmer found eight boys at Mfantsipim, whom he christened “The Faithful Eight”. The School had only eight names upon its roll, and there was no staff, the last headmaster, the Rev. J. Delaney Russell, having left the country for his leave in England on July 18. These boys were meeting for mutual help. Balmer had found little support for his work at Richmond College, Freetown, most of whose students had in any case come from Ghana; but here, in Cape Coast, were “The Faithful Eight”, as encouraging a group for him as were the Bible Band of thirteen for Dunwell (the first Methodist Missionary to arrive in Ghana in 1835) and with the added persuasion of Bartrop, he remained as headmaster and built alongside Mfantsipim a Richmond College where the training of ministers was restarted.”\n\nWhen I went to Mfantsipim in 1941, it had already established its reputation as the oldest and best secondary school my country could boast of. For Ghana, Mfantsipim is the ancient seat of learning. Our main rival was Adisadel College (formerly called St. Nicholas Grammar School) and as Oxford regards Cambridge as “the other place” so does Mfantsipim look upon Adisadel.\n\nI was quick to learn that the motto of Mfantsipim is “Dwen Hwe Kan”. Most “greenhorns” (that is how newcomers to Mfantsipim are called) would translate the motto, which is in the Fante language, as “Aim High” which did not earn them any marks at all. It is the literal translation as handed down by the great J. Mensah-Sarbah which was acceptable. The motto means “Think and Look Ahead” which underlines the ambitions and purposes of the founders and all those who struggled hard to build a great educational institution for Ghana. As my master, Mr. F. L. Bartels makes clear in his book to which I have referred, Africans like Egyir Assam, J. Mensah-Sarbah, W. E. Sam, R. A. Harrison, J. E. Biney and D. Myles Abadoo, and Europeans like James Picot, Rev. A. T. Bartrop, Rev. W. T. Balmer, and the Rev. R. A. Lockhart looked upon Mfantsipim as a precious gem possessed by Ghana. As Principal Balmer once wrote in a letter to the great J. Mensah-Sarbah, “I want to raise up a generation of men in the Mfantsipim School who will be brave enough to face the problems of their own continent, practically and unselfishly.”\n\nFor a whole year I was considered a “greenhorn” as was the tradition. On my arrival at Kwabotwe, I was directed to carry my boxes to Freeman House, which was to remain my house for the next four years. There were in my time four houses on the Hill. Freeman, which sported the green color; Sarbah, red; Balmer, blue; and Lockhart, yellow. Every “greenhorn” had to learn quickly the history of the school, the nicknames of the masters and their foibles and susceptibilities. It was a must for a “greenhorn” to learn about the “Faithful Eight” but for whose tenacity of purpose Mfantsipim would have collapsed. It did not take me much time to learn that Sarbah House was named for J. Mensah-Sarbah, an old boy, by whose efforts the “Fante Public Schools Ltd.” was promoted to found a truly national school named Mfantsipim. It was Sarbah who announced the motto of the school and explained its meaning. Sarbah was really a great benefactor to whom Mfantsipim owes an eternal debt. Freeman House was named after Thomas Birch Freeman, one of the greatest Methodist missionaries whose length of service from 1838 to 1890 must have surpassed any other missionaries in 19th century Ghana. His work extended to various parts of the country. He first went to Kumasi on 1st April 1839 and his work in Ashanti was monumental. Balmer House was named after the Rev. W. T. Balmer who discovered the “Faithful Eight” in 1907. Inspired by those eight boys he decided to stay on instead of returning to Richmond College in Freetown, and become one of the most effective headmasters Mfantsipim has known. One of the “Faithful Eight” was William Essuman Gwira Sackey. He was later known as Kobina Sekyi, a barrister, philosopher and politician who became an ardent Ghanaian nationalist and a member of the Aborigines Rights Protectionist Society. He was the author of “The Blinkards” a play lampooning senseless imitation by Ghanaians of everything English. The fourth house was named after the Rev. R. A. Lockhart who became headmaster of Mfantsipim from February 1925 to March 1936. He was known as a fearless fighter for the rights of Mfantsipim in the face of the colonial government’s partiality towards Achimota School. He was an effective administrator and a brilliant leader. He infused into Mfantsipim boys including Old Boys, love of school and the need to maintain the highest of standards. Under him, Mfantsipim examination results were the best year by year throughout West Africa. According to Mr. F. L. Bartels in his book under reference page 200, “To Lockhart more than to any other person does Mfantsipim owe its unique position; founder of secondary schools in Ghana in the first half of the twentieth century wanted the new institutions to be modeled on Mfantsipim; among those were Accra Academy and Wesley Grammar School in the east, Fijai in the west and Tamale in the north.”\n\nThere was a healthy rivalry among the four houses in sports – athletics, football, hockey and cricket – in cleanliness, through Wednesday afternoon inspections by the Senior House Master sometimes accompanied by the Headmaster himself, and in academic results. Freeman House was noted for providing the “Scholar of the Year” in my time at Mfantsipim. No “greenhorn” could really settle down at Mfantsipim until he has been formally initiated into the school by the Head Prefect or S.P. as Mfantsipim Head Boys were called. I still remember the day I was initiated on that Saturday night in January 1941 in the Assembly Hall. The School Prefect in 1941 was Paa Kayper Mensah, who later read the Natural Sciences Tripos at Cambridge and became an accomplished poet and educationist. In the afternoon, all “greenhorns” were put in classrooms and were requested to give written answers dealing with the history and current events and gossip of the school. We were made to feel that our continued stay at Mfantsipim depended on the results of the examination. Many a weak-kneed “greenhorn” fainted for failing to answer the questions, convinced that they would be “sent down” for failing.\n\nIn the evening, each of us carried a broom stick and a bucket, and clothed in white bed sheets we paraded on the stage before the full glare of all assembled. The School Prefect, Mr. Kayper Mensah, moving around like some High Priest then intoned. Then the whole school assembled sang the traditional song welcoming “greenhorns” to Mfantsipim, ending in the chorus “O Greenhorns, Greenhorns, Greenhorns, Greenhorns”! We had been accepted as full members of the school, and from then on we could walk around with our chests out as proud Mfantsipim boys. Of course, the bullying of “greenhorns” continued. Senior boys, that is, those in Forms five and six sent you on various errands, washing their towels and handkerchiefs or preparing “gari” for them. And any boy who entered the school a year before a “greenhorn” could bully. I remember an incident on the very day of my arrival when a tall boy ordered me to carry his box to his dormitory and, generally, threw his weight about, asking me questions about Mfantsipim which he knew I could not provide the answers. “Who is ‘Bui-buo’? Have you seen Caliban around?” Later on I discovered that this particular boy had been in Form one and had just been promoted to Form 2B. I was placed in Form 2A! Apparently “Boo-boo” was a nickname given to Mr. Obeng-Addae who taught me English in Forms 2 and 3: and “Caliban” a character in Shakespeare’s “Tempest” referred to Mr. Quarshie who taught me geometry in From 2. Mr. Quarshie is now a doctor of medicine.\n\nI spent five glorious years at Mfantsipim. Unlike the elementary school where one teacher was in charge of one class, at Mfantsipim, there was a teacher for each subject. My first impression at school was to see boys from different parts of the country, moving in groups and speaking their own languages. There were Fantes, Twis, Gas, Ashantis, Ewes, Nigerians and so on, all at “Kwabotwe”. What linked us together was English which we all spoke in our different intonations. I quickly made many friends, some of whom have remained friends to this day, like David Darko-Mensah (D. D. as we called him), Atta Annan Mensah who had been a friend from Winneba, E. K. Newman, Heman-Ackah, Napoleon Tamakloe, Kodwo and Kweku Haizel, Nana de Graft Johnson, K. Y. Arkaah and K. N. Arkaah, Archie Ocran and a number of others who still communicate with me on occasion. Such were the close bonds which Mfantsipim forged among its boys.\n\nAt Mfantsipim I learnt how to use the library thanks to Mr. F. L. Bartels, who taught me English Literature and Bible Knowledge in Form 2. It was really in Form 2 that a firm foundation was laid for us. I remember even now our Latin master, Mr. Michael F. Dei-Anang, taking those of us in Form 2A to the Assembly Hall to demonstrate and explain to us the four configurations in Latin. He would walk around the stage shouting “ambulo”, “ambulo” meaning “I am walking”, “I am walking”; then he would sit down and say “sedeo” meaning “I am sitting down”; then he would get up and say “surgo” meaning “I rise”; he would then continue ambulating and then turn and walk towards the chair and say “revenio” meaning “I am returning.” Mr. Dei-Anang taught us Latin until we reached Form 4, but by the end of Form 4, I was able to do “Unseens” given to the higher forms. At the Cambridge School Certificate examination, I obtained an A which meant that I had a distinction in Latin and came top in that subject. I have singled out Latin to show how Mfantsipim made sure that the boys started on a firm footing from Form 2. We had in Form 2, Mr. C. M. O. Mate, then the Senior Housemaster and Sports master to teach us History. Mr. Mate later left the school to become a government inspector of schools.\n\nApart from my masters, Mr. Bartels, Mr. Dei-Anang and Mr. Mate whom I have mentioned, other masters who taught me and made a lasting impression were Mr. Charles Quaye (History in Forms 5 and 6), Mr. Hugh Mills (Algebra and Geometry), Mr. George Ackumey (English Language and Literature in Forms 5 and 6) and Mr. Walton (Fante and Bible Knowledge). All Mfantsipim masters were really dedicated and as most of them were themselves Old Boys, they insisted on excellence and inspired us to aim at great achievements. My favorite subjects were really History, Latin and English Literature. Although I did well in Mathematics and General Science, I was certain by the time I got to Form 4 that I would plump for the Arts and not Science. As far as extra-curricular activities were concerned, I played cricket for my house and school (I was supposed to be a fast bowler), football, hockey and table tennis for my house. I was also a high jumper and hurdler for my house and hurdled for the school at the Inter-Collegiate Sports Competition. I was not really excellent in any of the sports, except table tennis which I played very well. After leaving Mfantsipim, I was tried in the Oxford Three to face Cambridge. I did not make it!\n\nAt Mfantsipim in those days, there were two particular clubs, Kwabotwe Circle and the Study Club, membership of which was considered prestigious. Kwabotwe Circle generally attracted those boys who were interested in history and public affairs. It was reputed to be the breeding ground for future politicians. Members were privileged to invite political stalwarts to Mfantsipim to speak to them. A notable politician and philosopher whom we invited or whose house we were permitted to visit was Kobina Sekyi, Barrister-at-Law who was well known for his being an outspoken and uncompromising critic of the then colonial government of Ghana. Through the Kwabotwe Circle, I learnt a lot about the characters in “Gold Coast Men of Affairs”, a book written by Mr. Magnus Sampson who had received his Bachelor of Arts degree from Fourah Bay College, Sierra Leone, and had become Secretary of the Joint Provincial Council of Chiefs. Learning about the life and work of men like J. Mensah Sarbah, J. E. Caseley-Hayford also an Old Boy who was the founder of the Congress of West Africa, and Dr. Nanka-Bruce influenced my political thinking to a very large degree.\n\nThe Study Club, which in my time, was under the chairmanship of Mr. F. L. Bartels, concerned itself with the Arts and Sciences. It was really high-brown and like the Kwabotwe Circle, a boy was thoroughly betted before he got admission. One memorable talk was by Dr. Hall, an English Medical Officer at Cape Coast, who spoke to us on “the human machine.” It was more of a lecture on physiology but the treatment of the subject was exciting and must have decided some students to take up medicine as a career.\n\nI belonged to these two clubs. I was particularly active in the Kwabotwe Circle and in looking back, my profound interest as a student of political history and international affairs stemmed from my humble membership of that club.\n\nIn my last year in 1945, I became the Head Prefect (S. P.) of Mfantsipim. In those days, there was a convention that any boy who became the Secretary of the Saturday Night Entertainment Committee (SNEC) would invariably become S. P. the following year. Of course, it was not so in every case, and in 1943 a Day Boy, Mr. Joe C. de Graft became the S. P. In 1944, my immediate predecessor, George Odamten, who spoke rather fluent English, was also a surprise choice for S. P. The point about the secretaryship of SNEC was that the whole school voted by ballot to elect the secretary. I was so elected in 1944 as secretary. But the choice of the boys would not be the person preferred by those who chose the S.P. The choice was made by a “College of Electors” comprising the Headmaster, the Senior Housemaster, Housemasters and other members of Staff and the outgoing House Prefects led by their S.P. The Headmaster would have someone in mind different from the Senior Housemaster’s or the outgoing S.P.’s. To choose an S.P., there were a number of considerations: the person must be academically sound, that is, he must be considered excellent by his peers (his own classmates), his character must be good, he must be a good leader or have the makings of one and, above all, he must be courteous and must speak good English.\n\nWhen my name was announced before the school assembled by the Acting Headmaster, Mr. F. L Bartels, after having announced the names of prefects and their assistants for the four houses, it was received with thunderous acclamation by the boys. It was on one morning in December 1944. At once, I became the acclaimed leader of Mfantsipim boys and upon my shoulders rested the discipline and general demeanor of all the boys at school. The House Prefects who were elected to assist me in the discharge of my responsibilities were: E. K. Newman assisted by P. E. Paintsil for Balmer House; D. D. Mensah assisted by J. Assami for Freeman House; T. C. Addo assisted by S. E. Attafuah for Lockhart House; and A. A. Armattoe assisted by E. G. Biney for Sarbah House.\n\nThe crowning point of my stay at Mfantsipim was at the Speech and Founders Day in November 1945. I delivered the Senior Prefect’s speech. From all accounts, it went down well. By that time, a new Headmaster had arrived in 1945 to take over from the Acting Headmaster, Mr. Bartels. He was the Rev. Alec A. Sneath who had been Headmaster of the school before in 1911. He told me after my speech that he would like me to be a minister of the Gospel. He had been impressed and he thought I had a gift of advocacy which should be put to the service of the Methodist Church. The general comment from the boys was that they were pleasantly surprised my stammer completely vanished during my speech, because I used to stutter a bit. Suddenly, I had become Demosthenes, the ancient Greek orator who was himself a stammerer! Of course, the school was delighted that I was able to wrench from the Headmaster two days’ holidays, instead of the traditional one after a Speech Day. Soon after the Speech Day came the Cambridge School Leaving Certificate Examinations. There were forty-nine boys in my class of 1945, having started in Form 2 with 103 of us. A lot had fallen by the way side. Some had left school because their parents could not afford to continue paying their school fees. Some had to repeat their classes. Others died or left the school because they simply could not keep up with the pace and spate of work. Out of the 49 boys who were presented by the school, only one failed. We obtained 37 exemptions from the London Matriculation and the Cambridge Previous. I was one of the four boys who obtained five distinctions (i.e. “A”s) and three credits. The others were E. K. Newman, who is now Doctor of Medicine, Mr. J. A. Owusu (later to be called Owusu-Acheampong) who became Ghana’s Chief Auditor and then High Commissioner to Australia, and Mr. Kow Esiboa de Graft Johnson who became Professor of Sociology at the Universities of Ghana and Kenya.\n\nAnd so, I had spent five years as a boarder at Mfantsipim? However, as we were about to leave the school, Mr. Bartels invited me, Mr. E. K. Newman, Mr. K. E. de Graft Johnson, Mr. K. Y. Arkaah and Mr. E. G. Biney to return to the school for special studies. That great man was looking ahead and must have seen in each of us some potential which must be developed. Mr. Bartels never gave us any reason s for the invitation. All I knew was that I had become an S.P. and, perhaps I had become someone to be watched.\n\nWhen we returned to school in 1946, we spent one term in a bungalow which was known to the school as Bungalow No. 4. Mr. Bartels gave us a reading list, and under his guidance we read and discussed literature and current issues. Unfortunately, after a term Mr. Bartels left for the United Kingdom to be groomed to take up the Headmastership of Mfantsipim which at the time had been occupied by ordained ministers. We dispersed. Mr. Biney left Ghana for Manchester University at the instance of his father. My other colleagues left for their homes. I was invited to teach at Mfantsipim. It was a great privilege to become Assistant House Master of Sarbah House with Mr. Mante, now a Medical Officer, who was the substantive House Master. I taught Latin, English and Bible Knowledge in Forms 2 and 3. Meantime, I sat and passed the entrance examination to Achimota to further my studies for the London University Intermediate Arts degree (Inter B.A.). My class was called Inter ’48 (Arts). Incidentally I met at Achimota, my classmate and friend, Mr. E. K. Newman who had also passed the entrance examination to do Inter B.Sc.\n\nChapter 1: EARLY LIFE AND EDUCATION\n\nI was born at Winneba in Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast at 10:00 p.m. on 9th August, 1924. My mother, Ekua Kwesiwa, was baptized and christened as Alberta Quaison at the Catholic Church in Sekondi where she was born on 17th October, 1905. Her father was Joseph Edmundson Quaison, alias Kodwo Bordoh born in 1884 at Ewusiajo near Sekondi, in the Western Region of Ghana. Her mother was Nana Yaaba of the Royal Anona family of Apowa also near Sekondi-Takoradi in the Western Region. Thus, my mother was of the Ahanta tribe, who inhabit all that vast area from Shanna to Dixcove and Busua in the Western Region. My maternal grandmother died when my mother was nine years old. Therefore, my grandfather, Mr. Quaison, took my mother and her two younger sisters with him wherever he went on transfer. Grandpa Quaison was a Sanitary Inspector-cum-dispenser, specially trained in those days to assist in the combating of yellow fever, small-pox and malaria.\n\nWhen my mother was ten years old, her father was transferred from Sekondi to Saltpond and then to Winneba. Mr. Quaison brought his three daughters along with him to Winneba. He and his daughter were Roman Catholics. Unfortunately, there was no Catholic church in Winneba at that time, and so my mother was encouraged to join the Wesleyan Methodist Church where she was confirmed. She liked to sing and so she threw herself body and soul into the Singing Band. I have been informed by her contemporaries that my mother had a beautiful treble voice and she used to sing solos in church. She was also attractive and beautiful. There were a number of suitors who did not dare approach her because she we under the eagle eyes of “Papa Town Council” as my grandfather was affectionately called.\n\nSanitary Inspectors in those days had authority to enter homes to make sure that drinking water was free from bacteria and that the environment was kept clean. My grandfather worked directly under the British Medical Officer of Health of Winneba. People in Winneba were therefore in awe of him and held him in high esteem. He himself remained a staunch Catholic to the end. He retired from the Civil Service in 1935 as a Senior Health Inspector, one of the first Africans to have held such “European” post. He later became a member of the Sekondi-Takoradi Municipal Council, and then Treasurer and Paymaster of the Ahanta Confederation. He died in January 1964 at the age of eighty.\n\nMy father was Alex Emmanuel Sackey, alias Kweku Sekyi. His father was Emmanuel Kodwo Sackey, alias Kodwo Sei who was a carpenter by trade but became quite wealthy though the fishing business. He was reputed to have introduced dragnet seine fishing to Winneba, an innovation which was very unpopular among Winneba fishermen about 1900. My father’s mother was Adwoa Aferba, a fishmonger and trader who established a flourishing trade in salted fish and trotters (salted pig feet).\n\nMy father was born in Winneba on 24th July 1902. He attended the Methodist Elementary School where he passed the Standard Seven School leaving certificate examination. He continued his education at the West African College of Music and Commerce established and run by Professor Charles Graves, a noted educationist, at Cape Coast where he specialized in music, accountancy and bookkeeping. He was a good chorister and continued as a member of the choir on the completion of his secondary education. It was while he was a chorister that he met my mother. Apparently, he was attractive to young ladies and was quite a “bon vivant”.\n\nHis courting of my mother was vigorously opposed by my grandfather, Mr. Quaison, who was very much attached to his daughters and was suspicious of young men who tried to court his daughters. He wanted to be sure that any young man who married his daughters would take good care of them.\n\nAt this time in 1923, the Paramount Chief of Winneba was my father’s elder brother. Therefore when my grandfather became unbending and difficult, my father who was really in love with my mother solicited the assistance of his elder brother. The chief, Nana Ayirebi-Acquah III, popularly known as Kow Sackey, intervened by sending a delegation to seek the hand of my mother in marriage. My mother told me that she was also in love with my father, and that when one day she saw a group of people coming to her father’s residence, comprising two elderly men, one holding a linguist stick, and two old ladies, she knew that her fate was going to be decided. The delegation duly conveyed the greetings of Nana Ayirebi-Acquah and explained the purpose of their visit to Mr. Quaison. Mr. Quaison was then staying at the house of Mr. Kwamena John Ghartey, son of King Ghartey IV of the Fante Confederacy fame, who had been Chief of Winneba from 1871 to 1897. Certain customary rites were performed and my grandfather agreed to convey his reply in due course. Meantime he was advised discreetly to vacate his opposition because he could not possibly turn down the chief’s request without incurring his displeasure. He therefore sent a delegation of elders to the chief with the customary drinks conveying his reply in the affirmative. My grandfather had yielded, but not until he had been given a firm assurance that, if he was transferred from Winneba, my mother Alberta Quaison would be in safe hands. It so happened that Nana Ayirebi-Acquah belonged to the Anona Clan, the same clan as my mother’s. Thus, as traditionally persons of the same clan regard themselves and brothers and sisters, my mother’s safety and security was guaranteed. And so, after all the customary rites of betrothal were performed, my father and mother got married. There were eight children of this marriage, five of whom were female. I am the first child of that marriage. My father turned out to be a polygamist in the tradition of his fathers and brothers, and when he died in January 1972, he left behind seven men and eleven women as his offspring.\n\nAnd so it was that I saw the light of day at Papa Kwamena John Ghartey’s house at Winneba. After my birth, my mother moved to join my father at my paternal grandfather’s house, popularly known as “Adanse” where I grew up under very congenial conditions.\n\nWinneba itself lies forty-three miles west of Accra, the capital of Ghana. It is a coastal town nestling around a bay and boldly facing the Atlantic Ocean. The inhabitants call it Simpa, after the founder and first chief called Nana Osimpan or Tumpa. But Europeans called it Winneba. The name Winneba is said to be derived from “Windy Bay”, so called by the Europeans who found the sea at Winneba rather windy. Jean Barbot, a Huguenot, was supposed to have sailed by the “Windy Bay” in 1679 and to have seen some fifty huts.\n\nWinneba must have been inhabited about the 16th century. According to Professor A. W. Lawrence who was formerly Professor of Classical Archaeology at Cambridge and subsequently became Professor of Archaeology at the Ghana University and also Director of the National Museum and Monuments in Ghana, the British built and completed a fort in Winneba around 1727. In his book “Trade Castles and Forts of West Africa”, Professor Lawrence wrote at page 68 “The people of Winneba, where the English eventually (1812) destroyed their fort in disgust, after the murder of the Commander, had roused the Governor in Council twenty years earlier (that is in 1792) to declare: “the Winneba people have not only now, but for many years past behaved themselves in a manner that requires the severest punishment; they having at all times (within my recollections) acted as if they would be master and not subjects to the English nation.”\n\nThe people the “Governor in Council” was referring to in 1792 are the Efutu people, being a mixture of Fantes and Guans, of which I am one. The Commandant of the fort at Winneba referred to by Professor Lawrence was James Meredith. According to our history, the Chief and people of Winneba got news of an impending attack by the Ashanti warriors. Therefore, they collected all their gold, jewelry, and other valuable possessions and took them to James Meredith for safekeeping, while their able-bodied men sallied forth to face the Ashantis. After the skirmishes were over, which resulted in the routing of the enemy, the Winneba Chief and people returned to claim from Meredith what they had left behind in the fort for safekeeping. Our history tells us that James Meredith had sent all the gold and other valuables to England and had refused a refund or compensation. And so, on one Saturday morning, the people assembled before the fort and drummed all night, warning Meredith that they would kill him the following day, being a Sunday, if he did not produce the gold and other valuables. Meantime, the grass lands near the “Mbonyi” lagoon at Winneba had been burnt. On the Sunday, the Commandant was seized and taken to the prickly grass lands, where he was made to walk barefoot while the people beat drums and chanted war songs. Meredith died as a result of this harsh treatment. News of this torture eventually reached Freetown, Sierra Leone and a “Man of War” was dispatched to Winneba to destroy not only the fort but the whole of Winneba.\n\nAfter the destruction of the fort, the chief and his elders went to the “Man of War” by canoes to plead for peace. The peace offering was made by tendering gold to the captain of the ship. Today, Meredith Street in Winneba remains as a reminder of the former Commander of the fort. In the place of the fort a Methodist Chapel was built. Once every year the people drum the same message to James Meredith on that fateful Saturday in 1812 “tomorrow we shall kill James” (okyena Kwesi, yekum James – repeated many times), during the annual Deer Hunt Festival.\n\nThe main occupation of the Winneba people is fishing and so the town is essentially a fishing port. It was a busy sea port by the middle of the 19th century. Ocean liners and merchant ships anchored about one mile away. They brought imported goods like gunpowder, textiles, salted fish, salted beef, rice, alcohol, different types of canned goods, building materials and so on from Europe while they took away cocoa beans in sacks, cola, palm oil, palm kernel, spices and other tropical products from the hinterland.\n\nWhen I was a little boy, I saw “Albion” lorries loaded with cocoa and other products plying the Commercial Street, then the principal thoroughfare at Winneba, towards the beach. These loads were carried in open canoes to the ships. They returned loaded with imported cargo. The beach was a real hive of activity. Warehouses, the offices of the Elder Dempster Lines (a shipping company), Lighterage offices and the Customs Department were all located near the beach. There was also a busy Marine Police office around.\n\nThe population of Winneba in 1924 was quite sizeable, with Europeans and Syrian traders. The reigning Chief, Nana Ayirebi-Acquah III had been installed in 1919. He had attended Mfantsipim Secondary School and was to have been ordained as a Methodist minister when he succeeded his uncle, Chief Acquah II who had died in 1916. As an educated Chief, he encouraged commerce by personally inviting his British friends to set up businesses in Winneba. He hobnobbed with Colonial Governors and District Commissioners. He was extremely fluent in English and for 12 years was a member of the Legislative Council. This is why he attracted a lot of European firms and government establishments to Winneba. Under his leadership, much progress took place. Winneba boasted of coal-tarred roads, two hospitals, pipe-borne water supply and electricity, schools, modern markets, tennis courts and even a nine-hole golf course, with a flourishing European Club. This was at a time when very few places in Ghana could boast of such amenities. The Europeans and Syrians living in Winneba carried on commerce, while some were of government departments. For a long time, the Syrians and Lebanese were referred to as “Portuguese”. Because of the flourishing business, many people from other parts of Ghana and elsewhere were attracted to Winneba. The Methodist Church which had been established about 1835 provided a great meeting place and forum for the people. The schools were good, and time was when the sons of fishermen were literally forced to attend school.\n\nToday, Winneba has about 80,000 inhabitants. It boasts of 6 primary and middle schools, a number of day nurseries and preparatory schools, one secondary school, a nursing training school, the Specialist Teacher Training College, the Advanced Teacher Training College and the National Academy of Music. Incidentally, the premises of the Advanced Teacher Training College were actually built and known as the Kwame Nkrumah Ideological Institute. The first President of Ghana, Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah wanted the Institute to produce ideologues steeped in the socialist ideology, not only for Ghana but for other parts of Africa. In fact, freedom fighters from East, Central and Southern Africa came to be indoctrinated at this Institute which they regarded as the Mecca of African Socialism. In 1965, Ministers of State and top senior civil servants were directed to come to Winneba to imbibe socialist ideas so that, according to the President of Ghana, they could understand the direction towards which the country was being steered. It was a moot question whether they learnt anything, in fact. After the coup d’etat which overthrew the Nkrumah government, the place was turned into a Teacher Training College. Even Dr. Kwame Nkrumah’s statue embedded in a fully constructed marble column was destroyed under the personal supervision of Colonel Kotoka, the architect of the coup.\n\nI spent my childhood and boyhood days at Winneba which a German friend years later described as “a large beach village”. I was always at the beach. The problem in those days was that pipe-borne water was sold. There were also a number of wells at Winneba but the private owners sold the water, albeit more cheaply than pipe-borne water. Therefore most people, especially boys, had to sea-bathe. I really enjoyed the sea. There was always the danger of boys playing truant at the beach and not caring to go to school the whole day. I had myself begun schooling at Winneba and continued at Agona Swedru some fifteen miles inland from Winneba, where my father was engaged in the cocoa trade, buying cocoa from the cocoa producing areas like Nyakrom, Nkum, Odoben, Esikuma and Duakwa for his principals, F. A. Swanzy Limited. But my parents were concerned about the standard of education at Swedru which was not as reputable as the Winneba Methodist School. What was more, they were worried about my unauthorized bathing in the local river called “Akora”. In fact, one day I nearly drowned. I was lucky to be rescued by a Hausa man who was selling “kyinkyinga”, the local equivalent of shish-kebab. The Hausa man was one of a number of spectators on the bridge who saw me being carried away by the river which was in full flood. All I can remember was that as I was swallowing mouthfuls of water and was completely helpless, I was suddenly seized by some firm hands and taken to land. The Hausa man saved my life. I was then seven years old. My parents were naturally agitated by this drowning episode, and immediately sent me back to Winneba. I was taken to the infant class one of the Methodist elementary school.\n\nSoon after, my mother and father returned to Winneba. By 1931, the Great Depression which was global in nature had had a telling effect on the cocoa industry. My father was personally affected and was on the verge of bankruptcy. He had received from his principals, huge sums of money which he had paid out to farmers. But the cocoa product had become useless for lack of effective demand in the face of the depression, and so all that money had gone down the drain. My father’s assets were sold. He later joined the Lighterage Company in Winneba and then the G. F. Overbeck, a German trading company in 1933 until 1939 when the Second World War broke out.\n\nTo take up the story of my education, I settled down at the Methodist school. My teachers and friends called me Alex, as I had been baptized as Alexander at the Methodist Church at Winneba. Customarily, I had been named Kodwo See after my paternal grandfather. My father was never tired of telling me that the Sackey or Sekyi family was intelligent. He used to refer to my grandfather’s younger brother, Kwamena Gyate, who became a notable Methodist Minister, known as Rev. Ebenezer Amos Sackey, whose eldest son, Dr. Ebenezer Amos Sackey trained in Faraday House and rose to become the first Ghanaian Chief Electrical Engineer. Even at that young age, I was being urged to be serious in whatever I did. But I could not help being a boy. Boys will be boys they say, and I enjoyed swimming and playing the truant. My maternal grandfather was also concerned about my education and assisted my father financially liberally. As a favor to the old man who never had male children, my father decided that Quaison should be added to my name – hence the Quaison-Sackey.\n\nAs I have pointed out earlier, like most boys of my age at Winneba in those days, the sea was my first love. Every morning most school boys had a sea bath before they went to school. I would go to the beach, armed with a bottle of fresh water. I would have a swim, clean my body with sand which acted like a sponge, swim again and then come to firm land to wash myself with my bottle of fresh water, that is if my bottle had not meanwhile been stolen by some other boy! This daily ritual was scrupulously followed until I was about eleven years old when pipe borne water was free. School usually started at eight o’clock and woe to a boy or girl who came to school late. You would certainly be punished, and teachers in those days did not spare the cane.\n\nI enjoyed attending the Winneba Methodist elementary school, perhaps because of the challenges posed to me. I got caned for going late to school. I got caned for failing to attend choir practice. I even got caned for missing a church service on a Sunday. Discipline was strict, and many a boy or girl who could not cope with the rigors of school discipline simply dropped out. I was determined to complete my elementary school education and tried as much as possible not to be caught in the meshes of school regulations. Looking back, I sometimes wondered why I persisted in going to school against many odds. Perhaps it was because of the many challenges. For one thing, most of my playmates were children of fishermen who did not go to school because their parents could not afford the school fees which, in my time, amounted to two shillings and six pence in the lower classes and three shillings and six pence from Standards four to seven, at which Standard you had to pass the School Leaving Examination. For another, there were too many distractions for a boy. One could easily play the truant, playing at the beach, searching for mangoes or climbing coconut trees, a feat in which I excelled.\n\nBut I was lucky. My parents and my aunts who were my guardians in the absence of my parents tried very hard to restrain me from becoming wayward. And the fact that I became a chorister instilled in me some amount of discipline. I was also lucky to have teachers who were really dedicated and took their jobs rather seriously, in every sense of the word. They were disciplinarians of the highest order and very devoted indeed. In those days, one teacher was in charge of one class. He taught all subjects, including English, Arithmetic, writing, civics, bible knowledge, history and nature study. Before classes began at eight in the morning and when school closed for the day at 4 p.m., it was the practice for the whole school to assemble and sing and pray together. Once a week, a day was set aside to teach the pupils hymns and songs. For Arts and Crafts, there was a specialist teacher who taught the boys handicrafts, drawing, painting and clay modeling, basket weaving, door-mat making with coconut fiber or sisal hemp, rope making and carpentry. The girls had a Domestic Science teacher to teach them cookery, needlework, sewing and a host of other things which now go by the nomenclature of Home Economics. Each pupil belonged to one of five sections into which the whole school had been divided: red, green blue, gold and grey. Competitions were held periodically to decide which section kept the best garden and/or flower plots. End of term sports competitions were also held. I belonged to the green section throughout my elementary school days. No wonder then that green has been my favorite color. I was not particularly good at handicrafts and my drawing was atrocious. I did quite well, however, in subjects like reading, arithmetic, English and history. As far as extra-curricular activities were concerned, I played football reasonably well but I did not make the school team. My forte in sports was high jumping.\n\nIt is difficult for me to forget my teachers who influenced my life and career in later years. Teacher Arkorful taught me in Class One and, of course, he taught me how to add and to subtract and multiply, divide and spell. Another teacher who had a profound influence on me was Teacher Yanney in Class Three. In those days, it was considered a feat to jump from the junior school to a “higher grade”. Teacher Yanney gave us a sound grounding and made it possible for me to pass to the Standard One “A” where the veteran Master J. W. Quainoo really prepared pupils for higher things. I got my love of history and languages from Master Quainoo who had been Headmaster of the Methodist School at one time. As I write, he is an old man of 92, alert and spritely. I was the years old when I was in Master Quainoo’s class and I was first in his class in order of merit during the third term. There were no quick promotions in those days, but I did so well in Standard One that I was promoted from Standard One to Standard Three. However, my father did not like this jump, so I had to move back to Standard Two. In Standard Four I was taught by Teacher C. T. Yeboah who had come to the school in 1937 fresh from Wesley College where he had trained as a teacher after completing Mfantsipim School. It was Teacher C.T.Y., as we affectionately called Mr. Yeboah, who drummed into me the existence of a secondary school called Mfantsipim. He did have a tremendous impact on me. After two terms, he had to leave for a higher assignment at Mfantsipim. His place was taken over by another Mfantsipim Old Boy, Teacher S. A. Amoah. Before turning 13 years, I sat and passed the entrance examination to Mfantsipim Secondary School, but my father insisted that I had to complete my elementary schooling by hook or by crook. There was an erroneous notion in those days that it was better to possess a Standard Seven School Leaving Certificate than to have nothing at all, so that if your parents were unable to sponsor you for a secondary school education, you would have something to hold on to. There could also be financial mishaps in the family while one was at the secondary school, and my father felt that if I possessed a Standard Seven Certificate, a mere white sheet with the imprimatur of the Director of Education, I could always brandish it and it would secure me a job as a clerk or some village letter writer.\n\nI therefore continued to Standard Seven in 1940, where a bright old boy of the Methodist School who had performed brilliantly at Wesley College was the teacher, Mr. Robert R. Okyne, a really dedicated and good teacher, had come to teach in standard seven the previous year and his pupils had done better than in previous years. Teacher Okyne was an effective teacher but he was a martinet. He instilled in us his love of school, love of Winneba and love of the Gold Coast. He did not spare the cane at all. He tended to focus his attention on his bright students and singled them out for harsh punishment when they made, what he considered to be unpardonable mistakes. The one great thing I learnt from Teacher Okyne was precision in though and deed. He had rented a flat in my aunt’s house and so I was privileged to carry his books to school every morning. He insisted on our writing good essays. He seemed to like Dickens and so, some of us tried to read books like “A Tale of Two Cities” to acquire the “Dickensonian” Style. At the end of the day, Teacher Okyne had given us a solid foundation. It therefore did not come as a surprise that the Class of 1940 broke all previous school records by obtaining four distinctions. The color of the distinction certificate was blue any student who obtained it had his or her name placed on the honors board of the Methodist School. The four boys who scored distinctions were David Adwoku Barnes who proceeded to Achimota Teacher Training College and subsequently became an Assistant Director of Education in the Ghana Education Service. He also served in Zanzibar as an Education Advisor loaned by the Ghana Government. Then there was Atta Annan Mensah who continued his education at Mfantsipim, Achimota, Trinity College of Music in London and Northwestern University in Evanston, and subsequently became Professor of Music at the Universities of Cape Coast in Ghana and Ilorin in Nigeria. The third person was Richard S. Essandoh who also went to Mfantsipim and to Belfast University and subsequently became a Doctor of Medicine. The fourth person is the writer who went on to Mfantsipim, Achimota, Exeter College, Oxford and the London School of Economics, and subsequently became a Ghanaian diplomatist, rising to become Ambassador for Ghana at the United Nations, Cuba, Mexico and the United States, crowning his career as President of the United Nations General Assembly and then the Foreign Minister of Ghana.\n\nMy boyhood days at the Methodist School and at home were exciting. Discipline at home was not as strict as at school. My father and mother were stern, and as a boy I was in great awe of my father. My mother petted me somewhat, but she became mad at me when I showed insubordination or played the truant. She would either threaten that she would report me to my teacher or she would give me a surprise smack. I was a playful, but not a bad, boy. I tried to perform all my assigned daily chores before I went to school. They included sweeping the two bedrooms and a sizable hall and verandah which was all that my father’s house contained. He had built this house in 1927 after moving out of his own father’s house at “Adanse”. My other tasks were to fetch water and fill the coolers, made of earthenware, and make my father’s bed. When I came home from school at 4:30 p.m., that is if I did not loiter around at school, (the school normally closed for the evening at 4 p.m.), I had to fetch more water, usually from a central pipe stand serving the people of a section of Winneba. As there were not many pipe stands in my time, there were usually long queues.\n\nAnd so, my boyhood days went by. But I must point out that my home did not have as much influence on my character as my school and church. Most boys of my age and coming from so-called “educated” homes, looked up the school as the very repository of everything that was worthwhile in the society. School teachers were regarded as paragons of excellence. Parents, themselves, mostly relied on teachers to mould the characters of their children or wards. And with the Methodist or any other mission school the role of the church was all-pervading.\n\nIn the very important book, “The Roots of Ghana Methodism” written by my old master at Mfantsipim, Mr. Francis Lawrence Bartels (former Headmaster of Mfantsipim and subsequently Ghana’s Ambassador to the Federal Republic of Germany), a lucid and detailed account has been given of the role of the Methodist Church in Ghana. Writing about the work of the Methodist District Synod of 1904 under the Chairmanship of the Rev. A. T. R. Bartrop, who had arrived from England on 4th October, 1903. Mr. Bartels quotes the following passage at page 153: “the first duty of the Church is to make the great heathen populations “disciples” of Jesus Christ, and to teach them those things which make for true manhood and womanhood, and create noble character and pure life. The well-being of the land, which its sons and daughters love so dearly, depends primarily not upon the success of the gold mines, the volume of its commerce, the condition of its industries and agriculture, or even upon a wise and just government. All these are important factors; but the very basis of prosperity is in the character of the people. If that be truly Christ-like, all else that is good and desirable will follow. This the Synod recognizes, and to this end it directs attention to those elements in preaching, teaching and discipline, which present and maintain the nature, ethics and duties of the Kingdom of God as well as its privileges; and which secure simplicity of worship, purity in Church life, and the loyal observance of our rules.\n\nEducation has always held a front place in the Methodist Church. It is part of the Great Commission, and is another method of preaching. We may save the nation by saving the children. The Synod, therefore, urges that every effort be made to secure good educational results. There is need for drastic reform in many ways; but in the endeavor to perfect secular instruction, the Synod emphasizes the fact that religious instruction must have even greater attention than heretofore. An educated brain and an unchanged, untrained heart make a worse and not a better child.”\n\nThis re-examination of the evangelical and educational policies of the Methodist Church made by the Synod in 1904 must have had profound influence on subsequent goals of the Church. There was no doubt that boys and girls of my early days felt the full rigors of the discipline of the Church. Methodist elementary schools in the country were regarded as first-rate and, I feel proud that it was the Methodist School at Winneba that nurtured me and laid the foundations of my Christian upbringing and education. I was also lucky that from Winneba, I went on to Mfantsipim School at Cape Coast, a Methodist foundation which has turned out most of the men of whom Ghana can proudly boast."
