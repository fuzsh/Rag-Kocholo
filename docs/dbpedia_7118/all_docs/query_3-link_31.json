        "text": "International Ghanaian musician, Stonebwoy, has been announced as performers to play this year’s edition of Global Citizen Festival.\n\nWith simultaneous shows taking place at the Black Star Square in Accra, Ghana and New York City’s Central Park on Sept. 24, the event will highlight a full decade of impact working with global citizens as well as celebrating a decade of impact working with the world’s top musicians from the iconic Global Citizen stage.\n\nAs always, the Global Citizen Festival will aim to encourage global leaders and corporations to commit billions to issues such as the climate crisis, food shortages, and ensuring a better future for women and girls. Tickets to both events are free and can be obtained on the Global Citizen website or app.\n\nThe event aligns with Stonebwoy’s objectives as a musician who has consistently used his voice to advocate for human rights and environmental sustainability. On June 10, he participated in the 2022 GREEN GHANA campaign held at the Efua Sutherland Children’s Park. He joined the President of the Republic of Ghana, HE Nana Akufo-Addo, and Minister for Lands & Natural Resources, HON Samuel A. Jinapor, to lead a massive drive to plant 20 million trees in Ghana as part of this year’s “GREEN GHANA” campaign.\n\nPrior to that, Stonebwoy was honored with ‘Vodafone Green Award’ at the 2022 Vodafone Vodafone Ghana (VGMAs) for championing environmental awareness and sustainability through his music. He received a recognition plaque and a sum of GHS 10,000 with his song ‘Greedy Men’ which discusses socio-economic challenges that affect communities including weak leadership, illegal mining, corruption and child labour.\n\nOn top of all the performances, Global Citizen CEO Hugh Evans says “there’s gonna be some big surprises” to mark the festival’s 10th anniversary at the New York City show. He’s also excited about taking the festival to West Africa for the first time, especially considering 2022 marks the 65th anniversary of Ghanaian independence, and the 20th anniversary of the founding of the African Union.\n\n“Ghana is honoured to host this year’s edition of the Global Citizens Festival. I look forward to welcoming each and everyone of you to Accra, capital of the country at the centre of the world,” Ghana’s president, H.E. Nana Akufo-Addo, says. “Together, let us join hands and help accelerate progress towards the realization of the [sustainable development goals]. We owe to the next generation to live in a world free from poverty, disease and the degradation of the environment. The time to help make a change is now. We must align forces to make an impact in Africa, and help end extreme poverty. I have called colleague African leaders to join me in September, and help break these systemic barriers that have been affecting our people. Let us build a strong foundation for future generations.”\n\n“Doing it live between the two cities on the same night, throwing literally from Black Star Square — which is the site that commemorates Ghanaian independence, as well as that that power of Pan Africanism — [to New York City] is really powerful,” he says. “It shows the symbolism of that journey of the transatlantic slave trade, and what New York City stands for with the Statue of Liberty, freedom, and independence.”\n\nStonebwoy took his Therapy Summer 2022 Festival Tour to Germany on Saturday (August 6), where he delivered an incredible set at the African Music Festival.\n\nOn the epic night, the multiple award-winning Universal Music Group/Def Jam signed artist invited the festival audience into his performance while exploring his evergreen catalogue, creating a high-energy atmosphere in Emmendingen. His delivery was deemed compelling as he performed a medley of his hits before surprising festival goers with an engaging rendition of “Therapy” that had everyone singing and dancing. The crowd was elated at his intense delivery.\n\nThe four-time Africa’s best reggae & dancehall artiste award-winner’s set at the African Music Festival comes on the heels of his already stellar performance at the 2022 edition of Uppsala Reggae Festival. The night saw him unite with renowned reggae musicians from Jamaica, Morgan Heritage, and German Gentleman for a historic performance to close out the two-night festival.\n\nMeanwhile, prior to the show, hundreds of African Music Festival-goers queued up to get autographs from the Ghanaian based musician.\n\nStonebwoy’s Therapy The 2022 Summer Festival Tour makes a stop at the No Logo Festival in France from 12th to 14th August. He is expected to bring his impressive collections and take audiences on an artistic journey across the world with his highly rated performances.\n\nGhanaian musician, Stonebwoy, has been named in Spotify’s “BIG SIX” artistes of the year 2022 list.\n\nThe annual list, published on August 4th, celebrates outstanding musicians who breaking barriers and hoisting the flag of Ghana with their musical talent. Its release coincides with this year’s Founders’ Day celebration in Ghana, which honors the “Big Six” who toiled for the country’s independence.\n\n“Every year, we take a day off our busy schedules to reflect on the sacrifices and contributions of Kwame Nkrumah, Ebenezer Ako-Adjei, Edward Akufo-Addo, Joseph Boakye Danquah, Emmanuel Obetsebi-Lamptey and William Ofori-Atta in the fight for independence. As the country marks Founders’ Day this year, Spotify has identified some Ghanaian musicians who are making inroads in Ghana’s music scene. These six Ghanaian musicians are breaking barriers and lifting the flag of Ghana high with their music,” Spotify said in a statement.\n\nStonebwoy’s illustrious global career has made him one of the most popular and distinct voices in Africa and around the world, making him an influential figure of the Ghanaian musical landscape. Since his debut in 2009, he has had a stellar music career, releasing four magnificent-case study albums and garnering impressive physical and digital sales, with many hit songs throughout Africa.\n\nHe boasts a career that transcends language, geography, and demographics and he is rated as one of the best reggae and dancehall artistes from Africa. He is widely credited for pioneering and elevating Afrodancehall music into a global cultural, which has fueled an explosion in popularity for African reggae and dancehall scene.\n\nOn May 03, Universal Music Group (UMG) announced the signing of the Ghanaian artiste to its label divisions Def Jam Recordings, 0207 Def Jam and Def Jam Africa. The announcement came paired with the release of his debut label single “Therapy” across all streaming platforms and its accompanying red-hot video shot in Ghana.\n\nStonebwoy has been confirmed as the headlining act at this year’s edition of the African Music Festival.\n\nThe inclusion of the 2015 BET Award winner and four-time Best African Reggae/Dancehall artiste of the year into the Germany-based festival lineup is part of his ongoing Therapy Summer 2022 festival tour, which follows his appearances at seven international music festivals earlier this year, most notably Planet Afropunk Live in the United States and City Splash Festival in the United Kingdom.\n\nStonebwoy heads to Emmendingen on Saturday, August 6th, days after delivering a candidly illustrious and compelling performance at the just ended Uppsala Music Festival and subsequently closing out the festival with joint performances with Morgan Heritage and The Gentleman. He is expected to bring his impressive catalog and take audiences on an artistic journey across the world with his highly rated performances.\n\nNow in its 20th edition, the music programme will be enriched by a fashion show, a street parade, an interfaith service, dance workshops and readings, as well as a handicraft programme for children. There will also be delicious African cuisine and the Afro World Bazaar with clothing, fabrics, handicrafts, accessories, jewellery, decorations and much more.\n\nThe Ghanaian Reggae, Dancehall, and Afrobeats musician is currently on tour in Europe and America with his ‘Therapy Summer 2022 Tour.’ The tour, which is in support of his latest music “Therapy” release via Universal Music Group / Def Jam label, will take him to eight different cities across Europe. He has previously performed at the Summer Jam Festival and the Afrobeats Festival in Germany.\n\nStonebwoy continued his Therapy 2022 summer tour last weekend, headlining Sweden for this year’s Uppsala Reggae Festival.\n\nOn Friday (July 29), the Ghanaian reggae and dancehall artiste delivered an epic headliner set, eliciting a diverse range of feelings from the invigorated crowd as he performed songs from his discography. Commencing with “Tomorrow” and ramping up the energy with notable reggae songs, 1 GAD ran through songs from different eras of his career before concluding with his most recent releases.\n\nMinutes after his set, he returned to join renowned reggae artiste, The Gentleman, on stage to close out the first night of the two day festival. On Saturday, July 30, he was brought back by Grammy winning reggae band Morgan Heritage for a joint rendition of their song “Africa & Jamaica”.\n\nThis year’s performance marked his second Uppsala Reggae Festival appearance since his one-for-the-books festival debut in 2019. Best known for his perfectly smooth musical ability as well as his unparalleled showmanship, he created the unique ambience that has made the carnival well-known and well-liked around the world.\n\nStonebwoy’s addition to the Uppsala Reggae Festival lineup is part of his all-new Therapy Summer 2022 festival tour, which was announced in June, and is the eighth festival he has confirmed to perform at this year.

This year’s edition is scheduled for its ritual venue ‘Saka Saka Park’, Ashaiman on September 3, 2022, after being postponed twice due to coronavirus concerns.\n\nFollowing the success of the 2019 edition, which drew 100,000 people, this year’s edition will be a week-long celebration.
