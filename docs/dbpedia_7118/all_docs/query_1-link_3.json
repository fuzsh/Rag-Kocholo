        "text": "Dr. Ebenezer Ako-Adjei was a nationalist politician from Ghana. Ako-Adjei is considered to be one of the Big Six. The Big Six are arguably some of the most famous people in Ghana’s fight for independence from British rule. In the history of Ghanaian politics Adjei can be said to be the John the Baptist. For it was through him Osagyefo Dr. Kwame Nkrumah brought back to Ghana to lead country to Independence. It all happened in the middle of 1947, when at one meeting o UGCC, the view was expressed the time had come for the movement have a full-time General-Secretary Adjei who had been a pioneer in the formation of the movement was voted by the meeting to take up the post because he had in mind plans of establishing a chain of newspapers in country as well as looking forward to successful private legal practice declined the offer and instead recommended Kwame Nkrumah, whom he met and worked with at Lincoln University, Philadelphia and in the WAS London, as the best person suited for the post.That this suggestion by Ako Adjei was most crucial for the country’s heist sustained by fact that when Nkrumah came to take over the Secretary Generalship of the UGCC, he jolted the movement into action and through that he became the foremost leader in the struggles which won independence for the country and for many other African countries.\n\nEARLY LIFE AND CAREER\n\nAko Adjei was born in Adjeikrom in Akyem Abuakwa to farming pare in June 16, 1916. His father was Samuel Adjei while his mother was Johunna Okailey; both Gas from La. He had many brothers and sisters but he was the last son of his father. The young Ebenezer Ako Adjei began schooling at the Busoso Railway Station Primary School where he walked one and half miles to and from school daily.He left the village school after two years, and was admitted into class three of the La Presbyterian Junior School. His good performance at the senior school won him a scholarship on completing standard five in December 1932 to enter the Christ Church Grammar School, a private Secondary School which was then on the point of winding up. After just a month at that school, he left and entered Accra Academy in April 1933 and was put in form two. From his home in La, he walked the four miles to his school at James Town, because he could not afford the bus fare. He completed the Secondary School in December 1936 passing the Cambridge School Certificate with exemption from London Matriculation.After school, he taught for a while before entering the Civil Service in June 1937 as a Second Division Clerk in the Colonial Secretary’s Office which used to be popularly called the Secretariat. All this while he continued writing regularly for Nnamdi Azikiwe’s African Morning Post. Azikiwe developed great interest in Ako Adjei’s writings and helped him to get a scholarship to Lincoln University, Pennsylvania, USA.\n\nIn January 1939, he arrived at the University to the welcome of two Gold Coast students, K.A.B. Jones-Quartey and Francis Nwia Kofi Nkrumah (who later became popularly known as Kwame Nkrumah) there. As he recalled: When I stepped out of my train at Philadelphia, I met two Ghanaians; Jones-Quartey 1 had known in Accra while working on the Africa Morning Post, he introduced his colleague who was with him. He was Francis Nwia Kofi Nkrumah from Eastern Nzema who had just finished his degree course, obtaining his B.A. degree and was then a student in the seminary doing a course in Divinity. After the introduction they conducted me to the University where I shared room with Jones-Quartey, on the third floor of Huston H which was for postgraduate students doing Divinity. Nkrumah’s room was adjacent to his and the other student. Being a senior student, his room was nearly two times as ours. Nkrumah’s room therefore became a meeting point for Gold Coast other African students at the University.\n\nAccording to Ako Adjei, while at the Lincoln University, though Nkrumah was far older in age than him they became very close. Ako Adjei stayed at Lincoln University with Kwame Nkrumah for one and half years. Where obtained a Phelps Stokes Fund Scholarship, he left to Hampton Institute Virginia (now Hampton University) where he graduated B.Sc. in June IS He won another scholarship to the Graduate School of Journalism, Colon University, New York, where he obtained the M.Sc. in June 1943. Just at time of graduating, Dr. Edwin Smith, a missionary who wrote the biography of Dr. J.E.K, Aggrey, came from England to establish an African Studies Department at Fisk University. Dr. Smith invited Ako Adjei to be Assistant. After working at Fisk for a year, a period within which he saved enough money to realize his childhood ambition of becoming a lawyer, he went to Britain and was enrolled at the Inner Temple in early May 1944. While working hard at his studies, Ako Adjei took active interest in politic well and he later became President of the WASU. It was on one of his rout that he ran into Nkrumah who had arrived in London a few weeks earlier was facing a serious accommodation problem. He hosted Nkrumah at No.25 Lauvier Road, until he found accommodation for him at No. 60 Bui Road, near Tufnell Park Tube Station. Nkrumah stayed there until he moved to London in 1947.\n\nAccording to Ako Adjei, it was he who also introduced Nkrumah to WASU and to Kojo Botsio who later became Nkrumah’s right hand man. When Nkrumah arrived in London I was then President of the WASU. 11 Nkrumah to WASU Secretariat where I introduced him to Kankam Boadu Joe Appiah, who were other members of the executive committee of WA and to Kojo Botsio who we had then engaged as warden of the Student Hostel, at No. I South Villas, Camden Town, London N. WJ. I must say Nkrumah’s arrival and active participation in the work of WASU in vigor; the Union. It was against this background that we organised the Fifth I African Congress which was held in Manchester in 1945 with Geo Padmore and Nkrumah as Joint Secretaries and myself as one of the activeorganizers. A couple of days after staying in Accra, he visited J.B. Danquah who was then with others discussing the possibility of forming a national political movement. Ako Adjei joined in the discussions, He then became part of the planning committee of the UGCC. When the UGCC was inaugurated at Saltpond on August 4, 1947, he became one of the leading members. And when the Accra branch of the Congress was inaugurated on August 22, 1947 he was elected Secretary, with Akufo-Addo as President.As the UGCC increased in membership, the desire became high among the leading members to run the organization like a modem political party, hence a decision was taken to have a full-time general-secretary. None of the professional men in the Convention was ready to give up his career to undertake that duty. When J.B. Danquah suggested Ako Adjei, he, for reasons of running his African National Times and practicing alongside, rejected the offer. He, however, suggested Kwame Nkrumah who was then running the West African National Secretariat at 94 Grace Inn. I recommended Kwame Nkrumah because I had grown to know organizational capabilities and that he will be interested in the job. This is because before I left London for Accra he told me “Ako you’re going ahead of me. When you get to the Gold Coast and there is a job which you think I can do let me know right away so that I would come and work for some time; save some money and then return to London to complete my studies in law at Gray’s Inn.” This of course promised to do. Thus when I heard of the full General- Secretary Job I did not hesitate to recommend him. And fortunately the Convention accepted my suggestion and I wrote to Nkrumah about it and later sent him 100 pounds which was provided by George Alfred Grant, the founder/president and financier of the UGCC for his passage to Accra.\n\nHe arrived in December 194? And I introduced him to A. G. Grant, J.B, Danquah, R.S. Blay and other members of the UGCC.Ako Adjei’s belief in the organizational capabilities of Nkrumah was soon vindicated when Nkrumah soon after his assumption of office as General Secretary of the UGCC initiated moves that expanded membership of Convention. The rapid expansion of the UGCC coincided with the boycott campaign led by Nii Kwabena Bonne III, Osu Alata Mantse, which ended in the 28th February crossroad shooting incident. When the Big Six were arrested, Ako Adjei was detained at Navrongo Prisons.The release of the Big Six saw the widening of the gap between Nkrumah rests of other members of the UGCC. Nkrumah finally broke away from UGCC and formed his CPP. Though he was very close to Nkrumah, Ako Adjei did not follow Nkrumah into the CPP. For a period he equally became critical of Nkrumah in his newspaper the African National Times and the Daily Echo. One regular contributor to the Daily Echo, Tawiah Adamafio was a particular militant opponent of the CPP. At the 1951 elections, he stood on the tickel, the UGCC for the Accra Central Municipal Electoral District seat and obtained only 1,451 votes to come fourth after Nkrumah (CPP-20,780)J Hutton Mills (CPP-19,812), Obetsebi Lamptey (UGCC-1,630). After his p I showing in the polls, he joined others in urging a merger of the opposition groups, when in May 1952 the Ghana Congress Party was formed, he became its Secretary. Sometime, however, as a result of criticism against him, he brought in Nkrumah to disorganize the UGCC, he refused to attend meetings. In March 1953, succumbing to pressure from his friends, especially E. Quaye, Sonny Provencal and Paul Tagoe, he agreed to join the CPP.\n\nEBENEZER AKO-ADJEI- An Appreciation\n\nThe passing of Dr. Ebenezer Ako Adjei on January 14, 2002, at the most respectable age of 85 years; closes a chapter in the political history of Ghana. Dr. Ako Adjei’s departure certainly closes the curtain on what can be adequately described as the Founding Fathers of modern Ghana; the group known as the Big Six who played a pivotal role in a defining moment of our struggle for independence from Britain.\n\nThe death of Dr. Ako Adjei also has generated discussion and debate regarding the manner in which our most respected historical figures have been ignored. Because of coup d’états and political vicissitudes, most of the central figures in our nation’s political history have been sidelined. CPP propaganda during Ghana’s formative years promoted Kwame Nkrumah at the expense of the other five, who were vilified as saboteurs.\n\nDr. Ako Adjei is a case in point. It is reported that on the eve of his release from the Nsawam Prison in 1966, where he had been sent by President Dr. Kwame Nkrumah four years earlier, Ako Adjei completely forswore politics, and any participation thereof. This meant that, for the last 35 years of his life, Dr. Ako Adjei was unseen, and unheard, in the national discourse.\n\nNonetheless, Dr. Ako Adjei’s life prior to his imprisonment was anything but hermit-like. Like most of the ambitious Gold Coast young men of his era, he sought university studies abroad; a journey that took him to Lincoln University in the state of Pennsylvania in the United States of America. Lincoln University is part of a cluster of universities in the United States that are referred to as “Historically Black Colleges and Universities” (HBCU). In the era of segregation and Jim Crow laws which forbade blacks to attend ‘white’ universities, HBCU became a natural home for African-Americans and Africans. These institutions became the breeding ground of black leaders who would play central roles in their various countries.\n\nIt was also a nurturing political atmosphere that the university provided. Dr. Nnamdi Azikiwe, the first president of Nigeria; Justice Thurgood Marshall, the first African-American to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, the first president of Ghana; and a host of leading African politicians of the era, graduated from Lincoln University.\n\nIt was at Lincoln University that Dr. Ako Adjei met the then Kwame Nkrumah, and they struck up a friendship! They co-founded the African Student Association of America and Canada; and a newspaper called the African Interpreter, to explain African issues to American readers.\n\nIn the United States, Ako Adjei also became a follower of the fledgling Pan-African Movement which campaigned for an end to colonialism in Africa, among others. In 1945, Dr. Ako Adjei attended the seminal conference of the Pan-African Movement in Manchester, England. It was at this meeting that a forthright call was made for African independence. Among the delegates were Kwame Nkrumah and Joe Appiah from Ghana; and Jomo Kenyatta, the first president of Kenya; Dr.Nnamdi Azikiwe, of Nigeria; well as Dr. W.E.B Dubois, and George Padmore.\n\nThus, by the time he returned to Ghana, Ako Adjei was not only a qualified lawyer, but a veteran of the post-war political agitation among Africans in Britain to end colonialism in Africa.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nEbenezer Ako Adjei, who died in Accra on 14 January can best be described as a “walking history of Ghana”. The 86 years that he was blessed to spend on this earth encompassed the most important historical periods in the life of Ghana.\n\nThere may have been others whose lifespans also covered equally crucial epochs in our annals. But the difference between them and Ako Adjei is that he was an actor on the stage on which our national drama unfolded and reached its moments of greatest climax, and never a mere spectator.\n\nAko Adjei first entered the cauldron of politics in the “Gold Coast” (as Ghana was known before its independence) in 1947, after his return from Britain where he had studied law and economics, as a post-graduate student from the USA.\n\nHe had been very active in African politics in Britain and America, and thus was well known to the intellectuals and businessmen in the Gold Coast, when he returned home from England.\n\nBy 1947, many of the top educated Gold Coasters had begun a serious struggle to wrestle power from the British.\n\nThe most influential members of this nationalist group were, from the intellectuals’ side: Dr J. B. Danquah, one of the first West Africans to obtain a PhD from a British University, and a very prominent lawyer who had been dragging the colonial administration to the Privy Council in London over a sensational murder case; and George Alfred “Pa” Grant, grandson of one of the earliest indigenous “merchant princes” in the Gold Coast and was now a rich timber merchant based in Sekondi.\n\nPosted from WordPress for Android"
