        "text": "Spouse of a reigning British monarchTemplate:SHORTDESC:Spouse of a reigning British monarch\n\nA royal consort is the spouse of a reigning monarch. Consorts of British monarchs have no constitutional status or power but many have had significant influence, and support the sovereign in his or her duties.[1] There have been 11 royal consorts since Britain's union of the crowns in 1707, eight women and three men.\n\nPrince Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, is the longest-serving and oldest-ever consort, and served for nearly 70 years until his death in 2021. Since the accession of Charles III on 8 September 2022, his wife Camilla has held the position of queen consort.[2]\n\nHistory[]\n\nSince the union of England and Scotland in 1707, there have been eleven consorts of the British monarch.[3] Queens between 1727 and 1814 were also Electress of Hanover, as their husbands all held the title of Elector of Hanover.[4] Between 1814 and 1837, queens held the title as Queen of Hanover, as their husbands were kings of Hanover.[5] The personal union with the United Kingdom ended in 1837 on the accession of Queen Victoria because the succession laws (Salic Law) in Hanover prevented a female inheriting the title if there was any surviving male heir (in the United Kingdom, a male took precedence over only his own sisters, until the Succession to the Crown Act 2013 which removed male primogeniture).[6] In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, Hanover was annexed by Prussia and became the Province of Hanover.[7]\n\nNot all wives of monarchs have become consorts, as they may have died, been divorced before their husbands' acceding to the throne, or married after abdication. Such cases include Princess Sophia Dorothea of Celle, wife of George, Hereditary Prince of Brunswick-Lüneburg (later King George I); Wallis Warfield, wife of Prince Edward, Duke of Windsor (the former King Edward VIII); and Lady Diana Spencer, wife of Charles, Prince of Wales (later King Charles III).\n\nOnly George I and Edward VIII were unmarried throughout their reigns.[8]\n\nSince 1937, the sovereign's consort and the first four individuals in the line of succession who are over 21 may be appointed counsellors of state. Counsellors of state perform some of the sovereign's duties in the United Kingdom while the sovereign is out of the country or temporarily incapacitated.[9]\n\nStyle[]\n\nFemale consorts[]\n\nThe wife of the reigning king as his consort is styled as \"Her Majesty The Queen\" during her husband's reign and \"Her Majesty Queen [first name]\" upon her husband's death. The Queen is referred to as \"Her Majesty\" and addressed as \"Your Majesty\". Since her coronation in 2023, the current royal consort, Queen Camilla, has also been styled as \"Her Majesty The Queen\" per tradition. Camilla was styled as \"Her Majesty The Queen Consort\" preceding the coronation to distinguish her from her then recently deceased mother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, who as a queen regnant was also styled as \"Her Majesty The Queen\".[10][11]\n\nMale consorts[]\n\nThe husband of a reigning queen does not share the regal title and style of his wife, and the three men who served as consort held various titles. The title of “Prince Consort” has only been held by Queen Victoria's husband Prince Albert\n\nPrince George of Denmark, husband of Queen Anne, never received an official style as the consort, his princely title being Danish, but was raised to the peerage of England as the Duke of Cumberland in 1689, several years before his wife's accession in 1702.\n\nPrince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, husband of Queen Victoria, did not take a British peerage title but was granted the title of Prince Consort as a distinct title in 1857, the only male consort of the United Kingdom or its predecessor realms to have held the title. Victoria wished to style him as King Consort, but the government would not allow it.\n\nPrince Philip of Greece and Denmark, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, was raised to the peerage as Duke of Edinburgh in 1947, five years before his wife's accession, and was made a prince of the United Kingdom in 1957.\n\nCoronation[]\n\nQueens consort participate in the coronation ceremony, undertaking many of the same ceremonies as the monarch. Queens traditionally wear elaborate robes and walk in the procession under a canopy. They have also been anointed with holy oil and been crowned. Traditionally, male consorts are not crowned or anointed during the coronation ceremony.[12]\n\nAn unusual case was Caroline of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, who had separated from her husband, George IV, before his accession, became queen consort by law but had no position at court and was forcibly barred from attending his coronation and being crowned.[13]\n\nRegalia[]\n\nThe earliest surviving consort's crown is that created in 1685 for Mary of Modena. In the early-20th century, new crowns were created for each queen consort in turn. However, Queen Camilla did not have a new crown created for her coronation in 2023 and she was crowned using the 1911 Crown of Queen Mary.[14]\n\nThe Queen Consort's Ring was first created for the coronation of Queen Adelaide in 1831, and has been used by queens consort ever since.[14]\n\nThe Queen Consort's Rod with Dove represents 'equity and mercy' and the dove, with its folded wings, is symbolic of the Holy Ghost. The Queen Consort's Sceptre with Cross, originally made for the coronation of Mary of Modena in 1685, is inlaid with rock crystals.[14]\n\nList of consorts[]\n\nPicture Name Arms Birth Marriage Became consort Coronation Ceased to be consort Death Grave site Tenure Spouse George of Denmark and Norway 2 April 1653 Son of\n\nFrederick III of Denmark and Norway\n\nand\n\nSophie Amalie of Brunswick-Calenberg 28 July 1683 1 May 1707\n\nCreation of the Kingdom of Great Britain; became consort to the monarch of England and Scotland upon spouse's accession 8 March 1702 Not crowned 28 October 1708\n\n55 years, 209 days Westminster Abbey 1 year, 180 days Anne Wilhelmina Charlotte Caroline of Brandenburg-Ansbach 1 March 1683 Daughter of\n\nJohn Frederick, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach\n\nand\n\nEleonore Erdmuthe of Saxe-Eisenach 22 August 1705 11 June 1727\n\nSpouse's accession 11 October 1727 20 November 1737\n\n54 years, 172 days 10 years, 162 days George II Sophia Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz 19 May 1744 Daughter of\n\nDuke Charles Louis Frederick of Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Prince of Mirow\n\nand\n\nElisabeth Albertine of Saxe-Hildburghausen 8 September 1761\n\nMarriage to the monarch 22 September 1761 17 November 1818\n\n74 years, 126 days St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle 57 years, 70 days George III Caroline Amelia Elizabeth of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel 17 May 1768 Daughter of\n\nCharles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel\n\nand\n\nAugusta of Great Britain 8 April 1795 29 January 1820\n\nSpouse's accession Not crowned 7 August 1821\n\n53 years, 72 days Brunswick Cathedral 1 year, 190 days George IV Adelaide Amelia Louise Theresa Caroline of Saxe-Meiningen 13 August 1792 Daughter of\n\nGeorg I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen\n\nand\n\nLouise Eleanore of Hohenlohe-Langenburg 13 July 1818 26 June 1830\n\nSpouse's accession 8 September 1831 20 June 1837\n\nSpouse's death 2 December 1849\n\n56 years, 311 days St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle 6 years, 359 days William IV Franz August Karl Albert Emanuel of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha 26 August 1819 Son of\n\nErnest I, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\n\nand\n\nLouise of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg 10 February 1840\n\nMarriage to the monarch Not crowned 14 December 1861\n\n42 years, 110 days St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, then Frogmore Royal Mausoleum 21 years, 307 days Victoria Alexandra Caroline Marie Charlotte Louise Julia of Denmark 1 December 1844 Daughter of\n\nChristian IX of Denmark\n\nand\n\nLouise of Hesse-Kassel 10 March 1863 22 January 1901\n\nSpouse's accession 9 August 1902 6 May 1910\n\nSpouse's death 20 November 1925\n\n80 years, 354 days St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle 9 years, 104 days Edward VII Victoria Mary Louise Olga Pauline Claudine Agnes of Teck 26 May 1867 Daughter of\n\nFrancis, Duke of Teck\n\nand\n\nPrincess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge 6 July 1893 6 May 1910\n\nSpouse's accession 22 June 1911 20 January 1936\n\nSpouse's death 24 March 1953\n\n85 years, 302 days 25 years, 259 days George V Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon 4 August 1900 Daughter of\n\nClaude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne\n\nand\n\nCecilia Cavendish-Bentinck 26 April 1923 11 December 1936\n\nSpouse's accession 12 May 1937 6 February 1952\n\nSpouse's death 30 March 2002\n\n101 years, 238 days 15 years, 57 days George VI Philip of Greece and Denmark 10 June 1921 Son of\n\nPrince Andrew of Greece and Denmark\n\nand\n\nPrincess Alice of Battenberg 20 November 1947 6 February 1952\n\nSpouse's accession Not crowned 9 April 2021\n\n99 years, 303 days 69 years, 62 days Elizabeth II Camilla Rosemary Shand 17 July 1947 Daughter of\n\nBruce Shand\n\nand\n\nThe Honourable Rosalind Cubitt 9 April 2005 8 September 2022\n\nSpouse's accession 6 May 2023 Incumbent\n\nAge: 77 years, 36 days Living 1 year, 350 days Charles III\n\nTimeline[]\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
