        "text": "Frederik III (March 18, 1609 – February 9, 1670) was King of Denmark and Norway from 1648 until his death in 1670.\n\nKing Frederik III was the second-eldest son of King Christian IV of Denmark and Princess Anne Catherine of Brandenburg the daughter of Margrave Joachim Friedrich of Brandenburg and his first wife Catherine of Brandenburg-Küstrin.\n\nKing Christian IV met her on his journey in Germany in 1595 and decided to marry her. In 1596, Princess Anne Catherine and her parents were present at his coronation, and the next year, the marriage was arranged.\n\nAs Prince Frederik, he married Princess Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg. Her parents were Duke Georg of Brunswick-Calenberg, and Princess Anne Eleonore of Hesse-Darmstadt. Nothing is known of her childhood.\n\nPrincess Sophie Amalie married Prince Frederik in Castle Glücksburg on October 1, 1643. The marriage had been arranged in 1640, as it was considered suitable for the current situation of the groom: he was, at that point, Prince-Bishop of Bremen and not heir to the throne, and was not expected to succeed to the throne.\n\nIt is believed to be a political match, though the exact purpose of it is unknown. They had eight children, including King Christian V of Denmark and Princess Ulrike Eleonora of Denmark who married King Carl XI of Sweden.\n\nProclaimed king\n\nThe death of his elder brother Prince Christian in June 1647 opened the possibility for Prince Frederik to be elected heir apparent to the Danish throne. However, this issue was still unsettled when King Christian IV died on February 28, 1648.\n\nAt this juncture the Danish Monarchy was still elective and there was no guarantee Prince Frederik would be elected king. After long deliberation among the Danish Estates and in Rigsraadet (royal council), he was finally accepted as his father’s successor.\n\nOn July 6, the new King Frederik III of Denmark and Norway (where the crown was hereditary) received the homage of his subjects, and he was crowned on November 23rd.\n\nHowever, due to misgivings about the rule of King Christian IV, as well as Frederik’s previous confrontational administrations in Bremen and Verden and his quarrels with Anders Bille, he was only elected after he had signed a Haandfæstning Charter. The Haandfæstning Charter included provisions curtailing the already diminished royal prerogative in favour of increased influence for the Rigsraadet.\n\nKing Frederik III profited by his spirited defense of the common interests of the country and the dynasty. The traditional loyalty of the Danish middle classes was transformed into enthusiasm for the king personally, and for a brief period King Frederik III found himself the most popular man in his kingdom.\n\nHe made use of his popularity by converting the elective monarchy into an absolute monarchy by the Revolution of 1660. To ensure this conversion he instituted the 1660 state of emergency in Denmark.\n\nAt the September 1660 gathering of the Estates, intended to solve the financial problems faced after the wars, King Frederik III played the different Estates against each other. He succeeded in gaining support for the hereditary monarchy, the annulment of the Haandfæstning Charter, and the institution of absolute monarchical rule by decree.\n\nDuring the last ten years of his reign, the king again took a relative obscure position while the new monarchy was built up and the country tried to recover after the wars.\n\nIn 1665, the Kongeloven (Lex Regia) was introduced: the “Constitution” of Danish absolute monarchy, and the first assertion of divine right underpinned by a written constitution in Europe.\n\nIt decreed that the Monarch “shall from this day forth be revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the Earth by all his subjects, standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person, neither in spiritual nor temporal matters, except God alone.” This law consequently authorized the king to abolish all other centers of power. Most important was the abolition of the Council of the Realm.\n\nOn February 9, 1670 King Frederik III died at Copenhagen Castle and is interred in Roskilde Cathedral. He was succeeded by his eldest son, King Christian V of Denmark.\n\nFrederik III (March 18, 1609 – February 9, 1670) was King of Denmark and Norway from 1648 until his death in 1670.\n\nFrederik was born at Haderslev in Slesvig, the son of King Christian IV of Denmark and Norway and the Hohenzollern Princess Anne Catherine of Brandenburg, daughter of Joachim Friedrich, Margrave of Brandenburg and his first wife Princess Catherine of Brandenburg-Küstrin.\n\nKing Christian IV met his future Queen while on a journey through the Holy Roman Empire in 1595 and decided to marry her. In 1596, Princess Anne Catherine and her parents were present at his coronation, and the next year, the marriage was arranged.\n\nIn Frederik’s youth and early manhood, there was no prospect of his ascending the Danish throne, as his older brother Christian was elected heir apparent in 1608.\n\nDuring his early childhood, he was raised under the supervision of Beate Huitfeldt. Frederik was educated at Sorø Academy and studied in the Netherlands and France. As a young man, he demonstrated an interest in theology, natural sciences, and Scandinavian history.\n\nOn October 1, 1643 Frederik wed his cousin Princess Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, the daughter of Georg Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, and Anne Eleonore of Hesse-Darmstadt, a daughter of Ludwig V, Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt and Magdalene of Brandenburg, the daughter of Johann Georg, Elector of Brandenburg and his third wife Princess Elisabeth of Anhalt-Zerbst.\n\nPrincess Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, father, Georg was the sixth son of Wilhelm, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and his wife Princess Dorothea of Denmark a daughter to King Christian III of Denmark and Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg.\n\nKing Christian III of Denmark was the great-great grandfather of King Frederik III of Denmark.\n\nPrince Georg’s youngest brother, Ernst August, Elector of Hanover, was the father of King George I of Great Britain.\n\nFrederik had an energetic, passionate, and ambitious character. He was an enthusiastic collector of books and his collection became the foundation for the Copenhagen Royal Library.\n\nIn his youth, Frederik became the instrument of his father’s political schemes in the Holy Roman Empire. He was granted administration of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (1635–45), the Prince-Bishopric of Verden (1623–29 and again 1634–44), and named coadjutor of the Bishopric of Halberstadt.\n\nThus, from an early age, he had considerable experience as an administrator.\n\nIn 1633, Frederik’s elder brother Prince-Elect Christian of Denmark and Norway was engaged to Princess Magdalene Sibylle of Saxony, the daughter of Elector Johann Georg I of Saxony and Princess Magdalene Sibylle of Prussia.\n\nMagdalene Sibylle of Prussia was a daughter of Albrecht Friedrich, Duke of Prussia and Princess Marie Eleonore of Cleves. Magdalene Sibylle of Prussia was a great-granddaughter of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor. She is also in three ways an ancestor of Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, mother of George III of the United Kingdom.\n\nThe marriage between Prince-Elect Christian and Princess Magdalene Sibylle of Saxony had been discussed as early as 1630. The wedding took place on October 5, 1634 in Copenhagen among great festivities.\n\nThe marriage was childless, and they resided at Nykøbing Castle in Falster. Prince-Elect\n\nChristian gained a reputation as lazy and as a drinker. He was heavily indebted; despite his father’s attempts to pay some of Christian’s debts, he still owed more than 215,000 rigsdaler in 1647.\n\nHe left Nykøbing for Bohemia on May 8, 1647. He reached Dresden on May 28 and continued on until June 1. Not long after leaving he was struck by a fit of illness. He was brought to a castle in Gorbitz near Dresden, where he died on the next day. He was buried on November 8, 1647 in the Church of Our Lady in Copenhagen. In 1655, his remains were moved to the tombs at Roskilde Cathedral.\n\nThe death of his elder brother Christian in June 1647 opened the possibility for Frederik to be elected heir apparent to the Danish throne. However, this issue was still unsettled when Christian IV died on February 28, 1648.\n\nAfter long deliberation among the Danish Estates and in Rigsraadet (royal council), he was finally accepted as his father’s successor. On July 6, King Frederik III received the homage of his subjects, and he was crowned on November 23.\n\nHowever, due to misgivings about the rule of Christian IV, as well as Frederik III’s previous confrontational administrations in Bremen and Verden and his quarrels with Anders Bille, he was only elected after he had signed a Haandfæstning charter. The Haandfæstning included provisions curtailing the already diminished royal prerogative in favour of increased influence for the Rigsraadet.\n\nAs king, he fought two wars against Sweden. He was defeated in the Dano-Swedish War of 1657–1658, but attained great popularity when he weathered the 1659 Assault on Copenhagen and won the Dano-Swedish War of 1658–1660.\n\nKing Frederik III profited by his spirited defense of the common interests of the country and the dynasty. The traditional loyalty of the Danish middle classes was transformed into enthusiasm for the king personally, and for a brief period Frederik found himself the most popular man in his kingdom.\n\nDenmark was an elective monarchy, where elective power was held by the Council of the Realm. However, the King would usually choose an heir and have him hailed as such, thus limiting the Council’s freedom of choice.\n\nKing Frederik III made use of his popularity by converting the elective monarchy into an absolute monarchy by the Revolution of 1660. To ensure this conversion he instituted the 1660 state of emergency in Denmark.\n\nAt the September 1660 gathering of the Estates, intended to solve the financial problems faced after the wars, Frederik III played the different Estates against each other. He succeeded in gaining support for the hereditary monarchy, the annulment of the Haandfæstning, and the institution of absolute monarchical rule by decree.\n\nDuring the last ten years of his reign, the king again took a relative obscure position while the new monarchy was built up and the country tried to recover after the wars.\n\nNew men came into government, which was marked by a rivalry between the ministers and councillors like Hannibal Sehested and Kristoffer Gabel. Frederik III concentrated on changing the administrative structure from chancellery to resort colleges and replaced the administrative divisions of fiefs with amt counties.\n\nIn 1665, the Kongeloven (Lex Regia) was introduced: the “constitution” of Danish absolute monarchy, and the first assertion of divine right underpinned by a written constitution in Europe.\n\nIt decreed that the Monarch “shall from this day forth be revered and considered the most perfect and supreme person on the Earth by all his subjects, standing above all human laws and having no judge above his person, neither in spiritual nor temporal matters, except God alone.” This law consequently authorized the king to abolish all other centers of power. Most important was the abolition of the Council of the Realm.\n\nKing Frederik III died at Copenhagen Castle and is interred in Roskilde Cathedral. He was succeeded by his eldest son, who succeeded by hereditary succession, as King Christian V of Denmark of Norway.\n\nAnother son, Prince George of Denmark and Norway, married Queen Anne of Great Britain. They were second cousins once removed, they were both descended from King Frederik II of Denmark. In 1689 King William III of England created Prince George, Duke of Cumberland.\n\nCharlotte Amalie of Hesse-Cassel (April 27, 1650 – March 17, 1714) was queen-consort of Denmark and Norway by marriage to King Christian V.\n\nEarly years\n\nCharlotte Amalie was born in Cassel, Hesse, of the Holy Roman Empire. Her parents were Landgrave Wilhelm VI of Hesse-Cassel and his consort Hedwig Sophia of Brandenburg.\n\nCharlotte Amalie was raised in the Reformed faith. She was well educated in French, Italian, geography, and philosophy. French was to be her preferred written language, while she spoke German with her more intimate friends. Her mother was a religiously strict adherent of the Reformed Church, and politically oriented toward Brandenburg, both views which were to be shared by her daughter.\n\nOn June 15, 1667 in Nykøbing Slot, Charlotte Amalie married Crown Prince Christian of Denmark. The marriage was arranged by Queen Sophie Amalie of Denmark, (Born Princess Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, the daughter of Georg, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and Anne Eleonore of Hesse-Darmstadt). She desired a daughter-in-law that she could control and expected this to be the case for a princess of Hesse elevated to the status of queen, and a member of the reformed church, who would be religiously isolated in Lutheran Denmark.\n\nChristian was sent to meet her in Hesse already in 1665, but the negotiations were drawn out because of religious concerns. In the marriage contract, she was not required to convert and she secured the right to keep her faith after her wedding to Christian, who as ruler of Denmark would become the head of the state Lutheran Church, a term which was contested and met some resistance before it was accepted. She did keep her faith after wedding.\n\nCharlotte Amalie became queen of Denmark upon the accession of Christian to the throne in 1670. Her Reformed faith caused the Lutheran clergy to oppose her anointing as queen. She could not be anointed as a member of the Reformed faith because the ceremony would require a Lutheran communion, which she refused. As queen, she chose the motto L’homme propose, Dieu dispose.\n\nKing Christian V did not wish his wife to play a political role in government similar to his mothers during his father’s reign, and further more disliked her Pro-Brandenburg sympathies, and therefore took care to remove Charlotte Amalie from exerting any influence in state affairs. She was nevertheless regarded as a potential power holder at court.\n\nChristian V, King of Denmark and Norway\n\nThe relationship between Charlotte Amalie and Christian V are described as a mutually respectful friendship, and while not a love affair, they enjoyed each others company and seemingly coexisted harmoniously. In 1672, the king entered in to a permanent love affair to Sophie Amalie Moth, who after the fall of Peder Griffenfeld four years later was made the official mistress in Denmark, a public adultery which caused an embarrassing situation for Charlotte Amalie.\n\nNevertheless, “no mistress could deprive her of her position as queen, and she understood to defend it”; Charlotte Amalie made the most of her position as queen, both in public representational life as well as in her private interaction with the king. It is noted how she was always at the king’s side, making use of her rank as queen and accompanying him on journeys, hunting and in warfare, and how she could play cards with him late in to the evenings, developing a comfortable and respectful relationship.\n\nReportedly, she grieved over her son’s bigamy, but there is no record of her having expressed any criticism of it to him. She is known as the protector of the famous Marie Grubbe after Grubbe’s divorce and remarriage to her lover, which had made her an outcast. Charlotte Amelie gave refuge to the couple on her own domains.\n\nCharlotte Amalie died of scarlet fever on March 27, 1714 in Charlottenborg, “heartily grieved by many”. She was buried in Roskilde Cathedral."
