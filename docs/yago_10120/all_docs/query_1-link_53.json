One is evil—he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego.\" He continued, \"The other is good—he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith. The same fight is going on inside you—and inside every other person, too.\"\n\nThe grandson thought about it for a minute and then asked his grandfather, \"Which wolf will win?\"\n\nThe old Cherokee simply replied, \"The one you feed.\""
