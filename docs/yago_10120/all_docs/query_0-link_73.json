Unfortunately not much is known of the mediaeval Danish regalia. It is known, however, that a crown, sceptre, orb and sword were used during Christopher III’s coronation in 1443. The year 1537 opened the age of Protestant coronations in Denmark. In that year Christian III was crowned in Our Lady’s Church in Copenhagen. Nothing specific is known about the regalia which were used during the ceremony. Christian III commissioned, however, a new sword of state in 1551. It is made of silver gilt and decorated with enamel and diamonds. The total length of the sword is 135 cm. It was executed by Johan Siebe, Christian III’s goldsmith. The sword of state was used during subsequent royal coronations until 1648.\n\nFor his coronation in 1596 Christian IV commissioned a lavishly decorated crown, sceptre and orb. The only item of Christian IV’s regalia which has been preserved down to our own times is the crown. Christian IV’s crown is a corona aperta, i.e. an open crown without arches. It is made of gold and enamel and richly inlaid with numerous pearls and diamonds. It consists of twelve leaf-shaped points in two different sizes built up in the shape of circlet. The total weight of the crown is 2895 g. This masterpiece of Renaissance jewellery was made by the royal goldsmith Dirich Tyring. In the 1640s Christian IV was forced to pawn the Danish regalia in order to raise money to finance his costly and disastrous wars. The crown of Christian IV was recovered in 1648 for the coronation of his son, Frederick III, but the remaining Danish regalia were lost, so in the same year a new orb and a new sceptre were commissioned. The orb is made of gold. It is decorated with enamel and diamonds and topped with a gold cross inlaid with diamonds. The weight of the orb is 895 g. It was made by an unknown goldsmith in Hamburg. The Danish royal sceptre is one of the most splendid pieces of regalia anywhere in Europe. It is made of gold. It consists of a long rod at the end of which is a large crowned enamel lily inlaid with diamonds. The length of the sceptre is 98,2 cm and its weight is 1359 g. It is unclear whether the sceptre is the work of a goldsmith from Copenhagen or from Amsterdam. A crown for the queen was commissioned together with the orb and the sceptre. It was melted down in 1790.\n\nFrederick III was the last king to use Christian IV’s crown at his coronation in 1648. Following the introduction of hereditary and absolute monarchy, Christian V commissioned a new crown for his coronation in 1671. Christian V’s crown is made of gold and decorated with enamel, diamonds, sapphires and rubies. It is a corona clausa or closed crown made in the shape of a circlet with eight palmettes and arches surmounted by an enamel globe with a cross on its top. The crown weighs 2080 g and its height is 21 cm. It was made in 1670 by Poul Kurtz in Copenhagen. The crown was used at all subsequent Danish coronations including Christian VIII’s coronation in 1840, the last Danish coronation. Christian V’s crown has been used at the lying-in-state of the deceased Danish kings up to the present day.\n\nThe newest item among the Danish crowns is the queen’s crown made for Sophia Magdalena's coronation in 1731 by Frederik Farbritius, a renowned Copenhagen goldsmith. Sophia Magdalena refused to wear the previous queen's crown which had been used at the 1721 coronation of Anna Sophia Reventlow, the queen she hated. The queen’s crown is made of gold and it is a corona clausa. It consists of an oval circlet with eight palmettes and the same number of arches which intersect each other in the middle of the crown and are surmounted by an enamel globe with a cross. The crown is decorated with enamel and diamonds. Its total weight is 954 g. Its height is 15,5 cm. The crown was used at all the coronations from 1731 to 1840 and at the lying-in-state of the Danish queens in the 18th century.\n\nThe remaining items belonging to the Danish regalia and safeguarded at Rosenborg Castle in Copenahgen include:\n\nthe coronation robe of Christian V (made in 1671; ermine and silk adorned with 1400 crowns embroidered with gold threads),\n\nthe coronation rapier (made in 1648 probably in Copenhagen; gold, enamel, diamonds),\n\nthe ampulla (made in 1648 either in Copenhagen or in Amsterdam; gold, enamel, diamonds),\n\nthe Chain and the Star of the Order of the Elephant with Insignia (gold, enamel, diamonds),\n\nthe Chain and the Star of the Order of Dannebrog with Insignia (gold, enamel, diamonds) and other smaller items.\n\nIn the 16th and 17th centuries the Danish regalia were safeguarded in the vaults of the old royal palace in Copenhagen but around 1681 they were transferred to Rosenborg Castle in Copenhagen where they have remained ever since. Since 1922 the regalia have been on public display in the museum of Rosenborg Castle. In 1940 the Danish authorities, fearing the theft of the regalia by invading German armies, had the crowns and the remaining items removed from the museum and hidden in a special underground shelter in which they remained until the liberation of the country in 1945. The Germans, however, did not seem to have searched for the Danish regalia, as they had done a year earlier in Prague, where they had mobilised all their powers to find the Czech crown of St Wenceslaus."
