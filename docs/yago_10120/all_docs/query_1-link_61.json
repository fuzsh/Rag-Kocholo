        "text": "Title announcement tomorrow morning?\n\nI do not know how reliable this is, but it is rumoured in media circles tonight that Buckingham Palace has indicated that there will be a title announcement tomorrow morning. Traditionally a British prince is given a peerage on the morning of his wedding, like Prince Edward was created Earl of Wessex in 1999 and Prince Andrew Duke of York in 1986.\n\nIt has earlier been claimed by some journalists that Prince William has indicated that he does not want to receive any other title than the one he already has, in which case his wife will be officially styled as HRH Princess William of Wales - unless Queen Elizabeth II should allow her to be styled Princess Catherine although not a princess in her own right, which is less likely.\n\nIf a new title is forthcoming tomorrow it is most likely a dukedom. Prince Edward is so far the only one who only received an earldom, although it was officially stated at the time that he will become the new Duke of Edinburgh following the deaths of his parents.\n\nAmong those dukedoms which have been most frequently mentioned in speculations are Cambridge and Clarence. The latter has some unfortunate associations which might perhaps speak against it, while Cambridge is said to have been the dukedom intended for Prince Edward - there is a story that he changed his mind and asked for the title Earl of Wessex after having watched the film Shakespeare in Love.\n\nPersonally I would cast a vote for a Scottish dukedom. Some have suggested St Andrews after the university which Prince William and Kate Middleton both attended, but it should be noted that there is no tradition for granting dukedoms based on personal connections. There is also a problem in that one of the subsidary titles of the Duke of Kent is Earl of St Andrews, a title which is used by his eldest son, but on the other hand there are several examples of multiple peerages with the same name (for instance there are both a Duke of Sutherland and a Countess of Sutherland). But there are also several other places in Scotland which could make suitable dukedoms - perhaps even quite simply Duke of Glasgow, which I think is a title which has never before been used.\n\nAfter all but ninety hereditary peers were removed from the House of Lords in 1999 it might be argued that creating new dukedoms does not make much sense. One might also argue that Prince William needs no new title as he will nevertheless one day inherit a drove of titles. Indeed he will become Duke of Cornwall the second his grandmother dies and his father succeeds to the throne and is likely to be created Prince of Wales shortly thereafter, but this might yet be quite some years into the future. In any case a peerage held by Prince William will merge with the crown upon his own accession to the throne.\n\nThere are at least three previous examples of the eldest grandson of the monarch being granted a dukedom. The future George III was created Duke of Edinburgh by his grandfather George II, Prince Albert Victor was created Duke of Clarence and Avondale by his grandmother Queen Victoria, and following Albert Victor’s death his younger brother George (V) was created Duke of York.\n\nAn opinion poll on the British monarchy\n\nOn the occasion of the upcoming royal wedding the April issue of Prospect magazine has several articles dealing with the British monarchy, among them an interesting essay by Simon Jenkins on “What’s the point of the monarchy?”.\n\nThere is also an interesting opinion poll about attitudes to the monarchy, conducted by YouGov. The polls fails to ask the direct question of how many support the monarchy and how many want a republic, but when asked who they would “prefer to succeed the Queen as monarch”, 13 % answer “no monarch”, something which at least gives an (imprecise) indication about the level of current republicanism.\n\nTo the same question 45 % reply that they want the Prince of Wales to succeed his monarch, whereas 37 % think Prince William should be the next monarch and 5 % do not know. This is an interesting development from the same poll six years ago, when 37 % supported Prince Charles as the next monarch and 41 % Prince William, while 3 % did not know and 19 % wanted no monarch to succeed the current Queen.\n\nThat there is no yearning for an immediate change of monarch is clear from the answers to the question about whether Queen Elizabeth II, who turned 85 last week, should “stay on as monarch”. 65 % think she should, 25 % think she should step down and 10 % do not know.\n\n56 % think the monarch should “continue as head of the Church of England”, while 30 % think she should cease and 14 % do not know. 61 % are in favour of the monarch remaining “head of state of Commonwealth countries”, whereas 26 % are opposed and 13 % uncertain. 71 % think the monarch should “be allowed to marry a Catholic”, while 16 % are against the idea and 13 % do not know.\n\nThe upcoming wedding has naturally led to concerns about the current laws of succession, which mean that a first-born daughter of Prince William will be bypassed in the succession by a younger brother. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg recently said that changing this has been discussed and the poll suggests that there is wide support for such a move – indeed 75 % are in favour and only 17 % are opposed.\n\nThe problem is however that such a change must be carried out not only in Britain but also in the fifteen other kingdoms of which Elizabeth II is Queen and in some of this such a move might open a can of worms, which even happened in staunchly monarchist Denmark when the succession was changed two years ago.\n\nIt is interesting to note that there is a rather distinctive difference between the opinions of men and women on this question. While 83 % of the women are in favour of gender-neutral succession, only 65 % of the men support it. 27 % of the men and 7 % of the women are uncertain, while 8 % of the men and 10 % of the women are opposed.\n\nEqually interesting is the fact that the younger the responders get the more they are opposed to such a change. Among those older than sixty 80 % favour the reform with 14 % opposing and 6 % uncertain; among those between 40 and 59 years of age 78 % are in favour, 15 % opposed and 7 % uncertain; among those between 25 and 39 years of age 72 % are in favour, 18 % are opposed and 10 % do not know; but among those between 18 and 24 years only 60 % support such a change, while 27 % are opposed and 13 % are unsure.\n\nNew books: The Duchess of Windsor’s sad end\n\nMany years ago I saw in magazine a photo of an old, crippled woman lying in her bed with tubes up her nose, obviously at a stage where she was beyond living and merely existed. But for the caption it would be impossible to discern that this human wreck was the famous (or infamous) Duchess of Windsor, once known for her elegance and always remembered as the woman for whom King Edward VIII of Britain gave up his throne, thereby plunging the British monarchy into its most serious crisis of modern times.\n\nToday 25 years have passed since the 89-year-old Duchess of Windsor died in her home outside Paris, on 24 April 1986. In time for the anniversary the author Hugo Vickers has written the book Behind Closed Doors: The Tragic, Untold Story of the Duchess of Windsor, published by Hutchinson of London on 7 April, which primarily concerns itself with the Duchess’s last years.\n\nVickers has deservedly succeeded in establishing himself as one of Britain’s leading experts on royal history, and for one who has read many mediocre books on this topic it is a relief to read the works of an author who is both familiar with terminology and manages to get his facts right (I think I spotted only two factual mistakes in this book). Vickers’s biography of Princess Alice of Greece, mother of the Duke of Edinburgh, is by many ranked as one of the best biographies there is about a royal subject, a view which is fully shared by me.\n\nHowever, I do have ambivalent feelings about this new book. It is somewhat oddly composed; the first part deals with the Duchess’s last years (from the death of her husband in 1972 till her own fourteen years later), while the second, much shorter part deals with the 76 preceding years of her life. It is in the author’s own words in many ways a personal quest and Hugo Vickers himself appears prominently in the text, quoting very frequently from his own diaries and relating his own travels and conversations over the years. Not all of it is equally relevant and some of it comes across as little more than gossip, such as when a lady who would have been in no position to know for sure passes on to Vickers her beliefs about the Duke of Windsor’s sexual abilities (or lack thereof).\n\nOther quotes from various sources can on the other hand be revealing, such as the Duchess of Windsor telling the American ambassador following her infamous meeting with Hitler that the latter talked about his interest in architecture, stating: “Our buildings will make more magnificent ruins than the Greeks”. In passing on the remark to President Roosevelt, Ambassador William Bullitt added that this “seemed to me about as revealing psychologically as anything I ever heard”.\n\nAnd then there is the story, told by the Dean of the American Cathedral in Paris, who was present at the interment of the Duchess of Windsor at Frogmore in 1986 and observed Queen Elizabeth II, not known for wearing her heart on the sleeve, shed a tear and point to the grave of the Duke of Windsor with the words: “That was the one that I loved”. This story brings to life the huge impact the abdication had on the life of the current British monarch, not only in that she might not have been monarch at all if it had not happened, but how it to a certain extent broke up her family by removing a beloved uncle of her childhood from the family circle. This brings the abdication drama quite close, even three quarters of a century after it reached its climax.\n\nBoth Edward VIII and Mrs Simpson have been frequently demonised by many writers since 1936. Vickers’s portrayal of them falls into the more sympathetic category although he is not blind to their faults.\n\nIn the second part of the book Vickers presents short chapters on for instance Wallis Simpson’s family connections, her first two husbands and his own take on the abdication. It is his view that “Wallis Simpson was fond of Edward VIII but she was not in love with him. Therefore the Abdication is not one of the great romances of the twentieth century, it is one of the great tragedies”. Mrs Simpson did not want the King do abdicate, but she allowed the situation to get out of hand and “always considered the Abdication a terrible mistake that should have been avoided”. In this Vickers places himself quite close to the Duchess of Windsor’s own version.\n\nVickers also distances himself from the theory which is sometimes advocated that the Mrs Simpson situation was merely a convenient excuse for “the Establishment” to get rid of a troublesome king. According to Vickers, “nobody wanted the King to abdicate, [...] nobody tried to force him to do so and [...] everyone worked hard to prevent the final tragedy”. He concludes that “[t]he Abdication was brought on by the obstinacy of one man and one man alone – King Edward VIII. He was the only person in Britain who wanted Mrs Simpson to be Queen. Not even Mrs Simpson herself entertained the idea”.\n\nAbout the allegations that the Duke of Windsor sympathised with the Nazis or behaved in such a way that he, in the words of Queen Mother Elena of Romania and Prince Pavle of Yugoslavia “should be shot as a traitor”, Vickers states that he was no Nazi, but “he was naive, and having been brought up with people to advise him all his life until December 1936 he was hardly competent or equipped to deal with men like Hitler”. While “German plots developed around them and plans were devised which could use them to German ends, the Windsors themselves were not a party to these. The Duke behaved in a manner both difficult and foolish, but he was not disloyal”. Some will consider this a fair assessment; others will find it an apologist interpretation.\n\nBut the main story of this book is that of Suzanne Blum, the French lawyer who came to exert great control over the Duchess in her twilight years and in Vickers’s words became her “captor, spokeswoman, keeper of the flame and the keys. She would change the Duchess’s will, altering the disposition of it, lodge what I suspect was a forged letter of authorisation with a tame notary, take the Duchess’s name in vain in respect of what she wanted published, and pronounce herself to be the Duchess’s friend and protector. It is one of the most sinister relationships ever formed between lawyer and client”.\n\nAt the time of the Duke of Windsor’s death in 1972 the health of his wife was beginning to fail, but she remained active for some years until illness confined her to her home and reduced her almost to the state of a vegetable for a long time preceding her death in 1986. Vickers shows how Blum gained control over the ailing Duchess, how she gradually restricted the number of visitors, sold some of her client’s possessions, dismissed members of the ducal staff etc.\n\n“Failing to abide by the terms of the Duke of Windsor’s will, exploiting the Duchess, reinterpreting her wishes, selling her furniture and porcelain, keeping her in her room so that she did not notice what had gone, preventing her from seeing her friends, taking away her beloved pugs and denying her flowers in her bedroom – this was Blum’s way of ‘defending’ the Duchess”, Vickers concludes.\n\nIndeed Blum does not come across as very likeable, but Vickers overdoes it to the extent where he seems incapable of finding anything positive to say about Blum and thus paints a portrait which is so one-dimensional that it is hard to believe.\n\nThere is also the issue of the author Michael Bloch, who Blum commissioned to write several books on the Windsors based on their papers. What seems to rankle most deeply with Vickers is that he does not believe Blum told the truth when she stated that the Windsors had themselves wanted these books published. This “strikes me and many others who knew the Windsors closely as nonsense”, states Vickers (who momentarily seems to have forgotten that he never met nor talked to either of them). On this point he makes a good case for his viewpoint and he obviously disagrees with much of what Bloch wrote, but the manner in which he states his disagreement seems unnecessary vengeful. It almost makes one believe there must have been some personal falling-out between the two authors.\n\nThere are also some frightfully snobbish comments about Vickers’s fellow attendees at the 1998 auction of items from the Windsor villa, so condescending that they simply do not reflect very well on the author himself. This is not Hugo Vickers at his best and only serves to weaken the impression of what is a mostly well-written, sometimes too personally biased, account of the horrid end to the life of the Duchess of Windsor, a woman who was herself a far from unflawed character, but who has been vilified beyond what is reasonable and whose tortured final years can hardly fail to instil sympathy even in the many who are not among her admirers.\n\nThe (digested) official guest list for the British royal wedding\n\nDespite earlier statements that no official guest list would be released, Clarence House has

William who are not on this list but who have confirmed their presence to the media are Lady Brabourne, the estranged wife of a second cousin of Prince Charles, and the Hon Mrs (Margaret) Rhodes, a niece of the late Queen Mother.\n\nThis lists suggests that the only reigning royal families not to be represented in London on Friday will be Liechtenstein, Japan, Jordan, Bhutan and Cambodia. The court of Tokyo has earlier stated that no member of the Japanese imperial family would be attending due to the natural and nuclear disasters which recently struck the country. British media have reported that the King of Cambodia has not replied to his invitation, whereas the King and Queen of Jordan have been reported to have been invited.\n\nMy latest article: Oscar II’s dynastic decoration programme\n\nThe cover story of the latest issue of Byminner (no 2 – 2011), the journal of Oslo’s City Museum, which is out since last Friday, is my article on how King Oscar II decorated the Royal Palace in Oslo with artworks commemorating the reign of the Bernadotte dynasty, thus ensuring that his family remains highly evident at the royal residence more than a century after their deposal while at the same time using the arts to legitimise the Bernadottes’ position as the royal house of Norway.\n\nThe starting point of the dynastic decoration programme was Brynjulf Bergslien’s equestrian statue of Carl XIV Johan in the Palace Square, which was unveiled in 1875. The initiative for the statue was however taken in the reign of Carl XV, but it was his brother and successor who made it into a more extensive programme.\n\nThe programme primarily put its mark on three rooms in the State Apartments. At the centre of the Upper Vestibule he installed a bust of his father Oscar I, who had inaugurated the Palace in 1849. The bust is flanked by reliefs showing respectively Carl XIV Johan laying the foundation stone for the Palace in 1825 and Oscar II unveiling the statue of Carl XIV Johan fifty years later.\n\nJacob Munch’s painting of Carl XIV Johan’s coronation was moved from the Royal Mansion and installed in the Family Dining Room, for which Oscar II also commissioned paintings of his own coronation and that of his brother Carl XV from Knud Bergslien and Peter Nicolai Arbo respectively.\n\nIn the Throne Room next-door Oscar II assembled portraits of the kings and queens of the House of Bernadotte. A portrait of Queen Desideria by Fredric Westin was brought from the Royal Mansion and joined Friedrich Dürck’s portraits of King Oscar I and Queen Josephina. Peter Nicolai Arbo was commissioned to paint the late Carl XV and Kerstin Cardon the late Queen Lovisa.\n\nThe Danish artist Cathinca Engelhart was also commissioned to paint a posthumous state portrait of Carl XIV Johan, where Akershus Castle can be seen in the background. Interestingly the Castle has been replaced by Nidaros Cathedral in another version of the portrait commissioned for the Royal Residence Stiftsgården in Trondheim. No buildings held greater national symbolic meaning than these two and their inclusion in the portraits serve to highlight the Bernadottes as a natural part of the ancient line of Norwegian kings.\n\nI am also able to publish for the first time a portrait of Oscar II himself, painted by Wilhelm Peters in 1903, which so to speak summarises the dynastic decoration programme and legitimacy issue as it shows Oscar II, wearing the Norwegian royal regalia, his hand resting on the book of laws, standing on the palace balcony with Karl Johan Street and the Parliament behind him.\n\nAt the time of Oscar II’s deposal the royal family debated what should be done with various possessions in Oslo. In the end the dynastic decoration programme was among those things the ex-King donated to the Norwegian state, thus ensuring that his dynasty continued to be commemorated at the Palace.\n\nThe sculptural decoration in the Upper Vestibule remains in place to this day, while the Bernadotte portraits were, after the arrival of King Haakon VII and Queen Maud in 1905, moved from the former Throne Room (now the Hall of Mirrors) to the drawing-room of the main guest suite, which was renamed the Bernadotte Drawing Room. In the 1990s the coronation paintings were moved from the Family Dining Room to the Hall of Mirrors. And of course the equestrian statue of Carl XIV Johan still dominates the Palace Square.\n\nThe article may be read in its entirety at the City Museum’s website: http://www.oslomuseum.no/bymuseet/system/script/GetFile.asp?ID=1173.\n\nVincent Frederik Minik Alexander and Josephine Sophia Ivalo Mathilda\n\nAt 3.30 p.m. today the christening of the twins born to Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark on 8 January took place in Holmen’s Church in Copenhagen and in keeping with Danish royal traditions it was only then that the names given to the children were made publicly known. The Prince’s name is Vincent Frederik Minik Alexander, while his slightly younger sister is named Josephine Sophia Ivalo Mathilda.\n\nWhile the heirs in direct line are always called either Christian or Frederik the Danes tend to choose less traditional names for younger royals, with Joachim, Felix, Viggo and Flemming as some examples from the current dynasty (which has reigned since 1863). I cannot think of any previous princes named Vincent, but the name might perhaps be seen as a reflection of what Crown Prince Frederik has said about his French roots becoming more and more important to him.\n\nMost Danish princes, unless they are far down the line of succession, mostly have either Frederik or Christian among their names just in case they should succeed to the throne. Minik is a Greenlandic name, while Alexander is a more traditional royal name. The last Danish royal to be named so was Prince Alexander, who in 1905 became Crown Prince of Norway and got the name Olav instead. Prince Nikolai also has Alexander among his names.\n\nPrincess Josephine’s nearest family namesake is her father’s second cousin Josephine af Rosenborg, one of the three daughters of Count Christian of Rosenborg. It was also the name of the Princess’s great-great-great-great-great-grandmother Queen Josephina (Joséphine) of Sweden and Norway and of the latter’s grandmother, Empress Joséphine of the French.\n\nSophia was the name of the Princess’s great-great-great-grandmother, Queen Sophia of Sweden and Norway, and was also among the names of Queen Ingrid (Ingrid Victoria Sofia Louise Margareta). In its more Danish version Sophie it has also been used by several Danish queens: Sophie of Pomerania, the wife of Frederik I; Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, the consort of Frederik II; Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-Lüneburg, wife of Frederik III; Anna Sophie Reventlow, the third wife and second queen of Frederik IV; Sophie Magdalene of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, consort of Christian VI; and Marie Sophie Frederikke of Hesse-Cassel, wife of Frederik VI. To this could be added Princess Sophie Magdalene, daughter of Frederik V and eventually Queen of Sweden as the consort of Gustaf III; Princess Sophie Hedvig, daughter of Christian V; Princess Anna Sophie, daughter of Frederik III and later Electress of Saxony; and Princess Sophie, daughter of Christian IV.\n\nIvalo is again a Greenlandic name, while Mathilda might bring assocations to Crown Princess Mary’s native Australia. It is also a name associated with the unfortunate Queen Caroline Mathilde, née Princess Carolina Mathilda of Britain, who was married to the insane Christian VII, had an affair with the royal physician Johann Friedrich Struensee, was divorced and banished to Hanover and died there at the age of 24.\n\nPrince Vincent’s godparents are his uncle John Stuart Donaldson, Prince Felipe of Spain, his father’s first cousin Prince Gustav of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, his mother’s lady-in-waiting Caroline Hering, Count Michael Ahlefeldt-Laurvig-Bille and Baroness Helle Reedtz-Thott, the latter two friends of his parents. Princess Josephine’s godparents are her aunts Princess Marie and Patricia Bailey, Prince Charles of Bourbon-Two Sicilies, Count Bendt Wedell, Birgitte Handwerk and Josephine Rechner, the latter three friends of the parents.\n\nWhile the Prince wore the christening gown which has been used for most royal christenings since Christian X in 1870, Princess Josephine wore a previously unused dress which Queen Margrethe found among the belongings of the late Queen Ingrid. Textile conservators have concluded that it dates from around 1940 and it has been suggested that someone may have given it to the then Crown Princess Ingrid when her first child was born.\n\nExcept for the Crown Prince and Crown Princess and their four children the baptism was attended by the following royals and relatives: The Queen and Prince Consort, Prince Joachim and Princess Marie, Princes Nikolai, Felix and Henrik, Princess Benedikte of Denmark and Prince Richard of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, Prince Gustav of Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg and Carina Axelsson, ex-Queen Anne-Marie of the Hellenes, Prince Nikolaós and Princess Tatiana of Greece, Prince Charles and Princess Camilla of Bourbon-Two Sicilies and their daughters Maria Carolina and Maria Chiara, John and Susan Donaldson (maternal grandfather and step-grandmother), John Stuart Donaldson (uncle), Patricia Bailey (aunt), Catherine Murray (great-aunt), Guillaume Bardin (cousin of Crown Prince Frederik) and his wife, Count Valdemar of Rosenborg and Countess Marina of Rosenborg.\n\nFollowing the christening there was a reception at Frederik VIII’s Mansion at Amalienborg, where a private dinner was also scheduled to take place tonight.\n\nA Prussian prince on the differences between reigning and non-reigning houses\n\nA reader and I recently had an exchange on the differences between reigning and formerly reigning royal families and it might be interesting to note that Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia addresses some of these issues in a recent interview with Der Spiegel Geschichte.\n\nThe 72-year-old eldest grandson of the last German Crown Prince, a historian living in Berlin, was interviewed by Konstantin von Hammerstein and Michael Sontheimer for Der Spiegel Geschichte no 2 – 2011, which is in its entirety dedicated to the history of the House of Hohenzollern, like one of the issues of 2009 was dedicated to the Habsburgs. It is indeed a very interesting magazine, containing articles on many aspects of the history of the former royal family of Brandenburg and Prussia.\n\nThe Prince, whom the interviewers address with his legal name as “Mr Prinz von Preußen”, says that he feels just like any other citizen of Germany with the same rights and duties. He describes himself as “fully and completely” a republican. It “happens” that people address him as “Your Royal Highness”, he says, and “I let it happen”, but he points out that there is no such thing as noble titles after 1918 and that his surname is “Prinz von Preußen”. He considers it magnanimous “for a so-called revolution” that the former royal and noble families were allowed to incorporate their titles into their names, given that one could have taken the same road as Austria, which abolished all noble denominations altogether.\n\nWhen in school after the war Prince Friedrich Wilhelm was not aware of what a family he actually belonged to, something which “mattered not the slightest at home”. He believes his parents had more than enough of other preoccupations than instilling into their children “that we belonged to the former imperial house”. This really only dawned upon him in senior high school, where his history teacher took it for granted that a Prince of Prussia should be especially knowledgeable about history. At this time he began asking his father questions about the family. The family did not mourn its former position, he says, but was “happy to have survived the war”.\n\nWhen asked about his relations with the currently reigning royal families he points out that the future King Frederik IX of Denmark, the future Queen Juliana of the Netherlands and Princess Sibylla of Sweden were among his godparents and that he remains in touch with Queen Beatrix and Queen Margrethe, the latter being a godmother to his own son Friedrich Wilhelm. The interviewers ask about the House of Windsor and the Prince points out that this name only dates from 1917 and that the Windsors were “a German princely family” before that. “The relations to the Englishmen were naturally from that time always somewhat tense, but I have had several very friendly encounters with Prince Charles”, he says, adding that “I believe that wartime animosities do not matter anymore for Prince William’s generation”.\n\nHe speaks English with the Windsors and German with Queen Margrethe, but also French when he has been a guest of her and Prince Henrik. Do royal families separate strictly between reigning and formerly reigning families, the interviewers enquire. “No, the formerly reigning are treated as if they were still reigning”, he says. A reigning king is obviously better placed at table, but “the titles which one hardly knows here anymore are naturally prevalent at such events”. While the ex-King of Bulgaria will be styled “Majesty” on the cards only first names are used when speaking. The Queen of Britain “is Aunt Elizabeth to me”.\n\nAmong his own forebears he particularly admires Friedrich Wilhelm, “the Great Elector”, and is most critical of his great-grandfather, Emperor Wilhelm II, who “was a misfortune – for Germany and for our family. […] He did not wish for war and was no militarist, even if he changed uniforms ten times a day. But he made no serious attempts to avoid the war”.\n\nThe Prince also addresses topics such as equal or unequal marriages in his family, his relatives’ ties with the Nazis (which, I could add, he has also dealt with in his 1985 book “Gott helfe unserem Vaterland”. Das Haus Hohenzollern 1918-1945) and the current standing of European monarchies.\n\nAmong the other topics accorded articles in this interesting issue of Der Spiegel Geschichte are, apart from several Hohenzollern monarchs and of course Queen Luise, the origins of the dynasty, Friedrich II’s relations with Voltaire, the history paintings of Adolph Menzel, the Social Democratic Party and its leader August Bebel, the Hohenzollerns and their “unloved capital” Berlin, the Romanian branch of the dynasty, World War I, the reburial of Friedrich II, the scandalous Prince Ferfried of Hohenzollern, and the Prussian crown regalia, which have recently been the subject of an exhibition at Charlottenburg Palace in Berlin. All in all a highly recommendable issue of this magazine.\n\nRoyal jewels: Queen Maud’s Maltese cross tiara\n\nThe Maltese cross tiara, now at the disposal of Queen Sonja of Norway, consists of a circular bandeau of diamonds onto which four diamond Maltese crosses have been mounted. According to what the royal family’s walking encyclopaedia Princess Astrid told me the tiara was made for Queen Alexandra of Britain as a lighter and simpler alternative to the so-called State Diadem (now called simply the Diamond Diadem) which had been made for George IV.\n\nIt was thus made to resemble the heavier, more formal piece, but four fleurs-de-lis replaced the national symbols in the originals. In the first photo Queen Alexandra wears the tiara together with Queen Victoria’s small diamond crown.\n\nWhat complicates the matter is the existence of an 1856 Winterhalter portrait of Queen Victoria of Britain wearing a very similar tiara. This was according to Geoffrey C. Munn’s book Tiaras: A History of Splendour (2001) an 1853 remodelling of the so-called Regal Circlet which had been made for her aunt Queen Adelaide, consort of King William IV.\n\nHowever, this cannot possibly be the same tiara as is now in Norway, as Queen Victoria’s was dismantled in 1937 and the stones reused for the crown of Queen Elizabeth. The frame is now in the Museum of London.\n\nUpon Queen Alexandra’s death in 1925 the Maltese cross tiara was one of the two tiaras inherited by her youngest daughter, Queen Maud of Norway. She wore it frequently in her later years, but had the fleurs-de-lis removed so that it should not look too similar to the British State Diadem.\n\nMany have wondered why Crown Princess Märtha never wore any of her mother-in-law’s tiaras. According to what Princess Astrid told me the reason is as follows: Queen Maud used to take most of her jewels with her when she went to England every autumn and also did so in 1938. The Queen died during that stay and her jewellery was put in storage at Windsor Castle.\n\nIt remained there during the Second World War and it was only in connection with the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in June 1953 that Crown Prince Olav and Crown Princess Märtha brought the chests back to Norway. As the Crown Princess was by then already mortally ill and died ten months later (57 years ago yesterday) she never came to wear any of Queen Maud’s jewels.\n\nFollowing Crown Princess Märtha’s death her three children decided not to divide their grandmother’s jewellery until Prince Harald had married, meaning that it was not done until late in the autumn of 1968.\n\nPrincess Ragnhild then inherited Queen Maud’s big diamond tiara which had been a wedding present in 1896, while the diamond and pearl tiara which had also been a wedding present (and was stolen in 1995) went to Crown Prince Harald, who also inherited the Maltese cross tiara and the delicate so-called Fan tiara. Princess Astrid got the turquoise crown which had been made for Queen Alexandra and a small diadem which can be worn either with ruby flowers or diamond wings.\n\nQueen Sonja has had the Maltese cross tiara altered and mostly chosen to wear only the bandeau without the crosses. The bandeau has also been shortened and a pair of earrings made out of some of the elements. One of the crosses is often worn as a brooch and occasionally the Queen has chosen to wear the bandeau with three of the crosses placed next to each other in front, which is in my opinion not a very successful solution.\n\nDuring the state visit of Queen Margrethe and Prince Henrik in 1992 and again during the state visit of King Carl Gustaf and Queen Silvia in 1993 the bandeau (without crosses) and the earrings were lent to Princess Märtha Louise – two of only three occasions when she has worn another tiara than the one given to her by King Olav on her eighteenth birthday.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT: The information in this blogpost, which was given me by Princess Astrid, is confirmed by Hugh Roberts’s new book The Queen’s Diamonds (London, Royal Collections Publications, 2012), which says (page 168): “In the early months of her widowhood, the Queen [Alexandra] had the stone [Cullinan VI] incorporated (detachably) into a new circlet, made as a substitute for the Diamond Diadem [...], which had passed to Queen Mary on King Edward’s death”. In a footnote on the same page we read: “Garrard RL2, fol. 155, Queen Alexandra, 14 November 1910: ‘1 Marquise brilliant (piece of the Cullinan) 1 round brilliant & 84 brilliants furnished as a Royal Circlet composed of bandeau surmounted by 4 crosses patées & 4 fleur de Lys, the crosses & Fleurs de Lys form separate Brooches & 3 large brilliants can be removed at pleasure £326’. The circlet was bequeathed by Queen Alexandra to her third daughter, Maud, Queen of Norway, minus Cullinan VI and the ‘round brilliant’ (QAJ c.1920, fol. 1)”.\n\nThe photo of Queen Alexandra is by W. & D. Downey, the photo of Queen Maud is © Sjøwall."
