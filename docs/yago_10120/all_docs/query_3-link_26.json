The ancient fortress of the Brunonian counts of Brunswick was located on an island formed by the river Oker. This original county was probably a fief of the dukes of Saxony, although no proof of this speculation has been found. Brunswick became a major trading centre, as it marked the crossing point between the old Köln/Magdeburg trade route and the major lines of communication from south-west Germany to the Harz/Elbe .\n\nOn the death in 1090 of Ekbert II Graf von Braunschweig, last count of the first Brunswick dynasty, his sister Gertrud inherited the Brunswick territories. They eventually passed to the Welf dukes by the following inheritance trail:\n\n· Gertrud's daughter by her second marriage, Richenza von Northeim, married Lothar von Süpplingenburg Duke of Saxony, who later became Emperor Lothar III;\n\n· Emperor Lothar's daughter by Richenza, Gertrud, married, as her first husband, the Welf Heinrich X \"der Stolze\" Duke of Bavaria;\n\n· Duke Heinrich's only son by Gertrud, Heinrich \"der Löwe\" Duke of Saxony, inherited the Brunswick territories.\n\nHeinrich \"der Löwe\" Duke of Saxony developed the old Brunonian fortress into a princely residence known as Dankwarderode, constructed other fortifications and created new settlements. He favoured Brunswick as his permanent capital . This consolidation of the Brunswick territories into the personal domain of the duke of Saxony marked the end of the Saxon fiefdom. By the time Brunswick and its connected territories were inherited by Otto \"das Kind\", grandson of Duke Heinrich and last male heir of the Welf dynasty, they appear to have been considered a direct fief of the Empire. As is the case with many German titles, the precise process by which this occurred is not apparent. The title \"Duke of Brunswick\" was confirmed by charter dated 1235 .\n\nThe area around Lüneburg was owned by the Billung family, whose chief residence was the castle on the Kalkberg, and passed to the Welf family after the death in 1106 of Magnus Billung Duke of Saxony . The township of Lüneburg, the centre for production of salt, was probably granted to the Welf family by Emperor Lothar as it had originally been an imperial fief .\n\nThe county rights in the Hannover area, the Marstemgau, passed to the counts of Roden after the death in 1106 of Magnus Billung Duke of Saxony. They founded St Georg's church in Hannover in [1125]. Heinrich \"der Löwe\" Duke of Saxony asserted suzerainty over the counts of Roden and may have granted Hannover its first charter. The town was sacked in 1189 by Heinrich VI King of Germany during the course of fighting with Duke Heinrich .\n\nMünden, in the south of Saxony, was probably established by the Landgraf of Thuringia between 1155 and 1180. It became Welf property some time after the death of the last Landgraf of Thuringia in 1247 . Göttingen presumably belonged to the Welf in the late 12th century as it was allocated to Heinrich Pfalzgraf bei Rhein, eldest surviving son of Heinrich \"der Löwe\" Duke of Saxony, in the 1202 partition and after his death inherited by his nephew Otto \"das Kind\" .\n\nBothos late 15th century Chronicon Brunsvicensium Picturatum provides important information concerning the Brunswick ducal family which have not been found in other primary sources, especially for the 14th and 15th centuries . The Chronicon is not error free: extracts which are disproved by information found in other primary sources have not been included in the present document. The difficulty relates to uncorroborated information which, in some cases, triggers interesting discussions about possible new relationships as will be seen below.\n\nChapter 1. GRAFEN von BRAUNSCHWEIG\n\nOnomastics suggest a close family connection between the family of Bruno, founder of Brunswick, and the Billung family. A hypothesis which explains this relationship is shown below but there is no proof that it is correct.\n\nBRUNO, son of [EKBERT \"der Einäugige Graf im Hastfalagau] & his wife --- ([975/85]-murdered near Niedorp [1010/11] ) . There is no proof that Bruno von Braunschweig was the son of Ekbert \"der Einäugige\" but this appears probable in view of the names which are common to the two families and also the common references to the Derlingau. Bruno is shown in Europäische Stammtafeln as the brother of Wichmann [III] Graf im Duffelgau and Ekbert Graf im Derlingau, while another table shows Wichmann [III] as son of Ekbert . His birth date range is estimated from his estimated marriage date. The estimated birth date ranges of both Wichmann [III] and Bruno are consistent with their having been brothers. Bruno founded Braunschweig. He was a candidate for the German throne in 1002 in opposition to Heinrich IV Duke of Bavaria, who was elected as Heinrich II King of Germany.\n\nm ([1003/05]) as her first husband, GISELA of Swabia, daughter of HERMANN II Duke of Swabia & his wife Gerberga of Upper Burgundy (11 Nov 990-Goslar 16 Feb 1043, bur Speyer Cathedral). The Annalista Saxo names her three husbands, although the order of her first and second marriages is interchanged which appears impossible chronologically . The necrology of Fulda records the death \"1043 16 Kal Mar\" of \"Gisela imp\" . She married secondly ([1014]) Ernst Duke of Swabia [Babenberg] and thirdly Konrad II Herzog von Franken, who succeeded in 1024 as Konrad II King of Germany, and was crowned as Emperor Konrad I in 1027.\n\nBruno & his wife had [two] children:\n\n1.LIUDOLF von Braunschweig ([1003/05]-23 Apr 1038) . The Annalista Saxo names \"Liudolfus comes Saxonicus, filius Brunonis de Bruneswic et Gisle inperatricis\", when recording his death . His parentage is confirmed by the charter dated 1051 under which \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" donated \"comitatum quem Brun eiusque filius noster frater Liutolfus nec non et eius filius Echbreht comites in pagis Northduringen, Darlingen, Valen, Salthga, Grethe, Mulbeze\" to the church of Hildesheim . His birth date range is estimated assuming that he was \"the young Count Liudolf\" whom Thietmar notes was captured during a conflict with the Poles, dated to 1015 , although it is not certain that this was the same person. Vajay suggests a birth date range of [1006/08], which is more consistent with his mother's birth date but appears late for the 1015 capture. The Annalista Saxo records that \"Liudolfus comes Saxonicus, filius Brunonis de Bruneswic et Gisle inperatricis\" was killed \"IX Kal Maii inmatura cum maximo suorum conprovincialium merore\" . He was installed as Markgraf in Frisia by his stepfather Emperor Konrad II after 1 Jul 1028. m GERTRUD [von Egisheim, daughter of HUGO [VIII] Graf im Nordgau und zu Egisheim & his wife Heilwig von Dagsburg] (-21 Jul 1077). The Annales Stadenses refers to the mother of \"Ida [de Elsthorpe]\" as \"sororis Leonis papa qui et Bruno\" . The correctness of this parentage of the wife of Liudolf assumes (which appears likely to be correct as discussed below) that Ida von Elstorf was his daughter. The Libro Memoriarum Sancti Blasii records the death in Jul 1077 of \"Ghertrudis marchionissa senior\" . Liudolf & his wife had [five] children:\n\na) [MATHILDE ([1025/26]-Paris 1044, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis) . Rodolfus Glaber records that King Henri married \"Mathildem de regno eius ex Germanie nobilioribus\" . Her precise origin is not known. A manuscript entitled \"Excerptum Historicum\" records the marriage of \"rex Henricus\" and \"neptem Henrici Alamannorum Imperatoris\", commenting that the couple had a daughter who died young and that King Henri's wife died soon after . She was described as \"ex Cæsarum progenie\" in the Miracles de Saint-Benoît . The Historia of Monk Aimon records that King Henri married \"neptem Henrici Alamaniæ Imperatoris\" in 1034 . Szabolcs de Vajay suggests that she was the daughter of Liudolf Markgraf von Friesland [Braunschweig] & his wife Gertrud von Egisheim, her supposed father being the uterine half-brother of Emperor Heinrich III. The Historia Francica records the death in 1044 of \"Mahildis Regina\" . m (1034) as his first wife, HENRI I King of France, son of ROBERT II \"le Pieux\" King of France & his third wife Constance d'Arles [Provence] ([end 1009/May 1010]-Palais de Vitry-aux-Loges, forêt dOrléans, Loiret 4 Aug 1060, bur église de l'Abbaye royale de Saint-Denis).]\n\nb)BRUNO [II] von Braunschweig (-killed 1057). The Annalista Saxo names \"Brunone et Ecberto comitibus, filiis Liudolfi de Bruneswic qui fuerat patruus regis\" . \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" granted property \"in comitatu Brunonis comitis et in pago Ualen\" to the church of Hildesheim by charter dated 4 Jun 1049 . It is not known whether this refers to the same Graf Bruno. However, \"Valen\" is one of the pagi named in the 1051 charter which names Bruno's brother Ekbert (see below). Graf in Flutwidde [1052/57]. The Annales of Lambert von Hersfeld record in 1057 that Otto frater Wilhehelmi marchionis, sed matrimonio impari, matre...Slavia had been exiled to Bohemia from boyhood but returned to Saxony after the death of his brother to claim his inheritance, fought Brun et Eggeberdus patrueles regis, killed Brun, and still adolescentem was killed by Ekbert .\n\nc)EKBERT [I] von Braunschweig (-11 Jan 1068) . The Annalista Saxo states \"genuit autem Liudolfus ex Gertrude comitissa Brunonem, qui iuxta villam Niethorp occisus est, et Ekbertum seniorem marchionem\" . Graf von Braunschweig.\n\n- see below.\n\nd) [IDA \"von Elstorf\" (-before 4 May 1082). The Annales Stadenses name \"Ida nobilis femina de Suevia nata, in villa Elsthorpe\" as \"filia fratris imp. Heinrici III, filia quoque sororis Leonis papa qui et Bruno\" . It is probable that fratris imp. Heinrici III was Liudolf von Braunschweig, the only known [half-]brother of Emperor Heinrich III whose wife is not otherwise recorded in other primary sources. If that is correct, the reference to Idas Swabian origin (de Suevia nata) is difficult to explain, unless it was intended to indicate the Alsacian origin of her maternal family. Dobertin considers it credible (glaubhaft) that Ida was the step-daughter, rather than daughter, of Liudolf . However, the need to add the phrase filia fratris imp. Heinrici III in the Annales Stadenses is not obvious if this statement was factually incorrect. In any case, the chronology is not ideal for Ida to have been born from either an otherwise unrecorded earlier or later marriage of her mother: in the case of an earlier marriage, Ida would have been old to have given birth to [three] children by her second/third husband, and if a later marriage the chronology appears tight for her to have had two children by her first husband (assuming that his death is correctly dated as shown below). Elstorf is located west of Hamburg near Buxtehude, south-east of Stade. No other reference has been found in primary sources to Elstorf being linked to any medieval noble family. The significance of von Elstorf in this extract from the Annales Stadenses has not been ascertained. In particular it is not known whether it represents property inherited by Ida from either her paternal or maternal family or from one of her husbands. After her death, Idas properties passed to the family of the Grafen von Stade (see the document SAXONY NOBILITY) under unusual circumstances as will be explained. The Annales Stadenses records that Ida [von Elstorf] had \"filium Ecbertum comitem\" who was killed by \"primus Udo marchio...cognatus suus\" at Wistede prope Elstorpe, adding that Ida found herself without heirs (orbata heredibus), visited avunculum suum papam Leonem (therefore before Apr 1054), and following his recommendation adopted ipsum Udonem as her son and appointed him as her heir (listing properties which she granted him during her lifetime), a later passage clarifying that predictum Udonem marchionem primum was Idas successor after she died (Ida ergo mortua...) . This text presents chronological difficulties. A literal interpretation of primus Udo marchio would indicate Lothar Udo [II] Graf von Stade, who succeeded as Markgraf der Nordmark in 1056 and died the following year so could not have been appointed by Ida as her heir. Presumably therefore his son Lothar Udo [III], who succeeded his father as Lothar Udo II Markgraf der Nordmark and died in 1082, was intended. However, that interpretation is inconsistent with Ida von Elstorf taking advice from her uncle Pope Leo IX (who died in Apr 1054). That part of the report must be factually incorrect, the only safe conclusion being that Ekbert predeceased his mother some time before 1082. This passage in the Annales Stadenses specifies that Ida predeceased Markgraf Lothar Udo, therefore died before 4 May 1082.] m firstly LUITPOLD Graf von Stade, son of --- & his wife Glismode --- (-[before 1055]). The Annales Stadenses name \"Lippoldo filio domine Glismodis\" as husband of \"Ida [de Elsthorpe]\", specifying that they were parents of \"Odam sanctimonialem de Rinthelen\" . He is identified in Europäischen Stammtafeln as Liutpold der Ostmark, son of Adalbert \"der Siegreiche\" Markgraf der Ostmark [of Austria] & his first wife --- (-Ingelheim 9 Dec 1043, bur Trier) . Presumably this is based firstly on the Annales Stadenses which name \"Lippoldo filio domine Glismodis\" as husband of \"Ida [de Elsthorpe]\" , and secondly on the Vita Meinwerci which names \"Thiedericum, Meinwercum, Glismod et Azelam\" as children of Immed & Athela, specifying that Glismod married \"nobilis principis in Baioaria\" , although there is no evidence linking the second with the first. The fact that Ida von Elstorf had children by her first husband, if correct, also indicates that that this co-identity cannot be right . m secondly ([1055]) DEDO Graf von Dietmarschen, son of ---. The Annales Stadenses name \"comitem Dedonem et comitem Ethelerum Album\" as the two husbands of Ida after \"Lippoldo filio domiine Glismodis\", specifying that both were killed \"in Thietmarschia\" . m thirdly ([1058]) ETHELER Graf von Dietmarschen, son of ---. The Annales Stadenses name \"comitem Dedonem et comitem Ethelerum Album\" as the two husbands of Ida after \"Lippoldo filio domiine Glismodis\", specifying that both were killed \"in Thietmarschia\" . Ida & her [second/third] husband had [three] children:\n\ni)RICHEZA (-1108 or after) . The Annales Stadenses name \"Rikencem\" as the daughter of Ida by her second or third husband, specifying that she married \"comes Eilmarus de Aldenburg\" . \"Eigilmarus comes in confinio Saxonie et Frisie et eius coniuge Richeza\" promised donations to Aldenburg St Marie in Iburg, with the consent of \"duobus eorum filiis Christino et Egilmaro necnon et filia Gertrude\" by charter dated 1108 . m EGILMAR [I] Graf von Oldenburg, son of --- (-1108 or after).\n\nii)BURCHARD . The Annales Stadenses name \"Burchardus, Treverensis maior prepositus\" as son of Ida, without specifying by which husband, specifying he was later elected archbishop (without specifying the archbishopric) . The Annales Sancti Diibodi record that \"Hermannus de Winzenburg\" killed \"Burchardum de Lochenheim\" in 1130 .\n\niii) [daughter . Baumgarten refers to the marriage of \"[Kilikia] de Dithmarschen, fille du Comte Etheler\" and Sviatoslav II Grand Prince of Kiev, adding that she was a different person from \"Oda von Stade\" who married Sviatoslav´s brother Vladimir and whom he identifies as Ida von Elstorfs daughter by her first marriage (see the document SAXONY) . The primary source which confirms her parentage and marriage has not been identified. m SVIATOSLAV Iaroslavich, son of IAROSLAV I \"Mudriy/the Wise\" Grand Prince of Kiev & his [second] wife Ingigerd Olafsdottir of Sweden (1027-27 Dec 1076, bur Chernigov, Church of the Redeemer).]\n\ne) [daughter . This affiliation of the wife of Konrad Graf von Haldensleben is proposed by Ernst Klebel . The text in which this is proposed has not yet been consulted but it is assumed that the hypothesis is based on onomastics. Konrad's daughter was named Gertrud, and her granddaughter was named Ida, both names associated with the Brunswick family. The affiliation is not chronologically impossible, although it is tight given the known birth dates of some of Konrad's descendants. m KONRAD Graf von Haldensleben, son of BERNHARD Margraf der Nordmark & his wife --- Vladimirovna of Kiev.]\n\n2. [daughter . The name and origin of the wife of Graf Thiemo [II] [Formbach] are unknown. Wegener suggests that she was the daughter of Bruno [I] Graf von Braunschweig to explain the transmission of the names Bruno and Ekbert into the family of the Grafen von Formbach . This appears supported by \"Conradus Romanorum rex secundus\" granting the right to market and minting coins in Dorf Neunkirchen to \"consanguinei nostri Ekkerbti comitis\" by charter dated [Jun/Jul] 1141 , King Konrad III being the great grandson of Heinrich III King of Germany who was the son of Gisela of Swabia by her third husband King Konrad II. m THIEMO [II] Graf, son of THIEMO [I] [Dietmar] Graf im Schweinachgau & his wife --- (-killed in battle 28 Aug 1040).]\n\nEKBERT [I] von Braunschweig, son of LIUDOLF Graf im Derlingau, Markgraf von Friesland & his wife Gertrud von Egisheim (-11 Jan 1068) . The Annalista Saxo states \"genuit autem Liudolfus ex Gertrude comitissa Brunonem, qui iuxta villam Niethorp occisus est, et Ekbertum seniorem marchionem\" . In a later passage it names \"Brunone et Ecberto comitibus, filiis Liudolfi de Bruneswic qui fuerat patruus regis\" . \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" donated \"comitatum quem Brun eiusque filius noster frater Liutolfus nec non et eius filius Echbreht comites in pagis Northduringen, Darlingen, Valen, Salthga, Grethe, Mulbeze\" to the church of Hildesheim by charter dated 1051 . The Annales of Lambert von Hersfeld record in 1057 that Otto frater Wilhehelmi marchionis, sed matrimonio impari, matre...Slavia had been exiled to Bohemia from boyhood but returned to Saxony after the death of his brother to claim his inheritance, fought Brun et Eggeberdus patrueles regis, killed Brun, and still adolescentem was killed by Ekbert . Graf von Braunschweig. \"Heinricus rex\" granted \"comitatum Udonis marchionis\" to the church of Bremen-Hamburg by charter dated 24 Oct 1063, with the consent of \"Ottonis Baiuuariorum ducis, Bertoldi ducis, Ottonis marchionis, Fritherici comitis palatine, Ekkiberti comitis\" . \"Heinricus rex\" granted property \"duas villas Hochfeld et Suueichusen cum foresto Heiligenforst in comitatu Gerhardi comitis in pago Nortcowe\" to the church of Hildesheim by charter dated 10[6]5, supported by \"duce Ottone, Ekkiberto comite, item Gotescalco comite\" . He was installed as EKBERT I Markgraf von Meissen in early 1067, as shown by the charter dated 5 Mar 1067 under which \"Heinricus rex\" donated property \"in pago Istria in marcha Odalrici marchionis\" to the church of Freising supported by \"Ekkiberti marchionis, Odalrici marchionis\" . He is not, however, referred to by the title Markgraf in two subsequent charters: \"Heinricus rex\" granted property \"Asingvu in pago Chunzingowe et in comitatu Ekkiberti comitis\" to \"mulieri cuidam Lantwich\" by charter dated 1067 , and \"Heinricus rex\" granted property \"villam Livbeni in pago Plisni in comitatu Ecberti comitis\" to \"Mecelino servienti nostro\" by charter dated 18 Jul 1068 . The Libro Memoriarum Sancti Blasii records the death in Jan 1068 of \"Eghbertus marchio\" .\n\nm (1058) as her second husband, IRMGARD [Aemilia/Immula] di Susa, widow of OTTO von Schweinfurt Markgraf der Nordgau, daughter of MANFREDO UDALRICO Marchese di Susa and Turin & his wife Berta degli Obertenghi (-1078 before 29 Apr). The Annalista Saxo names \"Emilias vel Immula seu Irmingardis\", wife of Otto von Schweinfurt, as sister of \"Adelas [uxor] Ottoni marchioni de Italia\" . No reference has yet been found to her second marriage.\n\nEkbert [I] & his wife had two children:\n\n1.EKBERT [II] von Braunschweig (-killed 3 Jul 1090) . The Notæ Sancti Blasii name \"Ecbertus, Gertrudim\" as children of \"Ecbertum [filium Ludolfi]\" . \"Heinricus rex\" granted property \"pro remedio animæ marchionis Eggeberti in pago Milsca in villa Goreliz sub comitatu Eggeberti filii predicti marchionis\" to the cathedral of Meissen by charter dated 11 Dec 1071 . The Annalista Saxo describes \"Ekberto comiti de Bruneswic\" as patruelis of Emperor Konrad II, when recording the latter installing him as Markgraf, and names him \"Ecbertus marchio iunior de Bruneswic et hec sine liberis obit\" in an earlier passage . Graf von Braunschweig. He was installed as EKBERT II Markgraf von Meissen. This was presumably after the death of his father as there is no record of any other appointment as Markgraf at that time, although Ekbert would have been very young then. The Annales Sancti Blasii Brunsvicenses record that \"Ecbertus marchio\" was the founder of \"Cyriaci martyris\" . He supported anti-king Rudolf von Rheinfelden against Heinrich IV King of Germany during the war of investitures, as shown by the charter dated 25 Mar 1079 under which \"Rudolfus rex\" donated property \"Rokeborthurf in pago castri Zalin\", on the request of \"marchionis Ekiberti pro remedio patris eius pie memorie Ekiberti marchionis\", to the church of Meissen . This also demonstrates that his rebellion against King Heinrich in early 1086 or before was not a new development. The king deposed Ekbert as Markgraf and redistributed his property, as shown by the charters under which \"Heinricus Romanorum imperator augustus\" granted property to the church of Utrecht, dated 7 Feb 1086 in \"comitatum Fresie nomine Ostrogowe et Westregowe quam Eggebertus in hoc comitatu habuit\" , and dated 3 Apr 1086 at \"Islegowe quam Ekbertus exinde habuerat\" (which refers to \"nos marchionem Ekbertum post priorem rebellionem adoptivus ille noster filius Ekbertus\") . The Libro Memoriarum Sancti Blasii records that \"Egbertus marchio\" was killed in Jul 1090 . m (before 1080) ODA von Weimar, daughter of OTTO Graf von Weimar Markgraf von Meissen & his wife Adela de Louvain (-1111). The Annalista Saxo names (in order) \"Odam, Cunigundam, Adelheidam\" as the three daughters of Markgraf Otto by his wife, specifying that Oda married \"Ecbertus marchio iunior de Bruneswic et hec sine liberis obit\" .\n\n2.GERTRUD von Braunschweig ([1065]-9 Dec 1117) . The Annalista Saxo names \"Gertrudem, filiam Ekberti marchionis senioris, matrem Richenze inperatricis\" as wife of Graf Dietrich [II] . In a later passage, it names \"Gertrudis soror Ecberti marchionis iunioris\" as wife of Graf Heinrich, specifying that she escaped with difficulty after her husband was killed . Heiress of Braunschweig. The Genealogica Wettinensis names \"Gerdrude que erat de Bruneswich\" as wife of \"marchio Heinricus\" . The Annales Sancti Blasii Brunsvicenses record that \"Gertrudis marchionissa filia Ecberti\" was the founder of \"Sancti Egidii in Brunswik\" . A charter dated 1134, under which her son-in-law Emperor Lothar donated property to the monastery of St Marie at Brunswick, names \"Gertrudis marchionissa, filia Ekeberti marchionis\" as founder and also names \"coniuge nostra Rikensa, eiusdem marchionisse filia [et] filii sui Ottonis et filiarum, Richenze coniugis nostre et Gertrude Palatine comitisse\" . The Libro Memoriarum Sancti Blasii records the death in Dec 1117 of \"domina Ghertrudis marchionissa iunior\" . m firstly DIETRICH [II] Graf von Katlenburg, son of DIETRICH [I] Graf von Katlenburg [Stade] & his wife Bertrada of Holland (-1085). m secondly HEINRICH \"der Fette\" Graf von Northeim, son of OTTO Graf von Northeim Duke of Bavaria & his wife Richenza of Swabia [Ezzonen] (-killed in battle Frisia 1101). He was installed as Markgraf in Friesland by Emperor Heinrich III in 1101 but was killed while attempting to subdue the territory . m thirdly ([1101/02]) HEINRICH I Markgraf von Meissen Graf von Eilenburg, Markgraf der Niederlausitz, son of DEDO [II] Markgraf der Niederlausitz [Wettin] & his second wife Adela de Louvain ([1070]-1103).\n\nChapter 2.

The Chronicon Sancti Michaelis Luneburgensis names \"Willehelmus\" as fourth son of \"Heinricus dux\" specifying that he was born in England, and was buried \"in medio monasterio\" . His birth is recorded by Matthew Paris . He remained in England after his parents returned to Germany in spring 1185 . He and his brother Otto were given to Emperor Heinrich VI as hostages in 1194 in return for the release of Richard I King of England . Herzog von Lüneburg. He founded the town of Bleckede and granted it the trading rights which had been customary in Bardowick, a neighbouring town to Lüneburg whose trading interests had been harmed by the founding of Lübeck but whose decline was hastened after Wilhelm's father became lord of Lübeck in 1159 . Willelmus de Luneburch...coniuge nostra Helena et filio nostro Ottone granted freedoms to the town of Löwenstadt, with the consent of comite Henrico de Dannenberch et filio ipsius Vulrado, Bernardo comite de Welepa, Wernero, Olrico, Henrico, Ottone comitibus de Luchow..., by charter dated 28 Aug 1209 .
