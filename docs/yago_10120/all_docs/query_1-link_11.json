        "text": "by Susan Flantzer\n\n© Unofficial Royalty 2012\n\nThe House of Oldenburg reigned in Denmark from 1448 – 1863 and originated in northern Germany in the city of Oldenburg now in Lower Saxony, Germany. Oldenburg was the capital of the County of Oldenburg which later became a Duchy, Grand Duchy, and Republic. In 1448, Count Christian I of Oldenburg was elected King of Denmark. The Danish kings continued as Counts of Oldenburg until 1773 when Danish rule ended and Oldenburg became a duchy. The Danish kings were also Kings of Sweden from 1397-1523 and Kings of Norway from 1397-1814.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Danish Index\n\nWikipedia: House of Oldenburg\n\nThe Danish Monarchy (official website)\n\nRoskilde Cathedral has been the main site for Danish royal burials since the 15th century and most kings from the House of Oldenburg are buried there. King Harald Bluetooth named Roskilde the capital of Denmark in 960 and a small wooden church dedicated to the Holy Trinity was built on the location of the current cathedral. The first stone cathedral, in the Romanesque style, was completed in 1080 and a monastery was completed soon afterward. In 1200, an expansion of the cathedral was begun. The new cathedral was in the Gothic style and was twice as high as the old one. Work on the interior of the cathedral started in 1439, but a fire in 1443 burned the cathedral and it had to be reconstructed. During the Reformation, in 1538, the cathedral ceased being a place of Catholic worship and became a house of Protestant worship. Today the Danish Royal Family are members of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Denmark sometimes called The Church of Denmark, the established, state-supported church in Denmark.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Roskilde Cathedral\n\nOfficial Website of Roskilde Cathedral\n\nYouTube: Roskilde Cathedral\n\nYouTube: Roskilde Cathedral History\n\nHouse of Oldenburg\n\nChristian I, son of Count Dietrich of Oldenburg, reigned 1448 – 1481\n\nHans, son of Christian I, reigned 1481 – 1513\n\nChristian II, son of Hans, reigned 1513 – 1523\n\nFrederik I, son of Christian I, reigned 1523 – 1533\n\nChristian III, son of Frederik I, reigned 1534 – 1559\n\nFrederik II, son of Christian III, reigned 1559 – 1588\n\nChristian IV, son of Frederik II, reigned 1588 – 1648\n\nFrederik III, son of Christian IV, reigned 1648 – 1670\n\nChristian V, son of Frederik III, reigned 1670 – 1699\n\nFrederik IV, son of Christian V, reigned 1699 – 1730\n\nChristian VI, son of Frederik IV, reigned 1730 – 1746\n\nFrederik V, son of Christian VI, reigned 1746 – 1766\n\nChristian VII, son of Frederik V, reigned 1766 – 1808\n\nFrederik VI, son of Christian VII, reigned 1808 – 1839\n\nChristian VIII, grandson of Frederik V, reigned 1839 – 1848\n\nFrederik VII, son of Christian VIII, reigned 1848 – 1863\n\nAll photos of Roskilde Cathedral and the burial places in Roskilde Cathedral were taken by Susan Flantzer in August 2011 unless otherwise noted.

His parents were Count Dietrich of Oldenburg and Hedwig of Schleswig and Holstein. Christian succeeded his father as Count of Oldenburg in 1440. When King Christopher of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway died childless in January of 1448, Christian was elected King of Denmark. On October 28, 1449, Christian married Dorothea of Brandenburg, the widow of King Christopher, in Copenhagen. Christian and Dorothea had five children including Hans I who succeeded his father, Frederik I who was a later king, and Margarete who married King James III of Scotland.\n\nKing Christian I died in Copenhagen on May 21, 1481, at the age of 55, and was buried in the Chapel of the Magi at Roskilde Cathedral. While the tombs of King Christian III, King Frederik II, and their queen consorts are in the Chapel of the Magi, the graves of King Christian I and Queen Dorothea are marked with simple stones because the chapel itself was to be considered their memorial monument.\n\nDorothea of Brandenburg, Queen of Denmark, Norway and Sweden\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Dorothea of Brandenburg, Queen of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden\n\nDorothea of Brandenburg was born in 1430 or 1431 in Brandenburg, Germany. Her parents were John, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach and Barbara of Saxe-Wittenberg. She was married to two Kings of Denmark. On September 12, 1445, Dorothea married Christopher of Bavaria, the King of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway. After the death of King Christopher, she married the next king, Christian I.\n\nQueen Dorothea died on November 25, 1495 in Kalundborg, Denmark at around age 65. She is buried next to her second husband in the Chapel of the Magi at Roskilde Cathedral.\n\n*********************\n\nHans, King of Denmark (1481–1513), Norway (1483–1513) and as John II of Sweden (1497–1501)\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Hans, King of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden\n\nKing Hans was born on February 2, 1455, at Aalborghus Castle in Aalborg, Denmark, the son of King Christian I of Denmark and Dorothea of Brandenburg. On September 6, 1478, Hans married Christina of Saxony. The couple had four children including King Christian II.\n\nKing Hans died February 20, 1513, at age 58 at Aalborghus Castle a few weeks after being thrown from his horse. He was buried in the Gråbrødre Church of the Franciscan monastery in Odense, Denmark which his wife Queen Christina had chosen as the burial site for her husband and herself. Queen Christina commissioned the famous German sculptor Claus Berg to create a burial chapel in the church of the Franciscan monastery for her and her husband. Berg’s intricately carved and gilded altarpiece is a Danish national treasure. The altarpiece depicts the passion and the crucifixion of Jesus, and the crowning of the Virgin Mary. The base shows members of the royal family including King Christian II, King Hans, and his wife Queen Christina, dressed as a widow.\n\nHans and Christina’s son King Christian II was also interred in the burial chapel in the church of the Franciscan monastery. In 1807, the former Franciscan church was demolished, and Berg’s altarpiece and the remains of King Hans, his wife Christina, and their son King Christian II were transferred to St. Canute’s Cathedral, also in Odense, Denmark.\n\nWikipedia: St. Canute’s Cathedral\n\nOdense Domkirke (official website in English)\n\nChristina of Saxony, Queen of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Christina of Saxony, Queen of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden\n\nChristina of Saxony was born in Torgau, Saxony (now in Germany) on December 25, 1461. She was the daughter of Ernest, Elector of Saxony and Elisabeth of Bavaria.\n\nQueen Christina died December 8, 1521, at age 59 in Odense, Denmark, and was originally buried with her husband in the church of the Franciscan monastery in Odense, Denmark. In 1807, when the former Franciscan church was demolished, her remains along with the remains of her husband and her son Christian II were transferred to St. Canute’s Cathedral, also in Odense, Denmark.\n\n*********************\n\nChristian II, King of Denmark, Norway (1513–23) and Sweden (1520–21)\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Christian II, King of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden\n\nKing Christian II was born in Nyborg Castle, Denmark on July 1, 1481. His father was King Hans and his mother was Christina of Saxony. On August 12, 1515, Christian married Isabella of Austria. The couple had five children, but only their two daughters reached adulthood. Christian’s reputation is negative and he is remembered as “Christian the Tyrant.” In 1520, Christian invaded Sweden and caused the Stockholm Bloodbath when 80-90 members of the nobility and clergy were executed. Christian was deposed in 1523 when the crown was offered to his uncle Duke Frederick of Holstein who reigned as King Frederik I. He lived for a time in exile in Lier in the Netherlands. In 1531, Christian attempted to take control of his former kingdoms, but he failed and surrendered to King Frederik I. King Frederik reneged on his promise of safe conduct, and Christian was imprisoned for 27 years, first in Sønderborg Castle and then in Kalundborg Castle.\n\nChristian died on January 25, 1559, aged 77, at Kalundborg Castle. King Frederik II ordered a royal funeral for Christian and he was buried with his parents in the church of the Franciscan monastery in Odense, Denmark. In 1807, when the former Franciscan church was demolished, Christian’s remains along with the remains of his parents were transferred to St. Canute’s Cathedral, also in Odense, Denmark.\n\nIsabella of Austria, Queen of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Isabella of Austria, Queen of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden\n\nIsabella of Austria was born July 18, 1501, in Brussels. Her father was Philip, Duke of Burgundy also known as Philip the Handsome. Isabella’s mother was Queen Juana of Castile, the daughter of King Ferdinand of Aragon and Queen Isabella of Castile and the sister of Catherine of Aragon, Henry VIII’s first wife. When her husband was deposed, Isabella went into exile with him even though King Frederik I offered her his protection if she stayed in Denmark.\n\nAfter a serious illness, Isabella died at age 24 on January 29, 1526, in Ghent, Spanish Netherlands, now in Belgium. She was originally buried in St. Peter’s Abbey in Ghent. In 1883, thanks to the efforts of the Danish government, Isabella’s remains and those of her son Hans were transferred to St. Canute’s Cathedral where they were reburied next to the remains of King Christian II.\n\n*********************\n\nFrederik I, King of Denmark and Norway, reigned 1523 – 1533\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Frederik I, King of Denmark and Norway\n\nKing Frederik I was born on October 7, 1471, at Haderslevhus in Haderslev, Denmark, a castle that was destroyed by a fire in 1644. He was the youngest son of King Christian I and Dorthea of Brandenburg. Shortly after his father’s death, Frederik became co-Duke of Schleswig and Holstein along with his older brother King Hans. When King Hans died, a group of nobles offered Frederik the Danish throne, but he thought the throne rightly belonged to his nephew Christian II. When Christian II was deposed, Frederik became king. Frederik I was the last Roman Catholic monarch of Denmark.\n\nFrederik married twice, first to Anna of Brandenburg with whom he had two children including King Christian III. Anna, who was Duchess Consort of Schleswig and Holstein, died before her husband became King of Denmark. Four years later, on October 9, 1518, Frederick married Sophie of Pomerania. The couple had six children.\n\nKing Frederik I died on April 10, 1533, at the age of 61 at Gottorf Castle in Schleswig, Duchy of Schleswig-Holstein, now in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.

His parents were King Frederik V and his first wife, Louise of Great Britain. Christian became king in 1766 at the age of 17 upon the death of his father. Christian married his first cousin Princess Caroline Matilda of Great Britain, the youngest sister of King George III, at Christiansborg Palace in Copenhagen, Denmark on November 8, 1766. The couple had two children, Frederik VI who succeeded his father, and a daughter Louise Auguste, who is believed to be the daughter of Johann Friedrich Struensee. (See Caroline Matilda’s entry below.) Christian suffered from mental illness, probably schizophrenia, and after 1772 was king in name only.\n\nKing Christian died on March 13, 1808, aged 59, from a brain aneurysm, at Rendsburg, Duchy of Schleswig, now in the German state of Schleswig-Holstein.

Her father, who was the eldest son and heir of King George II of Great Britain, died when Caroline Matilda was three months old and her eldest brother, the future King George III, became heir to the British throne. Caroline Matilda’s marriage to King Christian VII was not a happy one. She was 15 at the time of the marriage and neither Caroline Matilda nor her brother King George III was aware of King Christian’s mental illness. Caroline Matilda was neglected by her husband who turned to a mistress and prostitutes. King Christian’s personal physician, the German Johann Friedrich Struensee, was somewhat successful in controlling the king’s mental illness. King Christian began to trust his physician and Struensee encouraged the king to reconcile with the queen. The lonely Caroline Matilda was impressed with Struensee and her affection towards him steadily grew, resulting in the couple becoming lovers. It is almost a certain fact that Struensee was the father of Caroline Matilda’s second child, a daughter.\n\nDuring the night of January 16 -17, 1772, both Struensee and Caroline Matilda were arrested and in April of 1772, Christian VII and Caroline Matilda were divorced.

His parents, who were both teenagers at the time of his birth, were King Christian VII and Caroline Matilda of Great Britain. Due to his father’s mental illness, Frederik served as Regent from 1784 until his father’s death and his own accession to the throne in 1808. In 1814, during the Napoleonic Wars, Frederik agreed to cede Norway to Sweden to avoid the occupation of Jutland by troops allied with Napoleon. Frederik married his first cousin Marie Sophie of Hesse-Kassel and the couple had eight children. None of their sons survived infancy and only two daughters, whose marriages were childless, survived infancy.\n\nKing Frederik died December 3, 1839, aged 71, at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen.

Marie Sophie was raised mostly in Denmark where her father held several government positions. She was popular in Denmark and the Danish people regarded her as Danish, not German. Injuries from her last childbirth prevented her from having any further marital relations and she was forced to accept her husband’s adultery. Marie Sophie greatly lamented the fact that she had no sons and no grandchildren and retired from public life after the death of her husband.\n\nMarie Sophie died on March 22, 1852, aged 84, at Frederiksberg Palace in Denmark.

His parents were Hereditary Prince Frederik of Denmark and Sophia Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Hereditary Prince Frederick was the son of King Frederik V and his second wife, Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Christian succeeded his cousin, Frederik VI. Christian married twice. His first marriage, before his accession to the throne, was to his cousin Charlotte Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin on June 21, 1806. The couple had two sons, but only King Frederik VII, who would succeed his father, survived to adulthood. Charlotte Frederica was accused of adultery and the marriage was dissolved in 1810. On May 22, 1815, Christian married Caroline Amalie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg at the Augustenborg Palace. Christian and Caroline Amalie were childless.\n\nKing Christian died on January 20, 1848, aged 61, from blood poisoning at Amalienborg Palace in Copenhagen.

There is strong evidence that Louise Auguste’s father was her mother’s lover Johann Friedrich Struensee. Caroline Amalie was a composer of piano music and founded and supported a number of orphanages.\n\nCaroline Amalie survived her husband by 33 years. She died on March 9, 1881, at age 84. She was buried at Roskilde Cathedral in the Frederik V Chapel.\n\n*********************\n\nFrederik VII, King of Denmark, reigned 1848 – 1863\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Frederik VII, King of Denmark\n\nKing Frederik VII was born on October 6, 1808, in Copenhagen. His parents, who divorced when he was two years old, were King Christian VIII and his first wife, Charlotte Frederica of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Frederik married three times and his first two marriages ended in divorce. On November 1, 1828, Frederik married his second cousin Princess Vilhelmine Marie of Denmark, a daughter of King Frederick VI of Denmark. The couple separated in 1834 and divorced in 1837. He married Caroline Charlotte Mariane of Mecklenburg-Strelitz on June 10, 1841, and divorced her in 1846. Both these marriages occurred before his accession to the throne in 1848.\n\nFrederik’s third marriage was a morganatic marriage, a marriage between people of unequal social rank, which prevents the wife and the children of the marriage from enjoying any of the husband’s titles and privileges. On August 7, 1850, at Frederiksborg Palace, Frederik married Lovisa Christina Rasmussen, a hat maker and former dancer, who had been his mistress. She was not Queen Consort but instead was created Countess Danner. The marriage appears to have been a happy one but had much opposition and Countess Danner was treated poorly in social circles. All three of Frederik’s marriages were childless and therefore, there was a succession crisis. Prince Christian of Glücksburg, a descendant of a cousin of King Frederick VI, was chosen as the heir-presumptive in 1852. Upon Frederik’s death, Prince Christian acceded to the throne as King Christian IX.\n\nKing Frederik died on November 15, 1863, aged 55, at Glücksburg, Schleswig-Holstein (Germany). He was buried at Roskilde Cathedral in the Frederik V Chapel.\n\n*********************"
