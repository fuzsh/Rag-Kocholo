        "text": "Mortality and remaining bedridden following the hip fracture surgery are not rare. We tried to measure the levels of inflammatory markers tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) following the hip fracture surgery and compare their levels with controls. We aimed to show a relationship between the levels of these markers and post-operative mortality and walking capability.\n\nIntroduction: Osteoporosis is a condition, causing the hip fractures in the elderly. Hip fractures have a high rate of overall mortality up to 30% following the incident. Cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-α are suggested to play a role in bone resorption and, thus, in the etiology of osteoporosis.\n\nMethods: Plasma levels of IL-6 and TNF-α were measured pre-operatively and on the first and second days after the surgery in 40 Turkish hip fracture patients. The levels of these cytokines were compared with 40 Turkish age-matched healthy controls. The levels of these cytokines were compared between the deceased and surviving patients, as well as the existence of walking capability following the surgery.\n\nResults: Significantly higher IL-6 levels were shown on the first and second days after the surgery (p = 0.005; p = 0.01, respectively). The overall death rate of our study group within the 2-year follow-up time was found to be 35%. No statistical significance was found in the means of 2-year follow-up mortality between the patients. Presence of walking capability did not differ between the patients, as well."
