For many, motivation for a new job springs from salary increases, greater responsibilities, … For me, the pivotal factor in each of my roles has always been the brand itself !(does it inspire me, ignite my passion?) 𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐭𝐡𝐞 𝐛𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐝𝐬𝐜𝐚𝐩𝐞 Many years ago my greatest dream came true when I started my career working for a german tobacco brand in Rome. 🏎️ As a part of the Formula 1 sports sponsorship team, I was responsible for adapting marketing campaigns and managing local PR for the company's global motorsport involvement. This role sparked my fascination with the power of branding in creating emotional connections with consumers. 🛹🛼After following my experience in sports and youth marketing with pioneering brands like Red Bull, K2, Afri-Cola, I unexpectedly embarked on a long tenure in the beauty industry 💅🏻💄 Through each chapter, my fascination with brands has deepened and as I embark on the exciting journey of self-employment, I carry with me the rich and diverse experiences from my past roles and brands I worked for. 𝐀𝐮𝐭𝐡𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐢𝐜 𝐁𝐫𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐄𝐧𝐠𝐚𝐠𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐆𝐫𝐨𝐰𝐭𝐡 I am dedicated to helping brands resonate authentically with their audiences, leveraging my expertise in brand strategy, communication and consumer engagement to drive meaningful connections and sustainable growth. Everyone has a core motivation that consistently drives and inspires them in their career. For me, it has always been the transformative power of brands! Their ability to shape our lives, define lifestyles, and create lasting impressions inspires me and is fueling my dedication and enthusiasm in every role I've undertaken.
