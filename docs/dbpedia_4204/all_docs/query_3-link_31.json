Right from the start, each of the films gained global acceptance and were quickly recognized as new wave of Turkish horror genre.[3]\n\nThe title of this franchise is derived from the Arabic word Sijjin (سِجِّين) meaning either a book that lists the names of the damned or a prison, located in the bottom of hell.[4] However, the word's origin is unknown.

Then she spotted two women in black watching her. At home, Adnan accused her for being an irresponsible mother and he will not be able to forgive her. Everyday Hicran washed the dead child’s clothes and dried it as she thinks he is alive. A friend of Hicran has pity on her and tells her to meet Abdullah Hodjah but she refuses. Hicran is troubled by the women who seemed to be evil and she decided to go to Hodjah at once. Hodjah said that her son is in Heaven with the angels and she has been trapped in a bad spell which has a link with her aunt. Hicran goes to her mother's house to enquire about her aunt.
