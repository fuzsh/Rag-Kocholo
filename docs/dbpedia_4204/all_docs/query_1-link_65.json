        "text": "Henri Prost, who was one of the founders of town planning in France, was invited to prepare the master plan of Istanbul by the Turkish government in 1935. He conducted the planning of the historic capital and the most populous city of Turkey from 1936 to 1951. Although Prost has been renowned particularly with his conservative attitude toward the cultural heritage and the assets of the natural landscape, curiously he adopted a highly interventionist planning approach in Istanbul. \" Les Transformations d'Istanbul \" is the title of his speech at the Institut de France in September 1947. This title, which he gave later to the collection of his planning notes, reveals the principal goal of his planning in Istanbul on the basis of three principal issues: transportation, hygiene and aesthetics. The aimed transformation was twofold: it consisted in restructuring the city as a whole mainly by establishing a new transportation infrastructure, and reshaping the urban fabric by intervening on the building and population density of the existing centers. In line with the idea of a \" concentration plan, \" the plans that he prepared for the historic peninsula were directed to rationalize the street network and to increase the building density. But, while Prost intervened radically on the historic fabric of the city, he also cared for the \" total effect \" in Istanbul's skyline. Prost's plans, which were partly implemented during and after his stay in Istanbul, had long lasting effects on the city's transformation.\n\nFollowing the establishment of the Republic of Turkey, urbanism became one of main issues in the agenda of the State. Between 1923 and 1940, 117 cities and towns in Anatolia and Rumelia were planned. After planning cities demolished during the War of Independence, in pursuit of Great Depression in 1929, Etatism and Populism principles became basis for policy-oriented development of urban space. This study aims at examining İzmit Urban Plan in 1935 (by Hermann Jansen) in the context of urban planning approaches and 1930s’ political structure of the Republic of Turkey. In this perspective, this article is divided into three main parts. In the first part, I discuss 19th Century and 20th Century prevailing approaches of Urbanism in Europe and their relevance in Turkey’s Urban Planning Practice. In the second part, I manifest general structure, issues, and different periods of Early Republican Urban Planning in Turkey. In the third part, I discuss importance of İzmit Urban Plan in this period as a model in addition to analyzing basic design and planning principles of the Plan. Further, I scrutinize similarities and differences of the Plan with European urbanism models.\n\nFollowing the proclamation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, one of the most important urban planning and architectural projects of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk's national program was the establishment and development of a new capital city called Ankara. During these formative years, Ankara underwent a major program of architectural urbanism and modernism that visually set the young republic apart from its recent Ottoman past. This paper will attempt to examine historical precedents in capital city planning via a crosscountry analysis to that of Ankara; however, it will also highlight the extant literature and contribute to the argument that Ankara provides a unique experience in modernism, urbanism, and especially nation-building in the 20th century. Although Turkey's political and national direction has taken a new course in the early 21st century, the Kemalist strategy in communicating national identity and nation-building continues to be emulated and communicated in state-sponsored architecture in Ankara.\n\nThe article examines visions on Istanbul in the thirties, which suggested the first modern transformation of the city. The press became the communication floor of ideas, where columnists and educated, professional and non-professional, as well as interested people were able to share their views on the reorganization of the city. Early visions will be sought among the current news and comments that reflected actual problems of the city. A summary of problems and suggestions of final resolution was mentioned by the Prost report written in 1938. Through the visions of the Prost plan, strategies will be construed that re-formed Istanbul’s urban organization in the thirties.\n\nThe post war period in Turkey witnessed a phase of rapid urbanization that strongly shaped the social and political environment during the 1960s and the 1970s. In this period, marked by the extensive politicization of the urban masses, urban problems entered into the realm of daily politics and urban politics evolved into an autonomous realm of struggle. This dissertation project aims at studying the emergence and development of this struggle in the 1970s with a specific focus on the role of a certain social group: that of architects and urban planners. The main argument of the study is twofold: first, social movements that arose in the 1960s developed into exclusively urban forms, transforming not only themselves but also public conceptions and experiences regarding the urban realm in the 1970s. Second, Turkish architects and planners, homogeneously labeled as urban professionals, played a particular role in this transformation and contributed to the making of urban politics as an autonomous realm of struggle. Revealing the socio-economic dynamics leading to the urbanization of social movements that emerged in the 1960s, the dissertation scrutinizes a number of themes that appear as both the constituents of urban politics and topics of pursuit for urban professionals. The development of the professional identities of Turkish architects and urban planners are analyzed alongside the transformation of physical planning activity in the country. Additionally, the concept of urban politics is expanded beyond the limits of local administrations to include both the housing question and representations of the city as political issues opened up to the direct involvement of urban professionals. Finally, after historical investigation of the role played by urban professionals in the making of urban politics, their agency in relation to this specific domain of struggle is defined through the concept of “organic intellectuals”.\n\nIstanbul is a historical city based on the ancient Roman, Byzantine and Ottoman periods plannings. City's old historical quarters and antique axes continued to use till to late Ottoman period. In the 19 th century, Istanbul became a chaotic city after the city fires, earthquakes destroying Historical Peninsula thousands years. Thus, in the 19 th century some of the old city quarters Ottoman mahalle's influenced by the great city fires and later replanned by the western planners. In the 19 th century, European planning methods based to French Beaux-Art, but, new grid system entered to planning terminology via French planner Augustin Rey. After the great city fires in Istanbul, some regenerations realized by Italian planner Luigi Storari's western style grid plannings in old, historical quarters of Istanbul. These modern grid plannings not matched the Istanbul city's old, middle age quarters and cul de sac urban matrixes. So city's transformations seen through from the medieval urban pattern to the modern grid plannings with modern applications. These plannings changed the method of land use transformed to historical city's small parcels via modern grid plannings to the modern housing models, building-blocks and apartments. In the Beginning of the the 20 th century, Istanbul city wanted to planning again by a French planner Henri Prost likewise the European modern capitals. A new flexible planning method a synthesis of curvy and grid system developped for Istanbul city's antique and unique topography by H. Prost. After the 1950's, view of the neoliberal policies and globalisation changed the world radically. In the 1950s, with the neoliberal policies of the rule of the Democrat Party, H. Prost's modernization projects used political purpose the openning new modern broad road axis. In the 1960's, post-Prost period Istanbul city tarnsfromed with the inner mass migrations and uncontrolled implementation of Prost plan with modern high rise blocks destroyed the Historical Peninsula's old quarters and vernacular areas."
