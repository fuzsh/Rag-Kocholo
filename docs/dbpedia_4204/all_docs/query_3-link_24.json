        "text": "I am a Lecturer in Urban Planning at The University of Manchester. My work and research focus on spatial planning, urban policy and governance, and health creation and health inequalities. I investigate these topics through practically engaged, evidence-focused, critical research and using both quantitative and qualitative methods. Specifically, my most recent research critically investigates what sort of changes in urban development decision-making processes are needed to bring about the imminent transformation needed to achieve our sustainability goals and to create just and healthier cities.\n\nI have extensive research experience, having worked as a Principal Investigator (PI) for externally funded projects, as a Co-Investigator (Co-I) for national and international projects, and in various roles for several small-scale independent or funded research projects. I also have a wide range of lectureship experience in a university setting, having supervised over a hundred student dissertation projects and undertaken module leadership duties. Also I am the current Programme Director for two undergraduate (UG) programmes: Masters of Planning (MPlan) and Planning and Real Estate (MPRE).\n\nI have a broad range of teaching experience in a university setting, having supervised student dissertation projects and undertaken lecturing duties on a dozen different modules in the Department of Planning and Environmental Management at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. In recognition of my teaching and learning support in higher education in the UK, I have been awarded a Fellow of the Higher Education Academy in 2022.\n\nIn the academic year 2023/24, I lead and support the following modules:\n\n- PLAN20181 Plan Making & the Development Process\n\n- PLAN10632 Placemaking\n\n- PLAN60832&40712 International Fieldtrip (Istanbul lead)\n\nI am also the Programme Director of Master of Planning (MPlan) and Master of Planning and Real Estate (MPRE) in the Department of Planning and Environmental Management at the University of Manchester.\n\nMy current research comprises three areas of study, and aims to connect these distinct fields to investigate the political economy of healthy cities and emerging trends in the management of built environment for sustainable development.\n\nPlease check my publications and projects listed below (both current and past) for more information.\n\nSpatial planning\n\nMy use of spatial planning is based on realist empirical analysis and case studies of contextualised planning practices, and aims to develop contingent prescriptions for good practice usable in that context. To this end, I am currently investigating strategic planning practices that have appeared since the revocation of regional strategies post-Localism, and the complex urban planning decision-making processes in England.\n\nUrban policy and governance\n\nMy research in this area focuses on the analysis of urban policy and public sector infrastructure provisions against a broad framework of spatial justice, best practice management, and sustainable development goals. To this end, I am currently investigating what sort of changes in our urban governance systems are needed to bring about the imminent transformation needed to achieve our sustainability goals and to create just and healthier cities, focusing on Greater Manchester.\n\nHealth creation, health inequities, and healthy places\n\nSocial justice is at the heart of my research, and I strive to bring health promotion and disparities to the centre of the planning field. To this end, I investigate both what makes the healthy city and what are the barriers in the urban development system to reduce the unjust and avoidable differences in peopleâ€™s health across the population and between specific population groups. In this field, I work with public, private and community organisations."
