        "text": "Thanks to everyone who joined me at Platypus Digital | B Corp's '5 Pillars of Digital Strategy' session yesterday! If you weren't able to make it, here's a snapshop of what you missed: 1. If your vision is why you exist, and your mission is what you're doing to get there, your strategy is how you're going to do it. 2. Digital is a digital marketing and fundraising enabler. It's helping you to do the things you're already doing, but better. So if you're wanting to move in a truly digital-first direction, instead of creating a digital strategy, look to embed digital within your existing ones. 3. Alignment is key. Every goal you set, every tactic you apply, and every decision you make should relate back to your strategy goals and priorities. 4. Just because you build it, doesn't mean they will come. We should all be doing more audience research, and developing asks and products that are specifically tailored to how our supporters experience and move through the world. 5. Strategy is constantly evolving. We don't exist in a vacuum - as the world changes around us, so should our strategies. #strategy #charityfundraising #charitymarketing\n\n5 benefits I see of starting with a one to many approach for #abm 🚀 Scalability: Target multiple like-minded accounts simultaneously, expanding reach without stretching resources. 💡 Resource Efficiency: Group similar accounts to create resonant campaigns, saving time and costs in development and execution. 📊 Quick Learning & Optimisation: Faster data and feedback from multiple accounts allow for rapid strategy refinement. 🔍 Data-Driven Insights: Enhanced analytics capabilities lead to improved targeting and informed decision-making. 🛡 Risk Mitigation: Diversify efforts across accounts to reduce reliance on individual account success. The 1-to-many ABM approach is a gateway to scalable marketing success, blending personalisation with efficiency. It’s ideal for those new to ABM like we are at Synthesia , offering us a manageable pathway to experience the benefits without the intensive resources and risks of a 1-to-1 approach. I'd love to hear how you run your ABM! #revenueoperations #Collaboration #marketing\n\nOne of the fun parts of being an experienced startup GTM leader is that I get to work with companies that are creating new categories. I've worked with over 40 startups in 17 different industries - Most of the products I've brought to market were simple in concept: replace the status quo manual and inefficient process with a web-based, user-friendly digital tool. Sales have CRMs, Finance, and HR have ERPs, and Product teams have PMS --Marketing still uses Excel for media planning. There's a new category in town, and I am so excited to be a part of it. Most media planning/marketing and advertising teams still use Excel to manage their planning data. In the past 6 months, I've met with heads of Global Media & Marketing at the world's largest retailers and CPG brands. Their teams and agencies still use Excel to manage hundreds of thousands of media marketing data points!! 😱 McKinsey research confirms the overwhelming majority of consumers expect personalized campaigns that speak to them. This means advertisers often run dozens of campaigns, with different creatives across different channels, for the same product across multiple markets. Many marketers have found this difficult to implement and track, but not for long. Technology is aligning with segmentation. AI is exploding, and with it, marketers have the ability to interact with smarter, fine-tuned precision at speed and scale. The future is more segmentation, not less. More micro marketing, not mass marketing. More varieties of just the right sort. My company, Mediatool.com, provides A Centralized Platform Built For Global Media Teams. Everything that's required to plan and manage global media campaigns in a web-based and easy-to-use platform. This is gonna be fun! 🤠\n\n🚀 Scaling and Transforming with XALT 🚀 Being present in a highly competitive and ever changing financial landscape, it is imperative to stay ahead - but isn’t it always easier said than done?
