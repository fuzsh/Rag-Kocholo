        "text": "This weekend is the last hurrah of the Turkish Süper Lig, where the 38th-week battles will separate the champions from the chaff, deciding the eventual champions and the last two to face the guillotine.\n\nReigning champions, Galatasaray, entering the last week three points ahead of archrivals Fenerbahçe, need just a single point against a tricky Konyaspor to secure the championship.\n\nFollowing last week's intense derby between the two, where Ismail Kartal's 10-men side edged Okan Buruk's brigade, the stakes have never been higher as this weekend's clashes will prove more crucial than ever.\n\nIf the Lions fail to secure any meat from their hunt and the Yellow Canaries win against Istanbulspor, the Kadiköy side will claim their first title since the 2013-14 season.\n\nThursday's Turkish cup runners-up, Trabzonspor, who have already bagged third place, will host Ankaragücü, who are hanging on a thread as relegation lurks.\n\n2019-20 season champions, Başakşehir with 58 points and the newly-crowned Turkish Cup champions Beşiktaş with 56 will battle it out for the fourth spot.\n\nBaşakşehir face Adana Demirspor away, while Beşiktaş will also be away to face Sami Uğurlu's Kasımpaşa.\n\nThe relegation battle is equally intense, with crucial matches lined up.\n\nAfter Istanbulspor, Fatih Karagümrük are the second team to be confirmed relegated following last week's matches.\n\nThe candidates for the last two relegation spots are the struggling Pendikspor, the troubled Hatayspor, Ankaragücü, Konyaspor, and Gaziantep.\n\nWith the gallows pulling them, Pendikspor, carrying 37 points, are not yet mathematically relegated but face a slim chance of survival.\n\nPendikspor need to finish level on points with Ankaragücü and outperform them on goal difference.\n\nHowever, Ankaragücü currently have a minus 4 goal difference compared to Pendikspor's minus 30.\n\nPendikspor, Hatayspor, Ankaragücü, Konyaspor, and Gaziantep all enter the final week with 41 points each.\n\nIn the relegation zone, Pendikspor host Gaziantep, Hatayspor face Rizespor, and Konyaspor play against title log leaders Galatasaray.\n\nAnkaragücü also travel to Trabzonspor.\n\nThe final week of the Süper Lig sees crucial matches for the teams in the relegation battle.\n\nHatayspor, currently in 17th place, will depend on the outcome of other matches if they win their last game against Rizespor.\n\nThe outcome of other matches, including Konyaspor-Galatasaray, Pendikspor-Gaziantep, and Trabzonspor-Ankaragücü, will determine their fate.\n\nHatayspor, promoted from the 1st Lig as champions in the 2019-2020 season, have been competing in the Süper Lig for four seasons now.\n\nRelegations odds\n\nHatayspor: If Hatayspor beat Rizespor and Ankaragücü fail to win against Trabzon, Hatayspor will stay in the league.\n\nIf Konyaspor and Gaziantep lose, Hatayspor might finish above them on goal difference.\n\nAnkaragücü: Ankaragücü will avoid relegation by defeating Trabzon.\n\nIf the match ends in a draw and Hatayspor beat Rizespor, Ankaragücü will be relegated based on head-to-head results.\n\nKonyaspor: If Konyaspor lose to Galatasaray and Hatayspor win against Rizespor, Konyaspor will be relegated based on goal difference.\n\nIn other scenarios, Konyaspor will stay in the league."
