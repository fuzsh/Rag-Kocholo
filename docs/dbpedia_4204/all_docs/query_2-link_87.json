        "text": "Caglar Panus Social Responsibility and Ethics Factor 1: Problem Jonathan Stein, the new vice president of international contracts for Timothy Thomas, visited a plant in Pakistan. According to him, the problem is to allow children, who are under of 14 years, to work in the Timothy Thomas plant in Pakistan, shorty to employ children in this plant. Moreover, those children and women have been working in difficult circumstances. However, as Yusuf Ahmed said, the sourcing manager of the plant, those children need to work in this plant because of economic circumstances. Parents of those children force them to work because they cannot afford, or even if those children do not work in this plat, they probably will be begging on the streets. On the other hand, those children and women workers said that they are happy with working in the plant. Thus, Jonathan Stein must decide what he needs to do with those children. If he says that children are fine to work in the plant, he will renew the contract with this plant, otherwise he sign it. Factor 2: Stakeholders Jonathan Stein definitely needs to be involved in the decision making, because he is the vice president of international contracts of Timothy and he is also going to sign a contract. Moreover, children, women, and children families are involved in the situation because, if the children are fired, families will earn less money and children may have to beg on the streets, or they even might be thieves. The decision also will affect reputation of the company, because if it is known that the employs children in its plant, it could make them lose their reputation among its customers, and also that bad reputation will affect stockholders of in the stock market. Yusuf Ahmed probably will be affected the decision, because what if Jonathan Stein decides that he sign the contract, Yusuf Ahmed might lose his job. Maybe the most important this is if the children, who almost work for free, are fired, then there be as cheap labor as before, and might have to increase its product price to afford the labor cost. 1 Caglar Panus Social Responsibility and Ethics Factor 3: Approach Jonathan Stein should choose consequentialism theory, which describes the ends justify the means. There are two philosophy of the consequentialism is utilitarianism. Utilitarianism means the consequences of actions are measured against one value and this useful value should be maximized. Work for those outcomes that will give the most advantage to the majority of those affected in the most impartial way possible. Downside of the theory is each individual is different and happiness is not divided fairly. Should the entertainer work endlessly just because he makes many people happy? Factor 4: Ramifications The choices for Jonathan Stein 1) Do not sign the contract, if he does not sign a new contract with the plan, children and women do not have to work there and they do not have to work in difficult circumstances. 2) Sign the contract. If he signs a new contract, children and women will keep working. If they do not work in this plant, they probably will be begging on the streets. 3) He should quit his job. The reason why is to not be able make a decision and feel bad about those people and quit the job. Factor 5: Position I would pick number 2, he should sign the contract. As a result, as children and women said that they are happy with working in this plant, so as a consequence there is no problem employing children and women. Even, if they do not work, they still will not be educated, or will not go to school, so they will be begging on the streets or they even could be thieves. Finally, instead of leaving those workers in a more difficult circumstance firing them, they should keep working and being happy more than that they can receive. 2"
