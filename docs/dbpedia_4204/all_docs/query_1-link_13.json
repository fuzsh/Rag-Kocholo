        "text": "1Introduction\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, a disease caused by the new coronavirus (Sars-CoV-2), imposed on companies and public institutions the adoption of alternatives to in-person work as a measure capable of simultaneously favoring the maintenance of service provision and social isolation, a sanitary measure necessary to preserve the health of the workers. However, many workers did not have adequate working conditions at their homes and most of the companies were not able to properly monitor the occupational risks in this context [1].\n\nThe adoption of information and communication technologies that allow work to be performed at a distance, characterize the telework [2]. Within the scope of the Brazilian judiciary system, telework became possible due to previous implementation of the electronic judicial process (PJe) and had already been regulated and implemented since 2016. Thus, up to 30% of the approximately 230,000 employees were already able to do telework prior to the pandemic, based on planning referring to the productivity goals, organization of the workplace, and personal and family dynamics [3–5].\n\nAlthough telework is generally seen by the employees as having a potential positive effect on their health and well-being due to the greater flexibility in working hours and the longer time spent with the family, possible problems related to the configuration of the workplace and to the isolation of the co-workers can be pointed out [6, 7]. In view of the need for social isolation and the sudden way in which teleworking was imposed on most of the employees, at least at the beginning of this period there was no time for the home workplace to be organized, nor were aspects related to its management, which can involve greater occupational risk to the employees, especially ergonomic and psychosocial [8].\n\nThe adequacy of the home workplace can be related not only to the prevention of musculoskeletal problems, but also to general satisfaction with telework and even with increased self-reported productivity [9]. However, the physical working conditions can be neglected especially in this context in which the employees were not able to prepare properly and the environment and the workstation were not set up or supervised directly by the employer. Thus, the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms, especially in the column and upper limbs, which is known to be related to work involving the intensive use of a computer [10–13], can be even more prevalent when workstation presents poor ergonomic conditions [14–16].\n\nInadequate ergonomic conditions and exposure to risk factors such as repetitive movements, inadequate postures and an inappropriate workstation can be associated with the occurrence of musculoskeletal pain in workers who make intensive use of computers [17]. The configuration of the workstation that favors correct body alignment, such as adjusting the height of the table and chair and the proper positioning of the keyboard and mouse, can be related to the reduction in the occurrence of musculoskeletal complaints in the lumbar and cervical spine, as well as in the upper limbs [18].\n\nStudies that evaluated the ergonomic conditions of teleworkers during the COVID-19 pandemic point to some adverse conditions that can be related to the occurrence of musculoskeletal problems. The exclusive use of the notebook by most of the workers, with the screen in a very low position, and the use of inappropriate chairs, without adequate lumbar support, are among the main problems observed [19, 20].\n\nOn the other hand, considering the multifactorial etiology of work-related musculoskeletal disorders (WMSDs), which involves individual characteristics, biomechanical and psychosocial factors at work, there are studies that indicate that the ergonomic adequacy of the workstation alone is not able to modify the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms in workers who make intensive use of computers [21–23]. Therefore, preventive interventions must be developed with the participation of the workers, also taking into account the psychosocial risk factors of work for them to be more effective [24–26]. In fact, some studies indicate that workers exposed to biomechanical and psychosocial risk factors report musculoskeletal symptoms more commonly than workers exposed to only one of the risk factors [27], and both physical work overload and high emotional and psychological demands, in addition to low social support, are predictors of musculoskeletal pain [28].\n\nTelework can increase the workload and affect the relationship with the colleagues when carried out in a more intensive manner, reducing the socialization of the employee and with the possibility of leading to an increase in the stress levels [29], but it can also increase the workers’ autonomy over the performance of their tasks due to the greater flexibility of schedules and also lead to a reduction in occupational stress, as long as there is adequate organizational support [30–33]. However, in the context of social isolation, greater autonomy can be affected by the need to share space with family members and care for children, especially those of school age [34].\n\nAs this is a relatively recent work modality, especially in the public service, there are few publications in the national and international literature dealing with this topic, especially with regard to the ergonomic risk factors in telework [35]. Considering the inseparability between the ergonomic and psychosocial factors at work in relation to the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms in the work context [36, 37], the objective of this study was to evaluate how these occupational risk factors promoted by telework in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic were related to the musculoskeletal problems in employees of a Brazilian labor judiciary unit.\n\n3Results\n\nAmong the 65 employees working at the Labor Forum who did not do teleworking prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, two were on sick leave and one was on vacation at the time of data collection. The other 62 employees were invited by means of an institutional e-mail, among which 55 accessed the research link and agreed to participate in the study by agreeing to the free and informed consent form. Therefore, a response rate of 88.7% was obtained, with the participation of employees from the 12 units of the Labor Forum.\n\nThe mean age of the participants was 42.6 (7.5) years old and the mean working time at the institution was 10.3 (6.9) years. Nearly two thirds of the participants were female (67.3%), most were married and had no children. Only 16.4% of the employees lived alone, 78.2% occupied the position of judicial technician and the mean weekly workload was 38.1 (3.7) hours (Table 1).\n\nTable 1\n\nVariablen (%)Mean (SD*)Median (IQR**)VariationAge (years)42.6 (7.5)42.0 (10.0)29.0–64.0Gender Female37 (67.3) Male18 (32.7)Marital status Single19 (34.5) Married31 (56.4) Divorced3 (5.5) Widower2 (3.6)Number of co-residences 09 (16.4) 121 (38.2) 212 (21.8) 313 (23.6)Number of children 034 (61.8) 112 (21.8) 29 (16.4)Role Executor2 (3.6) Judicial technician43 (78.2) Judicial analyst10 (18.2)Working time (years)10.3 (6.9)9.0 (6.0)2.0–33.0Weekly workload (hours)38.1 (3.7)40.0 (5.0)25.0–48.0\n\nThe assessment of the workstation using the ROSA-Br presented a mean of the total score of 4.8 (1.6), close to the upper limit of what is considered to have an ergonomic risk and the need for immediate adaptation. This result was largely determined by the evaluation score of section A (chair), which also obtained a score of 4.8 (1.6), while sections B (Monitor/Telephone) and C (Mouse/Keyboard) presented scores of 1.5 (0.6) and 3.6 (1.4), respectively. The evaluation of the workstation by the MUEQ-Br-revised showed a result of 1.0 (1.1) and the mean posture score was 6.7 (2.5). As for the psychosocial factors, demands presented a mean of 13.9 (3.5), control 13.9 (3.5) and social support 21.7 (2.4). In the last 6 months, the employees reported, on average, musculoskeletal problems in little more than 3 body regions, while in the last seven days, they reported problems in little more than one body region (Table 2).\n\nTable 2\n\nVariableMean (SD*)Median (IQR**)VariationROSA-Br Total score (1–10)4.8 (1.6)4.0 (3.0)3.0–9.0 Section A –Chair (1–10)4.8 (1.6)5.0 (3.0)3.0–9.0 Chair height (1–5)2.0 (1.0)2.0 (2.0)1.0–4.0 Pan depth (1–3)1.6 (0.7)1.0 (1.0)1.0–3.0 Armrest (1–5)2.3 (0.9)2.0 (1.0)1.0–4.0 Backrest (1–4)2.2 (1.1)2.0 (2.0)1.0–4.0 Section B –Monitor/telephone (1–9)1.5 (0.6)1.0 (1.0)1.0–3.0 Section C –Mouse/keyboard (1–9)3.6 (1.4)3.0 (2.0)2.0–7.0MUEQ-Br-revised Workstation (0–6)1.0 (1.1)1.0 (2.0)0.0–4.0 Body posture during work (0–18)6.7 (2.5)6.0 (4.0)1.0–13.0JSS Job demands (5–20)13.9 (3.5)14.0 (5.0)6.0–20.0 Job control (6–24)17.6 (2.3)18.0 (3.0)8.0–22.0 Social support (6–24)21.7 (2.4)22.0 (4.0)15.0–24.0NMQ Problems in the last 6 months (0–9)3.2 (1.7)3.0 (2.0)0.0–7.0 Impediments in the last 6 months (0–9)0.6 (1.1)0.0 (1.0)0.0–4.0 Consultation in the last 6 months (0–9)0.7 (1.4)0.0 (1.0)0.0–5.0 Problems in the last 7 days (0–9)1.3 (1.4)1.0 (2.0)0.0–5.0\n\nPassive work, with low demands and low control concentrated the largest number of participants, while the smallest group presented low demands and high control (Table 3).\n\nTable 3\n\nDemand-control modeln (%)Low job strainLow demand/high control9 (16.4)Passive workLow demand/low control21 (38.2)Active workHigh demand/high control11 (20.0)High job strainHigh demand/low control14 (25.5)Total55 (100.0)\n\nAs for the proportion of musculoskeletal problems in each body region, shoulders, neck and wrists/hands were the regions with the most complaints both in the last 6 months and in the last seven days. With regard to the limitation to perform tasks and the need to consult a health professional, the problems in the lumbar spine overcame the problems in wrists/hands (Table 4).\n\nTable 4\n\nProblems in the last 6 monthsImpediments in the last 6 monthsConsultation in the last 6 monthsProblems in the last 7 daysn (%)n (%)n (%)n (%)Neck30 (54.5)5 (9.1)5 (9.1)14 (25.5)Shoulders33 (60.0)6 (10.9)7 (12.7)12 (21.8)Upper back22 (40.0)2 (3.6)5 (9.1)8 (14.5)Elbow10 (18.2)3 (5.5)3 (5.5)4 (7.3)Wrists/hands30 (54.5)4 (7.3)4 (7.3)11 (20.0)Lower back24 (43.6)5 (9.1)7 (12.7)10 (18.2)Hip/thighs7 (12.7)2 (3.6)2 (3.6)3 (5.5)Knees9 (16.4)2 (3.6)2 (3.6)3 (5.5)Ankles/feet9 (16.4)2 (3.6)4 (7.3)5 (9.1)\n\nThe results of the workstation evaluations using ROSA-Br and MUEQ-Br-revised showed a strong correlation with statistical significance, especially the result of section A (chair). Both assessments of the workstation also showed significant correlations of lesser magnitude with the assessment of posture by the MUEQ-Br-revised. The results of posture and demands showed a statistically significant correlation with each other and with the occurrence of musculoskeletal problems (Table 5).\n\nTable 5\n\nVariableWorkstation (MUEQ-Br)Posture (MUEQ-Br)Musculoskeletal problems in the last 6 monthsMusculoskeletal problems in the last 7 daysROSA-Br –Total score0.64**0.27*0.050.03ROSA-Br –Section A0.70**0.23–0.11–0.05ROSA-Br –Section B0.260.200.260.06ROSA-Br –Section C0.49**0.10–0.08–0.07Workstation –MUEQ-Br–0.34*–0.060.01Posture –MUEQ-Br0.34*–0.35**0.29*Job demands0.110.41**0.210.27*Job control–0.06–0.05–0.180.00Social support–0.07–0.19–0.08–0.23\n\nAs for the ergonomic risk pointed out by ROSA-Br, 47.3% of the participants presented a score greater than or equal to 5, when considering the need for immediate intervention. When the participants were separated into two groups according to this risk, a significant difference was observed in the results of the workstation evaluated by the MUEQ-Br-revised, with no differences regarding the results of posture and the occurrence of musculoskeletal problems according to the ergonomic risk (Table 6).\n\nTable 6\n\nVariableROSA-BrnMedian (IQR)Variationp-value*Workstation –MUEQ-Br< 5290.5 (0.7)0.0–2.00.00≥5261.7 (1.2)0.0–4.0Posture –MUEQ-Br< 5296.0 (3.0)1.0–11.00.14≥5266.5 (4.0)3.0–13.0Musculoskeletal problems in the last 6 months< 5293.0 (2.0)0.0–6.00.86≥5263.0 (2.0)0.0–7.0Musculoskeletal problems in the last 7 days< 5291.0 (3.0)0.0–4.00.83≥5261.0 (2.0)0.0–5.0\n\n4Discussion\n\nThis study evaluated the ergonomic risk, the psychosocial factors and the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms, as well as the relationships between these variables in employees of the Brazilian labor judiciary system who were teleworking specifically because of the need for social isolation resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. Telework was imposed abruptly and for an indefinite period of time, which hindered the adequacy of the workplace and its organization. More recent studies have pointed to inadequate ergonomic conditions among office workers during this period, with an increase in musculoskeletal complaints [19, 20]. In this context, our hypothesis was that the ergonomic and psychosocial risks could be higher, which may be related to the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms.\n\nThe originality of this study was the inclusion of the ergonomic assessment of the workstation by means of video calls with teleworkers. In view of the growth in telework, especially driven by the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, new ways of monitoring the working conditions and occupational health must be considered.\n\nAmong the instruments available and validated for Brazilian Portuguese to assess the workstation in activities that require intensive computer use, in this study we chose to use an instrument that depends on the observation of the workstation by the researcher and that could be performed by means of a video call (ROSA-Br) and an instrument that allowed this assessment in a manner reported by the workers themselves (MUEQ-Br-revised). In this way, we sought to relate the results of both workstation evaluations. The results of the two instruments showed a strong correlation with statistical significance. In the same sense, the results of the workplace evaluated by the MUEQ-Br-revised showed a statistically significant difference when comparing the groups according to the ergonomic risk by ROSA-Br, with the group that presented the highest ergonomic risk by ROSA-Br (score≥5) also presenting higher risk by MUEQ-Br-revised.\n\nThe results of the evaluations of the employees’ workstation by ROSA-Br showed, on average, reduced ergonomic risk, with most of the participants having a score below 5. This result was very close to that presented in the study by Besharati et al. [11], in which 46.2% of the participants in face-to-face work presented high ergonomic risk (≥5) according to ROSA. In a study also carried out under live working conditions, Rodrigues et al. [46] observed a higher ergonomic risk assessed through ROSA-Br in administrative workers in relation to our study, both among the workers who did not present musculoskeletal complaints (5.9) and among those with some complaint (6.7). On the other hand, this same study observed a lower ergonomic risk when evaluated through the workstation dimension of MUEQ-Br-revised in relation to our study.\n\nAlthough all the participants were surprised by the imposition of telework, this study was carried out approximately eight months after the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. We think that this period could may have been sufficient for a better adaptation of the home workplace, since some ergonomic guidelines were remotely provided by the institution. Some studies indicate that both direct ergonomic interventions in the workstation and ergonomic guidelines for the workers are able to reduce the ergonomic risk assessed by ROSA, and improve the posture during work [47–49]. Considering that the results of body posture during work according to the MUEQ-Br-revised can vary from 0 to 18, a maximum score of 13.0, with a mean of 6.7, should represent a reduced risk for the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms. These results are similar to those obtained in other studies that evaluated this dimension in Brazilian workers who used computers in the in-person modality [46, 50].\n\nAs for the psychosocial factors of work, the positive influence of the social support dimension stands out, with a mean of 21.7 (2.4), while demands and control showed intermediate results. This result for the social support dimension was surprising in the sense that teleworking has the potential to affect the relationship with the colleagues and the management due to the difficulty of communication, especially in a context of social isolation [8, 29]. Although the productivity goals have been maintained, the suspension of desk services and face-to-face hearings may also have favored the results of the psychosocial factors [5]. Only a quarter of the participants were classified as having high-strain work, while the highest prevalence was for the passive work group.\n\nIn our study, the employees presented, on average, problems in 3.2 (1.7) and 1.3 (1.4) body regions in the 6 months and in the seven days prior to data collection, respectively. Shoulder, neck and wrist/hand problems were the most prevalent, both in the last 6 months and in the last seven days. Although to a lesser extent, as for the most affected body regions, these results are similar to the study carried out three years earlier with 1st instance civil servants from the same institution in face-to-face work [51] and to the study by Besharati et al. [11] with administrative workers. Specifically, in telework during the COVID-19 pandemic, Gerding et al. [20] noted levels of moderate to severe discomfort in more than 40% of the workers in the eyes/neck/head, upper back/shoulders, and lower back regions. In this study, only 21.5% of the participants stated they experienced moderate to severe discomfort in at least one body region while working in their normal office before the COVID-19 pandemic. Other studies that used the NMQ as an instrument to assess musculoskeletal symptoms pointed out the lumbar spine among the most affected body regions in workers who make intensive use of computers in face-to-face work [12, 13, 52, 53]. Although lumbar spine problems are not among the three most prevalent in our study, they appear in the fourth position and are among the most related to limitations in the daily activities and appointments with health professionals.\n\nConsidering that the mean weekly workload among the participants of our study was 38.1 (3.7) hours, varying between 25.0 and 48.0 hours, these results were similar to the studies that pointed to an increased risk for the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms in neck, upper limbs and lumbar spine according to the time of computer use at work [54–57]. In this context, musculoskeletal overload is related to the physical factors of work, to individual factors and to psychosocial factors [58]. According to the systematic review by Keown et al. [59], specifically cervical pain related to work with the use of a computer depends on the interaction between workload, ergonomic aspects and psychosocial factors.\n\nUnlike other studies that assessed the relationship between the results of the workstation evaluations using ROSA or MUEQ with the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms in face-to-face work [11, 38, 46, 47], our study did not point to these relationships on teleworking employees. Both assessments of the workstation presented significant correlations with the posture dimension of MUEQ-Br-revised, although no difference was observed regarding the posture result when comparing the groups according to the ergonomic risk by ROSA-Br. With regard to the psychosocial factors, the demands dimension presented a significant correlation with posture and with the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms. The study by Rodrigues et al. [46], on the other hand, did not observed significant differences for the results of posture and demands assessed by MUEQ-Br-revised between workers with and without musculoskeletal complaints in face-to-face work.\n\nDifferently from in-person work, teleworkers have greater autonomy to decide on taking breaks and making changes to their work station, aiming at comfort and pain relief. This can explain the absence of correlation between the results of the workstation and the number of musculoskeletal complaints in our study.\n\nDespite the unfavorable context of telework in social isolation, the results regarding the ergonomic and psychosocial risks and the occurrence of musculoskeletal problems did not present themselves in a high proportion in our study. It can be assumed that, even in this atypical period, the benefits of telework for the employees in this sample have prevailed over the possible risks. Greater autonomy in carrying out work activities at home with regard to alternating postures, taking rest breaks and organization of the workday can be related to the lack of correlation between the ergonomic adequacy of the workstation and the occurrence of musculoskeletal symptoms. In addition to that, the previous experience of the institution and its managers with regulated telework in recent years may have favored adequate organizational support even in the context of a pandemic [60]. These results are in agreement with the study by Rodríguez-Nogueira et al. [61], who observed a reduction in musculoskeletal complaints in the period of telework in social isolation due to the COVID-19 pandemic among administrative workers.\n\nAmong the limitations of this study, only workers in the labor judiciary were evaluated, who perform a specific activity related to processing and procedural analysis. Studies carried out with workers from different activities should provide additional information about the risks of teleworking. Additionally, data collection was carried out only eight months after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have led to a better adequacy of the workplace at the homes.\n\nFinally, we highlight its cross-sectional design as a limitation, which, despite allowing analysis through correlations and comparisons between variables, does not make it possible to establish cause and effect relationships. We suggest that longitudinal studies with a larger number of participants be carried out in order to better assess how the ergonomic and psychosocial risk factors are related to the occurrence of musculoskeletal problems in telework."
