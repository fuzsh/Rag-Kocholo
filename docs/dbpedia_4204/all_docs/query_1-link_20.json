Thank you. Takabeg (talk)\n\nNo, Armenians have nothing to do with either Meskheti or Meskhetian Turks other than being neighbour to Georgia.

See Talk:Armenian Genocide#Personal explanation. Thank you. Takabeg (talk)\n\nA source said his surname implies a Tatar background. But I've never heard that Aziz Nesin didn't adopt Crimean Tatarness. Do we have to consider him a Crimean Tatar ? This problem is similar to the problem on \"Who is Kurd ?\".

When you have time, could you see Talk:Crimean Tatars#Aziz Nesin etc., Talk:Aziz Nesin. Thank you. Takabeg (talk)\n\nClassifying people according to their genetic background is racism. National background depends on the sense of belonging and mother tongue. Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nIf you examine the source listed closely, the \"surname implies\" is directed at various other public figures (for example Fahrettin Cureklibatur etc.) and not Aziz Nesin, however what it clearly stated is him belonging to the Crimean Tatar community in Turkey. Therefore Takabeg seems to misunderstand the source, and yet insists on his misinterpreted version. And no, maybe the laws in Turkey allow for the second part of the above statement to be true, everywhere else people are classified based on heritage.

From the start, the section heading: \"Ottoman rule and national awakening\". This is very typical of a nationalist approach to Ottoman history, especially among Balkan states: Ottoman rule was just a mistake so that period of history should be skipped as fast as possible, maybe only to be examined as how that particular nation could get out of it, not in itself, which was, of course not at all interesting.

The first minister was Ismail Fazil Pasha, but who was second ?\n\nAccording to basbakanlik.gov.tr, Ömer Lütfi Argeşo.\n\nAccording to Türk Parlamento Tarihi (TBMM Vakfı), Ömer Lütfi Yasan, and there is no mention of the minister of Nafia (Public Works) in the section about Ömer Lütfi Argeşo in same book.\n\nTakabeg (talk)\n\nQuite a few sources just name \"Ömer Lütfi Bey\", and it is easy to see how two individuals with the same name and such similar backgrounds can get confused. This source even manages to identify the two, referring to the chimera \"Ömer Lütfi Argeşo (Yasan)\"! Almost all sources available online that make the distinction appear to agree on Argeşo, though, and this one, Çağdaş Türkiye (1987), even gives specific dates for his (Argeşo's) vekillik: \"27.12.1920–24.1.1921, 24.1.1921, [sic] 24.1.1921–16.5.1921, 19.5.1921–17.11.1921\". (The search term was the only way I saw to make Google's \"snippet view\" reveal the first part of this text, and this one gives the missing bit.) So I'd bet on Ömer Lütfi Argeşo. This source (Birinci Meclis'te muhalefet: İkinci Grup, 1994), however, agrees with Türk Parlamento Tarihi. --Lambiam\n\nI have nominated Turkey for a featured article review here.

Feel free to do so when you get a chance. -- tariqabjotu\n\nAs you know, in \"Districts of Turkey\" template , the provinces of Turkey are distributed to seven geographically defined regions of Turkey. This is technically wrong, as the borders of those regions do not overlap with that of provinces: See this map showing the discrepancies in borders. This is addressed in the article, \"List of regions of Turkey\", claiming provinces are to be considered in the region where most of their territory are located. Although it's with good faith, this solution is imperfect.\n\nSo here's my suggestion:\n\n1. Introduce accurate content to the geographically-defined regions article. The article in Turkish Wikipedia, while it seems very basic, is on the right tract: Türkiye'nin coğrafi bölgeleri.\n\n2. If there is need to have a larger division than provinces, use \"NUTS of Turkey\" instead. The Turkish Statistical Institute does that. Again, the article in Turkish Wikipedia seems solid: Türkiye'nin İBBS'si.\n\nI'm very eagerly awaiting response. Regards. --Mttll (talk)\n\nAbout half of Muğla Province is in Mediterranean and the other half is in Aegean Region. Most of Bilecik Province is in the Central Anatolia, but the capital of the province is in Marmara Province. The provinces of Kahramanmaraş, Şırnak, Erzurum, Konya and some others are problematic in this respect. For the last 8 months or so, I've concentrated on creating articles about towns (belde) of Turkey and I've found a solution to this problem. I categorize both for the Province and the Geographical region. For the template notes can be used for districts which are not in the same geographical region of the province capital. (Like \"Note:Köyceğiz is in Mediterranean Region\".)Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nSo what do you think of Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics of Turkey, which completely overlap with the provincial borders? --Mttll (talk)\n\nI'm afraid I haven't seen your point. Are you proposing to use nuts instead of geographical regions ? Well as far as I can see nuts are used for statistics and don't really convey any information. Geographical regions on the other hand are useful to summerize the main geographical features and climate. So I think geographical regions should be kept in the template. Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nWhat information are you seeing in this article, or in this template for that matter? Geographical regions of Turkey are being used outside their purpose (statistical) and in a technically inaccurate way at that. --Mttll (talk)\n\nOn 2008 July 8, User:Univer had added the following sentence: \"Provinces, by custom, are accepted to be located in the regions where most of their territory remains.\" So the there is nothing wrong with the list. Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nI had already addressed that in my first post in this section. The wrong thing is the subdivisions of seven geographical regions of Turkey are not provinces, but subregions that are based on river basins, mountains etc.; and that there is a way after all, an official one at that, to group Turkish provinces that completely overlap with the official borders. --Mttll (talk)\n\nA requested move survey was started at Talk:Perth_(disambiguation)#Requested_move, which proposes to move:\n\nPerth →\n\nPerth, Scotland →\n\nPerth (disambiguation) → Perth\n\nBackground: There was a previous requested-move survey which ran from late May to mid June.

But as far as I know Döner kebap is one of the popular and traditional dishes in Turkey (please see Döner kebap). Besides, the adjective döner means \"rotating\" in Turkish.

I for one believe that \"Turks\" should redirect to the \"Turkish people\" and that the disambiguation of \"Turk\" is sufficent. My main reason for this is that most offical censuses, including that of Turkic nations, refer to the Turkish people as \"Turks\" within their data.

I believe the Yakut American should be put in some template related with this group for that they are more easy localized in the articles of ethic groups of United States and, because they are culturally Turkish, I believe more appropriate to include in the template \"American Middle East\". I would wanted to get their views on the incorporation of the American ethnic group to that template.- --Isinbill (talk)\n\nAmerican Middle East for Sakha people ? No, Sakha people are from Sakha Republic which is located at about 5000 km distance to Middle east.

Constantine ✍\n\nRecently, in an effort to improve and broaden the coverage of the geographical and administrative features of Şebinkarahisar District, I separated the article about the town Şebinkarahisar, from the article about the district Şebinkarahisar District. This process of separating towns from their larger eponymous districts (communes, municipalities, etc.) has taken place in the Wikipedia in other countries. But, apparently, there is not consensus that such separation is a good idea, see Talk:Şebinkarahisar District#Merge. So, I thought that I'd bring the discussion here for everyone's input. --Bejnar (talk)\n\nThis is not a process that need be done all-at-once, it should be done on an article by article basis. Also, it is not necessarily needed in all cases, but is more appropriate for rural districts where there can be large differences between the town and the district. In the case of city districts there is often no difference, with the boundaries and administration being the same. --Bejnar (talk)\n\nWell almost all Turkish districts have articles (though some only stub) in WP. These articles generally cover the district as well as the district center with the same name. Splitting the articles is certainly possible. But creating about 1000 new articles requires a huge amount of work. Expanding the stubs instead of creating new articles may be a better alternative. Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nHello, folks!

Daniel Case (talk)\n\nWhenever I write İstanbul, somebody immediatelly changes it to Istanbul remarking that the capital dotted İ is not used in English. İstanbul (and İzmir for that matter) is a proper noun and I don't think that the proper nouns are translateble. If the keyboard permits (which is case of Turkish editors) the letter İ should not be changed to I in the English texts. Please check the following articles. Bâlea Lake, Nové Zámky, Hans Christian Ørsted, Jönköping, Évora District and uncountable other examples. Do we have Ø, É etc in English ? Then why do we have to change the name of İstanbul just because English alphabet lacks İ? Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nThey do not change the letter due to the lack of an \"İ\" in the English alphabet. They change it because the English name of \"İstanbul\" is \"Istanbul\" just as Turkish name of \"London\" is \"Londra\". Istanbul is the correct form whenever you write in English. Filanca (talk)\n\nIt's like Vienna vs Wien or Florence vs Firenze. It's simply based on a long history of tradition.

(I think he speaks Turkish, but I'm not 100% certain.) Can anyone help out?

Thank you --Al Ameer (talk)\n\nI cleaned up this sidebar template, {{Turkish people}}, as part of a routine maintenance exercise (no significant change to content, except I did remove a {{Systemic bias}} tag, as there had been no discussion on the talk page for more than 2 years). I thought it strange that, although it is listed among the 100 most-watched templates, it is currently transcluded in only one article. There isn't much point in having a sidebar or navbox template if no (or very few) articles actually use it! I hope members of this project will add it to the relevant pages. Thanks, NSH002 (talk)\n\nAn editor has been adding links on various Turkish-interest articles to a website called OMG! Turkey - The Turkish Celebrity Gossip & News, while in some cases [14][15] deleting other sources. Is OMG! Turkey an acceptable source for Turkish show biz and celebrity information? (I have also posted this inquiry at WP:RS/N#OMGTurkey.com.)--Arxiloxos (talk)\n\nMerhaba!Thanks, Google Translate!\n\nI came across Hüseyin Avni Mutlu, the current governor of Istanbul Province, who's currently redirecting to List of Governors of Istanbul Province. I think it would be best to delete the link to encourage creation of an article on this person, who is almost certainly notable. Discussion will take place at Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2014 February 12#Hüseyin Avni Mutlu. I expressed some confusion over Istanbul apparently having a governor and a mayor. This may or may not have much impact on the discussion. If perhaps the position of governor of Istanbul is now largely ceremonial, perhaps the person isn't as important as I would think. --BDD (talk)\n\nFor the last point; the governors are non-political people and are appointed by the government. They are largely responsible in security of the whole province. The mayors on the other hand are elected people. Up until recently their sphere of influence was limited to a single city in the province. (After March 2014 in some provinces, the authority of the mayors will increase) Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nHow many of you are interested in writing Wikipedia articles on academic books? For instance, I found:\n\nBoğaç A. Ergene: Local Court, Provincial Society and Justice in the Ottoman Empire, Legal Practice and Dispute Resolution in Çankırı and Kastamonu (1652-1744). Studies in Islamic Law and Society, volume 17, Brill, Leiden, 2003. ISBN 90-04-12609-0.\n\nThere is a review in: Die Welt des Islams. If you use a library search engine you may find more WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nVast majority of WP editors are volunteered amateurs and academic essays may require something more.Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nI am aware they are amateurs. But they don't have to write an academic essay itself. Just a summary of what the sources are saying. As an example I'm writing: Before Homosexuality in the Arab‐Islamic World, 1500–1800. You can use WP:RX to acquire these academic sources. WhisperToMe (talk)\n\nPleas add information about this country to this articles.--Kaiyr (talk)\n\nThe official name of the province is Tunceli province not Dersim, however in English Wikipedia it's moved to Dersim Province by someone (Ahmetyal (talk · contribs)) quite possibly with political agenda or whatnot. One can clearly see this at the site of Agency of Provinces (Turkish: İller İdaresi) that the name of the province is indeed Tunceli. Please move it back to Tunceli province and lock the move requests without a real good reason. -- Infestor T•C\n\nYes, I've changed the name but I also gave two reliable sources. If they appear to be wrong on the matter, then we have no choice but to change it back to Tunceli. However it seems weird that the name has not 'officialy changed' when Erdogan promised this and implemented a law about this. --Ahmetyal (talk)\n\nThe name is still Tunceli Province.(see http://www.tunceli.gov.tr/) Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nPresently, the name of the province is Tunceli. Please check the following pages The official population statistics for Tunceli Province, Tunceli Province governor's page,Tunceli University page So what is the reason of this discussion ? Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nIt's to decide which of the two names should be used, so that the chosen name may be applied consistently, because at present some articles use one and some the other. When a topic is controversial, a unilateral decision is always bad, and one-by-one changes to pages can take forever to finish. What I certainly want to avoid is a repeat of the problems of a few weeks ago (see Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/3RRArchive252#User:Master Tyranus reported by User:Ahmetyal (Result: prot), User talk:Redrose64#Tunceli/Dersim Dispute, User talk:Master Tyranus#August 2014), which resulted in a lot of cleanup for myself and other admins. The worst of these was a series of WP:CUTPASTE page moves, which would still have been undesirable even if they had been discussed. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nThe cut&paste page moves by Master Tyranus (talk · contribs) have resumed after exactly two months. --Redrose64 (talk)\n\nNews on this topic: Davutoglu will visit the province on Monday and here the name will be changed to Dersim. --Ahmetyal (talk) http://www.subuohaber.com/politika/tunceli-dersim-oluyor-h4878.html\n\nI had made these changes unilaterally, but was soon reverted by User:Bgwhite, who asked me to seek consensus here. So here I am. Here is a sample of what I propose to do in the articles:\n\nMajor changes/corrections\n\nMaps\n\nRight now, these maps are used in the article:\n\nThese maps are quite simply incorrect; the borders of the geographical regions of Turkey do not overlap with the borders of the administrative provinces.\n\nThis is the correct map of the geographical Aegean Region:\n\nProvinces in the Aegean Region\n\nSince the borders do not overlap, there can be no clear-cut list of provinces in the Aegean Region.\n\nRight now, this list is featured in the article:\n\nProvinces in the Aegean Region\n\nAfyonkarahisar Province\n\nAydın Province\n\nDenizli Province\n\nIzmir Province\n\nKütahya Province\n\nManisa Province\n\nMuğla Province\n\nUşak Province\n\nThis list is also incorrect.\n\nIf we want to list the provinces in the Aegean Region, we will need at least two, but preferable three categorizies:\n\nProvinces that are entirely in the Aegean Region.\n\nProvinces that are mostly in the Aegean Region.\n\nProvinces that are partially in the Aegean Region.\n\nAccording to this map, which shows both geographical and provincial borders, the correct list should be as follows:\n\nProvinces in the Aegean Region\n\nProvinces that are entirely in the Aegean Region:\n\nAydın\n\nUşak\n\nProvinces that are mostly in the Aegean Region:\n\nAfyonkarahisar\n\nDenizli\n\nİzmir\n\nKütahya\n\nManisa\n\nMuğla\n\nProvinces that are partially in the Aegean Region:\n\nBalıkesir\n\nBilecik\n\nÇanakkale\n\nEskişehir\n\nPopulation\n\nSince the geographical borders are imprecise (they don't overlap with district borders either), there is no convenient way to calculate the population of the geographical Aegean Region, or other geographical regions of Turkey for that matter. Any figure you see on the Internet in this regard is, at best, imprecise guesswork. I propose that we rank geographical regions among themselves and leave it at that.\n\nEagerly awaiting comments. Regards. --Mttll (talk)\n\nI see your point. Geographical region and administrative unit are different things. Muğla , Denizli and Afyon have territories out of the Aegean Region. But no harm in considering İzmir, Manisa and Kütahya completely in the Aegean Region. Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nIf we assume this map is perfectly accurate, Izmir and Manisa seem to have some territory in the Marmara Region, like 1% and 3% respectively. For Kütahya, the figure seems closer to 0.01%. Anyway, that's a relatively minor point. The far more pressing issue is the correction of maps and such. By the way, I forgot to mention: I had added the actual subdivision of the geographical Aegean Region, but it was reverted as well:\n\nSubdivision\n\nAegean Section (Turkish: Ege Bölümü)\n\nEdremit Area (Turkish: Edremit Yöresi)\n\nBakırçay Area (Turkish: Bakırçay Yöresi)\n\nGediz Area (Turkish: Gediz Yöresi)\n\nİzmir Area (Turkish: İzmir Yöresi)\n\nKüçük Menderes Area (Turkish: Küçük Menderes Yöresi)\n\nBüyük Menderes Area (Turkish: Büyük Menderes Yöresi)\n\nMenteşe Area (Turkish: Menteşe Yöresi)\n\nInner Western Anatolia Section (Turkish: İç Batı Anadolu Bölümü)\n\n--Mttll (talk)\n\nThe category Category:Turkey articles missing geocoordinate data now contains over 2000 articles that appear to be eligible for geotagging, but have not been geotagged.

The thing is that some statistics about Muslim/Turkish(?) casualties are wrongly cited from sources, but now two editors are simply removing the category of Muslim casualties altogether, leaving only Greek and Armenian figures.

Someone pointed on the talk page that meaning of separate words reads running away without paying a debts, which sounds insulting and not related to Levant. Google translate does translate the expression as \"Levant\". Can anyone speaking the language clarify on Levant's talk page and if needed fix the title ? “WarKosign”\n\nIn this sense, the Turkish equivalent of Levant is the same as in English. \"borçlarını ödemeden kaçmak\" is just a homonym and it has nothing to do with this usage.

I was wondering if you'd be interested in me setting up Wikipedia:The 1000 Challenge (Turkey), based on Wikipedia:The 10,000 Challenge and Wikipedia:The 1000 Challenge (Nordic). Now it's not a contest in itself, it's designed to motivate people to inspire others to improve content and build something which demonstrates the hard work going into the country which is visible. The focus is more on quality improvements but new articles are welcome too. Eventually a Turkish National Contest could be created to fuel it, like Wikipedia:Awaken the Dragon, in which contestants can choose to keep the Amazon vouchers themselves to buy their own books for more articles or put them into book fund to help editors further improve Turkish-related topics by giving them the books they want. It will begin though as purely an improvement drive. Publicize this, get a group of editors together if interested and we'll start it!♦ Dr. Blofeld\n\nAs I know editors like CeeGee are tremendously resourceful and there's some other decent editors working here I've created this at Wikipedia:The 1000 Challenge (Turkey).

It currently consists of a single sentence. I can't find any English-language sources to add to the article or find somewhere to link to it. Any chance someone more familiar with the subject matter (and maybe able to read Turkish?) could take a look? If you could find a ref and maybe even de-orphan the article, that'd be incredible. If there's really nothing out there on the topic, maybe we can consider taking it to AfD. Thanks a bunch! Happy editing!

No such page in tr Wikipedia.\n\nUnsourced, very short.Xx236 (talk)\n\nThere is no need for a subject to be considered as not notable because there is no page of it in another language WP. I am adding now at least one reference. CeeGee\n\nDo we includes theatres in WP ? If the question is yes, then this topic is notable enough.Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nNeeds images. I found some that may be relevant added to a tr wiki article, but since I rely on machine translation, I am not sure if they are indeed relevant - see Talk:2017 March for Justice. I used Creative Commons search and found some more at [21], but again, many have turkish description, so I am hesitant to upload any without help from Turkish speaker(s) to verify they are indeed relevant. --Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus| reply here\n\nA few more editors are needed to complete the A-Class review for Junayd of Aydın; please stop by and help review the article!

It would be useful to readers if these links directed them to the specific pages of interest, rather than making them search through a list. Members of WikiProject Disambiguation have been working on this and the total number is now below 20,000 for the first time. Some of these links require specialist knowledge of the topics concerned and therefore it would be great if you could help in your area of expertise.\n\nA list of the relevant links on pages which fall within the remit of this wikiproject can be found at http://69.142.160.183/~dispenser/cgi-bin/topic_points.py?banner=WikiProject_Turkey\n\nPlease take a few minutes to help make these more useful to our readers.— Rod talk\n\nAn article of this WikiPoject's interest —Kavurma—has been proposed for merging with another article.

It's an event organized by Rossella Vignola (OBC), there is a list of articles to improve also on English wikipedia.--Alexmar983 (talk)\n\nThe reason I am contacting you is because there are one or more portals that fall under this subject, and the Portals WikiProject is currently undertaking a major drive to automate portals that may affect them.\n\nPortals are being redesigned.\n\nThe new design features are being applied to existing portals.\n\nAt present, we are gearing up for a maintenance pass of portals in which the introduction section will be upgraded to no longer need a subpage. In place of static copied and pasted excerpts will be self-updating excerpts displayed through selective transclusion, using the template {{Transclude lead excerpt}}.\n\nThe discussion about this can be found here.\n\nMaintainers of specific portals are encouraged to sign up as project members here, noting the portals they maintain, so that those portals are skipped by the maintenance pass. Currently, we are interested in upgrading neglected and abandoned portals. There will be opportunity for maintained portals to opt-in later, or the portal maintainers can handle upgrading (the portals they maintain) personally at any time.\n\nBackground\n\nOn April 8th, 2018, an RfC (\"Request for comment\") proposal was made to eliminate all portals and the portal namespace. On April 17th, the Portals WikiProject was rebooted to handle the revitalization of the portal system. On May 12th, the RfC was closed with the result to keep portals, by a margin of about 2 to 1 in favor of keeping portals.\n\nThere's an article in the current edition of the Signpost interviewing project members about the RfC and the Portals WikiProject.\n\nSince the reboot, the Portals WikiProject has been busy building tools and components to upgrade portals.\n\nSo far, 84 editors have joined.\n\nIf you would like to keep abreast of what is happening with portals, see the newsletter archive.\n\nIf you have any questions about what is happening with portals or the Portals WikiProject, please post them on the WikiProject's talk page.\n\nThank you. — The Transhumanist\n\nPlease help me save this one!--Kintetsubuffalo (talk)\n\nDear wikipedians, for the last two years now, I have seen the Turkish people article in a complete mess. It is time for the nationalist nonsense to stop (whether pan-Turkish or anti-Turkish). Are there any wikipedians willing to help me write-up an objective article? O.celebi (talk)\n\nThis is an old article created in 2005. Exactly what may be wrong or racist ? Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nTo begin with, the following sentence has been added without any discussion. \"It has been discovered through the Turkish genealogy database that at least 2 million of those who identify as Turks are in reality ethnically Armenian, most of whom were survivors of the Armenian Genocide\" neither of the sources cited claim this. The closest is from the independent article saying \"Perhaps two million Turks have Armenian grandmothers\" at the very end. Robert Fisk is not a historian or demographer nor does he have access to Turkish Geneology data and yet an offhand comment is being deliberately misrepresented as fact. Bertan92 (talk)\n\nHi All - newbie alert! :) Earlier today I reviewed/edited (by way of the WP:ASE list, not because I'd claim any expertise in the subject) a couple of small articles on Turkish villages, and noticed that in both cases the time zone in the infobox was shown as EET (winter) / EEST (summer). AFAIK, Turkey is now year-round on the FET. Assuming I'm right, and further assuming that this is something that needs to be corrected in a number of articles, is there an easy way of doing it (say, a tame bot?) without a lot of manual editing? Or if not, could this be added as a project task (if it isn't already)? Cheers, DoubleGrazing (talk)\n\nI don't think we need a bot to accomplish the task. In the past we also had a term when the summer time was used during the winter. This was a temporary practice and it was soon abandoned. No need to hurry. Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\n@Nedim Ardoğa: Are you suggesting that Turkey's current FET observance is temporary also? If so, what do you base this on? And as to whether we need to 'hurry' or not, I'm not saying correcting the time zone references should be anyone's top priority, just flagging up an issue that needs addressing at some point (unless you're right, and the country reverts to its earlier time zones). DoubleGrazing (talk)\n\nIt probably is. Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nThis is the third time I am writing this. Hopefully it does not get ignored this time. The following sentence has been added to the Turkish people lead without any discussion. \"It has been discovered through the Turkish genealogy database that at least 2 million of those who identify as Turks are in reality ethnically Armenian, most of whom were survivors of the Armenian Genocide\". Neither of the sources cited for this sentence claim this. The Al-monitor article does not mention any type of statistics. The closest is from the independent article saying \"Perhaps two million Turks have Armenian grandmothers\" at the very end. This is made by Robert Fisk. Robert Fisk is not a historian or demographer nor does he have access to Turkish Genealogy data and yet an offhand comment made by a journalist is being presented as though it is the result of an investigation into Turkish genealogy data.\n\nI believe this is an edit made in bad faith as the note on the page history is \"expanded the lead a bit...\" left by a user who regularly engages in aggressive edit feuds with other users. Bertan92 (talk)\n\nWhy don't you make the necessary corrections ? Nedim Ardoğa (talk)\n\nLooks like somebody has. I still think it doesn't belong in the article. It's an offhand claim made by a random journalist. Can we look into banning the user who made the edit. There are so many violations in this one edit it's not even funny.Bertan92 (talk)\n\nHi! I had a student in one of my Wiki Education courses tell me that some of the content in the article on Özgür Dengiz was plagiarized from the sources in the article.

Please review and let me know if you believe these moves need a revert. User:Ammarpad had requested a revert of move at WP:RMT which I have completed. Please let me know if more need to be done. regards. --DBigXrayᗙ\n\n@DBigXray: Thanks for your attention. It seems that this user is trying to rename some articles with Turkish-language name into their spelling in Greek-language, which is not necessary. Because, the original spelling is Turkish and Greek spelling is its derivative. All moves can be reverted. CeeGee\n\nCeeGee, Thanks for reviewing them, I will start reverting these moves. If there is any move that you feel is appropriate ( due to a more common English name) please let me know by pointing it here. Doltjank This discussion thread is for your information. Please see WP:RM and follow the procedure, if you want to make any controversial page move in future. regards. --DBigXrayᗙ\n\nDone some of the moves, that seemed in-appropriate to me.
