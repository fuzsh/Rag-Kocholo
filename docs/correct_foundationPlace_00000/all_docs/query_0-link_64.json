        "text": "This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nMore than just a ragtag group of bearded weirdos assembled for a family portrait in Albuquerque, this gaggle of amazingly retro folks is responsible for creating Microsoft.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaybe you spotted a precocious Bill Gates in the lower left? Look at that killer head of hair!\n\nThe photo was taken just before the then-startup left Albuquerque for Seattle. Unsurprisingly, Microsoft couldn't find anyone willing to move to New Mexico.\n\nThey've all done pretty well for themselves.\n\nThis story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Have an account? .\n\nEarly employee Bob Greenberg, pictured in the middle, won the free portrait after calling in to a radio show and guessing the name of an assassinated president. The gang gathered together in some of their finest late-'70s attire, and an American business legend was born.\n\nMost of us know what happened with the two guys in the bottom left and bottom right corners — Bill Gates, and Paul Allen. But what about the rest? Let's dig in!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJay Yarow contributed to an earlier version of this story.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBill Gates is now giving away the billions he made from Microsoft\n\nWe all know what happened with this guy: Bill Gates founded and built Microsoft from nothing into the most valuable technology company in the world. Along the way he amassed a fortune, which he's now giving away to all sorts of good causes through the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nAndrea Lewis became a fiction writer and freelance journalist\n\nAndrea Lewis was the only person at the company that was from Albuquerque. She was a technical writer for Microsoft, which meant she wrote documents explaining Microsoft's software. She left Microsoft in 1983, eventually becoming a freelance journalist and fiction writer. Thanks in part to her Microsoft options, her net worth was estimated at $2 million by the AP.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaria Wood sued Microsoft just two years later\n\nMaria Wood was a book keeper for Microsoft, and married to another one of the early Microsofties in the picture. She left the company just two years later, suing it for sexual discrimination. Microsoft settled the case. After that, she raised her children and became a volunteer.\n\nPaul Allen has spent his billions on sports teams, startups, and much more\n\nAfter Bill Gates, Paul Allen is the most famous guy in the group. Allen, the other Microsoft cofounder, is the 21st richest person in the world, according to Forbes. He's the owner of the Portland Trailblazers, the Seattle Seahawks, one of the biggest yachts in the world, and much more. Sadly, he no longer has a totally rad beard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBob O'Rear went on to be a cattle rancher\n\nBob O'Rear was one of the most elderly employees at Microsoft when it was founded. He was at NASA in Mission Control when the US landed on the moon. At Microsoft he was a chief mathematician, and is credited with reworking code in DOS, and getting it onto IBM PCs. He left the company in 1983, moved back to his home state of Texas, and did some cattle ranching. His worth is estimated at $100 million, and he sits on the board of a few local businesses.\n\nBob Greenberg left Microsoft, then worked on the Cabbage Patch Kids\n\nBob Greenberg was the guy who won a radio call-in contest to get the photo. He left Microsoft in 1981, after helping the company develop a new version of BASIC (an early programming language). When he left the company, he went on to help his family's company, Coleco, develop the Cabbage Patch Kid dolls, which became a huge hit. More recently, he's said to have worked on golf course software. He's still got the same characteristic grimace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarc McDonald left Microsoft because it was getting big, but ended up back at the company anyway\n\nMarc McDonald was the first salaried employee, and when he left in 1984 it was because he didn't like how big the company was getting. After leaving Microsoft, he went to another Paul Allen company: Asymetrix. He then went to Seattle design company Design Intelligence, which was acquired by Microsoft in 2000. So, he ended up back at Microsoft! According to the AP, he has said he is worth less than $1 million.\n\nGordon Letwin stayed with Microsoft longer than anyone other than Bill Gates\n\nGordon Letwin was with the company until 1993, the second-longest run of all the employees pictured (Gates is first). He was a programmer at Microsoft, and quit when he wanted a break from the grind of the company. He has a ranch in Arizona, and has donated money to some environmental causes. His worth is estimated at $20 million or so.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSteve Wood went on to found Wireless Services Corp.\n\nSteve Wood is the husband of Maria Wood, who eventually left Microsoft under bad circumstances. Steve left in 1980, but worked with Paul Allen on a few companies. He founded Wireless Services Corp., a mobile messaging company, in 1996. It's been renamed SinglePoint, and he's now the chairman. He and his wife's net worth is pegged at around $15 million.\n\nBob Wallace was a fan of psychedelic drugs and founded a software company after Microsoft\n\nBob Wallace seems like he was one of the most far-out early Microsoft employees. He spent time and money researching psychedelic drugs after leaving the company. He also founded a software company called Quicksoft. He died in 2002 from pneumonia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJim Lane went on to do his own software company\n\nJim Lane was a project manager who left in 1985, reportedly saying Microsoft \"beat the enthusiasm out of me.\" He went on to start his own software company. At Microsoft he helped with the early partnership with Intel.\n\nHere's one more look at the gang from 1978...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd here's a photo of them from 2008 that Microsoft put together when Bill Gates left the company\n\nRead next\n\nSign up to get the inside scoop on today’s biggest stories in markets, tech, and business — delivered daily.
