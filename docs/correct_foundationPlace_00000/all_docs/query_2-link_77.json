The Foundation’s overall role is to secure funding resources from foundations, corporations, and individuals for which funds are not available from federal, state, and local public sources to distribute to Media Arts. The Foundation’s multilevel fundraising events and capital programs will ensure the schools continued growth and advancement.\n\nOur History\n\nThe New Mexico Academy for the Media Arts was created by a group of visionaries who share a passion for the media arts.\n\nMedia Arts is the first, state-chartered public school by the State of New Mexico Public Education Department. Media Arts opened in September 2008 with 9th and 10th grades, and is now at full capacity with grades 6 – 12. As a public charter school, the Media Arts focus is rigorous high school academics wrapped with electives exclusively in the Media Arts. The school offers Film & TV Production, Film History, Documentary Film, Journalism, Business of Media, Animation, Screenwriting, 3-D Modeling, Game Development, Web Design, Photography, Media Literacy, Visual Art, Graphic Design and Web Design, as well as content courses that meet high school graduation requirements and entrance into colleges and universities.\n\nMedia Arts is also proud to offer a vibrant Dual Credit enrollment with CNM, UNM and IAIA. Internship opportunities with the Media Industry offer additional elective credits. All of these unique learning opportunities are what afford Media Arts a high profile, sought-after school for public attendance.\n\nMedia Arts provides an integrated, inclusive curriculum through hands-on experiential learning that satisfies New Mexico standards for graduation from secondary schools. We seek to prepare students for an education in the media arts at the university and community college level, as well as to prepare all students to understand the role of Media Arts in the world and how people’s lives can be affected by them. Our mission stems from the need to provide an education that recognizes the extensive influence the media has on our children and society. Our vision is for Media Arts to contribute sustainability to the growth the state of New Mexico is experiencing in the film and television industries through new generations of New Mexico residents, with marketable skills playing important creative roles in these industries.\n\nMedia Arts is designed to deliver a media arts education previously unavailable to high school students in New Mexico. The Mission Statement declares MACCS will:\n\nprepare students for an education in the media arts at the university and community college levels, as well as to prepare all students to understand the role of the media arts in the world and how people’s lives are affected by them.\n\nAll core subject areas are collaboratively integrated with media arts. Students will work to create digital films, study journalism, produce television and radio programs, design web pages, and create short animated movies, instructed and supervised by professionals in these fields. They will assist in creating Community Outreach Media Projects on issues of interest to the school and local community, and engage in an Internship program with media industry professionals. Media Arts students will enjoy full access to a television studio to produce media for the public as part of their course work. Our goal is to give New Mexico youth the opportunity to work as directors, cinematographers, professional animators and journalists here in New Mexico.\n\nThe Media Arts educational method is an outcome-based model designed to allow students to advance in an individual program of study based upon their needs and interests. Each student will collaborate with a team of teachers, mentors and parents to map out classes and to assess progress.\n\nPerformance Framework Goals\n\nAwards\n\nMedia Arts and its students have received significant recognition:\n\nMedia Arts has received 12 Rocky Mountain Emmy Awards.\n\nMedia Arts was the only public school to be named to its list of the city’s top schools by ABQ the Magazine.\n\nOver 30 National Geographic’s “Future Voices of New Mexico Photography Contest” student work placed in the “Best Overall Photo” Category.\n\nNational Stock Market Game/Competition – Media Arts students took third place out of over 10,000 teams.\n\nMicrosoft’s Robo Rave – Media Arts students took third and fourth place, beating out many schools that focus on science.\n\nStudent work won recognition or top-place honors in several local independent film festivals, such as the Laugh Out Loud Comedy Fest and the Digital Deserts Film Festival.\n\nThe City of Albuquerque awarded Media Arts the Creative Bravos Award in 2012.\n\nMedia Arts Earns a Third Consecutive Five-Year Charter Renewal from the PEC\n\n2023 NM Spotlight School for Grade Level Proficiency.\n\nAffiliates\n\nMedia Arts is proud to hold membership or affiliation with the following non-profit agencies:"
