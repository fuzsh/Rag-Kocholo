The company was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975 with the original mission of having “a computer on every desk and in every home, running Microsoft software.” Since then, Microsoft has grown to become the third most valuable brand in the world through strategic marketing and aggressive growth tactics. Microsoft’s first significant success occurred in the early 1980s with the creation of the DOS operating system for IBM computers. The company used this initial success with IBM to sell software to other manufacturers, quickly making Microsoft a major player in the industry. Initial advertising efforts focused on communicating the company’s range of products from DOS to the launch of Excel and Windows—all under a unified “Microsoft” look. Microsoft went public in 1986 and grew tremendously over the next decade as the Windows operating system and Microsoft Office took off. In 1990, Microsoft launched a completely revamped version of its operating system and named it Windows 3.0. Windows 3.0 offered an improved set of Windows icons and applications like File Manager and Program Manager that are still used today. It was an instant success; Microsoft sold more than 10 million copies of the software within two years—a phenomenon in those days. In addition, Windows 3.0 became the first operating system to be preinstalled on certain PCs, marking a major milestone in the industry and for Microsoft. Throughout the 1990s, Microsoft’s communication efforts convinced businesses that its software was not only the best choice for business but also that it needed to be upgraded frequently. Microsoft spent millions of dollars in magazine advertising and received endorsements from the top computer magazines in the industry, making Microsoft Windows and Office the must-have software of its time. Microsoft successfully launched Windows 95 in 1995 and Windows 98 in 1998, using the slogan, “Where Do You Want to Go Today?” The slogan didn’t push individual products but rather the company itself, which could help empower companies and consumers alike. During the late 1990s, Microsoft entered the notorious “browser wars” as companies struggled to find their place during the Internet boom. In 1995, Netscape launched its Navigator browser over the Internet. Realizing what a good product Netscape had, Microsoft launched the first version of its own browser, Internet Explorer, later that same year. By 1997, Netscape held a 72 percent share and Explorer an 18 percent share. Five years later, however, Netscape’s share had fallen to 4 percent. During those five years, Microsoft took three major steps to overtake the competition. First, it bundled Internet Explorer with its Office product, which included Excel, Word, and PowerPoint. Automatically, consumers who wanted MS Office became Explorer users as well. Second, Microsoft partnered with AOL, which opened the doors to 5 milli ...\n\nPlease read the information and give me a brief respondThe mo.docx\n\nPlease read the information and give me a brief respondThe mo.docxmattjtoni51554\n\nPlease read the information and give me a brief respond: The most important concepts for me begin with the differences in certain Philosophies, and understanding that just as their are differences in each individual there is diversity in their methods and strategies when doing business. To accept the different choices also gives you an idea of which type of people and organization you will work well with and those you decide not to work with. When making decisions that involve my community and family I need you to have similar values and good moral standings that encourage you to put others first. To be aware of the harm you may cause if not considerate of everyone. I will not work with those that have a different agenda orthat cannot leave their self interest behind. Social responsibility will come into play with every decision that I make. We are not alone in this world and to respect the people the laws and environment is a substantial commitment. I would expect everyone to live with morals and decent values in whatever capacity of employment that you are involved in and everywhere you travel. I would also hope that this generation will be more accepting of individuals with disabilities and challenges that they are not familiar with. Environmental awareness will be my strong point in establishing a service that supports the air, land and water, We need to preserve our elements for our future generations to come. In whatever feild you choose to be employed in there will always be some method of preservation, because it begins at home. The most difficult ethical issues of the future in my opinion will be preservation of privacy and identy saving. With so many methods of communication and gadgets in technology , there will always be individuals trying to hack into a data system , if no more than to prove that it can bedone. Most gadgets require passwords and personal information just to sign on to them. Stealing private information and details will continue to get more difficult to contain.

One reason Microsoft’s fell and flattened in the 2000s was that it saw its mission differently. Protecting its existing portfolio, Microsoft largely failed to commercialize any category-defining products or services. Why? The answer: Microsoft’s strategy process killed innovation! Top-Down Strategy Process Killed Bottom-Up Strategic Initiatives at Microsoft Microsoft actually came up with some major break- throughs, but failed to successfully commercialize them. The root of the problem seemed to lie with Microsoft’s top-down strategy process. Once Win- dows became the industry standard in 1990, Micro- soft’s strategy was defensive: Any new product or extension had to strengthen the existing Windows- Office franchise; if not, it would be “killed.” Here are some great products and services that Microsoft invented, but never commercialized. SINCE MICROSOFT LAUNCHED Windows 3.0 in 1990, it has dominated the industry for PC operating system (OS) software with a 90 percent market share. Microsoft’s huge installed base of Windows operating systems on PCs and its long-term relationships with original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), such as Dell, HP, and Lenovo, create tremendous entry bar- riers for newcomers. Intel’s semiconductor chips are the perfect complement to Microsoft’s operating sys- tem. Every time Microsoft releases a new operating system, demand for Intel’s latest microprocessor goes up, because new operating systems require more com- puting power. Because of the complementary nature of their products, Microsoft’s and Intel’s alternating advances have created a virtuous cycle, benefiting from network effects. The successful combination of Microsoft’s Windows and Intel’s processors has pro- duced the Wintel (a portmanteau of Windows and Intel) standard in the PC industry. By 1999, Microsoft was the most valuable company on the planet. Fast-forward to 2017, two years after Microsoft released Windows 10, its latest version of the ubiqui- tous operating system. For the past quarter century, Microsoft’s business model was to establish and main- tain the dominance of the Wintel standard in the PC industry. With this standard, Microsoft made money off consumer and business application software such as its Office Suite. Microsoft remains hugely profitable: With some $85 billion in annual revenues in 2016, it generated over $20 billion in profits! Windows and Office still generate about 40 percent of Microsoft’s total revenues and 75 percent of profits. The gross margin of “classic” Office is 90 percent, while the new cloud- based Office 365 only has a 50 percent profit margin. Although Microsoft ...\n\nIn this write up, the following should be covered In September 2008.pdf\n\nIn this write up, the following should be covered In September 2008.pdfsanjeevbansal1970\n\nIn this write up, the following should be covered: In September 2008, Microsoft executives weighed alternatives for improving the company's position in the market for Internet searches and related advertising. Jay Girotto, a member of Microsoft's search team for three years, described the situation: Microsoft got serious about search five years ago. Since then, we've made great strides in technology and marketing, but we're still a distant third behind Google. We're chasing Google's taillights, and we're losing money as we do so. We can keep battling Google feature by feature and advertiser by advertiser, and we will. But my division leader Satya Nadellathe senior vice president who leads Microsoft's search, portal, and advertising platforms - also wants us to consider radical moves, real game changers, to catch and pass Google. One potential game changer was Microsoft's bid this year to buy Yahoo, the \\#2 player in the market. It's now clear, however, that the deal is not going to go through. So Satya is looking for new options to tackle one of the toughest competitive threats that Microsoft has ever faced. Microsoft in 2008 The firm confronting this challenge was, by any financial measure, one of the world's strongest companies. In June 2008, Microsoft closed its fiscal year with cash and short-term investments of nearly $24 billion, revenue of $60 billion, and operating cash flow of almost $22 billion. 1 Since its founding by Bill Gates and Paul Allen in 1975, Microsoft had grown to sell a complex line of software, services, and hardware. Exhibit 1 shows the company's product line as well as the revenue and operating income that flowed from each part of Microsoft's business in 2008. Operating Systems The historical heart of Microsoft was its line of operating systems for personal computers (PCs). Microsoft's entry into operating systems came in 1980, when Gates learned that IBM, long the dominant maker of mainframe computers, would soon launch a PC. IBM trailed a series of small PC makers into the market and, to catch up, planned to build its PC around a set of open standards that others could emulate and build on. IBM came to Gates looking for someone to build a PC operating system (OS) - the core software component that coordinates a computer's activities. Gates initially recommended that IBM go to another company that already produced an OS. When negotiations with that company fell through, IBM returned to Gates and asked Microsoft to write an OS for the PC. Gates purchased an existing OS from another company for $50,000, modified it to meet IBM's needs, named the product MS-DOS, and sold IBM the rights to use the software for $80,000. Believing that others would soon adopt IBM's standards, Gates insisted on retaining the copyright to MS-DOS. During the 1980s, IBM's standards and MS-DOS came to dominate a rapidly growing market for PCs, but IBM itself stumbled as a host of \"clone\" makers took over the PC market. By 1990, clone makers su.\n\nHow ActiveCampaign Can Grow Your Business.pptx\n\nHow ActiveCampaign Can Grow Your Business.pptxRakesh Jalan\n\nSlide 1: Title Slide Title: How ActiveCampaign Can Grow Your Business?
