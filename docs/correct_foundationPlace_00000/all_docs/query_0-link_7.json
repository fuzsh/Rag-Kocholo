        "text": "Tuesday, November 14, 2006 5:00 PM\n\nALBUQUERQUE, NM – Albuquerque and The New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science (NMMNHS) will soon be home to a new permanent exhibit -- STARTUP: Albuquerque and the Personal Computer Revolution. STARTUP will be the first museum exhibit dedicated to the history of the microcomputer and the software and hardware innovations that revolutionized the modern world. The exhibit will open to the public on November 18th, giving visitors of all ages an inspiring, hands-on look at the world of computing and its origins in the great American Southwest.\n\nBorn from the desire of philanthropist and Microsoft co-founder Paul G. Allen to give back to the Albuquerque community where he and Bill Gates spent their early professional years starting Microsoft, STARTUP: Albuquerque and the Personal Computer Revolution at NMMNHS will take visitors through important technological and cultural developments that have transformed society - from the development of the Altair (the first commercially successful microcomputer) in Albuquerque, to the ubiquitous role that computers play in modern life. A series of exhibit segments, videos and interactive elements will comprise the 4,000 square foot gallery, which is located just off the atrium at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science in Albuquerque, 15 minutes from the historic site where Paul Allen and Bill Gates launched Microsoft.\n\n“The role and impact of personal computers and technology in science and culture, as is told in the STARTUP Gallery, is a perfect story to be told by the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science as the personal computer revolution started in Albuquerque,” said Dr. Adrian Hunt, Executive Director of the Museum.\n\nThe STARTUP Gallery at NMMNHS brings to life the sense of possibility and excitement that characterized the early days of the personal computing revolution; it invites visitors to examine what role computers play in their lives, science, and culture; and encourages them to pursue their own creative breakthroughs and endeavors. Through its exhibits, related educational components, interactive games and an object theater, the gallery interweaves historic events with stories of dedication, creativity, collaboration, problem-solving and the entrepreneurial spirit that transformed computers, software and the role of technology in our lives – chronicling the people, places and events that released the exclusive power of computing to a fervent public.\n\n“The STARTUP exhibit is marking an important milestone in Albuquerque’s history and further solidifying the city’s growing status in the technology world,” said Dale Lockett, President/CEO of the Visit Albuquerque. “We look forward to welcoming visitors from around the world to this outstanding new interactive museum gallery.”\n\nSTARTUP: Albuquerque and the Personal Computer Revolution was conceived and generously funded by Paul G. Allen and Jo Allen Patton. Additional support for the gallery was provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Microsoft, and the New Mexico Museum of Natural History Foundation. Opening events and programs were funded by presenting sponsor Intel and sponsor Bank of America.\n\nVisit WWW.STARTUPGALLERY.ORG for more details on the exhibit and WWW.ITSATRIP.ORG to learn more about Albuquerque."
