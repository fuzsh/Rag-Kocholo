However, a centralized, vibrant downtown is something he views as an anchor to attract further development in the surrounding areas and Albuquerque as a whole. While Robby has spent much of his adult-life elsewhere, he has always viewed Albuquerque as home and is very glad to be back. He hopes to be able to provide experience and perspective in any way to further advance the work that is already underway to make our city even more vibrant.\n\njulia youngs\n\nJulia (She/her) is born and raised in Albuquerque and defines her life’s work at the intersection of people and place, with a vision for thriving, equitable, creative communities for all.
