        "meta_description": "Listen to this episode from Bill Gates : Audio Biography on Spotify. This is the Bill Gates Audio Biography.William Henry Gates the 3rd or as he is more commonly known, Bill Gates was born on October 28, 1955 in Seattle, Washington. His father, William H. Gates Sr., was a prominent lawyer, and his mother, Mary Maxwell Gates, served on the board of directors for First Interstate BancSystem and the United Way of America. Gates showed an early interest in computer programming and was enrolled in the Lakeside School, an exclusive preparatory school where he had access to a computer in 1968 at the age of 13.Gates became fascinated with programming the GE system in BASIC and was excused from math classes to pursue his interest. He wrote his first computer program on this machine: a implementation of tic-tac-toe that allowed users to play games against the computer. Gates was fascinated by the machine and how it would always execute software code perfectly.In 1973, Gates entered Harvard University, where he lived down the hall from Steve Ballmer, who would later become CEO of Microsoft. While at Harvard, Gates developed a version of the programming language BASIC for the first microcomputer - the MITS Altair.In his junior year, Gates left Harvard after reading about the Altair microcomputer in Popular Electronics magazine. He contacted Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems (MITS) to inform them that he and others were working on a BASIC software interpreter for the platform. In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair to work with or the code to run on it. But when MITS asked for a demonstration, Gates and Allen developed the software on a Harvard computer and raced to Albuquerque to show that it worked on an Altair.Impressed, MITS hired Gates and Paul Allen as the primary software developers for the Altair. They officially established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as the CEO. Early on, all employees had broad responsibility for the company’s business. Gates oversaw the business details but continued to write code as well.In 1980, IBM approached Microsoft about creating an operating system for its upcoming personal computer, the IBM PC. Though referred to as the IBM PC predominantly in retrospect, IBM originally intended to refer to it simply as the IBM Personal Computer. However, Gates ultimately convinced IBM that the software should not be proprietary, and it could be separately marketed to all PC clone manufacturers.Microsoft purchased an operating system called 86-DOS from Seattle Computer Products. Renamed to PC-DOS, it became the predominant operating systems for PCs into the 1990s. As the PC industry took off and new companies like Compaq introduced IBM PC clones that ran MS-DOS software, Microsoft's fortunes soared from $3 million in revenue in 1978 to $403 million in revenue by 1986.Meanwhile, Paul Allen was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in 1982 and left Microsoft that same year following treatment. Bill Gates took over full operational control of the company and held it until 2000 when he resigned as CEO and became Chief Software Architect.In 1985, Microsoft began shipping a software suite called Microsoft Office that bundled word processing, spreadsheet, and other business applications. It quickly came to dominate the personal computer software market. In 1986, Microsoft launched its IPO, which made Bill Gates an instant billionaire at age 31.Throughout the 1990s, Microsoft dominated the personal computing industry through its Windows operating systems and Office software. Windows 95, released in 1995, became a tremendous success and helped usher the internet into broad popularity. Riding on the success of Windows 95 and pent up demand for Microsoft’s products, the company’s stock price skyrocketed to nearly $60 a share.By 2000, spurred in part by the success of the iPhone and declining PC sales, Microsoft began to change its approach in order to compete in a landscape shifting increasingly toward mobile devices. Gates transferred his day-to-day activities at Microsoft to Ray Ozzie and Steve Ballmer, who had been the company president since 1998. Gates’ last full-time day at Microsoft was June 27, 2008. After that, he remained as chairman and also served as an advisor on key development projects.In 2000, Gates and his wife Melinda founded the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which was dedicated to funding international health programs as well as educational programs in the U.S. As of 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates were the second-most generous philanthropists in America, having given over $28 billion to charity through the foundation.In 2006, Gates announced that over the course of two years he would transition out of his day-to-day role at Microsoft to dedicate more time to philanthropy. On June 27, 2008, Gates retired from day-to-day responsibilities at Microsoft so he could devote himself full-time to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. He did retain a position on Microsoft’s Board of Directors, however.Over several years, Gates gradually sold or donated much of his Microsoft stock, funding the foundation to the point where its endowment stood at $46.8 billion by late 2018. With Warren Buffett donating $30 billion of his own fortune to the Gates Foundation in July 2006, its endowment had risen to $60 billion by early 2019.Now in his sixties, Bill Gates continues focusing on advancing solutions to some of the world's most pressing problems through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. The foundation is focused on improving world health and education, especially for those in extreme poverty. Some areas of current interest include infectious diseases, agriculture in developing nations, water, sanitation and hygiene, primary education, and programs for mothers and infants.The Foundation is organized into four program areas, Global Development, Global Health, Global Policy & Advocacy, and United States Program. The U.S. Program invests in solutions across all 50 states and partners with innovators to expand opportunity. The Global Development Program works to help the world’s poorest people lift themselves out of hunger and poverty.Global Health is the largest area of spending for the foundation. It harnesses advances in science and technology to save lives in developing countries. This program focuses on discovery, translation and delivery of easily accessible breakthrough interventions like vaccines.The Global Policy & Advocacy Program seeks to build strategic relationships that spur policies benefiting the world’s poor. One priority is agricultural development, which Gates believes is key to reducing poverty in developing countries.More recently, Gates has shifted his attention increasingly toward climate change, calling for accelerated innovation in tools that will help humanity adapt to a warming world. In 2021, he published “How to Avoid a Climate Disaster,” detailing technologies he believes may help humanity achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions.Gates has received many accolades already in his life, including being named one of the Most Influential People in Media by The Hollywood Reporter in 2017. Time Magazine named Gates one of the Most Influential People of the 20th Century in 1999. He was also ranked No.1 in Forbes list of the world's billionaires from 1995 to 2007 and 2009. He has topped the Forbes list of the richest Americans every year since 1995 with a net worth estimated at $103 billion as of December 2018.In 1987, Gates was officially declared a billionaire in the pages of Forbes' 400 Richest People in America issue. At age 31, he was the youngest billionaire ever at the time. In 1999, Gates' wealth briefly surpassed $100 billion, likely the first person to ever achieve that level of wealth. Since 2000, Gates has been one of the richest men in the world almost every single year.As of December 2022, Bill Gates is once again the second richest man in the world with an estimated net worth of $104 billion according to Bloomberg. He is currently about $29 billion behind Bernard Arnault, CEO of luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. Elon Musk occupies the top spot on global rich lists with a",
