        "text": "The history of the personal computer is inextricably linked to the life story of Bill Gates - the boy from Seattle who had the audacious vision of \"a computer on every desk and in every home\".\n\nEARLY INTEREST IN COMPUTERS\n\nAllen and Gates were fascinated by early computers\n\n28 October 1955\n\nBill Gates is born to a wealthy Seattle family. He is the second child of William H Gates II, an attorney, and Mary Gates, a leading charity volunteer.\n\n1968\n\nGates starts at Lakeside, an exclusive private school. He is two years junior to fellow student Paul Allen.\n\nThe Lakeside Mothers' Club buys the school a Teletype machine - a special typewriter that can send electronic messages down a phone line to a primitive computer at the local university.\n\nGates and Allen develop a passion for the machine and frequently sneak into the school at night to write programmes on it.\n\n1972\n\nGates uses the Teletype machine to devise the Lakeside School timetable. It is a complicated job but Gates ensures the girls he finds most attractive are scheduled to be in his classes.\n\nDROPPING OUT\n\nThe 1970s saw a leap forward in computing\n\n1973\n\nGates graduates from Lakeside and starts at Harvard. His primary subject is \"Pre-Law\" but he also takes classes in Mathematics and Economics. He becomes friends with a student living along the hall called Steve Ballmer.\n\nDecember 1974\n\nAn article appears in Popular Electronics magazine about an exciting new \"personal computer\", the Altair 8800, which has been developed by a company called MITS.\n\nIt uses the Intel 8080 microprocessor, making it the world's first mass-produced microcomputer. MITS is inviting readers to develop a programming language for it.\n\nEarly 1975\n\nGates and his old school friend Allen call MITS and claim to have developed a BASIC language interpreter that will work with the Altair. MITS agrees to see it. Gates and Allen work night and day to get the programme ready in time.\n\nSome two-and-a-half thousand miles away in Silicon Valley, California, a loose association of computer \"hobbyists\", called the Homebrew Computer Club, is also taking an interest in the Altair. Among its number are Stephen Wozniak and Steve Jobs.\n\nAllen travels to Albuquerque in New Mexico where MITS is based and successfully demonstrates the version of the programming language BASIC that he and Gates have developed. MITS is delighted and makes Allen vice-president and director of software.\n\nFOUNDING MICROSOFT\n\nGates' future success was tied to his Microsoft company\n\nSummer 1975 - Spring 1976\n\nGates joins Allen in Albuquerque, developing BASIC for the Altair. During this time, they start to refer to their own venture as Micro Soft or Micro-Soft.\n\nFebruary 1976\n\nGates' \"Open Letter to Hobbyists\" is published in the Homebrew Computer Club newsletter. He makes the radical demand that computer enthusiasts respect the copyright of software developers.\n\nSpring 1976\n\nGates returns to Harvard to resume his studies.\n\n1 April 1976\n\nSteve Jobs and Stephen Wozniak, who have formed Apple Computer, launch their first product - the Apple I personal computer.\n\n26 November 1976\n\nGates and Allen register the trademark \"Microsoft\". Their work has become independent of MITS. Gates has given up his Harvard studies altogether, and he and Allen are taking on staff.\n\nDecember 1978\n\nMicrosoft's revenues exceed $1m.\n\n1 January 1979\n\nGates and Allen move Microsoft from Albuquerque to their home state of Washington. They open offices in Bellevue, a few miles from where they grew up.\n\n11 June 1980\n\nGates hires his old Harvard friend Steve Ballmer as the company's first business manager.\n\nBREAKTHROUGH DEAL\n\nGates took just over half the company and his pal Allen just under a third\n\nSummer and Autumn 1980\n\nGates agrees to produce the operating system for the personal computer being developed by IBM, the world's leading computer company. Crucially, Microsoft retains the right to license the operating system (MS-DOS) to other computer manufacturers.\n\n1 July 1981\n\nMicrosoft is incorporated. Gates gets 53% of the company; Allen 31% and Ballmer 8%. The initial stock price is 95 cents.\n\n1981\n\nMicrosoft's revenues reach $16m. The company employs 128 people.\n\n1983\n\nAllen is diagnosed with Hodgkin's Disease. Although his treatment is successful, he never returns to full-time work at Microsoft.\n\n1985\n\nMicrosoft's revenue reaches $140m. The company employs 910 staff.\n\nOPENING WINDOWS\n\nHarvard friends Gates and Ballmer have worked together for 28 years\n\n20 November 1985\n\nMicrosoft releases a graphical extension to its MS-DOS operating system. This is the first retail version of Windows.\n\nFebruary 1986\n\nMicrosoft moves to Redmond, a leafy suburb of Seattle. This is where the company's headquarters have been located ever since.\n\n13 March 1986\n\nMicrosoft goes public. On the first day of trading, the share price rises from $21 to $28.\n\n1987\n\nA young Texan called Melinda French joins Microsoft as a marketing manager. She and Gates start dating.\n\n18 March 1988\n\nApple files a lawsuit against Microsoft, claiming that the \"look and feel\" of Windows is too similar to the Apple \"graphical user interface\". The legal battle is to last six years and Apple eventually loses.\n\n1989\n\nMicrosoft Office is released.\n\n22 May 1990\n\nWindows 3.0 is launched and sells 100 000 copies in two weeks. Microsoft had also been working with IBM on a similar product - called OS/2.\n\n20 August 1990\n\nMicrosoft executives attending a special meeting at the Shumway Mansion decide to abandon OS/2 and focus on Windows 3.0. Headlines later declare that Microsoft and IBM had \"divorced\".\n\nRIVALS HIT BACK\n\nGates faced tough commercial and legal challenges as his wealth soared\n\n1992\n\nSome of Microsoft's competitors start to meet to share concerns about the increasing dominance of Gates' company.\n\nOctober 1992\n\nForbes declares Gates to be the richest man in America, worth $6.3bn.\n\n20 January 1993\n\nMicrosoft's market value overtakes that of computer giant IBM.\n\n5 February 1993\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission is deadlocked when it meets to rule on whether Microsoft has broken anti-trust rules. The matter is referred to the Justice Department in August.\n\n20 March 1993\n\nOn his way back from Palm Springs with Melinda French, Gates diverts their private plane to Omaha. Gates' friend, billionaire Warren Buffet, takes them to a jewellery shop he owns. Gates buys French an engagement ring.\n\n1 January 1994\n\nGates marries Melinda French.\n\n9 June 1994\n\nGates' mother, Mary, dies of cancer at the age of 64.\n\n14 October 1994\n\nThe company Netscape offers its Mosaic Navigator as a free download on the internet.\n\nDecember 1994\n\nSpoof stories start circulating that Microsoft has plans to buy the Catholic Church. Microsoft issues a press release denying the story.\n\n5 July 1995\n\nForbes declares Gates the richest man in the world, a position he holds continuously until 2008.\n\nINTERNET DAWNS\n\n26 May 1995\n\nGates reveals the future direction in which he wants to take Microsoft. In his \"Internet Tidal Wave\" memo to senior staff, he says: \"I now assign the internet the highest level of importance.\"\n\nREAD THE DOCUMENT\n\nMost computers will open this document automatically, but you may need Adobe Reader\n\n24 August 1995\n\nWith a lavish publicity drive, Windows 95 and Microsoft's online service MSN are launched.\n\nSeptember 1995\n\nGates takes his second proper holiday in 20 years when he travels to China with his family and close friends.\n\nOctober 1995\n\nWith seven million copies of Windows 95 already sold, Microsoft's profits climb by 58% in a year.\n\n7 December 1995\n\nGates announces Microsoft's internet strategy to the world's press. In his controversial \"Pearl Harbor\" speech, he reveals plans for Microsoft's own internet browser - Explorer.\n\nAugust 1996\n\nMicrosoft releases Internet Explorer 3.0.\n\n1996\n\nNetscape asks the Department of Justice to investigate Microsoft's discount to computer manufacturers that install Internet Explorer 3.0.\n\nMay 1998\n\nThe Department of Justice and the Attorneys General of 20 states sue Microsoft for illegally thwarting competition.\n\n25 June 1998\n\nMicrosoft launches Windows 98.\n\nGates urged Microsoft to ride the internet 'tidal wave' of the 1990s\n\nAugust 1998\n\nGates spends three days giving his deposition by video to the Department of Justice inquiry.\n\nSeptember 1998\n\nGoogle is incorporated by founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin\n\nJanuary 2000\n\nBallmer is appointed chief executive of Microsoft. He and Gates later acknowledge that they both had a difficult time adjusting to their new roles.\n\n7 June 2000\n\nFollowing the Department of Justice inquiry, Judge Jackson rules that Microsoft should be split into two units: one to produce operating systems, the other to make other software components. He calls Microsoft an \"abusive monopoly\".\n\n2000\n\nMicrosoft's revenues reach $229bn. The dot-com crash does not affect it as badly as many other companies in the sector. The company's headcount climbs to over 39,000.\n\nDIGITAL DECADE\n\nBill Gates combined charitable work with continuing to develop Microsoft\n\n2000\n\nThe Gates family launches the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, a charitable organisation intended to \"reduce inequalities in the United States and around the world\". They donate billions of dollars of their own money, and it soon becomes the world's biggest philanthropic organisation.\n\nJune 2001\n\nThe Court of Appeal overturns Judge Jackson's order to break up Microsoft into two corporations. However, it upholds his ruling that Microsoft illegally used licensing agreements with internet service providers and PC manufacturers to freeze out the Netscape internet browser.\n\n25 October 2001\n\nMicrosoft launches Windows XP.\n\n15 November 2001\n\nMicrosoft branches out into the gaming console market with its high-profile launch of the Xbox. This product is a direct competitor to Sony's PlayStation 2 and Nintendo's GameCube.\n\nMarch 2004\n\nThe European Commission brings anti-trust action against Microsoft.\n\nAugust 2004\n\nGoogle's flotation paves the way for a dramatic acceleration in the company's growth: two months later it overtakes Yahoo!'s market capitalisation with a value of $50bn.\n\nJanuary 2005\n\nThe Gates' endowments to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation reach almost $29bn.\n\nNEW FRONTIERS\n\nIn 2008 Gates finally withdrew from the Microsoft front line\n\n15 June 2006\n\nGates announces that he will step back from Microsoft in two years to concentrate on his philanthropic endeavours. He reveals he has a carefully thought-through \"transition\" period planned and that he hopes to remain chairman of the company for life.\n\nJanuary 2007\n\nWindows Vista and Office 2007 are launched.\n\n7 June 2007\n\nGates returns to Harvard to collect an Honorary degree.\n\n1 Feb 2008\n\nMicrosoft makes a bid of $44.6bn for search engine company Yahoo!. For the first time in its history, Microsoft plans to borrow some of the necessary funds. Yahoo! rejects the bid.\n\n27 February 2008\n\nMicrosoft is fined a record 899m euros by the European Commission because of the company's failure to comply with earlier anti-trust rulings. Microsoft is appealing against the fine.\n\nSummer 2008\n\nThe Microsoft headcount is now almost 90,000 worldwide."
