That enthusiasm was on full display at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) Global Health Conference in Orlando last week. These are some of the top announcements made at the conference in terms of their potential impact on health systems:Mayo Clinic launched a program for digital health companies called Solutions Studio to help accelerate the development, validation, and deployment of digital health solutions and integrate them into health care workflows.",

        "text": "Several health system CEOs announced career changes last week, including Peter Banko, who will become president and CEO of Springfield, Mass.-based Baystate Health in June. Banko, who will take over the roles when Dr. Mark Keroack retires, previously served as president of a three-state division of CommonSpirit and as CEO of Centura Health, a long-term joint venture between CommonSpirit and AdventHealth. Separately, Dale Maxwell plans to retire as CEO of Albuquerque, N.M.-based Presbyterian Healthcare Services, effective July 31, and Dr. Craig Lambrecht resigned as CEO of the recently combined Billings Clinic-Logan Health system. A successor for Maxwell, who has been with Presbyterian Healthcare for 24 years, has not been designated. Dr. Clint Seger and Kevin Abel will serve as co-CEOs of the combined Billings Clinic-Logan Health system.\n\nVertical Integration and the Transformation of American Medicine. NEJM, 3.14.24"
