        "text": "Microsoft is an American multinational technology corporation that offers innovative personal computer software and hardware products and services to advance human and organizational achievement.Â\n\nMicrosoft is a household name today and has grown exponentially to become the top producer of computer software, consumer electronics, personal computers, and related services. Hard to believe that it was just a small software company founded in 1975, providing interpreters such as the BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800.\n\nMicrosoftâs market share and key statistics in 2021\n\nRevenue ofÂ $168 billion\n\nOperating Income ofÂ $70 billion\n\nWorkforce ofÂ 181,000Â employees\n\nEarnings per share ofÂ $8.1\n\nInvested more thanÂ $20 billionÂ in Research and Development\n\nStock Price ofÂ $336Â as of Dec 2021\n\nMarket cap ofÂ $2.5 trillion\n\nMarket share ofÂ 73%Â in desktop operation system (OS) worldwide\n\nMarket share ofÂ 85%Â in office suite market\n\nMicrosoftâs 47 years long journey has been an incredible series of strategic breakthroughs, enabling the company to redefine the information technology industry and transform itself over the years to usher in the future.Â\n\nLetâs take a closer look at Microsoftâs tremendous growthâ¦\n\n{{cta('eed3a6a3-0c12-4c96-9964-ac5329a94a27')}}\n\nMicrosoft Cements Itself By Offering Essential Software To Prominent Hardware Manufacturers\n\nBefore Microsoft rose to dominance in the personal computer operating systems market, it was simply known as a business venture started by two friends âÂ Bill GatesÂ andÂ Paul AllenÂ â who were eager to explore computer programming.\n\nBill and Paul were both math and programming prodigies who spent most of their time playing with computers and writing programming codes.\n\nÂ\n\nThe inspiration for starting Microsoft came inÂ 1975Â when Paul Allen suggested to Gates that they program aÂ BASIC interpreterÂ for theÂ Altair 8800Â developed byÂ MITS; thereby enabling users to enter and run programs in the BASIC language.\n\nFollowing the successful development and demonstration of the interpreter which was marketed by MITS asÂ Altair BASIC, Gates and Allen moved to Albuquerque and, inÂ April 1975, co-foundedÂ Micro-SoftÂ - short for micro-computer software.Â\n\nIt was not until 1979 that Bill Gates used the termÂ MicrosoftÂ to refer to the company, and since then, it has become the official name that is renowned all over the world.\n\nMicrosoft Signs A Strategic Contract To Develop Essential Software\n\nIn 1980, Microsoft formed its first crucial partnership withÂ International Business Machines (IBM),Â which entailed creating an operating system for the in-developmentÂ IBM Personal Computer (PC).Â\n\nAlthough Microsoft had already been working on developing the BASIC programming language for the IBM PC, it had not yet developed an operating system. Nevertheless, Microsoft capitalized on the opportunity since it knew that Seattle Computer Products (SCP) had developed an operating system calledÂ QDOS (Quick-and-Dirty Operating System)Â which could be refined to suit the IBM PC.Â\n\nThus, in July 1981, Microsoft purchased full rights from the SCP for their operating system and further developed it for the IBM PC, which was scheduled to ship in a few weeks. Although the name of the operating system on the IBM PC was theÂ IBM PC-DOSÂ it was wholly developed by Microsoft.Â\n\nAround the same time, the company became a privately held corporation and moved to Bellevue, Washington as it was hard to recruit top programmers to Albuquerque.\n\nMicrosoft Leverages Its Operating System To PC Manufacturers\n\nIn its contract with IBM, Microsoft had included a clause that allowed it to sell the operating system it had developed to other companies under the name ofÂ MS-DOS. The move paved the way for Microsoft to become the dominant technology company of the PC era.\n\nBefore he dropped out to dedicate his full attention to Microsoft, Gates was studying Law at Harvard. He made sure that while the contract between Microsoft and IBM allowed the hardware developer to use and market the software, Microsoft retained ownership of the language.\n\nBy 1983, large computer manufacturers who had developed computers similar to IBM standards began using MS-DOS as their operating system. PCs were now being seen as more than just toys, they were serious business tools.Â\n\nConsequently, at the end of the year, with the growth of the PC market, MS-DOS sold aroundÂ 500,000 copies. These sales boosted the companyâsÂ annual revenue to $69 millionÂ (around today after adjusting for inflation).\n\nMicrosoft Develops Its Range Of Office ProductsÂ\n\nDuring the 1980s, Microsoft developed its most prominent office products and eventually introduced the highly successfulÂ Microsoft Office.\n\nGates was aware of the need for a more user-friendly word program which led to the development ofÂ Microsoft Word. The initial product lacked ease of learning, but Gates was adamant about doing market research and strengthening the softwareâs weak points.\n\nIn April 1986,Â Word 3.0Â was released, which became the companyâs best seller. However, Gates had already set his eyes on developing a version of Word for Appleâs Macintosh computer.Â\n\nSales of this version amounted to 20,000 copies each month and by this point, Microsoft had annual sales ofÂ $590 millionÂ (around today after adjusting for inflation) andÂ employed 2,800 people.Â\n\nGates also sought to offer advanced spreadsheet software which led to the development ofÂ ExcelÂ for the Macintosh (as Lotus 1-2-3 had already become the standard for IBM). By early 1986, Excel dominated the Macintosh spreadsheet market.\n\nAlthough half of the companyâs profit came from the sales of DOS, Word, and Excel cemented Microsoftâs status as the biggest producer and supplier of software for Macintosh.Â\n\nIn August 1989, the company introduced Microsoft Office - its most successful office product. The office was a bundle of separate, internally developed office productivity applications such as Word and Excel along with rebranded products from their companies such asÂ Microsoft SQL Server.\n\nMicrosoft Office eventually became the dominant business suite with its market share considerably exceeding that of its competitors.Â\n\nKey Takeaway 1: Locate the fundamental source of value and conquer it\n\nMicrosoft understood that controlling the operating system was more important as the underlying hardware became irrelevant since it could be cloned by other companies.Â\n\nThe company recognized the true potential of its product and thus introduced the clause that allowed it to sell the DOS to other companies in the IBM contract. Doing so, provided the company with the finances to develop other essential software and ultimately become one of the worldâs leading software developer.Â\n\nMoreover, the contract with a prestigious company like IBM helped to push MS-DOS into prominence and allowed it to dominate the PC operating system market.Â\n\nMicrosoft Embodies A User-First Policy\n\nGates had talked withÂ AppleÂ executives during the creation of theÂ MacintoshÂ and was impressed by its user-friendliness.Â\n\nWhile the IBM PC used letters and numbers to communicate, the Mac had aÂ graphical user interface (GUI)Â that used small pictures called icons to communicate. Users would click on the icons with the cursor and perform tasks.Â\n\nGates firmly believed that the future of computing lay in GUI.Â\n\nMicrosoftâs Success Against Competitors\n\nIn 1990, Microsoft launchedÂ Windows 3.0Â - a new version of its operating system with features such as streamlined GUI and improved protected mode ability. The company sold overÂ 100,000 copies within two weeks.\n\nDespite complaints that Windows 3.0 required advanced hardware to run at an acceptable speed, it generated more revenue than the OS/2, which IBM had asked Microsoft to develop.Â\n\nThus, Microsoft decided to shift its focus entirely to Windows, and so the relationship between the two companies declined. Around the same time, Apple initiated a lawsuit against Microsoft, claiming that it had copied the look and feel of the Mac, thereby committing copyright infringement.Â\n\nAmidst the hostilities, IBM and Apple felt threatened by Microsoftâs emerging control of software and operating systems standards and decided to form an alliance. The fact that two of the industryâs most prolific names would feel threatened by Microsoft was further evidence of its growing influence.Â\n\nNevertheless, by 1993, Windows had become the most widely used GUI operating system in the world. It was also dubbed the â1993 Most Innovative Company Operating in the U.S.â by Fortune Magazine.Â\n\nThe year also saw the lawsuit between Apple and Microsoft come to an end, with the ruling being in Microsoftâs favor.\n\nMicrosoftâs Broad Differentiation Strategy Drives Competitive Advantage\n\nAt the start of theÂ 1990s, Microsoft decided to shift its focus from supplying software to hardware manufacturers toÂ selling directly to consumers.\n\nTargeting consumers was part of Microsoft's strategy toÂ broaden its businessÂ andÂ appeal to non-technical audiences. As such the company developed unique products for various market segments: individuals, households, and organizations.\n\nThe company releasedÂ Microsoft EncartaÂ in 1993 which was the first encyclopedia designed to run on a computer. It also introducedÂ Microsoft HomeÂ which included Microsoftâs newÂ multimedia applications.\n\nIn 1994, the company even undertook aÂ $100 millionÂ advertising campaignÂ and changed its slogan to âWhere do you want to go today?â - hinting at the endless possibilities offered by Microsoft programs and products.\n\nMicrosoft continued to release products targeted at consumers: a successful example beingÂ Windows 95. This was the latest version of Microsoftâs premier operating system featuring anÂ original user interface, including aÂ novel start button.\n\nWindows 95 soldÂ more than a million copiesÂ in theÂ first four days of its release.\n\nThe company continued its momentum and also entered theÂ personal digital assistant (PDA) marketÂ in November with the release ofÂ Windows CE 1.0. The new version of the operating system was designed to be compatible with low-memory, low-performance computer-like devices such as mobile phones, digital cameras, handheld computers, etc.\n\nMicrosoftâs Diversification Strategy Yields Desired Results\n\nA part of Microsoft's diversification strategy was to broaden and expand into businesses associated with its core franchise.\n\nAs the web began to grow in significance and popularity, Microsoft approached a company calledÂ SpyglassÂ to licenseÂ Internet Explorer. The browser was then bundled for free with Windows 95.\n\nMicrosoft also began expanding its product line intoÂ computer networkingÂ and theÂ World Wide Web. As part of this expansion, it launchedÂ MSN (Microsoft Network)Â which encompassed the companyâs entire range of online services.Â\n\nThe most prominent of these online services wasÂ MSNBCÂ - a joint venture with theÂ NBC (National Broadcasting Company)Â that was basically aÂ 24-hour cable news television station.Â\n\nMicrosoftâs Value Proposition Captures User Attention\n\nInÂ 2001, Microsoft released the highly anticipatedÂ Windows XPÂ which included theÂ essential featuresÂ of both itsÂ business and home product line.Â\n\nWindows XP introduced a new GUI - the first after Windows 95. Both the business and personal computers arrived with a full suite of pre-installed Microsoft software. The new operating system was the first to offer a similar user experience regardless of whether it was being used at home or at work.Â\n\nWindows XP has been heralded as one of the greatest achievements of Microsoft and is remembered as one of the key operating system releases of all time. Microsoft was also aware of its significance which is why it invested $250 million in Windows XPâs ad campaign.Â\n\nThe campaign included a wide variety of events and promotions - even including a special concert with Madonna and Sting at the Windows XP launch party. Such strategies successfully captured the attention of the users.Â\n\nKey Takeaway 2: Let Consumer Needs and Feedback guide the development of your products\n\nMuch of Microsoftâs growth in the 1990s was driven by its commitment to adhering to consumer needs.Â\n\nThe development of user-friendly features such as unique GUIs, pre-installed software, and bundling the web browser for free with the operating system all contributed to Microsoftâs appeal to consumers in the market.Â\n\nMicrosoft strategically expanded its business in keeping with the target of directly accessing consumers and designing its product offerings accordingly. By putting the user first, Microsoft was able to develop products with a strong impact in the market and which allowed it to become a leading tech company.\n\n{{cta('eed3a6a3-0c12-4c96-9964-ac5329a94a27')}}\n\nMicrosoft Strategic Focus Aligns With Anticipated Trends\n\nIn the following years, Microsoft continued to update its range of products and expanded the scope of its business to become not just a leading software developer but a tech company with a global impact.Â\n\nToward this end, Microsoft recognized the need to directly compete with companies in the fields it sought to expand in.\n\nMicrosoftâs Product Development Strategy\n\nIn the early 2000s, Microsoft leaned into its product development strategy and introduced its own product offerings in new markets.\n\nMicrosoft launched theÂ XboxÂ and officially entered the game console market which was then dominated byÂ SonyÂ andÂ Nintendo. While the Xbox was relatively successful, theÂ Xbox 360Â was much more so; although, it too could not outsell theÂ PlayStation 3Â - Microsoftâs main rival.Â\n\nFollowing the introduction of the gesture control feature by Wii which opened up a new market for video games, Microsoft developed the controller-free Kinect peripheral to boost Xboxâs popularity.\n\nThe move was highly successful as Kinect was the fastest-selling consumer electronics product in history as of 2011, with sales averaging 133,333 units per day.\n\nIn June 2012, the company unveiled theÂ SurfaceÂ computer which was the first in history to have its hardware made by Microsoft. The very next month, it also launched theÂ Outlook webmail serviceÂ to compete withÂ Gmail.\n\nMicrosoftâs Business Strategy Focuses On Devices And Services\n\nIn 2010, Microsoft laid out its intention to unlock the full value of its software by factoring in how people use devices and services at work and in their personal lives.Â\n\nConsequently, the company was determined to deliver a broad spectrum of Windows PCs, tablets, and phones. Not only was Microsoft going to develop Windows devices but have the relevant services built into them.Â\n\nIn 2012, Microsoft also made incredible updates toÂ OfficeÂ forÂ Windows 8, addingÂ touch and pen capabilitiesÂ andÂ unlocking new experiences for reading, note-taking, meetings, and communications.Â\n\nMicrosoft had already released its cloud computing service,Â Azure, in 2008 which, along withÂ Windows Server 2012Â andÂ System Center,Â made up the companyâs services offerings.Â\n\nThe company is now focused on helping businesses move to the cloud. In 2014, commercial cloud revenue amounted to a $4.4 billion annual run rate, making Microsoft an indisputable leader in the arena.\n\nTo reinforce its device ecosystem and drive its mobile strategy, Microsoft acquiredÂ Nokiaâs Devices and ServicesÂ business in 2014.Â\n\nThis acquisition helped createÂ an expanded Microsoft Devices GroupÂ that includedÂ Nokia phones, Xbox hardware, Surface, Perceptive Pixel products, and accessories.Â\n\nMicrosoftâs Digital Transformation Strategy\n\nAsÂ revenue continued to increaseÂ acrossÂ Microsoftâs cloud services, Windows 10, and Office 365, the company set its sight on aÂ new technology paradigmÂ âÂ digital transformation.Â\n\nWith the onset of digitization across organizations, Microsoft aimed to form strategic partnerships with them by helping them build their digital capability, providing innovative technology to drive new growth, and enabling them to digitize business-critical functions.\n\nIn 2018, Microsoft identified cloud computing as being foundational to enabling digital transformation and stressed Azureâs hybrid consistency, developer productivity, andÂ Software as a Service (SaaS) application integration.\n\nMicrosoft was also aware of the importance of a business's ability to reason over its data using AI to drive competitive advantage. In order to capitalize on this opportunity, Microsoft Research was dedicated to developing AI technologies and democratizing them withÂ Azure Cognitive Services.Â\n\nAzure Cognitive Services has the most comprehensive portfolio of tools, frameworks, and infrastructure that enables users to build applications that see, hear, speak, search, understand, and accelerate decision-making.Â\n\nIn 2019, Microsoft brought hyperscale capabilities to its relational database services and offered the most comprehensive cloud analytics through Azure Data Factory, Azure SQL Data Warehouse, and Power BI.\n\nBy 2020, Microsoft was pushing the bounds of how AI can generalize learning beyond narrow domains. It was collaborating with OpenAI on a supercomputing platform to train and run AI models of unprecedented scale.\n\nKey Takeaway 3: Anticipate trends to gain an unfair advantage\n\nMicrosoft accelerated its growth by anticipating new avenues of technological breakthroughs and developing its products and services accordingly.\n\nIt had previously reorganized its strategy to focus on devices and services and built its capacity in those avenues, thereby developing a unique portfolio to cater to diverse needs.Â\n\nMicrosoft anticipated the growing need for digital transformation amongst businesses and organizations and positioned itself as a strategic partner that allows them to achieve digitization. Doing so allowed Microsoft to capitalize on transformational opportunities as businesses sought out its solutions to help them transition toward digitization.Â\n\nThe strategy paid off as well since the company reported strong financial results.Â\n\nWhy Is Microsoft So Successful?\n\nA significant reason for Microsoftâs resilience and why it has retained a relevant and arguably dominant position in a rapidly evolving industry is due to its financial and intellectual resources.\n\nDespite the changes ushered in by the advent of smartphones and the Android operating system, Microsoft was able to adapt to the changing landscape by making its products available on its competitorsâ devices and platforms. Such moves allow the company to leverage its brand loyalty more effectively.Â\n\nInstead, the company has shifted its focus to capitalize on the market demand for cloud computing. Microsoft's aim is to usher in future technologies by breakthroughs in AI, data management, and quantum computing.\n\nMicrosoftâs intellectual property â patents and proprietary software code â in addition to the companyâs ability to adapt to ever-evolving trends, technologies, and consumer preferences, and willingness to take risks to explore new opportunities make it extremely successful.Â\n\nMicrosoftâs Purpose And Mission StatementÂ\n\nMicrosoft is an innovation-based company that continues to grow with time. Its mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.Â\n\nThe companyâs goal is to foster innovation that generates new ecosystems of inventors, partners, developers, creators, changemakers, public servants, frontline workers, and knowledge workers who drive the engines of growth and opportunity in ways that benefit everyone.\n\nWho Owns Microsoft Today?\n\nMicrosoft is a multinational software company, with its headquarters at the Microsoft Redmond campus located in Redmond, Washington, United States.Â\n\nThe company has a total ofÂ $2.5 trillion market capitalizationÂ as of December 2021.Â\n\nA few of the prominent shareholders of Microsoft are:\n\n1.
