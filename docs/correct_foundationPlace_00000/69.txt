On April 4, 1975, a groundbreaking event took place in Albuquerque, New Mexico, that would shape the future of computing. Bill Gates and Paul Allen founded Microsoft Corporation with a vision to develop and provide software solutions for personal computers, setting the stage for a technological revolution.

Originally, the company was named “Micro-Soft,” a combination of “microcomputer” and “software.” The term “microcomputer” comes from the Greek word “mikros,” meaning small, and “computer” is derived from the Latin word “computare,” meaning to calculate. The word “software” combines “soft,” referring to data and instructions, and “ware,” derived from “hardware.” This name reflected the company’s focus on developing software for microcomputers.

The journey began with the development of programming languages and software for personal computers. One of Microsoft’s early successes was the BASIC interpreter for the Altair 8800 microcomputer. This achievement laid the foundation for Microsoft to become a leading developer of operating systems and productivity software.

Microsoft’s growth was exponential, propelled by key milestones such as the introduction of the Microsoft Windows operating system in 1985. Windows revolutionized personal computing by providing a graphical user interface and became one of the most widely used operating systems worldwide.

Over the years, Microsoft has diversified its product range and acquired numerous companies, solidifying its position as a global leader in technology. Today, it is most renowned for its Microsoft Windows operating system and the Microsoft Office suite, which have become ubiquitous in both personal and professional settings.

The founding of Microsoft on April 4, 1975, marked the beginning of a new era in computing. With a clear vision and determination, Bill Gates and Paul Allen embarked on a journey that would revolutionize the computer industry. The significance of this day lies not only in the establishment of a company but also in the beginning of a technological revolution that continues to influence and shape the world we live in today.
