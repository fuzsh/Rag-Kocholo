        "text": "New Jersey Transportation Chronology\n\nPlease send corrections and additions to Bill McKelvey at mckelvey@lhry.org.\n\nPosted on LHRy website on 21 March 2018\n\nUpdated to 2007\n\nThis document was assembled by Capt. Bill McKelvey (with much help from others) to assist the consultants/designers/contractors building our Heritage Center at Phillipsburg. The following information will help in the formulation of story lines and exhibits appropriate to our transport history. It will also be a wonderful resource for students and researchers of New Jersey transportation history. In fact, it could be published in print or electronic form as a sales item to make money for the Heritage Center.\n\nSuggestion: To understand the value of this database and the greatness of the transportation developments in the state of New Jersey we suggest that you do searches for the words “first,” “earliest,” “largest,” “longest,” “greatest,” “best,” “fastest,” “last,” “pioneer,” “invented,” “established,” “developed,” “introduced,” etc. We think that you will be pleasantly amazed at what you will find happened in our state\n\nNote: Due to the unavailability of month and / or day of some events / items the listings of them under each year may not be in exact chronological order.\n\nBEGIN\n\nca. 10,000 BC The estimated date of arrival of Paleo-Indians in the Lehigh Valley area. Their seasonal hunting grounds began to be connected by a series of trails, 12 to 18\" wide. One of these, the Minisink Trail, afforded a route for the Minisink Indians to travel from their PA hunting grounds to the Jersey seashore. This trail started at Minisink Island in the Delaware River below Port Jervis, went north of Morristown, west of Springfield, six miles west of Elizabeth, four miles west of Amboy, through Shrewsbury, then to the sea. ♦\n\n1524 Florentine explorer Giovanni da Verrazano was the first European to discover and explore the Atlantic coast, including NY Harbor and New Jersey.\n\n1609 Henry Hudson sailed into the mouth of what became known as the Delaware River and anchored for the night. He then continued on to the New York Bay region where he is credited with discovering the Hudson River. He anchored his Half Moon in Weehawken cove. Shortly after, the Swedes and British claimed settlements in New Jersey along the coast.\n\n1614 Captain Cornelius Hendrickson sailed the Onrush north on the Delaware River to Brooklawn in Gloucester. Captain Jacobsen Mey, for whom Cape May is named, settled Fort Nassau, which today is Gloucester City.\n\n1616 Dutch sea captain, Cornelis Hendricksen, explored and charted the Delaware in his yacht Restless and reported his discovery to Holland merchants. ♦ The Dutch began establishing forts and trading posts on the Delaware River. The early Indian trails and paths began to be used by those arriving from Europe in the Colonial Period and were gradually widened to roads.\n\n1618 The trading station of Bergen was founded by the Dutch colonists.\n\n1623 The Dutch West India Company established a fort for fur-trading purposes near the present town of Gloucester.\n\nca. 1650 The first wagon road in America was built by Dutch miners and settlers to reach copper mines at Pahaquarry in the Kittatinny Mountains of northwest New Jersey to tidewater, at Kingston, NY. This \"Old Mine Road,\" to tidewater near Kingston, NY, is considered the oldest commercial wheeled-vehicle roadway built in the country.\n\n1660 Bergen (now known as Jersey City) became the first permanent settlement in New Jersey.\n\n1661 Willem Jansen was granted authority to operate a ferry from Manhattan to Communipaw, thus the first regular \"legalized\" ferry across the Hudson was established.\n\n1664 The first European permanent settlement was established in New Jersey. ◆ The Duke of York deeded the land, which is now our state, to Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret and decreed that the region be called \"New Jersey\" in honor of Carteret's earlier defense of the Crown at the Isle of Jersey.\n\n1666 Captain Robert Treat led a settlement on the Passaic River, known as Newark. The settlers gradually moved inland and followed the Native American trails, although their footpaths barely 12 to 18 inches wide made riding a horse perilous or driving a horse drawn vehicle impossible. They found that the travel and transport of goods was challenging.\n\n1673 The General Assembly of the Province of East Jersey passed their Public Roads Act, the first movement toward formalizing roads.\n\n1675 A ferry across the Delaware was established, but a rope ferry at Burlington had been in service earlier.\n\n1676 The Assembly of the Province of East Jersey ordered a road built from Middletown to Piscataway for their members. ♦ William Penn authorized a survey for a canal across the Jerseys from the Delaware River to New York Bay.\n\n1681 The West Jersey Assembly authorized a survey for their first long highway, between Burlington and Salem.\n\n1682 The East Jersey Assembly Public Roads Act provided for the layout of highways, bridges, landings and ferries; it also named specific men in each county to build the roads.\n\n1683 The East Jersey Assembly set up Road Boards for Essex, Bergen and Middlesex counties. The boards were empowered to layout highways, passages, landings and ferries. ♦ Miles Forster, New Jersey's earliest recorded shipbuilder, built his first vessel in Perth Amboy - but surely there were others before him.\n\n1684 East Jersey Proprietors encouraged a road to unite Perth Amboy and Burlington. It was completed along with a ferry connection to New York by Deputy Governor Lawrie and became Known as \"Lawrie's Road.\" Initially the old Dutch route over the Assanpink Trail remained a favorite. However, Lawrie's Road grew in importance in the first half of the eighteenth century and over it the first public accommodations for passengers and freight were established in New Jersey.\n\n1686 John Inian, one of the first settlers on the site of New Brunswick converted the Assanpink or Dutch Trail into a road. Before his work, travelers described it as \"nothing but a footpath for men and horses between the trees.\" Inian also improved and shortened the \"Lower Trail\" to Burlington and cut a way through to the new settlement of Piscataway.\n\n1687 Redford's horse powered ferry began as a commercial venture to connect South Amboy and Perth Amboy. ♦ (Approximately 1687) New Jersey's first recorded common carrier, Mr. Dellaman, was granted permission by Andrew Hamilton, Deputy Governor of East Jersey, to drive his wagon on Amboy Road for the accommodation of passengers.\n\n1688 William Royden was granted a license to run the first ferry from Philadelphia to what is now known as Camden. William Cooper soon bought out Royden and the line became known as \"Cooper's Ferry.\"\n\n1692 The American post office was established by King William III and put in charge of Andrew Hamilton. Hamilton, the East Jersey Deputy Governor, made the Amboy to Burlington road the route the postal riders followed.\n\n1700 A charter was granted to Samuel Bayard for a ferry from New York to Weehawken.\n\n1705 Essex County lawmakers established twelve new roadways to link Newark with outlying settlements.\n\n1704 A grant was made for a line of stage boats on the Delaware River between Burlington and Philadelphia. ♦ The legislature of the unified colony of New Jersey passed a highway bill that put in place a system for laying out and opening new roads and maintaining existing roads.\n\n1706 Hugh Huddy was granted the sole right of transporting goods over the Perth Amboy to Burlington road. This was the first American transportation monopoly on record, but it was struck down two years later.\n\n1707 A roadway joined Burlington and Cape May.\n\n1717 Another major highway bill was adopted, amending the bill of 1704, chiefly to regulate the opening and maintenance of local roads.\n\n1722 Samuel Coates operated a ferry from Lambertville, NJ across the Delaware River in conjunction with John Wells on the New Hope, PA side.\n\n1726 The population of New Jersey was 32,000.\n\n1729 An advertisement for Redford's Ferry also mentioned the availability of a \"Stage Wagon.\" This was the first definite mention of a Stage Wagon in New Jersey.\n\n1732 Emanuel Coryell arrived at Lambertville, bought the ferry and was granted a patent to operate on Jan. 7th of the next year by King George II. The ferry became known as Coryell's and the towns on either side of the river were also named Coryell's Ferry.\n\n1733 Solomon Smith and James Moore of Burlington advertised their frequent and regular \"Stage-Waggons\" to and from Amboy. This was the first known advertisement of such a stage line. From it have grown all the schedules, time-tables, and the whole complex system of movement that has become such an indispensable feature of American life. It may fairly be called the first regular overland transportation service offered the public in America. (Seymour Dunbar, A History of Travel in America, Vol. 1, p. 180) (Alex Roggero in “Go Greyhound” says this service began in March, 1732.) “The only long distance road on which commercial coaches and wagons were regularly operated before the Revolutionary War was that between New York and Philadelphia.” (Clarence P. Hornung in Wheels Across America) ♦ A charter was granted by King George II of England to Albert Kennedy, Esquire for a ferry between Manhattan and Pavonia (Jersey City).\n\nca. 1734 A post office was opened in Trenton, a sign that the postal route had been shifted from the Amboy - Burlington road to the New Brunswick - Trenton road.\n\n1738 A Stage Waggon to accommodate the public was established between Trenton and New Brunswick.\n\n1739 David Martin, a ferry operator from Trenton, obtained the first grant for ferrying (\"horses, cows, sheep, mules, etc.\" between Phillipsburg and Easton) at the forks of the Delaware.\n\n1740 The Ringwood Company was established as a small hamlet of miners, charcoal makers, iron-makers, etc.\n\n1743 Oxford Furnace went into blast on March 9th. It was the third furnace built in the colony of New Jersey. ♦ The Durham boat was developed for use on the Delaware River.\n\n1744 The Trenton - New Brunswick stage, which was growing in popularity, advertised specifically to attract travelers between New York and Philadelphia. With water connections on either end it took four or five days for the trip between the two cities.\n\n1745 John Dalley produced his map of the road between Trenton and New Brunswick, one of the first \"road maps\" drawn in the United States.\n\n1749 Phillipsburg first appeared on a map of the area. The name is thought to have originated with the Indian chief Phillip.\n\n1750 Douwes Ferry Road, from Harrison to Jersey City was completed.\n\nca. 1750 A more or less regular passenger and freight service began operating on the Delaware River using keel boats called \"batteaux.\"\n\n1754 Benjamin Franklin was appointed Postmaster General for the North. He recruited a corps of young horsemen to serve as Post Riders to maintain year-round mail deliveries between Philadelphia and Boston.\n\n1755 Joseph Borden, Jr. and partners started a stage line which became the first regular service between New York and Philadelphia. Only the Bordentown to Perth Amboy segment was by land. Boats were used at either end of the trip. The first steam engine in America was installed to pump water from ???? a copper mine in what is now North Arlington.????\n\n1756 John Butler established a coach service between Philadelphia and New York. The one hundred mile journey included six ferryboat rides and took three days.\n\n1759 Schuylers Plank Road (became Belleville Turnpike) was completed. ♦ The first local stage (for local rather than through passengers) began to operate between Cooper's Ferry and the Bay near Sandy Hook.\n\n1764 Old York Road opened for vehicles from Coryells Ferry (Lambertville) to Elizabethtown Point. ♦ A stage route from Paulus (or Powles) Hook to Philadelphia was begun. ♦ Sandy Hook Lighthouse was built in the 18th century and has been in service since this year. It is the oldest continuously operating lighthouse in the United States. ♦ Daniel \"Admiral\" Skinner was the first to navigate a timber raft down the Delaware River to Philadelphia.\n\n1766 The new Newark to Bergen (Jersey City) Plank Road was opened. It provided the connection with other roads to complete the first all-land route between the Hudson and Philadelphia. John Mercerau and John Barnhill introduced their Flying Machine. Their \"wagons set on springs\" cut the travel time between Paulus Hook, and Philadelphia to two days.\n\n1767 Cornelius Van Voorst established a ferry from Manhattan to Powles Hook in Jersey City. ◆ The first buoys mentioned in the United States were casks laid in the Delaware River.\n\n1769 A new stage route was established over the Old York Road, by way of Lambertville, Somerville, Plainfield, Elizabeth, Newark and Powles Hook.\n\n1771 The provinces of New Jersey and Pennsylvania declared the Delaware River a \"common highway.\" ♦ Abraham Skillman advertised his \"year round\" coach between NY, Elizabeth & Philadelphia in two days.\n\n1772 The first stage coach was used in New Jersey for public transportation by Joseph Hart's Philadelphia Coach Line. His route was from Powles Hook via Newark, Elizabeth and Trenton. It provided the most comfortable means of travel as well as the most expensive.\n\n1774 A charter for a sail/manpower ferry from Manhattan to Hoboken was granted. It connected with a line of stages run by Andrew Van Buskirk to New Bridge, near Hackensack.\n\n1775 The \"Continental Post\" established mail service between New York and Philadelphia with exchange of mail bags at Princeton.\n\n1776 On the night of December 25th, having previously ordered all boats to be hidden on the Pennsylvania side of the river, General George Washington deployed a fleet of mostly Durham boats and transported his troops across the Delaware River for their surprise march on Trenton and victory over the Hessians.\n\n1777 Daily stagecoaches began to operate from New York to Philadelphia. ♦ The New Jersey Pony Express began operating between Cape May Point and Coopers Ferry in Camden to communicate information on British ship movements to the Continental Congress at Philadelphia.\n\n1779 General George Washington visited Easton, and passed through Phillipsburg with Martha during an encampment of Colonial troops. The troops paused near what is now Memorial Parkway and Bates Street on a march to Oxford Furnace. It was believed that the British planned to capture the furnace to stop its production of cannon balls and ordinance for the Continental Army. ♦ Martha Washington ferried across the Delaware at Phillipsburg after visiting her husband. ♦ Wagons were requisitioned to carry grain and meat from Belvidere to Morristown for the Revolutionary Army wintering there. ♦\n\n1785 Congress authorized contracts with stage owners for carrying the mail between New Hampshire and Georgia via New Jersey.\n\n1786 The state of New Jersey gave John Fitch the exclusive right to construct, employ, and navigate steamboats for fourteen years.\n\n1787 John Fitch operated his first steamboat trials on the Delaware River. This is acknowledged to be the first steamboat to operate in America. It was replaced by a larger vessel, the Perserverence in the same year using components from the earlier vessel. It ran between Burlington, NJ and Philadelphia in 3 hours, 20 minutes. ♦ New Jersey was the third state admitted into the union.\n\n1788 Jonathan Dickerson predicted that within one century there should be a canal formed from the Delaware River to the Passaic supplied with water from Lake Hopatcong. ♦\n\n1789 New Jersey was the first state to ratify the Bill of Rights.\n\n1790 During the summer John Fitch put his steamboat in regular service on the Delaware River between Trenton, Bordentown, Bristol and Burlington. This was the first regular steamboat service to be established in America, but it was not commercially successful. ♦ The population of New Jersey reached 184,000.\n\n1791 Revolutionary War Colonel John Stevens obtained a patent for running a steamboat with paddle wheels. ♦ George Washington designated Tuckerton as America's third Port of Entry, following New York and Philadelphia.\n\n1792 Anthracite coal was first moved down the Lehigh and Delaware Rivers. It was moved on rafts which were used only during spring floods. ♦ Blanchard, a Frenchman, made the first balloon flight in the US. He departed Philadelphia, landed in Deptford, NJ and was returned by carriage and ferry to Philadelphia the same day. ♦ The Stony Brook bridge, south of Princeton, was completed. It may be the oldest bridge in our state. ◆ The Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures chose the area at the Great Falls of the Passaic River for the Nation’s first planned industrial center. It became Paterson and was known as “The Cradle of American Industry”. With the availability of water power and, the arrival of canal and rail transportation, Paterson became famous for its production of locomotives (, rotary snow blowers) and later, silk.\n\n1793 Baloonist Jean Paul Blanchard, the first man to fly in America, ascended from Philadelphia and landed in Deptford Township, NJ, also making the first air mail delivery in America (Jan. 9th).\n\n1794 or 95 Nicholas Roosevelt made the first stationary steam engine entirely built in America at Belleville.\n\n1795 Wooden bridges were opened as follows: across the Passaic River at Newark (492'); over the Hackensack River (980') and across the Raritan River at New Brunswick (990'). ♦ Matthias William Baldwin was born in Elizabethtown, NJ. He became a manufacturer of stationary steam engines and early locomotives. He founded M.W. Baldwin in Philadelphia, which became Baldwin Locomotive Works. BLW became the largest producer of steam locomotives and later also manufactured diesel locomotives.\n\n1796 Ross Winans, born in Vernon, NJ, exhibited great inventive genius at an early age, became a nationally significant figure in the development of railroad technology. His accomplishments were primarily for the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad at Baltimore, where he was a pioneer in the building of railway locomotives.\n\n1797 Samuel Morey developed and operated a paddle wheel steamboat between Philadelphia and Bordentown on the Delaware for a short time. Col. John Stevens, Robert Fulton and Chancellor Robert R. Livingston traveled in Morey's steamboat.\n\n1798 Col. John Stevens, Robert R. Livingston and others participated in the construction of a small steamboat, the Polacca, on the Passaic River at Belleville and it made a trip to New York City the next year. ◆ The Associates of the New York & Elizabethport Ferry Company began operating about this time. It is considered the oldest corporate entity of the Central Railroad of New Jersey and was officially incorporated as the Elizabethport & New York Ferry Co. on March 6, 1839.\n\n1801 The Legislature granted a charter to the Morris Turnpike Company, the first in New Jersey. It went from Elizabeth & Morristown to Milford, PA. Nearly all the early turnpikes were funded privately, not by the state. Between this date and 1828, 54 turnpike companies were chartered in New Jersey, but only about 30 were actually built.\n\n1802 The Bergen Turnpike Company was chartered. It was later taken over by the Jersey City, Hoboken & Paterson Street Railway Company to build their line along the route. When Public Service took over the trolley line they operated the turnpike as well. It became a public road in 1915.\n\n1804 Richard Trevithick built and tested the first steam locomotive for an ironworks tramway in Wales, which operated only for a short time. ◆ Oliver Evans of Philadelphia built a remarkable amphibious dredge at Philadelphia. He put wheels under it and it ran under its own power to and then into the Schuylkill River. He operated it down the Schuylkill and up the Delaware for 16 miles. ♦ The \"Associates of the Jersey Company\" was established and leased the New York - Paulus Hook ferry which was originally worked with sail and rowboats. ♦ The Trenton-New Brunswick Turnpike was chartered. ♦ The publicly-funded Newark Turnpike was built. ♦ The NJ Legislature chartered the New Jersey Navigation Co. to build and construct a slackwater navigation from the Raritan River at or near New Brunswick to tidewater on the Delaware. It failed.\n\n1805 The Easton Delaware Bridge Co. raised enough money by lottery to build a two span, wood arch bridge between Phillipsburg and Easton. It was designed and built by Timothy Palmer, the developer of the covered bridge, and was the third covered bridge to be constructed in America. It lasted nearly a century.\n\n1806 A 1,008' long, 36' wide covered wood bridge was completed across the Delaware River at Trenton, the first to span the river. It was strengthened in 1839 so that locomotives could use it, and in 1840 through rail service between Jersey City and Philadelphia was inaugurated. ♦ The Easton Delaware Bridge Co. raised enough money by lottery to build a two span, wood arch bridge between Phillipsburg and Easton. It was designed and built by Timothy Palmer, the developer of the covered bridge, and was the third covered bridge to be constructed in America. It lasted nearly a century. ◆ The Morris Turnpike was incorporated (as the Washington Turnpike) and was authorized to be constructed between Union Square, Phillipsburg and Morristown. ♦ The Easton Delaware bridge was opened. ♦ David Martin's ferry across the Delaware ceased operation after Palmer's famous wooden bridge opened. ♦ The first New Jersey Turnpike, also chartered in this year, ran from New Brunswick to Bound Brook, Somerville, Potterstown and Bloomsbury to Phillipsburg. It was later extended through Metuchen to Perth Amboy\n\n1807 The first railway passenger service began in England. ◆ Robert Fulton and Chancellor Livingston launched the \"North River Steamboat\" (Clermont) and established the first commercially successful steamboat service in America on the Hudson River. ♦ Hoboken landowner, Col. John Stevens built the Phenix, a paddle wheel vessel for the Hoboken to New Brunswick run. Phenix is acknowledged as America's second steamboat and the first built entirely in the US - completed only a few weeks prior to the Clermont. Phenix was also the first steamboat built in New Jersey. ♦ Jesse Hawley of Canandaigua, NY suggested that Easton (Phillipsburg), on the Delaware, would be a good place to begin a canal running eastward to the Passaic River.\n\n1808 The However, the Phenix ran into trouble with the Fulton-Livingston monopoly, and she was brought around to operate on the Delaware River. This May trip was the first ocean voyage by any steamboat. ♦ Stage lines began to use the Trenton and New Brunswick Turnpike in crossing New Jersey, marking a new era in overland transportation. Later, the steamboats Raritan and Phenix provided a through trip between New York and Philadelphia. ♦ James Allaire provided brass fittings for Fulton's early steamboats. He later took over Fulton's boat works (in Jersey City) and moved it several times on the New York side of the Hudson. Allaire is now famous for his bog iron village which carries his name in Monmouth County, NJ. ♦ Albert Gallatin recommended a conventional canal across the \"neck\" or \"waist\" of New Jersey in his Report on Roads and Canals submitted to the US Senate.\n\n1809 The steam ferry Camden superseded the Camden - Philadelphia horse ferry. ♦ The steamboat Phenix, built by John Stevens was advertised as running between New York and New Brunswick. The third commercially successful steamboat in America, Raritan, replaced the Phenix in New Brunswick to New York service. ◆ The first practical US railroad track (wooden, for horse cars) was put in service in Philadelphia.\n\n1810 An all turnpike route from Jersey City to Philadelphia, using the Trenton Bridge, was in place. ◆ Anthracite coal was being supplied to Phillipsburg\n\n1811 A franchised ferry route was begun with the steamboat New Juliana between Hoboken and Manhattan by Col. John Stevens.\n\nThe service operated continuously until November 22nd, 1967 - 156 years. ♦ Governor of New Jersey, Aaron Ogden, introduced the first beam engine steamboat, called Sea Horse, in New Brunswick - Elizabethtown - New York service.\n\n1812 Self-taught engineer, Col. John Stevens penned his vital pamphlet: Documents Tending to Prove the Superior Advantages of Railway and Steam Carriages over Canal Navigation. It was the first American railroad book ever written. In it he states: “I can see nothing to hinder a steam carriage moving on its ways with a velocity of 100 miles an hour.” Stevens was America's pioneer advocate for steam railroads and is regarded as the father of American railroads. ♦ During the War of 1812 much commercial traffic was diverted from sea routes to roads between coastal cities. ♦ Fulton's ferry Jersey was built at Jersey City. ♦ Paulus Hook/Exchange Place ferry service to Cortland St., NY opened on July 18th.\n\n1813 Oliver Evans proposed building a railroad between Philadelphia and New York, guaranteeing a train speed of 12 mph. ♦ The steamboats New Jersey and the Eagle were operating on the Delaware River. ♦ The New Jersey Legislature ordered carriages on public roads and turnpikes to keep to the right.\n\n1814 The first railway survey in America was conducted by Col. John Stevens between Trenton and Raritan Bay. ♦ To satisfy the Fulton-Livingston monopoly, Col. Stevens replaced his steamboat on the Hoboken ferry with a horse powered ferry. The horseboat had been invented by Moses Rodgers and was first used on the East River. His second vessel was used on the Hoboken run. ♦ The first steamboat excursion ran to Sandy Hook on May 25th using the Fulton. The war with Great Britain prevented her use in coastal waters. (Morrison) ◆ George Stephenson operated the first practical steam engine, called Blusher, on the Cillingwood Railway in England.\n\n1815 A railroad between the Delaware and the Raritan, later known as the Camden & Amboy, was chartered. This was the first intercity railroad chartered in the New World. ♦ The Travel Diaries of William Richardson document two trips from Boston to New Orleans by land in this year and his crossings of NJ by stage.\n\n1818 Hoboken to Barclay St., NY ferry service opened on 9.1.\n\n1819 The Savannah was the first vessel to cross the Atlantic partly under her own steam. Her machinery was built in Elizabeth and her drive shaft came from the Speedwell Iron Works in Morristown. ♦ Regular steamboat service between Cape May and Philadelphia commenced. ♦ Louis Charles Guille leaped from a balloon over Jersey City and safely landed with a parachute, the first jump in this country.\n\n1821 The United States provided the first steamboat service between Newark and New York.\n\n1822 George P. Macculloch, while fishing at Lake Hopatcong, got the idea of using the lake as a water supply for a canal across northern New Jersey from New York Bay to Phillipsburg. He vigorously promoted the idea of the canal and was the first to suggest the use of inclined planes for it. ♦ An act was passed to investigate the feasibility of the Morris Canal.\n\n1823 Ephraim Beach surveyed the route of the Morris Canal. ♦ Ark loads of coal were regularly being dispatched to Philadelphia via the Lehigh and Delaware rivers. ♦ The Delaware & Passaic Canal Commission was appointed by the Legislature of the State of NJ for the purpose of exploring a route of a canal to unite the Delaware, near Easton, with the Passaic, near Newark, produced a report and map of the route which was to become the Morris Canal.\n\n1824 The United States Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Marshall struck down the Fulton-Livingston steamboat monopoly (Gibbons vs. Ogden) thus opening steamboat services to competition except in the case of railroad owned ferry services. The preemption of the interstate commerce clause of the constitution was affirmed as one of the Federal powers. ♦ Col. John Stevens of Hoboken obtained a patent for his method of constructing a railroad. ♦ The Morris Canal & Banking Company was incorporated.\n\n1825 Col. John Stevens made the first known American application of steam locomotion to railway track on a circular track at Hoboken with his \"steam wagon.\" It is considered the first steam locomotive in America. ♦ Construction of the Morris Canal was begun. ◆ New Jersey’s first utility, Paterson Gas Light Co. Was chartered, but operations did not begin until 1847. ◆ The first public railway using a steam locomotive, the Stockton and Darlington in England, opened for regular service.\n\n1826 The Granite Railway, serving a quarry at Quincy, MA began operation with horse power.\n\n1828 Hazards Register of PA reported that 1,000 rafts containing 50,000,000 feet of lumber descended the Delaware River during the rafting season.\n\n1829 Reduced traveling rates (of $2) between NYC and Easton/Phillipsburg were advertised by the NY & Easton Line of Mail Coaches in combination with the \"New and Elegant\" steamboat Bellona between Elizabethtown and NYC. The coach left Easton at 4am and the boat arrived at NYC at 6pm. ◆ The Stourbridge Lion, the first locomotive built in England, arrived in New York. It was tested on the Delaware & Hudson Canal Co. Gravity railroad, but was too heavy for the track and was later used as a stationary boiler at Carbondale.\n\n1830 Robert L. Stevens designed the forerunner of modern \"T\" rail. ♦ Charters for the Delaware & Raritan Canal and the Camden & Amboy Railroad were granted. Ground was broken and construction was started on both. ♦ The Trenton-Belvidere Stage Line began operating on an 11 hour schedule thrice weekly between the two points at a fare of $2.75. ♦ The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad was the first in the US to establish passenger service. ◆ On Sept. 9th, Charles F. Durant became the first native-born American to fly. He flew a hydrogen-filled balloon from Manhattan to South Amboy.\n\n1831 An act was passed permitting the Delaware & Raritan Canal Company and the Camden & Amboy Railroad Company to consolidate their stock and use their joint funds for the completion of both railroad and canal. The New Jersey Legislature gave the \"joint companies\" certain protection against competition in the carrying of passengers and freight across New Jersey between New York and Philadelphia. ♦ The Camden & Amboy Railroad, the first in New Jersey, began operation between Bordentown and Hightstown with horse power. ♦ The locomotive John Bull, manufactured in England and assembled at Bordentown, hauled the first passengers with a steam locomotive on a regular railroad (the Camden & Amboy) in New Jersey. Madame Murat, niece of Napoleon, was the first woman to ride a steam railroad in the United States. ♦ The Paterson & Hudson River Railroad was incorporated and began construction. ◆ The first (British made) iron \"T\" rails were installed on the Camden & Amboy Railroad. The rail was mostly fastened to square stone sleepers, but some was laid with rails spiked directly to wooden cross ties - believed to be the first such use in the world. ♦ The Morris Canal was opened between Phillipsburg and Newark. Its inclined planes which overcame great elevation changes were an engineering marvel. In fact the Morris Canal overcame a greater change of elevation than any other transportation canal ever built. Its brownstone Little Falls aqueduct was at the time the highest (@ 52') stone arch in the United States. ♦ The first Morris Canal boats which were loaded with Lehigh coal at Mauch Chunk arrived in NJ. ♦ The first railroad car in New Jersey was built for the Camden & Amboy Railroad by M.P. and M.E. Green of Hoboken. ♦ One of Colonel James Reeside's \"elegant\" coaches, carrying seven passengers, baggage, and mail made a record run, with steamboat connections, from Powles Hook to Philadelphia in eight hours and forty-two minutes.\n\n1832 The Paterson and Hudson River Railroad Company began operation. ♦ In May an eastbound canalboat had just crested the top of the Boonton plane when the chain snapped. The plane car with the boat on it made a rapid descent of the plane striking the water with such force as to throw an immense wave over the towpath, taking the boat with it an depositing it on rocks below, between some trees. The Captain’s wife and two children, who were in the cabin, were uninjured. ◆ The New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Co., the third railroad in our state was chartered. ◆ The non-swiveling locomotive pilot and \"cowcatcher\" was invented by Camden & Amboy Railroad mechanic Isaac Dripps and first installed on the locomotive John Bull. ♦ A cable ferry was established across the Delaware River between the Morris and Lehigh canals. This allowed Morris Canal boats to load coal at Mauch Chunk and permitted Lehigh Canal boats to deliver coal to Morris Canal points. ◆ A cable ferry was established across the Delaware between the Morris and Lehigh canals. ♦ A Morris Canal boat was swept over the Phillipsburg Falls. ♦ Lehigh Canal boats were permitted to deliver coal to Morris Canal points. ♦ The LC&N Co. advertised for \"proposals for boating coal from Mauch Chunk to Newark.\" ♦ The first Lehigh anthracite coal transited the Morris Canal. ♦ The Morris Canal began to look for a suitable place to deposit coal at South Easton, Phillipsburg or elsewhere instead of using the Lehigh Canal facilities at South Easton. ♦ The first full boating season on the Morris Canal was completed.\n\n1833 An accident and derailment on the Camden & Amboy Railroad produced the first passenger injuries/fatality in the United States. Passenger and former President John Quincy Adams was injured. ♦ The first New Jersey \"junction\" was built to connect the New Jersey Railroad & Transportation Co. with the Paterson & Hudson River Railroad at a Jersey City location which became known as \"Marion.\" (Per Tom McConkey). ♦ It was proposed to extend the Elizabeth & Somerville RR to Belvidere, NJ, and from there to the Water Gap. It could then link up with the proposed Susquehanna & Delaware RR which would provide a connection through coal country at Carbondale.\n\n1834 The Camden & Amboy Railroad's John Bull was the first locomotive to be equipped with a bell. ♦ The Delaware & Raritan Canal was fully opened. Boats were borrowed from the Chesapeake & Delaware Canal for the opening ceremonies. ♦ The New Jersey Railroad & Transportation Company began operations between Newark and Jersey City. ♦ Rogers, Ketchum & Grosvenor Co., a machine works, was organized in Paterson. ♦ The first regularly scheduled steamboat service to Red Bank, NJ was begun by James Allaire's Frank. ◆ The first Camden & Amboy train arrived at Camden at 2pm on December 31st. ◆ The Morris Canal & Banking Co. ordered 32 new boats for delivery on or before May 1st. Twelve of them were built in Easton, PA and others were built in Lehigh Gap, Weissport and Mauch Chunk, PA.\n\n1835 On May 19th, the first locomotive built by Paul & Beggs at Paterson was destroyed by fire before being used. ♦ On May 24th, William Henry achieved America's first successful \"hot blast\" at Oxford Furnace. ♦ The first known New Jersey railroad holiday excursion was to the Paterson Falls via the Paterson and Hudson River Railroad on the Fourth of July. ♦ Rogers, Ketchum & Grosvenor, a new Paterson firm led by Thomas Rogers was hired to assemble an English locomotive which had been delivered from New York in 12 crates of parts via the Morris Canal. ♦ The Morris & Essex Railroad was incorporated. ◆ The Morris Canal toll collectors office was moved to Plane 11 west, Port Delaware from the Easton side of the river.\n\n1836 The Belvidere Delaware Rail Road Co. (Bel-Del) was incorporated on Mar. 2nd to build a line up the east bank of the Delaware River from Trenton through Phillipsburg to Belvidere, a distance of 64 miles. ♦ America's first head-on railroad collision occurred near Camden on the Camden & Amboy Railroad. There were no casualties. ♦ The extension of the Morris Canal to the Hudson River was completed. ♦ The Camden and Philadelphia Steam Boat Ferry Co. was incorporated in New Jersey on March 5th with Joseph Kaighn as president. ♦ Newark was named an official port of entry. ♦ An 8-wheeled passenger car was built for the Camden & Amboy Railroad. It is preserved in the Smithsonian institution and is the oldest such car in existence. ♦ The Hoboken to Christopher Street, NY ferry opened. ◆ The Belvidere Water Co. built the Belvidere Canal on the east side of the Delaware River at Rifton, just below Belvidere. It was about one mile in length and supposedly had a dual purpose: to supply water power to Rifton Mill and to give boats a safer way around the Foul Rift. It's usefulness died with the construction of the Bel Del railroad up to Belvidere in 1855, which was built over much of the canal.\n\n1837 On July 12th, Thomas Rogers filed the first locomotive patent in the US Patent Office. ♦ The first steam locomotive built by the Rogers, Ketchum & Grosvenor Locomotive Works of Paterson was intended for the New Jersey Railroad. It was test operated between Paterson, Jersey City, and New Brunswick on Oct. 6th, but was acquired instead by the Mad River & Lake Erie Railroad in Ohio and named the Sandusky. It is thought to have had the first steam whistle in America. Over the years Paterson was home to six steam locomotive manufacturers which built approximately 23% of all 19th century American steam locomotives. Before the industry left Paterson in 1923, over 12,000 locomotives had been built. ♦ The Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad began operating from Morrisville, PA, through the Delaware River covered bridge to downtown Trenton in May. The owners of the 1806 wooden bridge would not permit locomotives to pass, so the cars had to be hauled by horses across the bridge to Trenton. ♦ Thomas Rogers filed a patent for \"counterbalancing\" wheels, a significant locomotive design innovation. ♦ Matawan Stage Line was founded. The operation was purchased by Van Brunt & Son, Inc. in 1889. The firm continued in business (MC-1486) until recently and they still maintain the old Matawan Stage Line horse-drawn coach and dray wagon which are used in parades. ◆ The Morristown and Easton Railroad was chartered to run a line from Morristown via Mendham, Chester, Schooley's Mountain and Asbury to the Delaware River opposite Easton.\n\n1838 Samuel Morse and Alfred Vail made a public test of the telegraph at Morristown. It became a most important communication tool for the operation of railroads and canals. ♦ The New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Co. completed their open-cut excavation through Bergen Hill to provide rail access to the waters edge at Jersey City. ♦ The first US patent for a railway brake was issued to E. Morris of Bloomfield, NJ. ◆ Congress passed a bill making every railroad a postal route.\n\n1839 A small tugboat, Robert F. Stockton (renamed the New Jersey), was built in England for the Delaware & Raritan Canal Company. It was the first iron hull vessel to cross the Atlantic and the first commercially successful propeller driven vessel in America. ♦ The Elizabethport & New York Ferry Co. was officially incorporated on March 6, 1839. It is considered the oldest corporate entity of the Central Railroad of New Jersey ♦ The first continuous rail route between Philadelphia and Jersey City was completed by the Camden & Amboy RR and the New Jersey RR. Thirteen miles of the route, a Camden & Amboy branch) between Trenton and Kingston were laid along the east bank of the Delaware & Raritan Canal.\n\n1840 Lehigh Canal Chief Engineer, Edwin A. Douglas was appointed chief engineer of the Morris Canal to supervise it's enlargement. He was assisted by Robert Sayre, son of a Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company official. The first section of the Morris Canal enlargement was the west end due to the iron traffic. ◆ The population of New Jersey reached 373,306.\n\n1841 Martin Van Buren, the first presidential candidate to campaign by rail, traveled across New Jersey. ♦ Edwin Post's new iron furnace at Stanhope, on the Morris Canal, was the first in New Jersey to be put into blast successfully with anthracite coal. ◆ The Camden & Amboy RR replaced their last section of strap iron rail with “T” rail. ◆ The enlargement of the Morris Canal was reportedly assisted by 3,000 men paid for by the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Co. ♦ A great flood (the Bridges Freshet) occurred in the Delaware and Lehigh River valleys with water 35 feet above normal at Easton. It swept away nine bridges spanning the Delaware and damaged or destroyed much of the Lehigh Canal. ♦ The LC&N requested aid from the Morris Canal to repair flood damage. ♦ After several years of shadowy financial dealings, the Morris Canal went bankrupt. ♦ As many as 40 boats from the Morris Canal used the Delaware & Raritan (D&R) Canal in the fall of 1841. Because the Morris Canal was closed for enlargement work their boats navigated to the Lehigh Canal via the D&R (main line and feeder, crossing the Delaware River at Lambertville) and Delaware Canals to get coal to alleviate the shortage at NYC.\n\n1842 The first American, twin screw, steam vessels - Anthracite, Black Diamond, Ironsides and Vulcan - were built at NY City for the Delaware and Raritan Canal Co. These iron-hull steam canal boats carried coal north and east of NY City. ♦ The first 125 ton experimental boat was built on the Delaware & Hudson Canal at Honesdale, PA, but that canal enlargement had not progressed enough to move it by canal. The boat was therefore floated down the Lackawaxen and Delaware Rivers to Bulls Island where it entered the D&R Canal and was delivered to NY. ♦ The bell-cord for use by conductors to signal engineers was invented on the Erie Railroad and they carried the first shipments of milk to New York City.\n\n1843 A breach in the Morris Canal at Port Delaware broke through the embankment and emptied itself into the Delaware (ca. 7.18).\n\n1844 A hot water heating system was adopted for warming the passenger cars of the Camden & Amboy Railroad. ♦ The Morris Canal Co. was reorganized and \"Banking\" was dropped from their name.\n\n1845 The Trenton Iron Company was established by Peter Cooper and Abram S. Hewitt to meet a steadily mounting demand for railroad iron. The first American \"T\" rail was rolled in Trenton for the Camden & Amboy Railroad. This plant mass-produced the first high quality iron and steel rails for American railroads, the first structural I-beams for building construction, artillery carriages and gun-metal for the Union Army in the Civil War, the first steel made in the US by the open hearth process, and countless materials for bridges and buildings all across the country as well as overseas. ♦ The enlargement of the Morris Canal was completed. ♦ New Jersey History was established as the Proceedings of the New Jersey Historical Society.\n\n1846 One of the earliest commercial installations of the telegraph was to control boat traffic, water flows and levels on the Delaware & Raritan Canal. ♦ A series of excursions were operated by the Camden & Amboy Railroad from Philadelphia. Passengers took a steamboat to Bordentown, the railroad to (South) Amboy and another steamboat to cruise around Staten Island. Return was again via the C&A RR and a Delaware River steamboat. ◆ The Pennsylvania Railroad was officially chartered. ◆ The Morris Canal Co. announced prizes of $200 for the fastest boaters. The Cavanaugh brothers of Phillipsburg took their boats from Port Delaware, in Phillipsburg, to Jersey City in four days\n\n1847 Newark Gas Lighting Company was the first in New Jersey to have an operating gas company. ♦ The Erie was the first railroad to use iron rails rolled in America.. ♦ The Somerville & Easton RR was incorporated to build a railroad from Somerville to the Delaware River opposite Easton, PA. Their prospectus to potential stockholders reported on a branch costing $200,000 to be built to Belvidere to connect with the Susquehanna & Delaware RR. The branch was never built.\n\n1848 Outlet locks and a cable ferry were completed between New Hope, PA and Lambertville, NJ to allow Delaware Canal boats to take advantage of a short cut to Trenton and New York Harbor via the Delaware & Raritan Canal. ♦ The first modernized Morris Canal inclined plane was completed at Port Colden. A Scotch turbine replaced the original overshot water wheel and wire rope replaced the earlier chains as the hauling device. ♦ Cooper & Hewitt built America's largest blast furnaces between the Morris Canal and the Bel Del Railroad at Phillipsburg. Soon Phillipsburg pig iron nourished the fifty-eight furnaces and six rolling mills at Trenton to an annual production of 14,000 tons of rails and wire. At the time the Trenton works were called \"the leading establishment in the United States.\" ♦ Charles Danforth & Co. was organized to manufacture machinery at Paterson. ♦ A new campaign was started to complete the Bel Del RR to Phillipsburg. It was backed in large part by the Trenton Iron Works, which had blast furnaces in the neighborhood of Phillipsburg. The Camden & Amboy RR was given legislative permission to subscribe to $500,000 of Bel Del stock, and work was begun on the line. The Camden & Amboy finally wound up as owner of practically all the stock. The Bel Del also issued over $2,000,000 in bonds, which were guaranteed by the Camden & Amboy. ♦ John A. Roebling, America's pioneer suspension bridge builder, relocated his wire rope manufacturing business along the Delaware & Raritan Canal and Camden & Amboy Railroad at Trenton. Here the Roebling Company became world-renowned. His factory also produced the wire rope for the Morris Canal inclined planes, Delaware & Hudson Canal suspension aqueducts, cable railways and elevators.\n\n1849 Freight containers were first used in this country on the Camden & Amboy Railroad. ♦ The Newark Plank Road and Ferry Company, the first plank road organization, was incorporated to construct a highway from Newark to the Hudson River.\n\n1850 The Sayre & Fisher brick works were established at what is now Sayreville. They prospered and grew with excellent transportation available via schooner, barge, canal boat, railroad and more recently, motor truck. In their first 100 years the firm had made 6,250,000,000 bricks. ♦ Wagon top boilers were introduced by Thomas Rogers on a locomotive named the Madison. ♦ Construction of the Bel-Del RR was begun under the direction of Ashbel Welch, a civil engineer of considerable ability. Welch had been in charge of the construction of the D&R Feeder Canal and became the superintendent and chief engineer of the Bel-Del. He went on to become the chief engineer of the D&R Canal and the Camden & Amboy RR. ♦ The Cooper Hewitt furnace at Phillipsburg yielded 235 tons of iron in one week, a US record. ♦ The Somerville & Easton RR (CNJ) extension from Whitehouse to Phillipsburg was begun under James Laurie, Chief Engineer, a founder and first president of the American Society of Civil Engineers. ♦ Morris Canal inclined planes were rebuilt and the capacity of the waterway was enlarged.\n\n1851 The Erie Railroad was first to use the telegraph for directing train operations. (This occurred across the New Jersey border in the state of New York, but the Erie became a major freight and passenger carrier in our state with an extensive marine fleet as well.) ♦ The Cummings Car Works built railroad cars in Jersey City for 25 years. ◆ The Sussex Mine Railroad, a mule-drawn narrow-gauge tramway, was completed from Andover to Waterloo, where the iron ore was transferred to Morris Canal boats. In three years the line became a branch of the Morris & Essex RR and was converted to standard gauge and steam locomotion.\n\n1852 Robert F. Stockton, President of the Delaware & Raritan Canal Company, urged Congress to construct a steam-powered warship as designed by Robert L. Stevens of Hoboken. ♦ The steamboat Major William C. Barnett made many successful runs on the Delaware River between Lambertville and Easton/Phillipsburg. ♦ The Central Railroad of New Jersey (CRRNJ) was opened to Phillipsburg making connections with the Lehigh Valley Railroad and providing the first all rail route for coal from Pennsylvania fields to tidewater at New York. ♦ The steamboat Maj. Barnett commenced regular trips on the Delaware River between Lambertville and Easton ◆ Rogers, the most advanced builder in the US introduced a “modern” 4-4-0 locomotive.\n\n1853 Enlargement activity took place on the Delaware and Raritan Canal. Locks were lengthened to 220 feet and banks were riprapped. ♦ The first locomotive was completed by the Danforth Works at Paterson. ♦ The Ringwood Company laid out the Montclair-Greenwood Lake Railroad (NY & Greenwood Lake Railway had trackage rights on the Ringwood Valley RR) to their iron mines. Later, it was extended to the shores of Greenwood Lake at Happy Landing. When leased to the Erie Railroad, this line brought tourists to the Lake in summer and moved vast quantities of ice to the cities. ♦ The LV RR began to build a bridge over the Delaware River to connect with the Central Railroad of New Jersey and the Morris Canal Co. lands at Phillipsburg. ♦ The Morris Canal received 222,582 tons of Lehigh coal at Port Delaware.\n\n1854 The Bel-Del RR was completed from Trenton to Phillipsburg. Access to Easton for the Bel-Del was provided on the lower level of the Lehigh Valley's double deck bridge. This connection required a tunnel under Mt. Ida. ♦ The first train over the Bel-Del, a 15 car special from Philadelphia and Trenton, arrived in Phillipsburg. ♦ Cooper & Hewitt made America's first structural iron beams at Trenton. ♦ The Camden & Atlantic Railroad was the first to reach Atlantic City. ♦ The LaMothe steel passenger car was patented by Dr. B.J. LaMothe and developed in Paterson with funds provided by E.W. Sargent, a Paterson merchant. (August Mencken, The Railroad Passenger Car) ♦ The Trenton Iron Works produced the first rolled steel beams from Ringwood Company ore. ♦ Breese, Kneeland & Company of Jersey City began building steam locomotives. The firm built about 300 locomotives up to 1873, when they went out of business. The only known survivor built by this firm is on display in El Paso, Texas. ◆ A wide firebox was designed by Z. Colburn for the DL&W RR. ◆ Fluted locomotive side rods were first used by Rogers. ◆ Cabooses were in service on the Erie RR; the origin of the first such cars is unknown.\n\n1855 On Jan. 24th Miss Lucretia Bradley became the first American woman to fly alone in a gas-filled balloon (from Easton, PA to Still Valley, NJ). ♦ A wreck which occurred on the Camden & Amboy Railroad near Burlington killed 24 passengers and injured many more. It was caused by one train backing to give clearance to another on single track. It derailed when it backed into a carriage and team of horses. The wreck brought a storm of protests concerning the use of single track and lack of protection at grade crossings. ♦ The 4-4-0 General was completed at Paterson by Rogers in December. It was the locomotive stolen by Yankee forces in the Civil War Great Locomotive Chase. ◆ The Warren RR was given permission to construct the Oxford or Van Ness Gap tunnel. ♦ John I. Blair and the officers of the Warren RR Co. published a letter to the NJ Assembly and Senate seeking permission to construct a temporary rail line over the top of Van Nest Gap due to their having a difficult time driving the tunnel through. ♦ The CNJ was extended from Phillipsburg over the newly completed LV RR bridge across the Delaware River. LV passengers were transferred to and from the Jersey Central at So. Easton. ♦ Train service on the Bel-Del between Phillipsburg and Belvidere was inaugurated. ♦ The false work and chords of the 183' span of the bridge connecting the LV RR wooden bridge with the Bel-Del on the Jersey shore were carried away by high water (July). ♦ A Morris Canal boat struck the trestle work of the LV RR double-deck bridge at Phillipsburg. The entire woodwork of the span that connected the bridge with the Bel-Del tracks gave way and, along with all the workmen's tools, bolts, etc., fell into the water. Fortunately, since the accident occurred at noon there was no one on the bridge, there were no injuries. The men on the boat escaped injury by jumping into the cabin (August). ♦ The upper tier of the LV RR bridge across the Delaware River was opened for traffic. It was first crossed by the CNJ locomotive Lehigh with J.W. Murphy, builder of the bridge, and Robert H. Sayre, chief engineer of the LV RR aboard. At this time LV RR locomotives were both housed and repaired by the Jersey Central RR at Phillipsburg. ♦ The Bel-Del connecting track on the lower level of the LV bridge rose to the LV grade in South Easton about a mile up the Lehigh River. ♦ Lehigh anthracite coal traffic began moving from the mines to Phillipsburg and via the Bel-Del to Trenton and South Amboy. The Bel-Del was used by the LV RR because the Stevens family/Camden & Amboy RR loaned the LV RR $100,000 to complete their line to Easton. For this the C&A RR got two seats on the LV RR board. Later, LV RR coal traffic also moved via the CNJ to tidewater. ♦ The Bel-Del opened the Lehigh Junction Station in Phillipsburg, at the LV RR bridge. ♦ The Bel Del advertised two trains each way, daily, between Phillipsburg and Philadelphia. A through car was on the rear of the train. Travel time was 4.5 hours and the fare was $1.50. ◆ Thousands of four-wheel coal cars were in use on the Central of NJ, Lackawanna, Lehigh Valley, and Reading railroads. They carried 5 to 6 tons each.\n\n1856 Cooper & Hewitt made the first American experiments with the Bessemer steel process at Phillipsburg. ♦ A steam boat was tried on the Morris Canal. ♦ The Delaware Lackawanna & Western RR began advertising their broad gauge \"New RR Route\" with their first public timetable. The route began at New York City where passengers boarded the steamboat Wyoming for Elizabeth Port; there they took a Central Railroad of New Jersey train to (Hampton) \"Junction\" where the DL&W tracks actually began and ran through the Delaware Water Gap to Scranton, and on to Great Bend, PA where passengers could transfer to trains of the New York & Erie Railroad. ♦ The 4-4-0 Texas was completed at Paterson by Danforth Cooke in August. It overtook the General in the Civil War Great Locomotive Chase. ◆ The first LV RR train from Mauch Chunk arrived in Trenton. ♦ A two week strike occurred on the CNJ RR. ♦ The inaugural train operated over the completed Warren Railroad between Hampton Jct. and the Delaware Water Gap on May 27th. It began at Elizabeth on the CRR of NJ and ended at Scranton. This train was actually the first train to operate on the newly formed DL&W RR. ♦ A coal burning locomotive was tried out on the CNJ RR. ♦ The first span on the NJ side of the LV RR bridge collapsed under the weight of two coupled LV locomotives on 8.27. The locomotive Mauch Chunk fell onto the Morris Canal inclined plane at Phillipsburg and the locomotive Robert H. Sayre was left hanging in a web of broken timbers. The bridge was soon repaired. ♦The LV RR began shipping large quantities of coal via their connection with the Bel-Del at Phillipsburg to Coalport on the Delaware & Raritan Canal in Trenton for transhipment by canalboat. ♦\n\n1857 Two ten wheel locomotives, the Investigator and the Decision built by Cooke for the Lackawanna were said to be the \"first outstandingly successful hard coal burners.\" ♦ The boiler of the steam canalboat, Fanny Garner, exploded hear Weston, on the Delaware & Raritan Canal, killing five crew members and destroying the boat to the waterline ◆ Breese, Kneeland & Company of Jersey City built a 26-ton 4-4-0 steam locomotive for the Milwaukee & Mississippi Railroad. It later became the El Paso & Southwestern No. 1 an has been on display in El Paso since 1909. ♦ The Central Railroad of New Jersey began using coal as locomotive fuel and consistently found it 35% cheaper than wood. ♦ A flurry of plank road construction projects peaked in this year and then such roads faded.\n\n1858 A plan was put forth to construct a canal along the NJ side of the Delaware River from Phillipsburg to the head of the navigable feeder of the Delaware & Raritan Canal at Bulls Island. ♦ George P. Maccullough, who conceived the idea of the Morris Canal, was instrumental in its chartering and was its chief promoter, died.\n\n1859 The first iron passenger car was completed at the shop of W. Cundell at Paterson and it was tested on the Erie Railroad. The LaMothe cars were built until 1861. ♦ The Orange & Newark Horse Car Railroad, New Jersey's first street car company, was chartered and began operations a year later. ♦ The Jersey City &Bergen Railroad Co., Jersey City's first street car company, was chartered. ♦ The Hoboken & Hudson City Horse Car Railroad Company was organized. ♦ Through passenger service was established between New York (via ferry connection to Elizabethport) and Pittsburgh via CNJ, LV, East Pennsylvania & Pennsylvania Central Railroads. ♦ The first steel piston rods were introduced by the Rogers Locomotive Works. ♦ The Central Railroad Co. of NJ commenced operating multiple day excursions from New York (by steamboat) to Elizabethport and via the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western RR and other railroads to the coal fields of Pennsylvania including the Delaware Water Gap, Scranton, Wilkes Barre and Mauch Chunk. The special half fare rate was only $5.25 for the entire itinerary. ◆ The Oxford Iron Company was formed and its connections with the DL&W RR were strengthened via the Scranton family whose members sat on both boards. The business had been producing RR wheels, primarily for the DL&W, since the late 1840's.\n\n1860 Paterson's three locomotive plants (Rogers, Danforth, & Cooke) took national leadership by producing $1,565,000 worth of locomotives in this year. ♦ The Perth Amboy to Tottenville, SI, NY ferry commenced operation. ♦ The Raritan & Delaware Bay Railroad (later the Southern Railroad of New Jersey) began construction of their line south from Port Monmouth on Raritan Bay. ♦ One of the last recorded commercial Durham boat trips on the Delaware River occurred, with Isaac Van Norman commanding. Four replica Durham boats are used in the annual re-enactment of the Christmas day crossing at Washington's Crossing. ◆ On its maiden run north on the Delaware River, the boiler of the steamboat Alfred Thomas exploded near the site of the present Rt. 22 toll bridge and many of the passengers and crew were killed or severely injured. ♦ The Morris Canal Directors took an excursion on their canal from Easton to Jersey City in one of their own boats which was comfortably fitted for the purpose. They were most favorably impressed with the importance of the canal and the trip was a success. ◆ Steel locomotive piston rods were first used by Rogers.\n\n1861 The heaviest raft ever was floated down the Delaware. It was 190' x 60' and weighed 255 tons. ♦ The New York and Lake Erie Railroad completed their 8,000 foot long tunnel blasted under Bergen Hill, the first in New Jersey. The work had taken 5 years and 57 lives, putting the railroad in bankruptcy. ♦ A flotilla of fourteen Delaware & Raritan Canal steam transports were employed to carry 3,000 New Jersey troops and equipment south to the defense of the Capital at Washington, early in the Civil War. ♦ The New Jersey Railroad and Transportation Co. reported that they had transported as many as 3,000 soldiers, with baggage, in one day and claimed the resources to carry 10,000 men in one day. ♦ Due to the pressure of war demands, a supplemental route from NY to Baltimore was opened. On May 6th through trains began operating via the Central RR of New Jersey to Easton and other railroads through Allentown, Reading and Harrisburg to Baltimore. In this year over 26,000 troops plus a large amount of freight was carried south over this route. ♦ In November arrangements were made to run through trains between NY and Washington via the Camden and Amboy Railroad. The necessity of changing cars at the Susquehanna River was eliminated by running the cars themselves onto the ferry. This cut travel times to 12 hours or less. ♦ The Erie Railroad was the first to provide tank cars for movement of petroleum. ♦ The New Jersey Locomotive and Machine Co. of Paterson built the William Crooks for the Minnesota and Pacific Railway. The locomotive has been used in many railroad events and celebrations over the years. ♦ The Central Railroad of New Jersey had more double track than any other New Jersey railroad. ♦ The Pavonia Ferry Co. (Erie RR) opened their Jersey City to Chambers Street, Manhattan ferry.\n\n1862 Congress authorized President Lincoln to take possession of any or all RR lines in the US. ♦ A small ironclad steamer (and the first), the Naugatuck, was presented to the national government for the war effort by E.A.Stevens. She was rebuilt at Bordentown, received her armament at Hoboken, and traveled through the Delaware & Raritan Canal en route to Fort Monroe. ♦ Paterson built locomotives General (Rogers - 1855) and Texas (Danforth Cooke - 1856), were both involved in \"the great locomotive chase\" of the Civil War. ♦ The Camden & Amboy Railroad implemented a novel idea - they outfitted an older steamboat to carry through passenger and freight cars across the Delaware River from their terminus at Camden to the Philadelphia, Baltimore & Washington Railroad terminal at South Philadelphia. ♦ The Orange and Newark Horse Railroad, the first streetcar company in New Jersey, began operations on June 6th. ♦ The first federal tax, to help pay for the Civil War, was imposed on railroads. ♦ The Exchange Place, Jersey City ferry to Desbrosses St., Manhattan, opened on 8.1. ♦ The CRR of NJ boasted the shortest route to Chicago and the west - 898 miles in 36 hours, via connecting railroads. ♦ The US Monitor Weehawken was launched at Jersey City. ♦ The Warren RR completed the Oxford or Van Ness Gap tunnel. It was 3,500 feet long and was cut through bedrock. ♦ A sixteen page memorial pamphlet on John Owen Sterns, late Superintendent of the Central Railroad of New Jersey was published by the RR. ♦ The Central RR of NJ became the first railroad to use creosote to preserve ties and timber. An apparatus to creosote wood with oil of tar or \"Burnetizing\" it with chloride of zink, was built at Elizabethport. It was first used to preserve the timbers of the Newark Bay Bridge. ♦ The first Hoboken (DL&W RR) rail/ferry terminal was built. ♦ The Raritan and Delaware Bay RR opened their route from New York to Philadelphia. Steamboats departed from New York City for Port Monmouth where a transfer was made to their railroad. The route was via Red Bank, and Manchester to Atsion where a connection was made with the Camden and Atlantic RR for Camden and a ferry connection to Philadelphia. Early traffic was mostly Union soldiers and Army freight. Their route competed with the Camden & Amboy and was challenged by the latter.\n\n1863 The Union Transportation Company began operating through freight service from the Midwest via the Raritan & Delaware Bay RR to New York. The impetus for the service came from the Pittsburgh, Ft. Wayne & Chicago RR which demanded direct access to New York.♦ The first mechanical interlocking system in America was installed at Trenton by the United New Jersey Railroad and Canal Company. About the same time the first recorded use of any Space Interval system was implemented on a portion of the same main line. This was the first manual block system for controlling train movements in America. ♦ The first Mogul (2-6-0) type locomotive was built by Rogers Locomotive Works for the New Jersey Railroad & Transportation Company. ♦ The first direct trains began operating from the Hudson opposite New York City to Washington, DC. ♦ In June, Dr. Solomon Andrews of Perth Amboy successfully flew a dirigible balloon of his own design, the first airship of its kind in the US. ♦ The first street cars were operated in Passaic County by the Paterson Horse RR Co. ♦ The Trenton Horse Railroad began operations on October 23rd. ♦ The Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers was founded. ◆ The Union Line for fast freight was established.\n\n1864 The Camden & Amboy Railroad began operation of their new “straight” main line between New Brunswick and Trenton to replace the meandering line along the east bank of the Delaware & Raritan Canal. The new line became the main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad, currently operated by Amtrak and used by NJ Transit & Conrail Shared Assets. ◆ The CRRNJ opened America's first prefabricated railroad station. It was built in sections in Bound Brook and transported by train to Jersey City where it was assembled. ♦ The CRRNJ began operating the first sleeping cars in regular service in New Jersey. ♦ The first US Railway Post Office east of the Alleghenies was inaugurated between New York City and Washington. It was also the last such route to be operated. ♦ The CRR of NJ Jersey City to Liberty Street, Manhattan ferry opened on 7.29. ♦ The operation of street cars by steam dummies was tried by the Jersey City & Bergen Railroad but was abandoned after six years. ♦ The LV RR began replacing iron rails with steel. ♦ The Central RR of NJ was the primary artery of westward travel for immigrants entering the US at Ellis Island.

It began operations four years later. ♦ The first NJ/NY harbor RR floatbridge and carfloat operation was commenced by the Central Railroad of New Jersey, but it did not initially involve interchange with other railroads. At first it was used as a way to deliver merchandise freight to New York City without first unloading it from boxcars. The cars were placed on carfloats which were then floated to pier stations around Manhattan. The freight was unloaded via the center platforms and then into the piersheds. ♦ The Morris & Essex Railroad (DL&W RR) reached Phillipsburg. ♦ Coal traffic transferred from the DL&W RR to the Morris Canal at Washington peaked at 146,359 tons in this year. ♦ On 12.20 the CNJ RR issued General Order #2 prohibiting the operation of trains on Sundays except through express passenger trains, stock trains or those carrying perishables. ◆ The first compound locomotive was built in the US - Erie Railroad’s No. 122. ◆ The 2-10-0 type locomotive was introduced on the Lehigh Valley Railroad.\n\n1868 Steam power was applied to winches, valves and gates of the Delaware & Raritan Canal locks to greatly increase the speed and safety of operation. ♦ America's first open hearth furnace for steel production was built at Trenton. ♦ The Central RR of NJ advertised three daily express trains for the west beginning May 11th.

It was restored in 1961 and survives as the only covered bridge in New Jersey. ♦ Regular service on the NJ West Line (in which LV RR had an interest) was begun between Summit & Bernardsville and they were authorized to extend their line to the east bank of the Hudson River. ♦ The Easton & Amboy RR was chartered to build a double track line east from the Delaware River to link the LV with tidewater at Perth Amboy. The parent LV RR viewed the Morris Canal, which they leased, as a second-best option to reach NY Harbor. It is not surprising that when they were finally granted permission to construct the E&A they immediately requested permission to cease maintenance of the Morris Canal as a navigable waterway. ♦ General George B. McClellan began his campaign for standardization of railroad gauges. He is credited with being the father of standard gauge, which placed the United States years ahead of Europe in transportation. For a time he was Chief Engineer for the Morris & Essex Railroad and lived in West Orange. He was later Governor of New Jersey.\n\n1873 The New Jersey Legislature passed a bill which opened the state to railroads competing with the old Camden & Amboy (now Pennsylvania Railroad) monopoly between Jersey City and Philadelphia. ♦ The Reading, in concert with the CRR of NJ, LV, DL&W, and Delaware & Hudson Railroads established the first American cartel in an attempt to fix the price of anthracite coal and to limit volumes. ♦ The Hudson Tunnel Railroad Co.

In 1902 it was rebuilt as a caboose and survives at Allaire on the Pine Creek RR.\n\n1875 The Easton & Amboy Railroad (LV RR) was completed from Phillipsburg to Perth Amboy and included the 4,827 foot long Musconetcong Tunnel. ♦ Ashbel Welch designed the first interlocking switch system. It was first used on the Pennsylvania Railroad at East Newark, Hudson County. (per Armstrong & Wilk in New Jersey Firsts) ♦ The Central RR of NJ five arch stone bridge over the North Branch River in Branchburg was completed. It remains as the oldest unaltered railroad viaduct in New Jersey. ♦ On June 25th, the Central Railroad of NJ operated a special excursion train to tour the just completed NY & Long Branch Railroad. President Grant helped to inaugurate the new line. His private car was attached to the train which traveled from Jersey City to Long Branch. The bridge built for this line over the Raritan River was called a “mammoth triumph of civil engineering.” ◆ The Erie Railroad inaugurated a through train service over its own and connecting lines between New York and Chicago. George Pullman offered the Erie exclusive use of his equipment.

The resulting skirmish which became known as the \"Frog War\" was quelled by the New Jersey Militia. The D&BB RR was allowed to finish their line which connected with the Jersey Central. The monopoly of the United Companies was broken. ♦ The large ferryboat Maryland commenced carrying trains of the New York and New England Railroad, with their passengers aboard, from their terminal at 130th Street and the Harlem River to the Pennsylvania Railroad at Jersey City. This permitted a journey from Boston to Philadelphia and beyond without change of cars. Later freight cars were also transported. At the peak of these operations there were dozens of carfloat routes crisscrossed the NJ/NY port area. The sole remaining New Jersey carfloat operation is operated by NY Cross Harbor RR between Jersey City (Greenville) and Brooklyn. ♦ The Bergen Point to Port Richmond, SI, NY ferry began service on 7.15. ♦ The Pennsylvania Railroad operated the longest non-stop run - from Jersey City to Pittsburgh.
