S. BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS WASHINGTON No. 490 AUGUST, 1929 STATISTICS OF INDUSTRIAL ACCIDENTS IN THE UNITED STATES TO THE END OF 1927 Chapter I.— INTRODUCTION RELATION OF STATISTICS TO INDUSTRIAL SAFETY The purpose of the collection and publication of industrial accident statistics is to offer a basis for the promotion of safety in industry. The use of such data is essential to an effective operation of any wellplanned safety program. To be intelligently applied this informa­ tion must be analyzed and presented in such a way as to show, by the use of accident rates (explained on p. 8), the frequency with which accidents are occurring in any particular department or occu­ pation of a plant, how serious these accidents are in terms of degree of disability measured by time loss, and the relative importance of the causes operating to produce such accidents. With this informa­ tion at hand the plant manager or safety director is able to proceed with his program for the conservation of human life within his estab­ lishment, knowing that a plan worked out in cooperation with his foremen or his plant committees, or by other approved method, and vigorously and consistently applied, with special emphasis wThere the need is shown by the accident rates to be greatest, will, in the absence of fortuitous circumstances, result in a reduction of injuries of all kinds. The enactment of compensation laws in nearly every State1 focused attention upon the necessity for accident statistics which would shed light upon the various problems of compensation insurance. As this principle of compensating workmen for injuries received in the course of their employment has developed in recent years, some State administrative bodies have come to realize the value of such data in the work of accident prevention and are making the information available to industry. Unfortunately, however, the States have adopted procedures sufficiently different to make it difficult, and in many cases impossible, to combine these records in a general exhibit of interest and utility. The primary reasons for this are, first, lack of funds, because of which handicap many States have been unable to develop their statistical organizations sufficiently i South Carolina, Florida, Mississippi, and Arkansas had no such law. ture passed a compensation law at its session in 1929, The North Carolina Legisla­ 1 2 ST A TIST IC S OF IN D U S T R IA L A CCID EN TS to utilize the enormous quantity of raw material of accident statistics which has accumulated in the course of the administration of the workmen’s compensation laws; and, second, the fact that the State agencies have found themselves so involved in the multiplicity of problems of compensation that they have been unable to give adequate attention to the really more important problems of accident prevention. Ultimately it will be necessary for all States to do what some have already done, namely, to grapple with the matter of accident preven­ tion. It is to be hoped that when this time comes there will be an intelligent correlation of the statistical service and the inspection service, so that the statistical information may contribute its full share to the desired end. A complete compilation of industrial accident statistics has never been attempted by any Government agency. Here, again, insuffi­ cient appropriations have made impossible the nation-wide first-hand survey of industry rendered necessary by the absence of provisions in State laws calling for uniform methods of reporting accident data, including definitions, industry classification, report forms, time and extent of reporting, etc., and the centralization of such records in some Federal department at Washington. SCOPE OF TH E BUREAU’ S ACCIDENT RE PO R TS The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics has issued four bulletins 2 bringing together, so far as possible, the important records of industrial accidents throughout the country. Two of these were prepared by Dr. Frederick L. Hoffman and were issued in 1908 and 1914. The third, prepared by the bureau staff and published in 1923, brought the data for the most part down to the year 1920. In 1927 the fourth report was issued, including, so far as possible, accident records to the end of 1925. In all of these bulletins the data are based largely upon State and other official published reports, but the fourth bulletin, in addition to this, includes the results of the first attempt to collect directly from the States and from industry itself (other than the iron and steel industry, for which accident data have long been available) adequate statistics of accidents in manufacturing industries in a manner to make possible the computation of compar­ able accident rates. This record was supplemented in 1927 by the publication of a pamphlet giving the accident experience in the iron and steel industry and in a selected group of other manufacturing industries to the end of 1926. In the introduction to the second bulletin Doctor Hoffman com­ ments as follows: “ At the present time there are no entirely complete and trustworthy industrial accident statistics for even a single im­ portant industry in the United States. The most reliable data are for the iron and steel industries, mining, and the railways.” As time has gone on, the three Federal agencies concerning themselves with accident statistics, namely, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the Bureau of Mines, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, have so im­ proved their methods of collecting and handling accident data that 2 IT. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Bui. 78: Industrial accidents; Bui. N o. 157: Industrial accident sta­ tistics; Bui. 3,39: Statistics of industrial accidents iu the United States; Bui. 425: Record of industrial accidents in the United States to 1925. IN TR O D U C TIO N 3 what they offer may fairly be claimed to be “ trustworthy,” though in the nature of the case it would be beyond reasonable expectation that they should be “ entirely complete.” The present bulletin brings the statistical data regarding industrial accidents down to the end of the year 1927. The first accident data assembled by the bureau on a large scale pertains to the iron and steel industry. Beginning in 1911, when the first comprehensive report was issued as Volume IV of Senate Docu­ ment 110 (62d Cong., 1st sess.), the work has been carried on an­ nually and the results published from time to time,3 culminating in the figures offered in the present bulletin, which gives the accident experience of this great industry for a period of 19 years. Having secured the cordial cooperation of the industry to the extent that accident reporting is now regular and complete and susceptible of analysis for the application of accident prevention measures, the bureau has turned its attention to obtaining reports concerning manu­ facturing industries in general, continuing, however, to regard the iron .and steel industry as a separate group. Data for this industry therefor are, in consequence, omitted from the general tabulations herein and presented as Chapter IV. The record of the other indus­ tries first published was for the year 1925 (Bui. 425); it was followed by data for 1926 (Labor Review, Oct., 1927), and now by data for 1927. In addition to the data gathered first hand by the bureau’s repre­ sentatives, considerable statistical material compiled by other agencies has been included in the present bulletin. The bureau’s presentation of accidents in manufacturing industries and in the iron and steel industry is followed by tabulations published by the United States Bureau of Mines, covering mines, quarries, and metallurgical works, and by the Interstate Commerce Commission, covering the steam and electric railways of the country. These tables are supplemented by charts prepared by the bureau. The Federal Employees’ Com­ pensation Commission compiles statistics relating to accidents among Government employees in the civil service, and these figures have been included in this report. Other accident experience of sufficient volume to be significant has been taken from the latest report of'the National Safety Council,4 which gives for the year 1927 a record of 2,089 establishments em­ ploying 1,565,747 workers, with a total of 3,742,404,981 man-hours’ exposure. These figures cover 16 industrial groups. In some instances the accident rates taken from the other sources noted have, where it was possible to do so, been recomputed, on the basis of man-hours’ exposure so that they may be more nearly com­ parable with the rates given in the bureau’s tabular matter. In other instances, where no rates are given in the original report, they have been computed. After all, the rates are the significant factors for use in any accident-prevention campaign, and all presentations of acci­ dent statistics, whether by official or unofficial organizations or by industry itself, which do not include accident rates, lose much of their value from the standpoint of safety of workers. 3 Later complete reports on this industry are included in V , S.

Manufacturing industries (except the iron and steel industry, which is treated separately in Chapter IV). 2. Iron and steel industry. 3. Mines, quarries, and metallurgical works. 4. Steam and electric railways. 5. Federal departments. 6. Members of the National Safety Council. ACCIDENT PREVEN TION POSSIBLE That accidents can be prevented by an intelligent study of the situation, which is possible by the publication of statistics of this kind, is well illustrated by the record of the iron and steel industry. (See Table 11, p. 127). In 1910, before the accident situation was brought forcibly to the attention of the officials in that great industry through the computing and classification of accident rates, the workers were being killed and injured at the rate of 74.7 for every million man-hours of exposure, and for every thousand hours of exposure 7.2 days were being lost on account of disabling accidents. This was, of course, recognized as a serious economic loss that should be prevented. A definite safety policy was inaugurated and has been consistently maintained and rigorously enforced throughout the years, resulting in material, though intermittent, decrease in accident rates, until in 1927 the frequency rate had declined to 19.7 and the severity rate to 2.3, a drop of nearly 74 per cent in the former and of about 56 per cent in the latter. In considering other manufacturing industries, an average rate for the entire group is not significant, first, because of possible violent fluctuations in the amount of exposure or the number of establish­ ments included in the computation, both of which may vary widely from group to group and from year to year, and, second, because of the differences in the extent of reporting accidents in the various States. For these reasons average rates have been omitted from the totals in all tables. But industries may be compared with each other, and the record of accidents within any State may be compared from year to year, such comparison being possible because of the introduc­ tion of rates to interpret the significance of the abstract numbers. However, the value of such rates lies not alone in the making of comparisons but in the use of the information to improve conditions by the institution of comprehensive accident-prevention methods and their application where most needed. The record of the iron and steel industry is very striking. It is possible for other industries to duplicate this record. Indeed, some have done much along this line, as, for example, the Portland Cement Association whose plants, through the careful utilization of informa­ tion revealed by classified accident statistics, effected a reduction from 1919 to 1927 of 67.17 per cent in their total frequency rate and 49.28 per cent in their total severity rate. Table 1 summarizes the published reports of a number of representative industry groups, show­ ing in a rather impressive manner the effective results of safety efforts. 5 IN TR O D U C TIO N T a b le 1. — Com parative results o f accident prevention efforts in a group o f selected industries in specified years Industry Number of fullyear workers Number of acci­ dents Accident frequency rates (per 1,000,000 hours’ exposure) Rate Iron and steel: 1910_____________________________________ 1927_____________________________________ Portland Cement Association: 1919____________ _______ _________________ 1927_____________ ________ _______________ Paper mills: 1 1920_____________________________________ 1927_____________________________________ Chemicals:1 1923_____________________________ _____ 1927_____________________________________ Power presses:1 1926___________________________ ______ 1927_____________________________________ 202,157 395, 707 45, 283 23, 338 74. 67 19. 66 16, 247 31, 290 2,119 1, 340 43.47 14. 27 26, 525 Cl, 790 3,684 5,084 46. 34 27.42 6, 015 84, 682 443 4, 364 24. 55 17. 80 126, 387 149, 359 9,184 8, 717 24.23 19.45 Per cent of de­ crease 1 Industrial accident experience of members of the National Safety Council.

These items are as follows: (1) Number of acci­ dents; (2) exposure to hazard; (3) accident rates; (4) classification of industry; (5) causes of accidents. NUMBER OF ACCIDENTS The need of a record of the total number of accidents is obvious, but to obtain this record is not so simple as might appear. The difficulty is that the States put various interpretations upon what constitutes an accident. A tabulatable accident, that is, one “ resulting in death, permanent disability, or in the loss of time other than the remainder of the day, shift, or turn on which the injury was incurred, ” as defined by the International Association of Industrial Accident Boards and Commissions,1 is the designation adopted by most States and their reports are on this basis. However, some of the State reports also include all injuries which do not incapacitate for more than one day or exclude all which do not disable for more than two days or three days or one week or even two weeks, these being sufficient in number to render incomplete the total number of reported accidents occurring in all States or in all industries. This lack of uniformity also invalidates to a large degree a com­ parison of the reported accidents of one State with those of another even if the industry groups in each State are identical, and therefore impairs the value of the record as a comparative index of changes taking place. The form of definition of an accident is not so im­ portant, perhaps, but that in order to compile from State records satisfactory national statistics of accidents, it should be a definition uniformly recognized must be evident. EXPOSURE TO HAZARD Exposure to hazard is the basis for the computation of accident rates under the method noted in the next section. By this is meant the number of actual man-hours worked in an establishment during the period covered by the accident reports, usually a year. The method of expressing this element of exposure to hazard was first advanced by the Germans. Their solution was to note the number of days each workman was employed and then to divide the sum of these days by 300 on the supposition that the usual working year i See U . S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Bull. 276, p. 17, ITE M S E S S E N T IA L F O R A C C ID E N T PR E V E N T IO N W O R K 7 was one of 300 days of 10 hours each. This gave the number of 300-day or full-year workers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics adopted this basis for calculating accident rates when it began its accident studies. There were, however, troublesome difficulties in the use of this base and the International Association of Industrial Accident Boards and Commissions finally determined, at the instance of its committee on statistics and accident insurance cost, to abandon the idea of the number of workers and use instead the hours of employ­ ment 2 so that all rates are now computed on the basis of actual reported man-hours, although a reduction to full-year workers is made to avoid the use of large figures in tabulations and also to give some idea of the extent of employment represented. This reduction is obtained by dividing the number of man-hours by 3,000. To illustrate the convenience and importance of knowing the exposure, reference is made to Table 6. That there were 390 accidents in the manufacture of cotton goods in Georgia in 1927 and 127 in the same industry in Virginia would on its face indicate a greater volume of production in Georgia or that the production was attended with greater hazard, or the larger number of accidents in Georgia may be only the natural result of a larger number employed, which is shown by the number of full-year workers in each State. Yet, when the total number of man-hours or full-year workers in each State, representing the exposure to hazard in that industry, is considered in relation to the number of accidents and frequency rates determined, it will be noted that workers in the Virginia industry apparently have the greater likelihood of being injured, for there a frequency rate of 6.85 is indicated, while in Georgia the rate is 6.13. This, however, does not take into account severity, to be considered later. Thus it will be seen that it is necessary to know how many employees there are in each industry group and something regarding the length of time during which these workers are subject to the dangers of their calling. Without this base to which to relate the number of accidents in both the industrial and the cause classification, the place most needing the application of accident prevention measures is not disclosed. The importance of exposure as an element in the study of industrial accidents has become recognized more and more with the passage of time. The Bureau of Labor Statistics was the first to utilize it on an extended scale. For some years now the Bureau of Mines and the Interstate Commerce Commission have presented their facts on this basis, and many sections of the National Safety Council, as well as a few independent industrial groups, develop their accident data in this way. Unfortunately, records of exposure are lacking in most of the States, so that accident rates do not appear in their reports. This condition offers another obstacle to the compilation of national accident statistics of value. It is to be hoped that compensation officials will require the reporting of man-hours where the law does not specifically prohibit it, or seek legislative enactment permitting it if necessary, so that their published accident figures may be of real value to their local industries in the promotion of safety. 2 See U . S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Bui. 276, pp. 17 and 68. STA TIST IC S O F IN D U S T R IA L A C C ID EN TS 8 ACCIDENT RATES The mere collection of numbers of accidents leads nowhere. To be of value the number must be reduced to some common basis that will permit of comparison. This basis is the accident rate of which two forms are recognized— a frequency rate and a severity rate. The former facilitates a comparison of the occurrence of accidents in various industries, or departments, or States or cause groups, as the case may be, while the latter, expressed in terms of days lost, indicates the comparative seriousness of the various types of accident, or of the same kind of accident under different conditions. Frequency rate.— In determining the frequency rate two factors are necessary— the exposure to hazard and the number of accidents. This rate is derived h j dividing the number of accidents by the number of man-hours expressed in millions. Severity rate.— It is of course recognized that some industries natu­ rally have a higher proportion of severe injuries, while others pre­ dominate in the number of minor injuries. Also, the industry having the more severe accidents., indicated by days lost, may actually have numerically fewer accidents. The frequency rate, being computed from the actual number of accidents, would therefore give misleading information as to the real hazard of the industry, and a comparison of industries, or of departments or occupations within an industry, on this showing alone should not be made if a true basis for safety work is desired. To meet this situation the severity rate was devised as a more accurate indication of the real hazard. It is evident that in frequency rates a death influences the accident rate to the same extent as does a temporary disability of one day, thus preventing the development of a true and complete picture of the accident situation. The first effort to meet this 'difficulty w^as the separation of the accidents into three groups according to their result, namely, death, permanent disability, and temporary disability. While this made possible a separate comparison of each result in different industries, it did not afford comparability of the permanent and the temporary disabilities with each other and with the fatalities. It was necessary to translate the different casualties into common terms. This was accomplished by means of a schedule of fixed time allowances,3 beginning with 6,000 days for death and the loss of any two members, 4,000 days for the loss of an arm or a leg, 3,000 days for the loss of a hand, 1,800 days for the loss of an eye, and so on through the list of permanent disabilities. The application of these constants gives for each sort of casualty a value in terms of days somewhat proportional to its economic importance. The duration of temporary disabilities is of course definite in each case. The severity rate is determined by dividing’ the number of days lost by the number of man-hours ’ exposure and expressing the result in terms of 1,000 hours * exposure. The change from 1,000,000 hours used in frequency rates to 1,000 hours is to obviate the use of small decimals. Thus we find, to revert to the example already cited on page 7, that the severity rate for accidents in the manufacture of cotton goods in Virginia in 1927 is 0.77 day per 1,000 man-hours’ 3 See U . S, Bureau of Labor Statistics Bui. 276, p. 77, ITEM S E S S E N T IA L F O R A C C ID E N T P R E V E N T IO N W O R K 9 exposure, which figure may be brought into comparison with the severity rate in Georgia, namely, 1.07, thus indicating the greater hazard in this particular industry in the latter State. It has been observed that high frequency rates are rather apt to accompany low severity rates, and this fact is made evident by the form oI statistical presentation just described. In other words, when the number of accidents is increased, giving a high frequency rate, the severity rate is not correspondingly increased because of the large relative proportion of temporary disability cases in which the timeloss factor is comparatively small. The result of bringing together the exposure to hazard, the number of accidents, and the da}^s lost is well illustrated by the following record of the automobile industry for the year 1927 covering only the group of States reporting disabilities extending beyond one week (see Table 4): Number of cases: D eath_______________________________________ __________ 61 Permanent disability___________________________________ 649 Temporary disability__________________________________ 4, 491 T ota l________________________________________________ 5, 201 Accident frequency rates (per 1,000,000 hours’ exposure): D eath_______________________________________ __________ __0.11 Permanent disability___________________________________ __1. 21 Tem porary disability_____________________________________8. 36 T o ta l________________________________________________ Accident severity rates (per 1,000 hours’ exposure): D eath__________________________________________________ Permanent disability___________________________________ Tem porary disability___________________________________ T o ta l__________________________ ______________________ 9. 68 0. 68 . 90 . 22 1.80 It will be noted that in frequency rates the figures are progressively larger for death, for permanent disability, and for temporary dis­ ability. It is hardly possible to avoid the impression that the nu­ merically larger figure for temporary disability is important in pro­ portion to its size. As a corrective to this impression we need the severity rates, in which all injuries, including death, are weighted according to their severity. The frequency rate fails to tell the whole story because in it units are combined that are not comparable. The severity rate corrects this condition through the use of a procedure which reduces these units to approximately common terms. What is needed is an expression that will combine the two rates into one accident rate, giving proper weight to the relative importance of each. Whether this can be developed is problematical. Meanwhile the almost universal practice is to consider the severity rate as the true measure of the hazard involved and comparisons are usually made on this basis. CLASSIFICATION OF INDUSTRY A heterogeneous mass of figures of accidents within a State having varied industries, no matter how extensive the classifications, is worse than confusing; it is useless. The fact that there were 158,690 10 ST A TIST IC S O F IN D U ST M A Li A C C ID E N T S nonfatal industrial accidents in Pennsylvania in 1927, as shown in Table 3, gives us no information for purposes of accident prevention, even though an accident rate may be obtained. Some of these accidents may have occurred in connection with structural iron work, for example, which is apparently the most hazardous industry in that State as revealed by Table 5, while other accidents may have occurred in the manufacture of bricks where the hazard is relatively small. When, however, the accident in the various industries are separated and rates computed, as has been done in this table, some hint is offered regarding the point where accident prevention effort is needed. Ob­ viously a further analysis is required for definite action. CAUSES OF ACCIDENTS In order to apply effectively a program of accident prevention the safety man must know what needs to be done as well as where remedial effort is demanded. Not only does he require information as to the occupations of the men injured, in what departments they were working, and how long they were incapacitated for work, but he must have data relative to the causes of accidents so as to know just what to do to prevent recurrence. This presents another phase of the safety program, namely, the mechanical aspect, which is no less important than the human side. Both must be considered together and to this end an analysis of accident causes is essential. A word of caution as to the accuracy of reporting causes is not out of place in. this connection. Frequently the cause of an accident is set down as due to a physical or mechanical defect, whereas a careful check may reveal the real cause as disobedience of safety regulations. For example, a case where an employee was reported as injured by a revolving wheel was found, upon close examination, to be due to the fact that he had removed the guard contrary to instructions. Such an inaccurate report would cause a misapplication of safety methods, and for this reason statistical agencies should insist that reports be filled in accurately and precisely. CONCLUSION In addition to the items listed as prerequisites to adequate accident prevention in industry, a certain value attaches to information re­ garding nature of injury and location of injury, although these items are of much less practical importance than are accident causes. The view of the several States as regards the importance of the above items may be inferred from the records for 1920, the year for which the most nearly complete information is available: Number of States recording number of accidents, 42; number classifying by industry, 22; number classifying by cause of injury, 18; number classifying by location of injury, 11; number determining exposure, 2; number determining accident severity rates, 3. No State covers all items, and in most States no attempt is made to report the important item of exposure to hazard, thus making a complete study of accidents from all standpoints utterly impossible. Chapter IIL— ACCIDENTS IN MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES GENERAL SCOPE OF SURVEYS M AD E When the bureau began the collection of accident data covering manufacturing industries, beginning with the year 1925, it was possible to get records of 1,282 establishments in 24 industry groups, employing 555,996 full-year workers in 11 States. In 1926 and again in 1927 the work was extended, including in the latter year 1,075,282 full-year workers in 2,676 establishments and covering 29 industry groups in 26 States. (See Tables 2 and 4.) The records of accidents have been secured directly from State authorities to whom, under the various workmen’s compensation laws, establish­ ments are required to report. For the most part the number of manhours has been obtained directly from individual establishments, request being made therefor by correspondence. The cooperation of State officials and representatives of industry thus enlisted has been cordially given and makes possible this report. Here again it should be stated that the iron and steel industry was not included in the general survey, since it has been made the subject of special investigation from year to year, the results of which have been published and which are brought down to date in Chapter IV. Table 2 exhibits the progress made by the bureau in the extent of the three nation-wide surveys of the manufacturing industries thus far completed : T a b le 2 .— Comparative statement of extent of industrial accident surveys, 1925, 1926, and 1927 1926 i Item Establishments______________________________________ Full-year workers.__ _ . _________ ______ ________ States___________________________________ __ Industry groups______ __________ _ _ ___ __________ Fatal accidents_________________________ ___________ Permanent disabilities, ___________________________ Temporary disabilities________ _____________________ Total accidents.. ____________ . . _ 1925 1,282 555,996 11 24 171 2,047 21,496 23, 714 1927 Number Per cent increase over 1925 2,209 991,082 25 30 370 4,090 44,041 48, 501 72.31 78.25 127. 27 25.00 116.37 99.80 104. 87 104. 52 Per cent increase over 1926 Number 2,676 1,075,282 2 26 3 29 459 3,949 57,072 61,480 21.14 8.50 4.00 4 3.33 24.05 4 3.45 29. 59 26. 76 1 Figures include the carriages and wagons industry group, which has been discontinued. 2 Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas added; no reports received from Montana and South Dakota as in 1926. 2 Carriages and wagons group not included, being discontinued. 4 Decrease. While practically all of the industrial States and every industry group in the bureau’s classification, which follows substantially the census classification, are now included in this statistical presentation, it is the purpose of the bureau to extend its records, as facilities may 11 12 STATISTICS OF IN D U S T R IA L ACCID EN TS offer, from year to year to include more establishments in each industry and a greater number of full-year workers, so that the resultant accident rates may be based upon the largest possible exposure and thus add materially to their significance. ACCIDENT DATA REPORTED BY THE STATES, 1917 TO 1927 In gathering from each State the record of its fatal and nonfatal industrial accidents during any calendar year, as presented in Table 3, it has been practically impossible to secure figures that may be con­ sidered complete or accurate. In its request for this information the bureau asked three questions as follows, the data to cover a calendar year: 1. Number of fatal industrial accidents? 2. Number of nonfatal industrial accidents (including permanent disabilities and tem porary disabilities lasting beyond the day of injury)? 3. Number of industrial accidents that were compensable? The purpose of question 2 was to include accidents which are tabulatable under the^standard definition,1 thus excluding a large number of accidents requiring medical attention only but which are reported in some States. Question 3 was asked primarily to get some statement of nonfatal accidents in the event that question 2 could not be answered, the thought being that it involves very little extra work to determine the number of cases which by their nature must be considered more or less in detail under compensation laws. However, the replies received were in some instances quite unsatisfactory. One factor operating to render the figures somewhat inaccurate is that in many of the States those charged with the collection and pre­ sentation of accident statistics (usually the same organization which administers the workmen’s compensation law) are handicapped by lack of sufficient funds to employ the help necessary to compile detailed statistical reports, or any reports at all, even omitting to tabulate cases involving compensation, although data required for fairly complete reports may be at hand. In some instances, therefore, the figures given are estimates by the States. But perhaps the greatest obstacle to a satisfactory showing of the true accident situation in the various States is the absence of uni­ formity in the extent of reporting required from industrial establish­ ments. This in turn is influenced largely by the provisions or absence of certain provisions in each State workmen’s compensation law. A State, generally speaking, requires only such information as will enable it to administer its law, and very little attempt is made, except in a few instances, to gather or tabulate complete statistical data. Thus we find that some States do not require the reporting of accidents which cause a disability of less than the waiting period prescribed by law, others require the reporting of all accidents wherein the disability extends beyond the day of injury, and still others require that every accident, no matter how trivial, shall be reported. Reference to this lack of uniform reporting has been repeatedly made, but so serious is this handicap in the vigorous application of accident prevention measures that its repetition seems justified. 1 See U . S. Bureau of Labor Statistic Bui. 276, p. 17; also, p. 6 herein. AC CID EN TS IN M A N U F A C TU R IN G IN D U ST R IE S 13 All of these factors, and others of minor importance, modify the reports presented in Table 3. In noting, for example, that there were 10,193 fatal and 1,979,830 nonfatal industrial accidents reported for 1927 as compared with 10,338 fatal and 1,825,401 nonfatal acci­ dents reported for 1926, the explanations offered must be borne in mind lest a wrong impression of the relative significance of the totals be gained. In so far as practicable the variations in reporting have been indi­ cated by footnotes. It should be stated, in fairness to the States, that wherever “ no report” is indicated, it does not mean that the report is missing because of lack of desire to cooperate, but because of some factor already mentioned, or some other reason of local importance which renders a report impossible. To note each of these reasons would multiply the footnotes unduly. It will thus be seen that a comparison of the records of the various States with each other would not be justified, and Table 3 is not presented for that purpose, but merely as an attempt to show, in a general way, the extent of industrial accidents throughout the country. It is probably the most nearly complete report of industrial accidents in this country ever assembled and it is published for its value as such. 36904°— 29-------2 14 ST ATISTICS OF IN D U ST R IA L ACCID EN TS T a b le 3 .— Num ber o f fatal and nonfaial accidents 1918 1917 1920 1919 1921 State Fatal Nonfatal (2) 59, 055 12,480 Conn____ D e l ...........

First, in some States those accidents in which the disability terminated in the first week (the waiting period under most of the compensation laws) are not reported and therefore were unavailable for these tabulations. This neces­ sarily vitiates somewhat the comparability of the accident rates. In the second place, reports of accidents causing temporary disabili­ ties were not available in California and Pennsylvania for 1925 and 1926 and in California for 1927, while fatal cases are not being reported in Oklahoma. These factors, especially the omission of fatalities, make a com­ parison of industries in the various States somewhat misleading. In Alabama no accident reports are filed where the disability terminated within two weeks. This fact, of course, removes a comparatively large number of temporary accidents from consideration in calcu­ lating rates for this State. The accidents in any industry in Alabama, therefore, could hardly be brought into a fair comparison with those in the same industry in a State like Massachusetts where all accidents are reported. This is reflected in the rates for cotton goods, for ex­ ample. For Alabama in 1927 the frequency rate is 3.67 and the sever­ ity rate is 0.18, while for Massachusetts the corresponding rates are 14.74 and 0.55, respectivly. Were all tabulatable accidents reported in Alabama as they are in Massachusetts, with no change in exposure, the rates in the former State would more nearly approach those in Massachusetts and might even exceed them. Of course differences in the extent of accident prevention work would also modify the result. In an attempt to minimize the effect occasioned by this difference in reporting accidents, and also to prevent, so far as possible, mis­ leading conclusions, the industries and States in Tables 4, 5, and 6 have been grouped on the basis of completeness of the reports received by the various States. Thus in Table 4, for example, all States report­ ing accidents in which the disability extended beyond the day of injury appear in the first group headed “ Accidents for States report­ ing all disabilities extending beyond day of injury/7and the industries there listed include data for such States only.2 This group, in 1925, included 17.2 per cent of the total full-year workers. In 1926 the percentage was 28.6 and in 1927 more than half (56.6 per cent) of 2 States for which all accidents resulting in death, permanent disability, or temporary disability extend­ ing beyond the day of injury are reported, include the following: Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York (in 1927), North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania (in 1927), South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, and W est Virginia. Those States in which the accidents reported include death, permanent disability, and those temporary disabilities which extended beyond the first week, are as follows: Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, New Jersey, N ew York (in 1925 and 1926), Virginia (in 1927), and Wisconsin. The record for 1926 in Virginia includes accidents resulting in death, permanent disability, and only those temporary disabilities which extended beyond 10 days. Accidents which resulted in temporary disability which lasted less than 2 weeks are not reported in Alabama. In Oklahoma only those accidents in which the disabilities extended beyond five days are included. California reported no temporary disabilities, and Pennsylvania reported none for 1925 and 1926. AC CID EN TS IN M A N U F A C T U R IN G IN D U ST R IE S 17 the workers covered by the reports were in States making complete reports of accidents. It is hoped to increase this percentage from year to year.

CO 32 STATISTICS O F IN D U S T R IA L A C C ID E N T S ACCIDENTS AND ACCIDENT RATES IN SPECIFIED STATES, BY INDUSTRY A new feature in this report is found in Table 5, wherein the accident data for each specified State is presented by industry, thus affording an opportunity for each State to compare its experience in a particular industry during the years covered. The States are grouped according to the extent to which accidents are reported. Thus those States reporting all accidents in which the disability extended beyond the day of injury will be found in the first group, comprising therefore the most complete reports and rendering the resultant rates more accurate and more nearly a true picture of the accident hazard in each industry. Those States reporting accidents in which disabilities extended beyond the first week, 10 days, and the second week, respec­ tively, are found in subsequent groups. It is earnestly to be hoped that all States will soon require the reporting of all accidents, so that a fair and uniform basis will be afforded for the computation of industrial accident statistics. To omit that large group of accidents in which the disabilities last beyond the day of injury but which terminate within the first week, minimizes the importance and lessens the value of accidents rates, and in most instances results in the computation of rates that are actually misleading. For effective accident prevention work it is essential that all accidents be reported.
