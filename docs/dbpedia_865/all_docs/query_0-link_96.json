        "text": "On 16 June 1837, at a little after six o'clock in the morning, a train of cars carrying lumber and gravel and crowded with twenty or more Irish track laborers and other workmen left the Boston depot of the Boston & Worcester Railroad Corporation bound for Worcester. About four miles out, just after the train had passed the City Mills and was nearing the Brookline road, a wheel on one of the cars broke. The train was thrown from the tracks. Two men were killed and several others severely injured.\n\nAmong the injured was a man named Gilham Barnes, engaged by the Corporation about two weeks before to carry out maintenance work on several bridges between Boston and Worcester. On the previous day, Barnes, his brother Luther, and one of the men who worked with them had ridden the same train (an unscheduled track maintenance train known to the corporation as the “gravel” train) as far as the Arsenal bridge, which carried the railroad over the Watertown road in Brighton, to deliver materials and tools. On the morning of the sixteenth, Barnes sent the others by wagon via the Mill Dam toll road to begin work on the Arsenal bridge while he made arrangements with the conductor of the gravel train for additional materials to be carried to the Worcester bridge. Barnes intended, it would seem, to ride the gravel train as far as the Arsenal bridge where he would jump off and join his workmen. “We saw the train going out just after we paid [the] toll,” Luther Barnes later recounted. “Then near City Mills we saw shingles &c all about. I saw my brother running towards us. He waved his hat twice. And he held up his arm and I saw blood and flesh.”\n\n23. McCoy, Elusive Republic, 111, 104-19. A particular object of concern for those sharing this perspective was Alexander Hamilton's 1791 blueprint for industrial growth, the Report on Manufactures. Hamilton's Report underscored how an industrialism animated by the political economy of Federalism would be a far different phenomenon from that implied in the Jeffersonian vision, seeming to many liberal Republicans “to describe a society ominously reminiscent of the English system.” Rather than a republican industrialism predicated on the diffusion of wealth and energy, the Report recommended policies to encourage the concentration of capital and its investment in large-scale manufacturing through the creation of subsidized corporate monopolies. To Hamilton's opponents, these “artificial” monopolies “would ruin private, ‘natural’ producers and foster dangerous, unrepublican disparities in wealth.” Indeed, many of them “came to fear nothing less than a conspiracy to corrupt American society and smash the republican experiment by imitating British forms, manners and institutions.” This same contest of world views was renewed ten years later when the revival of commercial tensions between America and Europe brought Congress “a deluge of petitions seeking public support of domestic manufactures.” Shrugging off bitter Federalist criticism, the Jeffersonians rejected the petitions, pointing the “excellent and extensive” achievements of the artisan trades and treating the virtual absence of larger-scale factory production of textiles and metal goods as a positive good. “We may felicitate ourselves that, by reason of the ease of gaining a subsistence and the high price of wages, our fellow-citizens born to happier destinies are not doomed to the wretchedness of a strict discipline in such manufactories.” See also McCoy, Elusive Republic, 148-65, 223-24.\n\n55. In the absence of a reliable and comprehensive statistical record, any statement about the frequency of industrial accidents during the first half of the nineteenth century must be treated as at best conjectural. The hazards of relying on employer records are especially obvious, given that for much of the first three decades of the nineteenth century in Massachusetts the notion of employment remained sufficiently ephemeral to preclude the development of any widespread sense of an employer's responsibility for employees. Wage labor was the exception rather than the rule, and those who performed labor for others (outside the patriarchal household of family, domestic servants, and apprentices) did so more often as self-employed, independent contractors serving customers than as employees. This tended to disengage the employer from the manner in which work was performed and therefore from any mishap which occurred during its performance. Even where wage labor was common, as in the construction trades, employers took steps to limit their involvement in large-scale direct employment of labor. Rather than create its own semi-permanent work force, for example, the Middlesex Canal Corporation attempted to subcontract most of the unskilled construction work to local farmers or to gangs of laborers who formed themselves more or less spontaneously to bid for digging by the road. Skilled work, particularly masonry, was also usually subcontracted to master artisans who supplied their own journeymen and assistants. Delays in completing sections of the work were often attributed to the absence of a pool of labor on call, but the practice of subcontracting had the valuable benefit of spreading the economic risks associated with the enterprise beyond the investors in the corporation. These forms of work organization make accidents particularly difficult to trace because there is no reason why injuries to employees of subcontractors or to members of gangs of laborers would show up in the primary contractor's records. Indirect confirmation of this can be gleaned from a letter from George Whistler, chief engineer of the Western Railroad Corporation, to the corporation's board in answer to a claim made by Elias Whipple of Springfield for compensation for the death of his son in a construction accident. The son, Whistler indicated, “was unfortunately killed while on the road as a hired laborer of the contractor… it has never been the custom elsewhere to my knowledge, for Railroad corporations to make provision, in cases of accident among these laborers.” See Whistler to the President and Directors, Western Railroad Corporation (8 June 1841), WRR Case 1, Clerk's Files. In O'Day, Edward J., “Constructing the Western Railroad: The Irish Dimension,” Historical Journal of Massachusetts 11, no. 1 (January 1893): 20–21Google Scholar.\n\n94. According to Dane, “The master of an apprentice is bound to pay for medical attendance on the apprentice, from the very nature of the relation between master and apprentice, and the father of the apprentice is only bound, when the services have been rendered at his request.” Dane emphasized the contrast with nonindentured labor. “As to hired servants, the employer is not bound to pay for medical attendance.” Abridgement, 9:35-36.\n\nThe provisions of the laws of settlement applying to the maintenance of indigent apprentices reinforce the conclusion that the legal responsibilities of the master to sick or injured apprentices were derived from a specific responsibility levied on masters to act in loco parentis, rather than from any general residual rights of servants. Unlike slaves, whose legal status denied them the right to a settlement of their own, apprentices did not acquire a derivative settlement through their masters but instead had their own settlement through their parents. This meant that where the maintenance of an apprentice was thrown into doubts by the pauperization of his master, the indenture was annulled and responsibility for care reverted to the apprentice's parents and thus ultimately to the community where they had their settlement. Prior to 1794, an apprentice deprived of maintenance by the death of his master could become the responsibility of the master's estate, to be maintained by the estate's executor until such time as his indenture was reassigned or the parties to the indenture agreed that it should be annulled. After 1794, however, the indenture was held to be annulled automatically by the master's death and the apprentice was returned to his parents or to the overseers of the poor to be bound out afresh. See The American Justice (an abridged edition of Burn's, Justice of the Peace) (Dover, N.H., 1792), 34–36Google Scholar; Mass. Stat.s (1793) c. 59, (1794) c. 64.\n\n95. In his classic Government and Labor in Early America (Boston, 1981Google Scholar), Richard B. Morris notes that in the case of indentured servants, as with slaves and apprentices, it was colonial policy to hold masters responsible for their welfare (18). Employers had no liability for unbound labor, however, the burden falling by default upon the town (in the case of Massachusetts) in which the accident or sickness occurred. Where the injured party was a stranger, the town would then attempt to determine where the injured person's settlement was and seek reimbursement. This was often a hopeless task, as is evidenced in the following petition of the Selectmen of the Town of Palmer (24 January 1767), Massachusetts Archives Collection, vol. 303, 128:\n\nTo His Excellency Francis Bernard Esq., Captain General and Governor in Chief over His Majesties Province of the Massachusetts Bay in New England &C, and to the Honorable His Majesties Counsell. The petition of William Scott, Seth Shaw and Robert Roggers, Selectmen and overseers of the poor of the District of Palmer Humbly sheweth. viz\n\nThat whereas one John Ryan, a Transient person not being an inhabitant of our District, nor having any regular place of abode in America that we know of: as he was passing threw our District was Hired to work one Day to assist in pulling down a bridge and to erect another: the bridge fell with him and others on it; and a large quantity of Heavy Timber fell on him: by which he was exceedingly bruised: and also Broke his arm: shoulder: collar bone and Ribs: by which means it Required our Emediate assistance to take Care of Him in his Destressed Condition which your Petitioners have done: and by Extraordinary Care and Expence he is Considerably Recovered and Likely to have the use of his Limbs to a Considerable degree; but is No way able to pay the Cost or ever likely to be able. Nor is there any other Town in America as we know of by Law liable to Reimburse the Cost of his Cure to us: and have no other Remedy but by applying to your Excelency and Honor that the same may be made a province charge.\n\n96. There was, however, one master-servant relation that did have this character and that, nevertheless, did not conform to the rule of self-reliance. Seamen who were injured in the service of their ship or who fell sick during its voyage were held entitled in maritime law to be cured at the ship's expense and to suffer no diminution of wages while incapacitated. Noting in Natterstrom v. The Hazard (1809) 17 Fed. Cas. 1243-50 that the entitlement was “occasionally questioned by ship owners and masters,” the Federal District Court for Massachusetts went to some pains to investigate the matter fully. It concluded, that the ancient maritime codes upon which American maritime law was based—the laws of Oleron, of Wisbuy, and of the Hanse Towns—“wisely and humanely calculated to sooth the sorrows of the sick or disabled mariner” by providing that he be cared for in the event of any calamity, and further that his disablement “should not diminish his stipulated wages, during the existence of his disability, or his necessary absence from the service of the ship from that cause.” The court noted that this was exceptional. “The application of the Roman law de locatione et conductione, to which Pothier expressly refers, for a construction of the contract of hiring of labour, in general, and for the hire of seamen, in particular, would exclude a claim for compensation during the disability of the servant or labourer.” But just as generous masters would not insist on a strict enforcement of their rights, but would continue to pay the wages of a sick servant notwithstanding his inability to perform his stipulated services, “so the law marine in relation to mariners converts into an obligation what, in other instances of hire, is the result of benevolence.” It did so, according to the court, “for the encouragement of seamen, and as a compensation for the risk which they run of an entire loss of wages, from inevitable accidents occurring to the ship, or from a destruction of the voyage.”\n\nThere were, however, relatively stringent limits to this obligation. First, the patry obliged to meet the expense of maintaining sick or disabled crew members was not the master or owner of the ship but the ship itself (see Dane, Abridgement, 9:202). To the extent that the ship and its cargo also represented the total available assets from which wages could be paid (see The Saratoga. —Keating, claimant. Circuit Court of the United States—Massachusetts [October 1814], reported in American Law Journal, 6 [1815]: 12–20Google Scholar), the expense of maintaining sick crew members was an operating expense shared by all rather than one borne exclusively by the owner. The analogy to the parish or town's obligation to maintain sick or injured servants is imperfect, but it would be incorrect to claim that in the case of seamen the obligation to maintain was exclusively a charge on their masters. Second, the obligation extended only to sickness or disabilities “not produced by [the seaman's] own criminality or fault.” (In Nathan Dane's version of this exclusion, the ship was not responsible for injuries caused by the “vicious or unjustifiable conduct” of a seaman. Abridgement, 2:480). In such circumstances, the seaman “is not entitled to his wages during the time he does no duty; and subsistence, during the same time, may be charged to him.” Finally, in the event of the death of a seaman in the service of the ship, no obligation was incurred to pay any form of compensation beyond what was owed to him in wages at the time of his death. Among all categories of hired labor, therefore, seamen alone appear as an exception to the common-law rule of self-reliance alleviated by an entitlement to relief by the community when rendered incapable; and even seamen were at best a qualified exception, one grounded in considerations of “policy.”\n\n156. That such self- and other-discipline were two sides of the same coin in Shaw's decision is confirmed by his reaction to Loring's attempt to distinguish Farwell's claim on the grounds that he and the switchman were employed in different departments. If employees were to be responsible for policing each other, Loring argued, that responsibility could extend only so far as their emjoyment of the means—notably the requisite knowledge—to do so. Shaw, however, refused to entertain the point. First, he challenged Loring on whether the different departments could in fact be distinguished from each other. “When the object to be a ccomplished is one and the same, when the employers are the same, and the several persons employed derive their authority and their compensation from the same source, it would be extremely difficult to distinguish, what constitutes one department and what a distinct department of duty. It would vary with the circumstances of every case.” But in any case, Shaw continued, Loring's distinction assumed a principle of employer responsibility which the court did not accept. “The exemption of the master … from liability for the negligence of a fellow servant, does not depend exclusively upon the consideration, that the servant has better means to provide for his own safety, but upon other grounds.” Those other grounds were the employee's contractual assumption of the risks of his employment. The master was exempt from liability “because the implied contract of the master does not extend to indemnify the servant against the negligence of any one but himself.” 45 Mass. 49, at 60–61. (Emphasis in original.)\n\n163. So far as the potential of respondeat superior is concerned, there is no evidence that the principle had ever been applied or even thought of as a rule of sufficient generality as to encompass the imputation of negligence to the employer in cases of injury occurring within an employment relationship. (Respondeat superior, as we have seen, was not invoked in Barnes, nor was it in Priestley v. Fowler). Indeed, earlynineteenth-century Massachusetts lawyers with an interest in the origins of this “ancient customary principle” might reasonably have been led to the conclusion that respondeat superior specifically excused the master from liability for injuries done by one servant to another. In 1808, the American Law Journal, published in Boston and Philadelphia, carried a translation of those elements of Justinian's Pandects that dealt with the responsibilities of masters of ships and of inn- and stablekeepers. “The master must answer for the acts of all his mariners, whether slaves or freemen” indicted the Journal, translating from the eighteenth book of Ulpian; “and it is very proper he should answer, as he himself appoints them.” But “he does not answer further than for damage done on board of his vessel; and he is not to answer for any thing done out of the vessel although by mariners.” And crucially, “if the mariners occasion damage to each other, no action lies against the master.” American Law Journal 1, no. 4 (1808): 496Google Scholar.\n\nThe argument that in industrial accident cases judges had to confront respondeat superior as relevant doctrine to be distinguished—or that in Farwell, as Horwitz would have it, the court was spared the necessity of so doing only because of Loring's ineptitude—grows out of the assumption that these cases were part of a larger trend in legal development in which a judiciary sympathetic toward entrepreneurial capitalism reacted to the increasing incidence of tort claims accompanying the industrialization of the northeastern economy by radically diluting preindustrial principles of strict liability through the introduction of liability-limiting criteria such as the fault principle. As I indicated in the introduction to this paper, however, recent research has suggested that injurious behavior in the preindustrial era was governed not by principles of strict liability but by an assumption of no-liability outside carefully demarcated areas. Seen from this perspective, respondeat superior appears less as the doctrinal expression in master-servant relations of wide-ranging, strict-liability assumptions than as one of a limited number of carefully policed enclaves existing in a predominantly no-liability world. Into this enclave the courts admitted injuries suffered by strangers at the hands of servants if the consequence of acts expressly or implicitly commanded by the master and occurring within the usual course of his business, but not injuries judged to be the consequence of a servant's “wilful” acts. (Given that the courts' definition of wilful action could extend to any act the performance of which was not involuntary or uncoerced, the realm of potentially uncompensated injuries was left wide indeed). A master was also held liable where an injury appeared to be the result of negligence or want of skill on the part of a servant, “because it was a neglect and fault in the master to appoint a careless and negligent person to do his business.” As Nathan Dane indicted, however, there was no guarantee that the principle would extend liability to masters if they could show that the servant they had appointed had otherwise exhibited a “good and faithful character,” for it had never been settled “how far one negligent act, as the one complained of, is conclusive evidence of a negligent character in the servant.” See Dane, , Abridgement, vol. 2, 495Google Scholar, and generally 315–16, 494–95. Even in third-party relations, therefore, respondeat superior did not render the master automatically liable for any injury resulting from his servant's negligence. Rather, the liability of the master was on account of his own fault in appointing an insufficient servant, and might be avoided by demonstrating due care in the choice of the servant."
