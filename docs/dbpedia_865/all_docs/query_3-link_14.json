J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2024;2024(65):168-179. doi:10.1093/jncimonographs/lgae013\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Precision medicine has become a mainstay of cancer care in recent years. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program has been an authoritative source of cancer statistics and data since 1973. However, tumor genomic information has not been adequately captured in the cancer surveillance data, which impedes population-based research on molecular subtypes. To address this, the SEER Program has developed and implemented a centralized process to link SEER registries' tumor cases with genomic test results that are provided by molecular laboratories to the registries.\n\nMethods: Data linkages were carried out following operating procedures for centralized linkages established by the SEER Program. The linkages used Match*Pro, a probabilistic linkage software, and were facilitated by the registries' trusted third party (an honest broker). The SEER registries provide to NCI limited datasets that undergo preliminary evaluation prior to their release to the research community.\n\nResults: Recently conducted genomic linkages included OncotypeDX Breast Recurrence Score, OncotypeDX Breast Ductal Carcinoma in Situ, OncotypeDX Genomic Prostate Score, Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier, DecisionDX Uveal Melanoma, DecisionDX Preferentially Expressed Antigen in Melanoma, DecisionDX Melanoma, and germline tests results in Georgia and California SEER registries.\n\nConclusions: The linkages of cancer cases from SEER registries with genomic test results obtained from molecular laboratories offer an effective approach for data collection in cancer surveillance. By providing de-identified data to the research community, the NCI's SEER Program enables scientists to investigate numerous research inquiries.\n\nStuteville H, et al. An analysis of clinical outcomes of exploratory pediatric metformin ingestions reported to the Texas poison center network from 2011 to 2021. Hosp Pharm. 2024;59(4):465-470. doi:10.1177/00185787241230628\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Poison centers develop triage threshold guidelines for pediatric metformin ingestions. Our network uses 1700 mg, or 85 mg/kg.\n\nObjective: To describe the dose, clinical course, and outcomes for inadvertent metformin ingestions in children 5 years old and younger reported to our statewide poison center network.\n\nMethods: We searched the poison center database 2011 to 2021 for metformin ingestions in patients 5 years and younger. Variables included age, sex, weight, dose, symptoms, outcome, and more. We used descriptive statistics with medians and interquartile ranges (IQR) for continuous variables.\n\nResults: Of 669 cases, exposures by age were 208 (31.1%) 1 to 2 years, and 275 (41.1%) 2 years. Weight was recorded in 342 (51.1%) (median 13.5 kg; IQR: 3.7 kg), and dose in 149 (22.3%) (median 500 mg; IQR: 500 mg). Milligram/kilogram values were available for 103 (15.4%) with median 42.4 mg/kg, IQR: 39 mg/kg. Most (647, 98.5%) exposures were unintentional. Most (445/669, 66.5%) were managed at a non-healthcare facility, while 204 (30.7%) were already at or referred to a healthcare facility. Of these 204 patients, 169 (82.8%) were evaluated and treated at the emergency department and discharged. Four (2%) were admitted to critical care, and 7 (3.4%) to the ward. Medical outcomes by effect were 5 (0.7%) minor, 2 (0.3%) moderate, 253 (37.8%) none, 292 (43.6%) not followed (minimal effects possible), and no major effects or deaths. Of 20 clinical occurrences reported, vomiting was most common (8, 1.2%).\n\nConclusion: Despite little recorded dosage information, pediatric metformin ingestions under 85 mg/kg had predominantly uneventful medical outcomes.\n\nMerengwa E, et al. Clusters of emerging multidrug-resistant organisms in US health care facilities during the initial months of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Am J Infect Control. Published online July 30, 2024. doi:10.1016/j.ajic.2024.07.013\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Outbreaks of emerging multidrug-resistant organisms (eMDROs), including carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii, and Candida auris, have been reported among severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) patients. We describe eMDRO clusters in SARS-CoV-2 units and associated infection control (IC) practices early in the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.\n\nMethods: We conducted a retrospective survey of a convenience sample of health departments in 11 states to describe clusters of eMDROs that began before November 1, 2020 and involved SARS-CoV-2 units. Cluster characteristics and IC practices during the cluster period were assessed using a standardized outbreak report form, and descriptive analyses were performed.\n\nResults: Overall, 18 eMDRO clusters (10 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, 6 C auris, 1 carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 1 carbapenem-resistant A baumannii) in 18 health care facilities involving 397 patients were reported from 10 states. During the cluster period, 60% of facilities reported a shortage of isolation gowns, 69% extended use of gowns, and 67% reported difficulty obtaining preferred disinfectants. Reduced frequency of hand hygiene audits was reported in 85% of acute care hospitals during the cluster period compared with before the pandemic.\n\nConclusions: Changes in IC practices and supply shortages were identified in facilities with eMDRO outbreaks during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and might have contributed to eMDRO transmission.\n\nShumate CJ, et al. Demographic differences and potential bias from automated occupation coding among mothers of babies born with or without cleft lip and/or cleft palate in the Texas Birth Defects Registry. J Occup Environ Med. Published online July 16, 2024. doi:10.1097/JOM.0000000000003189\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective: To compare maternal demographics based on occupation coding status and evaluate potential bias by excluding manually coded occupations.\n\nMethods: This case-control study assessed cases with clefts obtained from the Texas Birth Defects Registry. The NIOSH Industry and Occupation Computerized Coding System automatically coded occupations, with manual coding for unclassified cases. Maternal demographics were tabulated by occupation coding status (manual vs. automatic). Logistic regression examined associations between major occupation groups and clefts.\n\nResults: Automatic coding covered over 90% of all mothers. Building, grounds cleaning, and maintenance occupations, and office and administrative support occupations were significantly associated with cleft lip with or without cleft palate, even after excluding manually coded occupations.\n\nConclusion: We found consistent associations before and after excluding manually coded data for most comparisons, suggesting that machine learning can facilitate occupation-related birth defects research.\n\nArcher NP, Drummond-Borg M, Freedenberg D, Shumate C, Langlois PH, Canfield MA, et al. Newborn screening analytes and structural birth defects among 27,000 newborns. PLoS One. 2024;19(7):e0304238. Published 2024 Jul 5. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0304238\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Emerging evidence suggests newborn screening analytes may yield insights into the etiologies of birth defects, yet no effort has evaluated associations between a range of newborn screening analytes and birth defects.\n\nMethods: This population-based study pooled statewide data on birth defects, birth certificates, and newborn screening analytes from Texas occurring between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2009. Associations between a panel of thirty-six newborn screening analytes, collected by the statewide Texas Newborn Screening Program, and the presence of a birth defect, defined as at least one of 39 birth defects diagnoses recorded by the Texas Birth Defects Registry, were assessed using regression analysis.\n\nFindings: Of the 27,643 births identified, 20,205 had at least one of the 39 birth defects of interest (cases) as identified by the Texas Birth Defects Registry, while 7,438 did not have a birth defect (controls). Among 1,404 analyte-birth defect associations evaluated, 377 were significant in replication analysis. Analytes most consistently associated with birth defects included the phenylalanine/tyrosine ratio (N = 29 birth defects), tyrosine (N = 28 birth defects), and thyroxine (N = 25 birth defects). Birth defects most frequently associated with a range of analytes included gastroschisis (N = 29 analytes), several cardiovascular defects (N = 26 analytes), and spina bifida (N = 23 analytes).\n\nConclusions: Several significant and novel associations were observed between newborn screening analytes and birth defects. While some findings could be consequences of the defects themselves or to the care provided to infants with these defects, these findings could help to elucidate mechanisms underlying the etiology of some birth defects.\n\nMiller P, et al. Cancers with epidemiologic signatures of viral oncogenicity among immunocompromised populations in the United States. J Natl Cancer Inst. Published online July 2, 2024. doi:10.1093/jnci/djae159\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Immunosuppressed individuals have elevated risk of virus-related cancers. Identifying cancers with elevated risk in people with HIV (PWH) and solid organ transplant recipients (SOTRs), two immunosuppressed populations, may help identify novel etiologic relationships with infectious agents.\n\nMethods: We utilized two linkages of population-based cancer registries with HIV and transplant registries in the United States. Cancer entities were systematically classified based on site and histology codes. Standardized incidence ratios (SIRs) were used to compare risk in PWH and SOTRs with the general population. For selected cancer entities, incidence rate ratios (IRRs) were calculated for indicators of immunosuppression within each population.\n\nFindings: We identified 38,047 cancer cases in SOTRs and 53,592 in PWH, yielding overall SIRs of 1.66 (95%CI = 1.65-1.68) and 1.49 (95%CI = 1.47-1.50), respectively. Forty-three cancer entities met selection criteria, including conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) (PWH SIR = 7.1, 95%CI = 5.5-9.2; SOTRs SIR = 9.4; 95%CI = 6.8-12.6). Sebaceous adenocarcinoma was elevated in SOTRs (SIR = 16.2; 95%CI = 14.0-18.6) and, among SOTRs, associated with greater risk in lung/heart transplant recipients compared to recipients of other organs (IRR = 2.3; 95%CI = 1.7-3.2). Salivary gland tumors, malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma showed elevated risk in SOTRs (SIR = 3.9; SIR = 4.7; and SIR = 3.2, respectively) but not in PWH. However, risks for these cancers were elevated following an AIDS diagnosis among PWH (IRR = 2.4; IRR = 4.3; and IRR = 2.0, respectively).\n\nInterpretation: Elevated SIRs among SOTRs and PWH, and associations with immunosuppression within these populations, suggest novel infectious causes for several cancers including conjunctival SCC, sebaceous adenocarcinoma, salivary gland tumors, MFH, and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.\n\nSinger R, Williams C, Nwanguma A, et al. Determining barriers to submitting antimicrobial-resistant isolates among hospitals in Texas Public Health Region 8. J Infect Prev. 2024;25(4):120-125. doi:10.1177/17571774241235101\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: The Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network (AR Lab Network) was developed by the CDC to detect emerging antimicrobial-resistant (AR) threats and prevent outbreaks. However, low submission rates of AR isolates limit the potential of the AR Lab Network to address antimicrobial resistance (AMR).\n\nAim: The aim of this study was to investigate barriers to submission of AR isolates in acute care hospitals (ACHs) and critical access hospitals (CAHs) within Texas Public Health Region 8 (PHR8) counties.\n\nMethods: A survey was designed and emailed to laboratory professionals to identify barriers to AR isolate submission. Responses were analyzed using 2-sided Fisher's exact tests to identify associations between responses and respondent characteristics.\n\nResults: Of the 33 hospitals within PHR8 invited to participate in the survey, responses were received from 21, a response rate of 63.6%. Lack of awareness of the AR Lab Network was the most frequently cited barrier to submission (65.4% of respondents). Other reported barriers to submission included lack of laboratory staff time (57.7%), lack of training with the submission process (34.6%), lack of personnel certified to ship infectious substances (23.1%), and lack of laboratory/shipping supplies (23.1%).\n\nCanfield MA, et al. A multicountry analysis of prevalence and mortality among neonates and children with bladder exstrophy. Am J Perinatol. 2024 Jul;41(9):1143-1154. doi:10.1055/s-0042-1748318. Epub 2022 May 29.\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective: Bladder exstrophy (BE) is a rare but severe birth defect affecting the lower abdominal wall and genitourinary system. The objective of the study is to examine the total prevalence, trends in prevalence, and age-specific mortality among individuals with BE.\n\nStudy design: We conducted a retrospective cohort study. Data were analyzed from 20 birth defects surveillance programs, members of the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research in 16 countries. Live births, stillbirths, and elective terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly (ETOPFA) diagnosed with BE from 1974 to 2014. Pooled and program-specific prevalence of BE per 100,000 total births was calculated. The 95% confidence intervals (CI) for prevalence were estimated using Poisson approximation of binomial distribution. Time trends in prevalence of BE from 2000 to 2014 were examined using Poisson regression. Proportion of deaths among BE cases was calculated on the day of birth, day 2 to 6, day 7 to 27, day 28 to 364, 1 to 4 years, and ≥5 years. Mortality analysis was stratified by isolated, multiple, and syndromic case status.\n\nResults: The pooled total prevalence of BE was 2.58 per 100,000 total births (95% CI = 2.40, 2.78) for study years 1974 to 2014. Prevalence varied over time with a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2014. The first-week mortality proportion was 3.5, 17.3, and 14.6% among isolated, multiple, and syndromic BE cases, respectively. The majority of first-week mortality occurred on the first day of life among isolated, multiple, and syndromic BE cases. The proportion of first-week deaths was higher among cases reported from programs in Latin America where ETOPFA services were not available.\n\nConclusion: Prevalence of BE varied by program and showed a decreasing trend from 2000 to -2014. Mortality is a concern among multiple and syndromic cases, and a high proportion of deaths among cases occurred during the first week of life.\n\nMagee C, Browning C, Stokes-Walters R, Maxwell L, Buendia J, Bhakta N. Supporting local public health and planning professionals to implement built environment changes: a technical assistance program to promote physical activity in Texas. Prev Chronic Dis. 2024 Jun 20;21:E45. doi:10.5888/pcd21.230420.\n\nBuilt environment approaches that improve active transportation infrastructure and environmental design can increase physical activity. Funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Texas Department of State Health Services rejuvenated the Texas Plan4Health program from 2018 to 2023 to expand such approaches in Texas by providing technical assistance to teams of local public health professionals and planners to identify and implement projects connecting people to everyday destinations via active transport in their communities. However, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted Texas Plan4Health to modify the delivery of technical assistance to accommodate restrictions on travel and in-person gatherings. We used qualitative methods to conduct a postintervention process evaluation to describe the modified technical assistance process, understand the experiences of the 4 participating communities, and identify short-term outcomes and lessons learned. Texas Plan4Health helped communities overcome common barriers to built environment change, facilitated collaboration across community public health and planning professionals, and educated professionals about active transportation infrastructure and the relationship between their disciplines, thereby increasing community capacity to implement built environment improvements. This outcome, however, was mediated by the pre-existing resources and previous experiences with active transportation planning among the participating communities. Public health practitioners seeking to improve active transportation infrastructure and environmental design for physical activity should consider community-engaged approaches that advance partnership-building and collaborative experiential education among public health, planning, and other local government representatives, directing particular attention and additional training toward communities with fewer resources.\n\nShetty V, Rollo SN, Martinez DL, Raj S, Gonzales ER, et al. Highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus infection in a dairy farm worker. N Engl J Med. 2024 Jun 6;390(21):2028-2029. doi:10.1056/NEJMc2405371.\n\nTo the Editor:\n\nSporadic human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) A(H5N1) virus, with a wide spectrum of clinical severity and a cumulative case fatality of more than 50%, have been reported in 23 countries over more than 20 years.1 HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses have spread widely among wild birds worldwide since 2020–2021,2,3 resulting in outbreaks in poultry and other animals.2 Recently, HPAI A(H5N1) clade 2.3.4.4b viruses were identified in dairy cows, and in unpasteurized milk samples, in multiple U.S. states.4,5 We report a case of HPAI A(H5N1) virus infection in a dairy farm worker in Texas.\n\nMarengo LK, et al. Prevalence and descriptive epidemiology of choanal atresia and stenosis in Texas, 1999-2018. Am J Med Genet A. 2024 Jun;194(6):e63549. doi:10.1002/ajmg.a.63549. Epub 2024 Feb 5.\n\nAbstract\n\nChoanal atresia and stenosis are common causes of congenital nasal obstruction, but their epidemiology is poorly understood. Compared to bilateral choanal atresia/stenosis, unilateral choanal atresia/stenosis is generally diagnosed later and might be under-ascertained in birth defect registries. Data from the population-based Texas Birth Defects Registry and Texas vital records, 1999-2018, were used to assess the prevalence of choanal atresia/stenosis. Poisson regression models were used to evaluate associations with infant and maternal characteristics in two analytic groups: isolated choanal atresia/stenosis (n = 286) and isolated, bilateral choanal atresia/stenosis (n = 105). The overall prevalence of choanal atresia/stenosis was 0.92/10,000, and the prevalence of isolated choanal atresia/stenosis was 0.37/10,000 livebirths. Variables associated with choanal atresia/stenosis in one or both analytic groups included infant sex, pregnancy plurality, maternal race/ethnicity, maternal age, and maternal residence on the Texas-Mexico border. In general, adjusted prevalence ratios estimated from the two analytic groups were in the same direction but tended to be stronger in the analyses restricted to isolated, bilateral defects. Epidemiologic studies of isolated choanal atresia/stenosis should consider focusing on cases with bilateral defects, and prioritizing analyses of environmental, social, and structural factors that could account for the association with maternal residence on the Texas-Mexico border.\n\nNguyen JM, Drummond-Borg M, et al. Classification of isolated versus multiple birth defects: An automated process for population-based registries. Am J Med Genet A. 2024 May 21:e63714. doi:10.1002/ajmg.a.63714. Epub ahead of print.\n\nAbstract\n\nEpidemiologic studies of birth defects often conduct separate analyses for cases that have isolated defects (e.g., spina bifida only) and cases that have multiple defects (e.g., spina bifida and a congenital heart defect). However, in some instances, cases with additional defects (e.g., spina bifida and clubfoot) may be more appropriately considered as isolated because the co-occurring defect (clubfoot) is believed to be developmentally related to the defect of interest. Determining which combinations should be considered isolated can be challenging and potentially resource intensive for registries. Thus, we developed automated classification procedures for differentiating between isolated versus multiple defects, while accounting for developmentally related defects, and applied the approach to data from the Texas Birth Defects Registry (1999-2018 deliveries). Among 235,544 nonsyndromic cases in Texas, 89% of cases were classified as having isolated defects, with proportions ranging from 25% to 92% across 43 specific defects analyzed. A large proportion of isolated cases with spina bifida (44%), lower limb reduction defects (44%), and holoprosencephaly (32%) had developmentally related defects. Overall, our findings strongly support the need to account for isolated versus multiple defects in risk factor association analyses and to account for developmentally related defects when doing so, which has implications for interpreting prior studies.\n\nShuford JA, Pont SJ, et al. Baseline characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine non-responders in a large population-based sample. PLoS One. 2024;19(5):e0303420. Published 2024 May 13. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0303420\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction: Studies indicate that individuals with chronic conditions and specific baseline characteristics may not mount a robust humoral antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. In this paper, we used data from the Texas Coronavirus Antibody REsponse Survey (Texas CARES), a longitudinal state-wide seroprevalence program that has enrolled more than 90,000 participants, to evaluate the role of chronic diseases as the potential risk factors of non-response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in a large epidemiologic cohort.\n\nMethods: A participant needed to complete an online survey and a blood draw to test for SARS-CoV-2 circulating plasma antibodies at four-time points spaced at least three months apart. Chronic disease predictors of vaccine non-response are evaluated using logistic regression with non-response as the outcome and each chronic disease + age as the predictors.\n\nResults: As of April 24, 2023, 18,240 participants met the inclusion criteria; 0.58% (N = 105) of these are non-responders. Adjusting for age, our results show that participants with self-reported immunocompromised status, kidney disease, cancer, and \"other\" non-specified comorbidity were 15.43, 5.11, 2.59, and 3.13 times more likely to fail to mount a complete response to a vaccine, respectively. Furthermore, having two or more chronic diseases doubled the prevalence of non-response.\n\nConclusion: Consistent with smaller targeted studies, a large epidemiologic cohort bears the same conclusion and demonstrates immunocompromised, cancer, kidney disease, and the number of diseases are associated with vaccine non-response. This study suggests that those individuals, with chronic diseases with the potential to affect their immune system response, may need increased doses or repeated doses of COVID-19 vaccines to develop a protective antibody level.\n\nStuteville H, et al. Fasciotomy following North American pit viper envenomation in Texas 2004-2021. Clin Toxicol (Phila). 2024;62(5):314-321. doi:10.1080/15563650.2024.2338559\n\nAbstract\n\nIntroduction: North American pit viper envenomation occurs over 4,000 times annually in the United States, with polyvalent Fab antivenom being the primary treatment. Fasciotomy is occasionally performed due to concerns about compartment syndrome. We utilized our direct access to Texas Poison Center Network data to create a new snakebite abstraction form and database on relevant available information between 2004 and 2021 and to identify, describe, and estimate the incidence of fasciotomy following pit viper envenomation in Texas.\n\nMethods: We searched the Texas Poison Center Network database for cases during 2004-2021 using keywords such as fasciotomy, surgery, compartment pressure, and compartment syndrome. Descriptive statistics summarized the data.\n\nResults: Of 16,911 reported envenomations, 0.69 percent involved fasciotomies (n = 117). Most common bite sites were digits/hands and lower extremities. Patients who underwent fasciotomy were typically male, aged 20-59, and 10 years younger than the total snakebite population. Only 6 percent of reported compartment syndrome cases had a compartment pressure measurement. Antivenom was administered in 101 (86.3 percent) cases, 92 (91.1 percent) of which received only Fab antivenom product. Patients with bites from rattlesnakes (47.9 percent) were associated with most fasciotomies.\n\nDiscussion: Our findings suggest a potential increase in snakebite exposures, accompanied by a decrease in fasciotomies. Overall, copperheads constituted the majority of snakebites, but most fasciotomies were from rattlesnake envenomations (47.9 percent). In this cohort, compartment syndrome diagnosis and decisions regarding fasciotomy were primarily based on clinical evaluation/surgeon expertise without compartment pressure measurements. Despite the efficacy of antivenom, only 86.3 percent of patients in our study received antivenom.\n\nConclusions: Fasciotomy after North American pit viper envenomation in Texas is uncommon (0.69 percent) and has decreased over time, possibly due to increased antivenom use or surgeon comfort with nonsurgical management.\n\nNash N, et al. Provider perspectives: identification and follow-up of infants who are deaf or hard of hearing. Am J Perinatol. 2024;41(S 01):e694-e710. doi:10.1055/a-1932-9985\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective: Without timely screening, diagnosis, and intervention, hearing loss can cause significant delays in a child's speech, language, social, and emotional development. In 2019, Texas had nearly twice the average rate of loss to follow-up (LFU) or loss to documentation (LTD; i.e., missing documentation of services received) among infants who did not pass their newborn hearing screening compared to the United States overall (51.1 vs. 27.5%). We aimed to identify factors contributing to LFU/LTD among infants who do not pass their newborn hearing screening in Texas.\n\nStudy design: Data were collected through semistructured qualitative interviews with 56 providers along the hearing care continuum, including hospital newborn hearing screening program staff, audiologists, primary care physicians, and early intervention (EI) program staff located in three rural and urban public health regions in Texas. Following recording and transcription of the interviews, we used qualitative data analysis software to analyze themes using a conventional content analysis approach.\n\nResults: Frequently cited barriers included problems with family access to care, difficulty contacting patients, problems with communication between providers and referrals, lack of knowledge among providers and parents, and problems using the online reporting system. Providers in rural areas more often mentioned problems with family access to care and contacting families compared to providers in urban areas.\n\nConclusion: These findings provide insight into strategies that public health professionals and health care providers can use to work together to help further increase the number of children identified early who may benefit from EI services.\n\nYoo K, et al.

Direct potable reuse and birth defects prevalence in Texas: An augmented synthetic control method analysis of data from a population-based birth defects registry. Environ Epidemiol. 2024;8(2):e300. Published 2024 Mar 18. doi:10.1097/EE9.0000000000000300\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Direct potable reuse (DPR) involves adding purified wastewater that has not passed through an environmental buffer into a water distribution system. DPR may help address water shortages and is approved or is under consideration as a source of drinking water for several water-stressed population centers in the United States, however, there are no studies of health outcomes in populations who receive DPR drinking water. Our objective was to determine whether the introduction of DPR for certain public water systems in Texas was associated with changes in birth defect prevalence\n\nMethods: We obtained data on maternal characteristics for all live births and birth defects cases regardless of pregnancy outcome in Texas from 2003 to 2017 from the Texas Birth Defects Registry and birth and fetal death records. The ridge augmented synthetic control method was used to model changes in birth defect prevalence (per 10,000 live births) following the adoption of DPR by four Texas counties in mid-2013, with county-level data on maternal age, percent women without a high school diploma, percent who identified as Hispanic/Latina or non-Hispanic/Latina Black, and rural-urban continuum code as covariates.\n\nResults: There were nonstatistically significant increases in prevalence of all birth defects collectively (average treatment effect in the treated = 53.6) and congenital heart disease (average treatment effect in the treated = 287.3) since June 2013. The estimated prevalence of neural tube defects was unchanged.\n\nConclusions: We estimated nonstatistically significant increases in birth defect prevalence following the implementation of DPR in four West Texas counties. Further research is warranted to inform water policy decisions.\n\nPont SJ, et al. Prozone masks elevated SARS-CoV-2 antibody level measurements. PLoS One. 2024;19(3):e0301232. Published 2024 Mar 28.\n\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0301232\n\nAbstract\n\nWe report a prozone effect in measurement of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody levels from an antibody surveillance program. Briefly, the prozone effect occurs in immunoassays when excessively high antibody concentration disrupts the immune complex formation, resulting in a spuriously low reported result. Following participant inquiries, we observed anomalously low measurement of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein antibody levels using the Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S immunoassay from participants in the Texas Coronavirus Antibody Research survey (Texas CARES), an ongoing prospective, longitudinal antibody surveillance program. In July, 2022, samples were collected from ten participants with anomalously low results for serial dilution studies, and a prozone effect was confirmed. From October, 2022 to March, 2023, serial dilution of samples detected 74 additional cases of prozone out of 1,720 participants' samples. Prozone effect may affect clinical management of at-risk populations repeatedly exposed to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein through multiple immunizations or serial infections, making awareness and mitigation of this issue paramount.\n\nSalinas V, Bojes HK, et al. Influences of 23 different equations used to calculate gene copies of SARS-CoV-2 during wastewater-based epidemiology. Sci Total Environ. 2024;917:170345. doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170345\n\nAbstract\n\nFollowing the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in late 2019, the use of wastewater-based surveillance (WBS) has increased dramatically along with associated infrastructure globally. However, due to the global nature of its application, and various workflow adaptations (e.g., sample collection, water concentration, RNA extraction kits), numerous methods for back-calculation of gene copies per volume (gc/L) of sewage have also emerged. Many studies have considered the comparability of processing methods (e.g., water concentration, RNA extraction); however, for equations used to calculate gene copies in a wastewater sample and subsequent influences on monitoring viral trends in a community and its association with epidemiological data, less is known. Due to limited information on how many formulas exist for the calculation of SARS-CoV-2 gene copies in wastewater, we initially attempted to quantify how many equations existed in the referred literature. We identified 23 unique equations, which were subsequently applied to an existing wastewater dataset. We observed a range of gene copies based on use of different equations, along with variability of AUC curve values, and results from correlation and regression analyses. Though a number of individual laboratories appear to have independently converged on a similar formula for back-calculation of viral load in wastewater, and share similar relationships with epidemiological data, differential influences of various equations were observed for variation in PCR volumes, RNA extraction volumes, or PCR assay parameters. Such observations highlight challenges when performing comparisons among WBS studies when numerous methodologies and back-calculation methods exist. To facilitate reproducibility among studies, the different gc/L equations were packaged as an R Shiny app, which provides end users the ability to investigate variability within their datasets and support comparisons among studies.\n\nMundis SJ, et al. The L1014F knockdown resistance mutation is not a strong correlate of phenotypic resistance to pyrethroids in Florida populations of Culex quinquefasciatus. Insects. 2024;15(3):197. Published 2024 Mar 15. doi:10.3390/insects15030197\n\nAbstract\n\nCulex quinquefasciatus is an important target for vector control because of its ability to transmit pathogens that cause disease. Most populations are resistant to pyrethroids and often to organophosphates, the two most common classes of active ingredients used by public health agencies. A knockdown resistance (kdr) mutation, resulting in an amino acid change from a leucine to phenylalanine in the voltage gated sodium channel, is one mechanism contributing to the pyrethroid resistant phenotype. Enzymatic resistance has also been shown to play a very important role. Recent studies have shown strong resistance in populations even when kdr is relatively low, which indicates that factors other than kdr may be larger contributors to resistance. In this study, we examined, on a statewide scale (over 70 populations), the strength of the correlation between resistance in the CDC bottle bioassay and the kdr genotypes and allele frequencies. Spearman correlation analysis showed only moderate (-0.51) or weak (-0.29) correlation between the kdr genotype and permethrin or deltamethrin resistance, respectively. The frequency of the kdr allele was an even weaker correlate than genotype. These results indicate that assessing kdr in populations of Culex quinquefasciatus is not a good surrogate for phenotypic resistance testing.\n\nPatel K, et al. Descriptive summary of fatal work-related injuries, Western States, 2011-2017. J Occup Environ Hyg. 2024 Mar;21(3):189-201. Epub 2024 Feb 26. doi:10.1080/15459624.2024.2302470\n\nAbstract\n\nWork-related deaths are a persistent occupational health issue that can be prevented. However, prevention opportunities can be hampered by a lack of adequate public health resources. The Western States Occupational Network (WestON) is a network of federal, state, and local occupational health professionals that includes a 19-state region of the United States. To encourage public health collaboration, WestON partners examined work-related fatalities within the region. Fatality counts (numerators) were obtained from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries restricted-access research files for all workers ages ≥15 years and fatally injured in WestON states from 2011 through 2017. Estimates of full-time equivalent hours worked (FTE) (denominators) were retrieved from the BLS Current Population Survey. Annual average fatality rates were calculated as number of fatalities per 100,000 FTE over the study period. Rates were stratified by state, select demographics, industry sector, and event/exposure types. Pearson chi-squared tests and rate ratios with 95% confidence probability limits were used to assess rate differences. All analyses were conducted using SAS v.9.4. From 2011 through 2017, the annual average overall occupational fatality rate for the WestON region was 3.5 fatalities per 100,000 FTE, comparable to the overall U.S. fatality rate. Male workers had a fatality rate almost 10 times higher than female workers in the region. Fatality rates increased with successive age groups. Alaska and New Mexico had significantly higher fatality rates for all racial/ethnic groups compared to respective regional rates. Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana had the three highest occupational fatality rates among foreign-born workers. Agriculture/forestry/fishing, mining/oil/gas extraction, and transportation/warehousing/utilities were industry sector groups with the three highest fatality rates regionally. Transportation-related incidents were the most frequent event type associated with occupational fatalities for all 19 states. Work-related fatalities are a crosscutting occupational public health priority. This analysis can be an impetus for collaborative multistate initiatives among a dynamic and varied occupational public health network to better meet the needs of a rapidly changing workforce.\n\nMiller P, et al. Real-world use of antiretroviral therapy and risk of cancer among people with HIV in Texas. AIDS. 2024 Mar 1;38(3):379-386. Epub 2023 Nov 22. doi:10.1097/QAD.0000000000003770\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) may reduce cancer risk among people with HIV (PWH), but cancer-specific associations are incompletely understood.\n\nMethods: We linked HIV and cancer registries in Texas to a national prescription claims database. cART use was quantified as the proportion of days covered (PDC). Cox proportional hazards models assessed associations of cancer risk with cART usage, adjusting for demographic characteristics, AIDS status, and time since HIV report.\n\nResults: We evaluated 63 694 PWH followed for 276 804 person-years. The median cART PDC was 21.4% (interquartile range: 0.0-59.8%). cART use was associated with reduced risk of Kaposi sarcoma [adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 0.48, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.34-0.68 relative to unexposed status] and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aHR 0.41, 95% CI 0.31-0.53), liver cancer (aHR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.96), anal cancer (aHR 0.65, 95% CI 0.46-0.92), and a miscellaneous group of 'other' cancers (aHR 0.80, 95% CI 0.66-0.98). In contrast, cART-exposed status was not associated with risk for cervical, lung, colorectal, prostate or breast cancers.\n\nConclusion: In a large HIV cohort incorporating data from prescription claims, cART was associated with greatly reduced risks of Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and to a lesser degree, reduced risks of liver and anal cancers. These associations likely reflect the beneficial effects of HIV suppression and improved immune control of oncogenic viruses. Efforts to increase cART use and adherence may further decrease cancer incidence among PWH.\n\nLee R, Wang C, et al. Descriptive analysis of targeted carbapenemase genes and antibiotic susceptibility profiles among carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii tested in the Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory Network-United States, 2017-2020. Microbiol Spectr. 2024 Feb 6;12(2):e0282823. Epub 2024 Jan 4. doi:10.1128/spectrum.02828-23\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has classified CRAB as an urgent public health threat. In this paper, we used a collection of >6,000 contemporary clinical isolates to evaluate the phenotypic and genotypic properties of CRAB detected in the United States. We describe the frequency of specific carbapenemase genes detected, antimicrobial susceptibility profiles, and the distribution of CRAB isolates categorized as multidrug resistant, extensively drug-resistant, or difficult to treat. We further discuss the proportion of isolates showing susceptibility to Food and Drug Administration-approved agents. Of note, 84% of CRAB tested harbored at least one class A, B, or D carbapenemase genes targeted for detection and 83% of these carbapenemase gene-positive CRAB were categorized as extensively drug resistant. Fifty-four percent of CRAB isolates without any of these carbapenemase genes detected were still extensively drug-resistant, indicating that infections caused by CRAB are highly resistant and pose a significant risk to patient safety regardless of the presence of one of these carbapenemase genes.\n\nCanfield MA, et al. Gastroschisis prevalence patterns in 27 surveillance programs from 24 countries, International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research, 1980-2017. Birth Defects Res. 2024 Feb;116(2):e2306. doi:10.1002/bdr2.2306\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Gastroschisis is a serious birth defect with midgut prolapse into the amniotic cavity. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the prevalence and time trends of gastroschisis among programs in the International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR), focusing on regional variations and maternal age changes in the population.\n\nMethods: We analyzed data on births from 1980 to 2017 from 27 ICBDSR member programs, representing 24 countries and three regions (Europe+ (includes Iran) , Latin America, North America). Cases were identified using diagnostic codes (i.e., 756.7, 756.71, or Q79.3). We excluded cases of amniotic band syndrome, limb-body wall defect, and ruptured omphalocele. Programs provided annual counts for gastroschisis cases (live births, stillbirths, and legally permitted pregnancy terminations for fetal anomalies) and source population (live births, stillbirths), by maternal age.\n\nResults: Overall, gastroschisis occurred in 1 of every 3268 births (3.06 per 10,000 births; 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 3.01, 3.11), with marked regional variation. European+ prevalence was 1.49 (95%CI: 1.44, 1.55), Latin American 3.80 (95%CI: 3.69, 3.92) and North American 4.32 (95%CI: 4.22, 4.42). A statistically significant increasing time trend was observed among six European+ , four Latin American, and four North American programs. Women <20 years of age had the highest prevalence in all programs except the Slovak Republic.\n\nConclusions: Gastroschisis prevalence increased over time in 61% of participating programs, and the highest increase in prevalence was observed among the youngest women. Additional inquiry will help to assess the impact of the changing maternal age proportions in the birth population on gastroschisis prevalence.\n\nShumate C, Canfield MA, et al. Pediatric cancer incidence among individuals with overgrowth syndromes and overgrowth features: A population-based assessment in seven million children. Cancer. 2024 Feb 1;130(3):467-475. Epub 2023 Oct 3. doi:10.1002/cncr.35041\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Overgrowth syndromes (e.g., Beckwith-Wiedemann) are associated with an increased risk of pediatric cancer, although there are few population-based estimates of risk. There are also limited studies describing associations between other overgrowth features (e.g., hepatosplenomegaly) and pediatric cancer. Therefore, cancer risk among children with these conditions was evaluated with data from a large, diverse population-based registry linkage study.\n\nMethods: This study includes all live births in Texas during the years 1999-2017. Children with overgrowth features and syndromes were identified from the Texas Birth Defects Registry; children with cancer were identified by linkage to the Texas Cancer Registry. Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between each overgrowth syndrome/feature and cancer, which were adjusted for infant sex and maternal age.\n\nResults: In the total birth cohort (n = 6,997,422), 21,207 children were identified as having an overgrowth syndrome or feature. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome were 42 times more likely to develop pediatric cancer (95% CI, 24.20-71.83), with hepatoblastoma being the most common, followed by Wilms tumor. The presence of any isolated overgrowth feature was associated with increased cancer risk (HR, 4.70; 95% CI, 3.83-5.77); associations were strongest for hepatosplenomegaly (HR, 23.04; 95% CI, 13.37-39.69) and macroglossia (HR, 11.18; 95% CI, 6.35-19.70).\n\nConclusions: This population-based assessment confirmed prior findings that children with either overgrowth syndromes or features were significantly more likely to develop cancer. Overall, this study supports recommendations for cancer surveillance in children with these conditions and may also inform future research into cancer etiology.\n\nMonterosso A, et al. Severe anal intraepithelial neoplasia trends and subsequent invasive anal cancer in the United States. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2024 Jan 10;116(1):97-104. doi:10.1093/jnci/djad176\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade III is a precursor to squamous cell carcinoma of the anus for which rates are nearly 20-fold higher in people with HIV than in the general population in the United States. We describe trends in anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade III diagnosis and risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the anus following anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade III by HIV status and sex.\n\nMethods: We used data from a population-based linkage between cancer and HIV registries in 11 US states; Puerto Rico; and Washington, DC, during 1996-2019. We identified all individuals with a diagnosis of anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade III and determined their HIV status. We estimated the average annual percentage change of anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade III using Poisson regression stratified by HIV status and sex. We estimated the 5-year cumulative incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the anus following an anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade III diagnosis stratified by sex, HIV status, and prior AIDS diagnosis.\n\nResults: Among people with HIV, average annual percentage changes for anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade III were 15% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 12% to 17%) per year among females and 12% (95% CI = 11% to 14%) among males. Average annual percentage changes for those without HIV were 8% (95% CI = 7% to 8%) for females and 8% (95% CI = 6% to 9%) for males. Among people with HIV, a prior AIDS diagnosis was associated with a 2.7-fold (95% CI = 2.23 to 3.40) and 1.9-fold (95% CI = 1.72 to 2.02) increased risk of anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade III diagnosis for females and males, respectively. Five-year cumulative incidence of squamous cell carcinoma of the anus following anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade III for people with HIV with a prior AIDS diagnosis were 3.4% and 3.7% for females and males, respectively.\n\nConclusions: Rates of anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade III diagnoses have increased since 1996, particularly for people with HIV, likely influenced by increased screening. A prior AIDS diagnosis was strongly associated with risk of anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade III diagnosis.\n\nMonterosso A, et al. Risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in people with HIV in the United States, 2001-2019. J Natl Cancer Inst. 2024 Jan 10;116(1):61-68. doi:10.1093/jnci/djad172\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: People with HIV have higher risk of hepatocellular carcinoma than the general population, partly because of higher prevalence of coinfection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV).\n\nMethods: We calculated standardized incidence ratios for hepatocellular carcinoma in people with HIV by comparing rates from people with HIV in the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study, a population-based HIV and cancer registry linkage, to those in the general population. We used multivariable Poisson regression to estimate adjusted incidence rate ratios among people with HIV and linked the Texas HIV registry with medical claims data to estimate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) of HBV and HCV in hepatocellular carcinoma patients with logistic regression.\n\nResults: Compared with the general population, hepatocellular carcinoma rates in people with HIV were elevated 2.79-fold (n = 1736; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.66 to 2.92). Hepatocellular carcinoma rates decreased statistically significantly from 2001-2004 to 2015-2019 (P < .001). Compared with men who have sex with men, hepatocellular carcinoma risk was elevated 4.28-fold among men who injected drugs (95% CI = 3.72 to 4.93) and 1.83-fold among women who injected drugs (95% CI = 1.49 to 2.26). In Texas, 146 hepatocellular carcinoma cases among people with HIV were linked to claims data: 25% HBV positive, 59% HCV positive, and 13% coinfected with HBV and HCV. Compared with men who had sex with men, people who inject drugs had 82% decreased odds of HBV (AOR = 0.18, 95% CI = 0.05 to 0.63) and 2 times the odds of HCV (AOR = 20.4, 95% CI = 3.32 to 125.3).\n\nConclusions: During 2001-2019, hepatocellular carcinoma risk declined among people with HIV, though rates remain statistically significantly elevated compared with the general population, particularly among people who inject drugs. Prevention and treatment of HBV/HCV are needed to reduce hepatocellular carcinoma risk among people with HIV.\n\nArcher NP, et al. Factors associated with infant sex and preterm birth status for selected birth defects from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, 1997-2011. Birth Defects Res. 2024 Jan;116(1):e2294. Epub 2023 Dec 28. doi:10.1002/bdr2.2294\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Birth defects and preterm birth co-occur, with some overlapping risk factors. Many birth defects and preterm births tend to have a male preponderance. We explored potential risk factors impacting sex and preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) birth differences among infants with selected birth defects delivered from 1997 to 2011 using data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS).\n\nMethods: The NBDPS was a large multisite, population-based case-control study. Using random forests, we identified important predictors of male preterm, female preterm, and male term, each compared with female term births for each birth defect. Using logistic regression, we estimated odds ratios for associations between important predictors and sex-preterm birth status by birth defect.\n\nResults: We examined 11,379 infants with nine specific birth defects. The top 10 most important predictors of sex-preterm birth status from the random forests varied greatly across the birth defects and sex-preterm comparisons within a given defect group, with several being novel factors. However, one consistency was that short interpregnancy interval was associated with sex-preterm birth status for many of the studied birth defects. Although obesity has been identified as a risk factor for preterm birth and birth defects in other research, it was not associated with sex-preterm birth status for any of the examined defects.\n\nConclusions: We confirmed expected associations for sex-preterm birth status differences and found new potential risk factors for further exploration among the studied birth defects.\n\nShumate C, Bojes H, Patel K, Canfield M, et al. Racial and ethnic differences in infant survival for hydrocephaly-Texas, 1999-2017. Birth Defects Res. 2024 Jan;116(1):e2285. Epub 2023 Dec 18. doi:10.1002/bdr2.2285\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Congenital hydrocephaly, an abnormal accumulation of fluid within the ventricular spaces at birth, can cause disability or death if untreated. Limited information is available about survival of infants born with hydrocephaly in Texas. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to calculate survival estimates among infants born with hydrocephaly without spina bifida in Texas.\n\nMethods: A cohort of live-born infants delivered during 1999-2017 with congenital hydrocephaly without spina bifida was identified from the Texas Birth Defects Registry. Deaths within 1 year of delivery were identified using vital and medical records. One-year infant survival estimates were generated for multiple descriptive characteristics using the Kaplan-Meier method. Crude hazard ratios (HRs) for one-year survival among infants with congenital hydrocephaly by maternal and infant characteristics and adjusted HRs for maternal race and ethnicity were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models.\n\nResults: Among 5709 infants born with congenital hydrocephaly without spina bifida, 4681 (82%) survived the first year. The following characteristics were associated with infant survival: maternal race and ethnicity, clinical classification (e.g., chromosomal or syndromic), preterm birth, birth weight, birth year, and maternal education. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, differences in survival were observed by maternal race and ethnicity after adjustment for other maternal and infant characteristics. Infants of non-Hispanic Black (HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04-1.58) and Hispanic (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.12-1.54) women had increased risk for mortality, compared with infants of non-Hispanic White women.\n\nConclusions: This study showed infant survival among a Texas cohort differed by maternal race and ethnicity, clinical classification, gestational age, birth weight, birth year, and maternal education in infants with congenital hydrocephaly without spina bifida. Findings confirm that mortality continues to be common among infants with hydrocephaly without spina bifida. Additional research is needed to identify other risk factors of mortality risk.\n\nMonterosso A, et al. Survival by sex and HIV status in patients with anal cancer in the USA between 2001 and 2019: a retrospective cohort study. Lancet HIV. 2024 Jan;11(1):e31-e41. Epub 2023 Dec 8. doi:10.1016/S2352-3018(23)00257-6\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: The risk of anal cancer is increased among people with HIV, particularly men who have sex with men. Estimating survival by HIV status and sex and identifying groups at high risk is crucial for documenting prognostic differences between populations. We aimed to compare all-cause and anal cancer-specific survival in patients with anal cancer with and without HIV, stratified by sex, and to identify predictors of survival, stratified by HIV status.\n\nMethods: In this retrospective cohort study, we used data from the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study of 13 population-based HIV and cancer registries throughout the USA. We included individuals aged 20-79 years diagnosed with invasive anal cancer between 2001 and 2019. To estimate associations between HIV status and both all-cause and anal cancer-specific mortality overall, we used Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for year of and age at diagnosis, sex, race and ethnicity, histology, cancer stage, region, and treatment. We also calculated sex-specific adjusted hazard ratios (HRs). By HIV status, we identified characteristics associated with mortality. Models among people with HIV were further adjusted for AIDS status and HIV transmission risk group.\n\nFindings: Between Jan 1, 2001, and Dec 31, 2019, 1161 (43·6%) of 2662 patients with anal cancer and HIV and 7722 (35·4%) of 21 824 patients without HIV died. HIV was associated with a 1·35 times (95% CI 1·24-1·47) increase in all-cause mortality among male patients and a 2·47 times (2·10-2·90) increase among female patients. Among patients with HIV, all-cause mortality was increased among non-Hispanic Black individuals (adjusted HR 1·19, 95% CI 1·04-1·38), people with AIDS (1·36, 1·10-1·68), people who inject drugs (PWID; 1·49, 1·17-1·90), patients with adenocarcinoma (2·74, 1·82-4·13), and those with no or unknown surgery treatment (1·34, 1·18-1·53). HIV was associated with anal cancer-specific mortality among female patients only (1·52, 1·18-1·97). Among patients with HIV, anal cancer-specific mortality was increased among patients with adenocarcinoma (3·29, 1·89-5·72), those with no or unknown treatment (1·59, 1·17-2·17), and PWID (1·60, 1·05-2·44).\n\nInterpretation: HIV was associated with all-cause mortality among patients with anal cancer, especially women. Anal cancer-specific mortality was elevated among female patients with HIV. As screening for anal cancer becomes more widespread, examining the effects of screening on survival by HIV status and sex is crucial.\n\nFunding: US National Cancer Institute Intramural Research Program.\n\nShumate CJ, Canfield MA, et al. Prevalence of congenital anomalies according to maternal race and ethnicity, Texas, 1999-2018. Birth Defects Res. 2024 Jan;116(1):e2274. Epub 2023 Nov 28. doi:10.1002/bdr2.2274\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Few studies of congenital anomalies provide prevalence estimates stratified by maternal race/ethnicity. We sought to determine whether the prevalence of a broad spectrum of anomalies varies among offspring of women from different race/ethnic groups.\n\nMethods: We obtained information on cases with anomalies from the population-based Texas Birth Defects Registry, and denominator data on livebirths among Texas residents during 1999-2018 from the Texas Center for Health Statistics. We estimated the prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of N = 145 anomalies among offspring of Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black relative to non-Hispanic White women using Poisson regression, adjusting for maternal age, education, body mass index, and previous livebirths. We performed a two-stage analysis with a Bonferroni-adjusted p < 1.7 × 10-4 in the initial screening phase to identify anomalies with statistically significant variation.\n\nResults: There were 7,698,768 livebirths and 1,187,385 anomalies diagnosed in 368,393 cases. The prevalence of any monitored congenital anomaly was similar among offspring of non-Hispanic White (referent), non-Hispanic Black (PR 0.98, CI 0.96-1.00), and Hispanic (PR 0.95, CI 0.93-0.96) women. We observed statistically significant racial/ethnic variation for 42 anomalies. Marked differences were observed when comparing offspring of non-Hispanic Black to non-Hispanic White women with respect to polydactyly (PR 4.38, CI 4.07-4.72), pyloric stenosis (PR 0.34, CI 0.29-0.40), and aortic valve atresia/stenosis (PR 0.51, CI 0.36-0.72).\n\nConclusions: Birth prevalence of many major congenital anomalies varies by maternal race and ethnicity. While the reasons for these differences are likely multifactorial, a thorough understanding of racial and ethnic disparities is useful to stimulate etiologic research.\n\nAllred RP, Nguyen J, Agopian AJ, Canfield MA, Shumate CJ. An epidemiologic study of penoscrotal transposition by maternal characteristics using data from the Texas birth defects registry. Birth Defects Res. 2024 Jan;116(1):e2270. Epub 2023 Nov 6. doi:10.1002/bdr2.2270\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Penoscrotal transposition (PST) is an uncommon urogenital malformation in which the penis is mal-positioned to be inferior to the scrotum. The purpose of this study was to explore PST risk by maternal characteristics and to describe co-occurring congenital abnormalities in the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR).\n\nMethods: We conducted a population-based descriptive study examining occurrence of PST in the TBDR between 1999 and 2019. The primary outcome variable was PST diagnosis during infancy. Descriptive variables included maternal age, education, and race/ethnicity. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated within each maternal variable category using Poisson regression. Counts and percentages of cases with select co-occurring congenital abnormalities were also calculated.\n\nResults: Overall, 251 infants had PST, providing a prevalence of 0.61/10,000 live male births (95% CI: 0.53-0.68). PST prevalence was significantly lower among infants of mothers who had lower educational attainment (<high school vs. >high school), who were younger (<25 vs. 25-34), and who were Hispanic (vs. non-Hispanic White) and was significantly higher among older mothers (35+ vs. 25-39). Hypospadias was the most common co-occurring genitourinary anomaly, affecting close to 70% of cases.\n\nConclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first investigation exploring the prevalence of PST in a population-based birth defects registry. Our findings help to understand the risk for PST among select maternal demographic characteristics and may assist in generating hypotheses about the underlying etiology of this condition for future work.\n\nLanglois PH, et al.

Epub 2023 Sep 1. doi:10.1038/s41390-023-02787-9\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: To characterize neurodevelopmental abnormalities in children up to 36 months of age with congenital Zika virus exposure.\n\nMethods: From the U.S. Zika Pregnancy and Infant Registry, a national surveillance system to monitor pregnancies with laboratory evidence of Zika virus infection, pregnancy outcomes and presence of Zika associated birth defects (ZBD) were reported among infants with available information. Neurologic sequelae and developmental delay were reported among children with ≥1 follow-up exam after 14 days of age or with ≥1 visit with development reported, respectively.\n\nResults: Among 2248 infants, 10.1% were born preterm, and 10.5% were small-for-gestational age. Overall, 122 (5.4%) had any ZBD; 91.8% of infants had brain abnormalities or microcephaly, 23.0% had eye abnormalities, and 14.8% had both. Of 1881 children ≥1 follow-up exam reported, neurologic sequelae were more common among children with ZBD (44.6%) vs. without ZBD (1.5%). Of children with ≥1 visit with development reported, 46.8% (51/109) of children with ZBD and 7.4% (129/1739) of children without ZBD had confirmed or possible developmental delay.\n\nConclusion: Understanding the prevalence of developmental delays and healthcare needs of children with congenital Zika virus exposure can inform health systems and planning to ensure services are available for affected families.\n\nImpact: We characterize pregnancy and infant outcomes and describe neurodevelopmental abnormalities up to 36 months of age by presence of Zika associated birth defects (ZBD). Neurologic sequelae and developmental delays were common among children with ZBD. Children with ZBD had increased frequency of neurologic sequelae and developmental delay compared to children without ZBD. Longitudinal follow-up of infants with Zika virus exposure in utero is important to characterize neurodevelopmental delay not apparent in early infancy, but logistically challenging in surveillance models.\n\nBascom JT, Stephens SB, Lupo PJ, et al. Scientific impact of the National Birth Defects Prevention Network multistate collaborative publications. Birth Defects Res. 2024 Jan;116(1):e2225. Epub 2023 Jul 26. doi:10.1002/bdr2.2225\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Given the lack of a national, population-based birth defects surveillance program in the United States, the National Birth Defects Prevention Network (NBDPN) has facilitated important studies on surveillance, research, and prevention of major birth defects. We sought to summarize NBDPN peer-reviewed publications and their impact.\n\nMethods: We obtained and reviewed a curated list of 49 NBDPN multistate collaborative publications during 2000-2022, as of December 31, 2022. Each publication was reviewed and classified by type (e.g., risk factor association analysis). Key characteristics of study populations and analytic approaches used, along with publication impact (e.g., number of citations), were tabulated.\n\nResults: NBDPN publications focused on prevalence estimates (N = 17), surveillance methods (N = 11), risk factor associations (N = 10), mortality and other outcomes among affected individuals (N = 6), and descriptive epidemiology of various birth defects (N = 5). The most cited publications were those that reported on prevalence estimates for a spectrum of defects and those that assessed changes in neural tube defects (NTD) prevalence following mandatory folic acid fortification in the United States.\n\nConclusions: Results from multistate NBDPN publications have provided critical information not available through other sources, including US prevalence estimates of major birth defects, folic acid fortification and NTD prevention, and improved understanding of defect trends and surveillance efforts. Until a national birth defects surveillance program is established in the United States, NBDPN collaborative publications remain an important resource for investigating birth defects and informing decisions related to health services planning of secondary disabilities prevention and care.\n\n(In date order with the most recent first).\n\nArcher NA, et al. Factors associated with infant sex and preterm birth status for selected birth defects from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, 1997-2011. Birth Defects Res. Published online December 28, 2023. doi:10.1002/bdr2.2294\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Birth defects and preterm birth co-occur, with some overlapping risk factors. Many birth defects and preterm births tend to have a male preponderance. We explored potential risk factors impacting sex and preterm (<37 weeks of gestation) birth differences among infants with selected birth defects delivered from 1997 to 2011 using data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS).\n\nMethods: The NBDPS was a large multisite, population-based case-control study. Using random forests, we identified important predictors of male preterm, female preterm, and male term, each compared with female term births for each birth defect. Using logistic regression, we estimated odds ratios for associations between important predictors and sex-preterm birth status by birth defect.\n\nResults: We examined 11,379 infants with nine specific birth defects. The top 10 most important predictors of sex-preterm birth status from the random forests varied greatly across the birth defects and sex-preterm comparisons within a given defect group, with several being novel factors. However, one consistency was that short interpregnancy interval was associated with sex-preterm birth status for many of the studied birth defects. Although obesity has been identified as a risk factor for preterm birth and birth defects in other research, it was not associated with sex-preterm birth status for any of the examined defects.\n\nConclusions: We confirmed expected associations for sex-preterm birth status differences and found new potential risk factors for further exploration among the studied birth defects.\n\nGarcia B, et al. A cluster investigation of Candida auris among hospitalized incarcerated patients. Antimicrob Steward Healthc Epidemiol. 2023 Dec 19;3(1):e244. doi:10.1017/ash.2023.520\n\nAbstract\n\nObjective: Investigate and mitigate a cluster of Candida auris cases among incarcerated patients in a maximum-security prison hospital utilizing contact tracing, screening, whole genome sequencing, and environmental sampling and decontamination.\n\nDesign: Outbreak investigation.\n\nSetting: Inpatient prison hospital affiliated with an academic tertiary referral center.\n\nPatients: Inmates of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\n\nMethods: Epidemiologic and environmental investigations were conducted including contact tracing, point prevalence surveys, and environmental sampling. Whole genome sequencing was performed on positive patient isolates.\n\nResults: Following a clinical case of C. auris fungemia, 344 patients underwent C. auris surveillance screening. Eight (2.3%) patients were identified with C. auris colonization. All patients were male. Our index patient was the only clinical case and death. Whole genome sequencing was performed on the nine patient isolates. All isolates were clade III (Africa) and clustered together with the largest SNP difference being 21. Environmental cultures from 7 of 61 rooms (11.5%) were positive following terminal disinfection with bleach. Sites nearest to the patient were most often positive including the hospital bed rails and bedside table. The transmission cluster was successfully mitigated within 60 days of identification.\n\nConclusions: Implementation of an aggressive surveillance and decontamination program resulted in mitigation of a C. auris transmission cluster among our incarcerated patients. This investigation provides valuable insight into C. auris transmission in the incarcerated population, which is not considered a classic high-risk population as well as the challenges faced to stop transmission in a facility that requires the use of shared patient environments.\n\nShumate C, Bojes H, Canfield M, et al. Racial and ethnic differences in infant survival for hydrocephaly-Texas, 1999-2017. Birth Defects Res. Published online December 18, 2023. doi:10.1002/bdr2.2285\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Congenital hydrocephaly, an abnormal accumulation of fluid within the ventricular spaces at birth, can cause disability or death if untreated. Limited information is available about survival of infants born with hydrocephaly in Texas. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to calculate survival estimates among infants born with hydrocephaly without spina bifida in Texas.\n\nMethods: A cohort of live-born infants delivered during 1999-2017 with congenital hydrocephaly without spina bifida was identified from the Texas Birth Defects Registry. Deaths within 1 year of delivery were identified using vital and medical records. One-year infant survival estimates were generated for multiple descriptive characteristics using the Kaplan-Meier method. Crude hazard ratios (HRs) for one-year survival among infants with congenital hydrocephaly by maternal and infant characteristics and adjusted HRs for maternal race and ethnicity were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models.\n\nResults: Among 5709 infants born with congenital hydrocephaly without spina bifida, 4681 (82%) survived the first year. The following characteristics were associated with infant survival: maternal race and ethnicity, clinical classification (e.g., chromosomal or syndromic), preterm birth, birth weight, birth year, and maternal education. In the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model, differences in survival were observed by maternal race and ethnicity after adjustment for other maternal and infant characteristics. Infants of non-Hispanic Black (HR: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04-1.58) and Hispanic (HR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.12-1.54) women had increased risk for mortality, compared with infants of non-Hispanic White women.\n\nConclusions: This study showed infant survival among a Texas cohort differed by maternal race and ethnicity, clinical classification, gestational age, birth weight, birth year, and maternal education in infants with congenital hydrocephaly without spina bifida. Findings confirm that mortality continues to be common among infants with hydrocephaly without spina bifida. Additional research is needed to identify other risk factors of mortality risk.\n\nNyachoti DO, et al. Fwelo P, Springer AE, Kelder SH. Association between Gross National Income per capita and COVID-19 vaccination coverage: a global ecological study. BMC Public Health. 2023 Dec 4;23(1):2415. doi:10.1186/s12889-023-17241-y\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has claimed over six million lives and infected more than 650 million people globally. Public health agencies have deployed several strategies, including rolling out vaccination campaigns to curb the pandemic, yet a significant proportion of the global population has not received the COVID-19 vaccine. We assessed differences in COVID-19 vaccination coverage by Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of WHO members (i.e., countries, areas, and territories, n = 192) and by WHO member regions (n = 6).\n\nMethods: Using an ecological study design, we analyzed publicly available data from the WHO website merged with the World Bank's GNI per capita data. We included a total of 192 WHO members and six WHO regions in the analysis. We utilized negative binomial regression to assess the associations between the GNI per capita and COVID-19 vaccination coverage (cumulative number of persons fully vaccinated and/or received at least one dose of the vaccine per 100 population), and ANOVA test to assess the differences in vaccination coverage per WHO regions.\n\nResults: Low GNI per capita WHO members had significantly lower full vaccination coverage (aRR 0.30, 95% CI 0.22-0.40) compared to high GNI per capita WHO members. These members were also 66% less likely to receive at least one dose of the vaccine (aRR 0.34, 0.26-0.44) relative to high GNI per capita WHO members. Africa region had a significantly lower fully vaccination coverage (aRR 0.71, 95% CI 0.36-0.54) and received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine (aRR 0.78, 95% CI 0.62-0.99) than Europe region. Conversely, the Western Pacific region had significantly higher fully vaccination coverage (aRR 1.40 95% CI 1.12-1.74) and received at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccines (aRR 1.40 95% CI 1.14-1.73) relative to European region.\n\nConclusion: WHO members with low GNI per capita and the African region reported significantly lower COVID-19 vaccination coverage than those with high GNI per capita or other regions. Efforts to strengthen and promote COVID-19 vaccination in low-income WHO countries and African region should be scaled up.\n\nShuford JA, Pont SJ, et al.

Multistate outbreak of turtle-associated salmonellosis highlights ongoing challenges with the illegal sale and distribution of small turtles. Zoonoses Public Health. 2023 Dec;70(8):684-691. Epub 2023 Sep 29. doi:10.1111/zph.13080\n\nAbstract\n\nThe sale and distribution of small turtles (shell length <4 inches) as pets has been banned in the United States since 1975 because of the risk of Salmonella transmission, especially to children. Despite this 48-year-old ban, salmonellosis outbreaks continue to be linked to contact with small turtles. During investigations of turtle-associated outbreaks, information regarding the turtle farm of origin is difficult to obtain because turtles are commonly sold by transient vendors. During 2020-2021, public health officials investigated a multistate illness outbreak caused by Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium linked to pet small turtles. Cases were defined as a laboratory-confirmed Salmonella Typhimurium infection highly related (within 0-6 allele differences) to the outbreak strain based on whole-genome sequencing analysis by core-genome multilocus sequence typing with illness onset occurring during 27 August 2020-14 May 2021. Forty-three patients were identified from 12 states; of these, 35% (15/43) were children <5 years old. Among patients with available information, 37% (14/38) were hospitalized, and one death was reported. Seventy-four percent (25/34) of patients reported turtle exposure in the week before illness onset, and 84% (16/19) specified exposure to small turtles. The outbreak strain was isolated from samples collected from a Pennsylvania patient's small turtle tank. Two patients reported purchasing their small turtles from pet stores. Salmonella Braenderup was isolated from samples collected from small turtles and their habitat at one of these stores; however, at that time, this strain was not associated with any human illnesses. This investigation was notable because of the documented sale of small turtles from several pet stores combined with the identification of a single small turtle supplier to these pet stores. The high proportion of children involved in this outbreak highlights the continued need to educate the pet industry as well as parents and caregivers about the risk of turtle-associated salmonellosis especially in children. Understanding and addressing the persisting challenges related to the illegal sale and distribution of small turtles could reduce the burden of turtle-associated salmonellosis.\n\nShumate CJ, Canfield MA, et al. Prevalence of congenital anomalies according to maternal race and ethnicity, Texas, 1999-2018. Birth Defects Res. Published online November 28, 2023. doi:10.1002/bdr2.2274\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Few studies of congenital anomalies provide prevalence estimates stratified by maternal race/ethnicity. We sought to determine whether the prevalence of a broad spectrum of anomalies varies among offspring of women from different race/ethnic groups.\n\nMethods: We obtained information on cases with anomalies from the population-based Texas Birth Defects Registry, and denominator data on livebirths among Texas residents during 1999-2018 from the Texas Center for Health Statistics. We estimated the prevalence ratio (PR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of N = 145 anomalies among offspring of Hispanic and non-Hispanic Black relative to non-Hispanic White women using Poisson regression, adjusting for maternal age, education, body mass index, and previous livebirths. We performed a two-stage analysis with a Bonferroni-adjusted p < 1.7 × 10-4 in the initial screening phase to identify anomalies with statistically significant variation.\n\nResults: There were 7,698,768 livebirths and 1,187,385 anomalies diagnosed in 368,393 cases. The prevalence of any monitored congenital anomaly was similar among offspring of non-Hispanic White (referent), non-Hispanic Black (PR 0.98, CI 0.96-1.00), and Hispanic (PR 0.95, CI 0.93-0.96) women. We observed statistically significant racial/ethnic variation for 42 anomalies. Marked differences were observed when comparing offspring of non-Hispanic Black to non-Hispanic White women with respect to polydactyly (PR 4.38, CI 4.07-4.72), pyloric stenosis (PR 0.34, CI 0.29-0.40), and aortic valve atresia/stenosis (PR 0.51, CI 0.36-0.72).\n\nConclusions: Birth prevalence of many major congenital anomalies varies by maternal race and ethnicity. While the reasons for these differences are likely multifactorial, a thorough understanding of racial and ethnic disparities is useful to stimulate etiologic research.\n\nCanfield MA, Shumate CJ, et al. Associations between birth defects with neural crest cell origins and pediatric embryonal tumors. Cancer. 2023 Nov 15;129(22):3595-3602. Epub 2023 Jul 11. doi:10.1002/cncr.34952\n\nBackground: There are few assessments evaluating associations between birth defects with neural crest cell developmental origins (BDNCOs) and embryonal tumors, which are characterized by undifferentiated cells having a molecular profile similar to neural crest cells. The effect of BDNCOs on embryonal tumors was estimated to explore potential shared etiologic pathways and genetic origins.\n\nMethods: With the use of a multistate, registry-linkage cohort study, BDNCO-embryonal tumor associations were evaluated by generating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) with Cox regression models. BDNCOs consisted of ear, face, and neck defects, Hirschsprung disease, and a selection of congenital heart defects. Embryonal tumors included neuroblastoma, nephroblastoma, and hepatoblastoma. Potential HR modification (HRM) was investigated by infant sex, maternal race/ethnicity, maternal age, and maternal education.\n\nResults: The risk of embryonal tumors among those with BDNCOs was 0.09% (co-occurring n = 105) compared to 0.03% (95% CI, 0.03%-0.04%) among those without a birth defect. Children with BDNCOs were 4.2 times (95% CI, 3.5-5.1 times) as likely to be diagnosed with an embryonal tumor compared to children born without a birth defect. BDNCOs were strongly associated with hepatoblastoma (HR, 16.1; 95% CI, 11.3-22.9), and the HRs for neuroblastoma (3.1; 95% CI, 2.3-4.2) and nephroblastoma (2.9; 95% CI, 1.9-4.4) were elevated. There was no notable HRM by the aforementioned factors.\n\nConclusions: Children with BDNCOs are more likely to develop embryonal tumors compared to children without a birth defect. Disruptions of shared developmental pathways may contribute to both phenotypes, which could inform future genomic assessments and cancer surveillance strategies of these conditions.\n\nCanfield MA, Shumate CJ, et al. An epidemiologic study of penoscrotal transposition by maternal characteristics using data from the Texas birth defects registry. Birth Defects Res. Published online November 6, 2023. doi:10.1002/bdr2.2270\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Penoscrotal transposition (PST) is an uncommon urogenital malformation in which the penis is mal-positioned to be inferior to the scrotum. The purpose of this study was to explore PST risk by maternal characteristics and to describe co-occurring congenital abnormalities in the Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDR).\n\nMethods: We conducted a population-based descriptive study examining occurrence of PST in the TBDR between 1999 and 2019. The primary outcome variable was PST diagnosis during infancy. Descriptive variables included maternal age, education, and race/ethnicity. Prevalence ratios (PRs) were calculated within each maternal variable category using Poisson regression. Counts and percentages of cases with select co-occurring congenital abnormalities were also calculated.\n\nResults: Overall, 251 infants had PST, providing a prevalence of 0.61/10,000 live male births (95% CI: 0.53-0.68). PST prevalence was significantly lower among infants of mothers who had lower educational attainment (<high school vs. >high school), who were younger (<25 vs. 25-34), and who were Hispanic (vs. non-Hispanic White) and was significantly higher among older mothers (35+ vs. 25-39). Hypospadias was the most common co-occurring genitourinary anomaly, affecting close to 70% of cases.\n\nConclusions: To our knowledge, this is the first investigation exploring the prevalence of PST in a population-based birth defects registry. Our findings help to understand the risk for PST among select maternal demographic characteristics and may assist in generating hypotheses about the underlying etiology of this condition for future work.\n\nCanfield MA, Shumate CJ, et al. Survival of neonates, infants, and children with birth defects: a population-based study in Texas, 1999-2018. Lancet Reg Health Am. 2023 Oct 18:27:100617. doi:10.1016/j.lana.2023.100617\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Birth defects are a leading cause of neonatal, infant, and childhood mortality, but recent population-based survival estimates for a spectrum in the U.S. are lacking.\n\nMethods: Using the statewide Texas Birth Defects Registry (1999-2017 births) and vital records linkage to ascertain deaths, we conducted Kaplan-Meier analyses to estimate survival probabilities at 1, 7, and 28 days, and 1, 5, and 10 years. We evaluated survival in the full cohort of infants with any major defect and for 30 specific conditions. One-year survival analyses were stratified by gestational age, birth year, and case classification.\n\nFindings: Among 246,394 live-born infants with any major defect, the estimated survival probabilities were 98.9% at 1 day, 95.0% at 1 year, and 93.9% at 10 years. Ten-year survival varied by condition, ranging from 36.9% for holoprosencephaly to 99.3% for pyloric stenosis. One-year survival was associated with increasing gestational age (e.g., increasing from 46.9% at <28 weeks to 95.8% at ≥37 weeks for spina bifida). One-year survival increased in more recent birth years for several defect categories (e.g., increasing from 86.0% among 1999-2004 births to 93.1% among 2014-2017 births for unilateral renal agenesis/dysgenesis) and was higher among infants with an isolated defect versus those with multiple defects.\n\nInterpretation: This study describes short- and long-term survival outcomes from one of the largest population-based birth defect registries in the world and highlights improved survival over time for several conditions. Our results may lend insight into future healthcare initiatives aimed at reducing mortality in this population.\n\nFunding: This study was funded in part by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) birth defects surveillance cooperative agreement with the Texas Department of State Health Services and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) Block Grant funds.\n\nShumate CJ, et al. Neighborhood deprivation and neural tube defects. Epidemiology. 2023 Nov 1;34(6):774-785. 2023 Nov 1;34(6):774-785. doi:10.1097/EDE.0000000000001655\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Individual measures of socioeconomic status (SES) have been associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects (NTDs); however, the association between neighborhood SES and NTD risk is unknown. Using data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) from 1997 to 2011, we investigated the association between measures of census tract SES and NTD risk.\n\nMethods: The study population included 10,028 controls and 1829 NTD cases. We linked maternal addresses to census tract SES measures and used these measures to calculate the neighborhood deprivation index. We used generalized estimating equations to calculate adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) estimating the impact of quartiles of census tract deprivation on NTDs adjusting for maternal race-ethnicity, maternal education, and maternal age at delivery.\n\nResults: Quartiles of higher neighborhood deprivation were associated with NTDs when compared with the least deprived quartile (Q2: aOR = 1.2; 95% CI = 1.0, 1.4; Q3: aOR = 1.3, 95% CI = 1.1, 1.5; Q4 (highest): aOR = 1.2; 95% CI = 1.0, 1.4). Results for spina bifida were similar; however, estimates for anencephaly and encephalocele were attenuated. Associations differed by maternal race-ethnicity.\n\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that residing in a census tract with more socioeconomic deprivation is associated with an increased risk for NTDs, specifically spina bifida.\n\nNyachoti DO, et al. Association of social vulnerability and COVID-19 mortality rates in Texas between 15 March 2020, and 21 July 2022: an ecological analysis. Int J Environ Res Public Health. 2023 Oct 27;20(21):6985. doi:10.3390/ijerph20216985\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Despite the key role of social vulnerability such as economic disadvantage in health outcomes, research is limited on the impact of social vulnerabilities on COVID-19-related deaths, especially at the state and county level in the USA.\n\nMethods: We conducted a cross-sectional ecologic analysis of COVID-19 mortality by the county-level Minority Health Social Vulnerability Index (MH SVI) and each of its components in Texas. Negative binomial regression (NBR) analyses were used to estimate the association between the composite MH SVI (and its components) and COVID-19 mortality.\n\nResults: A 0.1-unit increase in the overall MH SVI (IRR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.04-1.55; p = 0.017) was associated with a 27% increase in the COVID-19 mortality rate. Among the MH SVI component measures, only low socioeconomic status (IRR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.28-1.89; p = 0.001) and higher household composition (e.g., proportion of older population per county) and disability scores (IRR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.29-1.68; p < 0.001) were positively associated with COVID-19 mortality rates.\n\nConclusions: This study provides further evidence of disparities in COVID-19 mortality by social vulnerability and can inform decisions on the allocation of social resources and services as a strategy for reducing COVID-19 mortality rates and similar pandemics in the future.\n\nMonterosso A, Miller P, et al. Real-world use of antiretroviral therapy and risk of cancer among people living with HIV in Texas. AIDS. Published online October 27, 2023. doi:10.1097/QAD.0000000000003770\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) may reduce cancer risk among people living with HIV (PLWH), but cancer-specific associations are incompletely understood.\n\nMethods: We linked HIV and cancer registries in Texas to a national prescription claims database. cART use was quantified as the proportion of days covered (PDC). Cox proportional hazards models assessed associations of cancer risk with cART usage, adjusting for demographic characteristics, AIDS status, and time since HIV report.\n\nResults: We evaluated 63,694 PLWH followed for 276,804 person-years. The median cART PDC was 21.4% (interquartile range: 0.0%-59.8%). cART use was associated with reduced risk of Kaposi sarcoma (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.48, 95%CI 0.34-0.68 relative to unexposed status) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (0.41, 0.31-0.53), liver cancer (0.61, 0.39-0.96), anal cancer (0.65, 0.46-0.92), and a miscellaneous group of \"other\" cancers (0.80, 0.66-0.98). In contrast, cART-exposed status was not associated with risk for cervical, lung, colorectal, prostate or breast cancers.\n\nConclusion: In a large HIV cohort incorporating data from prescription claims, cART was associated with greatly reduced risks of Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and to a lesser degree, reduced risks of liver and anal cancers. These associations likely reflect the beneficial effects of HIV suppression and improved immune control of oncogenic viruses. Efforts to increase cART use and adherence may further decrease cancer incidence among PLWH.\n\nShuford JA, Pont SJ, et al. Long-term immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in children and adolescents. Pediatr Res. Published online October 24, 2023. doi:10.1038/s41390-023-02857-y\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: This analysis examined the durability of antibodies present after SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination in children and adolescents.\n\nMethods: Data were collected over 4 time points between October 2020-November 2022 as part of a prospective population-based cohort aged 5-to-19 years (N = 810). Results of the (1) Roche Elecsys® Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassay for detection of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (Roche N-test); and (2) qualitative and semi-quantitative detection of antibodies to the SARS CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain (Roche S-test); and (3) self-reported antigen/PCR COVID-19 test results, vaccination and symptom status were analyzed.\n\nResults: N antibody levels reached a median of 84.10 U/ml (IQR: 20.2, 157.7) cutoff index (COI) ~ 6 months post-infection and increased slightly to a median of 85.25 (IQR: 28.0, 143.0) COI at 12 months post-infection. Peak S antibody levels were reached at a median of 2500 U/mL ~6 months post-vaccination and remained for ~12 months (mean 11.6 months, SD 1.20).\n\nConclusions: This analysis provides evidence of robust durability of nucleocapsid and spike antibodies in a large pediatric sample up to 12 months post-infection/vaccination. This information can inform pediatric SARS-CoV-2 vaccination schedules.\n\nImpact: This study provided evidence of robust durability of both nucleocapsid and spike antibodies in a large pediatric sample up to 12 months after infection. Little is known about the long-term durability of natural and vaccine-induced SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the pediatric population. Here, we determined the durability of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike (S-test) and nucleocapsid protein (N-test) in children/adolescents after SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or vaccination lasts at least up to 12 months. This information can inform future SARS-CoV-2 vaccination schedules in this age group.\n\nHuebner EM, Peter B, et al. Preventable deaths during widespread community hepatitis A outbreaks - United States, 2016-2022. MMWR Morb Mortal Wkly Rep. 2023 Oct 20;72(42):1128-1133. doi:10.15585/mmwr.mm7242a1\n\nAbstract\n\nHepatitis A is acquired through the fecal-oral route and is preventable by a safe and effective vaccine. Although hepatitis A is generally mild and self-limited, serious complications, including death, can occur. Since 2016, widespread hepatitis A outbreaks have been reported in 37 U.S. states, primarily among persons who use drugs and those experiencing homelessness. Nearly twice as many hepatitis A-related deaths were reported during 2016-2022 compared with 2009-2015. CDC analyzed data from 27 hepatitis A outbreak-affected states* that contributed data during August 1, 2016-October 31, 2022, to characterize demographic, risk factor, clinical, and cause-of-death data among 315 outbreak-related hepatitis A deaths from those states. Hepatitis A was documented as an underlying or contributing cause of death on 60% of available death certificates. Outbreak-related deaths peaked in 2019, and then decreased annually through 2022. The median age at death was 55 years; most deaths occurred among males (73%) and non-Hispanic White persons (84%). Nearly two thirds (63%) of decedents had at least one documented indication for hepatitis A vaccination, including drug use (41%), homelessness (16%), or coinfection with hepatitis B (12%) or hepatitis C (31%); only 12 (4%) had evidence of previous hepatitis A vaccination. Increasing vaccination coverage among adults at increased risk for infection with hepatitis A virus or for severe disease from infection is critical to preventing future hepatitis A-related deaths.\n\nBojes HK, et al. Influence of storage conditions and multiple freeze-thaw cycles on N1 SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, and BCoV signal. Sci Total Environ. 2023 Oct 20:896:165098. Epub 2023 Jun 29. doi:10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165098\n\nAbstract\n\nWastewater-based epidemiology/wastewater-based surveillance (WBE/WBS) continues to serve as an effective means of monitoring various diseases, including COVID-19 and the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, at the population level. As the use of WBE expands, storage conditions of wastewater samples will play a critical role in ensuring the accuracy and reproducibility of results. In this study, the impacts of water concentration buffer (WCB), storage temperature, and freeze-thaw cycles on the detection of SARS-CoV-2 and other WBE-related gene targets were examined. Freeze-thawing of concentrated samples did not significantly affect (p > 0.05) crossing/cycle threshold (Ct) value for any of the gene targets studied (SARS-CoV-2 N1, PMMoV, and BCoV). However, use of WCB during concentration resulted in a significant (p < 0.05) decrease in Ct for all targets, and storage at -80 °C (in contrast to -20 °C) appeared preferable for wastewater storage signal stability based on decreased Ct values, although this was only significantly different (p < 0.05) for the BCoV target. Interestingly, when Ct values were converted to gene copies per influent sample, no significant differences (p > 0.05) were observed in any of the targets examined. Stability of RNA targets in concentrated wastewater against freeze-thaw degradation supports archiving of concentrated samples for use in retrospective examination of COVID-19 trends and tracing SARS-CoV-2 variants and potentially other viruses, and provides a starting point for establishing a consistent procedure for specimen collection and storage for the WBE/WBS community.\n\nCanfield MA, Langlois PH, et al. Associations between birth defects and childhood and adolescent germ cell tumors according to sex, histologic subtype, and site. Cancer. 2023 Oct 15;129(20):3300-3308. Epub 2023 Jun 27. doi:10.1002/cncr.34906\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Studies have reported increased rates of birth defects among children with germ cell tumors (GCTs). However, few studies have evaluated associations by sex, type of defect, or tumor characteristics.\n\nMethods: Birth defect-GCT associations were evaluated among pediatric patients (N = 552) with GCTs enrolled in the Germ Cell Tumor Epidemiology Study and population-based controls (N = 6380) without cancer from the Genetic Overlap Between Anomalies and Cancer in Kids Study. The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of GCTs according to birth defects status were estimated by using unconditional logistic regression. All defects were considered collectively and by genetic and chromosomal syndromes and nonsyndromic defects. Stratification was by sex, tumor histology (yolk sac tumor, teratoma, germinoma, and mixed/other), and location (gonadal, extragonadal, and intracranial).\n\nResults: Birth defects and syndromic defects were more common among GCT cases than controls (6.9% vs. 4.0% and 2.7% vs. 0.2%, respectively; both p < .001). In multivariable models, GCT risk was increased among children with birth defects (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.3-2.4) and syndromic defects (OR, 10.4; 95% CI, 4.9-22.1). When stratified by tumor characteristics, birth defects were associated with yolk sac tumors (OR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.3-5.0) and mixed/other histologies (OR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.2-3.5) and both gonadal tumors (OR, 1.7; 95% CI, 1.0-2.7) and extragonadal tumors (OR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.1-6.5). Nonsyndromic defects specifically were not associated with GCTs. In sex-stratified analyses, associations were observed among males but not females.\n\nConclusions: These data suggest that males with syndromic birth defects are at an increased risk of pediatric GCTs, whereas males with nonsyndromic defects and females are not at an increased risk.\n\nShumate C, Canfield MA, et al. Pediatric cancer incidence among individuals with overgrowth syndromes and overgrowth features: a population-based assessment in seven million children. Cancer. Published online October 3, 2023. doi:10.1002/cncr.35041\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Overgrowth syndromes (e.g., Beckwith-Wiedemann) are associated with an increased risk of pediatric cancer, although there are few population-based estimates of risk. There are also limited studies describing associations between other overgrowth features (e.g., hepatosplenomegaly) and pediatric cancer. Therefore, cancer risk among children with these conditions was evaluated with data from a large, diverse population-based registry linkage study.\n\nMethods: This study includes all live births in Texas during the years 1999-2017. Children with overgrowth features and syndromes were identified from the Texas Birth Defects Registry; children with cancer were identified by linkage to the Texas Cancer Registry. Cox regression models were used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for the association between each overgrowth syndrome/feature and cancer, which were adjusted for infant sex and maternal age.\n\nResults: In the total birth cohort (n = 6,997,422), 21,207 children were identified as having an overgrowth syndrome or feature. Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome were 42 times more likely to develop pediatric cancer (95% CI, 24.20-71.83), with hepatoblastoma being the most common, followed by Wilms tumor. The presence of any isolated overgrowth feature was associated with increased cancer risk (HR, 4.70; 95% CI, 3.83-5.77); associations were strongest for hepatosplenomegaly (HR, 23.04; 95% CI, 13.37-39.69) and macroglossia (HR, 11.18; 95% CI, 6.35-19.70).\n\nConclusions: This population-based assessment confirmed prior findings that children with either overgrowth syndromes or features were significantly more likely to deve"
