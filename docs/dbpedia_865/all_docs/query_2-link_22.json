These are arranged in eight major sub-groups: 1 ) Colony and Commonwealth; 2) Counties; 3) Townships; 4) Cities and Boroughs; 5) Boundaries, Topography, Geology, Parks; 6) Transportation (Indian trails, roads and turnpikes, rivers and streams, canals, railroads, air, etc.); 7) Military and Battlefields (French and Indian War, Revolutionary War, Civil War). Additional Pennsylvania maps may be found in the following record groups and manuscript groups: RG 12, Records of the Department of Highways; RG 13, Records of the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission; RG 17, Records of the Bureau of Land Records; RG 29, Records of the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission; RG 41, Records of the Navigation Commission for the Delaware River and its Tributaries; MG 110, Schuylkill Navigation Company Records; and MG 199, Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania Collection.\n\nSubgroup 1, Colony and Commonwealth, is arranged chronologically by year. The earliest dated map here is from 1638-1655. The most recent is from 1981. This subgroup features maps showing roads, rivers, canals, railroads, roads, recreation areas and general topography. It is useful for tracing how Pennsylvania land was altered over the centuries. The earliest maps were created by explorers and pioneers. Later maps were created to show property owners, natural resources and local highways. Some regional maps, i.e. showing the Mid-Atlantic region can also be found here. Some maps are tourist or \"official\" road or recreational maps\" of the state produced by the state highways department or the state parks department.\n\nSubgroup 2, Counties is arranged alphabetically by county and then by year. All sixty-seven Pennsylvania counties are represented here but not necessarily for all time periods. Examples of maps found here include donation and depreciation lands, township creation, travel volume, Indian trails, public roads, covered bridges, railroads, topographic views, geology, and warrantee maps. A number of county maps were produced by the Second Pennsylvania Geological Survey from 1878 to 1884. General highway maps of Pennsylvania counties were created by the state department of highways in 1941 and from 1950 to 1960.\n\nSubgroup 3, Townships, covers both general Pennsylvania and specific townships. The townships are arranged alphabetically according to county name. The earliest map here dates back to 1736. Found here are maps depicting canals, climates, coal mines and fields, coke works, erosion, flood control, forests, geographic surveys, land titles, oil basins, recreation areas, rivers, and transportation.\n\nSubgroup 4, Cities and boroughs is arranged alphabetically by name. But not every Pennsylvania town or village is represented here. The earliest map in this category is of Pittsburgh in 1795. The cartographer/artist T. M. Fowler created many \"Fowler's Panoramic Maps\" from 1889 to 1905. In his maps, Fowler sketched specific buildings, streets, businesses, and institutions within cities and boroughs. Some of his maps can be considered \"bird's eye views.\" This subgroup also contains aerial, survey, and topographic views. These maps of cites and boroughs give researchers perspective on the development of cities and boroughs in the Commonwealth.\n\nSubgroup 5, Boundaries, topography, geology, parks is arranged chronologically by date. The earliest map dates from 1682. Many topographical maps of Pennsylvania were produced by the U.S. Department of Interior, Geological Survey, from 1891 to 1957. Maps of state parks were produced by the Pennsylvania Department of Forestry and its successor agency: Forests and Waters. Depiction of Pennsylvania boundary lines, state geology and the state park system are well represented. Images of coal mines, rivers, oil basins, climatology, and warrantee maps provide insight into land use in Pennsylvania history.\n\nSubgroup 6, Transportation is arranged by date of map. The earliest map dates back to 1755. Included here are depictions of trails, roads, rivers, streams, canals, railroads, and air transportation facilities. Types of maps include aeronautical or aerial views as well as views from the ground like Indian paths or turnpikes. Most of the maps are of public roads and railroads.\n\nSubgroup 7, Military and battlefields is listed chronologically by year from 1755 to 1983. They cover essentially the Revolutionary and Civil War periods. These maps illustrate how Pennsylvania's land was changed by different modes of transportation over time.\n\nSubgroup 8, Vignettes: public and private buildings and general structures is arranged in three parts. Part one is a list of buildings arranged alphabetically by name. Part two is a list of maps of the Pennsylvania Great Seal and the State Coat of Arms. Part three consists of images of significant people in Pennsylvania history such as Benjamin Franklin and George Washington.\n\nMG-20 Richard J. Beam Papers\n\n1913-1945 (bulk 1926-1943)\n\n1 box\n\nRichard J. Beam was born in Scranton, Lackawanna County, Pennsylvania in 1869. He was a journalist with newspapers in Scranton, Reading and Philadelphia before serving as the Secretary of the Commonwealth under Governor Gifford Pinchot from 1931 to 1934. He was also a commissioner of the Pennsylvania Public Utilities Commission. His miscellaneous papers feature letters from Smedley D. Butler, George H. Earle, Cornelia Bryce Pinchot, and Gifford Pinchot; materials pertaining to the Public Service Commission and its successor, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission; copies of articles and addresses by Beamish; a political cartoon, 1931, featuring Beamish, Pinchot, etc.; and photographs, 10 items, of Beamish, Herbert C.

Dock was a founder of the City Beautiful movement, a national reform movement aimed at beautification of American cities, especially Harrisburg. Dock served as commissioner on the Pennsylvania Forest Reservation Commission, securing state appropriations for state forests and parks. She was regarded as an international expert in botany and forestry, presenting lectures regularly both in America and abroad. Dock teamed with foresters Joseph Rothrock and Gifford Pinchot to urge the Commonwealth to establish the state Forestry Department and later Pennsylvania's system of state parks. Dock also contributed to the creation of the Mont Alto Forestry Academy for training professional foresters. Also present in this collection are extensive materials relating to Mira Dock's grandfather, William Dock (1793-1868), and father, Gilliard Dock (1827-1895); her uncle, George Dock (1823-187?) who was a physician and professor of medicine at Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia; and Mira's younger brother George Dock (1860-1951), also a physician and teacher of medicine. For related materials see MG-85, J. Horace McFarland Papers.\n\nThere are a large number of photographs, ca. 1880-ca. 1940, including images of various Dock family members, Joseph T. Rothrock, and Pennsylvania Governor William A. Stone; trees and forest reserves throughout Pennsylvania; and urban scenes including Coudersport, Harrisburg, Johnstown, and Philadelphia. Also present are views of churches, commercial and public buildings, and scenes relating her travels.\n\nMira Lloyd Dock Papers\n\n1878-1947.\n\n(Boxes 3-11)\n\n{series #43m.2}\n\nThere is no inherent arrangement.\n\nThe series includes correspondence with family members, professional colleagues, as well as individuals and organization concerned with conservation. The bulk of her correspondence relates to the American Forestry Association, the Pennsylvania Department of Forestry, the Pennsylvania Forestry Association, the State Forestry Academy at Mt. Alto, the Women's School of Horticulture at Ambler, the State Federation of Pennsylvania Women, and the General Federation of Women's Clubs. Major correspondents include Mary Colston, Robert S. Conklin, A. Boyd Hamilton, Florence Keen, J. Horace McFarland, John M. McFarlane, Warren H. Manning, Frederick Law Olmsted, Marlin E. Olmsted, Gifford Pinchot, William H. Rau, Joseph T. Rothrock, Ms. F. R. Wilkinson and Dock family members. Her letters illuminate how the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania began to form public policies and state agencies about state forests. Dock's relationship with many correspondents such as Pinchot and McFarland was not only professional but often personal in nature. Within in the correspondence is a folder dealing with a dispute Dock had with the American Forestry Association in 1907. There are also numerous notebooks and diaries, newspaper clippings, programs and flyers, maps, minutes of the Riverside Club, state forestry reservation commission minutes, along with copies of federal and state bodies dealing with forestry.\n\nGlass Plate Negatives\n\n1889-1900\n\n(2 drawers)\n\n{series #43m.3}\n\nArranged alphabetically by subject.\n\n[From Linda Ries, Guide to Photographs at the Pennsylvania State Archives, p. 64]:\n\n\"Most are undated, but probably were taken between 1889 and 1900.

Born near Easton, Pennsylvania, John Magee (b. 1794, d. 1868) took up residence in Bath, Steuben County, New York, in 1816. Between 1818 and 1826, he served as constable and collector of Bath, deputy sheriff, high sheriff, and census marshall for Steuben County. Active in Democratic politics, he served two terms in congress between 1827 and 1831.\n\nThough the Magee family interests focused on railroad and mining industries in north central Pennsylvania and south central New York, John Magee was also involved in land speculation, lumbering, milling, banking, and related activities. He directed the affairs of the newly organized Steuben County Bank from 1831 until his death. He also owned large tracts of timber land in Michigan and Wisconsin. He established and managed mail coach lines and was a principal promoter of several early railroad lines.\n\nIn 1854 John Magee obtained ownership of the Blossburg and Corning Railroad. The company descended from the Tioga Coal, Iron, Mining and Manufacturing Company, which was originally incorporated under New York State law in 1828 and given power to construct slack-water navigation from the Pennsylvania line to the junction of the Tioga and Chemung rivers near Corning, New York. The company was authorized in 1833 to build a railroad from the termination of the Chemung canal feeder to the Pennsylvania line, and was renamed the Corning and Blossburg Railroad in 1851.\n\nIn 1851 Magee obtained the lease for the coal mines at Blossburg, Pennsylvania, held earlier by Mallory & Bostwick of Corning, New York. Tiring of working under a lease, his son, Duncan S. Magee, began searching for new coal lands in 1856, which resulted in the discovery of coal near Fall Brook, Tioga County, Pennsylvania, and the organization of the Fall Brook Coal Company in 1859. The discovery of coal near Wilson's Creek in 1866 led to the construction of the Wellsboro and Lawrenceville Railroad, which was completed to the mines at Antrim in 1872. The Blossburg and Corning and the Wellsboro and Lawrenceville were consolidated to form the Corning, Cowanesque and Antrim Railway Company, which was incorporated under the laws of New York and Pennsylvania in 1873. The Cowanesque Valley Railroad was purchased by the Corning, Cowanesque and Antrim in 1874. The name of the Corning, Cowanesque and Antrim was changed in 1892 to that of the Fall Brook Railway Company. When John Magee died in 1868, his son, Duncan S. Magee, directed the family enterprises until his death one year later, whereupon he was succeeded by his brother, George J. Magee.\n\nIn order to provide a cheaper outlet for the coal mined at Fall Brook, Antrim, and Morris Run, George J. Magee undertook the construction of the Syracuse, Geneva and Corning Railroad, which was completed from Corning to Geneva in 1877. The Jersey Shore, Pine Creek and Buffalo Railway, later renamed the Pine Creek Railway, joined the Fall Brook system upon its completion in 1883. George J. Magee died in 1897 and was succeeded as president of the coal and railway companies by his son, John Magee. In 1899 the Fall Brook Railway Company, the Syracuse, Geneva and Corning Railway Company, and the Pine Creek Railway Company were leased to the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad for 999 years. In 1909 these three roads were consolidated to form the Geneva, Corning and Southern Railroad Company which was immediately leased to the New York Central.\n\nRecords, approximately 115 cu. ft., embracing minute books, letter press books, general correspondence, and account books are arranged in the following subgroups:\n\nFall Brook Coal Company, 1859-1938\n\nFall Brook Railway Company, 1892-1912; Blossburg and Corning Railroad, 1854-78\n\nCorning, Cowanesque and Antrim Railway Company, 1873-92\n\nCowanesque Valley Railroad Company, 1871-74\n\nSyracuse, Geneva and Corning Railway Company, 1875-85\n\nWellsboro and Lawrenceville Railroad Company, 1867-73\n\nDuncan S.

The former, a deputy surveyor and member of the Pennsylvania Senate from 1800 to 1808, was, with his father-in-law, Colonel James Dunlop, the co-founder in 1795 of the town of Bellefonte, Centre County. The latter was a principal engineer on first the Western Division, next upon the West Branch Division, and finally upon North Branch Division of the Pennsylvania Canal. Included are a few items pertaining to the parents of James Harris: John Harris (b. 1723, d. 1794) and his wife Jane. John Harris was an early settler on the Swatara in Lancaster (now Dauphin) County, and founder in 1790 of Mifflintown on the Juniata. Probably the most striking item in the group is an inventory of the estate of Jane Harris (d. 1807) which includes a list of books which had belonged to her husband. This list shows a theological and historical library of very considerable dimensions and quality for a pioneer family in eighteenth-century Pennsylvania.\n\nThe papers of James Harris contain correspondence with William Bell, John Blair, John Mitchell, and others, 1802-26; a plan of Mifflintown (1790), 1814; deeds for lots in Bellefonte, 1807, 1809; agreements between James Harris and others, 1803, 1813, 1826; notebook, journal, notes, etc., regarding various surveying expeditions, 1784; notifications of Harris' appointment, 1787, to lay out a highway from Frankstown on the Juniata to the mouth of Loyalhanna Creek on the Conemaugh; field notes, 1787, relating to the Frankstown to Conemaugh road; book of acreages, with journal of surveys, 1786-87, on the Conemaugh, the Sinnemahoning, and other streams; field notes on surveys, 1792-1806; receipt book of William Harris and James Harris, 1803-13 and day book for the estates of John Harris and William Harris, 1800-26.\n\nRevealing professional, political, and personal involvements during James D. Harris' employment as principal engineer on the Western Division, 1827-29, West Branch Division, 1931-34, and North Branch Division, 1836-38, of the Pennsylvania Canal, the papers of James Dunlop Harris embrace considerable correspondence with canal commissioners, superintendents, engineers, contractors, and such prominent individuals as Joseph Mcllvaine, William C. McPherson, John Mitchell, William Fisher Packer, E. F. Pennypacker, Francis R. Shunk, Joseph Smith, Thaddeus Stevens, and Josiah White. Included are such interesting items as a letter to John Mitchell, 1833, describing a riot between canal laborers and boatmen, and an account William F. Packer for the expenses of troops led by Captain S. H. Wilson to quell the riot.\n\nThere is correspondence, dated 1833-34, with James and Simon Cameron relating mainly to Harris' taking an engineer's position on the Portsmouth and Lancaster Railroad; correspondence, 1835, with Thomas Burnside of the Bald Eagle and Spring Creek Navigation Company and Abner Lacock, president of the Pennsylvania-Ohio (\"Cross Cut\") Canal; correspondence, 1835-36, during Harris' employment as principal engineer on the Pennsylvania-Ohio Canal; and correspondence, 1831-41, with William Foster, Jr., Harris' assistant, friend, and successor in canal appointments.

Huston was born in Philadelphia in 1866, the son of Robert Huston. He graduated from Princeton University in 1892; and following a business partnership with Frank Furness, Huston launched his own firm in 1894. He specialized chiefly in designing homes but also designed commercial buildings such as the Witherspoon Building for the Presbyterian Board of Publication (Walnut and Juniper streets, Philadelphia, 1895). Then, in 1901, Huston entered and won the Pennsylvania State Capitol competition to select an architect to design a new state capitol to replace the original capitol which burned down in 1897. The contest created controversy among the members of the professional architect community who called for Huston's resignation. Unfortunately for Huston, this was only the beginning of the scandal involving construction of the Pennsylvania State Capitol building which was dedicated in 1906. Huston was charged with conspiracy to defraud the State of Pennsylvania by accepting bribes for the work on the Capitol and by charging the State more than was proper for the contracts required to complete the structure. He was convicted on April 29, 1910 and was sentenced in 1911 \"for not less than six months and not more than two years\" in the Pennsylvania Eastern Penitentiary in Philadelphia. Huston served six months and 20 days in prison but was paroled on 20 December 1911. He resumed work as an architect but never regained the status he once had as an architect. Huston died in 1940.\n\nIn the Joseph M. Huston Collection there are original architect's drawings for the state capitol building including competition drawings, photographic prints, and blueprints. The item of interest for environmentalists is the State Capitol Park plans by Pughand Hubbard Civil Engineers showing the park boundaries in Harrisburg, August 29, 1904.\n\nMG-76 Horace A. Keefer Papers\n\n1881-1934\n\n(1 folder)\n\nHorace A., Keefer, the son of Major John Brua Keefer of Harrisburg, was a clerk at Paxton Furnaces, Harrisburg. In 1879 he became Superintendent of South Mountain Mining and Iron Company, Pine Grove Furnace, Cumberland County, owned by Jay Cooke. Mr. Keefer was President of K.C. & L. Railway, Wallula, Kansas. From 1896-1900 he was a populist member of the Kansas Legislature. The papers contain incoming and outgoing correspondence of Horace A. Keefer relating to political and economic matters and histories of Pine Grove Furnace and early iron industries of Dauphin County written by Keefer.

Horace McFarland (1859-1948) is a leading figure in Pennsylvania environmental history. Although he was born in McAlisterville, Juniata County, on Sept. 29, 1859, McFarland resided in Harrisburg for most of his life. During the opening decades of the twentieth century he emerged as an articulate advocate of the \"City Beautiful\" movement that resulted in such progressive improvements as paved streets in Harrisburg, the City Island water filtration plant, Riverfront Park, Wildwood Lake and associated flood control projects. A noted early conservationist, McFarland also campaigned vigorously for the preservation of Niagara Falls, the development of national parks, roadside beautification and against the blight of billboards. Together with Mira Lloyd Dock, McFarland was a seminal figure in the growth the national \"City Beautiful\" movement. As a founder of the American Civic Association, he took the \"Harrisburg Plan\" on the road to cities all across the United States.\n\nMcFarland fought for the establishment of the National Park Service and promoted city planning and zoning to prevent urban sprawl. McFarland, owner of the Mount Pleasant Printing Company in Harrisburg, was also recognized for his work as a printer, as well as a master gardener whose books and photographs on roses, trees and other subjects were famous across the United States. A founder and president of the American Rose Society, he also served as the editor of the \"Beautiful America\" department of the Ladies Home Journal and as chairman of the State Art Commission for many years. His home and garden in the Bellevue Park section of Harrisburg was an internationally famous testing ground for hundreds of new plant species.\n\nMcFarland became a central figure in the fight led by John Muir and the Sierra Club to prevent San Francisco from damming the water at Hetch Hetchy Valley in the Yosemite National Park for the city's use. But in December of 1913, after five years of hearings and debates, President Woodrow Wilson signed a bill giving San Francisco access to the Hetch Hetchy Valley. McFarland, though exhausted by the failed campaign, rallied quickly and with typical tenacity worked to turn defeat into a new opportunity. Within a few days, he wrote a personal letter to President Wilson in which he paved the way for getting the president's support for the development of a national parks system. He knew that yesterdays' opponent could be tomorrow's ally. Congressman John Raker of California, who championed the Hetch Hetchy bill, became a sponsor of the bill proposing the creation of the National Park Service; and Franklin K. Lane, who was city attorney for San Francisco during the Hetch Hetchy conflict, became McFarland's ally when the National Park Service was first proposed. (By 1913 Lane had become Secretary of the Interior.)\n\nAmerica's forty-one national parks and monuments were managed by various authorities-including the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, and the Army. McFarland was among the first of those to suggest placing the parks and monuments under one unified bureau within the Department of the Interior in order to improve overall management and policy-making. In 1910, he began rallying support both within the government and from the public for this unification, gaining the favor of Secretary of the Interior Richard A. Ballinger. McFarland drafted the first version of a bill and then suggested calling in the nationally known landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmstead, Jr., for further drafts. Six years and three secretaries of the interior later the National Park Service was established in 1916. McFarland served on the Department of the Interior's Educational Advisory Board for the parks and also as a member of the National Park Trust Fund until his death in 1948.

The records reflect significant eras of inland waterway transportation and commerce, the enterprise of late eighteenth-century and early nineteenth-century Pennsylvania citizens and men of affairs, the interrelationships of navigation companies and railroad companies, and the eventual supplanting by the railroads of transportation services long performed in Pennsylvania by artificial canal ways. Furthermore, the Schuylkill Navigation Company Records provide some information on the period in the 1790s when Robert Morris and other Philadelphians were promoting the Delaware and Schuylkill Canal Company, which was made obsolete by the building of the Schuylkill Navigation Company and the Schuylkill and Susquehanna Canal Company. The latter company was supplanted by the Union Canal Company. The Union Canal Company established its artificial waterway in the valleys of the Tulpehocken and the Swatara to connect the city of Reading on the Schuylkill with Middletown on the Susquehanna.\n\nRecords touch at some points upon the careers of engineers like William Weston, who began but never completed the Delaware and Schuylkill and the Schuylkill and Susquehanna canals, and also Loammi Baldwin, who planned the Union Canal, disagreed with the Board of the Union Canal Company and broke with those gentlemen to let them adopt another plan which failed of satisfaction for several decades. They touch at other points the careers of celebrated engineers like Edward Miller and Solomon White Roberts and of noted bridge builders like Charles Ellet, Jr. They provide data on the first tunnel built in the United States. They outline the record of water power in manufacture for more than a century. They signalize the vast industrialism of nineteenth-century Pennsylvania made possible through the mining and transportation of coal. They recapitulate the performances, individual and collective, of skilled and unskilled labor and of management in the affairs of a company for more than a century; and they illustrate the financing and the development of a great waterway corporation and service.\n\nMore specifically, the records reveal the relations of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, later known as the Reading Company, with both the Schuylkill Navigation Company and the Susquehanna Canal Company, i.e., the canal commonly called the Susquehanna and Tidewater, descending along the bank of the Susquehanna River from opposite Columbia and Wrightsville to Havre de Grace, Maryland. Of particular interest here are maps and map books, especially those which record the early years of exploration and construction and others which picture property holdings and services of the last years of operation. Of similar importance are day-by-day, year-by-year, reports of rainfall and weather conditions along the canal; descriptions of conditions at dams, bridges, and locks, or on towing paths; registers of boats, their tonnages, and destinations; of amounts of water power dispensed; of heights of water at dams; of toll charges and regulations; and of costs of repair and maintenance.\n\nFinancial problems and solutions adopted by the Board of Managers are revealed in the books of subscribers to stocks, the books of loans and of dividends, the minutes of stockholders' meetings, the ledgers of business performed, the letter books and letters of the entire succession of presidents of the company, and the printed annual reports (few in number) of the Board of Managers. The record of human leadership in the enterprise is offered through many an eminent name: Cadwalader Evans, first president; Clement C. Biddle, first secretary and treasurer; Joseph S. Lewis and Joshua Lippincott, second and third presidents; Stephen Girard, financier; and Asa Packer, prominent promoter. The correspondence of Frederick Fraley, sixth president, is preserved for forty years; that of Engineer James F. Smith for thirty-three years; that of Engineer, Superintendent and Manager Edwin F. Smith for almost a half-century.\n\nThe record group is arranged in eight categories under A through H.\n\nA: Business Records, 1815-1951\n\nB: Accounts, 1825-1945\n\nC: Various [subjects], 1815-1940, n.d.\n\nD: Broadsides, 1825-1862, n.d.\n\nE: Maps, 1827-1948\n\nF: Maps, Blueprints and Tracings, 1846-1948, n.d.\n\nG. Printed and Typed Material, 1856-1940, n.d.\n\nH: Scrapbook, 1845, 1 volume.\n\nItems pertaining to environmental history are found within Sections A, C, E and F and summarized below.\n\nSection A\n\nThere are five boxes of \"Daily Reports of Water Measurement, 1880-1946.\"\n\nIn the sub series \"Diaries and Journals, 1859-1944,\" the volumes for the years 1877 through 1884 contain weather reports.\n\nGeneral Correspondence, 1816-1951, in fifty-one boxes, covers many environmental topics such as maintenance of canals, canal history, flood levels and locks.\n\nSimilarly, the \"Letter Press Books, 1849-1908, in twenty-one boxes, contain letters about water power, canals, railroads, and transportation issues.\n\nThe \"Survey and Level Books, 1835-1945\" in eight boxes is a useful source of information on bridges, reservoirs, sketches, locks, soundings, docks, and dams.\n\nSection C\n\nThe category titled \"Various\" contained in three boxes has items pertaining to \"description of locks and bridges, 1866-1891,\"\n\n\"History of Engineering,\" \"Letters on the Union Canal of Pennsylvania, 1821-1825,\" \"Reservoir Surveys with Calculation of water, 1846-1857,\" \"Statement of culm taken from Port Clinton, Kernsville, Felix's Dam, etc., 1906-1927 and numerous 19th and 20th century water power measurement reports.\n\nSection E\n\nThere are approximately seventy maps dated 1827-1948 showing for example the plan of the property and works of Schulykill Navigation Company, surveys of water line and plan and elevation of locks.\n\nSection F\n\nNumerous blueprints and tracings relating to the Schuylkill Navigation Company are valuable to study. Examples of topics portrayed include the Manayunk Water Company, rainfall charts, the canal from Philadelphia to Port Carbon, Pa., water supply drawings, plans of hollow breast and land belonging to the company.\n\nMG-128 Treziyulny Family Papers\n\n1758-1921\n\n(22 boxes and 13 oversized folders, digitized rolls 4553-45)\n\nArranged by chief correspondent and then by materials.\n\nIn the Treziyulny Papers are letters recording the surveying careers of Charles S. Treziyulny (b. 1757, d. 1851), styled on his tombstone at Bellefonte, Centre County, as \"Baron Charles Stegner Treziyulny, Polish exile,\" and of son, Henry P. Treziyulny (b. 1800, d. 1877), for many years county surveyor of Centre County. These other members of the Treziyulny family are represented: Charles T. Treziyulny (b. 1804), by occasional letters or drafts of surveys; and Joseph Franklin P. Treziyulny (d. 1862), son of Henry P. Treziyulny, by correspondence, school books, drafts of surveys, and miscellaneous items casting light upon his military service during the Civil War and his death at the Battle of Fredericksburg. There are a few items connected with surveyor R. J. Gibbs, who married Sarah T., daughter of Henry P. Treziyulny.\n\nThe more important papers are those associated with the professional services of Charles S. Treziyulny and his son, Henry P. These include drafts of single tracts or drafts of connected tracts of land surveyed by them in the central counties of Pennsylvania or of copies of drafts of surveys made in that general area by a number of official deputy surveyors of the Province of Pennsylvania and the successors of these in the early decades after that Province had become the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. These latter copies, secured from the Pennsylvania Land Office and assembled for professional surveying use in the time of Charles S. Treziyulny, in whose handwriting many appear to have been taken, illustrate the range of explorations of such eighteenth-century deputy surveyors as Richard Tea, Charles Lukens, William Maclay, Frederick Evans, John Canan, Joseph J. Wallis, and James Harris. Note that not all Pennsylvania counties are represented in surveys.\n\nItems relevant to environmental history are found chiefly in the following series.\n\nCharles S. Treziyulny Papers\n\n1769-1900, n.d.\n\nCorrespondence\n\nThe correspondence is filed in three folders and is also available on digitized microfilm.\n\nAs county surveyor for Centre County, Treziyulny did surveys for various purposes such as describing the natural resources of certain tracts of land for potential purchasers. One such letter to Treziyulny from A. Ferguson, April 1, 1828 illustrates this purpose. Ferguson asks\n\n\"How much land is contained in those connected tracts which you say includes the upper coal bank. Also [tell me how] near these lines come to the creeks or do they include any part of [it]? If not can it be ascertained who owns the land betwixt them and the creeks, this last would be a material item in our favour to have the advantage of the water power.\" [A. Ferguson to Chas. S. Treziyulyn, April 1, 1828, folder 2, box 1, digitized roll 4553]\n\nAnother function of surveying was to help establish estate claims. Here is a request from Thomas Diehl.\n\n\"The season is now at hand when the iron masters cut the principal part of their wood and I am informed wood to be considerable extent has already been cut from our lands. [Therefore,] we wish to arrest such robbery.\" [Thomas Diehl to Chas. S. Treziyulny, October 11, 1828, folder 2, box 1, digitized roll 4553]\n\nWithin the Charles S. Treziyulny Papers are various warrants, deeds and legal documents. A rental agreement between farmers in Boggs Township, Centre County offers a rare glimpse into local agriculture in the 19th century. In this example, Lavinia Treziyulny rents her farm to John O. McKinley. The agreement says that Treziyulny was entitled to\n\n\"One third of all the wheat, rye, corn, oats, buckwheat, barley, hay, strawberries, apples and corn fodder that the said J. O. McKinley should grow on the said farm.\" [Rental agreement between Lavinia Treziyulny and John O. McKinley, March 1, 1862, folder 4, box 1, digitized roll 4553]\n\nHenry P. Treziyulny Papers, Correspondence\n\n1766-1900, N.D.\n\nTreziyulny was often asked to identify natural landmarks or features such as woods and streams which were very desirable to buyers. A letter from Henry to his brother Charles in 1845 describes this characteristic of surveying.\n\n\"I wish you would inform me if there is any vacant land between the Muncy Mountains opposite [Bald?] Eagle running across to where Robert Holmes lives in Nittany or if you know anything about the Blue Springs between the mountains. I have been requested to make [a survey of] a tract of land; it is near where the Clinton County line crosses. It would be of some value as wood is now an object [for speculators].\" [Henry P. Treziyulny to Chas. S. Treziyulny, January 8, 1845, folder 3, box 2, digitized roll 4554]\n\nOften requests for surveys came from private land owners. A letter from Samuel Jack is an example.\n\n\"Sir, I have a tract of land known as the John Speer Tract on the mountains between Tyron and Milesburg. I wish you to write to me letting me know the earliest time you can meet me at the Tyrone City Hotel to go up to survey the land.\" [Samuel Jack to Henry P. Treziyulny, November 1, 1867, folder 8, box 2, digitized roll 4554]\n\nCharles & Henry Treziyulny Papers, Field Notes and Field Books\n\nCharles and Henry Trezyulny both kept various field note papers and volumes. These documents found within respective series under each person's name bear the markings and language of professional surveyors. The handwriting in the field notes are sometimes hard to decipher. But the documents do have information such as the latitude and longitude, mileage, acreage and natural landmarks of surveyed land. The name of the township or county or locale is not always apparent. Occasionally there is included a sketch or draft of a given tract of land.\n\nTreziyulny Family Paper Surveys\n\nThe surveys are the \"heart\" of this manuscript collection. Most are stored in oversized folders. When used in conjunction with the correspondence and field notes, the surveys help illuminate the work of the Treziyulny family. The following is a summary of topics covered by surveys. For a comprehensive list, see the finding aid for this collection in the archives search room.\n\nAllegheny County\n\nBedford County\n\nBerks County\n\nBlair County\n\nCambria County\n\nCentre County\n\nClearfield County\n\nClinton County\n\nCumberland County\n\nCurtin County\n\nHuntingdon County\n\nLycoming County\n\nMifflin County\n\nNorthumberland County\n\nUnion County\n\nWestmoreland County\n\nMultiple County Name Surveys\n\nMultiple natural scene surveys, i.e. mountains, creeks, valleys, furnaces\n\nRiver views\n\nRoad views\n\nMiscellaneous surveys and maps\n\nMG-154 Henry Howard Houston Estate Papers\n\n1895-1964\n\n121 cu. ft. in two series\n\nPapers of the estate of Henry Howard Houston (b. 1820, d. 1895) one of Philadelphia's wealthiest and most prominent citizens, who was involved in railroad, steamship, mining, and land development enterprises. Henry Howard Houston's great grandfather, John Houston, migrated from northern Ireland about 1725 and settled in what became Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Upon his death in 1769, the elder John Houston owned a farm exceeding 1,000 acres in the Pequea valley of Lancaster County. John Houston's eldest son, who was also named John, was born in Lancaster County in 1743 and attended Glasgow University where he received his certificate of attendance signed by Adam Smith, author of The Wealth of Nations. Subsequently earning a degree in medicine from the Medical School of the College of Pennsylvania (now the University of Pennsylvania) in 1768, the younger John Houston became a surgeon, along with four of his brothers, and served in the American Revolution where one of his brothers was killed at the Battle of Paoli. After the war, the younger John Houston acquired a large landed estate new present day Wrightsville in York County where he died in 1809. (He was married to Susanna Wright Houston (1732-1829) of Wright's Ferry, now Columbia, Pennsylvania, and one of his daughters was Martha Houston who married Joseph Mifflin and was the paternal grandmother of the noted Columbia poet and painter Lloyd Mifflin. For additional material on Lloyd Mifflin at the Pennsylvania State Archives see MG 165, Lloyd Mifflin Collection.) John Houston's son, Samuel Houston, was also trained as a physician at the Medical School of the University of Pennsylvania but apparently gave up the practice of medicine on account of ill health and retired to manage his properties in Columbia, Pennsylvania.\n\nSamuel Houston's son, Henry Howard Houston, worked at various jobs, including a stint at James Buchanan's Lucinda iron furnace in 1843, then for D. Lee and Company from 1847 to 1850, and finally for the Pennsylvania Railroad, where he was selected to organize the company's pioneer freight business from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh. He subsequently organized the American Steamship Company and the International Navigation Company, operating more than twenty ocean going steamships and many more that plied the waters of the Great Lakes. HHH (who was familiarly known as \"H cubed\" or \"Cubie\") was also a successful investor in gold and silver mines in Colorado and Montana and in the oil fields of western Pennsylvania, an investor in Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, long the largest land holder within the city limits of Philadelphia, and the developer of Chestnut Hill, Wissahickon Heights, and Roxborough. He also financed the construction of St. Martin-in-the-Fields Church in Chestnut Hill and St. Peter's Church in Germantown, and was a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania. He erected a 30-room stone mansion modeled on an Irish castle that he called Druim Moir (Gaelic for \"Great Ridge\") for his private residence. Situated amide 52 acres of lawn and woodland that included a small deer park, the mansion was surrounded by a number of other buildings including an older farm house, an entrance lodge, and two tenant dwellings and was connected to downtown Philadelphia by a new rail line. (Samuel Houston (1793-1863) who became the president of the Republic of Texas, and for whom the city of Houston, Texas was named, was a distant cousin of Henry Howard Houston.) For related materials, see the Henry Howard Houston Estate Papers at the University of Pennsylvania Archives and Record Center, the Smith Family Papers at the American Philosophical Society (Mss. Collection 76), and the Mifflin Family Papers in the Franklin and Marshall College Special Collections (Mss. Collection 32) at Lancaster, Pennsylvania.\n\nThis collection largely reflects the activities of mainly Henry Howard Houston's wife Sallie (1829-1913) his son Samuel Frederic Houston (1866-1952) and his granddaughter Eleanor Houston (1910-1987). The papers are chiefly legal and financial in nature, dealing with stocks, prices, industry company reports, financial market reports, and estate business. However, the collection also has much valuable information about electric, gas, nuclear energy, oil, railroad and water companies that the Henry Howard Houston Estate and its heirs invested in. The documents cover the period from about 1879 up to the early 1960s. Although the Houston Estate Papers collection is not arranged by subject, for the convenience of researchers, documents are listed here by natural resource and therein by type of materials.\n\nGas and Electricity\n\nConsolidated Natural Gas Company, 1943-1962\n\nThe documents of interest here consist of annual reports, proceedings of stockholder's meetings, prospectus, reports, and speeches.\n\nAnnual Reports are available for the period 1943 to 1949.

The second Standard Oil-Standard Oil of Ohio (Sohio)-emerged in 1870 when Rockefeller bought a refinery near Cleveland. Sohio rapidly became the dominant company in Rockefeller's oil empire in the late nineteenth century. Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso, later known as Exxon), founded in 1882, replaced Sohio as the primary Standard Oil firm after 1890. In 1911, in the U.S. Supreme Court case of Standard Oil Co. v. U.S. 221 U.S. 1 (1911), the federal government argued that Standard Oil had a history of buying out independent refiners and lowering prices to force competitors, who refused to joint the Standard Oil Trust, to declare bankruptcy. It therefore was in violation the federal 1890 Sherman Antirust Act. As a result of the court ruling, Standard was broken up into \"baby Standards\" and numerous miscellaneous companies independent of Standard Oil. Three of most powerful \"baby Standards\"-California, New Jersey, and New York-belonged to the \"Seven Sisters\" an oil industry nickname for the most influential American oil companies. The other four \"Sisters\" were Royal Dutch Shell, British Anglo-Persian Oil Company, Texaco and Gulf Oil. Below are examples of information on oil exploration, production, pipeline, and reserves about some of the Standard companies.\n\nStandard Oil of California (Socal) 1911-1933\n\nStandard Oil of California, also known as Socal, was founded in 1877.

When Gertrude Houston-the last of Henry Howard Houston's grandchildren-died in 1961, estate executors discovered that much of the wealth of the estate consisted of stock investments in Standard Oil of N J. In 1966, the company changed its name to Exxon. On March 23, 1989, when the oil tanker Exxon Valdez spilled 52 million gallons of oil into Alaskan waters, it was the worst environmental disaster at sea in American history. There is, however NO INFORMATION on the Exxon Valdez accident in MG 154 because holdings only the period 1913-1959 for predecessors of Exxon. Relevant items available include cli"
