The timeline includes entries of non-native Pennsylvanians and events outside of Pennsylvania that shaped and reshaped labor history in Pennsylvania.\n\nAll entries are cited from the Internet, but the majority of entries and their annotations are from:\n\nthe Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission Labor and Industry Heritage Markers website, http://www.phmc.state.pa.us/apps/historical-markers.html\n\nStories from PA History website, http://explorepahistory.com/storydetails.php?storyId=1-9-22&chapter=4,\n\nthe Philadelphia Area Cooperative Alliance Philadelphia Co-op History website, http://www.philadelphia.coop/phillycoops/philacoophistory/.\n\nThe timeline is a work in progress. The Pennsylvania Labor History Society invites everyone with labor history information to submit what she or he knows to the Society’s website contact person. For example, do you have information of an event, for example, the establishment of a union local or an occurrence of a local strike? Do you have information on an influential local person, for example, a leader of organized domestic servants in Pennsylvania’s northern tier? Then by all means, let the Society know for possible inclusion in the timeline.\n\nThe number in parentheses following an entry corresponds to the numbered entry on the Pennsylvania Labor History Society labor marker page.\n\nMany thanks to the following members of the Pennsylvania Labor History Society who contributed additional information and entries and/or who acted as proofreaders: Irwin Aaronson, Charles McCollester, Kenneth Wolensky, and James Young.\n\nI edited the entries, particularly the annotated entries, for punctuation, spelling, and verb tense (e.g. changing from present to past tense).
