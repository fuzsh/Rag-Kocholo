        "text": "Louis Dicken Wilson (May 12, 1789-August 12, 1847), was a son of William Wilson and wife Elizabeth Dicken, the owners of a good plantation south of Tar River in Edgecombe County. After receiving a modest education at the local Academy, Wilson went to the Town of Washington in 1807 and worked in a counting house while apparently reading law. He returned to Tarboro after a few years and qualified as a Notary Public on May 28, 1812, and as a Justice of the Peace on February 24, 1817.\n\nHe became an apprentice of the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons at Concord Lodge, No. 58 on March 16, 1813, and a Master Mason on July 20. He served as Secretary December 21, 1813-December 29, 1814, and as Junior Warden December 23, 1817-November 23, 1819. Elected Senior Grand Warden of the Grand Lodge on December 19, 1818, and Junior Grand Warden on December 19, 1825. He became the fourteenth Grand Master of Masons in North Carolina on December 15, 1827, and was succeeded by Richard Dobbs Spaight on December 19, 1830. His last recorded Masonic office was Grand Lecturer, December 15, 1833-December 27, 1837.\n\nWilson represented Edgecombe County in the General Assembly of North Carolina 1814-1819, collected the Tarboro taxes 1819-1829, and served as a State Senator in 1820 and from 1824 to 1832. He attended the Free Trade Convention at Philadelphia on September 30, 1827, and on December 19 was elected Brigadier-General of the 5 th North Carolina Brigade, a post that he appears to have held as late as 1846. He was one of the two delegates from Edgecombe County to the famous Constitutional Convention of June 4-July 11, 1835, and later, that year was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention.\n\nIn 1829, Wilson gave his first support to the infant public school movement, even advocating the education of free blacks. On January 4, 1831; he and Elder Joshua Lawrence were among the incorporators of the Hickory Grove Academy, and on September 30, he bought as his permanent home the handsome former residence of Congressman Thomas Blount. Erected in 1810, this building still ornaments the City of Tarboro. In 1838, he was elected a member of the Board of Trustees of The University of North Carolina, and in 1844, the State Senate placed him on its Committee of Education and on the Literary Fund Committee.\n\nReturning to the Senate in 1838, he represented Edgecombe County continuously until December 12, 1846, when he requested a leave of absence in order to support the patriotic honor of North Carolina by his personal participation in the War with Mexico (he served as Speaker at the 1842-43 session). Wilson left Raleigh for the last time on January 1, 1847, and returned to his native county where he was on January 5 elected Captain of Company A, First Edgecombe Volunteer Regiment, which was the first to offer its services to Governor William A. Graham. The volunteers met the next day at Toisnot Depot (now the City of Wilson) “to partake of a barbecue dinner and arrange plans prior to their departure.”\n\nCaptain Wilson’s Company arrived at Fort Johnson near Wilmington on January 8, for their mustering into the United States Army and a brief preparation before embarking from Smithville for Mexico in the schooner E.S. POWELL on February 22. He and several other officers had meanwhile returned to Tarboro to participate in a splendid dinner at Pender’s Hotel on January 9, and the huge celebration on January 18, at which a beautiful silken banner provided by several patriotic women were received with an appropriate speech by Captain Wilson. It was not until March 6, that the Edgecombe County Companies A and E arrived at Brazos, from which they proceeded the next day to San Francisco on the Rio Grande.\n\nOn March 3, 1847, President James K. Polk offered to Captain Wilson the post of Colonel of the 12th Regiment of the United States Infantry, which the latter accepted at Washington City on April 9. It was expected that his command of 850 would leave Vera Cruz and proceed towards Mexico City on August 7, as the guard with a train of supplies for General Winfield Scott’s Army; but Colonel Wilson had been stricken six days earlier with the dreaded yellow fever and died on August 12, 1847. The military funeral and burial were held the following day, but his leaden casket was shipped subsequently to Edgecombe County. An appropriate oration was pronounced at Tarboro on May 22, 1850, upon the occasion of the laying of the cornerstone of the monument erected to his memory. Since November 1, 1904, both his casket from the neglected rural graveyard and the monument from the old Court House lawn have remained united on the Tarboro Town Common.\n\nAlthough Colonel Wilson never married and left no known descendants, he merits the remembrance and the appreciation of posterity, not only because of the numerous public services already recited, but also because of his then-immense bequest of $40,000 to Edgecombe County for the future benefit of its public poor people. It should be mentioned in passing that about $12,000 were properly utilized, $10,000 lost by unsound investments, and $18,000 enjoyed by certain officials during the period of Southern Reconstruction.\n\nIt is gratifying to remember that the Town of Wilson was incorporated and named in his memory on January 29, 1849, followed by Wilson County on February 13, 1855.\n\nHugh Buckner Johnston\n\nThe formation of Wilson County was not a task that was accomplished by a single group of men, but rather by many people over a long period of time.\n\nThe extremely poor conditions of roads made travel to county seats difficult. The lack of bridges made crossing of streams possible only by fording or by ferries. Fording in periods of high water could be hazardous. Attendance at court for jury duty, legal affairs, and musters was a burden. This burden was borne by more and more people as the population increased.\n\nThe earliest attempt to form a new county in what is now Wilson County occurred in the 1787 General Assembly (“attempt” is defined here as the introduction into the General Assembly of a bill to form a county).\n\n1787: The journal of the House of Commons for Thursday, November 29, 1787, shows that Mr. William Sheppard, of Dobbs, presented a petition and a bill for dividing the counties of Dobbs, Wayne and Edgecombe and erecting a new (unnamed) county. The bill was sent to the Senate.\n\nThe journal of the Senate for the same day shows that Mr. Benjamin Sheppard, of Dobbs, introduced the same bill into the Senate. The bill was read and rejected. The petition was signed by 189 persons.\n\nA second petition reading somewhat differently accompanied the first and had 65 signatures.\n\n(See LP-77 N.C. Department of Archives and History and microfilm C328. 1. N87 in the Carolina Collection. UNC Library)\n\n1805: In December 1804, a petition was circulated among the inhabitants of the counties of Wayne, Edgecombe, Nash, and Johnston for the formation of a new county. The petition contained 609 signatures.\n\nNote that Dobbs County does not appear among the petitioning counties. Dobbs has, by this time, been divided and renamed. Also note that Nash and Johnston Counties have been added.\n\nThe journal of the House of Commons for November 30, 1805 shows that Mr. Matthew C. Whitaker, the representative from Halifax County , presented the bill and petition to erect a new county to be named ” Jefferson .” The bill was read the first time and rejected.\n\n(See LP-213 N.C. Department of Archives and History and microfilm NCA.1.a:b, Reel 7)\n\n1813: In a broadside issued by Mr. Farmer in 1852 he mentions an attempt to form a new county “nearly 40 years ago, viz 1813.” A search of the journals of the Senate and the House of Commons for the years 1811 through 1815, inclusive, brought no evidence of this attempt. It is possible that a petition was circulated but not introduced as a bill in the General Assembly.\n\n1828: The journal of the Senate for December 1, 1828 shows that Mr. Willis Boddie, the Senator from Nash County , presented a petition for the erection of a new county. The petition contained 409 signatures.\n\nOn December 10, 1828 , Mr. Emanuel Shober, the Senator from Stokes, reported that the Committee of Propositions and Grievances resolved that the prayer of the petitioners “be not allowed.” Mr. Richard Spaight, the Senator from Craven, moved that the report and the resolution be laid on the table. No evidence was found that it was ever recalled.\n\nNo journal entry was found concerning a counter-petition from the citizens of Nash County that no part of their county be taken. There were 108 signatures in the counter-petition.\n\n(See LP-427 and microfilm MC A.1. a: b reel)\n\n1829: The effort in the 1829 session of the North Carolina General Assembly to form a county approximately the same as the present Wilson County was characterized by some unusual political maneuvering.\n\nIt was on Saturday the 28 th of November 1829 that Mr. Gabriel Sherard, the Senator from Wayne, “presented a petition of sundry citizens of the counties of Wayne, Edgecombe, Nash and Johnston, praying the erection of a new county out of a part of the said counties of Wayne, Edgecombe, Nash, and Johnston. On motion of Mr. Sherard, ordered that the said petition be laid upon the table. Mr. Sherard also gave notice that he should move an amendment to the bill, proposing to erect out of apart of the counties of Burke and Buncombe a separate and distinct county, so as to provide for the erection of a new county out of the aforesaid counties of Wayne, Edgecombe, Nash and Johnston in compliance with the prayer of the petitioners.”\n\nOn December 8, 1829 , Mr. Allen from the select committee to whom was recommitted the bill to erect out of a part of the counties of Burk and Buncombe a separate and distance county together with the amendment proposed thereto, made a report thereon; which was read, and on motion of Mr. Sherard ordered that the said report, together with the bill accompanying the same be laid upon the table.\n\nThe select committee of which Mr. Allen was a member removed the amendment added by Mr. Sherard. The bill without the amendment was indefinitely postponed.\n\nA search of the boxes of Legislative Papers for this session of the General Assembly failed to produce the petitions from the citizens of the four counties nor was a copy of the bill nor any committee reports found.\n\n(The Journal of the Senate for the 1830 session of the General Assembly show that on Friday the 29 th of November 1830, Mr. Sherard presented the same documents as used in the 1829 session.)\n\nSee the “Tarboro Free Press” microfilm: Tar FB&S-2.\n\nSee the “Raleigh Register” microfilm: RaRRsw-7\n\nSee the originals of the Journals of the Senate and the House of Commons or see microfilm: NC A.1.a:b Reel No. 8\n\n1830: On Friday, November 26, 1830 , the Journal of the Senate shows that Mr. Gabriel Sherard, the Senator from Wayne, “presented the petition of sundry citizens of the counties of Wayne, Edgecombe, Nash and Johnston, praying the erection of a new county out of parts of the aforesaid counties which, on motion of Mr. Sherard, was ordered to be referred to the select committee to which it referred the bill to erect out of a part of the counties of Burke and Buncombe a separate and distinct county, together with the documents and papers on file in the Clerk’s office which were presented on the same subject at the last session.”\n\nThe Journal of the Senate for December 21, 1830, shows that “on motion of Mr. David Newland, the Senator from Burke, ordered that the committee of the whole House be discharged from the further consideration of the bill to erect out of a portion of the counties of Burke and Buncombe, a separate and distinct county by the name of Yancey; and the bill being read the second time, Mr. Sherard moved to amend the bill by adding a new section, proposing to erect a county out of portions of the counties of Wayne, Johnston, Edgecombe, and Nash, by the name of “Spaight”; which amendment was not agreed to – ayes 27, noes 35. The ayes and noes being demanded by Mr. Sherard were listed.\n\nOn January 5, 1831 , Mr. Sherard asked for and received permission to withdraw from the files of the Senate the petition of sundry citizens of the four counties praying the erection of a new county presented at the session by a memorial, to establish a new county, by the name of Wilson .\n\nMr. Dancy who had introduced the bill called it up and on his motion it was ordered to lie on the table.\n\nThe journal of the House of Commons for January 18, 1849 , reads “the bill to establish a new county by the name of Wilson was now read the second time.\n\n“Mr. Brodgen moved to amend the bill by adding to the first part thereof the following proveso: “Provided a majority of the qualified voters for members of the Counties of Edgecombe, Nash and Wayne respectively shall vote in favor of the new county of Wilson, at an election to be held according to the provisions of an act to be passed supplemental to this act.” Whereupon Mr. Paine moved to amend the amendment by striking out the words “Counties of Edgecombe, Nash and Wayne respectively, shall vote in favor of the, and by adding thereto, the words shall vote in favor of said County of Wilson’. Pending the consideration of which amendment a motion was made by Mr. Griggs, that the bill, with the amendments, be indefinitely postponed, which motion passed in the affirmative- yeas 57, nays 42.”\n\nThe memorial was signed by 700 persons.\n\n(For the bill and petition see LP 639 in the Department of Archived. For the journals see the published records)\n\n1850: In the November 20, 1850 , issue of the Standard of Raleigh , N.C. there was a notice: “Applications will be made to the next Legislature of North Carolina to get an act passed to form a new county by the name of Wilson out of portions of the counties of Edgecombe, Nash, Johnston and Wayne.” The notice was signed “Many Citizens.”\n\nOn December 4, 1850 , Mr. Joshua Barnes, the member of the House of Commons from Edgecombe, introduced a bill accompanied by a memorial, to lay off and establish a county, by the name of Wilson .\n\nThe journal of the Senate for January 23, 1851 , records that the engrossed bill was received from the House, read the first time and passed. On January 25, 1851 , the bill was called up for its second reading. Mr. William Thompson of Johnston , offered an amendment. Mr. John H. Drake, of Nash offered a proviso to the amendment. The proviso and the amendment were defeated. Mr. Thompson then moved that the bill be indefinitely postponed, which motion was carried.\n\n(For the bill and the petition see LP-650 in the Department of Archived and History. For the journals see the published records.)\n\n1852: An ad ran in the September 15, 1852 , issue of the Raleigh Standard reading the same as the ad in 1850.\n\nOn December 1, 1852 Mr. W. Ellis the member from Edgecombe was granted leave and introduced a bill to establish “a county by the name of Weldon (Sic) which was read the first time and passed and referred to the committee on Propositions and Grievances.”\n\n(The Raleigh and Tarboro papers properly reported the county name as Wilson.)\n\nOn December 6, 1852 , Mr. Norfleet of Edgecombe, presented instructions from 813 voters of the County of Edgecombe , against the new county. Which motion was laid on the table.\n\nOn December 24, 1852 , after some maneuvering, the bill was indefinitely postponed by a vote of 39 to 37.\n\nTo the bill was attached a map. It was the first, and only, time a map was presented showing the outline of the County of Wilson . It is essentially the same as finally adopted in 1854/55. Oddly the boundaries as outlined in the 1852 bill read clockwise, while those adopted at the next session of the General Assembly read counter-clockwise.\n\nAt the 1852 session Mr. John W. Farmer of Edgecombe, Mr. Henderson H. Williams, of Nash, Mr. Robert Cox, of Wayne, and Mr. Daniel Hokett, of Johnston, had a lengthy broadside , supporting the new county, printed a copy laid on the desk of each member of Assembly.\n\nMr. J.M. Taylor, of Nash, had an equally lengthy rely printed and also laid on the desk of each member.\n\n(The bill, the amendment, and the map can be found in LP-682. The memorials were withdrawn for use in 1854. For the journals see the published records.)\n\n1854: Edgecombe County was the only one of the four counties involved in the formation of Wilson County that had a newspaper, copies of which are still available. Since almost 50% of Wilson County was formed from Edgecombe we are fortunate to have had such good coverage.\n\nThe summer of 1854 was filled with electioneering. The Southerner of Tarboro did not print the speeches of the candidates but did print several “letters-to-the-editor.” Two friends of the “new county,” Joshua Barnes and David Williams were overwhelmingly elected.\n\nOn December 4, 1854 , Mr. Joshua Barnes of Edgecombe, introduced a bill to establish a new county by the name of Wilson , which was read the first time, passed, and referred to the Committee on Propositions and Grievances. On December 6, 1854 , Mr. Barnes presented a memorial to establish a new county by the name of Wilson.\n\nThe petition contained 873 signatures.\n\nThe petition of citizens of Edgecombe County against the new county had 813 signatures.\n\nThe journal of the House of Commons for Dec. 12, 1854 records that “Mr. Barnes, from the Committee of Propositions and Grievances to whom was referred a bill to establish a new county by the name of Wilson , reported a substitute therefore; which was read the first time and passed.\n\nThe bill read as follows:\n\n“A Bill to lay off and establish a County by the name of Wilson .” Sec. 1. Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of North Carolina and it is hereby enacted by the authority of the same – That a County by the name of Wilson, shall be and the same is hereby laid off and established out of portions of Edgecombe, Nash, Johnston, and Wayne Counties, in the following bounds. Beginning at a lightwood stake in the Pitt County line; thence a direct line to Pender’s Mill; thence to a direct line to Town Creek at the mouth of Col. David Williams’ Mill branch; thence up said Mill branch to the Mill; thence a direct line by William Adams, Serr. To the Nash line (thence a direct line to William M. William’s bridge across Toisnot Swamp; thence with the Smithfield road to Turkey Creek bridge; thence with said road to Mockasin; thence down the various courses of said creek to the mouth of Turkey Creek); thence a direct line to the Red Hill (Henry Horn’s old place); thence a direct line to the Wayne County line at the Juniper Swamp; thence the Wayne and Johnston line north to a point in a direct line from the Red Hill to Ruffin’s Bridge; thence a direct line to Ruffin’s Bridge, diverging North at the house of Jacob Hooks, so as to leave the dwelling house of said Hooks in the County of Wayne; thence from said Ruffin’s Bridge down Contentnea Creek to the Greene County line’ thence the Greene County line to the beginning and the said county shall be, and is hereby invested with all the rights, privileges and immunities of the other counties in this State.”\n\nQuite a bit of legislation action took place on January 23, 1855 . The House Journal for that day reads:\n\n“On motion by Mr. J. Barnes, the bill to establish the county of Wilson was taken up and read the second time.\n\nThe bill then passed its second reading – yeas 72 nays 23. The rule being suspended the bill was read the third time, passed, and was ordered to be engrossed.\n\nThe journal of the Senate for January 27, 18555 records that “The engrossed bill to lay off and establish a county by the name of Wilson, was read the first time, passed, and referred to the Committee of Propositions and Grievances.”\n\nOn February 1, 1855 the Committee of Propositions and Grievances reported the bill to the Senate with amendments. They recommended an amendment by striking out all after the words “Nash line and inserting in lieu thereof the following. “Thence a straight line to Turkey Creek Bridge near Bridger’s old place, thence with the road to Moccasin Creek Bridge, thence down said creek to the junction of Moccasin and Turkey Creek,” and with this amendment they recommend passage of the bill.\n\nThe journal of the Senate for February 2, 1855 reads as follows: “The engrossed bill – was read the second time; the amendment proposed by the committee amended on motion by Mr. Drake, and adopted as amended. The bill passed its second reading 30 to 4 . The rule being suspended the bill was read the third time and passed. The bill was sent back to the House of Commons for concurrence in the amendment.\n\nThe journal of the House for February 6, 1855 shows that the House did concur in the amendments and so informed the Senate.\n\nA supplemental bill setting up the government of the county was quickly passed.\n\nThe bill establishing the county was ratified on February 13, 1855 and became Chapter 12 of the Public Laws of North Carolina, 1854/55. The supplemental bill was ratified February 14, 1855 and became Chapter 13 of the same laws.\n\nThe news was received in Wilson with great joy and was properly celebrated.\n\nOn Monday, April 23, 1855 , the first Court of Pleas and Quarter Sessions was convened and organized. Wilson County was now a full-fledged county!\n\nAbstracted, with permission, from The Formation of Wilson County\n\nBy J.M. Daniel, Jr.\n\nAgriculture in Wilson County began developing when settlers came from the Chesapeake Bay area and Isle of Wight County in Virginia. They came along Contentnea Creek and set up homes within three or four miles of Wilson. Francis Roundtree owned two large tracts of land on Contentnea Creek in 1739. Land patents were issued for most of Wilson County lands during the 1740’s. According to information gathered by former County Extension Chairman W.D. Lewis, several clearing had been made along the lower half of Contentnea Creek, Toisnot Swamp and Town Creek by the 1760’s. The fields of that day were studded with stumps and trees. Open range law existed, and cattle and hogs were put into the open woods to fend for themselves.\n\nAfter the Revolutionary War, settlers of English and Irish descent continued immigration from Virginia. They quickly established plantation sized holdings in the more level areas of the eastern and southwestern parts of the county. Later, immigrants of poor means came into the more rolling areas of the western side of the county. This can be seen as the small owners outnumber the tenants west of Wilson, while the opposite is true on the east side.\n\nUntil 1880, the tar and turpentine industry was the main source of cash. The agriculture of the early day settlers was a subsistence type, growing corn, cotton, rice, wheat, home gardening, hogs, sheep, and cattle.\n\nCorn has always been the leading subsistence crop in the county. Cotton became an important cash crop immediately after 1865. On September 2, 1890, the first market sale of tobacco was made at Wilson. From that time, the tobacco acreage increased very rapidly. The minor subsistence crops from 1879 to 1909 were oats, wheat, cow, peas, hay and sweet potatoes. With the exception of wheat, the acreage of all these crops increased considerably between 1879 and 1909.\n\nThe census reports that in 1919, corn yielded an average of 24 bushels to the acre. This corn was fed mostly to hogs and work animals. The crop was grown in all parts of the county. Cotton, which is next to corn in acreage, yielded an average of 8 / 10 bale to the acre in 1919. This crop was generally grown over the county. Tobacco was third in point of acreage. The census of 1920 reports that in 1919 the average yield was 752 pounds to the acre. This crop was also grown in all parts of the county. According to the 1920 census, there were 16,000 apple trees, 8,000 pear trees, 750 peach trees, 562 cherry trees, and 1,200 grape vines in the county.\n\nThe livestock industry was of comparatively slight importance. The estimate of animals sold and slaughtered in 1919 was $775,000.00 or about 5% of the total value of all agricultural products. A large number of mules, horses, and milk cows were shipped in annually and resold at the local stables. Several dairies, which supplied the town of Wilson with milk, were in the vicinity. The dairy cows were Holstein and Jersey, or grades of these breeds. The 1920 census reported the value of dairy products, excluding those used at home at $38,909.00. Practically every farmer had one cow and from one to four hogs. Poultry and eggs for home consumption were produced on almost all farms. A few were sold or traded at the local stores. The value of poultry and eggs in 1919 was #298,000.00. The total value of all agricultural products in 1919 was $298,000.00, of which $13,675,000.00 was the approximate value of tobacco and cotton.\n\nLess than 20% of the 1790 population were slaves, meaning that the plantation system never became as strong as it was in Edgecombe, Pitt and Wayne counties. The proportion of blacks grew to around 40% during the Civil War. Cotton became an important cash crop immediately after the Civil War and reigned until World War I. Soon, about 40% of the cultivated lands were in cotton. Elm City boasted of being the second largest cotton market on the Atlantic Coastline Railroad. Wilson was also a large cotton market. Between 1880 and 1920, there was big cotton production around here, according to county historian Hugh Johnston. However, little by little, the production of tobacco pushed out the production of cotton after 1920. Tobacco was the main dollar crop. At one time, there was more than 20,000 acres of cotton grown in the county. Then the boll weevil struck in the late 20’s. The grey beetle’s larvae caused rotting of plants when they hatched in immature bolls of cotton. Wilson County agent Bill Adams wrote in 1929 that farmers would be forced to discontinue growing cotton.\n\nModern technology came, bringing machines for planting, cultivating, and harvesting. Chemicals came: fertilizers, insecticides, herbicides, and defoliants. Nevertheless, the boll weevil stayed, and yields continued at about a half a bale per acre. Acreages of cotton began dropping from 43,804 in 1925, to 14,663 in 1945, to 10,695 in 1955, to 6,853 in 1965. Cotton acreage fell to only 67 acres in 1975. Since then cotton has grown in a small way. Total for 1983 was 249 acres.\n\nThe census of 1920 shows 77.5% of the county in farms, with the remainder in wooded areas. The forest is found mainly in the swamp areas on slopes approaching the streams. The trees are prevailing pine with some sweet gum and hardwood on the uplands, and gum, sweet gum, and a few pines in the swamp. Some of the forest was being cut for lumber, but most of it was reserved for future growth, for firewood supply for country homes, and for use in making tobacco sticks or fuel for curing tobacco.\n\nIn 1920, the average value of all farm property was $7,000 per farm. Of this amount, 75% represented land, 14% buildings, 3.6% implements, and 6.7% domestic animals. The farm homes were, as a rule, substantial and nicely planted. Many of the tenant homes were small. The bars were sufficiently large to house the work animals and feed. The tobacco barns were constructed mostly of logs or planks. Barbed wire was used for fences. Many of the farms were worked with one-horse implements, including breaking plows, spiked tooth harrows, and walking cultivators. Both horses and mules were used as work animals, but the mules predominated.\n\nIn 1919, 75% of the total area of the county was in farms, which averaged 41 acres in size. The average acres of improved land to the farm was 22 acres. The farms ranged in size from about 10 acres to about 100 acres. Some holdings ranged in size from about 1,000 to about 2,000 acres in size. The larger farms were commonly divided into smaller tracts and sub-let to tenants.\n\nIn 1920, the population of the county was 36,813, of which 26,201 were rural. The average density of the rural population was 70.2 persons to the square mile. The rural sections were evenly populated.\n\nThe average assessed value of land in 1920 was $127.18 an acre. The selling price, however, ranged from $100.00 to as much as $500.00 per acre. Good, average land brought about $150.00 an acre. The price of the pocosson land was dependent usually on the value of the standing timber.\n\nFarm values continued to increase until about 1980, when the peak in farm prices was seen. Since that time, there has been a gradual decline in prices of farmland in Wilson County. In 1940, there were 2001,000 acres in farms in the county with an average size of 49 acres. In 1983, there were 143,496 acres in farms in the county with an average size of 158 acres. Crop yields in 1940 for corn were 22 bushels to the acre. That year there were 40,000 acres of corn grown. By 1980, the average yield in the county had risen to 66 bushels, with 36,100 acres planted that year. Tobacco acreage in 1940 was 29,167 acres. The average yield per acre was 1,001 pounds per acre. This had also risen in 1983, to an average yield per acre of 2,285 pounds with 9,730 acres being planted in the county. Soybean and wheat yields continued to increase over the years. During these four decades, there was a continued increase in the use of fertilizer and chemicals such as herbicides, insecticides, fumigants, and defoliants. All of this was part of the modern area in farming.\n\nTractors first began to appear on the farm in Wilson County in the late 30’s. The number of tractors increased over the decades. Combines, corn pickers, pick-up hay balers and other modern types of farming equipment came on the scene in the early 50s in large numbers. Farms began that same time to decline in number and increase in size as the man in agriculture could utilize larger acreages with fewer laborers using modern day technology. Electricity came into the county sometime in the early 40s. This helped to make life on the farms much easier and increased the use of automatic milkers, small electric motors, and other electrical labor saving devices.\n\n1850-1936\n\nHarry Barton – Greensboro , NC.
