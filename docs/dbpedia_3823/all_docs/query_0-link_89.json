        "text": "Land titles (Chapter 6)\n\nImportant things in Chapter 6\n\n Final title – land had been surveyed by the quantity surveyor  Pejabat Tanah Daerah bagi hakmilik HSM/GM/PM atau Pejabat Tanah Galian Negeri (PTG) bagi hakmilik HSD/GRN/PN.  Qualified title – land had not been surveyed by the quantity surveyor  Whether the rights of qualified owner are the same as rights of final title owner.  Each state has its own land offices, did not have centralized combination system at the state level. The current status is that land search must do at respective state. In each state, will have a registry title that is kept in registry office, land office title (RDT) is kept in respective land offices (Pejabat Tanah Daerah). E. if you are from Melaka, need to know how many land offices and location of land offices.  Every state will have one registry (E. Pejabat Hak Milik Tanah Negeri Melaka). E. Melaka has three land offices. If your land title is located in Jasin, then need to go to land office in Jasin to do searches.  RDT - copy of title kept in land office, RDT is conclusive evidence of register, it is the feature of Torrens System that embodied the mirror principle and the curtain principle.  IDT – kept by the owner  Private searches are cheaper than official search because official search will bear the seal and signature indicating you has official record.  Note: 1 acre = 0 hectare, 1 hectare = 2 acres, 1 acre = 43,560 square feet, 1 hectare = 107, 593 square feet.  Form 5C, 5B, 5D, 5E indicate that they are final titles.  Town land, village land are registry title. Country land (mukim) is land office title. But if the mukim land is smaller than 4 hectares, then it falls under registry title.  Rekod urusan under land title will indicate other transactions such as charge, easement or lease. If there is no indication of other transactions, it will be deemed as clean title because the land title only indicates the record of ownership. Entry of private caveat will not appear on land title, for example, if someone has interest on the land before the transactions, the interested buyer may apply to enter into private caveat against your land. Form 19B that to be used for the entry of private caveat will be endorsed and appear only on the RDT.  The landowner can only provide you the IDT aka such as the Borang 5B, Borang 5CK.\n\nTypes of titles (S NLC)\n\n Register\n\nObligation of land office is to maintain the register because this is to ensure the principle of Torrens System which is registration is everything. This can be reflected in the form of certificate of title. Upon the alienation of land by the State authority, it is known as alienation complete with the land title been issued in the sense that a new document of title will be issued with the particulars of land description and the description of landowner will be on the land title. E. will have Geran no pendaftaran, no lot, bandar, negeri.\n\n Land titles\n\nEnd products of alienation is a land title (hak milik tanah).\n\nAs stated in S(a) of National Land Code, the register document of title shall be conclusively vested in the proprietor.\n\nMoreover, S of NLC stated that the name appear as the proprietor is the current owner of the land.\n\nLand title serves as evidence of ownership. The first person appears on the land title is the first owner (the person who received the land alienated by the State authority).\n\nWith a title, proprietor can deal with the land under NLC. This means that can deal with the alienated land under division 4 from part 14-17. Part 14 is the transfer part, part 15 is the leases and tenancies, part 16 is charges and liens, part 17 is the easements. These are the types of dealings recognized under the NLC.\n\nLand title basically bears two particulars: who the proprietor is, and which land he owns in the terms of the description of land that he owns. E. Quick rent amount would be stated in the land title. Date of registration will be stated, geran number may change but lot number will remain the same if it is the same area, but if there is amalgamate and subdivision, there would be changes to the lot number. The lot number will remain if it is continuation of the new title, but the geran no, geran mukim, pajakan negeri, pajakan mukim, hsd code, hsm code may change.\n\nLand plan (pelan tanah) will be attached to the land titles, which is certified by the authorized person such as the Pengarah. Land ownership and lain-lain hal will be attached to the land titles too.\n\nThe land title could be computerized or handwritten.\n\nThe land title must have seal and signature, without them, it would be incomplete registration.\n\nProcedure of Registration\n\nPart Five – Chapters 1, 2, 3 and Five (A)\n\nS of NLC\n\nForms of Title\n\ns 77(1) of NLC The titles under which State land may be alienated under this Act are— (a) Registry title and Land Office title (being forms of final title); and (b) qualified title.\n\nDefinition of ‘form” – 14th Schedule\n\nForm 5B / 5BK – Grant o Grant has three common features, the first is land title kept in the registry, and it is a final title. Grant is granted in perpetuity.\n\nForm 5C / 5CK – State Lease o State lease is final title. State lease is alienated for lease of certain years, maximum is for 99 years. It is kept in the registry.\n\nForm 5D / 5CK – Mukim Grant o Mukim grant is land office title. It is a final title.\n\nForm 5E / 5CK – Mukim lease\n\n(d) All things attached to the earth or permanently fastened to anything attached to the earth whether on or below the surface (e) Land covered by water [subject to S &amp; S(1)]\n\nLook at the land from the physical features\n\n(ii) Category of lands - Another way to look at the land is from the category of lands - S(2) of NLC states that for the purpose of this Act, land shall be classified as follows (a) Land above the shoreline o Town land (tanah bandar) E. bandar melaka o Village land (tanah pekan) o Country land (tanah mukim) (E. Mukim Jasin - outskirt areas) or - Area which is covered by water is also known as land. (b) Land which is foreshore and sea-bed (land below the shoreline) - It is important to know whether the land is town land, village land or country land because it could be used to determine whether the title shall be deemed as land office title or registry title.\n\n(iii) Classification of lands - Land could be classified into (a) State land (b) Reserved land (c) Mining land (d) Alienated land (e) Land held under a subsidiary tile under Strata Titles Act 1985 and (f) Land in parts of Malacca provided for in Part VIII of NLC (Penang and Malacca Titles) Act 1963 as Malacca customary lands. (Previously under deed system then change to Torrens system) - Note: if the land title is subdivided, all land must have access to the main road (this can be indicated in land plan)\n\nTypes of Title for alienated land (S of NLC)\n\n State land may be alienated under NLC as follows: (1)Registry title (Hakmilik Daftar) [HM(D) atau HS(D) stands for hakmilik sementara daftar] or o Registry title will be appropriate in the following cases: (i) Town, or village land, country land &gt; 4 hectares in area, or land classified as foreshore or as sea-bed [S(3)(a)]  Note: Registry title shall be appropriate in the case of town or village land. Hence, this means that the location of land shall determine where the title is kept, such as if the land is in town area, hence it is town land, then it will be kept in registry. Country land would fall under the category of registry title in the event that that the area of country land is more than 4 hectares. Land classified as foreshore or sea-bed must be registry title not land\n\noffice title. S(b) of NLC stated that land office title shall be appropriate in the case of any country land not exceeding four hectares in area.\n\n(ii) Country land not &gt; 4 hectares in area where the State Authority directs that this land to be held on registry title [first proviso to S(3)]  Note: The general rule is that country land not exceeding 4 hectares shall be land office title as seen in S(3) of NLC. However, exception to this is that if the State Authority directs that county land not exceeding 4 hectares to be held on registry title, then it could be registry title as seen in first proviso to S(3), hence we can deduce that this is discretionary. The reason behind this exception is that initially the land title is a big land area exceeding 4 hectares, and this means that initially it was a registry title kept in registry, later the landowner planned to develop the land into housing estate which he applied for subdivision of land, the application would be submitted to the State director instead of Land Administrator since the land title was kept in registry office. Thus, after application of subdivision will also remain as registry title, even though the land area is smaller than 4 hectares.\n\n(iii) Land held under an appropriate title under previous land law [S]  Note: If previous law (E. National Land Code (Penang and Malacca Titles) Act 1963) stated that it is registry title, then it would remain as registry title.\n\no The title in NLC could be registry title and land office title. Registry title and land office title could be in the form of final title if the land had been surveyed, if not surveyed can be in the form of qualified title. Qualified title can be in registry and land office. o S of NLC defined Registry title as title evidenced by a grant or a State lease, or by any document of title registered in a Registry under the provisions of any previous land law. o Registry title can appear in the form of Borang 5B (Grant) and Borang 5C (state lease), this is supported in S of NLC. This depends on the duration of alienation (s), if the duration of alienation is in perpetuity, then it is grant (geran), e. if the land title stated “tanah yang diperihalkan di atas adalah dipegang untuk selama-lamanya” Meanwhile, if the duration of alienation is for certain years then it is state lease (pajakan negeri), e. tempoh 99 tahun. o S of NLC defined Land Office Title as title evidenced by a Mukim Grant (Geran Mukim lease (Pajakan Mukim), or by any document of title registered in a Land Office under the provisions of any previous land law. o Land office title can appear in the form of Borang 5D (Mukim Grant) and Borang 5E (s) (Mukim lease). This depends on the duration of alienation, if the duration of alienation is in perpetuity, then it is mukim grant. Meanwhile, if the duration of alienation is for certain years, then it is Mukim lease. o The main difference between registry title and land office title is that it gives effects for certain actions. For example, in the case of order for sale (S(2))\n\nLicensed Land Surveyors Act 1958, and where boundary marks have been placed on the land. Hence, this implied that the boundary had been surveyed and fixed when it comes to final title. o It shall be noted that S(1) of NLC stated that if there is surveyance of land for the purpose of alienation under Final Title, the boundaries determined on the survey shall accord as nearly as indicated in the plan and description. o In addition, State Authority could be referred to by the Director of Survey and Mapping to cause the boundaries to be re-determined, as provided under S(3) of NLC. o S86 of NLC - in the case of land alienated under Registry Title (a) the RDT shall consist of grant in Form 5B or a state lease 5C (b) the issue document of title shall consist of a copy of RDT (c) both the RDT and IDT shall include a plan of land, certified as correct by Director of Survey and Mapping. o S87 of NLC - in the case of land alienated under Land Office Title (a) the RDT shall consist of Mukim Grant in Form 5D or Mukim Lease in Form 5E (b) the IDT shall consist of a copy of RDT. (c) Both the IDT and RDT shall include a plan of the land, certified as correct by or on behalf of the director of Survey and Mapping. o Pauline Lee Bee Lian V Pengarah Tanah Dan Galian  The registered proprietor of the land is applicant, and the applicant has qualified title no. HSD 66481 with estimate measurement of 10, 683 square feet and the land was used by the applicant to erect a bungalow. Madam Tan Soh Gee sold the land to the applicant during the 1992 and the registration of transfer of title was completed on 6.12. The said land was alienated approximately during the 1960s and the erection of the bungalow on the land was approved. In June 2008, the applicant was surprised to receive a letter stating that there was intervention on part of the applicant into the adjacent land.  The court held that although there was difference between the area of the land on the absolute title and from the qualified title, but in the NLC, State authority cannot be sued by the applicant by virtue of S(4) of NLC. o Registry title: Grant (form 5B) or State lease (form 5C) o Land office Title: Mukim Grant (Form 5D) or Mukim lease (Form 5E) o Rights of registered proprietor (S NLC)  Land alienated as final title shall be indefeasible as provided in Part Twenty [S(1)]. This is supported by S(1) NLC stated that the title shall be indefeasible, this means that if the person’s name appears on the land title, prima facie such person is the landowner. However, it could be defeated by S(2), S(3) and S(4) of NLC such as forgery, unlawful acquisition, fraud, land had been forfeited, land had been sold under order for sale, or the lease had come to end, or by operation of law under equitable principles. Under these situations, land title could be defeated, hence land shall be deleted and not to appear in land title.  Other rights [S(2)]\n\n(i) Sub-division, partition, amalgamation (ii) Dealings: Transfers (part 14 division IV), leases and tenancies (Part 15) charges and liens (part 16), surrenders, easements (Part 17). (iii) Rights to dispose of the land by will. (This means to pass down the land to any beneficiaries through will upon the death of the testator)\n\n(2)Qualified title (Hakmilik Sementara) [QT (HS)] o Qualified title (S of NLC) means title issued under Chapter 2 or 3 of Part Eleven, that is to say, in advance of survey. o S of NLC - Purposes of qualified title are (I) To enable land to be alienated in advance of survey (This means that before the land can be surveyed by the quantity surveyor, the land office or the state authority wants to alienate the land to the person and approve the alienation) (II) To enable title to be issued in advance of survey to the individual portions into which any alienated land is to be sub-divided or partitioned or amalgamation. (This means that sometimes the person applied for subdivision and had submitted the plan, but it was not finalized and surveyed by the authority, since there may be some areas need to be reserved. Hence, under this situation, they will issue a qualified title since the land had not been surveyed.) o Qualified title – Classification and forms (S of NLC) (i) This can be seen in S(1) and (2) of NLC (ii) Registry title [QT(R) – qualified title registry or HS (D)] is in Form 11A (iii) Land office title [QT(M) – qualified title mukim or HS(M)] is in Form 11B o S. 177(2) of NLC stated that the documents of Qualified title shall consist of the RDT which shall be in Form 11A or 11B (determined whether the title is in Registry title or Land office title) and issue document of title which shall be a copy of the registered document. o Qualified title: Rights of registered proprietor (S(2)) (i) Qualified title will confer on the proprietor the like rights in every aspect as those conferred [S] by final title, except that the boundaries of the land shown on the document of title thereto will be provisional only and the land will not be capable of being sub-divided or partitioned or included in any amalgamation. This means that if the owner has qualified title, he still can have same dealings in respect of land likewise as final title, have indefeasible title, can bring action against the trespasser. However, the land under qualified title could not be sub-divided, partitioned, amalgamation, since the land is not surveyed. (ii) Qualified title confers indefeasibility subject to S of NLC as seen in Tan Ah Boon v The State of Johore, this case supported the right to deal with the land under qualified title, as similar to final title. (iii) Qualified title holder may transfer lease or charge the land as seen in Yap Lai Yoke v Chin Fook Wah.\n\na) cause the boundaries to be demarcated on the surface of the land according to the plan and description by reference to the approval of the State authority unless it has been done or in his opinion impracticable, b) prepare a plan of the land for the purpose of being copied onto the documents of Qualified title c) in case of land held under Land Office Title, issue in accordance to s177 and s (ca) cause a requisition for survey to be prepared and sent to the director of survey and mapping d) in case where land held under registry title, send the plan prepared in (b) to registrar to be issued. o Conversion of Qualified title to Final Title  S of NLC stated that when the title has been surveyed according to S of NLC, final title may be issued in continuation of qualified title.  S192(1) of NLC provided that the documents of Final title to be prepared, registered and issued shall consist of a register document in form of Grant, State Lease, Mukim Grant or mukim Lease (respective whether the title is held under the form of Qualified title corresponding to Registry title or Land office title and in perpetuity or in term of 99years). An issue document in the form appropriate under this act to be the register document.  S192(3) of NLC provided that the registration of the documents of title prepared shall consist of their authentication under the hand and seal of registrar or Land authority. The date of registration shall be inscribe on the documents by Registrar or Land authority.\n\nBoth types of title (Registry or land office title) may be issued as a final title (S(2)) or qualified title (S(1)) read together with S(1)(a) and (b).\n\nNote: This is determined through whether the area alienated has been surveyed. If it is surveyed, it is known as final title. If it is not surveyed, it is known as qualified title.\n\nE. Borang 11A stated “Hakmilik Sementara Bersamaan dengan Hakmilik dalam Pejabat Pendaftaran”, this means that it is a qualified title kept in the registry office (registry title). Hence, this means that the land had not been surveyed yet.\n\nNote: DHKK stands for documen hakmilik komputer, this can be seen in the corner of computerized land title.\n\nThe complete land title must bear the seal, and signature.\n\n(3)Strata Title (Hakmilik Strata) o For strata titles, it has two forms, borang 4 and borang 3. Borang 4 will show the grant number and lot number and floor number and unit number. Borang 3 will be the whole master title whereby it will show the details of other conditions and restriction interests and all the endorsements. If made search on strata titles, the report must show the borang 4 which indicates the personal particulars on the parcel ownership and any transaction thereon. o Another type of title is Strata title which may be issued by State Authority under Strata Titles Act 1985 (Act 318).\n\no This is a title issued for building which has been subdivided and each “parcel sold to all purchasers”. o Previously, before 1985, strata titles were issued under NLC which were known as subsidiary titles. However, because of the increased development of flats, condominium, apartments, hence, the government enacted separated statute known as Strata titles Act 1985 to manage the issuance and managing of strata titles.\n\nRegister Document of Title (RDT) and Issue document of title (IDT)\n\n Replacement title will be chopped as “Salinan kedua”. This is to indicate that the title is not original title, but it is duplicate title. Hence, as a lawyer, must be careful when dealing with the duplicate title, because such title may be obtained by the person at the land office through forgery.  Title always comes in duplicate.  RDT is kept by the Registry or Land Office.  IDT is kept by the registered proprietor or charge/lien holder.  Register Document of Title (RDT) o RDT is defined in S of NLC as any document registered, or prepared for registration under this Act and evidencing or, as the case may be, intended to evidence title to land, and any document evidencing title to land registered before the commencement of this Act under the provisions of any previous land law; o S(1)(a) of NLC provided that the for the purpose of alienation of land under Final title, there shall be prepared in accordance to s86 or s87 as the case may be, a document of registered document of title in accordance to s88. o S. 88 of NLC stated that the registration grant/ state lease shall consist of authentication under hand and seal of registrar and mukim grant/lease shall consist of authentication under hand and seal of Land Authority. The date of registration shall be inscribed by registrar or Land authority. o S of NLC stated that the RDT registered shall be a conclusive evidence that the land title belong to the name in RDT and the conditions, restrictions are provided in the RDT  IDT (kept by the owner) o S of NLC stated that “issue document of title” means any document prepared for issue to the proprietor of any land (whether under this Act or under the provisions of any previous land law), being a copy of, or an extract from, the register document of title relating thereto; o S 85(1)(b) of NLC stated that for the purpose of the alienation of land under final title, there shall be prepared in accordance with section 86 or, as the case may be, 87 and the issue document of title, which shall be issued to the proprietor of the land in accordance with the provisions of section 90 o S 90 of NLC stated that when the issue of IDT is ready the LA will serve a notice under Form 5E to the proprietor requiring him to attend according to the terms in the notice, for the purpose of taking delivery and to pay any item revenue outstanding. o S of NLC stated that documents on which copy memorials to be made pursuant to section 305.\n\no The court held that the Registrar of Land Titles shoulder the obligation to ensure and maintain a system of land registration that is accurate, reliable and trustworthy, by doing so, confidence could be built among the public in the sense that they do not have to go behind the title to find out how the registered owner has the land. By doing so, it could maintain the features of Torrens system and at the same time S of NLC is given effect.\n\nSummary\n\nRegistry title\n\nGrant (Form 5B)\n\nState lease (Form 5C)\n\nQT(R)/HS(D)\n\nLand Office Title\n\nMukim Grant (Form 5D)\n\nMukim Lease (Form 5E)\n\nQT(M)/HS(M)\n\nCategories of land use\n\n NLC recognized three categories of land use, such are “agriculture”, “building” and “industry” under S(1) of NLC.  S of NLC defined agriculture as includes the cultivation of any crop (including trees cultivated for the purpose of their produce), market gardening, the breeding and keeping of honey-bees, livestock and reptiles, and aquaculture;  S of NLC defined building as includes any structure erected on land;  Previously, from March 25 to May 31, 1985, NLC recognized 4 categories of land use which are “agriculture”, “commercial”, “residential” and “industry”. However, later, “commercial” and “residential” had been merged into one category which is “industry”. Land title will show the category of land use e. “Kategori Penggunaan Tanah – Bangunan”. It is important to note that in the land title, if the category penggunaan tanah there states tiada, this does not mean that the land did not have any land use, every land has its own land use assigned to it, under this situation there needs to be interpretation in the sense that whether it falls under perusahaan, perniagaan, or pertanian. If the land was planned to use for agriculture, but the land was used for housing development purposes, under this circumstance, application to change category of land use must be made, it may amount to breach of category of land use if does not apply for change of category of land use, then it could cause forfeiture of land.  For current title (new title), means that the title is alienated after the commencement of NLC (1/1/1966) , there shall be endorsement of category of land use, cannot put “Tiada”, and the land title must be endorsed with “condition” as stipulated in S(1) (b) of NLC, the condition could be express and implied, for example, under Syarat- syarat nyata (Condition) it stated “Untuk bangunan kediaman sahaja”.\n\nLand Alienated before the Commencement of NLC and had been approved before the commencement of NLC but was alienated after the commencement of NLC\n\n When it comes to land alienated before the commencement of NLC, generally the category of land use could be either building, agriculture, or industry without the need to modify the category of land use.  S. 53(1) and (2) of NLC stated that land alienated before commence of NLC, until a category of land is imposed under S of the Cod, it will be subject to an implied condition that it shall be used for agriculture purposes only  S. 53(3) of NLC (i) Town/village land under Land Office title and country land which, immediately commencement of NLC, is not subject to an express condition (ii) Town/village land under Registry title, it will subject to an implied condition that it shall not be used for agricultural or industrial purposes. o In the proviso (i) of S. 53, it said that the continued used of the land for any agriculture or industrial purpose permitted before the commencement of NLC will not be rendered it unlawful o Proviso (ii) of S. 53, building lawfully erected before or after the commencement, the erection of which would be lawful if the land was subject instead to the appropriate category is also permitted  Garden City Development Bhd v Collector of Land Revenues, Federal Territory o The court held that implied condition that it shall not be used either for agricultural or industrial purposes would be imposed on land held under registry title and it is a question of fact whether or not such land can be used for the erection of building after the commencement of NLC would need to consider the construction of the condition endorsed in the document of title. Moreover, the court explained that the proviso embodied in the section is to relax some stringent prohibition against the use of land in this category for agricultural or industrial purposes.  Land Executive Committee of Federal Territory v Syarikat Harper Gilfillan Bhd\n\n S(1)(b) of NLC state that the proprietor of any alienated land may apply to the  State Authority under this section for the rescission of any express condition or restriction in interest endorsed on, or referred to in, the document of title thereto, or the removal from that document of the expression “padi”, or any other expression by virtue of which the land is subject for the time being to the implied conditions specified in section 119;  Of there is omission on part of the registered proprietor to satisfy the condition or requirement or abandoned the land, the state land may be subjected to forfeiture.  Pengarah Tanah dan Galian, Wilayah Persekutuan v Sri Lempah Enterprise Sdn Bhd o The court held that the discretion of State Authority is not unfettered and there must be fair, reasonable imposition of the conditions, moreover the conditions imposed must be related to the permitted development of the land in question.

Noor &amp; Anor o The court held that by virtue of S(1) of NLC, application could be made by the proprietor to the State Authority under that section for the recission or amendment of any express condition endorsed on the title. Thus, application could not mde by person not being the proprietor to rescind or amend an express condition even though he may have interest in the land.  E. Condition of land in land title “Tanah ini hendaklah digunakan untuk mendirikan bangunan perniagaan sahaja.”  S(1) of NLC stated that “Condition” does not include restriction in interest, or any condition expressed or implied in any agreement to which State authority is not a party.  There are two types of conditions namely implied and express conditions as stated in S of NLC. For restriction interest it is “sekatan-sekatan kepentingan”. Condition does not include restriction interest.  S(1) of NLC “condition requiring continuous performance” means any condition which requires the proprietor of any land to do, or refrain from doing, any act during the whole of the period for which the land is alienated, or for so much of that period as remains (a) after the date on which the condition takes effect; o This means that condition takes effect upon the registration of alienation. E. if the condition stated that “tanah ini hendaklah digunakan untuk menanam kelapa getah”, then such land must be used to continuously plant rubber trees. However, if wish to change to other types of plantations, there must be application made to change the condition. (b) after the expiry of any particular period specified in the condition; or (c) after the occurrence of any particular date or event so specified;\n\no Examples of “condition requiring continuous performance” are under S NLC, S(1)(a)(d)(e), S(1)(a)(c)(d), S(1)(a)(b)(c), S(1)(a)(b)(d) and S(a)(b)(d).  S(1) of NLC “condition subject to a fixed term” means any condition which requires the proprietor of any land to do any act before, or refrain from doing any act until, the expiry of any particular period, or the occurrence of any particular date or event, specified in the condition. o Hence, we can see that the condition imposed on the proprietor may be positive act or negative act. Example of this provision may be “tanah ini hendaklah digunakan untuk membina bangunan banglo dalam tempoh 3 tahun dari Tarikh pendaftaran”. o Examples of “condition subject to a fixed term” are S(1)(b)(c), S(1)(a), S(1)(c), S(c) of NLC.  S of NLC stated that every condition or restriction in interest shall run with the land to which it relates and shall bind the proprietor thereof for the time being and every person or body having or claiming any interest in the land, howsoever derived. o This means that where the land had been alienated and registered not from the date of approval but from the date of registration. This can be shown in the case of Dr. Ti Teow Siew &amp; Ors v Pendaftar Geran-Geran Tanah Negeri Selangor and UMBC v Syarikat Perumahan Luas Sdn. Bhd. (No. 2).\n\n Implied condition o Conditions are in the law itself (NLC), not written in the document of title. Implied condition may not be put expressly or in written form, but it could be implied from NLC. o It is in respect of land use and boundary marks. o S of NLC stated that all alienated land shall be subject to the following implied conditions relating to the boundary marks thereof: (a) that the proprietor will take all reasonable steps to prevent their damage, destruction or unlawful removal;  Hence, this means that the proprietor cannot simply dig holes on the land that damaged the land. (b) that the proprietor will, if any of them are damaged, destroyed or unlawfully removed, give immediate notice of the fact to the Land Administrator, or to the penghulu having jurisdiction in the area in which the land is situated;  For example, if the land damage was not on part of the proprietor, but due to landslides, then the Land Administrator must be notified or the penghulu must be notified if it is in relation to country land. (c) that the proprietor will, if so required by the Land Administrator, pay the cost of repairing or, as the case may be, replacing any of them which may have been damaged, destroyed or unlawfully removed; and (d) that the proprietor will, if so required by the Land Administrator, at his own expense clear any boundary line between any of them. o S of NLC: “implied conditions on what you can or cannot do on agriculture land” o S of NLC: implied condition on what you can or cannot do on “building land”\n\no S of NLC stated that State Authority may also direct that any land shall be subject to such express conditions after being alienated.  This provision means land may be subjected to express conditions after alienation. o S of NLC – variation of conditions, restrictions, and categories. Under this provision, proprietor may have his land subject to a certain express condition to be deleted or changed.  This means that the proprietor could apply for changes of express condition in compliance with the procedures under S of NLC. o Collector of Land Revenue, Johor Bahru v South Malaysia Industries Bhd  The court held that power to impose the express condition on the said land is granted to the State Authority as can be seen in S of NLC, and it could bind the proprietor as stated in S of NLC. By virtue of section 122(d) the State Authority has power to impose &quot;such conditions as it may think fit with respect to&quot;, inter alia, &quot;the use to which any building is to be put&quot;. Hence, this basically means that power to impose restrictions as to user of the factory on the land in question could be done by the State authority.\n\n Inconsistency between Express Conditions and Implied Conditions o It shall be noted that there must be prevailing of express condition if there is inconsistency between express condition and implied conditions, except there would be prevailing of implied condition if it is related with boundary mark. o S 115(3) of NLC stated that the conditions specified in sub-section (1) [such as no building shall be built on agriculture land; commencement of cultivation shall within 12 month...]shall be implied in the case of any land to the extent only that they are not inconsistent with any express conditions to which the land is for the time being subject. o S 116(3) of NLC stated that the conditions specified in sub-section (1) [within two years of that date be erected thereon a building suitable; maintained in repair...] no part of the land shall be used for agricultural or industrial purposes; shall be implied in the case of any land to the extent only that they are not inconsistent with any express conditions to which the land is for the time being subject. o S 117(2) of NLC stated that the conditions specified in sub-section (1) [used only for industrial purposes; industry shall commence operations within three years; no such building or installation shall be demolished, altered or extended without the prior consent in writing of the appropriate authority.....] shall be implied in the case of any land to the extent only that they are not inconsistent with any express conditions to which the land is for the time being subject. o S 120(4) of NLC stated that no condition shall be imposed under this section which is inconsistent with any implied condition to which the land becomes subject on alienation by virtue of section 114. o Pengarah Tanah dan Galian, Wilayah Persekutuan v Sri Lempah Enterprise Sdn Bhd  A piece of land was owned by respondent in perpetuity and subdivision and conversion of land were applied by the respondent. It was allowed\n\nhowever it was subjected with condition that the respondent must agree to accept back a lease for 99 years in exchange for their property.  The Federal Court held that no power is conferred to the authorities to make the respondents surrender their free hold land and receive in exchange a 99 years. Conditions relevant to permitted development must be imposed by the authorities and authorities should act fairly and reasonably.\n\nRestriction in interest\n\n Restriction in interest is defined by S of NLC as “restriction in interest” means any limitation imposed by the State Authority on any of the powers conferred on a proprietor by Part Nine, or on any of his powers of dealing under Division IV, and any like limitation imposed under any previous land law.  Sometimes, the description of the restriction interest would be very long, and it may not have sufficient space to endorse all on the land title within the four corners, hence code would be inserted on the land title under the section of Sekatan-sekatan kepentingan like Kod AA, such must be cross refer with the code kept in the land office.  E. of restriction interest (Sekatan-sekatan kepentingan) “tanah ini boleh dipindahmilik atau dipajak dengan kebenaran bertulis oleh Pihak Berkuasa Negeri”. Hence, there are two restriction interest imposed on this land which are pindakmilik and pajakan. Hence, this implied that if need to lease or charge the land, then need written consent from the State Authority.  Restrictions in interest means that it put restrictions on proprietor to make any dealings. For example, tanah ini tidak boleh dipindahmilik, dipajak atau digadai kecuali dengan kebenaran bertulis daripada Pihak Berkuasa Negeri”, hence, this means that written consent must be applied from the State authority to procced with the dealings. It also means it put restrictions on proprietor to subdivide or partition his land, to amalgamate his lands or to subdivide a building.  Restrictions of interest is imposed on approving alienation of land and endorsed in the document of title.  Restrictions imposed must be conformable to law.  If the dealings go against the restriction in interest, the caveatable interest would be invalid and it would be unable to register, and if registered it would be void with the result that the title or interest obtained is defeasible and the appropriate party may set aside.  Toh Huat Khay v Lim A Chang o The court held that it would be void if there is a transfer registered going against an express restriction in interest and convers on the registered proprietor a defeasible title.  Dr. Ti Teow Siew v Pendaftar Geran-Geran Tanah Negeri Selangor o The issue here was whether the commencement of the restriction in interest was from the date endorsed on the title or date when the alienation was registered? o The court held that the date of registration of the RDT was the commencement of the restriction in interest."
