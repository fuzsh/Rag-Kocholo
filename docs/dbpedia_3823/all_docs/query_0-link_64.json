This Historic Preservation Fund grant project investigated the archaeological resources of Benton County, Indiana with a focus on the northern half of the county. Approximately 841.29 acres (340.46 hectares) of agricultural land were surveyed and 85 new archaeological sites were recorded. The survey recovered 81 prehistoric artifacts and 442 historic artifacts from twelve parcels of land within Benton County. No human remains were discovered as a result of this grant project. Cultural periods that are represented in the artifact assemblage include precontact components dating to the Late Archaic, Middle Woodland, and possibly the Early Archaic, in addition to 54 Historic components.

This Historic Preservation Fund grant project investigated the archaeological resources of Benton County, Indiana with a focus on the northern half of the county. Approximately 841.29 acres (ac) (340.46 hectares [ha]) of agricultural land were surveyed, and 85 new archaeological sites were recorded. The survey recovered 81 precontact artifacts and 442 historic artifacts from 12 parcels of land within Benton County. Cultural periods that are represented in the artifact assemblage include precontact components dating to the Late Archaic, Terminal Middle Woodland/Late Woodland, and possibly the Early Archaic, in addition to 54 Historic components. The average site density recorded in the project area for precontact sites was one site per 20.03 ac. The average site density recorded in the project area for Historic sites was one site per 15.58 ac. Through these surveys we have been able to document special use of unique microenvironments that are characterized by dry upland rises surrounded by a combination of diverse ecozones within a small area providing rich and diverse resource for precontact inhabitants of northwest Indiana.\n\nThe Applied Anthropology Laboratories (AAL) at Ball State University conducted a data enhancement project for archaeological resources in Newton County, Indiana for a FY2014 Historic Preservation Fund Grant (Grant #18-14-FFY-03).

This Historic Preservation Fund grant project investigated the archaeological resources of Newton County, Indiana with a focus on the two central townships, Beaver and Jackson, and under-represented ecological communities within Newton County based on FY2014 and FY2015 surveys. A total of 932.27 acres (377.27 hectares) of agricultural land were surveyed, which includes 5.63 acres of resurveyed area, and 110 new archaeological sites were recorded. The survey recovered 103 prehistoric artifacts and 4,063 historic artifacts from nine parcels of land within Newton County. No human remains were discovered as a result of this grant project. Cultural periods that are represented in the artifact assemblage include precontact era Middle Archaic, Middle-Late Archaic, Late Archaic, and Late Woodland components, in addition to Historic components. The average site density recorded for the project area for precontact sites was one site per 24.53 acres and for Historic sites was one site per 10.02 acres.\n\nThe Applied Anthropology Laboratories (AAL) at Ball State University conducted a data enhancement project for archaeological resources in Jasper County, Indiana for a FY2014 Historic Preservation Fund Grant (Grant #18-14-FFY-02). This Historic Preservation Fund grant project investigated the archaeological resources of Jasper County, Indiana with a focus on major waterways such as the Iroquois and Kankakee Rivers in the southern half of the county. Approximately 900 acres (364.22 hectares) of agricultural land were surveyed and 112 new archaeological sites were recorded. The survey recovered 209 prehistoric artifacts and 307 historic artifacts from seven parcels of land within Jasper County. No human remains were discovered as a result of this grant project. Cultural periods that are represented in the artifact assemblage include Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, and Late Woodland/Late Prehistoric components that were documented from the precontact era, in addition to Historic components.

The focus of this Historic Preservation Fund Grant project was three-fold. First, this research targeted Dearborn County, Indiana, specifically focusing on Late Prehistoric period (cf. Fort Ancient) settlement and community organization patterns. AAL targeted previously identified Late Woodland and Late Prehistoric archaeological sites for pedestrian survey, soil phosphate, and geophysical investigations. Second, AAL attempted to identify new archaeological sites through pedestrian survey of agricultural fields in the county. Third, AAL attempted to reinvestigate five archaeological sites (12D200 and 12D272 in Township and 12D202, 12D203, and 12D205 in Township) for the purpose of data correction and enhancement. Approximately 345.67 acres (139.89 ha) of agricultural land underwent pedestrian survey, encountering 50 archaeological sites (5 reinvestigated sites, and 45 newly defined sites) and 12,363 artifacts. Sites 12D45, 12D396, and 12D480 were subjected to soils (chemical and geophysical) analysis (24.5 acres, 9.91 ha) revealing new details of community organization. The project recovered 12,297 prehistoric artifacts and 66 historic artifacts from the ten survey areas that underwent pedestrian survey. Multiple cultural periods are represented in the artifact assemblage recovered from pedestrian surveys, including diagnostics of the Middle Archaic, Middle Woodland, Late Woodland, and Late Prehistoric. Multiple cultural periods are represented in landowner collections obtained for this project as well. These include the Early Archaic, Middle Archaic, Late Archaic, Terminal Archaic, Early Woodland, Middle Woodland, Late Woodland, and Late Prehistoric. Artifact assemblages from pedestrian survey and landowner collections both contain historic artifacts. Overall, the average site density recorded for the project is one archaeological site per 7.18 acres (0.14 sites/acre). Excluding SA2, this overall site density becomes one archaeological site per 8.60 acres. Density for survey areas within the Uplands is one archaeological site per 31.54 acres. Density for survey areas within the lowlands is one archaeological site per 1.84 acres. The average artifact density for this project is one artifact per 0.03 acres (34.42 artifacts/acre). When excluding SA2, this average artifact density is one artifact per 1.33 acres (0.75 artifacts/acre). Of all the sites from this project, a total of nine are recommended as potentially eligible for Indiana Register of Historic Sites and Structures (IRHSS) and the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP)\n\nThe Applied Anthropology Laboratories at Ball State University conducted a data enhancement project for archaeological resources in Newton County, Indiana for a FY2015 Historic Preservation Fund Grant (Grant #18-15FFY-05).
