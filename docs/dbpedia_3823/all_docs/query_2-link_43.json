        "text": "Dimensions of sleeping mattresses\n\n\"Single bed\" redirects here. For the song by Fox, see S-S-S-Single Bed.\n\nStandard bed sizes are based on standard mattress sizes, which vary from country to country. Bed sizes also vary according to the size and degree of ornamentation of the bed frame. Dimensions and names vary considerably around the world, with most countries having their own standards and terminology. In addition, two mattresses with the same nominal size may have slightly different dimensions, due to manufacturing tolerances, amount of padding, and support type. Mattress sizes may differ from bedding sizes.\n\nNomenclature\n\n[edit]\n\nNaming standards on different bed sizes and their corresponding actual measurements can vary across national standards. Examples of such nomenclature are names like \"Single\", \"Double\", \"Queen\" or \"King\" size. Sometimes the naming standards are further divided by adding adjectives such as \"Narrow\", \"Wide\", \"Extra Wide\", \"Long\", \"Extra Long\" and so on, which also can vary across national standards.\n\nFor example, a King size bed may measure (in width by length):\n\n152 cm × 198 cm (60 in × 78 in) in the UK.[1]\n\n165 cm × 203 cm (65 in × 80 in) in New Zealand.[2]\n\n180 cm × 190 cm (71 in × 75 in) in Portugal, but is also available in 195 and 200 cm (77 and 79 in) lengths.[3]\n\n180 cm × 200 cm (71 in × 79 in) in Indonesia.[4]\n\n183 cm × 191 cm (72 in × 75 in) in Singapore[5] and Malaysia.[6]\n\n183 cm × 203 cm (72 in × 80 in) in Australia.[7]\n\n183 cm × 216 cm (72 in × 85 in) in India.[8]\n\n193 cm × 202 cm (76 in × 80 in) in the US.[9]\n\nBecause of the growth of international trade and the above potential cause of confusion, bed sizes are becoming more standardized. In most countries, using the International System of Units, bed dimensions most often appear in centimeters, and often only by width and length.[10] In the United States, Canada and other regions influenced by the former British Empire, dimensions are often in inches.[11]\n\nEurope\n\n[edit]\n\nEurope may traditionally have had more variations in national bed size standards than any other part of the world,[12] but in the recent years a few sizes have become more common than others. Bed sizes are defined in centimeters in all European countries, although supplementary Imperial equivalents are sometimes shown in the United Kingdom.\n\nToday, the most common widths sold by pan European retailers are:\n\n90, 100 and 120 cm (35, 39 and 47 in) for single beds.[13]\n\n160, 180 and 200 cm (63, 71 and 79 in) for double beds.\n\nOther sizes are also available in some European countries (e.g., 80 or 140 cm (31 or 55 in)), but the widths listed above are the most common when looking at the European market as a whole, while 135 cm (53 in) and 150 cm (59 in) (nominal) are more typical in the UK and Ireland.\n\nToday, the 200 cm (79 in) length is the most common bed length sold by pan-European retailers. Lengths of 210 or 220 cm (83 or 87 in) are often also available by special order. The longer beds are intended for taller people,[14] and as a rule of thumb 210-centimeter-long (83 in) beds may be recommended for people 190 cm (75 in) or taller, while 220 cm (87 in) beds are recommended for people over 200 cm (79 in) tall.[15]\n\nFrance\n\n[edit]\n\nIn France, single size beds are usually:\n\n90 cm × 190 cm (35 in × 75 in)\n\nor 90 cm × 200 cm (35 in × 79 in).\n\nThe most common sizes for double beds are:\n\nValet size 140 cm × 190 cm (55 in × 75 in)\n\nQueen size 160 cm × 200 cm (63 in × 79 in)\n\nKing size 180 cm × 200 cm (71 in × 79 in)\n\nItaly\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Italy, beds are classified by name and use the term piazza as in \"place\". Standard sizes are:[16]\n\nuna piazza (literally \"one place\") or singolo (\"single\"): 80 cm × 190 cm (31 in × 75 in) and 90 cm × 190 cm (35 in × 75 in)\n\nuna piazza e mezza (literally \"1+1⁄2 places\") or Letto da prete (literally \"priest's bed\"): 120 cm × 190 cm (47 in × 75 in)\n\npiazza e mezza francese (literally \"French 1+1⁄2 places\"): 140 cm × 190 cm (55 in × 75 in)\n\ndue piazze (double, literally \"two places\") or letto matrimoniale (literally \"matrimonial bed\"): 160 cm × 190 cm (63 in × 75 in) and 180 cm × 190 cm (71 in × 75 in)\n\nNorthern Europe\n\n[edit]\n\nThese sizes are for Austria, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Germany, Poland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Iceland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. There are some variations between different countries, but these are the most common sizes. Until the 1980s the most common mattress length was 190 cm (75 in).\n\nSingle:\n\n70 cm × 200 cm (28 in × 79 in), mainly for double beds with two separate mattresses.\n\n80 cm × 200 cm (31 in × 79 in), mainly for young peoples beds/ bunk beds and double beds with two separate mattresses.\n\n90 cm × 200 cm (35 in × 79 in), common single bed. Extended variants are typically 210 cm (83 in).\n\n100 cm × 200 cm (39 in × 79 in), new common single bed size.\n\n120 cm × 200 cm (47 in × 79 in), uncommon, often as futon beds that are sold with mattress, slats and frame.\n\n140 cm × 200 cm (55 in × 79 in), common, especially among young people.\n\nDouble:\n\n140 cm × 200 cm (55 in × 79 in)[17]\n\n160 cm × 200 cm (63 in × 79 in), common, often with two separate mattresses.\n\n180 cm × 200 cm (71 in × 79 in), most common double bed,[18] often with two separate mattresses.\n\n200 cm × 200 cm (79 in × 79 in), a common extra-wide bed, often with two separate mattresses.\n\n210 cm × 210 cm (83 in × 83 in), a common extra-wide bed, often with two separate mattresses.\n\nNetherlands\n\n[edit]\n\nSizes listed refer to mattress sizes.\n\nSingle:\n\n80 cm × 200 cm (31 in × 79 in), small single bed.\n\n90 cm × 200 cm (35 in × 79 in), average single bed.\n\n90 cm × 210 cm (35 in × 83 in), average single bed.\n\n90 cm × 220 cm (35 in × 87 in), average single bed.\n\n100 cm × 200 cm (39 in × 79 in), large single bed.\n\n100 cm × 210 cm (39 in × 83 in), large single bed.\n\n100 cm × 220 cm (39 in × 87 in), large single bed.\n\nDouble:\n\n120 cm × 200 cm (47 in × 79 in), small double bed (\"twijfelaar\").\n\n140 cm × 200 cm (55 in × 79 in), average double bed.\n\n160 cm × 200 cm (63 in × 79 in), average double bed.\n\n160 cm × 210 cm (63 in × 83 in), long double bed.\n\n160 cm × 220 cm (63 in × 87 in), extra long double bed.\n\n180 cm × 200 cm (71 in × 79 in), large double bed (\"Lits Jumeaux\").\n\n180 cm × 210 cm (71 in × 83 in), large double bed.\n\n180 cm × 220 cm (71 in × 87 in), large double bed.\n\n200 cm × 200 cm (79 in × 79 in), extra large double bed.\n\n200 cm × 210 cm (79 in × 83 in), extra large double bed.\n\n200 cm × 220 cm (79 in × 87 in), extra large double bed.\n\nPortugal\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Portugal, the most common widths for beds are:\n\nsolteiro (single): 80 cm (31 in) or 90 cm (35 in)\n\ncasal (double): 140 cm (55 in)\n\nQueen size: 160 cm (63 in)\n\nKing size: 180 cm (71 in)\n\nSuper king size: 200 cm (79 in)\n\nBeds are typically 190 cm (75 in) or 195 cm (77 in) long, but 200 cm (79 in) have become more common.\n\nSpain\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Spain, standardized lengths are 180, 190 and 200 cm (71, 75 and 79 in), with 190 cm (75 in) being the most common. Standardized widths are 80, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150 or 180 cm (31, 35, 41, 47, 53, 59 or 71 in). The most common bed sizes are:\n\nindividual (single): 90 cm (35 in)\n\nmatrimonio (Spanish) or matrimoni (Catalan) (double, literally \"matrimonial\"): 135 or 150 cm (53 or 59 in)\n\nUK and Ireland\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, beds are measured according to the size of mattress they hold,[19] not the dimensions of the bed frame itself; bed frame sizes are not standardized and may differ between manufacturers.[1][20] Listed below are the typical bed sizes from the National Bed Federation, which is the trade association for the majority of British and Irish bed manufacturers and their suppliers.[21] Most NBF manufacturers use designs dimensioned in feet and inches with the metric indicators not being exact equivalents.[22] There can legally be a tolerance of up to ±2 cm (0.8 in) between the quoted measurements and the size of the mattress itself.[23]\n\nSize Dimensions Centimeters Inches[20][1] Small single 76 × 191 30 × 75 Single 91 × 191 36 × 75 Small double* 122 × 191 48 × 75 Double 137 × 191 54 × 75 King 152 × 198 60 × 78 Super King 183 × 198 72 × 78\n\n*Also known as a \"three-quarter\" or \"four-foot\" bed.[24]\n\nSome UK retailers may have a \"queen\" size which refers to one of the above standard sizes, but there is inconsistency around which size specifically, with both the small double and super king being prevalent.\n\nAdjustable beds or electric adjustable bed sizes differ from the standard bed size. The length of these beds differ from a standard size due to the nature of the bed needing to bend. So they are 200 cm in length rather than 191 cm. King size and super king size are normally two 75 cm or two 90 cm adjacent beds.[25]\n\nAs well as customary UK sizes, some common European sizes can be found in the UK from imports and IKEA.[20][26] The typical length of an IKEA and other European mattresses is 200 cm (79 in), whereas UK lengths vary depending on the width of the mattress, being usually either 191 or 198 cm (75 or 78 in).[27] In 2015, IKEA started offering beds and mattresses in customary UK sizes alongside their standard European sizes.[28]\n\nTurkey\n\n[edit]\n\nIn Turkey, single size beds are usually 90 cm × 190 cm (35 in × 75 in); long single size 90 cm × 200 cm (35 in × 79 in); large single size 100 cm × 200 cm (39 in × 79 in).\n\nThere is also an intermediate size used for one and a half people[clarification needed] in Turkey: 120 cm × 200 cm (47 in × 79 in).\n\nThe most common sizes for double beds are: small double size 140 cm × 190 cm (55 in × 75 in); young size 140 cm × 200 cm (55 in × 79 in); double size 150 cm × 200 cm (59 in × 79 in); double size 160 cm × 200 cm (63 in × 79 in); double large size 180 cm × 200 cm (71 in × 79 in); double XL size 200 cm × 200 cm (79 in × 79 in).\n\nNorth America\n\n[edit]\n\nThe sizes of mattresses use non-numeric labels such as a \"king\" or \"full\", but are defined in inches. Historically most beds were \"twins\" or \"doubles\" but in the mid-1940s larger mattresses were introduced by manufacturers. These were later standardized as \"queen\" and \"king\", and first made a significant impact on the market in the 1950s and 60s.[29] Standard mattress depth ranges from the \"standard\" size of 9 in (23 cm) to \"high contour\" of up to 13 in (33 cm). Below are the standard ISPA widths and heights in the United States and Canada.[30][31]\n\nWhile the dimensions are specified to the half-inch below, the actual dimension used by manufacturers or various websites may be half an inch larger or smaller.[30]\n\nSize Dimensions Inches Centimeters Twin or Single 38.5 × 74.5 98 × 189 Twin XL 38.5 × 79.5 98 × 202 Full or Double 53.5 × 74.5 136 × 189 Queen 60 × 79.5 152 × 202 King 76 × 79.5 193 × 202 California King 72 × 83.5 183 × 212\n\nLess common sizes include:\n\nSize Dimensions Inches Centimeters Crib 27.5 × 52 70 × 132 Junior 27.5 × 63 70 × 160 Cot or Small Single 30 × 75 76 × 191 Antique Single 36 × 72 91 × 183 Twin XXL 37.5 × 83.5 95 × 212 Antique Double or Three-quarter[32] 48 × 72 122 × 183 Full XL or Double XL 53.5 × 79.5 136 × 202 Super Queen, Olympic Queen, or Expanded Queen 66 × 80 168 × 203 California Queen 60 × 83.5 152 × 212 Super King, Grand King, Athletic King, or Texas King[33] 80 × 98 203 × 249 Wyoming King[33] 84 × 84 213 × 213 Alberta King or Alaskan Queen 96 × 96 244 × 244 Alaskan King[33] 108 × 108 274 × 274\n\nThere are also a number of specialty sizes for specific use cases:\n\nSize Dimensions Notes Inches Centimeters Half Queen or Split Queen 30 × 79.5 76 × 202 For adjustable Queen size beds where each half moves independently.

XL mattresses have the same widths as their non-XL counterparts.[38] The 200 cm (79 in) XL length is recommended for persons over 183 cm (6 ft) tall.[39]\n\nSingle: 92 cm (36 in) wide\n\nThree-quarter: 107 cm (42 in) wide\n\nDouble: 137 cm (54 in) wide\n\nQueen: 152 cm (60 in) wide\n\nKing: 183 cm (72 in) wide.
