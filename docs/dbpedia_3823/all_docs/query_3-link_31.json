        "text": "XAR 400 steel plate: this grade is the most commonly used steel grade with normal abrasion resistant level, it has extraordinary cold formability and weldablity, its abrasion resistant property doesn’t get weekend when the temperature is below 400℃.\n\nXAR 450 steel plate: this grade is a upgraded version of XAR400 with abrasion resistant characteristic improved, the working temperature remains below 400℃.\n\nXAR 500 steel plate: maintains formable and weldable characteristics, with element B added, it has higher level of wear resistance for conveyors, crushers, lorries, etc. It shall be delivered as water quenched.\n\nXAR 550 and XAR 600 steel plate: cold forming is not allowed for the high hardness, with Ni element added, it is delivered as water quenched or soft-annealed steel.\n\nAvailability\n\nThickness: 3 to 100 mm\n\nSize: 2500 x 6000mm\n\nChemical composition (heat analysis, %)\n\nC Si Mn P S Mo Cr B 0.20 0.80 1.50 0.025 0.010 0.50 1.00 0.005\n\nMechanical Properties\n\nDelivery condition: quenched or quenched and tempered\n\nHardness : 360 – 440 HBW\n\nYield strength (MPa) : 1050\n\nTensile strength (MPa) : 1250\n\nElongation (%) : 12\n\nNotch-bar impact energy at – 40 °C : 30\n\non Charpy V-longitudinal test piece (J)\n\nNote:\n\n1 MPa = 1 N/mm2\n\nThe Brinell hardness shall be determined in accordance with ISO 6506. The hardness shall be measured roughly 1 mm below the surface of the plate.\n\nCold forming\n\nThe products made of this steel are suitable for cold bending provided, that consideration is given to the high hardness. The formability of steel decreases with increasing hardness. This has to be kept in mind when forming.\n\nThe forming must take place at a slow and steady rate, the cut edges must be deburred and the plates heated, if necessary, prior to the forming. A final stress-relieving is not necessary for this steel.\n\nMachinability\n\nIn spite of its high wear resistance, the steel exhibits good machinability if sufficiently heavy machine-tools and sharp carbide-tipped tools are used. The feed rate and cutting speed have to be adjusted to the high hardness of the material.\n\nHeat treatment\n\nPlates of the XAR 400 grade receive the required properties as a result of austenitizing and follow-on quenching in special facilities and, where applicable, tempering below Ac1. Direct quenching after hot-rolling is considered equivalent to conventional quenching. The heat treatment depends on the chemical composition and the product thickness. To avoid hardness losses, the steel must not be heated above 250 °C.\n\nThermal cutting\n\nPreferably the flame-cutting process is used. For small product thicknesses, however, the plasma cutting process is used in the interest of minimum distortion.\n\nPreheating is not normally necessary when flame-cutting thicknesses up to around 30 mm. However, if the workpiece temperature is below + 5 °C, or the cut edges are to be cold-formed in the course of further processing, preheating to about 150 °C should be considered in the interest of cold cracking resistance.\n\nWelding\n\nIf due consideration is given to the general rules for welding, this steel is weldable both manually and automatically. To prevent cold cracking in the welded joints only welding consumables giving welds of very low hydrogen content should be used.\n\nPreheating is not generally necessary for welding with austenitic filler metals.\n\nPreheating may be necessary for welding with ferritic filler metals.\n\nThe preheat temperature level for welding depends on the plate thickness and the residual stress state of the structure. The working temperature should not go beyond 250 °C.\n\nThe wear resistance of components fabricated of XAR 400 may be increased with the aid of wear resistant layers deposited by means of welding or metal spraying.\n\nApplication\n\nXAR® wear-resistant steels have proved successful in various applications in which wear and abrasion are major cost factors. Thanks to their high hardness, wear can be minimized and component life increased.\n\nThe wide range of XAR® grades allows designers to choose the optimum steel for the particular application taking loading and production conditions into account. XAR® steels have found a wide range of applications in important areas of engineering.\n\nAutomotive/Trucks\n\nMore environmental protection, more safety and cost efficiency are important issues in the automotive industry.
