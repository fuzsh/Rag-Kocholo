        "text": "In 2014, Broumi et al. (S. Broumi, F. Smarandache, M. Dhar, Rough neutrosophic sets, Italian Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics, 32 (2014), 493-502.) introduced the notion of rough neutrosophic set by combining neutrosophic sets and rough sets, which has been a mathematical tool to deal with problems involving indeterminacy and incompleteness. The real world is full of indeterminacy. Naturally, real world decision making problem involves indeterminacy. Rough neutrosophic set is capable of describing and handling imprecise, indeterminate and inconsistent and incomplete information. This paper is devoted to propose several new similarity measures based on trigonometric hamming similarity operators of rough neutrosophic sets and their applications in decision making. We prove the required properties of the proposed similarity measures. To illustrate the applicability of the proposed similarity measures in decision making, an illustrative problem is solved.\n\nIn this paper, we define a rough cosine similarity measure between two rough neutrosophic sets. The notions of rough neutrosophic sets (RNS) will be used as vector representations in 3D-vector space. The rating of all elements in RNS is expressed with the upper and lower approximation operator and the pair of neutrosophic sets which are characterized by truth-membership degree, indeterminacy-membership degree, and falsity-membership degree. A numerical example of the medical diagnosis is provided to show the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method.\n\nRough set theory and neutrosophic set theory are mathematical models to deal with incomplete and vague information. These two theories can be combined into a framework for modeling and processing incomplete information in information systems. Thus, the neutrosophic rough set hybrid model gives more precision, flexibility and compatibility to the system as compared to the classic and fuzzy models. In this research study, we develop neutrosophic rough digraphs based on the neutrosophic rough hybrid model. Moreover, we discuss regular neutrosophic rough digraphs, and we solve decision-making problems by using our proposed hybrid model. Finally, we give a comparison analysis of two hybrid models, namely, neutrosophic rough digraphs and rough neutrosophic digraphs.\n\nA rough neutrosophic set theory is a generalization of uncertainty set theory with a combination of upper and lower approximation and a pair of neutrosophic sets which are characterized by truth membership degree (T), indeterminacy membership degree (I), and falsity membership degree (F). This set theory is suitable for representing each criterionâ€™s relation in medical diagnoses, such as the relation of disease and symptom. This paper aims to propose a model of medical diagnosis via a distance-based similarity measure of a rough neutrosophic set. The first phase for the development model involves the roughness measure between information collected and a lower and upper approximation of rough neutrosophic set theory. Then, it is simultaneously used with extended Hausdorff distance measure to get the proper medical diagnosis. The result shows that each patient has a chest problem that contradicts the prior diagnosis. The finding shows that the roughness approximation is important to g...\n\nEarlier fuzzy set, vague set, intuitionistic fuzzy set, L-fuzzy set etc are used as a mathematical tools for solving problems based on uncertainties or ambiguous in nature. But due to more complexity involves in problems exist in nature, traditional tools are unable to handle those in a systematic manner. So we need a tool which is more flexible to handle those problems. Which leads to the invention of soft set which was introduced by Molodtsov in 1999. Soft set (SS) theory is a mathematical tool deals with parametric data which are imprecise in nature. Ithis a generalization of fuzzy set theory. On the other hand Rough set (RS) theory and Neutrosophic set (NS) theory both rising as a powerful tool to handle these uncertain, incomplete, inconsistent and imprecise information in an effective manner. Actually Neutrosophic set is a generalization of intuitionistic fuzzy set. Sometimes it is not possible to handle all sorts of uncertain problems with a single mathematical tool. Fusion of two or more mathematical tools give rise to a new mathematical concept which gives an idea how to solve such type of problems in a more sophisticated ways. Which leads to the introduction of fuzzy soft set, rough soft set, intuitionistic fuzzy soft set, soft rough set etc. Neutrosophic soft set (NSS) was established by combining the concept of Soft set and Neutrosophic set. In this paper, using the concept of Rough set and Neutrosophic soft set a new concept known as Rough neutrosophic soft set (RNSS) is developed. Some properties and operations on them are introduced.\n\nSimilarity measure plays an important role in medical diagnosis. In this paper, a new rough cotangent similarity measure between two rough neutrosophic sets is proposed. The notion of rough neutrosophic set is used as vector representations in 3D-vector space. The rating of all elements in rough neutrosophic set is expressed with the upper and lower approximation operator and the pair of neutrosophic sets which are characterized by truth-membership degree, indeterminacy-membership degree, and falsity-membership degree. A numerical example of the medical diagnosis is provided to show the effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed method."
