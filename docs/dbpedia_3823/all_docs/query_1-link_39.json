        "text": "How does one write a date on the Web? There are so many formats available, most of them incompatible with others, that it can be a usability nightmare to choose a date representation when writing for an international, cross-cultural audience, as is the case on the web. Fortunately, there is one solution in the ISO-developed international date format.\n\nThe date interpretation quagmire\n\nThe worst potential usability problems come when the date is written only with numbers as in the following example, because the date's interpretation will be different from one country to another.\n\nImagine the following date: 02/04/03\n\nWhich does it mean?\n\n2nd of April 2003 (European style)\n\n4th of February 2003 (USA style)\n\n3rd of April 2002\n\nYour answer will depend, mostly, on which country you live in.\n\nIn most cases, writing the date in full letters would be better than the example above. Apr. 3rd, 2002, for example will be easy to understand for any English-speaking audience.\n\nBut this system does not cross borders much better than its numerical counterparts: does the french 12 Août 2042 actually mean something for a Japanese person? Or when you notice a 昭和44年03月16日 in Japanese which is 16 March 1969 in English.\n\nThe ISO date format\n\nThe international format defined by ISO (ISO 8601) tries to address all these problems by defining a numerical date system as follows: YYYY-MM-DD where\n\nYYYY is the year [all the digits, i.e. 2012]\n\nMM is the month [01 (January) to 12 (December)]\n\nDD is the day [01 to 31]\n\nFor example, \"3rd of April 2002\", in this international format is written: 2002-04-03.\n\nNote that this format can also be used to represent precise date and time, with timezone information\n\nUsing numerical dates does have also some pitfalls with regard to readability and usability, as explained in the Date formats FAQ. Albeit not perfect, ISO date format is, however, the best choice for a date representation that is universally (and accurately) understandable.\n\nFurther Reading\n\nDate and Time Formats\n\nISO 8601 Date and time format\n\nEverything on Calendar systems\n\nW3C Q&A : Date formats\n\nAbout the \"QA Tips\"\n\nThe W3C QA Tips are short documents explaining useful bits of knowledge for Web developers or designers, hosted and produced by the Quality Assurance Interest Group at W3C.\n\nWhile the tips are carefully reviewed by the participants of the group, they should not be seen as anything else than informative bits of wisdom, and especially, they are not normative W3C technical specifications."
