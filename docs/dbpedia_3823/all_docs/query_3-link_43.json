Telkom’s shares are traded on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX) where it is listed as “TLKM” and on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which lists it as “TLK”. As it transforms to become a digital telecommunication company, TelkomGroup implements a customer-oriented business and company operational strategy. The transformation aims to trim down TelkomGroup’s organization to be leaner and more agile in adapting the fast-changing nature of telecommunications industry. The new organization is expected to be able to improve efficiency and be more effective in producing a quality customer experience. TelkomGroup’s activities grow and change in accordance to the development of new technology, information and digitalization, but still within the corridor of telecommunications and information technology. This is evident in the newly developed business lines, which complements the company’s existing legacy business.\n\nWebsite\n\nhttp://www.telkom.co.id\n\nLink eksternal untuk Telkom Indonesia\n\nIndustri\n\nTelekomunikasi\n\nUkuran perusahaan\n\n10.001+ karyawan\n\nKantor Pusat\n\nJakarta Selatan, DKI Jakarta\n\nJenis\n\nPerusahaan Publik\n\nTahun Pendirian\n\n1965\n\nSpesialisasi\n\nTelecommunication, Media, Information, Edutainment"
