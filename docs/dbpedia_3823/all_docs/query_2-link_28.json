We also provide an avenue for our represented countries and cultures to share and engage with the greater campus community.\n\nWe continually advocate on behalf of our students and scholars regarding immigration, academic, and personal matters to ensure that their voices are heard within the Lehigh community and beyond.\n\nWe aim to facilitate ways for our international students and scholars to engage beyond the Lehigh campus.\n\nWe empower Lehigh's international community to take ownership of their immigration status, and academic and professional goals."
