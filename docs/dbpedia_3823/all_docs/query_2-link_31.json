        "text": "The BIS effective exchange rates data set covers long time series on nominal and real effective exchange rates. They can serve as a measure of international competitiveness, components of financial conditions indices or as a gauge of the transmission of external shocks.\n\nThe broad effective exchange rate indices cover 64 economies. Narrow indices include 26 and 27 economies for the nominal and real indices, respectively. Nominal effective exchange rates (NEER) are calculated as geometric trade-weighted averages of bilateral exchange rates. Real effective exchange rates (REER) are derived by adjusting the NEER by relative consumer prices.\n\nSpecifically, changes in the REER take into account both nominal exchange rate developments and the inflation differential against a basket of trading partners. An increase in NEER indicates an appreciation in nominal terms, whereas an increase in REER corresponds to an appreciation in real terms."
