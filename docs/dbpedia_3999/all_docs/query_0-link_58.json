        "text": "HISTORY OF KANSAS.\n\nDONIPHAN COUNTY.\n\nNATURAL FEATURES.\n\nDONIPHAN County, situated in the extreme northeast of Kansas, makes but a small showing on the general map, but a great one in the history of the State. It is bounded on the south by the Missouri River, the State of Missouri and Atchison County, Kansas; west by Brown County; north by the State line and the Missouri, and east by the Missouri River and the State of Missouri.\n\nThe county has, according to the Government survey, twenty-five per cent of bottom and seventy-five per cent of upland. Forest covers sixteen per cent of the county and rolling prairie and bluffs the other eighty-four per cent.\n\nTimber is found quite plentifully along the Missouri River, and averages one mile in width. Along the minor streams it runs from one-quarter to one-half of a mile. The principal varieties of forest trees are black walnut, hickory, oak and cottonwood.\n\nThe land is watered by Wolf River, which passes through the towns of Leona and Severance, then turns northeast and finally north, passing through Fanning, and at last emptying into the Missouri, Clear and Mission creeks, running north through the west part of the county to the Missouri, and Independence, Rock and Brush creeks running south to the Missouri. There are also many small streams which are either nameless or have merely local names not in universal use.\n\nOf the 242,560 acres of land in the county, about sixty per cent is under cultivation. Doniphan County is not rich in minerals, no coal having been discovered, and, although building stone is believed to exist, no quarries have yet been developed.\n\nPOPULATION. 1870. 1880.Burr Oak Township 1,015 1,014Center Township, including Troy City 2,248 2,177Iowa Township, including Highland City and White Cloud City 3,531 3,607Marion Township 658 619(a) Union Township 816Washington Township, including Elwood City and Wathena City 2,513 1,865Wayne Township, including Doniphan City 2,070 1,961(b) Wolf River Township, including Severance City 1,934 2,198 13,969 14,257Troy City 639 694Highland City 282 441White Cloud City 843 825Elwood City 323Wathena City 710Doniphan City 528 518Severance City 375 (a) Organized in 1878, from part of Wolf River. (b) Organized in 1878, from part of Union.\n\nIOWA AND SAC MISSION.\n\nThe earliest settlement within the present boundaries of Doniphan was the Iowa and Sac Mission, which was opened under the auspices of the American Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church, the work being in charge of Rev. S. M. Irvin, who came to Kansas in 1837, and was the first white man to take up permanent residence in the then unorganized county. His wife accompanied him. Six months after the arrival of Mr. Irvin, Rev. Wm. Hamilton came to the Mission. The first mission buildings were of logs, but before many years the grand old Mission building, part of which is still standing, was erected. It was situated about one mile east of the present town of Highland. This was a monster structure for the times. Its dimensions were 170x37 feet, and it had three stories. The basement was of fine cut stone, quarried near the river, and the brick for the superstructure was made on the spot by men from St. Joseph, Mo. The lumber came from Pittsburgh, Pa., and made an exact steamer load. Starting at Pittsburgh it came down the Ohio and Mississippi to St. Louis, and thence up the Missouri to the river bank opposite the Mission, where it was discharged. Notwithstanding the great size of the building, it was put up quite cheaply, the brick costing but three dollars per thousand and the men's wages averaging ten dollars per month. After serving its purpose for more than a quarter of a century, this historic building was sold in April, 1868, to J. P. Johnson, of Highland. A quarter of it was at once taken down with the intention of using the material in the construction of the University building. This project was not, however, carried out, and the cut stone still lies near the house of J. P. Johnson, in Highland, the other material being scattered. The remainder of the building, which brought $7,500 at auction in New York, is still standing to the north of the road to Highland Station, on the Atchison & Nebraska Railway, and about midway between the two points.\n\nAt the old Mission, from 1842 onward, a number of grammars and text books in the Indian language were set up and printed, the work, both literary and typographical, being done by Rev. S. M. Irvin and William Hamilton. The title of one of these books, still in the possession of Rev. S. M. Irvin, runs as follows\n\n\"AN IOWA GRAMMAR, illustrating the principles of the language used by the Ioway, Otoe and Missouri. Prepared and printed by Rev. Wm. Hamilton and Rev. S. M. Irvin under the direction of the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions Ioway and Sac Mission Press 1848.\"\n\nThis book is interleaved with, white pages for the convenience of annotation. It is a 16 mo of 152 pages. The old press upon which it was printed is still in the possession of Rev. S. M. Irvin, at Highland.\n\nAfter the opening of the Territory and the sale of the Iowa trust lands, the Indian reservation was made to embrace a narrow strip on the north of the county, where the remnant of the once powerful tribe is now located. They have there a small village called Nohart, after a famous warrior of the tribe in the days of Indian supremacy.\n\nSQUATTERS' ASSOCIATION.\n\nThe following account of the first meeting of this noted association is furnished by Benjamin Harding, an old resident and a member of the association.\n\n\"Immediately after the treaty with the Kickapoos, in 1854, a meeting of the squatters was called, and held at J. R. Whitehead's, June 24, and organized a Squatters' Sovereign Association. A. M. Mitchell, of St. Joe, was chairman. J. R. Whitehead, secretary. An executive committee was appointed, consisting of John H. Whitehead, H. Smallwood, J. B. O'Toole, J. W. Smith, Sr., Sam. Montgomery, B. Harding, J. W. Smith, Jr., J. J. Keaton, T. W. Waterson, C. B. Whitehead, Anderson Cox and Joseph Siciliff.\n\n\"A committee on resolutions, consisting of W. Broadus Thompson, C. B. Whitehead, B. Wharton, J. R. Custine, reported the following, which was adopted as the basis of the organization:\n\n\"Whereas, We, citizens of Kansas Territory, intending to fix our homes on its fertile soil, have this day met at Whitehead for the purpose of taking measures to secure safety, certainty and fairness in the location and preservation of our claims\n\n\"Therefore be it Resolved: 1. That we are in favor of bona fide Squatter Sovereignty and acknowledge the right of any citizen of the United States to make a claim in Kansas Territory, with the ultimate new of occupying it.\n\n\"2. That such claims, when made, should bee held inviolate so long as a bona fide intention of occupying it is apparent and for the purpose of protecting and defending such claims, we agree to act in concert if necessary, to expel intruders.\n\n\"3. That any person of lawful age, or who may be the head of a family, who shall mark out his claim of 160 acres, so that it may be apparent how the claim lies, shall be deemed to have made a proper claim.\n\n\"4. That any person marking out his claim shall be deemed to have forfeited it unless be commences his cabin or pitches his tent within thirty days thereafter, unless the same shall be on such land as prohibited by military or Indian reservations.\n\n\"5. That all persons now holding claims shall have thirty days from this day in which to make the improvements contemplated by the foregoing resolutions.\n\n\"6. That no person shall be protected by the Squatter Association who holds in his own right more than one claim.\n\n\"7. That any person building his cabin, or tent, within less than a half-mile of another shall be deemed an intruder.\n\n\"8. That a citizen of the Territory be appointed register of claims. who shall keep book in which he shall note the name and description of all squatters and their claims, for which he shall be allowed the sum of fifty cents for each claim, to be paid by the claimant.\n\n\"9 That a bona fide purchase of a claim located and registered be recognized as entitled to the same under the laws of this association, provided his intention be to become a citizen of the Territory.\n\n\"10. That we will afford protection to no Abolitionist as a settler of Kansas Territory.\n\n\"11. That we recognize the institution of slavery as already existing in the Territory and recommend to slave-holders to introduce their property as soon as practicable.\n\n\"12. That a vigilance committee be appointed by the chair., consisting of thirteen members of this association, whose duty it shall he to inquire into all disputes in relation to claims, and to the execution of their judgment in regard to rightful claimants, they shall have power to call together the entire Squatter Association.\n\n\"13. That all persons who wish to become members of the Squatter Association shall subscribe to the foregoing preamble and resolutions\"\n\nThe first record upon the books of the County Commissioners of Doniphan County records the meeting \"of the Squatter Association of Kansas Territory, held at Whitehead on the 22nd of July, 1854, in accordance with a resolution passed by an adjourned meeting of the 24th of June.\" The proceedings of their meeting are spread upon the records as follows:\n\nThomas W. Waterson was called to the chair, and James R. Whitehead appointed secretary of the meeting.\n\nOn motion of A. Larzelere, the proceedings of the previous meeting were read and unanimously adopted.\n\nOn motion of Major D. Vanderslice, the fourth resolution of the previous meeting was amended so as to read as follows:\n\nResolved, That any person marking out his claim shall be deemed to have forfeited unless he commences his cabin or pitches his tent within thirty days thereafter, unless the same shall be on such lands as prohibit it by military or Indian reservations. Provided that any Indian agent, officer or employe of the United States, who shall have marked out his claim and has been deterred from commencing his cabin, or otherwise improving his claim, on the ground that it was a violation of the law, but have in all respects complied with the third resolution, then such claims shall be deemed good.\n\nOn motion of John H. Whitehead, it was resolved that all persons having marked claims in Kansas Territory, within the following boundary to wit: beginning at the mouth of Cadew Creek and running due west to the western boundary of the Kickapoo lands, thence north along said boundary to the Iowa and Sac lands, thence north along the western boundary of said lands to the Nehama (sic), thence down the Nehama and Missouri Rivers to the place of beginning, shall be constituted members of, within the limits and under the jurisdiction of this Squatter Association.\n\nOn motion of James M. Tegarden, it was resolved that there be but one register of claims within the limits of this Squatter Association.\n\nOn motion of Samuel Penn Blair, James R. Whitehead was appointed said register.\n\nIt was further resolved that all claims registered previous to this meeting by a regular appointed register be considered valid, but such as are registered after this date by any other than the register appointed by the meeting, be considered invalid.\n\nOn motion, it was resolved that all claims made and properly registered since the first day of January, 1853, be considered valid.\n\nThe meeting then adjourned to August 19.\n\nFollowing this record comes the filing of claims by the squatter settlers. Many of these bear date July 1st, and give the time of taking possession of the land at various dates, the earliest being that of James R. Whitehead, who \"claims the above described parcel of land by right of actual settlement and peaceable possession of the same from the first day of November, 1851.\" This claim is also stated to be \"composed of two fractional quarter sections supposed to contain 160 acres,\" and is located by giving the names of adjoining claimants, and also by stating that it is opposite the southwest quarter of Section 34, Township 58, Range 36, in Missouri.\n\nEntry number eighteen, bears date of July 4, and states the time of residence of the claimant, Andrew J. Branson, as beginning March 28, 1854. Across the face of this entry appear the significant words, \"The above claim was awarded to Mewer on the 15th day of July by the Vigilance Committee, J. R. Whitehead, recorder.\"\n\nOn August 19th, 1854, the Squatter Association met at Whitehead, and the following business was transacted: James B. O'Toole was appointed chairman, and James R. Whitehead. secretary. It was resolved,\n\n\"That from and after this date all disputes in relation to claims, shall be referred to a committee of three to be appointed by the Vigilance Committee, who shall be authorized to settle all disputes so referred. Provided, however, that any persons feeling themselves aggrieved, have the right of appeal to the Committee of Vigilance previously appointed, which shall hold its meetings on the first Monday of each month, at Whitehead.\"\n\nThen follow resolutions fixing the pay of the members of the Vigilance Committee at fifty cents each for each service, and of the Secretary at twenty-five cents for each notice, and also requiring each contestant to deposit five dollars to secure costs of investigation. It was also decided that each person holding an unrecorded claim, be required to record the same within thirty days, \"and if there is no house upon the same, to erect one, or a flag staff, or put four posts in the ground and lay a foundation of four logs thereon, or plough at least one acre of ground somewhere on his claim.\"\n\nOn October 15, 1854, the Squatters' Association met and proceeded to the consideration of the first case of forcible ejection of a claim holder who had \"jumped\" the land of another. A committee was appointed to draw up appropriate resolutions which were at once reported, and were as follows:\n\nWhereas it appears from the records of this association, that George Jameson on the --- day of --- 1854, took possession of a claim owned by W. K. Richardson, which was in Kansas Territory, within the jurisdiction of this association, and that on the --- day of --- 1854, said Jameson at the instance of said Richardson was duly notified to appear before the Vigilance Committee of this association for the purpose of contesting the validity of his claim if he had any, and whereas he failed to appear before said committee, and judgment was in consequence thereof rendered against him by default, and the Marshal of this association was required to notify said Jameson of said judgment, and to require him to leave said claim before the 5th inst., and whereas he refuses to leave said claim and is still thereon in defiance of the judgment of the Vigilance Committee and the notice to leave,\n\nTherefore, resolved by this association that the members of this association this day present being determined to enforce their rules and judgments, will forthwith proceed to this claim in controversy, and require said Jameson leave the same and surrender the possession to said Richardson, and if upon said request he refuses to leave said claim, we will remove him therefrom, peacefully if we can and forcibly if we must, and put said Richardson in possession of said claim.\n\nThe committee further state that the records of this association show that Hamilton J. Johnson on the --- day of --- 1854, recovered a judgment before the Vigilance Committee of --- against --- McAshan for a claim of 160 acres in Kansas Territory, lying within the jurisdiction of this association, and whereas it appears from satisfactory evidence before the committee, that after the rendition of the judgment said McAshan abandoned said claim, and has put said Jameson in possession of the same as his agent, or otherwise, and that said Jameson is now residing on the same and refuses to deliver the same to said Johnson, according to the judgment of the Vigilance Committee. We therefore recommend the same proceedings to be adopted against said Jameson as is provided in the foregoing resolutions for the purpose of putting W. K. Richardson in possession of his claim.\n\nAt the December meeting of the Vigilance, but little of moment occurred. The only resolution offered being one calling for total disregard of complaints from persons not residents of the Territory, unless they should make oath of their intentions to become bona fide settlers. With this entry closes the record of the Squatters' Association, and the next proceedings were those of the Court of County Commissioners called on September 17, 1855, at the town of Whitehead.\n\nKANSAS TROUBLES OF '55.\n\nIn an old volume published in Washington in 1856, is a report of the troubles of the \"border ruffian\" times, with the detailed accounts of various residents of Doniphan County, of the withdrawal of the Free-state ticket, and the workings of the party who came from Missouri to elect a ticket for Kansans of this county. A. A. Jamison, being sworn, was examined by Gov. Reeder and gave the following testimony:\n\n\"I was at the election of March 30, 1855, at the Burr Oak precinct. On the 29th day of the month, in the afternoon, towards evening, some ten or dozen wagons came over the ferry from St. Joseph's to the place and camped upon the ground west of the place. They brought provisions with them. There was a firing of firearms during the evening until late in the night. I saw them passing as I was at the road. The next morning the firing began again. I went up to the place of voting early in the morning, and they soon began to come in from St. Joseph and continued coming; I did not count them but as near as I can make an estimate of the numbers who were not citizens of the precinct, I should judge there were something like two hundred. They were well armed with rifles, pistols, bowie knives, and even 'war clubs' as they termed them. About fifteen minutes before the polls were opened, the candidates of the Free-state party proclaimed that the whole party would be withdrawn and the Pro-slavery party could have the field to themselves. Gen. Stringfellow, of Weston, was there - I was not acquainted with him but he was pointed out to me by those who said they knew him - stepped up to Major Fee, who was a Free-state candidate, and asked him to get up on the fence and proclaim it aloud so that the party might hear him. He did so, and there seemed to be great rejoicing, hats flying, hallooing, etc. There were two opposing candidates of the Pro-slavery party for the council, Maj. William P. Richardson and Capt. John H. Whitehead. Capt. Whitehead mounted a stump and made a speech * * * (sic) and requested the Missourians to stand back and let the actual residents of the district settle the question between him and Major Richardson, as the field was then clear. The voting commenced and was continued from that time till sundown. There was a party selected, towards evening, of good fighting men to stand and protect the polls until they were closed, and they saw all was right. Their reason for forming such a party, as they said themselves, was that they were afraid the Free-state men would come in and vote towards evening. No reply was made to the proposal that the Missourians on the grounds should stand back and not interfere with the voting of actual residents, and Major Richardson in his testimony swears that he did not see a single Missourian cast a ballot. On the other side, many of the residents of the county swear positively that the men from the Missouri side of the river were the principal voters, and Hon. Willard P. Hall, now and then a resident of St. Joseph, acknowledges seeing several Missourians vote. After the withdrawal of the Free-state party there could be no struggle except between the opposing factions of the Pro-slavery men, and in that Missouri was not so strongly interested.\"\n\nDEFUNCT TOWNS.\n\nIn the early days of the county a craze for new towns took possession of the settlers. Almost everyone had his pet town project as, a little later, many had their railroad hobbies. Among the first of these was Charlestown, which was taken by a stock company consisting of Michael Bird, Isaac S. Jones, Miles W. Brown, A. G. Clarke, Charles F. Holly, E. W. Wood, and Charles B. Hamilton. Charlestown was located on the northeast quarter of Section 22, Township 2, Range 21. In their petition the owners of the new town \"pray the court to make the proper entry at the nearest land office.\" This town reached some little prosperity and had twelve or fifteen houses - a respectable size for the times - but was finally vacated and is now a farm.\n\nIn September, 1857, a petition was filed by T. H. McCulloch, H. Miles Moore, James Skinner, Thomas Bell, Daniel Bauman, Henry Wilson, Robert Hayes, James Craft, David Cowger, J. W. Wilson, and Philip Rush, for the location of a town to be known as Columbus City. This town had already been located, having been laid out on May 25, 1857, on the southeast quarter of Section 20, and the southwest quarter of Section 21, in Township 2, Range 22. This town had some growth, and was for a number of years assessed as a town site, but has been long since vacated.\n\nEvansville was located on the north half of Section 25, Township 3, and Range 21. The projector of this town was Col. D. M. Johnston, who filed his claim on June 1, 1857, in behalf of the proprietors, the Evansville Town Company. The proper filings were made by Hon. Joel P. Blair in the land office in Doniphan. With this entry the town's official record ends, and it is extremely doubtful if it ever came into being.\n\nLafayette was laid out on December 23, 1856, by J. B. McAllister, C. F. Bowron and Thomas B. Glenn. It comprised the land on two fractional parts of sections. These were the east half of Section 14, Township 2, Range 20, and southwest quarter of Section 13, of the same Township. Like so many projected towns, Lafayette never achieved actual existence of any notable amount.\n\nPOLITICAL ORGANIZATION.\n\nIn the summer of 1855, the first Territorial Legislature divided Kansas into counties establishing the boundaries of Doniphan substantially as they exist at present. Governor Reeder's proclamation issued November 8, 1854 divided the territory into sixteen election districts. What is now Doniphan County was designated the \"Fourteenth Council District,\" with three voting precincts - Doniphan, Wolf Creek, and Burr Oak. James R. Whitehead, constable of this district, was commissioned November 25, 1854 as the first officer of Doniphan County. After the county was created by territorial enactment in the summer of 1855 the Court of Commissioners duly met September 18, 1855, and elected Mr. Whitehead County Clerk, ex officio Clerk of the Probate Court and Recorder of Deeds. Joel P. Blair, Alex. Dunning and E. V. B. Rogers were the commissioners present. Places for holding the election in October for delegate to Congress were designated, and the judges appointed. It was also ordered that an election for Brown County be held at the house of W. C. Foster, on the south fork of the Nemaha.\n\nThe commissioners appointed by the Territorial Legislature to locate the seat of justice of Doniphan County met at Whitehead on the 11th and 12th of October, and driving a stake in the southwest quarter of Section 17, Washington Township, inscribed on one side thereof \"The County Seat of Doniphan County is located on this quarter section,\" and on the other they signed their names - A. Payne and Thos. J. B. Cramer, on October 12. Pursuant to order James F. Foreman had, by November, laid off eighty acres of the county seat (named the town of Troy) into lots, and surveyed the public square of three hundred feet \"upon the summit of the eminence near where the commissioners erected a stake,\" A public sale of lots was therefore ordered for January 1, 1856, one-third cash.\n\nOn December 17, 1855, the County Commissioners authorized the Clerk to advertise for bids for constructing a one story court-house, 36x20 ft., with an \"L\" 18 ft. square, to be completed by the third Monday in April, and a jail 20 ft. square, two stories, to be finished by the third Monday in June, 1856. The Time for opening bids was postponed, but the contract for building the court-house was awarded to B. O'Driscoll in April for $1,760. The building was completed in the winter of 1856-57.\n\nIn June 1860, bids for the construction of a new court-house were invited, and those of J. J. Johnson and Edwin Straughn, of St., Joseph, Mo., were accepted. Work was at once begun, and the edifice which stood on the northern portion of the \"square\" was rapidly pushed to completion. In this building all county business was transacted until its destruction by fire in 1867. It also was used as a jail.\n\nThe present court-house was built immediately upon the loss of its predecessor and is one of the largest of its class. It stands in the center of the square. On the lower floor are the offices of the County Clerk, County Treasurer, Probate Judge and Recorder of Deeds. On the second story are the County Court room, and the offices of the Clerk of the District Court and Prosecuting Attorney. A few years since, the lack of suitable vaults was so severely felt that an addition was built upon the west of the main building for this purpose. This addition was carried up two stories and the upper part furnished the library room of the Young Ladies Library Association.\n\nEARLY COMMISSIONERS' PROCEEDINGS.\n\nOn February 18, 1856. the County Commissioners issued a license to Jesse & Blackiston to run a ferry across the Missouri at St. Joseph, and fixed the rates of toll to be charged. This apparently arbitrary measure was enforced in the cases of all who undertook similar business at the time, and was intended to prevent over charges and the consequent diversion of travel to other routes.\n\nOn May 19 of this year. the commissioners licensed Timothy Bancroft, of Wathena, to run a grocery for twelve months from date, and assessed him thirty dollars for this privilege; other grocers were licensed, shortly after, at the rate of twenty dollars per year.\n\nOn May 5 the boundaries of the first four school districts, all in Township 3, Range 22 were thus defined:\n\nNo. 1. - From the northwest corner of the township, east three miles and one-half; south three miles and one-half, thence west to the west line of the township.\n\nNo. 2. - From the southwest corner of the township east four miles, thence south two and one-half miles to the Missouri River, thence along the river to the center of the town of Whitehead, thence to the southeast corner of the town, west to the township line and south to the point of beginning.\n\nNo. 3. - From the northwest corner of district one east to the Missouri, south along the river to the northeast corner of the town of Whitehead, thence south to the initial point.\n\nNo. 4. - From the northeast corner of district two, south to the south east corner of the same, east to the township line, north to the Missouri and thence to the place of starting.\n\nAt the same time the County Surveyor was ordered to survey the west line of Doniphan and the south and west line of Brown County.\n\nAt the June, 1859, term of the County Commissioners, the following is reported: \"Geo. S. Hough and D. W. Wilder, being duly sworn, depose and say the on this 14th day of June, A. D. 1859, they delivered to A. Larzelere, chairman of County Board, the following counterfeit bills: One hundred and seventy-nine $10 bills on the Bank of Commerce, Cleveland, Ohio; six $10 bills on the Northwestern Bank, Virginia; twelve $5 bills on the Central Bank. Connecticut; and deponents further say, that with the said A. Larzelere, they threw into the Missouri River the following bogus coin: Two hundred and ninety-five half dollars, three hundred and thirty-five dollars, and one hundred and fourteen two and one-half dollar pieces, and that they left with Geo. S. Hough a portion of one galvanic battery.\"\n\nThese bills were presented to the Board of Supervisors of Doniphan County, and being found to agree with the report, were destroyed by the sheriff in the presence of the board.\n\nOn the books of the Register of Deeds of the county, is spread a curious deed, bearing the date of March 1,1859, which serves to point an explanation of some phases of the county history. It reads as follows: \"Know all men by these presents that the Doniphan Town Company, for and in consideration of inducing Robert Graham, late member of the legislature, to leave the Town of Doniphan to them in hand, paid, by S. C. Pomeroy, of Atchison, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, have remised, released and quit claimed, and by these presents do remise, release and quit claim unto the said S. C. Pomeroy, and to his heirs and assigns forever, all our right, title, estate, interest, claim and demand in possession, or in expectancy of, in and to the following described land: * * * lots one and two in block seventy-four. Signed by J. W. Shepard, agent D. T. E. Co.\" This Graham was a strong Pro-slavery man, and in his course in the legislature had made himself so obnoxious to the people of his town as to secure their hearty connection that the place was too small to hold both. Many of the towns started at an early day were simply due to political opinion. There were Free-state and Pro-slavery towns in which a man of the opposite stripe could find himself in a regular Nessus shirt.\n\nCOUNTY OFFICERS.\n\nThe first County or Probate Judge of this county, was Joel P. Blair, appointed August 27, 1855, by Governor Shannon. He was followed by Augustus J. Allison, elected in 1857; Lyman Nash, 1858; A. A. Daugherty, 1859; J. B. Maynard, 1861; J. C. Gordon, 1864; R. Wilkinson, 1872, and J. F. Wilson, in 188O. The latter is still in office.\n\nThe first County Clerk was James L. Whitehead, appointed in 1855, by Governor Shannon. His successors were elected as follows: Egbert M. Lee, 1857; H. Boder, Jr., 1859; F. J. Jenkins, 1861; Charles Rappelye, 1863; J. T. Kirwan, 1867; Charles Rappelye, 1871; D. W. Morse, 1877. Mr. Morse was re-elected in 1879 and 1881, and is still in office.\n\nRobert J. Porter was elected County Treasurer in 1857; E. S. Dans, 1859; F. M. Tracy, 1863; Charles Rappelye, 1867; O. Craig, 1869; Robert Tracy, 1871; R. Flickinger, 1875, S. N. Johnson, 1879 and 1881.\n\nThe first Register of Deeds was E. M. Lee, elected in 1859. He was followed by B. Harding, elected in 1861; D. McIntosh, 1865; A. Hargan, 1873; F. H. Drenning, 1875; J. P. Hampson, 1877; E F. Dixon, 1879 and 1881.\n\nCary B. Whitehead was made Sheriff on August 27, 1855. and was succeeded by the following: S. V. Jameson, 1857; Joseph Randolph, 1859 (to fill vacancy); R. J. Porter 1859; George S. Hough, 1860; W. D. Beeler, 1861; E. G. Crabb, 1863; B. S. Campbell, 1867; S. Maquilken, 1871; T. J. Vanderslice, 1873; Charles Burkhalter 1875; N. C. Bailey 1881.\n\nThe first record of the Clerk of the District Court mentions James R. Whitehead as Deputy. This was in 1855. H. Boder, Jr., was elected in 1861; J. M. Stirgis, in 1864; Frank Brown, in 1866, and F. J. Close in 1878. The latter is still in office.\n\nTHE FAIR ASSOCIATION.\n\nThe Doniphan County Agricultural, Horticultural and Mechanical Association was chartered under the State law on January 5, 1867. The capital stock was placed at $5,000, and shares at $5 each, but were very shortly placed at $10. A Board of Directors was elected, and numbered fifteen. The first fair was held In August, 1868. The grounds of the association embrace twenty-one and sixty-five one-hundredths acres, located one and one-quarter miles south of Troy, and were purchased of J. N. Zimmerman for $1,640. Upon them the association has erected a floral hall, of circular shape, 100 feet in diameter. Ample stalls for horses have been built, and a half mile track laid out. The improvements of all sorts, exclusive of the track, are valued at $3,000. On three sides the ground is enclosed by a well kept hedge, and on the fourth is a high board fence. Shade trees have been planted liberally, and are already of sufficient size to be useful, From the grounds can be had a fine new of the Missouri bluffs and St. Joseph, while inland in full new lies a beautiful vista of fertile fields, stretching away to the north, south and west for a number of miles. The first President of the association was B. O'Driscoll. The first Secretary, William H. Nesbit. Mr. Nesbit held the office but a short time, and was followed by J. N. Zimmerman, who in turn was succeeded by J. A. Oder. In 1873, A. W. Beale, now of the chief office, assumed the position, and held it until 1877, when the present Secretary, T. W. Heatley, was elected. The present directors of the society are: R. Flickinger, J. N. Zimmerman, Cyrus Leland, Jr., M. R. Townsend, C. O. Turkelson, J. P. Johnson, William Chapple, T. W. Heatley, N. B. Wood, Lucas Fetter, John F. Wilson, C. Maynard, R. P. Shulsky, J. Hoverson, Edward Ege, Thomas Henshell and W. H. Deckard. For a number of years, Cyrus Leland, Jr., has acted as general superintendent, but at the last election he was made president, and John F. Wilson, the present Probate Judge, took his place. Financially, the association has been both well managed and fortunate. None of the annual fairs have failed to show a balance of profit and besides the property at the fair ground, valued at $5,000, there is a surplus of between $300 and $400. The yearly premium foots up fully $700 and in no case has it been scaled or paid pro rata. The last fair took place in September, 1881. That of 1882 surpassed its predecessors, and the association may well feel proud of its enviable success. While sustaining itself it has done work for the farmers of the county that it would be hard to fully estimate.\n\nSTATE REPRESENTATION.\n\nThe first State Legislature convened on March 26, 1861 and contained as representatives of Doniphan County, T. A. Osborn, of Elwood, and H. N. Seaver, in the Senate, and F. W. Emery, T. P. Herrick, W. C. Kimber and A. Low, in the House. Since that time those elected to the Senate are as follows: 1861 - T. A.

Dans.\n\nDONIPHAN.\n\nDoniphan takes its name from A. W. Doniphan, a Colonel in the Mexican War, who has the credit of fighting the last battle of the war, when, unknown to him, peace had already been made.\n\nDoniphan stands where the corkscrew Missouri makes a sharp turn to the west, and is hurled back upon itself by a huge wooded bluff. To north and south rise heavily timbered bluffs, dipping to form the level bottom on which the town lies nestled from the prevailing storm-currents of winter. Behind it are fertile fields, magnificent vineyards and numerous farms in a high state of cultivation. Before it runs the Missouri River which seemed to the builders of the town the perpetual natural highway of all traffic, and to secure for the town an unfailing prosperity. To-day, with railways traversing the county in two directions, this natural highway rolls to its union with the Mississippi undisturbed save by occasional steamers which pass up to ply in its distant head-waters in Dakota, and Doniphan left one side by the railway and the river, presents but a faint semblance to the town of early times. Once it was the port of a large and rich farming region and trains of wagons were constantly passing in and out. Its day as a river town and a shipping point is past, but a new day has already dawned upon it in its extensive vineyard and wine producing industry. As a producer of rich wines, it bids fair to gain a new and better commercial reputation than it has ever enjoyed, and to become in the future of far more importance than in its first young growth.\n\nEARLY HISTORY.\n\nThe Doniphan Town Company was organized in November, 1854, the first regular meeting occurring at St. Joseph, Mo., on the 11th of that month, when a full set of officers were elected. These were as follows: T. H. Christopher, President; J. W. Foreman, Treasurer; Dr. J. H. Crane, Secretary; S. K. Miller, G. W. H. Landon, J. F. Forman, Dr. I. A. Chambers, and Felix Robidoux, Trustees. In February, 1855, the report of the committee on locating the town site was received and adopted, and J. F. Forman was appointed to survey the town. For this service he received $2.50 per block, payment being made in town lots. This may account for the humorous description of Mr. Forman as \"the man who owns half the town.\"\n\nAlthough this town company laid out the present town, there had for two years previous been a trading post under Joseph Utt at this point. His cabin stood, like many of the earlier buildings of the town, close to the riverbank, and some fifteen years ago fell a prey to the constantly increasing bend in the river at this point.\n\nThe first building erected in the town, after it was surveyed and laid off in lots, was the dwelling of James F. Forman. The second, the Doniphan House run by B. O'Driscoll. The first store was that of Forman Bros., who kept a general stock. This was followed by the dry goods store of Allen B. Lyon, now a resident of Atchison. Bowdell & Drury operated the first drug store and Dr. Sommers the second. George A. Cutler was the first physician; the second, James L. Datus. The first lawyer was Col. D. M. Johnson, who after a short time formed a partnership with Albert Perry; both gentlemen are now residents of Troy. I. N. Smallwood was the first wagon maker; Patrick Laughlin the first tinner, and William Beauchamp the first blacksmith.\n\nIn 1855 an association was formed by certain disaffected parties in Doniphan for the purpose of opposing obnoxious laws. This body was known as the Danites; Patrick Laughlin, a tinsmith of the town, joined this Society, but on becoming aware of its full purpose became disgusted and openly proclaimed all of its secrets. For this the Danites vowed vengeance, and Samuel Collins, who was the owner of a saw-mill on the river declared that Laughlin should confess that his revelations were lies or die. On the evening of November 28, 1855, Collins met Laughlin but was unarmed, and after repeating his threats said that he 'would come around in the morning and one o them would breakfast in h--l.' The next day, after waiting some time, Laughlin concluded that Collins had forgotten the matter and started to cross the street to his boarding house; in the middle of the street he was met by Collins who at once attempted to shoot him but failed through his weapon missing fire, Collins then drew a knife and stabbed Laughlin so severely, as to bring him to his knees. Before he could proceed further a friend of Laughlin, named Lynch, stepped from the side-walk and fired a \"yager\" at Collins. Although mortally wounded, Collins clubbed his gun and struck his assailant a terrible blow on the head felling him to the ground. Collins was then picked up by his friends and died in a short time; Laughlin and Lynch, although both badly hurt, recovered. This was the end of the Danites.\n\nCITY OFFICIALS.\n\nDoniphan was incorporated as a town on February 11, 1869, and trustees appointed by the probate Judge of the County. These were E. W. Stratton, I. N. Smallwood, Thomas H. Franklin, Adam Brenner and A. C. Low. The Council was organized with E. W. Stratton presiding, L. A. Hoffman, Town Clerk, and T. H. Franklin, Treasurer. This Council was re-elected in 1870, the only change being the appointment of C. H. Phillips as Clerk. In 1871, H. W. Hudnall presided, E. Floerkey was Clerk, and G. M. Waller, Treasurer. In 1872 the town became, by an act of the Legislature, a city of the third class, and the following officers were elected: W. H. Stephens, Mayor; James F. Forman, Police Judge; Thomas Stivers, Clerk; A. Low, Treasurer; L. M. Rector, Marshall. In 1873 W. W. Crook was Mayor. Those who succeeded him in this office are as follows: Adam Brenner, 1874-75; W. H. Nesbit, 1876; J. F. Meyer, 1877; Joseph McCrum, 1878; James F. Forman, 1879; J. H. Sawyer, 1880-81; George Brenner, 1882. The Clerks of the city during this time have been: George W. Baker, 1873; M. T. Landon, 1874-79; Joseph Schletzbaum, 1880-82.\n\nTHE PRESS, SCHOOLS, CHURCHES AND SOCIETIES.\n\nThe first paper in Doniphan was the Doniphan Constitutionalist, which was established in 1856 by Thomas J. Key. This was a strong Pro-slavery sheet, and declined in strength as the principles it advocated became unpopular. It was discontinued in 1858, and its material transferred to Iowa Point, where it was used in the publication of the Inquirer.\n\nThe Crusader of Freedom was started early in 1858 by James Redpath. In politics it was the exact opposite of its predecessor, being as violently Free-state as the former had been Pro-slavery. General J. H. Lane was a large owner in this paper, and it was mainly used as his organ in his struggle for presidential honors. The publisher and owner had a bitter quarrel in May, 1858, and the paper went out of existence.\n\nThe Doniphan Post - In the fall of 1860 the Doniphan Post was produced. On the title page appeared the names of George and William Reese, but only the latter was connected with the paper. In politics the new paper hoisted the Democratic flag, but its course was practically neutral. It passed out of existence after a year's publication. Its material was purchased the following year by Dr. Grant, and taken to Troy to do duty on the Doniphan County Patriot.\n\nThe Doniphan Democrat was launched in May, 1871, by J. J. Ricketts, who employed Thomas Stivers as editor. In politics it was Democratic. It was a quasi \"patent outside,\" the inner pages only being printed at home, the outside at the Patriot office at Atchison. It ran something less than a year.\n\nThe Doniphan Herald was merely a renewal of the Democrat by J. J. and W. W. Cook. It was published a few weeks in the summer of 1872, and then discontinued, the material going to Leavenworth, where it was used on the Kansas Herald.\n\nThe Doniphan County Weekly News was started on March 10, 1882, by Welsh & Son. It is a three-column four page sheet of small size, and devoted purely to local affairs. It reserves the right of opposing any scheme disadvantageous to the town, but remains strictly neutral in political matters. Mr. John Welsh, the editor, was, prior to the publication of the News, a correspondent of the Chief, of Troy. He is physician in large practice, which he still finds time to attend to. The paper appears each Friday.\n\nThe Bible Investigator is published by William Kirby, who lives a short distance from Doniphan. It is a three-column eight-page sheet, and as its name implies, a strongly religious paper. It was started on January 1, 1881.\n\nPrior to 1873 there had been no regular public school in Doniphan. As early as 1856, Mrs. D. Frank taught a subscription school, and three or four years later Miss Sarah M. Walker, now Mrs. Philbrick, held a similar one. This lady was a pupil of \"Zach\" Chandler, and has recently been embalmed in history as the one who, in his boyish days, spanked into obedience Hon. Robert Stevens, the orator of the great G. A. R. meeting at Bedford, N. H.\n\nIn l873, the school building now in use was built by James F. Forman at a cost to the town of about $8.000. This structure is 65x38 feet, two stories in height, and has four rooms, exclusive of those in the basement. Its first principal was J. A. Sea, who was followed by D. D. Rose, now of Troy, David Muir, H. Ward, D. D. Rose, a second time, and Charles H. Floyd, who taught in 1882. The number of scholars has varied greatly, and is now about sixty.\n\nThe first religious services in Doniphan were held by Father Alderson, a Baptist minister, who preached at different times In 1855. The first church organization was that of the Presbyterians, who formed a society in 1856. A church building was begun as a Baptist project but changed to a Union one, and finally fell into the hands of the Presbyterians. By them it was occupied until about two years ago, when the death of several prominent members and the removal of others caused the death of the society. The building is now tenantless and in bad repair.\n\nThe Methodist Episcopal Church South - The Southern Methodists organized at Doniphan in 1856 while the state and county were still in the hands of the Pro-slavery party. No church edifice was ever built, but services were held at different points in town for a number of years. Revs. Messrs. Wallace, Hedgepeth, Howell, Arrington, King and Thorp, have at different times preached to the society at this place. For a number of years there has been no society of this denomination in the town.\n\nThe First Methodist Episcopal Church of Doniphan was organized on May 10, 1857, with the following members: James W. Snow, Rebecca Snow, Joseph McCrum, Melissa McCrum, and Hannah McCrum. The church was supplied by Rev. B. F. Bowman. In the year 1864, the project of building a house of worship for the Methodist Episcopal Church and congregation was started, a site for that purpose was selected, and the lot was deeded as a gift from Mr. Adam Brenner. A subscription was circulated, and in 1865 the building was completed and dedicated. Rev. Mr. Houts, being pastor of the Methodist Episcopal Church at Doniphan at that time, the whole debt of the church was assumed and paid by the members of the society and citizens of Doniphan and its vicinity. The following ministers have successively occupied the pulpit (as conference appointees) from 1865, to 1882: Revs. Messrs. Houts, Shimp, Shaw, Cooke, Leak, Hoffman, Bowman, and Otto. At this date, the Methodists have no organized society in Doniphan, and the pulpit is alternately supplied by the circuit preachers, and W. L. Leak, preacher for the Doniphan congregation. Doniphan has a comfortable parsonage, but is not now the head of a circuit.\n\nThe Catholic Church of St. John the Baptist - The first Catholic Church in the city of Doniphan was built in the year 1857, and was under the pastoral charge of the Rev. Father Augustine Wirth. This church was a frame structure, and was destroyed by fire in 1864. In the year 1867 the members of the Catholic Church in Doniphan built a handsome brick structure in the western part of the city, adjoining the comfortable residence of Jacob Brenner, Esq., under the supervision of Rev. Father Timothy M. Suber. Its dimensions are 26 x 50 ft., with a stately bell tower, and a fine toned bell weighing nearly half a ton. It is not entirely finished, but is designed in the near future to be, with its stained windows, one of the handsomest chapels in Kansas. Rev. Father Boniface, O. S. B., is the present pastor. Jacob Brenner, Esq., is the Church-warden, and Thomas Sanger, George Brenner, Esq., and James Burke, are the Trustees. The whole block of ground on which the church stands, comprising about two acres, and one of the finest sites n the city, was donated to St. John's by the Hon. Adam Brenner, of the city of Doniphan.\n\nArcana Lodge, No. 31, A. F. & A. M. , was organized under a dispensation on December 29, 1858 at 3 p. m., with the following officers: A. R. Foreman, W. M.; J. W. Sheppard, S. W.; J. F. Forman, J. W. The charter was granted by the Grand Lodge of the State on October 17, 1860, on the application of A. R. Forman, J. F. Forman, J. W. Sheppard, B. S. Wharton, A. Brenner, J. A. Vanosdale, G. M, Waller, Oscar Brown, and H. W. Hansen. The officers at this time were: A. R. Forman W. M.; J. W. Sheppard, S. W.; J. F. Forman, J. W. The Lodge has now a membership of fifty and the following officers: W. H. Nesbit, W. M.; B. T. Curtis, S. W.; A. B. Smith, J. W.; James Schlitzbaum, secretary; A. Windsor, treasurer,\n\nDoniphan Chapter No. 13, R. A. M. , was organized on October 17, 1869, with the following charter members: J. L. Thompson, J. Smallwood, J. F. Forman, J. L. Philbrick, P. J. Vanderslice, C. C. Camp. The first officers of the society were: J. L. Thompson, H. P.; I. Smallwood, K.; J. F. Forman, scribe. The chapter has now eighteen members. Its officers are: J. L. Philbrick, H. P.; E. W. Stratton, K.; L. A. Messenger, scribe; J. F. Forman, secretary; A. Windsor, treasurer. Meetings are held.\n\nThe Doniphan Dramatic Club. - This club was founded in November, 1880, the officers for the first year being W. H. H. Curtis, president; W. H. Nesbit, vice-president; J. G. Brownlee, secretary; N. G. Brenner, treasurer; A. Low, acting and stage manager, The object of the society is to afford instruction and recreation for its members and amusement to the public. They have leased Brenner's Hall for a term of years, and under the efficient management of Mr. Low have erected a neat and comfortable stage. The scenery was painted by Mr. A. Low, and would do credit to a much larger place. During the season they give, about once a month, an entertainment, which is always well attended. The present membership comprises twenty of Doniphan's best young ladies and gentlemen.\n\nYoung Folks Literary Society. - This society was organized in June, 1882, for the purpose of mutual improvement and literary recreation. Its exercises are much like those of other similar organizations, and embrace recitations, music and debates. The officers of the society are as follows: J. K. Welsh, president; Miss Lizzie Litner, vice-president; Miss Emma Hahn, treasurer; Miss Etta Earhart, secretary.\n\nBUSINESS INTERESTS.\n\nIn the summer of 1855 Samuel Collins erected a saw-mill near the river. This was a very complete affair for the times and cost not far from ten thousand dollars. After Collins' death, in November, 1859, the mill was sold to other parties, who the following year removed it from the town.\n\nIn April, 1857, James F. Forman purchased a saw-mill valued at two thousand five hundred dollars and set it up on the bank of the river, near the Collins mill. In the summer of 1858 this mill was destroyed by fire, A new mill of about the same capacity was at once erected and put in operation, but this also was burned in 1861. Mr. Forman then retired from this branch of business.\n\nIn the years of 1856-57, J. W. Forman built a flouring mill near Spring Creek. ~ This building, which was the only one ever in the town, was erected at a cost of thirteen hundred dollars. Two years after its completion, and while Doniphan was at the height of its prosperity, the mill was burned. This was in the winter of 1869, and the St. Joseph & Western Railway going through the county soon after, it was deemed best not to rebuild the mill.\n\nThe first hotel in this place was built by Forman Brothers, and called the Doniphan House. It was opened B. O'Driscoll, who ran it some time and was followed by A. Low and Captain Dix. The latter occupied it at the time of its destruction by fire in the fall of 1868. It was valued at four thousand dollars.\n\nThe St. Charles Hotel was built in 1857, and was burned in 1860. There is now no hotel building in the city.\n\nIn 1867 a large elevator, the first in the State, was built at this place by Adam Brenner. It had a capacity of 40,000 bushels of grain, and cost $16,000. It was burned in 1872 with a large amount of grain stored in it, and was an almost total loss, but $3,000 of insurance being collected.\n\nOn Main Street stands a large two-story brick building bearing the sign \"Brenner Vineyard.\" This building was erected in 1869 by Adam Brenner to accommodate his large and increasing wine business. It is sixty-five by forty-four feet and two stories in height with ample cellars beneath. There is storage for 90,000 gallons of wine, and there is now on hand upward of 30,000 gallons. This is the product of the vineyard, occupying over fifty acres and located a short distance from the city. These wines are among the finest in the county, and command high prices from those who desire a strictly pure article for medicinal purposes.\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES.\n\nALBERT ALBERTSON, at present a thrifty Danish farmer, but for many years a hardy and daring seaman, came to Kansas in the spring of the year 1865, and located in Wayne Township, Doniphan County, and has resided there since. Mr. A. is a member of the Lutheran Church, of Arcana Lodge, No. 31, A. F. & A. M, of Doniphan, of Troy Chapter No. 16, R. A. M., and of Washington Commandery Knights Templar No. 2, of Atchison. All during the late war of the Rebellion Mr. Albertson was chief mate of various steamers in the employ of the United States Government, and plied principally on the Mississippi, Cumberland and Tennessee rivers, and was in numerous engagements during this time. Mate Albertson was born on the Island of Ara, in Denmark, August 14, 1822, and lived on his native isle until his twelfth year, when he ran away to sea and adopted a sailor's life, which he followed all his days until he came to Kansas. During the Mexican War, Mate Albertson was in the employ of the United States Government, and was engaged in transporting troops for the American army from St. Louis to New Orleans. During this time, and while Mr. Albertson was mate of the transport steamer \"Louisiana,\" news was received of the capture of Cerro Gordo by Gen. Scott. Mate Albertson and his comrades desired to celebrate the victory by firing a national salute. While so engaged, owing to the premature discharge of one of the cannon, one of the gunners was killed and Mate Albertson severely wounded in the left hand by a splinter from the cannon, from which he suffers today. After the conclusion of the Mexican War he was steam boating on the Mississippi and Missouri rivers and was so engaged until he came to Kansas. Mr. Albertson was married in St. Louis, July 30, 1852, to Miss Christina Hansen, a native of Norway. They have no children. Mr. Albertson, since his advent in the State, devotes his entire time to managing his large farm and ranks among the prosperous farmers of Kansas.\n\nANDERS ANDERSON, farmer, P. O. Doniphan, came to Kansas in the spring of 1860 and located in Wayne Township, Doniphan County, where he has always resided, with the exception of the time spent in the United States army. He is an active member of the Lutheran Church, and by his efforts and more substantial aid assisted in erecting the church building. He has been secretary of the congregation for ten years, and served six years as director of school boards in districts where he resided. Mr. Anderson was in the army during the late war, as a Sergeant of Company G, Eighth Kansas Infantry, and was enlisted October 2, 1861, at Fort Leavenworth; shared in all the dangers and hardships of his command (from the effects of which he suffers to-day), and was mustered out of the service October 2, 1864, at Point Lookout, Md. Mr. A. during his term of service did duty in Wyoming Territory, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia. He was born in Hommedals Parish, Christiansands Stift, Norway, December 22, 1822, and lived in his native place until the fall of 1846, when he came to America and located in Buchanan County, Mo., where he lived three years and was engaged as a carpenter. From Missouri he went to Sacramento, Cal., where he remained a short time, and then went to the mines in Placer, Nevada and Yuba Counties, where he was engaged in prospecting until the fall of 1853, and then returned via Panama in the spring of 1854 to Missouri, where he lived until he came to Kansas. Mr. Anderson and his brothers live and work a farm, an undivided estate of 160 acres, in Wayne Township. The farm is rolling prairie and very fertile, and one of the best in the township. They have an orchard on the farm, which supplies apples enough for home consumption and to spare. The also have peaches, blackberries and grapes in abundance, and good out-buildings. There is a never-failing well of pure water close to the house. There is also a fine stream of water running through the farm.\n\nNELS ANDERSON, farmer, P. O. Doniphan, came to Kansas in the spring of 1860, and located in Wayne Township, Doniphan County, where he has always lived, except the time spent in the army.

In 1867 he removed to Iowa Point Kas., where he opened a branch of the house of A. & G. Brenner. He remained at Iowa Point about one and a half years, and then returned to Doniphan, bought out his partner's interest in the business and ran it on his own account for about one year. In 1869 he planted his first vineyard which then embraced only five acres. Bellevue Vineyard now occupies about forty-five acres, and the total manufacture of wines amounts to 25,000 gallons annually. In the busy season over fifty hands are employed at Bellevue Vineyards. The name of \"Bellevue\" was given by Mr. Brenner to his grounds, from the commanding position and beautiful scenery of the surrounding country viewed from his place. The grounds gradually slope from where his home is centered, which is laid off with beautiful grape arbors of different lengths. One of especial mention extends 150 feet and is thirteen feet wide by ten high, fairly laden with the luscious fruit. Surrounding are his vaults, packing and storehouses. This year he is making decided improvements, expecting to do a larger business than of any preceding year. He is truly a self-made young man and has a local standing as a social and business man to be envied by any. He uses every effort to sustain the high character and standing of the rapidly growing reputation of the Brenner wines. Though the yards of Jacob, Adam and George Brenner adjoin each other and the manufacturing and selling of the produce are separate, yet in every degree all the wines possess the same high qualities. That grape culture has proven in this section of country a success beyond a doubt by the Messrs. Brenner, and that to this industry Doniphan must attribute its leading support and mainstay, is shown by the number of acres in grapes now in cultivation around here. There are over 100 acres which this year will yield 1,000,000 pounds of grapes, producing 75,000 gallons of wine and requiring many casks, ranging from 300 to 2,400 gallons capacity. There are twenty-four varieties of grapes grown, but those yielding the best and getting the most attention are the Concord, Virginia Seedling, Elvira, Martha, Delaware, Catawba, and Goethe. The Elvira, a white variety, has been unusually successful, making the finest of native white wine. The white Concord made here is taking the lead in the market for its fine qualities. Mr. Brenner makes a specialty of the Goethe and Virginia Seedling wines. The Doniphan wine trade extends into Kansas, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado Texas, Michigan, and Montana, having large and regular customers in each State.\n\nJACOB BRENNER, proprietor Central Vineyards, came to Kansas June 7, 1860, and located in Doniphan, where he has since resided.

Mr. Brenner started the Central Vineyards in 1864, with only 200 vines, as a matter of experiment. His vineyards, which are called the Central because they lie between the vineyards of his brother Adam and his son George, now contain over fifteen acres, and the annual production of wine is about 7,000 gallons. Mr. Brenner attends personally to his vineyards, selling his productions as fast as he can get them ready for market. He has one variety of wine, the Taylor Bullit, which is not manufactured at either of the other vine-yards, and of which he has the monopoly of sale. It is much superior in quality, in the opinion of competent judges and connoisseurs, to any wine produced in Doniphan. The dimensions of Mr. B.'s wine cellar are 22x38 feet, and 10 feet high. Its storage capacity is about 10,000 gallons. The other varieties of wines produced by him are the Virginia Seedling, Dry Catawba, White and Red Concord. From twenty to twenty-five hands are employed by him during the busy season. He does not care much as to the quantity of wine he produces in a season, but he is very careful as to its quality.
