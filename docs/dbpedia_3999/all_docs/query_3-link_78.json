(3 Credits)\n\nThis course is a philosophical reflection on the central metaphysical and epistemological questions surrounding human nature, which includes discussion of some or all of the following problems: the body/soul distinction and the mind/body problem; the problem of knowledge (relativism, skepticism, the objectivity of knowledge, faith, and reason); free will and determinism; self and society (subjectivity, personhood, sociality, historicity, and tradition); and the elements of identity (such as race, gender, sexuality, ability, and socioeconomic status). At least 60% of each section of the course is devoted to readings from Plato, Aristotle, Augustine or Aquinas, and Descartes. Each section includes some writings by at least one contemporary figure and one figure coming from a group traditionally underrepresented in philosophy. Selected sections will be offered as Eloquentia Perfecta I seminars.\n\nAttribute: FRPT.\n\nPHIL 1003. Lost Interlocutor: Philosophy of Human Nature. (3 Credits)\n\nThis course examines the philosophical views of pre-Socratic thinkers, Plato, Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Descartes, and Ignatius of Loyola and their connections to contemporary science, religion, and Jesuit education. We analyze primary texts, critique theories, compose philosophical arguments, and critically challenge the thinking of multiple perspectives. These skills comprise the greater philosophical tradition that stems from the ancients to us today. Salient themes of our lives—knowledge, understanding, truth, falsity, doubt, goodness, mortality, reality, evidence, belief, love—stir fundamental questions that need systematic investigation in order to make sense of our human nature and give greater purpose to life. Since this Manresa course satisfies the FCRH first year Eloquentia Perfecta I requirement, it stresses critical spoken dialogue and writing-intensive assignments. It also consists of interactive (and fun) out-of-class learning experiences, and the professor even feeds you at most of these. This course satisfies the Philosophy of Human Nature Core requirement for both FCRH and Gabelli students.\n\nAttributes: FRPT, MANR, PHFR, SL.\n\nPHIL 1010. Introduction to Critical Thinking. (3 Credits)\n\nThe course is intended to sharpen a student's ability to think clearly, consistently, critically, and creatively. The course objective considers principles of sound judgment and helps students learn how to recognize and analyze arguments present in ordinary spoken and written language, how to distinguish correct reasoning from incorrect reasoning, and how to construct valid, sound arguments.\n\nPHIL 1999.

(3 Credits)\n\nThis course involves philosophical reflection on the major normative ethical theories underlying moral decision-making in our everyday lives. The principal focus of the course is a systematic introduction to the main normative ethical theories, i.e., eudaimonism, natural law ethics, deontological ethics, utilitarianism, virtue ethics, and feminism. The differences among these approaches are illuminated by studying various moral issues. In each section of the course, at least half of the readings will be selected from Aristotle and Kant. Each section will include writings by at least one contemporary figure and one figure coming from a group traditionally underrepresented in philosophy.\n\nAttributes: HHPA, HUST, PETH.\n\nPrerequisites: PHIL 1000 or PHIL 1003 or HPRH 1002 or HPRH 1103 or HPLC 1001.\n\nPHIL 3109. Environmental Ethics. (4 Credits)\n\nThis senior values seminar surveys major theories in environmental ethics dealing with our moral duties regarding nature: for example, environmental stewardship, sustainable development, environmental justice, ecological virtue ethics, animal rights, biocentrism, Leopold's land ethic, and ecological feminism. It has not only philosophical but also scientific, economic, political, and design dimensions as it deals with such topics as global warming, alternative energy, pollution control, suburban sprawl, deforestation, biodiversity loss, and the prospect of a sixth mass species extinction event threatening the future of human and nonhuman life as we know it.

Hume's Ethics. (4 Credits)\n\nDavid Hume famously (or infamously) declared that “[r]eason is, and ought only to be the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them” (THN 2.3.3). But what does moral theory look like when feelings are the foundation for morality? In this course, we will explore Hume’s sentimentalist moral theory, examining Hume's \"A Treatise on Human Nature\" and \"An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals,\" along with supplementary excerpts from Hume’s letters and essays, and occasional pieces of secondary literature. We will study Hume's views on meta-ethics, moral psychology (the passions/emotions and sympathy), moral motivation and freedom, moral judgment, virtue (including justice), and happiness. While this course is primarily focused on Hume's own views, we will also engage with present-day Humean positions in moral philosophy.

Philosophy of Economics. (4 Credits)\n\nEconomics grew out of philosophy, carrying forward key philosophical ideas that continue to operate as grounding assumptions, goals, and regulatory ideals in the discipline. Some of these philosophical ideas have been challenged on the grounds of realism, coherence, usefulness, consequences, and compatibility with important values like justice, fairness, human dignity, democracy, liberty, equality, and the general welfare. Philosophy of Economics analyzes, criticizes, and creatively rethinks both classical and contemporary texts that deploy and challenge the philosophical ideas that continue to guide economics as a discipline that has great influence in framing and rationalizing public policy. Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.\n\nAttribute: PHMP.\n\nPrerequisites: PHIL 3000 or HPLC 1001 or HPRH 1002 or HPRH 1103.\n\nPHIL 3140. Market Failures, Public Goods, and Justice. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course focuses on a fundamental question for social justice: Which goods and services should be provided by free markets, which should generally be supplied by nonprofits (NGOs), and what is the remainder that should be secured by government? No economic background is assumed on the part of the student, but the course will examine economic conceptions of public goods that markets cannot optimally supply, as well as debates about expanding this category. We will consider arguments that some choices concern objective goods and harms that should not simply be left up to consumer decisions in free markets, and consider what the institutional preconditions of effective markets include. A range of public goods, including some at the global level, will also be debated. Readings will include recent popular works on types of market failure that are now widely debated, some philosophical work on public goods, and an introduction to elementary game theory with simple matrices. We will also consider a few recent articles and book chapters arguing that some functions often performed by government should be taken over by the nonprofit sector, and will question what social justice concerns the rapid growth of this sector may raise. Students of all political orientations are welcome!

Democracy and Constitutional Order: Classical American Philosophy. (4 Credits)\n\nDemocratic justice has two main poles: popular sovereignty and constitutional order. Founders of the American federal government in the Revolutionary period sought to balance these values, but the idea that people might vote for slavery brought them into crisis. This forced civic republicans, including Lincoln, to articulate the moral preconditions of legitimate democracy in a clearer way. With federalist arguments for more centralized power as a starting point, this course will consider alternative conceptions of democratic justification that emerged from the American debates with an eye to contemporary applications. In particular, we will clarify and debate proposed constitutional reforms that are being considered today.

Philosophy of Technology. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course will explore the philosophy of technology, seeking to understand the way in which technology is transforming our relationships to ourselves, to other people, and to our world. Guiding questions for the course include: What is technology? Is technology necessarily good or bad for human flourishing, or is just neutral? How are science and technology related? Do we need a special ethics of technology? The course will explore multiple traditions and historical periods, with special emphasis on analytic and continental philosophy in the 20th and 21st centuries.

Political Libertarians and Critics. (4 Credits)\n\nAn exposition and critique of political libertarianism - a philosophical theory developed by Ayn Rand, Hayek, Friedman, Nozick, Naveson and others - that has come to dominate neoconservative political thought in the U.S. We will read major libertarian texts and criticisms by David Gauthier, Hazlett, Rawls, Singer, and other defenders of public goods.

Introduction to Logic. (4 Credits)\n\nA study of the methods and principles that distinguish correct argumentation. Attention is given both to the nature of argument and to its applications. Topics discussed include induction, deduction (including symbolic notation) and the common fallacies. Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.\n\nAttributes: LING, PHKM.\n\nPrerequisites: PHIL 3000 or HPLC 1001 or HPRH 1002 or HPRH 1103.\n\nPHIL 3204. Symbolic Logic. (4 Credits)\n\nHumans are capable of altering their behavior, verbal and otherwise, in light of deductive consequences and in conformity with standards of logical consistency. Although Aristotle, the Stoics, and others developed formal techniques for the evaluation of logical consequence and consistency, the early 20th Century witnessed an unprecedented expansion in the scope and power of those techniques through the construction of formal languages based on mathematical principles. Students consider the modern development of formal logical techniques including propositional logic, first-order logic, and if time permits, a system of intentional logic (e.g. modal logic), and then explore some of the philosophical issues surrounding them. Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.\n\nAttributes: LING, PHKM.\n\nPrerequisites: PHIL 1000 or HPLC 1001 or HPRH 1002 or HPRH 1103.\n\nPHIL 3230. How to Keep an Open Mind: Philosophical and Scientific Perspectives. (4 Credits)\n\nOur world is full of information that we can use to learn truths and correct our mistakes, but it is often difficult to recognize when and how to take advantage of it. When should we have an open mind and when should we stop looking into matters? And what are possible steps we can take to keep our minds open? The course will explore a series of issues on this topic from the perspectives of philosophy and the social sciences, including the nature of epistemic virtue and vice, informational aggregation and “the wisdom of crowds,” rational ignorance, precommitment, adversarial inquiry, and more. Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.\n\nAttribute: PHKM.\n\nPrerequisites: PHIL 3000 or HPLC 1001 or HPRH 1002 or HPRH 1103.\n\nPHIL 3235.

Idealism and Realism. (4 Credits)\n\nDo minds have a privileged position in the world? Do objects, moral values, beauty, and truth exist independently of the mind? Or might objects, moral values, beauty, and truth depend in some way on minds? And if so, how? This course will examine various answers to these and related questions from both historical figures and contemporary figures.\n\nAttribute: PHME.\n\nPrerequisites: PHIL 3000 or HPLC 1001 or HPRH 1002 or HPRH 1103.\n\nPHIL 3243. Philosophy of Cognitive Science. (4 Credits)\n\nUnlike inanimate objects such as rocks, we are aware of the world around us. Energy from the sun heats both the rock and you, but unlike the rock you also feel the heat, you know that it comes from the sun, you can understand what it is, and can think about it even when it is absent. How exactly are we able to do this? What makes us capable of thinking, feeling, and perceiving? Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary attempt to answer questions like these. This course explores some of the dominant research programs in cognitive science with an eye to understanding and critically evaluating the philosophical assumptions on which they depend.

Problems in Epistemology. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course explores central problems in recent epistemology with a focus on debates regarding rational belief, defeasible reasoning, and the nature of evidence. The course will highlight methodological questions concerning the scope and purpose of epistemological reflection and theorizing Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.\n\nAttribute: PHKM.\n\nPrerequisites: PHIL 3000 or HPLC 1001 or HPRH 1002 or HPRH 1103.\n\nPHIL 3253. Relativism and Philosophy. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course analyzes and evaluates various forms of contemporary relativism: epistemological, ontological, and moral. It also investigates whether human rationality is so diverse as to be relativistic in nature.

Philosophy of Perception. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course examines a selection from the many contemporary philosophical debates about our perceptual awareness of the external world. The course involves issues in epistemology (e.g. what is perceptual information?), philosophy of mind (e.g. representationalism, perceptual content), neuroscience (e.g. how does the visual system work?), and metaphysics (e.g. color theory).

Skepticism. (4 Credits)\n\nSkepticism about the possibility of knowledge, and in particular about our knowledge of the external world, has a long history, from Sextus Empiricus to Hume and Berkeley up to a wide array of present-day debates. As it is plausible that epistemological theory emerges from a dialectic with skepticism, analysis of skeptical arguments gives substance to our claims to have achieved knowledge. This course examines many of these arguments, historical and contemporary.

Relativism and Skepticism. (4 Credits)\n\nOn the road to knowledge, skepticism is a \"go slow\" or perhaps a \"stop\" sign, while relativism says \"the speed limit is yours to determine\". Both views challenge sedate norms of epistemology and each other. This course examines in detail contemporary versions of skeptic and relativistic claims about our knowledge of and judgments about, the world and ourselves.

Feyerabend’s Philosophy of Science. (4 Credits)\n\nFeyerabend (1924-1994) was an innovative thinker who proposed a radical philosophy of science drawing on the factive history of science (rather than the myth of science). Participants will read his \"Against Method\" in addition to selections from his other works, including his reflections on empiricism and epistemology and on his commitment to pluralism and humanitarianism as well as his posthumous (unfinished) \"Conquest of Abundance.\" Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.\n\nAttribute: PHKM.\n\nPrerequisites: PHIL 3000 or HPLC 1001 or HPRH 1002 or HPRH 1103.\n\nPHIL 3301.

Faith After the Death of God. (4 Credits)\n\nCan belief in God be justified, or are there compelling reasons to suspend judgment or to believe that there is no God? This course will debate the rationality of faith after death of God and the rise of atheism in modernity. The course will investigate whether it is rational to believe in God and what would be the epistemological foundations necessary for beliefs about the existence of God or about the nature of God. Students will examine proofs for the existence of God from classic sources, e.g., Aristotle, Neo-Platonism, Augustine, Aquinas, and rationalism, as well as from defenders of skepticism and atheism. Students will read major authors on these questions, both classic and contemporary, such as Hume, Kant, Nietzsche, Aquinas, Plantinga, Feser, Eliade.

Early Modern Philosophy: Self and World. (4 Credits)\n\nIn this class, we will read, examine, and interpret the works of several figures in Early Modern philosophy (roughly the 17th and 18th centuries). Along with the revolutions in scientific theory and practice that characterized this period, there were revolutions in the ways we understand fundamental philosophical questions and their possible answers. Some of the topics we will focus on are the nature of the human being as a thinking and feeling creature, the gendered human being, the human being in relation to other animals, and the human being in relation to other human beings. Readings will be chosen from Montaigne, de Gournay, La Boetie, de las Casa, Hobbes, Cavendish, Locke, Descartes, Elisabeth of Bohemia, Malebranche, de Lambert, du Chatelet, Hume, Voltaire.

Modernity and Its Critics. (4 Credits)\n\nThe debate about modernity looms larger than ever: is it to be rejected or defended? This course will investigate major thinkers of modern philosophy and its political orders leading up to the Enlightenment, such as Hobbes, Locke, and Rousseau, and will explore the question of what constitutes “the Enlightenment project.” After examining major elements of “modernity,” students will turn to influential critics, both from pre-modern and post-modern perspectives, who have been calling us to reject modernity, in whole or in part, whether because of its claims to universal reason, its illusory notion of the self, its conquest of nature, its abandonment of the classical ideal of the virtues, or its secularism and loss of transcendence and meaning. In the final section of the course, readings will turn to modernity's recent defenders. Students will be asked to weigh in on the debate over modernity and to find their own voice in dialogue with modernity’s defenders and critics.

Kierkegaard. (4 Credits)\n\nKnown occasionally as the “founder of existentialism,” Søren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813-1855) had a profound and lasting impact on philosophical reflection on the nature of the self, faith, ethics, rationality, and the possibility and meaning of philosophical discourse more generally.

Marx as a Philosopher. (4 Credits)\n\nKarl Marx is more commonly approached as an economist, sociologist, or political theorist than as a philosopher. But this class will explore the original philosophical positions offered by Marx as well as the philosophical basis and results of his often polemical exchanges with others. Topics include Marx’s philosophy of history, philosophical anthropology, materialist critique of idealism, as well as his normative social and political philosophy. We will also discuss Marx’s theory of revolution and his stance on the limits of philosophy itself. The goal is to develop the possible internal consistency, social applicability, and limits of Marx’s philosophy.

Additionally, we will underscore posthumanism and what Nietzsche called ‘loyalty to the earth.’ Reading “Beyond Good and Evil” with its sequel, “On the Genealogy of Morals,” this course foregrounds Nietzsche’s theory of knowledge, including the ‘Prejudices of the Philosophers’ in “Twilight of the Idols.” Reading his “Ecce Homo” as a companion throughout, we will reflect on Nietzsche’s “the eternal return of the same” along with his negative ontology—“no truth,” “no facts”—and the ubiquity of ‘Will to Power.’ Note: Four-credit courses that meet for 150 minutes per week require three additional hours of class preparation per week on the part of the student in lieu of an additional hour of formal instruction.\n\nAttribute: PHCM.\n\nPrerequisites: PHIL 3000 or HPLC 1001 or HPRH 1002 or HPRH 1103.\n\nPHIL 3631. 19th Century Philosophy.

Philosophy and Language. (4 Credits)\n\nEarly in the 20th Century, philosophy took what has been called \"the linguistic turn.\" While continental structuralists and post-structuralists developed theories according to which all concepts are interpretative, in analytic philosophy, positivists tried to reduce many key questions of metaphysics and epistemology to issues of usage. This course will survey major contemporary theories of sense, reference, and meaning that have developed since the mid-20th century, explaining their methodological implications for the analysis of other philosophical topics.

Merleau-Ponty: Philosopher of the Body. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course is devoted to an intensive study of one important and innovative book: Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception, one of the most groundbreaking and influential works of philosophy in the 20th century. Rejecting the assumption that mind and body are separate, Merleau-Ponty offers an account of the sensorimotor body as the subject of experience rather than giving that role to consciousness or a disembodied mind. His rich, first-person, descriptive account of perception demonstrates that the animate body in sensation and movement is our original meaning-making relation to the world. While our study will focus on reading systematically through this single primary text, we will also have a few readings that contextualize influences on Merleau-Ponty, as well as his impact on current scholarship.

Philosophy of Space and Time. (4 Credits)\n\nSpace and time are fundamental features of the physical universe in which we live, and are essential to our consciousness of the world. Philosophers from Augustine to Leibniz and Kant have asked what time is, whether it is a real feature of the causal order of nature or rather imposed by our conscious experience. Developments in 20th century physics and philosophy have forced us to rethink the relation of space and time, reconsider whether the future might be as real as the past, and whether time really \"moves\" forward. The course will explore the leading contemporary theories and draw connections with developments in science. No advanced background in physics is required.

(4 Credits)\n\nExistentialism and Literature seeks to examine how the ideas of existentialist philosophy--in such thinkers as Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, Heidegger, Marcel, Sartre, Camus, Blanchot and Merleau-Ponty--are expressed in and through literature. Alongside philosophical writings, we will read literary works by such writers as Dostoevsky, Rilke, Kafka, Sartre, de Beauvoir, and Camus. Themes include the nature and structure of the self; authenticity and inauthenticity; alienation and the fear of death; meaning and meaninglessness, and the existence or absence of God.

Human Rights Theories: Foundations and History. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course will introduce students to the main philosophical theories of human rights, including both “political-legal” accounts and “moral” (or orthodox) theories that focus on the “inherent dignity” of persons. The main goal is to understand and evaluate proposed justifications and critiques of human rights in historical context. We will consider how western conceptions of human rights grew out of natural law and early modern accounts of natural rights—especially in Enlightenment ethical thought—before being globalized in the 20th century. The course will include readings addressing challenges based on cultural differences, and non-Western approaches to human rights. While considering 20th- and 21st-century proposals, we will also assess libertarian opposition to social and economic rights, and whether human political rights have different grounds than basic personal liberties. We will also consider historical and imaginative examples, and how to understand more specific human rights as opposed to highly general categories. But the focus of this course is on the philosophical accounts, rather than on ways that human rights inform global institutions and connect with issues concerning global justice more broadly.

Rights, Justice, and Global Governance. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course introduces students to three philosophical accounts of global justice, and related weaker and stronger conceptions of regional and global governance institutions that may be needed to realize global justice. To evaluate institutional proposals, we will use some elementary game theory to explain the concept of global public goods, along with a handful of closely related economics concepts that are useful in evaluating global trade, finance, the work of international NGOs, treaty regimes, and other global systems. No background in these areas is assumed; everything needed will be supplied in the course content. Using these tools, we will consider cases that illustrate threats and obstacles, including military and economic pressures from tyrannical regimes, democratization, extreme poverty and popular growth, environmental challenges and sustainable resource use, oppression of women, and certain emerging technologies. We will also explore how human rights ideals may be qualified or appear differently within such an institutional framework and a sketch of “basic structures” at regional and global levels.This course builds on Theories of Human Rights but that is not a prerequisite. The course does not cover treaties and concepts related to Just War Theory in any depth, as these are the focus of another elective. The course involves no ideological litmus test; all political views (including agnosticism) are welcome in our conversations.

Humanitarianism and Philosophy. (4 Credits)\n\nWe are all familiar with aid agencies asking for donations to support their life-saving work. Often these appeals aim to stimulate compassion for the suffering of distant strangers in ways that prompt us to act. This course takes humanitarian action—broadly construed as organized attempts to alleviate the suffering of distant strangers—as a point of departure for analyzing a range of issues using the tools of moral and political philosophy. We will attempt to better understand the nature and scope of our moral obligations to distant strangers as well as the nature and value of moral sentiments like compassion and their relation to justice. We will engage different frameworks for evaluating various modes of humanitarian action by non-governmental organizations, governments, and international bodies. We will also critically examine the modes of representation used to portray the suffering of distant strangers.

Human Rights and Global Justice. (4 Credits)\n\nThis interdisciplinary class will focus on the development of the human rights paradigm in international law and philosophical questions about how we can justify universal basic rights. For example, are universal rights consistant with a wide array of varying cultures and ways of life? Are concepts of rights somehow inherently \"western\" or \"individualist\", and can relativist doubts about human rights be answered? We will also look at some debates about the content of such rights, e.g. rights to educational opportunity, to welfare or subsistence, to basic health care, to membership in a culture, to immigration, to a sustained environment and other controversial cases. We will also consider humnitarian intervention in the name of rights, problems with the UN system, and ways that the international order could be restructured if we take seriously the idea that there are universal basic rights to freedom from tyranny and to development out of poverty.

Kant and Hegel. (4 Credits)\n\nThis course will examine the relationship between the philosophical writings of Immanuel Kant and G.W.F Hegel. Kant's philosophy was understood by many of his contemporaries primarily as a philosophy of freedom, and in the first part of this course we will attempt to understand the pivotal role that the relationship between nature and freedom plays in both Kant's theoretical and moral writings. During the second part of the course, we will examine both Hegel's criticisms of Kant's philosophy and the ways in which Hegel's philosophy, neverthless, attempts to develop particular Kantian insights.

Evil Choices. (4 Credits)\n\nWhat makes a bad choice evil? And what motivates somebody to do evil? Are only morally depraved persons capable of making evil choices? Or can an evil choice be made by someone who might be considered good or even admirable under other circumstances? Is it possible to choose evil for evil’s sake? Or is every evil choice motivated by a desire to obtain some good, for oneself or for others? This course explores these questions with the help of great philosophers throughout history. We consider ancient accounts of evildoing (Plato and Aristotle), medieval views on Lucifer (Augustine, Anselm, and Aquinas), modern approaches to radical evil (Kant), and contemporary reflections on the Holocaust. We will also read some contemporary psychological research. Our goal is not only to better understand evil, but also to shed some light on human nature and our capacity to choose good in the face of evil.

Philosophy and Science Fiction. (4 Credits)\n\nThe genre of science fiction is used to explore philosophical topics and questions related to the most fundamental, existential, and meaningful aspects of human experience, such as: What does it mean to be human, or a person, and why does that matter? What is the purpose of life? Are technological advances a blessing or curse? Moreover, good philosophical theorizing can help us imaginatively inhabit disparate worlds, to explore the boundaries of what exists, what could be possible, and even what should be the case. This course will cover topics predominant in science fiction, which may include: transhumanism, consciousness and personhood, personal identity and social situatedness, race and gender, the nature of time and time travel, free will, possibility and other worlds, and the meaning of life.
