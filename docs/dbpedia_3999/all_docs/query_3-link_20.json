FRANCIS OF ASSISI, 1181-1226, FOUNDER THE FRIARS MINOR IN THE UNITED STATES With a Brief History of the Orders of St. Francis in General CHICAGO, ILLINOIS PUBLISHED UNDER THE AUTHORITY •OF THE VERY REVEREND MINISTERS PROVINCIAL OF THE FRIARS MINOR IN THE UNITED STATES. 1 3379 Foreword The following pages from the history of the Friars Minor are offered as a tribute to the Seraph of Assisi, on the occasion of the septicentenary of his death. At the same time they are meant to serve as a memorial of the self-sacrificing labors of the Friars who have carried to our shores the torch of the Franciscan spirit. It may be well to declare here that the data on the various local foundations mentioned in the book are given as reported June 30, 1926. Changes in the per- sonnel of the friaries are constantly occurring, and have occurred since that date. May the present record be an incentive to the Friars of today to continue and intensify the work of St. Francis. To all others may it be an occasion to thank God for the saint, whose word and example are the delight of the Mother Church.

That little poor man was the Poverello of God, St. Francis of Assisi. Sister Death came to little Brother Francis on a Saturday evening, an hour after sundown, October 3, 1226, the forty-fifth year of Francis’ life the twentieth of his conversion. And while singing larks fluttered blithely overhead, his seraphic soul winged its flight to the shining throne in Heaven, once forfeited by Lucifer, but now the reward supreme of the humble Francis. On the following day, the body of St. Francis, adorned with the wounds of Christ Crucified, was borne in triumph to the church of St. George within the city of Assisi; and four years later it was entombed in the Assisian church bearing his own name, San Francesco. But the sweet spirit and the lofty ideals of St. Francis were not interred with his bones. Through the centuries they have lived on and developed in his spiritual sons and daughters, — in the Franciscan Order. As Father Cuthbert, O. S. F. C., correctly says : “St. Francis has continued to live in his disciples through many ages different from his own, and in them his own spirit has been developed, expanding itself with the growth of years and as changing circum- stances demand, but itself remaining the same. . . . Within the sphere of its proper development, the Order is the historical extension of the Saint’s person- ality.” Apart from his order, St. Francis can not be rightly understood. For, in St. Francis we have not only an individual, attracting the world’s admiration, but also the central figure of a great world movement. The following sketch of the Franciscan order is proffered as a tribute to St. Francis himself and as a souvenir of the seventh centenary of his holy death (1226-1926). What Is the Franciscan Order? Some 3,131,800 men and women of the Catholic Church, living in all parts of the world and honoring St. Francis of Assisi as their spiritual father and exemplar, — that is the present Franciscan Order, taken in its widest meaning. All this vast host of followers of the Seraphic Patriarch are members of one or the other of the three orders of St. Francis. The First Order of St. Francis is that of the Friars Minor (Lesser Brothers), which was begun by the Little Poor Man of God when in the spring of 1208 he was joined by Bernard and Peter, “his first brothers in the knightly order of Poverty.” The following year, Francis and his eleven first companions knelt at the feet of Pope Innocent III, and received the great pontiff’s verbal approbation of their new fraternity. The day on which this memorable event took place, April 16, 1209, is rightly considered the birthday of the First Order of St. Francis. To-day this order is divided into three separate and autonomous branches: (1) the Order of Friars Minor, simply so called, (O. F. M.), popu- larly known as the Franciscans, numbering 17,799 members; (2) the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin (O. M. Cap. or O. S. F. C.), popularly the Capu- chins, having over 10,000 members; (3) the Order of Friars Minor Conventual (O. M. C.), popularly the Conventuals or Black Franciscans, with some 1,500 members. At the present day, therefore, the First Order of St. Francis has a membership of approximately 29,300. The Second Order of St. Francis is that of the Poor Ladies, now more commonly known as Poor Clares. It was founded by St. Francis, when on Palm Sunday, 1212, he clothed the youthful Lady Clare of Assisi with the garb of poverty, at the Porziuncola, the chapel of St. Mary of the Angels outside Assisi. St. Clare became the mother of a great throng of spiritual daughters of the Poverello. Though they are cloistered nuns leading an austere life, the Poor Clares, in their various branches, to-day count hardly less than 12,000 members. The Third Order of St. Francis is twofold at the present day: Regular and Secular. The Third Order Secular, usually called simply the Third Order, was founded by St. Francis at Florence or at Faenza, Italy, 1221, for such as desire to follow him without leaving the world. A true order and a true part of the Franciscan order, its members or the Tertiaries as they are called, share in all the good works performed by members of the three orders of St. Francis. This is the lay organization which was hailed by Pope Leo XIII as the remedy for the ills of modern society, and which he recommended to “all pastors of souls, preachers and confessors of the secular and of the regular clergy”, exhorting them to “do all in their power” to spread it among the faithful. Its total mem- bership at the present day is estimated at three millions. The Third Order Regular took its rise after the death of St. Francis, when in the second half of the thirteenth century a number of Tertiaries who were not bound by family or social ties, turned the houses where they held their meetings into permanent religious homes, and began to devote themselves ex- clusively to the service of God and their fellow men. In 1521 Pope Leo X gave to the various Franciscan brotherhoods and sisterhoods then existing, a uniform rule which is based on that of the Third Order Secular as approved by Nicholas IV. At the present day the Franciscan sisterhoods belonging to the Third Order Regular are very numerous, having a combined membership of about 90,000. The Third Order Regular of men now includes not only 2 His Holiness, Pius XI, Tertiary of St. Francis. various brotherhoods, but also communities of priests (e. g., the Third Order Regular with American headquarters at Loretto, Pa.), and totals some 500 members. To render the enumeration of the children of St. Francis more complete, we may mention three additional organizations which, although not parts of the Franciscan order, still endeavor to enter into the spirit of St. Francis. The first is the Archconfraternity of the Cord of St. Francis, instituted by Sixtus V in 1585, and enriched by him with a number of plenary and many partial in- dulgences. Among its prominent members were St. Francis de Sales, bishop of Geneva, and St. Benedict Joseph Labre, the noted beggar saint. The second is the Archconfraternity of the Stigmata, established by Clement VIII in 1594, among the members of which St. Joseph Calasanzi, founder of the Piarists, is prominent. The third is the Franciscan Missionary Union, a world-wide aid society for the Franciscan missions, which are scattered over every continent ; its members likewise enjoy many spiritual privileges. So much for the Francis- can family in general. In a stricter sense, the Franciscan order stands for the three autonomous branches comprising the First Order of St. Francis (Franciscans, Capuchins, Conventuals) and in a still more restricted sense it signifies the first of these branches, the Franciscans, the Order of Friars Minor (Ordo Fratrum Minorum — O. F. M.). In the latter meaning, the term “Franciscan order” will be used in the following pages, unless otherwise stated or apparent from the context; so also the names: “Friars Minor”, “Franciscans” and “Friars”, which are at times referred to the whole First Order of St. Francis. I. Internal History: Development. First Period, 1209-1517: The Undivided Order. Rightly to understand the evolution of the First Order of St. Francis, one must distinguish from the very start between the essential Franciscan ideal and that which was beyond it or fell short of it. Observing the Gospel precepts and counsels literally, and closely imitating the life and activity of Christ and his Apostles as portrayed in the Gospel, St. Francis and his first companions lived a truly ideal life. A joyful unworldliness and a free and frank simplicity were perhaps its most distinctive marks; and perfect poverty was, as Father Cuthbert happily expresses it, “the symbol or sacramental sign of that many-sided life which is included in the following of Christ in his redemptive mission to men.” In the very nature of things, however, the idyllic conditions of that prim- itive life could not long continue with the expansion of the order. As the little fraternity gradually, albeit rapidly, grew into a world-wide order, many of those cherished practices of the first brethren had to be abandoned; for, 4 it is evident, they could not be brought into the lives of so many friars. Francis and the first brethren practised an heroic faith ; they practised virtue in a degree which could not be expected of all those who sought to follow in their footsteps. Yet, without that heroic faith, the mode of life followed by the early Friars would soon become dangerous to the practice of true virtue. Not all could use in the right way the liberty of “itinerant minstrels of the Lord.” Nor would little hermitages in the solitude of the mountains suffice for the maintenance of the regular life. Larger convents, as St. Bonaventure later pointed out, were necessary for this end, especially for the training of the young friars. The essential Franciscan ideal, however, was to remain and endure. This ideal St. Francis embodied in his final rule of 1223, the Rule of the Friars Minor. The order thus organized differed from all other religious orders in especially two points. First, it combined the contemplative and active life; secondly, its mem- ber? renounced not only the personal but also the corporate ownership of all earthly goods, depending for their livelihood solely on labor and alms together with divine Providence. It was mainly this latter, hitherto unheard of, voluntary mendicancy in literal observance of the Gospel, which became the test of perfect loyalty to the Franciscan ideal, and around which centered the greatest difficulties. Yet, this very turn of events was to be expected. For, an ideal so unworldly and simple as the Franciscan ideal of poverty, a principle of life so entirely opposed to the principles commonly accepted in the world at large, was sure to meet opposition from human prudence as soon as it attempted to propagate itself and to subject the very world to itself. Only six years after Innocent III had approved the mode of life of Francis and his companions, the Franciscan ideal of poverty was on the verge of extinc- tion. This happened at the Fourth Lateran Council in 1215, at which Francis himself was present. At this meeting of the pastors of the Church, it had been determined, as Father Cuthbert tells us in his Life of St. Francis, to direct the uprising of the new penitential fraternities into the already established ways of the monastic and canonical life; and in fact the Council did decree that hence- forth no new rules should be allowed, but all future orders must adopt one of the traditional rules as the basis of their organization. Then Innocent III notified the Council of his approbation of the Friars Minor; it was a formal confirmation of his sanction of the rule of the brethren in the presence of the representatives of the Church, and preserved the individuality of the Franciscan family at a critical moment. But the greatest dangers for the Franciscan ideal arose from some of the friars themselves. The order grew too quickly. Almost simultaneously it spread into all lands, and in membership it increased with a rapidity unprecedented as it was unexpected. At the general chapter of 1221, five years before St. Francis 1 John, Cardinal, Bonzano Protector of The Order of Friars Minor death, as many as 3000 friars were present. That among so great a multitude there should be some who failed to grasp the Franciscan ideal, was natural. Already during the lifetime of the seraphic founder, certain friars favored a mitigation of the rigor of the rule, particularly regarding the observance of poverty, and especially after the death of St. Francis, these gathered under the leadership of Brother Elias. On the other hand there were also many friars, with the great St. Anthony of Padua as their leader, who zealously sought to retain the unmitigated rule and the strict Franciscan poverty. But most of these, having personally known St. Francis, likewise clung to the practices of the primitive life. These various tendencies can be traced throughout the his- tory of the order. Gradually, then, the Friars became divided into different parties, although for the first three centuries they were not autonomous but united at least under the same minister general. In the second half of the thirteenth and the first part of the fourteenth centuries, there were the “Spirituals,” who went to one extreme, insisting that all the practises of St. Francis and the early Friars were obligatory, and refusing to accept not merely dispensations but also authentic interpretations of the rule from the pope. The opposite extremists were the “Relaxati,” who tried to introduce mitigations of the rule itself. Between these two parties there was a third, the “Brethren of the Community” (Fratres de Communitate) , who advocated the golden mean, demanding the observance of the rule full and entire but nothing more. The latter party’s cause was justly and tactfully espoused by the great St. Bonaventure, who ruled the order as minister general from 1257 to 1274. Sin- cerely did he reverence the ideal life of St. Francis. But he also knew well the opposition it was sure to meet in real life. Hence he distinguished clearly between that which St. Francis desired at first and practised with his first disciples, and that which he laid down as the duty and rule of the order. The former St. Bonaventure left to the choice of the individual friars ; the latter he strictly demanded of them all. This clear distinction constitutes St. Bonaventure’s standpoint and great merit, and we must thank the able histo- rian, Fr. Leonard Lemmens, O. F. M., for clearly pointing out and demonstrat- ing this as the real position of St. Bonaventure. By thus insisting on the essential Franciscan ideal, St. Bonaventure prevented decadence from tainting the whole order, and justly is' he. styled the second founder of the Order of Friars Minor. After St. Bonaventure’s death the party representing his standpoint did not cease to exist ; rather it has continued to live to the present day. It grew strong in the latter part of the thirteenth century, at the end of which the order num- bered at least some 60,000 members. It was weakened in the early part of the 7 fourteenth century, as we shall see presently. But then it gradually rose again to great power, forming the party of the “Observants,” as the Friars who ob- served the rule strictly came to be called during this period. At the time of St. Bonaventure, the “Brethren of the Community” were in- deed the friars who represented his standpoint; but soon they were divided into two parties, one moderate, the other relaxed. While the former remained true to the standpoint of St. Bonaventure, the latter made common cause with the “Relaxati.” Hence we sometimes find the terms “Brethren of the Community” and “Relaxati” identified, which is due no doubt to the uncompromising “Spir- ituals.” And in this sense only may it be said that the “Community” became the later party of the “Conventuals.” But “the majority of the order,” says Fr. Holzapfel, “with the general at their head, constantly struggled against this (relaxed) party.” (p. 41.) From the beginning, declares the same author, the difference between these two parties lay not merely in their respective positions toward the question of poverty, but even more in the regular discipline which was maintained in the one while it greatly declined in the other, (p. 81.) Thus the observance of poverty and of religious discipline went hand in hand; the presence or lack of the former implied the same of the latter. Conventualism, in its later sense (i. e., community or corporate ownership of goods, income and property), was really introduced into the order by Pope John XXII. Before his time, the ownership of all the goods used by the Friars was vested in the pope, the “Father of all the poor,” since in accordance with their approved rule the Friars had not even the corporate possession of such goods. In 1322, however, Pope John XXII renounced the title of the Church to the goods used by the Friars Minor, and gave the ownership of them to the order, thus placing it on the same footing with other religious orders. The majority of the Friars accommodated themselves to this provision; but they did not altogether relinquish the Franciscan ideal of poverty. Soon Ob- servantism, as we may now call the standpoint of St. Bonaventure in contra- distinction to Conventualism, again appeared openly. As early as 1334, Fr. John de Valle began to live in accordance with the poverty of the rule, albeit not in- dependently from the rest of the order. Sometimes the beginning of Observant- ism is placed in the year 1368, when Fr. Paoluccio Vagnozzi (or simply Paolo) of Trinci, with the permission of his superiors, similarly returned to the ob- servance of the strict Franciscan poverty. True it is that under Fr. Paolo the Observance received a strong impetus. Many were the friars who joined Fr. Paolo, and henceforth the Observance continues to grow in strength. But it is to be borne in mind, that this Observance was practically the same as that of St. Bonaventure; and as it continued to be practised after St. Bonaventure, so also it had existed before him. Now, however, the friars observing the strict poverty of the rule, or the Ob- servants, were further and further separated from those who possessed goods in common, or the Conventuals. This cleavage between the two parties de- veloped from the middle of the fourteenth century ; and in the beginning of the fifteenth century, the Council of Constance (1415) recognized the division, and granted to the Observants provincial vicars and a vicar general. But this did not render the Observants a branch independent of the Conventuals ; for as yet both parties remained united under one and the same minister general. Probably, however, the term “Observance” ( stricta observantia regularis) is here used officially for the first time to designate those Friars who observed the strict poverty of the Franciscan rule. Previously and for a long time, the Observants, i. e., the followers of Fr. Paolo in Umbria, were also called “Zoc- colanti” because of their footwear, wooden slippers worn as a protection against the snakes which abounded in the country at this time. In 1428 Pope Martin V officially revoked for the Observants the summary regulations of John XXII; and two years later (1430) he summoned the whole order, Observants and Conventuals., to a general chapter “for a general reform of the order.” The intellectual leader at this chapter was the celebrated Friar Observant, St. John Capistran. The contemplated reform of the whole order was agreed upon. But shortly after the chapter, in the same year (1430), the Conventual obtained from the same pope, Martin V, the brief Ad statum, which allowed them to hold property like all other orders. This papal dispensa- tion constitutes the Magna Charta of the Conventuals; and here we find them officially called Conventuals for the first time. Nevertheless, there was still but one minister general for the whole order, although an Observant did not hold that office until the complete separation in 1517. Still at the general chapter of Padua (1443) the observant, Fr. Albert Berdini, would surely have been chosen general, had his election not been opposed by the Observant leader, St. Bernardine of Siena. During this period, however, the Observants always had one or more vicars general. In 1438 the minister general named St. Bernardine of Siena first vicar general of the Italian Observants. In this office he was succeeded (1441) by St. John Capistran, who in 1443 became vicar general of the whole Cismontane family of the Observants, i. e., in Italy, the East, Austria-Hungary and Poland. Under these able and saintly leaders the Observance was not only given a definite character but also a vigorous and lasting impulse. But the reform, renouncing as it did all dispensations and liberties contrary to the rule, was merely a return to the practice of St. Bonaventure, which had never wholly ceased. Pope Leo X himself bears witness to this fact in the bull Ite et vos, in which he declares: “Under the leadership of Bonaventure, godfearing men have in the third hour 9 with the help of the Blessed Trinity re-established the walls of the vineyard, which in all places threatened to crumble.” In 1446 Pope Eugene IV issued the so-called Separation Bull, outlined by St. John Capistran. By it the office of vicar general of the Observants was made permanent and well nigh independent of the minister general. But in- asmuch as this vicar could not call a general chapter of the Observants apart from the rest of the order, the order still remained one and undivided. A decade later (1455) St. James of the March, another prominent leader of the Observants, essayed a compromise. Although it was inherently hopeless as such, it obtained for the vicars of the Observants an active voice at the general chapters. The Observants, inasmuch as they observed the rule strictly, now represented the true Friars Minor, and in 1506 a papal decree suppressed, though not with complete success, all other Franciscan reforms. Such a reform were the fol- lowers of John of Guadalupe in Spain, known as Discalced Friars Minor, also as Brethren of the Holy Gospel. They will reappear later as a reform within the ranks of the Observants. Second Period, 1517-1926: The Divided Order. We now come to a landmark in the history of the development of the order. For over three hundred years there had been but one Order of Friars Minor, albeit comprising already for a long period such opposite parties as Observants and Conventuals. But now, in the year 1517, at the capitulum generalissimum summoned by Leo X, the order is divided. This general chapter suppressed once more all reformed parties other than the Observants, and incorporated with the Observants all Friars wishing to observe the rule without dispensations, while completely separating the Observants from the Conventuals. As the true Order of St. Francis, the Observants were henceforth to be called Friars Minor of the Regular Observance or simply Friars Minor ( Ordo Fratrum Minorum— O. F. M.) ; they should have the right to elect the minister general, whose title was to be “Minister Generalis totius Ordinis Fratum Minorum” with or without the addition of “regularis Observantiae,” and who should have the exclusive use of the ancient seal of the order as the legitimate successor of St. Francis ; finally, in processions, etc., they should have precedence over the Conventuals. The Conventuals, on the other hand, comprising the Friars who continued to live under dispensations, were made a separate branch of the First Order of St. Francis. They could elect for themselves a “master general,” who was to be confirmed by the minister general of the Observants. But since the minister general never enforced this right, the Conventuals can rightly be treated from 10 the year 1517 as not only a separate, but also an altogether autonomous branch of the First Order. In 1580 the Conventuals received their own Cardinal Pro- tector, and in 1587 their master general assumed the title of minister general, which subsequent superiors general of the Conventuals have retained. It is not correct, therefore, to say that the Observants were a reform which separated from the Conventuals, as later the Capuchin reform separated from the Observants. As has already been stated, the Observance, though not known by that name, existed previously under St. Bonaventure, and before him as well as after him; for a long time it ran parallel with Conventualism ; and finally, it was declared the true Franciscan Order, while the Conventual Friars were constituted a separate and mitigated branch, dependent to some extent on the Observants, soon, however, to become wholly autonomous. In this connection it is also well to note, that when the right of the minister general of the Observants (as the Friars observing strictly the Franciscan rule and poverty continued to be called) to the title of “minister general of the Whole Order of Friars Minor” was subsequently disputed, the Sacred Congregation of Rules solemnly confirmed that right in 1631 ; and in the following century (1728) Pope Benedict XIII imposed perpetual silence on all contestants of the same right. Here it is well to bear in mind that the Conventuals are not less observant of the obligations which they contract by their religious profession, since they vow only to observe the mitigated rule. In 1628, Pope Urban VIII again sanc- tioned their departure from the rule, especially in regard to poverty, and it is according to this papal decree, “juxta Constitutiones Urbanas, that the Con- ventuals profess the Franciscan rule. Moreover, as Fr. Cuthbert, O. S. F. C., pertinently remarks: “It must be remembered that it is not the office of the Church to coerce men to live according to the highest ideals ; she could not do so if she wished. The Church is meant to help men along the road of life. She fosters the highest ideals, but at the same time maintains lesser ideals for those who are not strong enough to strive for the highest.” The Observants, however, not only formed the great majority of Friars at the division of the order in 1517, numbering 30,000 religious with some 1,300 friaries ; they also constituted the main body of the order ever after. In other words, from the year 1517, the Friars who observed the rule without dispensa- tions always exceeded in number those who observed it with dispensations. Thus in 1768, when the order reached its greatest extent in membership, the Observants alone, including the reform parties within their ranks, which will be mentioned presently, counted some 77,000 friars in 167 provinces. In general, too, the Observants, remaining steadfast in the observance of the unmitigated rule of the Friars Minor, continued loyal to the essential Franciscan 11 ideal. But, as in the earlier years of the order’s existence, there were friars who clung to the practices of St. Francis and his first companions, so also now there arose various so-called reforms within the pale of the Regular Observance, all striving to draw nearer to the exalted ideal of St. Francis, and some even exceeding, if not the rigor of St. Francis’ life, at least his intentions. In the inception of the order, St. Francis had made special provision for so- called hermitages, to which the brethren could occasionally retire for the purpose of gaining renewed spiritual vigor; they were in accordance with the Franciscan life and ideal which combines the contemplative with the active life. In later years the hermitages were replaced by “houses of recollection,” which have always existed in the order and also today are to be found among Franciscan friaries. To these houses the Friars may withdraw to devote themselves to prayer and penance and spiritual recollection. And it was from such nurseries of spiritual renewal that all the reforms of the Observants came forth. All of these reformed branches, however, except that of the Capuchins, re- mained united in the one family of the Observants; only they were called “Friars Minor of the Stricter Observance.” The leading reforms of the Ob- servants were the following: (1) The “Discalced Friars” in Spain and Portugal. They existed already before 1517, as has been stated above, and shortly after that year they again revived. Fr. John Zummaraga, the first bishop of Mexico (1528-48), as well as many other missionary friars to the New World belonged to this reform. St. Peter of Alcantara (died 1562) was one of their leaders; but in prohibiting sandals, meat and libraries, he prescribed austerities far exceeding the intentions of St. Francis. From his is derived the name of “Alcantarines,” often given to the Discalced. (2) The “Reformati,” especially strong in Italy, whence they spread to other countries. They began in 1532, and in the beginning also far exceeded the rule of St. Francis in their penitential exercises. St. Leonard of Port Maurice should not be reckoned among the Reformati; he belonged rather to the so-called “Riformella,” introduced into the Roman province of the Observants by Bl. Bonaventure of Barcelona, 1662. To the Reformati belonged the Province of St. Leopold in Tyrol, which founded the Cincinnati province in the United States. (3) The “Recollects” or “Recollets” of France. This reform commenced about 1570. Among its provinces was the very important one of St. Denis, which sent missioners to Mozambique, and to New France (Canada) in North America. Writers at times refer indeed to these zealous apostles as “Recollects,” but apparently without knowing that they are Franciscan Friars. 12 (4) The “Recollects” of Germany, Belgium, Holland, England and Ireland. They began in 1621, and had nothing in common with the French Recollects. From their ranks came to the United States many pioneer friars who established the provinces of New York, of St. Louis, and through the latter, of California. The latter two branched off from the Saxon province of the Holy Cross, while the former was founded by the Thuringian province of St. Elizabeth. (5) The “Capuchins,” the only one of the reforms which separated from the Observants. It was started in the Italian province of the Marches by Fr. Matthew of Bassi in 1525. In beginning his reform he had no intention of leaving the ranks of the Observants ; but, owing to the opposition of his superiors, Clement VII (1528), released the friars of the new reform from obedience to the Observants and made them dependent on the master general of the Con- ventuals, to whom it belonged to confirm the vicar general elected by the Capuchins. In 1619 they were freed also from this dependence and allowed to elect their own minister general. Thus they were constituted the third dis- tinct and autonomous branch of the First Order of St. Francis. That they are true sons of St. Francis and not merely an offshoot of the Franciscan order, Rome declared as early as 1608 and again in 1627. Meantime the Franciscan privilege of common and not merely individual poverty had well-nigh been revoked again. At the Council of Trent (1545-63) it had been resolved that all religious should possess property in common. Then it was that Fr. Francis Zamora, minister general of the Observants (1559- 65), and the Capuchin, Fr. Bernardine of Asti, by their eloquent pleading saved from extinction the essential character of the Franciscan order. The Observ- ants and the Capuchins were expressly exempted from the general law and allowed to retain the privilege of corporate as well as individual poverty. Thus for the third time the ideal of Franciscan poverty passed unscathed through the danger of extinction, the two previous occasions having been the Fourth Lateran Council (1215) during St. Francis’ lifetime and the ruling of John XXII in 1322. It may be added here, that the two above mentioned champions of Franciscan poverty were not the only friars at the Council of Trent. In fact this Council is especially conspicuous for the great number of friars who took an active part in its deliberations. There were as many as eighty-five of them : two Cardi- nals, five bishops, and seventy-eight eminent theologians (Franciscans, i. e. Observants, Capuchins, and Conventuals). We have seen how the Observants came to be divided into several branches of reform, and that all of these except the Capuchins remained united under the Minister General of the whole Order of Friars Minor. These reforms dealt for the most part only with externals, such as outward exercises of piety and 13 austerities of life. Gradually these regulations, being over and above the Fran- ciscan rule, were in many cases recast and mitigated; and by the end of the nineteenth century, they had even disappeared entirely, nothing remaining of that which had been proper to the reforms but the name. The time was ripe, therefore, for a more perfect union of the various branches within the ranks of the Observants. In 1880, the minister general, Fr. Bernardine del Vago of Portugruaro, one of the Reformati, founded an official organ for the whole Order of Friars Minor (Observants), the Acta Or dims Fratrum Minorum, which doubtlessly contributed much toward a more perfect union of its reformed branches, Otherwise too this general did much to raise the status of the order, which had been greatly weakened by the numerous revolutions, secularizations and suppres- sions in the latter part of the eighteenth and the greater part of the nineteenth centuries. These political upheavals and interferences had in fact reduced the order to such an extent, that in the second last decade of the nineteenth century, its membership was at its lowest ebb, the Observants (including the reforms) num- bering 14,440 members at the time of the general chapter in 1889. In the same year the general, Fr. Bernardine del Vago, retired. Since his time the increase in members has been steady. His successor, Fr. Aloysius Canali of Parma (1889-97), at the general chap- ter in 1895, prepared the way for a complete union of the reform branches of the Observants. Under the presidency of Fr. Aloysius Lauer, were framed the constitutions on which the reunion was to be based, and on May 15, 1897, these constitutions were approved. On the resignation of Fr. Aloysius Canali in the same year, Pope Leo XIII appointed Fr. Aloysius Lauer general, and completed the union by the Bull Felicitate quadam of October 4, 1897. This document removed every distinc- tion between the reform branches, even the difference of name. Already in 1517 Pope Leo X had given to the Friars who observed the rule without dispensations, the Observants, the name “Order of Friars Minor” with the optional addition “of the Regular Observance,” besides precedence over the Conventuals. In 1897, however, Pope Leo XIII, while confirming the precedence accorded by Leo X, gave to the reunited and undivided Observants, as they had continued to be called, the unmodified name “Order of Friars Minor” only. Thereupon, popularly they righly came to be called simply “Franciscans.” Hence the Observants were the same as Friars Minor or Franciscans, and it is not only lawful, but also desirable and proper, as avoiding much confusion, that historical writers give the name “Friars Minor” or “Franciscans” as also the initials “O. F. M.” not merely to the Franciscans who have lived after 1897 , 14 but also to all the Observants, including their reform branches, before that date as far back as 1517, — and during the first period, that of the undivided order, at least to all Friars who remained loyal to the Franciscan Rule and to the Church. For, from the. beginning, “Order of Friars Minor” was the official and proper name of the Franciscan order, having been given to it by St. Francis himself. The reunion in 1897 affected only the Observants, i. e., the Franciscans ; it did not touch the Capuchins and Conventuals. Hence there are to-day the three mutually independent branches of the First Order of St. Francis: Franciscans, Capuchins, Conventuals. While the latter branch observes the Franciscan rule with certain lawfully accorded dispensations from its substantial observance especially in regard to poverty, the two former branches, the Franciscans and Capuchins, observe the rule without dispensations, differing only in accidentals which are contained in the general constitutions proper to each. Respectively these general constitutions insure a uniform observance of the rule. Containing, as it does, perhaps precepts which admit of various interpre- tations, the rule was itself one of the causes why even those brethren who sought to observe it strictly did so in different ways and were divided into differ- ent parties or families, notably the reforms within the ranks of the Observants as also the Capuchin reform, each having its own statutes. With the reunion of the former, their particular statutes were abrogated, and the general constitutions of the Friars Minor were laid down as guiding principles to safeguard a uniform literal observance of the rule by all Franciscans. After this reunion, the new minister general, Fr. Aloysius Lauer, gradu- ally but firmly introduced the principles of the union. When he died, 1901, Fr. David Fleming governed the order as vicar general until the next general chapter, 1903, when Fr. Denis Schuler, who had been laboring in the United States since 1875, was chosen minister general. Not only did Fr. Denis Schuler complete and cement the established union, but he also prepared the way for a general reunion of the Spanish Franciscans, who had broken away from the central government of the order in the first part of the nineteenth century. Already in 1804 they had separated from the main body of the order, although a semblance of unity remained, and in 1832 the formal separation had been completed. But in 1909 the Order of Friars Minor celebrated the seventh centenary of its foundation as one undivided organization, excepting of course the Capuchins and Conventuals. The present “Minister General of the whole Order of Friars Minor”, i. e., of the Franciscans, is the Most Rev. Fr. Bernardine Klumper, O. F, M. Without doubt the internal history of the First Order of St. Francis is one of true development; it is a continual striving after an exalted ideal. True, there were times, when sections of the order fell below the perfection it should 15 Most Rev. Fr. Bernardine Klumper, 0. F. M., Minister General of the Order of Friars Minor, Rome. have possessed; and not all who called themselves Friars Minor have been deserving of that name. But in this the Franciscan order is not unlike other human institutions; the more supernatural and sublime the ideals, the ruder is their collision with reality, and the more allowance must be made for human frailty, especially in such a great multitude of men as comprised the Franciscan order. Still, far from showing that the order as such was badly in need of renovation, the various so-called reforms show rather that there was an ever recurring endeavor to reproduce the original type of St. Francis and his first companions. “Circumstances constantly forced them again to modify, to change, to enlarge their external activities, and here and there to encroach upon the individual liberty found in the early days. But changes of this sort in external organizations are to be expected in any society which lives on from age to age. So says Fr. Cuthbert. II. External History: Activity If we have treated the internal history of the Order at length, the reason lies in the fact that it not only is less well known and contains points needing explana- tion, but also has a more direct bearing on St. Francis, the founder. But we must not forget that the order has also a most glorious history of extended activities. If we may judge a tree by its fruits, then surely the Franciscan tree has been especially favored by God. At the sight of these fruits, the misunderstandings and disloyalties we meet in its development pale into insignificance. The activity of the Franciscan Friars has been nothing short of marvelous; and in a brief sketch like the present, it is impossible to give an adequate picture of their seven hundred years of labors and achievements for God and the souls of men. In his Glories of the Franciscan Order Fr. Francis Steck, O. F. M., narrates this glorious story as compendiously as possible, yet he must devote some fifty pages to the subject. Here we can only indicate some of the outstanding facts of this long and eventful history. The aim and rule of the Friars Minor being the imitation of the life and activity of Christ and his Apostles, as portrayed by the Gospel, the Friars devoted themselves not to their own sanctification alone, but labored as well for the welfare and spread of the Church and for the well-being of human kind. Their achievements were as diverted as the needs and opportunities for such services. Father Cuthbert goes so far as to declare that “the history of the Franciscan Friars during the first two centuries and more of their existence is emphatically the history of Christendom. There was no movement of vital interest during that period in which they had no part. Theology, politics, art, and the social conditions of the people — all in some measure were touched by their influence.” 17 Even wider is the statement of Fr. Ubald d’ Alencon, O. M. Cap., who writes : “With the Jesuit Father Orlando I can say that for seven centuries nothing of consequence has taken place in the Church that did not originate with the Fran- ciscans or did not come under their influence.” Another remarkable tribute to the Friars is that of Gregorovius in his History of Rome (Book IX, Chap. 3). “The mendicant brothers,” he writes, “influenced every stratum of society.” Then he enumerates, as their fields of labor the confessional, the pulpit, the universities, the college of cardinals, the throne of the pope, the homes of the people, the courts of kings, the halls of the Lateran, the parliaments of republics, and concludes with the words : “They saw and heard everything.” The far-flung activity of the Franciscans, Fr. Francis Steck, O. F. M., has compressed into the following glowing but truthful passage : “It is not failing against historical truth to say that ever since the founding of his order the all embracing spirit of St. Francis has literally ruled the world. There is no field of humanity activity that the Franciscans have not cultivated. In the council chambers of Church and State; in the lecture-halls and laboratories of univer- sities ; on the gory fields of battle ; in the hovels of the destitute and forsaken ; in the perilous regions of schism, heresy, idolatry and barbarism; in hospitals, everywhere have they exerted their wholesome influence and inscribed their names on the scrolls of glory as benefactors of human kind.” Even Renan, the French rationalist, confessed that “next to Christianity, the activity of the Franciscans has engendered the greatest popular movement that history knows.” This widespread influence and activity of the Friars will be evident if we glance at the more important fields in which they toiled. In the realm of learning we find that there is hardly a branch in which the Franciscan order is not represented by eminent names. To mention but a few, there are the great scholas- tics, Alexander of Hales (d. 1245), the Invincible Doctor; St. Bonaventure (d. 1274), the Seraphic Doctor; and John Duns Scotus (d. 1308), the Subtle Doctor and Doctor of Mary Immaculate. Of Duns Scotus, who has been much misunderstood and misrepresented, St. Alphonse Liguori declares that his authority must be preferred to that of St. Thomas and St. Bonaventure. Haureau, a modern writer, considers it a grave injustice of our age that Scotus is denied the homage he so rightly deserves. In Kir chliches Hand-lexikon (I, p. 1526) Fr. Leonard Lemmens, O. F. M., briefly shows that Scotus had numerous noted disciples among his confreres in sub- sequent times. Here we may well call attention also to the excellent historical sketches in the Reports of the Annual Meetings of the Franciscan Educational Conference : 18 Franciscan Dogmatists, by Fr. Alphonse Coan, O. F. M., 1922, p. 105 ; Franciscan Biblical Scholars by Fr. Bernard Cuneo, O. F. M., 1925, p. 30. They reveal how vast has been the activity of the Friars in these branches of theology. In natural science the most prominent Franciscan is Fr. Roger Bacon (d. 1294), the Marvelous Doctor. Humboldt, the scientist, calls him the greatest and most important figure in the natural sciences during the Middle Ages. Fr. John M. Lenhart, O. M. Cap., has an enlightening historical sketch on Science in the Franciscan Order in the Report of the Conference mentioned above for 1923, p. 49; he likewise ably delineates the history of Language Studies in the Fran- ciscan Order, in the same publication, 1924, p. 35. Many Friars have distinguished themselves also in the fine arts, St. Francis himself, as composer of the Canticle of Brother Sun, making “the beginnings of that Italian speech which Dante Alighieri moulded into such perfect melody.” Deserving of special mention is the author of the Stabat Mater, Fr. Jacopone of Todi (d. 1306), in whom the folksong of Italy reached its zenith. The influence of the Franciscans on the Liturgy and the devotions of the Catholic Church has been so great that Fr. Maurus Ricci, a distinguished Piarist, designates as distinctly Franciscan either in origin or in spirit “all the pious practices that have taken root in the Church since the thirteenth cen- tury.” Thus the Christmas Crib was introduced by St. Francis himself and popularized by the Friars. It is well known that the devotion of the “Stations of the Cross” is characteristically Franciscan ; it was spread especially by the celebrated preacher, St. Leonard of Port Maurice, O. F. M. Franciscans too were the most zealous defenders of the Immaculate Concep- tion. The champion of this prerogative of the Blessed Mother of God, John Duns Scotus, was succeeded by six thousand Franciscans who followed in his footsteps. Pohle declares : “Had the Subtle Doctor and his school gained no other merit for the cause of the Faith than the successful vindication and demonstration of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception, this one distinction alone would suffice to secure him a place of honor in history and in the plan of Divine Providence.” Likewise have the Franciscans taken a prominent part in fostering the de- votions to St. Joseph, to the Sacred Heart, to the Holy Name, to the Blessed Eucharist. Regarding the latter be it added only, that Pope Leo XIII (1897) proclaimed \"St. Paschal Baylon, a Franciscan lay brother, Patron of all Euchar- istic Societies and Congresses. As preachers the Franciscan Friars have been known and loved at all times. Thode rightly calls preaching a particular profession of theirs. “The people,” he adds, “desired preachers of their own, they wanted strict, yet gentle teachers of morals — the Franciscans have given the people all they longed for. Hence 19 their unexampled influence.” To bear out this assertion we need only mention the great popular missionaries, Fr. Berthold of Regensburg (d. 1272), Saints Bernardine of Siena and John Capistran to whom we have already referred as leaders of the Friars Observant, and finally St. Leonard of Port Maurice, in recent years declared by the Church the patron of home missionaries through- out the world. The social activity of the Franciscans, if we may believe Heimbucher, the author of an authoritative work on the religious orders and congregations of the Catholic Church, has been unparalleled. “The work of the Franciscans,” he writes, “embraced the whole popular life, changing and renewing all things. The Franciscan order has been essentially a social order, which left the impress of its origin on all creations. If the monasteries (monks) had formerly sought out secluded places, the mendicants (friars) chose the cities. Here the Francis- cans developed a comprehensive social activity, which has no parallel in the world’s history.” By their very lives, the Friars taught the people once more to regard poverty and labor and submission as something honorable. During the Black Death (1346-49), some twenty thousand friars, the third part of the order, perished as martyrs of charity. According to Holzapfel, even two-thirds of the Friars are said to have lost their lives during this dreadful plague. Indiscriminate re- ception of new members into the thinned ranks— to recur once more to the order1 s internal history — was one of the main causes of the relaxation that en- sued ; and thus the Black Death occasioned not only heroic self-sacrifice, but also a temporary dimming of the Franciscan ideal within the order. Famous too, are the “Montes Pietatis” which the Friars founded and promoted in the fifteenth century. “These were charitable loan institutions, like our modern banks, designed to protect the poor against the usury of the money lenders.” The brightest pages, however, in the story of Franciscan activity are those which tell of their missionary labors in pagan countries. So extensive and in- tensive has been and still is this work of the Franciscan order, that the noted Jesuit statistician, Father Arens, does not hesitate to say, that “the Order of St. Francis is the greatest missionary order in the Catholic Church.” That such is the case, was evident to visitors at the Vatican Missionary Exposition of 1925 ; for many it was a surprise and revelation. St. Francis was himself a missionary, and as such gave his brethren a leader’s example. He is rightly styled the inaugurator of all extra-European missions of the Middle Ages. He sent the first missionaries of his order to southern Spain, Morocco and Tunis, Egypt, Palestine and Syria. He himself made re- peated attempts to enter the territory of the Saracens, and finally preached before the very Sultan of Egypt. He founded the “Pearl of Franciscan Missions,” the mission of the Holy Land, of which Father Considine of Maryknoll recently wrote these words : \"Every body of men and women in the Church has some special glory. The Franciscans have many, but one of their grandest through the centuries has been their custody of the Holy Land.” (The Vatican Exposi- tion, p. 40.) Throughout the past seven hundred years, thousands of the disciples of St. Francis have followed in the footsteps of their missionary leader, not only in the Holy Land, and among the Mussulmans, but among all the heathen nations of the earth. “The history of the order,” writes Fr. Lem- mens, \"contains not a single period during which missionaries were lacking.” Sixty years after the founding of the Franciscan order, we find the Friars in well-nigh all parts of the then known world. In the fifteenth century Francis- can missions extended from Lapland to the Congo and from the Azores to China. And when towards the close of the Middle Ages, the Portuguese rounded the Cape of Good Hope, Franciscans followed in their wake, estab- lishing missions along the coasts of Africa. When Columbus discovers the Mew World, Franciscans immediately appear on the scene as soldiers of Christ, and continue to take a leading part in spreading the Faith throughout America— Central, South and North. In South America, the great St. Francis Solano becomes the “Wonder-Worker of the West.” He is only one of the numerous Franciscan apostles of America.. The labors of Franciscan mis- sionaries within the present confines of the United States will be treated separately. In fact, for many centuries, namely, before the founding of the Society of Jesus (1534), the burden of missionary work rested for the most part on the shoulders of the two mendicant orders, Franciscans and Dominicans, and of these the Franciscans are known to have borne the heavier burden. When the sons of St. Ignatius came, they did not displace the Franciscans; they rather swelled the ranks of the army of Christ. In Franziskanische Studien * (Oct., 1925, pp. 243-44), Fr. Lemmens proves that at that time, contrary to the assertion of Fr. Brucker, S. J., the Franciscan outnumbered the Jesuit missioners. And when the Jesuits were suppressed in 1773, the Franciscans in many places \"doubled and tripled themselves,” as Fr. Robert Streit, O. M. I., expresses it, “in order to fill out the gaps that ensued, and to gain new ground for missionary work.” In modern times numerous missionary societies have been founded, and they have given a happy stimulus to mission work. But the Franciscans none the less continue their eminent work in a manner worthy of their glorious past. “The seraphic order of St. Francis, taken alone,” writes Fr. Arens, S. J. (Handbuch der katholischen Missionen, p. 30), “at the present day numbers more missionary priests than all mis- sionary societies founded in modern times taken together. “Should one attempt to write a detailed account of the Franciscan missions, 21 a voluminous history of martyrs would of itself result, even if such would not be the avowed object.” Thus wrote Fr. Erhard Schlund, O. F. M., in 1919, on the occasion of the completion of seven hundred years of Franciscan mission activity. At the Vatican Exposition his statement has been verified by a manuscript martyrology, richly illuminated, which lists the names of more than a thousand Franciscans who have crowned their apostolate among the heathens with the sacrifice of their life-blood, though they have not as yet received ecclesiastical honors. “This martyrology,” writes Fr. Lemmens, “enables us to make mention also of those missions of which naught has been recorded but the martyrdom of some brethren.” Henrion describes the family of St. Francis as “lavish with its blood.” In the lands of the Far East as well as in the countries of the New World, the protomartyrs were as a rule Franciscan missionary friars. The first mar- tyrs of China were the Franciscan bishop, Fr. Richard of Burgundy, and five confreres, besides a Franciscan Tertiary and a Genoese merchant, who were all beheaded because of their steadfastness in the Faith (1339) at Almalek, near the present Kuldja or Ili in the western province of Sin-kiang or Chinese Turkestan. As the protomartyrs of Japan those of 1597 are usually desig- nated, though there were a few isolated cases of martyrdom of native Christians during the four previous decades. The Japanese martyrs of 1597 were twenty-six in number, of whom six were Franciscans, three Jesuits, seventeen native Christians, the latter Franciscan Tertiaries; they were all crucified at Nagasaki. The leader of this heroic band was the Franciscan, St. Peter Baptist, who had served also as ambassador of the Spanish gov- ernor of the Philippines to Taicosama, the mikado of Japan. In the New World, the Franciscans could point to three martyrs for the Faith as early as 1516; they were Fr. Fernando Salzedo, Fr. Diego Botello, and an unnamed lay brother, who were devoured by the cannibal Caribs. In New France (Canada) the first martyr was Fr. Nicholas Viel, O. F. M. (1625), whom the city of Montreal has honored with a monument. The protomartyr of the territory now comprising the United States was the Fran- ciscan, Fr. John de Padilla, who was killed by the Indians, 1542, in what is now the state of Kansas. The fact that the protomartyrs in the newly opened countries of the East and the West were Franciscans, implies that they were also among the first, if not the first, missionaries in these regions. And so they were. The first European to penetrate into the Far East was a disciple of St. Francis himself, Fr. John of Pian di Carpine. In 1245 he set out on his eventful journey which took him all the way to the court of the Great Khan at Karakorum in central Mongolia. In 1253 another Franciscan was at the same court. It 22 was Fr. William Rubruk, whose journal has been called by the noted geog- rapher Peschel “the greatest geographical masterpiece of the Middle Ages.” The story of how Fr. John Perez, the guardian of the Franciscan friary of La Rabida, aided Columbus in the discovery of the New World has often been retold. And if Fr. Bernardine Monticastri, O. F. M., was not the con- fessor of Columbus on his first voyage (Fr. Holzapfel gainsays it), certainly on his second voyage Columbus was accompanied by the two Belgian Fran- ciscan lay brothers, John Deladeuille (de la Duela, also called Borgonon, or il Bermejo) and John Cosin (Tisim), as we learn from Glassberger, a con- temporary Franciscan chronicler, and most probably also by Fr. John Perez and Fr. Anthony de Marchena, who have been wrongly identified by many writers. These pioneers were followed by many others. In fact, during the first decades after the discovery of America by far the greatest number of missioners who brought the glad Gospel tidings to its natives were Francis- cans. In 1526, Emperor Charles V sent as many as 120 Franciscans to America. Being the first missionaries, naturally the first bishops of the new countries opened to the Church have also for the most part been Franciscans. In China, the first prelate was Fr. John of Montecorvino, O. F. M., appointed archbishop of Peking (Cambaluc) and primate of the Far East in 1307. In fact, the first period of Catholic mission history in China is exclusively Franciscan. In 1542, when St. Francis Xavier came to India, he was welcomed by a Fran- ciscan, Fr. John Albuquerque, first bishop of Goa (1537-53). The first bishop on the American mainland was Fr. John de Quevedo, whose diocese, situate on the Gulf of Darien, was erected in 1514. “As here,” writes Fr. Holzapfel, “so also in numerous other dioceses of America, the Franciscans opened the series of bishops, for the simple reason that in so many places they were the first missioners.” Prominent among them was the first bishop of Mexico, Fr. John Zumarraga (1528-48), who labored with great success not only for the spiritual but also the temporal welfare of his people. Martyrs, the missionary heroes, — bishops, the missionary leaders, — and other prominent missioners — these captions may well be applied not only to the beginnings but also to the subsequent times of the story of Francis- can missions, and the result would be a highly interesting narrative. But that would lead us too far afield. Suffice it to say that within the first quarter of our own twentieth century, twenty-eight Franciscans, including four bishops, died a martyr’s death. Of the Franciscan bishops of the present, most are missionary bishops. At the Vatican Exposition was shown the composite picture of thirty-six Franciscan bishops and prefects apostolic now active in 24 mission lands as leaders of their confreres. The Franciscan missionaries of today (1926), who are 2,885 in number, are laboring among pagans the world over totaling upwards of a hundred million. In China alone, there are twelve districts (ten vicariates and two prefectures) in the care of about 300 Franciscan missionaries, aided by some 200 native secular priests, Tertiaries. The choicest fruits on the Franciscan tree, however, have been its fruits of holiness. Everywhere, in all the fields where they have toiled, and almost at all times, there have been friars who lived and died in the odor of sanctity. Of their number, forty-five have been canonized, while about ninety have been beatified by the Church. The official list of members of the three orders of St. Francis, whose cause of canonization or beatification was being carried on, contained in 1925 as many as 116 names. The glories of the Franciscan order, however, are not glories for itself; they are glories for God. Whatever the Franciscans have accomplished, they have done with the help of God and for the greater honor of God. We can not conclude this sketch in a more fitting way than by repeating the ex- uberant words which the humble St. Francis put into the first rule he wrote for his Lesser Brethren — we give them as translated by A. G. Ferrers Howell, LL. M., of Cambridge : “Let us ascribe all good things to God most high and supreme, and acknowledge them to be his, and give thanks for them all to him from whom all good proceeds ; and let him, the most high and supreme and only true God, have, and have rendered to him, and receive all honor, reverence, praise, blessing, thanks, and glory, whose is all good, and who alone is good.” Fr. Marian Habig, O. F. M., St. Louis, Mo. BIBLIOGRAPHY The principal works consulted are: Catholic Encyclopedia (1908-12), passim, especially: Friars Minor, by Fr. Michael Bihl, O. F.

That the project of Christopher Columbus materialized at all is owing in greatest part to the learning and foresight of Fr. Juan Perez, then guardian of the Franciscan friary at La Rabida, and Fr. Antonio Mar- chena. The latter was deeply interested and well versed in cosmography; while it was especially the former who had previously been the confessor of Queen Isabella and now not only encouraged the penniless, friendless and spiritless navigator but also used his influence with the queen in gaining her whole-hearted support for the hazardous and generally ridiculed enterprise. How zealously, in the course of the next century, the Franciscans set out to evangelize the new territories, we see from the fact that by 1587, their con- vents in the Antilles, in Mexico, and in Central and South America numbered about 200, organized into eleven independent provinces of the Order. With two of his brethren, Fr. Juan Perez accompanied Columbus on his second voyage. At Port Conception on the Island of Hayti a chapel was built and here on December 8, 1493, he offered up holy Mass for the first time in the New World. Similarly, the first convent was that of the Franciscans erected by Columbus in what is now the city of Santo Domingo. During the course of the next 26 years, some 50 Franciscans evangelized Hayti, Cuba, Santo Domingo and Porto Rico. Their convents had increased to such an extent that already in 1505 they were organized into an independent pro- vince under the protection of the Holy Cross. In 1512, Fr. Garcia de Padilla was consecrated bishop for the newly-erected diocese of Santo Domingo, thereby becoming the first bishop in the new world. Two years later an- other Franciscan, Fr. Juan de Quevedo, arrived on the mainland as the first bishop of Darien in Central America. In 1516, three Franciscans suffered a violent death at the hands of the Indians. Mexico The first to begin missionary work among the Mexicans, in 1523, were Flemish Franciscans. Among them was the celebrated Fr. Peter of Ghent (d. 1562), who labored forty years among the natives with marvelous success. The next year, in May, twelve more Franciscans, known as the Twelve Apos- tles, arrived in Mexico. In the following July, Fr. Martin de Valencia, as vicar-apostolic, convoked the first ecclesiastical council and organized the first Franciscan custody under the title of the Holy Gospel. After three years, a diocese was created and Fr. Juan de Zumarraga, a Franciscan, ap- pointed its first bishop. That same year, the general chapter of the Order raised the custody of Mexico, which then numbered 70 convents, to the rank 29 of a province. Bishop Zumarraga set up the first printing press in the New World. Many important works in more than twelve languages were subse- quently published by the friars and distributed among the Indians. A strik- ing feature of early Franciscan activity in Mexico was the zeal with which the friars devoted themselves to the education of the children, despite the con- stant opposition of the Spanish government officials. Almost every convent had its adjoining school where thousands of boys were taught reading, writ- ing and singing. It was mainly through Franciscan influence that a school for girls was erected in the city of Mexico, and placed in charge of women who came over from Spain and organized a sort of Sisterhood for the educa- tion of Indian girls. With the extensions of the Spanish dominion, south- ward and westward, the Franciscans erected and conducted the several apos- tolic colleges that must be considered nurseries of mission activity in what today comprises the southern border states of our country. Peninsula of Lower California Franciscan missionaries from Mexico accompanied Cortes, in 1535, and thus were the first to set foot on what is now Lower California. Though they immediately undertook to evangelize the natives, permanent missions could not be established. Sixty years later, the friars accompanied Sebastian Vis- caino to the peninsula and founded a Christian colony at La Paz. After two months, however, hostilities broke out between the Indians and the Spanish soldiery, whereupon Viscaino gave orders to abandon the territory. Yucatan, Central and South America In the meantime, Franciscans from Mexico, the Antilles and Spain con- ducted flourishing missions in Yucatan, in the states of Central and South America and on the Isthmus of Panama. Before the end of the 16th century, their missions in Colombia numbered about 200,000 Christians. Their activ- ity among the wild tribes of Venezuela, begun in 1528, was sadly hampered at first by German mercenaries and later by Dutch Calvinists. From Colom- bia the Franciscans penetrated southward into the vast empire of the Incas, embracing what is now Ecuador, Peru, Western Bolivia and Northern Chile. Likewise during the 16th century, they traversed the Amazon regions as far east as Pernambuco in Brazil and as far south as Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay. It was above all in these parts that the heroic friars were often compelled to champion the rights of their neophytes against the greed and cruelty of lawless freebooters. Among the most flourishing missions were those of Ecuador, where as early as 1565 a Franciscan province was erected. At the end of the 18th century, there were still twenty Indian villages in charge of the Franciscans. Peru with its many convents and missions and 30 two apostolic colleges became the center of Franciscan activity in the track- less regions to the east and south. In 1610, St. Francis Solano, the Apostle of South America, was appointed the first guardian of the Franciscan house of recollection established in Lima, Peru. During the 17th and 18th centur- ies, a large number of friars suffered martyrdom in the missions on the Ucayali and in the territory north of the Amazon. In the former alone, the Order counts 129 martyrs, not including the lay-brothers and such as set out for the wilderness and were never heard of again. Most of these missions were destroyed during the Indian rising in , 1742. About fifty years later, however, the Franciscans began the work of restoration and soon the mis- sions, especially on the Ucayali, were again in a flourishing condition. The first to evangelize Chile were likewise Franciscans. What they suf- fered here from 1553 till about 1750 during the repeated outbreaks of hos- tility between the Indians and the Spanish settlers fills one of the saddest pages of Franciscan mission history. In 1832, after Chile had established its independence, the friars were finally permitted to resume their labors among the natives. More peaceful and prosperous was their activity in the southern part of Chile and in Bolivia, where they had missions and in the course of time seven so-called missionary colleges. From the 16th to the 19th century the Franciscans were practically the only missionaries who labored among the Indians of Bolivia with success. In Argentine, St. Francis Solano spent 14 years instructing and baptizing the natives. In fact, the cities and states :>f South America hold his memory so sacred that they have chosen him their patron. As early as 1538 the Franciscans were in southern Brazil, whence they soon after penetrated into Paraguay, and about a century later, into Uruguay. Of their activity in northeastern Brazil at this time little is known beyond the fact that very many friars fell victims to their dauntless mission- ary zeal in these parts. North America A largely unwritten chapter of the history of the Catholic Church in the United States is the story of what the Franciscans undertook and achieved for the Indians during the period of exploration and colonization. The vast stretches that Dr. Bolton so ably terms “The Spanish Border- lands” were almost exclusively the domain of Franciscan missionary activity; while the story of their labors along our northern border and in Canada is still waiting for someone to relate in English as writers, like Fr. Odoric Jauve, have related in French. Another unwritten and therefore unknown chapter of U. S. Catholic history is that of the Franciscans in Maryland and Penn- sylvania, to say nothing of the Ohio and Illinois country and of the central trans-Mississippi regions. 31 Every City on This Map Denotes a Franciscan Foundation. Florida It is not known whether Franciscans were among the priests and religious who, in 1521, accompanied Ponce de Leon in his second voyage to Florida. Certain it is, however, that in 1528, four Franciscans formed part of the expe- dition of Panfilo de Narvarez. The friars came with the intention of estab- lishing missions, as is evident from the fact that their leader, Fr. Juan Zp,arez, had already been appointed bishop for the eventual missions. Hence it is just to say that the first bishop of what is now the United States, was a Franciscan, although he perished with his companions before a permanent mission could be established. In 1577, another band of Franciscans arrived and erected missions all along the gulf coast. They gradually penetrated westward as far as the Mississippi and northward as far as Georgia. During an Indian rising in 1597, several friars suffered martyrdom. In 1612, a prov- ince of the Order was erected, which in 1634 comprised 34 friars in charge of about 30,000 Catholic natives in 44 missions. They toiled successfully till the latter part of the 18th century, when Florida was ceded to England. The old Franciscan friary at St. Augustine is now a barracks. Texas We now come to what is termed the “New Kingdom of St. Francis, the vast territories that form the present states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. It was especially through the heroic efforts of Fr. Damian Mazanet, O. F. M., that, in 1689, the first permanent missions were founded in what is now the State of Texas. The friars found the Indians well dis- posed and during the 18th century not less than 21 missions were founded and thousands of Indians baptized. To judge from the mission ruins that may still be seen, the labors of the 160 Franciscans among the Texas Indians must have borne abundant fruit. All was destroyed, however, when in the early part of the 19th century Mexico gained her independence. New Mexico and Arizona The vast territory of New Mexico and Arizona was visited by white men for the first time in 1539. It was Fr. Marcos de Niza who in that year, at the instance of Viceroy Mendoza of Mexico, penetrated into those unknown re- gions. Three years later, one of his companions, Fr. Juan de Padilla, suffered death for the faith, thus becoming the proto-martyr of the 105 missionaries (73 Franciscans, 24 Jesuits, 4 Dominicans, 3 Secular Priests, 1 Sulpician), who died for the faith within the present limits of the United States. Permanent missions,' however, were not founded till 1598. Thirty years later, there were already 43 churches with about 30,000 Catholic Indians. For the next 200 years, the Franciscans were the only missionaries in these parts. From New 33 Mexico, the friars penetrated into Arizona, where they likewise labored with great success. It is estimated that between the years 1539 and 1850, about 300 Franciscans preached the Gospel in New Mexico and Arizona. California The present State of California remained practically unexplored till the latter part of the 18th century. In 1769, Fr. Junipero Serra with three other Franciscans, erected at San Diego the first permanent mission, which in the course of time was followed by 20 more, extending as far north as San Fran- cisco. What the 144 friars who labored in California between 1769 and 1854 achieved for the spiritual and temporal welfare of the 80,000 converted Indians fills one of the brightest pages of Franciscan mission history. Fr. Magin Catala, who spent more than 30 years in the Santa Clara Mission, is now on the official list for eventual beatification. How the neophytes clung to the kind and disinterested friars was seen in 1833, when the bond of affection was severed, which upwards of half a century had proved a source of inesti- mable blessing for the fickle, carefree and inexperienced aborigines. After the suppression of the missions, some of the friars remained with their charges and nobly shared their want and distress, while others with a heavy heart bade farewell to the scenes of their labors. Thirteen English Colonies As English settlers through religious bigotry had ruined the Franciscan missions in Florida, so, too, did they from the start prevent the friars from evangelizing the Indians living in the Thirteen Colonies. Between 1672 and 1699, however, a number of friars of the second English province were re- quested by the Jesuits to come to their aid in the Maryland missions. Others are known to have come to New York, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and even as far as Michigan, Minnesota and Illinois. But nowhere did they succeed in founding permanent missions, except in Detroit, where they continued for some time. Here, in 1706, Fr. Constantine Dehalle was killed during an Indian rising, while in 1681, Fr. Gabriel de la Ribaude was martyred by Indians on the banks of the Illinois River, somewhere near Joliet, Illinois. Toward the end of the 18th century, an Irish Franciscan, Fr. Michael Egan, was active in Philadelphia and in 1810 became its first bishop. Canada In the interior of Canada, or New France, as it was then called, the first pioneers of the faith were likewise Franciscans. Four French friars arrived in Quebec in 1615 and for the next ten years were the only missionaries among the Algonquins and Hurons along the St. Lawrence to the Great 34 Lakes. One of their number, Fr. Nicholas Viel, was the first to be mar- tyred for the faith in Canada. In 1629, the English put an end to the activity of the friars in those parts. But they continued to labor among the Abnaki Indians in Nova Scotia or Arcadia till the year 1633. About 1650, another band of Franciscans arrived in Canada. Among these was the celebrated Fr. Louis Hennepin, who passed the Niagara Falls and was the first to sail down the Mississippi from its source to its mouth, having previously discovered and named the Falls of St. Anthony. In 1726, Fr. Emanuel Crespel, appar- ently the last pioneer Franciscan in Canada, traveled as far as the Fox River in the present State of Wisconsin. ® 35 PROVINCE OF THE SACRED HEART OF JESUS History of the Province of the Sacred Heart of Jesus St. Louis, Missouri. “The kingdom of heaven is like to a mustard seed, which a man took and sowed in his field; which is the least indeed of all seeds; but when it grows up, it is greater than all herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air come and dwell in the branches thereof.” — (Mt. 13, 31-32). THE words of our Redeemer Jesus Christ which were prophetically uttered concerning the marvelous growth of His Church, may be fitting- ly applied to that Province of the Franciscan Order, which glories in the title of His Sacred Heart. Small, indeed, was the seed which in the year 1858, the Very Reverend Father Gregory Janknecht, Minister Provincial of the Province of the Holy Cross in Germany, planted in the vast undeveloped territory of North America. Fr. Gregory Janknecht was a man of keen in- tellect, of deep piety and ardent zeal for the salvation of souls. He is de- servedly styled the “Father” of the Province, and his memory will be blessed forever in the Seraphic Order. At the request of the Rt. Reverend Damian Juncker, D. D., Bishop of Alton, Illinois, Fr. Gregory sent the first missionaries to this Diocese in 1858. They were: Fathers Damian Hennewig, Capistran Zwinge and Servatius Altmicks; the Brothers: Irenaeus Drewes, Paschal Kutsche and Julius Schmaenk; and the Postulants: Edmund Wilde and Francis Uphoff. Making the journey in the religious habit of St. Francis, they left the convent of Warendorf on August 24, and after a long and tiresome journey, landed in New York on the 14th of September, the feast of the Holy Cross. The fol- lowing day they set out for Alton, which they reached on September 21. The Rt. Reverend Bishop at once assigned them Teutopolis, their first American mission. Full of zeal for the salvation of souls, the Fathers immediately entered upon their missionary labors which at that time were replete, with hard- ships. They conducted missions for the Catholics, not only at Teutopolis but also in many other towns, often at a considerable distance. These mis- sions proved most profitable to the people. In order to remove some of their difficulties accruing from the rule of the Order, the Minister Provincial obtained a dispensation from the Apostolic See for the American Friars to use civilian attire and money on their journeys through regions where it was deemed necessary. 39 Very Rev. Fr. Gregory Janknecht, Founder of Sacred Heart Province. iSt In 1859 more helpers were sent to this new vineyard of the Lord. They were : Fathers Heribert Hoffmans and Ferdinand Bergmeyer, the Subdeacons Bernardine Hermann, Maurice Klosterman, and Raynerius Dickneite, and Brother Honorius Dopp. When the parish church at Teutopolis had been completed, the Fathers forthwith constructed a residence for their own use. The number of Fathers continued increasing in the following year, so that they could establish missions and parishes, especially through the whole southern region of the State of Illinois. In addition to their parish at Teutopolis they were in charge of the following parishes: Green Creek (1858-1893), Effingham (1859- 1871), Altamont (1879-1893), Odin (1865-1870), St. Elmo (1860-1889)) Piopo- lis (1859-1870), Edgewood (1866-1879), Kinmundy (1866-1879), Lillyville (1877-1893), Neoga (1862-1888), Sigel (1866-1887), Pocahontas (1870-1878), Greenville (1870-1878), Pesotum (1876-1884), Shumway (1879-1888), Bishop Creek, Island Grove and Montrose; furthermore they often visited Marshall, Vandalia, Flora, Watson, Toni, Farina, Centralia and Salem. The first superior and pastor of the parish at Teutopolis was Fr. Damian Hennewig. His successor, Fr. Killian Schloesser, was also the first guardian of the con- vent (1862). The new and spacious monastery of today was erected partly in the years 1867 and 1868, partly in 1889, and was completed in 1904. The convent at Teutopolis has been from the beginning the novitiate of the province. In the year 1860, the Minister Provincial, Fr. Gregory Jan- knecht made his first canonical visitation of the American mission, opened the novitiate, received the first novices and appointed Fr. Killian Schloesser, master of novices. The first novice of the Order was Br. Edmund Wilde. At the request of the Rt. Reverend Bishop of Alton, the Fathers founded at Teutopolis a seminary under the patronage of St. Joseph, for the educa- tion of the diocesan clergy. The first Rector of the college was Fr. Heribert Hoffmans, he was succeeded by Fr. Maurice Klosterman. The latter re- mained the distinguished rector of this institution for many successive years (1864-1882). Through him and his successors, Fathers Michael Richardt and Hugolinus Storff (1893-1900, 1906-1912), new buildings were erected ; the college prospered; and the clergy, both secular and regular, were highly respected by reason of their thorough education. In the year 1898, with the consent of the Rt. Reverend Bishop of Alton, the seminary came under the exclusive control of the Order as a preparatory school for its aspirants. The second residence of our American Mission was founded in the city of Quincy, Illinqis in the year 1859, under the title of St. Francis Solano. Under the powerful protection of this Saint there were founded a flourish- ing parish, a convent, and also a college. The first superior and pastor was 41 Fr. Servatius Altmicks. The first guardian of the convent was Fr. Nazarius Kommerscheidt. In time a new and larger church together with a new monastery were constructed. Fr. Andrew Butzkueben was the first Guard- ian and Pastor (Pastor 1883-1909). The first Rector of the college was Fr. Servatius Altmicks. He was succeeded by Fr. Anselm Mueller (1863-1892 and 1901-1909), who constructed most of the new college. His successors, Fathers Nicholas Leonard (1892-1901) and Father Fortunatus Hauser (1910- 1912), added new and magnificent buildings. This college, whose chief aim is the education of Catholics, both clerical and lay, is still one of the lead- ing schools of its kind in the United States. The Fathers of Quincy both of the college and the convent, have for many years labored in other neighboring missions in the State of Missouri: Hager’s Grove, St. Marys, Bowling Green, Louisiana, Clarksville, Ewing and Palmyra; in the State of Illinois: Warsaw, St. Joseph, Mt. Sterling, Bloomfield and Westwood; and in the State of Iowa: West Point. At the present time they have charge of the parish at Anthony, 111., and are chaplains at St. Mary’s Hospital and St. Mary’s Institute of Quincy, 111. Up to the year 1862, our entire American mission was directed by the Minister Provincial of the Province of the Holy Cross, Germany. This manner of governing, because of the great distance, involved great difficulties and in the same year (1862), the American mission was declared a commis- sariat. Fr. Mathias Hiltermann was appointed the first Commissary. He arrived in Teutopolis, after his trip from Germany, on the tenth of June, 1862. He was accompanied by the clerics : Nazarius Kommerscheidt, Anselm Mueller, Aloysius Wiewer, Paulinus Weiss; and the candidates: Francis (afterwards Dominic) Droessler, and Albert (Gerard) Becher. Fr. Eugene Puers also joined the American mission in the same year. As the number of Fathers thus increased, they immediately started new undertakings and beside the college at Teutopolis, already mentioned, a new residence was founded in the city of St. Louis, Mo. Towards the close of the year 1862, at the request of Rt. Rev. Joseph Melchers, Vicar General of the archdiocese of St. Louis, the Fathers came to Saint Louis, in order to establish in the southern part of the city, a new parish and also a residence of the Order. This work was assigned to Fr. Servatius Atmicks, the first superior of that place. The Fathers took charge Feb. 5, 1863. Within a few years, a congregation, dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua, became one of the city’s largest parishes. The residence developed into a large convent, which, up to our present day, is the house of studies for the theologians and the residence of the Minister Provincial of the Province of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. This residence was elevated to a convent in 42 1872, and Fr. Ferdinand Bergmeyer was made the first Guardian. The new, large, and ve*y beautiful church was completed in 1909 by Fr. Bernard Wewer, then in charge of the parish. On account of the many members, it also became the center of the III Order Secular of our Seraphic Father St. Francis, which in this city flourishes with great spiritual profit to souls. Beside the parish of St. Anthony, the Fathers of the Convent managed, for many years, parishes outside of the city, namely, Creve Coeur, Harrison- ville, Kimswick, likewise St. Stanislaus in the city and they also had the spiritual care of the College of Christian Brothers; Carondelet; the Mother- house of the Sisters of St. Joseph; the Deaf Mute Institute, Longwood ; House of the Immaculate Conception, Industrial School, Female Hospital. They attended and still attend the following institutions in the city : Acad- emy of the Sacred Heart, Academy of the Sisters of St. Joseph, St., Elizabeth’s Institute, Motherhouse of the Polish Franciscan Sisters, St. Rita’s Academy for Colored Girls, St. Anthony’s Hospital, Little Sisters of the Poor, Mis- souri Railroad Hospital, the Workhouse, the City Sanitarium, the City In- firmary, Mt. St. Rose Hospital for Consumptives, Robert Koch Hospital for Contagious Diseases, U. S. Public Health Service Hospital. In the year 1864, Fr. Killian Schloesser was appointed Commissary. Dur- ing his rule (1864-1869) a new residence was founded in Cleveland, Ohio. Meanwhile new Fathers arrived from Germany. At the request of the Rt. Rev. Armadeus Rappe, Bishop of the diocese of Cleveland, in 1868, Fathers Capistran Zwinge and Dominic Droessler took over the parish of St. Joseph and at the same time, founded a residence of the Order there. Thereupon, a new and by far, greater church was completed by Fr. Killian Schloesser and dedicated in 1873. The residence was made a convent in 1877. Fr. Killian Schloesser was appointed first Guardian of the same. Also a new and spacious monastery was erected in 1892, by Fr. Theodore Arentz. Be- sides attending to the parish of St. Joseph through many years, the Fathers had and still have the spiritual care of various institutions of the city, viz. Notre Dame Academy, Ursuline Academy, House of the Good Shepherd, Little Sisters of the Poor, St. Alexis’ Hospital, St. Joseph’s Orphan Asylum, City Infirmary and also assist in the parishes of the vicinity. In the year 1869, the Minister Provincial, Fr. Gregory Janknecht visited America, a second time; with him came Fathers Eustace Brueggemann and Francis Albers. In the meeting held at Teutopolis, Fr. Maurice Kloster- mann was appointed Commissary Provincial. With great success, he ruled the Commissariat until the year 1879. In the year 1870, a residence was founded at Memphis, Tenn. Our Fathers had charge there of the parish of the Blessed Virgin Mary. Its 43 first pastor was Fr. Eugene Puers. Here, as in other places, the Fathers labor up to the present day with great spiritual success. Deserving of special notice was the heroic care of the sick by the Fathers during the ravages of the yellow fever (1873, 1878 and 1879). During this epidemic, several Fathers and Brothers, having labored with untiring zeal, were called to their eternal reward : namely : Fathers Leo Rinklage, Maternus Mallmann, Chrysostom Beinecke ; Brothers: Wendelin Kuemmerle, Erasmus Hesse, Amandus Jung. Besides the parish, the Fathers also have charge of : House of the Good Shepherd, St. Joseph’s Hospital, and the Country Villa for Incurables. The year 1875 is memorable in the history of the Province of the Most Sacred Heart of Jesus. During this year, our American Mission received a large increase and new strength through the arrival of many brethren, who on account of the persecution then being waged against the Church in Germany, came as exiles to our country. They were received by us with warm fraternal charity and immediately began to work in the mis- sions. There arrived 26 Fathers, 39 Clerics, 9 Novice clerics, 23 Candi- dates and 20 Lay Brothers. New residences were therefore accepted and indeed four of them in the year 1875 : At Hermann, Missouri, the parish Church of St. George. Fr. Dominic Droessler was the first pastor and superior. The church was soon enlarged and a residence built. A new and very beautiful church together with a new residence was built during the years 1915 and 1916 by Fr. Romuald Rheindorf. The Fathers also took charge of the souls in the nearby towns of Chamois, Morrison, Berger, and Little Berger. At present they still have charge of Berger and Little Berger, the other two parishs were given to secular priests in the years 1910 and 1920 respectively. At Jordan, Minnesota, the parish Church of St. John, the Baptist. Fr. Eustace Brueggemann was the first pastor and superior. A new and larger church was soon built. In 1889, a new residence was also built by Fr. Benignus Schuetz. From 1875 the Fathers of this residence also had charge of the parishes of St. Benedict, St. Joseph, St. John and Belle Plaine. At Chicago, 111., the very old parish of St. Peter, the Apostle. Fr. Liborius Schaefermeier was the first pastor and superior. The Church was beauti- fully decorated and a residence built. The work of the Fathers here was very great and filled with heavenly blessings. The III Order Secular is especially in a flourishing condition. An Indianapolis, Ind. the Sacred Heart Parish. The first pastor and superior was Fr. Alardus Andrescheck. He erected a large building, hous- 44 ing the church, school and residence. A new and large church was built partly by Fr. Ferdinand Bergmeyer (1884) and completed and beautifully decorated by Fr. Francis Haase (1891). This residence was raised to the dignity of a convent in 1899, and Fr. Francis Haase was elected its first guardian. The Fathers of the convent attend to the spiritual needs of the House of the Good Shepherd, Little Sisters of the Poor, Sisters of St. Joseph, and also of parishes in the neighboring towns of Fortville, Greenfield and Martinsville, Ind. Again, in the year 1876, more Fathers and a few Brothers arrived from Europe and with them came also the Provincial, Fr. Gregory Janknecht, to make his third canonical visit of the American Mission ; he remained in the mission almost two years, during which time he accepted three new founda- tions. Wien (Mt. St. Mary’s), Missouri, 1876. Fr. Francis Moenning built a residence and part of a new church, of which he was the first pastor and superior; the church was completed and dedicated to the Blessed Virgin Mary, Queen of Angels, in the year 1892. Missions were attended at: Hager’s Grove, Hamden, Hurricane Branch, Lingo, New Cambria, New Hall, Missouri. This residence together with the parish and missions was given over to the secular clergy in 1914. Joliet, Illinois, 1876. The church and parish of St. John the Baptist was taken over in 1876. The first pastor and superior of the Order was Fr. Gerard Becher. Besides the administration of this large parish, in which the Fathers have strenuously labored for the spiritual and temporal welfare of the people, the Order has from the beginning to the present day taken care of the institutions : The Motherhouse and Academy of Sisters of St. Francis, St. Joseph’s Hospital, Guardian Angel Home for Children and the State Penitentiary. Columbus, Nebraska, was accepted in the beginning of 1877. Fr. Ambrose Janssen was made the first pastor and superior of St. Bonaventure s. Fr. Seraphine Lampe erected a parish church, which he completed in 1884. From this residence in the city, the Fathers attended other neighboring parishes, namely: Duncan, Platte Centre; and within the city itself, they take care of St. Anthony’s (Polish) parish and the institutions, St. Francis’ Academy and St. Mary’s Hospital. In 1878, was established the residence at Chillicothe, Missouri. The first pastor and superior of this place, Fr. Francis Moenning, built a church, which was dedicated to St. Columban, and also a home for the Fathers. In the year 1894, Fr. Fidelis Kaercher enlarged and adorned the church and 45 erected a new residence. In addition to St. Columban’s parish, the Fathers attended the neighboring parishes up to the year 1914, namely : Brecken- ridge, Brunswick, Indian Grove, Leopolis, Utica, Braymer, Nettleton; and in the town itself : St. Joseph’s Academy and St. Mary’s Hospital. In the same year, 1878, the Fathers established a mission among the Chippewa Indians of Northern Wisconsin. A residence was built in the town of Bayfield, Wisconsin. The Fathers of this place of which Fr. Casimir Vogt was the first pastor and superior, administer to the parish of the Holy Family; Father Casimir Vogt was at the head of the mission for nearly twenty-five, however, not consecutive years. He erected a new, beauti- ful and massive church in 1900 and completed the new residence, begun in the year 1891 by Fr. John Gafron. From there the Fathers visited the very many, greatly scattered and distant Indian missions ; henceforth, and also up to the present time, they look after the parishes or stations of : Belan- ger’s Settlement, Buffalo Bay, Cable, Grandview, La Point and Cornucopia. On account of the great increase of our American mission, as has been briefly shown, the Definitorium of the Saxonia Province of the Holy Cross assembled in the same year of 1878 in Provincial Chapter and unanimously consented to ask the Most Reverend Minister General of the Order to change the American Commissariat into an independent Province. On the twenty-sixth of April, 1879, the Most Reverend Minister General elevated it to the dignity of a Province, under the name of “Sacred Heart of Jesus.” But at the same time, permission was given to the members of the American Mission to return to their country and remain with their mother Province, if they so desired. Only a few of the brethren made use of this permission to return to Europe, namely, twelve Fathers, nine Clerics, and seven Lay Brothers. The officials of the new Province were appointed by the General Definitorium ; They were as follows : Pro- vincial, Father Maurice Klostermann ; Definitors of the Province, Fathers Kilian Schloesser, Anselm Mueller, Francis Moenning, Damasus Ruesing. In the first Provincial Chapter solemnly celebrated at Teutopolis on July 2, 1879, and presided over by Fr. Maurice Klostermann, the new officials took up their respective duties. Fr. Damasus Ruesing was charged with the office of drawing up the new statutes of the Province, which were ap- proved of by the Provincial Chapter and by the Most Reverend Minister General and went into force January 1, 1882. Chaska, Minnesota. The church and parish of the \"Guardian Angels” was attended by the Fathers of the nearby residence at Jordan from the year 1876. A residence was erected in 1880 by Fr. Clementine Lohrbacher, its first pastor and superior, who also started to build a new church, which Fr. 46 Hueppe completed in the year 1885. This church, however, was greatly damaged by fire and was rebuilt by Fr. Guido Knepper. Besides this parish, the Fathers attended the neighboring parishes of Chanhassen and Victoria. Rhineland, Missouri (now Starkenburg). The Fathers looked after the church and parish of St. Martin for a period of five years and also two parishes in the vicinity, at Case and Hancock Prairie. A residence was erected by Fr. Lullus Mus, but it was given, along with the parish, over to a secular priest in 1885. Radom, Illinois. Here, a church and Polish parish, dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, was administered from the year 1877 by Fr. Desider- ius Liss. Fr. Mark Thienel was the first superior of the residence. Fr. Luke Mierzowski built a new residence in 1895. Besides this, the Order took over the Polish parish of St. Charles at Dubois, Illinois. St. Bernard, Nebraska. A church and parish, dedicated to St. Bernard, was founded and taken care of by the Fathers. The first pastor and superior here, was Fr. Cyprian Banscheid. Fr. Pancratius Schulte erected a new, beautiful church, 1881-1891, and Fr. Stanislaus Riemann built a new resi- dence in the year 1909.
