        "text": "CHAPTER XX\n\nThe Full Blood Cherokees' Progress, Political, Business and Social Activities\n\nRedbird Smith, who was the moving spirit of the Nighthawk branch of the Keetoowah organization of Full-blood Cherokees, was horn July 19th, 1850, somewhere near the city of Ft. Smith, Ark. His father and mother, together with other Cherokees being enroute to Indian Territory from Georgia.\n\nPig Redbird Smith, (the name Smith being added by the white people in Georgia because he was a blacksmith by trade), was an old and ardent adherent of the ancient rituals, customs and practices of the \"Long House\" group of eastern Indians of which the Cherokees were the head band or tribe.\n\nThe wife of Pig Redbird Smith and mother of Redbird Smith was Lizzie Hildebrand Smith, a woman who carried the best blood-lines of the Cherokees.\n\nAt an early date in the boyhood life of Redbird Smith, his father dedicated him to the services and cause of the Cherokee people in accordance with ancient customs and usages. At the early age of ten years, Redbird received instruction at the council fires. At this time, the latter part of 1850, Pig Redbird Smith, Budd Gritts and Vann, all being impressed with the virtues of the religious and moral codes of the ancient Keetoowah order, concluded to reorganize.\n\nREDBIRD SMITH'S HOME\n\nOn the porch are Redbird Smith, his Councilmen and his 5th son, George. On the ground are his wife, 2 daughters, 8 sons, their wives and grandchildren.\n\nBudd Gritts, who was a Baptist Minister, was prevailed upon to draft a Constitution and Laws of government for the use of the people in their group, which was compatible with the changing conditions religiously and politically. The constitution and Laws of Government was formally adopted and the Keetoowahs prospered and lived in peace under it for many years.\n\nDuring the period from 1859 to 1889, the Keetoowahs flourished and were strongly united. Almost without exception the Keetoowahs went with the North in the Civil War. In all this period the Keetoowahs were either Baptists, Methodists, Presbyterians, a few Quakers, and a part of them worshipped according to the rituals of the ancient Keetoowah, but all got along harmoniously. Dissentions came only after the white Missionaries objected to and condemned what they termed \"the Pagan Form of worship'' of the ancient Keetowahs, and designated as \"The work of the Devil.\"\n\nInfluenced by these white teachers, who were conscientious and sincere in their efforts of Christian work, the members of the diferent denominations became strictly sectarian in their practice, but there was still no enmity existing.\n\nThe Keetoowah Constitution and Laws of Government was amended in 1889, making it rather a political organization in character. From this period the differences between the Christian Keetoowahs and the Ancient Keetoowahs became more marked, and there was lack of harmony even in their policies of political effort.\n\nIn 1895 when the question of the allotment of lands to the members of the Five Civilized Tribes was being agitated, the ancient Keetoowahs became very active in opposing the proposed change. In this, however, all the Keetoowah element were united in their opposition to any speedy change. From this time to 1900 the following of Redbird Smith were designated universally as the \"Nighthawk Keetoowahs\" because of their vigilence in their activities.\n\nOn January 31st, 1899, a general election was held for the purpose of determining on what is known as the Dawes Commission Treaty. The Full-bloods lost by two thousand fifteen votes. The Keetoowahs were united in their opposition to the allotment of lands and dissolution of their government, but a part of them saw that the change was inevitably coming and adjusted themselves accordingly.\n\nRedbird Smith, however, took the position that it was grossly unjust for the United States Government, their Trustee, to precipitately plunge a large number of his people into so radically changed conditions, he accordingly advised his following (about 5789 according to the roll of their number at that time) that he reposed confidence in the integrity of the intentions of the Government of the United States to uphold its Treaty Stipulations; that sooner or later the Government would see the injustice to the Full-bloods and would take active measures to make amends. He therefore counselled his people not to participate further in the deliberations of what he termed the majority of the advocates of the change. He and his group stood steadfast in this recalcitrant attitude until about KMO when he became convinced that it was useless.\n\nIn 1908 his position as Chairman was officially changed by the Nighthawk Keetoowah Council to that of Chief. An election was held for this purpose and he was unanimously elected in that capacity for life, which he held and ably filled until his death, November 8th, 1918, after a short illness of forty-eight hours.\n\nRedbird Smith was a man endowed with a great native ability and great enough to admit his own mistakes. In this matter he said: \"After my selection as a Chief, I awakened to the grave and great responsibilities of a leader of men. I looked about and saw that I had led my people down a long and steep mountain side, now it was my duty to turn and lead them back upward and save them. The unfortunate thing in the mistakes and errors of leaders or of governments is the penalty the innocent and loyal followers have to pay. My greatest ambition has always been to think right and do right. It is my belief that this is the fulfilling of the law of the Great Creator. In the upbuilding of my people it is my purpose that we shall be spiritually right and industrially strong.\"\n\n\"I have always believed that the Great Creator had a great design for my people, the Cherokees. I have been taught that from my childhood up and now in my mature manhood I recognize it as a great truth. Our forces have been dissipated by the external forces, perhaps it has been just a training, but we must now get together as a race aud render our contribution to mankind.\"\n\nRedbird Smith, (left), and Bluford Sixkiller, Asst. Chief (right), instructing children in the Kotoowah Retual.\n\n\"We are endowed with intelligence, we are industrious, we are loyal, and we are spiritual but we are overlooking the particular Cherokee mission on earth, for no man nor race is endowed with these qualifications without a designed purpose. Work and right training is the solution of my following. We as a group are still groping in darkness in many things, but this we know we must work. A kindly man cannot help his neighbor m need unless he have a surplus and he cannot have a surplus unles he works. It is so simple and yet we have to continually remind our people of this.\"\n\n\"Our Mixed-bloods should not be overlooked in this program of a racial awakening. Our pride in our ancestral heritage is our great incentive for handing something worth while to our posterity. It is this pride in ancestry that makes men strong and loyal for their principle in life. It is this same pride that makes men give up their all for their Government.\"\n\nIn the last few years of his life Redbird Smith became obsessed with his ambition for his people. He insisted in securing the services of one who was willing to co-operate with him in working some industrial plan for the Nighthawk Keetoowah Group, and he did not give up his program until he secured an agreement with this party to serve with his people for seven years, beginning with January 1st, 1918.\n\nHis program covered not only the Nighthawks, but all people of Cherokee blood. His great ambition was to accomplish a united spirit of co-operation among all the factors of the Cherokee people. It was distinctly not his idea to reestablish the old and discarded regime of the Cherokee Government, but to awaken a racial pride, so that the more fortunate of the race may become great factors in helping their less fortunate brethren.\n\nIt is this spirit and ambition of his that has prevailed even after his death, and that which his survivors in Office are carrying out in the selection of Levi Gritts as Chief of the Cherokees. It should be understood that it is purely a purpose of unifying the Cherokee people to a grand effort of agrandizing the race that it may acquit itself as a contributor to a grand race of men in America, as Redbird called it \"The Mother of the New World.\"\n\nTo fulfill these purposes the Cherokee Executive Council was organized, with the following members:\n\nCherokee Executive Council W. Tate Brady, Chairman of Executive Counsel, Secretary W. M. Gulager. Ketoowahs Incorporated: John B. Smith, Tahlequah, Oklahoma Robert Meigs, Parkhill, Oklahoma. Rider Ratler, Lyons, Oklahoma. Peter Cramp, Porum, Oklahoma. Isaac Greece, Tahlequah, Oklahoma. For the Eastern and Western: Watt Mayes, Pryor, Oklahoma. E. N. Washbourne, Jay, Oklahoma. James Hilderbrand, Bernice, Oklahoma. J. R. Mcintosh, Claremore, Okla. Geo. Mayes, Pryor, Oklahoma. Cherokee Personal Committee: S. R. Lewis, Tulsa, Oklahoma. W. T. Brady, Tulsa, Oklahoma. W. M. Gulager, Muskogee, Oklahoma. J. G. Sanders, Tulsa, Oklahoma. S. G. Maxfield, Tulsa, Oklahoma. Nighthawk Keetoowahs: Sam Smith, Gore, Oklahoma.Sam R. Smith, Gore, Oklahoma. John R.

Bullett, Tulsa, Oklahoma. A. H. Norwood, Dewey, OklahomaSolomon Ketchum, Vinita, Oklahoma L. Wilson, Nowata, Oklahoma.\n\nBluford Sixkiller, who was Redbird's asistant from 1908 until Sept. 12th, 1920, which he resigned on account of poor health. William Rogers succeeded to his place by election on the same date. William Rogers is 51 years of age and a faithful follower of Redbird Smith. He is a man of sterling qualities and has rendered invaluable service to his people.\n\nBluford Sixkiller died November 23rd, 1921, aged 73 years.\n\nSam Smith, the son of Redbird Smith succeeded to his father's place as Chief of the Nighthawk Keetoowahs. April 7th, 1919. He is successfully carrying out his father's program. Makes a wise and conservative leader and yet very progressive.\n\nOce Hogshooter, the secretary of the organization has served in that capacity since 1908. A man fifty years of age and an active worker and a wise counsellor to his people.\n\nJohn Redbird Smith, the official Interpreter of the Organization since 1900 and a steadfast assistant of his revered father. A man of strong convictions, conscientious, fearless and a very strong factor in the work of bringing the Nighthawks out of the wilderness.\n\nAll of Redbird's ten living children are ardent followers of their father. Redbird left surviving him, his wife, two daughters, eight sons and thirty-five grandchildren.\n\nLucy Fields Smith, the surviving wife of Redbird's, was born near Braggs, Oklahoma, in 1852. Her father was Richard Fields, who at the time of his death in Washington, D. C, was the attorney general of the Cherokee Nation. Her mother was Eliza Brewer Fields, who survived until Jan. 1890.\n\nThis noble and loyal wife of Redbird Smith was largely responsible for his sucess in life. She is a wonderful mother. When her two youngest boys departed for the Army encampment, Kian and Stokes, she calmly gave her boys up and bade them to be courageous and acquit themselves as men.\n\nIt is a noteworthy fact that Chief Redbird, issued an edict to all the fires of the Nighthawk Keetoowahs, calling upon all members of draft age to offer themselves without reserve and to take no advantage of the exemption provided for. This was carried except in two cases.\n\nThe following named were all great factors in the work of the Keetoowah organization: Anderson Gritts, Ned Ten Killer, Nagada Seweegbe, Joe Chewy, Lacy Hawkins, Daniel Redbird, George Benge, Stool Jacksonm George Hughes, Ned Bullfrog, Sanee Goo-vah, Sand, Wilson Girty, Tom Horn, Charley Ketcher, John Wycliff, Jim Wycliff, Charley Scott, Alex McCoy, Paul Glass, Joshua Glass, Jim Alex, Alex Deerinwater, Jim Hogshooter, Will Sand and George Smith.\n\n(1) Chief Redbird Smith.

(12) Stoke Smith.\n\nThe following notice of election' of Levi Gritts, Chief of the Cherokees, is a splendid written document and fully explains the necessity and importance of the election:\n\nBox, Oklahoma, December 9th, 1920.\n\nMr. Levi Gritts,\n\nMuskogee, Oklahoma.\n\nMy dear Mr. Gritts:—Pursuant to a well defined plan and program of the Nighthawk Keetoowahs of Full-blood Cherokee Indians, you have seen designated by the Council of said Society to serve our suffering cause in the capacity of CHIEF OF THE CHEROKEES.\n\nWith the death of the late Chief Rogers, terminated the officially recognized position of Cherokee Chief. The elimination of this office seemed at the time to be natural and it was the concensus of opinion on the part of the Cherokees themselves as well as the Departmental administrators of our affairs that there was no further need of the office of a Chief in our changed conditions.\n\nYour attention is respectfully invited to the following analysis as we have, in our humble way, been able to reach:\n\nTaking the Full-blood, particularly the Nighthawk Keetoowahs, as a basis of this analysis, we find, first; That beginning with the trying times of the year Nineteen Hundred, these people were overwhelmed with what seemed to them an attempt on the part of the United States government to divest them of what they considered their vested rights; they were all too suddenly divested of the rights and prerogatives of self determination in their National Gvernmental affairs, with the result that they eventually crystalized into a recalcitrant attitude. They looked askance upon every movement of the government, taking the position that every move now, meant exploitation of what little they may have left of a once vast holdings.\n\nThis unfortunate position was largely justified and amplified by the fact that a large number of their own blood, who had been fortunate enough to have received the advantages of literary training, now became the allies of the unscrupulous and exploiting hordes, who infested the country during the said \"trying times,\" an element, who seem to destiny itself to have designed to always precede the wholesome citizenry, who eventually supercede and predominate, and held full sway for a number of years.\n\nA further elaboration of this particular phase of our analysis is unnecessary with you, who lived and survived through a period of bitter and trying experiences. The incarceration of an educated Full-blood Indian in a Penal Institution of our new state was not beyond the intelligence of our Full-bloods. Ihey recognized the brazen rebuke and the NOTICE TO THEM of their futile ind hopeless position as a group and kind.\n\nProceeding now to the SECOND and final analysis, we submit the following deductions: The advance and gradual increase numerically of the subtantial class of citizens, home builders and hence nation builders, and the two decades of close contact and living in the atmosphere of intensive constructive effort, of which our young state stands without a precedent; and last but not least, the loyal and unequivocal response of not only our Full-blood Nighthawks but of all the American Indians, to the Nation's call to Arms and service in our recent World Struggle; all contribute to rehabilitate the Indians' self respect and confidence in themselves, as well as confidence in the integrity of purpose in their behalf on the part of the Government of the Unitd States.\n\nIt is gratifying to note, that with all the effusive commendations and extravagant expressions of appreciation on the part of the American people, for the creditable manner in which our people acquitted themselves in the War with Germany, the Indians have not become imbued with the idea of self-importance. In fact, the Indians of America merely had a chance to show what is inherently in them as a race. In their own estimation they did no more than any loyal citizen should have done. It was a spontaneous reciprocal response to a Great Government, who by virtue of being entangled in a World crisis, called upon its whole people to a united effort.\n\nThere is carried with this, a new psychological angle so far as the Full-blood Indian is concerned. For the first time in history he realizes through the attitude of the United States Government, that his material effects and his manhood are a National asset; that he is a part and parcel of the body politic of a great Commonwealth. He is alert to the responsibilities of his new position.' He is expecting participation in the administration of his affairs. He is keenly cognizant and sensible of the new responsibilities with which he is about to be endowed. Within a decade the restricted period shall terminate and during that same space of time all our Claims against our Government may be adjudicated and finally settled.\n\nNow, confidently and sincerely these Full-blood Cherokees point out that by virtue of their new position and relations they must come into closer touch and cooperation with the supervisory and administrative agencies of the Government, and of their number many have no other means of communcation except through the medium of the Cherokee language. These conditions demand and require more than a mere Official Interpreter at the Departmental offices.\n\nFrom now on for the next few years the Cherokees must have a real REPRESENTATIVE at the headquarters of the Five Civilized Tribes' agency, for the following potent reasons: First, the unrestricted intermarried and mixed-blood Cherokee citizens, while to all intents and purposes are like any white American citizens, they are interested and have equitable rights in all matters pertaining to our unadjusted claims against the United States, it is of imperative importance that their efforts should co-ordinate with our efforts in the accomplishment of said adjustments. This can be achieved by uniting all forces through the one proposed REPRESENTATIVE. Secondly, the restricted full-bloods, who are still possessed of restricted landed assets as well as restricted funds, are most vitally ineterested in the administerial agencies of the Government, particularly at this time of anticipated important changes in the personnel as well as policies in the Departments directly affecting them. This group being largely composed of non-English speaking people, and being by custom and practice trained to do their business through a Chief, it is but natural and logical that now, when a united Cherokee effort is so apparently necessary to accomplish anything for the good of all, they should demand and designate a CHIEF.\n\nOur determination on you for the place is not because of our desire to confer an HONORARY position upon you, as a recognition of your former positions in our behalf, but because we know your DEPENDABILITY AND EFFICIENT QUALIFICATIONS for such responsibility. You are a Full-blood Cherokee, reared and developed under Full-blood life conditions. You understand and sympathize with the thought and life of the Full-blood. You have had the advantages of an academic training. You are master of both the Cherokee and the English languages. You have survived the crucial test of the transition period of the last decade in our country. You have reached the age of calm and conservative discernment. Those enumerated experiences and advantages of your life, together with your native-born ambitions for your people, commend you as a safe and sane leader and counsellor for us all.\n\nWe, of the Nighthawk Keetoowah contingent of the Cherokee Indians repose implicit confidence in the integrity of your thought and regard for the various groups and interests of our people and sincerely feel that you are capable and will render us most valuable service.\n\nIn accepting the arduous task we are thrusting upon you, we desire to urge the necessity of immediate action and co-operation of the other factors and groups to the end that we may be properly and effectively organized for a united effort in the prosecution of our various interests. We believe that now is the opportune time to make our representations to the dispensers of patronage of the incoming administration. If the Indian manhood and his material assets were of so vital a part to the United States in time of trouble it is certainly no more than just and right that we participate in a careful selection of men of recognized calibre coupled with unimpeachable character for administrators of our material possessions of millions of dollars in value is well as the more momentous question of our moral and intellectual developnient.\n\nTHE KEETOOWAH COUNCIL, 1916. The office of COMMISSIONER OF INDIAN AFFAIRS is one of paramount interest to every Indian of the United States. Next in importance, particularly insofar as we are concerned, is the office of Superintendent of The Five Civilized Tribes and it is absolutely necessary that a petition in this matter be immediately submitted to the proper sources of authority, to the end that the demands of our INTERESTS may receive a satisfactory degree of consideration.\n\nYou are therefore, by virtue hereof, and the urgent immediate demands of our interests, and the interests of all the Cherokees, made and constituted the CHEROKEE CHIEF.\n\nWith sincere regard and respect,\n\n(Signed) SAM SMITH,\n\nChief of the Nighthawk Keetoowahs.\n\n(SEAL)\n\nAttest.\n\n(Signed) Oce Hogshooter,\n\nSecretary Nighthawk Keetoowahs.\n\nCobb, Dr. Isabel (See Grant)—Martha Blythe, born Jan. 31, 1812.

FIELDS\n\nFields, George W.—Born in the Same room, on July 10, 1882, in which the sterling old patriot, Stand Watie died on September 9, 1871, Senator George W. Fields seems to have in some mystical way been imbued with a similar character of reticent perseverance. Reared in a community of earnest honest integrity, where the mass was willing to receive limited educations and settle to lives of arduous husbandry, thus contributing to the sane thinking and deliberate backbone of the glorious republic. George Fields, as others of his mould have done since the dawn of civilization, by steady pertinacity, gained by frugal care and close application on a common school education and while working on the farm and closing his days in the public schools came to him the listless longing for a Male Seminary education, the acme of solicitude of the patriotic Cherokee. The quiet, gentlemanly and agreeable country lad, stintingly saved small sums that gained the coveted goal of an entrance into the Seminary, where he graduated on May 28, 1902, using as the subject of his oration, Sequoyah. The best indication of the regard that the instructors and fellow pupils had of him could be gained by their soft inflection of speech when they spoke of him.\n\nOf generous physical proportions, manager of the Seminary baseball and football teams, an athlete of more than ordinary acquirements, he listened not to the call of the plaudits of the diamond and roped arena, but sought the quieter vocations, the teacher and farmer.\n\nOn April 3, 1904, Mr. Fields married at Southwest City, Missouri, Miss Jennie, the accomplished and talented daughter of Mr. and Mrs. John Glass of Chelsea, Oklahoma.\n\nMr. Fields like all of the prominent Cherokees, transferred to the State of Oklahoma an equal mead of patriotic love and fealty that they had evinced for their Nation, as they felt that it was a natural fruition.\n\nA democrat, he was nominated and elected as the first register of deeds of Delaware, his native county, in the first state election. The approval of his course in this office was bestowed in reelection by his fellow citizens, the people that had known him from boyhood. Five years were encompassed in these two terms and he was then elected State Senator from the thirtieth district in 1912. In the senate he never missed a roll call, was seldom heard on the floor but had the reputation of being one of the most eficeient workers of that body of able men.\n\nIn 1913, he was admitted to the bar and opened an office early in 1920, when he became established in Oklahoma City where his volume of business, within two years would bear favorable comparison with any in the state. His reticence is that of the anglist and omniverous student. As Attorney in the Texas-Cherokee suit for reparations for one and one-half million acres of land, he has developed and is forwarding the largest civil case of the Cherokees.\n\nFraternally Mr. Fields is a Mason of the 32nd degree, an Elk and Shriner; also a member of the American Legion, Oklahoma State Bar Association and of the Christian church.\n\nCHAS.

Each epoch of the nation's history has brought forward a Lewis to fulfill his destiny in lending his effort to the up-building of the country.

The mother, who bore the maiden name of Rhoda Benge, was born in the Cherokee Nation of the Indian Territory and passed away in 1886 at the comparatively early age of thirty-nine years. The father had come to the Indian Territory in young manhood. He had obtained a common school education in the Indian schools and afterward engaged in farming.
