Moore, Institute for Intergovernmental Research\n\nThe National Youth Gang Center surveyed a representative national sample of more than 3,000 law enforcement agencies regarding youth gang problems in 1996, 1997, and 1998. The survey sample consists of all police departments serving cities with populations more than 25,000; all suburban-county police and sheriffs’ departments; a random sample of police departments serving cities with populations between 2,500 and 25,000; and a random sample of rural-county police and sheriffs’ departments. Three-year trends are presented. In addition, highlights of the 1998 survey are presented.\n\nA\n\nA Case Study of Daytime Truancy Enforcement and Juvenile Crime\n\nDouglas Wiebe, University of California, Irvine\n\nJames W. Meeker, University of California, Irvine\n\nThomas E. Fossati, University of California , Irvine\n\nResearch on the crime-reduction impact of curfews remains inconclusive and widely debated. We examine the relationship between curfew enforcement and the distribution of urban crime with a quasi-experiment set in Orange County. California, where daytime truancy enforcement was recently begun in attempts to reduce daytime burglaries and improve school attendance. Two longitudinal data sets are used: the Gang Incident Tracking System (GITS), and a police record database of juvenile crime. Both sets contain data from 1996 through 1998, enabling an analysis of the effect of truancy enforcement on the amount and location of juvenile crime and juvenile gang crime. We first describe the motivation for the truancy enforcement and the method of implementation, and then present findings of crime reduction and displacement\n\nA Community-Based Intervention for Homeless Crack-Using Women: Involving the African-American Church Community\n\nGerald Stahler, Temple University\n\nThis paper describes the development and implementation of an innovative community-based intervention program for homeless crack-using women with children. It was designed to address many of the needs of homeless crack-using women that traditional treatment programs frequently neglect, including: long-term, continuous services that address the social isolation, tangible needs, and alienation from the client’s community; building upon the indigenous resources of the community instead of relying solely on professional treatment providers; the use of an intervention that is sensitive and relevant to the client’s culture; and addressing the clients, spiritual needs by helping them re-establish their bonds to their church community. This federally-funded demonstration project combined six months of comprehensive residential treatment with the use of volunteer mentors from the African-American church community who maintained daily contact with clients for approximately one year. In addition, spiritually-based group activities, including workshops, fellowship meals, and group activities in the community were used to further foster social and community support for the women. A description of the program model, its implementation, and an overview of the results from the outcome evaluation supporting the program’s effectiveness will be presented.\n\nA Comparison of Crime Trends in Chinese Societies and the U.S.\n\nMichael A. Cretacci, University at Albany\n\nYihShyan Sun, University at Albany\n\nThe paper compares crime rates in three Chinese societies and in the United States for the period of 1981-1994. First, the research examines crime rates in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. Although considerable research has been conducted on crime trends in each of the three Chinese societies, very little attention has been paid to comparative analyses between them. This study is an attempt to remedy this situation. Second, the study compares crime rates between Chinese societies and the U.S., which has received very little attention in comparative criminal justice literature. Data used in this study were collected from the International Crime Statistics published by the International Criminal Police Organization (INTERPOL), the United Nations Surveys of Crime Trends and the Operations of Criminal Justice System, and Crime Statistics published by Taiwan’s National Police Administration. They represent crimes known to the police. The overall crime rates as well as violent and property crimes are compared and discussed.\n\nA Comparison of Group Counseling and Educational Interventions for Chronic Custody Litigators and Contemnors in Family Court\n\nJanet R. Johnston, San Jose State University\n\nHighly conflicted separating and divorced families who are in chronic disputes and frequent contempt of court ordered arrangements for custody and visitation have been shown to be psychologically abusive of their children and costly to the courts. The purpose of this study was to evaluate two group models of diversion from litigation for these families: a group counseling intervention and an educational/skill-building class. The results of a formative and outcome evaluation study of both services are described and compared with the litigation records of a comparison sample of families that did not receive the group intervention. Compared to baseline, at the nine-month follow-up there were consistent findings that coparents were more cooperative, less conflictual and more likely to be concerned about their children’s needs. Litigation rates and usage of family court services significantly declined for the group counseling model but were unchanged for the educational model, compared with their respective comparison groups. The counseling model cost 16.5 and the educational model cost 2.5 counselor hours of service per family. However, differences in client populations and jurisdictional policies and practices renders problematic any direct comparisons of outcome effectiveness of these two models of service.\n\nA Comparison of Juvenile Sexual Offender Treatment Programs in Correctional Settings\n\nCindy J. Smith, University of Baltimore\n\nRecognition of juvenile sexual offending as a serious social problem has accorded treatment of this population greater emphasis and priority in the juvenile justice system. At the same time, research on juvenile sexual offending has intensified, yet such research remains limited and exploratory in nature. This dearth of literature results in little direction for treatment providers and policymakers to sufficiently guide policies and procedures regarding this seriously troubled population. This paper will examine sex offender specific treatment programs located in juvenile correctional facilities in three states. Each state will be analyzed in terms of processing juvenile sex offenders and subsequently which sort of juvenile sex offender treatment program is available for assignment. Based on program documentation and interviews with treatment personnel and program directors the paper will describe how state juvenile sex offender treatment programs vary in structure, components, and implementation as well as similarities (or dissimilarities) of program elements. Implications for policy and practice will be discussed. I\n\nA Comparison of Rural-Urban Differences in Adolescent Substance Use\n\nJoseph F. Donnermeyer, The Ohio State University\n\nScott Scheer, The Ohio State University\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to conduct a twenty year plus review of the nationally representative Monitoring the Future Study of adolescent substance use. Comparisons of prevalence rates between rural or non-metropolitan and urban or metropolitan youth are made across a wide variety of substances. Characteristics of students, including gender, race, age, among other, associated with substance use, are also broken down by metro and non-metro status. The authors address the issue of convergence of substance use rates and epidemiological patterns between rural and urban youth. Also, the authors discuss whether or not rural-urban differences that persist have any theoretical and substantive importance.\n\nA Contextual Analysis of Delinquency Theories: Elaborating the Community Connection\n\nJohn P. Hoffmann, Brigham Young University\n\nTheories of delinquency stem from a number of sources. Much of the sociological roots of these theories suggest that macro-level processes affect the relationship between micro-level factors and delinquent behavior. However, due mainly to modeling limitations, most empirical research has focused only on micro-level analyses of delinquency. In this paper, I elaborate theoretically the explicit macro-micro links of several delinquency theories, including social control, social learning, and general strain. This is followed by an empirical examination of these links using longitudinal data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS, n=12,298). A multilevel statistical model is used to study the variability of micro-level relationships across a large sample of communities in the United States. The results elaborate delinquency theories while furthering research on micro-macro links in adolescent behavior.\n\nA Cross-National Comparison of Drug Possession and Drug Trafficking Offenses at Different Stages of the Criminal Justice System, 1990-1994\n\nGraham Farrell, Rutgers University\n\nSheryl Van Horne, Rutgers University\n\nThe Fifth United Nations Crime Survey was utilized to analyze drug crime trends between 1990 and 1994 within and between countries and regions. Drug-possession and trafficking offenses were examined at each of the following stages of the criminal justice system: apprehension, prosecution, conviction and admission to prison. The questions that are addressed include: 1) where, geographically, are drugs a more significant problem in the-criminal justice system, 2) how has the share of-drug possession and trafficking offenses changed over time in the criminal justice system, 3) are drug offenses more likely to be filtered out in some countries, rather than others, and 4) is there a regional or worldwide trend in filtering out drug cases. Case summaries and means were used to assess differences and the sign test, a non-parametric test, was used to test the validity of the results.\n\nA Developmental Epidemiological Investigation of the Relationship Between concentration Problems and Aggressive Behavior\n\nGeorge W. Rebok, Johns Hopkins University\n\nVasiliki J. Tsamis, The Catholic University of America\n\nThe relationship between second and sixth concentration problems and aggressive behavior was examined in an epidemiological sample (N=191 enrolled in 19 Baltimore City Public Schools in an effort to further investigate their continuity or discontinuity beyond the first grade as previously reported by Kellam et al. (1991). The childhood sample composed on 96 males and 95 females were in a control condition; thus, their behavior had not been altered or manipulated in any manner. The psychometric ratings of concentration problems and aggressive behavior are based on the perceived observations of teaches in the classroom in the spring semesters of second and sixth grades. Four groups were created based on high or low intelligence using the scaled score of the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test-Revised. Results using bivariate correlations analysis indicate a significant correlation between second and sixth grade concentration problems in males in the high intelligence category and for males and females with low intelligence scores. However, second and sixth grade aggressive behavior was significantly correlated for both males and females for both low and high intelligence. Moreover, early aggressive behavior was significantly correlated categories. On the other hand, second grade concentration problems were significantly correlated with sixth grade aggressive behavior only in females with low intelligence. Because males and females differ with respect to concentration problems and aggressive behavior, early examinations of female aggressiveness may shed insight into the development of aggression in females. The implications for the differences in patterns of correlations will be discussed.\n\nA European Road to the Penal State?\n\nLoic Wacquant, University of California – Berkeley\n\nOver the past thrity years, the U.S. has gradually substituted for the social management of populations deemed derelict, disreputable, and deviant, their penal treatment by a restructured, commercialized, “welfare-carceral complex” designed to impose desocialized wage labor and to dispose of supernumerary categories, resulting in the hyptertrophic growth of its prison and criminal justice system. Will Europe follow suit in similarly criminalizing poverty as the consequence of and complement to the generalization of work insecurity and the deepening of social inequalities attending upon the demise of the Fordist-Keynesian social compact? This paper surveys penal policies, carceral trends, discourses on “security,” urban disorder and punishment, and shifts in welfare programs in the European Union to discern the path that Europe is taking–or might take–towards building its own brand of penal state. In so doing it seeks to identify the institutional, cultural, and political factors that foster or check, accelerate or mitigate, the drift from the social to the penal government of misery in advanced societies.\n\nA Housing Authorities Perspective on Crime Mapping\n\nCharles Soares, New Bedford Housing Authority\n\nMost crime mapping in the United States is done by police departments. The mapping of crime in public housing is itself quite rare and us usually the domain of police agencies or research criminologists. The Housing Authority in New Bedford, MA is unique in that it is the principal crime mapper in that municipality. The Housing Authority forged a partnership with its local PD several years ago when crime mapping of public housing by any organization was virtually unknown. The story of that partnership will serve as the basis for this presentation.\n\nA Jurisprudence for the Ages: Identifying the Top U.S. Supreme Court Justices and Criminal Procedure Decisions of the 20th Century\n\nJames Acker, University at Albany\n\nWayne A. Logan, University at Albany\n\nThis paper presents the results of a survey of criminal justice and law school faculty in the United States who teach criminal procedure law regarding their opinions about (1) the composition of the ideal 20th century United States Supreme Court, and (2) the most significant criminal procedure decisions of the 20th century. The reasons given in support of respondents, selections for the top Supreme Court Justices and the most significant criminal procedure decisions of the century are reported, and the respective views of the faculty from criminal justice departments and law schools are compared. The survey results help identify the qualities and characteristics of outstanding Supreme Court Justices and of doctrinally and practically significant constitutional criminal procedure decisions according to experts who teach in this area of the law.\n\nA Longitudinal Analysis of Welfare and Homicide\n\nChristopher T. Lowenkamp, University of Cincinnati\n\nMitchell B. Chamlin, University of Cincinnati\n\nThis study examines the extent to which simultaneity and offense aggregation biases taint cross-sectional analyses of the effects of welfare transfers on homicide. Specifically, we use ARIMA techniques to model the reciprocal relationship between the ration of individuals receiving AFDC benefits to the number of unemployed and total and disaggregated counts of homicide for a large mid-western city. The data are monthly, spanning the years 1976 through 1994.\n\nA Longitudinal Qualitative Study of Prison-based Drug Treatment for Women\n\nBarbara Owen, California State University – Fresno\n\nThis paper describes a qualitative field study that will examine gender-specific, prisonbased treatment. First I will collect data through an intense field study of women prisoners participating in a new in-prison drug treatment program, “New Directions”, a modified therapeutic community at the Central California Women’s Facility. Second, I will follow these women upon release and detail the impact of substance abuse treatment on their futures. Through depth interviews, focus groups and participant observation, I propose to describe the links among past drug use, present drug treatment and visions of a future beyond imprisonment. I intend to use a modified life history calendar to develop profiles and case studies that probe the drug-crime connection. In the second year follow-up study, I would maintain contacts developed with a sample of women during the fieldwork and investigate the ways in which this experience has shaped their post-release lives. This project calls for the use of “multiple depth” interviewing, that involves repeated contacts with subjects, allowing relationships to develop and layers of information to be collected. Several researchers have suggested that this method is particularly important for the study of women.\n\nA Meta-Analysis of IQ and Delinquency: Much Ado ABout Nothing\n\nArnold Alexander, Michigan State University\n\nJudith M. Collins, Michigan State University\n\nKatie E. Gorrie, Michigan State University\n\nMarc B. Wolbert, Michigan State University\n\nResearch has demonstrated a relationship between IQ and delinquency controlling for different measures of intelligence (Prentice & Kelly, 1963; West & Farrington, 1973); age of onset of criminality (Janson, 1982; Manne & Rosenthal, 1971); severity of criminality (Gibson & West, 1970); types of offenders (Heilburn, 1982; Hogh & Wolf, 1983), and gender (Rutter, Maughan., Mortimore, & Ouston, 1979). We conducted a rneta-analysis of those and other studies generated in a comprehensive literature -review. Using an interactive meta-analytic procedure, we estimated the operational validity of IQ for the prediction of delinquency and for the amount of observed variance attributed to range restriction, sampling error, and measurement unreliability. We also conducted moderator metaanalyses by study design, sample type, measure of intelligence, gender, age, and SES. The overall results revealed an operational validity of p = -20 indicating that only 4% of the variance in delinquency is explained by IQ. We will discuss these and the moderator results\n\nA Multilevel Analysis of Weapon Possession at School\n\nPamela Wilcox Rountree, University of Kentucky\n\nRichard R. Clayton, University of Kentucky\n\nThe proposed study is aimed at addressing limitations in the extant literature on school-based adolescent weapon carrying. In particular. the present study suggests an integrative multilevel model of student weapon carrying to be used in place of exclusively micro or macro models of student armament. The proposed integrative model will emphasize the simultaneous effects of both individual sources of motivation — including fear, victimization, criminal lifestyle, pro-gun socialization from family and/or peers, and school attachment — as well as contextual (school) sources of motivation to carry weapons to school, including various indicators of school disorganization. In addition. the multilevel model proposed here assumes that school-level disorganization may condition or moderate the effects of individual-level motivation on schoolbased weapon carrying- Hierarchical logistic models of school-based student weapon possession will be estimated using survey data from over 29,000 6-12 graders in over 50 middle and high schools in eight different Kentucky counties.\n\nA Multilevel Model of the Effects of Social Disorganization on Adolescent Deviance\n\nGlen C. Tolle, Jr., Texas A & M University\n\nHoward B. Kaplan, Texas A & M University\n\nThis paper reports an empirical investigation of the effects of social disorganization on adolescent informal and formal social control networks and individual delinquency. Longitudinal, multilevel structural equation modeling is employed to estimate a theoretically informed model that specifies social disorganization as a second level, contextual variable operationalized using 1990 census data (Time 1). Social disorganization is also specified as a first level, individual variable operationalized using respondent perceptions of social disorganization in their neighborhoods starting in 1993 (Time 2). Also included at Time 2 are individual level constructs that measure dimensions of the respondents’ informal and formal social control networks. The dependent variable, individual deviance, is measured using interview data starting in 1996 (Time 3). The sample consists of 953 adolescents between the ages of I I and 18, who live with a least one biological parent, and are enrolled in school. Findings of the analysis support the hypotheses that social disorganization as a contextual variable has influence on the perceptions of social disorganization at the individual level, which in turn has effects on the adolescents’ social control networks. These networks then have effects on later individual deviance. Limitations of the research are discussed, as are further avenues of research.\n\nA Process and Outcome Study of a Prison-Based Treatment Program for substance-Abusing Women\n\nElizabeth Hall, University of California – Los Angeles\n\nJean Wellisch, University of California – Los Angeles\n\nMichael Prendergast, University of California – Los Angeles\n\nProviding treatment for substance-abusing women in prison has been recognized as an important approach both to address this prominent need among women offenders and to reduce-recidivism associated with continued drug use following release from prison. The Forever Free program in California is a mature program that provides- 4-6-months of residential treatment following a psychoeducational model rather than the therapeutic community model used in most prison treatment programs, Graduates-may also participate in six months of community-based residential treatment while on parole. This paper will present findings from a process and outcome evaluation of the Forever Free Program, including data on during-treatment changes in psychological measures; the contribution of therapeutic alliance to those changes, relationships that women have with their children, participation in aftercare, and post-treatment status on parole. Institutional and other barriers to participation in the prison and community phases-of treatment will be discussed, as will the applicability of the Residential Substance Abuse Treatment initiative, under which Forever Free is partially funded to treatment programming for women.\n\nA Profile of Recidivism Indicators Betwen Felons and Misdemeanant Released From Incarceration in North Carolina\n\nDarrell L. Ross, East Carolina University\n\nMark Jones, East Carolina University\n\nStudies on recidivism rates of prisoners released from correctional facilities reveal varying statistical percentages. Moreover, the term “recidivism” can be defined many ways, and any definition can be problematic. Using official data furnished by the North Carolina Sentencing and Policy Advisory Commission, we examined the varying characteristics that are associated with fingerprinted rearrest within two years of release between felons and misdemeanants released from incarceration. A random sample and matching of 500 prisoners from each category was utilized to compare the two groups. A profile of each group was developed which identifies key indicators or predictors of recidivism. A discussion of the implications for correctional policy makers, educators, and students is provided. Future research concerns are also addressed.\n\nA Quantitative Investigation Into Responses to Methadone Maintenance Treatment Organizational Style\n\nMargaret S. Kelley, University of Miami\n\nThe organizational effectiveness of methadone maintenance treatment (MMT) was evaluated by analyzing levels of compliance and involvement with treatment programs for clients at three types of MMT clinics in the San Francisco Bay Area. Secondary analysis was used on longitudinal data collected from the National Institute on Drug Abuse funded project, Injection Drug Users, Methadone Maintenance Treatment, and AIDS, with Marsha Rosenbaum as principle investigator (n=233). The analysis rested on Rosenbaum’s theoretical model of clinics types differentiated by the clinic’s style of control over clients (A Matter of Style: Variation Among Methadone Clinics in the Control of Clients, 1985). With a focus on the interaction between individuals and their institutional environments, the analysis compared three types of clinics: reformist, medical-model and libertarian. Reformist clinics exercised the most control over their clients and libertarians the least. The methodology included cross-sectional, dynamic and pooled regression analysis. Compliance with clinic rules was measured by levels of drug use and involvement with clinic program was measured by continuous treatment. Affiliation at all three clinic types reduced drug use at the same rate. However, involvement rates varied and were explained by a control balance approach to understanding responses to organizational type.\n\nA Self-Report Survey of Delinquency in Metro Manila\n\nDonald J. Shoemaker, VPI and SU\n\nFilomin C. Gutierrez, University of Philippines, Diliman\n\nThrough a self-report survey, data were gathered from 635 teenage respondents from 9 secondary schools in Metro Manila during the 1998-1999 school year. Students aged 12-17 were sampled from public and private, coed and exclusive high schools from all socioeconomic levels. Delinquency scores are found to be generally low among females, the middle class and students with good academic performance. Specifically, the rates were lowest among middle-class females and upper-class males and highest among lower-class males and upper-class females. Among those with high delinquency scores, female respondents and those coming from middle and upper classes (for both sexes) tended to commit status and property-related delinquents acts while lower-class males were associated with acts involving physical aggression and violence. Delinquency scores are regressed against the student’s social and academic backgrounds, along with theoretical variables, such as self-concept, degree of association with families, peers and authority figures in school and the labels that students receive from others.\n\nA Social Control Explanation of the ‘Broken Homes’ Hypothesis\n\nChristopher A. Kierkus, University of Windsor\n\nDespite the copious amount of literature that has been published regarding the influence of family structure on delinquent behavior a clear understanding of this phenomenon is yet to emerge, The majority of previous studies have only investigated if broken homes are related to misbehavior; however, they have failed to establish why this relationship exists. Some authors that have addressed this issue have attempted to use social control theory to explain their findings. However, their conclusions are frequently contradictory. The purpose of this study was to determine if the parental attachment component of social control theory could explain why family structure was related to delinquency. Multivariate logistic regression was used in the investigation. A representative sample of school children from the province of Ontario was analyzed (n=1,891). The findings suggest that family structure is a significant predictor of most self-reported delinquent behaviors both at the zero order level and when age, sex and SES are controlled. However, when parental attachment is entered into the regression equation the significant correlations between family structure and delinquency tend to disappear. This suggests that the parental attachment coponent of social control theory can provide a plausible explanation for why broken homes are linked to delinquency. Keywords: family structure, broken homes, delinquency, social control theory, parental attachment.\n\nA Spatial Analysis for Calls for Police Service: Pubs, Clubs and Cabarets in Vancouver, B.C.\n\nBrian Kinney, Simon Fraser University\n\nThe present paper explores the analytical potential of “Pattern Theory,” as developed by Brantingham & Brantingham, to explore the spatial distribution of calls for police service in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. As a theoretical framework, Pattern Theory is seen as appropriate for such a discussion for two main reasons. Firstly, pattern theory considers crime as a complex event, or process, that involves, among others, a spatial dimension. Secondly, this theoretical framework provides a host of practical, yet immediate, linkages between empirical study and urban planning. Such potential is discussed in the context of a preliminary investigation of the relationship between the location of licensed premises (bars, pubs, and cabarets) and calls for police service in various neighbourhoods of Vancouver. Using the GIS software of the Crime Prevention and Analysis Laboratory (CPAL) at Simon Fraser University, this study provides a tentative `first look’ at maps representing a variety of calls for police service and the street addresses of licensed premises.\n\nA Statewide Evaluation of Ohio’s Drug Courts: Characteristics and Outcomes?\n\nAlexander M. Holsinger, University of Cincinnati\n\nEdward J. Latessa, University of Cincinnati\n\nShelley Johnson, University of Cincinnati\n\nThe impact of the increased caseloads from an increase in drug arrests during the early part of the 1980s, created many problems for the court system. Faced with drained resources and a lack of effective options to reduce recidivism, many jurisdictions began to search for an alternative. Hence, the movement toward specialized courts began in the late 1980s. Drug courts were developed to reduce substance abuse and recidivism through techniques such as monitoring, alternative sanctions, and treatment. Given the dramatic increase of these courts, an assessment of their effectiveness is crucial. Data from a statewide evaluation will be used to describe various drug court models and discuss preliminary evaluation findings.\n\nA Test of the Divergent Validity of the Aggression Construct\n\nTodd A. Armstrong, Arizona State University West\n\nThe strong majority of criminological theories are general. General theories assume a single cause or set of causes explain all criminal and delinquent behavior. Consequently, the causal processes explicated by these theories do not distinguish between aggressive and non aggressive acts. In contrast, psychological theories explaining aggression are act specific. These theories assume that there are constructs unique to the explanation of particular kinds of behavior. This study tests the divergent validity of the aggression construct. An exploration of the divergent validity of the aggression construct provides a critical test of the assumptions of general and act specific theories. The identification of constructs that have an act specific effect on aggression would confirm the assumptions of psychological theories of aggression, while refuting the assumptions of general theory. The implications of constructs, borrowed from psychological research on social information processing, for the divergent validity of the aggression construct, are tested. An alternative specification of the standard LISREL structural equation model is used. This specification allows the estimation of both general and specific effects. Data is gathered with a scenario survey. The survey is given to a convenience sample of college undergraduates.\n\nA View From the Inside–Prisoners on the Death Penalty\n\nNorma Wilcox, Wright State University\n\nTracey Steele, Wright State University\n\nRecent research indicates that incarcerated offenders tend to favor the death penalty as a penal option. Ohio has only recently (Feb. 1999) resumed application of the death penalty. This study utilizes survey research of inmates in a Midwestern close-security prison to determine the effect, if any, the recent execution of William Berry (the first inmate to be executed in Ohio two-and-a-half decades) has had on inmates’ attitudes regarding capital punishment. We will also explore the perceived efficacy of the death penalty as a deterrent to violent crime for Ohio inmates.\n\nAcademic Integrity\n\nDavid Champion, Indiana University of Pennsylvania\n\nAn ongoing debate in criminal justice education centers on the definition of a university education in the context of students’ expectations of employment in criminal justice professions. Should the university pursue its traditional role of providing broad-based liberal arts education, or should a criminal justice education be geared to providing a more professionalized, work-oriented set of skills and knowledge? This question is partially philosophical, but we argue that the addition of empirical data is necessary in fully assessing the issue. This paper will present findings from a research project that does just that. The Employment-based Curriculum Assessment Project seeks to map the match (or mis-match) between the set of learning goals pursued by Criminal Justice and related faculty, and the set of skills and knowledge that future employers desire of Criminal Justice graduates. The primary hypothesis is that, counter to common belief, employers and faculty are more alike than different, and that both prefer students trained in a liberal arts tradition. The unique methods (both qualitative and quantitative) developed for this project will be discussed, as well as the primary findings.\n\nAchieving Justice: An Analysis of Sentencing in the Lower Criminal Courts inBangladesh\n\nMohammed Bin Kashem, University of Chittagong\n\nShawkat Mostafa, Chittagong City Corporation\n\nThe purpose of this study is to assess the sentencing practices in the lower criminal courts in Bangladesh. It is important to note that plea bargain does not exist in Bangladesh as a result, the majority of the cases go to trial. Data for the present study were collected from court records and in-depth interviewing of judicial officers. Preliminary results suggests that enormous caseloads, absence of coordination between the police and court, and modern technology have seriously hampered the proper dispension of justice in the from court syswtems of Bangladesh. Some policy recommendations are also offered.\n\nAdjudicated Health: Incarcerated Women and the Social Construction of Health\n\nM. Katherine Maeve, Medical College of Georgia\n\nWomen in prison have been identified as one of the most vulnerable groups of women in society. Women often come to prison with histories of sexual and physical abuse, substance abuse, and increased incidences of chronic mental and physical illnesses. Providing health care to this group of women is a formidable challenge to health care providers who know little of the life-ways of most women in prison. This study examined the social construction of health through weekly interviews with 20 incarcerated women over 15 months. Data also included the author’s observations and experiences of how life worked, and how health care was provided within the prison. The study was grounded within a critical hermeneutic context using interpretive methods for data analysis. Adjudicated health reflects the social construction of health for women prior to and during imprisonment, and is dually grounded in protection and punishment–a construction in direct apposition to the department of correction’s conceptualization of health as individualism and personal responsibility, a position that easily supports women’s expectations of punishment, but effectively does little to protect them or their health. Implications for the health of women during imprisonment and post-release are discussed.\n\nAdolescent Deviance, Non-Normative Timing of Role Entry, and Subsequent Adult Deviance\n\nHoward B. Kaplan, Texas A & M University\n\nShaheen Halim, Texas A & M University\n\nRecent criminological life course research finds that employment and marriage has a diminishing effect on the relationship between adolescent and adult deviance. however, not much is yet known about how off-timing, or non-normative timing of entry into adult roles affects adult deviance. These are important issues as they affect the nature and quality of adult roles which has been shown to moderate the effect of adult role attainment on adult deviance. This study attempts to add to current life course research in crime and delinquency by examining the effects of adolescent deviance on non-normative timing of entry into the roles of parent, spouse/long-term relationship partner, and worker and also upon non-normative school exit. Effects of adolescent deviance and non-normative role outcomes on subsequent adult deviance are also examined. Four Logistic regression equations and two OLS regression equations were estimated using longitudinal panel data involving a cohort of 2,240 individuals interviewed as adolescents and later as young adults (between the ages of 21 and 29). Sociodemographic correlates of gender, race, and socioeconomic status were controlled in these analyses. Adoelescent deviance significantly increases the likelihood oof all four non-normative role entries, non-normative school exit, and early entry into the workforce have positive effects on adult deviance.\n\nAdolescent Drug Use in Korea: A Test of Competing Three Theoretical Concepts\n\nSunghyun Hwang, University of Florida\n\nThe main purpose of this study is to examine empirically the major elements or concepts of three theories (social learning, social bonding, self-control theories) in competition to determine how useful they are to explaining adolescent substance use in Korea. The second purpose of this study is to investigate direct, indirect, and the relative influence of peer and parents on the use of alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and other drugs. In an attempt to overcome some of the limitations of previous research regarding the parents and peer influences on adolescent substance use, this research tests the major elements and concepts derived from three theories. The data for this investigation are from a questionnaire survey among a sample of high school students in Korea. The total sample size is more than 1,000 individuals. The questionnaire is a 125-item instrument constructed for this project. A series of hierarchical multiple regression analyses will be conduced. The main hypothesis for this study is that the major concepts derived from three theories will be entered into the equation in several steps and should account for a significant amount of variation on licit and illicit drug use by adolescents in Korea.\n\nAdolescent Illicit Druge Use: The Role of Physical Abuse, Sexual Victimization, and its Co-Occurrence\n\nDeanna M. Perez, University of Maryland\n\nThere exists the possibility that adolescents exposed to childhood maltreatment are at an increased risk for illicit drug use. Moreover, the type of outcome may be dependent upon the particular type of victimization experienced. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the role of sexual victimization, physical abuse, and the co-occurrence of both types of abuse in adolescent illicit drug use among a sample of 2,468 Mexican-American and White non-Hispanic adolescents. Specifically, the present study will address the following questions: (1) Are physical abuse, sexual victimization, and/or the cooccurrence of both related to self-reported age of onset of illicit drug use?; (2) Are physical abuse, sexual victimization, and/or the co-occurrence of both related to selfreported measures of illicit drug use?; and, (3) What are the relative effects of physical abuse, sexual abuse, and/or the co-occurrence of both on illicit drug use?\n\nAdverse Outcomes in Experiments: Methodological, Statistical and Ethical Issues\n\nAnthony A. Braga, Harvard University\n\nElin J. Waring, Lehman College – City University of NY\n\nOne consistent challenge that those who evaluate criminal justice interventions face is how to report and assess the risks of adverse outcomes. This challen~pe is multidimensional, including statistical, methodological, and ethical issues. For example, although the possibility of “backfire” effects, in which the primary outcome variable is actually made worse as a result of the intervention, has been discussed, even in this case it is not clear what standard should be applied in order to conclude that such an effect exists. Some researchers evaluate such risks using the same two-tailed test of significance for which they test for a beneficial effect. It might be argued) however, that the balancing of risks of Type I and Type II error that occurs for the selection of a significance level for a beneficial finding (in which the risks of false rejection of the null hypothesis are generally set lower than the risks of false failure to reject the null hypothesis) might not be appropriate when balancing risks concerning harmful findings. These issues are potentially more complex when negative results relate to secondary variables rather than the primary outcomes. For example, problems involving controlling for multiple tests of significance and post hoc analysis may be raised as are difficultie5 of causal attribution of harmful outcomes to the intervention absent a theoretical mechanism for such effects. Issues of how and what types of information should be collected on what researchers may assume to be unrelated adverse events are played out against the background of limited financing and the possibility of impacts on units of analysis different from those receiving the intervention. These latter concerns may be especially problematic when stakeholders are invested in the intervention and the effect on the primary,outcome variable is judged beneficial. The ethical issues raised include how, when, and to whom possible adverse effects should be reported. We explore these issues in the context of a randomized field experiment and with reference to the guidelines for such situations in the context of the clinical trials for the evaluation of drugs published by the Food and Drug Administration.\n\nAffective States and Sex Offending: A Test of Control Balance Theory\n\nPeter B. Wood, Mississippi State University\n\nThe theory of control balance (Tittle, 1995) claims that people commit t deviance/crime to correct a control imbalance–be it a control deficit or a control surplus–with the goal of extending the amount of control they can exercise in their lives. This suggests that crime allows some people to adjust their evaluations about the amount of control they enjoy in their lives. But it remains unclear what it is about doing crime that corrects a control imbalance, and how offenders experience a shift toward greater autonomy and control. Tittle argues that the principal determinant of the probability (amount) of deviance is the strength of motivation to correct a control imbalance. Analysis from a recent survey of incarcerated sex offenders reveals that the frequency and amount of offending is strongly associated with the degree to which offenders experience positive affective states (including control) during and after committing their crimes. Findings appear to lend support to the idea that the probability (amount) of deviance is related to the strength of the drive to address a control imbalance. It also seems likely that contextual factors associated with committing sex offenses enhance these positive affective states.\n\nAfrican Americans and the Military Justice System\n\nEvelyn Gilbert, Bethune – Cookman College\n\nThe U.S. military is considered the most raciallyunbiased of all American institutions, despite recent revelations of hate groups among service members. The veracity off this image is based on numerous in-house studies concluding that racism is not causative of the over-representation of African Americans in the military justice system- An analysis of cases in which African American males were ajudicated by the military justice system between 1997 iind 1995 reveals that processing (charging, pleading, and finding) of black men reinforces the criminal stereotype of an “urban inner-city” male.\n\nAfter Penal-Welfare: Social Change and Social Order in Late Modernity\n\nDavid Garland, New York University\n\nWhat new problems of security and order have been brought into being by the social and economic transformations of late modernity? How have these been thematised in the political domain? What adaptations have they prompted in everyday life and culture? And how have the political and cultural adaptations that have grown up around these problems affected our practices of crime control and criminal justice? This paper offers a theoretical account and an historical outline of these interlinked transformations and a sketch of the new grammar of crime control that they have produced.\n\nAge, Gender and Delinquency: Results From the ISRD Study\n\nJosine Junger-Tas, University of Leiden\n\nIn this paper I first examine the relation between age and delinquency in the 12 participating countries, including the age of onset. In this respect the data do suggest that the age patterns in relation to crime participation show considerable overall similarity. The second part of the paper includes the analysis of gender differences in criminal behavior. The analysis showed some interesting variations according to country. Our hypothesis is that theswe might be related to specific cultural background variables that were collected in the study, in relation to social control. In addition the paper examines the extent to which social control variables, such as family bonding and school bonding do explain gender differences in delinquent behavior, both within individual countries as well as in the combined overall sample. A multivariate HOMALS analysis of age, gender, SES and country finally considers the interactions in the relations of these variables with delinquency.\n\nAge, Life-Course Transition, and the Desistance From Crime\n\nBrenda Sims Blackwell, Georgia State University\n\nJeff Ackerman, Pennsylvania State University\n\nA number of researchers have claimed that certain life events such as marriage, employment, and entry into the military are linked to desistance from crime- Debate remains, however, about the exact causal mechanisms accounting for this desistance. The age/crime relationship clearly is intertwined with this question. Using an extension of the deterrence doctrine suggested by Grasmick and colleagues that includes informal sanction threats in the forms of shame and embarrassment, as well as formal sanction threats, we explore age-graded changes in individuals’ perceptions of the certainty and severity of sanctions when contemplating illegal behavior- We attempt to determine whether marriage, employment, education, or parenthood mediate the relationships between age and perceived threats of sanction. Consistent with previous research, we do find that the perceptions of shame and embarrassment, as well as legal sanctions, mediate the effect of age on crirne. However, the covariates of employment, marriage, education, and parenthood do not mediate the bivariate relationship between age and the sanction threat measures.\n\nAge and the Drug/Crime Nexus\n\nCharles E. Freeman, University of Delaware\n\nLana D. Harrison, University of Delaware\n\nThis paper examines the associations between drug use and criminal behavior for youth and adults from the general population. Most prior studies examining the drug/crime nexus have focused on deviant populations, but the question is whether the same relationships are evident in the general population. The data for this study consist of the 1995 National Household Survey of Drug Abuse, thereby taking advantage of the large sample size to examine associations among the relatively rare events of drug use and violence. We used logistic regression to explore the relationship among demographic characteristics, alcohol and illicit drug use, and violent and properly crime Analyses show for both the adult and the adolescent models the number of drugs consumed is directly related to violence and property crime. The adult and adolescent models differ, however, in the impact of ethnicity and gender. Adolescent males, both minority and white, have similar odds ratios for self-reported violence and property crime, but white males are at greater odds for being arrested for violence and property crime. The same pattern is obtained in the adult models except minority males are at greater odds for being arrested for violence and property crime.\n\nAge of Onset Effects in an Inner-City Sample\n\nDavid Henry, University of Illinois – Chicago\n\nDeborah Gorman-Smith, University of Illinois – Chicago\n\nPatrick H. Tolan, University of Illinois – Chicago\n\nAge of onset has been shown to be one of the most consistent and powerful predictors of serious and chronic delinquency (Tolan & Gorman-Smith, 1998). However, there is evidence that the effects may not be a simple matter of earlier onset is related to more serious delinquency (Loeber & Stouthamer-Loeber, 1998). The emerging pattern of results suggest that onset timing may be important but that the effects may vary by the social ecology of development. This presentation will focus on the predictive value of age of onset of delinquency and the pattern of onsets of increasingly serious types of delinquency over early adolescence to predict long-term involvement, ultimate seriousness of involvement, and patterns of delinquency. Utilizing six waves of data from the Chicago Youth Development Study, longitudinal patterns of involvement in delinquency of 260 male inner-city youth will be analyzed. In particular, the necessity and relative importance of age of first delinquent act for predicting chronicity and seriousness will be examined. Comparison will be made between first act and ages of onset for a serious of increasingly serious types of crime and between this behavioral indicator and contextual risk factors such as life stress, family functioning, and peer delinquency. In addition, variations in effects by type of community and ethnic group will be examined. Preliminary analyses suggest that age of onset may be a less powerful indicator of risk than in other social-ecological contexts and there is meaningful variation among the inner-city neighborhoods of this study.\n\nAIDS in a State Prison: Examining Inmate Attitudes on AIDS and Related Issues\n\nDale G. Colledge, Sam Houston State University\n\nW. Wesley Johnson, Sam Houston State University\n\nIn corrections, policy is generally developed from opinions of correctional administrators and staff. Often missing from policy decisions is input from those most directly affected by it: the inmates themselves. This analysis examines attitudes of newly released state prison inmates regarding AIDS and related issues such as predation, high risk behaviors and inmate social relations. Demographic and social history questions are included as independent measures. Interviews were conducted with newly released male and female inmates Texas state prisons. Results are discussed in light of emerging policy concerns in this area\n\nAl-Islam and Alcohol: An Empirical Analysis of the Impact of Islamic Religiosity on alcohol Use at American College Campuses\n\nSherod Thaxton, Emory University\n\nAbstract: Although Hirschi and Stark’s seminal study of the impact of religiosity on crime/deviance reported that religious beliefs had no impact on delinquency, the overwhelming majority of studies that have followed consistently find that religiosity has an inhibitory effect on certain forms criminal and deviant behavior-particularly alcohol use, drug use and other minor forms of delinquency. However these studies have been fairly limited in scope, focusing primarily on the Christian faith and denominational differences within the faith. There is reason to believe that the Islamic faith may have a greater protective effect against alcohol use than other faiths because of Islam’s explicit forbiddance of alcohol use. A limited amount of research has focused on the Islamic faith and its possible inhibitory effect on alcohol use; unfortunately these studies have neglected to examine the Muslim population within the United States. In the present analysis, I explore this relationship using data from a study collected by the Harvard University School of Public Health in 1993. Using logistic regression methods, I find that Muslim respondents are less likely to drink alcohol than respondents with no religious affiliation and less likely to drink alcohol than members of other religious faiths (i.e., Catholic, Protestant, Jewish). Suggestions for future research arc made.\n\nAlcohol and Homicide: State-Level Replication and Extension\n\nTanya Poteet, Capital University\n\nThis paper explores the causal connection of alcohol on homicide in context with other cstablishcd theories on homicide causation, including routine activities theory, social bonds theory, and economic deprivation theory. This analysis is a replication and extension of Robert Nash Parker’s book “Alcohol and Homicide, (1995). In this paper, the connection between alcohol and hornicide is examined at the state ‘ level, and a pooled cross-sectional model is used to conduct a time saxies regression analysis, Alcohol consumption is measured by sales of alcohol, and alcohol is examined in four ways: total alcohol sales, beer sales, liquor sales, and wine sales. This allows for exploration of each type of alcohol, as well as an aggregate measure of alcohol, and the potential connection of each measure to homicide. Interaction effects of alcohol with other variables that affect homicide are also explored. Tnitial resultst indicate that beer and liquor consumption are the aspects of alcohol that are causally connected to homicide, wine does tiot appear to affect homicide rates. Two major implications follow ftom these findings. By fidling to include an alcohol measure, previous homicide research has omitted a key explanatory variable. Measures of alcohol therefore are central to future homicide research.\n\nAlcohol and Violence: The Impact of Community Interventions on Violent Crime\n\nDeborah Plechner, University of California – Riverside\n\nDoreen Anderson-Facile, University of California, Riverside\n\nRobert Nash Parker, University of California – Riverside\n\nThree medium sized communities, two in California and one in South Carolina, were the subjects of a major national study in which the overall objective was to reduce alcoholrelated accidents and injuries. A number of interventions were organized and implemented in these communities, including community mobilization, legal, Responsible beverage service, drunk driving enforcement, and youth related interventions, school and community based. Reducing violence was not one of the original goals of this effort. This paper examines the impact of these multifaceted intervention directed at other targets on rates of violent crime reported to the police. Despite the fact that violence was not a target of the interventions, evidence from all three communities suggests that reducing access to and availability of alcohol in general in a community can have a significant effect on violent crime.\n\nAlcohol Consumption Behaviors, Fighting and Weapon Use: Cross-Sectional Findings From the Add-Health Study\n\nBart J. Hammig, Centers for Disease Control\n\nJanet L. Guerrero, Centers for Disease Control\n\nMonica H. Swahn, Centers for Disease Control\n\nThomas R. Simon, Centers for Disease Control\n\nPurpose: This study examined the associations between frequency of alcohol consumption, binge drinking, drinking alone, drinking consequences and reports of fighting and weapon use in fights. Methods: We analyzed cross-sectional data from the first in-home survey of the public-use dataset (N=6504) of the National Longitudinal Study on Adolescent Health (Add-Health Study). This study, conducted in 1995, included a nationally representative sample of adolescents in grades 7 through 12. Multivariate logistic regression analyses, adjusted for gender, grade, and race/ethnicity, were used to test the associations between each measure of alcohol consumption and involvement in fighting-related behaviors during the past 12 months. Results: Adolescents who reported drinking at least 2 days per month were more likely to report fighting (OR=2.40; 95%CI 2.01,2.87) and fighting with weapons (OR=5.46; 95%CI 4.01,7.44) than adolescents who did not drink. Those drinkers who reported binge drinking, drinking alone, and experiencing negative consequences from drinking were more likely to report fighting and using weapons in fights. Conclusions: These results extend our understanding of the association between alcohol use and fighting behaviors by highlighting specific alcohol consumption behaviors that are associated with risk for fighting and weapon use among adolescent drinkers.\n\nAlternative Measures for Drug Users: The Introduction of the Toronto Drug Treatment Court\n\nCarol La Prairie, Department of Justice Canada\n\nPatricia G. Erickson, Centre for Addiction & Mental Health\n\nSpecialized drug courts with mandatory treatment referral have been widely implemented in the USA in recognition of the costs and inadequacies of the traditional emphasis on criminal punishment of addicted drug users. Few experiments have been tried elsewhere, but the first such program in Canada was introduced in Toronto in 1999. While following the basic model established in the USA, the Toronto approach is grounded in the principles of both harm reduction and restorative justice, Focusing on dependent opiate and cocaine users, charged with possession or minor trafficking offences, individuals who choose to enter the program undergo a rigourous assessment and are assigned to various treatment modalities at CAMH, Along with monitoring and frequent court visits to ascertain progress, participants are also assisted with community-based needs- such-as-housing and employment. This program is being evaluated only on criteria of recidivism, cost effectiveness, treatment and health outcomes, but also on indicators of perceived well being, quality of life, autonomy and sense of justice. This presentation will describe the “start up process”, provide preliminary data and give some initial impressions of ways in which a uniquely Canadian approach is being realized.\n\nAlternatives to Incarceration for Felony Offenders in New York City\n\nDouglas Young, Vera Institute of Justice\n\nRachel Porter, The Vera Institute of Justice\n\nIn 1997 New York City implemented a new system of alternative to incarceration sentencing options for felony offenders. We will present process and outcome findings from the Vera Institute’s on-going evaluation of these programs. The ATIs are classified into special populations according to age, gender, and substance use. Data will be presented on participant needs, service delivery, case processing, and program outcomes. We will discuss treatment outcomes both in the context of individual program experience, and the special populations defined by the city. Method, and challenges in measuring program service delivery will also be addressed.\n\nAm I My Brother’s Keeper?\n\nRobert Paine, Memorial University\n\nThere are three interwoven threads to this paper First, violence before the birth of society-such was the violence of Cain. In that story there is no precedent for the notion of “brother” and Cain acted in moral ignorance so it is inappropriate to call the killing of Abel “murder.” Second, violence in a world of social rules-the one we see evolving in Old Testament stories and which we (in the Abrahamic world) have today; there can be death by murder: an act that breaks the moral rules. However, “society” itself is not unitary but fragmented. and-the third thread-the notion of loyalty is born. What is truly done in its name, including killing, may be counted as virtuous. Drawing the threads together I see violence following from an indifference to options (the case of Cain) or reduction of options. It may be that an individual or a group feels cornered and violence is seen as the only recourse. More interestingly, loyalty itself morally implies a reduction of options-hence the all-too-common association of loyalty and violence. If at the beginning of the story violence begat morality, as the human story progressed morality begets violence.\n\nAmerican Apartheid: The Incarceration of African-Americans\n\nRandall G. Shelden, University of Nevada – Las Vegas\n\nWilliam B. Brown, University of Michigan – Flint\n\nThe dramatic increase in the American prison population during the past two decades has been largely the result of the “war on drugs” (and to some extent the “war on gangs”). The impact has been most heavily felt by racial minorities, especially African-Americans. By the early 1990s African-Americans became, for the first time in history, the numerical majority in prison. Their incarceration rate increased so much that they now have a rate that is almost eight times greater than for whites. This paper explores this issue in some detail and connects the incarceration of African-Americans to two related trends: (1) the overall increase in prison populations, largely as a result of the “war on drugs” and which has resulted in a prison system that resembles the old Russian Gulags and (2) the close connection between the concentration of African-Americans in prison and apartheid-like e what existed in South Africa for so many years. We also make a connection between these trends and the changing economic system in America which has created an ever expanding underclass or what Marx called the “surplus Population” (Or “reserve army”) and attempts to ” control” or “manage” that class via the criminal justice system.\n\nAmicus Curiae Briefs: Protecting Human Rights and Preventing Executions in the United States\n\nRobin M. Lofton, ICCLHR\n\nNo longer can the death penalty be considered solely a domestic criminal law issue. Within the last thirty years, the death penalty has evolved into an international human rights concern. Yet more than ninety countries retain the death penalty and, last year, forty countries carried out executions including the United States. The U.S. is the only western country continuing to carry out executions. One of the most recent and potentially effective efforts to prevent executions (and limit the death penalty) in the United States is the submission of amicus curiae briefs. This paper discusses how European (and other non-U.S.) organizations can effectively participate in U.S. capital litigation as an amicus curiae to prevent executions and limit the death penalty. In particular, this paper focuses on how the amicus curiae can assist the court by Presenting the relevant international law and examining the U.S. obligations under such treaties as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations thereby promoting the interests of justice. The potential impact of foreign amici on the U.S. death penalty as well as the difficulties confronted by foreign amici will also be examined. The paper concludes with an examination of quasi-legal forms of amicus participation in capital litigation on with a view to ensuring justice and preventing executions.\n\nAmy Man Could be a Rapist, any Husband a Batterer, and any Possessive Lover a Stalker but for the Consequences\n\nSusan E. Eastman, University at Albany\n\nHistorically laws were written in such a way as not to disturb, and officials who enforce those laws were reluctant to interfere within, the family domain. In more recent times the police and courts have become increasingly, although minimally, involved in regulating domestic relationships. This essay contends that the causes of, and the official response to, partner sexual assault, battering, and stalking could be explained under various conventional theories. But this essay argues that these acts, of which men are almost exclusively the assailants and women the victims, could be subsumed under one broad explanatory framework, a modified radical-feminist one. These three forms of victimization of women are usually studied independently yet, these acts often occur in tandem. Since men behave, and criminal justice professionals respond to those behaviors, in much the same way; the argument proposed here is, the same explanation could inform us about all three.\n\nAn Analysis of the Challenges Facing the Assault Weapons Ban\n\nEgan Kyle Green, Indiana University of Pennsylvania\n\nThe Omnibus Crime Control Act of 1994 included a provision which was designed to stop the possession, transfer and manufacture of a specific set of firearms. These firearms were labeled as assault weapons. The Act specifically named nineteen firearms and prohibited any others which met a specific set of criteria. This ban is proving to be difficult to enforce due to a number of unplanned problems. Furthermore, its effectiveness at reducing crime is questionable. The roundtable discussion focuses on the challenges which have plagued the ban. These problems include copycat weapons, ambiguous defining of assault weapons, and an explanation of the cosmetic changes that the ban requires for weapons as opposed to the effectual changes.\n\nAn Analysis of Web-Based Educational Tools in the Criminology/Criminal Justice Field\n\nFrank Schmalleger, The Justice Research Association\n\nThe paper discusses a variety of Web-based tools and sites useful in support of criminology/criminal justice-oriented distance learning. Tools and sites are evaluated according to selected criteria of usefulness, and rankins are presented.\n\nAn Assessment of Private vs. Public Juvenile Justice Education Programs\n\nChristopher P. Krebs, Florida State University\n\nThomas G. Blomberg, Forida State University\n\nThe relationship between poor school performance and juvenile delinquency has been well established in the research literature. Improving academic achievement is an important step in reducing or preventing juvenile crime. Oftentimes, the best opportunity to improve academic achievement for at-risk youth involves the provision of effective educational services in juvenile justice programs. Comparing the educational services provided by various juvenile justice programs will indicate which programs are most effective in improving academic achievement for at-risk youth, thus reducing or preventing recidivism. A growing trend in juvenile justice is the privatization of juvenile justice programs. Due to the newsness of this trend, there is no research comparing the quality of educational services provided by publicly and privately operated programs. This research makes such a comparison of juvenile justice programs in the State of Florida. Unfortunately, preliminary findings suggest that the educational services delivered by privately operated juvenile justice programs may not be as effective as those delivered by publicly operated programs. The research indicates that this trend towards juvenile jsutice privatization may diminsh the quality of educational services being delivered to Florida’s juvenile delinquents.\n\nAn Ethnographic Study of the Explanation and Prevention of Soccer Violence\n\nMegan O’Neill, University of Aberdeen\n\nSoccer has been the most popuiar sport in Britain as for over a century. Scotland has the largest number of professional clubs per capita in the UK (Moorhouse 1984). A consistent feature of any professional match, besides the fans and the players, is the police. However, the role this group plays in the overall experience of a soccer game has been the subject of very little research. Much theory-based research has been undertaken in the past 30 years to study groups of violent soccer fans, or ‘hooligans’ (e.g. Dunning et a]. 1988). More recently, etlnography has been used to better understand the culture and lifestyle of hooligans from their perspective (e.g. Giulianotti 1991, Armstrong 1998). My research takes an ethnographic approach to investigate the culture of soccer policing and the relationships that exist between the fans and the law enforcers. My study is based on the Grampian Police in Aberdeen, Scotland and the home games of Aberdeen Football Club. This paper will discuss my experience of using ethnography in studying a police force and the benefits and limitations I encountered. I will highlight my findings from this approach on how the police explain and attempt to prevent of soccer violence.\n\nAn Ethnographic Study of the Heterogeneity and Utilization of Social Capital Within Urban Communities and Families: Implications for the Success of Young-at-Risk African-American Males\n\nJoseph B. Richardson, Jr., The Vera Institute of Justice\n\nFurstenberg (1999) notes that the presence or absence of social capital in a community may be an important link between the structure of communities, families and the development of children. However, the lack of emphasis on the resources and strategies used by at-risk adolescents and their families to avoid delinquency and to foster successful development in distressed urban environments has contributed to fostering social policies that have moved away from focusing on parenting. Crime prevention and welfare reform policies and programs have neglected the agency and power of poor families to create strategies to help their children to “make it.” This paper lends great insight into understanding how children and their families attempt to cope with problems of violence and aggression within a socially and economically distressed inner-city community. It offers a means of examining the social resources, strategies and social networks used by at-risk adolescent African-American males and their families to succeed in an environment often depleted of resources and hope.\n\nAn Evaluation of Alternative Community-Based Treatment Programs for Youthful Offenders\n\nHao Nguyen, Michigan State University\n\nTimothy S. Bynum, Michigan State University\n\nTodd G. Beitzel, Michigan State University\n\nWilliam S. Davidson, Michigan State University\n\nThis paper presents the results of an evaluation of day treatment programs in Michigan. These programs were instituted as part of an initiative to develop and implement community-based treatment programs designed to provide much needed services to state ward-delinquent youth. This study consisted of two components-a process evaluation and an impact evaluation. The process evaluation was undertaken to examine and document the process of program implementation and development. The impact evaluation consisted of comparing youth placed in day treatment programs with concurrent and historical samples of youth placed in traditional residential treatment programs on a number of dimensions including family and peer relations, school attitudes and behaviors, family and community involvement, attitudes toward deviance, community attachment, alcohol and drug use, and recidivism. Additionally, day treatment programs were compared to traditional residential programs with regard to program cost. This paper will present the results related to program implementation, recidivism, and cost.\n\nAn Evaluation of the Chester County (PA) Drug Court Program\n\nMary P. Brewster, West Chester University\n\nThe Chester County (PA) Drug Court Program was evaluated by analyzing iuntake and post-discharge data to determine changes in participants’ legal involvement (i.e. rearrests), vocational status, housing status, and substance use. Comparison between participants and a matched non-participant control group demonstrate the impact of the program. Statistical comparisons of Addiction Severity Index (ASI) composite scores from intake and 90-days post-discharge are also presented.\n\nAn Evaluation of the TCU Drug Screen\n\nD. Dwayne Simpson, Texas Christian University\n\nKevin Knight, Texas Christian University\n\nMatthew L. Hiller, Texas Christian University\n\nAlthough most criminal justice agencies across the United States have become invested in treating drug-abusing offenders in the past decade, the demand for treatment resources has continued to exceed availability. Not only must officials decide who should have access to limited treatment services, but they also need to determine the most appropriate type and intensity of treatment in which a drug-involved offender should be placed. These critical decisions are complicated even further in large correctional systems such as the Texas Department of Criminal Justice (TDCJ), which processes over 3,300 new inmates per month. For these agencies, improved drug abuse screening and treatment referral protocols are essential. To meet this demand, the TCU Drug Screen (which has been adopted by TDCJ) was developed recently, and the purpose of this presentation is provide an overview of the instrument, psychometric information, and its association with 3-year post-incarceration outcomes.\n\nAn Evaluation of the Virginia Alcohol and Safety Action Program Habitual Offender Intervention Program\n\nDon Hardenbergh, Court Works\n\nFred Cheesman II, National Center for State Courts\n\nThe Virginia Habitual Offender Project is an intervention program intended to prevent offenders who have accumulated a second qualifying traffic offense (e.g., DWI or driving with a suspended license) from being declared “habitual offenders”. Persons accumulating three or more separate qualifying traffic violation convictions within a ten year period can be determined to be an habitual offender and have their license and driving privileges revoked. Qualifying offenders are ordered to report to a Virginia Alcohol and Safety Action Program (VASAP) within 30 days or their driving privileges will be suspended. A case management approach is used to develop an individualized program appropriate for each referral to the habitual offender program. Programmatic interventions offered by VASAP include, for example, substance abuse counseling and treatment, education programs, ordered driver improvement, and aggressive driver classes. The impact evaluation of the Habitual Offender Project was conducted using three approaches, a time series regression analysis (measuring the change in the probability that qualified offenders became habitual offenders, pre- and post-program implementation), a time series intervention analysis (examining impact of the program on motor vehicle accidents), and a panel study (examining the impact of VASAP Program elements on the probability of being declared a habitual offender.\n\nAn Evolutionary-Based Model of the Characteristics of Sexually Aggressive Men\n\nNeil M. Malamuth, University of California – Los Angeles\n\nIn ancestral environments in which the human mind evolved, males could achieve reproductive success by engaging in strategies that involved “converging” or “diverging” interests with those of females. Psychological mechanisms evolved designed to increase effectiveness in each of these types of strategies, with early life experiences calibrating relevant mechanisms to prepare the individual for later interactions. Using this conceptual framework, a model of the characteristics of men who use sexually coercive tactics is presented. It integrates many seemingly independent correlates of sexual aggressors within 3 major constellations of characteristics: (1) a general personality orientation to assert one’s own interests at the expense of others; (b) a short-term mating orientation likely to create a conflict of interests with females; and (c) a constellation of emotions and attitudes priming coercive tactics for dealing with strategic interference or conflict. While each of these three constellations makes a unique contribution to the likelihood that a man will use sexual coercion, it is argued that their confluence is particularly likely to characterize sexual aggressors. A series of interrelated hypothesis derived from this model is described and supporting data are presented. The relevance of the model is discussed within the context of samples from the general population as well as mentally disordered offenders. Finally, the relationship of this model to research on psychopathy is considered.\n\nAn Examination of Legal Presentation for Indigent Offenders in the State of Texas\n\nRobert L. III Bing, University of Texas – Arlington\n\nAn examination/evaluation of legal presentation for indigent offenders int he state of Texas. Emphasis is on capital crimes, race and gender of victim and offender as well as the type of counsel received. Recommendations for improvement and change will be offered.\n\nAn Examination of Race/Ethnicity Differences in the “Cycle of Violence”\n\nCathy Spatz Widom, University at Albany\n\nJorge Chavez, University at Albany\n\nPrevious literature has established a link between childhood victimization and subsequent delinquency, adult criminal behavior, and violent arrest. Yet research on the “cycle of violence” (Maxfield & Widom, 1996) reveals differences by race/ethnicity in the risk of arrest for violence among victims of childhood victimization. This presentation identifies a number of possible explanations for the apparent race/ethnicity differences and tests the adequacy of these explanations for understanding the discrepancy. We use a data set based on a prospective cohort design which follows a large groups of abused/neglected children and a matched control group into young adulthood, Implications for future research and intervention are discussed.\n\nAn Examination of the Effects on Children When Their Parents Go To Prison\n\nKim Cattat, SUNY – University of Buffalo\n\nEach year, several hundred thousand of America’s parents are incarcerated. While there exists a multitude of research on the prison inmate experience general, little has been written about the experience of being a parent in prison. Furthermore, even less focus has been spent on the children of the prisoners and those who care for them during their parent’s incapacitation This paper surveys the literature regarding the effects of incarceration on the children of inmates. Suggestions for future research will also be presented.\n\nAn Examination of the Relationship Between Work-Specific Stress and Substance Use: Direct and Indirect Effects\n\nCheng-hsien Lin, Texas A & M University\n\nHoward B. Kaplan, Texas A & M University\n\nShaheen Halim, Texas A & M University\n\nWe examine the relationship of work-specific stress (work stress, job dissatisfaction and rewards), negative self-feelings and substance use. Subjects are 4,155 young adults (age 2136) from the 4th wave of a longitudinal Study. The analysis uses the LISREL VIII to estimate a structural model with latent constructs. Two perspectives of organizational psychology inform an analysis: “alienation” and “generalization”. The former postulates that work-specific alienation is most salient, while the latter suggests that generalized stress is more predictive of fluctuations in substance use. Literature shows equivocal evidences to date. In light of House’s (1987) discussion of “cognitive stress” and “affective stress”, we hypothesize that work-specific stress will increase workers’ negative self-feelings and in turn increase their level of substance use. Moreover, since-work-specific stress is more cognitive than affective in nature, it will not increase workers’ substance use while negative self-feelings is considered. The results show that most of our hypotheses are supported when gender and race are controlled. However, work stress has direct causal effect on substance use among males, while this is not the case among females, whites, or nonwhites. Among nonwhites, work stress does not predict negative self-feelings and negative self-feelings does not predict their substance use.\n\nAn Examination of the State of Precedent in the U.S. Federal Cirt Court of Appeals\n\nSusan F. Brinkley, University of Tampa\n\nPrecedent is the basis of our legal system. When cases are filed, both civil and criminal, the assumption is made that the current case will be treated like previous cases as to matters of law. This assumption is critical to the stability and consistency of our legal system. In the largely unexamined Federal Circuit Courts of Appeals the concept of precedent is being called into quesiton. The current practice of unpublished opinions at the Federal Circuit level will be examined to determine the frequency of nonreliance upon precedent, specifically in the area of correctional litigation. In Circuits such as the Fourth where about 90% of all opinions are unpublished, one wonders how many of these did not follow precedent and conversely how many may have established new precedent were they to be published. Since unpublished opinions are not binding on future cases, the research question to be examined is: What is the current state of precedent at the Circuit Courts level of the federal judiciary? This research will examine cases dealing with correctional litigation for selected Circuits to answer that question. The analysis of the unpublished opinions will categorize cases as (1) not following precedent or (2) setting new precedent, if published.\n\nAn Experimental Evaluation of a Long Term Prevention Program Designed to Break the Intergenerational Cycle of Delinquence and Crime\n\nChristopher D. Maxwell, Michigan State University\n\nChun-Hao Li, Michigan State University\n\nLori Wibert, Michigan State University\n\nTom Kuecker, Michigan State University\n\nThis paper will report results of an experiment that evaluated a controlled longitudinal delinquency and antisocial behavior prevention program. This experimental program began in 1989 and targets families and children of inmates incarcerated for morns than five years. Intensive social work case management techniques were used to provide one-on-one and small group programming to reduce risk factors for delinquency and antisocial behaviors, and increase the protective factors. The analysis will focus on changes on the children’s level of risk and protective factors over the eight year, of follow-up and examine differences across experimental groups on self-reported antisocial and delinquent behaviors over the follow-up period, teachers’ reports of pro-social and antisocial behavior of children in school, and cognitive development measured by standardized aptitude tests.\n\nAnalysis of Data Collection and Statistical Research on Crime in Argentina\n\nAlejandra Perriello, Direccion Nacional De Politica Criminal\n\nGervasio Landivar, Direccion Nacional De Politica Criminal\n\nHernan Olaeta, Direccion Nacional De Politica Criminal\n\nMariana Siga, Direccion Nacional De Politica Criminal\n\nThe paper consists of an analysis of data collection and statistical research on crime in Argentina, describing the three sources of criminal information currently used: police, judicial files and victimization surveys. It includes a description of what has been done in recent years and current plans for the improvement of crime analysis, an overview on the research methods and the sources used in each case. Priority discussion given to the problem of urban crime in the most populated cities in Argentina, the measurement of crime at the national level and coordinating activities with different governmental agencies.\n\nAnalyzing the Relationships Between Probation Terms, Probation Violations, Correctional Responses to Violations and Deterrence\n\nSheila Royo Maxwell, Michigan State University\n\nProbation and community-based sanctions have increased considerably in the last few years. Consequently, several studies have examined the viability of these sanctions in preventing crime and reducing recidivism, with mixed results. Recidivism, for example, had been recorded from a low of 20 percent in some studies to a high of almost 60 percent in others. Interestingly, most of these studies seldom examined violations beyond those that elicited formal responses. Violations that are informally dealt with are often ignored, consequently limiting our understanding of the impact of different types of informal interventions on probationers’ subsequent behaviors and ultimately, recidivism. This paper examines multiple factors that can hypothetically affect the behaviors of probationers besides the static demographic and criminal history measures. Examined are probation terms, specifically the multiplicity of restrictions ordered, the types and numbers of offenders’ violations, the types of informal interventions taken by probation officers for violations, and the deterrent effects of both formal and informal interventions on subsequent behaviors by probationers. Implications for policy are discussed.\n\nAnti-Gang Legislation: The Newest Weapon in the War on Gangs?\n\nDeborah Plechner, University of California – Riverside\n\nValerie J. Callanan, University of California – Riverside\n\nIn the last decade a flurry of legislation aimed at reducing gang activity has been enacted, including anti-gang statutes, sentencing enhancements, and civil injunctions and curfews. The support and passage of this legislation is based in part on stereotypical views of gangs promoted by law enforcement agencies, politicians, the media, and, in some measure, criminologists and other social scientists. This paper critically examines the proliferation and consequences of anti-gang legislation in light of the distortions surrounding the issues of gangs in America. After detailing anti-gang legislation at the federal and state levels, a more thorough analysis of municipal efforts (civil injunctions and curfews) is provided. The abundance of legal scholarship pertaining to these civil “remedies” reveals several problems, including their constitutionally questionable status. This abundance is contrasted with the scant amount of criminological research examining the impact of these laws on gang-related crime. A critical perspective on anti-gang legislation relates their passage to the historical legacy of laws aimed at limiting the freedoms of racial minorities and communities. A critical view also connects anti-gang laws to more recent trends, such as aspects of the “new penology (Feeley & Simon, 1992)” and the overall punitive shift in the treatment of juveniles.\n\nAnti-Gang Statutes and Racial Politics\n\nDeAnza Valencia, Arizona State University\n\nDonald Tibbs, Arizona State University\n\nMarjorie Zatz, Arizona State University\n\nThis paper represents an initial effort to examine anti-gang statutes in selected states as well as federal legislation. We explore variation in the types of statutes developed and relate these to regional, political, and demographic differences. Building on this legal analysis, we conduct a content analysis of major newspapers in the selected states to assess their depictions of gang problems in the months preceding and following votes on major legislative anti-gang initiatives. The media analysis facilitates assessment of whether and how a moral panic about gangs was constructed by the local press, police, and politicians. We are particularly concerned with the social construction of the problem population in terms of race, ethnicity, gender, and age, and with how and why a legal response to the problem was invoked.\n\nApplications of GIS to Space and Crime in the City of Edmonton\n\nDavid Veitch, Edmonton Police Service\n\nJonathan D. Alston, University of Alberta\n\nLeslie W. Kennedy, Rutgers University\n\nM. John Hodgson, University of Alberta\n\nOver the past four years crime data has been gathered by the authors for the purpose of examining the effect of place on crime. It has been found that there exists in the city of Edmonton a number of rigidly defined areas that have, in large measure, resisted criminal activity over the past four years despite their criminal potential and proximity to criminogenic centres or “hot spots.” The authors examine several possible explanations for the existence of these stable “cold spots” including spatial access and social organization of the areas in question.\n\nApplying Black’s Theory of Law to City-Level Homicide Clearance Rates\n\nKaren F. Parker, University of Florida\n\nMarian J. Borg, University of Florida\n\nAlthough national crime-fighting expenditures in the US have increased dramatically over the last 20 years, clearance rates have not improved significantly. And while arrests are more likely in homicides compared to other offenses, even these cases often go unresolved. To the extent that they reflect citizens’ willingness to participate in police investigations and because they indirectly indicate the amount of police effort devoted to a case, clearance rates can be understood as a structural level indicator of the mobilization of law. Based on this interpretation, this research explores the utility of Black’s theory of law to explain differences in the homicide clearance rates of large cities in the U.S. Black proposes that the quantity of law mobilized in response to conflict varies with equality, morphology, culture, organization and other social control. Using principal components and regression analyses, we examine the impact of various social structural characteristics on city-level homicide clearance rates. We evaluate the proposition that homicide clearance rates will be highest in cities with (1) low levels of inequality; (2) high proportions of socially integrated, (3) welleducated and (4) organized individuals; and (5) low levels of alternative social control strategies, such as violence.\n\nAre Children Being Seen or Heard?: An Evaluation of the Implementation and Effectiveness of the Provisions for Child Witnesses Under Sections 486 and 715.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada\n\nNicole Mahussier, Simon Fraser University\n\nChild sexual abuse is an insidious and pervasive problem in Canada, as well as many other nations. The recognition of this problem has lead to an increase in the prosecution of child sexual abuse allegations and, therefore, to an increase in the number of children involved in the criminal court process as victims and witnesses. This increased child involvement has highlighted the fact that the adversarial system was not designed or intended for children. As a result, some rules of evidence and procedure have been adapted in an attempt to address the problems associated with child witnesses and their testimony. Sections 486 and 715.1 of the Criminal Code of Canada set out a number of provisions designed to assist children in giving evidence when they are victims of sexual abuse. The author of this paper explores the implementation and effectiveness of these provisions since their enactment in 1988 by interviewing defence lawyers and crown counsel about their experiences with child sexual abusde victims in general and those provisions in particular. Finally, the author offers some preliminary conclusions about the merit of these provision and recommendations for more effective means of dealing with child witness and their testimony.\n\nArtificial Boundaries Between Criminology and Minority Groups in New Jersey: Inside and Outside of the Classroom\n\nJohn P. Myers, Rowan University\n\nThere are many intersections in the material covered in the two popular undergraduate courses of Criminology and Minority Groups. Minority Groups courses traditionally focus on race and ethnicity and Criminology–using the traditional definition of crime–tends to see racial and ethnic minorities as committing a disproportional amount of crime. This is true especially in the area of illegal drugs. This intersection that some see as very real has come to light outside of the classroom in the State of New Jersey where the head of the State Police was recently fired as a result of the racial profiling. This is a practice where state police officers target minority males because they believe it is more likely that minority males are drug dealers and/or transporters. Additionally, minorities are over represented in most arrest categories and in prison. I find myself talking about many of the same topics in both classes. This overlap becomes clearer when the instructor uses a conflict perspective. The connection between minority groups, drugs, crime, and prisons has been clearly delineated by Angela Davis. She refers to the “prison industrial complex” which she believes has been increasingly funneling young minority males into prisons for drug and drug-related crimes.\n\nAssessing Lethal Violence Through Criminal Justice Matrix\n\nQ. Akin Adeseun, Pennsylvania State University\n\nThe NCVS (National Crime Victimization Survey) is used to examine the effects of victim-offender relationship and gender on reasons why victims report or fail to report assaults to the police. Our results suggest that self-protection is a key motive for calling the police when victims are attacked by family members or anyone else they know. In addition, victims of domestic violence are likely to view the kinds of incidents reported in victimization surveys as more serious than are victims of stranger violence. Concerns about self-protection and judgements of seriousness thus appear to increase the likelihood that victims report domestic violence, while privacy concerns and the victim’s desire to protect the offender inhibit victims from reporting family members and others they know. We suggest that these offsetting factors explain the seemingly anomalous finding in past research that victims in the NCVS are just as likely to call the police when family members assault them as when strangers assault them.\n\nAssessing Lighting Values Through GIS Strategies\n\nJohn G. Hayes, SPARTA Consulting Corporation\n\nThe integration of GIS with Light Meters is discussed both in regard to the theoretical and practical implications for the study of crime in multifamily environments. There has been much discussion about the relationship between crime and lighting and the fear of crime and lighting. However, there is little empirical work demonstrating such a linkage. This paper will report the results of mapping light values and crime incidents in low-income public housing communities.\n\nAssessing Predictors of Alcohol and Drug Use Among Minority Adolescents\n\nC. Robert Fenlon, North Carolina Central University\n\nDavid Higdon, Duke University\n\nIn this research relationships are examined between predictor factors on alcohol and drug use among minority adolescents. Specifically, the adolescent predictor factors examined are family support, peer/social support, behavior adaptation, self-concept, school commitment, interpersonal competence, school performance (Iowa Achievement Test and grades), parental drug use and parental support. Data for this research wow collected from six public middle schools, as well as from the respondent’s parent(s)/guardian(s), in Alabama . The comprised sample size is 383 respondents, Two applications were used for data collection. First, group administration was used to colleet the scholastic aptitude school based performance measures and the interpersonal competence scale of the adolescent. Additionally, the Interpersonal Competency Battery Scale of the adolescent was collected as well. The second application used was self report individual interviews of adolescents, their peers and their parents/gaurdians. For reliability of coding and data entry, two independent data entries were used and then compared for random error.\n\nAssessing School-Based Substance Use Prevention Programs: The Gap Between Research and Practice\n\nAmy A. Vincus, Research Triangle Institute\n\nChristopher L. Ringwalt, Research Triangle Institute\n\nJudy M. Thorne, Research Triangle Institute\n\nKerrie E. Boyle, Research Triangle Institute\n\nMatthew C. Farrelly, Research Triangle Institute\n\nSusan T. Ennett, Universit North Carolina at Chapel Hill\n\nAfter three decades of research devoted to developing and testing school-based programs to prevent youth substance use, much has been learned about which approaches show more promise for effectiveness. While virtually all schools now include some measure of substance use programming, relatively little is known about the nature of such efforts. The School-Based Substance Use Prevention Programs Study is a national study of middle school teachers and school district substance use prevention coordinators designed to assess the types of school-based substance use prevention programs currently in place in public and private schools. Of specific interest are 1) determining the extent to which classroom curricula with features of programs known to be effective have been adopted and implemented and 2) assessing factors associated with the adoption of effective classroom programs. In this presentation, we will report on the gap between what is relative to what should be in classroom programs, suggesting the gap between research and practice. We also will identify those barriers identified by school personnel for implementing promising programs\n\nAssessing the Dimensions and Scope of Wrongful Convictions: An Examination of all Post-Furman Releases From Arizona’s Death Row\n\nWilliam S. Lofquist, SUNY at Geneseo\n\nWrongful convictions have conic to occupy all important position in the public consciousness and debate surrounding tile death penalty. A number of cases, particularly those of Clarence Lee Brandley. Walter McMillan, Randall Dale Adams, the Ford Heights Four, and Anthony Porter, are well-known and widely discussed. The existence of scores additional cases, approximately 75 in all, is also widely accepted. However, in tile absence of any systematic processes for identifying the occurrence of wrongful convictions, we also lack any systematic information on their frequency. Willi more than 2.000 releases from death row since 1973, it may be that there are many more than 75 factually wrongful convictions. How many cases escaped our attention before wrongful convictions became a public issue or because the attorneys and clients involved were unable for various reasons to draw attention to their case? This research seeks to shed some light on these questions by looking systematically at each or the 78 individuals released from Arizona’s death row between 1973-1999. These cases are examined and categorized based on the types of errors leading to release, with particular attention to the frequency of factually wrongful convictions.\n\nAssessing the Efficacy of Travis Hirschi’s Social Bond Theory for Explaining Alcohol Consumption for First and Second Generation Immigrants and White Youth\n\nJessica S. Davis, Michigan State University\n\nThis paper explores the efficacy of the social bond theory for explaining explaining the drinking behavior of first- and second-generation immigrants and white youth. The data that is utilized is the first follow-up of the National Educational Longitudinal Study, July 1998. The initial results indicate that social bond theory is more applicable to explaining the drinking behavior of white youth than for first- or second-generation immigrant youth.\n\nAssessing the Movement to Save Criminology at Berkeley\n\nRichard Schauffler, Judicial Council of California\n\nPublications written by this author and other students at the distinguished UC Berkeley School of Criminology recorded the events leading to the closing of the School. These publications included analytic assessments that may be useful in light of the later development of an umbrella organization, the Division of Critical Criminology, in the American Society of Criminology, which is devoted to critical examination of juridical and non juridical institutions for controlling crime as well as criminogenic cau"
