        "text": "An Introduction to Serra\n\nThe need for more vocations\n\nLet's take a look at the numbers. The number of religious sisters continues to decrease. The number of priestly ordinations have averaged about 500 annually since 1980. And so the number of priests continues to fall and the number of parishes without a resident priest continues to rise. All of this decline while the Catholic population has increased, until recently. In fact, if we had the same number of priests and religious sisters now that we had in 1970, the greatly increased Catholic population in 2015 would still be under-served despite the increased number of permanent Deacons and the rise in lay ministries.\n\nDecline in Vocations\n\n1970 2010 2015 2019 Catholic Population 54.1 million 78.3 million 75.4 million 72.4 million Priests 59,192 39,993 37,578 35,529 Ordinations 805 459 515 468 Parishes without resident priest/pastor 571 3,353 3,533 3,572 Permanent Deacons n/a 16,649 18,082 18,193 Religious Sisters 160,931 57,544 48,546 42,441\n\nFor the source and more information about these and other statistics click HERE\n\nSerra Purpose and Mission\n\nSerra has two missions: the first is to pray for, encourage support and affirm vocations to the priesthood and religious life; the second, equally important, is to deepen the faith of individual Serrans and strengthen their personal relationship with Jesus Christ so that they may become His more devoted disciples.\n\nHistory of Serra and Serra KCK\n\nBy: Jim Wilson, a member of Serra since 1993\n\nSerra began as a Catholic businessmen’s club in Seattle, Washington in 1934 and has since spread worldwide. Serra is recognized as the lay vocation arm of the Catholic Church. The KCK Serra Club is one of the largest clubs in the United States. There are approximately 550 Serra clubs worldwide.\n\nSerra KCK began in 1970 at the request of then Archbishop Ignatius Strecker and has been strongly supported by his successors, Archbishop James Keheler and Archbishop Joseph Naumann.\n\nPrior to the founding of our Club in 1970 there was a group of Catholic men of the Archdiocese who were members of the Catholic Layman's Conference, an organization that served Archbishop Edward Hunkeler in an advisory capacity. When Archbishop Strecker succeeded Archbishop Hunkeler, he made it known that one of his top priorities was to have a Serra club in the Archdiocese. Archbishop Strecker gave them the option of continuing as the Conference or forming a Serra club. They decided to become Serrans, and the Conference was disbanded.\n\nThese leaders of the new Club represented the Greatest Generation. Having survived the Great Depression and World War II, these men had a unique understanding of the important things in our lives and a deep appreciation of their Catholic faith. Mike Sambol was the first president.\n\nThe new Serra Club met twice a month over lunch at the Terrace Club in Kansas City, Kansas as the Layman’s Conference had done. Due to new member growth, they were soon required to move to the nearby Holiday Inn. The twice-monthly lunch continues with Serra. Jim Owens would bring Archbishop Strecker to every meeting he could attend. He preferred sitting with the members rather than at a head table.\n\nThe core of the early membership recruited new members from parishes as we do today. The directory says there were 51 members when chartered.\n\nWhen the Club began, there was a minor seminary at Savior of the World in Wyandotte County. The late Very Rev. Thomas Culhane was the rector, as well as the first chaplain of our Club. The members supported the seminarians in various ways. In the event of a play or other activity at the Seminary, all members were encouraged to support it through the use of a phone committee. A picnic was held for all of the seminarians at Savior each summer. Member Maurice Reno owned property at 135th St. and Metcalf. It had picnic areas and a ball field. In the summer, college age and older seminarians were guests for a picnic. The Priests played the seminarians in a ball game. Archbishop Strecker took his turn at bat.\n\nThere was neither a Priest and Seminarian golf and dinner then, nor was there much contact with the religious sisters. Most of the vocation efforts revolved around prayer and encouraging parishes to pray the Serran prayer for vocations at Mass. Members would attach the prayer card in hymnals to encourage its use.\n\nFather Ray Davern and Monsignor Thomas Tank were both respective rectors of the seminary and chaplains of our club in those years. Fr. Davern was later president of Donnelly College. Another clergyman who had a great relationship with our members was Bishop Marion Forst. After serving in the Navy in WWII, he was bishop of the Dodge City, Kansas Diocese for 16 years. He served as Auxiliary Bishop of our Archdiocese for 10 years. During his service to the Archdiocese and in retirement, he attended many of our meetings as our special guest.\n\nActivities were increasing and a new one was added in 1980-1981. The first Priest Seminarian golf and dinner outing was the idea of George LaHood, club president that year. Golf was at Sunflower Hills and the dinner was at Mike Sambol’s farm. Twenty-eight attended. George Gorman, who was an officer at Sambol Meat Packing, became the master chef of the steak dinner. He and his wife, Virginia, prepared the side dishes for many years. After a few years, Serran Rick Wiseman, started assisting George. Rick is now filling George’s shoes in what is now known as the Famous George Gorman dinner.\n\nEntering into this time of the Club, the religious vocation landscape had changed. Monsignor Tank was a seminarian in the early sixties and one of 53 seminarians of our diocese at St. John’s Seminary in Denver. Yes, that’s right, 53. Compare that with the number in the early 1980’s of 10 to 15.\n\nThis reversal of fortune called for an increased effort on the part of our Club. More Serrans were needed and more activities as well. Fortunately, Serra had the answer, a plan of action consisting of Pray, Invite, Encourage, and Affirm. It would take all of them to reverse the downward trend.\n\nOur Club was at the disposal of Archbishop Strecker and the Vocation Director. Father Dennis Wait was the Director at that time, on a part- time basis. He was the first Director to form a committee consisting of himself, Father Jim Ludwikoski, and Sister Mary Schweiger, OSB. They often had events for aspiring candidates that would include both women and men. They would meet a couple times a year with their contemporaries from dioceses in our Region 9 of Serra, exchanging ideas.\n\nIn keeping with the Serran plan our Club designed activities to answer each part of the plan. In terms of prayer, we participated in prayer at our meetings, attended Vocation Masses, formed 31 Clubs in parishes whereby parishioners choose the same day each month to pray for vocations at Mass or in front of the Blessed Sacrament. Invite, the second area was probably the most difficult for us. The 6th-grade essay was a way to introduce religious vocations to young people. The Call by Name Program, a unique parish activity developed by Serra International, where parishioners “called out” certain younger members names who the parishioner felt had qualities consistent with a religious vocation.\n\nEncourage and affirm were easier to accomplish. From the Priest Appreciation Luncheon to visits to rural Priests, we were active. The Priest Appreciation event was held each year to recognize the Quinquennial Anniversary of our Priests, including the Monks of St. Benedicts. When Monsignor Mullen became our Chaplain, he gave a short bio of each honoree. It started as a dinner, but conflicts of scheduling caused it to be moved to a luncheon event. Visits to rural Priests were made by Serrans in pairs. It usually involved a tour of the parish by the Priest and lunch at a café.\n\nFinally, the Nuns’ picnic, as we called it, started in the late 1980s. It was organized by George and Virginia Gorman. Since we had several activities for the benefit of our Priests it was felt we needed to do likewise for the Nuns. The first several were held at Wyandotte County Park. Jim and Charlene Conrad as co-chairpersons moved it to Pierson Park also in KCK. It had a small lake for fishing, room for volleyball and a shelter house. It was common to see the nuns competing in volleyball in their habits. It was later moved to St. Peters Parish Center. George was able to convince several local businesses to volunteer prizes for winners.\n\nOne area of our support of seminarians has not been mentioned. This support was, and is, in the form of financial assistance. From the very beginning, our Club attempted to provide some assistance to the seminarians, primarily for their personal needs. The Archdiocese maintained their schooling cost. Our contribution was to augment what the Archdiocese provided. We called it the Seminarian Book Fund. All members were encouraged to contribute to it in addition to quarterly dues. These funds were kept apart from our operating monies and are distributed to them twice a year. Many priests of today will attest to the importance to them of our gift when they were in seminary.\n\nThe Serran footprint in the Archdiocese began to grow. Up until now, our Club was the only one active. On March 2, 1991, the Serra Club of Topeka was chartered. Our club was the sponsor. Father Norbert Lickteig of Christ the King parish was their first Chaplain.\n\nA major change in the life of our Archdiocese occurred when Archbishop Strecker retired in June of 1993 after serving 24 years. Archbishop grew up in Spearville, Kansas, a farming community. He was dedicated to farm families, appearing numerous times before State and National committees on their behalf. He also was extremely committed to Right to Life, condemning abortion. He called out Kathleen Sibelius, then a representative in the legislature, for her stance on abortion. Finally, he was a visionary. He prepared the diocese for growth, especially in Johnson County, by purchasing sites for parish church locations long before they were built.\n\nOn June 23, 1993, Bishop James P. Keleher became our Archbishop. An Irishman from Chicago, Arch Jim, as he liked to be called, had been Bishop of Belleville, Ill. and before that had served as Rector of Mundelein Seminary. Archbishop Keleher quickly visited as many places and met as many people in the Archdiocese as possible. Everyone loved his friendliness, sense of humor, and three-point homilies. At the time of his installation there were four men in seminary for our Archdiocese. Arch Jim made it very clear that vocations would have priority in his plans.\n\nDr. Jim Pretz became District Governor in 1996-97. While District Governor our club had written to Serra International complaining about the cost of dues as, well as, how the monies were being spent. Our USA Clubs were carrying most of the load supporting Serra International. At the next board meeting Dr. Pretz appeared uninvited. He quickly presented us with our choices: pay our dues and remain a Serra Club; don’t pay and we would no longer be a Serra Club, “nuff said.” Since then, the due’s structure has improved.\n\nIn 1996 Arch Jim made a significant vocation move as he appointed the first full- time Director of Vocations. As we look back to that time, we can see the benefit of the full-timer in terms of numbers of seminarians increasing, as well as the quality of the candidates continuing to be excellent.\n\nAt this time additional activities became part of supporting vocations. First, the 5th grade vocation day was initiated. It has been hosted at St. Joseph Parish in Shawnee, Prince of Peace Parish in Olathe and at Ascension Parish. A meal was served to around 1000 students in short order. Ben Zarda, a very generous Serran, donated everything for the meal.\n\nA very popular event started in 1997, is the Runnin’ Revs. It actually came from Chicago, but we have made it better. Monsignor Mike Mullen was the playing coach. Ed Sayers was the first coach of the “All Stars,” to be followed by John Wissman. John has tried many times to get a few points from Monsignor for a small bet. The chance the “All Stars” will win is like the chances someone will beat the Harlem Globe Trotters. It is also our only fundraiser, with donations from those attending along with a live auction.\n\nTwo more Serra Clubs became active in 1998 and 1999. The Lawrence Club was primarily the brainchild of Dr. Pretz. With the St. Lawrence Center at the University of Kansas, he felt the Club could add support to vocations stemming from there. The problem was there were only two parishes in Lawrence to support the Club. Adding members was difficult. The Club tried to recruit from smaller towns near Lawrence with minimal success. Unfortunately, the Club became inactive.\n\nUpon the encouragement of Archbishop Keleher our Club once again undertook the task of chartering another Club. It was felt it could be different from KCK in that it would have both men and women members, meet in the evening, and hopefully attract younger members. Under the leadership of Dale Putnam and John Wissman, after a successful informational meeting, Johnson County was chartered with 99 members, a very large membership for Serra. Mark Leadom joined them and was their first president. In March 2011 a new Atchison Region Serra Club was presented with its charter at a Mass celebrated by Archbishop Naumann.\n\nHow are we doing in our mission of supporting vocations? These numbers are unofficial; but starting year 2000 we had 137 members and the Archdiocese had 22 seminarians. Both represent continued growth and positive results for our efforts.\n\nIn the year 2000, members of our Club made their first visits to our seminarians. With the encouragement of Arch Jim, six Serrans visited St. Meinrad Seminary in southern Indiana and Mundelein Seminary near Chicago. We were, without a doubt, the first Serrans to visit in person. So began a custom that continues today, popular with both seminarians and Serrans.\n\nA Regional Serra Convention was hosted by our Club in 2001. In case you forgot, headquarters were in the Holiday Inn at I-35 and 87th St. in Lenexa, and Masses were held in the original Holy Trinity stone church. Arch Jim was very supportive, and he was one of our main presenters. Monsignor Mullen took part in a panel discussion of, what else, vocations.\n\nAlso, in 2001 Father Brian Scheiber became our second Director of Vocations. In talking with Father Brian about this assignment, he indicated he enjoyed the opportunity and the challenge it brought. He served for six years and steady increases in seminarians were seen. He felt we are succeeding in our goal of changing the culture of vocations and our Club’s efforts were appreciated. He indicated no one is more scrutinized upon application than our candidates for the Priesthood.\n\nIn a very informative conversation with Monsignor Mullen we learned of activities starting in 2003. Father John Riley’s mother felt there was a need for a closer relationship to the parents of seminarians, as well as the seminarians. From this evolved the Parent Seminarian Mass and Lunch held each December. This event has been replaced with a Mass and dinner in early August that is a “sendoff” for seminarians returning to seminaries.\n\nHave you attended one of our Lenten retreats led by Monsignor Mullen? Each year Monsignor plans a different theme around which his talks are featured. It is another wonderful way our spiritual lives benefit by our Serran experience.\n\nOn January 15, 2005, Archbishop James P. Keleher submitted his resignation as our Archbishop after 11 years. Although a Chicagoan by birth, he had become an adopted son of Kansas, and he loved the people of northeast Kansas. If there was one defining legacy, it was his dedication to vocations and the appointment of a full time Vocation Director. His successor is our present Archbishop Joseph Naumann, a native of St. Louis. Their backgrounds prior to coming to Kansas were different. Arch Jim was known primarily as an educator whereas Archbishop Naumann’s resume was more connected to pastoring mostly inner-city parishes and a champion of Right to Life. Archbishop Naumann is also a St. Louis Cardinals fan.\n\nIn 2005-2006 John Jurcyk was chosen to serve as District Governor elect. John was the second Governor to come from our club. Another one of our members, Ron Heyse, from Cure’ of Ars parish, became our District Governor for 2011-2012. Jim Burns became the fifth member of our club to serve as a District Governor in 2018-2019.\n\nThe St. Lawrence Center at KU has been a strong Catholic presence on the campus for many years. Father Brian Scheiber was active there as a student. It so happens his replacement as Vocation Director, Father Mitchell Zimmerman, had close connections to the Center prior to entering the seminary. And also, former director, Father Scott Wallish is a Jayhawk. Vocations for the Archdiocese continued to grow in numbers, and it was during Father Mitchell’s term that we numbered more than 30 seminarians for the first time.\n\nIn 2010 we celebrated our Club’s 40th anniversary. Archbishop Naumann, celebrated a beautiful Mass of Thanksgiving at the Queen of the Holy Rosary church, followed by a wonderful dinner at the Milburn Country Club.\n\nOur Diocese had never had permanent deacons as part of the clergy until 2001 when groundwork for the permanent diaconate was laid. In 2005, applicants for the first cohort were accepted, and in 2011 seventeen men were ordained as permanent deacons. These men, mostly married and employed elsewhere, serve in 30 parishes. Others may serve in prisons, hospice, nursing homes, or hospitals. They provide our Club with another opportunity to support vocations. Today there are 60 permanent deacons serving the Archdiocese. There are another 16 in formation and a new cohort will begin formation in 2022.\n\nIn 2011 some changes were made to the Nun’s picnic. The name was changed to Religious Sisters Appreciation Day, RSAD for short. The Sisters present received a small cash gift. This required Serrans to look to outside sponsors, something we had not done in the past. The event is now held at Saint Patrick’s Parish in Kansas City, Kansas. Because of the pandemic, the event was held at the Savior Pastoral Center in 2021.\n\nOur Club was asked to Chair a Regional Serra Convention in the fall of 2012 when the original Club had to withdraw. President Jim Conrad asked President-elect Bob Luchi to step in to fill the need. The Convention was planned along with a retreat led by the Monks at Conception Abbey where it was held. The theme was “Increase our Faith and our Fire.” One Hundred fifteen Serrans attended, and they greatly enjoyed off times to spend with seminarians in friendship.\n\nIn 2013 Father Scott Wallish was named Director of Vocations replacing Father Mitchell Zimmerman. We have been so fortunate in the quality of character and dedication of the young men taking on the challenge of Vocation Director. Father Scott emphasized the role of Vocation committees in parishes.\n\nThe Serra Clubs in the Missouri Diocese have sponsored a benefit golf day for Priests throughout the metro area, including Conception Seminary. Perhaps through a little guilt they felt called to do something special for the Sisters. From this came the Blisters for Sisters activity (consisting of a walk, Mass, lunch and gifts). Members of our Club participate and volunteer.\n\nEarlier we mentioned changes in our own Nuns’ picnic now known as RSAD. The major change involved combining it with a similar picnic on the Missouri side. We continue to be the principal sponsor but Serrans from the other clubs assist. Both Bishops attend and take an active part in the prayer service. More than 200 sisters have attended from 26 congregations. Funds raised but not spent are held in an account to assist young ladies with loans needing to be paid off before being accepted in the various orders.\n\nAlthough our Club is not directly involved in the latest vocation activity, we are pleased to support it through our members. Starting in 2014 owners of the local Catholic radio station organized a softball game between the Priests of Missouri versus our Kansas Priests. The game is played at T-Bones Stadium, now the Monarchs Stadium, at The Legends and has become very popular, especially with families. Tailgating by various groups adds to the enjoyment. Most importantly, vocations are served.\n\nWe are now in our 51st year of service. We are very sure, if asked, our members would express their satisfaction in being a member of Serra KCK. What a great opportunity to be part of building a “culture of vocations” in our Archdiocese and deepening our love for our beautiful Catholic faith. Dear St. Junipero Serra, continue to lead us “always forward never back.”\n\nThe worldwide pandemic has caused a number of changes in society and the Serra Club was certainly affected. In March 2020 because of COVID activities were restricted and curtailed including in-person Serra meetings. Many of us learned how to use Zoom to communicate with each other. The Serra Club was no exception. Monthly meetings were held using the Zoom app. During the summer, outdoor meetings with social distancing were held at a shelter at Shawnee Mission Lake. In-person meetings resumed in late March 2021.\n\nIn May 2020 a 50-year anniversary celebration was planned for the club. Of course, that was canceled because of the pandemic, as well as many other club activities. Now, in 2021 as we begin to recover from the pandemic we are once again resuming activities. The 50th recognition has been combined with the Memorial Mass for deceased Serrans and their widows are invited to the Mass and dinner.\n\nIn 2018, Father Dan Morris became the vocation director for the Archdiocese. In 2021 there are 22 seminarians studying for the priesthood. In May 2022 two of those seminarians will be ordained to the priesthood and three will be ordained transitional deacons.\n\nHow could we possibly write about our history and not mention our website which makes it possible to bring our story to you? The creation of our talented webmaster, Dr. Bob Luchi, with much help from members of the Communications Committee, it has been a great addition to our vocation work. It contains monthly updates on our activities, feature articles on our faith, a calendar, history information, and how to join our Club. An example of its appeal is the contact we have made with a Serra Club in Tanzania, Africa, halfway around the world from us. They are a new Club, and we are offering them support in their development. If you haven’t done so you must check it out at serrakck.org.\n\nAs we celebrate our 50th anniversary, the Serra Club of Kansas City in Kansas gives thanks to our founders and those members who have continued through the years to build and strengthen our Club to what it is today. We are grateful, blessed and always continue to pray for the success of our Club and for the perseverance of vocations. May God bless us all.\n\nJoining Serra\n\nWe welcome new members to help us with our current projects and activities and to expand our efforts to pray for, encourage, support and affirm vocations to the priesthood and religious life.\n\nJoining Serra will put you in contact with a dedicated group of Catholic men who, by prayer and mutual support deepen each others faith life."
