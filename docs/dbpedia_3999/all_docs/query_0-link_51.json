        "text": "The scope of the oral history collection also encompasses the personal narratives of those who witnessed the escalation of the Nazisâ€™ anti-Jewish campaign in Austria, Germany, and other countries that fell under German domination. The accounts of those people who escaped, alone or with their families, before the Nazis closed all escape routes, are included as well.\n\nThe oral histories are indexed by the last name of the interviewee. Also listed are place of birth, identification, and places of affiliation (e.g., ghettos, concentration camps). Testimonies will soon be hyperlinked to our collections database and have a viewable summary online. All testimonies are available to view and research in the Library Archive at The Zekelman Holocaust Center.\n\nOral histories denoted by an asterisk (*) are held by the Library Archive but were not conducted by our Oral History Department."
