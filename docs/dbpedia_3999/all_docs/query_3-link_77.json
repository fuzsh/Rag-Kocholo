        "text": "I. Summary\n\nI'm a former cop. I'm a true believer in law and order. But my son was a child when this happened. He wasn't thinking like an adult, and he wasn't an adult . . . how is it that the law can treat him as if he is one?\n\n-Frank C., father of youth offender sentenced to life without parole, October 22, 2004\n\nChildren can and do commit terrible crimes. When they do, they should be held accountable, but in a manner that reflects their special capacity for rehabilitation. However, in the United States the punishment is all too often no different from that given to adults.\n\nIn civil matters, state and federal laws recognize the immaturity and irresponsibility of children. For example, they typically establish eighteen as the minimum age to get married without parental consent, to vote, to sign contracts, or to serve on a jury. Yet in forty-two states and under federal law, the commission of a serious crime by children under eighteen-indeed in some states children as young as ten-transforms them instantly into adults for criminal justice purposes. Childrenwho are too young to buy cigarettes legally, boys who may not have started to get facial hair, kids who still have stuffed animals on their beds, are tried as adults, and if convicted, receive adult prison sentences, including life without parole (LWOP).\n\nThis report is the first ever national analysis of life without parole sentences for children. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International have discovered that there are currently at least 2,225 people incarcerated in the United States who have been sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in prison for crimes they committed as children. In the United States, departments of corrections do not maintain publicly accessible and accurate statistics about child offenders incarcerated in adult prisons, and there is no national depository of these data. Therefore, we were able to collect data on individuals sentenced to life without parole for crimes they committed as children only by requesting that it be specially produced for us by each state's corrections department.\n\nThe public may believe that children who receive life without parole sentences are \"super-predators\" with long records of vicious crimes. In fact, an estimated 59 percent received the sentence for their first-ever criminal conviction. Sixteen percent were between thirteen and fifteen years old at the time they committed their crimes. While the vast majority were convicted of murder, an estimated 26 percent were convicted of felony murder in which the teen participated in a robbery or burglary during which a co-participant committed murder, without the knowledge or intent of the teen. Racial disparities are marked. Nationwide, the estimated rate at which black youth receive life without parole sentences (6.6 per 10,000) is ten times greater than the rate for white youth (0.6 per 10,000).\n\nOur research shows significant differences among the states in the use of life without parole sentences for children. For example, Virginia, Louisiana, and Michigan have rates that are three to seven-and-a-half times higher than the national average of 1.77 per 100,000 children nationwide. At the other end of the spectrum, New Jersey and Utah permit life without parole for children but have no child offenders currently serving the sentence. Alaska, Kansas, Kentucky, Maine, New Mexico, New York, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia all prohibit the sentence for youth offenders. In May of 2005, Texas changed its law to allow individuals found guilty of a capital felony (including those below the age of eighteen) to be sentenced to life without parole. However, we could not definitively interpret this legislation, nor could we include data from Texas in this report, because the law went into effect on September 1, 2005, meaning it had not yet been applied or interpreted by the courts of Texas when this report went to press.\n\nBefore 1980, life without parole was rarely imposed on children. The number of child offenders who received the sentence each year began to increase in the late 1980s, reaching 50 in 1989. It peaked in 1996 at 152 and then began to drop off; in 2003, 54 child offenders entered prison with the sentence. But states have by no means abandoned the use of life without parole for child offenders: the estimated rate at which the sentence is imposed on children nationwide remains at least three times higher today than it was fifteen years ago. In fact, the proportion of youth offenders convicted of murder who receive life without parole has been increasing, suggesting a tendency among states to punish them with increasing severity. For example, in 1990 there were 2,234 youth convicted of murder in the United States, 2.9 percent of whom were sentenced to life without parole. Ten years later, in 2000, the number of youth murderers had dropped to 1,006, but 9.1 percent were sentenced to life without parole.\n\nIn addition, in eleven out of the seventeen years between 1985 and 2001, youth convicted of murder in the United States were more likely to enter prison with a life without parole sentence than adult murder offenders. Even when we consider murder offenders sentenced to either life without parole or death sentences, in four of those seventeen years, youth were more likely than adults to receive one of those two most punitive sentences.\n\nSuch harsh treatment for youth offenders cannot be squared with the most fundamental tenets of human rights law. International standards recognize that children, a particularly vulnerable group, are entitled to special care and protection because they are still developing physically, mentally, and emotionally. States are required to offer a range of alternatives to institutionalization. The imprisonment of a child should always be a measure of last resort, focused on the child's rehabilitation, and for the shortest suitable period of time. While incarceration may be proper for youth convicted of very serious crimes such as murder, this report argues that a sentence of life without the possibility of parole is never appropriate for youth offenders.\n\nThe dramatic increase in the imposition of life without parole sentences on child offenders in the United States is, at least in part, a consequence of widespread changes in U.S. criminal justice policies that gathered momentum in the last decades of the twentieth century. Responding to increases in crime and realizing the political advantages of promoting tough law and order policies, state and federal legislators steadily increased the length of prison sentences for different crimes and expanded the types of offenders facing prison sentences. They also promoted adult trials for child offenders by lowering the minimum age for criminal court jurisdiction, authorizing automatic transfers from juvenile to adult courts, and increasing the authority of prosecutors to file charges against children directly in criminal court rather than proceeding in the juvenile justice system. The United States thus abandoned its commitment to a juvenile justice system and the youth rehabilitation principles embedded in it.\n\n\"Adult time for adult crime\" may be a catchy phrase, but it reflects a poor understanding of criminal justice principles. If the punishment is to fit the crime, both the nature of the offense and the culpability or moral responsibility of the offender must be taken into account. As the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly recognized, the blameworthiness of children cannot be equated with that of adults, even when they commit the same crime. Most recently, in Roper v. Simmons in 2005, the Court ruled that the execution of child offenders was unconstitutional, finding that juveniles are \"categorically less culpable\" than adult criminals. The ruling noted that juveniles lack the \"well-formed\" identities of adults, are susceptible to \"immature and irresponsible behavior,\" and vulnerable to \"negative influences and outside pressures.\" Neuroscientists have recently identified anatomical bases for these differences between juveniles and adults, establishing the behavioral significance of the less developed brains of children.\n\nLife without parole sentences for child offenders-meaning there is no possibility of release during the prisoner's lifetime-effectively reject the well-established principle of criminal justice that children are less culpable than adults for crimes they commit. As the father of a teen offender serving life without parole pointed out to us: \"I'm a former cop. I'm a true believer in law and order. But my son was a child when this happened. He wasn't thinking like an adult, and he wasn't an adult . . . how is it that the law can treat him as if he is one?\" The anguish and anger of a victim's family and friends may well be the same whether a murder is committed by a child or an adult. But justice requires a sentence commensurate with both the nature of the crime and the culpability of the offender.\n\nThree Young Child Offenders\n\nFor supporters of life without parole sentences, the immaturity of child offenders is not a good enough reason to abolish the sentence. They argue that the punishment also serves to deter future crime. But does youth deterrence actually happen? Research has failed to show that the threat of adult punishment deters adolescents from crime. This is not surprising, given the well-documented limited abilities of children, including teenagers, to anticipate the consequences of their actions and rationally assess their options. Few adolescents are likely to be able to grasp the true significance of a life sentence. One twenty-nine-year-old woman serving life without parole told a researcher for this report that when she was sentenced, at the age of sixteen:\n\nI didn't understand \"life without\" . . . [that] to have \"life without,\" you were locked down forever. You know it really dawned on me when [after several years in prison, a journalist] came and . . . he asked me, \"Do you realize that you're gonna be in prison for the rest of your life?\" And I said, \"Do you really think that?\" You know. . . and I was like, \"For the rest of my life? Do you think that God will leave me in prison for the rest of my life?\"[2]\n\nVirtually all countries in the world reject the punishment of life without parole for child offenders. At least 132 countries reject life without parole for child offenders in domestic law or practice. And all countries except the United States and Somalia have ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which explicitly forbids \"life imprisonment without possibility of release\" for \"offenses committed by persons below eighteen years of age.\" Of the 154 countries for which Human Rights Watch was able to obtain data, only three currently have people serving life without parole for crimes they committed as children, and it appears that those four countries combined have only about a dozen such cases.\n\nSentencing children as adults means they may well enter prison while they are still under eighteen. One third of the youth offenders now serving life without parole entered prison while they were still children, in violation of international human rights standards that prohibit the incarceration of children with adults. But regardless of the precise age at which they entered prison, all have faced the same conditions as the older adults with whom they live: gangs, sexual predators, extortion, and violence. They also confront special hardships inherent in their sentence. Although it may take time to fully register in a child's mind, the sentence sends an unequivocal message to children that they are banished from society forever. Youth are told that they will die in prison and are left to wrestle with the anger and emotional turmoil of coming to grips with that fact. They are denied educational, vocational, and other programs to develop their minds and skills because access to those programs is typically restricted to prisoners who will someday be released, and for whom rehabilitation therefore remains a goal. Not surprisingly, child offenders sentenced to life without parole believe that U.S. society has thrown them away. As one young man told a researcher for this report, \"Seems like. . .since we're sentenced to life in prison, society says, 'Well, we locked them up, they are disposed of, removed.'\"[3]\n\nU.S. federal and state governments have the responsibility of ensuring community safety. But government is also responsible for ensuring that justice is served when a person is tried, convicted, and sentenced. The terrible crimes committed by children can ruin lives, causing injury and death to the victims and grief to their families and friends. Sentencing must reflect the seriousness of the crime, but it also must acknowledge that culpability can be substantially diminished by reason of the youth and immaturity of the perpetrator. Child offenders should be given the possibility of freedom one day, when they have matured and demonstrated their remorse and capacity for rehabilitation.\n\nNote: In keeping with international human rights standards, throughout this report we use the terms \"child\" and \"children\" to refer to persons under the age of eighteen. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to youth, adolescents, minors, and juveniles also refer to persons under the age of eighteen.\n\nII. Recommendations\n\nTo the President of the United States\n\nØPropose and urge Congress to enact legislation abolishing the sentence of life without parole for children convicted of federal crimes.\n\nØSubmit the Convention on the Rights of the Child to the U.S. Senate for its consent to ratification without reservation.\n\nTo the United States Congress\n\nØAbolish the sentence of life without parole for children convicted of federal crimes. Enable current child offenders serving life without parole to have their cases reviewed by a court for reassessment and re-sentencing to a sentence with the possibility of parole.\n\nØConsent (in the Senate) to ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child without reservation.\n\nØIncrease funding to states that eliminate life without parole sentences for child offenders in order to ensure state prisons can increase rehabilitative programs focused on helping such offenders to qualify for parole.\n\nØAmend Part D of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act to require the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to serve as a central depository, analyst, and disseminator of national data on children tried and sentenced as adults.\n\nTo the Attorney General of the United States\n\nØSuspend the sentence of life without parole for child offenders pending its abolition.\n\nTo United States Attorneys\n\nØIn accordance with the instruction to U.S. government attorneys, contained in the U.S. Attorneys' Manual, to consider factors such as proportionality and whether a conviction will achieve rehabilitation, do not bring charges against a youth offender that would result in a life without parole sentence when there are other charges that could be suitably brought.\n\nTo State and Federal Judges\n\nØExercise any available discretion to not impose the life without parole sentence on child offenders since it constitutes a violation of international human rights law. If the sentence is mandated by statute, evaluate whether, as applied to the defendant on trial, it would constitute cruel and unusual punishment in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\n\nTo State Governors\n\nØPropose and urge the enactment of state legislation that eliminates the sentence of life without parole for any crime committed by a person under the age of eighteen.\n\nØUntil the sentence of life without parole for children is abolished, review the clemency applications of all child offenders sentenced to life without parole and commute their sentences to terms of years or give clemency. In reviewing clemency applications, take into account the international legal prohibition against life without parole for persons under the age of eighteen.\n\nØDevelop and publish annual statistics on youth in the adult criminal justice system, including: demographic information (age, race, sex), data on children tried in criminal court, the manner by which each child reached criminal court (e.g., transfer, direct file), the nature of the crimes alleged, existence of prior adult record, and if convicted, the precise sentence received.\n\nTo State Legislators\n\nØEnact legislation that abolishes the sentence of life without parole for any offense committed by a child. Such legislation should include a retroactivity provision enabling current child offenders serving life without parole to have their cases reviewed by a court for re-assessment and re-sentencing to a sentence with the possibility of parole.\n\nØStrictly limit the practice of trying children in the adult criminal courts. There should be a presumption in favor of adjudicating children's cases in the juvenile justice system. The transfer of children's cases to the criminal court should be strictly limited to those cases in which a balancing between the severity of a child offender's crime, his or her age, and his or her best interests clearly points to a need for transfer, and only if accused child offenders transferred to the criminal court can be provided with the care and safeguards, such as not to be compelled to give testimony or to confess guilt, to which they are entitled under international law.\n\nØRepeal or modify existing transfer provisions that automatically require all children charged with certain offenses to be tried as adults. The decision to transfer a case to the criminal courts should be subject to judicial discretion and should never be mandatory.\n\nØEnact legislation that eliminates the prosecutorial option of filing cases against child offenders directly in adult criminal court. All cases against child offenders, regardless of their alleged crime, should be brought first in a juvenile court. Enact legislation that provides criminal court judges with the discretion to send child offenders to juvenile detention facilities until they are at least twenty-one, before being sent to adult prison. Ensure that offenders over the age of eighteen who remain in juvenile detention facilities are housed separately from those below the age of eighteen.\n\nØIncrease funding, training, and administrative support for juvenile public defender programs.\n\nTo State Prosecutors\n\nØPending the abolition of the sentence of life without parole for child offenders, cease seeking sentences of life without parole for child offenders.\n\nØInstead of filing charges against child offenders directly in criminal court, refer all child offenders to juvenile court.\n\nØBefore any determination to transfer a case to the criminal courts is made, request and participate in, as an officer of the court, a full and fair assessment of each child offender's competency to stand trial as an adult.\n\nTo State Criminal and Juvenile Court Judges\n\nØBefore a child is tried before a criminal court, automatically raise the issue of a\n\nchild defendant's competency to stand trial as an adult.\n\nØEnsure that transfer hearings for child offenders in juvenile court are meaningful and are limited to cases in which a balancing between the severity of the child offender's crime, age, and best interests clearly points to a need for transfer. The hearing must weigh several factors, including at a minimum: the nature and seriousness of the offense, the age and history of the child, and his or her amenability to treatment. The court's decision should be written and should explain all evidence relied upon and reasons for ruling for or against transfer to adult criminal court. If appealed, transfer decisions should be subject to review by a higher tribunal.\n\nTo Defense Attorneys\n\nØEnsure that child defendants, as well as their parents or guardians, understand all procedures, defense strategies, and the seriousness of the charges, including possible sentences, so they can fully exercise their rights as clients to participate in their legal defense.\n\nØVigorously defend the interests of child defendants during competency and transfer hearings, as well as during other aspects of the criminal process.\n\nØAssist child offenders in the filing of clemency applications.\n\nTo State and Federal Officials Who Fund and Administer CorrectionsPrograms\n\nØChild offenders serving life without parole should have access to all prison programs offered-educational, vocational, occupational, and other rehabilitative programs-regardless of the length of their sentence.\n\nØChild offenders under the age of eighteen should not be held with adults; other decisions about where to hold youth offenders should take into account their mental and physical maturity and should be reviewed on a regular basis.\n\nØProvide mental health and social services to assist youth offenders in adjusting to prison conditions as well as in coping with the length of their sentences.\n\nCase Study: Peter A.\n\nPeter A. was age fifteen both in this photo and when he committed his crime.\n\n© 2005 Private.\n\nAt the time of his crime, Peter A.[4] was a fifteen-year-old sophomore in high school, living at home in Chicago, Illinois with his mother, her fiancé, and his younger brother. He was seven years old when his parents divorced, and he was then raised by his mother, who supported the family through welfare and other public assistance.[5] According to Peter, he was not particularly interested in school, although he enjoyed and did well in his earth science class, which involved a lot of \"lab work with my hands.\"[6] His probation officer reported him to be an \"average student.\"[7]\n\nPeter spent much of his time with his older brother, who had his own apartment. Peter said: \"[My brother] tried to keep me out of trouble . . . my sophomore year-homecoming-he said, 'there's gonna be trouble, they're gonna be shooting at the school. You can't go.' . . . and they were shooting at the school, he was right. He wouldn't let me go to house parties or nothing. He was trying to keep me out of trouble, but at the same time, he had me along.\" Peter's older brother was involved in drug dealing, mostly cocaine. Peter said he would sometimes act as a courier for his brother, delivering drugs to customers. He also learned how to steal cars at an early age and had a juvenile adjudication for possession of a stolen vehicle when he was thirteen. He was placed on one year of probation and completed it to the satisfaction of his probation officer. He had no prior record of violent crime and no prior felony convictions.[8] He experimented with both alcohol and marijuana, but says he stopped using any drugs or alcohol when he was placed on probation.\n\nFollowing a theft of \"drugs and money\" from his brother's apartment, Peter said that he went with an eighteen-year-old to steal a van to help to get the stolen goods back. Peter says he acted on his brother's instructions, and he\n\nhas always admitted his involvement in stealing the van. Peter says he sat in the back seat of the stolen van with another young man, age twenty-one, and the eighteen-year-old driver, both of whom had guns. They drove to the home of the men they were told had robbed Peter's brother. No one sat in the front passenger's seat, because \"there was glass on the seat\" from the window Peter had broken during the theft.\n\nAccording to Peter, when the three arrived at the victims' home, Peter stayed in the stolen van while the other two went inside. Peter heard shots, and a few seconds later one of the co-defendants came running out of the house, without having recovered the drugs or money. The two sped away from the home, leaving the other young man behind. Peter said that he learned on return to his brother's apartment that two people had been shot to death in the botched robbery. A few days later, he found out that one of the victims was a close high school friend of his, a young man who had no involvement in the original robbery of Peter's brother. This friend, as Peter put it, was \"completely innocent . . . just in the wrong place at the wrong time.\" Peter was arrested approximately one week after the crime, after his two co-defendants were already in custody.\n\nPeter was questioned for a total of eight hours at the police station, without his mother or an attorney present. During this time, he readily admitted to his role in stealing the van.[9] His admission, \"which the assistant State's Attorney wrote down, did not state whether defendant intended to kill the victims.\"[10] Peter explained, \"Although I was present at the scene, I never shot or killed anyone.\" There was no physical evidence indicating that Peter had entered the victims' home, and one of his co-defendants was proven at trial to have been the triggerman in the crime, for which he was convicted. Peter was convicted of felony murder (two counts), which carries a mandatory sentence of life without parole. He was held accountable for the double murder because it was proved he had stolen the van used to drive to the victims' house.\n\nThe judge in Peter's case found that Peter, without a father at home, had fallen under the influence of his older brother. The judge called Peter \"a bright lad\" with \"rehabilitative potential\" and stated that he had qualms about sentencing Peter to life without parole. In his decision, he wrote: \"[T]hat is the sentence that I am mandated by law to impose. If I had my discretion, I would impose another sentence, but that is mandated by law.\"[11] Peter's defense attorney told a researcher for this report that one of the other perpetrators of the crime \"was subsequently\n\nacquitted. So, now you have a fifteen-year-old who was waiting outside with a stolen car doing life without parole and a murderer on the streets.\"[12] Peter, who has already spent nearly half his life behind bars, was twenty-nine years old when he was interviewed for this report in 2005. In prison, has obtained his G.E.D. and completed a correspondence paralegal course, from which he graduated with very good grades.[13] He works as a law clerk in the prison law library and has received one disciplinary ticket in the past six years of his incarceration for possessing an extra pillow and extra cereal in his cell.[14]\n\nIII. Background: Youth on Trial\n\nJuvenile Justice Trends in the United States\n\nTwo hundred years ago, when the United States was still in its infancy as a nation, child offenders aged fifteen and over were charged and tried in adult criminal courts.[15] As the nineteenth century progressed, children's welfare advocates argued that children's potential for rehabilitation should influence the response to their criminal behavior. By 1899, many states considered it counter-productive to incarcerate children along with adult convicts and began to establish reform houses for child offenders. In addition, reformers advocated establishing a separate system of justice for children, which removed them from adult criminal courts and instead employed \"open-ended, informal, and highly flexible policies to rehabilitate\" youth offenders.[16] Illinois created the first juvenile court in the United States in 1899.[17] By 1925, all but two states had followed suit.[18]\n\nUntil the 1970s, children accused of criminal conduct were almost exclusively brought before juvenile courts. A child could be transferred to stand trial in adult criminal court only if the juvenile court decided that such a transfer served the best interests of the child and of the public. At the request of the prosecutor or at the initiative of the juvenile court judge, the court would hold an adversarial hearing to determine whether the case should be transferred to adult criminal court. The transfer would not be approved unless the juvenile court determined that the adult court was best equipped to adjudicate the case and appropriately address the needs of society and of the offender.[19]\n\nStarting in the mid-1980s, the United States experienced a steep and troubling increase in violent crime, including violent crime by adolescents.[20] In the ten years prior to 1986, the number of homicides committed with guns by offenders aged fourteen to seventeen remained around 965 homicides per year. The number then began a steady rise, peaking in 1994 at 3,337 homicides. Youth homicides then began to drop; by 2002, the number of youth homicides with guns was lower than in 1976.[21]\n\nBefore it became apparent that dramatic increases in youth violent crime were a short-lived problem, the nation was consumed by anxiety that bordered on panic. In 1996, Princeton University professor John DiIulio coined the term \"super-predator,\" warning that in the United States, \"by the year 2010, there will be 270,000 more juvenile super-predators on the streets than there were in 1990.\"[22] Politicians and pundits throughout the country told Americans to \"brace\" themselves \"for the coming generation of 'super-predators.'\"[23] Public confidence in the juvenile justice system began to wane as concern about youth crime grew. States embraced harsher criminal justice policies for children just as they did for adults, without stopping to ascertain whether or not they would prove effective. Racial disparities grew more pronounced as criminal sentencing became more punitive.\n\nFigure 1, below, presents the relative percentages of black and white youth admitted to adult prisons in the United States, showing that from the early 1980s until the mid-1990s, the relative percentage of black youth offenders admitted to prison grew steeply, while declining for whites. During this same period, however, the rates at which both black and white youth were arrested for serious crimes such as murder increased. Starting in the mid-1990s, the admissions of black youth to adult prison began to decline, although it remained higher than the percentages from the early 1980s.\n\nFigure 1\n\nSource: Data from the National Corrections Reporting Program (NCRP). The NCRP is sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), U.S. Department of Justice, and evolved from the need to consolidate data on corrections at the national level. Its objective is to provide a consistent and comprehensive description of prisoners entering and leaving the custody or supervision of state and federal authorities. NCRP data downloads are available online at: http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/NACJD/NCRP/, accessed on September 6, 2005. Note that races other than white and black made up anywhere from 1.1 percent (in 1983) to 7.7 percent (in 1989) of the total prison admissions in any given year. Also, due to overlapping Census 2000 definitions between race (black or white) and ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic), Hispanics are often (though not always) included in black or white race counts and classifications.\n\nAdult Trial of Children\n\nLegislatures seized upon a simple formula: youth who commit \"adult\" crimes (e.g., murder, robbery, drug dealing) should be tried like adults. By 1997, all states but three (Nebraska, New York, and Vermont) had changed their laws to make it easier and more likely that child offenders would stand trial and be sentenced in adult criminal courts.[25] Three mechanisms have been used to increase the adult trial of juvenile offenders:\n\nWithdrawal of Juvenile Jurisdiction: Legislation precludes juvenile court jurisdiction in certain cases, typically depending on the age of the child and the nature of the offense. For example, in some states, juvenile courts do not have jurisdiction over a child accused of first degree murder; such crimes may only be tried in adult criminal court.[26]\n\nDiscretion to Direct File: Legislation gives prosecutors the discretion to file charges against child offenders accused of serious crimes in adult criminal court rather than beginning in juvenile courts. If they have this option, prosecutors typically choose to proceed with the prosecution of children as adults.[27]\n\nLowering the Age for Adult Court Jurisdiction: Legislation simply lowers the age at which offenders are subject to adult trials.\n\nAs of 2005, all states and the federal government have the capacity to try certain youth as adults in criminal court. As Table 1 (below) reveals, these provisions vary from state to state, based on offense and age criteria.\n\nTable 1: Minimum Age for Adult Prosecution and for Life without Parole Sentencing by State\n\nAlabama\n\n14\n\n16\n\nMontana\n\n12\n\n12\n\nAlaska\n\n0\n\nNo LWOP\n\nNebraska\n\n0\n\n0\n\nArizona\n\n0\n\n14\n\nNevada\n\n8\n\n8\n\nArkansas\n\n14\n\n14\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n13\n\n13\n\nCalifornia\n\n14\n\n16\n\nNew Jersey\n\n14\n\n14\n\nColorado\n\n12\n\n12\n\nNew Mexico\n\n15\n\nNo LWOP\n\nConnecticut\n\n14\n\n14\n\nNew York\n\n13\n\nNo <18 LWOP\n\nDelaware\n\n0\n\n0\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n13\n\n13\n\nDistrict of Columbia\n\n0\n\nNo <18 LWOP\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n14\n\n14\n\nFlorida\n\n0\n\n0\n\nOhio\n\n14\n\n14\n\nGeorgia\n\n12\n\n13\n\nOklahoma\n\n7\n\n13\n\nHawaii\n\n0\n\n0\n\nOregon\n\n0\n\nNo <18 LWOP\n\nIdaho\n\n14\n\n14\n\nPennsylvania\n\n0\n\n0\n\nIllinois\n\n13\n\n13\n\nRhode Island\n\n0\n\n0\n\nIndiana\n\n0\n\n16\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n0\n\n0\n\nIowa\n\n14\n\n14\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n0\n\n10\n\nKansas\n\n10\n\nNo LWOP\n\nTennessee\n\n0\n\n0\n\nKentucky\n\n14\n\nNo <18 LWOP\n\nTexas\n\n14\n\nNo LWOP\n\nLouisiana\n\n14\n\n15\n\nUtah\n\n14\n\n14\n\nMaine\n\n0\n\nNo LWOP\n\nVermont\n\n10\n\n10\n\nMaryland\n\n0\n\n0\n\nVirginia\n\n14\n\n14\n\nMassachusetts\n\n14\n\n14\n\nWashington\n\n0\n\n15\n\nMichigan\n\n0\n\n0\n\nWest Virginia\n\n0\n\nNo LWOP\n\nMinnesota\n\n14\n\n14\n\nWisconsin\n\n0\n\n10\n\nMississippi\n\n13\n\n13\n\nWyoming\n\n13\n\n13\n\nMissouri\n\n12\n\n12\n\nFederal\n\n15\n\n15\n\nSource: National Center for Juvenile Justice, State Juvenile Justice Profiles, available online at: http://www.ncjj.org/stateprofiles, accessed on June 6, 2005; Second Chances: Juveniles Serving Life without Parole in Michigan Prisons (American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Michigan, 2004), p.3, available online at: www.aclumich.org/pubs/juvenilelifers.pdf, accessed on September 13, 2005; Juvenile Offenders and Victims: 1999 National Report, p. 106; and state statutory research.\n\nIn addition, in ten states youth may only receive a life without parole sentence if they are one or several years older than the minimum age for adult prosecution. In other words, minors may be prosecuted as adults in Alabama from the age of fourteen, but they may only be sentenced to life without parole if they were sixteen or older at the time of the offense. By contrast, in Colorado children as young as twelve are eligible both for trial as adults and for the life without parole sentence. In most states that provide prosecutors the discretion to file cases in adult court, there is no judicial supervision or public accountability for their decisions, and prosecutors are not required to submit in writing the reasons for the direct charge in criminal court. However, at least six states and the federal government do attempt to limit prosecutorial discretion in some way.[28]\n\nTransfer hearings would at least offer the possibility of a judicial examination in juvenile court of the justification for sending a child offender to be tried in criminal court.[29] These hearings are becoming increasingly rare.The available data indicate the proportion of children who have had a transfer hearing before being tried in criminal court has been steadily declining. In 1996, approximately 36 percent of child offenders in adult court had a prior transfer hearing in juvenile court; by 2000 the percentage had fallen to an estimated 13 percent.[30]\n\nMoreover, U.S. juvenile court transfer hearings do not meet the international law standard that children accused of crimes should be dealt with, whenever appropriate, outside the realm of judicial proceedings in a criminal court.[31] U.S. transfer hearings often also give short shrift to the duty \"to ensure that children [accused of crimes] are dealt with in a manner appropriate to their well-being and proportionate both to their circumstances and the offense.\"[32] Transfers routinely occur even in cases that appear not to merit the more punitive treatment that often results from trial and conviction in a criminal court.\n\nWhen children are tried in criminal courts, little or no accommodation is made to take into account their youth. Whether eleven or seventeen, the child offender must participate in all the same pre-trial and trial procedures and confront all the same decisions that adult defendants do. Contrary to popular belief, it is the child and not his or her parent or guardian who must decide what to tell the police and defense attorneys, whether or not to follow attorney instructions, whether to testify, whether to give information to the prosecution, and whether to go to trial or accept a plea bargain.\n\nAlthough common sense would suggest that many children are simply too young to undertake such weighty legal responsibilities, it is rare for courts to consider whether children lack the competence to stand trial because of their age.[33] To shed light on thechallenges children tried as adults face in court, the MacArthur Foundation Research Network on Adolescent Development and Juvenile Justice, whose members include leading legal and scientific professionals as well as academic experts, has been conducting a long term study of children's trial competency. The study has examined a broad range of factors, including children's understanding of basic elements in the judicial process and of their rights as defendants, their ability to put facts together and draw logical conclusions, and their ability to make decisions independent of pressure from authority figures.[34] The research indicates that many young adolescents, particularly those fifteen and under, are not developmentally and intellectually mature enough to be legally \"competent\" to stand trial.[35]\n\nAny criminal defendant can make bad decisions. However, child offenders contacted for this report described a variety of errors in judgment in their dealings with police and during their adult criminal trials that may have been related to their youth. We found some child offenders who:\n\nWaived their constitutional rights and made confessions, including confessions they later said were false: For example, Gary C. from Menard, Illinois said that he falsely confessed to a murder that occurred when he was fourteen years old. The police interrogated him for several hours in the company of his mother. But after his mother left the room, the interrogation continued. Gary said he was \"alone\" and \"scared\" and ultimately told the police what they wanted to hear. When he left out details or failed to make statements that fit with the version of the crime already developed by the police, he said that they helped him along, saying things such as: \"[Y]ou used the ladder to get in, right?\" Afterwards, no one double checked the statement. Gary said he did not know what would happen once he confessed, but he had no idea he could be sentenced to life without parole.[36]\n\nDid not recognize bad advice from defense attorneys: Thomas M. is serving life without parole for a felony murder committed in Colorado when he was fifteen years old. Before trial, Thomas's trial attorney, Eydie Elkins, convinced him to write a letter of remorse.[37] Elkins went to the same church as the victim's family and delivered the letter to her pastor, who gave it to his congregant, the victim's mother, who then turned it over to the prosecutor. Although the letter was not a direct confession, it was the primary piece of evidence used to convict Thomas of the felony murder, in which a young man was shot and killed during a botched robbery.\n\nWere hampered by low levels of education, including illiteracy: Clifford S., who was convicted for a murder committed when he was sixteen years old, is serving life without parole in Arkansas. Clifford was illiterate. When he was interviewed for this report, he said that when he was being questioned about the crime, a detective said he could take a polygraph test if he signed a form. Clifford said that the detective \"wrote stuff down on this piece of paper you know . . . You know, I can't read and write.\" Clifford continued, \"When he got that piece of paper, you know and I signed my name on it, he stepped out and told the police that I confessed to the crime. And I heard it and I was like, 'No I didn't!'\" When asked if the detective told him what the paper said, Clifford answered: \"No ma'am. When I went to trial, they told him to read it and that was when I first heard what he wrote. . . . And he said in court that he wrote it. Only thing I did was sign my name on it.\"[38]\n\nDid not understand what was at stake during their trials: An Illinois defense attorney who represented a youth sentenced to life without parole said: \"[My] client understood the proceedings. I've been a defense attorney for many years and he was a smart kid, he pretty much got what was going on. But it was still very difficult for him to comprehend where he might end up, to really grapple with the sentence and understand how important it was to work with me. It's the same as a bunch of young soldiers going off to battle when they've never met or had anyone die before.\"[39]\n\nThe trial of children as adults often fails to provide children with the special safeguards and care to which they are entitled under international law. Juvenile justice advocates in the United States widely recognize that decisions to send youth to adult court are often arbitrary and unfair and pay scant attention to the goal of rehabilitation. Once in the adult system, adolescents are deprived of the wide variety of rehabilitative sentencing options that they might be eligible to receive in the juvenile court system-sentencing options that are designed to give them the tools they need to turn their lives around and become law-abiding members of society. In Florida, for example, children transferred to adult court were shown to be a third more likely to re-offend than those sent to the juvenile system for the same crime and with similar prior records. In 2000, Florida had more children in adult state prisons than any other state, yet Florida's violent juvenile crime rate was 54 percent higher than the national average.[41]\n\nCase Study: Samantha L.\n\nSamantha L. was age seventeen both in this photo and when she committed her crime.\n\n© 2005 Private.\n\nSamantha L. had already spent nineteen years behind bars when she was interviewed for this report. Samantha said that her parents divorced when she was two years old and that her father \"was an alcoholic\" who had \"raped my mom and my sister.\"[42] At seventeen, Samantha was unemployed and had a baby son. She had been charged as a juvenile with assault, two burglaries, and auto theft.\n\nSamantha said she spent most of her time with her older sister, and they often dated older men. One of these men, Rick, involved her in selling marijuana. She sold marijuana to an undercover policeman and was arrested and sent to a juvenile center as a result. When Samantha was released from the juvenile center, she re-started her relationship with Rick and moved in with him.\n\nOne night, Rick talked about wanting to leave town and asked if Samantha knew of anybody who would lend her money. She suggested her closest friend's grandfather, whose house she sometimes cleaned to earn money. They drove to his house, and Samantha and Rick went in to ask for the money. Her friend's grandfather reminded her that she still owed him a housecleaning because of some money he had already paid her, so she decided not to ask for the money. She told Rick she wanted to leave, but he said he wanted to stay to talk to \"grandpa\" some more. Samantha says she went outside and waited in the truck for Rick. \"Rick didn't come out and I knew if I went in it\n\nwould take him longer to leave, so I honked the horn. Rick didn't come out so I started the truck thinking he would hear it and come out. He didn't. I pulled around to the front of the house and Rick came out. He got into the truck and started yelling 'I killed him!' I thought he was just making it up . . . because Rick didn't have any blood on him, I really thought he was lying . . . Rick drove the truck back to the man we had borrowed it from.\"\n\nSamantha and Rick were arrested later that night. Samantha told a researcher for this report that she was not questioned by the police about the details of the crime, because immediately after her arrest Rick took full responsibility for the crime. Subsequently, however, he accused Samantha of the murder, claiming he had initially lied about his role in the crime, because he thought Samantha was pregnant with his child. Samantha wrote that Rick fabricated this explanation for his changed story in order to justify his altered theory of defense. She continued, \"I was never pregnant by him, and my only son was seven months old at the time of the crime.\" Evidence introduced at Rick's trial appeared to corroborate Samantha's description of events.\n\nSamantha was sentenced to life without parole for aiding and abetting first degree murder. Rick was sentenced to life without parole for first degree murder.[43]Samantha told a researcher for this report, \"I know I did something wrong, but not as wrong as Rick because I wasn't there, in the house. I wasn't there during all of that. Rick admitted [when he was first questioned by the police] I wasn't there, he told them I didn't make those decisions. . . . I didn't even hold the knife. But, I know it doesn't matter to them.\"\n\nIV. Sentencing of Youth to Life without Parole\n\nOnce children are prosecuted as adults, they become subject to the same prison sentences that can be imposed on adults, including in forty-two states, the sentence of life without parole. Only Kentucky, New York, Oregon, and the District of Columbia specifically exclude anyone under the age of eighteen who is tried as an adult from life without parole sentencing. In twenty-seven of the forty-two states in which youth can be sentenced to life without parole, the sentence is mandatory for anyone, child or adult, found guilty of certain enumerated crimes.[44]\n\nAge, Crime, and Gender\n\nAs of 2004, there were at least 2,225 youth offenders serving life without parole in U.S prisons.[45] Because of the absence of any national database tracking the sentencing of youth to life without parole (or indeed any data tracking the presence of child offenders in adult prisons), Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International compiled this figure from data obtained directly from individual state departments of corrections and other sources. This figure includes youth offenders from forty of the forty-two states in which youth offenders may be sentenced to life without parole and from the federal bureau of prisons (see Appendix B for methods).\n\nWe have data on age at offense for 1,291 of the child offenders sentenced to life without parole. As shown in Table 2, the youngest children (six in total) were thirteen years old at the time of offense, and the average age was sixteen. Sixteen percent were imprisoned for crimes committed when they were fifteen or younger. Applying this proportion to the total number of youth offenders serving life without parole suggests that some 354 youth offenders nationwide currently face a lifetime behind bars for crimes they committed before their sixteenth birthdays.\n\nTable 2: Age of Child Offenders Sentenced to Life without Parole\n\nat Time of Offense\n\nSource: Data provided from thirty-eight state correctional departments and additional other sources for the states of Alabama and Virginia.\n\nLife without parole is imposed for a variety of crimes, as shown in Table 3.[46] However, it is most often imposed on child offenders who have been convicted of crimes of homicide, as shown in Figure 2.\n\nTable 3: Crime Categories\n\nSource: see Table 2, above.\n\nFigure 2\n\nSource: see Table 2, above.\n\nAlmost 93 percent of the youth sentenced to life without parole were convicted of homicide. It is a misconception, however, that the sentence is reserved only for the most calculated and heinous of murderers. As already emphasized, it is often imposed, for example, on children convicted of felony murder-that is, on teens who participated in a felony such as robbery during which another participant in the crime killed someone without the child offender having intended the murder to occur and sometimes without even knowing the other participant was armed. In the cases examined by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, many of these felony murder crimes were robberies that went awry, often involving a group of offenders, at least one of whom was an adult. Unfortunately, data are not available to enable us to determine the nationwide number of child offenders convicted of felony murder who are serving life without parole.\n\nHowever, we do know that 26 percent, or 45 of the 172 youth offenders across the nation who self-reported to us on this question, were sentenced to life without parole for felony murder.[47] We also know that 33 percent of the 24 youth offenders investigated in depth by Human Rights Watch in 2005 in Colorado are serving life without parole for felony murder offenses;[48] and that nearly half of the 146 youth surveyed by the American Civil Liberties Union in Michigan in 2004 were sentenced to life without parole for felony murder or for \"aiding and abetting\" a murder in which another person pulled the trigger.[49]\n\nIn terms of gender, all but a tiny fraction (2.6 percent) of the child offenders serving life without parole are male.[50] This is not surprising considering both the marked differences in violent juvenile crime rates (especially homicide offenses) by gender[51] and that boys are much more likely to be transferred to adult court than girls.[52] Although their total numbers were very small, the girls in the sample were more likely to have been convicted of homicide. Eight percent more female than male youth offenders serving life without parole were convicted of homicide.[53] The actual discrepancy may be even greater, since crime data on 18 percent of the female offenders is not available.\n\nThe specter of \"super predators\" created much of the national furor over youth violence. Politicians and the public thought their communities were (or would be) besieged by vicious teenagers with long records of crime. Yet few of the child offenders sentenced to life without parole fit this super predator profile. Our research suggests that 59 percent of youth offenders received a life without parole sentence for their first-ever criminal conviction of any sort. These youth had neither an adult criminal record nor a juvenile adjudication.[54] The other 39 percent had prior criminal records that ranged from convictions as adults for serious crimes such as robbery, to juvenile offenses such as getting into fights with other teenagers.[55]\n\nCase Study: Stacey T.\n\nStacey T. was age thirteen in this photo and committed his crime at age fourteen.\n\n© 2005 Private\n\nStacey T. was about to enter the tenth grade at a Pennsylvania high school, under a magnet program for students who excelled in school, at the time of his crime. He lived at home with his mother, a single parent. When Stacey T. was fourteen years old, he was arrested for the murder of Alexander Porter, a young man who was his girlfriend's brother. Stacey was convicted of second-degree murder (felony murder in Pennsylvania) and sentenced to life without parole. He had no juvenile record, and this crime was his first. Stacey was charged directly in adult court; he never had a juvenile transfer hearing.\n\nCourt documents and an interview with Stacey's attorney for this report indicate that Stacey T. agreed to participate with two adults (Henry Daniels, who was Stacey's cousin, and Kevin Pelzer) in a robbery of Alexander Porter, who was assumed to be wealthy, because it was \"common knowledge\" that his family was involved in drug dealing.[56] The plan involved coercing Porter to give over the keys to his apartment so that the two adults (Daniels and Pelzer) could rob it.\n\nThe court's decision in the case of Stacey's cousin establishes that the three perpetrators: \"[S]et up a purported drug transaction with Porter, in order to lure him to a meeting, whereupon they bound and gagged him, confiscated his keys, and stuffed him in the trunk of his car. One of the conspirators [Stacey], a 'friend' of Porter's, allowed himself to be tied up in front of Porter. . . . He was 'released' after Porter was locked in the trunk, then taken home so that\n\nPorter would later believe that he had been murdered. The remaining conspirators drove Porter's car, with Porter in the trunk, to the garage of one of the individuals and parked it there.\"[57]\n\nStacey explained that Daniels and Pelzer pretended to murder him in order to coerce Porter to give over the keys or face the same fate. In Pelzer's appeal, the court described what Pelzer and Daniels did in the twenty-four hours after Stacey left the scene: \"Twice during the next twenty-four hours while Porter was kept in the car trunk, the kidnappers used Porter's car on excursions. . . . First, they used the vehicle to get to Porter's parents' apartment to commit burglaries. . . . [Pelzer] and Daniels went home, slept for a few hours, then took Porter to a park, shot him four times in the neck and back with a .25 caliber handgun, and left him by the roadside where his body was discovered the following day. . . . While Porter was being bound, [Stacey] was led outside, supposedly to be punished, but actually to be released.\"[58] [According to Pelzer] \"[M]e and [Daniels] got into the boy's car, the black shiny one to drive [Stacey] home. I drove the car. We dropped [Stacey] off and returned to my house.\"[59]\n\nIn short, while Stacey T. had agreed to participate in a robbery scheme, he was not present for the murder of Porter, nor was there evidence presented at trial that suggested he knew Daniels and Pelzer were going to murder Porter. Indeed, it would appear that the murder itself was never planned as part of the scheme. Stacey was convicted of second degree murder-Pennsylvania's equivalent of a felony murder conviction in other states, and which has put him behind bars for the rest of his life.\n\nStacey wrote: \"Convinced that I could make some money, I agreed with my cousin to rob this guy of his keys so that [my cousin] and his friend could rob the guy's and his father's apartment. . . . but I had no idea that this guy would end up dead. . . . Yes, I made a mistake. I associated with the wrong crowd. I engaged in committing a crime with them. However, is it fair that I spend the rest of my life in prison for a crime which was committed by someone else without my knowledge or without me being present? I feel sorry for the life which was lost in my case. I feel a deep sense of empathy for his family and what they must continue to endure in terms of pain. But this tragedy was never supposed to happen. I don't absolve myself of all guilt. I, out of naiveness, out of influence, out of the ignorance of knowing the consequences, agreed to do a crime: a robbery.\"[60]\n\nHistorical Trends in Sentencing to Life without Parole\n\nAs shown in Figure 3, from 1962 until 1981, an average of two youth offenders in the United States entered prison each year with life without parole sentences. Beginning in 1982, the number began to rise markedly, peaking at 152 youth in 1996. Although the number has declined since 1996, it has never returned to the much lower figures from the 1960s to mid-1980s.\n\nWhile the absolute number of youth sentenced to life without parole has decreasedsince 1996, the nationwide proportion of youth sentenced to life without parole for murder has increased relative to the total number of youth arrested for or reliably implicated in murders nationwide (\"known murder offenders\").[61]\n\nFigure 3\n\nSource: Data provided from thirty-eight state correctional departments and additional other sources for the states of Alabama and Virginia.\n\nHuman Rights Watch and Amnesty International have compared the number of known murder offenders (including all degrees of murder and felony murder) who were below the age of eighteen for each year from 1980 through 2000, with the number of child offenders who entered prison during those same years with a life without parole sentence. As shown in Table 4, the proportion of youth murder offenders who entered prison with life without parole sentences constituted an ever growing proportion of the number of known youth murder offenders. For example, the percentage going to prison with life without parole in 2000 was three times greater than the percentage in 1990. The data thus suggest an increasing punitiveness toward youth murder offenders.\n\nTable 4: Youth Murder Offenders and Youth Offenders Sentenced to Life without Parole\n\nYear\n\nYouth Murder Offenders\n\nYouth Murder Offenders Entering Prison with LWOP\n\nPercentage of Youth Murder Offenders Entering Prison with LWOP\n\n1980\n\n1,460\n\n2\n\n0.14%\n\n1981\n\n1,410\n\n5\n\n0.35%\n\n1982\n\n1,235\n\n10\n\n0.81%\n\n1983\n\n1,100\n\n33\n\n3.00%\n\n1984\n\n968\n\n20\n\n2.07%\n\n1985\n\n1,125\n\n32\n\n2.84%\n\n1986\n\n1,334\n\n32\n\n2.40%\n\n1987\n\n1,348\n\n32\n\n2.37%\n\n1988\n\n1,622\n\n59\n\n3.64%\n\n1989\n\n1,805\n\n50\n\n2.77%\n\n1990\n\n2,234\n\n64\n\n2.86%\n\n1991\n\n2,457\n\n66\n\n2.69%\n\n1992\n\n2,470\n\n84\n\n3.40%\n\n1993\n\n2,776\n\n73\n\n2.63%\n\n1994\n\n2,819\n\n116\n\n4.11%\n\n1995\n\n2,338\n\n118\n\n5.05%\n\n1996\n\n2,021\n\n152\n\n7.52%\n\n1997\n\n1,709\n\n143\n\n8.37%\n\n1998\n\n1,407\n\n124\n\n8.81%\n\n1999\n\n1,168\n\n133\n\n11.39%\n\n2000\n\n1,006\n\n91\n\n9.05%\n\nSource: H.

Data on dates of entry to prison contained in data provided by thirty-eight state correctional departments and additional other sources for the states of Alabama and Virginia.\n\nComparing the imposition of life without parole sentences on children and adults convicted of murder casts additional light on the increasing punitiveness toward child offenders. As shown in Figure 4, in eleven out of the seventeen years between 1985 and 2001, youth convicted of murder were more likely to enter prison with a life without parole sentence than adult murder offenders.[62] Even when death sentences are included, as shown in Figure 5, in one quarter of the same seventeen years, child murder offenders were more likely to receive either the death penalty or life without parole than adults. In the remaining years, adults were only slightly more likely to enter prison with either life without parole or death sentences (between 1.3 and 0.1 percentage points)-a remarkable finding given that during most of the years studied, large numbers of states had abolished the juvenile death penalty. On its face, this data suggests that states have often been more punitive towards children who commit murder than adults. At the very least, it suggests age has not been much of a mitigating factor in the sentencing of youth convicted of murder.\n\nFigure 4\n\nSource: The data are from the National Corrections Reporting Program, which is sponsored by the Bureau of Justice Stastics.

For this report, the federal bureau of prisons reported that they had zero youth offenders serving life without parole. However, we have since located at least one inmate, Jose A., who was fifteen at the time of his crime and is serving life without parole in the federal system.[63]\n\nTable 5: Total Youth Serving Life without Parole by State\n\nState\n\nYouth LWOP Total\n\nState\n\nYouth LWOP Total\n\nAlabama\n\n15\n\nMontana\n\n1\n\nArizona\n\n30\n\nNebraska\n\n21\n\nArkansas\n\n46\n\nNevada\n\n16\n\nCalifornia\n\n180\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n3\n\nColorado\n\n46\n\nNew Jersey\n\n0\n\nConnecticut\n\n10\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n44\n\nDelaware\n\n7\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n1\n\nFederal\n\n1\n\nOhio\n\n1\n\nFlorida\n\n273\n\nOklahoma\n\n49\n\nGeorgia\n\n8\n\nPennsylvania\n\n332\n\nHawaii\n\n4\n\nRhode Island\n\n2\n\nIdaho\n\ndata missing\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n26\n\nIllinois\n\n103\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n9\n\nIndiana\n\n2\n\nTennessee\n\n4\n\nIowa\n\n67\n\nUtah\n\n0\n\nLouisiana\n\n317\n\nVermont\n\n0\n\nMaryland\n\n13\n\nVirginia\n\n48\n\nMassachusetts\n\n60\n\nWashington\n\n23\n\nMichigan\n\n306\n\nWisconsin\n\n16\n\nMinnesota\n\n2\n\nWyoming\n\n6\n\nMississippi\n\n17\n\nMissouri\n\n116\n\nNationwide\n\n2225\n\nSource: Data provided by thirty-eight state correctional departments and additional other sources for the states of Alabama and Virginia.\n\nIn Figure 6, below, we present the rates at which states impose the sentence relative to state youth populations. The range in the rates is extraordinary: Virginia has the highest rate, 132.90 per 100,000 youth age fourteen to seventeen, a rate that is 886 times larger than Ohio's lowest rate of 0.15. The national rate is 14.20.\n\nFigure 6\n\nSource: Data provided by thirty-eight state correctional departments and additional other sources for the states of Alabama and Virginia. Population data were obtained from Population Division, U.S. Census Bureau, \"Table 2: Annual Estimates of the Population: April 1, 2000 to July 1, 2003,\" released in September 2004, available online at: http://www.census.gov/popest/states/asrh/SC-EST2003-02.html, accessed on September 6, 2005.\n\nThe differences in the state rates of life without parole for youth do not correlate directly to differences in rates of violent crime by youth. As shown in Figure 7, there are states with high rates of youth violence but low rates of youth with life without parole sentencing such as Delaware, Illinois, and Maryland; and there are states with the reverse: high rates of youth with the sentence and lower rates of youth crime, such as Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Michigan. Virginia's rate of youth crime is 34 percent lower than Ohio's crime rate, yet, as noted above, Virginia uses life without parole sentences for youth at a rate that is 866 times greater than Ohio's. Missouri, on the other hand, has both relatively high rates of youth crime and high rates of sentencing youth to life without parole.\n\nFigure 7\n\nSource: sentencing rate data provided by thirty-eight state correctional departments and additional other sources for the states of Alabama and Virginia. Arrest rate data from Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), \"Crime in the United States, 1997,\" Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), available online at: http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/97cius.htm, accessed on September 14, 2005. Population data from the Bureau of Census, \"Estimates of the population of states: 1997\". Although many states had crime index data available for subsequent years, the data from 1997 provided rates for the largest number of states, with reporting coverage ranging from 33 to 100 percent of counties. No 1997 data were available for Florida, New Hampshire, and Vermont.\n\nState criminal justice policies and practices clearly play a large role in the different rates of life without parole sentences for youth. One of those policy choices is that of making life without parole a mandatory sentence for certain crimes, regardless of whether it is committed by an adult or a youth. As shown in Table 6, the eight states with the highest rates of sentencing youth to life without parole all make the sentence mandatory upon conviction for certain crimes. The five states with the lowest rates of sentencing youth to life without parole (other than those that do not impose the sentence on youth at all) make the sentence discretionary. In these states, in which the judge retains the ability to weigh individual characteristics of defendants, the much lower rates of sentencing suggests judges' assessments that life without parole is not an appropriate sentence for youth offenders.\n\nTable 6: Mandatory or Discretionary Life without Parole by State\n\n*Rate per every 10,000 youth aged 14-17 in state population as of the 2000 Census.\n\nSource: Sentencing statutes of forty-one states. For state totals, data provided by thirty-eight state correctional departments and additional other sources for the states of Alabama and Virginia.\n\nRace\n\nNo examination of criminal justice in the United States is complete without a discussion of race. Therefore, we collected data on the total number of youth offenders in each racial group serving life without parole. Our data reveal that blacks constitute 60 percent of the youth offenders serving life without parole nationwide and whites constitute 29 percent.[64] In addition, the data show that black youth nationwide are serving life without parole sentences at a rate that is ten times higher than white youth (the rate for black youth is 6.6 as compared with .6 for white youth). Neither the data we compiled nor other available sources answer the key question: are children from racial minorities sentenced to life without parole more frequently than white children convicted of similar crimes and with similar criminal histories?[65]\n\nAs with the national totals given above, the percentage of minority youth serving life without parole are often very different from the percentage of white youth serving the sentence in a particular state. Again, while the differences are dramatic, we do not know the crime rates, criminal histories, or other race-neutral factors that would allow us to draw conclusions about racial disparities in the sentencing policies of states. However, research studies have found that minority youths receive harsher treatment than similarly situated white youths at every stage of the criminal justice system, from the point of arrest to sentencing.[66] For example, Amnesty International's research indicates that one reason for the over-representation of black and other minority children in the criminal justice system is racial discrimination by law enforcement and justice authorities.[67] In addition, in a study of youth in Florida's juvenile justice system researchers found:\n\n[W]hen juvenile offenders were alike in terms of age, gender, seriousness of the offense which promoted the current referral, and seriousness of their prior records, the probability of receiving the harshest disposition available at each of several processing stages was higher for minority youth than for white youth.[68]\n\nTable 7 presents, by state, the racially disaggregated rates of youth sentenced to life without parole per 10,000 youth aged fourteen through seventeen.\n\nTable 7: Rate of Youth Offenders Serving Life without Parole by Race and State\n\nState\n\nYouth LWOP Rate*\n\nWhite LWOP Rate\n\nBlack LWOP Rate\n\nHispanic LWOP Rate\n\nBlack / White Ratio\n\nAlabama\n\n0.6\n\n0.2\n\n1.3\n\n0.0\n\n5.6\n\nArizona\n\n1.0\n\n0.3\n\n5.2\n\n1.4\n\n18.1\n\nArkansas\n\n2.9\n\n1.2\n\n9.5\n\n0.0\n\n7.6\n\nCalifornia\n\n0.9\n\n0.2\n\n4.4\n\n0.9\n\n22.5\n\nColorado\n\n1.9\n\n0.6\n\n10.7\n\n2.7\n\n16.7\n\nConnecticut\n\n0.6\n\n0.1\n\n2.6\n\n0.9\n\n19.6\n\nDelaware\n\n1.6\n\n0.3\n\n5.7\n\n0.0\n\n17.5\n\nFlorida\n\n3.3\n\n1.4\n\n9.8\n\n0.6\n\n6.9\n\nGeorgia\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n5.4\n\nHawaii\n\n0.6\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nIdaho\n\nno data\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nIllinois\n\n1.4\n\n0.4\n\n5.7\n\n0.9\n\n15.7\n\nIndiana\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nn/a\n\nIowa\n\n3.8\n\n2.4\n\n40.6\n\n12.2\n\n16.8\n\nLouisiana\n\n11.0\n\n4.2\n\n21.7\n\n0.0\n\n5.2\n\nMaryland\n\n0.4\n\n0.1\n\n1.2\n\n0.0\n\n10.6\n\nMassachusetts\n\n1.8\n\n0.9\n\n8.8\n\n2.6\n\n9.7\n\nMichigan\n\n5.3\n\n1.9\n\n23.1\n\n2.6\n\n12.4\n\nMinnesota\n\n0.1\n\n0.04\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nn/a\n\nMississippi\n\n0.9\n\n0.7\n\n1.3\n\n0.0\n\n1.7\n\nMissouri\n\n3.5\n\n1.8\n\n14.5\n\n0.0\n\n7.9\n\nMontana\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n6.1\n\nn/a\n\nNebraska\n\n2.0\n\n1.0\n\n18.6\n\n0.0\n\n18.1\n\nNevada\n\n1.5\n\n1.1\n\n4.6\n\n0.8\n\n4.3\n\nNew Hampshire\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.0\n\n6.8\n\n0.0\n\nNew Jersey\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nNorth Carolina\n\n1.1\n\n0.2\n\n3.0\n\n0.0\n\n14.6\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n16.6\n\nn/a\n\nOhio\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.0\n\nn/a\n\nOklahoma\n\n2.3\n\n1.2\n\n12.6\n\n2.1\n\n10.3\n\nPennsylvania\n\n4.9\n\n1.3\n\n26.4\n\n13.2\n\n20.9\n\nRhode Island\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n2.4\n\n1.6\n\nn/a\n\nSouth Carolina\n\n1.2\n\n0.6\n\n1.9\n\n0.0\n\n3.2\n\nSouth Dakota\n\n1.8\n\n1.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nn/a\n\nTennessee\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.3\n\n0.0\n\n3.8\n\nUtah\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nVermont\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\nVirginia\n\n13.3\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nn/a\n\nWashington\n\n0.7\n\n0.5\n\n3.0\n\n0.0\n\n5.7\n\nWisconsin\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n3.7\n\n0.0\n\n17.6\n\nWyoming\n\n1.8\n\n0.9\n\n0.0\n\n8.0\n\nn/a\n\nNat'l Average\n\n1.8\n\n0.6\n\n6.6\n\n1.1\n\n10.3\n\n*Rate per every 10,000 youth aged fourteen to seventeen in state population as of the 2000 Census\n\nSource: Data provided by thirty-eight state correctional departments and additional other sources for the states of Alabama and Virginia. Population data were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau, State Population Data Sets, available online at: http://www.census.gov/popest/states/asrh/files/SC-EST2003-race6-AL_MO.csv and http://www.census.gov/popest/states/asrh/files/SC-EST2003-race6-MT_WY.csv, accessed on March 4, 2005. Calculations are based on Census 2000 data.\n\nIn every single state, the rate for black youth sentenced to life without parole exceeds that of white youth. The highest black rate in an individual state-40.5 (in Iowa)-is just under nine times greater than the highest white rate of 4.2 (in Louisiana). The highest Hispanic rate of 16.6 (in North Dakota) is 3.6 times greater than Louisiana's rate for whites.\n\nTable 7 also indicates that there is a sizeable spread between the highest and lowest rates within racial groups, but the differential for black youth is by far the greatest. For black youth, the life without parole rates range from 40.6 in Iowa to .3 in Tennessee. For Hispanics, the highest rate is 16.6 in North Dakota, and the lowest is .6 in Florida. Finally, for white youth, the range is much smaller, from 4.2 in Louisiana to .04 in Minnesota.\n\nIn Figure 8, we have ordered the states according to the size of the ratio of their black rates of youth offenders sentenced to life without parole compared to white rates.\n\nFigure 8\n\nSource: See Table 7, above.\n\nThe highest black/white ratio is that of California: black youth in that state are 22.5 times more likely to be serving a sentence of life without parole than white youth. Mississippi's black to white ratio is the lowest in the nation-blacks are only 1.7 times more likely to be serving the sentence than whites. Our inability to draw conclusions about racial disparities in sentencing from this data highlights the need for states, the federal government, and independent experts to compile disaggregated data on this issue.\n\nCase Study: Emily F.\n\nEmily F. was age fourteen in this photo and age fifteen when she committed her crime.\n\n© 2005 Private.\n\nEmily F. was reportedly violently raped when she was twelve years old. She was placed by her mother in a group home in Iowa, where she was treated for depression. Emily, who committed her crime in 1994 when she was fifteen years old, believes her crime is linked to her use of Prozac, a medication that is used to\n\ntreat depression \"by increasing the amount of serotonin, a natural substance in the brain that helps maintain mental balance.\"[70]\n\nAccording to Emily, she told her doctor three times prior to her crime that she was having violent hallucinations that she feared were triggered by the Prozac. Emily's mother also told the doctor that she herself had to be taken off of Prozac because of negative side effects.[71] Five days after that meeting, Emily was arrested for murdering her aunt, a woman that she \"had no reason to harm and had spent every summer and most weekends with since [she] was three years old.\"[72]\n\nAt Emily's trial, contradictory evidence was introduced about whether her crime was premeditated or an impulsive reaction to her medication. One resident of the group home alleged that Emily told her of a plan to kill her aunt and\n\nto take her money, and mentioned this plan several times in the days and hours leading up to the crime. This same resident \"noticed defendant appeared more and more volatile and upset\" near to the day of the crime.[73]\n\nHowever, Emily's psychiatrist testified that she \"did not know the difference between right and wrong and was incapable of understanding the nature of her acts on October 25 because she was in a psychotic state.\"[74]He stated that just prior to the murder, Emily \"experienced an 'affective storm' which totally overwhelmed all other operations of her brain, leaving her in a dangerous limbic psychotic state before murdering [her aunt].\"[75] However, the state's psychiatrist, Dr. Taylor, disputed any claim of insanity and \"noted the various medications defendant was then receiving, including Prozac, would not have had any adverse consequences for her.\"[76]Dr. Taylor also noted that the defendant was receiving Thorazine at the time of the murder, which he said had the effect of making one less inclined to be aggressive.\n\nV. The Difference between Youth and Adults\n\nIt is axiomatic that children are in the process of growing up, both physically and mentally. Their forming identities make young offenders excellent candidates for rehabilitation-they are far more able than adults to learn new skills, find new values, and re-embark on a better, law-abiding life. Justice is best served when these rehabilitative principles, at the core of human rights standards, are at the heart of any punishments imposed on child offenders. Sentences must take into account both the gravity of the crime as well as the culpability or blameworthiness of the offender. The question of culpability is what separates children from adults. While children can commit acts as violent and deadly as those adults commit, their blameworthiness is different by virtue of their immaturity. Their punishment should acknowledge that substantial difference.\n\nChildren may know right from wrong: proponents of adult sentences for children correctly point out that most children, even a six-year-old, can parrot the phrase that it is \"wrong\" to kill, albeit often without any real understanding of what killing means or why it is wrong. But by virtue of their immaturity, children have less developed capacities than adults to control their impulses, to use reason to guide their behavior, and to think about the consequences of their conduct. They are, in short, still \"growing up.\" A sentence of life without parole negates that reality, treating child offenders as though their characters are already irrevocably set.\n\nThe Difference According to Psychology\n\nPsychological research confirms what every parent knows: children, including teenagers, act more irrationally and immaturely than adults. According to many psychologists, adolescents are less able than adults to perceive and understand the long-term consequences of their acts, to think autonomously instead of bending to peer pressure or the influence of older friends and acquaintances, and to control their emotions and act rationally instead of impulsively. All of these tendencies affect a child's ability to make reasoned decisions.\n\nPsychologists have long attributed the differences between adults and children to either cognitive or psychosocial differences. Cognitive theories suggest that children simply think differently than adults, while psychosocial explanations propose that children lack social and emotional capabilities that are better developed in adults.[77]\n\nResearch has established that adolescent thinking is present-oriented and tends to either ignore or discount future outcomes and implications.[78] At least one researcher has found that teenagers typically have a very short time-horizon, looking only a few days into the future when making decisions.[79] Another study concluded that only 25 percent of tenth graders (whose average age is sixteen), compared to 42 percent of twelfth graders (whose average age is eighteen), considered the long-term consequences of important decisions.[80] To the extent that adolescents do consider the implications of their acts, they emphasize short-term consequences, perceiving and weighing longer-term consequences to a lesser degree.[81]\n\nPsychological research also consistently demonstrates that children have a greater tendency than adults to make decisions based on emotions, such as anger or fear, rather than logic and reason.[82] Studies further confirm that stressful situations only heighten the risk that emotion, rather than rational thought, will guide the choices children\n\nmake.[83] In the most emotionally taxing circumstances, children are less able to use whatever high-level reasoning skills they may possess, meaning that even mature young people will often revert to more child-like and impulsive decision-making processes under extreme pressure.[84]\n\nGregory C., who was fifteen when he shot and killed a police officer who had pulled him over for speeding in a stolen car, described his state of mind at the time:\n\nA kid just does something-whether it's an accident or intentional. I mean personally, me, I was fifteen years old . . . I didn't know what I was doing. I was still a kid. . . . Kids do a lot of stupid things . . . The person I was when I was fifteen, I really didn't have any morals, I didn't even know who I was at that time. I hate to admit it, but I was real ignorant.[85]\n\nThe Difference According to Neuroscience\n\nNeuroscientists using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to study the brain are now providing a physiological explanation for the features of adolescence that developmental psychologists-as well as parents and teachers-have identified for years.[86] These MRI studies reveal that children have physiologically less-developed means of controlling themselves.\n\nNeuroscientists have produced MRI images of the anatomy and function of the brain at different ages and while an individual performs a range of tasks.[87] They have uncovered striking differences between the brains of adolescents and those of adults. Much of this scientific research into the biological distinctions between adults and children reveals that these differences occur along an age continuum-they do not magically disappear at a given age-and the rate at which the adolescent brain acquires adult capabilities differs from individual to individual. Nevertheless, researchers have identified broad patterns of change in adolescents that begin with puberty and continue into young adulthood.\n\nA key difference between adolescent and adult brains concerns the frontal lobe. The frontal lobe of teenagers is composed of different quantities and types of cell matter and has different neural features than the adult brain. Researchers have linked the frontal lobe (especially a part of the frontal lobe called the prefrontal cortex) to \"regulating aggression, long-range planning, mental flexibility, abstract thinking, the capacity to hold in mind related pieces of information, and perhaps moral judgment.\"[88] In children, the frontal lobe has not developed sufficiently to perform these functions. Throughout puberty, the frontal lobe undergoes substantial transformations that increase the individual's ability to undertake decision-making that projects into the future and to weigh rationally the consequences of a particular course of action.[89]\n\nThese cell and neural developments in the brain provide an anatomical basis for concluding that youth up to age eighteen are, on average, less responsible for criminal acts than adults. As Daniel Weinberger, director of the Clinical Brain Disorders Laboratory at the National Institutes of Health explains, the developed frontal lobe, including its prefrontal cortex, \"allows us to act on the basis of reason. It can preclude an overwhelming tendency for action. . . . It also allows us to consciously control our tendency to have impulsive behavior.\"[90]\n\nAddressing youth violence, Weinberger explains:\n\nI doubt that most school shooters intended to kill, in the adult sense of permanently ending a life and paying the consequences for the rest of their lives. Such intention would require a mature prefrontal cortex, which could anticipate the future and rationally appreciate cause and effect . . . The [juvenile] brain does not have the biological machinery to inhibit impulses in the service of long-term planning.[91]\n\nIn addition, because their frontal lobe functions poorly, adolescents tend to use a part of the brain called the amygdala during their decision-making.[92] The amygdala is a locus for impulsive and aggressive behavior, and its dominance over the undeveloped frontal lobe makes adolescents \"more prone to react with gut instincts.\"[93] In adult brains, the frontal lobe offers a check on the emotions and impulses originating from the amygdala.[94] Reflecting on the dominance of the amygdala, Deborah Yurgelun-Todd of the Harvard Medical School concluded:\n\n[A]dolescents are more prone to react with gut instinct when they process emotions but as they mature into early adulthood, they are able to temper their instinctive gut reaction response with rational, reasoned responses . . . Adult brains use the frontal lobe to rationalize or apply brakes to emotional responses. Adolescent brains are just beginning to develop that ability.[95]\n\nCase Study: Alexis V.\n\nAlexis V. was age fourteen both in this photo and when she committed her crime.\n\n© 2005 Private.\n\nAlexis V., a woman of mixed race imprisoned in Iowa, committed her crime when she was fourteen years old. She wrote: \"My mother had me when she was eighteen years old, my grandparents didn't like me because I was black. I was an abused child. . . . I was abused\n\nphysically and emotionally. My parents were both alcoholics. It was very hard for me growing up.\"[96]\n\nWhen her mother was interviewed for this report, she said that Alexis was: \"[O]ne of those kids that always had to have attention. She was diagnosed with ADHD [attention-deficit / hyperactivity disorder]. But up until sixth grade she was an honor roll student. . . . I was drinking a lot at the time and I was in the streets quite a bit. She was one of those kids that wanted to do the piano lessons and baseball and all that-but we didn't have the money. I drank up all the money . . . Well, she figured out a way to get those lessons. She told the teacher, \"If I kept your car up could you give me lessons for free?\"\n\nAlexis explained that she decided to \"run away because I was getting beat by my mom and social services got involved but they didn't do anything.\" From the age of twelve, she lived in \"shelters, foster homes, detention, and group homes.\" A researcher for this report interviewed Mike Dryden, who was Alexis' residential youth counselor in the first group home she lived in. Dryden said that he and his wife found Alexis to be:\n\n\"Intelligent, extremely intelligent. She was very outgoing, strong personality, pleasant to be around. Now, there was an anger and a temper there that was just below the surface . . . But I would never have believed that she would take someone's life. When one of the other counselors told me what happened . . . it was absolute shock, my first thought was that she was picked up for someone else's crime. I could maybe see her breaking into a house and taking credit cards, when she was on the run and scared. But hurting someone else? Never. A few months before it happened, when she graduated from Forest Ridge, my wife and I took her out special to Pizza Hut. I remember I let her take my two-year-old daughter Danielle to use the bathroom alone. That was how much I trusted [Alexis]. I still\n\ntrust her; my wife and I say that if she ever gets out of prison she can come and live with us for a while until she gets her feet on the ground.\"[98]\n\nAlexis's behavior worsened between the ages of twelve and fourteen. The prosecutor in Alexis's case recalled that she had delinquency charges during this period.[99]\n\nAlexis's mother described the change in her daughter's behavior after she turned twelve in the following way: \"[S]he just changed. She stopped going to school. . . . She would get into fights, she was defiant, she had violent episodes. But then again, now I've got an eight-year-old and a sixteen-year-old, and they both have violent episodes. They call getting angry and yelling and all that violent, so I get violent too.\"[100]\n\nAlexis wrote, \"I ran away from the last group home I was in when I was fourteen and that's when all this trouble happened.\"[101]Court documents indicate that after running away, Alexis entered the home of a woman under the pretense of needing to use the phone, and she was later found to have taken and used the woman's car and credit cards. The sixty-six-year-old woman was found dead from multiple stab wounds. Other physical evidence, such as bloodstains and fingerprints, linked Alexis to the crime.[102]Both Alexis and her mother maintain that there were other individuals involved in the crime, but no one else was ever charged. Her mother says that the victim in the crime \"was a very well known librarian in that town. She sounds like she was just a wonderful woman.\"[103]\n\nAlexis was transferred from juvenile court in order to stand trial as an adult in Iowa. At the conclusion of her trial, she was sentenced to life without parole for first degree murder. Today, Alexis's mother says, \"[Alexis] is a mature adult now. My daughter–it's like she sacrificed herself to wake me up. . . . Well I lost her. She gets jealous when she hears about what I do now with the other kids, but she's happy for them too.\"[104]\n\nVI. Life without Parole in Adult Prison\n\n\"Doing time\" is difficult for any prisoner. Prisons are tense, cheerless, and often degrading places in which all inmates struggle to maintain their equilibrium despite violence, exploitation, lack of privacy, stringent limitations on family and community contacts, and a paucity of opportunities for meaningful education, work, or other productive activities.\n\nBut \"doing time\" is particularly challenging for those who come to prison as adolescents or very young adults. They often lack the physical and mental coping mechanisms that older adult prisoners use to maintain their mental health and self-respect. Not only are teens ill-equipped to handle prison, it is also an unlikely place for them to gain the life experiences and education necessary for healthy mental and physical development. Penitentiaries in the United States are not designed to further rehabilitation, and youth offenders sentenced to life without parole are often barred from participating in the few programs that do exist. And youth offenders serving life without parole face an additional and daunting challenge-they must come to terms with the fact that they will live in prison for the rest of their lives.\n\nWe have data on age at admission for 420 of the 2,225 youth offenders currently serving life without parole in the United States. As illustrated in Table 8, the average age at admission to prison was eighteen years old; the youngest entered prison at age fourteen and the oldest was twenty-six years old. Nevertheless, 29 percent, or just under one-third of all the offenders studied, were admitted to adult penitentiaries while they were still children.[105]\n\nTable 8\n\nAge at Admission\n\nNumber of Offenders\n\n14.00-14.99 years\n\n1\n\n15.00-15.99 years\n\n5\n\n16.00-16.99 years\n\n31\n\n17.00-17.99 years\n\n86\n\n18.00-18.99 years\n\n138\n\n19.00-19.99 years\n\n111\n\nAge at Admission\n\nNumber of Offenders\n\n20.00-20.99 years\n\n31\n\n21.00-21.99 years\n\n7\n\n22.00-22.99 years\n\n7\n\n23.00-23.99 years\n\n1\n\n24.00-24.99 years\n\n0\n\n25.00-25.99 years\n\n1\n\n26.00-26.99 years\n\n1\n\nTotal:\n\n420 child offenders\n\nSource: Data provided by thirty-eight state correctional departments and additional other sources for the states of Alabama and Virginia.\n\nAdjusting to Life in Adult Prison\n\nNo one, offenders included, expects prison to be a pleasant place. Upon incarceration, all inmates must face the taxing psychological and physical challenge of adjusting to prison, and some fail or just barely pass the test. Prisoners soon learn that their psychological and physical survival depends on emotional control, heightened guardedness, resistance to or modeling of violence and aggression, and an ability to negotiate the deceptive behaviors of others.[106] As one youth offender said, \"[M]y life in prison has been like living in hell. It's like living and dying at the same time, and with my sentence the misery never ends. Life in prison is no life at all. It is a mere existence.\"[107]\n\nThere is a considerable incongruity between the physical or mental immaturity of young prisoners and the kinds of experiences and people prison forces them to confront. Starting in the 1960s, sociologists and psychologists found that the negative psychological effects of imprisonment increase as incarceration continues, but begin to reverse as prisoners near the time of release.[108] Offenders serving life without parole know that they will never leave prison, meaning that for some, the negative effects of imprisonment can be expected to increase and indeed, may never lessen.\n\nYouth offenders interviewed and corresponded with for this report recalled experiencing a wide range of emotions while adjusting to prison. They reported initial feelings of fear, anger, loneliness, or hopelessness. Some youth offenders contemplated or even attempted suicide. Those who had been in prison for ten years or less were still in the midst of the adjustment process.\n\nThe Reality of the Sentence\n\nOnce in prison, child offenders must come to grips with the reality of a life-long prison sentence. For example, Jacob O., who was seventeen at the time of his offense of aggravated first degree murder, explained his understanding of his sentence, \"In all reality it was not until about the age of twenty-two that I truly understood [the sentence]. I did not know that this would mean that my whole life was going to be gone. If I would have known at the time what it all meant I would have tried to take the plea.\"[109]\n\nWhen he was interviewed for this report, Thomas M. said about his trial:\n\n[It] was very emotional and I broke out crying in court. I don't know if I fully understood but I kinda understood when they just said, \"guilty, guilty, guilty\" and \"life\" y' know? As time went on, I'm really starting to realize how serious it is. I was young, I wasn't really too educated. When I got locked up, I was in the eighth grade. All my education has come through the years of being incarcerated.[110]\n\nMatthew C. told a researcher for this report:\n\nI don't think it really sunk in until I'd been in prison for a while and had some time to look over my case and then I realized, \"man they're trying to keep me here.\" You know what I mean? It kinda sunk in.[111]\n\nCase Study: Dean F.\n\nDean F. was fifteen years old at the time of his crime. He comes from a financially secure family and was living at home in Missouri with his mother and brother. He is incarcerated in Iowa, because his crime occurred in that state. He had prior juvenile charges of property damage, truancy, and felony tampering for stealing a car, and he had been held back in school for one year.[112]\n\nAt the time of his interview for this report, Dean said he spent most of his time reading history, philosophy, and law in his cell. When asked about his life when he was fifteen, he explained, \"I lived with my mom, my parents are divorced and my dad is a university professor in Texas. I was a normal teenager. I had skipped school some and stole a car once before, but nothing violent. Never anything violent.\"[113]\n\nAt the time of the crime, he said: \"[I and] three friends decided to run away from home. We decided to take a car and I brought along a hunting gun. We crossed into Iowa and then we started having car trouble. Eventually, we decided we should try to steal another car so we could keep going, and so we pulled over a lady [using flashing lights that Dean's friend's father-a postal worker-had on top of his car] and we were going to ask her to give us her car and scare her using the gun. Everything went O.K., but then it looked like she wasn't going to give us her car, so I walked back to our car. I wasn't even there when my friend started freaking out and shot her and then stabbed her over and over.\"\n\nThe victim, a thirty-two-year-old woman, had been shot once in the face and stabbed thirty-three times while sitting in her car. Press accounts of Dean's co-defendants' trials explained that evidence was introduced placing two twin brothers (Derek S. and Burt S.) at the car. Derek was alleged to have grabbed the gun from his brother Burt, who had shot the victim. Burt then stabbed her repeatedly with a knife.[114] Burt ultimately confessed to shooting and stabbing the victim.[115]\n\nAt Dean's trial, the prosecutor emphasized the fact that the gun used in the killing was Dean's, and he also introduced testimony that Dean instructed Burt to shoot the driver of the car, a claim that Dean denied when he was interviewed for this report.[116]\n\nSome of the statements made by Dean and his codefendants during police questioning prior to their arrests were suppressed by the trial court, and the state filed an interlocutory appeal. In reversing the trial court's decision to\n\nsuppress the boys' statements, the state appeals court examined the trial record and summarized the evidence relating to Dean's role in the crime:\n\n\"[Dean] knowingly participated in the robbery by driving the Blazer and chasing down [the victim]. The jury heard testimony all four defendants knew about the gun which belonged to [Dean]. All four knew it was loaded and it would be used to threaten the person they stopped. Under this theory, if the jury believed [Dean] did not know a murder would occur, the killing is the different crime. The stabbing and shooting occurred because [the victim] did not cooperate with her attackers. This was in furtherance of the robbery, the offense in which [Dean] knowingly participated. A murder is a reasonably foreseeable crime when using a gun to threaten robbery victims. The defendants actually used the gun, and when that was insufficient to carry out the plan, Burt S. stabbed [the victim] to death. We find these facts are sufficient to support the jury's verdict under the theory of joint criminal conduct.\"[117]\n\nDean's co-defendant, Burt S., was ultimately convicted for the crime of first degree murder. Dean was convicted for \"aiding and abetting\" first degree murder and sentenced to life without parole.\n\nThe prosecutor in Dean's case conceded at trial that Dean was not standing near the car when the brutal murder took place.[118] In a subsequent interview for this report, a researcher asked the prosecutor why he sought a life without parole sentence for Dean, who was so young and who was clearly not the \"triggerman.\" The prosecutor said unequivocally that he remains convinced that life without parole was the correct sentence for Dean.[119]\n\nFear and Anger\n\nIn Iowa, a former inmate, who spent six years in prison with a young woman serving life without parole, recalled that when her friend first came to prison at age seventeen: \"She had such an anger problem. You just wonder where someone's boiling point is, you know?\"[120]\n\nFear and anger can often lead to violent, disruptive behavior among inmates. In a study of children serving a variety of sentences in adult prisons throughout the United States, the U.S. Department of Justice found that correctional staff characterized youthful offenders as \"more volatile and more difficult to deal with\" than adults.[121] Of course, young inmates often use violence to protect themselves from harm as much as they use violence to express their anger. Whatever their motivations, offenders may attack other inmates or guards. A male offender, who was fourteen at the time of his crime and fifteen when he entered prison, told a researcher for this report about his feelings and violent behavior:\n\nEven when I went to [prison] I was telling everybody, \"I don't need, I don't want nobody.\" [Friends and family] were just writing to me and I said, \"Don't write me. Don't . . . I might never get outta prison. If I do, I don't know when it's gonna be.\" I didn't wanna deal with nobody. My mentality was just bad, you know?\n\nBecause you know I couldn't deal with it, I couldn't deal with doing all that time, having that time, being so young, I couldn't deal with it. And it caused me a lotta problems when I first came to the penitentiary because I had the mentality, \"I have a life sentence. I don't care about nothing, I got a life sentence, why should I care about anything?\" So there wasn't nothing I wouldn't do. Wasn't no fight I would back down from. Even with the officers . . . so that caused a lot of problems. [I] fought on officers, [I was] stabbing officers with knives . . . You know, fought on inmates, 'cause of that mentality, 'cause of having that time . . . I haven't [killed] but I've beat on inmates. . . . Yeah, I used locks, knives, pipes, lead pipes, you know?[122]\n\nWhen he was interviewed for this report, a treatment director at Mitchellville prison in Iowa said that teenagers with life without parole sentences \"tend to go through the grief cycle twice.\"[123] He continued:\n\nThe first time it has to do with the simple fact of entering adult prison, so they pass through shock, anger, depression, and then acceptance. But for the lifers, they go through all four stages again-often several years later or whenever the reality of their sentence finally sinks in. . . . The child offenders [with life sentences] are used to acting out and getting kicked out of programs. We have to discipline them often when they first arrive.[124]\n\nSince youth offenders tend to be more unruly and violent than older inmates, they are often placed in long-term isolation or super-maximum security confinement, which correctional officials across the country use to punish and minimize disruptive behavior. In Colorado alone, out of twenty-four child offenders serving life without parole who were interviewed or corresponded with for this report, thirteen inmates, or just over 50 percent, had spent time in Colorado's supermaximum prison, Colorado State Penitentiary (CSP). Dennis Burbank, an administrative officer at CSP, offered an explanation for why youth offenders serving life without parole often end up confined in long-term isolation:\n\nOne [factor] is age-when you come in at a young age with life without, there's not a whole lot of light at the end of the tunnel. Also, it's kind of a guy thing: the young ones come in with a lot of fear, anxiety, paranoia, and they want to make a name for themselves-so they have a tendency to act out. And if they are part of a gang, they are almost required to act out . . . any of the young guys, they see it as a feather in their cap to work themselves to CSP . . . and they don't think about the repercussions. . . .They say [to themselves] \"I've got to impress everyone with what a bad-ass I am.\"[125]\n\nJackson W., who entered prison at age seventeen, told a researcher for this report that his violent defensive behavior in prison had landed him in long-term isolation in Arkansas:\n\nIf you are over here, you are with people who doing two years. And if you have life, they don't want me doing nothing to the person with two years, so they keep me confined [in isolation] until I show a certain type of mentality. And I don't got that mentality. My mentality is . . . I refuse to walk around with a cane, or with my eye knocked out, or my teeth knocked out … by not protecting [my]self.[126]\n\nMembership in a \"security threat group\" (prison gang) is also a cause for tran"
