        "text": "A Few of the Ideas About How to Fix Human Behavior Rest on Some Pretty Shaky Science https://lnkd.in/gRsx-EXw Despite all its flaws, behavioral economics continues to drive public policy, market research and the design of digital interfaces. One might think that a kind of moratorium on applying such dubious science would be in order — except that enacting one would be practically impossible. These ideas are so embedded in our institutions and everyday life that a full-scale audit of the behavioral sciences would require bringing much of our society to a standstill. There is no peer review for algorithms that determine entry to a stadium or access to credit. To perform even the most banal, everyday actions, you have to put implicit trust in unverified scientific results. We can’t afford to defer questions about human nature, and the social and political policies that come from them, to commercialized “research” that is scientifically questionable and driven by ideology. Behavioral economics claims that humans aren’t rational. That’s a philosophical claim, not a scientific one, and it should be fought out in a rigorous marketplace of ideas. Instead of unearthing real, valuable knowledge of human nature, behavioral economics gives us “one weird trick” to lose weight or quit smoking. Humans may not be perfectly rational, but we can do better than the predictably irrational consequences that behavioral economics has left us with today.\n\nThe temperature definitely dipped today, but this llama I met on my run didn't seem to mind! I was able to go on a decent run today, complete with lots of talks for my #AcademicRunPlaylist! First was an interesting talk by Russ Wermers on institutional trading around corporate news at Columbia Business School https://lnkd.in/e5hJNHjq Next was an excellent talk by Eric Beinhocker on the need for a new economic model at the Oxford Martin School. Beinhocker doesn't repudiate markets, but rather takes a historic view of the development of much of modern economic theory and considers the failing of these models and how we can reimagine new approaches to drive better outcomes. Highly recommend https://lnkd.in/eyVNh-xA Next was a powerful talk by Jennifer Eberhardt on how bias works at The RSA (The royal society for arts, manufactures and commerce). Eberhardt combines personal stories with research-backed insights to interrogate bias and what confronting and reducing societal biases demands https://lnkd.in/ebRUax8M Next was a fascinating talk by Laura Fortunato on the anthropology of human marriage and mating at the Santa Fe Institute. Fortunato reviews the research on this topic, building towards informed comparisons of the development and prevalence of monogamous marriage, polygyny, and inheritance practices. Highly recommend https://lnkd.in/exN-Vs8c Next was a great talk by George Serafeim on reimagining capitalism through the lens of performance, purpose, and sustainability at the Saïd Business School, University of Oxford https://lnkd.in/e-mSxsBu Next was a fantastic talk by Anthony C. and Shayne Longpre on the data provenance initiative at the USC Information Sciences Institute. This is extremely important work, documenting dataset licensing and attribution in AI development, which is really where the action is in the space. Highly recommend https://lnkd.in/erdva6Tw Last was an incredible talk by Ryan Calo on law and technology in theory and practice at the Princeton Center for Information Technology Policy. Calo details the various legal hurdles to the successful legal analysis and governance of emerging technology, and also cites the relevant work of my late cousin Joel Reidenberg! Highly recommend https://lnkd.in/eKUSpwza\n\n\"[There is] a concerted scientific effort to understand and adjust human behavior — 'nudges,' as the legal scholar Cass Sunstein and the economist Richard Thaler call them, that push us gently to make preferred choices. The 'nudge doctrine' the pair developed has led to the creation of hundreds of 'nudge units' in governments all over the world (including our own), that seek to put nudges in policies and procedures. Examples of actions that are called nudges include making organ donation opt-out instead of opt-in, and sending information about how much drivers would save by switching to car-pooling and public transit. [...] On paper, that sounds like a worthy goal. Some behavioral interventions do seem to lead to positive changes, such as automatically enrolling children in school free lunch programs or simplifying mortgage information for aspiring homeowners. (Whether one might call such interventions 'nudges,' however, is debatable.) But it’s not clear we need to appeal to psychology studies to make some common-sense changes, especially since the scientific rigor of these studies is shaky at best. Behavioral economics is at the center of the so-called replication crisis, a euphemism for the uncomfortable fact that the results of a significant percentage of social science experiments can’t be reproduced in subsequent trials. [...] Even Dr. Kahneman is affected by the replication crisis. Outside researchers have found that Dr. Kahneman’s best-selling book 'Thinking, Fast and Slow' relies heavily on studies that may not be replicable — troubling given that this widely read book popularized behavioral economics. It’s now everywhere, from what kind of medical care you receive to what your workplace atmosphere is like.\"\n\nSo finally, Nick Bostrom's institute has been closed down at Oxford, and he resigned from the university following that. When I got a request to speak from something something Oxford this was how I had responded: \"Thank you for the invitation. Given the number of eugenicists housed at Oxford with zero consequences, especially those who created the field of \"existential studies\" talking about \"existential risk\" from \"AI\" like Nick Bostrom, various people in his institute, the effective altruists and the overall TESCREAL bundle who have been drenched in money to advocate for the impending AGI apocalypse and utopia, two sides of the same coin, I don't plan to make any types of appearance at Oxford. I certainly will give no credence to people who talk about \"Blacks\" being \"more stupid than whites,\" \"dysgenic pressures\" (the opposite of eugenic pressures) as existential risk to humanity, with stupid people (like \"the Blacks\") reproducing and creating a species that is not human. As many people have written, the most racist ideas are propagated and laundered through academia. This has historically been the case at Oxford and we are currently seeing it in action. Oxford has been the absolute worst in this manner. So following Keira Haven's recommendations, what I plan to do is \"make them laughingstocks. Make them irrelevant. Demolish any lingering scientific credibility, and make it painful for their institutions — academic and otherwise — to continue to associate them publicly.\" I don't have the billions they get from their TESCREAL billionaires so I will not use my limited time and resources to debate anyone in this camp.\"\n\nIn 1992, the American psychologist Peter Gordon travelled to a village on the banks of the Maici River in Amazonia, Brazil. He was there to meet his friend Daniel Everett, who was living as a Christian missionary among the remote and isolated Pirahã people. Everett had told Gordon that the Pirahã have a somewhat relaxed attitude to numbers: essentially, they just don’t bother with them. Intrigued, Gordon had come to find out more. Using the clutch of AA batteries he had brought with him to the jungle, Gordon set up an experiment. He laid some out in a line and asked Pirahã villagers to create another line next to it with the same number of batteries. One, two, or three batteries was not a challenge. But the villagers struggled to correctly match a line of four, five, or six. Ten proved almost impossible. They had the same problem when asked to reproduce marks made on a piece of paper. The Pirahã, it seemed to Gordon, didn’t have any kind of handle on numbers — probably because they didn’t need to. Their way of life meant that their brains had never had any reason to form number concepts. To most of us, it comes as a surprise to learn that people can happily get by without numbers. That’s because we unconsciously appreciate that numbers are deeply embedded in our daily lives. What we don’t appreciate, until it is brought to our attention, is that our way of life, our institutions and our infrastructures were built on numbers. Whether we’re talking about business, housing, medicine, politics, warfare, farming, art, travel, science, or technology, almost every aspect of our existence is built on mathematical foundations. And that is all the more astonishing when you appreciate that mathematics didn’t have to happen. When it comes to a natural ability with numbers, we’re no better off than many other species. Humans are born only with what is now known as an ‘approximate number sense’. This means that, in its raw state, your brain doesn’t bother specifying when there are more than three of something. Our natural counting system is ‘1, 2, 3, more’. Mathematics is supernatural, in that we have used it to go beyond the natural. Developing maths allowed us to dissect and dismantle nature’s patterns and symmetries and, like gods, recast them in ways that serve our interest. The first leap was to count to four, and eventually we found ourselves establishing civilisations. We learn this maths — or we are supposed to — early in our lives. In school, we are assured that maths is an essential skill. And so we obediently, though often reluctantly, gather the tools of maths and do our best to learn how to use them. Some enjoy it; most don’t. And then, at some point, almost every one of us gives up. Few of us will learn any more maths after that moment. Over the ensuing years, our hard-won skills wither away and we are left with only the basics at our fingertips.\n\nHave you seen Oppenheimer's movie? It is said that he wanted to conduct the atomic bomb experiment out of 'the instinct of a scientist'. However, in hindsight, 'the instinct of a scientist alone is dangerous.' Despite Oppenheimer being a 'physics genius,' he completely lacked 'social and humanitarian imagination' regarding what would happen after development. It can be said that he was completely 'mediocre' in fields such as law, history, economics, and sociology. It is said that Oppenheimer told President Truman that 'judgment beyond what was ordered could not have been better judged under the circumstances of the time' or not. However, I think that if he had more knowledge outside his specialty, he could have made better judgments even with some conditions. I think the same applies to artificial intelligence. It is not good to think lightly that just because you are a scientist or engineer, you want to develop more from the 'instinct of a scientist'. Without falling into self-satisfaction, one should firmly acquire the 'social and historical perspective' of its development through liberal arts education and have the courage not to do things that go against the 'instinct of a scientist.' If you do it, and it turns into a big problem later, I think scientists should be aware that they are equally guilty as politicians. Most scientists lack the 'imagination' of how others feel or think about such things, so it is extremely dangerous to leave all developments to them. It is too late to say that they did not know what politicians and military personnel were thinking. As it is, politicians and military personnel can easily lead scientists to commit wrongdoings as they please. In fact, knowingly deceiving others has been their history so far. Scientists must take seriously the fact that they are equally guilty even if they are deceived by them. 'Not knowing' is not excusable.\n\nExploring the Intricacies of Complex Systems and Adaptive Behaviors 🌐 Dive into our latest blog post where we unravel the mysteries of complex systems and the emergence of adaptive behaviors. 🔍 Learn about societal fitness, AI superalignment, and the principles of sociological theories that shape our world. Join us on a journey through the concepts of emergence and how they manifest across various fields, from biology to economics. 💡 Gain insights into the adaptability of complex systems and the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to tackle the challenges of our ever-evolving world. 👉Emergent Complexities: We discuss the emergence of complex patterns and behaviors in various fields, emphasizing the interconnected nature of complex systems across different disciplines. 👉Theory of Graceful Extensibility (TTOGE): It provides a framework for understanding how systems can maintain functionality amidst continuous change and unexpected challenges, focusing on the adaptive behavior of units within a network. 👉Downward Causation & Multiple Realizability: These concepts explore how higher-level system properties can influence lower-level components and how the same function can be realized by different physical configurations across systems. 👉Functionalism in Sociology: We relate functionalism to the stability and equilibrium of society, where different parts work together to maintain the health and continuity of the whole system. 👉 Read the full article and join the conversation on how emergent properties arise from simple interactions to create remarkable phenomena. #ComplexSystems #AdaptiveBehaviors #Emergence #TTOGE #Interdisciplinary #Innovation #artificialintelligence\n\n\"Common wisdom tells us that science is something clear and certain, based on a method. Dienes reminds us that neither knowledge nor data interpretations are absolutes. The text is easy to read, while the topics require a certain degree of patience This handbook manages to explain and to make accessible many topics which seem too technical for the layperson. It contains many illustrations, exercises, and online materials. Its drawbacks are that it demands some basic acquaintance with statistics, mostly t-tests and that it lacks conclusions. Understanding Psychology as a Science is mostly about methodology, the logic of research than about psychology. The study of the mind is valuable and popular. Nevertheless, the book can be used by any student of social or behavioral science and by other interested people. Two things I liked the most. First, Popper and falsifiability. In political science, his ideas became dogma and were used to police new arguments. When people started to read Kuhn, the throne crumbled. Dienes shows that there is still a good point under all this rubble and points out that arguments trump fashion. Second, he explains in layperson language why statistical methodology is a mixture or a battleground of three major interpretations. These are the mainstream Neyman-Pearson approach, the Bayesian one and the likelihood theory. These differences are often masked by the technical language, but they matter: for example, Gary King`s reform project of political methodology is based on the likelihood perspective. It is always useful to understand that things which we may take for granted are often more debatable than they appear.\" https://lnkd.in/dAGWZsdt"
