She is remembered, loved and mourned by countless friends and family, having made an impact on so many around her. Doreen was born in Brooklyn, NY on December 24th, 1948. Always an inspiration, she was a wonderful sister to her brothers Dennis and James, and to her sister Karen. She attended St. Anthony’s in Greenpoint, received a scholarship to the acclaimed Mary Louis Academy for high school, and completed her degree at St. Joseph’s College, where she excelled. Doreen went on to become a teacher, but was so much more to her students, making certain each and every one was nurtured and cared for throughout her entire career. She helped to shape and guide the minds of an entire generation to come, changing lives with her compassion. At the same time she started her career, she also became a mother to four boys with her then husband, Brian Levens. She dedicated her life not only to that family, but her many lifelong friends; friendships she has retained for over 70 years. All of those friendships remain close to her family at this time, a tribute to how loved she was. When Doreen found herself independently caring for her sons, she carried through it with the unending support of the community she built. She made an amazing, loving family out of almost nothing. She worked three jobs at a time, took the world of many people on her shoulders, and rarely, if ever, complained about it. She shared her heart with everyone she encountered. And there are countless people who experienced that love and can attest that it made their lives better. Doreen’s incredible spirit is carried on by her four loving sons, Mark, Matthew, Peter, and David, her two beloved daughters-in-law, Catherine and Lucia, her caring brothers, Dennis and James, and her five wonderful grandchildren, Anna Clare, Andrew, Veronica, Juliet, and John. She also leaves behind her partner of the last few years, Joe Kilkeary, who has not only become part of of our family, but who cared for her tirelessly and lovingly until the end. Doreen made everyone she knew feel as though they were part of a family, and she made every person feel important. That legacy will be carried on in every heart of every one who knew her.

He attended Bishop Loughlin High School and earned an Associates Degree at St. Francis College. He later went on to obtain a license as a Respiratory Therapist and migrated to Florida where he practiced at St. Mary Hospital in West Palm Beach. He was compassionate, sympathetic and loved by his patients, especially the children and babies who stole his heart. Bill was a character, full of life, with a great sense of humor and an innate desire to party with his many friends from up and down the East Coast. He loved his mother's bar, Rosemary's Greenpoint Tavern, and took great pride in working there from time to time. He had a profound love for the beach and family lake house in Pa., which was the center of family gatherings and reunions.

John was only 47 years old and diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer earlier this year. He underwent surgery at the end of July to remove the tumor but never fully recovered. John was true fighter every step of the way-- he was on/off a ventilator 4 times this summer and each time we thought it was the end, he’d fool us all and came out fighting. He ultimately passed peacefully in a Hospice on Long Island with his family by his side. John leaves behind a beautiful, smart and incredibly strong 12-year-old daughter Olivia. He was a great father, a dear friend to many, a colleague, a son, a nephew, a brother and a uncle. Anyone who knows him wouldn’t hesitate to tell you how great he truly was.

Fiercely independent, she was nevertheless the “switchboard” for vast numbers of family and friends. Very fond of childhood memories of frequent, large, noisy gatherings of cousins, she kept in touch with her many scattered family members as they moved far from Brooklyn when they married and started having families. Although she had no children of her own, she rejoiced in the children of family and friends, amassing a huge collection of adorable baby and kid photos which she enjoyed looking through. Kate was always sociable and ready for a chat, and her neighbors soon came to count on her to fight the myriad battles of city life: Post Office mis-deliveries, Department of Sanitation issues, requirements for new sidewalks – the concerns were both repetitive and seemingly endless. There was such rejoicing when she prevailed! When she took up a cause, she gave wholeheartedly. For years, she completed Avon walks to benefit the Susan G. Koman Foundation. And when she wasn’t up for the exertion of those long walks, she volunteered in other ways. All the people who donated for her walks were rewarded some time afterward with a long letter describing funny, touching, and emotional moments that occurred along her way. She is remembered with love by her sisters Susan and Judy, their husbands Vinny and Herb, her godson and nephew Myles, her niece Celia, and her great-nephew Owen; as well as her extended family and friends. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations to the Epilepsy Foundation and the Susan G. Koman Foundation for breast cancer.Viewing hours are, Sunday August 23, 2020 from 2:00 to 5:00 pm.
