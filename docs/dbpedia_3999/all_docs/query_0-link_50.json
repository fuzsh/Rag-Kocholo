Manitowoc Herald Times, Monday, August, 19, 1957\n\nJAMES LODEL Two Rivers Boy Returns Into Blazing House, Dies James Lodl(sic) Asphyxiated; Mother, Fireman are in Hospital An eight year old boy died of asphyxiation and the 35 year old mother and a 51 year old fire department captain are hospitalized as a result of a fire which gutted a two story frame and concrete block home at 2302 Roosevelt Ave., at an early hour Monday. Fireman fought the blaze which made the family homeless for nearly four hours in temperatures dropping to 10 below zero. The dead boy is James Lodl, son of Mr. and Mrs. Louis Lodl Sr., who was found in a smoke filled room on the second floor of the home from which he had been brought out earlier by the father but had re-entered, believing his mother was still inside. It was reported Monday that officials of the Two Rivers branch of the Red Cross were investigating to determine whether emergency assistance would be given the homeless family. E.J. Schmeichel, chairman of the local unit, said that he had requested a case worker from the county organization to ascertain the needs of the Lodl family. Hospitalized at Two Rivers Municipal Hospital is the 35 year old mother, Agnes, who her attending physician said had possibly fractured a vertebrae when she leaned through a window from the second floor living quarters after tossing her 15 month old son, Roger into a snowbank unharmed. The fire was detected by two police officers, Al Kopstad and Joseph Justner, as they were patrolling Roosevelt Ave. in a police car at 2:20 am. They radioed the fire department as they saw the father and two sons, James and Louis Jr., a Washington High freshman, running out of the burning house. A short while later it was reported the mother dropped the youngest child into a snowbank from the second floor and then jumped to escape the smoke and flames. James, who attended St. Mark School was a speech class student at Koenig Elementary School, not knowing that the mother had jumped, ran into the house in an effort to save her. The body was found in a room filled with smoke but undamaged by fire in the north part of the second floor by (illegible). (illegible) Luchterhand took ill from exhaustion and inhalation and was removed to the local hospital where his condition is reported much improved. Fire Chief Henry Willert said the damage from the fire is in excess of $10,000. He added that the origin might be due to defective wiring on the first floor since the heating plant seemed to be in good condition. The home, which was owned by the Lodls' was formerly a grocery establishment. The last operation was when the home was owned by Mr. and Mrs. Soloman Matthias, now of Houston, Texas. Funeral services for James Lodl will be at 8:30 am Thursday at the Klein and Stangel Inc. Funeral Home, here and at 9 am at St. Mark Catholic Church, the Rev. Edward Wagner officiating.
