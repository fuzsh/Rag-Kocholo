        "text": "When did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in May 2011.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI was born in Tokyo, Japan.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied in Los Angeles and London.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nThe warmth of the musicians and management team, and the collective desire to bring music of the highest possible quality and enjoyment to the public.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nI haven’t been here long enough to recount in any substantial way, but there are some keen bakers in the 1st violins – no birthday in the section goes amiss without a cake! Lovely, no?\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nI love experiencing good food and wine with my husband, family and friends. And great art, architecture and cinema. And beautiful countryside. And travelling for all these pleasures.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nHmm, that would be telling… no, thought about it, not much!\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nBach Goldberg Variations – how could one not? Schumann Dichterliebe – I first heard it at age 15 – it was life-changing. Bartok Violin Concerto No.2 – to remind me of the reason why I play the violin. BKS Iyengar ‘Light on Yoga’ – should whip me into shape in body and mind.\n\nWatch Maya perform Chevalier de Saint-Georges’ Violin Concerto in A Major:\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in January 2003.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI was born in the south of Hungary in Szeged. It’s a university city about 100 miles from Budapest and has the longest hours of sunshine! (in Hungary).\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied at the F. Liszt Academy in Budapest and at the Guildhall School of Music in London.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nHaving the chance and flexibility to play chamber music because in my opinion it contributes invaluable qualities to being a true musician and to be able to keep those qualities alive and contribute and feel them in the orchestra. Also the comradeship and team spirit. I find the RSNO members have a wicked sense of humor!\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nEasy! A tour to Manchester in November 2008. I met Emily my wife to be who was playing as an extra in the cello section.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nLots of things. I love playing chamber music especially with my quartet. Also, cooking, jogging by the river, swimming, skiing, studying symbolic modelling, watching good films and oh yes – going out for curry! Yum-yum.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nPhotography.\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nWith my family. Because it is always eventful and I adore them.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nI would take Beethoven’s string quartets Bartok string quartets and Billy Holiday. My “book” would be Bach’s manuscript of the sonatas and partitas for violin. The whole universe is in these works.\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in April 1995.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI was born and grew up in Augsburg, Bavaria,\n\nin the south of Germany.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nAt first in the small German town of Trossingen, then for a post-grad in Karlsruhe. Finally, I went to London for lessons with Emanuel Hurwitz.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nThe most enjoyable parts of being in the RSNO are the camaraderie and the way everyone pulls together, the sound the Orchestra can produce, the outstanding quality of the players, the variety of repertoire we play, and the superb soloists and conductors who come to work with us.\n\nWhat is your favourite RSNO memory?\n\nTotally outstanding concerts include Messiaen’s Turangalîla Symphony with Thomas Søndergård, Mahler’s Second Symphony with Neeme Järvi, a staged performance of Debussy’s Pelléas et Mélisande with Stephane Denève, a Prom with Lalo Shifrin, and generally working with Walter Weller (including the whole orchestra being invited by him to a real Heurigen – an inn serving locally made wine – in Vienna!).\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nSince I heard an interview with her a few years ago, I wanted to meet Jessye Norman, as she had such an amazingly positive attitude to life. Sadly, that won’t be possible now. But I’d also love to meet the conductor Mariss Jansons, who is similarly positive. And recently, my husband took me to the Savings Bank Museum in Ruthwell, south of Dumfries. This first-ever savings bank was founded in 1810 by Henry Duncan, the then local minister, and all the villagers happily trusted him with their meagre savings. He was a real polymath with a lively conscience who cared about those around him. I think he’d be a good man to talk to!\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed three albums and a book. What would they be and why?\n\nOnly three discs? That’s impossible! Bach’s B minor Mass would be there, and Schubert’s String Quintet. But then? Anything by Brahms, Mozart, Shostakovich or Richard Strauss, or some jazz – I think I’d have to smuggle some in secretly! One book? Do I finally catch up on Shakespeare or Dostoyevsky? Or take all the Harry Potters to keep me entertained? I’d have no idea where to start.\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nSeptember 2023\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI’m from Warsaw, Poland but I’ve spent my early childhood in Caracas, Venezuela.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nWhat I enjoy most is working with this lovely and talented group of people; being able to make beautiful music in such a friendly environment is a privilege. I also enjoy the wide range of work that we do – from big symphonic pieces, film music to recordings and touring.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nI really enjoyed this year’s European tour when I was still on trial. The combination of gorgeous repertoire, visiting stunning cities and the pure fun of tour life made it a memorable experience, I’m looking forward to many more!\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nI quite like spending time in nature. I’ve only just moved to Glasgow so I also enjoy strolling around the West End and discovering new favourite places, vintage shops, cafes etc.\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nI would love to have dinner with John Williams, even better if it was on our birthday since we celebrate it on the same day! I’d be very curious to hear about his long career delivering some of the most iconic and memorable film scores.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nIt’s impossible to choose! I’d definitely have to include Mahler’s symphonies, some latin jazz and perhaps ABBA? As for the book, I’ve recently been exploring Wisława Szymborska’s poetry so the collection of her complete works would certainly keep my mind occupied and well nourished.\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO on 24 September 1996. My sister Harriet joined on the same date, five years later!\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI was born in Edinburgh (and had a Glaswegian granny).\n\nI grew up in Oxford.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI was a Countess of Munster scholar, and Senior Exhibitioner at the Royal College of Music where I studied with Itzak Rashkovsky. Previous to that, I attended the Purcell School of Music, and Junior Guildhall.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nI most enjoy the fact that no two days are ever the same. I love the steady stream of different conductors and soloists, concert venues, and even countries!\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nMy favourite personal RSNO memory is of performing Britten’s War Requiem at a London Prom. The Royal Albert Hall is a very happy place for me, as it is opposite the Royal College of Music where I had five great years. It is also not so far from Oxford, so my parents are usually in the audience. At this particular concert my eldest daughter was singing in the RSNO Junior Chorus, and it was amazing to be able to share this exciting experience with her.\n\nMy favourite RSNO tale is sadly not a memory, as it happened before I joined, but I believe that during the climax of Berlioz’ Symphony Fantastique, at the bit where the tubular bells join, the player responsible for them was perhaps a bit ‘sleepy’ after waiting for so long to come in. He climbed up the step-ladder ready to do his bit, misjudged the height/distance, and fell, crashing through them! I really wish I had been there, it must have been spectacular!\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nWhen I am not at work I am loving being Mum to my two daughters. I also enjoy teaching violin, particularly at RCS Junior Dept.\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in June 2019\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI grew up in Kent in the South East of England\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied at the Birmingham Conservatoire and the Royal Academy of Music.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nThe camaraderie and the joy of performing with so many great musicians. It’s also great to be able to live in Glasgow.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nI haven’t been in the orchestra that long, but certainly performing my first concert with RSNO will live long in the memory. The recent trip to China with RSNO was a wonderful experience, and a perfect way to get to know my new colleagues!\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nI love the outdoors, so I am really enjoying exploring the varied countryside around Glasgow with my wife and Jack Russell. I also loved being part of the RSNO running group that took on the Movember 10k in Glasgow Green.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nI love cooking and have recently got into baking and Patisserie. I am also a keen chess player.\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nPerhaps Raymond Blanc, especially if he promised to do the cooking. Roby Lakatos and his band as entertainment – I love the style of his fiddle playing. And of course Gary Kasparov for a challenging after-dinner game of chess!\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 records and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nThis is a tough question… The book – perhaps a guide to foraging would be a sensible choice! The CD’s, definitely the 6 Violin Sonatas by Eugène Ysaÿe , some Beethoven, and some Elvis!\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nSeptember 2020\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nCalgary, Alberta, Canada\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nSan Francisco Conservatory of Music. That’s where I completed a Bachelors in Violin Performance as well as a Masters in Chamber Music Performance.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nI really appreciate having colleagues from all walks of life with so many different outside interests and talents, but there’s also a real sense of community within the RSNO and I think for me thats a crucial element to making good music.\n\nWhat is your favourite RSNO story?\n\nMmm…. I haven’t been here long so I don’t have an answer to that one yet, but I look forward to making some!\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nBeing from Canada I spent alot of my childhood in the Rocky Mountains so I still jump at the chance to get outside whenever I can. Hill walking, surfing, camping, paddle boarding, any thing done in the great outdoors really!\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nMmm… I used to be a competitive snowboarder?\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nMozart maybe…. I’m sure he knew how to throw a good party and I rarely manage to get through a work of Mozart without breaking out in a smile at his cheekiness. There’s a joy in his music that is utterly contagious.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed three albums and one book. What would they be, and why?\n\nThe first album is easy, Daniel Barenboim playing Mendelssohn’s Songs without Words. Then probably the Brahms symphonies by Berlin Phil with Karajan conducting. And last but not least some Shania Twain. I’m a bit of a country girl at heart!\n\nFor a book I would probably take David Attenborough’s autobiography “Life on Air” because if I was stuck on a desert island I’d still like to dream about all the amazing places out there.\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in June 2024.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nGlasgow.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester for my Undergraduate degree and at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland for my Masters.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nA common answer, but it is the people. From the other musicians to members of management and admin, everyone is very welcoming and friendly (particular mention to my crazy colleagues in the 2nd Violin Section!) That paired with playing great music every week makes it a pretty good place to work!\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nA memory that stands out for me would be performing at the BBC Proms in 2022. It was a special moment for me to be performing to a full Royal Albert Hall at the iconic music festival with the orchestra that I grew up going to watch when I was younger. It was certainly a ‘pinch yourself’ moment.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nI’m a bit of a foodie and love to go try different cuisines/restaurants. Luckily I have people who are more than willing to partake in exploring the world through the stomach!\n\nI also enjoy sports, in particular Formula 1 and Football, although as a fan of Partick Thistle the latter is not always the most relaxing of experiences.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nAs much as I would like to say yes, I wouldn’t say so. I am relatively handy in the kitchen at least which is always handy.\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nIt would have to be Billy Connolly. The mixture of stories, laughs and life wisdom that he could talk about, I think it would be some evening!\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in December 2003.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI am from Kirkcaldy in Fife.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied at the RSAMD in Glasgow (now Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) then at McGill University in Montreal and the Glenn Gould Professional School in Toronto.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nI enjoy playing fantastic music with other fantastic musicians. Concerts are my favourite part of the job and no matter how tired or fed up I might be, I always get a rush of adrenaline when I walk out onto the stage. Playing for children is a highlight as for many of them it will be the first time they have seen our instruments and heard classical music live. Concerts on tour are always really exciting too as you never know how the audience is going to react and the halls are usually beautiful to play in.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nMy favourite story would be on tour in 2010, after our concert in Munich, many of the orchestra were enjoying a post-concert beer in the famous Bier Halle when the Bavarian band started to play the Snee Walzter – the little known piece that we finish every single one of our Christmas concerts with Christopher Bell with. It was quite a sight to see a large group of ‘foreigners’ singing and doing actions to a Bavarian folk tune! My favourite memory is one of my very first tours and playing in the Musikverien in Vienna with Walter Weller – his friends and family were all there and I have never felt such a warm reception from an audience before or since.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nI am quite involved with the education work of the Orchestra so on days off I usually find myself out in schools or nurseries. Otherwise, I have a wee girl called Katie who takes up most of my time! I also like watching films, cooking and listening to music.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nNot that I can think of – I’m not the kind of person to hide things!\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\n1. Bernard Labadie and les violons du roy’s recording of the Bach Goldberg Variations (my viola teacher, Steven Dann, plays on this recording and it such a beautiful arrangement of the variations) 2. Gil Shaham and the LSO playing the Barber and Korngold violin concertos (something loud and gritty after all that Bach) 3. Barry Manilow’s Greatest Hits (something to boogie along to on those lonely nights!) My book would have to be the Bible – predictable I know but a good read none the less!\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in May 1998.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nDoncaster.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied at the University of Manchester and the Royal Northern College of Music.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nI enjoy playing great music and being part of a big sound. I also love travelling, especially getting the chance to play in smaller places in more rural areas of Scotland during ‘Out and About Week’.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nAbsolutely undoubtedly playing “Götterdämmerung” in the Edinburgh International Festival in 2018. I remember my professor at university saying that Wagner is “dangerous music”. There is something all-consuming about his music – the huge emotions, the eroticism of his harmony, the orchestral colour. Accompanying a Brünnhilde of the calibre of Christine Goerke is also an experience to remember.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nMy hobbies include being outdoors, especially cycle-touring and ski-touring. I also perform and commission new music with my ensemble, Nordic Viola, formed after my sabbatical from the RSNO in 2016.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nI’m a qualified German to English translator and a have been a Scottish National Cycling Champion in the Team Time Trial!\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nScottish writer Gavin Francis. His book “True North” gave me the final push I needed to take a sabbatical to the Faroes, Iceland and Greenland.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nHow many Wagner CDs am I allowed and are box sets cheating?! I’d choose Wagner’s Parsifal, because it’s one of the most perfectly constructed operas he wrote, and Götterdämmerung, preferably a recording of the very special RSNO/EIF production. Finally, I’d go for Sibelius 7 – possibly the most concise symphony ever written. Also, I hate heat and a desert island would be hell so this would remind me of my beloved Far North. My book would be Zola’s Germinal. Immaculately written, thought-provoking, and always revealing something new.\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nIn September 2023.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI was born in Sussex, but moved to Lancashire aged six.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI did my undergraduate degree at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, followed by a year of Continuing Professional Development at the Royal Northern College of Music.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nI haven’t been a permanent member for long, but whilst freelancing with the orchestra I have been struck by the sense of community.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nI think playing Beethoven’s Triple Concerto with Nicola Benedetti. I watched her win Young Musician of the Year when I was 12 (and about grade 4 at the violin) and it was her who inspired me to become a professional.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nI do a lot of hill walking, which was one of the reasons I wanted to move to Scotland. I hope in the future to be a Munro completer.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nI can stand on my head.\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nMiriam Margoyles as she always has funny anecdotes.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nFor music I would like all three Lord of the Rings soundtracks, since I’m not allowed the films that would be the next best thing. My favourite books are Jamaica Inn, To Kill a Mockingbird and Fahrenheit 451 – I’m not sure I could chose between them!\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in January 2000 – it’s easy to remember because it was the turn of the Millennium!\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nBackwell, near Bristol.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nAt the Royal Northern College of Music and at Manchester University on the Joint Course.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nThe wide variety of music, from some of the greatest symphonies to film music, and the sheer amount of repertoire we get through.\n\nNo two days are the same – it keeps you on your toes!\n\nWhat is your favourite RSNO memory?\n\nThat’s got to be playing in Vienna’s Musikverein for three nights performing Prokofiev symphonies with Walter Weller. It was particularly special because my (now) husband flew out for a surprise visit to celebrate my birthday.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nI enjoy teaching the cello to students aged between 7 and 23 at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland. I also love to paint with my daughter – there are various paintings of hers around the house. I also like to compose with my husband on cello and keyboards to create Chilled Cello.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nNot many people know I’m a bell-ringer, trained by my mum and dad, who met through bell-ringing when they were 15. I’m also rather good at Scrabble – no one will play with me any more on RSNO tours!\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nI would love to have dinner with Frank Sinatra and ask him to croon to me all night.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed three albums and a book. What would they be and why?\n\n1. Rachmaninov’s Piano Preludes\n\n(they remind me of passion and warmth)\n\n2. The Beatles’ Sergeant Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band (for a bit of light relief)\n\n3. Mozart’s Requiem (to enrich the soul)\n\nI would take a book on the history of art, with illustrations of the world’s greatest works of art.\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nDecember 2022\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nKlaipeda, Lithuania\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nLithuanian Music & Theatre Academy and the Royal Northern College of Music\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nThe wonderful sense of community, touring (which wouldn’t be the same without that community), the exciting repertoire and some brilliant soloists we get to play with.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nMy very first European tour with the orchestra in 2022. I was still on trial and the world had just started carefully opening up after the Covid-19 pandemic. I truly enjoyed the challenges of getting back to full time playing, the wonderful repertoire and being united with my colleagues by the unanimous excitement of performing and travelling together.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nI enjoy working with the SONO ensemble that my partner and I founded a few years back. Playing aside, I love travelling and exploring new places and cultures. When not on the road I enjoy reading books about architecture, design and psychology. My newest passion is soundbath meditation – I have been curious for a long time and once I have experienced it there is no turning back.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nI think I’m really good at creating travel/holiday itineraries.\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nI’d love to have dinner with Marie Curie and hear her personal take on her phenomenal story.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\n1. Orchestral works by Ravel 2. String Quartets by Philip Glass 3. A CD of 80’s Pop Hits and the book that I would take is The Kinfolk Home: Interiors for Slow Living\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in May 2003.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI’m originally from Salisbury, Wiltshire.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied at the Julliard School, New York.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nFirstly, working with lovely people – the orchestra is a big family, and I really do have the most fabulous flute section imaginable! Not only are they brilliant players but we are great friends and we laugh a LOT. Secondly, it means a lot to me that the orchestra is so important to the culture of Scotland. I love that as an orchestra we all feel very proud to “belong” to this country.\n\nWhat is your favourite RSNO story?\n\nWe were on tour in Germany and went post-concert into a bierkeller. An oompah band was playing the Schnee Waltz, which we are all very familiar with as we play it at Christmas every year. The Orchestra erupted into singing along and dancing, and the Germans couldn’t believe it! Some of the most memorable moments occur when we are away on tour, as tours bring a real sense of comradery. We have had many hilarious ceilidhs in hotel bars over the years!\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nSpending time with friends and family is everything to me! My little boy is 16 months and he has totally changed my outlook on everything in my life – being with him makes me happier than I could have ever imagined. Fashion and interior design are also huge passions of mine, both which, of course, involve essential regular shopping!\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nI’m told I make very good shortbread (I have permanently cold hands which is good for baking, apparently) I also know all the words to most Disney songs, and I’m very good at spending money….. I’m not sure, however, that my husband would say that either of those two things were hidden or talents!\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nSo difficult to chose one, so I’d throw a full on dinner party with lots of champagne and invite: Elizabeth I, Sandy Toksvig, Roger Federer, Woody Allen and my late half brother Michael who I never got to meet.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nMy book would be a notebook (and pencil) – it might inspire me to write my own book! Albums – well I would answer this differently daily, but today’s answer would be: Both Sides Now by Joni Mitchell (to remind me that crying is therapeutic), The Beach Boys Greatest Hits (to remind me of my Dad who use to listen to it all the time when I was little) and the Soundtrack to Forest Gump (to remind me that “Life is like a box of chocolates” – but in this case I probably would know what I was going to get; a hell of a lot of sand…).\n\nWatch Katherine perform Jay Capperauld’s flute concerto ‘Our Gilded Veins’:\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in July 2014.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI was born in Leeds, England but was brought up in Luton, Bedfordshire.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI read Maths and Music at the University of Birmingham and followed that with postgraduate studies at the Birmingham Conservatoire, the Royal Academy of Music in London and privately in Paris and Rotterdam.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nI feel very fortunate to be able to play the world’s most beautiful music with such great musicians and colleagues on a day to day basis – it is a real privilege.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nI certainly remember after a rehearsal of a Mozart Piano Concerto in Henry Wood Hall being told by Principal Flute Katherine Bryan that I had to go down to the conductor’s room – I was somewhat relieved to find that rather than having done something really wrong I was being offered the job! It then struck me that I had to work out how best to tell my wife who was eight months pregnant and nesting that we needed to talk about moving!\n\nI would also say that our recent tour to California was a highlight with fantastic concerts, beautiful sunshine and the opportunity to go wine tasting at some of the top vineyards in Napa Valley!\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nAt the moment it’s a mixture of running, swimming, wine tasting and spending as much time as I can with my beautiful family. Watching my children aged five and three discovering the world around them is the most extraordinary thing…\n\nI also very much enjoy working with my chamber ensemble – Ensemble 360, which is based at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield. It is great to experience fantastic chamber music in such intimate surroundings where the audience are often only a few feet away!\n\nI gained my passion for exploring the world of wine through my Father-in-Law. For many years I have travelled to the various growing regions of the world to talk to the growers and of course sample the wines!\n\nMaking great wine is “in itself” an art form and I am very interested in the similarities in which we describe both music and wine such as texture, clarity, richness, balance, perfume etc. I’m sure there must be funding available for further research into this???!!! 😉\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nPossibly, although not sure I have found them yet – although I am on a single-minded mission to keep the high art of punning alive and kicking… much to the annoyance of the wind section 🙂\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nThere is nothing better, for me, than having dinner with close family or friends.\n\nThat said, although they say one should never meet their heroes – I would be quite tempted to invite the late comedian/writer Ronnie Barker, who I think was not only a complete genius but also someone who wore his celebrity lightly and humbly. His comedy was not the personal or political rant that is so prevalent today but comedy for comedy’s sake and could quite possibly be very entertaining at dinner!\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nOh that is totally impossible – there are too many works that would be too sorely missed! However it would be very difficult to not be able to listen to:\n\nJ.S Bach St Matthew’s Passion because it has so many beautiful moments – many including the oboe, oboe di caccia and oboe d’amore.\n\nBeethoven String Quartet Op.130 probably the most personal of utterances from the most human of composers…\n\nHow can I chose between Schumann’s Dictherliebe and Schubert’s Impromptus? I am currently utterly in love with both of them.\n\nI have realised that there’s not much cheery music in that lot – so I would have to balance this out by leaving Tolstoy’s Anna Karenina out and replacing it with another book that shares insight into the human condition but in a somewhat lighter way… Winnie the Pooh by A.A Milne which of course means I have the wonderful illustrations by E.H Shepard too!\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in July 2019.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI grew up in Tunbridge Wells and also lived in Taiwan for a few years when I was younger.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied at Royal Northern College of Music and the University of Manchester before continuing as a postgraduate at the Royal Academy of Music in London. I had such brilliant teachers during my studies.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nThe people. It might sound like a copy and paste answer, but it’s so true! Playing incredible music with such amazing musicians every week is so inspiring.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nI haven’t been with the Orchestra for very long, but the performances of Ein Heldenleben and Götterdämmerung at this year’s Edinburgh International Festival will stay with me for a long time!\n\nThe sun and sea when the Orchestra toured to Florida a few years ago was also a highlight!\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nI play badminton as much as I can and I’m dipping my toe into trying to keep a handful of plants alive. I’m also looking forward to trying some of the beautiful walks in Scotland.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nThis DEFINITELY does not count as a hidden talent, or an actual talent for that matter, but I can lick my elbow. It’s a pretty useless party trick!\n\nAn actual hidden talent I wish I had is to be able to speak another language.\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nPerhaps Van Gogh. I’ve always loved his paintings and a few years ago I went to the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam. I had never experienced anything like it before, I was totally transfixed and could have spent the whole day there. I would also love to see his reaction to modern art. Maybe he could do a quick portrait of everyone?\n\nEither him or the actress Miriam Margolyes. She’s interesting, absolutely hilarious and would be great fun at a party!\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nHard to choose!! I’d definitely have a Sibelius symphony there, maybe No. 6 or 7. I just think his music is so beautiful and I somehow never get bored listening to him. Would a CD of his complete works be cheating???\n\nMy second CD would be something like the Concerto Grossi by Handel on period instruments. The baroque oboe has a really characteristic sound and is so different to the modern oboe. I also find that Handel’s music has such a range of emotions and there are some really exciting recordings out there!\n\nFor my last CD I would pick something very different such as the best of Nina Simone, her voice is so soulful.\n\nI would have to take a book that was pretty long and something I could get my teeth into when I’m bored collecting coconuts on my island. I do like a good Stephen King book.\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in May 2018.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI am from a small town called Illingen, close to Stuttgart in South Germany. I’m the first bassoonist from a long line of pig farmers.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied at the School for Music and Performing Arts in Mannheim, Germany with Prof. Alfred Rinderspacher and later with Prof. Ole Kristian Dahl. The city was so boring that you couldn’t do much more than lock yourself in an empty room and practice the bassoon.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nI know it sounds like a cliché and everybody probably writes the same thing, but apart from the musical quality and the excitement of being part of such a great band I genuinely feel like the orchestra is a second family. And, of course, Nigel’s tea bar.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nCelebrating Hogmanay with a piper and Kylie dancing on tour in China. Slightly bizarre for my Teutonic mind but incredibly fun.\n\nGetting stuck in the middle of nowhere (literally!) in China where roads become dirt tracks on the way to a concert. At a certain point we thought we’ll never make it because it really didn’t look like a road anymore and we could not reverse backwards. Also the road was so bad that we felt slightly seasick. After only nine hours on the road we just made it for the concert and played a great show.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nI love teaching my two-year old daughter Mira how to make bassoon reeds and spend time with the best of all wives. Apart from that, I love baking bread and get quite obsessive about it. I have a walk-in cupboard full of flour and a temperature-controlled proofing box, do I need to say more? I did Thai boxing for a couple of years and would love to take it up again.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nI am very good at making compost and can jump really high. Also I am great at moving house!\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nKing Kong. I’d like to ask him how to climb skyscrapers, but I worry a bit about his table manners.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nUh, that is a tough one. First of all I´d prefer to take a record player and vinyls. And a Gramophone. Then probably, I’d take King Crimson In the Court of the Crimson King. Incredible music and good memories. Johnny Cash American Recordings and… actually… Could I trade the third one for a bottle of whisky please?\n\nAnd for the book? Maybe Salman Rushdie Satanic Verses. A good book to get lost in. Or a telephone book.\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in May 2019\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI am from Cuneo, a small and wonderful city in northern Italy, all surrounded by mountains.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied first in the local Conservatoire with Professor Stefano Audisio and then I took private lessons with Professors Gabriele Screpis and Andrea Azzi.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nColleagues first of all: they are not only incredible musicians, but people with a warm, generous heart. When I play, even if I have to play something that scares me, I never feel alone: all around me I can feel the presence, the embrace and the support of truly friends.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nCertainly the week when we were conducted by Neeme Järvi was wonderful: I was able to experience a new way of playing in a professional orchestra, not aimed at the preparation, albeit refined, of a concert, but at any time to enjoy the music that is created at that precise moment, with freedom and imagination to take to the extreme. We did not repeat anything twice in the same way and even in concert Järvi gave us new surprises. The concert itself was not an end, but a snapshot, a curious look as deep as possible, of what could be a version of music, which inevitably dissolves immediately. It was amazing, I had experienced a similar sensation so far only with the Spira Mirabilis.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nI love living life, talking, sharing experiences with my wife (who is the beacon of my life) and playing with my daughter!\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nDespite not being a good cook, I like cooking a lot, especially with my daughter and apparently I am good at making ragù alla Bolognese, because when I prepare it everyone is always happy!\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nI have always been fascinated by the figure of Shostakovich: I always wondered how it was possible for people as intimately free as he, for a creative giant like him, not to go mad in the grip of a dictatorship.\n\nI would like to ask him to share with me the real pain, what my lucky life has never reserved for me, but perhaps it would be enough to ask one of the many desperate African immigrants who arrive in Italy on crumbling boats forced to leave their families so as not to die. And at this point I am ashamed of myself because even though I meet these people every day in Italy in the street, I never really asked them.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nThe posthumous impromptus by Schubert played by Arrau because I always felt like the sound of my soul.\n\nShe by Aznavour sung by Elvis Costello because it reminds me of my wife.\n\nBassoon concertos played by Sergio Azzolini… or an opera by Verdi… I can’t decide!\n\nRegarding the books, l’Orlando Furioso by Ludovico Ariosto and Proust’s In search of Lost Time: two works that I adore in which the virtuosity of writing reaches monstrous levels.\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nMarch 2024.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nLondon.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nGuildhall School of Music and Drama for my undergrad then Royal Academy of Music for my masters degree.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nI really love how friendly the orchestra is and that the job allows me to travel and see so many different parts of Scotland.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nI really enjoyed the Orchestra’s tour to Salzburg in October 2023. I particularly enjoyed performing Chris Gough’s encore Eightsome Reels 2.0.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nI really enjoy paddleboarding and have been enjoying getting to grips with it in this colder climate. I also enjoy spending time with my sausage dog Eddie.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nI can quote the majority of the TV show Friends.\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nLouis Prima – a trumpet player and entertainer from New Orleans. He was most famous for his role in Disney’s The Jungle Book as the orangutan King Louie. I went to an exhibition about him at the New Orleans Jazz museum and thought he had the most interesting and varied career.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nI’d bring a recording of Symphonie Fantastique by Hector Berlioz as it’s one of my favourite pieces of music and holds many happy memories for me, Bayview by Project Smok (a Scottish neo-trad trio) and pretty much anything ever written or performed by Dua Lipa. The book I would choose would be Captain Corelli’s Mandolin by Louis de Bernières.\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in August 2008.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI am from Tórshavn, the capital of the Faroe Islands.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nAt the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland in Glasgow.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nIt is a dream job, or rather my dream job. To get paid for something you love doing might sound like a cliché, but it is true. The danger with that, though, is that when your hobby becomes your job, you can fall out of love with it. Luckily my colleagues at the RSNO make that an impossibility!\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nI have fallen in love with surfing. I have not done much yet, but I hope to do much more. I was surprised that I could even manage to stand up on the board! I have also got into making my own kombucha (fermented tea).\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nI’m really good at tossing pancakes, and I apparently have a knack for sheep-shearing! I discovered the latter talent on my last summer holiday back home on the Faroe Islands.\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nGustav Holst. It would be great to hear if he had any stories from his time in the RSNO trombone section.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 albums. What would they be?\n\n1. Porgy and Bess, Miles Davis.\n\n2. Shostakovich’s Fifth Symphony with Neeme Järvi and the RSNO.\n\n3. Jazz Pä Svenska by Jan Johansson.\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in November 2009.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI am from a town called Lamoine in Maine, USA.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied at Interlochen Arts Academy 1997 – 1999 (it’s a private high school for the arts, sort of like Chethams) then at the The Curtis Institute of Music from 1999 – 2003. After that I was at The Yale School of Music from 2003 – 2004, The Juilliard School from 2004 – 2006 and finally at The Codarts Rotterdam Conservatory from 2007 – 2008.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nI love the work. Maybe it’s the newness of the job, but my heart still jumps when I walk in the RSNO Centre and hear the Orchestra warming up, knowing that I’m going to be playing with them very shortly. It’s very exciting to play with such a great band, and even better to have it be my job.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nIt was just after our final European tour performance in Belgrade, Serbia. For hours into the night, many of us in the Orchestra stayed up late in the hotel lobby just playing, singing, or banging on whatever was nearby. It started out as traditional songs at the piano, then turned into reels, jazz, and a whole other multitude of genres. The mood became infectious, and others not in the band but who were also staying in the hotel (some even had instruments) came and joined us. I remember finally drifting asleep on a sofa while most people were coming down to breakfast (I think there’s even an undignified picture from the airport of me sprawled out on the seats at the gate waiting for our flight to open). It might have taken me a few days to recover, but this was one of my first experiences with the orchestra, and one that I won’t soon forget.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nAside from lounging in front of the TV and enjoying my favourite beer (almost always something from Brewdog), which I think is probably not the purpose of this question, I enjoy learning and creating. I am an avid watcher of documentaries, and I also love to read. I have been composing music since I was a teenager, and even studied composition alongside tuba while attending the Curtis Institute of Music. Currently I’m reading a book by the evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins, and also brainstorming ideas for my next brass quintet. I also like to keep active. I ran my first marathon last October, and I really enjoy swimming. Hillwalking is another good way I like to keep in shape, and it’s also a great way see this incredibly beautiful country we live in.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nIn the previous question I mentioned composition, which is something I enjoy at least as much as playing the tuba, but aside from that I also enjoy singing. Like composition, I studied it alongside tuba while at Curtis, and even sang in the chorus for a few opera productions there. Although I’ve never been very good at it, I also like to conduct. Not only for directing an ensemble, but for being able to dive into a score and get to the heart of what a composer is trying to do. Composition is very much like an emotional diary: especially with the great composers you get a glimpse at their soul by what they write in the details.\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nIt would be easy to pick ________ (enter name of favourite famous person here), but then I wouldn’t want to eat, I would just want to listen, discuss, watch, etc. I think instead I would pick any or all of my many friends scattered around the world whom I don’t get to see very often.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nI think one CD would be of the Beethoven symphonies. No matter how many times I listen to them, I hear them differently each time, especially as I get older. Another would be Itzhak Perlman playing Bach’s Sonatas and Partitas. They are not only impressive in their virtuosity but sublime in their interpretation. The last would be Mozart’s Requiem performed by the Academy and Chorus of St Martin in the Fields directed by Sir Neville Marriner. When my high school chorus and orchestra performed the piece, I was a tenor in the chorus and bought that CD to listen to the piece. I had never been so moved by classical music before then. It’s been 15 years since I first heard it and it still gives the same very powerful emotional reaction. As far as a book, I think I would bring a diary. I imagine a desert island to be a pretty lonely place.\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in April 2018.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nI was born in London, my parents are from Grenada in the Caribbean.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied at the Purcell School of Music, and then at Trinity College of Music in London.\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nEVERYTHING! It’s a wonderful place to work! Lovely people, lots of FAB music, in an orchestra that’s on FIRE! 🙂\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nThe cheer that I received on my first day as a member. I still wish that I’d videoed it; it was thoroughly overwhelming, a truly wonderful way for me to be welcomed into this very special group of musicians.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nWatching movies, Gaming, Cycling & Swimming.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nI am qualified as a “Master Scuba Diver” (as qualified as one can be without being a professional diver).\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nRichard Hickox (RIP). He was very influential in my musical development, I miss him terribly, and would love to see him again, to thank him for some of my most precious musical memories.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nIt’s impossible for me to limit myself to just 3 CD’s, but Wagner’s Ring of the Nibelung, Mahler’s 2nd Symphony, and Richard Strauss’ Alpine Symphony are some of my favourite pieces of music! I’d love to get around to reading Homer’s Iliad & Odyssey properly (I studied them at school).\n\nWhen did you join the RSNO?\n\nI joined the RSNO in June 2005.\n\nWhere are you from?\n\nLeamington Spa.\n\nWhere did you study?\n\nI studied at the Richmond School, and Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (formerly RSAMD).\n\nWhat do you enjoy most about being in the RSNO?\n\nI love playing percussion in the Orchestra. The variety of instruments we get to play along with the different sounds we add to the Orchestra makes the job very interesting.\n\nTell us your favourite RSNO story/memory so far.\n\nOn tour in Austria, Walter Weller invited the whole Orchestra to dinner and we had a great evening – though the local wine made sure the following morning wasn’t much fun! My greatest memory was playing brass bells at the the end of ‘Mahler 2’ in the Festival, half way up the choir stalls with the Orchestra, Choir and Organ at full pelt. It was an unforgettable moment.\n\nWhat do you enjoy doing when you’re not playing with the Orchestra?\n\nWhen I’m not playing with the Orchestra, I spend free time in the garden and hill walking, and cycling when the weeds are at bay.\n\nDo you have any hidden talents?\n\nI enjoy cooking – I’m not sure how talented I am at it, though!\n\nIf you could have dinner with anyone (alive or dead) who would it be, and why?\n\nI would have dinner with George Mallory. I would know if he did get to the top of Mount Everest, and if so, how.\n\nYou’re stranded on a desert island. You’re allowed 3 CDs and 1 book. What would they be, and why?\n\nOscar Peterson – Gershwin Songbook Trio. I love the Oscar Peterson Trio and choosing one album is hard, but their subtle musicianship adds a quality to Gershwin’s already wonderful songs. Nitin Sawhney – Beyond Skin. I could listen to this album over and over and not get bored – also with lots of time on my hands I could work out how they did ‘The Conference’. Strauss – Alpine Symphony."
