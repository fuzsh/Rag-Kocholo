Siobhan Thompson In the Chronicles of Narnia, the originally published order of the Chronicles of Narnia puts Prince Caspian immediately after The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe, but some publishers interject The Horse and His Boy between the two, since the events in The Horse and His Boy take place chronoligically after the events of the Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe.

While this color is now iconic enough that you can buy pre-mixed versions of the makeup called L-N#1, the original plan was for Spock be blue.

Ally Beardsley*\n\n(Zac Oyama}\n\nToday we most frequently picture Dracula as depicted by Bela Lugosi- a pale, slick-haired, well-dressed man with sharp incisors and a red silk cape.

Caldwell Tanner Of the many shops and storefronts in Diagon Alley, such as The Three Broomsticks, Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes, and Ollivander's Wand Shop, perhaps none is more important than Gringott's, the Wizard Bank. This highly guarded establishment is run by goblins, and it is where Harry first realizes the enormous fortune he has inherited from his parents, Lily and James Potter.

Um, actually, Grapefruit Diet is not on The Food Album because it came out afterwards on the album Running With Scissors. Caldwell Tanner Lyra Belequa's daemon, Pantalaimon, is an animal companion capable of changing shape and in some ways represents Lyra's soul. In Lyra's world, people's daemons change shape all the time to reflect their mood or personality, until the person dies. Um, actually, most peoples daemon's only change shape until puberty and then stay one animal the rest of their life. Siobhan Thompson Anduril, which means Flame of the West, was the name of the sword wielded by Elendil during the Last Alliance of Elves and Men. Once broken, Elendil's son Isildur used the broken handle-shard of Anduril to cut the One Ring from Sauron's hand. 3,000 years later, it was reforged and given to Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

Jared Logan Shai'hulud, meaning \"Old Man of the Desert,\" is the Fremen nickname for a House Atreides vassal, the grizzled warrior Gurney Halleck. Um, actually, Shai'hulud is the fremen word for the massive sand worms that roam through the planet. No The different colored uniforms of Starfleet represent different departments: red for Engineering, blue for Science and Medical, gold for Command and Security.\n\n[Fan Correction]\n\nUm, actually, Red is Security, not Engineering. Haley Mancini In Stephen King's \"It,\" the members of the Losers Club get lost in the sewer after battling \"It,\" and only manage to escape by calming their nerves with the ancient power of the Ritual of Chud.

Although the exploding planet would not have been able to harm the invulnerable infant Kal-El, the fearsome Zod, General of Krypton certainly would have. Um, actually, infant Kal-El would have been hurt by Krypton's explosion because his powers come from the Earth's Yellow sun. Jared Logan Sarah Williams' life is thrown into chaos when Jareth, the Goblin King, kidnaps her baby brother Toby, and threatens to sink him in the Bog of Eternal Stench unless his sister can rescue him.

Immortan Joe promises his War Boys an eternity in Elysium, shiny and chrome, if they can recapture his wives, including Toast the Knowing and Cheeto the Fragile. Um, actually, He promises them an eternity in Valhalla, the Norse afterlife. Elysium is the Roman afterlife. Adam Conover Of all the various forms of magic we are introduced to in the Harry Potter series, none is more powerfully evil than the three Unforgivable Curses: Imperio, the Mind Control Curse, Crucio, the Torture Curse, and Avada Kadavra, the Killing Curse. Um, actually, The most evil form of magic in Harry Potter is the creation of Horcruxes, which is the splitting of the soul through murder. No As the Last Unicorn, known in her human form as Lady Amalthea, arrives with Schmendrick the Magician and Molly Grue at the castle of King Haggard we find that only six beings call this massive castle home: King Haggard, his dashing son Prince Lir, Mabruk the Magician, a pirate cat, an alcoholic skeleton, and the Red Bull, whom he has forced to kill every last unicorn.

Trained by his father in the ways of magic, Ganondorf often possesses the Triforce of Power, making him nearly invincible.

Um, actually, Harley Quinn's first appearance was in Batman: The Animated Series. Ify Nwadiwe Captain Malcolm Reynolds and the crew of the Serenity have plenty to worry about. Criminals, outlaws, and former rebels man the ship, putting them on the wrong side of the Alliance, and the backwater planets they travel through put them often in the path of the Reavers; a deadly race of alien marauders that torture and devour their prey.

It was a stolen Klingon Warbird, because the Enterprise had been destroyed in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock. Hector Navarro Despite commercial success, Ang Lee's film \"Hulk\" was about 5 years too early to be a part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and so Eric Bana only played Bruce Banner for the one film.

Matthew Mercer (Guest video question from Kristian Nairn) I'm Kristian Nairn. As Hodor on HBO's Game of Thrones, my lines were pretty limited; they consisted of only one word, \"Hodor\".

Um, actually, we don't know how he gets oxygen, which is actually brought up in the theme song of the show. Matthew Mercer In \"Dungeons & Dragons,\" twp similar items, the Bag of Holding and the Portable hole, use extradimensional spaces to contain far more than their appearance suggests. Putting a Bag of holding into a Portable Hole is a very bad idea; they explode and incinerate everything within miles. However, putting a Portable Hole into a Bag of Holding is a very good idea; it turns the bag into a \"Handy Haversack\" (also called a Bag of Golding), which contains a limitless supply of gold. Um, actually, it does not create a Handy Haversack. Combining either item is a bad idea regardless of which item is put in which. Also, it sends things to the Astral Sea, it doesn't necessarily incinerate them.

He has played the Amphibian Man in \"The Shape of Water,\" Abe Sapien in \"Hellboy,\" the xenomorph in \"Alien,\" and the Silver Surfer in \"Rise of the Silver Surfer.\" Um, actually, Doug Jones did not play the xenomorph. The xenomorph has been played by several other actors. such as Tom Woodruff Jr., Bolaji Badejo, and Andrew Crawford. Zac Oyama \"The Matrix Reloaded\" introduces audiences to the Merovingian, a very old program living in the Matrix, who takes the form of a smug, French man who surrounds himself with opulence. To explain his core philosophy of \"causality,\" the Merovingian butchers and cooks a chicken while he talks with Neo, Morpheus, and Trinity. Um, actually, the Merovingian demonstrates this philosophy by serving someone a cake that makes them orgasm. Zac Oyama Titles are hard, and sometimes they need to remain secret. That combination can lead to some truly bizarre working titles. \"Halo\" had the working title of \"Monkey Nuts,\" \"Crash Bandicoot\" was internally called \"Sonic's Ass Game,\" and \"Doom\" was called \"Bang Bang Splat.\" Um, actually, Doom's working title was \"Attack of the Attackers.\" Zac Oyama\n\nEp. 24: Jabberwocky, Gelatinous Cubes, Magic: the Gathering[]\n\nAired on the 22 February 2019.\n\nStatement Answer Corrected In the \"Sailor Moon\" franchise each of the sailor soldiers has a unique elemental power and is named after a planet in our solar system. Um, actually, Sailor Moon is not named after a planet, she is named after a moon.\n\nAlso, Sailor Pluto is not named after a planet, since Pluto is no longer a planet.\n\nAmy Vorpahl In the poem \"Jabberwocky\" by Lewis Carroll we learn of fearsome creatures like the Jubjub beast, the bandersnatch and the headline Jabberwock, Yet despite its purported ferocity, someone beheads it with a simple swish-swash of his vorpal sword.

Um, actually, the singulary didn't destroy Tokyo, the city was named Neotokyo. Emma Fyffe The \"Hunger Games\" takes place in a post-apocalyptic version of North America, now called \"Panem\" as a simplification of \"Pan America.\" Um, actually, Panem isn't an abbreviation for Pan America. Panem comes from \"panem et circenses,\" a latin phrase meaning \"bread and circuses.\" Emma Fyffe Comic books have the difficult challenge of conveying sound with words, a particularly difficult feat when depicting sounds of fictional actions and devices. This has led to some iconic onomatopoeia including SNIKT, the sound of Wolverine's claws, FHOOF, the sound of Nightcrawler teleporting, and THWIP the sound of Spider-Man's webbing. Um, actually, FHOOF is not the right sound for Nightcrawler teleporting. Nightcrawler teleporting makes the sound BAMF. Amy Vorpahl\n\nEp. 25: Tournament of Champions Pt. 1[]\n\nAired on the 16 March 2019.\n\nStatement Answer Corrected Female Smurfs are extremely rare in the Smurf village.
