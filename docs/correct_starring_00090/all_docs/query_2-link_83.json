        "text": "timespace coordinates: 1993 New York City / Los Angeles\n\nLast\n\nAction Hero is a 1993 American fantasy action-comedy film directed and produced by John McTiernan. It is a satire of the action genre and associated clichés, containing several parodies of action films in the form of films within the film.\n\nThe film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater, a Los Angeles police detective within the Jack Slater action film franchise, while Austin O’Brien co-stars as Danny Madigan, a boy magically transported into the Slater universe, and Charles Dance as Benedict, a ruthless assassin from the Slater universe who escapes to the real world. Schwarzenegger also served as the film’s executive producer and plays himself as the actor portraying Jack Slater.\n\nAlthough the film was both a critical and commercial failure during its initial theatrical release, it has since become a cult film among fans and critics. The film also features Art Carney‘s last appearance in a motion picture. (wiki)"
