Murray Abraham, Art Carney, Charles Dance, Frank McRae\n\nUPC 5999010443486\n\nREGION 2 PAL DVD\n\nMADE IN HUNGARY\n\nAUDIO: ENGLISH 5.1, German 2.1, Italian 2.1, French 2.1, Spanish 2.1\n\nSUBTITLES: English, Hungarian, French, German, Polish, Czech, Hindi, Turkish, Arabic, Danish, Swedish, Finnish, Icelandic, Dutch, Norwegian, Portugueses, Greek, Hebrew, Spanish, Italian\n\nRUNTIME: 125 MINUTES\n\nEnglish Summary:\n\nLast Action Hero is a 1993 American fantasy action comedy film directed and produced by John McTiernan.[5] It is a satire of the action genre and associated clichés, containing several parodies of action films in the form of films within the film.[6] The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater, a Los Angeles police detective within the Jack Slater action film franchise, while Austin O'Brien co-stars as Danny Madigan, a boy magically transported into the Slater universe, and Charles Dance as Benedict, a ruthless assassin from the Slater universe who escapes to the real world. Schwarzenegger also served as the film's executive producer and plays himself as the actor portraying Jack Slater.\n\nDanny Madigan is a teenager living in a crime-ridden area of New York City with his widowed mother, Irene. Following his father's death, Danny takes comfort in watching action movies, especially those featuring the indestructible Los Angeles cop Jack Slater, at his local movie theater owned by Nick, who also acts as the projectionist. Nick gives Danny a golden ticket once owned by Harry Houdini, to see an early preview of the latest Jack Slater film before its official release.\n\nDuring the film, the ticket stub magically transports Danny inside the fictional world of the film, interrupting Slater in the middle of a car chase. After escaping their pursuers, Slater takes Danny to the LAPD headquarters, where Danny points out the fictional nature of the world, such as the presence of a cartoon cat detective named Whiskers, and that Slater's friend John Practice is played by the same actor who was the antagonist that killed Mozart from Amadeus and shouldn't be trusted; Slater takes these as part of Danny's wild imagination. Slater's supervisor, Dekker, assigns Danny as his new partner, and instructs them to investigate criminal activities related to mobster Tony Vivaldi.\n\nHungarian Summary:\n\nA tizenkét éves Danny nagy mozirajongó. Legjobban Jack Slaterért, a filmvászon rettenthetetlen nyomozójáért lelkesedik. Egy napon a varázslat kedvenc hősének világába repíti. Miközben ideáljával a gátlástalan bűnözőket hajszolják, át-átlépnek a fikcióból a valóságba és fordítva. A kis Danny számára csalódás, hogy Slater a filmvászonról lelépve korántsem az a magabiztos és legyőzhetetlen figura, akit eddig bálványozott.\n\nCast / Szereplők:\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater / Himself[8]\n\nAustin O'Brien as Danny Madigan[9]\n\nCharles Dance as Benedict, Vivaldi's right-hand man, a supporting antagonist in Jack Slater IV who becomes the antagonist of the main film.\n\nRobert Prosky as Nick the projectionist\n\nTom Noonan as the Ripper (the main antagonist of Jack Slater III) and himself (the actor who plays the Ripper).\n\nFrank McRae as Lieutenant Dekker, Slater's immediate supervisor, who is always screaming at him.\n\nAnthony Quinn as Tony Vivaldi, the main antagonist of Jack Slater IV until Danny's interference changes events.\n\nBridgette Wilson as Whitney Slater (Jack's daughter) and Meredith Caprice, the actress who plays her in the Slater films\n\nF.

Stone and Patrick had earlier co-starred with Schwarzenegger in Total Recall and Terminator 2, respectively.\n\nMike Muscat, who played Moshier in Terminator 2: Judgment Day, appears as a cop in the LAPD headquarters. Muscat was also Edward Furlong's acting coach for Terminator 2.\n\nSylvester Stallone as the Terminator is on a poster promoting Terminator 2: Judgment Day. This appears to be a playful jab at Schwarzenegger's close but friendly rivalry with Stallone.\n\nAngie Everhart as a video store clerk\n\nDuring the premiere of Jack Slater IV in the real world, several celebrities appear as themselves.
