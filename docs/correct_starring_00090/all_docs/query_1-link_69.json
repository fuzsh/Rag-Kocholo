        "meta_description": "No\r\none could have possibly seen it coming.  On the night of April 8, 1975, as\r\nthe live telecast of the 47th Academy Awards was calling it a wrap for the\r\nevening, the Best Actor Oscar was handed out to a real “dark horse” in the\r\nrace.  The winner wasn’t Al Pacino—who would appear to have been the\r\nfavorite for his portrayal of Michael Corleone in The Godfather:\r\nPart II.  Oscar also overlooked one of Jack Nicholson’s\r\nfinest film performances (in Chinatown), not to mention Albert\r\nFinney (Murder on the Orient Express) and Dustin Hoffman (Lenny).No,\r\nthe Best Actor prize went to a veteran actor whose simple, sweet performance as\r\nan elderly man traveling in the company of his pet cat in Harry\r\nand Tonto (1974) completely won over the Motion Picture\r\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences.  That thespian was christened Arthur William\r\nMatthew Carney on this date in 1918, as he was welcomed into this world by his\r\nparents Helen and Edward Michael in Mount Vernon, NY.  We know this\r\nman, best-remembered as the one-of-a-kind Honeymooners character\r\nEd Norton, as Art Carney.Art\r\nwas the youngest of six sons in the Carney clan, and his performing ambitions\r\nbegan early in life. He amused family and friends with impressions\r\nand won talent contests in both elementary and high school.  After\r\ngraduating from Mount Vernon’s A.B. Davis High School in 1936, Carney quickly\r\nset about getting into show business. He talked his way into a job\r\nwith Horace Heidt’s orchestra, traveling with that musical aggregation on the\r\nroad for three years doing impersonations and novelty songs.  Heidt and\r\nhis boys were the house band on the popular radio quiz show Pot\r\no’Gold (Art was the show’s announcer), and when the program was\r\nbrought to the silver screen in 1941 as a feature film, it provided Art with a\r\nbit role and his feature film debut.Art\r\nCarney was drafted into the Army during World War II, as an infantryman and\r\nmachine gun crewman.  He served in the 28th Infantry Division during the\r\nBattle of Normandy but took some shrapnel that resulted in a shortening of his\r\nright leg (3/4 inch) and a limp for the rest of his life.  Carney returned\r\nto find opportunities waiting for him in radio. Before being drafted,\r\nhe had worked as an actor on such shows as The Columbia\r\nWorkshop, Joe and Ethel Turp, Land of the\r\nLost, The Man Behind the Gun, Report on\r\nthe Nation, and Words at War…and having been\r\nmustered out, he began to appear regularly on the likes of Gang\r\nBusters, Casey, Crime Photographer, and The\r\nMarch of Time.  On Time, Art impersonated\r\npolitical figures (having previously done so on Report) like\r\nWinston Churchill, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Elmer Davis (Carney once joked\r\nthat to do Davis all you had to do is imitate nasal comic Ned Sparks), and he\r\nwould mimic Dwight D. Eisenhower on Living 1948.Carney\r\nsoon began to build credits on shows like The Adventures of Frank\r\nMerriwell, The Big Story, Broadway’s My\r\nBeat, The Ford Theatre, The MGM Theatre\r\nof the Air, and The Mysterious Traveler. \r\nThough Art would be primarily identified as a comic performer, he always\r\nstressed that he was first and foremost a serious actor…yet this didn’t matter\r\nmuch to comedian Henry Morgan, who hired Carney to join his company of second\r\nbananas on his ABC and NBC shows that aired between 1946 and 1950.  (Art\r\nwould also be a regular on Henry’s early foray into television, The\r\nHenry Morgan Talent Hunt.)  Art also appeared in a comedic\r\ncapacity on mr. ace and JANE, and from 1950-51 was a co-star\r\non the underrated Monty Woolley sitcom The Magnificent Montague,\r\nportraying Montague’s father (and other roles when needed).Art Carney\r\nstarted to make inroads into television by this time, with a high-profile gig\r\non The Morey Amsterdam Show as\r\n“Newton the waiter” (Morey’s show was also broadcast on radio, and a few\r\nrecordings have survived).  But when Art was asked by comedian Jackie\r\nGleason to portray prissy Clem Finch, the hapless victim to Gleason’s obnoxious\r\nloudmouth Charlie Bratten on his DuMont series Cavalcade of Stars,\r\nhis small screen career was set in stone.  Carney also played Sedgwick van\r\nGleason, the disapproving father of The Great One’s wastrel playboy Reginald\r\nvan Gleason III, but Art’s most famous character was cheerful “underground\r\nsanitation expert” Ed Norton, the next-door neighbor and bosom chum of bus\r\ndriver Ralph Kramden (Gleason) in “The Honeymooners” sketches.  When\r\nGleason was lured away from DuMont by CBS in 1952, Carney went with him, and\r\nArt also joined Jackie for “the classic 39” episodes of The\r\nHoneymooners when it became a filmed sitcom from 1955-56. \r\nPlaying Ed Norton on The Jackie Gleason Show (both on\r\nthe 1952-57 original and 1966-70 revival) and The Honeymooners would\r\nnet Art Carney a total of seven Emmy Award nominations…of which he won six\r\ntrophies.Though\r\nEd Norton would be Carney’s famous alter ego, it would be a discredit to the\r\nactor not to note that he distinguished himself in other television ventures as\r\nwell.  Art was much-in-demand as a guest star on the popular TV variety\r\nshows of the day (Martha Raye, Dinah Shore, etc.); he even headlined a series\r\nof popular variety specials in the late 50s and early 60s.  He\r\nperformed more serious roles on television shows such as The\r\nTwilight Zone (the classic Yuletide-themed “The Night of the\r\nMeek”), Batman (as arch-villain The Archer), and The\r\nVirginian.  In 1976, he portrayed Chief Paul Lanigan on Lanigan’s\r\nRabbi, a short-lived mystery series loosely based on the popular novels\r\nby Harry Kellerman.  One of his last boob tube forays was making regular\r\nappearances as James “The Weasel” Cavanaugh on the short-lived sitcom The\r\nCavanaughs (1987-89).Art\r\nCarney was also no slouch when it came to performing on stage.  His\r\nBroadway debut was in 1957’s The Rope Dancers, and subsequent turns\r\nin the footlights include Take Her, She’s Mine (1961)\r\nand Lovers (1969)—the latter garnering him a Tony Award\r\nnomination.  His most famous stage role was originating the character of\r\nFelix Unger in Neil Simon’s The Odd Couple from 1965-67; when\r\noffered the chance to reprise that role in the 1968 feature film version (opposite\r\nWalter Matthau, the original Oscar Madison) he declined.  Art was\r\ncertainly no stranger to feature films, having appeared in such features\r\nas The Yellow Rolls-Royce (1964) and A\r\nGuide for the Married Man (1967).But\r\none movie role he was hesitant to take was the one that would win him his Best\r\nActor Oscar.  He initially turned down director Paul Mazursky to play the\r\n“Harry” in Harry and Tonto, primarily because he felt he was too\r\nyoung for the part (Harry was a 72-year-old man and Carney was only 55 at the\r\ntime).  Mazursky persisted, and Carney’s performance paved the way for\r\noutstanding feature film work to follow. My personal favorite of\r\nArt’s movies is The Late Show (1977), an endearing tribute to\r\nhard-boiled detective fiction. (Lily Tomlin plays his reluctant\r\nsidekick, and former radio Sam Spade Howard Duff is Carney’s ex-partner.)\r\nBut the actor also shone in the likes of W.W. and the Dixie\r\nDancekings (1975), House Calls (1978), Movie\r\nMovie (1978), and Going in Style (1979—simply superb\r\nalongside co-stars George Burns and Lee Strasberg).  Art’s also\r\nthe best thing in The Muppets Take Manhattan [1984].\r\n(“If you two are in love—I don’t wanna know about it.”)  Carney’s\r\ncinematic swan song was the 1993 Arnold Schwarzenegger comedy-actioner Last\r\nAction Hero (1993). He died of natural causes five days before\r\nhis 85th birthday in 2003.At\r\nthe time of Art Carney’s death, one of his obituaries featured an observation\r\nfrom fellow actor Richard Widmark, who had worked with Carney in radio on such\r\nshows as Gang Busters.  Widmark confessed that,\r\nuntil he saw his friend perform as Ed Norton, he had no idea Art\r\ncould do comedy!  Radio Spirits features collections that spotlight our\r\nbirthday boy’s dramatic range: The Big Story (As It Happened), The\r\nMysterious Traveler (Dark Destiny), and Words at War: World War II Radio Drama. \r\nHappy birthday, Mr. Carney!",
