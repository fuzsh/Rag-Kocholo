        "text": "The film was a box office flop, only making $137 million against its $85 million budget. Although \"Last Action Hero\" has become a cult classic since its release, Schwarzenegger was initially quite upset about the film's failure.\n\nThe 75-year-old star opened up about the project in Netflix's \"Arnold\" docuseries, which looks at his life and career. The star even discusses the affair he had with his housekeeper, as well as the accusations of sexual misconduct against him that surfaced in the early 2000s.\n\nBut when talking about how \"Last Action Hero\" didn't live up to expectations, Schwarzenegger said he was incredibly upset and that it was \"embarrassing.\"\n\n\"I cannot tell you how upset I was. It hurts you. It hurts your feelings. It's embarrassingâ€¦ I didn't want to see anyone for a week,\" said Schwarzenegger.\n\nRelated stories\n\nThe \"Predator\" and \"Total Recall\" actor added: \"But you keep plodding along. And my mother-in-law also said this all the time: 'Let's just move forward.' It's a great message.\"\n\n\"Terminator\" director James Cameron also appears in the docuseries and recalled what Schwarzenegger was like after the film's release.\n\n\"He sounded like he was in bed crying. He took it as a deep blow to his brand,\" said Cameron.\n\nThe \"Avatar\" director went on to say that it's the only time he's ever heard his longtime collaborator upset.\n\n\"I think it really shook him. I said, 'What are you gonna do?' He said, 'I'm just gonna hang out by myself.' That's the only time I've ever heard him down,\" said the filmmaker."
