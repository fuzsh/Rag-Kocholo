What do you get when you combine the action directing know-how of John McTiernan, the screenwriting ability of Shane Black, and the action superstar, Arnold Schwarzenegger? Seemingly, a action film with barely any action.\n\nThe boys grab their magic tickets and dive deep into every facet of development leading to the release of this film and converse whether or not a character named Leo La Fart is funny. As both a critical and commercial disappointment, Last Action Hero played chicken with the juggernaut, Jurassic Park , and lost badly but was this the only reason why the film did not work? Listen to find out.\n\nLast Action Hero is directed by John McTiernan, and stars; Arnold Schwarzenegger, F. Murray Abraham, Art Carney, Frank McRae, Charles Dance, Tom Noonan, Robert Proskey, Anthony Quinn, Mercedes Ruehl, Austion O’Brien, and Ian McKellen."
