        "text": "Last Action Hero is a 1993 American fantasy action-comedy film directed and produced by John McTiernan.[3] It is a satire of the action genre and associated clichés, containing several parodies of action films in the form of films within the film.[4] The film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater, a Los Angeles police detective within the Jack Slater action film franchise. Austin O'Brien co-stars as a boy magically transported into the Slater universe. Schwarzenegger also served as the film's executive producer and plays himself as the actor portraying Jack Slater, and Charles Dance plays an assassin who escapes from the Slater world into the real world.\n\nThough the film was a box-office disappointment during its initial theatrical release, it became a cult film among fans and critics.[5] The film also features Art Carney's last appearance in a motion picture.\n\nThough the film was a box-office disappointment during its initial theatrical release, it became a cult film among fans and critics.[5] The film also features Art Carney's last appearance in a motion picture.\n\nPlot[]\n\nDanny Madigan (Austin O'Brien) is a teenager living in a crime-ridden area of New York City with his widowed mother, Irene (Mercedes Ruehl). Following his father's death, Danny takes comfort in watching action movies, especially those featuring the indestructible Los Angeles cop Jack Slater (Arnold Schwarzenegger), at his local movie theater owned by Nick (Robert Prosky), who also acts as the projectionist. Nick gives Danny a golden ticket once owned by Harry Houdini, to see an early preview of the latest Jack Slater film before its official release.\n\nDuring the film, the ticket stub magically transports Danny inside the fictional world of the film, interrupting Slater in the middle of a car chase. After escaping their pursuers, Slater takes Danny to the LAPD headquarters, where Danny points out the fictional nature of the world, such as the presence of a cartoon cat detective named Whiskers (voice of Danny DeVito), and that Slater's friend John Practice (F. Murray Abraham) is played by the same actor who was the antagonist that killed Mozart from Amadeus and shouldn't be trusted; Slater takes these as part of Danny's wild imagination. Slater's supervisor, Dekker (Frank McRae), assigns Danny as his new partner, and instructs them to investigate criminal activities related to mobster Tony Vivaldi (Anthony Quinn).\n\nDanny guides Slater to Vivaldi's mansion, having recognized its location from the start of the film. There, they meet Vivaldi and his henchman, Mr. Benedict (Charles Dance). Danny explains the criminal deeds that the two had carried out from the film, but Slater has no evidence, and they are forced to leave; however, Benedict is curious as to how Danny knew of what transpired, and he and several hired guns follow Slater and Danny back to Slater's home. There, Slater, his daughter Whitney (Bridgette Wilson), and Danny, thwart the attack, though Benedict ends up getting the ticket stub. He discovers its ability to transport him out of the film.\n\nSlater learns of Vivaldi's plan to murder his rival mob by releasing a lethal gas during a funeral atop a skyscraper. He and Danny go to stop it, but are waylaid by Practice, who reveals that Danny was right as he was working for Vivaldi. Whiskers kills Practice, saving Slater and Danny, and the two manage to prevent any deaths by the gas release. Learning that Vivaldi's plan has failed, Benedict kills him, and uses the stub to escape into the real world, pursued by Slater and Danny.\n\nSlater becomes despondent upon learning the truth, as well as his mortality in the real world, but cheers up after spending some time with Irene. Meanwhile, Benedict devises a plan to kill Arnold Schwarzenegger, the one portraying Slater in the film, from which he then can bring other villains from other films into the real world and take over. To help, Benedict brings the Ripper (Tom Nooman), the villain of the previous Jack Slater movie, to assassinate Schwarzenegger. Danny and Slater learn of this, and race to the premiere. Slater saves Schwarzenegger and electrocutes the Ripper. Benedict appears and shoots Slater, critically injuring him. Danny subdues Benedict, allowing Slater to kill him by shooting his explosive glass eye; however, this also causes the stub to be lost. With Slater losing blood, Danny knows that the only way to save him is to return him to the fictional world, since he is indestructible there. The figure of Death (Ian McKkeelen) from the film The Seventh Seal, who had previously escaped his film, appears before them. Danny holds Death at gunpoint, but Death merely suggests that he search for the other stub of the ticket. Danny finds the stub, and is able to take Slater back into the film, with his wounds instantly healing. Danny returns to the real world before the portal closes. A recovered Slater then enthusiastically embraces the true nature of his reality when he talks to Dekker about his new plan, appreciating the differences between it and the \"real\" world.\n\nCast[]\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater / Himself[6]\n\nAustin O'Brien as Danny Madigan[7]\n\nCharles Dance as Benedict, Vivaldi's right-hand man, a supporting antagonist in Jack Slater IV who becomes the antagonist of the main film.\n\nRobert Prosky as Nick the projectionist\n\nTom Noonan as the Ripper (the main antagonist of Jack Slater III) and himself (the actor who plays the Ripper).\n\nFrank McRae as Lieutenant Dekker, Slater's immediate supervisor, who is always screaming at him.\n\nAnthony Quinn as Tony Vivaldi, the main antagonist of Jack Slater IV until Danny's interference changes events.\n\nBridgette Wilson as Whitney Slater (Jack's daughter) and Meredith Caprice, the actress who plays her in the Slater films\n\nF.

Penn noted himself that the studio ironically then had Black rewrite the script.[8] The original screenplay differs heavily from the finished film and is widely available to read online. Although it was still a parody of Hollywood action films, it was set almost entirely in the film world and focused largely on the futile cycle of violence displayed by the hero and the effect it had on people around him. Due to the radical changes, Penn and Leff were eventually credited with the story of the film, but not the screenplay, which is unusual for a film based on an original screenplay.\n\nSchwarzenegger received a salary of $15 million for his role in the film.[9]\n\nYears after its release, the film was the subject of a scathing chapter called \"How They Built The Bomb\", in the Nancy Griffin book Hit and Run which detailed misadventures at Sony Pictures in the early to mid-1990s. Among the details presented in this chapter were:\n\nUniversal moved Jurassic Park to June 11, 1993 well after Sony had decided on a June 18 release date for Last Action Hero.\n\nThe movie was rumored to be the first advertisement placed on a space-going rocket.[10]\n\nThe film was capsized by a wave of negative publicity after a rough cut of it was shown to a preview audience on May Day. Sony then destroyed the test cards and the word-of-mouth proved to be catastrophic for the film.\n\nThe shooting and editing schedule were so demanding and so close to the June 18 release date that after the movie's disaster, a source close to the film said that they \"shouldn't have had Siskel and Ebert telling us the movie is 10 minutes too long\".\n\nSony was even more humiliated the weekend after the film opened, when the movie lost 47% of its opening-weekend audience and had TriStar's Sleepless In Seattle open as the number-two movie at the box office.\n\nThe final declared financial loss for the film was $26 million.\n\nLast Action Hero was the first film to be released using Sony Dynamic Digital Sound, but only a few theaters were set up for the new format, and many of those experienced technical problems with the new system. Insiders at Paramount reportedly referred to it as \"Still Doesn't Do Shit\".[11]\n\nSoundtrack[]\n\nProfessional ratings Review scores Source Rating Allmusic link\n\nThe film was scored by composer Michael Kamen, and peaked at No. 7 on The Billboard 200 chart.[14] The album, which was positively received by active rock radio outlets, was certified platinum on August 24, 1993.

The site's critical consensus reads, \"Last Action Hero has most of the right ingredients for a big-budget action spoof, but its scattershot tone and uneven structure only add up to a confused, chaotic mess.\"[27] On Metacritic, the film has a weighted averagescore of 44 out of 100 based on 19 critics, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\".[28] Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \"C+\" on an A+ to F scale.[29]\n\nVincent Canby likened the film to \"a two-hour 'Saturday Night Live' sketch\" and called it \"something of a mess, but a frequently enjoyable one\".[30]\n\nRoger Ebert gave the film 2.5 stars out of 4, writing that despite some entertaining moments, Last Action Hero \"plays more like a bright idea than like a movie that was thought through. It doesn't evoke the mystery of the barrier between audience and screen the way Woody Allen did in The Purple Rose of Cairo, and a lot of the time it simply seems to be standing around commenting on itself.\"[31]\n\nAbout the movie's failure and critical response, John McTiernan said: \"Initially, it was a wonderful Cinderella story with a nine-year-old boy. We had a pretty good script by Bill Goldman, charming. And this ludicrous hype machine got hold of it, and it got buried under bullshit. It was so overwhelmed with baggage. And then it was whipped out unedited, practically assembled right out of the camera. It was in the theater five or six weeks after I finished shooting. It was kamikaze, stupid, no good reason for it. And then to open the week after Jurassic Park--God! To get to the depth of bad judgment involved in that you'd need a snorkel.\"[32]\n\nThe film was nominated for six Golden Raspberry Awards: Worst Picture, Worst Actor (Arnold Schwarzenegger), Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, Worst New Star (Austin O'Brien), and Worst Original Song (\"Big Gun\"), but it did not win any.\n\nHome video[]\n\nOn February 3, 2009, Last Action Hero was reissued on DVD by Sony Pictures Entertainment in a double-feature set with the 1986 film Iron Eagle.[33] It was released on the high-definition Blu-ray Disc format on January 12, 2010. The Blu-ray release presented the film in its original widescreen format for the first time in the United States since the LaserDisc release."
