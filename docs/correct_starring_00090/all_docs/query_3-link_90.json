        "text": "Last Action Hero is like a four-course meal made at a Michelin star restaurant. The perfect people bringing about the perfect creation.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Jul 4, 2024\n\nIn retrospective, Schwarzenegger's Last Action Hero was a movie some how ahead of its time. Funny, self aware, poking fun at the Industry while being tremendously entertaining. With great villains and a killer soundtrack.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 9/10 | Mar 13, 2024\n\nIt’s nothing new that the makers of Last Action Hero don’t have a clear notion of what separates movies from life, but the makers of the other summer blockbusters aren’t any better versed in reality...\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | Jun 2, 2022\n\nLast Action Hero hasnt quite yet become one of those cult movies we venerate and, yknow maybe we should. It does have, within its bones, just a little bit of magic.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | Apr 12, 2022\n\nThere are a few men who could take in the role of Jack Slater, but Schwarzenegger embodies the physical and mental acumen of a last action hero.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3.5/5 | May 19, 2021\n\nI am happy to say that not only does Last Action Hero hold up well almost twenty years later but it remains one of the most underrated movie concepts of all time.\n\nFull Review | May 4, 2021\n\nEvery action film trope is satirized, every manly catchphrase is mocked, and the overuse of senseless violence and random explosions is parodied to no end.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 7/10 | Sep 14, 2020\n\nIt's turned out to be a beef- chicken-anchovy-and-jam sandwich: the ingredients cancel each other out, and become indigestible. By offering us everything, they've given us next to nothing.\n\nFull Review | Dec 6, 2017\n\nThe director has to boost the realism of his staging in a rather self-defeating manner. It begins to look, not that he's having it both ways, trading on what he mocks, but that he has painted himself into a corner.\n\nFull Review | Nov 14, 2017\n\nThe divergent puzzle pieces do not often fit together terribly well, in spite of their potential.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/10 | Oct 9, 2014\n\nDriven less by mammoth ego and more by wild, unchecked id, \"Last Action Hero\" works as a riotous comedy and a rigorous case study of why we go to the movies. It's an inventive valentine made timeless by audacious shamelessness and shameless audacity.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4.5/5 | May 30, 2013\n\nIt makes more than its share of missteps, yet the core of this action lampoon delivers a decent portion of laughs and mischief, giving Schwarzenegger and McTiernan an occasion to make fun of themselves while raising a little hell.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: B | Jan 11, 2010"
