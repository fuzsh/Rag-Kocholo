        "text": "Filmography\n\n1993 – Last Action Hero\n\nLast Action Hero is a 1993 American action-comedy-fantasy film directed and produced by John McTiernan. It is a satire of the action genre and its clichés, containing several parodies of action films in the form of films within the film.\n\nThe film stars Arnold Schwarzenegger as Jack Slater, a fictional Los Angeles police detective.
