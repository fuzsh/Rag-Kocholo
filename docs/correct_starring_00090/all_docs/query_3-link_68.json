        "text": "For this film-by-film look at the career of Arnold Schwarzenegger, I’ve been watching his movies in a random order and jotting down a few thoughts. The Schwarzenegger Says quotations are taken from Total Recall (2012), Arnie’s brilliantly bonkers autobiography.\n\nWatched: 22 April 2020\n\nFormat: A DVD from my collection.\n\nSeen before? Yes, a couple of times.\n\nReview: If you’ve spent several films building up a carefully honed tough-guy persona, as Arnold Schwarzenegger had done by the early 1990s, there then comes a time to playfully critique it. It’s what Clint Eastwood had done, subverting his grizzled image in comedies and drawing attention to his advancing age. For all its entertainment value, however, Schwarzenegger’s career has never had the deftness of Eastwood’s. So when he began to undercut his own action movies, he did it with less self-deprecation and more action, more jokes, more budget, more explosions, more Hollywood pizzazz, just more… more.\n\nThe action/crime thriller Last Action Hero is a strange kind of pastiche. For a start, it was made by the very people who had set the template for this kind of movie in the first place. Schwarzenegger of course was the king of the overblown action genre, and this entry sees him at his most quippy and shit-eating-grinningly. Director John McTiernan had made Predator (1987) and Die Hard (1988) – big, bold films that married gunplay and harsh violence with sharp dialogue and vivid characters. Shane Black had also worked on Predator and, more notably, written the witty, slick and hugely influential Lethal Weapon (1987), while composer Michael Kamen had scored Lethal Weapon, Die Hard and the sharpest-edged James Bond movie of all time, 1989’s Licence to Kill. These were not people looking in from the outside, making digs at something they didn’t understand. They were men ready to poke fun at their own successes.\n\nThey gleefully sprinkle Last Action Hero with cliches that had built up in the action genre over the previous decade: glossy, long-lens coverage; sassy dialogue complete with bad puns and droll jokes; outlandish action; theatrical locations; occasional rock songs on the soundtrack; an epic score; police cars whose lights flash for no reason; ‘heroic’ close-ups; a sweary and ranty police captain… And at the centre of it all is Arnold Schwarzenegger playing the maverick, takes-no-prisoners cop Jack Slater, a man with tragic backstory and a sarcastic attitude. It’s a film that revels in these conventions. It’s not ashamed or sniffy about them. Last Action Hero is acknowledging that this is guilt-free popcorn entertainment. It’s winking at us and inviting us to join the fun.\n\nWe soon learn, however, that all the movie-land tropes are part of a ‘film within a film’. Actually, it’s two films within a film: Jack Slater III and the about-to-be-released Jack Slater IV, two entries in a popular action franchise starring Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the ‘real world’, we meet a young American boy called Danny Madigan (Austin O’Brien) who is Jack Slater’s biggest fan. He idolises his fictional hero as well as the actor who plays him. During a school lesson on Lawrence Olivier’s Hamlet (‘the first action hero,’ according to the teacher… who’s played by Olivier’s widow, Joan Plowright), Danny even fantasises about Arnie in a big-budget Hollywood take on the Dane.\n\nThe boy’s world is dark, rainy, seedy, urban, dangerous – left home alone by his mother, he is almost immediately terrorised by a burglar – so the lad relishes the escapism of cinema, especially the sunny, show-offy films of Arnold Schwarzenegger. Danny is also pals with a local projectionist, a kindly old man called Nick (Robert Prosky) who allows him to sneak into the screening room after hours for private showings.\n\nThen, in the kind of plot development that only a lighthearted film could get away with, Nick reveals that he owns a ‘magic ticket’ given to him by Harry Houdini and he now wants his young friend to have it. The ticket is literally magic and somehow blurs the barriers between reality and fiction – before you can say ‘Wizard of Oz metaphor’, Danny is sucked into the cinema screen and finds himself in the back seat of Jack Slater’s car. He’s now *in the film*. As he tags along on Slater’s latest case, Danny tries to explain that Jack is a fictional character. As you’d expect, it’s a hard sell – no matter how much Danny points out the absurdity of Jack’s fictional reality.\n\nThe more aware you are of ‘movie logic’ the more you’ll get from the experience, the more jokes you’ll spot. Some are obvious (Sharon Stone and Robert Patrick have cameos as their characters from Basic Instinct and Terminator 2) while others are admirably specific, but just generally there’s an infectious glee for popcorn cinema. There are gags about Arnie’s career, for example, and about the fake 555 phone number used in movies and about how all women in Hollywood films are attractive. It’s a complex matrix of references and levels of meaning, and it’s to the film’s credit that you never feel bogged down in naval-gazing. Far from it, Last Action Hero is as light and bouncy and *fun* as the best of the movies it’s affectionately mocking.\n\nMeanwhile, there’s still a big, brash, action-based crime thriller going on alongside all the postmodern play. Charles Dance’s eccentric and ambitious villain, Benedict, is a gangster who wears patterned contact lenses just because it looks cool. After run-ins with Jack and Danny, he accidentally finds the magic ticket and realises he can use it to cross over into Danny’s world. (With its apathy towards crime and its lack of heroes, it seems much more to his tastes.) Jack and Danny give chase, which results in some pathos when Jack realises he’s a fictional creation (and that his dead son wasn’t even real in the first place). To balance this sadness, there’s also the mindbendingly meta fun of him attending the premiere of Jack Slater IV alongside the real Arnold Schwarzenegger and a host of other genuine celebrities. But that sums Last Action Hero up in a knowingly self-referential nutshell. Just like the 1999 sci-fi spoof Galaxy Quest, another film that does postmodern things wth its subject matter, Last Action Hero manages to both *be* the thing it’s satirising as well as a piece of satire. Fantastically enjoyable.\n\nSchwarzenegger Says: ‘I was also the movie’s executive producer, which meant that I had to approve every facet of the project: developing the script, picking the director and cast, lining up the studio for financing, distribution and marketing, setting the budget, getting a PR firm on board, planning the foreign release, and on and on. The added responsibility was a pleasure. In the past, I’d often taken an active hand in my movies, bringing together the deal or lining up the director, and, of course, planning the marketing. But sometimes when I said, “Let me see over the poster” or “Let’s figure out a better photo to use,” I felt like I was butting in. Now I could be involved in everything, from dreaming up promotional stunts to approving the prototypes for Jack Slater toys.’\n\nNine rubber baby buggy bumpers out of 10"
