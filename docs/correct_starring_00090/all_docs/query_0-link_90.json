        "text": "LAST ACTION HERO really is a staple of 90’s action films and it is perhaps one of the best satire’s on the genre. It really is a misunderstood film and perfect for this months theme.\n\n@supermarcey\n\nSo did no body actually understand this film was a piss take on the over the top action genre? #LastActionHero\n\nIt’s actually a clever and fun film, I’ve always loved it! It’s easily one of Arnie’s better roles and performances. #LastActionHero\n\nThe cameos and one liners are so ridiculous it’s bloody awesome! #LastActionHero\n\nTom Noonan always a genius casting choice #LastActionHero\n\nI do wish Arnie actually had a Jack Slater film series #LastActionHero\n\nThe opening scene gives you clues about what this film is but it’s just so cleverly done you don’t realise until it’s a film within a film\n\nWhat sort of a crappy derelict cinema is that? #LastActionHero\n\nAre we ever going to get Arnie in Hamlet??? #LastActionHero\n\n“And Hamlet is taking out the trash” #LastActionHero\n\nAustin O’Brien had some great films under his belt in the 90’s, talented kid #LastActionHero\n\nI think he became a professional photographer now. Still talented #LastActionHero\n\nSeriously could this kid live a shittier life? #LastActionHero\n\nKid gets told to go straight home, runs to cinema instead. I probably would have done that too. #LastActionHero\n\nSo many films where kids are friends with old dudes, how did they ever meet? #LastActionHero\n\nThe kid finds himself in the movie, we all wish we could jump into our fav films. #LastActionHero\n\nLet’s just add Houdini in this film for no reason #LastActionHero\n\nHow is this cinema still running if there aren’t any customers aside from a kid who never pays? #LastActionHero\n\nSeriously though this film has such an awesome cast! Charles Dance, Art Carney, F Murray Abraham, Robert Prosky and ect ect #LastActionHero\n\nCharles Dance basically rules this film! #LastActionHero\n\nThe best part about Arnie in films, he has such American names but has such a strong Austrian accent #LastActionHero\n\nThis film is a great example of how you do a satire on a genre, spoof it. Those morons who do those Date Movie films are beyond clueless.\n\nOh look ACME dynamite! #LastActionHero\n\nHe shoots dynamite away, that’s like shooting fire out. #LastActionHero\n\nWhat film would you want to be thrown into? I vote The Wizard Of OZ, munchkin land here I come! #LastActionHero\n\nOnly Arnie could get away with driving a car without his hands on the wheel and not crash #LastActionHero\n\nLots of awesome over the top action and this film takes no prisoners! #LastActionHero\n\nI love how genuinely hysterical this film is. #LastActionHero\n\nOh here we go, chicken time! #LastActionHero\n\nDid they crash a George Michael music video? #LastActionHero\n\nOnly Arnie could light a cigar up with dynamite #LastActionHero\n\nOh look Sharon Stone and the T-1000 #LastActionHero\n\nMost insane movie police station ever #LastActionHero\n\nYay F Murray!!!! I love him #LastActionHero\n\nRandom Amadeus reference to boot lol #LastActionHero\n\nAn animated cat, yeah that’s normal #LastActionHero\n\nHaha buddy movie #LastActionHero\n\nTake a drink everytime Austin O’Brien says ‘movie’ – alcoholic coma in 10 minutes #LastActionHero\n\nYes! Stallone as The Terminator! #LastActionHero\n\n*sigh* I miss video stores #LastActionHero\n\nOh Arnie, you’re so funny in this #LastActionHero\n\nWasn’t this big guy in Three Ninjas? #LastActionHero\n\nNo body can poke fun of themselves quite like Arnie #LastActionHero\n\nWow those dogs did the pyramid #LastActionHero\n\nWhat happened to Bridget Wilson? She was such a 90’s babe. #LastActionHero\n\n“Hello Toto” only Charles Dance could make that line awesome #LastActionHero\n\nDamn he harmed a hair on her head #LastActionHero\n\nBridget Wilson sure had a set of lungs on her #LastActionHero\n\nI think this film inspired John Woo’s American stuff #LastActionHero\n\nThose guns are magical, they never need reloading #LastActionHero\n\nReally odd E.T. reference #LastActionHero\n\nThe collection of glass eyes is pretty rad #LastActionHero\n\nThe Twlight Zone music hit at just the right moment #LastActionHero\n\nHe can’t swear because it’s PG-13 hahaha #LastActionHero\n\nI really can’t stop laughing at the hilarity of this film #LastActionHero\n\nHe said you can’t trust F Murray, and it’s true. He killed Mo-zart #LastActionHero\n\nGreat whiskers saved the day! #LastActionHero\n\nI can’t even describe how insane this scene is! Arnie stealing a dead body with a bomb inside #LastActionHero\n\nEveryone at a mob funeral has some kind of gun #LastActionHero\n\nNo weapons needed reloading in his film, endless bullets when convenient #LastActionHero\n\nThe clock counting down always lasts longer than it’s meant to #LastActionHero\n\nHe managed to wipe off all the tar with one tissue #LastActionHero\n\n“Now you try do a 360 on me?” “180” #LastActionHero\n\nWhen they go to the real world this film gets ridiculous #LastActionHero\n\nThe insane movie OTT action don’t work in the real world hahahaha #LastActionHero\n\nLol you gotta reload guns #LastActionHero\n\n“I’ve never met a fictional character before.” #LastActionHero\n\nHeh Jack Slater can’t pronounce Schwarzenegger #LastActionHero\n\n“I just shot somebody and I did it on purpose.” #LastActionHero\n\nWhy was he colouring in the newspaper ad for Dracula? #LastActionHero\n\nI never noticed just how many film references are in this film, from Night Of The Living Dead to Witness #LastActionHero\n\nOMG I love the movie premiere #LastActionHero\n\n“We only killed 48 people” #LastActionHero\n\nYay Van Damme! Best cameo of the movie #LastActionHero\n\nOh no now to relive the ending to Jack Slater III #LastActionHero\n\nTom Noonan should be in everything #LastActionHero\n\nBut so should Charles Dance #LastActionHero\n\nThe climax of the film is really well handled #LastActionHero\n\nThis is a long film, but it doesn’t feel like it #LastActionHero\n\nSad but true the bad guys can win in the real world #LastActionHero\n\n“No sequel for you” boom! #LastActionHero\n\nIan McKellen as Death from The Seventh Seal #LastActionHero\n\nSo random how Death just comes along #LastActionHero\n\nThank goodness all is back to normal #LastActionHero\n\nWhy did Danny DeVito never play an animated cat detective called whiskers #LastActionHero\n\nHaha I love how he tells the Captain to stop screaming #LastActionHero\n\nNo wonder the film is awesome, co written by Shane Black #LastActionHero"
