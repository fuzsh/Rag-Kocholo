Morgan Weistling

Nationally recognized as one of America’s top contemporary painters today. A successful illustrator in the Hollywood movie industry for fourteen years, Weistling made a transition to the world of fine art in 1998 that has been meteoric in so small sense of the word. His earliest influence was his artist father on whose lap Morgan sat and sketched at just nineteen months of age. At the age of 15, he began his serious art training in the Los Angeles area at Brandes Art Institute, run by Fred Fixler. Fixler was train classically by famed muralist, Frank Reilly. Under Fixler’s tutelage, Weistling learned to paint by studying how light and tone tell the story of form.
