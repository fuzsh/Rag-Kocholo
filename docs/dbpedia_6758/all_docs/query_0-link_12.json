        "text": "Offenbach, 30 May 2023 – The notable feature of spring in Germany this year was precipitation. Thus, March 2023 saw more precipitation than any March since 2001. Also, it has been 15 years since as much rain fell in April. It was not until May that lower precipitation was recorded nationwide, with the north-east experiencing a drought of almost unprecedented intensity. Overall, spring was just a little too wet and also slightly too mild. Sunshine over the last three months was average overall, as the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) established after an initial analysis of the observations from its approximately 2,000 measuring stations.\n\nFrosty start to spring with early summer as the finale\n\nOverall, the areal average for temperatures in spring 2023 was 8.7 degrees Celsius (°C), which is 1.0 degree higher than the figure for the international reference period 1961–1990. Compared to the current warmer 1991–2020 period, the deviation was minus 0.2 degrees. Spring started on a frosty note and Deutschneudorf-Brüderwiese in the Ore Mountains marked the occasion with the lowest temperature nationwide (-14.2 °C) on 1 March. Although April 2023 saw normal temperatures on average, it was the first time since 2008 that no summer day (≥ 25 °C) was recorded in April. The 25-degree mark was first exceeded as late as on 4 May, initially in the Upper Rhine Valley and then later more widespread on 21/22 May. It was during the latter spell that the highest spring temperature of 29.9 °C was recorded on 22 May in Waghäusel-Kirrlach, Baden-Württemberg. Early summer temperatures were again recorded nationwide as spring reached its finale.\n\nOn average, wettest spring for 10 years nationwide, but a drought emerging in the north-east\n\nDuring the spring, Germany saw average precipitation of around 200 litres per square metre (l/m²). When compared to the period 1961–1990, precipitation of 186 l/m² is around 8 per cent higher. A positive deviation of 17 per cent was calculated compared with 1991–2020 (171 l/m²). Spring 2023 brought the eleventh wettest March since measurements began and the wettest April since 2008. Precipitation only became less during the second half of May. Overall, some regions of the western low mountains recorded total amounts of over 400 l/m² during the spring and precipitation in the Alps even exceeded 600 l/m². The highest daily precipitation of 106.2 l/m² was recorded on 16 May at Bischofswiesen-Winkl in Berchtesgadener Land. In contrast, many places in the Baltic Sea area have not seen anywhere near such amounts in the last three months. The figures here are around 60 to 90 l/m². May especially recorded historically low precipitation in this region.\n\nWidespread balanced sunshine duration with most sun along the Baltic Sea coast\n\nAt nearly 500 hours, the sunshine duration in the spring was around 7 per cent higher than the average of 467 hours during the period of 1961–1990. Compared to 1991– 2020 (522 hours),\n\nthe deviation was around 4 per cent lower than normal. Most sunshine was recorded along the Baltic Sea coast with 600 to 700 hours. Totals for the Alps, in particular, were less than 400 hours.\n\nAll the monthly values stated in this press release are provisional figures. The data used for the last two days of the season are based on forecasts. Some of the measurements from DWD's network of stations were not yet available at the time of publication."
