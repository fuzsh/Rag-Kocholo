        "text": "In this study, we investigated the burden of disease in a group of 37 adult patients with HAE treated in our ACARE center in Leipzig, Germany. To our knowledge, this is the first study to correlate the patient-reported disease control with psychosocial scores and treatment regime.\n\nOur results show a long diagnostic delay, misdiagnoses, and family burden due to HAE, which is consistent with previously published data. Other study groups reported an average diagnostic delay of 8.5 years with up to 65% of patients receiving at least 1 misdiagnosis and 24% reporting dispensable medical interventions while averagely consulting 4.4 physicians until HAE was correctly diagnosed [27-29]. A study by Magerl et al. [30] shows that up to 80% of misdiagnosed HAE patients also receive a pharmaceutical or interventional mistreatment. Comparable to our findings, other study groups have described a significantly longer diagnostic delay in elder patients [30, 31]. Data from the Icatibant Outcome survey show an average diagnostic delay of 23.9 years in the >65-year-old age-group compared to 4.8 years in the <65-year-old group [31]. Recent data from Germany show an average diagnostic delay of 18.1 years, which increases to 22.9 years in 60–79-year-old patients and to 38.5 years in the ≥80-year-old group [30].\n\nThe potentially fatal course of HAE significantly increases disease-related burden, enhancing fear and anxiety of patients due to their individual health, while also increasing concern for affected family members. In a German study from 2012, HAE-related deaths from 182 families were evaluated, identifying 70 deaths due to a fatal laryngeal swelling. 90% of deceased patients have not received their HAE diagnosis before death and had a significantly reduced lifespan with an average age of 40.6 years at asphyxiation [32].\n\nAltogether, the delay of diagnosis, misdiagnosis, mistreatment, and family burden results in a tremendous impairment of quality of life and can promote psychiatric comorbidities. However, a reduced misdiagnosis and mistreatment in younger patients is suggesting an improvement of diagnostic measures over the last decades.\n\nWith regard to psychiatric comorbidities, our data show a substantial prevalence of depression and anxiety, which is comparable to previously published studies [9-11, 13]. In spite of modern therapeutic options, high rates of anxiety and depression in HAE patients remain a serious comorbidity. Only recently, anxiety and depression were reported to occur in 35.3 and 20.9% of 445 HAE patients from the USA, respectively [20]. In our study, a significantly better control of disease, markedly better quality of life and lower depression and anxiety rates were seen in patients who received long-term prophylactic medication, compared to those who are treated with on-demand treatment only. These results are in accordance with recent data, showing that a better control of HAE attacks goes along with lower anxiety and depression symptoms as well as with improved quality of life outcomes [33-38].\n\nHowever, our subgroup analysis could not detect a significant improvement of anxiety and depression scores when patients were switched on long-term prophylactic treatment. It remains unclear, whether the duration of long-term treatment is essential to improve or maintain mental health, as our patients were taking their prophylactic medication for <1 year. It should be also discussed, whether the lifelong persisting burden of disease, unpredictable breakthrough attacks in spite of prophylactic treatment or even common neurobiological processes are critical features, altogether leading to a substantial prevalence of mental diseases in HAE patients [9, 13, 39-41].\n\nNeuroimmunological animal studies suggest that kinin-receptors can influence depressive behavior in mice [42]. To investigate the role of kinin-receptors, mice with depressive behavior were administered with B1-kinin receptor antagonists, which led to a significant inhibition of depressive behavior. Generally, B1-kinin-receptors are increasingly expressed under pathological conditions such as stress, chronic pain, and inflammation. It can be discussed whether lifelong recurrent HAE, accompanied by psychosocial stress, fear, and physical pain might induce an upregulation of the B1-receptors and, thus, have a neuroimmunological influence on depressive behavior patterns [42].\n\nIn a recently published study by Savarese et al. [43], nearly half of the investigated patients (48%) showed psychopathological discomfort and clinically relevant psychological vulnerability. Also, a lower ability of engagement with their disease was seen in almost one-third (28.6%) of HAE patients, which significantly correlated with the presence of stress. Although reduced emotional regulation enforces the inability to manage one’s health, a better knowledge of disease has a positive impact on a patient’s health engagement, possibly reducing clinically relevant stress. As psychological stress is described as most common trigger factor for HAE attacks, which was also seen in our study group, the authors suggest that psychological and experiential processes of HAE patients might offer a possible therapeutic target for clinical psychologists [41, 43, 44].\n\nWith novel prophylactic treatment options for HAE, disease control and associated mental comorbidities are expected to improve. However, due to high costs, the availability of modern drugs will be likely limited to a selected group of patients worldwide [19, 45-48].\n\nIn conclusion, anxiety was a frequent burden in our study group and was significantly associated with low disease control as measured by AECT. Our data indicate that therapeutic interventions aiming at minimizing number and severity of HAE attacks can significantly improve quality of life and control of disease in HAE patients. It also emphasizes that psychometric tests are valuable tools to measure quality of life, mental health issues, and therapeutic success and should be integrated routinely into the treatment of HAE patients [49].\n\n1.\n\nMagerl M, Brasch J, Förster U, Hauswald B, Mohr B, Präßler J, et al.
