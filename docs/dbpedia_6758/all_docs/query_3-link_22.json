        "text": "Offenbach, 28 April 2023 – According to the provisional figures of the Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD), April 2023 was relatively average in Germany. Compared with long-term averages, the Easter month was somewhat too wet and relatively typical for temperature and sunshine duration. A comparison with the climate archives of the national meteorological service was therefore surprising and DWD press officer Uwe Kirsche revealed: “It is the first time in 15 years that April has been too wet in Germany.” Thanks to the above-average precipitation over the previous months, the vegetation gradually turned a vigorous green. In April, a rare spectacle of colour could be admired in the night sky: in the night of 23/24 April, an intense display of the Northern Lights could be observed as far south as central Germany. This is the summary announced by the DWD after an initial analysis of the observations from its approximately 2,000 measuring stations.\n\nMild temperatures in the north, but not high enough to produce the first summer day of the year\n\nThe average temperature of 7.5 degrees Celsius (°C) in April 2023 was almost the same as the figure of 7.4 °C for the international reference period 1961–1990. Compared to the current, warmer 1991–2020 period, the deviation was minus 1.5 degrees. During the second spring month, the temperature curve fluctuated frequently. The first and last week of April were dominated at times by cool phases, with icy nights at the start of the month. On 5 April, Carlsfeld in the Ore Mountains recorded the lowest temperature nationwide of -8.8 °C. The days between 21 and 23 April brought a warm spell for a change. Nienburg in Lower Saxony and Jena in Thuringia registered the highest temperature on 22 April, with each location recording 24.6 °C. Thus this was the first April in Germany since 2008 without one single summer day with a temperature of over 25 °C.\n\nWet in the south, sometimes with severe thunderstorms – very dry towards the Baltic Sea\n\nAccording to the DWD's provisional calculations, a minimum of 64 litres per square metre (l/m²) fell in April. This would be a good 10 per cent more precipitation than in the reference period 1961–1990 (58 l/m²). Compared to 1991–2020 (45 l/m²), precipitation in April 2023 was as much as 40 per cent higher. Precipitation was plentiful at the start and in the middle of the month. In the southern half of the country, the stations recorded precipitation at least every second day in April. On the evening of 23 April, Bavaria experienced some intense thunderstorms with a great deal of lightning. The highest monthly amounts (> 200 l/m²) were recorded in the Alps whereas the Baltic Sea area was very dry with some places recording less than 20 l/m². Seen overall, the DWD noticed a further improvement in soil moisture nationwide. When compared to the average for the period 1991–2020, it was around average for the season in parts of the uplands and from the Baltic Sea down to the central northern part of the country until 24 April; otherwise the conditions were above-normal in many areas.\n\nSunny near the coast, cloudier in the eastern low mountain ranges and in the Alps\n\nAt around 150 hours, the sunshine in April was only slightly below the average figure of 154 hours for the period 1961–1990. Compared to 1991–2020 (183 hours), there was a pronounced deficit of one sixth. The coastal area recorded over 200 hours of sunshine. In the eastern low mountains and in the Alps, the typical duration was halved.\n\nAll the monthly values stated in this press release are provisional figures. The data used for the last three days of the month are based on forecasts. Some of the measurements from DWD's network of stations were not yet available at the time of publication."
