        "text": "The average worldwide temperature on July 3 reached 17.01°C, breaking the previous record of 16.92°C, set in August 2016.\n\nMonday's temperature was about 0.8°C hotter than the average for the time of year during the late 20th century — a time when global temperatures had already been warmed by human activities.\n\nAccording to Robert Rohde, lead scientist at Berkeley Earth, a US non-profit climate research organisation, the record global temperature is a result of climate change, caused by burning fossil fuels and other human activities, combined with the emerging El Niño weather pattern.\n\nOther scientists have also confirmed this observation. Rohde predicts that the record may be broken again over the coming weeks.\n\nRecent IPCC reports (A.2.2) show that global temperatures have not been as high as they are now for 1,25,000 years.\n\nSweltering heat around the globe\n\nThe consequences of record warming have been reflected in recent developments around the world.\n\nOn July 3, Texas and large parts of the southern US were hit by very high temperatures linked with a heat dome. Analysis by Climate Central found that such temperatures were made at least five times more likely due to human-induced climate change.\n\nWildfires in Canada continued to burn, having already become the worst in Canadian history, with more than 8.4 million hectares burned — an area larger than the UAE, the host of this year's climate conference. The wildfire smoke affected the air quality in large parts of the country and the US.\n\nIn fact, On Sunday, China announced that the first half of 2023 had seen a new record of days with temperatures over 35°C, the highest since 1961 when record-keeping first began in the country.\n\nTemperatures in North Africa have also approached 50°C, as a sweltering heatwave continued to lash the region. Again, climate change is the major culprit here.\n\nBut that's not all. Ocean temperatures around the British Isles and the Nordic countries have continued to be high, although slightly cooler than in previous weeks when an extreme marine heatwave had threatened marine life.\n\nEven the Antarctic region experienced very high temperatures, with many stations registering positive temperatures despite the winter season. The Vernadsky station broke its July temperature record with a reading of 8.7°C.\n\n\"This is not a milestone we should be celebrating, it's a death sentence for people and ecosystems. And worryingly, it won't be the hottest day for a long time. With El Niño developing, the world will likely break this record again in the coming months. We need to stop burning fossil fuels,\" said Friederike Otto, Senior Lecturer in Climate Science at the Grantham Institute for Climate Change and the Environment.\n\n\"Chances are that July will be the warmest ever, and with it the hottest month ever: 'ever' meaning since the Eemian which is some 1,20,000 years ago. While Southern Hemisphere temperatures will drop a bit in the next few days, chances are that July and August will see even warmer days yet given that El Niño is now pretty much in full swing, emphasised Karsten Haustein from the University of Leipzig, adding that, \"In terms of absolute positive anomaly, it's not the warmest deviation ever — that usually comes in the Northern Hemisphere winter, during which earth is four degrees colder.\"\n\nSaleemul Huq, the Director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD), Independent University, Bangladesh, cautioned that loss and damage from human-induced climate change have arrived throughout the world with the hottest day ever and predicted many more hottest days in future.\n\n**\n\nThe above article has been published from a wire source with minimal modifications to the headline and text."
