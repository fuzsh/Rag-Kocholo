        "text": "The climate of Germany\n\nAccording to the Köppen climate classification Germany has a moderate maritime climate (type Cfb) with mild winters, no extremely hot summers and precipitation all year round. However, because of several mountainous and hilly regions there are quite a lot of differences in weather. Within a radius of 100 kilometers large differences in temperatures and weather may occur, especially when there is no higher situated zone in between. It is not guaranteed that the southern part of Germany is warmer than other parts. Long term average temperatures show that the northwestern part of Germany is indeed cooler during the summer. However, during the winter this is the other way round. Because most cold air is supplied from the north and east and the northwest and west are positively influenced by the North Sea; the further you move from west to east the colder it gets. This mainly applies to higher situated regions such as the Thuringian forest, the Bavarian Forest, the Black Forest, Sauerland and the Bavarian Alps.\n\nClimate information of places and areas in Germany\n\nThe climate information given on this page is only brief. Specific information on weather and climate can be found on the pages per region or city. The following climate information is available for Germany:\n\nAachen\n\nAugsburg\n\nBad Bentheim\n\nBavaria\n\nBerlin\n\nBlack Forest\n\nBonn\n\nBottrop\n\nBremen\n\nCochem\n\nCologne\n\nDortmund\n\nDresden\n\nDuisburg\n\nDüsseldorf\n\nEast Frisian Islands\n\nEdiger-Eller\n\nEifel Erfurt\n\nFranfurt am Main\n\nFreibrug im Breigau\n\nGarmisch-Partenkirchen\n\nGelsenkirchen\n\nHalle\n\nHallenberg\n\nHamburg\n\nHannover\n\nHarz\n\nHarz Mountains\n\nHeidelberg\n\nHesse\n\nJutland\n\nKarlsrühe\n\nKassel\n\nKiel\n\nKoblenz Lake Constance\n\nLeipzig\n\nLübeck\n\nMagdeburg\n\nMainz\n\nMannheim\n\nMedebach\n\nMonschau\n\nMosel\n\nMüllheim an der Ruhr\n\nMunich\n\nMünster\n\nNuremberg\n\nOberhausen\n\nOsnabruck\n\nPassau\n\nPotsdam\n\nRegensburg Rostock\n\nRothenburg ob der Tauber\n\nSaarbrücken\n\nSaarburg\n\nSaarland\n\nSauerland\n\nSchwerin\n\nStuttgart\n\nThuringian Forest\n\nTrier\n\nTübingen\n\nWiesbaden\n\nWillingen\n\nWinterberg\n\nWuppertal\n\nWürzburg\n\nUnpredictable spring\n\nBecause the climate in Germany is not as strongly influenced by the North Sea as the climate in the Netherlands and the number of factors that influence the weather is larger, spring is unpredictable. During spring there may be large differences in weather throughout the country as well. A difference of 20 degrees within 24 hours is not uncommon. In general, the first springlike days can be recorded in March. However, spring really starts in April and in some cases May. A period with warm weather can also be followed up by a cold period. In most regions spring is the driest season. During the course of spring chances of precipitation especially increase in the south (Bavaria) and in Central Germany (Sauerland).\n\nWarm summers\n\nOn average summers are slightly warmer in Germany than in the Netherlands as well as chances of tropical weather and heat waves. However, summers may also be bleak with fairly high precipitation figures, grey weather and fairly low temperatures. If you plan to spend your summer in Germany you should bear this in mind. It may also be sunny for a few weeks with summer or even tropical temperatures. This mainly occurs when a high pressure area lies over Germany or slightly north from Germany. When this occurs depressions have no chance and mainly warm air is supplied from the east. In Germany there is no risk of hurricanes, cyclones or other extreme weather conditions. However, heavy rain and or thunderstorms are not uncommon. These phenomena may especially occur after a period with very warm and muggy weather.\n\nPrecipitation\n\nMost precipitation can be recorded during the summer. During the winter precipitation may fall in the form of snow, especially in regions located above 500 meters. Rain may fall in the form of showers. However, longer periods with rainfall may occur as well. Germany gets 400-2,400 millimeters of annual precipitation, the average is about 800-900 millimeters. The wettest regions are Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria. Baldeschwang weather station records the highest annual precipitation: 2,450 millimeters. The driest regions in Germany are Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Brandenburg. Atzendorf weather station (Marbeschacht) is the driest spot in Germany with only 399.2 millimeters of annual precipitation on average.\n\nWinter sports in Germany\n\nDuring the winter there are several places in Germany where you can go on winter sports. Because the mountains here are not as high as in Austria and Switzerland snow is not always guaranteed, with the exception of the most southern part of Bavaria where the Alps are situated and the mountains have altitudes up to 3,000 meters. A famous winter sports region here is Garmisch-Partenkirchen which is located near Switzerland. Here an annual ski jumping contest is held on new years day, which is watched on television by millions of people. Lower situated winter sports regions can be found in Sauerland where the most popular cities are Winterberg and Willingen. Wintry conditions may also cause a lot of traffic congestion. Every year many traffic accidents occur caused by snowfall and glazed frost. This is also why special winter tires are obliged during wintry conditions. These tires provide better grip and a much shorter braking distance than normal or so called all season tires.\n\nClimate figures\n\nThe figures below are based on long term weather and climate data and can be seen as an average for Germany. The regions of Baden-Wurttemberg and Bavaria are much wetter, former East Germany is drier. During the winter it is colder in the higher situated areas. The temperature of the sea is an average for the North Sea and the coast of the Baltic Sea.\n\naverage\n\nmaximum\n\ntemperature (°C)\n\naverage\n\nminimum\n\ntemperature (°C) average\n\nhours of sunshine\n\nper day average days with precipitation\n\nper month average\n\nmm precipitation\n\nper month average\n\nsea\n\ntemperature (°C) January 2 -4 2 16 3 February 4 -2 3 13 2 March 8 0 4 15 3 April 13 4 5 15 5 May 19 8 7 17 10 June 22 11 7 15 15 July 23 12 8 14 17 August 23 13 7 14 18 September 20 10 5 13 16 October 14 6 4 13 13 November 7 1 2 15 9 December 3 -3 1 16 5 = 0-5 mm ● = 6-30 mm ● = 31-60 mm ● = 61-100 mm ● = 101-200 mm ● = over 200 mm\n\n= 0-2 inches ● = 2-12 inches ● = 12-24 inches ● = 25-40 inches ● = 41-80 inches ● = over 80 inches\n\nMore climate information\n\nClimate tables are useful but they dont give an overall picture of the climate and possible weather conditions during a period of time. How high the chances are of hot or cold weather or hurricanes can often not be found in these tables. This is why we offer extra climate information per month. The figures below apply to the largest part of Germany. Chances of wintry weather are higher in the higher situated regions (300-400 meters). Chances of long lasting precipitation are highest in the southern part of Germany. UV-index figures may be lower in the north and higher in the south. Chances of (very) warm weather are highest in Central Germany.\n\nchance of\n\n(very) hotweather\n\nchance of\n\n(very) cool\n\nweather chance of\n\nlong-termprecipitation chance of\n\nhurricanes\n\n(cyclones) chance of\n\nsunny days\n\nUV-index\n\nJanuary February March April May June July August September October November December click here for the explanation of the symbols"
