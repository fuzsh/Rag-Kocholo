        "text": "Leipzig is a gem of a city that never fails to engage me. This underrated European city should be on your “next trip” bucket list for various reasons. One interest commonly shared amongst the travel community is to experience a destination from a local point of view. This allows you to connect intimately with the destination, and you’ll get to see the true character of a place. Leipzig can offer you many opportunities to do that. Here are 10 Leipzig activities to make you feel like a true local.\n\nPlease Note: Ok, you caught me here! I’m a former local and resident of Leipzig. My four years living there were an impactful part of my life. Ever since I moved away, I have visited frequently and keep discovering new sides on every visit. Therefore, my post is a light-hearted reflection based on my experiences.\n\nLet me show you around my city, shall we?\n\nLeipzig Vibe & Character\n\nCultural prosperous merchant city that scores with a huge range of activities\n\nHigh quality of life with relatively low costs of living\n\nThe biggest industries are: automobile (e.g. BMW, Porsche), education (e.g. the university), trade (e.g. the fair, business events), logistics (e.g. Amazon)\n\nNo “rise & grind” mentality as in Frankfurt, Stuttgart or Munich\n\nLeipzig lifestyle is laid-back, family-orientated, eco-friendly and predominately outdoors\n\nGermany’s youngest city, average age 42, open-minded, educated (1/3 of the population has a degree) and modern\n\nEntrepreneurial and forward-thinking. 200-250 start-ups, 20 co-working spaces\n\nExplore Leipzig Activities Like a True Local\n\nI’ve compiled a list of Leipzig activities that would be on a regular list of a local and that I enjoyed when I lived in this beautiful city.\n\nAll Locals cycle in Leipzig\n\nWhen you get to Leipzig, the first thing you should do is organise a bike.\n\nEveryone has it, and everyone does it. Cycling is a big part of everyday life. It’s not just practical and keeps us fit, it is also for leisure and an eco-friendly way of getting around town. Plus, it’s the fastest way to move. Sure, we could take the tram, but a true local is independent and constantly on the go. You cycle everywhere in any weather. It’s an unwritten law. Bring rain trousers along just in case.\n\nCheck with your hotel if they offer a bike rental for a small cost (e.g. Meininger or Capri). Renting a bike should cost around 15€ per day. Alternatively, you can use the bike-sharing network Nextbike.\n\nLeipzig is cycling-friendly and has lanes in and around town. An extensive network of local and long-distance bike tours leads through the nature reserve or along the artificial lakesides in the city’s south.\n\nHere’s a map of cycling tours in Leipzig and surroundings (in German).\n\nREAD MORE: Cycle along the ecumenical pilgrimage way which is a connection to the Camino.\n\nLocals enjoy Leipzig’s Parks & Nature\n\nA massive nature reserve cuts through the city in a north-to-south divide. You can cycle through the city without ever seeing a single house or street and you’ll only be surrounded by its alluvial forest.\n\nThe northern part consists of the Elsterbecken and Luppe river. This area connects to the Rosenthal & Palmengarten, which merge seamlessly with the Johanna and Clara Zetkin Park. Further south is the Elster-Pleisse alluvial forest and the wildlife zoo before reaching Cospudner and Markkleeberger See.\n\nThe alluvial forests are species-rich and a beloved area for weekend activities. You’ll always see dog walkers in Rosenthal or along the Elsterbecken. People cycle or skate here, too. The inner-city parks such as Clara-Zetkin or Johanna Park offer BBQ areas, cafés, a mini golf course and a couple of jetties for renting kayaks.\n\nA personal favourite is the Rosenthal, which has an insane foliage in the autumn. The deciduous forest enchants in the most beautiful colours and the falling leaves apply a magical atmosphere. Enjoy some stellar views over the Rosenthal from the viewing platform “The Wobbly Tower”. It is indeed quite wobbly the further you get to the top, but the skyline of Leipzig and the forest are unforgettable.\n\nLeipzig’s green space covers a total area of 126 square metres (42%). You’d think that’s quite a good ratio in the city structure. However, looking at other German cities of similar size, Leipzig scores quite low. Dortmund (71%) & Stuttgart (70%) took the pole position followed closely by Dresden (69%). But to be honest, I think the 26,760 hectares of forest and parks plus 13 (artificial) lakes in and around Leipzig are plenty to keep you active and busy exploring.\n\nYou can find out more in the green spaces in German cities census.\n\nLocals prefer a quiet Sunday\n\nIf you’ve never been to Germany, don’t be shocked if you come here on a Sunday. Sundays are very quiet and boring in Germany. Mainly because this day is heavily considered a rest day. So, of course, everything is closed and only a handful of shops are open. If they’re open, it’ll be for brunch for a couple of hours in the morning.\n\nIf you happen to stay on a Sunday, do it as the locals do. Grab your bike and explore. Do brunch, or simply relax at home. There will be a moment when you need some groceries or crave snacks. In that case, your only option is Rewe supermarket on the ground floor at the central station.\n\nA trip to Leipzig’s Central Station is always impressive. Not only is this station Europe’s biggest train station, but the historic building has also been used in various films. The one-way station transfers about 120,000 passengers per day since its opening in 1915. Originally it was a reconciliation present between Prussia and Saxony after years of wars and unrest. Today, the station remembers this connection by the west side representing Prussia whilst the east side stands for Saxony. It is always worth a visit, but Sunday visits hit differently.\n\nBrunching is a local sport\n\nBrunch is a huge thing in Leipzig. Eggs, rolls, meat platter and topped sandwiches were standard for many years but the culture is changing. The demand for and popularity of pancakes, granola bowls and healthy birchers is growing. Top addresses for brunch in Leipzig are in Gottschedstraße (Central West), Karl-Liebknecht Straße (Südvorstadt) and for inner-city dwellers the newly opened “Endless”.\n\nEndless takes the London brunch culture as a model. The operators were inspired by the all-day brunch concept and introduced the quirky lifestyle trend to Leipzig. The menu includes sweet pancakes but also avo on toast. As a guest, you dine in a hip location, fully committed to the picture perfect Instagram style.\n\nAnother place I can highly recommend for brunch is Franz Morish. The coffee roastery is a short walk from the city centre.\n\nI like coming here for the relaxed atmosphere and great food. The Morish is a coffee roastery that serves healthy dishes and snacks. They have all-time classics such as sourdough bread with toppings, porridge or freshly made gnocchi. The coffee is always fresh and tasty, plus they offer a variety of coffee beans from across the world. They roast them onsite, too. The Morish is also spacious and caters to young professionals who want to eat well and spend a few hours working in a nice café. All dishes are under 12€ and a cappuccino sits around the 3.50€ mark.\n\nKayaking on Karl-Heine Canal is very Leipzig-esque\n\nAnother top Leipzig activity is spending time on the water. With more than 200km of waterways there is lots to explore and see. Fun Fact: the living spaces near the water are regarded as the priciest in Leipzig.\n\nKayaking is a popular Sunday afternoon activity. I’m not the biggest fan but Leipziger love this water sport. It is very easy to rent a kayak and explore the many artificial canals and waterways safely. The main jetties are in the western boroughs of Lindenau and Plagwitz. Several services rent out equipment but you have to book in advance to avoid disappointment. Especially in the summer the waterways get busy with kayaking explorers.\n\nLeipziger cherish Coffee Culture\n\nLeipzig doesn’t produce its own coffee like Hamburg, but locals have been big coffee drinkers since 1694. There are several Viennese-style coffee houses in Leipzig, preserved and looked after. After all, Leipzig is Germany’s only city with original coffee houses.\n\nThe oldest coffee houses are the Riquet Café & the Kaffee Baum. Café Kandler and Bach Stubl also have tea rooms, but their specialty is Leipzig dessert inventions. Learn more on my self-guided walking tour on how coffee came to Leipzig, where you can still find the Viennese style cafés and indulge in typical afternoon treats.\n\nLEARN MORE: Leipzig Coffee Culture and self-guided walking tour.\n\nOf course, there are also modern cafés and roasters. Often located in neighbouring districts, these are run by enterprising locals who travelled the world and brought speciality coffee back to Leipzig. Good examples are the BrühBAR, the Elstermühle, Franz Morish or the Mono Loco coffee bar.\n\nDid you know: People from Leipzig are sometimes called “Coffee Saxons”. This slightly derogatory but teasing name dates back to the Seven Years’ War (1756-63). When Prussia occupied Leipzig, the Saxon troops were forced to serve Prussia. In true Saxon fashion, they refused, claiming, “We can’t fight without coffee.” So the Prussians coined the derogatory term “Coffee Saxons,” which survived to this day.\n\nLocals are obsessed with the outdoors\n\nCycling, kayaking, relaxing in the park, flanering, brunching in the sun… these are just some Leipzig activities enjoyed by the locals. They lead an active and outdoor lifestyle – especially during the summer – and are obsessed with water sports, too.\n\nJust outside of Leipzig you will find a very well developed lake landscape. This can be easily reached by bike in just 20 minutes. The two lakes most frequently visited by Leipzig residents are the Cospudener See and the Markkleeberger See in the south.\n\nThe greater Leipzig area used to be a rich coal region. Mining was the main industry in the 1980s and widespread in East Germany. Since the late 1990s, these mining holes have been flooded to create artificial lakes. Today they serve as holiday destinations and offer relaxation to the locals.\n\nOf the two main lakes, Markkleeberg is my personal favourite. There is more to do here and the lake is much cleaner and has a tidy and well maintained layout. It’s also less overrun by students. Markkleeberg has some cool local activities like a treetop adventure park, SUP and a white water rafting course. The course was built for the 2012 Olympics, but Leipzig missed out on this to London. Bugger!\n\nToday, visitors can complete an adventurous 2-hour rafting course or learn to surf. Afterwards, the terrace and the café invite you to drinks, coffee and the view over the lake.\n\nAnd what do you do in the winter? Well, Leipzig gets a good amount of snow, so grab your snowboard and let’s just roll 🙂\n\nFlanering in Leipzig is Très Chic\n\nFlanering in Leipzig central is just as popular as brunching and dwelling in the cultural vibes. After all, Leipzig has a long history as a prosperous merchant city and intellectual centre. “See and be seen” is a thing, so have fun dressing up in your nicest summer dress and enjoy the lively atmosphere.\n\nDid you know that Leipzig is often referred to as a “mini Paris”? I can see some grounds for comparison here, as some historic parts of town have resemblance to the Parisian chic. The Parisian flair is captured well in the features of the Riquet coffee house, which was also build by a French expat. Other examples are the merchant passage Speck’s Hof and the grand arcade Mädler Passage. Personally I feel Leipzig has more in common with Vienna.\n\nThere is always something going on. Art and culture are at every corner. In the centre you’ll find many offerings such as museums and events on the market square. The Bach Festival, City Fair or Wine Tasting during the summer months are super popular outings for locals. It is very common to hear street performers entertaining pedestrians with classical music. Of course Bach is a given, but Mozart and Beethoven are occasionally played, too.\n\nGood to Know: Leipzig locals avoid Barefeet Alley (Barfußgässchen) like the plague. This is a narrow alleyway seamed with typical tourist eateries serving mostly German cuisine.\n\nKeep in touch with Your International Friends\n\nLeipzig is a very open and friendly city. In any case, everyone knows someone or is friends with someone who is not of German descent. Approximately 20% of the 600,000 inhabitants are Internationals.\n\nWhen I still lived in Leipzig, I was connected to the Anglophone community.\n\nThe Anglophone Community is represented here mainly because of the American consulate in the Music Quarter. Noel’s Ballroom, an original Irish Pub on Karl-Liebknecht, is a favourite address for pub quizzers. There used to be an English shop selling UK products in Gottsched Straße, but unfortunately it didn’t survive the pandemic and Brexit. And of course, Leipzig has the underrated charm of a world city, so in the past decade or so it has attracted international entrepreneurs, digital nomads and remote workers.\n\nIf you would like to find out more about the Anglophone Community in Leipzig, I can highly recommend the anthropology “Englisches Leipzig”. This was a project by my English Department and compiles stories from Anglophone expats in Leipzig, connections to the UK and the US as well as portraits and interesting experience reports.\n\nGood To Know: Leipzig has a mild Saxonian accent but is sometimes even hard to understand for Germans. The Leipzig name in the local tongue is pronounced – Laib * sch with a strong focus on the diphthong sound (-ai) and long hissing finish (-sch).\n\nLeipziger love a good Market\n\nFlea Market: Leipzig’s night flea market was one of my favourite Leipzig activities as a local. One of Germany’s oldest markets, it celebrated its 28th birthday this year. It was also voted amongst the top 10 markets by various national lifestyle magazines. Over 200 traders set up their stalls and sell all sorts of retro and vintage things, the rummaging will literally take all night. The market used to be at Kohlrabi Circus, a former fresh market hall and ice rink, but has now moved to the AGRA site.\n\nChristmas Markets: Last but not least, the legendary Christmas markets are worth mentioning here. During my time, I experienced 5 wonderful Decembers in Leipzig. The festive huts concentrated on the historic market square outside the famous town hall surrounded by frost or snow covered roofs are a festive highlight. The huts spread further along the Grimmaische Straße towards Augustusplatz, where the markets climax in a fun fair with Ferris wheel, dodgems and rides. Opening at the first advent weekend the markets will go strong all month long. Of course, the inner city will be even more packed and as a local you’ll hate having to squeeze through the masses. But then you could pick up Dresdner Handbread, Langos, cotton candy or hot apple punch which will make any trip into central Leipzig totally worth it.\n\nThe markets always have the same structure so you never miss your favourite stall. My personal one is Christel’s Langos stand outside Mexx (Petersstraße) and there’s only one sweet stall that serves freshly made cotton candy (nestled inside the main market at the old town hall).\n\nMore Leipzig Activities like a Local\n\nHere are some more local Leipzig activities that may be of interest to you. These aren’t necessarily things I did/do when I lived in Leipzig, but I’ve consulted some of my former co-students and colleagues. Here is what they contributed:\n\nBar Hopping: Leipzig has a huge alternative and lively student scene. Main places are the pub mile on Karl-Liebknecht Straße, Moritzbastei or the neighbourhoods of Plagwitz & Connewitz.\n\nAbandoned Places: Plagwitz is rich with abandoned factories and former industrial ruins. A perfect playground if you enjoy street art, graffiti and near forgotten places with character.\n\nCreative Centres: Lindenau is home to the Baumwollspinnerei and Kunstkraftwerk – two alternative art galleries with a local and international focus. Kunstkraftwerk has mostly shown 3D mapping shows in the past few years, e.g. Van Gogh.\n\nFootball Game: Leipzig’s home team is RB Leipzig, sponsored by Red Bull. Their stadium, the Red Bull Arena, was just around the corner from my former flat and I’ve seen a few games with my co-students. The club, now in 1. Bundesliga, is a huge deal for Leipzig and has put national focus on the city when the team plays. Tickets (when bought at the merch shop in town) include free public transport and come with a Red Bull drink.\n\nMaking of “Leipzig Activities Like A Local”\n\nHere are some insights into my work and research when I compiled this post:\n\nSelected experiences which I regularly engage(d) with when in Leipzig\n\nConsulted former colleagues and co-students to get more input for a dimensional post\n\nResearched additional facts to back up some of the activities and why they are popular amongst Leipzig locals\n\nConsulted the city statistics office for current figures and demographic stats\n\nResearched additional material for your consideration when embarking on these activities\n\nSpent years and hours of my life experiencing these Leipzig activities over and over again to make sure I can make informed recommendations & report back on consistency\n\nFAQs about Leipzig Activities\n\nI understand this is quite a lengthy post and you may have some quick questions about the 10 local Leipzig activities. You can, of course, always come back to any section of my post and read in more detail what you’d need for your blog. If you have questions or need help, please get in touch and I’m happy to assist.\n\nHow Many Days Do You Need In Leipzig?\n\nLeipzig on a first visit can be seen within 3 to 4 days. However, depending on what you’re after you can easily spend an entire week here without getting bored. There are so many Leipzig activities to keep you busy for days, especially if you’re an outdoor person like me.\n\nIs Leipzig Safe For Foreigners & solo travel friendly?\n\nLeipzig is very safe for foreigners as well as for solo female travellers. The city has a diverse population and many immigrants live here. The Internationals who settled in Leipzig are from all over the world, including Italians, Asians and there’s an easy-going Anglophone community. Leipziger are friendly and open-minded people, which is due to the city’s dynamic history. The city also attracts many foreign entrepreneurs and digital nomads.\n\nThank you so much for reading.
