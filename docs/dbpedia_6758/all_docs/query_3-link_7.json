The warmest years on record in Germany were 2018 and 2022.\n\nTemperature extremes by state\n\n[edit]\n\nState Extreme Maximum Extreme Minimum Extreme By Both Temperature Location Date Temperature Location Date Extremeness Baden-Württemberg 40.3 °C (104.5 °F) Bad Mergentheim[1] July 20, 2022 −36.1 °C (−33.0 °F) Doline Degerfeld, Albstadt[2] March 1, 2005 76.4 / 137.5 Bavaria 40.3 °C (104.5 °F) Kitzingen[3] August 7, 2015 −45.9 °C (−50.6 °F) Funtensee[4][5] December 24, 2001 86.2 / 155.1 Berlin 38.9 °C (102.0 °F) Kaniswall, District of Treptow-Köpenick[6] August 7, 2015 −31.9 °C (−25.4 °F) Blankenburg, District of Pankow[7] January 19, 1893 70.8 / 127.4 Brandenburg 39.2 °C (102.6 °F) Lübben-Blumenfelde[8] and Cottbus[9] August 9, 1992 and June 19, 2022 −32.1 °C (−25.8 °F) Heinersdorf, Großbeeren[10] January 19, 1893 71.3 / 128.4 Bremen 37.6 °C (99.7 °F) Bremen Airport[11] August 9, 1992 −23.6 °C (−10.5 °F) Bremen Airport[12] February 13, 1940 61.2 / 110.2 Hamburg 40.1 °C (104.2 °F) Neuwiedenthal, District of Neugraben-Fischbek[13][14] July 20, 2022 −29.1 °C (−20.4 °F) Fuhlsbüttel Airport[15] February 13, 1940 69.2 / 124.6 Hesse 40.2 °C (104.4 °F) Westend, Frankfurt am Main[16] July 25, 2019 −33.8 °C (−28.8 °F) Lahntal, Gießen[17] January 22, 1850 74.0 / 133.2 Lower Saxony 40.0 °C (104.0 °F) Hohenbostel (Barsinghausen)[18] July 20, 2022 −28.5 °C (−19.3 °F) Ricklingen, Hanover[19] January 27, 1942 68.5 / 123.3 Mecklenburg-Vorpommern 39.4 °C (102.9 °F) Boizenburg/Elbe[20] July 20, 2022 −32.5 °C (−26.5 °F) Ueckermünde[21] February 11, 1929 71.9 / 129.4 North Rhine-Westphalia 41.2 °C (106.2 °F) Duisburg (Baerl) & Tönisvorst[22] July 25, 2019 −31.2 °C (−24.2 °F) Eslohe[19][23] January 27, 1942 72.4 / 130.4 Rhineland-Palatinate 40.4 °C (104.7 °F) Andernach & Bad Neuenahr-Ahrweiler[24] July 25, 2019 −27.5 °C (−17.5 °F) Birkenfeld[7] January 29, 1895 67.9 / 122.2 Saarland 40.3 °C (104.5 °F) Nennig, Perl[25] August 8, 2003 −24.2 °C (−11.6 °F) Osterhof, Sankt Wendel[26] January 13, 1968 64.5 / 116.1 Saxony 39.8 °C (103.6 °F) Hosterwitz, Dresden[27] August 20, 2012 −34.1 °C (−29.4 °F) Bad Elster[28] February 12, 1871 73.9 / 133.0 Saxony-Anhalt 40.0 °C (104.0 °F) Pabstorf (Huy)[29] July 20, 2022 −30.6 °C (−23.1 °F) Krüssau, Möckern[7] February 12, 1929 70.6 / 127.1 Schleswig-Holstein 39.1 °C (102.4 °F) Grambek[30] near Mölln July 20, 2022 −30.9 °C (−23.6 °F) Heide (Holstein)[31][32] February 13, 1940 70.0 / 126.0 Thuringia 39.1 °C (102.4 °F) Jena, Astronomical Observatory[33] July 20, 2022 −33.5 °C (−28.3 °F) Gotha[34] February 11, 1929 72.6 / 130.7\n\nImportant: In some federal states, even more extreme values are known to be measured on same or earlier dates. These dubious or unreliable values are not listed in this table unless they passed a basic temporal and spatial consistency & plausibility check (e. g. less than 0.9 °C / 1.6 °F above surrounding stations in German lowlands). For this reason, the former German record of 42.6 °C / 108.7 °F measured on July 25, 2019 at Lingen (Lower Saxony) is not listed. It was cancelled in December 2020 by the responsible station operator DWD (German weather service).[35]\n\nIn some cases, also stations from other operators of meteorological networks were listed if their values met the above stated requirements and could be classified as representative for a larger area.\n\nNotes\n\n[edit]"
