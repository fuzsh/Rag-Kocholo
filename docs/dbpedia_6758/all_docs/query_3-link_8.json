        "text": "Germany is located in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere and a general description of the climate isn’t really possible due to its geographical location.\n\nIn general, the German climate is mixed and offers frosty and harsh winters to occasional midsummer days of all kinds. It is cold, wet with a few nice summer months.\n\nThe northwest is often covered by Atlantic influences with rain and only moderately warm summers. In autumn, there are occasional severe storms. The further south or east you go, the warmer the summers and the more frequent the weather extremes. At the same time, the southern Alps can be felt letting warm Mediterranean air through in places, while also blocking lower-lying bad weather fronts from the south.\n\nBest travel times in Germany\n\nThe travel times vary depending on the region. The areas on the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts are more suitable during the period from May to September due to the warmer temperatures. During the summer months, temperatures between 21 and 28 degrees Celsius prevail here. You can enjoy a beach holiday here in the warm season. The water temperature is rarely above 21°C.\n\nPlaces close to the German Baltic Sea coast have a much more continental climate, as the Baltic Sea, as a closed water body, can barely discharge cold temperatures. This also leads to slightly shorter summers with milder temperatures.\n\nIn the mountain regions, the temperatures are somewhat more moderate even in midsummer and therefore invite hikes and other outdoor activities without too much stress. The German Alps in particular are known in the south of the country for their winter sports opportunities from December to February. Due to the different altitudes, the climate there can be much more variable than in the north. In the isolated valleys, there is less precipitation and up to 1°C higher temperatures. The alpine winter sports areas are relatively snow-sure in February. Only in March does the snow line rise again to 2,000 metres. From June it is at over 3,000 metres.\n\nHours of sunshine per day\n\nRain days per month\n\nPrecipitation in mm/day\n\nWater temperature\n\nRelative humidity in %\n\nAbsolute humidity in g/m³\n\nTemperature records of the last 133 years\n\nThe hottest temperature measured from 1891 to February 2024 was reported by the Lingen weather station. In July 2019, the record temperature of 42.6 °C was reported here. The hottest meteorological summer from June to August, based on all 198 weather stations in Germany below 1,840 meters altitude, was recorded in 2018 with an average temperature of 18.3 °C. This average temperature will normally be measured every four to six hours, thus also including the nights. Normally, this value is 16.7 degrees Celsius. The average maximum daily temperature at that time was 24.4 °C.\n\nThe coldest day in these 133 years was reported by the Oberstdorf weather station. Here the temperature dropped to -29.4 °C in February 2012. Oberstdorf lies at an altitude of 807 meters above sea level. The coldest winter (December to February) was in 1963 with an average temperature of -3.5 °C. In Germany, it is usual to have about 5.8 degrees more at 2.2 °C for this three-month period.\n\nThe most precipitation fell in August 1996. With 20.3 mm per day, the Würzburg weather station recorded the highest monthly average of the last 133 years. Incidentally, the region with the most rainfall for the whole year is around Brocken. The driest region is near Artern.\n\nRecord months last year\n\nWe compared the record values of the past months with those of the same months in previous years. We used the same criteria to examine the respective maximum and minimum values in the categories of average temperature, precipitation, hours of sunshine and the maximum and minimum temperatures measured throughout the country. We have listed all measured values that have not been reached in Germany for 10 or more years.\n\nWith 1.75 hours of sunshine per day in February 2024, there was less sunshine than in any February in the last 11 years (1.15 hours in 2013).\n\nWith 3.66 liters of precipitation in 2023, December was the wettest in 12 years (3.83 l/m² in 2011).\n\nWith a total of 16.13 rainy days, it rained more often in December 2023 than it has in the same month for 11 years (16.13 days in 2012).\n\nWith 4.04 liters of precipitation in 2023, November was the wettest in 76 years (5.30 l/m² in 1947).\n\nWith 1.27 hours of sunshine per day in November 2023, there was less sunshine than in any November in the last 13 years (1.16 hours in 2010).\n\nThe lowest temperature of -16.60°C reached in November 2023 was last seen in the same month 13 years ago (-20.10°C in 2010).\n\nWith 3.27 liters of precipitation in 2023, October was the wettest in 21 years (3.51 l/m² in 2002).\n\nThe highest temperature of 29.70°C reached in October 2023 was last seen in the same month 14 years ago (29.80°C in 2009).\n\nWith just 1.02 liters of precipitation in 2023, September was drier than it had been for 26 years (1.00 l/m² in 1997).\n\nWith 3.95 liters of precipitation in 2023, August was the wettest in 13 years (5.19 l/m² in 2010).\n\nWith only 5.51 days of rain, it rained less in May 2023 than it has for 15 years (4.54 days in 2008).\n\nWith 2.09 liters of precipitation in 2023, April was the wettest in 15 years (2.56 l/m² in 2008).\n\nWith a total of 11.21 rainy days, it rained more often in April 2023 than it has in the same month for 15 years (12.86 days in 2008).\n\nWith 2.79 liters of precipitation in 2023, March was the wettest in 22 years (3.12 l/m² in 2001).\n\nWith a total of 14.71 rainy days, it rained more often in March 2023 than it has in the same month for 15 years (15.34 days in 2008).\n\nThe most recent months after February 2024 are not yet available here. We only calculate climatic comparisons after a large number of weather stations on a continent have checked and published their data.\n\nLong-term development of temperatures from 1951 - 2023\n\nIn contrast to single record values, long-term development cannot simply be brought about by all weather stations in the country. Both the number and the locations are constantly changing. An average value would give a distorted result. If several measuring stations in particularly cold mountain or coastal regions are added in one year, the average would decrease as a result of this alone. If a station fails during the summer or winter months, it does not provide any values and distorts the average again. The subsequent long-term development was therefore reduced to only 4 measuring points in order to have comparable data over as long a period as possible.\n\nIn the years 1951 to 2023, there were only these 4 weather stations in the whole country, which reported continuous temperature values (Rostock Warnemünde, Hamburgort, Leipzig-Halleort, Görlitz). From these weather reports, we have created a long-term development that shows the monthly average temperatures. The hottest month in this entire period was July 2006 at 22.7 °C. February 1956 was the coldest month with an average temperature of -10.0 °C.\n\nThe average annual temperature was about 8.5 °C in the years after 1951 and about 10.6 °C in the last years before 2023. So in less than 73 years, it has increased by about 2.2 °C. This trend only applies to the selected 4 weather stations in Germany. A considerably more comprehensive evaluation of global warming has been provided separately.\n\nData basis and methodology\n\nThe data from the individual measuring stations are based on the archives of the German Weather Service, individual values averaged and supplemented by own elements. In order to determine a representative national average, average values were first calculated for each part of the country, which were then summarized at the national level. Thus, if a disproportionate number of weather stations are located in a small area, their number does not affect the national average."
