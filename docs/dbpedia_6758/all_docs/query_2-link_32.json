        "text": "Weather in January\n\nJanuary stands as one of the coldest months in Germany, often rivaled by February in terms of low temperatures. The eastern parts of the country tend to experience colder conditions than the west. Throughout the month, daytime temperatures often hover around the freezing point and can sometimes remain below it. Siberian cold waves occasionally sweep across the country, resulting in temperatures dropping drastically. It's not uncommon for certain areas, especially in valleys such as Bavaria, to see temperatures plummeting to near -20.6°C (-5.1°F). On the higher end, the warmest regions might experience highs just above freezing.\n\nThe country's proximity to the North and Baltic Seas implies that the coastal regions, notably cities like Hamburg and Kiel, have slightly milder conditions, thanks to the maritime influence. In contrast, cities like Berlin in the east are typically colder.\n\nSnowfall is prevalent in January, especially in the highlands and mountains. The Alps, with places like Zugspitze, not only see consistent snowfall but also have the potential for blizzards and avalanches during this period. Comparatively, December might be slightly milder, whereas February often maintains the cold grip established in January, with prolonged cold spells and significant snowfall in mountainous areas.\n\nBerlin - January »\n\nThe month with the most snowfall is January, when snow falls for 9.6 days and typically aggregates up to 44mm (1.73\") of snow.
