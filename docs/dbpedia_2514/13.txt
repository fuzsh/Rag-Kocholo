Yo-kai Watch! Episode 2 Subs Released!

You want to talk about unreasonableness? This is my first episode on this show and I’m already overdue by another episode airing in Japan.

You may have heard me say on Twitter, though I didn’t talk about it much - I’m going to still be subbing the original series while also juggling some episodes of the new Yo-kai Watch Exclamation Point anime! This one’s going to be on priority for a while. Don’t expect me to stay caught up lol.

Yo-kai time! Fukuryuu just means “lucky dragon,” Li-fujin’s pun actually gets explained in the episode (through Translators Notes because Keita’s line forced me to). Additionally, while she doesn’t appear in the episode, “Komami” is a simple mixture of Koma(inu) and Mami, an actual girl name.

The “Oldie Wig Club” segment has a title that’s pronounced “Ossan-dzura-bu,” in a joke where it sounds just like the drama Ossan’s Love (pronounced like “Ossanzu Rabu”). As far as I know that’s where the correlation stops and the entire segment feels so random as if it was only made to justify that pun. Thankfully you might have noticed Wig being a very popular joke where we are in 2019 so at least the segment isn’t ENTIRELY drained of its comedy when that pun gets lost in translation…right?

Until next time!

Edit: I forgot to point something out - a couple of reusable aspects were skipped for the time being due to trying to get this out early. In particular: the logo script in the OP, and a karaoke script for the ED. Those will be present in the next episode!
