        "text": "Kuroi Yokai Watch ~Guided Scum~ Fourth Person: \"Katie\" (Japanese: 黒い妖怪ウォッチ 〜導かれしクズたち〜 四人目『フミ』, Kuroi yōkai u~otchi 〜michibika reshi kuzu-tachi〜 shitori-me “Fumi”), Komasan and Komajiro's Japanese Whole Country Journey: IN Fukuoka (Japanese: コマさんコマじろうの日本全国もんげー旅 IN福岡, Komasan komajirō no nipponzenkoku monge ̄tabi iin Fukuoka) and Yo-kai City Licker (Japanese: 妖怪 自慢ハッタン, Yōkai Jimanhattan) is the 160th episode of the Yo-kai Watch anime series. It was broadcasted in Japan on March 3, 2017.\n\nSummary[]\n\nKuroi Komasan, Kuroi Jibanyan and Kemushi-otoko meet Katie who insults them. Komasan and Komajiro visit Fukuoka and look around at the local culture. After Eddie returns from a big city, he starts taking advantage of the city life, despite only going for a short break while Yo-kai City Licker inspirits him.\n\nPlot[]\n\nCharacters[]\n\nHumans[]\n\nNate\n\nHailey\n\nBear\n\nEddie\n\nKatie/Kuroi World Katie (debut)\n\nNathan Adams (Kuroi World)\n\nPhonius (mentioned, pictured)\n\nManga Artist Girl (flashback)\n\nYo-kai[]\n\nJibanyan\n\nWhisper\n\nKomasan\n\nKomajiro\n\nUsapyon\n\nTomnyan (cameo)\n\nKuroi Jibanyan\n\nKuroi Komasan\n\nKuroi Yo-kai Watch\n\nKemushi-otoko\n\nKuroi Kyubi (debut)\n\nKuroi Ikemenken (debut)\n\nKuroi Jinmenken (debut)\n\nKamakiri On'na (debut)\n\nHinozall Awoken (debut, cameo)\n\nCity Licker (debut)\n\nTomorrow Gal (flashback, silhouette cameo)\n\nKoma Knomads (flashback, silhouette cameo)\n\nT-Wrecks (flashback, silhouette cameo)\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThe box Kuroi Ikemenken gives to Katie has the Yo-Zon branding on it, implying that Yo-Zon either delivers to other dimensions or may be the Kuroi World's counterpart. The Komasan Taxi makes a cameo in the next episode, taking the style of the original anime series, making the latter more of a likely confirmation.\n\nThis is the first and only time that the Kuroi Yo-kai Watch punch other Yo-kai out of the way.\n\nThis is the third time Jibanyan gets an unlucky summon.\n\nIt is revealed that the miniature model of a city, the light bulb on his tail, and the star patterns on City Licker’s body are all detachable.\n\nThe scene where Komasan eats the overly-spicy cod roe is a reference to EP156 where Komasan tries the wasabi ice cream.\n\nThis episode features a cameo at Level-5's offices in Fukuoka. Though it may seem like it's live-action, it's actually redrawn to be in style of the anime series. The layout is also taken exactly from this photo.\n\nHinozall Awoken also appears as a cameo in the television screens after their Komasan and Komajiro take their photo in the building.\n\nThis is the first episode where a Yo-kai other than Snottle attacks Jibanyan when he is summoned to fight.\n\nKomasan is summoned for the first time in 87 episodes, making him the second-longest Yo-kai to not be summoned after a while. The first would be Shogunyan, where he wasn't summoned for 116 episodes.\n\nIn City Licker's backstory flashback, the Koma Knomands can be briefly seen as well as other 'Merican Yo-kai.\n\nErrors[]"
