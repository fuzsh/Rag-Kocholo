        "text": "Hot dang I wish I was there right now\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! (Softsubs (both versions), hardsubs (version 1))\n\nWatch this episode on vimeo (version 1, version 2(full), version 2 (”Yo-kai Gojidatsujii” only)) or dailymotion (version 1, version 2(full), version 2 (”Yo-kai Gojidatsujii” only)!\n\n*Solid Snake voice* Kept you waiting, huh…\n\nSo with this being a much older episode than we’re actually up to, some of the segments that have already ended are back temporarily (unless you’re watching in order in the first place). But more importantly, let me explain the version 1 and version 2 thing:\n\nBecause the Yo-kai of the day (Gojidatsujii) segment is very wordplay-centric, I ran a poll on Twitter asking if viewers wanted a more literal translation of all the wordplay with translator’s notes or if they wanted to see the segment “localized” whenever possible. Ultimately, Noroinohanako and I decided to just do both. Since the wordplay also coincides heavily with the visuals, Noroino generously offered to do all the typesetting for the segment, and it looks really good! Most of the signs/text are completely redone to match the English localization (except for one joke toward the end, which we found pretty impossible to localize while maintaining the same effect). The differences are briefly explained in the subs themselves depending on what version you’re watching, but that’s the gist of it, and why this episode took a lot of extra time. If you’re interested in version 2, I’d recommend running the softsub version on a strong computer. It will definitely lag on older machines.\n\nAnyway, the Yo-kai of the day himself is Gojidatsujii. This pun is quite layered - it comes from goji (誤字), “misprint,” datsuji (脱字), “missing letter,” and jii\n\n(爺), “old man.” From what I can tell, the fact that he’s an apple…wizard…thing doesn’t have anything to do with the name itself. In English, Gojidatsujii became “Mister Typoo.” This is mentioned in the version 2 subs, which I guess is a perk of this coming out so late - this episode’s production actually began months before YW3 was out in PAL regions!\n\nAlso, we technically got a “new” Yo-kai in UZApyon, which is obviously a corruption of USApyon based on the word uzai (ウザイ), slang for “annoying” or “noisy.” I rewrote the joke a bit in the episode itself, but that’s why Dark Komasan says the name is fitting for UZApyon.\n\nKeep in mind if you’ve been waiting to watch in order that some of the episodes that follow this one will be missing certain conventions, like some preview text, the pre-summon neon sign, and the new thing I added this episode, which is captions for certain sound effects (I took a page out of the Shadowside sub book there). Obviously, that’s because this episode simply was finalized later than them, so I was able to add those changes in.\n\n/yokaiwatchoutofcontext\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! (Softsub, hardsub)\n\nWatch this episode on vimeo or dailymotion!\n\nOkay, so I managed to squeeze out at least one episode this month (possibly 2 depending on when 161 gets done…it’ll happen guys I promise). Now don’t get too excited because it’s still not gonna be a regular schedule for now :L (not that I have that many more episodes anyway…)\n\nToday’s new Yo-kai was Kechirashi. This Yo-kai’s name comes from ke (毛), meaning “hair,” and chirashi (散らし), meaning “scattering” (in this context anyway). In the English localization, the name they went with was Shedwin, which I think is kinda cute actually. Not like I can think of a punny name anyways.\n\nAs for some miscellaneous stuff that might’ve flown over your head: toward the end of the Oni Stars segment, Tomnyan says “Call me and I will appear, meow-meow-meow-meow!” This is a reference to an old 60s anime called Hakushon Daimao (meaning “Achoo the Great Demon King,” with the official English version by Saban in 1992 being called “Bob in a Bottle”). In the show, a boy possesses a lamp that summons a genie named Hakushon/Achoo (or Bob) with a sneeze, and when this happens, Hakushon says “Call me and I will appear, ja-ja-ja-jaaan!” This catchprase was localized, but I went with the original because the localized version mentions sneezing and there was no sneezing in the scene in this episode so…yeah. In the Board Meeting segment, Whisper’s segment idea is a parody of a 70s Japanese show called “The Unfettered Shogun” (Abarenbo Shogun) that I don’t exactly know how to explain in brief so here’s it’s Wikipedia page :L Finally, I threw in a couple of references in the Nyanpachi part in the little mini-titles that show up every so often…the one that says “Yo-kai Eleven” was directly translated, but there are two others I put in. No hints this time :P (Don’t worry, they don’t drastically alter the literal meaning too much.)\n\nOh yeah, apparently Shadowside is ending and going back to the old comedy-styled YW in April. Can’t say I expected this to happen so soon, especially because SS is doing well ratings-wise. I’m not particularly thrilled to go back either after the really bad note the original show ended on, but who knows, maybe they’ll go back to doing it right. As I’ve mentioned on Twitter, I will not even think about working on subs for the new show until both the original and SS are completed or at least close to completion, cuz three shows at once is just way too much. Also Noroinohanako is getting back to Shadowside in between other translation projects so please stop directing me your Shadowside questions because I don’t translate those anyway I’m just the QC guy.\n\nUnfortunately, short answer for now is no - unless some things change. If Noroinohanako or anyone else wants to hop back on the project I’d be happy to help out, but I think once I’m done with these last few episodes of the original series I’ll have had enough of (mostly) solo subbing - since I’ll still be a college student I’m not really gonna have the time anymore (I barely do now except for on breaks which is why I haven’t finished still even though I should have, given I’ve been at this for a year and a half). Also, Shadowside is an ongoing show, so unless I‘m splitting the work more, I’d rather not get myself into a project with no foreseeable end (assuming Shadowside doesn’t end in the next few months).\n\nSo yeah, it’s not totally impossible that I’ll end up working on it at some point, but for now I’m not planning on it. I do however plan to be on the team for Forever Friends subs this summer, so look forward to that.\n\n(P.S. - Shadowside subs for episodes 22-24 do exist, but only on KissAnime, which is one of those sites where you have to tread carefully because of malware. I don’t know why there’s no torrent or why it’s only on that one site, but it is what it is.)\n\nThis is called procrastination\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! (Softsubs, hardsubs)\n\nWatch this episode on vimeo or dailymotion!\n\nSo this is a cute episode. The Children’s Day segment is a bit weak until the end but there’s some really good comedic timing in the other ones. Here’s a tough question for you: do you think the Oni Stars get closer to escaping prison than Jinmenken?\n\nBy the way, Children’s Day is celebrated on May 5th as the last holiday of Golden Week. On this day, the Japanese honor and celebrate the innocence and personalities of children. Though it was initially known as just Boys’ Day, it was renamed and designated as a national holiday in 1948. As the episode shows, the most common Children’s Day tradition is flying koinobori (carp flags) - one for each parent and child in the family.\n\nThe only new Yo-kai in this episode was Nyanmajo. Being a “nyan” Yo-kai, there’s…nyan…and majo (魔女), meaning “witch.” Nyanmajo’s segment is basically just a parody of traditional magical girl anime. In the English localization, Nyanmajo was renamed to Maginyan, which is self-explanatory. The localization has switched around the word order in the names of the nyans and komainus quite a few times, probably to keep their names consistent by always putting the “nyan” part at the end and the “koma” part in the front. Her name is apparently the same in the other European languages.\n\nI’m officially back in college again, which means the schedule is once again going to be up in the air for a while. Wish me luck :P\n\nWhat are you talking about, television show? That’s at least once every week for me\n\nGet this episode on nyaa! (Softsub, hardsub)\n\nWatch this episode on vimeo and dailymotion!\n\nThis episode is a Golden Week special! …Whiiiich is something we don’t have here. It’s basically a period between late April and early May when pretty much everyone has off because multiple national holidays fall in that period. It’s about the length of the spring break most schools and colleges get in the US, although Japan has its own spring break a few weeks prior to Golden Week as well. Don’t be jealous, Japanese schools have a lot fewer breaks than people in the West do, and those they do get are generally a little shorter, plus schoolkids still have homework during every break.\n\nThis episode sees the brief return of the Komabros Journey segment, but unlike the last round of trips, the Komabros head outside of Japan to Hawaii, which happens to be an incredibly popular tourist destination for Japanese and even has a large Japanese population living there. I’ll be going over the cultural context as usual, though of course, “Hawaiian culture” as it’s presented in media and popular culture these days is the result of decades of the colonizing and commercializing of the land and culture by (predominantly white) westerners, so take most things shown in the episode with a grain of salt if you’re looking for accurate depictions of native Hawaiian culture. So moving forward, in list form this time since it’s easier to read (there’s a lot to cover here):\n\nThe episode covers what leis tend to symbolize nowadays, but traditionally, leis are considered sacred to Hawaiians (which means yes it’s pretty appropriative to wear those cheap plastic knock-offs as a non-Hawaiian) are tied to many practices such as religious ceremonies and peace agreements. Traditional leis were also made of more than just flowers, using materials such as leaves, shells, nuts, and feathers, among others.\n\nWaikiki Beach is now one of Hawaii’s most popular tourist destinations, but it is an important political landmark in Hawaiian history, once being a governmental center and the site of a historic battle taking place in 1974.\n\nHula kahiko (traditional hula) was practiced prior to 1894 and was often practiced in many different ways reflecting different styles; they were also performed at ceremonies of religious worship. Fire dancing has actually been performed in numerous different cultures, including Aztec and Balinese.\n\nDiamond Head (called Lēʻahi) in Hawaiian) is a volcanic cone near Honolulu. In Hawaiian legend, its where the volcano goddess Pele and her younger sister lived at one point.\n\nKing Kamehameha I (no not that kamehameha), also known as Kamehameha the Great, is one of the most well known leaders in Hawaiian history because he unified the Hawaiian islands during a time when the west was just beginning to gain interest in using it for military/economic purposes. There are actually 3 different statues of him besides the one the Komabros visit in the episode (which is in front of Aliʻiōlani Hale in Honolulu, the current residence of the Hawaiian Supreme Court), with the others being found on North Kohala near Kamehameha I’s birthplace, on the island of Hilo, and in Washington D.C. Komasan’s quote at this point in the episode is actually a reference to a Japanese children’s song, “King Hamehameha of the Southern Island” (minami no shima no hamehameha daiou). No idea why they changed his name, but it is in fact about Kamehameha. This song has probably been referenced in numerous other anime as well, but the only other one I know of is a line (the same line that Komasan references, in fact) in the last opening of Keroro Gunso.\n\nLast but not least, Mount Kilauea is actually a bit infamous right now thanks to last year’s pretty horrific eruption that displaced lots of people living near it, though the earliest recorded big eruption was back in 1790. In this part of the episode, I had to rewrite a pun that Komajiro makes which originally referenced how the word for World Heritage Site in Japanese is sekaiisan, which Komasan mistakes to be a person named sekaii-san (as his name also contains “san”).\n\nOkay wow that was a lot! Hope you got some education out of the information dump. Today’s YoTD was Kaeritie, a combination of the “want to” verb conjugation (-tai ending) of the verb kaeru (帰る), “to return” or “to go home,” and… “tie.” The English localization went with Tie-red, which…kiiiinda works? I guess you would want to go home when you’re tired. I actually like the Spanish localized name better - it’s Corbapacasa, from “corbata” (tie) and “me voy pa la casa,” a phrase that means “I’m going home.” Also, this Yo-kai’s segment was surprisingly really touching and sweet, which is something that used to be very prevalent during the show’s early days and sorta faded out later on. I’ve really missed that stuff, though I can’t say Shadowside hasn’t tried to recapture that feeling.\n\nI talked so much that this actually caused me to postpone the release by a day because it took me forever to write and I had other stuff to do. Whoops :L"
