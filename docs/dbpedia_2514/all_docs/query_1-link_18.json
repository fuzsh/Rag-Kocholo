(Softsub, hardsub) Watch this episode on vimeo or dailymotion! Wait whaaaaaat?? Two in one day?! Yeah this wasn’t actually planned from the beginning, but I had a delay because of the extra typesetting with the last episode so I just started this one up in the meantime and...eventually they kinda just synced up with each other. At least this makes up for my prolonged inability to get to releasing already :L This episode’s new Yo-kai was Wall Guy, who...uh...yeah that’s kinda it I think. Just a wall who’s a guy. The closest thing I could think of that might be a sort of pun is that there is one kanji (礙), of which one of the readings is gai, that means “obstruct,” “block,” “hinder,” etc. It doesn’t seem to be a particularly common kanji though so that’s definitely a reach (especially considering that the target audience for this series probably couldn’t even read said kanji). Wall Guy’s localized name is “Judgebrick,” which is...also kind of a mishmash of two words, I guess. Nobody found it easy to name this one, huh? No idea when I’m gonna get around to the next episode but there’s already a big pun just based on the title of one of the segments, so that’s fun. I’ll wait until we get to that episode to explain it, though. Anyway, hope you enjoyed today’s double release. ...Wait... Am I forgetting something? Huh? What new series? I don’t know what you’re talking about... I joke. I just didn’t like it. :L"
