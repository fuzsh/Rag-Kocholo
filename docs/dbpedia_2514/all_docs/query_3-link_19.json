        "text": "Before you start reading my rating, please take a listen to these two songs:\n\nNow in English!\n\nJibanyan Chance:\n\n25%\n\nJibanyan is a Fire-Attribute Yo-kai of the Charming tribe who is the icon of a extremely popular franchise in Japan. (From the creators of Professor Layton)\n\nYo-kai are supernatural spirits who roam around the town haunting and causing mischief to people, ranging from Yo-kai that can make a person suddenly want to pee to one that can force you buy unnecessary things when you're out shopping. The premise itself is different from Pokemon as the player's goal revolves around searching the town of Springdale with the use\n\nof a special device called the Yo-kai Watch to search, battle, and befriend Yo-kai to stop their bad deeds.\n\nThe gameplay of Yo-kai Watch is vastly different from Pokemon too. The only elements they share is that they involve a large amount of creatures to collect. After that, that is where the similarities between the two end. Unlike the usual RPG turn-based battle system, Yo-Kai Watch's battles takes place in real-time. Your party auto-fights opponents, and as they do, you use their special abilities to aid you in battle.\n\nSince the first game's debut, Yo-kai Watch has become a massive phenomenon in Japan with exploding with manga, anime, spinoffs, mobile games, and merchandise across every street of Japan, selling in at over 7 million copies of the franchise's games total.\n\n(Combining Yo-kai Watch Busters' sales, it goes up to over 8 billion)\n\n(Another fact: The second YW game outsold Pokemon Omega Ruby/Sapphire in sales).\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nI'll be listing EVERYTHING that made Yokai Watch extremely popular in Japan:\n\nJapanese promotional poster for the anime. Currently claimed as one of the top 10 children anime of Japan.\n\nThe Yokai Watch movie promotional poster. The movie made $55 million (ï¿¥6.5 billion in yen) since its hit debut, also making the biggest grossing opening of any Japanese movie since 2000.\n\nMerchandise of this franchise in Japan has been selling like hotcakes, as The toys Namco Bandai has been making for Yokai Watch have been selling over 10 billion yen ($93 billion in U.S.) to show its staggering success. Many Japanese stores has Yo-kai Watch merchandise ready to buy! The medals are also compatible with the arcade machines YW has, which is also extremely popular with kids.\n\nIt doesn't end there... there's still more Yo-kai Watch to come, this spawned more than just the ones I listed!\n\nAn upcoming attraction for Universal Studios Japan, YW has gotten so popular to warrant its own attraction.\n\nIt's already has its name ingrained in restaurants, stores, trains, and even a Japanese singing group.\n\nmogmog burgers, YW's parody of Mcdonalds, this Mcdonalds recently just transformed into its parody counterpart.\n\nNyaKB, YW's parody of the popular AKB48 band, whom AKB48 actually partnered with Level-5 with to do concerts for them.\n\nOne of the many trains you can find in Japan now.\n\nCars for the iconic Komasan and Komajiro characters of YW. Expanding from merchandise to cars is crazy!?!?!?!?!\n\nYo-kai Watch advertisement in a Japanese theme park.\n\nThe first official YW store called \"Yorozumart\" coming in Tokyo this October. Shows how much the franchise has gained.\n\nI also have to mention the music especially!\n\nThis very music video spawned a large collection of catchy songs that reigned over Japan as one of the top songs in Japan, with over 100,000,000+ views total. Various parodies were made for the song as well.\n\nRanging from the very catchy Gera Gera Po (Yo-kai Watch's anime opening song):\n\nto the Dan Dan Zombie Zubah:\n\nto the \"Idol wa Ooh-Nya-Nya no Ken\"\n\nto the catchy Uchu Dance:\n\nThese music reigned so high, that a Just Dance version was created to show its high popularity:\n\nThe songs expanded into concerts and live shows in most of the Asian countries like Taiwan and Singapore:\n\nWatched by thousands of people when a concert comes.\n\nPeople worldwide and in Japan as a whole already know the songs and dances:\n\nThis as a whole represents Youkai Watch's popularity as a franchise. With YW having so many accomplishments done with its raging success in the east and high amount of requests in Japan, he's already an immediate candidate for the ballot.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nThe only issues Jibanyan has to deal with is his Japan status as it may really hurt his chances in the long run, potential competition with Layton, and the fact his franchise may also be considered too new to Sakurai since it's only been two years since the franchise started. Right now, the situation could change after the game releases in America and Europe. It's already get a ****load of advertisement right now with the anime (which recently aired in Disney XD), manga (recently released in stores now), and large amount of promotion Nintendo is aiding with:\n\nAccording to the English Writer for the Yo-kai Watch anime, promotion for the game will hit like a tidal wave:\n\nGiven with booming Pokemon-like success with Yokai Watch in Japan, Sakurai may give Jibanyan a shot at being playable even the game hasn't been localized yet to make up for the fact his franchise is too new and Japan only for now with its large promotion coming in the West and Europe.\n\nSumming things up, these are the reasons why I consider Jibanyan's chances better than some people think.\n\nJibanyan Want:\n\n100%\n\nI'll be honest, when I first collaborated with @PoopFeast420 and @BandannaWaddleDee , I didn't think I would like the franchise at all.\n\nThen I watched the anime, and kept watching it as the show kept amusing me and kept me laughing with Keita's slice of life with various different Yo-kai. (You should watch it for yourself, there's a load of meme worthy material in it) Sooner or later, I began to hum the songs Japan was raving about and did a lot of research of how popular Yo-kai Watch is in Japan, and holy **** there was a lot to know, it's amazing to see what Yo-kai Watch has accomplished in the span of 2 years.\n\nI'm incredibly hyped for this game, and my avatars of Katie/Fumi show immediate proof of that. I already got imported YW merchandise staying next to my desk in my room and took the liberty to buy Disney XD, solely for the Yo-kai Watch english dub (and Gravity Falls).\n\nIf Jibanyan got inya~, I'd scream \"MONGEE!\" and be really damn hyped for his WON-DA-FUL! inclusionya~, so hyped that it would make Jinmenken piss in a pole somewhere that would make him go to jail yet again.\n\nIn my top 3 in character wants now.\n\nIf you're interested, feel free to take a look at the support thread if you're interested in learning more about the franchise.\n\nJibanyan chances: 3.1%\n\nCopy and paste from my first rating:\n\nRemember what I said in Rayman's day about him being unlikely because of his lack of popularity in Japan compared to the western audience? Well, Jibanyan is like the reverse of this, except that we have precedent about Smash helping a Japan-exclusive series becoming well liked overseas (Fire Emblem). YÅkai Watch is a craze and cultural phenomenon in Japan, with Jibanyan supposedly rivaling with Pikachu as far as mainstream popularity goes. Not to mention we also have a precedent of a third-party newcomer added through DLC for his merits related to his iconicness despite the initial demand from the Smash audience being nothing special (Ryu if the sound files mean anything).\n\nThat said, Jibanyan I think has some non-negligible things going against him. Whereas Nintendo partially owns PokÃ©mon, YÅkai Watch is fully third-party due to being owned by a company Nintendo doesn't own in any way (Level-5) though they admittedly have a good relationship. Getting into Smash Bros. is never an easy thing for any character owned by neither Nintendo or one of their subsidiaries, and can YÅkai Watch's popularity justify Jibanyan's inclusion in Smash? The games for what I believe have not been imported overseas, though Nintendo is planning to do it by publishing the games by themselves similar to how they published the Professor Layton series. Being third-party or not established outside of Japan aren't a deal breaker as proven by characters like Marth and Sonic, but when combined I believe they're multiplying, not adding, their negative effect on Jibanyan's chances. Third-party characters always had been huge deals in Smash Bros. with mainstream appeal, standing-out historical importance and \"WOH!\" factor, and while Jibanyan may have these in Japan, he absolutely lacks them overseas, as the overall reaction of western fans will mostly be like \"Who?\" which is the exact contrary of what you want for putting a third-party character in SSB.\n\nOverall I don't see Jibanyan as a likely contender due to lacking the worldwide mainstream appeal which means his inclusion would kind of go against Sakurai's philosophy about third-party characters getting into Smash Bros. The YÅkai Watch games had not been released overseas yet and while it may change in the future, it getting a playable character in Smash Bros. as a way to secure its popularity instead of rewarding the series for what it did for Nintendo is something unprecedented in the history of Super Smash Bros. and something most likely going against Sakurai's current philosophy about third-party characters getting in. But if it's that much of a big deal in Japan at the point it's worth rewarding it by adding Jibanyan as a playable character in Smash Bros. I could see it happening, especially considering Nintendo's excellent relationship with Level-5.\n\nWell, now we have the international release officially announced, but we already knew it was going to be a thing back then anyway. That said, I'm sticking with my old rating for now. Most of what I said in this rating still applies.\n\nOne other thing I'm wondering about is whether The PokÃ©mon Company will be okay to crossover with the new big monster collection franchise which is stealing their spotlight right now\n\nJibanyan want: 0%\n\nNo thanks. Not only I'm getting tired of the idea of getting more third-parties, but I don't want a relatively young character who only had been influent in one area, regardless of how much influence he had over there. Let him develop his fame and be sure he stands the test of time worldwide before shoehorning him in Smash, please.\n\n-----\n\nRandom joke PokÃ©mon of the day:\n\nChances and want:\n\n-----\n\nKlonoa prediction: 1.23%\n\nRelatively obscure I guess.\n\nBarbara prediction: 3.51%\n\nSame as above, but is a Nintendo character at least. Also being a removed Assist Trophy will maybe boost some ratings.\n\nNominating:\n\nConcept: ballot runner-ups as SMM costumes x1\n\nConcept: non-playable only representation for indie character x4"
