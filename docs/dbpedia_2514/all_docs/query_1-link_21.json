        "text": "To the best of my memory, my first interaction with Pokémon came by the way of an early rerun of the TV anime. I was at my grandparents house for Christmas break in December of 1998, and I remember sneaking downstairs to watch cartoons more than once because they had something we didn’t back home — cable TV. Based on my memory, it was most likely episode 43 of the original series, Showdown at Dark City.\n\nI don’t expressly recall asking for any Pokémon toys back then. I was very into cats as a kid and, well, rocks, I guess? I was five and spent a lot of time watching VHS tapes of The Lion King and The Secret of NIMH, along with whatever else my mom and aunt had lying around. Either way, I suppose my family realized that Pokémon was the “it” thing to buy kids, because I do remember getting the “Overgrowth” theme deck for my birthday a month later.\n\nAs much as I loved Pokémon as a kid, my only real interactions with the media were through the trading card game for a full year. We didn’t have cable, and I didn’t get a Game Boy Color until Christmas of 1999 when I was 6. Pokémon's three pillars are the games, the anime, and the trading card game, and I was fully missing out on two of those. That’s enough for a child with a wildly overactive imagination, but I’m sure Nintendo would have loved even more of my family’s money beyond my weekly allowance that was immediately blown on booster packs. I guess my gambling addiction has some deep roots.\n\nPokémon has for nearly 30 years been successful on these three strengths, maintaining it’s top spot as highest grossing media franchise by a number that renders it leaps and bounds away from its next closest competitor, with licensed merchandise — Pokémon is a lifestyle brand after all — being its biggest contributor to success.\n\nI feel like I often think of Pokémon being unique or original in it’s success, but really, I don’t feel like it would have been as successful as it has been if not for the individual strengths of each arm of its media empire. As a media franchise, Pokémon’s various components came over time, first through the video games, then the card games, and the anime nearly a year later after the games’ release. But none of this was unique to Pokémon, it was just the first to become a truly runaway success.\n\nIn a 2013 interview with cultural anthropologist Ian Condry and professor of film studies Marc Steinberg, USC Communications Professor and culture critic Henry Jenkins discussed the importance and relevance of media mix to the success of the Japanese industry. Said Condry:\n\nEven so, with Astro Boy, the series was a huge success. This solidified the notion in Japan that even relatively poor animation could be popular, especially if it relied on already-popular manga characters. To this day, about 60% of Japanese animation is based on popular characters.\n\nSteinberg later added:\n\nBetting that TV stations would refuse to pay the actual costs of production of a 30-minute animated TV show, Tezuka Osamu sold Astro Boy at a loss. He figured he’d make back the money on licensing fees for character goods — what we’d now call franchising — and international sales. So anime depends on other media (from toys to comics to video games) for its very survival.\n\nPokémon's achievements were based on an already successful model, even if there was no guarantee it would become what it is today. It’s no surprise then that people would try to replicate it’s success over time. There’s no list of franchises that are clearly taking notes from the success of the absolute cultural juggernaut that is Pokémon, whether it’s Digimon, Medabots, or Monster Rancher.\n\nAll of these properties are close enough in time to Pokémon's debut and initial rise to stardom that you could call them more endemic of the types of successful media breaking out of Japan at the time and less an attempt to replicate the formula, but it’s hard to argue that Pokémon's success wasn’t worth copying. By the 2000s, Pokémon had more or less emerged as the clear victor of whatever fight was being had, and we all collectively gave up on trying to beat it for a while.\n\nIronically, most of these properties are still somewhat successful, at least in Japan. The late 2000s saw the arrival of Bakugan, which if there was ever something “shounen” enough to dethrone Pokémon, Bakugan was it, but Pokémon’s success nowadays is in part to how well its managed to diversify it’s audience to people of all ages and genders. Not that shounen isn’t watched by a diverse audience, but the Bakugan anime series is so Pokémon meets Beyblade in a way that literally makes me want to remove any trace of masculinity from my body. It’s kind of painful! The toys rule though.\n\nAll that said, let’s talk about Yo-K- actually let’s talk about Level-5 first.\n\nLevel-5 is a Japanese video game developer known for some of the best games that your high school friend from AP English says “absolutely rule, dude” like Dark Cloud 2, a game I’ve never played, and White Knight Chronicle, a game I have that probably no one else should. Actually, never mind. White Knight Chronicles rules. Every RPG-hating games media personality in 2010 owes me $10 for telling me this game was bad. You’ve probably played at least one Level-5 title, and statistically, it was either Ni no Kuni or Professor Layton.\n\nLevel-5 has also been trying to coldly, scientifically, and surgically create the perfect, world-ending, mixed media franchise since about 2008. Starting with Inazuma Eleven, then Little Battlers Experience, then Yo-Kai Watch, before most recently trying with Snack World.\n\nYo-Kai Watch was trying and for a while, succeeding, in capturing the magic that Pokémon had when it first debuted in 1996. It’s obviously drawing more specifically from Japanese folklore than the vague inspirations that Pokémon’s creatures take from, but it did succeed in having an identity that was unique to itself.\n\nPokémon actually doesn’t work very well as an example of transmedia storytelling, in that the stories each of its products are trying to tell are dissimilar and distinct from each other narratively and functionally, only using the actual Pokémon themselves as a shared element between them. The games and the anime have never followed each other outside of loose story beats, and neither have the various manga adaptations of the franchise.\n\nYo-Kai Watch is significantly more deliberate in its attempts to deliver a cohesive narrative, especially with the games and the anime, the later of which is the most successful aspect of the brand, at least in Japan. Even then though, the cutaway scenes in the anime offered QR codes to unlock bonus medals in the 3DS games, even in the dubbed version.\n\nEven the toys had these codes on the back, rewarding fans who bought the toys with more in-game goods. From a merchandise perspective, this offered a multi-layered incentive strategy to fans of the series. It ALL wanted to suck you in and keep you there.\n\nAnd honestly, why shouldn’t it? The anime is well;\n\nThe Yo-Kai Watch anime does still have multiple coherent plotlines, but leans into the absurdity of the different Yo-Kai and how they bizarrely influence the humans around the protagonist. It’s less shounen and more comedy, less Pokémon and more Doraemon. It’s engaging, funny, and it was honestly the energy a depressed 22 year-old me needed in 2015 to function in day-to-day life.\n\nThe dub is moderately bad, and there’s no real good place to watch it nowadays anyway, which is a shame. A lot of the best kids anime never gets the localization work it needs, like most of the best Pretty Cure series or even most of Yo-Kai Watch, with the dub ending pretty early into the second season.\n\nThe games haven’t faired much better, with Yo-Kai Watch 3 selling a relatively dismal amount of copies which wasn’t helped by Level-5 Abby doing jack all to advertise the game stateside, plus a dismal amount of copies being produced considering the Nintendo Switch was already wildly successful when it finally hit the U.S. in 2019, despite being one of the more complete versions of the game. 4 has yet to be localized and probably never will.\n\nThe games, to me, are still pretty magical. I’ve spent a good amount of time this holiday season replaying 3, and I miss and enjoy how relaxed the pace of these games is. There’s an overarching plot to go after, but you’re genuinely rewarded to take your time exploring every inch of the world and befriending every Yo-Kai you find.\n\nIt isn’t a difficult game, and the combat is sometimes frustratingly simplistic, but its a genuinely charming in a way that other games in the genre have failed to be, in part because the Yo-Kai have a significant amount of personality, more than even their contemporaries in Digimon and other similar series.\n\nWriting for Cubed3, some hack named Michael Howard said about the second game:\n\nYo-kai Watch 2 still hugely charming, and absolutely adorable. The amount of personality that the Yo-kai have is something no other series with creature befriending mechanics has managed to pull off. Even the NPCs feel unique and individual, which is unusual for an RPG. The character writing is something that’s truly exceptional, especially for a series this young.\n\nFor all that praise, though, I can’t help but by cynical about Yo-Kai Watch, despite my enduring love of the franchise and putting aside it’s relatively bleak looking future to the side. Yo-Kai Watch’s moments of brilliance feel more like accidents that happened along the way in Level-5 and CEO Akihiro Hino’s attempt to capture some once-in-a-lifetime magic and maintain its success for time and all eternity.\n\nYo-Kai Watch expanded too quickly for its own good, its own success quickly paving the way for its downfall through a myriad of blunders and an inability to innovate in meaningful ways. Rushing development times to capitalize on flash in the pan popularity to the absolute maximum led to the seemingly inevitable downfall of what could have genuinely been a beloved series. As much as I love the second game, you can really feel that it came out almost exactly one year later.\n\nYo-Kai Watch was never going to be the next Pokémon, despite what vapid Viz Media executives from 2015 would have told you. It’s not for any cultural reasons, or for lack of a quality product. Yo-Kai Watch as a franchise was produced in such a thoughtless way for the back half of the last decade that it never found any meaningful ways to innovate past introducing new characters and maybe a couple new maps per game, something that Pokémon, for all its faults, does know to do the bare minimum on.\n\nDespite that, everyone should play at least one game in the series at some point if you love a good monster collector. Yo-Kai Watch 2: Psychic Specters or 3 are probably the best ways to experience the franchise, but the original anime is still charming up to about midway through season 2. It’s an interesting cultural curiosity, but one whose relevance is rapidly fading.\n\n…is what I would say, but it really didn’t have much to begin with."
