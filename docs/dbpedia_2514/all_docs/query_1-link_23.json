        "text": "Breakdown\n\nYo-Kai Watch dub hasn’t moved to Vancouver Beyblade Burst Turbo readies as Teletoon slips back into shortlived Evolution reruns Buddyfight Ace dub preview\n\nYo-Kai Watch dub hasn’t moved to Vancouver\n\nAfter disappearing for a year, new episodes of Yo-Kai Watch finally debuted on Disney XD in the United States earlier today. The reason for the delay appeared to be due to an overhaul on the voice department, as the original Los Angeles-based cast had announced that they were being replaced for what was described as budgetary reasons. In February, I reported on news that seemed to suggest the dub was moving to Vancouver.\n\nI say seemed, because it’s actually still a Los Angeles cast. Just not the same one as before. While the English dub of Yo-Kai Watch was originally a non-union production (necessitating some cast members to work under pseudonyms), that changed with the second season and the movie. As the current cast was brought in to cut costs, features more traditional Los Angeles anime dub voice actors, and is nowhere to be found in the SAG-AFTRA database, it’s a near certainty the show has reverted back to being a non-union production.\n\nWhat about those Tweets from the Vancouver crew? Well, as it turns out, they did in fact work on the dub. On the theme music for it. Composer William Anderson produced a remixed version of Jeff “Swampy” Marsh’s earlier opening song. He also created an English-language version of the Japanese “Space Dance” track, with singing by Gabriel Brown, Michelle Creber and Rebecca Soichet.\n\nI obviously wasn’t expecting this outcome. I must’ve been possessed by some red herring-looking Yo-Kai that made me leap to conclusions. My apologies.\n\nOne more curious bit about Yo-Kai Watch season 3. The dub is being recorded at SDI Media’s Los Angeles studio. SDI Media is a multi-national localization house that was purchased by Japanese post-production company Imagica, alongside Sumitomo and Cool Japan, for $160 million in 2015. Later that year, Imagica acquired majority ownership of Yo-Kai Watch animation studio OLM. Alongside Level-5 abby, the English version of Yo-Kai Watch is produced by Sprite Animation, an American outfit that OLM aligned itself with in 2009. Coincidence or possibly a sign of things to come in regards to shows OLM is a little more involved with? Only time will tell.\n\nBeyblade Burst Turbo readies as Teletoon slips back into shortlived Evolution reruns\n\nEager Beyblade fans have spotted a localized listing for Burst’s third season on the website for production house d-rights. Known in Japan as Beyblade Burst Chouzetsu, the spinoff Beyblade Burst Turbo launched on TV Tokyo in Japan on April 2nd.\n\nHere’s a plot synopsis:\n\nAiger Akabane is a wild child, who grew up surrounded by nature.\n\nInspired by a chance Bey battle with Valt Aoi, Aiger sets his sights on becoming an invincible Blader with the help of his Turbo Bey, Z Achilles.\n\nBattling powerful opponents and seeking strength; Aiger sets out to defeat Valt and claim the title of World Champion.\n\nHere begins Aiger’s tale of epic adventures and fierce battles on his way to the top.\n\nNo word on when Sunrights plans on launching the series internationally, though given the first two seasons debuted in the fall, that’s likely a safe bet. Beyblade Burst’s dub is produced by Ocean Productions utilizing talent from both Vancouver and Alberta.\n\nMeanwhile, Teletoon’s run of the second season, Beyblade Burst Evolution, has once again hit a premiere hiatus. After episode 38 aired on June 24th, the channel went back to episode 34. Teletoon will run episode 39 on July 15th, with the new episodes expected to continue. Same Saturday and Sunday slot as usual.\n\nBuddyfight Ace dub preview\n\nThe dub for the original Future Card Buddyfight series came to a close on June 30th. However, Bushiroad did not follow it with the succeeding series the following week. Though a teaser for the new show was included with the finale:\n\nThe episode cameo, TCG commercial and preview confirms that Griffin Kingston will voice the lead, Yuga Mikado. He’s the son of the original show’s protagonist and is also a YouTuber … Unless there’s an unexpected change, Kingston’s casting should also confirm that the franchise will continue to be dubbed in Alberta."
