        "text": "Yo-kai Watch! Episode 2 Subs Released!\n\nYou want to talk about unreasonableness? This is my first episode on this show and I’m already overdue by another episode airing in Japan.\n\nnyaa.si (hard): https://nyaa.si/view/1137403 nyaa.si (soft): https://nyaa.si/view/1137402 vimeo: https://vimeo.com/331672960\n\nYou may have heard me say on Twitter, though I didn’t talk about it much - I’m going to still be subbing the original series while also juggling some episodes of the new Yo-kai Watch Exclamation Point anime! This one’s going to be on priority for a while. Don’t expect me to stay caught up lol.\n\nYo-kai time! Fukuryuu just means “lucky dragon,” Li-fujin’s pun actually gets explained in the episode (through Translators Notes because Keita’s line forced me to). Additionally, while she doesn’t appear in the episode, “Komami” is a simple mixture of Koma(inu) and Mami, an actual girl name.\n\nThe “Oldie Wig Club” segment has a title that’s pronounced “Ossan-dzura-bu,” in a joke where it sounds just like the drama Ossan’s Love (pronounced like “Ossanzu Rabu”). As far as I know that’s where the correlation stops and the entire segment feels so random as if it was only made to justify that pun. Thankfully you might have noticed Wig being a very popular joke where we are in 2019 so at least the segment isn’t ENTIRELY drained of its comedy when that pun gets lost in translation…right?\n\nUntil next time!\n\nEdit: I forgot to point something out - a couple of reusable aspects were skipped for the time being due to trying to get this out early. In particular: the logo script in the OP, and a karaoke script for the ED. Those will be present in the next episode!"
