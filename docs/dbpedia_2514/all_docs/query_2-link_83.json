        "text": "In an interview with the Daily Star, Mariah May spoke about her time in AEW so far and said that the locker room has been like a family. May is set to challenge Toni Storm for the AEW Women’s World title at All In later this month.\n\nOn her journey in wrestling so far: “Gosh, I mean where to start. I wanted to wrestle since I was a child. Then when I left school, I was training whilst working other jobs to pay for the training. Then I started to work on the indies but I think mainstay is generous! I was definitely working as hard as I could. I was travelling all over the country, training where I could, taking seminars where I could, doing whatever shows I could – in front of maybe 10 people on average. Then I had the opportunity to go to Japan, within my first few weeks – I was only supposed to go for a couple of months – I was asking if I could stay for longer. They asked how long, and I said as long as I can, forever? They said sure! So I ended up moving to Japan on a whim, I had maybe two suitcases of stuff! I got to wrestle 100 matches which was really pivotal for me in making the jump to America, being on TV and being a part of AEW. It did all happen very quickly but there was a lot of travel and work in that journey to AEW and now to be able to wrestle at Wembley!”\n\nOn what wrestling at Wembley Stadium means to her: “Its kind of crazy. I’ve been to Wembley a few times for concerts and sports. To think ‘I get to be here and wrestle?!”. But I’ve worked really hard and I made my mark on Toni Storm. People say my rise was super quick and they didn’t see it coming but I did. Because I was smart. I picked Toni Storm for a reason, and this, Wembley, was the goal I had in mind.”"
