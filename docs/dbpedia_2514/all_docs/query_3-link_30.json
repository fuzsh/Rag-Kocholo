There's a recommendation to befriend him sometime before or after Kyubi's chapter, since trying to fight him post-game is insane.\n\nI got myself a Chummer to take most of the blows (soultimate boosts defense and makes him the center of attention), Betterfly to heal him, and Benkei for DPS.\n\nThe problem is that his recruitment rate is about the same as any other yo-kai: high levels of bullshit. Get 3 pieces of marbled meat and save before trying. If you don't get him after said pieces, soft reset and try again until he befriends you.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>122280509\n\nYes he can, took me about 20 tries though. He gets harder the higher your watch rank is, so it's advisable to get him early and he will be your best friend all the way to end-game. It is generally advisable to never let your yokai die against him, as he gets a buff that stacks for every kill he gets.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report] Image search: [Google]\n\nFile: RIP.png (805 KB, 895x698) Image search: [Google]\n\n805 KB, 895x698\n\n>>122280754\n\n>tfw i thought i'd just get to post game and beat his face in\n\n>beat the post game final boss\n\n>rolled up to an intersection and jaywalked my as off like i meant something\n\n>snartle beats my fucking shit in\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\nWhat rank do cute ghost girls start showing up?

You have to hit the correct fire thing around him so he doesn't trigger enter rage mode, but if you get the wrong one he whacks you back for half your yokai's health. and he keeps spinning it so you have to guess which one is the correct one by trial and error.
