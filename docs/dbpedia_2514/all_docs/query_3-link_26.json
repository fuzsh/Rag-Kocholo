Kids are playing on 3DS, they're playing on Mobile. For YW to be as successful as Pokemon was in the west, it has to go to mobile. The install base is there.\n\nPokemon is still doing well because it appeals to a small branch of kids with 3DS's but also banks on nostalgia. YW doesn't have that nostalgia so it isn't doing well with adults. And in 15 years time it's unlikely that the people who played YW on 3DS will still be looking forward to the new one\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>317579794\n\nNigga.
