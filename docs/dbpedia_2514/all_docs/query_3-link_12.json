        "text": "So looks like we're rating Jibanyan's chances for tomorrow, I would've prepared for this earlier, but I just forgot.\n\nAny additional points we could use to help show Jibanyan's chances are getting better?\n\nWhat should we improve upon in this? This was the last rating I gave:\n\nJibanyan Chance: 20%\n\nJibanyan is the icon of the extremely popular franchise in Japan from Level-5. In the games, the gameplay revolves around searching around Sakura New Town for Yo-kai, Yo-kai are supernatural spirits who roam around the town haunting and causing mischief to people, one player can befriend (or catch to put it in Pokemon terms) one of these by giving them good they like before beginning the battle and defeating them (basically similar to Pokemon to a large extent). Jibanyan is one of these kinds of creatures found in-game, a fire-attribute Yo-kai and the most iconic out of all of them. The actual battle gameplay involves a rotating spinner that can be used to switch Yokai, clear up status effects, or charge up a Yo-kai's special abilities to win at battle.\n\nSince the first game's debuted, it has become a massive phenomenon in Japan with exploding with manga, anime, and merchandise across every street of Japan, selling in at over 7 million copies of the games total, as much of a fast pace as Pokemon. With it's success and upcoming release in the West, he's already an immediate qualifier for Sakurai to advertise the game in West and increase Yo-kai Watch exposure. He's already being highly requested in Japan too, so he's definitely under Sakurai's radar right now if he didn't plan him pre-ballot.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nHere's a potential special moves for Jibanyan for those who aren't convinced, created by @@BandanaWaddleDee :\n\nB: Komanyachi (the wiki doesn't really explain what the animations for his moves are, so I can't be sure)\n\nSide B: Possession (He possesses an opponent near him and puts a paralysis charm on them, which paralyzes them for a bit, that's what the wiki says his possession does)\n\nUp B: Hyakuretsunikukyu (does a barrage of flurry punches with his paws, which can also be used to recover\n\nDown B: Nyoe (works like Diddy Kong's peanut popgun. charges up his attack and hits anyone around him, but if he charges up too much, he hurts himself comedicly)\n\nFinal Smash: Robonyan (switches out with his future self, which is not really bigger, but he's stronger, and faster too. Can fire rocket punches, use his jetpack, transform into a car, etc)\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nIf you need more proof that Yokai Watch is extremely popular, then check out this:\n\nThis of itself describes the amount of success shown Yokai Watch has gotten, it's like what happened when Pokemon boomed like crazy in Japan when the games were released.\n\nIf you want a quick summary of Yokai Watch from someone else, mai boy Etika has you covered:\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nArguments:\n\nBut, but! His game hasn't been released in other regions yet! That means he's ineligible right?\n\nRight now, the situation could change after the game releases in 2016 in America and Europe. Given the staggering popularity of the franchise right now, there is the potential good chance Smash may aid the Yokai Watch franchise with a newcomer just like with Marth and Roy when they were added in Melee when their franchise was very popular. Given with booming Pokemon-like success with Yokai Watch in Japan, Sakurai may give Jibanyan a shot at being playable even the game hasn't been localized yet.\n\nHE'S NOT AS SUPER ICONIC AS RYU, MARIO, MEGAMAN, SONIC, AND PAC-MAN! He can't be in Smash ever.\n\nYet, there is no specific criteria rules other than the interview in Famitsu in October and his \"special case\" criteria. We don't know if Sakurai will just strictly add just super famous icons as DLC, for all we know, he could just change his mind even though Sakurai said things against certain characters like \"no fighting game characters aloud\" pre-Smash 4. If the rules can be broken for fighting game characters, the unconfirmed rules can be potentially broken for 3rd parties too.\n\n_____________________________________________\n\nJibanyan Want:\n\n85%\n\nI've became very invested in the Yokai Watch anime as of recent, and I have watched a whole load of to understand why Yo-kai Watch is such a phenomenon in Japan. It has a lot of very inventive ideas and characters, the idea of Yo-kai creatures really warm up to you pretty easily, and it gets pretty addicting as more episodes come by (P.S. the protagonist also collects lots of different Yokai, including legendary ones, unlike Ash.\n\nI'm sure the appeal is probably the same with the games too. I really want to see Jibanyan in, Jibanyan vs. Pikachu is probably the biggest rivalry I want to see right now. Trust me when I say it will become a phenomenon in other countries too (quite possibly outnumbering Pokemon too), I can guarantee that many of you are going to be fans of it once it releases in 2016.\n\nNominations:\n\nx5 Viridi\n\nIf you're interested, feel free to take a look at the support thread if you're interested in learning more about the franchise."
