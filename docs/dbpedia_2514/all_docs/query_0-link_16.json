The best way around it i think is to charge your tank's soutlimate but not activate it. Leave it inactivated for use again when the Oni does their soultimate again. The Oni's target prioritizes anyone charging a soultimate so even their own soultimate will go for the one charging.\n\nSticker of hate has greater priority however, and the Oni will always target the person with it, even with their Soultimate and even if one of your other youkai does a soultimate. It's a bit of a give and take between the sticker and ski masks. A tank with a sticker can draw any and all single target attacks but at the cost of lowered defense, freeing up your other youkai to have other items besides ski masks. Conversely ski masks give your tank the ability to wear a nice defensive item at the cost of not avoiding soultimates normally and providing no other bonuses.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>125544152\n\nI guess I will try that, but I looked at a video of someone defeating him with a similar team except kusanagi instead of bushinyan, and his shield is always the one targeted. Bushinyan is always targeted on my team and gets attacked (by normal attacks) every time I revive him unless I bring him to full HP (which can't be done unless I swap/get supports killed or use the expensive 1/day one).\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report] Image search: [Google]\n\n>>125544298\n\nIs your Bushinyan wearing a ski mask or does your tank have a sticker? If it's yes to any of these he shouldnt be attacked at all except for maybe the Oni's soultimate.\n\nI dont think Ski masks will save you if your youkai is at half health or less, they go for the youkai that are closest to death. To my knowledge the sticker will still draw their attacks but it is a stronger effect than ski masks.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>125544561\n\nJust tried again and he gets attacked by the special attack again.\n\nLeft him dead and the next time he targeted my shield.\n\nAnd I am looking at another video and he was also targeting only the shield (Togenyan in all 3 cases).\n\nSo I am pretty sure Bushinyan is a bad pick and always gets targeted by the special attack for some reason.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>125544298\n\nHave you tried using the vampire fangs? I gave all three of my physical attackers vampire fangs and I was able to get through the black oni with few problems.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report] Image search: [Google]\n\n>>125544759\n\nBy special attack do you mean soultimate?\n\nThe ski masks wont save him man, only the sticker of hate reliably and consistently draws all attacks, even soultimates.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>125544928\n\nI don't think you know what you are talking about. I swapped Bushinyan for Ookuwanokami and this time Togenyan got targeted every time. I assume he attacks whoever deals the most damage to him and I raised him with too much defense.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report] Image search: [Google]\n\n>>125545417\n\nI usually say think for a reason, i'm not 100% on this, just from what i've seen.\n\nI know for that sticker of hate draws all the Oni's attacks, at least from what i've seen and ski masks dont save them from soultimates. If you're saying that the Oni was doing normal attacks and techniques on Bushinyan even with Ski Masks than i dont know, that's never happened to me.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>125545729\n\nNo, he gets targeted by the special attack always, probably because his damage is higher than Togenyan reflects and other attackers don't.\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>125545817\n\nDoes he get targeted by it even when another Youkai is charging their soultimate?\n\n>>\n\nAnonymous\n\n[Report]\n\n>>125545880\n\nI don't know but that doesn't matter since they would lose their guard if I was charging and die too.
