In File:Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum 01.jpg, it is written as \"per Commons:Deletion requests/File:Herwarth Walden vor der Portrâtbüste 'Walden' von William Wauer, 1918.jpg\". But, I think the correct is \"per Commons:Deletion requests/Files in Category:Fukui Prefectural Dinosaur Museum\". Is it right? --Yuraily Lic (talk)\n\nHi, yes you're right. It's a bug likely coming from Help:Gadget-DelReqHandler, the tool I use to close the DRs. I restored it and redeleted it with the right rationale.

Thanks in advance, Chem Sim 2001 (disc)\n\nDone Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nThanks for that quick help! :-) Regards, Chem Sim 2001 (disc)\n\nWhat's the etiquette here, for future reference? Should I have gone through other language wikis to check (as I assume was the case) that this image was being used in error, and replaced it with the original everywhere before starting the deletion discussion? Or do we assume those articles might be using the lower quality photo for a good reason, and leave it? --Lord Belbury (talk)\n\nRegarding the potential deletion the relevant policy is COM:INUSE. As far I am aware there is no specific policies to say if you can go through other language wikis to remove or not a specific image. However my personal opinion is that each image will be a different case. This image is used in several wikis since the time of its upload in 2013, therefore one may think it is useful, or at least no one thought necessary to remove it. So in this case I think it would have been unfair to remove the image from the various wiki, and the same day, to come here nominating the file for deletion saying \"the file is unused\", thing that would have been tecknically true but somewhat unfair as in the reallity the image was used since 2013. That being said you, me or the other users are free to edit the wikis we want, including to remove some images. In my opinion, you can remove or change the image from those wikis, wait a few weeks in order to see if the regular editors of these pages see no objections, then you can go back here and renominate it for deletion if you want.

Je suis déjà heureuse d'avoir detecté, que c'est vous qui avez eliminé la foto sous-mentionnée. Hanns Reich était mon père et il a pris la foto le 9 novembre 1961 dans le miroir de notre entrée, le jour de ma naissance. Comme heritière je suis sure que je possède tous les droits nécessaires. Est-ce que vous pourriez reconstituer la foto s.v.p.ou c'est moi qui doit faire quelque chose? It would be really sad not to have a nice portrait foto with the article. Merci beaucoup de votre engagement et aide, Nina Reich-Olden P.S. Excusez mon francais fautif... Nina Brujita (talk)\n\nBonjour, c'est à vous de faire une démarche, si vous êtes l'héritière de l'artiste qui a fait la photo, vous devez envoyer une permission par mail à notre système de permission, en n'oubliant pas de mentionner le nom exact de la photo \"File:H.R. Selbstportrait.jpg\". Il peut y a voir un délai car il y a une file d'attente qui est gérée par des volontaires, mais si la permission est jugée valide alors l'image sera automatiquement restaurée. Tout ceci est fait pour protéger les potentiels droits d'auteurs (Google translation). Cordialement, Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nBonjour. Je vois que vous avez travaillé avec des photos de Category:Phaeogyroporus sudanicus. Ces deux catégories se réfèrent à la même espèce et il serait donc préférable que l'une d'elles ne soit qu'une redirection vers l'autre. Selon Species Fungorum, le genre actuel est Phlebopus. Seriez-vous d'accord pour que je fusionne la page Category:Phaeogyroporus sudanicus dans la page Category:Phlebopus sudanicus ? Strobilomyces (talk)\n\nYes you can. Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nHi. I just wanted to let you know that the editor, that you asked a couple of years ago to refrain from reverting certain maps, is sadly at it again.[10][11] Could you please have another word with them as I have no wish to engage in a revert war. Thanks. M.Bitton (talk)\n\nHi, I reverted and I made a very last warning, next time I block them. Thank you for the notification. Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nYou deleted the image of the Musical Fence and Kendall Band on the wikipedia page of Paul Matisse. I am Mr Matisse's assistant, who put these on his page. They were taken by Mr Matisse. Please re-instate them. Thank you.\n\nI deleted one of your upload, it was the one that is listed in Commons:Deletion requests/File:Musical Fence.jpg. No I can not restore this image, there are two issues with it. Firstly the image was available in the web before to be here, and is still available in higher resolution, in such case we requires that the copyright holder of the photo send a permission to our permission system, see our relevant policies com:Licensing and com:Scope. Secondly this sculpture was completed in 1980 and is not covered by Freedom of panorama in USA, therefore we also need a permission from the artist. If, as you claim above, Mr Matisse realized the sculpture and the photo, then he can send the both permissions to our permission system. Note that if a compatible license is added to the photo in the official web site, e.g. \"Photo taken by PAUL MATISSE under CC BY 4.0\" (or any other compatible licenses) then that would also be acceptable and I could restore the image.

Regards, Chem Sim 2001 (disc)\n\nHey Christian, here I have this file which can be deleted! The case is clear and we have one additional vote for deletion. Thanks so much, Chem Sim 2001 (disc)\n\nAlready deleted by Leyo. Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nAh yes, thanks anyway! :-) Chem Sim 2001 (disc)\n\nHello! I hope you don't mind me creating some categories for species in Category:Collections of the MNHN (to be sorted out) for species that had red links. Let me know if there is anything else you feel should be needed in these categories or be done to the images.\n\nExamples:\n\nCategory:Plesionika williamsi\n\nCategory:Cytharomorula grayi\n\nCategory:Pyrgulina rudicostae\n\nCategory:Dentimargo grandidietti\n\nCategory:Hastulopsis campbelli\n\nCategory:Marginella impudica\n\nCategory:Marginella marimba\n\nCategory:Propeamussium siratama\n\n--Jonatan Svensson Glad (talk)\n\n@Josve05a: Hello, thansk you for helping, you're welcome. In addition to the site link you must set also Commons category (P373) [14] otherwise {{VN}} display an error message example. And also Commons category (P373) allow to provide the links to parent taxas in the Wikidata infobox when it is used example, and therefore to put the name of the taxon where you are in bold. Even if you don't plan to use the infobox, to make disappear the error message is a sufficient reason to set Commons category (P373).\n\nWhen the category is created and linked to wikidata, you can remove the category Category:Collections of the MNHN (to be sorted out).\n\nPersonaly I recently decided to also add a prominent statement, I also add the image to wikidata, and the infobox in the category, but the category is the main feature to sort the images. Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nYeah, there was a bot previously which went through and fixed these, but it doens't seem to run anymore. I'll make sure to add Commons category (P373) as well. Thanks! --Jonatan Svensson Glad (talk)\n\nBonjour, j'espère que tu as passé de bonnes vacances. Le BOT ne passe plus en VI depuis quelques jours J'ai fait un mot à Dschwen qui je crois s'en occupe mais les nominations s'accumulent et j'ai peur que tout se bloque. Merci de ce que tu pourras faire. --Archaeodontosaurus (talk)\n\nBonjour Didier j'espère que tu vas bien. L'été je n'ai jamais de vacances, je travaille pour un marchant de boisson alors tu imagines.... Je n'ai pas travaillé durant le confinement, ensuite on a repris doucement, et finalement en Juillet et Aout on a travaillé quasiment comme les années précédentes à part pour les gros évènements qui ont été annulé. Quelques heures à peine après que le gouvernement ai ré-ouvert les frontières Européennes au début de l'été, il y a avait des belges au Cap d'Agde! ils devaient être dans les starting-blocks...\n\nEn ce qui concerne le BOT, j'ai mis un message dans le Commons:Village pump/Technical, je ne peut pas t'aider beaucoup plus. J'ai vu qu'il y a plusieurs utilisateurs expérimentés qui sont actif en VI, peut-être pouvez-vous vous partagez les taches pour faire le boulot manuellement, au moins pour taguer les images et les retirer de la liste des candidats (la notification sur la page de discussion n'étant pas absolument nécessaire à mon avis). Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nOK merci je vais au moins commencer... --Archaeodontosaurus (talk)\n\nMerci aussi pour l’église où j'avais oublier de terminer la mise en place ! --Archaeodontosaurus (talk)\n\nHello! Do you have any plans to upload https://www.gbif.org/dataset/search?publishing_org=814cdfb5-d4f8-4453-815f-ea5df98e76bf in the future? If not, could I bribe you for help to do so? Most are either cc-by 4.0 or cc0. --Jonatan Svensson Glad (talk)\n\n@Josve05a: Hi, there are so many data in GBIF that I did not know those ones. But yes I can do it, I will start by uploading the images of this dataset, it will may take a few days. Be aware that I will not be able to sort the images and to create the categories as I have already other stuffs. The images will be uploaded with 3 categories: the taxon in which they are categorized in GBIF but sometimes this category is not the valid one but a synonym, Category:Arizona State University Hasbrouck Insect Collection within Category:Arizona State University and Category:Arizona State University Hasbrouck Insect Collection (to be sorted out) to be removed when the taxon categories are checked and created. Is that ok for you? Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nOh I forgot, it will also take the delay to wait for white listing the domain. between 3 days and 3 weeks! Christian Ferrer (talk)\n\nThat would be great! Thanks! --Jonatan Svensson Glad (talk)"
