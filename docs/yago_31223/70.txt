Early life

Princess Victoria Adelaide was born on 31 December 1885 at Grünholz Manor, Schleswig-Holstein, Prussia as the eldest daughter of Frederick Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and his wife Princess Karoline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg. Her father was the eldest son of Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and a nephew of Christian IX of Denmark. One month before the birth of Victoria Adelaide, he had succeeded to the headship of the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and the title of duke upon the death of his father on 27 November 1885.

Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha

On 11 October 1905, at Glücksburg Castle, Schleswig, she married Charles Edward, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha. Charles Edward was born HRH Prince Charles Edward, Duke of Albany and was the only son of Prince Leopold, Duke of Albany by his wife Princess Helena of Waldeck and a grandson of Queen Victoria. Five years before the marriage, he had succeeded to the duchy of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha upon the death of his uncle Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha in 1900. Upon her marriage, Victoria Adelheid assumed the title of Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Sachsen-Coburg und Gotha. She and Charles Edward had five children.

Later life

In 1918, the Duke was forced to abdicate his ducal throne, following the end of World War I, forcing the family to become private citizens. After World War II, the couple fled to Austria (where Schloss Greinburg an der Donau had been a Saxe-Coburg property since 1822, and remains such) following the seizure of their properties in East Germany by the Soviet Union. However, the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography article on Prince Charles Edward states that he died in Coburg on 6 March 1954; no mention is made there of his wife. She died at Schloss Greinburg on 3 October 1970 and was buried beside her husband at Schloss Callenberg, Coburg, on 8 October of that year.
