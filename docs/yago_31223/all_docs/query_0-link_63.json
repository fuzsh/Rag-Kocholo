        "text": "Count Christian of Rosenborg, a first cousin of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, died in his sleep in the late hours of May 21st.\n\nThe 70-year-old Count, who was born a Prince of Denmark as the youngest son of Hereditary Prince Knud, passed away just before midnight at the Gentofte Hospital with his family by his side.\n\nHe had suffered from throat cancer for several years.\n\nPrince Christian of Denmark was born on October 22nd, 1942 at Sorgenfri Palace. His parents were Hereditary Prince Knud of Denmark (younger son of Christian X of Denmark and Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin) and Princess Caroline-Mathilde of Denmark (elder daughter of Harald of Denmark and Helena Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg); and he had two older siblings: Princess Elisabeth and Count Ingolf.\n\nCount Christian was third in line to the Danish throne following the death of his grandfather in 1947, behind his father and brother. However, the 1953 change to the constitution gave Christian’s cousins – Princesses Margrethe, Benedikte and Anne-Marie – precedence. In 1971, he married Anne Dorte Maltoft-Nielsen after renouncing his rights of succession (as was required at the time in Denmark if a royal married a commoner). He lost the title Prince of Denmark and was given the title Count of Rosenborg like his elder brother. Christian and Anne Dorte had three daughters: Countesses Josephine, Camilla and Feodora.\n\nCount Christian is survived by his wife, daughters and seven grandchildren. Details of his funeral have yet to be released."
