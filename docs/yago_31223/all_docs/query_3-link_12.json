        "text": "From the Emperor’s Desk: Yesterday I did a blog entry of Prince Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. I had done a blog entry of her sister Princess Alexandra Victoria a short while ago. Today I am doing an entry of their entire family.\n\nFriedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (12 October 12, 1855 – January 21, 1934), was born in Kiel, Duchy of Holstein, the eldest son of Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg and Princess Adelheid of Schaumburg-Lippe and a nephew of King Christian IX of Denmark.\n\nAlbert of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg (February 26, 1869 – April 27, 1931), was a grandson of Queen Victoria. He was the second son of Victoria’s daughter Princess Helena by her husband Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg.\n\nIn 1921, Prince Albert succeeded his childless cousin Duke Ernst Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg. This was the senior branch of the House of Oldenburg, to which the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, the Emperor of Russia, the King of Denmark, the King of Norway, the King of the Hellenes, the King of the United Kingdom and the Grand Duke of Oldenburg belonged.\n\nDuke Albert was succeeded by his distant cousin Friedrich Ferdinand, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (who happened to be also the husband of a daughter of Albert’s uncle Friedrich VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg).\n\nIssue\n\nMarriage and Issue\n\nFriedrich Ferdinand married Princess Caroline Mathilde of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, second daughter of Friedrich VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg and his wife Princess Adelheid of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, on March 19, 1885 at Primkenau. Princess Caroline Mathilde was the younger sister of Prince Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg the wife of German Emperor Wilhelm II.\n\nFriedrich Ferdinand and Caroline Mathilde had six children:\n\n1. Princess Victoria Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (December 31, 1885 – October 3, 1970) was the last Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha as the wife of Duke Charles Edward from their marriage on October 11, 1905 until his abdication on November 14, 1918. Victoria Adelaide is the maternal grandmother of Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden. She was a niece of German Empress Augusta Victoria.\n\n2. Princess Alexandra Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (April 21, 1887 – April 15, 1957) Alexandra Victoria’s first husband was her first cousin Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia, the son of Wilhelm II, German Emperor and his wife Augusta Victoria, a sister of Alexandra Victoria’s mother.\n\nThey married on October 22, 1908 (birthday of Empress Augusta Victoria) at the Royal Palace of Berlin. The marriage was arranged by the Emperor and Empress, but it was relatively happy.\n\n3. Princess Helena Adelaide of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (June 1, 1888 – June 30, 1962). She was a princess of Denmark through her marriage within the House of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg to her cousin Prince Harald of Denmark, the third son and fourth child of King Frederik VIII of Denmark and his wife, Lovisa of Sweden, and thus brother to King Christian X of Denmark and King Haakon VII of Norway.\n\nPrincess Helena was a Nazi sympathiser during World War II and was after the war exiled from Denmark, but eventually allowed to return, where she died.\n\n4. Princess Adelaide Louise of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (October 19, 1889 – June 11, 1964). She was the Princess of Solms-Baruth through her marriage to Friedrich III, Prince of Solms-Baruth.\n\nOn December 31, 1920, Hereditary Prince Friedrich’s father died, and Friedrich became head of the house of Solms-Baruth.\n\nPrince Friedrich III died on September 12, 1951 in Windhoek, Namibia. Princess Adelaide died on June 11, 1964 in Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria.\n\n5. Wilhelm Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg, from 1934 Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (August 23, 1891 – February 10, 1965), was the sixth Duke of Schleswig-Holstein and Head of the House of Oldenburg from January 21, 1934 until his death on February 10, 1965.\n\nWilhelm Friedrich married his second cousin, Princess Marie Melita of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, daughter of Ernst II, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg and his wife Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, on February 5, 1916 at Coburg. Friedrich and Marie Melita had four children."
