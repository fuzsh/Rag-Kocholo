Christian VII being an uncle to King Christian VIII of Denmark\n\nLuise was also a sister to King Frederik VI of Denmark (1768-1839) 36.1 Princess Karoline Amalie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1796 1881 King Christian VIII of Denmark 1786 1848 Christian VIII was firstly married to Duchess Charlotte Friederike of Mecklenburg-Schwerin (married 1806, divorced 1810) 36.2 Duke Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1798 1869 Countess Luisa-Sophie af Danneskiold-Samsoe 1796 1867 Christian was involved in the Schleswig-Holstein problemk. The Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein belonged personally to the King of Denmark. Schleswig was half German and half Danish whilst it's more southerly neighbour Holstein was almost all German. Different succession laws applied to Germany and Denmark, Germany followed Salic principle whilst Denmark allowed succession via the female line. It was likely that the male line of Denmark would become extinct and King Christian VIII declared in 1846 that the 1665 law which allowed succession through the female line applied to Schleswig and (with some reservation) to Holstein After various fighting between Denmark and Prussia (on behalf of the German Confederation) a London Treaty was signed in 1852 which accepted Denmark retaining control of Schleswig and Holstein with Duke Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg , who represented a collateral line, renouncing his claim to the duchies and accepting a money indemnity of 2,500,000 thalers.\n\nCountess Luisa-Sophie can trace her ancestry to King Christian V (1646-1699) of Denmark and Norway and his mistress Sophie Amelie Moth (1654-1719) who was created Countess of Samso on 31 December 1677.\n\nThe ancestry of Countess Luisa-Sophie can be found here.\n\nLuisa-Sophie was a sister to Countess Henriette af Danneskiold-Samsoe .\n\nA somewhat unusual newspaper article in 1846 reporting on the silver wedding anniversary (25 years) of Christian and Luisa-Sophie 36.21 Prince Alexander of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1821 1823 36.22 Princess Luise of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1823 1872 36.23 Princess Karoline Amalie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1826 1901 36.24 Princess Wilhelmine of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1828 1829 36.25 Duke Friedrich \"Fritz Holstein\" of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1829 1880 Princess Adelheid \"Ada\" of Hohenlohe-Langenburg 1835 1900 See 39.35 - Friedrich claimed on 15 November 1863 to succeed King Frederick VII of Denmark - as the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein (as Friedrich VIII). His pretensions were ended by the defeat of Denmark by Austria and Prussia in August 1864. Denmark was forced to surrender the two Duchies to joint occupation by Austria and Prussia. The Convention of Gastein in August 1865 divided the two Duchies, Holstein controlled by Austria and Schleswig by Prussia. Holstein was finally annexed by Prussia following the defeat of Austria in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866.\n\nFriedrich was supported in his pretensions by his friend Crown Prince Friedrich of Prussia (future King and Emperor Friedrich III \"Fritz\" of Prussia). The support by the Crown Prince was not shared by his father King Wilhelm I of Prussia or by the Prussian Minister President (or Prime Minister) Otto von Bismarck.\n\nObituary on Duchess Adelheid 36.251 Prince Friedrich of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1857 1858 36.252 Princess Auguste Viktoria \"Dona\" of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1858 1921 King Wilhelm II of Prussia 1858 1941 See 11.211 - Wilhelm (who was also German Emperor) abdicated on 28 November 1918 having fled to Holland on 10 November 1918.\n\nA long report on the wedding of Auguste Viktoria and Wilhelm.\n\nA touching article on Auguste Viktoria as \"A MODEL HOUSEWIFE\".\n\nI hadn't heard of this situation before I read this article . It purports to show that Wilhelm II marriage to Auguste Viktoria was morganatic in that her family Schleswig-Holstein were not previously reigning but merely owned its own territory in bygone times. This was a ruling from a Schleswig-Holstein lower court of law. 36.253 Princess Caroline Mathilde \"Calma\" of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1860 1932 Duke Friedrich Ferdinand of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg 1855 1934 See 35.42 - Friedrich became Duke of Schleswig-Holstein on 27 April 1931 following the extinction of the Augustenburg Branch on the death of Duke Albert of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 36.254 Prince Gerhard of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1862 1862 36.255 Duke Ernest-Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1863 1921 Princess Dorothea \"Dolly\" of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha 1881 1967 See 28.5212 - Ernest-Gunther was an unsavoury character, he was a hard drinking course mannered cavalry officer as well as a gambler and womaniser . Ernest-Gunther being childless adopted his distant cousin Prince Johann Georg of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg (who was killed in action in Russia) and Princess Marie Luise of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg.\n\nAnnouncement of the wedding of Ernest-Gunther and Dorothea.\n\nThere appeared to be consternation in Belgium and also by the Pope regarding the marriage of Ernest-Gunther and Dorothea. Dorothea being a Roman Catholic and Ernest-Gunther a Lutheran no promises were made at the religious wedding as to the children of the marriage being brought up in the Catholic faith.\n\nAn interesting article from the Advertiser (Adelaide, SA : 1889 - 1931) in which it was alleged that Ernest-Gunther was responsible for the kidnap of Fraulein Milevsky in Cairo, Egypt. Fraulein Milevsky was a companion to Ernest-Gunther's aunt Princess Karoline Amalie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg\n\nA somewhat different version of the circumstances relating to the kidnapping appeared in The New York Times. 36.256 Princess Luise Sophie of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1866 1952 Prince Friedrich Leopold of Prussia 1865 1931 See 11.515 - An unusual event in 1908 when Friedrich Leopold his wife Luise Sophie and their daughter Viktoria Margarete were poisoned after eating contaminated meat. 36.257 Princess Feodore of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1874 1910 36.26 Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1831 1917 Princess Helena Augusta Victoria \"Lenchen\" of Great Britain 1846 1923 See 1.5 - Christian lost an eye when he was accidentally shot in the face by his brother-in law the Duke of Connaught during a during a shooting party on Boxing Day 1891.\n\nThe shooting party comprised Prince Christian , his son Prince Albert and his two brother-in-laws the Duke of Connaught and Prince Henry of Battenberg\n\nNew York Times report on the death of Prince Christian.\n\nA report on the death of Princess Helen and the arrangements for four weeks of court mourning.\n\nWell, well this is a turn up for the books, an article in 1889 reports that Prince Christian had a morganatic wife at the time of his marriage to Princess Helen.\n\nDeath registration of Prince Christian.\n\nBirth registration of Princess Helena\n\nDeath registration of Princess Helena. 36.261 - QVD Prince Christian Victor of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1867 1900 Prince Christian died of enteric fever while serving with the British Army in the Boar War.\n\nDetails of the Court mourning for Prince Christian.\n\nBirth registration of Prince Christian 36.262 - QVD Duke Albert of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1869 1931 The death of Albert brought an end to the Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg branch.\n\nBirth registration of Prince Albert 36.2621 - QVD Valerie zu Schleswig-Holstein 1900 1953 Ernst Johann Wagner 1896 Valerie's father was Duke Albert of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, name of mother not known. Albert's sisters Helena Victoria and Marie Louise provided a signed statement that Valerie's mother was of high standing. Valerie committed suicide. 36.2621 - QVD Valerie zu Schleswig-Holstein 1900 1953 Duke Engelbert-Charles of Arenberg (10 th Duke of Arenberg) 1899 1974 Valerie's father was Duke Albert of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg, name of mother not known. Albert's sisters Helena Victoria and Marie Louise provided a signed statement that Valerie's mother was of high standing. Valerie committed suicide. Engelbert-Charles was succeeded by his brother Eric Engelbert (11 th Duke of Arenberg) as Duke of Arenberg.\n\nIt was reported in 1945 that Valerie (as Princess of Arenberg) objected to her and her husband being requested to give up their 300 roomed palace to the American army.\n\nEngelbert-Charles's uncle Prince Charles-Prosper of Arenberg (1875-1948) made newspaper headlines in 1900 when he was found guilty of the brutal murder of his servant. Charles-Prosper was acquitted of the murder in 1904 on the grounds of insanity. 36.263 - QVD Princess Helena Victoria \"Thora\" of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1870 1948 Princess Helena relinquished her German title in 1917 and was granted a British title of Princess Helena Victoria.\n\nBirth Registration of Princess Helena Victoria\n\nDeath Registration of Princess Helena Victoria 36.264 - QVD Princess Marie Louise of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1872 1956 Prince Aribert of Anhalt 1864 1933 See 24.7335 - Marie Louise relinquished her German title in 1917 and was granted a British title of Princess Marie Louise.\n\nThe Queen gave consent to the proposed marriage of Princess Marie Louise and Prince Aribert at the Privy Council Meeting on 03 July 1891.\n\nThe announcement in the London Gazette on the ceremonial observed at the marriage of Princess Marie Louise and Prince Aribert.\n\nReport on the marriage of Princess Marie to Prince Aribert.\n\nThe marriage of Princess Marie Louise to Prince Aribert was declared \"null and void\" by his father on the pretext that Princess Marie Louise had deserted her husband, however in reality it was because Prince Aribert had been caught with another man.\n\nThe New York Time reported at the time the couple had agreed a Judicial separation rather than a divorce.\n\nAn interesting announcement in the London Gazette regarding Princess Marie Louise with the consent of her cousin Duke Ernest-Gunther of Schleswig-Holstein as head of her family exercising her right to resume her family name following her divorce from Prince Aribert.\n\nBirth registration of Princess Marie Louise\n\nDeath registration of Princess Marie Louise 36.265 - QVD Prince Prince Frederick Cristian \"Harald\" of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1876 1876 Birth Registration of Prince Frederick Christian \"Harald\"\n\nDeath Registration of Prince Frederick Christian \"Harald\" 36.266 - QVD Stillborn Son (son of Princess Helena Augusta Victoria of Great Britain and Prince Christian of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg) 1877 1877 36.27 Princess Henriette of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1833 1917 Johann Friedrich von Esmarch 1823 1908 A very interesting article on Johann Friedrich von Esmarch.\n\nExtract from \"The Iowa Orthopaedic Journal\" Volume 8 on Johann Friedrich von Esmarch 36.3 Prince Friedrich Emil of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1800 1865 Countess Henriette af Danneskiold-Samsoe 1806 1858 Henriette was a sister to Countess Luisa-Sophie af Danneskiold-Samsoe.\n\nAn interesting report by Stig on the Nobiliana Forum relating to the burial sites of the \"Noer\" family. 36.3 Prince Friedrich Emil of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Augustenburg 1800 1865 Mary Esther Lee 1837 1914 Friedrich Emil was created Prince von Noer on 06 October 1864 by Emperor Franz Joseph of Austria.\n\nFriedrich Emil died on 2 July 1865 just seven months after his marriage to Mary Lee. It was reported that during their long honeymoon trip Friedrich Emil was so infatuated with his new wife that he bequeathed all his large fortune to her only for him to die shortly after. Mary subsequently married Count Alfred von Waldersee (1832-1904) in 1874 who rose to the rank of Field Marshall in the German military.\n\nReport on the death of Mary Lee.\n\nMary Lee left $750,000 in her will which mostly went to relatives of her second husband Count von Waldersee\n\nFriedrich Emil died in Beirut and his remains were brought back to Krusendorf (in Schleswig) for burial in the family vault.
