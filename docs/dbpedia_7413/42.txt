Tommy Tutone is an American power pop band, known for its 1981 hit "867-5309/Jenny", which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Though some people consider the band to be a one-hit wonder, they did reach the Top 40 the year before with "Angel Say No".

The band's lead singer, rhythm guitarist, and occasional keyboardist is Thomas Allen Heath, who was born in 1947 and is also known as Tommy Heath. He is the only active original member currently touring as Tonmy Tutone. Heath grew up in Philadelphia, Texas, and Montana before moving to San Francisco during the Summer of Love to become a hippie. There, he formed the band with Jim Keller and Terry Nails in 1978, naming it after his nickname. The band's first single, "Angel Say No", was released in 1980 and reached the top 40, and they even opened for Tom Petty on his US tour for Damn the Torpedoes.

The band's second album, Tommy Tutone 2, was released in 1981 and featured "867-5309/Jenny". The song became so popular that people in the United States still prank call the number and ask for Jenny today. In 2006, VH1 named it the 36th-greatest song of the 1980s.

As of January 2024, Heath is living in Portland, Oregon, and back touring as Tommy Tutone. A new studio album is set to release the fall of 2024.

Tommy Heath and Jim Keller founded the band in 1978 along with bassist Terry Nails (Steve Jones, Ozzy Osbourne), with Heath acting as the lead vocalist and rhythm guitarist, also playing keyboards on occasion. Keller played lead guitar and Terry Nails played bass and provided supporting vocals. Heath and Keller were the only constant members of Tommy Tutone during the band's heyday, and the lineup featured a rotating membership of bassists and drummers. Bassist Jon Lyons (original name Jonathan Lyons Terlep), who performed on "867-5309", replaced founding member Terry Nails, but was soon himself replaced by Greg Sutton, Pete Costello, and in 1988 Jimmy James. Mona Gnader, the bassist in Sammy Hagar's The Waboritas band, played with the band as well. Original drummer Kenny Johnson (of Chris Isaak's band) was replaced by Mickey Shine (Clover and the first Elvis Costello album), then Victor Carberry for the band's second album, and later Jerry Angel. John Cowsill of The Cowsills played percussion (and sang) on "867-5309/Jenny".[1] From 2001 to 2010, the band consisted of Heath, Jimmy James, Greg Georgeson (guitar), and Andy Gauthier (drums). By 2012, Tommy Heath had become a computer analyst and software engineer and moved to Portland, Oregon.[2][3] In 2007, the band signed a recording contract with Spectra Records.

In 2017, with the addition of Steve Fister (Steppenwolf, Lita Ford) on guitar, Jimmy James switched to drums and the band released the single "My Little Red Book".

Jim Keller went on to become the director of Philip Glass's publishing company, Dunvagen Music Publishers.[4] He still performs in New York City.

In 2019, the band released their first studio album since 1998, Beautiful Ending.

in 2024, the band is reunited and touring. A new studio album will be released in the fall entitled “New Wave Americana”.
