Either way, we thought the song was one big gay joke.\n\n\"867-5309 (Jenny)\"\n\nThe Funny Lyrics:\n\nI got it (I got it)\n\nI got your number on the wall\n\nI got it (I got it)\n\nFor a good time, for a good time call!\n\nWhy They're Funny:\n\nThe whole song, as far as I gather, is about how he saw a message on a restroom wall saying 'For a good time call Jenny at 867-5309' and decided to make her his girlfriend. I needn't explain any further why that's funny.\n\nSubmitted by: Princess Ana\n\n\"867-5309 (Jenny)\"\n\nThe Nonsensical Lyrics:\n\nJenny, Jenny, You're the girl for me.\n\nYou don't know me, but you make so happy.\n\nWhy They're Nonsensical:\n\nSince Jenny doesn't know the narrator (and vice versa), then how does he know what she's thinking about him? How can she compare him with other losers if the two have never met?\n\nSubmitted by: Khalil"
