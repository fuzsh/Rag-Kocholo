        "text": "Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental mechanism for the transport of mass and energy in planetary magnetospheres and astrospheres. While the process of reconnection is itself ubiquitous across a multitude of systems, the techniques used for its analysis can vary across scientific disciplines. Here we frame the latest understanding of reconnection theory by missions such as NASA’s Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission for use throughout the solar system and beyond. We discuss how reconnection can couple magnetized obstacles to both sub- and super-magnetosonic upstream flows. In addition, we address the need to model sheath plasmas and field-line draping around an obstacle to accurately parameterize the possibility for reconnection to occur. We conclude with a discussion of how reconnection energy conversion rates scale throughout the solar system. The results presented are not only applicable to within our solar system but also to astrospheres and exoplanets, such as the first recently detected exoplanet magnetosphere of HAT-11-1b.\n\nThe waves generated by high-energy proton and alpha particles streaming from solar flares into regions of colder plasma are explored using particle-in-cell simulations. Initial distribution functions for the protons and alphas consist of two populations: an energetic, streaming population represented by an anisotropic (T∥ > T⊥), one-sided kappa function and a cold, Maxwellian background population. The anisotropies and nonzero heat fluxes of these distributions destabilize oblique waves with a range of frequencies below the proton cyclotron frequency. These waves scatter particles out of the tails of the initial distributions along constant-energy surfaces in the wave frame. Overlap of the nonlinear resonance widths allows particles to scatter into near-isotropic distributions by the end of the simulations. The dynamics of 3He are explored using test particles. Their temperatures can increase by a factor of nearly 20. Propagation of such waves into regions above and below the flare site can lead to heating and transport of 3He into the flare acceleration region. The amount of heated 3He that will be driven into the flare site is proportional to the wave energy. Using values from our simulations, we show that the abundance of 3He driven into the acceleration region should approach that of 4He in the corona. Therefore, waves driven by energetic ions produced in flares are a strong candidate to drive the enhancements of 3He observed in impulsive flares.\n\nThe field of nanoscale magnetic resonance imaging (NanoMRI) was started 30 years ago. It was motivated by the desire to image single molecules and molecular assemblies, such as proteins and virus particles, with near-atomic spatial resolution and on a length scale of 100 nm. Over the years, the NanoMRI field has also expanded to include the goal of useful high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of molecules under ambient conditions, including samples up to the micron-scale. The realization of these goals requires the development of spin detection techniques that are many orders of magnitude more sensitive than conventional NMR and MRI, capable of detecting and controlling nanoscale ensembles of spins. Over the years, a number of different technical approaches to NanoMRI have emerged, each possessing a distinct set of capabilities for basic and applied areas of science. The goal of this roadmap article is to report the current state of the art in NanoMRI technologies, outline the areas where they are poised to have impact, identify the challenges that lie ahead, and propose methods to meet these challenges. This roadmap also shows how developments in NanoMRI techniques can lead to breakthroughs in emerging quantum science and technology applications.\n\nWide-field imaging of magnetic signals using ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has garnered increasing interest due to its combination of micron-scale resolution, millimeter-scale field of view, and compatibility with diverse samples from across the physical and life sciences. Recently, wide-field NV magnetic imaging based on the Ramsey protocol has achieved uniform and enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional measurements. Here, we integrate the Ramsey-based protocol with spin-bath driving to extend the NV spin dephasing time and improve magnetic sensitivity. We also employ a high-speed camera to enable dynamic wide-field magnetic imaging. We benchmark the utility of this quantum diamond microscope (QDM) by imaging magnetic fields produced from a fabricated wire phantom. Over a 270 × 270 μm2 field of view, a median per-pixel magnetic sensitivity of 4.1(1) nT /Hz is realized with a spatial resolution ≲ 10 μm and sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Importantly, the spatial magnetic noise floor can be reduced to the picotesla scale by time-averaging and signal modulation, which enables imaging of a magnetic-field pattern with a peak-to-peak amplitude difference of about 300 pT. Finally, we discuss potential new applications of this dynamic QDM in studying biomineralization and electrically active cells.\n\nRecent work has shown that machine learning (ML) models can skillfully forecast the dynamics of unknown chaotic systems. Short-term predictions of the state evolution and long-term predictions of the statistical patterns of the dynamics (“climate”) can be produced by employing a feedback loop, whereby the model is trained to predict forward only one time step, then the model output is used as input for multiple time steps. In the absence of mitigating techniques, however, this feedback can result in artificially rapid error growth (“instability”). One established mitigating technique is to add noise to the ML model training input. Based on this technique, we formulate a new penalty term in the loss function for ML models with memory of past inputs that deterministically approximates the effect of many small, independent noise realizations added to the model input during training. We refer to this penalty and the resulting regularization as Linearized Multi-Noise Training (LMNT). We systematically examine the effect of LMNT, input noise, and other established regularization techniques in a case study using reservoir computing, a machine learning method using recurrent neural networks, to predict the spatiotemporal chaotic Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation. We find that reservoir computers trained with noise or with LMNT produce climate predictions that appear to be indefinitely stable and have a climate very similar to the true system, while the short-term forecasts are substantially more accurate than those trained with other regularization techniques. Finally, we show the deterministic aspect of our LMNT regularization facilitates fast reservoir computer regularization hyperparameter tuning.\n\nA large number of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equilibrium calculations are often required for uncertainty quantification, optimization, and real-time diagnostic information, making MHD equilibrium codes vital to the field of plasma physics. In this paper, we explore a method for solving the Grad–Shafranov equation by using physics-informed neural networks (PINNs). For PINNs, we optimize neural networks by directly minimizing the residual of the partial differential equation as a loss function. We show that PINNs can accurately and effectively solve the Grad–Shafranov equation with several different boundary conditions, making it more flexible than traditional solvers. This method is flexible as it does not require any mesh and basis choice, thereby streamlining the computational process. We also explore the parameter space by varying the size of the model, the learning rate, and boundary conditions to map various tradeoffs such as between reconstruction error and computational speed. Additionally, we introduce a parameterized PINN framework, expanding the input space to include variables such as pressure, aspect ratio, elongation, and triangularity in order to handle a broader range of plasma scenarios within a single network. Parameterized PINNs could be used in future work to solve inverse problems such as shape optimization.\n\nThe centrifugal mirror confinement scheme incorporates supersonic rotation of a plasma into a magnetic mirror device. This concept has been shown experimentally to drastically decrease parallel losses and increase plasma stability as compared with prior axisymmetric mirrors. MCTrans++ is a dimensionless (0-D) scoping tool which rapidly models experimental operating points in the Centrifugal Mirror Fusion Experiment (CMFX) at the University of Maryland. In the low-collisionality regime, parallel losses can be modelled analytically. A confining potential is set up that is partially ambipolar and partially centrifugal. Due to the stabilizing effects of flow shear, the perpendicular losses can be modelled as classical. Radiation losses such as bremsstrahlung and cyclotron emission are taken into account. A neutrals model is included, and, in some circumstances, charge-exchange losses are found to exceed all other loss mechanisms. We use the SUNDIALS ARKODE library to solve the underlying equations of this model; the resulting software is suitable for scanning large parameter spaces, and can also be used to model time-dependent phenomena such as a capacitive discharge. MCTrans++ has been used to verify results from prior centrifugal mirrors, create an experimental plan for CMFX and find configurations for future reactor-scale fusion devices.\n\nParker Solar Probe observations are analyzed for the presence of reconnection exhausts across current sheets (CSs) within R < 0.26 au during encounters 4–11. Exhausts are observed with nearly equal probability at all radial distances with a preference for quiescent Tp < 0.80 MK plasmas typical of a slow-wind regime. High Tp > 0.80 MK plasmas of a fast wind characterized by significant transverse fluctuations rarely support exhausts irrespective of the CS width. Exhaust observations demonstrate the presence of local temperature gradients across several CSs with a higher-Tp plasma on locally closed fields and a lower-Tp plasma on locally open field lines for an interchange-type reconnection. A CS geometry analysis directly supports the property that X-lines bisect the magnetic field rotation θ-angle, whether the fields and plasmas are asymmetric or not, to maximize reconnection rates and available magnetic energy. The CS normal width dcs distributions suggest that a multiscale reconnection process through nested layers of bifurcated CSs may be responsible for observed power-law distributions beyond the median dcs ∼ 1000 km with an exponential dcs distribution present for ion kinetic dissipation scales below this median. Magnetic field shear θ-angles are essentially identical at R < 0.26 and 1 au with medians at θ ∼ 55° near the Sun and θ ∼ 65° at 1 au. In contrast, the tangential flow shear distributions are different near and far from the Sun. A bimodal flow shear angle distribution is present near the Sun with strong shear flow magnitudes. This distribution is modified with radial distance toward a relatively flat distribution of weaker flow shear magnitudes.\n\nWe show that the deposition of the solid-state electrolyte LiPON onto films of V2O5 leads to their uniform lithiation of up to 2.2 Li per V2O5, without affecting the Li concentration in the LiPON and its ionic conductivity. Our results indicate that Li incorporation occurs during LiPON deposition, in contrast to earlier mechanisms proposed to explain postdeposition Li transfer between LiPON and LiCoO2. We use our discovery to demonstrate symmetric thin film batteries with a capacity of >270 mAh/g, at a rate of 20C, and 1600 cycles with only 8.4% loss in capacity. We also show how autolithiation can simplify fabrication of Li iontronic transistors attractive for emerging neuromorphic computing applications. Our discovery that LiPON deposition results in autolithiation of the underlying insertion oxide has the potential to substantially simplify and enhance the fabrication process for thin film solid state Li ion batteries and emerging lithium iontronic neuromorphic computing devices.\n\nNanostructured manganese oxides (MnOx) have shown incredible promise in constructing next-generation energy storage and catalytic systems. However, it has proven challenging to integrate with other low-dimensional materials due to harsh deposition conditions and poor structural stability. Here, we report the deposition of layered manganese dioxide (δ-MnO2) on bilayer epitaxial graphene (QEG) using a simple three-step electrochemical process involving no harsh chemicals. Using this process we can synthesize a 50 nm thick H–MnO2 film in 1.25s. This synthetic birnessite is inherently water-stabilized, the first reported in the literature. We also confirm that this process does not cause structural damage to the QEG, as evidenced by the lack of D peak formation. This QEG heterostructure enhanced MnO2's redox active gas sensing, enabling room temperature detection of NH3 and NO2. We also report on transforming this δ-MnO2 to other MnOx compounds, Mn2O3 and Mn3O4, via mild annealing. This is confirmed by Raman spectroscopy of the films, which also confirms limited damage to the QEG substrate. To our knowledge, this is the first synthesis of Mn2O3 and Mn3O4 on pristine graphene substrates. Both methods demonstrate the potential of depositing and transforming multifunctional oxides on single-crystal graphene using QEG substrates, allowing for the formation of nanostructured heterostructures previously unseen. Additionally, the electrochemical nature of the deposition presents the ability to scale the process to the QEG wafer and adjust the solution to produce other powerful multifunctional oxides.\n\nElectromagnetic fundamental and harmonic emission is ubiquitously observed throughout the heliosphere, and in particular it is commonly associated with the occurrence of type II and III solar radio bursts. Classical analytic calculations for the plasma-emission process, though useful, are limited to idealized situations; a conclusive numerical verification of this theory is still lacking, with earlier studies often providing contradicting results on e.g. the precise parameter space in which fundamental and harmonic emission can be produced. To accurately capture the chain of mechanisms underlying plasma emission – from precursor plasma processes to the generation of electromagnetic waves over long times – we perform large scale, first-principles simulations of beam–plasma instabilities. By employing a very large number of computational particles we achieve very low numerical noise, and explore (with an array of simulations) a wide parameter space determined by the beam–plasma density ratio and the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. In particular, we observe direct evidence of both fundamental and harmonic plasma emission when the beam-to-background density ratio ≤0.005 (with beam-to-background energy ratio ∼0.5), tightly constraining this threshold. We observe that, asymptotically, in this regime ∼0.1 per cent of the initial beam energy is converted into harmonic emission, and ∼0.001 per cent into fundamental emission. In contrast with previous studies, we also find that this emission is independent of the ion-to-electron temperature ratio. In addition, we report the direct detection of third-harmonic emission in all of our simulations, at power levels compatible with observations. Our findings have important consequences for understanding the viable conditions leading to plasma emission in space systems, and for the interpretation of observed electromagnetic signals throughout the heliosphere.\n\nTelecom C-band single photons exhibit the lowest attenuation in optical fibers, enabling long-haul, quantum-secured communication. However, efficient coupling with optical fibers is crucial for these single photons to be effective carriers in long-distance transmission. We demonstrate an efficient fiber-coupled single photon source in the telecom C-band using InAs/InP quantum dots coupled to a tapered nanobeam. The tapered nanobeam structure facilitates directional emission that is mode-matched to a lensed fiber, resulting in a collection efficiency of up to 65% from the nanobeam to the single-mode fiber. Using this approach, we demonstrate single photon count rates of 575 ± 5 Kcps and a single photon purity of g(2) (0) = 0.015 ± 0.003. Additionally, we demonstrate Hong–Ou–Mandel interference from the emitted photons with a visibility of 0.84 ± 0.06. From these measurements, we determine a photon coherence time of 450 ± 20 ps, a factor of only 8.3 away from the lifetime limit. This work represents an important step toward the development of telecom C-band single-photon sources emitting bright, pure, and indistinguishable photons, which are necessary to realize fiber-based long-distance quantum networks.\n\nWe apply a continuation method to recently optimized stellarator equilibria with excellent quasi-axisymmetry (QA) to generate new equilibria with a wide range of rotational transform profiles. Using these equilibria, we investigate how the rotational transform affects fast-particle confinement, the maximum coil-plasma distance, the maximum growth rate in linear gyrokinetic ion-temperature gradient (ITG) simulations, and the ion heat flux in corresponding nonlinear simulations. We find values of two-term quasisymmetry error comparable to or lower than the similar Landreman-Paul (Phys. Rev. Lett. 128, 035001) configuration for values of the mean rotational transform τ between 0.12 and 0.75. The fast-particle confinement improves with τ until τ=0.73, at which point the degradation in quasisymmetry outweighs the benefits of further increasing τ. The required coil-plasma distance only varies by about ±10% for the configurations under consideration, and is between 2.8m to 3.3m when the configuration is scaled up to reactor size. The maximum growth rate from linear gyrokinetic simulations increases with τ, but also shifts towards higher ky values. The maximum linear growth rate is sensitive to the choice of flux tube at rational τ, but this can be compensated for by taking the maximum over several flux tubes. The corresponding ion heat fluxes from nonlinear simulations display a non-monotonic relation to τ. Sufficiently large positive shear is destabilizing. This is reflected both in linear growth rates and nonlinear heat fluxes.\n\nOptoelectronic oscillators are nonlinear time-delayed microwave photonic systems capable of producing exceptionally pure microwave signals. In order to improve the spectral purity of the generated microwaves, it is important to investigate the origin and magnitude of the noise that drive the oscillator away from optimal operation. This task appears to be challenging above threshold because some of the noise sources are nonlinearly mixed with the signal, and it is very difficult to disambiguate them. In this study, we take advantage from the fact that the signal is expected to be null under the threshold, so that any detected oscillation in the sub-threshold range is solely the result of the noise fluctuations that we need to characterize. We develop the theoretical framework for this approach and obtain a set of stochastic differential equations, allowing us to characterize these noise sources that can thereby be lumped as additive and multiplicative fluctuation terms. We perform experimental measurements that confirm the validity of this approach and offer a generic pathway for the characterization of noise in certain classes of oscillators.\n\nFilament-based coil optimizations are performed for several quasi-helical stellarator configurations, beginning with the one from Landreman & Paul (Phys. Rev. Lett., vol. 128, 2022, 035001), demonstrating that precise quasi-helical symmetry can be achieved with realistic coils. Several constraints are placed on the shape and spacing of the coils, such as low curvature and sufficient plasma–coil distance for neutron shielding. The coils resulting from this optimization have a maximum curvature 0.8 times that of the coils of the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) and a mean squared curvature 0.4 times that of the HSX coils when scaled to the same plasma minor radius. When scaled up to reactor size and magnetic field strength, no fast particle losses were found in the free-boundary configuration when simulating 5000 alpha particles launched at 3.5MeV on the flux surface with a normalized toroidal flux of s=0.5. An analysis of the tolerance of the coils to manufacturing errors is performed using a Gaussian process model, and the coils are found to maintain low particle losses for smooth, large-scale errors up to amplitudes of approximately 0.15m. Another coil optimization is performed for the Landreman–Paul configuration with the additional constraint that the coils are purely planar. Visual inspection of the Poincaré plot of the resulting magnetic field-lines reveal that the planar modular coils alone do a poor job of reproducing the target equilibrium. Additional non-planar coil optimizations are performed for the quasi-helical configuration with 5% volume-averaged plasma beta from Landreman et al. (Phys. Plasma, vol. 29, issue 8, 2022, 082501), and a similar configuration also optimized to satisfy the Mercier criterion. The finite beta configurations had larger fast-particle losses, with the free-boundary Mercier-optimized configuration performing the worst, losing approximately 5.5% of alpha particles launched at s=0.5.\n\nWe study the problem of measuring errors in non-trace-preserving quantum operations, with a focus on their impact on quantum computing. We propose an error metric that efficiently provides an upper bound on the trace distance between the normalized output states from imperfect and ideal operations, while remaining compatible with the diamond distance. As a demonstration of its application, we apply our metric in the analysis of a lossy beam splitter and a nondeterministic conditional sign-flip gate, two primary non-trace-preserving operations in the Knill-Laflamme-Milburn protocol. We then turn to the leakage errors of neutral-atom quantum computers, finding that these errors scale worse than previously anticipated, implying a more stringent fault-tolerant threshold. We also assess the quantum Zeno gate's error using our metric. In a broader context, we discuss the potential of our metric to analyze general postselected protocols, where it can be employed to study error propagation and estimate thresholds in fault-tolerant quantum computing. The results highlight the critical role of our proposed error metric in understanding and addressing challenges in practical quantum information processing.\n\nWe investigate the detailed properties of electron inflow in an electron-only reconnection event observed by the four Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) spacecraft in the Earth's turbulent magnetosheath downstream of the quasi-parallel bow shock. The lack of ion coupling was attributed to the small-scale sizes of the current sheets, and the observed bidirectional super-Alfvénic electron jets indicate that the MMS spacecraft crossed the reconnecting current sheet on both sides of an active X-line. Remarkably, the MMS spacecraft observed the presence of large asymmetries in the two electron inflows, with the inflows (normal to the current sheet) on the two sides of the reconnecting current layer differing by as much as a factor of four. Furthermore, even though the four MMS spacecraft were separated by less than seven electron skin depths, the degree of inflow asymmetry was significantly different at the different spacecraft. The asymmetry in the inflow speeds was larger with increasing distances downstream from the reconnection site, and the asymmetry was opposite on the two sides of the X-line. We compare the MMS observations with a 2D kinetic particle-in-cell (PIC) simulation and find that the asymmetry in the inflow speeds stems from in-plane currents generated via the combination of reconnection-mediated inflows and parallel flows along the magnetic separatrices in the presence of a large guide field.\n\nFor designing high-field electromagnets, the Lorentz force on coils must be computed to ensure a support structure is feasible, and the inductance should be computed to evaluate the stored energy. Also, the magnetic field and its variation inside the conductor is of interest for computing stress and strain, and due to superconducting quench limits. For these force, inductance, energy, and internal field calculations, the coils cannot be naively approximated as infinitesimally thin filaments due to divergences when the source and evaluation points coincide, so more computationally demanding calculations are usually required, resolving the finite cross-section of the conductors. Here, we present a new alternative method that enables the internal magnetic field vector, self-force, and self-inductance to be computed rapidly and accurately within a 1D filament model. The method is applicable to coils for which the curve center-line can have general noncircular shape, as long as the conductor width is small compared to the radius of curvature. This paper extends a previous calculation for circular-cross-section conductors [Hurwitz et al, arXiv:2310.09313 (2023)] to consider the case of rectangular cross-section. The reduced model is derived by rigorous analysis of the singularity, regularizing the filament integrals such that they match the true high-dimensional integrals at high coil aspect ratio. The new filament model exactly recovers analytic results for a circular coil, and is shown to accurately reproduce full finite-cross-section calculations for a non-planar coil of a stellarator magnetic fusion device. Due to the efficiency of the model here, it is well suited for use inside design optimization.\n\nLow-collisionality plasma in a magnetic field generically develops anisotropy in its distribution function with respect to the magnetic field direction. Motivated by the application to radiation from accretion flows and jets, we explore the effect of temperature anisotropy on synchrotron emission. We derive analytically and provide numerical fits for the polarized synchrotron emission and absorption coefficients for a relativistic bi-Maxwellian plasma (we do not consider Faraday conversion/rotation). Temperature anisotropy can significantly change how the synchrotron emission and absorption coefficients depend on observing angle with respect to the magnetic field. The emitted linear polarization fraction does not depend strongly on anisotropy, while the emitted circular polarization does. We apply our results to black hole imaging of Sgr A* and M87* by ray tracing a GRMHD simulation and assuming that the plasma temperature anisotropy is set by the thresholds of kinetic-scale anisotropydriven instabilities. We find that the azimuthal asymmetry of the 230 GHz images can change by up to a factor of 3, accentuating (T⊥ > T∥) or counteracting (T⊥ < T∥) the image asymmetry produced by Doppler beaming. This can change the physical inferences from observations relative to models with an isotropic distribution function, e.g., by allowing for larger inclination between the line of sight and spin direction in Sgr A* . The observed image diameter and the size of the black hole shadow can also vary significantly due to plasma temperature anisotropy. We describe how the anisotropy of the plasma can affect future multifrequency and photon ring observations. We also calculate kinetic anisotropy-driven instabilities (mirror, whistler, and firehose) for relativistically hot plasmas.\n\nTo reduce incidences of in-stent restenosis and thrombosis, the use of a thinner-strut stent has been clinically proven to be effective. Therefore, the contemporary trend is toward the use of ultrathin-strut (≤70 µm) designs for durable stents. However, stents made from biodegradable platforms have failed to achieve intergenerational breakthroughs due to their excessively thick struts. Here, microalloying is used to create an ultrathin-strut (65 µm) zinc (Zn) scaffold with modified biodegradation behavior and improved biofunction, by adding lithium (Li). The scaffold backbone consists of an ultrafine-grained Zn matrix (average grain diameter 2.28 µm) with uniformly distributed nanoscale Li-containing phases. Grain refinement and precipitation strengthening enable it to achieve twice the radial strength with only 40% of the strut thickness of the pure Zn scaffold. Adding Li alters the thermodynamic formation pathways of products during scaffold biodegradation, creating an alkaline microenvironment. Li2CO3 may actively stabilize this microenvironment due to its higher solubility and better buffering capability than Zn products. The co-release of ionic zinc and lithium enhances the beneficial differential effects on activities of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, resulting in good endothelialization and limited intimal hyperplasia in porcine coronary arteries. The findings here may break the predicament of the next-generation biodegradable scaffolds.\n\nThe nature of cosmic ray (CR) transport in the Milky Way remains elusive. The predictions of current microphysical CR transport models in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence are drastically different from what is observed. These models usually focus on MHD turbulence with a strong guide field and ignore the impact of turbulent intermittency on particle propagation. This motivates our studying the alternative regime of large-amplitude turbulence with δB/B0 ≫ 1, in which intermittent small-scale magnetic field reversals are ubiquitous. We study particle transport in such turbulence by integrating trajectories in stationary snapshots. To quantify spatial diffusion, we use a set-up with continuous particle injection and escape, which we term the turbulent leaky box. We find that particle transport is very different from the strong guide-field case. Low-energy particles are better confined than high-energy particles, despite less efficient pitch-angle isotropization at small energies. In the limit of weak guide field, energy-dependent confinement is driven by the energy-dependent (in)ability to follow reversing magnetic field lines exactly and by the scattering in regions of ‘resonant curvature’, where the field line bends on a scale that is of the order of the local particle gyro-radius. We derive a heuristic model of particle transport in magnetic folds that approximately reproduces the energy dependence of transport found numerically. We speculate that CR propagation in the Galaxy is regulated by the intermittent field reversals highlighted here and discuss the implications of our findings for CR transport in the Milky Way.\n\nFilament-based coil optimizations are performed for several quasihelical stellarator configurations, notably the one from [M. Landreman, E. Paul, PRL 128, 035001, 2022], demonstrating that precise quasihelical symmetry can be achieved with realistic coils. Several constraints are placed on the shape and spacing of the coils, such as low curvature and sufficient plasma-coil distance for neutron shielding. The coils resulting from this optimization have a maximum curvature 0.8 times that of the coils of the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX) and a mean squared curvature 0.4 times that of the HSX coils when scaled to the same plasma minor radius. When scaled up to reactor size and magnetic field strength, no fast particle losses were found in the free-boundary configuration when simulating 5000 alpha particles launched at 3.5 MeV on the flux surface with normalized toroidal flux of s=0.5. An analysis of the tolerance of the coils to manufacturing errors is performed using a Gaussian process model, and the coils are found to maintain low particle losses for smooth, large-scale errors up to amplitudes of about 0.15 m. Another coil optimization is performed for the Landreman-Paul configuration with the additional constraint that the coils are purely planar. Visual inspection of the Poincaré plot of the resulting magnetic field-lines reveal that the planar modular coils alone do a poor job of reproducing the target equilibrium. Additional non-planar coil optimizations are performed for the quasihelical configuration with 5% volume-averaged plasma beta from [M. Landreman, S. Buller, M. Drevlak, PoP 29, 082501, 2022], and a similar configuration also optimized to satisfy the Mercier criterion. The finite beta configurations had larger fast-particle losses, with the free-boundary Mercier-optimized configuration performing the worst, losing about 5.5% of alpha particles launched at s=0.5.\n\nThe scalloping of oxide-nitride-oxide (ONO) stacked layers on vertical sidewalls during high-aspect-ratio contact etch is commonly seen and characterized by the horizontal etching of oxide and nitride layers at different etch rates. To understand the mechanisms of ONO scalloping in complex plasma chemistry, it is crucial to examine the surface chemistry of silicon dioxide and silicon nitride processed with single fluorocarbon (FC) or hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) gases. To simulate the isotropic etching of SiO2 and Si3N4 sidewalls, we use a horizontal trench structure to study the effect of neutral radicals produced by FC (Ar/C4F8), HFC (Ar/CH3F, CH2F2, or CH3F), FC/HFC (Ar/C4F8/CH2F2), or FC/H2 (Ar/C4F8/H2), plasma for aspect-ratio (AR) up to 25. To eliminate the effect of ions, oxide and nitride trench structures were treated by inductively coupled plasma. The changes in the film thickness as a function of AR were probed by ellipsometry. Additionally, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) measurements on oxide and nitride substrates processed by Ar/C4F8 and Ar/CH2F2 plasma were performed at various locations: outside of the trench structure, near the trench entrance (AR = 4.3), and deeper in the trench (AR = 12.9). We find a variety of responses of the trench sidewalls including both FC deposition and spontaneous etching which reflect (1) the nature of the FC and HFC gases, (2) the nature of the surfaces being exposed, and (3) the position relative to the trench entrance. Overall, both the etching and deposition patterns varied systematically depending on the precursor gas. We found that the ONO scalloping at different ARs is plasma chemistry dependent. Oxide showed a binary sidewall profile, with either all deposition inside of the trench (with FC and FC/H2 processing) or etching (HFC and FC/HFC). Both profiles showed a steady attenuation of either the deposition or etching at higher AR. On the nitride substrate, etching was observed near the entrance for HFC precursors, and maximum net etching occurred at higher AR for high F:C ratio HFC precursors like CHF3. XPS measurements performed with Ar/C4F8 and Ar/CH2F2 treated surfaces showed that Ar/C4F8 overall deposited a fluorine-rich film outside and inside of the trench, while Ar/CH2F2 mostly deposited a cross-linked film (except near the trench entrance) with an especially thin graphitic-like film deep inside the trench.\n\nSwitchbacks (SBs) are localized structures in the solar wind containing deflections of the magnetic field direction relative to the background solar wind magnetic field. The amplitudes of the magnetic field deflection angles for different SBs vary from ~40 to ~160-170 degrees. Alignment of the perturbations of the magnetic field and the bulk solar wind velocity is observed inside SBs and causes spiky enhancements of the radial bulk velocity inside SBs. We have investigated the deviations of SB perturbations from Alfvénicity by evaluating the distribution of the parameter defined as the ratio of the parallel to ΔB component of ΔV to ΔVA = ΔB/4πnimi inside SBs, i.e., α = V||/|ΔVA| ( α = |ΔV| /|ΔVA| when ΔV ∼ ΔB), which quantifies the deviation of the perturbation from an Alfvénic one. Based on Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observations, we show that α inside SBs has systematically lower values than it has in the pristine solar wind: α inside SBs observed during PSP Encounter 1 were distributed in a range of 0.2-0.9. The upper limit on α is constrained by the requirement that the jump in velocity across the switchback boundary be less than the local Alfvén speed. This prevents the onset of shear flow instabilities. The consequence is that the perturbation of the proton bulk velocity in SBs with deflection greater than 60 degrees cannot reach α = 1 (the Alfvénicity condition) and the highest possible α for a SB with the full reversal of B is 0.5. These results have consequences for the interpretation of switchbacks as large amplitude Alfvén waves.\n\nElemental vacancies are proposed as an effective approach to tuning the electronic structure of catalysts that are critical for energy conversion. However, for reactions such as the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction, the excess of oxygen vacancies (VO) is inevitable and detrimental to catalysts’ electrochemical stability and activities, e.g., in the most active RuO2. While significant work is carried out to hinder the formation of VO, the development of a fast and efficient strategy is limited. Herein, a protection SrO layer produced successfully at the surface of RuO2 with the in situ exsolution method with perovskite SrRuO3 as the precatalyst, which could significantly hinder the generation of VO. Benefited from the suppression of VO, the surface-modified RuO2 requires a low overpotential of 290 mV at 100 mA cm−2, accompanied by remarkably high electrochemical stability (100 h) and Faraday efficiency (≈100%). Theoretical investigation reveals that the formation energy of VO in RuO2 is almost doubled in the exsolved RuO2 phase as a result of the weakened Ru-O bond covalency. This work not only provides insight into the structural evolution of perovskite oxide catalysts but also demonstrates the feasibility of controlling vacancy formation via in situ exsolution.\n\nCertain configurations of anisotropic single crystal materials can generate a thermoelectric voltage orthogonal to an induced temperature gradient. This phenomenon is known as the Transverse Seebeck Effect (TSE) and can be leveraged to fabricate simple and robust heat flux sensors. Only a small number of materials have been considered as TSE-based transducers and, among these, few have been developed into sensors with ruggedization against chemical and mechanical degradation. Here, we report on the fabrication and characterization of a rugged TSE-based heat flux sensor using prismatic antimony single crystals. The heat flux sensor was tested under static and dynamic heating scenarios. The sensor has a linear responsivity of 16.8 µV/(W/cm2) to heat fluxes spanning more than two orders of magnitude and a time constant of 4.4 s. The sensor’s response to localized heating, probed with a laser scanning technique, validated that the transduction mechanism is primarily the TSE by ruling out a sizable contribution from the conventional Seebeck effect. Finite element analysis corroborated that components used in the sensor package are the primary determinants of the time constant and the decrement of the responsivity from its theoretical maximum. Design principles that may be applied to elicit a faster transient response or higher responsivity are proposed. The results establish single crystal antimony as a promising transducer material for heat flux measurement systems and demonstrate potential effects of ruggedization on sensor performance.\n\nFeF3 (iron(III) fluoride) is a promising conversion cathode material that possesses a theoretical specific capacity of 712 mAh/g, which is significantly higher than those of commercial layered cathodes, and it paves the way for realizing Co-free, low-cost advanced batteries for portable electronics, transportation, and grids. Here, we report the development of thin-film FeF3 conversion cathodes by the sputtering deposition technique. The chemistry and stoichiometry of the sputtered FeF3 thin films are confirmed by energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Through controlling the substrate temperatures (25−600 °C) of the sputtering deposition, amorphous and crystalline FeF3 samples were developed, characterized, and evaluated for electrochemical performance. FeF3 thin-film electrodes exhibit high initial capacity that is close to the theoretical capacity; after 100 cycles, FeF3 electrodes deposited between 100 and 600 °C show stable cycling performance from 31.7 to 59.3% compared to the initial capacity. Moreover, we investigate the relationship between the density, crystallinity, and lithiation potentials of the deposited FeF3 thin-film cathodes and report that the high-density, crystalline FeF3 exhibits a higher lithiation potential (Δ of ∼0.43 V) than the low-density, amorphous FeF3. The development of sputtered thin-film FeF3 presents an opportunity for thin-film battery fabrication and processing.\n\nThe effect of realistic atmospheric conditions on mid-IR (λ = 3.9 µm) and long-wave-IR (λ = 10 µm) laser-induced avalanche breakdown for the remote detection of radioactive material is examined experimentally and with propagation simulations. Our short-range in-lab mid-IR laser experiments show a correlation between increasing turbulence level and a reduced number of breakdown sites associated with a reduction in the portion of the focal volume above the breakdown threshold. Simulations of propagation through turbulence are in excellent agreement with these measurements and provide code validation. We then simulate propagation through realistic atmospheric turbulence over a long range (0.1–1 km) in the long-wave-IR regime (λ = 10 µm). The avalanche threshold focal volume is found to be robust even in the presence of strong turbulence, only dropping by ∼50% over a propagation length of ∼0.6 km. We also experimentally assess the impact of aerosols on avalanche-based detection, finding that, while background counts increase, a useful signal is extractable even at aerosol concentrations 105 times greater than what is typically observed in atmospheric conditions. Our results show promise for the long-range detection of radioactive sources under realistic atmospheric conditions.\n\nAtmospheric pressure non-equilibrium plasmas can form nitrogen oxide (NOx) compounds directly from nitrogen and oxygen without a catalyst, and at lower catalyst temperatures than would be possible without plasma. In this work, the oxidation of plasma-produced NO from an Ar/N2/O2 non-equilibrium atmospheric-pressure plasma-jet (APPJ) over a platinum-on-alumina powder catalyst was investigated with in-situ infrared spectroscopy. Products downstream of the catalyst bed were analyzed along with catalyst surface species. The catalyst was exposed to plasma at both constant temperature and a cyclic temperature ramp in order to study long-lasting and transient surface changes. Primary incident reactive species to the catalyst were assessed to be NO and O3. Pt-Al2O3 at 350°C increased oxidation of NO relative to Al2O3 or an empty chamber. The surface state of Pt-Al2O3 evolves during plasma-effluent exposure and requires upwards of 20 min exposure for stabilization compared to Al2O3. Once stable surface conditions are achieved, thermal cycling reveals a repeatable hysteresis pattern in downstream products. At low temperature, oxygen and NOx accumulate on the catalyst surface and react at elevated temperatures to form NO2. Increasing plasma power and O2:N2 ratio increases the hysteresis of the heating relative to the cooling curves in the pattern of NO2 formation. The limitation on NO oxidation at high temperatures was assessed to be Pt-O which is depleted as the catalyst is heated. Once stored species have been depleted, NO oxidation rates are determined by incoming reactants. Two overlapping NO oxidation patterns are identified, one determined by surface reactants formed at low temperature, and the other by reactants arriving at the surface at high temperature. The plasma is responsible for providing the reactants to the catalyst surface, while the catalyst enables reaction at high temperature or storage at low temperature for subsequent reaction.\n\nPlasmas can generate ultra-high-temperature reactive environments that can be used for the synthesis and processing of a wide range of materials. However, the limited volume, instability and non-uniformity of plasmas have made it challenging to scalably manufacture bulk, high-temperature materials. Here we present a plasma set-up consisting of a pair of carbon-fibre-tip-enhanced electrodes that enable the generation of a uniform, ultra-high temperature and stable plasma (up to 8,000 K) at atmospheric pressure using a combination of vertically oriented long and short carbon fibres. The long carbon fibres initiate the plasma by micro-spark discharge at a low breakdown voltage, whereas the short carbon fibres coalesce the discharge into a volumetric and stable ultra-high-temperature plasma. As a proof of concept, we used this process to synthesize various extreme materials in seconds, including ultra-hightemperature ceramics (for example, hafnium carbonitride) and refractory metal alloys. Moreover, the carbon-fibre electrodes are highly flexible and can be shaped for various syntheses. This simple and practical plasma technology may help overcome the challenges in high-temperature synthesis and enable large-scale electrifed plasma manufacturing powered by renewable electricity.\n\nSi is known for cracking and delamination during electrochemical cycling of a battery due to the large volume change associated with Li insertion and extraction. However, it has been found experimentally that patterned Si island electrodes that are 200 nm thick and less than 7 μm wide can deform in a purely elastic manner. Inspired by this, we performed in situ Raman stress characterization of model poly-crystalline Si island electrodes using an electrochemical cell coupled with an immersion objective lens and designed for a short working distance. A 5 μm wide Si island electrode showed a parabolic stress profile during lithiation, while for a 15 μm Si island electrode, a stress plateau in the center of the electrode was observed. A continuum model with coupled electro-chemo-mechanical (ECM) physics was established to understand the stress measurement. A qualitative agreement was reached between modeling and experimental data, and the critical size effect could be explained by the Li diffusive flux as governed by competition between the Li concentration and hydrostatic stress gradients. Below the critical size, the stress gradient drives Li toward the edges, where the electrode volume is free to expand, while above the critical size, the stress plateau inhibits Li diffusion to the edge and forces destructive stress relief by cracking. This work represents a promising methodology for in situ characterization of ECM coupling in battery electrodes, with suggestions provided for further improvement.\n\nWe present the results of 3D particle-in-cell simulations that explore relativistic magnetic reconnection in pair plasma with strong synchrotron cooling and a small mass fraction of nonradiating ions. Our results demonstrate that the structure of the current sheet is highly sensitive to the dynamic efficiency of radiative cooling. Specifically, stronger cooling leads to more significant compression of the plasma and magnetic field within the plasmoids. We demonstrate that ions can be efficiently accelerated to energies exceeding the plasma magnetization parameter, ≫ σ, and form a hard power-law energy distribution, fi ∝ γ−1. This conclusion implies a highly efficient proton acceleration in the magnetospheres of young pulsars. Conversely, the energies of pairs are limited to either σ in the strong cooling regime or the radiation burnoff limit, γsyn, when cooling is weak. We find that the high-energy radiation from pairs above the synchrotron burnoff limit, εc ≈ 16 MeV, is only efficiently produced in the strong cooling regime, γsyn < σ. In this regime, we find that the spectral cutoff scales as εcut ≈ εc(σ/γsyn) and the highest energy photons are beamed along the direction of the upstream magnetic field, consistent with the phenomenological models of gamma-ray emission from young pulsars. Furthermore, our results place constraints on the reconnection-driven models of gamma-ray flares in the Crab Nebula.\n\nWe have surveyed 21 reconnection exhaust events observed by Magnetospheric MultiScale in the low-plasma-β and high-Alfvén-speed regime of the Earth's magnetotail to investigate the scaling of electron bulk heating produced by reconnection. The ranges of inflow Alfvén speed and inflow electron βe covered by this study are 800–4000 km s−1 and 0.001–0.1, respectively, and the observed heating ranges from a few hundred electronvolts to several kiloelectronvolts. We find that the temperature change in the reconnection exhaust relative to the inflow, ΔTe, is correlated with the inflow Alfvén speed, VAx,in, based on the reconnecting magnetic field and the inflow plasma density. Furthermore, ΔTe is linearly proportional to the inflowing magnetic energy per particle, miVAx,in2, and the best fit to the data produces the empirical relation ΔTe = 0.020 miVAx,in2, i.e., the electron temperature increase is on average ∼2% of the inflowing magnetic energy per particle. This magnetotail study extends a previous magnetopause reconnection study by two orders of magnitude in both magnetic energy and electron β, to a regime that is comparable to the solar corona. The validity of the empirical relation over such a large combined magnetopause–magnetotail plasma parameter range of VA ∼ 10–4000 km s−1 and βe ∼ 0.001–10 suggests that one can predict the magnitude of the bulk electron heating by reconnection in a variety of contexts from the simple knowledge of a single parameter: the Alfvén speed of the ambient plasma.\n\nUsing observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's Atmosphere Imaging Assembly and the Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager, we present novel measurements of the shear of post-reconnection flare loops (PRFLs) in SOL20141218T21:40 and study its evolution with respect to magnetic reconnection and flare emission. Two quasi-parallel ribbons form adjacent to the magnetic polarity inversion line (PIL), spreading in time first parallel to the PIL and then mostly in a perpendicular direction. We measure the magnetic reconnection rate from the ribbon evolution, and also the shear angle of a large number of PRFLs observed in extreme ultraviolet passbands (≲1 MK). For the first time, the shear angle measurements are conducted using several complementary techniques allowing for cross validation of the results. In this flare, the total reconnection rate is much enhanced before a sharp increase in the hard X-ray emission, and the median shear decreases from 60°–70° to 20°, on a timescale of 10 minutes. We find a correlation between the shear-modulated total reconnection rate and the nonthermal electron flux. These results confirm the strong-to-weak shear evolution suggested in previous observational studies and reproduced in numerical models, and also confirm that, in this flare, reconnection is not an efficient producer of energetic nonthermal electrons during the first 10 minutes when the strongly sheared PRFLs are formed. We conclude that an intermediate shear angle, ≤40°, is needed for efficient particle acceleration via reconnection, and we propose a theoretical interpretation.\n\nAqueous Zn ion batteries (ZIBs) are one of the most promising battery chemistries for grid-scale renewable energy storage. However, their application is limited by issues such as Zn dendrite formation and undesirable side reactions that can occur in the presence of excess free water molecules andions. In this study, a nanocellulose-carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) hydrogel electrolyte is demonstrated that features stable cycling performance and high Zn2+ conductivity (26 mS cm−1), which is attributed to the material’s strong mechanical strength (≈70 MPa) and water-bonding ability. With this electrolyte, the Zn-metal anode shows exceptional cycling stability at an ultra-high rate, with the ability to sustain a current density as high as 80 mA cm−2 for more than 3500 cycles and a cumulative capacity of 17.6 Ah cm−2 (40 mA cm−2). Additionally, side reactions, such as hydrogen evolution and surface passivation, are substantially reduced due to the strong water-bonding capacity of the CMC. Full Zn||MnO2 batteries fabricated with this electrolyte demonstrate excellent high-rate performance and long-term cycling stability (>500 cycles at 8C). These results suggest the cellulose-CMC electrolyte as a promising low-cost, easy-to-fabricate, and sustainable aqueous-based electrolyte for ZIBs with excellent electrochemical performance that can help pave the way toward grid-scale energy storage for renewable energy sources.\n\nA variety of energy sources, ranging from dynamic processes, such as magnetic reconnection and waves, to quasisteady terms, such as plasma pressure, may contribute to the acceleration of the solar wind. We utilize a combination of charged particle and magnetic field observations from the Parker Solar Probe (PSP) to attempt to quantify the steady-state contribution of the proton pressure, the electric potential, and the wave energy to the solar wind proton acceleration observed by PSP between 13.3 and ∼100 solar radii (R☉). The proton pressure provides a natural kinematic driver of the outflow. The ambipolar electric potential acts to couple the electron pressure to the protons, providing another definite proton acceleration term. Fluctuations and waves, while inherently dynamic, can act as an additional effective steady-state pressure term. To analyze the contributions of these terms, we utilize radial binning of single-point PSP measurements, as well as repeated crossings of the same stream at different distances on individual PSP orbits (i.e., fast radial scans). In agreement with previous work, we find that the electric potential contains sufficient energy to fully explain the acceleration of the slower wind streams. On the other hand, we find that the wave pressure plays an increasingly important role in the faster wind streams. The combination of these terms can explain the continuing acceleration of both slow and fast wind streams beyond 13.3 R(☉).\n\nThe heterogeneous integration of silicon with III-V materials provides a way to overcome silicon’s limited optical properties toward a broad range of photonic applications. Hybrid modes are a promising way to integrate such heterogeneous Si/III-V devices, but it remains unclear how to utilize these modes to achieve photonic crystal cavities. Herein, using 3D finite-difference time-domain simulations, we propose a hybrid Si-GaAs photonic crystal cavity design that operates at telecom wavelengths and can be fabricated without requiring careful alignment. The hybrid cavity consists of a patterned silicon waveguide that is coupled to a wider GaAs slab featuring InAs quantum dots. We show that by changing the width of the silicon cavity waveguide, we can engineer the hybrid modes and control the degree of coupling to the active material in the GaAs slab. This provides the ability to tune the cavity quality factor while balancing the device’s optical gain and nonlinearity. With this design, we demonstrate cavity mode confinement in the GaAs slab without directly patterning it, enabling strong interaction with the embedded quantum dots for applications such as low-power-threshold lasing and optical bistability (156 nW and 18.1 µW, respectively). This heterogeneous integration of an active III-V material with silicon via a hybrid cavity design suggests a pro\n\nRecycling the degraded graphite is becoming increasingly important, which can helped conserve natural resources, reduce waste, and provide economic and environmental benefits. However, current regeneration methods usually suffer from the use of harmful chemicals, high energy and time consumption, and poor scalability. Herein, we report a continuously high-temperature heating (≈2000 K) process to directly and rapidly upcycle degraded graphite containing impurities. A sloped carbon heater is designed to provide the continuous heating source, which enables robust control over the temperature profile, eliminating thermal barrier for heat transfer compared to conventional furnace heating. The upcycling process can be completed within 0.1 s when the degraded graphite rolls down the sloped heater, allowing us to produce the upcycled graphite on a large scale. High-temperature heating removes impurities and enhances the graphitization degree and (002) interlayer spacing, making the upcycled graphite more suitable for lithium intercalation and deintercalation. The assembled upcycled graphite||Li cell displays a high reversible capacity of ≈320 mAh g−1 at 1 C with a capacity retention of 96% after 500 cycles, comparable to current state-of-the-art recycled graphite. The method is a chemical-free, rapid, and scalable way to upcycle degraded graphite, and is adaptable to recycle other electrode materials.\n\nThe design of electromagnetic coils may require evaluation of several quantities that are challenging to compute numerically. These quantities include Lorentz forces, which may be a limiting factor due to stresses; the internal magnetic field, which is relevant for determining stress as well as a superconducting coil's proximity to its quench limit; and the inductance, which determines stored magnetic energy and dynamics. When computing the effect on one coil due to the current in another, these quantities can often be approximated quickly by treating the coils as infinitesimally thin. When computing the effect on a coil due to its own current (e.g., self-force or self-inductance), evaluation is difficult due to the presence of a singularity; coils cannot be treated as infinitesimally thin as each quantity diverges at zero conductor width. Here, we present novel and well-behaved methods for evaluating these quantities using non-singular integral formulae of reduced dimensions. These formulae are determined rigorously by dividing the domain of integration of the magnetic vector potential into two regions, exploiting appropriate approximations in each region, and expanding in high aspect ratio. Our formulae show good agreement to full finite-thickness calculations even at low aspect ratio, both analytically for a torus and numerically for a non-planar coil of a stellarator fusion device, the Helically Symmetric eXperiment (HSX). Because the integrands of these formulae develop fine structure as the minor radius becomes infinitely thin, we also develop a method of evaluating the self-force and self-inductance with even greater efficiency by integrating this sharp feature analytically. We demonstrate with this method that the self-force can be accurately computed for the HSX coil with as few as 12 grid points.\n\nWe present EUV solar observations showing evidence for omnipresent jetting activity driven by small-scale magnetic reconnection at the base of the solar corona. We argue that the physical mechanism that heats and drives the solar wind at its source is ubiquitous magnetic reconnection in the form of small-scale jetting activity (a.k.a. jetlets). This jetting activity, like the solar wind and the heating of the coronal plasma, is ubiquitous regardless of the solar cycle phase. Each event arises from small-scale reconnection of opposite-polarity magnetic fields producing a short-lived jet of hot plasma and Alfvén waves into the corona. The discrete nature of these jetlet events leads to intermittent outflows from the corona, which homogenize as they propagate away from the Sun and form the solar wind. This discovery establishes the importance of small-scale magnetic reconnection in solar and stellar atmospheres in understanding ubiquitous phenomena such as coronal heating and solar wind acceleration. Based on previous analyses linking the switchbacks to the magnetic network, we also argue that these new observations might provide the link between the magnetic activity at the base of the corona and the switchback solar wind phenomenon. These new observations need to be put in the bigger picture of the role of magnetic reconnection and the diverse form of jetting in the solar atmosphere.\n\nTopology optimization, a technique to determine where material should be placed within a predefined volume in order to minimize a physical objective, is used across a wide range of scientific fields and applications. A general application for topology optimization is inverse magnetostatics; a desired magnetic field is prescribed, and a distribution of steady currents is computed to produce that target field. In the present work, electromagnetic coils are designed by magnetostatic topology optimization, using volume elements (voxels) of electric current, constrained so the current is divergence-free. Compared to standard electromagnet shape optimization, our method has the advantage that the nonlinearity in the Biot-Savart law with respect to position is avoided, enabling convex cost functions and a useful reformulation of topology optimization as sparse regression. To demonstrate, we consider the application of designing electromagnetic coils for a class of plasma experiments known as stellarators. We produce topologically-exotic coils for several new stellarator designs and show that these solutions can be interpolated into a filamentary representation and then further optimized.\n\nIn general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, accreted magnetic flux on the black hole horizon episodically decays, during which magnetic reconnection heats up the plasma near the horizon, potentially powering high-energy flares like those observed in M87* and Sgr A*. We study the mm observational counterparts of such flaring episodes in very high resolution GRMHD simulations. The change in 230 GHz flux during the expected high energy flares depends primarily on the efficiency of accelerating γ ≳ 100 (Te ≳ 1011 K) electrons. For models in which the electrons are heated to Te ∼ 1011 K during flares, the hot plasma produced by reconnection significantly enhances 230 GHz emission and increases the size of the 230 GHz image. By contrast, for models in which the electrons are heated to higher temperatures (which we argue are better motivated), the reconnection-heated plasma is too hot to produce significant 230 GHz synchrotron emission, and the 230 GHz flux decreases during high energy flares. We do not find a significant change in the mm polarization during flares as long as the emission is Faraday thin. We also present expectations for the ring-shaped image as observed by the Event Horizon Telescope during flares, as well as multiwavelength synchrotron spectra. Our results highlight several limitations of standard post-processing prescriptions for the electron temperature in GRMHD simulations. We also discuss the implications of our results for current and future observations of flares in Sgr A*, M87*, and related systems. Appendices contain detailed convergence studies with respect to resolution and plasma magnetization.\n\nWide-field imaging of magnetic signals using ensembles of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has garnered increasing interest due to its combination of micron-scale resolution, millimeter-scale field of view, and compatibility with diverse samples from across the physical and life sciences. Recently, wide-field NV magnetic imaging based on the Ramsey protocol has achieved uniform and enhanced sensitivity compared to conventional measurements. Here, we integrate the Ramsey-based protocol with spin-bath driving to extend the NV spin dephasing time and improve magnetic sensitivity. We also employ a high-speed camera to enable dynamic wide-field magnetic imaging. We benchmark the utility of this quantum diamond microscope (QDM) by imaging magnetic fields produced from a fabricated wire phantom. Over a 270 × 270 μm2 field of view, a median per-pixel magnetic sensitivity of 4.1(1) nT /Hz is realized with a spatial resolution ≲ 10 μm and sub-millisecond temporal resolution. Importantly, the spatial magnetic noise floor can be reduced to the picotesla scale by time-averaging and signal modulation, which enables imaging of a magnetic-field pattern with a peak-to-peak amplitude difference of about 300 pT. Finally, we discuss potential new applications of this dynamic QDM in studying biomineralization and electrically active cells.\n\nThe separation between the last closed flux surface of a plasma and the external coils that magnetically confine it is a limiting factor in the construction of fusion-capable plasma devices. This plasma-coil separation must be large enough so that components such as a breeding blanket and neutron shielding can fit between the plasma and the coils. Plasma-coil separation affects reactor size, engineering complexity, and particle loss due to field ripple. For some plasmas it can be difficult to produce the desired flux surface shaping with distant coils, and for other plasmas it is infeasible altogether. Here, we seek to understand the underlying physics that limits plasma-coil separation and explain why some configurations require close external coils. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that the limiting plasma-coil separation is set by the shortest scale length of the magnetic field as expressed by the ∇B tensor. We tested this hypothesis on a database of >40 stellarator and tokamak configurations. Within this database, the coil-to-plasma distance compared to the minor radius varies by over an order of magnitude. The magnetic scale length is well correlated to the coil-to-plasma distance of actual coil designs generated using the REGCOIL method (Landreman 2017 Nucl. Fusion 57 046003). Additionally, this correlation reveals a general trend that larger plasma-coil separation is possible with a small number of field periods.\n\nElectron-stimulated etching of surfaces functionalized by remote plasma is a flexible and novel approach for material removal. In comparison with plasma dry etching, which uses the ion-neutral synergistic effect to control material etching, electron beam-induced etching (EBIE) uses an electron-neutral synergistic effect. This approach appears promising for the reduction of plasma-induced damage (PID), including atomic displacement and lateral straggling, along with the potential for greater control and lateral resolution. One challenge for EBIE is the limited selection of chemical precursor molecules that can be used to produce functionalized materials suitable for etching under electron beam irradiation. In this work, we studied a new experimental approach that utilizes a remote plasma source to functionalize substrate surfaces in conjunction with electron beam irradiation by an electron flood gun. Etching rates (ERs) of SiO2, Si3N4, and poly-Si are reported in a broad survey of processing conditions. The parametric dependence of the ER of these Si-based materials on the operating parameters of the flood gun and the remote plasma source is evaluated. We also identified the processing parameters that enable the realization of material selective removal, i.e., the etching selectivity of Si3N4 over SiO2 and poly-Si over SiO2. Additionally, surface characterization of etched materials is used to clarify the effects of the co-introduction of particle fluxes from the remote plasma and flood gun sources on surface chemistry.\n\nWe present a robust optimization algorithm for the design of electromagnetic coils that generate vacuum magnetic fields with nested flux surfaces and precise quasi-symmetry. The method is based on a bilevel optimization problem, where the outer coil optimization is constrained by a set of inner least squares optimization problems whose solutions describe magnetic surfaces. The outer optimization objective targets coils that generate a field with nested magnetic surfaces and good quasi-symmetry. The inner optimization problems identify magnetic surfaces when they exist, and approximate surfaces in the presence of magnetic islands or chaos. We show that this formulation can be used to heal islands and chaos, thus producing coils that result in magnetic fields with precise quasi-symmetry. We show that the method can be initialized with coils from the traditional two-stage coil design process, as well as coils from a near-axis expansion optimization. We present a numerical example where island chains are healed and quasi-symmetry is optimized up to surfaces with aspect ratio 6. Another numerical example illustrates that the aspect ratio of nested flux surfaces with optimized quasi-symmetry can be decreased from 6 to approximately 4. The last example shows that our approach is robust and a cold-start using coils from a near-axis expansion optimization.\n\nKerr optical frequency combs are expected to play a major role in photonic technology, with applications related to spectroscopy, sensing, aerospace, and communication engineering. Most of these applications are related to the metrological performance of Kerr combs, which is ultimately limited by their noise-driven fluctuations. For this reason, it is of high importance to understand the influence of random noise on the comb dynamics. In this communication, we theoretically investigate a model where Gaussian white noise is added to the coupled-mode equations governing the comb dynamics. This stochastic model allows us to characterize the noise-induced broadening of the spectral lines. Moreover, this study permits to determine the phase noise spectra of the microwaves generated via comb photodetection. In this latter case, our analysis indicates that the low-frequency part of the spectra is dominated by pattern drift while the high-frequency part is dominated by pattern deformation. The theoretical results are found to be in excellent agreement with numerical simulations.\n\nIn magnetic confinement fusion devices, the ratio of the plasma pressure to the magnetic field energy, β, can become sufficiently large that electromagnetic microinstabilities become unstable, driving turbulence that distorts or reconnects the equilibrium magnetic field. In this paper, a theory is proposed for electromagnetic, electron-driven linear instabilities that have current layers localised to mode-rational surfaces and binormal wavelengths comparable to the ion gyroradius. The model retains axisymmetric toroidal geometry with arbitrary shaping, and consists of orbit-averaged equations for the mode-rational surface layer, with a ballooning space kinetic matching condition for passing electrons. The matching condition connects the current layer to the large scale electromagnetic fluctuations, and is derived in the limit that β is comparable to the square root of the electron-to-ion-mass ratio. Electromagnetic fluctuations only enter through the matching condition, allowing for the identification of an effective β that includes the effects of equilibrium flux surface shaping. The scaling predictions made by the asymptotic theory are tested with comparisons to results from linear simulations of micro-tearing and electrostatic microinstabilities in MAST discharge #6252, showing excellent agreement. In particular, it is demonstrated that the effective β can explain the dependence of the local micro-tearing mode (MTM) growth rate on the ballooning parameter θ0–possibly providing a route to optimise local flux surfaces for reduced MTM-driven transport.\n\nIn this paper, we analyze and numerically simulate mechanisms for generating directed rf radiation by a low-intensity laser pulse train (LPT) propagating in air. The LPT ionizes the air, forming a plasma filament. The ionization process relies on the background level of radioactivity which plays an important role in initiating a collisional ionization process. In our model a low-intensity LPT photoionizes background negative ions (produced by ambient ionizing radiation) and provides the seed electrons necessary to initiate collisional ionization. The intensity of the LPT is far below tunneling ionization levels. The ponderomotive forces associated with the LPT and self-fields drive plasma oscillations predominately in the radial direction. The driven radial electron currents in turn generate directed rf radiation. As the plasma density builds up on axis, the later portion of the LPT can defocus and limit the interaction length. The spectrum of the rf radiation consists of the fundamental frequency associated with the pulse separation time as well as harmonics. The rf generation mechanism is analyzed using fluid equations which incorporate, among other things, the effects of background radioactivity, photoionization, collisional ionization, ponderomotive and space-charge effects, and electron attachment–recombination processes. As an example, for a specific set of parameters, the rf spectrum and intensity are compared to experimental data.\n\nWe present the theoretical framework required to describe the statistics of microwave networks that serve to model quantum graphs. The networks are described by impedance and admittance matrices relating the voltages and currents at the network's ports. As we show, these matrices can be calculated in a number of ways. Normal modes of the network are characterized by a discrete set of wave numbers corresponding to the propagation constants on the network's bonds for which the determinant of the admittance matrix vanishes. The distribution of the spacings between adjacent eigenmode wave numbers is found to depend on the nature of the way bonds are connected at nodes. The critical quantity is the reflection coefficient presented at a node to a wave on a bond. As the reflection coefficient increases, the spacing distribution changes from one characteristic of the spacing of eigenvalues of a Gaussian orthogonal ensemble matrix to a Poisson distribution. The effect of loss is studied, and the scaling of the variance of the impedance values on network size, degree distribution, and other parameters is characterized. We attempted to find universal scaling relations for the distribution of impedance values for networks of different sizes. Finally, we compare the distribution of impedance values predicted by the model with those measured in a network of cables.\n\nElectromagnetic wave scattering in electrically large, irregularly shaped, environments is a common phenomenon. The deterministic, or first-principles, study of this process is usually computationally expensive and the results exhibit extreme sensitivity to scattering details. For this reason, the deterministic approach is often dropped in favor of a statistical one. The random coupling model (RCM) Hemmady et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 94, 014102 (2005).] is one such approach that has found great success in providing a statistical characterization for wave chaotic systems in the frequency domain. Here we aim to transform the RCM into the time domain and generalize it to alternative situations. The proposed time-domain RCM (TDRCM) method can treat a wave chaotic system with multiple ports and modes. Two features are now possible with the time-domain approach for chaotic resonators: the incorporation of early time short-orbit transmission path effects between the ports, and the inclusion of arbitrary nonlinear or time-varying port load impedances. We conduct short-pulse time-domain experiments in wave chaotic enclosures, and use the TDRCM to simulate the corresponding experimental setup. We also examine a diode-loaded port and compare experimental results with a numerical TDRCM treatment and find agreement.\n\nThe electric field of a tightly focused milliwatt laser pointer can reach an impressive 50 000 V/m, a gradient that could, in principle, accelerate the electrons in a dental x-ray tube. With lots of cheap laser pointers and some assembly time at your kitchen table, can you build a 10 million V/m compact electron accelerator? Sadly, it wouldn’t work, and you’d needlessly annoy the neighbors.\n\nThree main problems undermine the laser-accelerator project. First, although the light wave in a laser beam is a coherent electromagnetic field oscillation, with peaks and valleys aligned in lockstep, the train of peaks and valleys from the second laser is randomly phase shifted in time with respect to the first. So the fields from multiple lasers would interfere, as peaks from one laser cancel valleys from another.\n\nIf one has N such randomly phased laser beams, each with intensity I, the peak intensity from combining the beams would be NI. If all of them were in phase, with their wave trains aligned, however, the peak intensity would be N2I. But, alas, that dividend of coherent superposition is unavailable to the well-meaning hobbyist who just purchased a wheelbarrow full of $5 laser pointers.\n\nSuppose you bypass the problem by simply buying a laser that, when tightly focused, gives an electric field of 107 V/m. Then the second problem can be expressed this way: “Hey genius, where’s my meter?” The heckler is pointing out that the focused laser beam is, at most, tens of microns wide—far less than 1 m. So the field is better expressed as the ratio 200 V/(20 µm), and your laser purchase would provide (at most) only 200 V of accelerating potential across the focal spot. Actually, it wouldn’t even remotely do that, courtesy of the third problem.\n\nThat problem is that laser light in free space is a high-frequency transverse electromagnetic wave, with fields orthogonal to the beam direction: An electron would do a high-frequency sideways shimmy, with negligible net acceleration and energy gain.\n\nKey to recent successes in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) has been the ability to train a growing number of parameters which form fixed connectivity matrices between layers of nonlinear nodes. This “deep learning” approach to AI has historically required an exponential growth in processing power which far exceeds the growth in computational throughput of digital hardware as well as trends in processing efficiency. New computing paradigms are therefore required to enable efficient processing of information while drastically improving computational throughput. Emerging strategies for analog computing in the photonic domain have the potential to drastically reduce latency but require the ability to modify optical processing elements according to the learned parameters of the neural network. In this point-of-view article, we provide a forward-looking perspective on both optical and electrical memories coupled to integrated photonic hardware in the context of AI. We also show that for programmed memories, the READ energy-latency-product of photonic random-access memory (PRAM) can be orders of magnitude lower compared to electronic SRAMs. Our intent is to outline path for PRAMs to become an integral part of future foundry processes and give these promising devices relevance for emerging AI hardware.\n\nPetawatt-class lasers can produce multi-GeV electron beams through laser wakefield electron acceleration. As a by-product, the accelerated electron beams can generate synchrotron-like radiation known as betatron radiation. In the present work, we measure the properties of the radiation produced from 2 GeV, 215 pC electron beams, which shows a broad radiation spectrum with a critical energy of 515 keV, extending up to MeV photon energies and 10 mrad divergence. Due to its high energy and flux, such radiation is an ideal candidate for x-ray radiography of dense objects. We employed a compact betatron radiation setup operated at relatively high-repetition rates (0.1 Hz) and used it to scan cm-sized objects: a DRAM circuit, BNC and SMA connectors, a padlock and a gas jet nozzle. GEANT4 simulations were carried out to reproduce the radiograph of the gas jet. The setup and the radiation source can reveal the interior structure of the objects at the sub-mm level, proving that it can further be applied to diagnose cracks or holes in various components. The radiation source presented here is a valuable tool for non-destructive inspection and for applications in high-energy-density physics such as nuclear fusion.\n\nThe processes controlling the complex clump structure, phase distribution, and magnetic field geometry that develop across a broad range of scales in the turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) remain unclear. Using unprecedentedly high-resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations of thermally unstable turbulent systems, we show that large current sheets unstable to plasmoid-mediated reconnection form regularly throughout the volume. The plasmoids form in three distinct environments: (i) within cold clumps, (ii) at the asymmetric interface of the cold and warm phases, and (iii) within the warm, volume-filling phase. We then show that the complex magnetothermal phase structure is characterized by a predominantly highly magnetized cold phase, but that regions of high magnetic curvature, which are the sites of reconnection, span a broad range in temperature. Furthermore, we show that thermal instabilities change the scale-dependent anisotropy of the turbulent magnetic field, reducing the increase in eddy elongation at smaller scales. Finally, we show that most of the mass is contained in one contiguous cold structure surrounded by smaller clumps that follow a scale-free mass distribution. These clumps tend to be highly elongated and exhibit a size versus internal velocity relation consistent with supersonic turbulence and a relative clump distance–velocity scaling consistent with subsonic motion. We discuss the striking similarity of cold plasmoids to observed tiny-scale atomic and ionized structures and H i fibers and consider how the presence of plasmoids will modify the motion of charged particles, thereby impacting cosmic-ray transport and thermal conduction in the ISM and other similar systems.\n\nA combination of depth-resolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy (DRCLS) and X-ray photoemission depth profiling (XPS) measured the pronounced changes in both the electronic density of states and lithium composition near the nanoscale LixV2O5/LiPON interface. DRCLS studies of electrochemically lithiated bare V2O5 and the sputter-deposited V2O5 plus LiPON overlayer electrochemically lithiated in stages both showed that in the bulk the luminescence intensity of the “split-off” hybridized bonding density of states was anticorrelated with XPS-measured Li content, decreasing as the Li content increased. However, the LiPON overlayer was found to modify the band structure of the underlying LixV2O5 (LVO) to a depth of at least 30 nm beneath the V2O5 interface. DRCLS spectra near the electrochemically lithiated LiPON/LVO interface showed a significant intensity of the split-off band, implying a low Li content. However, XPS depth profiling revealed a pronounced negative gradient of Li extending from a maximum Li content at the intimate LiPON boundary to its lowest content of ∼30 nm into the V2O5 in the same region, indicating a strong interaction between band structure and Li electrochemical potential near this heterojunction. These results provide evidence for substantial effects on the local band structure near an electrolyte/cathode interface and insights into the electrochemical interface behavior of solid-state batteries in general.\n\nConfining energetic ions such as alpha particles is a prime concern in the design of stellarators. However, directly measuring alpha confinement through numerical simulation of guiding-center trajectories has been considered to be too computationally expensive and noisy to include in the design loop, and instead has been most often used only as a tool to assess stellarator designs post hoc. In its place, proxy metrics, simplified measures of confinement, have often been used to design configurations because they are computationally more tractable and have been shown to be effective. Despite the success of proxies, their correlation with direct trajectory calculations is known to be imperfect. In this study, we optimize stellarator designs for improved alpha particle confinement without the use of proxy metrics. In particular, we numerically optimize an objective function that measures alpha particle losses by simulating alpha particle trajectories. While this method is computationally expensive, we find that it can be used successfully to generate configurations with low losses.\n\nNanostructured solid-state batteries (SSBs) are poised to meet the demands of next-generation energy storage technologies by realizing performance competitive to their liquid-based counterparts while simultaneously offering improved safety and expanded form factors. Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is among the tools essential to fabricate nanostructured devices with challenging aspect ratios. Here, we report the fabrication and electrochemical testing of the first nanoscale sodium all-solid-state battery (SSB) using ALD to deposit both the V2O5 cathode and NaPON solid electrolyte followed by evaporation of a thin-film Na metal anode. NaPON exhibits remarkable stability against evaporated Na metal, showing no electrolyte breakdown or significant interphase formation in the voltage range of 0.05–6.0 V vs Na/Na+. Electrochemical analysis of the SSB suggests intermixing of the NaPON/V2O5 layers during fabrication, which we investigate in three ways: in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry, time-resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling, and cross-sectional cryo-scanning transmission electron microscopy (cryo-STEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). We characterize the interfacial reaction during the ALD NaPON energy loss spectroscopy (EELS). We characterize the interfacial reaction during the ALD NaPON deposition on V2O5 to be twofold: (1) reduction of V2O5 to VO2 and (2) Na+ insertion into VO2 to form NaxVO2. Despite the intermixing of NaPON–V2O5, we demonstrate that NaPON-coated V2O5 electrodes display enhanced electrochemical cycling stability in liquid-electrolyte coin cells through the formation of a stable electrolyte interphase. In all-SSBs, the Na metal evaporation process is found to intensify the intermixing reaction, resulting in the irreversible formation of mixed interphases between discrete battery layers. Despite this graded composition, the SSB can operate for over 100 charge–discharge cycles at room temperature and represents the first demonstration of a functional thin-film solid-state sodium-ion battery.\n\nSome of the most energetic pulsars exhibit rotation-modulated γ-ray emission in the 0.1–100 GeV band. The luminosity of this emission is typically 0.1%–10% of the pulsar spin-down power (γ-ray efficiency), implying that a significant fraction of the available electromagnetic energy is dissipated in the magnetosphere and reradiated as high-energy photons. To investigate this phenomenon we model a pulsar magnetosphere using 3D particle-in-cell simulations with strong synchrotron cooling. We particularly focus on the dynamics of the equatorial current sheet where magnetic reconnection and energy dissipation take place. Our simulations demonstrate that a fraction of the spin-down power dissipated in the magnetospheric current sheet is controlled by the rate of magnetic reconnection at microphysical plasma scales and only depends on the pulsar inclination angle. We demonstrate that the maximum energy and the distribution function of accelerated pairs is controlled by the available magnetic energy per particle near the current sheet, the magnetization parameter. The shape and the extent of the plasma distribution is imprinted in the observed synchrotron emission, in particular, in the peak and the cutoff of the observed spectrum. We study how the strength of synchrotron cooling affects the observed variety of spectral shapes. Our conclusions naturally explain why pulsars with higher spin-down power have wider spectral shapes and, as a result, lower γ-ray efficiency.\n\nMost stars generate winds and move through the interstellar medium that surrounds them. This movement creates a cocoon formed by the deflection of these winds that envelops and protects the stars. We call these “cocoons” astrospheres. The Sun has its own cocoon, the heliosphere. The heliosphere is an immense shield that protects the Solar System from harsh, galactic radiation. The radiation that enters the heliosphere affects life on Earth as well as human space exploration. Galactic cosmic rays are the dominant source of radiation and principal hazard affecting space missions within our Solar System. Current global heliosphere models do not successfully predict the radiation environment at all locations or under different solar conditions. To understand the heliosphere’s shielding properties, we need to understand its structure and large-scale dynamics. A fortunate confluence of missions has provided the scientific community with a treasury of heliospheric data. However, fundamental features remain unknown. The vision of the Solar wind with Hydrogen Ion charge Exchange and Large-Scale Dynamics (SHIELD) DRIVE Science Center is to understand the nature and structure of the heliosphere. Through four integrated research thrusts leading to the global model, SHIELD will: 1) determine the global nature of the heliosphere; 2) determine how pickup ions evolve from “cradle to grave” and affect heliospheric processes; 3) establish how the heliosphere interacts with and influences the Local Interstellar Medium (LISM); and 4) establish how cosmic rays are filtered by and transported through the heliosphere. The key deliverable is a comprehensive, self-consistent, global model of the heliosphere that explains data from all relevant in situ and remote observations and predicts the radiation environment. SHIELD will develop a “digital twin” of the heliosphere capable of: (a) predicting how changing solar and LISM conditions affect life on Earth, (b) understanding the radiation environment to support long-duration space travel, and (c) contributing toward finding life elsewhere in the Galaxy. SHIELD also will train the next-generation of heliophysicists, a diverse community fluent in team science and skilled working in highly transdisciplinary collaborative environments.\n\nThe ability of machine learning (ML) models to “extrapolate” to situations outside of the range spanned by their training data is crucial for predicting the long-term behavior of non-stationary dynamical systems (e.g., prediction of terrestrial climate change), since the future trajectories of such systems may (perhaps after crossing a tipping point) explore regions of state space which were not explored in past time-series measurements used as training data. We investigate the extent to which ML methods can yield useful results by extrapolation of such training data in the task of forecasting non-stationary dynamics, as well as conditions under which such methods fail. In general, we find that ML can be surprisingly effective even in situations that might appear to be extremely challenging, but do (as one would expect) fail when “too much” extrapolation is required. For the latter case, we show that good results can potentially be obtained by combining the ML approach with an available inaccurate conventional model based on scientific knowledge.\n\nWe present a technique that can be used to design stellarators with a high degree of experimental flexibility. For our purposes, flexibility is defined by the range of values the rotational transform can take on the magnetic axis of the vacuum field while maintaining satisfactory quasisymmetry. We show that accounting for configuration flexibility during the modular coil design improves flexibility beyond that attained by previous methods. Careful placement of planar control coils and the incorporation of an integrability objective enhance the quasisymmetry and nested flux surface volume of each configuration. We show that it is possible to achieve flexibility, quasisymmetry, and nested flux surface volume to reasonable degrees with a relatively simple coil set through an NCSX-like example. This example coil design is optimized to achieve three rotational transform targets and nested flux surface volumes in each magnetic configuration larger than the NCSX design plasma volume. Our work suggests that there is a tradeoff between flexibility, quasisymmetry, and volume of nested flux surfaces.\n\nTrapped ions are one of the leading candidates for scalable and long-distance quantum networks because of their long qubit coherence time, high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates, and their ability to generate photons entangled with the qubit state of the ion. One method for creating ion-photon entanglement is to exploit optical transitions from the 6P1/2 to 6S1/2 levels, which naturally emit spin-photon entangled states. But these optical transitions typically lie in the ultraviolet and visible wavelength regions of the spectrum. These wavelengths exhibit significant fiber-optic propagation loss, thereby limiting the transfer of quantum information to tens of meters. Quantum frequency conversion is essential to convert these photons to telecom wavelengths so that they can propagate over long distances in fiber-based networks, as well as for compatibility with the vast number of telecom-based optoelectronic components. Here, we generate O-band telecom photons via a low-noise quantum frequency conversion scheme from photons emitted from the 6P1/2 to 6S1/2 dipole transition of a trapped barium ion. We use a two-stage quantum frequency conversion scheme to achieve a frequency shift of 375.4 THz between the input visible photon and the output telecom photon, achieving a conversion efficiency of 11%. We attain a signal-to-background ratio of over 100 for the converted O-band telecom photon with background noise of less than 15 counts/s. These results are an important step toward achieving trapped ion quantum networks over long distances for distributed quantum computing and quantum communication.\n\nWe present a new neoclassical transport model for large aspect ratio tokamaks where the gradient scale lengths are of the size of the ion poloidal gyroradius. Previous work on neoclassical transport across transport barriers assumed large density and potential gradients but a small temperature gradient, or neglected the gradient of the mean parallel flow. Using large aspect ratio and low collisionality expansions, we relax these restrictive assumptions. We define a new set of variables based on conserved quantities, which simplifies the drift kinetic equation whilst keeping strong gradients, and derive equations describing the transport of particles, parallel momentum and energy by ions in the banana regime. The poloidally varying parts of density and electric potential are included. Studying contributions from both passing and trapped particles, we show that the resulting transport is dominated by trapped particles. We find that a non-zero neoclassical particle flux requires parallel momentum input which could be provided through interaction with turbulence or impurities. We derive upper and lower bounds for the energy flux across a transport barrier in both temperature and density and present example profiles and fluxes.\n\nLithium metal solid-state batteries (LiSSBs) present new challenges in the measurement of material, component, and cell mechanical behaviors and in the measurement and theory of fundamental mechanical-electrochemical (thermodynamics, transport, and kinetics) couplings. Here, we classify the major mechanical and electrochemical-mechanical (ECM) studies underway and provide an overview of major mechanical testing platforms. We emphasize key distinctions among testing platforms, including tip- vs. platen-based sample compression, surface- vs. volume-based analysis, ease of integration with a vacuum or inert atmosphere environment, the ability to control and measure force/displacement over long periods of time, ranges of force and contact area, and others. Among the techniques we review, nanoindentation platforms offer some unique benefits associated with being able to use both tip-based nanoindentation techniques as well as platen-based compression over areas approaching 1 mm2. Sample design is also important: while most efforts are particle-based (i.e., using particles of solid electrolyte and cathode-active materials and densifying them using sintering or pressure), the resulting electrochemical response is from the overall collection of particles present. In contrast, thin-film (<1 μm) solid-state battery materials (e.g., Li, LiPON, LCO) provide well defined and uniform structures well suited for fundamental electrochemical-mechanical studies and offer an important opportunity to drive underlying scientific advances in LiSSB and other areas. We believe there are exciting opportunities to advance the measurement of both mechanical properties and electrochemical-mechanical couplings through the careful and novel co-design of test structures and experimental approaches for LiSSB materials, components, and cells.\n\nTerahertz (THz) radiation encompasses a wide spectral range within the electromagnetic spectrum that extends from microwaves to the far infrared (100 GHz–∼30 THz). Within its frequency boundaries exist a broad variety of scientific disciplines that have presented, and continue to present, technical challenges to researchers. During the past 50 years, for instance, the demands of the scientific community have substantially evolved and with a need for advanced instrumentation to support radio astronomy, Earth observation, weather forecasting, security imaging, telecommunications, non-destructive device testing and much more. Furthermore, applications have required an emergence of technology from the laboratory environment to production-scale supply and in-the-field deployments ranging from harsh ground-based locations to deep space. In addressing these requirements, the research and development community has advanced related technology and bridged the transition between electronics and photonics that high frequency operation demands. The multidisciplinary nature of THz work was our stimulus for creating the 2017 THz Science and Technology Roadmap (Dhillon et al 2017 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 50 043001). As one might envisage, though, there remains much to explore both scientifically and technically and the field has continued to develop and expand rapidly. It is timely, therefore, to revise our previous roadmap and in this 2023 version we both provide an update on key developments in established technical areas that have important scientific and public benefit, and highlight new and emerging areas that show particular promise. The developments that we describe thus span from fundamental scientific research, such as THz astronomy and the emergent area of THz quantum optics, to highly applied and commercially and societally impactful subjects that include 6G THz communications, medical imaging, and climate monitoring and prediction. Our Roadmap vision draws upon the expertise and perspective of multiple international specialists that together provide an overview of past developments and the likely challenges facing the field of THz s"
