Although a shadow was cast over the event\n\nby the tragic accident to Bob Collins, the first Edenvale Sports Car G.P.\n\nwill go down in club history as a most outstanding occasion.\n\nPlans were drawn up months ahead of time and frequent progress meetings\n\nwere held to determine the state of arrangements. The race committee\n\nworked with a will and a great number of the club members were called\n\nupon for assistance. The results, we feel, more than justified the work\n\ninvolved.\n\nWe should like to mention in particular the senior officials who contri-\n\nbuted so much to the success of the event.

Bulletin, Vol 5, Issue 10, October 1952.\n\nPage 17\n\nAN URGE FOR MORE URGE.\n\nOne night last winter some of the local MG types were\n\ngathered around, talking over the usual subject of MG\n\nowners. âHow to make an MG go fasterâ. All the usual\n\nmethods were discussed, and while blowers raised com-\n\npression and tuning gives very good results, these modif-\n\nications did not seem to be the answer to me. About this\n\ntime in one of the American sports car mags. were photos\n\nof an MG TC powered by a Ford V8 60 engine. This sounded\n\nlike a good method of increasing the torque and power due\n\nto the much larger capacity of the Ford engine.\n\nOne of my ideas, which made things quite a bit more com-\n\nplicated, was that the MG transmission must be retained,\n\nsince the gearbox is one of the best attributes of the\n\nMG. Work was started in January at the north garage of\n\nScarboro Beach, where Jack Barr undertook to match MG\n\ngearbox to Ford block. After a large number of ideas\n\nwere proposed and rejected, both mine and others, Jack\n\nfound the answer which sounds simple, but nevertheless\n\ntook a lot of thought and knowledge of component parts of\n\nvarious cars and other little known things, such as\n\nAmerican car parts that match MG parts. A steel strap\n\nwas bolted to the inside of the V8 block and lugs were\n\nbrazed on wherever necessary. To take care of the in-\n\ncreased torque a larger clutch was thought necessary.\n\nThis was taken care of by a 9\" Land Rover pressure plate\n\nwhich just manages to swing inside the MG clutch housing\n\nby dint of some judicial filing. The driven plate is\n\nDodge and fits very neatly both the Land Rover clutch and\n\nthe MG clutch shaft. Other necessary alterations were\n\nnew front motor mounts, moving the steering box 3\" rearwards,\n\nmodifying the rad for twin water lines. The engine\n\nsump was modified to hold 2 extra quarts of oil. The 12\n\nvolt electric system was retained, using MG generator and\n\nFord starting motor which performs with great gusto on\n\n12 volts. Special equipment includes 9 to 1 heads, dual\n\nmanifold, no.87 Ford carbs. and a Weber camshaft. The\n\noutput is in the region of 90 HP at 5000 RPM.\n\nThe performance is very satisfactory, though the car is\n\nnow grossly low geared. Starts are made in second gear.\n\nPage 18\n\nOver 6000 RPM is possible without valve bounce. The\n\nnew engine does not weigh any more than the MG engine,\n\nleaving the weight of the car at 1850 pounds with 55%\n\nof this on the rear wheels. At present the problems\n\nof the low axle ratio and the high engine temperature\n\ndampen enjoyment of the car on the highway, but it\n\ncertainly makes a grand hill climb special.\n\nby HOT RODDER\n\n[Comment: The author of this article is likely Neil Bryson, who set the hill record at Rattlesnake Point Hill Climb, on June 7, 1952, driving a red MG V8-60, with alloy bonnet.

That meant\n\nthere were no relatively inexpensive sports cars\n\nwith performance capabilities of over one hundred\n\nmiles per hour. So if you wanted to go fast cheaply,\n\nyou took an MG and put a bigger engine in it. The\n\nmost popular conversion was to replace the 1250 cc\n\nfour cylinder standard unit with a souped up Ford\n\nV8-60 motor thus increasing the power available\n\nfrom 54 HP to 85 HP or more. Other motors were\n\ntried too but I think the most remarkable conversion\n\nwas a car named \"Mother Goose\".\n\n\"Mother Goose\" was created by Jim Fergusson\n\nof Toronto. An ex-racing motor-cyclist, Jim was one\n\nof Canada's pioneer sports car race drivers. In\n\n1950, he installed a Morris engine of the same basic\n\ntype as the XPAG MG unit in a Morris Minor, thus\n\ncreating the F-M (Fergusson Morris). Jim drove the\n\nF-M to eleventh over-all position in the Sam Collier\n\nMemorial Six Hour Race, the first ever run at Sebring.\n\nBut, though the innocent looking F-M was fairly\n\nfast and much fun to drive, Jim hankered after more\n\nperformance and when the opportunity arose to buy a\n\ndamaged MG-TD, he set to work to build up the\n\n\"Mother Goose\". For power, he chose a six cylinder\n\nG.M.C. 270 truck engine, coupled it to a Ford 3-\n\nspeed transmission and used a Ford rear axle with a\n\n3.78/1 ratio. Of course, the Ford axle had to be\n\nnarrowed in tread and its torque tube shortened in\n\norder to fit under the MG. The greater length of the\n\nG.M.C. engine was accommodated by tucking it into\n\na bulge in the bulkhead, without sacrificing leg\n\nroom or moving the foot pedals.\n\nBumpers, heavy front fenders and other weighty\n\nitems were stripped off. Even so the total weight\n\nwas 2350 lbs. The 4410 cc engine was modified\n\nconsiderably. The head was planed to give 8.5-1\n\ncompression ratio, a Spalding 3/4 cam installed a-\n\nlong with changes in the valve operating train. Three\n\nS.U. carburetors, two-inch diameter inlet valves and\n\ninlet ports opened out improved the breathing so that\n\nthe power output was probably close to 175 HP. The\n\nresult was the fastest accelerating car in Canada.\n\nIn the 1953 Edenvale Sprint trials \"Mother Goose\"\n\ncovered the quarter mile from a standing start in 15.78\n\nseconds. At the Le Mans start of another race, Dean\n\nGooderham made a spectacular getaway with spin-\n\nning, smoking, tires leaving two black streaks of\n\nrubber for many yards.\n\nAlas, the brakes were inadequate for the in-\n\ncreased performance and were prone to fading easily.\n\nEven so, Jim Fergusson finished 3rd in the 1953\n\nEdenvale Grand Prix having driven almost the whole\n\nrace without brakes. \"Mother Goose\" was relegated\n\nto hill climbs with some success. A new record at\n\nRattlesnake Hill, third fastest at Hockley Valley\n\nwithout any prior practice, tied for first in class at\n\nGiants Despair, these were some of the \"Mother\n\nGoose\" achievements. But Jim Fergusson was not\n\nsatisfied and the MG-GMC passed to a new owner\n\nwhen Jim became enthusiastic about an Austin\n\nHealey with a double overhead camshaft head de-\n\nsigned and built by Harold Hunter of Kitchener.\n\nDoes anybody have any more of these Western New Yorker newsletters?\n\n(#24 Scrapbook Memories featured Kenny Ahr â to follow.)\n\nSee also Autosport, 11 June 1954, Page 756.\n\nRGDS RLT\n\nEdited by Rupertlt1, 08 June 2022 - 05:06.\n\nSCRAPBOOK\n\nMEMORIES\n\nby bill close\n\nNo. 24 - Kenny Ahr\n\nThe Kenneth Ahr Memorial Trophy awarded\n\neach year at the Lake Erie Invitational Races\n\nperpetuates the memory of Kenny Ahr, a\n\nWestern New York Region member, whose\n\ndeath on 16 May, 1955, at the age of 47,\n\nended a racing career spanning twenty-five\n\nyears.\n\nDuring the nineteen thirties, Kenny raced\n\nbig cars and midgets on many dirt tracks all\n\nover the Eastern USA and Canada. According\n\nto hearsay, Kenny even qualified a car at\n\nIndianapolis one year but was bumped from\n\nthe starting line-up by a later and faster\n\nqualifier. His first contact with road rac-\n\ning was accidental, for, while returning\n\none time from racing in upper New York\n\nState, Kenny heard of a race about to be run\n\nthrough the streets of a small town. This\n\nwas one of the events put on by the Ameri-\n\ncan Racing Drivers Club, a predecessor of\n\nthe SCCA, and the town was Alexandria Bay,\n\nNew York. Kenny saw the event, and his\n\ninterest in road racing and sports cars com-\n\nmenced.\n\nKenny joined the SCCA in late 1945 when the\n\nClub had less than ninety members. He was,\n\nin fact, the third member from Western New\n\nYork. In those days membership was limited\n\nto owners of sports cars and Kenny's car\n\nwas a 1937 Type 327 BMW cabriolet. Sev-\n\neral years later, he acquired a MG-TC and\n\nwith it commenced SCCA racing in 1951.\n\nTwo years later, the MG was replaced by the\n\nCrosley engined Siata Spyder shown above;\n\nthis car was raced in many events during\n\n1953 and 1954. Much of the engine tuning\n\nexperience applied to this car was gained\n\nsome years earlier when Kenny raced a Cros-\n\nley sedan in the winter time races run in-\n\nside one of the Buffalo Armories.\n\nIn 1951, Kenny and Mr. Charles Jones es-\n\ntablished the sports car business now\n\nknown as Ahr & Company Sports Cars, Inc.\n\nThe first location on Hertel Avenue be-\n\ncame a sort of unofficial club room for all\n\nsports car enthusiasts. There, one could\n\nfind information about sports car events\n\nboth local and national. And when not\n\nselling cars, Kenny, between cigar puffs,\n\nwould regale one with tales and anecdotes\n\nfrom many years of racing.\n\nKenny was not a spectacular driver of\n\nsports cars. He raced for his own enjoy-\n\nment and had long learned the truth\n\nof the drivers' saying, \"There are reckless\n\ndrivers and old drivers, but no old reck-\n\nless drivers.\" Very much a lone operator,\n\nKenny prepared his cars himself and would\n\ndrive several hundred miles alone to com-\n\npete in a race. He enjoyed successes\n\nwith the Siata such as many class HM\n\nprizes or the Sports Car Trophy which he\n\nwon at Edenvale in 1953. He also accept-\n\n-ed his failures philosophically and never\n\nseemed to be rattled. I remember con-\n\nversing with him after the 1954 Queen\n\nCatherine (sic) Cup Race on the second Watkins\n\nGlen Circuit. A brake line had failed on\n\nthe Siata at the end of the long, fast,\n\ndownhill straight leading to the sharp\n\nTownsend Corner which had no escape road.\n\nDownshifting at astronomical engine revs,\n\nhe finished up in an orchard, without run-\n\nning into the spectators. Kenny laconical-\n\nly said, \"It was most disconcerting\".\n\nKenny entered a Triumph at Sebring in 1955\n\nbut was on the reserve list. He practiced\n\nfor the race but officialdom failed to tell\n\nhim whether to start or not. So Kenny lin-\n\ned up, started and was quickly flagged in.\n\nTwo months later he took his final check-\n\nered flag after a short illness. His pass-\n\ning left a void which I for one, feel has\n\nnever been filled.\n\n[The Siata arrived in Buffalo in late 1952. It was painted red with green seats. \"It has quick-change wire wheels, a special five-speed gear box, a spare tire behind the two small seats, and a windshield only ten inches high. The engine is specially built and specially tuned for the sports car race at MacDill Field, Tampa, Fla., on February 21st in which the owner will drive.\"]\n\nRGDS RLT\n\nTop Cars to Race at New Track\n\nBy DAVID LANCASHIRE\n\nEdenvale airfield, an abandoned\n\nstretch of asphalt serving as the\n\nbase of sports car racing in On-\n\ntario, will be developed this\n\nspring into the second biggest\n\nautomobile track in North Amer-\n\nica, directors of the new Stayner\n\nSpeedway announced yesterday.\n\nThe mile-and-a-half speedway,\n\nrebuilt and resurfaced will be in\n\noperation May 19. It is 79 miles\n\nfrom Toronto.\n\nBleachers and additional facil-\n\nities will be installed during the\n\nsummer, at an estimated cost of\n\n$1,500,000, in time for a 500-mile\n\nIndianapolis-style race with U.S.\n\ndrivers in August.\n\n\"This will be the home of the\n\nfirst truly international race any-\n\nwhere in the world.\" said Hugh\n\nGreen, ex-racing driver and presi-\n\ndent of the Stayner Speedway.\n\nThe track, on No. 26 Highway\n\nnorth of Barrie, will be expanded\n\nto a 2.5-mile stretch in 1957, when\n\nit is hoped that European and\n\nSouth American cars and drivers\n\nwill be brought in to compete for\n\nthe first time on equal terms with\n\nthe Indianapolis cars.\n\n\"It's better than the track at\n\nSebring, Florida, now.\" said\n\nDuane Carter, racing director for\n\nthe U.S. Auto Club. The 43-year-\n\nold Indianapolis driver made a\n\ntour of the course yesterday\n\nafternoon as consultant for the\n\nspeedway company.\n\nPlans for Canada's first big-\n\ncar development were unrolled\n\nat a press conference where\n\nGreen said that the track which\n\nwill eventually accommodate\n\n60,000 spectators, was being de-\n\nsigned and developed with the\n\nco-operation of the Indianapolis\n\nSpeedway.\n\nThe oval dog-legged course\n\nwill have unbanked left turns\n\nwide enough to permit cornering\n\nby the big Indianapolis cars at\n\ntheir maximum effective speed of\n\n80 miles per hour. The flat bends\n\nwill put the U.S. racers on equal\n\nfooting with European drivers,\n\nunaccustomed to driving on bowl-\n\nlike tracks.\n\n\"Ferraris, Maseratis, Jaguars\n\nand so on have never really com-\n\npeted with American Offen-\n\nhauser-type cars.\" said a Stayner\n\nspokesman. \"The Americans re-\n\nfuse to race on European roads,\n\nand the Europeans won't come to\n\nU.S. tracksâthey'd both be at a\n\ndisadvantage.\n\n\"This will be new territory for\n\nboth of them, and the first chance\n\nto match the styles. It'll be a\n\ncombination Indianapolis and\n\nGrand Prix course.\"\n\nCarter added that big-league\n\nU.S. drivers would jump at the\n\nchance of competing here, ex-\n\nplaining that there are only 12\n\ntracks available in the United\n\nStates for the oversized racing\n\ncars. Purses here, at the outset,\n\nwould be roughly two-thirds of\n\nthose offered at the Indianapolis\n\n500, said Green.\n\nDates already arranged for by\n\nsports car clubs will be honored\n\nsaid Green, and individual car\n\nclubs will be eligible to use the\n\ntrack. The speedway firm has\n\nleased the airfield property for\n\ntwo years, at an undisclosed rate\n\nwith an option to purchase.\n\nBig-car racing will be a change\n\nfrom sports competition seen\n\nso far at Edenvale.\n\nThe highly specialised U.S.\n\nmachines, used purely for racing,\n\nburn high octane gas doctored\n\nwith such things as nitroglycerin.\n\nOffenhauser engines develop at\n\nfull capacity 300 to 400 horse-\n\npower.\n\nA typical sports car like an\n\nMG-TD has an engine that is\n\nroughly 40 per cent the size of\n\nthe 500 cars and develops up to\n\n60 horsepower.\n\nWith sanction of the U.S. club\n\nthe firm will line up events for\n\nthe summer.
