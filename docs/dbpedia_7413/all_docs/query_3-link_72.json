        "text": "Lunceford in 1946\n\nJames Melvin “Jimmie” Lunceford (June 6, 1902 – July 12, 1947) was an American jazzalto saxophonist and bandleader in the swing era.\n\nBiography\n\nLunceford was born in Fulton, Mississippi. Little is known about his parents, though his father was a choirmaster in Warren, Ohio, before the family moved to Denver. Lunceford went to high school in Denver and studied music under Wilberforce J. Whiteman, father of Paul Whiteman, whose band was soon to acquire a national reputation. As a child in Denver, he learned several instruments. He played alto saxophone in the band led by the violinist George Morrison. After high school, Lunceford continued his studies at Fisk University. In 1922, he played alto saxophone in a local band led by George Morrison which included Andy Kirk, another musician destined for fame as a bandleader.\n\nCareer\n\nIn 1927, while an athletic instructor at Manassas High School in Memphis, Tennessee, he organized a student band, the Chickasaw Syncopators, whose name was changed to the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra. Under the new name, the band started its professional career in 1929, and made its first recordings in 1930. Lunceford was the first high school band director in Memphis. After a period of touring, the band accepted a booking at the Harlem nightclub The Cotton Club in 1934 for their revue ‘Cotton Club Parade’ starring Adelaide Hall. The Cotton Club had already featured Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway, who won their first widespread fame from their inventive shows for the Cotton Club’s all-white patrons. Lunceford’s orchestra, with their tight musicianship and the often outrageous humor in their music and lyrics, made an ideal band for the club, and Lunceford’s reputation began to steadily grow. The Jimmie Lunceford band differed from other great bands of the time because their work was better known for its ensemble than its solo work. Additionally, he was known for using a two-beat rhythm, called the Lunceford two-beat, as opposed to the standard four-beat rhythm.</ref> This distinctive “Lunceford style” was largely the result of the imaginative arrangements by trumpeter Sy Oliver, which set high standards for dance-band arrangers of the time.\n\nThough not well known as a musician, Jimmie Lunceford was trained on several instruments and was even featured on flute in “Liza”.\n\nComedy and vaudeville played a distinct part in Lunceford’s presentation. Songs such as “Rhythm Is Our Business”, “I’m Nuts about Screwy Music”, “I Want the Waiter (With the Water)”, and “Four or Five Times” displayed a playful sense of swing, often through clever arrangements by trumpeter Sy Oliver and bizarre lyrics. Lunceford’s stage shows often included costumes, skits, and obvious jabs at mainstream white jazz bands, such as Paul Whiteman’s and Guy Lombardo‘s.\n\nDespite the band’s comic veneer, Lunceford always maintained professionalism in the music befitting a former teacher; this professionalism paid off and during the apex of swing in the 1930s, the Orchestra was considered the equal of Duke Ellington‘s, Earl Hines‘ or Count Basie‘s. This precision can be heard in such pieces as “Wham (Re-Bop-Boom-Bam)”, “Lunceford Special”, “For Dancers Only”, “Uptown Blues”, and “Stratosphere”. The band’s noted saxophone section was led by alto sax player Willie Smith. Lunceford often used a conducting baton to lead his band.\n\nThe orchestra began recording for the Decca label and later signed with the Columbia subsidiary Vocalion in 1938. They toured Europeextensively in 1937, but had to cancel a second tour in 1939 because of the outbreak of World War II. Columbia dropped Lunceford in 1940 because of flagging sales. (Oliver departed the group before the scheduled European tour to take a position as an arranger forTommy Dorsey). Lunceford returned to the Decca label. The orchestra appeared in the 1941 movie Blues in the Night.\n\nMost of Lunceford’s sidemen were underpaid and left for better paying bands, leading to the band’s decline.\n\nDeath\n\nOn July 12, 1947, while playing in Seaside, Oregon, Lunceford collapsed and died from cardiac arrest during an autograph session, aged 45. Allegations and rumors circulated that he had been poisoned by a fish-restaurant owner who was unhappy at having to serve a “Negro” in his establishment. This story is given credence by the fact other members of Lunceford’s band who ate at this restaurant were sick within hours of the meal.[citation needed] He was buried at Elmwood Cemetery in Memphis.\n\nLegacy\n\nBand members, notably Eddie Wilcox and Joe Thomas kept the band going for a time but finally had to break up the Jimmie Lunceford Orchestra in 1949.\n\nIn 1999, band-leader Robert Veen and a team of musicians set out to acquire permission to use the original band charts and arrangements of the Jimmie Lunceford canon. ‘The Jimmie Lunceford Legacy Orchestra’ officially debuted in July 2005 at the North Sea Jazz Festival in the Netherlands.\n\nThe Jimmie Lunceford Jamboree Festival was founded in 2007 by Ron Herd II a.k.a. R2C2H2 Tha Artivist and Artstorian, with the aim of increasing recognition of Lunceford’s contribution to jazz, particularly in Memphis, Tennessee. The Jimmie Lunceford Legacy Awards was created by the Jimmie Lunceford Jamboree Festival to honor exceptional musicians with Memphis ties as well as those who have dedicated their careers to excellence in music and music education.\n\nOn July 19, 2009, a brass note was dedicated to Lunceford on Beale Street, Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nSelected discography\n\nPrior to Lunceford’s success on Decca (beginning September 1934), he made the following recordings:\n\n“In Dat Mornin'”/”Sweet Rhythm” (Victor V-38141)- recorded Memphis, June 6, 1930\n\n“Flaming Reeds and Screaming Brass”/”While Love Lasts” (Columbia tests – not issued until the late 1960s on LP) – recorded New York, May 15, 1933\n\n“Jazznocracy”/”Chillen”, Get Up (Victor 24522)\n\n“White Heat”/”Leaving Me” (Victor 24586) – both recorded New York, January 26, 1934\n\n“Breakfast Ball”/”Here Goes” (Victor 24601)\n\n“Swingin’ Uptown”/”Remember When” (Victor 24669) – both recorded New York, March 20, 1934\n\n“White Heat”, backed with “Jazznocracy” was issued by Bluebird (5713A) (1/16/1934)\n\nJack Teagarden\n\nPhoto by Ralph F. Seghers Background information Birth name Weldon Leo “Jack” Teagarden Born August 20, 1905\n\nVernon, Texas Died January 15, 1964 (aged 58)\n\nNew Orleans, Louisiana Genres Jazz Occupations Bandleader, trombonist, composer, vocalist Instruments trombone, vocalist Years active 1927–1964 Associated acts Peck Kelley\n\nLouis Armstrong\n\nEarl Hines\n\nBenny Goodman\n\nBix Beiderbecke\n\nGlenn Miller\n\nPaul Whiteman\n\nWeldon Leo “Jack” Teagarden (August 20, 1905 – January 15, 1964), known as “Big T” and “The Swingin’ Gate”, was a jazztrombonist, bandleader, composer, and vocalist, regarded as the “Father of Jazz Trombone”.\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn in Vernon, Texas, his brothers Charlie and Clois “Cub” and his sister Norma also became noted professional musicians. Teagarden’s father was an amateur brass band trumpeter and started young Jack on baritone horn; by age seven he had switched totrombone. His first public performances were in movie theaters, where he accompanied his mother, a pianist.\n\nCareer\n\nTeagarden’s trombone style was largely self-taught, and he developed many unusual alternative positions and novel special effects on the instrument. He is usually considered the most innovative jazz trombone stylist of the pre-bebop era, and did much to expand the role of the instrument beyond the old tailgate style role of the early New Orleans brass bands. Chief among his contributions to the language of jazz trombonists was his ability to interject the blues or merely a “blue feeling” into virtually any piece of music.\n\nBy 1920 Teagarden was playing professionally in San Antonio, including with the band of pianist Peck Kelley. In the mid-1920s he started traveling widely around the United States in a quick succession of different bands. In 1927, he went to New York City where he worked with several bands. By 1928 he played for the Ben Pollack band.\n\nWithin a year of the commencement of his recording career, he became a regular vocalist, first doing blues material (“Beale Street Blues”, for example), and later doing popular songs. He is often mentioned as one of the best white male jazz vocalists of the era; his singing style is quite like his trombone playing, in terms of improvisation (in the same way that Louis Armstrong sang quite like he played trumpet). His singing is best remembered for duets with Louis Armstrong and Johnny Mercer.\n\nIn the late 1920s he recorded with such notable bandleaders and sidemen as Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, Bix Beiderbecke,Red Nichols, Jimmy McPartland, Mezz Mezzrow, Glenn Miller, and Eddie Condon. Glenn Miller and Teagarden collaborated to provide lyrics and a verse to Spencer Williams’ Basin Street Blues, which in that amended form became one of the numbers that Teagarden played until the end of his days.\n\nIn the early 1930s Teagarden was based in Chicago, for some time playing with the band of Wingy Manone. He played at the Century of Progress exposition in Chicago. Teagarden sought financial security during the Great Depression and signed an exclusive contract to play for the Paul Whiteman Orchestra from 1933 through 1938. The contract with Whiteman’s band provided him with financial security but prevented him from playing an active part in the musical advances of the mid-thirties swing era.\n\nTeagarden then started leading his own big band. Glenn Miller wrote the song “I Swung the Election” for him and his band in 1939.[3] In spite of Teagarden’s best efforts, the band was not a commercial success, and he was brought to the brink of bankruptcy.\n\nIn 1946 Teagarden joined Louis Armstrong‘s All Stars. Armstrong and Teagarden’s work together shows a wonderful rapport, in particular their duet on “Rockin’ Chair”. In late 1951 Teagarden left to again lead his own band, then co-led a band with Earl Hines, then again with a group under his own name with whom he toured Japan in 1958 and 1959.\n\nFrom left: Jack Teagarden, Sandy DeSantis, Velma Middleton, Fraser MacPherson, Cozy Cole, Arvell Shaw,Earl Hines, Barney Bigard at Palomar Supper Club, Vancouver B.C. (March 17, 1951)\n\nTeagarden appeared in the movies Birth of the Blues (1941), The Strip (1951), The Glass Wall (1953), and Jazz on a Summer’s Day (1960), the latter a documentary film of the 1958 Newport Jazz Festival. He was an admired recording artist, featured on RCA Victor, Columbia,Decca, Capitol, and MGM Records discs. As a jazz artist he won the 1944 Esquire magazine Gold Award, was highly rated in theMetronome polls of 1937-42 and 1945, and was selected for the Playboy magazine All Star Band, 1957-60.\n\nTeagarden was the featured performer at the Newport Jazz Festival of 1957. Saturday Review wrote in 1964 that he “walked with artistic dignity all his life,” and the same year Newsweek praised his “mature approach to trombone jazz.”\n\nRichard M. Sudhalter writes (in ‘Lost Chords: White Musicians and Their Contribution to Jazz’, Oxford University Press, 1999): “The late trumpet player Don Goldie, who spent four years in Teagarden’s band and had known him since childhood said that he ‘always got a feeling that a lot of happiness was locked away inside Jack, really padlocked, and never came out…”\n\n“Jack Teagarden died, alone, of a heart attack complicated by bronchial pneumonia in his room at the Prince Conti Hotel in the French Quarter of New Orleans on January 15, 1964. He was only 58. “I sometimes think people like Jack were just go-betweens,” Bobby Hackett told a friend. “The Good Lord said, ‘Now you go and show ’em what it is’, and he did. I think everybody familiar with Jack Teagarden knows that he was something that happens just once. It won’t happen again. Not that way…”\n\n“…Connie Jones, the New Orleans cornetist working with Jack Teagarden at the time of the trombonist’s death, was a pallbearer for the wake, held at a funeral parlor on leafy St. Charles Avenue: ‘I remember seeing him there in a coffin, a travelling coffin. They were going to fly him to Los Angeles for burial right after that. The coffin was open and I remember thinking ‘Boy he really looks uncomfortable in there’.\n\n“‘Not that he was that tall. Maybe five foot ten or so, at most. But he was kinda wide across the shoulders – and most of all he just gave you the impression he was a big man, in every way. In that coffin, – well, I can’t really explain it, but he seemed to be scrunched up into a space that was too small to contain him'”.\n\nHe was buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles, California.\n\nThe coda of Teagarden’s recording career is the album Think Well of Me, recorded in January 1962 and made up of his singing and trombone playing, accompanied by strings, on compositions by his old musical associate Willard Robison: available on Verve CD 314 557 101-2.\n\nCompositions\n\n“‘Jack-Armstrong’ Blues” by the V-Disc All Stars featuring Jack Teagarden and Louis Armstrong, V-Disc 384A, Hot Jazz, U.S. War Department release, March, 1945.\n\nJack Teagarden’s compositions included “I’ve Got ‘It'” with David Rose, “Shake Your Hips”, “Big T Jump”, “Swingin’ on the Teagarden Gate”, “Blues After Hours”, “A Jam Session at Victor”, “It’s So Good”, “Pickin’ For Patsy” with Allan Reuss, “Texas Tea Party” withBenny Goodman, “I’m Gonna Stomp Mr. Henry Lee” with Eddie Condon, “Big T Blues”, “Dirty Dog”, “Makin’ Friends” with Jimmy McPartland, “That’s a Serious Thing”, and “‘Jack-Armstrong’ Blues” with Louis Armstrong, recorded on December 7, 1944 with the V-Disc All-Stars and released as V-Disc 384A in March, 1945.\n\nHonors\n\nIn 1969, Jack Teagarden was inducted into the Down Beat Jazz Hall of Fame. He was inducted into the Big Band and Jazz Hall of Fame in 1985. Other honors have included induction in the ASCAP Jazz Wall of Fame in 2005 and inclusion in the Houston Institute for Culture’s Texas Music Hall of Fame.\n\nSelected filmography\n\nBirth of the Blues (1941)\n\nHoagy Carmichael\n\nHoagy Carmichael Background information Birth name Howard Hoagland Carmichael Born November 22, 1899\n\nBloomington, Indiana Died December 27, 1981 (aged 82)\n\nRancho Mirage, California Genres Musical films, Popular songs Occupations attorney, songwriter, singer,actor Instruments piano, vocals Years active 1918-1981 Associated acts Sidney Arodin, Louis Armstrong,Fred Astaire, Bix Biederbecke,Ray Charles, Bing Crosby,Jimmy Dorsey, Tommy Dorsey,Duke Ellington, Helen Forrest,Harry James, Spike Jones, Frank Loesser, Johnny Mercer, Glenn Miller, Dinah Shore, Paul Whiteman Website Hoagy Carmichael\n\n“Hoagy” Carmichael (born Howard Hoagland Carmichael; November 22, 1899 – December 27, 1981) was an American composer,pianist, singer, actor, and bandleader. He is best known for composing the music for “Stardust“, “Georgia on My Mind“, “The Nearness of You“, and “Heart and Soul“, four of the most-recorded American songs of all time.\n\nAmerican composer and author Alec Wilder wrote of Carmichael in American Popular Song: The Great Innovators, 1900–1950 that he was the “most talented, inventive, sophisticated and jazz-oriented” of the hundreds of writers composing pop songs in the first half of the 20th century.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nCarmichael’s house in Bloomington\n\nBorn in Bloomington, Indiana, Carmichael was the only son of Howard Clyde Carmichael, of Scottish ancestry,[citation needed] and Lida Mary (Robison). He was named Hoagland after a circus troupe “The Hoaglands” who stayed at the Carmichael house during his mother’s pregnancy. Howard was a horse-drawn taxi driver and electrician, and Lida a versatile pianist who played accompaniment at silent movies and for parties. The family moved frequently, as Howard sought better employment for his growing family. At six, Carmichael started to sing and play the piano, absorbing easily his mother’s keyboard skills. By high school, the piano was the focus of his after-school life, and for inspiration he would listen to ragtime pianists Hank Wells and Hube Hanna. At eighteen, the small, wiry, pale Carmichael was living in Indianapolis, trying to help his family’s income working in manual jobs in construction, a bicycle chain factory, and a slaughterhouse. The bleak time was partly spelled by four-handed piano duets with his mother and by his strong friendship with Reg DuValle, black bandleader and pianist known as “the elder statesman of Indiana jazz” and “the Rhythm King”, who taught him piano jazz improvisation. The death of his three-year-old sister in 1918 affected him deeply, and he wrote “My sister Joanne—the victim of poverty. We couldn’t afford a good doctor or good attention, and that’s when I vowed I would never be broke again in my lifetime.” She may have died from influenza, which had swept the world that year. Carmichael earned his first money ($5.00) as a musician playing at a fraternity dance that year and began his musical career.\n\nCarmichael attended Indiana University and the Indiana University School of Law, where he received his Bachelor’s degree in 1925 and a law degree in 1926. He was a member of the Kappa Sigma fraternity and played the piano all around the state with his “Collegians” to support his studies. He met, befriended, and played with Bix Beiderbecke, the cornetist, sometime pianist and fellow Mid-westerner. Under Beiderbecke’s spell, Carmichael started to play the cornet as well, but found that he didn’t have the lips for it, and only played it for a short while. He was also influenced by Beiderbecke’s impressionistic and classical musical ideas. On a visit to Chicago, Carmichael was introduced by Beiderbecke to Louis Armstrong, who was then playing with King Oliver’s Creole Jazz Band, and with whom he would collaborate later.\n\nHe began to compose songs, “Washboard Blues” and “Boneyard Shuffle” for Curtis Hitch, and also “Riverboat Shuffle“, recorded by Beiderbecke, which became a staple of jazz and Carmichael’s first recorded song. After graduating in 1926, he moved to Miami to join a local law firm but, failing the bar exam, returned to Indiana in 1927. He joined an Indiana law firm and passed the state bar, but devoted most of his energies to music, arranging band dates, and “writing tunes”. He had discovered his method of songwriting, which he described later: “You don’t write melodies, you find them…If you find the beginning of a good song, and if your fingers do not stray, the melody should come out of hiding in a short time.”\n\nEarly career\n\n“Stardust” recalled in the trailer forTo Have and Have Not\n\nLater in 1927, Carmichael’s career started off well. He finished and recorded one of his most famous songs, “Star Dust” (later renamed “Stardust”, with Mitchell Parish‘s lyrics added in 1929), at the Gennett Records studio in Richmond, Indiana, with Carmichael doing the piano solo. The song, an idiosyncratic melody in medium tempo – actually a song about a song – later became an American standard, recorded by hundreds of artists. Shortly thereafter, Carmichael got more recognition when Paul Whitemanrecorded “Washboard Blues“, with Carmichael playing and singing, and the Dorsey brothers and Bix Beiderbecke in the orchestra. Despite his growing prominence, at this stage Carmichael was still held back by his inability to sight-read and notate music properly, although he was innovative for the time. With coaching, he became more proficient at arranging his own music.\n\nHis first major song with his own lyrics was “Rockin’ Chair“, recorded by Armstrong and Mildred Bailey, and eventually with his own hand-picked studio band (featuring Bix, Bubber Miley, Benny Goodman, Tommy Dorsey, Bud Freeman, Eddie Lang, Joe Venuti, and Gene Krupa) on May 15, 1930. In the future, however, most of Carmichael’s successful songs would have lyrics provided by collaborators. After realizing that he missed making music and was not cut out to be a lawyer, Carmichael left his law practice for ever and started working with musicals in Hollywood. He stayed with Paul Whiteman’s orchestra for a while but no work came of it and he moved to New York City in the summer of 1929.\n\n1930s\n\nIn New York, Carmichael met Duke Ellington‘s agent and publisher Irving Mills and hired him to set up recording dates. In October 1929 the stock market crashed and Carmichael’s hard-earned savings declined substantially. Fortunately, Louis Armstrong then recorded “Rockin’ Chair” at Okeh studios, giving Carmichael a badly needed boost. He had begun to work at an investment house and was considering a switch in career when he composed “Georgia on My Mind” (lyrics by Stuart Gorrell), perhaps most famous in the Ray Charlesrendition recorded many years later.\n\nCarmichael composed and recorded “Up a Lazy River” in 1930 (lyrics by Sidney Arodin) and the first recorded version of “Stardust” with lyrics (by Mitchell Parish) was recorded byBing Crosby in 1931. He joined ASCAP in 1931 and began working for Ralph Peer’s Southern Music Company in 1932 as a songwriter, the first music firm to occupy the new Brill Building, famous as a New York songwriting mecca. It was a low-paying but steady job at a time when the Depression was having a harsh effect on live jazz performance and many musicians were out of work. Bix Beiderbecke’s early death also darkened Carmichael’s mood. Of that time, he wrote later: “I was tiring of jazz and I could see that other musicians were tiring as well. The boys were losing their enthusiasm for the hot stuff…No more hot licks, no more thrills.”\n\nThe elegy for hot jazz was premature, but Swing was just around the corner and jazz would soon turn in another direction, with new bandleaders such as the Dorseys and Benny Goodman, and new singers such as Frank Sinatra leading the way. Carmichael’s output soon would be heading in that direction. In 1933 he began his collaboration with newly arrived lyricist Johnny Mercer on “Thanksgiving”, “Moon Country”, and “Lazybones“, which was a smash hit, selling over 350,000 copies in three months. Carmichael’s financial condition improved dramatically as royalties started to pour in, affording him a comfortable apartment and dapper clothes. So did his social life, finding him hobnobbing with George Gershwin, Fred Astaire, Duke Ellington, and other music giants in the New York scene.\n\nCarmichael started to emerge as a solo singer-performer, first at parties, then professionally. He described his unique, laconic voice as being “the way a shaggy dog looks.… I have Wabash fog and sycamore twigs in my throat.” Some fans were dismayed as he steadily veered away from hot jazz, but recordings by Louis Armstrong continued to “jazz up” Carmichael’s popular songs. In 1935 he left Ralph Peer’s Southern Music Company and started composing songs for a division of Warner Brothers, establishing his connection with Hollywood. His song “Moonburn”, his first movie song, appeared in the film version of Anything Goes.\n\nIn 1935 Carmichael married preacher’s daughter Ruth Menardi. He moved to California and accepted a contract with Paramount for $1,000 a week, joining other songwriters working for the Hollywood studios, including Harry Warren (Warners), E. Y. Harburg (MGM), Ralph Rainger and Leo Robin at Paramount. Soon, the Carmichaels were accepted members of the affluent Hollywood community. In 1937 Carmichael appeared in the movie Topper, serenading Cary Grant and Constance Bennett with his song “Old Man Moon”.\n\nIn 1937 he wrote the song “Chimes of Indiana”, which was presented to Indiana University as a gift by the class of 1935. It was made the school’s official co-alma mater in 1978.\n\nWith Paramount lyricist Frank Loesser, Carmichael wrote “Two Sleepy People” in 1938. Around the same time he composed “Heart and Soul“, “Small Fry“, and “I Get Along Without You Very Well (Except Sometimes)” (premiered by Dick Powell in a radio broadcast). However, countering these successes, Carmichael’s and Mercer’s Broadway score for Walk With Music was unsuccessful. In 1939, Hoagy Bix, the Carmichaels’ first child, was born.\n\n1940s\n\nHoagy Carmichael at piano, withLauren Bacall in To Have and Have Not\n\nThe growing Carmichael family was thriving in Los Angeles in the former mansion of chewing-gum heir William P. Wrigley, Jr., when America entered World War II after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Hoagy Carmichael maintained a strong personal and professional relationship with Johnny Mercer. That continuing collaboration led to “Skylark” in 1942, recorded almost immediately by Glenn Miller, Dinah Shore, and Helen Forrest (with Harry James). In 1943, Carmichael returned to the movies and played “Cricket” in the screen adaptation of Ernest Hemingway‘sTo Have and Have Not, opposite Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall, where he sang “Hong Kong Blues” and “The Rhumba Jumps”, and played piano as Bacall sang “How Little We Know”. He also contributed to the 1941 Max Fleischer animated film, Mister Bug Goes to Town (later reissued as Hoppity Goes To Town).\n\nCarmichael and Harold Russell play a duet inThe Best Years of Our Lives as Fredric Marchwatches\n\nCarmichael appeared as an actor in a total of 14 motion pictures, always performing at least one of his songs, including Young Man with a Horn (based on friend Bix Beiderbecke‘s life) with Bacall and Kirk Douglas, and multi-Academy Award winner The Best Years of Our Lives with Myrna Loy and Fredric March), in which he teaches a disabled veteran with metal prostheses to play “Chop Sticks”. He described his screen persona as the “hound-dog-faced old musical philosopher noodling on the honky-tonk piano, saying to a tart with a heart of gold: “He’ll be back, honey. He’s all man”.”\n\nWhen composing, Carmichael was incessant. According to his son Randy, he worked over a song for days or even weeks until it was perfect. His perfectionism extended to his clothes, grooming, and eating as well. Once the work was done, however, Carmichael would cut loose—relax, play golf, drink, and indulge in the Hollywood high life.\n\nCarmichael was a Republican supporter and anti-FDR, voting for Wendell Wilkie for president in 1940, and was often aghast at the left-leaning political views of his friends in Hollywood. His contribution to the war effort was similar to other patriotic efforts by Irving Berlin (“This Is the Army, Mr. Jones”), Johnny Mercer (“G.I. Jive“), and Frank Loesser (“Praise the Lord and Pass the Ammunition“). Carmichael’s war time songs (most with lyrics by Paul Francis Webster) included “My Christmas Song for You”, “Don’t Forget to Say ‘No’ Baby”, “Billy-a-Dick”, “The Army of Hippocrates”, “Cranky Old Yank”, “Eager Beaver”, “No More Toujours l’Amour”, “Morning Glory”, and the never completed “Hitler Blues”.[18] He regularly performed on USO shows.\n\nCarmichael’s 1943 song “I’m a Cranky Old Yank in a Clanky Old Tank on the Streets of Yokohama with my Honolulu Mama Doin’ Those Beat-o, Beat-o Flat-On-My-Seat-o, Hirohito Blues” is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the song with the longest title. However Carmichael admitted it was a joke; the title was intended to end with the word ‘Yank’.\n\nBetween 1944 and 1948, Carmichael was the host of three musical variety radio programs. In 1944–45, the 30-minute Tonight at Hoagy’s aired on Mutual Sunday nights at 8:30 pm (Pacific time), sponsored by Safeway supermarkets. Produced by Walter Snow, the show featured Carmichael as host and vocalist. The musicians included Pee Wee Hunt and Joe Venuti. Fans were rather blunt about his singing, with comments like “you can’t sing for sour owl” and “your singing is so delightfully awful that it is really funny”. NBC carried the 30-minute Something New at 6 pm (Pacific time) on Mondays in 1945–46. All of the musicians in this show’s band, called the “Teenagers”, were between the ages of 16 and 19. Carol Stewart and Gale Robbins were the vocalists and comedy was supplied by Pinky Lee and the team of Bob Sweeney and Hal March, later of quiz show fame. The Hoagy Carmichael Show was broadcast by CBS from October 26, 1946 until June 26, 1948. Luden’s Cough Drops sponsored the 15-minute program until June 1947.\n\nIn 1948 Carmichael composed a piece called Brown County in Autumn, a nine-minute tone poem which was not well received by critics.\n\n1950s\n\n“In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening“, with lyrics by Johnny Mercer, featured in 1951’s Here Comes the Groom, won Carmichael his first Academy Award for Best Original Song, and Mercer his second of four. In 1952, he played his composition My Resistance Is Low in the movie The Las Vegas Story. The lyrics were written by Harold Adamson for this Howard Hughes film. The song did not catch fire in the U.S. but was a hit in Britain.\n\nCarmichael sharing the Saturday Night Revue duties with George Gobel\n\nIn the early 1950s, variety shows were particularly popular on television. Carmichael hosted Saturday Night Review in June 1953, a summer replacement series for Your Show of Shows, but found the pressure too intense and did not return the following summer. About 1955, Carmichael reprised the Dooley Wilson role in a short-lived television adaptation of Casablanca on Warner Brothers Presents, playing Sam the piano player.\n\nAmong his numerous television roles, Carmichael guest starred with Keenan Wynn, Anthony George, and Olive Carey in the 1956 episode “Death in the Snow” of the NBC anthology series, The Joseph Cotten Show. He was thereafter a regular on NBC’s Laramie western series (1959–1963) with John Smith and Robert Fuller, co-starred in The Helen Morgan Story on CBS‘s Playhouse 90 (1957) and provided the voice for a stone-age parody of himself, “Stoney Carmichael”, in an episode of ABC‘s The Flintstones, which aired in September 1961. On June 15, 1961, he appeared in one of the final episodes of NBC’s The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford.\n\nCarmichael composed seven songs for Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (1954) but only two made the final cut: “Ain’t There Anyone Here for Love” and “When Love Goes Wrong (Nothing Goes Right)”, with Jane Russell singing the former. Both songs’ lyrics were written by Harold Campbell Adamson.\n\nAs rock and roll emerged in the mid-1950s, the music industry found less commercial appeal in his new songs. As his song writing career started to ebb, Carmichael’s marriage dissolved. Secure with royalties from his past hits he wrote some songs for children.\n\nLater years\n\nIn 1960, Ray Charles‘ version of “Georgia on My Mind” was a major hit, receiving Grammys both for Best Male Vocal and Best Popular Single. Carmichael’s rediscovery, however, did little for such new output as “The Ballad of Sam Older”, “A Perfect Paris Night”, “Behold, How Beautiful”, “Bamboo Curtains”, and “Close Beside You”, which were all but ignored by the recording industry. For his September 15, 1961, animated guest appearance in “The Hit Songwriters” episode of The Flintstones, Hoagy wrote and performed a song created especially for the show, “Yabba-Dabba-Dabba-Dabba-Doo”. Jerry Lee Lewis recorded “Hong Kong Blues” during his final Sun sessions in 1963, but it was never released. In 1964, while The Beatles were exploding on the scene, Carmichael lamented, “I’ll betcha I have twenty-five songs lying in my trunk” and no one was calling to say “have you got a real good song for such-and such an artist”. Still, royalties on his standards were earning Carmichael over $300,000 a year. Former-Beatle George Harrison recorded two of Carmichael’s songs (“Baltimore Oriole” and “Hong Kong Blues”) for his 1981 LP Somewhere in England.\n\nHis attempt to compose movie scores failed when his score for Hatari! was replaced by that of Henry Mancini, although his song “Just for Tonight” (a re-working of “A Perfect Paris Night”) is used in the film. With the Johnny Appleseed Suite, Carmichael once again tried his hand at a longer musical composition, but the episodic treatment lacked the compositional unity and momentum of works such as George Gershwin‘s Rhapsody in Blue. By 1967, Carmichael was spending time back in New York but was still unsuccessful with his new songs.\n\nCarmichael was inducted into the USA’s Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1971 along with Duke Ellington. The 1970s went by with little musical success and fewer people recognizing him in public. With the help and encouragement of his son Hoagy Bix, Carmichael participated in the PBS television show Hoagy Carmichael’s Music Shop, which featured jazz-rock versions of his hits. He appeared on Fred Rogers PBS show Old Friends, New Friends. With time on his hands, he resumed painting.\n\nIn 1972 Indiana University awarded Carmichael an honorary doctorate in music.\n\nIn 1977 he married Dorothy Wanda McKay. On his 80th birthday two years later Carmichael was reflective, observing, “I’m a bit disappointed in myself. I know I could have accomplished a hell of a lot more… I could write anything any time I wanted to. But I let other things get in the way… I’ve been floating around in the breeze.”[28] Shortly before his death, Carmichael appeared on a UK-recorded tribute album, In Hoagland (1981), together with Annie Ross and Georgie Fame.\n\nCarmichael died of heart failure in Rancho Mirage, California, on December 27, 1981. He is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Bloomington.\n\nPaul Whiteman\n\nPaul Whiteman and his orchestra in 1921. Photo from the sheet music issue of the band’s early hit recording Wang Wang Blues Background information Birth name Paul Samuel Whiteman Born March 28, 1890 Origin Denver, Colorado, U.S. Died December 29, 1967(aged 77) Genres Jazz Occupations Bandleader\n\nComposer Instruments Violin Associated acts Bix Beiderbecke\n\nFrankie Trumbauer\n\nJoe Venuti\n\nEddie Lang\n\nPaul Samuel Whiteman (March 28, 1890 – December 29, 1967) was an American bandleader and orchestral director.Leader of one of the most popular dance bands in the United States during the 1920s, Whiteman produced recordings that were immensely successful, and press notices often referred to him as the “King of Jazz”. (When the term was more loosely defined: referring to practically any popular music with African-American attributes or influences.) Using a large ensemble and exploring many styles of music, Whiteman is perhaps best known for his blending of symphonic music and jazz, as typified by his 1924 commissioning and debut of George Gershwin‘s jazz-influenced “Rhapsody In Blue“. Later, Whiteman’s work on Symphonic Jazz influenced many jazz musicians either way – directly or indirectly – as diverse as Miles Davis, Gil Evans, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Winton Marsalis and other modern artists. Whiteman recorded many jazz and pop standards during his career, including “Wang Wang Blues“, “Mississippi Mud“, “Rhapsody in Blue“, “Wonderful One“, “Hot Lips (He’s Got Hot Lips When He Plays Jazz)“, “Mississippi Suite“, and “Grand Canyon Suite“. His popularity faded in the swing music era of the 1930s, and by the 1940s Whiteman was semi-retired from music.\n\nWhiteman’s place in the history of early jazz is somewhat controversial. Detractors suggest that Whiteman’s ornately-orchestrated music was jazz in name only (lacking the genre’s improvisational and emotional depth), and co-opted the innovations of black musicians. Defenders note that Whiteman’s fondness for jazz was genuine (he worked with black musicians as much as was feasible during an era of racial segregation), that his bands included many of the era’s most esteemed white jazz musicians, and argue that Whiteman’s groups handled jazz admirably as part of a larger repertoire. In his autobiography, Duke Ellington declared, “Paul Whiteman was known as the King of Jazz, and no one as yet has come near carrying that title with more certainty and dignity.”\n\nEarly life and career\n\nBiography\n\nWhiteman was born in Denver, Colorado. He began his career by playing the viola in the Denver Symphony Orchestra from 1907 and in the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra from 1914. From 1917 to 1918, Whiteman conducted a 40-piece U.S. Navy band. After the war, he formed the Paul Whiteman Orchestra. Moreover, with his classical violinist and violiststart, he led a jazz-influenced dance band, which became popular locally in San Francisco, California in 1918. In 1920 he moved with his band to New York City where they started recording for the Victor Talking Machine Company which made the Paul Whiteman Orchestra famous nationally. (In his first five recordings sessions for Victor, Aug 9-Oct 28, 1920, Whiteman used the name “Paul Whiteman and His Ambassador Orchestra,” presumably because he had been playing at the Ambassador Hotel in Atlantic City; from Nov. 3, 1920, he started using “Paul Whiteman and His Orchestra.\n\nWhiteman became the most popular band director of that decade. In a time when most dance bands consisted of six to 10 men, Whiteman directed a much larger and more imposing group of up to 35 musicians. By 1922, Whiteman already controlled some 28 ensembles on the east coast and was earning over a $1,000,000 a year.\n\nHe recorded Hoagy Carmichael singing and playing “Washboard Blues” to the accompaniment of his orchestra in 1927.\n\nIn May 1928 Whiteman signed with Columbia Records, and recorded for the label until September 1931, when he returned to RCA Victor. He would remain with Victor until March 1937.\n\nIn the early sixties, Whiteman played in Las Vegas before retiring.\n\n“The King of Jazz”\n\nPaul Whiteman in Scheveningen (1926)\n\nIn the 1920s the media referred to Whiteman as “The King of Jazz”. Whiteman emphasized the way he had approached the already well-established style of music, while also organizing its composition and style in his own fashion. While mostjazz musicians and fans consider improvisation to be essential to the musical style, Whiteman thought the genre could be improved by orchestrating the best of it, with formal written arrangements. There were musicians, such as Eddie Condon, who criticized Whiteman for being a bad influence on the music due to his attempts to “make a lady” out of jazz. However, Whiteman’s recordings were still popular critically and successful commercially, and his style of jazz was often the first jazz of any form that many Americans heard during the era. In all, the “King of Jazz” wrote more than 3000 arrangements.\n\nFor more than 30 years Whiteman, referred to as “Pops”, sought and encouraged musicians, vocalists, composers, arrangers, and entertainers who looked promising. In 1924 Whiteman commissioned George Gershwin‘s Rhapsody in Blue, which was premiered by Whiteman’s orchestra with George Gershwin at the piano. Another familiar piece in Whiteman’s repertoire was Grand Canyon Suite, by Ferde Grofé.\n\nWhiteman hired many of the best jazz musicians for his band, including Bix Beiderbecke, Frankie Trumbauer, Joe Venuti,Eddie Lang, Steve Brown, Mike Pingitore, Gussie Mueller, Wilbur Hall (billed by Whiteman as “Willie Hall”), Jack Teagarden, and Bunny Berigan. He also encouraged upcoming African American musical talents, and initially planned on hiring black musicians, but Whiteman’s management eventually persuaded him that doing so would be career suicide due to racial tension and America’s segregation of that time However, Whiteman crossed racial lines behind-the-scenes, hiring black arrangers like Fletcher Henderson and engaging in mutually-beneficial efforts with recording sessions and scheduling of tours.\n\nIn late 1926 Whiteman signed three candidates for his orchestra: Bing Crosby, Al Rinker, and Harry Barris. Whiteman billed the singing trio as The Rhythm Boys. Crosby’s prominence in the Rhythm Boys helped launch his career as one of the most successful singers of the 20th century. Paul Robeson (1928) and Billie Holiday (1942) also recorded with the Paul Whiteman Orchestra.\n\nWhiteman had 28 number one records during the 1920s and 32 during his career. At the height of his popularity, eight out of the top ten sheet music sales slots were by the Paul Whiteman Orchestra.\n\nHe provided music for six Broadway shows and produced more than 600 phonograph recordings.\n\nHis recording of José Padilla’s Valencia topped the charts for 11 weeks, beginning 30 March 1926, becoming the #1 record of 1926.\n\nWhiteman signed singer Mildred Bailey in 1929 to appear on his radio program. She first recorded with the Whiteman Orchestra in 1931.\n\nJazz musician and leader of the Mound City Blue Blowers Red McKenzie and cabaret singer Ramona Davies (billed as “Ramona and her Grand Piano”) joined the Whiteman group in 1932. The King’s Jesters were also with Paul Whiteman in 1931.\n\nfrom the trailer for the film Rhapsody in Blue(1945)\n\nIn 1933 Whiteman had a #2 hit on the Billboard charts with the song, “Willow Weep for Me“.\n\nIn 1934 Paul Whiteman had his last two #1 hits, “Smoke Gets in Your Eyes“, with vocals by Bob Lawrence, which was #1 for six weeks, and “Wagon Wheels”, which was #1 for one week, his final hit recording. From 1920 to 1934 Whiteman had 32 #1 recordings, charting 28 of them by 1929. By contrast, during the same period, the 1920s Jazz Age, Louis Armstrong had none.\n\nIn 1942 Whiteman began recording for Capitol Records, cofounded by songwriters Buddy DeSylva and Johnny Mercer and music store owner Glenn Wallichs. Whiteman and His Orchestra’s recordings of “I Found a New Baby” and “The General Jumped At Dawn” was the label’s first single release. (Another notable Capitol record he made is the 1942 “Trav’lin Light” featuring Billie Holiday(billed as “Lady Day”, due to her being under contract with another label).\n\nPersonal life\n\nWhiteman was married four times; to Nellie Stack in 1908; to Miss Jimmy Smith; to Mildred Vanderhoff in 1922. In 1931 Whiteman married motion picture actress Margaret Livingston following his divorce from Vanderhoff that same year. The marriage to Livingston lasted until his death.\n\nWhiteman resided at Walking Horse Farm near the village of Rosemont in Delaware Township, Hunterdon County, New Jersey from 1938 to 1959. After selling the farm to agriculturalist Lloyd Wescott, Whiteman moved to New Hope, Pennsylvania for his remaining years.\n\nMovie appearances\n\nIn 1930 “Paul Whiteman and his Orchestra” starred in the first feature-length movie musical filmed entirely in Technicolor, King of Jazz. The film was technically ahead of its time, with many dazzling camera effects complementing the Whiteman music. Whiteman appeared as himself, and good-naturedly kidded his weight and his dancing skills. A highlight was a concert rendition of Rhapsody in Blue. Unfortunately, by the time King of Jazz was released to theaters, audiences had seen too many “all-singing, all-dancing” musicals, and much of the moviegoing public stayed away. (It also didn’t help that the film was shot as a revue with no story and not particularly imaginative camerawork.) The expensive film didn’t show a profit until 1933, when it was successfully reissued to cash in on the popularity of 42nd Street and its elaborate production numbers.\n\nWhiteman also appeared as himself in the 1945 movie Rhapsody in Blue on the life and career of George Gershwin and also appeared in The Fabulous Dorseys in 1947, a bio-pic starring Jimmy Dorsey and Tommy Dorsey. Whiteman also appeared as the baby in Nertz (1929), the bandleader in Thanks a Million (1935), as himself in Strike Up the Band(1940), and in the Paramount Pictures short The Lambertville Story (1949).\n\nRadio and TV\n\nDuring the 1930s Whiteman had several radio shows, including Kraft Music Hall and Paul Whiteman’s Musical Varieties, which featured the talents of Bing Crosby, Mildred Bailey,Jack Teagarden, Johnny Mercer, Ramona, Durelle Alexander and others.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, after he had disbanded his orchestra, Whiteman worked as a music director for the ABC Radio Network. He also hosted Paul Whiteman’s TV Teen Club from Philadelphia on ABC-TV from 1949–1954. The show was seen for an hour the first two years, then as a half hour segment on Saturday evenings. In 1952 a young Dick Clark read the commercials for sponsor Tootsie Roll. He also continued to appear as guest conductor for many concerts. His manner on stage was disarming; he signed off each program with something casual like, “Well, that just about slaps the cap on the old milk bottle for tonight.”\n\nLegacy\n\nThe Paul Whiteman Orchestra introduced many jazz standards in the 1920s, including “Hot Lips”, which was in the Steven Spielberg movie The Color Purple (1985), “Mississippi Mud”, “From Monday On”, co-written and sung by Bing Crosby with Bix Beiderbecke on cornet, “Nuthin’ But”, “Grand Canyon Suite” and “Mississippi Suite” composed by Ferde Grofe, “Rhapsody in Blue”, composed by George Gershwin who played piano on the Paul Whiteman recording in 1924, “Wonderful One” (1923), and “Wang Wang Blues” (1920), covered by Glenn Miller, Duke Ellington, Benny Goodman, and Joe “King” Oliver‘s Dixie Syncopators in 1926 and many of the Big Bands. “Hot Lips” was recorded by Ted Lewisand His Jazz Band, Horace Heidt and His Brigadiers Orchestra (1937), Specht’s Jazz Outfit, the Cotton Pickers (1922), and Django Reinhardt Et Le Quintette Du Hot Club De France.\n\nHerb Alpert and Al Hirt were influenced by the Paul Whiteman Orchestra, particularly the solo work of trumpeter Henry Busse, especially his solo on “Rhapsody in Blue”.\n\nCompositions\n\nWhiteman composed the standard “Wonderful One” in 1922 with Ferde Grofé and Dorothy Terris (also known as Theodora Morse), based on a theme by film director Marshall Neilan. The songwriting credit is assigned as music composed by Paul Whiteman, Ferde Grofe, and Marshall Neilan, with lyrics by Dorothy Terriss. The single reached #3 on Billboard in May 1923, staying on the charts for 5 weeks. “(My) Wonderful One” was recorded by Gertrude Moody, Edward Miller, Martha Pryor, Mel Torme, Doris Day, Woody Herman, Helen Moretti, John McCormack; it was released as Victor 961. Jan Garber and His Orchestra, and Ira Sullivan with Tony Castellano also recorded the song. Henry Burrrecorded it in 1924 and Glenn Miller and his Orchestra in 1940. On the sheet music published in 1922 by Leo Feist it is described as a “Waltz Song” and “Paul Whiteman’s Sensational Waltz Hit” and is dedicated “To Julie”. “Wonderful One” appeared in the following movies: The Chump Champ (1950), Little ‘Tinker (1948), Red Hot Riding Hood (1943),Sufferin’ Cats (1943), Design for Scandal (1941), Strike Up the Band (1940), and Westward Passage (1932).\n\nIn 1924 Whiteman composed “When the One You Love Loves You” with Abel Baer and lyricist Cliff Friend. Whiteman recorded the song on 24 December 1924 in New York with Franklyn Baur on vocals and released it as Victor 19553-B backed with “I’ll See You in My Dreams”. The single reached #7 on the Billboard national pop singles charts in April 1925, staying on the charts for 3 weeks. The song is described as “A Sentimental Waltz Ballad” on the 1925 sheet music. Singer and composer Morton Downey, Sr., the father of the talk show host, recorded the song in 1925 and released it as Brunswick 2887. Eva Shirley sang the song in Ed Wynn‘s Grab Bag, a Broadway musical which opened in 1924 at the Globe. Leo Feist published the sheet music for the Shirley version in 1924 featuring Eva Shirley on the cover.\n\nPaul Whiteman composed “Flamin’ Mamie” in 1925 with Fred Rose, one of the top hits of 1925, which was recorded by the Harry Reser Band, Merritt Brunies and the Friars Inn Orchestra, Billy Jones and Ernest Hare, the Six Black Diamonds in 1926 on Banner, the Toll House Jazz Band, Aileen Stanley in 1925 with Billy “Uke” Carpenter on the ukulele,Hank Penny in 1938, Turk Murphy, the Frisco Syncopators, the Firehouse Five Plus Two, Bob Schulz and His Frisco Jazz Band, and the Coon-Sanders Nighthawk Orchestra led by Carleton Coon and Joe Sanders with Joe Sanders on vocals. The lyrics describe Mamie as a Roaring Twenties vamp: “Flamin’ Mamie, a sure-fire vamp/When it comes to lovin’/She’s a human oven/Come on you futuristic papas/She’s the hottest thing he’s seen since the Chicago fire.”\n\nPaul Whiteman also composed “Charlestonette” in 1925 with Fred Rose which was published by Leo Feist. The song was released as Victor 19785 backed with “Ida-I Do” in 1925. Ben Selvin’s Dance Orchestra and Bennie Krueger and His Orchestra also recorded the song in 1925.\n\nPaul Whiteman composed the piano work “Dreaming The Waltz Away” with Fred Rose in 1926. Organist Jesse Crawford recorded the song on October 4–5, 1926 in Chicago, Illinois and released it as a 78 on Victor Records, 20363 . Crawford played the instrumental on a Wurlitzer organ.\n\nIn Louis Armstrong & Paul Whiteman: Two Kings of Jazz (2004), Joshua Berrett wrote that “Whiteman Stomp” was credited to Fats Waller, Alphonso Trent, and Paul Whiteman. Lyricist Jo Trent is the co-author. The Fletcher Henderson Orchestra first recorded “Whiteman Stomp” on 11 May 1927 and released it as Columbia 1059-D. The Fletcher Henderson recording lists the songwriters as “Fats Waller/Jo Trent/Paul Whiteman”. Paul Whiteman recorded the song on 11 August 1927 and released it as Victor 21119.\n\n“Then and Now”, recorded on December 7, 1954 and released in 1955 on Coral, was composed by Paul Whiteman with Dick Jacobs and Bob Merrill.

Reser (January 17, 1896 – September 27, 1965) was an American banjo player and bandleader. Born in Piqua, Ohio, Reser was best known as the leader of The Clicquot Club Eskimos. He was regarded by some as the best banjoist of the 1920s.\n\nEarly Life\n\nHarrison Franklin Reser was born in Piqua, Ohio on Friday, January 17th 1896 to William Scott Reser and Alberta Wright. The couple had another child, Ruth. Reser was a first cousin to Orville & Wilbur Wright, the Wright brothers, inventors of the aeroplane. When he was 2 years of age, his father moved the family to Dayton, Ohio. It was here that his musical talents fast became apparent, and it was also here that it was discovered that the young Reser possessed something called “perfect pitch”. His parents realized they had a child prodigy. A special guitar was made for him suited to his extremely small size, and this was his first instrument.\n\nBy the age of 8 he was entertaining. Years later he recalled “Of course, being a kid, and playing for various minor concerts and recitals naturally gave me somewhat of a hero feeling, but I was never able to get the attitude of a great many people whom I often heard talking prodigies, juvenile wonders and any number of other equally mysterious things in connection with my playing. It never seemed in the least remarkable or extraordinary that I played at the age of eight.”\n\nAbout this time he began learning piano and also started a systematic study of music which was to form the basis for his natural genius and extensive knowledge of music theory. At the age of nine his parents, now fully realizing his potential and the benefits to be gained, sent him to Luis Hein and Albert Fischer of Dayton, where he continued study of the piano in addition to the violin and cello. He remained with the two until the age of fourteen. Reser attended Steele High School in Dayton, and it was during these years that he decided what his vocation would be. On April 8th, 1916 when he was just over twenty, he married Grace Tharp of Dayton in Newport, Ky.\n\nCareer\n\nIt was during this time that he was seeing the banjo make its presence felt more strongly with dance bands and therefore felt he should learn how to play it as quickly as possible. He practiced diligently until he was able to play the instrument to a high enough standard to supplement his piano playing with it, there by increasing his chances of earning a reasonable living. In the summer of 1920 he played in a Dayton dance band under the leadership of Paul Goss. By this time he was playing the banjo more regularly. He soon relocated to Buffalo, New York to appear at the Hippodrome, playing primarily violin, though continuing to work on his banjo technique as well.\n\nJust after Christmas of 1920 he relocated again, this time to New York City. He sought out engagements and soon found himself in demand. Some of the early bands he was involved with included those of Ben Selvin, Bennie Krueger, Sam Lanin, Nathan Glantz, Mike Markel (for whom he played Saxophone) and many others. Though there is no supporting evidence, Reser’s first broadcast is said to have been from the Statue of Liberty, Bedloe’s Island, on a US Army transmitter in 1921. By 1922, he had recorded a half dozen pieces, including Crazy Jo’ (January) and Zez Confrey‘s Kitten On the Keys (April). In early autumn of the same year, he considered starting his own band to record under. Soon a contract was drawn up with Okeh and his first band came into being during September/October of 1922, the Okeh Syncopators. Shortly after the start of this new endeavor he was approached by Paul Whiteman to sit in for Whiteman’s regular banjoist, Mike Pingitore, during a UK tour of the Paul Whiteman Orchestra.\n\nReser had three original compositions written for tenor banjo; The Cat and the Dog, Cracker Jack, and Lolly Pops.\n\nIn 1925, he found fame as the director for NBC‘s Clicquot Club Eskimo Orchestra, continuing with that weekly half-hour until 1935. At the same time, he also led other bands using pseudonyms. “Harry Reser and His Six Jumping Jacks,” with vocals by Tom Stacks, were the zany forerunners to comedy bands like Spike Jones and His City Slickers.\n\nReser and his band introduced on record, the standard “Santa Claus Is Coming To Town” in 1934.\n\nThroughout his career he was an endorsed artist, playing instruments from several well known makers. During the 20s he mainly played a variety of William L. Lange’s Paramount tenor and plectrum banjos, and ultimately Lange presented him with a Super Paramount Artists Supreme, as he did Michael Pingitore, another Paramount artist. Later Reser would also play Gibson and Vega Vox banjos.\n\nHarry Reser played “Tiger Rag” and “You Hit the Spot” in the Vitaphone musical short Harry Reser and His Eskimos (1936).\n\nReser remained active in music for the rest of his life, leading TV studio orchestras and playing with Broadway theatre orchestras. In 1960 he appeared with Bing Crosby, Peggy Lee and Buster Keaton in “A 70th Birthday Salute to Paul Whiteman” on TV’s The Revlon Revue. He wrote several instructional books for the banjo, guitar, and ukulele.\n\nIn 1965 Reser died of a heart attack in the orchestra pit of Manhattan’s Imperial Theatre, warming up for a Broadway stage version of Fiddler on the Roof. He was inducted into the National Four-String Banjo Hall of Fame, a museum in Oklahoma, in 1999."
