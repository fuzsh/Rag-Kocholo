        "text": "Coming on the scene as a metal drummer in the late eighties, Dave DiCenso has since worked in a diverse array of musical contexts; from hardcore and prog, to rock, pop, jazz-fusion, funk, and soul. Along with his chameleon-like approach, he is known for his individual sound, musicality, and highly animated performances. Dave has also excelled in the field of education, and is considered to be one of the great player/teachers of our time.\n\nDave grew up in a musical family in a suburb on the South Shore of Boston. His father, Dick DiCenso, was a well-known drummer and educator in the area. He was Daveâs first teacher when Dave was five years old. His older brothers John and Joseph were accomplished on drums and piano, respectively. Like their father, both brothers were jazz musicians at heart, while Dave gravitated toward the rock, pop, and R&B music of the day.\n\nDave studied with his dad until the age of ten, then decided to take guitar lessons. These lessons lasted until age fifteen, when he chose to pursue drumming as a career-path. That same year, he had his first pro gig, filling in with a band playing a New Yearâs Eve party at a hotel. At this point, Dave was playing with local rock and metal bands and discovered he was a fish out of water when the band leader turned around to âshushâ him within the first bar of the first song. Despite his lack of skill for playing quietly, he began getting calls for more general business (GB) gigs, soon thereafter working regularly throughout the Boston area.\n\nHaving opted out of college after high-school, Dave joined Bad Karma â a popular thrash metal band on the Boston club circuit. In 1988, taking a three month break from the band, Dave went to New York City to study privately at the Drummerâs Collective. Here, he was able to learn from top-shelf drum set educators like Kim Plainfield, Rod Morgenstein, Zach Danziger, Frank Malabe, and Pete Zeldman.\n\nUpon returning to Boston, Dave spent a few months studying with famed teacher, Gary Chaffee, who taught privately from his home outside of Boston. As the 90âs rolled in Dave wanted to play other styles of music and he began working with local pop and rock bands such as Mystery Jones, Farrenheit, Ultra Blue, Jon Finn Group, and Two Ton Shoe, all the while keeping one foot planted in the metal scene.\n\nIt was through a colleague in the metal scene that Dave eventually connected with the Cro-Mags; the band credited for being the first to fuse hardcore and metal in the late 80âs. In 1990, Dave came in to finish touring the bandâs Best Wishes album. He would go on to do several tours and albums with Cro-Mags including 1992âs Alpha-Omega, and 2000âs Revenge, the latter featuring guitarist Rocky George, from Suicidal Tendencies. Cro-Magsâ legendary front man Harley Flanagan said of Dave in his book Life of My Own, âHe was a sick f*cking drummer. He could play just about any kind of music, but he was a metalhead at heart. He hit the drums so f*cking hard â one of my all-time favorite drummers Iâve played with.â\n\nDave further jumped the fence into hardcore, when he recorded New York City band Shelterâs 1995 release, Mantra. He went on to record three more albums with the band including 1997âs Beyond Planet Earth, and 2000âs The Purpose, The Passion.\n\nIn 1997 Dave also recorded pop icons Duran Duranâs âOut of My Mindâ for the soundtrack to the major motion picture The Saint. The following year he contributed four tracks to ex-Baby Animals singer Suze DeMarchiâs Telelove, recorded all tracks on Two Ton Shoeâs Figures and Jon Finn Groupâs Wicked, and did a short stint with the Steve Morse Band, featuring Morse, the legendary guitarist known for his work with the Dixie Dregs and Deep Purple. Steve was so happy with Daveâs work he published an article about him in the December â98 issue of Guitar Magazine titled, âImpressed and Inspired by a Temporary Drummer.â\n\nAnother significant event in Daveâs career was in 1994 when he accepted a teaching position at Berklee College of Music. Dave says, âMy bond with my students is one of the most meaningful aspects of my professional life. Teaching is honorable and humbling work, and I am grateful that Berklee has afforded me the opportunity to do such work with some of the most talented, intelligent, and driven students in the worldâ.\n\nIn 2001, after three years of playing exclusively with Two Ton Shoe, he exited and began again to look for side-man work. Over the next couple of years, he recorded jazz pianist Hiromiâs Another Mind, Dream Theater guitarist John Petrucciâs Suspended Animation, Extreme front-man Gary Cheroneâs Need I Say More, and Jess Tardyâs Hold On â the last featuring iconic bassist Bob Glaub. During this time, he was also touring with Hiromi as well as blues guitarist Johnny A.\n\nBy 2003 it was time for a change. âI was burnt out from playing the sideman roleâ, he says. âI learned so much from years of fitting myself into other peoplesâ music, but I needed a break from it.â One of Daveâs primary aspirations with music since the beginning was to produce and perform music he had either written himself, or through collaboration. This calling had largely gone unanswered until the second half of the 00âs, when he set out on a course of self-study to become a better song-writer, lyricist, and multi-instrumentalist. This break resulted in a six-year hiatus from performing.\n\nDuring this period, Dave wrote his first instructional book, Universal Rhythms for Drumset. It was published by Alfred Music in 2009. He also made an appearance at the 2006 Modern Drummer Festival â his only live appearance of the year. Daveâs performance is considered by many to be among the most musical in the eventâs history.\n\nIt was in 2011 when Grammy-nominated singer Josh Groban invited Dave to finish a world tour that had five months of dates left on the itinerary. Accepting the offer marked the end of Daveâs playing hiatus. He would go on to work with Groban for several years before choosing to stay off the road to spend more time with his family, continue to work on original music, and publish his next instructional book."
