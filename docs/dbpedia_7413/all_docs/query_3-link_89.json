        "text": "In recent years the number of people making $200,000 or more a year working for Suffolk and Nassau counties has grown.\n\nThe figure in Suffolk is nearly 1,000, a 30 percent increase over the year before and part of a steady rise since 2012. In Nassau the number is nearly 650, and in both counties police make up the bulk of those earning $200,000 or more a year. The trend is apparent even if you exclude individuals who retired and received a payout of accumulated sick time and vacation along with other termination pay.\n\nThe charts below show the trends, and the table below them will let you search the Suffolk budget for details on individuals or departments.
