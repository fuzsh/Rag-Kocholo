Check The Big List every week for your chance to win concert tickets.\n\nLOCAL SPINS TICKET GIVEAWAY No. 2: The first person to email john@localspins.com with “TOMMY TUTONE” in the message field will win a pair of tickets to Saturday’s show. Check The Big List every week for your chance to win concert tickets.\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\nCAKE\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Wednesday\n\nTickets: SOLD OUT\n\nWhere: Frederik Meijer Gardens & Sculpture Park, Grand Rapids Township\n\nAnyone who was at CAKE’s first rollicking performance at the Meijer Gardens amphitheater, please raise your hands. I see. I suspect that all of you will be back for this week’s tour stop as well, considering the fact that this California alt-rock/pop/funk/hip hop act is pretty much unlike any other band on the road. And these guys are more than just “The Distance” and “Short Skirt/Long Jacket” (which are now more than two decades old).\n\nExpect a fun night full of tongue-in-cheekness, sarcasm and general goofiness. Gates open at 5:45 p.m.\n\nBEACH HOUSE\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Wednesday\n\nTickets: $33-$49.50\n\nWhere: 20 Monroe Live, Grand Rapids\n\nMaryland dream pop/indie-rock duo Beach House rolls into Grand Rapids as it continues to tour behind the 2018 release, “7,” which just happens to be, yes, the group’s seventh studio album and a recording that jumped to No. 20 on the Billboard 200 chart after it was released. The much-talked-about duo features singer-keyboardist Victoria Legrand and guitarist-keyboardist Alex Scally.\n\nHelpp will open the show. Get tickets online at 20monroelive.com.\n\nLOCAL SPINS WEDNESDAY:\n\nTRIBUTE TO JOHN PRINE\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Wednesday\n\nAdmission: Free\n\nWhere: SpeakEZ Lounge, Grand Rapids\n\nLocal Spins kicks off Tribute Month at SpeakEZ Lounge with a tribute to one of America’s truly great songwriters: John Prine. The night will feature two bands — plus a duo — paying homage by casually but passionately performing some of Prine’s most beloved tunes.\n\nFirst up, Max Lockwood, Dan Rickabus, Eric Engblade and friends will play a set of Prine classics (expect some surprise special guests), from “Grandpa Was a Carpenter” to “Angel from Montgomery” and “Paradise,” followed by a duo performance of a couple of deep tracks by John Sinkevics & Charley Honey.\n\nThe second set will feature the Andrews String Band, performing more Prine gems — from “Hello in There” to “Far From Me.” Come down for a truly special and unique evening starring an eclectic collection of West Michigan musicians.\n\nLocal Spins Wednesdays feature Michigan beer specials and are presented by Local Spins, SpeakEZ Lounge, North Coast Guitar Co. and WYCE. Free parking is available in the city lot on Monroe Avenue kitty-corner from SpeakEZ just to the south – and in the Sixth Street Park lot to the north.\n\nTHURSDAY\n\nSARAH MCLACHLAN\n\nWhen: 7 p.m. Thursday\n\nTickets: SOLD OUT\n\nWhere: Meijer Gardens, Grand Rapids Township\n\nAcclaimed Canadian singer-songwriter Sarah McLachlan has earned rave reviews for her summer tour, playing classics such as “Angel,” “I Will Remember You,” “Building a Mystery,” “Sweet Surrender” and more backed by an orchestra on stages across North America. Rolling Stone magazine called her recent Queens, New York, show an intimate and “dazzling retrospective.”\n\nMcLachlan follows up her Grand Rapids show with a tour stop Saturday at Meadow Brook Amphitheatre in Rochester Hills.\n\nJON ANDERSON\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Thursday\n\nTickets: $25-$150\n\nWhere: 20 Monroe Live, Grand Rapids\n\nThe voice and leading man of the English progressive rock band Yes, Jon Anderson will be bringing back his hits from the band days as well as playing music from his solo career and new album, “1,000 Hands.” Read the Local Spins interview with Anderson on Tuesday at Local Spins.\n\nThis show is all-ages and tickets are still available here. Doors open at 6:30 p.m.\n\nSWAY WILD\n\nWhen: 7:30 p.m. Thursday\n\nTickets: $25-$35\n\nWhere: Seven Steps Up, Spring Lake\n\nThis new roots music trio, Sway Wild, features the longtime duo of singer-songwriter Mandy Fer and Dave McGraw (who’ve played Seven Steps Up many times before), along with bassist Thom Lord. As they put it, they’re back “with a new sound, new album and new name,” featuring stellar harmonies, guitar work and a heartfelt blend of folk-rock, pop and funk.\n\nGet tickets and details online at sevenstepsup.com.\n\nLOW CUT CONNIE\n\nWhen: 8 p.m. Thursday\n\nTickets: $15 advance, $18 day of show\n\nWhere: The Stache inside The Intersection, Grand Rapids\n\nFor those West Michiganders who’ve never witnessed the incredible exuberance of Low Cut Connie live, this is another opportunity to catch Philadelphia piano-pounder Adam Weiner and crew in an intimate setting. Low Cut Connie has turned critics’ and fans’ heads for the past few years, thanks to tantalizing rock music and even more tantalizing live performances, which feature Weiner climbing on his piano, pounding on it feverishly and otherwise channeling the likes of Jerry Lee Lewis, early Elton John and others.\n\nThe band is touring behind its latest album, 2018’s “Dirty Pictures (Part 2).” Check out a Local Spins review of its first-ever Grand Rapids performance at the Tip Top Deluxe Bar & Grill a few years ago: True rock ‘n’ roll phenoms from Philly tear it up at the Tip Top. Get tickets and details about Thursday’s show online at sectionlive.com.\n\nJD MCPHERSON\n\nWhen: 9:30 p.m. Thursday\n\nAdmission: Free\n\nWhere: Founders Brewing, Grand Rapids\n\nThe operative word for this show might be “free.” The fact that West Michigan fans get a chance to see JD McPherson for free at Founders this week is pretty groovy, especially considering that the Oklahoma-bred singer-songwriter continues to grow his audience and get rave reviews for his unique take on rock ‘n’ roll, R&B and rockabilly (something displayed on his first three studio albums as well as his holiday compilation, “Socks”).\n\nHe and his band follow their Grand Rapids stop with a swing into Canada. Jeremie Albino opens the show. Get more info at foundersbrewing.com, which also has info about Saturday’s show with Wild Adriatic, $5.\n\nCOWPIE MUSIC FESTIVAL:\n\nCRACKER\n\nJOE HERTLER & THE RAINBOW SEEKER\n\nDESMOND JONES, DON JULIN\n\nLADY ACE BOOGIE, MUNGION\n\nWhen: Thursday-Saturday\n\nTickets: $120 advance, $140 weekend at the gate\n\n$30 Thursday, $55 Friday, $65 Saturday\n\nWhere: Shagbark Farm, 7525 Alaska Ave. SE, Caledonia\n\nLOCAL SPINS TICKET GIVEAWAY No. 1: Congratulations to Local Spins reader Lorrain Smalligan, who was the first person to email john@localspins.com with “COWPIE” in the message field and won a pair of one-day passes to the festival on Saturday. Check The Big List every week for your chance to win concert tickets.\n\nIt’s back for another glorious year and bigger than ever.\n\nThis rootsy, down-on-the-farm festival south of Grand Rapids features national headliner Cracker, plus regional favorites Joe Hertler & The Rainbow Seekers, Desmond Jones, Lady Ace Boogie, HyRyder, Jesse Ray & The Carolina Catfish, Mungion and many more playing three stages. The first notes get played by The Gasoline Gypsies on the Haywagon Stage at 2 p.m. Thursday.\n\nGet details and tickets online at cowpiemusicfestival.com. And check out Local Spins’ interview with Cracker’s David Lowery.\n\nFARMFEST\n\nWhen: Thursday-Sunday\n\nTickets: $95 advance, $100 at the gate\n\nWhere: 1865 Roby Road, Johannesburg\n\nQuaint and chock full of regional bands and solo artists, Farmfest unfurls once again in a remote area just north of the town of Vienna, Mich.
