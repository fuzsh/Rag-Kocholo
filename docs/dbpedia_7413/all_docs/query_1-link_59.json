        "text": "A. Entering Bids\n\nTo bid, find a lot page, enter a value in the bid box, and click “Bid.” If you click “Bid” on a lot, you will be prompted to either log in to your Charitybuzz account, or create a new one if you do not have one already.\n\nOnce you’ve created an account you will be presented with the lot details, conditions of sale, and standard shipping and redemption details. Once you have accepted the Conditions of Sale, you may proceed with placing a bid on that lot. All bids placed for any lot are governed by the Conditions of Sale for that lot.\n\nYou may bid at or above the starting bid displayed as the “Current Price” in a lot page’s bid box. The current leading bid, along with a list of a lot’s full bidding history, will be visible to other users. If the status of your bid changes, you will receive notifications via email and push (if you have the Charitybuzz App installed).\n\nB. Cancellation Rights\n\nAs soon you place and confirm your bid amount, your bid is submitted. You accept and agree that bids submitted by you are final. Charitybuzz is not responsible or liable for any problems, delays, or other issues resulting from the use of the Internet, including but not limited to transmission, execution, or processing of Bids.\n\nCharitybuzz nor the Seller is responsible for any errors in bidding. A bidder should make certain to bid on the correct lot. The Bidder should make sure the bid price they enter (including any taxes or fees) is the price they are willing and able to pay. Once the hammer has fallen and Charitybuzz has announced the winning Bidder, that Bidder is unconditionally bound to pay for that lot, even if the Bidder has made an error.\n\nA bid(s) entered by mistake on the part of a bidder is NOT grounds for cancellation of that bid. Each bidder is responsible for his or her own account and bids. In addition, allowing access to another who enters a bid without your knowledge is NOT grounds for cancellation of a bid.\n\nC. Fraudulent Bidding\n\nAll Bidders must meet Charitybuzz’s qualifications to bid. Any Bidder who is not a client in good standing of Charitybuzz may be disqualified at Charitybuzz’s sole discretion and will not be awarded lots. Such determination may be made by Charitybuzz in its sole discretion, at any time prior to, during, or even after the close of the Auction. Charitybuzz reserves the right to exclude any person from the auction.\n\nBids will not be accepted from minor persons under eighteen (18) years of age without a parent’s written consent containing an acknowledgement of the conditions herein and indicating their agreement to be bound thereby on behalf of the bidder.\n\nIf an entity places a bid, then the person executing the bid on behalf of the entity agrees to personally guarantee payment for any successful bid.\n\nAny bidder that represents a purchaser is personally and individually responsible for any obligations of the purchaser set forth in these terms and conditions. All purchasers purchasing pursuant to a valid resale license will need to provide appropriate documentation for removal of state sales tax.\n\nD. Winning & Disputes\n\nThe successful bidder is the highest bidder acknowledged by Charitybuzz. In the event of any dispute between bidders, or in the event of doubt on Charitybuzz’s part as to the validity of any bid, Charitybuzz will have final discretion either to determine the successful bidder or to re-offer and resell the lot in question. If any dispute arises after the sale, Charitybuzz’s sale record is conclusive. While Charitybuzz makes every effort to guarantee accuracy, in the event of an error, and a lot is accidentally declared sold by mistake, Charitybuzz reserves the right to cancel the sale and relist the lot in its sole discretion.\n\nBy accepting the Conditions of Sale, Bidder personally and unconditionally guarantees payment.\n\nTitle to any lot remains with the Seller, any secured party of the Seller, or assignee of Seller, as the case may be, until the lot is paid for in full by the Bidder. Charitybuzz reserves the right to require payment in full before delivering any lot to the successful bidder.\n\nLive bids lots are a special type of auction lot on Charitybuzz. Live bid lots on Charitybuzz are paired with a real world, physical auction, where that real world auction is often scheduled to occur at a later date. You can distinguish Live Bid lots by the “Live Bid” label in the title of the lot, and additional description text at the start of the lots “Overview” tab.\n\nIn a Live Bid lot on Charitybuzz, a lot is created that is similar to any other auction lot on the site. These special lots last for similar amounts of time and bidding occurs normally by our users.\n\nThings start to differ after a Charitybuzz Live Bid lot closes. After it closes and the winning bidder is chosen, that winning bidder’s bid amount or (if it exists) the max bid amount associated with that winning bid, are taken and entered into the associated real world auction. For example, if a bidder on Charitybuzz wins at $12,000 with an unrealized max bid of $15,000, then that $15,000 dollar amount is passed on into the real world auction.\n\nBefore the winning bidders bid or max bid amount is passed on, someone from Charitybuzz contacts that winner after the Charitybuzz lot closes and before the real world auction opens. This is to confirm if the bidder would like to increase their bid or max bid amount before it’s entered into the real world auction.\n\nWhat happens during the real world auction? Each individual one may vary. Charitybuzz does not own or operate any real world auctions, nor does Charitybuzz require any partners to follow a specific auction model. We make no claims to the consistency of real world auction experiences and encourage bidders to contact us for more details as needed.\n\nIn our experience, real world auctions tied to Charitybuzz Live Bid lots are typically executed by our partners in a few common ways.\n\nIn one scenario, if an auction house and an auctioneer is present, winning live bids from Charitybuzz Live Bid lots are treated as “absentee” bids. This normally means that the Charitybuzz winning bid is placed in the auctioneers books as a bid. As the auctioneer conducts the auction, they will bring up and enter the Charitybuzz winning bid during the course of the auction as the current price or next minimum bid value approaches the Charitybuzz winner’s bid amount. In this scenario, other people in the real world room are expected to bid against the auctioneer, not the Charitybuzz winning bidder. If no one is bidding in the room, the auctioneer will typically keep bidding up the price until the Charitybuzz Live Bid winner wins the real world auction.\n\nIn other models, an audience member (including, but not limited to a charity partner employee) might act as a proxy for the winning Charitybuzz bidder. They will usually bid on behalf of the winning Charitybuzz Live Bid winner during the normal course of that auction, using whatever means provided for that auction house (i.e. paddles, etc.)\n\nAfter the auction is completed, someone from Charitybuzz contacts our bidder to let them know the outcome. If that Charitybuzz Live Bid bidder has won, payment occurs as usual. If that Charitybuzz Live Bid bidder did not win, they will be notified accordingly.\n\nGetting your item - Items will either be shipped directly from Charitybuzz or from the item seller (Third Party) as indicated. Items shipping from Charitybuzz will be sent within five business days of payment settlement by the winning bidder. All third party items will be shipped within the times indicated on the lot page. Winning bidders should ensure the desired shipping address is provided to Charitybuzz within 24 hours after payment settlement. Charitybuzz will default to the shipping address listed on the winning bidder’s account unless otherwise notified. Please see FAQs for more information.\n\nItems that require signature - Items with a sale price of $1,000 and above are typically shipped with signature required.\n\nTickets & Certificates - For hard copies of tickets and certificates, the minimum shipping, handling, and applicable insurance charge is $14.95. Tickets, certificates, and vouchers, unless otherwise specified, will be shipped via professional carrier with standard ground service. In some cases, tickets will be left at the venue's \"Will Call\" window under the winner's name. Merchandise is insured for the winning amount.\n\nMerchandise - The minimum shipping charge for merchandise is $19.95. (Shipments outside the U.S. are subject to additional shipping and customs fees.) Merchandise, unless otherwise specified, will be shipped via professional carrier with standard ground service. Oversized items may require special delivery arrangements, which Charitybuzz will coordinate between the winning bidder and the selected freight carrier. All merchandise is insured for the winning amount.\n\nWill Call Pickups - In some cases, tickets will be left at the venue’s “Will Call” window under the winner’s name. Winning bidders may be required to submit the names of attendees up to several weeks ahead of the event. A valid photo ID for each person listed at Will Call is often required. When available, Charitybuzz will attempt to provide an onsite point of contact, but makes no guarantee that this information will be available for any given lot. Will Call tickets are typically available at the Will Call window at least an hour before the event, unless otherwise specified. The Will Call window is usually located near the venue's main entrance."
