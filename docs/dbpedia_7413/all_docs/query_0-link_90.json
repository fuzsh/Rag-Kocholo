Specific Exercise Patterns Generate an Epigenetic Molecular Memory Window That Drives Long-Term Memory Formation and Identifies ACVR1C as a Bidirectional Regulator of Memory\n\nAshley Keiser*, Tri Dong, Eniko Kramar, Christopher Butler, Siwei Chen, Dina Matheos, Joy Beardwood, Agatha Augustynski, Scott La Tour, Hassan Shaikh, Ameer Al-Shammari, Yasaman Alaghband, Vanessa Alizo Vera, Nicole Berchtold, Sharmin Shanur, Pierre Baldi, Carl Cotman, Marcelo Wood\n\nUniversity of California, Irvine, Irvine, California, United States\n\nBackground: Basic research and clinical trials universally demonstrate the benefits of exercise for cognitive function. In recent studies, we determined that a period of initial exercise also creates and maintains a molecular memory window for exercise benefits on cognitive function in male and female mice where a brief, 2-day exercise session following a break can also re-engage cognitive benefits, re-facilitate long-term potentiation, and allow for learning under insufficient, subthreshold training conditions. Here, we build on these exercise parameters to begin to define a mechanism responsible for maintaining cognitive benefits underlying this molecular memory window by initial exercise and driving long-term memory formation.\n\nMethods: We utilized RNA-sequencing to uncover genes in the dorsal hippocampus that are differentially expressed under conditions where exercise benefits are maintained throughout sedentary delay periods and enable the formation of long-term memory and synaptic plasticity. Specifically, adult male mice underwent 14 days of initial exercise, received a sedentary delay period (0-2 weeks), and a brief 2-day period of reactivating exercise, followed by 3 min inadequate, subthreshold training in an object location memory (OLM) task and hippocampus was dissected during the consolidation window, 1 hour after training. Those parameters were then used to examine hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) using theta burst stimulation in the schaffer collateral pathway. To assess how exercise modulates epigenetic regulation of genes up-regulated only under conditions where exercise enabled the formation of long-term memory and synaptic plasticity, histone modifications were examined at Acvr1c and Bdnf IV promoters using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-qPCR). To examine the role of Acvr1c, a gene coding for a type 1 activin A membrane receptor kinase of the TGF-β family of signaling molecules, in hippocampus-dependent long term memory formation and synaptic plasticity, we used intra-hippocampal delivery of AAV1-ACVR1C point mutant constructs that either enhance or disrupt function. Next, sedentary mice were trained using either a subthreshold (3 min) or standard (10 min) OLM task and memory was tested the following day. The same mice from behavioral studies were used to assess the impact of Acvr1c manipulation on hippocampal LTP.\n\nGiven misregulation of the TGF-β pathway that occurs with age and in AD patients, we examine whether Acvr1c declines with age in mouse and human hippocampus (Genotype-Tissue Expression Project). Dorsal hippocampus was obtained from 3 and 20 mo. female and male C57BL/6J mice and processed for RT-qPCR. Additionally, Acvr1c transcripts per million (TPM) values from RNA-Seq data set obtained through the MODEL-AD consortium were analyzed from 4, 8 and 12 mo. C57BL/6J and 5xFAD female and male mice. We next aimed to determine whether enhancing ACVR1C through virus-mediated overexpression of wildtype ACVR1C would regulate long-term memory formation and synaptic plasticity in aging 18 mo. and 12 and 18 mo. Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) mouse hippocampus and ameliorate impairments.\n\nResults: We demonstrate that specific exercise patterns transform insufficient, subthreshold training into long-term memory (Group: (F(6,64) = 8.13, P < 0.0001; Tukey test: P < 0.001, 14D vs. Sed) and synaptic plasticity (Group: (F(6,89) = 22.22, P < 0.0001; Tukey test: P < 0.0001) in adult mice compared to sedentary, effects which can be maintained and re-engaged with brief 2-day re-introduction to exercise following a sedentary delay (Behavior: Tukey test: P < 0.05, LTP: P < 0.0001, 2-day re-introduction vs sedentary). We identify a small number of genes whose expression correlate with conditions in which exercise facilitates long-term memory formation. Among these genes we found Acvr1c and Bdnf. We find that exercise, in any amount, alleviates epigenetic repression at the Acvr1c (Group (F(5,49) = 9.377, P < 0.0001) and Bdnf IV (Group (F(5,53) = 13.90, P < 0.0001) promoters during consolidation in a persistent manner, providing initial insight for maintenance of exercise benefits on long term memory. Disrupted ACVR1C function under adequate learning conditions in adults impairs memory (t(17) = 4.65, P = 0.0002) and synaptic plasticity (t(18) = 3.512, P = 0.0025). Conversely, overexpression of ACVR1C enables learning under inadequate training conditions in adults (t(18) = 3.303, P = 0.004) and enhances LTP (t(14) = 3.953, P = 0.0014). Furthermore, Acvr1c expression is impaired in the aging human (t(91) = 6.64, P = 0.0001), mouse (t(26) = 2.72, P = 0.01) and AD mouse brain (5xFAD) (Age: (F(2,48) = 54.95, P < 0.0001), and over-expression of Acvr1c ameliorates plasticity and cognitive impairment in aging (18 mo. C57: Behavior: (t(12) = 2.350, P = 0.036), LTP: (t(14) = 3.953, P = 0.001), 12 mo. 5xFAD: Behavior: (t(21) = 2.287, P = 0.032), LTP: (t(16) = 5.617, P < 0.0001), 18 mo. 5xFAD: LTP: (t(10) = 9.653, P = 0.001)).\n\nConclusions: Together, these findings provide a new paradigm for uncovering mechanistic drivers of exercise-facilitated learning and provide opportunity to explore how specific exercise parameters allow for periods of maintained epigenetic and molecular changes through sedentary periods that facilitate cognitive function. As we have demonstrated here, identification of such mechanisms may extend beyond the context of exercise and aid in ameliorating age and AD-associated cognitive impairment.\n\nKeywords: Hippocampus, Exercise, Epigenetics, Memory, Ageing\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP2. Opioid-Induced Postoperative Cognitive Dysfunction: Long-Term Effects on Neuronal Structure and Function\n\nRuth Barrientos*, Nicholas Deems, Stephanie Muscat, Michael Butler, Emmanuel Scaria, Brigitte Gonzalez Olmo, Giuseppe Cortese, Benedetta Leuner, Kedryn Baskin\n\nOhio State University, College of Medicine, Institute for Behavioral Medicine Research, Columbus, Ohio, United States\n\nBackground: Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) is an abrupt decline in memory and executive function occurring in ~10% of older adult patients and lasting weeks to months after surgery, significantly increasing vulnerability to neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease. Our recently developed preclinical model of POCD determined that aged rats treated with the opioid, morphine, after abdominal surgery extended memory impairments from four days (without morphine) to eight weeks. The mechanisms driving opioid-exacerbated POCD are not well-understood, although significant increases in hippocampal-inflammatory gene expression two-weeks after surgery plays a key role. Given that hippocampal neurons and synapses are responsive to inflammatory signaling, we hypothesized that the combination of aging, surgery, and morphine, would alter structural and functional features of dendrites, dendritic spines, and synapses on CA1 neurons four-weeks after surgery.\n\nMethods: Aged (24 mos) male F344xBN rats (n = 6-8/group) underwent laparotomy under isoflurane anesthesia, and were treated with saline or morphine (2 mg/kg, i.p.) twice a day for 7 days after surgery. Four weeks later, brains were collected and stained with Golgi-Cox. Reconstructions of CA1 pyramidal cells from the dorsal hippocampus to characterize dendritic complexity and length and spine subtypes were quantified. In separate cohorts of rats, hippocampal synaptoneurosomes were isolated to assess expression levels of plasticity-related proteins, LTP was measured, and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates were assayed to identify any synaptic memory consolidation-related disturbances.\n\nResults: Sholl analyses of CA1 dendrites revealed no structural changes in any group, but mushroom and stubby spine density was decreased in aged, morphine-treated rats. Western blot analysis from hippocampal synaptoneurosomes showed a significant decrease of the glutamate AMPA receptor subunit 1, LTP was robustly impaired, and mitochondrial oxygen consumption rates were dramatically reduced in aged morphine-treated rats relative to controls.\n\nConclusions: Taken together, these data suggest the combination of aging, surgery, and morphine evokes long-lasting disruptions to dendritic spine density, synaptic function, and mitochondrial function necessary for memory consolidation.\n\nKeywords: Mitochondria, Synaptic Plasticity, Surgery\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP3. Towards Understanding the Proteomic Signature of Psychosis Using Schizophrenia and Alzheimer’s Disease Human Postmortem Brains\n\nLeslie Nucifora*, Nagat El Demerdash, Christopher Ross, Russell Margolis, Gwenn Smith, Julia Kofler, Robert Sweet, Frederick Nucifora\n\nJohns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder, characterized universally by cognitive decline, and heterogeneously by emotional and behavioral changes. Between 40-60% of AD patients experience psychotic symptoms. Recent studies suggest greater cognitive impairment and more rapid cognitive decline in AD patients with psychosis (AD + P), suggesting the importance of subtyping AD.\n\nSchizophrenia (SCZ) affects 1% of the population and is characterized by positive and negative symptoms, as well as cognitive deficits. Psychosis, in the form of hallucinations and delusions, is the most prominent symptom. SCZ is also a heterogeneous disorder in its clinical presentation and progression. Like AD, subtyping SCZ could provide a better understand of the illness.\n\nThe pathological hallmark of AD is protein aggregation. Protein aggregation likely disrupts important proteins and pathways that can lead to the symptoms of AD, including psychosis and cognitive decline. We have demonstrated protein aggregation in a subset of patients with SCZ. In addition, we have shown using olfactory neurons, that SCZ patients with aggregation have more pronounced cognitive deficits than SCZ patients without aggregation as a mechanism. Further, we and others have previously shown that the protein products of rare genetic variants linked with SCZ in unique pedigrees can aggregate and disrupt the function of critical proteins required for the proper functioning of the cell. While protein aggregation has been linked to neuronal cell death in AD, the protein aggregation we observe in SCZ likely leads to cellular dysfunction and not profound cell loss. While the mechanisms leading to aggregation in both diseases may be partly distinct, there are likely similarities, with proteins that are prone to aggregate overlapping between diseases and relating to the common clinical phenotype of psychosis and/or cognitive impairment. Therefore, we hypothesize that there will be proteins and pathways that differ between AD and AD + P, and that those proteins and pathways will overlap with some of those identified in SCZ, providing insight into the most relevant proteins and pathways related to AD psychosis.\n\nMethods: A comparative proteomic study of protein mass spectrometry data obtained from Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia postmortem brains utilizing protein enrichment and pathway analysis.\n\nResults: We have obtained promising preliminary data through proteomic investigation of the insoluble proteins in this SCZ subtype that suggests overlap with insoluble proteins identified in a parallel proteomic study utilizing AD brains with and without psychosis. These results suggest a common proteomic signature in AD and SCZ that may be related to psychosis or cognitive impairment.\n\nConclusions: By comparing the aggregated proteins in AD + P to AD without psychosis and then comparing these proteins to cases of SCZ with protein aggregation, a disease characterized by psychosis, we can better understand the pathways that are disrupted leading to psychosis in AD. This could lead to novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of psychosis and could lead to refinements in nosology across diagnoses.\n\nKeywords: Brain Proteomics, Alzheimer Disease, Schizophrenia Subtypes, Psychosis\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP4. Moderate Ethanol Exposure Ameliorates Cognitive Function Through the Reduction of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, Pro-Inflammatory Cytokines, and Aβ Deposition in Early-Stage of APP/PS1 Mice\n\nShinwoo Kang, Jeyeon Lee, Sun Choi, Jarred Nesbitt, Paul Min, Eugenia Trushina, Doo-Sup Choi*\n\nMayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science, Rochester, Minnesota, United States\n\nBackground: Recent studies also suggest that moderate alcohol consumption is possibly protective against dementia and cognitive decline. Moderate ethanol exposure (MEE) prevents the formation of amyloid-beta (Aβ) and further protects hippocampal neurons by blocking the accumulation of Aβ protein. However, it is unclear how MEE ameliorates cognitive function through cholesterol metabolism and the neuroinflammatory system.\n\nMethods: We assessed Apoε in the mouse brain using IHC and ELISA in response to MEE. First, to confirm the intracerebral distribution of Apoε, we co-stained with GFAP, a marker for astrocytes that biosynthesize Apoε. Since Apoε, a protein involved in cholesterol transport, has been identified as the only risk factor consistently associated with nonfamilial AD, we examined whether EtOH exposure alters LDL-cholesterol levels in the brain. We sought to investigate whether the ethanol-induced upregulation of LRP1 could potentially inhibit the activity of IL-1β and TNF-α induced IKK-α/β towards NF-κB p65, resulting in a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Next, we examined whether MEE could potentially mitigate the deposition of amyloid plaques, AD’s most distinctive pathological marker. To evaluate the actual Aβ load in the brains of APP/PS1 mice, we performed with a specific antibody Aβ (Thioflavin S) on both air- and ethanol-exposed groups, subsequently analyzing Aβ levels. We quantified the number of Aβ plaques, including intra-neuronal Aβ and extracellular plaques, and compared these in the cortex and dentate gyrus of the hippocampus across all experimental groups. We also measured glucose uptake activity using 18F-FDG in APP/PS1 mice. Finally, we investigated whether MEE induced cognitive and memory changes using the Y maze, noble objective recognition (NOR) test, and Morris water maze (MWM).\n\nResults: We found a reduction of Apoε and astrocytes in the cortex and hippocampus of EtOH-exposed APP/PS1 mice compared to air-exposed APP/PS1 mice. Consistently, we confirmed the reduced Apoε levels in ELISA experiments in the cortex and hippocampus of EtOH-exposed APP/PS1 mice. Utilizing a western blotting approach with an LRP1 antibody, we found a marked increase in LRP1 levels of EtOH-exposed APP/PS1 mice as compared to air-exposed APP/PS1, suggesting a possible correlation between reduced Apoε or decreased LDL cholesterol and increased LRP1 expression. Remarkably, we observed a significant reduction in p-IKK-α/β levels in EtOH-exposed APP/PS1 mice compared to air-exposed APP/PS1 mice. This decrease in p-IKK-α/β led to a corresponding reduction in NF-κB p65, a known pro-inflammatory cytokine, in EtOH-exposed APP/PS1 mice compared to air-exposed APP/PS1 mice. To ascertain the level of IL-1β and TNF-α in the brain, we performed an ELISA assay to detect IL-1β and TNF-α in brain tissue supernatants collected from both sets of mice. After 12 weeks of ethanol exposure, as expected, we found a reduction in IL-1β and TNF-α levels in the cortex and hippocampus of EtOH-exposed APP/PS1 mice compared to air-exposed APP/PS1 male mice. Our results revealed a significant reduction in Aβ plaques in the cortex and hippocampus in response to EtOH-exposed APP/PS1 treatments compared to air-exposed APP/PS1 mice. To quantify the level of amyloid protein in the brain, we performed an ELISA assay to detect Aβ1-42 in brain tissue supernatants collected from both experimental groups. Intriguingly, the results showed a stark contrast between air-exposed APP/PS1 and ethanol-exposed APP/PS1 mice. We noted an elevated uptake of 18F-FDG in APP/PS1 mice exposed to ethanol for 12 weeks, especially in the cortex and hippocampus. In NOR, the ethanol-exposed APP/PS1 mice demonstrated a prolonged exploration time of the unfamiliar object. In contrast, air-exposed APP/PS1 mice displayed similar exploration times for familiar and unfamiliar objects. In MWM, during the acquisition training, the EtOH-exposed APP/PS1 mice outperformed the air-exposed APP/PS1 mice on the fourth day. Furthermore, a significant decrease in escape latency was observed in air-exposed APP/PS1 mice compared with the EtOH-exposed APP/PS1 mice on the fourth day.\n\nConclusions: Our findings suggest that MEE may benefit AD pathology via modulating LRP1 expression, potentially reducing neuroinflammation and attenuating Aβ deposition. Our study implies that reduced astrocyte-derived Apoε and LDL cholesterol levels are critical for attenuating AD pathology.\n\nKeywords: Alcohol, Alzheimer’s Disease, Astrocyte, Cholesterol Biosynthesis, Inflammation\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP5. The Association Between Loss of Integrity in Dopamine and Norepinephrine Nuclei and Decline in Working Memory Performance in Healthy Aging\n\nClifford Cassidy*, Ahmad Sibahi, Joseph Therriault, Christine Tardif, Pedro Rosa-Neto\n\nThe University of Ottawa Institute of Mental Health Research, Ottawa, Canada\n\nBackground: Decline in working memory performance is a common feature of normal aging. Evidence from animal studies has suggested that age-related changes in neuromodulatory systems such as the dopamine system may be partly responsible for this decline. Postmortem data reveals degeneration in the dopamine system during normal aging, while the norepinephrine system may be relatively preserved in the absence of neurodegenerative illness. Recent work by our group and others has shown that age-related loss in integrity of the dopamine and norepinephrine systems can be captured in vivo using neuromelanin-sensitive MRI (NM-MRI) of the substantia nigra (SN) and locus coeruleus (LC) respectively. Here we investigated whether this loss of integrity of neuromodulatory systems may impair cognition in healthy aging. We focused on working memory given prior evidence that neuromodulatory systems influence the prolonged neural activity that is required for working memory.\n\nMethods: The study sample included 155 adults aged 65 and older who had no sign of cognitive impairment on the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale and Mini-Mental State Exam. NM-MRI was acquired using a turbo spine echo sequence. Measures of SN and LC integrity were generated by processing NM-MRI images with established methods to calculate contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) of voxels of the SN (relative to a crus cerebri reference region) and sections of the LC (relative to a central pons reference region). To provide a biomarker of incipient Alzheimer’s disease, PET imaging was acquired with the radiotracer [18F]MK6240; standardized uptake value ratio was extracted from a temporal region implicated in the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease. Working memory performance was assessed using the digit span test of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Linear regression analyses were performed in Matlab. All models predicting working memory performance included sex and tau level (temporal cortex [18F]MK6240 SUVR) as covariates. Mediation analysis was performed with the Mediation Toolbox developed in Matlab by the Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience Laboratory.\n\nResults: Subregions of the SN and LC were identified that showed significant loss of signal with age. In the full study sample, a cluster of voxels in the ventral SN showed decreasing signal with age (320 of 1879 voxels, thresholded at p76 years old, n = 36, t33 = -2.27, p = 0.030).\n\nNext, we examined the impact of NM-MRI signal in the SN and LC on age-related decline in working memory performance. In an initial model excluding SN and LC signal, age was strongly related to working memory performance (t127 = -3.24, p = 0.0015). When adding signal from the age-declining subregions of the SN and LC as predictors in this model, age was no longer a significant predictor (t125 = -1.63, p = 0.11) but both SN signal (t125 = 3.23 p = 0.0016) and LC signal (t125 = 2.52, p = 0.013) were significant predictors. The level of tau was not associated with working memory performance (t125 = 0.49, p = 0.62). A mediation test found that SN signal was a significant mediator between age and working memory performance (ab path: Z = -2.71, p = 0.007).\n\nConclusions: In older adults, NM-MRI detects age-related loss of integrity in the ventral SN and rostral LC. The integrity of each of these regions independently contributes to working memory performance and integrity of the SN significantly mediates the effect of age on working memory. Prodromal Alzheimer’s disease does not appear to contribute to working memory performance. These results are consistent with prior evidence that age-related decline in neuromodulatory systems impairs the prolonged neural activity required for working memory. Future multimodal imaging work will further probe this proposed mechanism by examining temporal profiles of brain activity such as intrinsic neural timescales.\n\nKeywords: Dopamine, Neuromelanin-Sensitive MRI, Aging, Norepinephrine, Working Memory\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP6. The Aging Hippocampus is More Engaged but Differentially Specialized During Explore-Exploit Decision-Making in Older Adults With and Without Depression\n\nAngela Ianni*, Beatrice Langer, Andrew Papale, Katalin Szanto, Michael Hallquist, Alexandre Dombrovski\n\nUniversity of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States\n\nBackground: Healthy aging is associated with a positivity bias in attention and memory that favors positive over negative information processing1. Similarly, the socioemotional selectivity theory proposes shifting attention towards emotionally meaningful goals with aging, leading to increased emotional stability and focus on key relationships2. One mechanism by which this cognitive-emotional shift may occur is through alterations in reward guided behavior. Explore-exploit decision-making, which involves exploring (trying out) new behaviors to learn about the best options available with exploiting (repeating) known good options, is ideally suited to test this hypothesis. For example, the shifting priority from new experiences to well-established personal connections may reflect alterations in how individuals resolve the explore-exploit dilemma.\n\nThe hippocampus is a key region implicated in learning and memory as well as reward function, binding information into cognitive maps that support reward-guided behavior including exploration and exploitation3. Furthermore, the hippocampus undergoes age-related changes in structure and function, which have been associated with cognitive decline and are potentially reversible with interventions such as exercise and environmental enrichment4,5. Relatedly, there are several models of cognitive aging suggesting age-related overcompensation and de-differentiation of neural systems to maintain cognitive functioning6,7. We sought to characterize age-associated changes in hippocampal explore-exploit neural functioning in older individuals with and without depression. We hypothesized that increased age would be associated with hippocampal hyperactivation but diminished selectiveness to specific computational parameters reflecting encoding of reward value, prediction errors, and information content.\n\nMethods: The study included 146 cognitively intact individuals, aged 49-80 years (mean 62.0 yrs, sd 6.8; 81 females), comprising individuals with depression (n = 103) and psychiatrically healthy controls (n = 43). Cognition was assessed with the Executive Interview (EXIT) assessment. Participants completed an explore-exploit decision-making paradigm (aka the “clock task”8) during an fMRI scan, in which individuals sampled a 5 second continuous interval to learn the most rewarding location in time and space. We discretized the interval into basis functions and utilized the previously developed SCEPTIC selective maintenance reinforcement learning model9, to calculate trial-by-trial action values, reward prediction errors, entropy (measure of information content), and change in entropy. Modeling was implemented using the Matlab VBA toolbox and trial-by-trial parameter values were extracted for model-based fMRI analyses. fMRI images were pre-processed and then extracted signal from the hippocampus was deconvolved using a leading hemodynamic deconvolution algorithm to estimate neural activity, which was stimulus locked (to clock-onset and feedback) and averaged across trials3. Multilevel modeling implemented in R was used to test for significance between mean-centered age, EXIT score, model-derived behavioral parameters, and neural data, with significance thresholding of pFDR < 0.05.\n\nResults: Age did not correlate with total points earned (p = 0.55) and the groups did not differ in age (p = 0.13) or gender (p = 0.90). EXIT score was significantly higher (indicating more impairment) in depressed individuals compared to non-depressed controls (dep. mean 6.2, sd 3.1; cont. mean 5.0, sd 2.5; F 5.43, p = 0.02). Older age predicted impaired exploitation (chi-sq = 5.36, p = 0.02) with no effect on exploration (chi-sq = 0.10, p = 0.75). Across all participants, we found that age was positively correlated with heightened hippocampal activation at the time of clock onset and during the two seconds prior to response (pFDR < 0.01). With regards to neural encoding of entropy (information content), we found that older individuals had blunted hippocampal response to entropy offline (prior to trial onset; pFDR < 0.01) and at the time of feedback (pFDR < 0.001). Conversely, we found that older individuals displayed a more prominent dip in hippocampal activity to entropy change after feedback (pFDR < 0.001). Furthermore, we found that older individuals displayed enhanced hippocampal offline encoding of maximum value around 2 seconds prior to clock onset (pFDR < 0.001). Lastly, we found that older individuals displayed an opposite pattern of hippocampal neural response to the magnitude of prediction error compared to younger individuals both offline (pFDR < 0.001) and after feedback (pFDR < 0.001). The pattern of age-related effects on explore-exploit neural processing was similar when looking at depressed and non-depressed individuals separately and remained robust to sensitivity analyses controlling for EXIT score, years of education, and mean score obtained per trial. Lastly, we found that EXIT score was independently associated with increased hippocampal neural activity online (after clock onset, pFDR < 0.01) and after feedback (pFDR < 0.05).\n\nConclusions: We found evidence of heightened hippocampal engagement in older individuals and those with greater cognitive impairment performing an explore-exploit task, supporting the theory of compensatory overactivation with aging. This mechanism may underly behavioral adaptions of increased emotional stability and focus on key relationships in old age.\n\nKeywords: Biology of Aging, Cognition, Explore-Exploit Dilemma, Functional MRI (fMRI)\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP7. Eph/Ephrin Bidirectional Signaling is Essential for Development of Anatomical Cell Clusters in Layer II of Medial Entorhinal Cortex\n\nNaoki Yamamoto, Hisayuki Osanai, Mark Henkemeyer, Takashi Kitamura*\n\nThe University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas, United States\n\nBackground: The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) has characteristic hexagonally arranged cell clusters in the layer II (MECII). These cell clusters are composed of Wolfram syndrome1 (Wfs1)/Calbindin (CalB)+ pyramidal cells and surrounded by Reelin+ stellate cells in the MECII. The MEC integrates multimodal sensory inputs for the memory formation, spatial navigation and time perception. Accumulating evidences from neural recording and imaging suggest that cells coding similar spatial/temporal information tend to be clustered in MEC, implicating that the cell clusters in the MECII may generate the functional modules. However, it remains unknown the molecular basis for the formation of anatomical cell clusters in MEC and how the anatomical modules affect functional modules in the MEC. Here, we hypothesized that the cell clusters may be generated by cell-cell-mediated interaction/repulsion.\n\nMethods: As the Eph receptors B1-3 and their ligands, the Ephrin-Bs, are well known as initiators of cell-contact-mediated neuromigratory signals, we first comprehensively examined their expression patterns in the MEC of adult mouse by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH). We also examined the effect of EphB/Ephrin-Bs knockout (KO) on the formation of cell clusters.\n\nResults: Among EphB/Ephrin-B family genes, we found EphB1 and EphrinB2 were selectively expressed in MECII. Double-FISH analysis revealed that EphB1 was expressed in Reelin+ cells, while Ephrin-B2 was expressed in Wfs1+ cells. Next, we examined their expression pattern in the MEC during developmental stage. At postnatal day 0 (P0), EphB1 was already expressed in Reelin+ cells in MECII. At that time, no cell clusters were identified in MECII by nuclear staining. Rather, Ephrin-B2+ cells were located in the layer V of MEC at P0. At P2, Ephrin-B2+ cells have migrated to layer II and formed cell clusters in the MECII. At P4, the Ephrin-B2+ cells have expressed Wfs1. Finally, we examined the effect of EphB/Ephrin-Bs knockout (KO) on the formation of cell clusters. We found that the cell clusters in the MECII of the Ephrin-B2 hetero knockout mice were severely impaired. We also found that the cell clusters became smaller in the EphB1 and EphB2 double homo-knockout mice.\n\nConclusions: These results suggest that the Eph/Ephrin repulsion signaling between Reelin+ and Wfs1+ cells is critical for formation of cell clusters in the MECII during early postnatal development.\n\nKeywords: Medial Entorhinal Cortex, Alzheimer Disease, Spatial Representation, Grid Cell\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP8. Prenatal Immune Origins of Brain Aging: Impact of Sex and Reproductive Status\n\nJill Goldstein*, Kyoko Konishi, Sarah Aroner, Hang Lee, Anne Remington, Tanuja Chitnis, Stephen Buka, Mady Hornig, Stuart Tobet\n\nMassachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, Boston, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: With an ever-increasing aging population, it is critical to understand early antecedents to brain aging to target for intervention and prevention of disorders of the brain. There is increasing evidence of fetal antecedents to adult memory impairments, potentially through immune pathway disruptions. However, most of this work is in animal models. Male and female brains develop and age differently, thus using a sex differences lens is critical for identification of early biomarkers of risk and resilience. Here, we hypothesized that in utero exposure to maternal pro-inflammatory cytokines will have sex-selective effects on specific brain circuitry regulating memory and immune function that will be retained across the lifespan. Using a unique prenatal cohort, we tested this hypothesis in 197 adult offspring, equally divided by sex, who were exposed and unexposed to an adverse in utero maternal immune environment and followed to age 55.\n\nMethods: 197 adults (ages 45–55; 95F:102M) recruited from the New England Family Study (NEFS) underwent a blood draw, clinical assessments, and structural/functional MRI (s/fMRI). NEFS is a unique prenatal cohort of offspring currently followed for >60 years whose mothers were followed through pregnancy with serial blood draws. Maternal cytokine levels (IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1 β, IL-10) were assayed from sera collected at the beginning of the 3rd trimester, a critical period of the sexual differentiation of the brain. In midlife, adult offspring underwent an fMRI verbal encoding task (using 3T Siemens Trio and SPM12 for analyses), and β weights were extracted from memory circuitry regions (FDR-corrected p-values for multiple comparisons were used). Immune proteomics were also conducted on adult offspring sera and associations between prenatal maternal cytokines and the offspring adult NLRP3 inflammasome (FGF-2, IL-1β, IL-18, and IL-1RA) was assessed, with inflammasome dichotomized as any vs. no analytes >75th percentile of sex-specific distributions. Face-Name Associative Memory Exam (FNAME) and Buschke Selective Reminding Test assessed associative and verbal memory, respectively. Menopausal staging was determined by serology according to STRAW-10 criteria. Generalized estimating equation (GEE)-based generalized linear models were conducted to test associations between prenatal cytokines and midlife offspring memory outcomes and immune function. Models were run overall and by sex (95 women; 102 men) and reproductive status (35 Pre, 28 Peri, 32 Post). Sex differences and the impact of menopausal stage were assessed using an interaction term, and adjusted for intrafamilial correlations, offspring age, parental socioeconomic status, and maternal race.\n\nResults: Sex by IL-6 interactions were significant across ventral lateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC; in BA47 and BA45) (Dorsal: pFDR = 0.03; Mid: pFDR = 0.03; Ventral: pFDR = 0.03) and at a trend level in hippocampus (HIPP) (right: pFDR = 0.09; left pFDR = 0.10). In men but not women, elevated maternal IL-6 was significantly associated with lower task-evoked BOLD activity in VLPFC (Mid: β = -0.47, pFDR = 0.02; Ventral: β = -0.30, pFDR = 0.05) and left HIPP (β = -0.17, pFDR = 0.05). Although no associations between prenatal cytokines and memory outcomes were found in women overall, in postmenopausal women alone, higher maternal IL-6 was significantly associated with poor memory performance (FNAME: β = -0.83, pFDR = 0.01) and higher inflammasome levels (OR = 6.51, p = 0.05), a finding in men that was a trend (OR = 2.19, p = 0.08) and attenuated with adjustment for age. Further, higher maternal TNF-α exposure was significantly associated with lower FNAME performance (β = -0.74, pFDR = 0.02) in postmenopausal women; associations for TNF-α were not significant for men.\n\nConclusions: Here, using a unique prenatal cohort followed into midlife, we demonstrated that adverse prenatal maternal immune activation during the sexual differentiation of the brain was significantly associated with long-lasting effects on memory circuitry and immune function in midlife, that was sex-dependent, region-specific, and, within women, reproductive stage-dependent. Results suggest time-sensitive prenatal adverse exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines plays a key role in disrupting developmentally-sensitive neuroimmune interactions in sexually-dimorphic vulnerable regions, such as memory circuitry, effects that are retained into midlife.\n\nKeywords: Sex Differences, Memory, Developmental Origins, Prenatal Exposure, Immunity\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP9. Deficits in Behavioral Pattern Separation Emerge in Middle-Aged Mice After Early Life Adversity\n\nWei-li Chang*, Adrienne Santiago, Hannah Chung, Karly Tegang, Camila Demaestri, Clara Stucke, Kevin G. Bath, Rene Hen\n\nColumbia University and New York State Psychiatric Institute, New York, New York, United States\n\nBackground: People who experience early life adversity (ELA) are at increased the risk for developing psychiatric illnesses in adulthood, including mood and anxiety disorders. Among patients with mood and anxiety disorders, many individuals display an overgeneralization of negative memories and of fear responses to emotional stimuli. This overgeneralization is thought to be related to impairments in pattern separation, or the process of separating similar or overlapping information into distinct neural representations. The dentate gyrus (DG) region of the hippocampus is thought to mediate pattern separation, which can be measured in humans and rodents using behavioral pattern separation tasks. Additionally, the continued development of new neurons throughout adulthood in the subgranular zone of the DG, a process known as adult hippocampal neurogenesis (AHN), has been shown to support behavioral pattern separation. Manipulations that increase or decrease levels of AHN can increase or decrease behavioral pattern separation performance, respectively. In the current study, we used a mouse model for ELA and then tested behavioral pattern separation in adulthood before measuring histological markers of AHN.\n\nMethods: c57BL/6J pups are reared with limited bedding and nesting material from postnatal day (P)4-P11 before returning to standard housing conditions. Male and female mice are used for all experiments. In young-adult (11-12 weeks old, N = 7-11 per sex per group) and middle-aged (11-12 months old, N = 5-11 per sex per group), behavioral pattern separation was tested using a fear discrimination task that contextual fear conditioning and two similar contexts across several days. Successful fear discrimination was achieved when animals distinguished between the conditioned fear context “A” and a similar, neutral context “B” that was not paired with foot shock, as measured by a significant difference in freezing behavior. Young adult mice were exposed to contexts A and B in a randomized order, while middle aged mice were always exposed to context A and then B each day. After behavioral testing is completed, brains were perfused for immunohistochemical staining and quantification of doublecortin (DCX).\n\nResults: In young adult (YA) mice, there was no significant effect of ELA or sex on initial contextual fear conditioning, but a significant group by sex interaction (p < 0.01) and decreased freezing after fear conditioning only in female ELA mice. In middle-aged (MA) mice, there was an overall effect of ELA (p < 0.005) and sex (p < 0.05), but no significant group by sex interaction on initial contextual fear conditioning. MA-ELA mice had decreased freezing after fear conditioning and male MA mice had lower overall freezing rates than female MA mice. Both YA and MA mice demonstrated similar levels of freezing to contexts A and B at the beginning of the pattern separation task. Additionally, MA mice still required multiple days to discriminate between contexts despite the ‘easier’ non-randomized design, indicating an overall decrease in pattern separation performance with age. Initial analyses of data from YA mice did not show an effect of ELA or sex on fear discrimination. However, in MA mice, fear discrimination was impaired by ELA in both males and females. Histological analysis of doublecortin (DCX) staining did not find any differences in YA mice after ELA. Analysis of DCX in MA mice will also be presented.\n\nConclusions: In the current study, we demonstrate that ELA alters fear conditioning in young adult and middle-aged mice. In contrast, behavioral pattern separation impairment after ELA becomes more pronounced in middle-aged mice, and middle-aged mice also required a less difficult fear discrimination paradigm compared to young adult mice. We also evaluated the relationship between behavioral pattern separation differences and markers of AHN in the dentate gyrus of both age groups. As behavioral pattern separation performance, as well as levels of AHN, are known to decrease with age, the effects of ELA on these measures may compound over time and have a greater impact later in life.\n\nKeywords: Pattern Separation, Early-Life Adversity, Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP10. Transcriptomic Signatures of Basal Forebrain Cholinergic Neurons Across Lifespan\n\nMala Ananth*, Ronald Kim, David Talmage, Lorna Role\n\nNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: Acetylcholine is a key neuromodulator in the brain that is critical for attention, wakefulness, mood, and memory. Cholinergic neurons, neurons that synthesize and release acetylcholine, coordinate neuronal activity brain-wide to promote attention to salient stimuli and facilitate learning. In fact, marked reductions of this cell type are a hallmark of late-stage AD. In aging, we find that significant reductions in the integrity of cholinergic projections (in both humans and rodents) are an early, unique feature of age-related cognitive decline. However, these changes are not uniformly observed across the brain. That is, some cholinergic circuits are affected far sooner and to a much greater degree than others. Thus far, the molecular determinants of the selective, early vulnerability of subsets of BFCNs are not known. Several factors could contribute to this heterogeneity across BFCN subpopulations including birthdate, projection target and gene expression profiles. Understanding the factors underlying BFCN diversity is critical to understanding the role of acetylcholine in cognition and its particular vulnerability in cognitive decline. In these studies, we first asked if cholinergic neurons could be distinguished by unique gene expression profiles, and second, whether any functionally unique clusters were specifically vulnerable across lifespan.\n\nMethods: Given the sparsity of cholinergic neurons throughout the basal forebrain, a detailed classification of this population has been challenging thus far. To overcome this, we used a genetic strategy where cholinergic nuclei were specifically labeled with a nuclear membrane targeted GFP (Sun1-sfGFP X Chat-Cre mice). We isolated nuclei from dissections of the full anterior to posterior extent of the basal forebrain from male and female young (2.5 month) and aged (12-18 month) mice. Using fluorescence assisted cell sorting (FACS), we enriched our samples for cholinergic nuclei by selecting based on GFP expression. Single nucleus RNAseq libraries were prepared using 10X chromium technology and sequenced using the Illumina sequencing platform. We used the R-toolkit Seurat along with associated R toolboxes for detailed bioinformatics analysis.\n\nResults: Our preliminary dataset included over 20 thousand high-quality GFP-positive captured nuclei in young male and female mice. After additional quality control, we normalized 6 individually collected datasets (3 male and 3 female) and filtered the data by choline acetyltransferase expression (ChAT, the synthetic enzyme for acetylcholine and a marker of cholinergic neurons). Using unbiased clustering approaches, we identified 25 unique clusters of cholinergic neurons in young mice, representing far more diversity across the basal forebrain than initially hypothesized. These clusters were equivalently represented across all datasets. Using Seurat, we identified biomarkers for each of our isolated BFCN clusters. We performed preliminary validation of these biomarkers using the Allen Brain in-situ atlas in slices across the forebrain. We found that the expression of these unique factors was not governed by the traditional anatomical boundaries by which we typically define and target BFCNs. Ongoing analyses investigate the patterning of these clusters spatially across the basal forebrain using the 10x Xenium platform, and the selective vulnerability or resilience of these subpopulations with age.\n\nConclusions: These studies provide valuable insights into the incredible diversity and functional organization within the basal forebrain cholinergic system. Thus far, a thorough analysis of the gene expression profiles of BFCNs has not been conducted. This dataset provides an essential foundation for future studies to be able to target functionally distinct cholinergic neuron populations that differentially participate in behavior, and are differentially affected by age. By examining features in resilient populations that are absent from vulnerable populations, we can begin to identify factors by which to support vulnerable BFCN circuits in aging, AD, and related dementias.\n\nKeywords: Cholinergic System, RNAseq, Aging\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP11. Relationships Between Childhood Adversity, Epigenetic Aging, and Obesity\n\nZachary Harvanek*, Anastacia Kudinova, Samantha Wong, Ke Xu, Leslie Brick, Teresa Daniels, Carmen Marsit, Amber Burt, Rajita Sinha, Audrey Tyrka\n\nYale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States\n\nBackground: Childhood adversity is linked to psychological, behavioral, and physical health problems, including obesity and cardiometabolic disease. Epigenetic alterations have been proposed as one pathway through which the effects of early life stress and adversity might persist into adulthood. Epigenetic mechanisms have also been proposed to explain why cardiometabolic health can vary greatly between individuals with similar Body Mass Index (BMIs). The purpose of this study was to characterize the relationship between childhood adversity and markers of accelerated epigenetic aging in adulthood and examine the link between childhood adversity and obesity and metabolic risk markers. After identifying these relationships, we then examined moderator effects of accelerated aging on the association between childhood adversity, obesity, and insulin resistance.\n\nMethods: We evaluated two independent cross-sectional cohorts of healthy adults, one of which explicitly recruited individuals with childhood adversity and control participants (n = 195), and the other a general community sample (n = 477). In these cohorts, we examine associations between childhood adversity, epigenetic aging, and metabolic health. DNA methylation was assessed using Illumina-based arrays (EPIC and 450k arrays). Initial analyses utilized the GrimAge epigenetic clock, which has been demonstrated to correlate with morbidity and mortality. Subsequent analyses re-examined the data utilizing principal component-based epigenetic clocks.\n\nResults: Childhood adversity predicted accelerated epigenetic aging in both cohorts, both utilizing a dichotomous yes/no classification (both p < 0.01) as well as a continuous measure using the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) (both p < 0.05). Further investigation demonstrated that CTQ subscales for physical and sexual abuse (both p < 0.05) were associated with accelerated epigenetic aging in both cohorts, whereas physical and emotional neglect were not. In both cohorts, higher CTQ was also associated with higher BMI and increased insulin resistance (both p < 0.05). Finally, we demonstrate a moderating effect of BMI on the relationship between epigenetic aging and insulin resistance where epigenetic age acceleration predicts insulin resistance specifically at higher BMIs. Follow-up analyses with principal component-based epigenetic clocks demonstrated largely consistent results.\n\nConclusions: These results, which were largely replicated between two independent cohorts, suggest that interactions between epigenetics, obesity, and metabolic health may be important mechanisms through which childhood adversity contributes to long-term physical and metabolic health effects. While the current study uses cross-sectional data, it suggests that childhood adversity may increase the risk of insulin resistance through epigenetic changes. Future studies may be able to utilize both psychological and epigenetic markers to identify treatments that will be helpful from both a psychiatric and physical health framework.\n\nKeywords: Epigenetic Clock, Obesity, Childhood Adversity, Insulin Resistance, Epigenetic Age Acceleration\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP12. [18F]PF-06445974 Pet Ligand Can Measure LPS-Mediated Changes in PDE4B in Rat Brain: A Comparison With TSPO\n\nPaul Parcon*, Carson Knoer, Sami Zoghbi, Jeih-San Liow, Cheryl Morse, Victor Pike, Robert Innis\n\nNational Institutes of Health, Rockville, Maryland, United States\n\nBackground: Phosphodiesterase-4B (PDE4B) terminates cAMP signaling and inhibition of PDE4B has antidepressant-like effects in animals, and anti-inflammatory effects in human disorders (e.g., psoriasis and COPD). We developed [18F]PF-06445974 (PF974) as a radioligand that preferentially binds to the PDE4B subtype to study it in humans with major depressive disorder and in animals as a potential biomarker of neuroinflammation. We demonstrate here that inflammogen lipopolysaccharide (LPS) increases radioligand binding, without significant contamination of radiometabolites. That is, phosphorylation of PDE4 has been shown to markedly increase both its enzymatic activity and its affinity to binding of radiolabeled inhibitors.\n\nMethods: A total of 10 male Wild-type Sprague-Dawley rats injected with LPS at various doses, and were imaged either with PF974 or TSPO-ligand PBR28. Rat brains were collected after tracer injection and radiometabolite studies were performed using HPLC. Pre-block and displacement studies were performed with rolipram injection IV at 1 mg/kg.\n\nResults: At one day after LPS injection, binding of [18F]PF-06445974 in the lesioned striatum increased about 50% compared to the contralateral region. To confirm the specificity of the radioligand binding, rolipram (1 mg/kg iv) preblock decreased binding to background levels. Post-mortem HPLC results showed increased radioactivity in injected striatum compared to contralateral striatum, and was mainly parent radioligand, implying patent blood-brain barrier. PF974 difference was not noted after 8 days, whereas TSPO binding remained increased after 8 days.\n\nConclusions: Local injection of LPS in rat brain increased radioligand uptake without significant contamination of plasma-based radiometabolites; which is transient and associated with active neuroinflammation, whereas TSPO uptake remained increased after 8 days. The increased binding may be caused by the phosphorylation/activation of PDE4B and suggest that PDE4B imaging may function as a dynamic biomarker of neuroinflammation in the brain.\n\nKeywords: F-18 PET Imaging, Neuroinflammation, LPS, Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE4)\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP13. Sex Differences in Basal Cortisol Levels Across Body Fluid Compartments in a Cross-Sectional Study of Healthy Adults\n\nKatharine Liang*, Elizabeth Colasurdo, Ge Li, Jane Shofer, Douglas Galasko, Joseph Quinn, Martin Farlow, Charles Wilkinson, Elaine Peskind\n\nVA Puget Sound Health Care System/University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, Washington, United States\n\nBackground: Many studies have moved toward saliva and peripheral blood sampling for studying cortisol, even in relation to disorders of the brain. However, the degree to which peripheral cortisol reflects central cortisol levels has yet to be comprehensively described. Data describing the effect that biological characteristics such as age and sex have on cortisol levels across compartments is also limited. To assess the relationships of cortisol levels across cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), saliva, and plasma (total and free) compartments, we conducted a secondary analysis of data collected from a previously published study and described the effects of age and sex on these relationships.\n\nMethods: Participants were healthy community volunteers (n = 157) of both sexes, aged 20-85 years, who agreed to data and specimen banking as a part of study participation. Samples were collected in academic outpatient settings in 2001-2004 as a part of a multi-site cross-sectional observation study. Associations among cortisol levels and between cortisol and age and/or sex were evaluated using Pearson correlation coefficients and linear regression respectively.\n\nResults: Correlation of CSF cortisol was strongest with that of total plasma (r = 0.49, p < 0.0001) and weakest with that of saliva (r = 0.28, p < 0.001). Sex but not age was a significant modifier of these relationships. In examining the influence of age and sex on cortisol in each separate body fluid compartment, CSF cortisol levels trended higher with older age in men (R2 = 0.31, p < 0.001) but not women. In contrast, saliva cortisol decreased slightly with age (R2 = 0.05, p = 0.021) and no correlation was found between free or total plasma cortisol and age (R2≤0.02, p≥0.28). Sex was not a significant modifier of age-related trends in peripheral cortisol. Age-related cortisol binding globulin trends differed by sex but did not correlate with sex differences in cortisol levels in any compartment.\n\nConclusions: This study is the first to our knowledge to examine the relationships in cortisol concentrations simultaneously among total and free plasma, saliva, and CSF compartments in a healthy adult population of both sexes across the adult life span. It provides important insights on how cortisol levels from different compartments are intercorrelated as well as how cortisol concentrations vary with biological characteristics of age and sex. Our findings demonstrate complicated relationships among cortisol, age, and sex -- relationships that varied by compartment. Variability in the correlations between central and peripheral cortisol discourages the use of peripheral cortisol as a direct surrogate for central cortisol measures. Further investigation of how mechanistic drivers interact with biological factors such as sex will be necessary to fully understand the dynamics of cortisol regulation across fluid compartments.\n\nKeywords: Cortisol, CSF Biomarkers, Biology of Aging, Sex Differences, Peripheral Biomarker\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP14. Chronic Stress Enhances Working Memory in Aging Male Rats via Corticosteroid Receptor-Dependent Adaptation of the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis\n\nTyler Cox, Neal Hammond, Christian Ryan, Haley Dufala, Joseph McQuail*\n\nUniversity of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina, United States\n\nBackground: Working memory, which depends on the prefrontal cortex (PFC), declines with age. PFC neurons express glucocorticoid (GR) and mineralocorticoid (MR) receptors that bind stress hormones and regulate cortical and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity when challenged during stressful experiences. While HPA axis dysregulation is evident with advancing age, no studies have systematically examined the effects of chronic stress on working memory over the full lifespan. This omission is significant because epidemiological data implies cumulative stress exposure can exacerbate risk for memory-related disorders in advanced aging. However, stress and stress hormone signaling may also impart short-term enhancement of working memory and PFC cellular activity, but the moderating effects of chronological age on PFC functions during chronic stress are not well-studied. To address this gap, we evaluated PFC-dependent working memory in normally aging male and female rats and, subsequently, investigated the role for GR or MR signaling and HPA axis adaptation on working memory during stress in aging.\n\nMethods: Our studies used male or female F344 rats at 6-, 14-, or 24-months (mo.). We assessed PFC-dependent working memory using a delayed match-to-sample operant task. This task taxes working memory by requiring rats to remember the location of a pseudo-randomly selected lever for delays that range from 0 to 24 s. While working memory testing was ongoing, we assigned similar numbers of each sex and age to unstressed (UNS) or chronic variable stress (CVS) treatment. CVS entailed twice-daily exposure to stressors that included forced swims, physical restraint, predator urine, or cage-flood, presented in an unpredictable order for 21 days; UNS rats underwent daily testing but without exposure to these experimental stressors. In a subset of 24-mo. males, we determined the role of GR and MR signaling by pre-treatment with mifepristone (MIF; GR antagonist), spironolactone (SPIRO; MR antagonist), or inert vehicle immediately after daily testing and 30 minutes prior to CVS; corticosterone (CORT) secretion stimulated by physical restraint was assessed at the start of CVS and every 7 days thereafter.\n\nResults: We observed that CVS interacted with chronological age and biological sex to influence working memory accuracy. In males, CVS lowered accuracy of 6 mo. rats but, surprisingly, increased accuracy of 14- and 24-mo. rats, compared to age-matched UNS. Choice accuracy of females was significantly greater compared to males and not observed to decline with age or stress. These age- and sex-specific effects of CVS on working memory accuracy were selective as CVS otherwise reduced the number of daily trials completed, lowered body weight, and increased adrenal gland weight independent of age or sex. Reduced activity, weight loss, and adrenal hypertrophy are well-established behavioral and physiological sequelae of chronic stress and reveal that males and females retain sensitivity to chronic stress across the lifespan. Considering the positive effects of CVS on working memory accuracy in 24-mo. males, we followed up on the underlying role of the HPA axis on this phenomenon. Pre-treatment of aged males with either MIF or SPIRO prevented CVS-related memory enhancement compared to vehicle-treated rats. Furthermore, pre-treatment with either MIF or SPIRO attenuated suppression of CORT secretion during acute stress throughout the CVS period. Persistently elevated levels of CORT co-occurred with larger adrenal glands of rats receiving GR or MR antagonists compared to rats that were pre-treated only with vehicle.\n\nConclusions: Jointly, these findings reveal that the effects of chronic stress on working memory are highly contingent on biological sex and chronological age. Further, enhanced working memory during stress in aged males coincides with adaptation of HPA axis responses that depends on GR or MR signaling. More broadly, these discoveries may lead to new interventions to optimize HPA axis function and improve memory over the full lifespan.\n\nKeywords: Acute and Chronic Stress, Corticosteroids, Working Memory, Prefrontal Cortex, Aging\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP15. Transient Exercise-Induced Changes of Circulating Factors in the Mouse Muscle-Brain Axis\n\nJonah Juergensmeyer, Charmi Desai, Erin Kang, Sophia Moret, Jillian Murray, Samantha Vilarino, Karina Alviña*\n\nUniversity of Florida, College of Medicine, Gainesville, Florida, United States\n\nBackground: Exercise promotes healthy cognitive aging and could be an effective non-pharmacological alternative to prevent or delay pathology associated with neurodegenerative disorders. However, mechanisms underlying such positive effects are not fully understood. Irisin, a myokine that is secreted from skeletal muscle during exercise, is linked to mechanisms that become dysfunctional in as we age, such as glucose metabolism and hippocampal neurogenesis.\n\nNevertheless, there have been contradictory reports on changes in irisin levels following exercise. Such inconsistencies might be a result of variability in experimental conditions, such as duration of exercise protocols (e.g., acute or chronic) and/or timing of tissue collection (e.g., immediately after or hours later).\n\nMethods: To determine the precise timespan of exercise-induced changes in circulating irisin, we designed exercise protocols that tested the effect of these experimental variables. We hypothesized that changes in circulating irisin concentration occur during or immediately after exercise and return to baseline shortly thereafter. To test this hypothesis, we subjected adult male and female mice to swimming or running exercise for 20 min and measured post-exercise serum irisin concentration (via ELISA) at: 0, 30, 60, or 120 min after.\n\nResults: Compared to sedentary controls, we observed a ~20% increase in male mice immediately after either exercise protocol, which decreased to baseline levels within 60 min. No changes were detected in female mice. Next, we performed a chronic exercise protocol (swimming for 20min/ day for 21 days) with a separate group of male and female mice, and measured serum irisin 24 h after the last exercise session. As expected, no difference was measured between the exercise group and the sedentary controls.\n\nConclusions: Our results suggest that irisin is released during exercise and circulating levels return to baseline within an hour. Therefore, the timing of sample collection should be carefully considered to reliably detect exercise-induced changes in circulating irisin. In addition, we observed robust sex-dependent differences, including the potential relationship between Irisin release and stress.\n\nKeywords: Physical Exercise, Acute Stress, Brain Aging, Neuroprotection, Sex-Specific Effects\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP16. Alprazolam Impairs Fear Memory and Alters Dorsoventral CA1 Neuronal Ensembles in Female Mice\n\nKameron Kaplan, Lainey Toennies, Holly Hunsberger*\n\nThe Chicago Medical School at Rosalind Franklin University, North Chicago, Illinois, United States\n\nBackground: Benzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed anxiolytic drugs that act on GABAa receptors and can result in anterograde amnesia or the inability to form new memories. Although BZDs have been in use for over 60 years, the brain regions and neuronal mechanisms responsible for this detrimental side effect are largely unknown. Additionally, continued use of BZDs could lead to memory impairment and cognitive decline later in life. Our lab has previously shown that anxiety is a strong predictor of dementia transition, specifically in women and female Alzheimer’s disease (AD) mice. However, there are conflicting results on whether anxiolytics are beneficial for treating neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD. Women were also found to be twice as likely to use BZDs. Although aged populations account for 8.4% of BZD users, the relationship between BZD use and cognitive decline is highly controversial. Previous literature has indicated both support and opposition to the hypothesis of accelerated cognitive decline in both healthy and AD populations treated with BZDs. To better understand the long-term memory deficits initiated by benzodiazepines, we aimed to analyze neuronal ensemble activation following a benzodiazepine injection prior to learning and during consolidation.\n\nMethods: To analyze the effects of BZDs on long term memory, ArcCreERT2 x eYFP mice were injected with Alprazolam 30 minutes prior to a 3-shock contextual fear conditioning (CFC) procedure. The ArcCreERT2 x eYFP mouse model allows us to tag active neuronal ensembles during an experience by using Arc as an immediate early gene (IEG) promotor. We then re-exposed mice to the same context 5 days later and euthanized mice 1 hr after exposure to examine retrieval cell activation using a second IEG, cFOS. This method allows us to determine which brain regions undergo changes after BZD injection and how these cellular changes correlate to freezing behavior (a proxy for memory). Additionally, we address the question of whether BZDs induce state-dependent memory by altering the timelines of injection to include drug administration at both time points or a drug-vehicle administration to circumvent the sedative properties of BZDs. We also analyzed how BZDs affect the initial consolidation of a fear memory by injecting mice immediately after CFC training. Data were analyzed using ANOVA, with repeated measures when appropriate. Tukey was used for all post-hoc comparisons. Alpha was set to 0.05 for all analyses. Data are expressed as means +/- SEM.\n\nResults: We found that 1) BZD-treated female mice exhibit a decrease in memory retention (p < 0.0001), 2) BZD-treated female and male mice show a decrease in memory retention with saline injection prior to re-exposure (p < 0.05), and 3) BZD injection immediately after CFC training enhances memory in male mice (p < 0.05). Cell counts revealed that BZD-treated female mice exhibit increased EYFP+ (encoding) and cFos+ (retrieval) activation in the dCA1 compared to controls (p < 0.05). However, the opposite pattern was observed in the vCA1, where BZD-treated females showed less EYFP+ and cFos+ activation (p < 0.05). These results suggest that ventral hippocampal activity is dampened with BZD injection, but the dorsal hippocampus is still actively encoding contextual information. We are further analyzing cell counts in other hippocampal and amygdala regions.\n\nConclusions: Completion of this project will help us to better understand the long-term memory deficits associated with BZDs. We also have the potential to discover novel brain regions involved in these side effects and therefore offer alternative treatment options. Our future studies will examine the impact of chronic use of BZDs on aging and Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nKeywords: Benzodiazepine, Memory, Engram, Ventral Hippocampus, Sex Differences\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP17. Downstream Drainage to Cervical Lymph Nodes is Compromised in Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: Implications for Dysregulation of Brain Fluid Homeostasis\n\nSunil Koundal*, Kaiming Xu, Hedok Lee, Joaquin Caceres Malgarejo, Graeme Mason, Arie Nakhmani, Allen Tannenbaum, Helene Benveniste\n\nYale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut, United States\n\nBackground: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is associated with dysregulation of central nervous system (CNS) fluid homeostasis manifesting as enlarged ventricles which can be reversed with abstinence. Cerebral ventriculomegaly is also observed in neurodegenerative diseases including normal pressure hydrocephalus a common disorder in older adults and remains a poorly understood pathophysiological signature. Recent studies have demonstrated that the glymphatic system when coupled to meningeal lymphatics facilitates brain waste elimination and sustains CNS fluid homeostasis. The regulators of glymphatic and lymphatic systems cross-talk for solute waste and fluid drainage to the cervical lymph nodes remain poorly understood. A major issue resides in the technical challenge of quantifying glymphatic clearance from the brain to cervical lymph nodes without direct administration of a tracer into parenchyma, a procedure that by itself can negatively impact clearance. We have developed an imaging approach with CSF administration of a tracer which when combined with computational fluid dynamic (CFD) analysis allows for tracking of mass ‘gain’ and ‘drain’ at the voxel level. The CSD approach is based on an “unbalanced” regularized optimal mass transport (urOMT) model which incorporates a source/sink term thereby allowing for quantifying mass gain and mass loss (clearance) over time. Here we demonstrate that urOMT analysis uncovers surprising defects in cervical lymph node drainage in a rat model cerebral small vessel disease known to have glymphatic system impairment. Our study highlights the potential therapeutic importance of considering compromised downstream lymph node drainage function for correcting upstream dysregulation of cerebral fluid homeostasis and glymphatic transport function observed in neurodegenerative disease states including AUD.\n\nMethods: We performed dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) with GadoSpin-P contrast injection into the CSF in 10-month-old female Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats (N = 7) and spontaneously hypertensive stroke prone (SHRSP) rats (N = 6) which is rat model of cerebral small vessel disease. We used a custom-made transmit RF coil for signal excitation and a 2-cm surface radiofrequency loop coil, positioned over the neck of the rat was used as a receiver. 3D T1-weighted images were acquired at a voxel size of 0.008 mm3, before and 160min after GadoSpin-P infusion. The raw time series of 3D DCE-MRI data underwent intensity normalization and smoothing with the full-width, half-maximum Gaussian smoothing kernel of 0.1 mm, and the voxel-wise percent signal change from baseline was calculated. An anatomical mask of the base of the brain and cervical lymph nodes was used to extract the corresponding time series of DCE-MRI data which was fed into the urOMT model. Sample sizes were chosen on the basis of similar experiments. No randomization was performed. Two-group comparisons were made using a two-tailed unpaired independent t-test assuming unequal variances. For the urOMT time trajectories of mass gain and mass loss rates, a linear mixed model for repeated measures (LMM-RM) with independent variables including strain (WKY vs SHRSP), time and the time x strain interaction were fit to compare the mean differences of different outcomes between strains and between time points after tracer administration within each strain of rats. Group differences were calculated using a post-hoc pairwise Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) with adjustments for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction.\n\nResults: There were no differences in MRI defined anatomical features or size of the deep cervical lymph nodes (dcLN) across WKY and SHRSP rats (volume, p-value > 0.05). Conventional kinetic analysis of the time signal curves extracted from the raw parametric DCE-MRI images at the level of the deep cervical lymph nodes (dcLN) did not reveal differences in across WKY and SHRSP rats: Time-to-peak (p-value = 0.391), full width at half maximum (p-value = 0.578) and peak magnitude (p-value = 0.104). We next analyzed the series of urOMT ‘r-flux’ maps, which was used to extract the time varying spatial patterns of mass ‘gain’ and drainage from the lymph nodes. In WKY rats the progression of mass gain in the lymph node dominated for the 60-min and then rapidly declined, whereas the time trajectory of drainage followed a sigmoid curve pattern with rapid increases at ~80-90 min which was sustained for the rest of the experimental time period. In contrast, in the SHRSP rats mass gain in the lymph node dominated over mass loss over the first 120-130min, and drainage was minimal. The LMM-RM analysis revealed statistically significant time*group differences in dcLN trajectories of mass gain (p-value = 0.014) and loss (p-value = 0.002) across groups.\n\nConclusions: We uncovered significant impairment of cervical lymph node function in a rat model of cerebral small vessel disease known to be associated with a decrease in glymphatic transport. The new information was uncovered by applying the urOMT analysis to DCE-MRI data which allows for tracking of mass gain and drainage in real time. Our study highlights the potential therapeutic importance of considering compromised downstream lymph node drainage function for correcting upstream dysregulation of cerebral fluid homeostasis and glymphatic transport function observed in neurodegenerative disease states including cerebral small vessel disease.\n\nKeywords: Fluid Homeostasis, Glymphatic System, Lymphatics, Neurodegenerative Disease, Waste Clearance\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP19. Dopamine Release in Response to Cues Predicting Avoidable Aversive Stimuli Differentiates Behavioral Responses: Escape Versus Helplessness\n\nStephanie Cajigas*, Maxime Chevee, Jaela Melton, Michael Leonard, Erin Calipari\n\nVanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee, United States\n\nBackground: The execution of adaptive behavior depends on the ability of organisms to predict potential threats in their environment. To this end, animals learn to predict when aversive stimuli will occur and learn what actions are necessary to avoid contexts and situations with potential negative outcomes. In some situations, negative outcomes are avoidable, while in others they are not. The inability to effectively discriminate between these situations and update information about these relationships is a hallmark of pathological disease states, such as PTSD and anxiety disorders. Here we utilized a negative reinforcement paradigm – where mice can perform an operant response to avoid a series of footshocks - to investigate dopamine release patterns throughout learning and determine how these neural signals can differentiate animals that adaptively learn to avoid versus those that do not.\n\nMethods: The optical dopamine sensor dLight in conjunction with in-vivo fiber photometry was used to monitor real-time dopamine responses in the nucleus accumbens core (NAc). The negative reinforcement paradigm lasted 15 days, where mice underwent 30-minute training sessions. Each trial began with a 15-second tone and lever presentation, followed by a train of five 0.5 sec, 0.5mA shocks separated by 1 sec. Mice could respond at any time from cue onset to the last shock presentation (i.e. during the discriminative cue). After which, a house light went on (also presented with a lever press and cessation of future shocks). There was a variable ITI (30-90sec), then a new trial began. Mice then went through an FR1 positive reinforcement schedule with sucrose presentation, until the number of active lever presses accounted for 80% or greater of the total lever pressing. After completing, this instrumental learning phase, mice went back into the initial negative reinforcement paradigm for 10 days with white noise instead of a tone for the discriminative cue. Dopamine release was assessed around behaviorally relevant events in male and female mice. Sample sizes range from 3-10 mice per group.\n\nResults: Mice were separated into groups based on task performance. Female learners displayed increased lever pressing to greater than 80% correct trials and a decrease in freezing time to the cue as they learned to avoid the shocks. Female non-learners displayed a comparable initial freezing time to the predictive cue that was maintained across days and minimal operant responses. Female learners displayed an increase in dopamine release to the cue, while non-learners displayed a decrease. The dopamine response increased to the first shock over time similarly in both groups compared to the following shocks; however, by the last day of the task, there was a significant increase in dopamine release to the first shock in learners and non-learners compared to the first day. In males, a similar pattern emerged where non-learners displayed a decrease in dopamine release to the cue over time and an increase in dopamine release to the first shock. Following positive reinforcement acquisition, the initially classified non-learner females were still unable to acquire negative reinforcement despite changing the discriminative cue. Non-learner females displayed a decrease in dopamine release to the cue that did not change over time and an increase in dopamine release to the first shock that was larger than the release to subsequent shocks and increased over time.\n\nConclusions: Despite the escapable nature of these shocks, many mice developed a freezing response to the cue, rather than learning to avoid. The mice that did not learn to avoid had future deficits in negative reinforcement learning as well, despite successful instrumental learning, suggesting that this learned experience ultimately influenced behavior in other contexts. Interestingly, there were still changes in dopamine release throughout training in non-learners, such as changes in the neural responses to the shock itself. These data demonstrate behavioral changes dependent on learning ability and changes in dopamine signaling over time may underly how a subject navigates their environment and perceives the availability of behavioral outcomes (ability to escape shocks vs perceived inescapability).\n\nKeywords: Negative Reinforcement, Dopamine, In Vivo Fiber Photometry\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP20. Spatial Analysis of Transcriptional Changes and Connectivity After Threat Conditioning\n\nJoy Otten, Luise Rostin, Shu Dan, Alex Profetto, Roy Lardenoije, Torsten Klengel*\n\nMcLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Belmont, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: Maladaptive transcriptional alterations within complex neurocircuitries are central to many stress- and trauma-related disorders. However, how gene expression changes concertedly across brain regions remains largely unknown.\n\nMethods: We generated spatial transcriptomics RNAseq (stRNAseq) data in C57BL/6 mice exposed to auditory threat conditioning (n = 8 per group), capturing the early memory consolidation period. Bioinformatic analyses focused on between group differences and mapping transcriptional connectivity.\n\nResults: Unsupervised clustering analysis of stRNAseq data revealed 33 subregions in concordance with known anatomical structures. Cluster specific expression markers were in alignment with in-situ hybridization data of the Allen Brain Atlas. Differential gene expression analysis between threat conditioned and control animals resulted in a total of 415 DEGs (p.FDR < 0.05, n = 8 pergroup) across subregions and RNAscope analyses confirmed expression differences in selected subregions. In addition, transcriptional connectivity network analyses showed a coordinated transcriptional response to threat conditioning across 15 brain regions (permutation p < 0.05) including the piriform area, caudoputamen, cortical layers, and the thalamic reticular nucleus.\n\nConclusions: Our results indicate a brain-wide, coordinated transcriptional response to threat conditioning with transcriptional network analyses suggesting additional brain regions as part of the threat neurocircuitry.\n\nKeywords: Spatial Transcriptomics, Threat Conditioning, Brain Circuits\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP21. Decoding Claustrum Neuropeptidergic Control of Stress-Induced Binge Eating\n\nJingyi Chen*, Leandra Mangieri, Sophia Mar, Sean Piantadosi, Varshitha Pinnaka, Phoenix Davis, Benjamin Land, Michael Bruchas\n\nUniversity of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States\n\nBackground: The experience of stress promotes the development and persistence of binge eating behaviors. However, how and where stress-induced binge-eating behaviors happen is still largely unknown. The dynorphin (dyn)/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) neuropeptide system is well known for playing a crucial role in mediating the dysphoric and anhedonic aspects of stress, which act to promote reward-seeking and drug abuse-related behaviors. Recent studies show a reduction in binge eating behavior while maintaining normal hunger states when treated with opioid receptor antagonists. Given these findings, we aimed to explore the neural circuit basis of dynorphinergic control of stress-induced binge-like eating behavior in a mouse model.\n\nMethods: We first established a behavior model for stress-induced binge-like eating behaviors. Mice (N > 10) experienced either 15 mins of the forced swim or in an empty bucket before being given ad-lib access to both palatable foods (high fat, high sugar, HPD) and regular chow for 1 hr. Their brains were extracted later for histology analysis for cFos activation. For the knockout experiment, we inject AAV-CRE-GFP virus in either WT (N = 9) or Kor-cKO (N = 4) mice and perform behavior analysis. Pharmacology testing was done with an IP injection of 5mg/kg U50 (N = 8) or local norBNI infusion (20ul/ml) in the CLS. For single-photon in vivo recordings, AAV-DIO-GCaMP was injected in the CLS in Kor-Cre mice (N = 3), and their neural activities were recorded during 1 hr feeding in stress and non-stress conditions. Similarly, either AAV-CaMKII-GCaMP (N = 10) or AAV-DIO-klight (N = 6) was injected in the CLS, and neural activities were recorded using fiber photometry. To identify the dynorphin input to the CLS, Pdyn-cre mice (N = 3) were co-injected with AAV-CaMKII-mcheery+ rAAV-DIO-GFP in the CLS, and their entire brain was examined for GFP+ cells. For the circuit manipulation experiment, AAV-CaMKII-GCaMP was injected in the CLS, and either AAV-DIO-Chrimson (N = 5) or AAV-DIO-mcherry (N = 4) was injected in the anterior insular cortex in Pdyn-Cre mice. We performed fiber photometry recordings in the CLS population while stimulating the terminals from the anterior insular cortex.\n\nResults: We found mice that experienced 15 mins of the forced swim will significantly increase their food intake of familiar palatable food (high fat, high sugar, HPD) compared to non-stressed mice. We also found increased cFos-positive cells in the claustrum (CLS), a subcortical structure with highly abundant expression of KORs, after mice developed this stress-induced binge-eating behavior. When targeting CLS-KOR+ cells through viral-mediated knockout, we have found intact KOR signaling in CLS is necessary for elevated binge-like eating in stressed mice. In vivo cell recordings in CLS-CaMKII+ cells using fiber photometry revealed increased neural activity in initiating HPD feeding bouts compared to the non-stressed mice. And this effect is further enhanced when mice are given U50, which is a KOR agonist. When infusing norBNI (KOR-antagonist) locally in CLS, we were able to block stress-induced binge eating, which indicates that dynorphin release is critical for this behavior. We further characterize and dissect the dynorphinergic components of this behavior using dynorphin biosensors Klight in CLS-KOR+ cells and single-cell imaging while mice perform binge-eating behaviors. To identify the source of dynorphin releases, we performed retrograde tracing and found anterior insular cortex (AIC) sends dynorphinergic inputs to CLS. When we stimulated AIC-Pdyn+ to CLS terminals, we observed increased activities in the CLS-CaMKII+ populations.\n\nConclusions: Forced swim stress induces binge-eating behaviors in mice, activating neurons in the Claustrum (CLS). This behavior relies on the dynorphin (dyn)/kappa opioid receptor (KOR) neuropeptide system in the Claustrum. We have established a functional dynorphinergic input from the anterior insular cortex (AIC) to the CLS. We hypothesize that AIC releases dynorphin in the CLS during stress-induced binge eating behaviors and forms a disinhibition circuit within CLS. By characterizing the neural circuit mechanisms and cell activity dynamics within the CLS, we aim to understand how neuropeptides regulate stress-induced binge eating.\n\nKeywords: Dynorphin, Binge Eating Disorder, Claustrum, Insular Cortex\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP22. Testing Optimal Glucocorticoid Mediated Stress Conditions for Modeling the Multi-Omic Signatures of Stress-Associated Psychiatric Disorders With iPSC Derived Neural Cell Types\n\nCameron Pernia*, Christos Chatzinakos, Aarti Jajoo, Chris DiPietro, Clara Snijders, Marina Soliva-Estruch, Justina Lugenbuhl, Artemis Iatrou, Kerry Ressler, Nikolaos Daskalakis\n\nHarvard Medical School McLean Hospital, Belmont, Massachusetts, United States\n\nBackground: Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a common complex psychiatric disorder affecting 6.1% of Americans, and no efficacious cellular models exists for testing novel therapeutics. Our group recently published (Chatzinakos, Pernia et al. AJP 2023) the first single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) study of human DLPFC brain samples across PTSD, MDD, and healthy controls to identify cell type specific transcriptional effects, and recapitulated PTSD unique effects in vitro with iPSC derived neurons exposed to 100nM Dexamethasone (DEX). What combination of in vitro cell types and DEX doses that best recapitulate individual stress related disorders (PTSD, MDD, etc) are still unknown. In this work, we attempt to identify in vitro conditions that best recapitulate PTSD and other stress-associated disorders’ multi-omic signatures to assist future psychiatric disease modeling studies, and to better understand the role glucocorticoids play in molecular psychiatry.\n\nMethods: Two healthy control iPSC lines were differentiated into neural stem cells (NSCs), then immature neurons (INs), and neuron cultures. At each stage, three samples were treated with a DEX dose curve (0nM, 5nM, 25nM, 100nM), and harvested for RNA and DNA methylation (DNAm). RNA and DNAm triplicates were pooled into 32 separate samples, then RiboZero sequenced at ~70M read depths or Illumina 850K EPIC arrayed respectively. RNA and DNAm differential analysis was performed by voom/limma, and gene networks were studied with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). We examined if previous published stress associated psychiatric disorders clinical datasets could be recapitulated by our DEX treated cells using spearman correlations, rank-rank hypergeometric overlap (RRHO), and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA).\n\nResults: After demonstrating each iPSC derived cell type expresses varying levels of the glucocorticoid receptors (GR), RNA-seq and EPIC arrays were performed. Less developed cell types (iPSC and NSCs) displayed fewer differentially expressed genes (DEGs) then the more neuronal cell types (INs and neuron) when exposed to DEX, while only the INs and neurons had consistent DEGs across the DEX dose trajectory. WCGNA of DEX DEGs in INs and neurons identified gene modules associated with protein regulation, vesicle transport, and the synapse. RRHO and normalized enrichment score (NES) analysis of DEX DEGs with stress associated psychiatric datasets showed distinct enrichments across various in vitro conditions with PTSD and MDD. iPSC derived neuronal cells’ DEX DEGs were also enriched for PTSD and MDD GWAS genes. Most differentially methylated genes (DMGs) due to DEX across all cell types were associated with stress or psychiatry. GSEA of DMGs due to DEX in the INs and neurons were enriched for neuronal and synaptic processes, similar to the RNA analysis.\n\nConclusions: While many psychiatric disorders have been studied in recent years with innovative iPSC disease modeling paradigms, PTSD research has yet to fully embrace such approaches. We have previously shown iPSC derived neurons treated with DEX are an efficacious model for studying PTSD gene expression. In this study, we explore various iPSC derived cells types and DEX dosages for best modeling individual stress associated psychiatric disease based off published clinical datasets. Intriguingly, we observed GR activation was not consistent across cell types, and that the separate analytical approaches associated certain cell types to the various psychiatric datasets. Overall, our most developed neurons treated with 100nM DEX best recreated PTSD GWAS, post mortem bulk and cell type specific gene expression, and DNAm signatures. In the future, we will use additional stem cell based approaches for modeling the functional impact of glucocorticoid mediated stress in the context of PTSD and other stress associated psychiatric disorders, in the hopes of generating a high fidelity in vitro platform for focused drug screening.\n\nKeywords: hIPSCs, Glucocorticoids, MDD, PTSD\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP23. Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells at the Choroid Plexus Mediate Psychological Stress-Induced Anxiety-Like Phenotype\n\nAmit Kumar Madeshiya*, Anilkumar Pillai\n\nThe University of Texas Health Science Center At Houston, Houston, Texas, United States\n\nBackground: Prolonged or severe stress can cause structural and functional changes in the brain. Such changes in the brain contribute to various neuropsychiatric disorders like depression and anxiety. The dysregulated immune function is known to mediate stress-induced anxiety-like behavior. Innate lymphoid cells (ILCs) are tissue-resident innate immune cells, but their role in regulating anxiety-like behavior under stress conditions is poorly understood.\n\nMethods: We used a well-validated mouse model of stress where animals were exposed to trauma and trigger via inescapable electric foot shocks to study anxiety-like phenotype. Flow cytometry analysis was performed to examine the ILC population. Realtime qPCR was performed for the mRNA expression analysis. The data were presented as mean ± SEM. Unpaired Student’s t-test was used for two-group comparisons, while Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was employed for multiple-group comparisons. Post hoc analyses were conducted using Tukey’s test. A significance level of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nResults: We found an increased anxiety-like behavior in male C57BL6/J mice (N = 12) exposed to stress in the open field test (OFT) and light/dark test (L/DT) compared to the no-stress group. The flow cytometry analysis showed that out of three (ILC1, ILC2, and ILC3) ILC subpopulations, stress induces an increase in the ILC2 population in the choroid plexus (CP) but not in the meninges. Further, depletion of ILC2s (Rag2-/-Il2rg-/- mice) significantly attenuates stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in both OFT and L/DT. The stress-induced increase in mRNA expression of IL-5 and IL-13, cytokines known to be elevated following ILC2 activation were significantly attenuated in the CP of Rag2-/-Il2rg-/- mice. The cytokines IL-25 and IL-33 are known to activate and expand ILC2s. We observed that anti-IL-25 antibody, but not anti-IL-33 antibody administration attenuated stress-induced increases in the ILC2 population in the CP and anxiety-like behavior. Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activity plays a critical role in CNS stress circuitry modulating anxiety-like behavior. Flow cytometry analysis showed no significant effect of mifepristone, a GR antagonist administration in attenuating the stress-induced increase in the ILC2 population in the CP. However, mifepristone treatment resulted in a significant decrease in stress-induced anxiety-like phenotype in OFT and L/DT.\n\nConclusions: Our findings show that ILC2s mediate stress-induced anxiety-like behavior in mice in a GR-independent manner. We provide the first evidence on the role of ILC2 in stress-induced anxiety-like behavior. These results may help in the development of potential biomarkers and also may lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for anxiety disorders.\n\nKeywords: Group 2 Innate Lymphoid Cells, Choroid Plexus, IL-25, Anxiety-Like Phenotype, Stress\n\nDisclosure: Nothing to disclose.\n\nP24. Stepwise Implementation of Virtual Reality Mindfulness and Accelerated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Treatments for Dysphoria in Neuropsychiatric Disorders\n\nF. Andrew Kozel*, Kevin Johnson, Megan Senda, Isabelle Taylor, Mariah Jensen\n\nFlorida State University, Tallahassee, Florida, United States\n\nBackground: Dysphoria is a transdiagnostic symptom of unease or dissatisfaction experienced across a range of diagnoses including depression, anxiety, PTSD, and chronic pain. Those who experience dysphoria as a result of these conditions often have limited treatment options that, even if effective, can take weeks or months to improve symptoms. The goal of this project was to pilot a stepwise approach for quickly addressing symptoms using Virtual Reality (VR) Mindfulness followed by 2 different accelerated Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (accel-TMS) protocols as needed. The sequenced approach allows for demonstration of improvement in those that did not previously respond. We hypothesized that the sequence of VR Guided Mindfulness and accelerated TMS protocols would provide a progressive, significant improvement in dysphoria symptoms.\n\nMethods: Participants were recruited from the community. Inclusion criteria for dysphoria included minimum depressive (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) ≥10), anxiety (General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) ≥10), PTSD (Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5) ≥45), or chronic pain (Average Pain Intensity ≥4/10 for >3 months) symptoms. Participants were excluded for medical contraindications to TMS and severe psychiatric diagnoses such as psychotic, active substance use, and cognitive disorders. After meeting study criteria, participants were enrolled in Phase 1: VR Guided Mindfulness. Guided mindfulness treatments were 2x/day with a 50-minute break between treatments for 2 weeks (10 total visits). At Visits 1 and 10, clinician- and self-rated scales were obtained to assess for treatment benefit (clinician-rated were MADRS, HAM-A, CAPS-5, and PROMIS Pain Interference). Those without significant treatment benefit (at least a 30% reduction on the primary participant-rated scale); or those who did not tolerate the VR treatments well and wanted to stop prior to Visit 10 and who still met inclusion criteria were screened and offered to go to Phase 2A: left dorsolateral PFC accelerated TMS (iTBS 1,800 pulses/treatment, 110% MT, 5x/day for 5 days with 50-minute breaks between treatments). At Treatment A1 (first day of treatment) and Follow-Up A1 (one-week post treatment), clinician- and self-rated scales were obtained. Participants with a treatment benefit continued for 4 more weekly sessions over 4 weeks and were reassessed on the last day of follow-up (5 Follow-Ups total). Those without significant treatment benefit from Phase 2A on Follow-Up A1 or who still met inclusion criteria after completing all Phase 2A Follow-Ups were then offered Phase 2B: dorsomedial PFC accelerated TMS (iTBS 600 pulses/treatment and 10Hz for 1,200 pulses/treatment, 110% MT, 5x/day for 5 days with 50-minute breaks between treatments), plus 5 weekly sessions over 5 weeks. Clinician- and self-rated scales were obtained at Treatment B1, Follow-Up B1, and Follow-Up B5 to assess for treatment benefit. Paired t-tests assessed (significance p≤0.05) change in rating scales from baseline to the last day of treatment for VR or first follow up for TMS.\n\nResults: There were 27 participants enrolled in the study, 24 of which were included in the analysis. For Phase 1 (VR mindfulness), 12 participants completed the full 10 days, 11 participants discontinued before 10 days, and 1 elected to not receive VR. There were 5 participants that did not continue to Phase 2A (3 responder with improvement in dysphoria and 2 chose to not continue). There were 19 participants that were enrolled in Phase 2A, 8 of which (42%) achieved remission, and 5 of those 8 completed the study. One participant elected not to move on to Phase 2B. Thirteen participants went on to Phase 2B with 8 of 13 (62%) achieving remission. All participants completed full acute courses of Phase 2A and 2B without any major adverse events.\n\nFor those participants meeting criteria for depression, across the sample of participants, the average MADRS for Phase 1 decreased from 29 to 27 (p = 0.098, n = 20); for Phase 2A from 29 to 21 (p = 0.011, n = 19); and for Phase 2B from 22 to 15 (p = 0.010, n = 12).\n\nFor those participants meeting criteria for anxiety, across the sample of participants, the average HAM-A decreased for Phase 1 from 23 to 2 (p = 0.113, n = 20); for Phase 2A from 23 to 16 (p = 0.005, n = 19); and for Phase 2B from 17 to 10 (p = 0.025, n = 12).\n\nFor those participants meeting criteria for PTSD, across the sample of participants, the average CAPS-5 decreased for Phase 1 from 30 to 26 (p = 0.029, n = 20); for Phase 2A from 27 to 19 (p = 0.011, n = 19); and for Phase 2B from 18 to 12 (p = 0.063, n = 12).\n\nFor those participants meeting criteria for chronic pain, across the sample of participants, the average PROMIS Pain Interference decreased for Phase 1 from 13 to 12 (p = 0.604, n = 20); for Phase 2A stayed at 12 (p = 1.000, n = 19); and for Phase 2B stayed at 12 (p = 0.931, n = 12).\n\nConclusions: This sequenced neuromodulation approach demonstrates progressive improvement in rapidly reducing symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, but not chronic pain. Virtual reality treatments were well tolerated but did not provide much response possibly due to degree of samples treatment resistance. For both Phase 2A accelerated TMS and subsequent Phase 2B accelerated TMS, there was a modest degree of response, despite only one week of treatment. As this a non-randomized pilot study with a rather small sample size without long-term follow-up, future assessments of the feasibility and efficacy of this approach should be examined in randomized, larger sample sizes with long-term follow-up.\n\nKeywords: Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation, Virtual Reality, Dysphoria, Depression, PTSD\n\nDisclosure: Neuronetics: Grant (Self).

Combining Ketamine with Trauma-Focused Psychotherapy for Chronic PTSD - A Pilot Clinical Trial\n\nAdriana Feder*, Oneysha Brown, Leah Cahn, Sarah Rutter, Sara Costi, Jessica Overbey, Andrew Delgado, Saren Seeley, Philip Bonanno, Ronjon Banerjee, Rachel Fremont, Alex Yu, Ethan Bryson, Manish Jha, Rachel Yehuda, Dennis Charney, Denise Sloan, James Murrough\n\nIcahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York, United States\n\nBackground: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a leading cause of disease burden worldwide. There is a critical need for the development of novel treatment interventions for PTSD, as currently available treatments have limited efficacy. While trauma-focused psychotherapies have the highest evidence base and are considered the gold standard intervention, they are associated with significant rates of nonresponse or limited response, especially in individuals with severe chronic PTSD.\n\nGlutamate is crucial to learning and memory formation via strengthening of synaptic connections. Key mechanisms underlying chronic PTSD include “synaptic disconnection” and impaired fear extinction learning, which might underlie limited response to trauma-focused psychotherapies in many individuals. Ketamine, a noncompetitive glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist, has been found to rapidly enhance brain plasticity in the short term, and to enhance fear extinction learning. While a course of six ketamine infusions yielded rapid and robust PTSD symptom improvement in a randomized controlled trial in civilians with chronic PTSD, most ketamine responders lost this response over the following weeks (without maintenance infusions). Median time to loss of response was four weeks following the course of six infusions.\n\nThrough opening a window of increased neuroplasticity, however, a course of ketamine infusions has the potential to enhance the efficacy of trauma-focused psychotherapy via a potential synergistic effect, while also reducing the need for maintenance infusions. The current preliminary clinical trial aimed to examine the effect of combining a course of six ketamine infusions with a brief, evidence-based and highly scalable trauma-focused therapy, written exposure therapy (WET), in patients with high-moderate to severe chronic PTSD.\n\nMethods: Participants were eligible if they were between ages 18 and 70 and had a current primary diagnosis of chronic PTSD, defined as meeting DSM-5 criteria on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5 (SCID-5), of at least three months’ duration, and a score ≥30 on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5). Key exclusion criteria included psychotic or bipolar disorder, serious unstable medical illness, substance or alcohol use disorder within the prior three months, current opioid medication or long-acting benzodiazepines, and currently receiving evidence-based psychotherapy for PTSD. Concomitant psychotropic medications at stable doses for three months prior to study start were permitted. Eligible participants were assigned "
