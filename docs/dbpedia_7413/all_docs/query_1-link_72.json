        "text": "Hey, no Tommy Tutone threads? What's up with that?\n\nJust watched the movie The Last American Virgin and really liked the song over the closing credits, which it turns out is called \"Teen Angel Eyes\" and by this Tutone guy everybody knows from \"867-5309/Jenny\". The soundtrack has never been put out on CD and it looks like the only CD that carries the song is a 2008 release called \"Tommy Tutone - The Singles\". It's OOP at Amazon, there are no marketplace sellers listing it, and there are none on Ebay.\n\nSo help me out - where can I get this song? Anywhere else? Did it end up on some random 80's comp somewhere? Here's the song on Youtube, if that helps.\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uIGZ5jKKbKM\n\nGood thought, but I've never heard of the song. I see their LPs pretty often at the used bookstore that I regularly frequent, so it may be easier to open up your search to include vinyl. I still don't have a CD copy of \"Which Man Are You\", the follow-up single to \"867-5309/Jenny\".\n\nYeah, I've looked. It seems that the song was only officially issued in two places:\n\n1) The Last American Virgin soundtrack - issued on vinyl and cassette. On Ebay right now there is one promo vinyl copy that the seller is asking $40 for.\n\n2) A CD called \"Tommy Tutone - The Singles\" on the Spectra label, and there are none of these on Amazon or Ebay.\n\nMaybe I'll luck into a vinyl copy of the soundtrack sometime.\n\nReopening this thread. Pulled the 2fer from the shelf (I hadn't ripped it yet evidently) and took a listen again. Really good power pop. I only knew the singles back in the day because I was in college and money was tight (although I heard the second album quite a bit as a friend had it). Still impressed with these guys from Willits, CA (major industries crystal meth and pot) although I still think that \"Jenny\" was their best song from these albums.\n\nThe Collectables for those that didn't pick it up is still in print and sounds very much like a relatively straight forward transfer withot any weird tweaking. It's not compressed or loud to my ears. I find it intersting that sometimes these one (or in this case two hit)wonders get better transfers for CD than the bigger names."
