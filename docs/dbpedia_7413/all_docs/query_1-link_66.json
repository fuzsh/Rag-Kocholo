There was some really good stuff on their first album too.\n\nlike this one..\n\nThey'll always be known as the 867-5309 band and it's too bad. They definitely had more to offer.\n\nIt's sad that the big hit song on it gets all of the attention.\n\nThe remainder of that album is wonderful in my opinion.\n\nI particularly like \"Shadow on the Road Ahead\" and \"Bernadiah\"."
