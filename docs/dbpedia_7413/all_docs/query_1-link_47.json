In May, he shared his take on the LL Cool J track “Going Back to Cali.” He’s also released new takes on several Van Halen songs, including “Unchained,” “You Really Got Me,” “Dance The Night Away,” “Panama,” “Ain’t Talkin’ ‘Bout Love,” “Everybody Wants Some!!” “Jump” and “Atomic Punk.”\n\nReleased in November 1981, “867-5309/Jenny” was a top five hit for Tutone, with the track hitting #1 on the Mainstream Rock chart.\n\nCopyright © 2024, ABC Audio.
