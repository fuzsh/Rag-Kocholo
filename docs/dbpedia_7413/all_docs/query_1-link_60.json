        "text": "Well, I must say I am shocked. Tommy Tutone and the Knack, among others, were on the show \"Hit Me Baby One More Time\" last night. Two Teles In Tutone's band and not one posting here on TDPRI????? Appalling. (He he he) Anyway, it appeared that Tommy wielded the same Tele that he played in the video back in what 82....83?????? It even showed him carrying it to work with him in Portland to his day job as a computer programmer. (Yeah, I bet he takes it with him everyday and jams for the hot babes in the lunchroom.) It was a fun show and the bands sounded great. They, however, were no match for the invincible Rob Van Winkle aka Vanilla Ice. Ice actully put on a great performance and won the audience vote.\n\nOooh... I thought it was brutal!\n\nnasonm said:\n\nThe Knack were good, but when they did the Jet song, the singer seemed to be trying way too hard to hit those notes. Tommy's cover of Blink 182 was great.\n\nTomorrow is a new episode with Irene Cara, Cameo, Wang Chung, Night Ranger and Howard Jones.\n\nI thought they did great with their song \"Jenny Jenny\" but I thought their cover of \"All The Small Things\" was about as bad as it gets. Just my opinion. It was cool to see these bands though. I also thought the Knack butchered the Jet song, yeah those high notes were out of his range.\n\n-Eric\n\nMy take on the show:\n\nThe Knack were great, until the Jet cover, wow, weak vocals. In their defense, they PLAYED the song very well.\n\nThe Motels- Excellent at the old stuff, the warp speed Norah Jones cover sucked big time.\n\nTommy Tutone- I loved this guy. No pretense, no trying to look like he did 20 years ago, (Hair dye, excessive makeup, etc.) He just went out there like \"Hey, I'm an old balding gray haired dude, but I still like to rock out, and if you don't like it, I really don't care. I'm getting my money to be here, and my back catalog sales are gonna spike next week, so to hell with it, let's play Jenny one more time!\" I also thought it was great that he was still slinging the same tele he played in the video. What a down to earth guy. His cover of the Blink song had an interesting approach, but in the end, it sucked.\n\nVanilla Ice- Man, it pains me to say this, but he really deserved to win. He was in top form, and gave stellar performances of both Ice,Ice, Baby, and his cover choice. He simply slaughtered the competition. I don't like the guys music, but he was without question the best act on the bill that night. Ouch, that hurt to admit.\n\nAs for the other guy who competed,I forget his name, didn't recognize his hit, or his cover, and thought he was terrible all the way around.\n\nThem's my opinions, and they're worth exactly what you paid for 'em!\n\nLater,\n\nJakedog"
