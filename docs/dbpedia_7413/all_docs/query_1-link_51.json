        "text": "Last weekend I performed with Tommy Tutone live, and I‚Äôll playing with him another 10 or so times over the summer. How that came about is Rick Springfield added Tommy Tutone and Greg Kihn as extra performers on some of our shows, and Rick had in own band (including me) play with Tommy and Greg as well.\n\nIt‚Äôs always fun to play new gigs with new people, and the first show went really well. We weren‚Äôt given any charts or notes or anything to learn his songs, just MP3s of the songs to listen to and learn.\n\nThat‚Äôs why relying on sheet music is a bad idea, because often there IS no sheet music. So I learned the songs the same way I always do, and the same way most rock musicians do, which is exactly what I teach my Piano Genius Members in the members area:\n\nListen to the songs enough to be familiar with them\n\nFigure out the key of the song\n\nFigure out the basic chord progression and write out simple charts\n\nFigure out your actual parts and jot down some notes to refer back to\n\n‚Ä¶All based on just using your ear to tell whether it sounds right or not.\n\nIt works like a charm and is much easier, quicker, more effective, and most importantly can always be used. There‚Äôs not always sheet music available but your ears are always available to help you play once you‚Äôve trained them to do their job. üôÇ\n\nThis video below isn‚Äôt with me it‚Äôs just an old live performance Tommy did of his hit song 867-5309. At some point over the summer I‚Äôll get some live clips of me playing with him and add them to the site. üôÇ\n\nHere‚Äôs my main point:\n\nVirtually all of my musician friends learn songs exactly the same way that I do. If there was a better way or a quicker way or a more effective method to learn songs and to learn our parts, we‚Äôd use it, but there‚Äôs not.\n\nWhether you want to play with Tommy Tutone, or play songs on the piano at family get-togethers, or you just want to play songs for yourself in the privacy of your room , this is the best way to do it.\n\nIf you‚Äôre even the slightest bit curious, become a Piano Genius member for a month and see what you think.\n\nRelated Post: I performed as part of Greg Kihn‚Äôs band\n\nRegister now risk-free to try out a PianoGenius.com membership for yourself.\n\nI just got back from playing on an ‚Äú80‚Äôs Cruise‚Äù that had a lot of musicians/bands on it: Rick Springfield, Thomas Dolby, Berlin, Mike & The Mechanics, Billy Ocean, Lou Gramm (singer for Foreigner), Loverboy, Tommy Tutone, and more.\n\nHere‚Äôs a bit of a piano solo my wife recorded during a midnight jam session. Rick Springfield and Tommy Tutone are on stage to the left of me, and Mike Reno (singer for Loverboy) is behind me. Also on guitar is Kevin Armstrong, who plays with Iggy Pop and Thomas Dolby and previously played with David Bowie.\n\nWith these kind of impromptu things sheet music is obviously out the window (even if I was someone who reads sheet music), the best you can hop for is to hopefully recognize a song a bit so you can anticipate chord changes, and use your ear to work out chords on the fly.\n\nAnyway, here‚Äôs a snippet from the night:\n\nNote: The above video is from a Facebook post, if it‚Äôs not showing up on this page for you, it may be because you‚Äôre in ‚Äúprivate browsing‚Äù mode. Also, by default the Volume is OFF on the video, so click to turn on volume.\n\nIf you want to be able to play songs you don‚Äôt really know with musicians you‚Äôve never met before and be able to HOLD YOUR OWN on stage with them, you should try a Piano Genius piano lessons membership. You‚Äôve got nothing to lose. And a lifetime of fun and enjoyment to gain.\n\nRegister now risk-free to try out a PianoGenius.com membership for yourself."
