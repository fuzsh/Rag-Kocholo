        "text": "BeautifulChristina Aguilera\n\nChristina Aguilera did her \"Beautiful\" vocal in one take; the opening line, \"Don't look at me,\" is something she said to her friend in the studio who was there to offer support.\n\nShe BangsRicky Martin\n\nThe Ricky Martin song \"She Bangs\" found new life when William Hung performed it so horribly on a 2004 episode of American Idol that it went viral.\n\nCandle In The WindElton John\n\nMarilyn Monroe is the subject of Elton John's \"Candle In The Wind,\" but the song is really a look at how we react to celebrities who die young.\n\nAqualungJethro Tull\n\nIan Anderson wrote \"Aqualung\" after looking at pictures of homeless men that his wife took. She got a co-writing credit on the song.\n\nLike a Rolling StoneBob Dylan\n\nBob Dylan's most popular song is \"Like A Rolling Stone,\" which tells the story of a wealthy woman whose money and friends fall away. Dylan offers these mockingly encouraging words: \"When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to lose.\"\n\nThe End Of The Rock EraSong Writing\n\nThere are no more rock stars - the last one died in 1994.\n\nCharles FoxSongwriter Interviews\n\nAfter studying in Paris with a famous composition teacher, Charles became the most successful writer of TV theme songs.\n\nDeconstructing Doors Songs With The Author Of The Doors ExaminedSong Writing\n\nDoors expert Jim Cherry, author of The Doors Examined, talks about some of their defining songs and exposes some Jim Morrison myths.\n\nJules Shear - \"All Through The Night\"They're Playing My Song\n\nShears does very little promotion, which has kept him secluded from the spotlight. What changed when Cyndi Lauper had a hit with his song? Not much, really."
