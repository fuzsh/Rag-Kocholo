        "text": "How: Prior to the Penn STI program, I evaluated my students' comprehension of material through traditional tests. The questions were mostly multiple choice with some numeric and short answers questions. Several students who regularly answered questions in class would do somewhat poorly on these tests. Through my involvement with Penn and discussions with my cohort, I was exposed to alternative ways of gauging how well my students understood what was being taught. Alternative assessments are any assessment where the student creates a response to a question or a task (Reeves, 1996). There is direct observation of what students know and can do.This type of assessment can include: art work, journals, model construction, original plays, stories and performance. Constructivist learning theory contends that students cannot simply be given knowledge, that knowledge is physically constructed by learners who are involved in active learning; knowledge is symbolically constructed by learners who are making their own representations of action; knowledge is socially constructed by learners who convey their meaning making to others; and knowledge is theoretically constructed by learners who try to explain things they don't completely understand (Shepard, 2009). Alternative and authentic assessments are the evidence of this knowledge and, for many students, more meaningful.\n\nDuring the 2008-2009 school year, in lieu of a test, my chemistry students were given the opportunity to demonstrate their understanding through group presentations. Students were encouraged to steer away from power point presentations and to show their creativity. Throughout the school year I witnessed a \"Dr. Phil\" episode on battling atomic models, \"Who Wants to be a Millionaire\" game show that contained only chemistry questions, and an \"Ellen Show\" on different elements.There were countless examples that I could have shown but I chose a CD of various chemistry songs two students created. All of the presentations not only involved cooperative and differentiated learning, but also showed that students really did grasp the chemistry that was being taught.\n\nI was not familiar with the inquiry approach to lab until I entered the Penn program. My labs were primarily \"recipes\" which students were asked to follow. The students were given the expected outcomes, procedures, analysis and conclusion questions. These types of labs do not allow students to illustrate their knowledge. Inquiry based labs require students to write their own recipes and expected outcomes. These labs are authentic assessment. Authentic assessment is \"a form of assessment in which students are asked to perform real-world tasks that demonstrate meaningful application of essential knowledge and skills\" (Mueller, 2009). During Chem 506 we were given a project to create an inquiry based lab. Doug Balmer, Kate Sundeen, Barbara Doyle and I created a lab that asked students to determine which type of pipe is best to transport drinking water. The lab requires students to apply their understanding of atomic theory, chemical and periodic principles, reactivity and solubility. I incorporated the lab into my classes during the 2008-2009 school year. Though students did struggle with the process, when asked to explain what they had done, there was a marked difference in the level of explanation than what I would normally see in a short answer response on a traditional test.\n\nReferences:\n\nBaviskar, Sandhya N.; Hartle, R.
