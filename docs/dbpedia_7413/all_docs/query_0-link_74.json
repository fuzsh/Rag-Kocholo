HE San Carlo Opera com ' pany has again visited us and left many pleasant memories in its trail. There is always much to admire in its productions and in looking in retro spect certain important features stand forth prominently the work of Pe- roni, the director, for instance, whoj quietly, yet unobtrusively, guided each performance. There was no prompter's bo:;, and few people stop- ped to realize how much the entire interpretation of the opera hung upon bis baton. He is an excellent musician and really achieves remarkable r- . . ults with the material in hand, ) Elizabeth Amsden, the leading so ijrano, who made her first appearance pere witththe company this year, is a idistinct acquisition. Her voice is jbright, powerful and excellently Schooled and at her two appearances Ifn widely differing roles she was a de- fiaea success, , t the work ct Marcella Lraft on Tuesday night will not soon be for gotten. Her lovely voice, her artistic singing and clever acting in Tra viata\" will make the memory of this x production stand forth as one of the most Impressive of the season. Future appearances of this distinctly Amer ican singer.will be anticipated with ueltght. ; -- ' We liked Joseph Royer in \"Gio, conda,\" but not so well in \"The Jew' els of the Madonna.\" Ilia high tones are clear and ringing, but his low voice docs not carry, and it seemed as ( though his part in the latter opera lay very good. From year to year we re member Salazar, Agostini, Antola and other members of the cast who have made good and who return to in ' erpret different roles for our pleas ure. .

I' V TO SING FOR THE TUESDAY MORNING MUSICAL What we had said was that this oro Auction compared favorably wtih any , otner production ot this opera yet seen. Of course the production by the ' Ellis Opera company last year had , the orchestra, and 'a larger chorus, and Komer, and 'there is only one Homer. But in cpite of Kingston's wonderful voice, we liked\" Salazar much better in the part of Manrico and felt that dramatically the San Carlo gave a more even performance. We have come to expect that all Le \"ttoras must be stiff, but Luisa Darclee was less so than Marie Rappold., But 'we would hot like to say that this Operformanee compared favorably with any other production yet seen, for there remains to us distinct recollec tions of the \"Carmen\" of last year and the performances of the Boston opera at the Boyd, which weft re markable, and also the \"Traviata\" of ' the night before. : .

Kreisler issued a remarkable document,' asking that his contracts for concerts be cancelled during the period of the war. In this he sets forth that he was an officer in the Austrian army and that he fought on the Russian front until lie was wounded and honorably discharged. He said he had sent money back to Austria before the United 'States de clared war on Germany, but never for ammunitions. He sent an allowance to his old and paralyzed father, and to the support of several orphan chil dren, many of them of Russian and Serbian parentage, who were, killed during the war, and-- principally to an association organized by him and composed of all stranded and starv ing musicians In Vienna, regardless of nationality. , He' also stated that he has not sent any money back since the entrance of the United States into war with Germany and had in no way been insensible to the debt he owed America. ; ::Vs; .

He spoke of the difficulty of finding suit able children's songs, and scored the kindergartens for the poor music they use, playing several of the songs supposed to, be for children out of the kindergarten books used in Bos ton, and holding them up to ridicule on. account , of their unsuitability Mr. Siu-ette also advised that all be ginners tn music should.be started on rote singing, and from their sing in ar and the interest awakened in music through it they should later branch out and specialize in their chosen instrument.
