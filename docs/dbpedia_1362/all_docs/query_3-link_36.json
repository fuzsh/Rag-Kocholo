Percy was truly a gift that was taken away before he had the chance to blossom. They say time heals all wounds but our wounds are still bleeding. Our family has yet to receive the justice and closure we deserve.\n\nDeath is inevitable but Percy didn't just die, He was murdered. Murdered for trying to keep the peace and break up a fight that wasn't his own. He was taken away from family and friends who loved him and who needed him. A mother is without her child, children are without their father, and siblings are without their brother.\n\nPercy was art. He loved to write music and dance. He had goals that were bigger than Omaha but he never had a chance to see them through. Each day and with each breath that he took his heart would pump out a new tune. He danced like no one was watching and he would get lost in the world of his art because that was his escape. On March 30th, 2008 the music stopped. The song ended and the dream died. Percy left us. He left his mark on his community but also left the people who love him to grieve. Although he’s no longer here, his song and memory lives on forever.\n\nThere is a code in the streets that sadly people still live by. A code where people would rather protect a murderer than give a grieving family closure. There's also something called \"Linked Fate.\" Linked Fate is where you see yourself or your loved ones in the place of the victim. Well I'm asking that you all have linked fate today. Think about what you would want if it were your family or someone that you loved. Help us bring Percy justice. If anyone has any information please come forward.\n\nTerry Kelley\n\nSubmit Tip View Details\n\nReward: Up to $25,000\n\nDate: 05/19/2016 04:47 AM\n\nCase #: AH78401\n\nLocation: 5109 North 46th Street\n\nCrime Type: Homicide\n\nCrime Information:\n\nTerry Kelley was a boisterous teddy bear who cared deeply for his family and would give his last penny to a friend in need.

How much we miss the laughter and ambition that always followed. Over the years she has missed birthdays, graduations and births. It is so different from always knowing that for every family gathering Vannessa would be there. Her dedication as a faithful mother surely makes her one of a kind. Her compassion and care for her mother was unmatched along with her fearless desire to be different. Even with so many memories to reflect on, so many others were snatched away when your young tender life was removed from this present age in 2009. Life has not been the same for any that knew Vannessa. Even Kayviaun, her oldest daughter, went from being an honor roll student to struggling to stay out of trouble. The impact and effect of the murder of Vannessa K. Thomas is detrimental. However, the most detrimental thing is that no one is being held accountable according to the letter of the law. Someone please help us get justice, bring some level of comfort, deliver some quality of rest to the family and loved ones of Vannessa Kay Thomas. WE\n\nNEED JUSTICE! WE NEED YOU!
