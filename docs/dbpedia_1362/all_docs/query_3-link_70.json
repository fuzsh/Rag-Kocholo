        "text": "BUENOS AIRES – Mafalda, the beloved and wily six-year-old drawn into acclaim by celebrated Argentine artist Quino, will bring her socially-conscious hijinks to the screen. News of the adaptation, which will be ushered in by Oscar-winner Juan José Campanella, was announced Monday evening as Netflix unveiled their 2024 ‘Made in Argentina’ slate to a spirited crowd of industry and media professionals.\n\nCampanella will direct, produce and showrun the project, while Gastón Gorali co-pens and acts as general producer of the Netflix Original series and Sergio Fernández boards as production director. Netflix and Campanella and Gorali’s Mundoloco CGI, the studio behind “Metegol,” the largest Latin American animated production to date, produce.\n\n“Mafalda and her friends not only made me laugh a lot, but from time to time, they sent me to the dictionary. And each new word I learned came with the reward of a new laugh,” Campanella revealed in a July statement.\n\nAdding: “It’s our obligation to preserve the humor, timing, irony and observations of Quino. We know that we won’t be able to elevate Mafalda because she cannot be higher. But we dream that those of us who have been devoted to her since the first hour can share her with our children, and even if there are things reserved only for adults, we can all laugh out loud as a family, and why not, go to the dictionary from time to time.”\n\nHost Darío Barassi, who heads Argentina’s rendition of “Love Is Blind” alongside Wanda Nara, presented the audience with previews of the productions on the horizon. Among them were Bruno Stagnaro’s Ricardo Darín-starring graphic novel adaptation, “The Eternaut,” two Daniel Burman projects and a spin-off of “El marginal,” “En el barro,” which turns on the lives of the female prison population, a punchy and raw answer to “Orange is the New Black.”\n\nAdrián Suar-fronted “No puedo vivir sin ti,” Griselda Siciliani-led “Envidiosas” and Santiago Korovsky’s “División Palermo Season 2” also shared wry teasers-their protagonists in attendance-alongside peeks at anticipated festival-circuit buzz titles “El hombre que amaba los platos voladores,” and “Simón de la montaña.”\n\nSpeaking to the fortitude behind the ambitious “The Eternaut,” Darín remarked, “It was the work of a huge team, with a lot of grit, a lot of passion.”\n\nContinuing, “We have great expectations with this story because this version is very well thought out and designed. I believe this will make us proud. I also believe this is what could hypothetically open a window, to be able to continue dreaming of doing similar things, with similar characteristics, of similar scope. It’s a big project, very ambitious, and that makes us, of course, a little nervous.”\n\nFrancisco “Paco” Ramos, Netflix’s Lat Am VP of content, added that it was set to be “one of the most important projects for the audiovisual industry in Argentina and Latin America. The work, the precision, the ambition, the rigor, and the love and passion that everyone in this team is putting in is very inspiring.”\n\nThe event took place at the Centro Cultural San Martin, a storied arts hub situated in the downtown theater district and an ardent arm of support for regional cinema, on the heels of strict government efforts to cut state-backed funding of the country’s audiovisual sector.\n\nWith film-TV body INCAA taking major blows this year and Ventana Sur heading to Montevideo, Uruguay, after spending its formative years in Buenos Aires, Netflix hopes to coax viewers further into the country’s audiovisual offerings under its Made in Argentina banner.\n\nWhile the streamer might not be able to fully supplement the industry, the event lent hope that each project included in the line-up would further spawn interest in the region’s vast talent pool, promoting varied and unique narratives that travel effortlessly across markets.\n\n“A year and a half ago we met in this very forum and presented several projects. Today, all of them have become a reality. Some have already been launched, such as ‘Descansar en Paz’ or ‘Goyo,’” Ramos noted.\n\n“Today, we have some 20 projects underway, among series, documentaries, films and a script presented by our host tonight. So I want to make it clear that we’re still betting on Argentina, and we’re not going to stop,” he concluded.\n\nFurther info on the upcoming titles:\n\nSeries\n\n“Ángel Di María: Romper la pared” (Dir: Juan Baldana, Prod: PEGSA)\n\nThis three-part documentary series takes an intimate dive into the life and career of Argentine soccer great Ángel di Maria, from his humble upbringing through to the championships that solidified his legacy.
