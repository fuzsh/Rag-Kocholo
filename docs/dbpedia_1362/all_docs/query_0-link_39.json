        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe age of fathers at childbirth is rising, with an increasing number of births attributed to older fathers. While the impact of advanced paternal age has been documented, sociodemographic data about fathers aged 50 years and older remain scarce.To explore sociodemographic and temporal trends among the oldest US fathers (age ≥50 years) and their associations with perinatal outcomes.This retrospective cross-sectional study included data from all US births from 2011 to 2022 using the National Vital Statistics System. Data were analyzed from August 2023 and May 2024.Reported paternal age at childbirth.Outcomes of interest were sociodemographic factors, temporal trends in older fatherhood, and perinatal outcomes, including preterm birth, low birth weight, gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension, assisted reproductive technology (ART), rates of maternal primiparity, and the infant sex ratio.From 2011 to 2022, the US recorded 46 195 453 births, with an overall mean (SD) paternal age of 31.5 (6.8) years and 484 507 (1.1%) involving fathers aged 50 years or older, 47 785 (0.1%) aged 60 years or older, and 3777 (0.008%) aged 70 years or older. Births to fathers aged 50 years or older increased from 1.1% in 2011 to 1.3% in 2022 (P for trend < .001). Fathers aged 50 years or older were more diverse, with variations in educational achievement and race and ethnicity. Marital status and maternal racial and ethnic and educational backgrounds also varied by paternal age and race. Despite controlling for maternal age and other sociodemographic and perinatal factors, every 10-year increase in paternal age was consistently associated with greater use of ART (eg, age 50-59 years: adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.23; 95% CI, 2.19-2.27), higher likelihood of first maternal birth (eg, age 50-59 years: aOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.15-1.17), and increased risks of preterm birth (eg, age 50-59 years: aOR, 1.16; 95% CI, 1.15-1.18) and low birth weight (eg, age 50-59 years: aOR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.13-1.15) compared with fathers aged 30 to 39 years. No significant changes in the infant sex ratio were observed, except among fathers aged 70 years or older (aOR, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.86-0.99) and 75 years or older (aOR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.73-0.97), who showed a decreased likelihood of having male offspring.In this cross-sectional study of all US births from 2011 to 2022, the percentage attributed to older fathers, while small, increased. Notable variations in paternal and maternal race and education were identified. Older fatherhood was associated with increased ART use, first-time maternal births, adverse perinatal outcomes, and altered sex ratio. Further research of this population is crucial for improving patient counseling and family planning.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.25269\n\nView details for PubMedID 39088214\n\nAbstract\n\nThe use of dating applications for matchmaking and sexual exploits (\"hookups\") has increased, and this modern phenomenon has supplanted traditional socialization and relationship formation. To date, sociodemographic data on the use of dating apps has been limited.In this study, we sought to identify predictors associated with the use of dating apps in the United States.Using cross-sectional data from the 2017-2019 National Survey of Family Growth, we examined sociodemographic determinants influencing the use of dating apps to find partners for sexual intercourse. We constructed survey-weighted regression models to study these associations, with additional sensitivity analyses performed within specific subgroups. Furthermore, this study investigated the correlation of app use with sexual frequency.Study outcomes were participant data regarding reported use of dating apps for sexual intercourse in the 2017-2019 National Survey of Family Growth.A total of 11,225 respondents were examined, representing a survey-weighted total of approximately 143,201, 286 Americans. Among them, 757 respondents (6.7%), equating to approximately 8, 818, 743 individuals, reported dating app use for sexual hookups. Regression analysis revealed that factors such as male sex, White race, previous sexual experience, substance/alcohol use, history of sexually transmitted infections, same-sex attraction, and bisexuality increased the likelihood of dating app usage. Conversely, reduced odds of dating app use were observed among Catholics, Protestants, married/widowed individuals, and older respondents. Stratified analyses across various demographics, including male and female individuals aged 20 to 40 years, heterosexual, and lesbian, gay, and bisexual respondents, generally supported these trends. Notably, dating app use did not correlate with increased sexual frequency (adjusted incidence rate ratio: 1.10; 95% CI: 0.96-1.26; P = .16).Dating app use is prevalent among male patients and White individuals and correlates with increased sexually transmitted infection risk, alcohol/illicit substance use, past sexual experience, and popularity within the lesbian, gay, and bisexual community, all important considerations for public health interventions. Dating app use, however, was not associated with increased sexual encounters.Strengths of our study were the utilization of a national survey of individuals of reproductive age in the United States and focus on a clearly defined outcome of dating app utilization for the purposes of sexual intercourse. Limitations include self-reported survey responses and insufficient detail on the types and duration of dating app platforms and their use.Many sociodemographic factors, including male sex, White race, history of STIs, substance and alcohol use, and same-sex and bisexual attraction, were linked with dating app use. However, there was no increase in sexual frequency associated with dating app utilization. Further research is essential for integrating these technologies into the relational and sexual dynamics of individuals.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/jsxmed/qdae083\n\nView details for PubMedID 39081080\n\nAbstract\n\nThe widespread interest in male reproductive health (MRH), fueled by emerging evidence, such as the global decline in sperm counts, has intensified concerns about the status of MRH. Consequently, there is a pressing requirement for a strategic, systematic approach to identifying critical questions, collecting pertinent information, and utilizing these data to develop evidence-based strategies. The methods for addressing these questions and the pathways toward their answers will inevitably vary based on the variations in cultural, geopolitical, and health-related contexts. To address these issues, a conjoint ESHRE and Male Reproductive Health Initiative (MRHI) Campus workshop was convened.The three objectives were: first, to assess the current state of MRH around the world; second, to identify some of the key gaps in knowledge; and, third, to examine how MRH stakeholders can collaboratively generate intelligent and effective paths forward.Each expert reviewed and summarized the current literature that was subsequently used to provide a comprehensive overview of challenges related to MRH.This narrative report is an overview of the data, opinions, and arguments presented during the workshop. A number of outcomes are presented and can be summarized by the following overarching themes: MRH is a serious global issue and there is a plethora of gaps in our understanding; there is a need for widespread international collaborative networks to undertake multidisciplinary research into fundamental issues, such as lifestyle/environmental exposure studies, and high-quality clinical trials; and there is an urgent requirement for effective strategies to educate young people and the general public to safeguard and improve MRH across diverse population demographics and resources.This was a workshop where worldwide leading experts from a wide range of disciplines presented and discussed the evidence regarding challenges related to MRH. While each expert summarized the current literature and placed it in context, the data in a number of areas are limited and/or sparse. Equally, important areas for consideration may have been missed. Moreover, there are clear gaps in our knowledge base, which makes some conclusions necessarily speculative and warranting of further study.Poor MRH is a global issue that suffers from low awareness among the public, patients, and heathcare professionals. Addressing this will require a coordinated multidisciplinary approach. Addressing the significant number of knowledge gaps will require policy makers prioritizing MRH and its funding.The authors would like to extend their gratitude to ESHRE for providing financial support for the Budapest Campus Workshop, as well as to Microptic S.L.

Moreover, no study has evaluated the role of preconception vaccination in both male and female partners.An Internet-based, prospective preconception cohort study of couples residing in the USA and Canada. We analyzed data from 1815 female participants who conceived during December 2020-November 2022, including 1570 couples with data on male partner vaccination.Eligible female participants were aged 21-45 years and were trying to conceive without use of fertility treatment at enrollment. Female participants completed questionnaires at baseline, every 8 weeks until pregnancy, and during early and late pregnancy; they could also invite their male partners to complete a baseline questionnaire. We collected data on COVID-19 vaccination (brand and date of doses), history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (yes/no and date of positive test), potential confounders (demographic, reproductive, and lifestyle characteristics), and pregnancy status on all questionnaires. Vaccination status was categorized as never (0 doses before conception), ever (≥1 dose before conception), having a full primary sequence before conception, and completing the full primary sequence ≤3 months before conception. These categories were not mutually exclusive. Participants were followed up from their first positive pregnancy test until miscarriage or a censoring event (induced abortion, ectopic pregnancy, loss to follow-up, 20 weeks' gestation), whichever occurred first. We estimated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) for miscarriage and corresponding 95% CIs using Cox proportional hazards models with GW as the time scale. We used propensity score fine stratification weights to adjust for confounding.Among 1815 eligible female participants, 75% had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by the time of conception. Almost one-quarter of pregnancies resulted in miscarriage, and 75% of miscarriages occurred <8 weeks' gestation. The propensity score-weighted IRR comparing female participants who received at least one dose any time before conception versus those who had not been vaccinated was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.63, 1.14). COVID-19 vaccination was not associated with increased risk of either early miscarriage (GW: <8) or late miscarriage (GW: 8-19). There was no indication of an increased risk of miscarriage associated with male partner vaccination (IRR = 0.90; 95% CI: 0.56, 1.44).The present study relied on self-reported vaccination status and infection history. Thus, there may be some non-differential misclassification of exposure status. While misclassification of miscarriage is also possible, the preconception cohort design and high prevalence of home pregnancy testing in this cohort reduced the potential for under-ascertainment of miscarriage. As in all observational studies, residual or unmeasured confounding is possible.This is the first study to evaluate prospectively the relation between preconception COVID-19 vaccination in both partners and miscarriage, with more complete ascertainment of early miscarriages than earlier studies of vaccination. The findings are informative for individuals planning a pregnancy and their healthcare providers.This work was supported by the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, the National Institute of Health [R01-HD086742 (PI: L.A.W.); R01-HD105863S1 (PI: L.A.W. and M.L.E.)], the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (R03-AI154544; PI: A.K.R.), and the National Science Foundation (NSF-1914792; PI: L.A.W.).

To estimate overall events risk, Cox proportional hazard models were applied to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) for erectile dysfunction (ED) diagnosis and the different treatments, adjusting for region, median age, obesity, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking, hypertension, coronary artery disease, and sleep apnea. Additionally, the same analyses were performed to calculate the HRs for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) diagnosis and the different treatments.HRs for SRD, RVO, and ION.In total, 1 938 262 men with an ED diagnosis were observed during the study period. Among them, 615 838 (31.8%) were treated with PDE5is. In total, 2 175 439 men with a BPH diagnosis were observed during the study period. Among them, 175 725 (8.1%) were treated with PDE5is. On adjusted Cox regression analysis, PDE5i use was not associated with SRD, RVO, ION, and any ocular event when compared with ED diagnosis and other ED treatments. Importantly, as the intensity of ED treatment increased, so did the risk of ocular events. In addition, PDE5i use was not associated with SRD and ION when compared with BPH diagnosis and other BPH treatments. In contrast, in patients with BPH, PDE5i use was associated with RVO (HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 1.06-1.23). Importantly, patients with BPH receiving other medical treatment (ie, 5a reductase/alpha blocker; HR, 1.11; 95% CI, 1.06-1.16) or surgical treatment (HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.02-1.19) had a higher risk of RVO.We did not observe any consistent association between PDE5i use and any ocular adverse events (SRD, RVO, and ION).Because we did not have access to the patients' medical records, we recorded outcome definitions using ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding.Patients using PDE5is for ED or BPH indications did not have an increased risk of ocular events, even when compared with other treatments for ED or BPH.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/jsxmed/qdad137\n\nView details for PubMedID 37861186\n\nAbstract\n\nSleep quality and duration have been investigated for their association with health. Insomnia affects up to one-third of adults and may impact male erectile function. In addition, medical treatments for insomnia (many of which are sedatives) may also affect erectile quality.To investigate the association of erectile dysfunction (ED) in patients diagnosed with and treated for insomnia.We utilized the IBM MarketScan (2007-2016) Commercial and Medicare Supplemental Databases (v 2.0). Age- and enrollment-matched controls were selected among patients without insomnia diagnosis or treatment.Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate the risk of incident ED (ie, diagnosis alone, or diagnosis and treatment with phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors [PDE5i], intracavernous injection (ICI)/urethral suppositories, and penile prosthesis) after the diagnosis or treatment of insomnia while adjusting for relevant comorbidities.In total, 539 109 men with an insomnia diagnosis were identified. Of these men, 356 575 were also medically treated for insomnia. The mean (±standard deviation) follow-up times for patients diagnosed with insomnia and those diagnosed with and treated for insomnia were 2.8 ± 1.6 and 3.1 ± 1.8 yr, respectively. Men with insomnia were more commonly smokers and had a higher number of office visits and comorbidities than controls (p < 0.001). On an adjusted analysis, both untreated and treated insomnia were associated with increased risks of ED diagnosis (hazard ratio or HR [95% confidence interval {CI}]: 1.58 [1.54-1.62] and 1.66 [1.64-1.69], respectively; p < 0.001). Similarly, men with treated insomnia had a higher risk of having ED treated with PDE5i (HR [95% CI]: 1.52 [1.49-1.55]; p < 0.001) and ICI (HR [95% CI]: 1.32 [1.14-1.54]; p < 0.001) when compared with controls. A limitation of this study was that a lack of granularity regarding patient clinical characteristics (eg, severity of disease, laboratory data, etc.) is inherent to insurance claims data. In addition, the follow-up was limited and may affect associations at longer time points.In the current report, a consistent association between insomnia and ED diagnosis was identified. Men diagnosed with insomnia only were found to have a higher risk of developing ED. Moreover, men with pharmacological insomnia treatments were more often prescribed treatments for ED. Given the prevalence of insomnia, future studies are warranted to delineate the association of insomnia and its treatment with erectile function.Insomnia affects up to one-third of adults and impact male erectile function. Men only diagnosed with insomnia were found to have a higher risk of developing erectile dysfunction (ED). Moreover, men with pharmacological insomnia treatments were more often prescribed treatments for ED.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.euf.2023.08.005\n\nView details for PubMedID 37690918\n\nAbstract\n\nBackground: Delayed ejaculation (DE) is a disorder that can cause significant distress for sexually active men. The etiology of DE is largely idiopathic, with even less being known about clinical factors associated with the condition.Aim: We sought to use data mining techniques to examine a broad group of health conditions and pharmaceutical treatments to identify factors associated with DE.Methods: Using an insurance claims database, we evaluated all men with a diagnosis of DE and matched them to a cohort (1:1) of men with other male sexual disorders of urologic origin (ie, erectile dysfunction [ED] and Peyronie's disease [PD]). Given the low prevalence of DE, we incorporated the random forest approach for classification of DE vs controls, with a plethora of predictors and cross-validation with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We used both a high-performance generalized linear model and a multivariate logistic model. The area under the curve was reported to demonstrate classifier performance, and odds ratios were used to indicate risks of each predictor. We also evaluated for differences in the prevalence of conditions in DE by race/ethnicity.Outcomes: Clinical factors (ie, diagnoses and medications) associated with DE were identified.Results: In total, 11602 men with DE were matched to a cohort of men with PD and ED. We focused on the 20 factors with the strongest association with DE across all models. The factors demonstrating positive associations with DE compared to other disorders of male sexual dysfunction (ie, ED and PD) included male infertility, testicular dysfunction, anxiety, disorders of lipid metabolism, alpha adrenergic blocker use, anemia, antidepressant use, and psychoses such as schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. In addition, the prevalence of several conditions varied by race/ethnicity. For example, male infertility was present in 5% of Asian men compared to <2% of men of other races.Clinical Implications: Several medical conditions and pharmacologic treatments are associated with DE, findings that may provide insight into the etiology of DE and offer treatment options.Strengths and Limitations: This study is to our knowledge the first to use using data mining techniques to investigate the association between medical conditions/pharmacologic agents and the development of subsequent DE. The generalizability of our findings is limited given that all men were commercially insured.Conclusion: DE is associated with multiple medical conditions, a finding that may help identify the etiology for this disorder.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/sexmed/qfad040\n\nView details for PubMedID 37547871\n\nAbstract\n\nTo what extent is male fatty acid intake associated with fecundability among couples planning pregnancy?We observed weak positive associations of male dietary intakes of total and saturated fatty acids with fecundability; no other fatty acid subtypes were appreciably associated with fecundability.Male fatty acid intake has been associated with semen quality in previous studies. However, little is known about the extent to which male fatty acid intake is associated with fecundability among couples attempting spontaneous conception.We conducted an internet-based preconception prospective cohort study of 697 couples who enrolled during 2015-2022. During 12 cycles of observation, 53 couples (7.6%) were lost to follow-up.Participants were residents of the USA or Canada, aged 21-45 years, and not using fertility treatment at enrollment. At baseline, male participants completed a food frequency questionnaire from which we estimated intakes of total fat and fatty acid subtypes. We ascertained time to pregnancy using questionnaires completed every 8 weeks by female participants until conception or up to 12 months. We used proportional probabilities regression models to estimate fecundability ratios (FRs) and 95% CIs for the associations of fat intakes with fecundability, adjusting for male and female partner characteristics. We used the multivariate nutrient density method to account for energy intake, allowing for interpretation of results as fat intake replacing carbohydrate intake. We conducted several sensitivity analyses to assess the potential for confounding, selection bias, and reverse causation.Among 697 couples, we observed 465 pregnancies during 2970 menstrual cycles of follow-up. The cumulative incidence of pregnancy during 12 cycles of follow-up after accounting for censoring was 76%. Intakes of total and saturated fatty acids were weakly, positively associated with fecundability. Fully adjusted FRs for quartiles of total fat intake were 1.32 (95% CI 1.01-1.71), 1.16 (95% CI 0.88-1.51), and 1.43 (95% CI 1.09-1.88) for the second, third, and fourth vs the first quartile, respectively. Fully adjusted FRs for saturated fatty acid intake were 1.21 (95% CI 0.94-1.55), 1.16 (95% CI 0.89-1.51), and 1.23 (95% CI 0.94-1.62) for the second, third, and fourth vs the first quartile, respectively. Intakes of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, trans-, omega-3, and omega-6 fatty acids were not strongly associated with fecundability. Results were similar after adjustment for the female partner's intakes of trans- and omega-3 fats.Dietary intakes estimated from the food frequency questionnaire may be subject to non-differential misclassification, which is expected to bias results toward the null in the extreme categories when exposures are modeled as quartiles. There may be residual confounding by unmeasured dietary, lifestyle, or environmental factors. Sample size was limited, especially in subgroup analyses.Our results do not support a strong causal effect of male fatty acid intakes on fecundability among couples attempting to conceive spontaneously. The weak positive associations we observed between male dietary fat intakes and fecundability may reflect a combination of causal associations, measurement error, chance, and residual confounding.The study was funded by the National Institutes of Health, grant numbers R01HD086742 and R01HD105863.

Prior studies have indicated that infertility and ART are associated with an increased risk of birth defects or cancer but have been limited by small sample size and inadequate statistical power, failure to adjust for or include plurality, differences in definitions and/or methods of ascertainment, lack of information on ART treatment parameters or study periods spanning decades resulting in a substantial historical bias as ART techniques have improved.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a population-based cohort study linking ART cycles reported to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome Reporting System (SART CORS) from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2017 that resulted in live births in 2004-2018 in Massachusetts and North Carolina and live births in 2004-2017 in Texas and New York. A 10:1 sample of non-ART births were chosen within the same time period as the ART birth. Non-ART siblings were identified through the ART mother's information. Children from non-ART births were classified as being born to women who conceived with ovulation induction or IUI (OI/IUI) when there was an indication of infertility treatment on the birth certificate, and the woman did not link to the SART CORS; all others were classified as being naturally conceived.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study population included 165 125 ART children, 31 524 non-ART siblings, 12 451 children born to OI/IUI-treated women and 1 353 440 naturally conceived children. All study children were linked to their respective State birth defect registries to identify major defects diagnosed within the first year of life. We classified children with major defects as either chromosomal (i.e. presence of a chromosomal defect with or without any other major defect) or nonchromosomal (i.e. presence of a major defect but having no chromosomal defect), or all major defects (chromosomal and nonchromosomal), and calculated rates per 1000 children. Logistic regression models were used to generate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% CIs of the risk of birth defects by conception group (OI/IUI, non-ART sibling and ART by oocyte source and embryo state) with naturally conceived children as the reference, adjusted for paternal and maternal ages; maternal race and ethnicity, education, BMI, parity, diabetes, hypertension; and for plurality, infant sex and State and year of birth. All study children were also linked to their respective State cancer registries. Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs of cancer by birth defect status (including presence of a defect, type and number of defects), and conception group.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 29 571 singleton children (2.0%) and 3753 twin children (3.5%) had a major birth defect (chromosomal or nonchromosomal). Children conceived with ART from autologous oocytes had increased risks for nonchromosomal defects, including blastogenesis, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal and, for males only, genitourinary defects, with AORs ranging from 1.22 to 1.85; children in the autologous-fresh group also had increased risks for musculoskeletal (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.13, 1.45) and orofacial defects (AOR 1.40, 95% CI 1.17, 1.68). Within the donor oocyte group, the children conceived from fresh embryos did not have increased risks in any birth defect category, whereas children conceived from thawed embryos had increased risks for nonchromosomal defects (AOR 1.20, 95% CI 1.03, 1.40) and blastogenesis defects (AOR 1.74, 95% CI 1.14, 2.65). The risk of cancer was increased among ART children in the autologous-fresh group (HR 1.31, 95% CI 1.08, 1.59) and non-ART siblings (1.34, 95% CI 1.02, 1.76). The risk of leukemia was increased among children in the OI/IUI group (HR 2.15, 95% CI 1.04, 4.47) and non-ART siblings (HR 1.63, 95% CI 1.02, 2.61). The risk of central nervous system tumors was increased among ART children in the autologous-fresh group (HR 1.68, 95% CI 1.14, 2.48), donor-fresh group (HR 2.57, 95% CI 1.04, 6.32) and non-ART siblings (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.12, 3.03). ART children in the autologous-fresh group were also at increased risk for solid tumors (HR 1.39, 95% CI 1.09, 1.77). A total of 127 children had both major birth defects and cancer, of which 53 children (42%) had leukemia. The risk of cancer had two independent components: (i) method of conception (described above) and (ii) presence, type and number of birth defects. The presence of nonchromosomal defects increased the cancer risk, greater for two or more defects versus one defect, for all cancers and each type evaluated. The presence of chromosomal defects was strongly associated with cancer risk (HR 8.70 for all cancers and HR 21.90 for leukemia), further elevated in the presence of both chromosomal and nonchromosomal defects (HR 21.29 for all cancers, HR 64.83 for leukemia and HR 4.71 for embryonal tumors). Among the 83 946 children born from ART in the USA in 2019 compared to their naturally conceived counterparts, these risks translate into an estimated excess of 761 children with major birth defects, 31 children with cancer and 11 children with both major birth defects and cancer.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: In the SART CORS database, it was not possible to differentiate method of embryo freezing (slow freezing versus vitrification), and data on ICSI were only available in the fresh embryo ART group. In the OI/IUI group, it was not possible to differentiate type of non-ART treatment utilized, and in both the ART and OI/IUI groups, data were unavailable on duration of infertility. Since OI/IUI is underreported on the birth certificate, some OI/IUI children were likely included among the naturally conceived children, which will decrease the difference between all the groups and the naturally conceived children.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The use of ART is associated with increased risks of major nonchromosomal birth defects. The presence of birth defects is associated with greater risks for cancer, which adds to the baseline risk in the ART group. Although this study does not show causality, these findings indicate that children conceived with ART, non-ART siblings, and all children with birth defects should be monitored more closely for the subsequent development of cancer.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This project was supported by grant R01 HD084377 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Data on SFs in specific clinical patient groups, including reproductive failure, are currently limited.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The study group was a retrospective cohort of patients with NOA recruited in 10 clinics across six countries and formed in the framework of the international GEMINI (The GEnetics of Male INfertility Initiative) study.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: ES data of 836 patients with NOA were exploited to analyze SFs in 85 genes recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG), Geisinger's MyCode, and Clinical Genome Resource. The identified 6374 exonic variants were annotated with ANNOVAR and filtered for allele frequency, retaining 1381 rare or novel missense and loss-of-function variants. After automatic assessment of pathogenicity with ClinVar and InterVar, 87 variants were manually curated. The final list of confident disease-causing SFs was communicated to the corresponding GEMINI centers. When patient consent had been given, available family health history and non-andrological medical data were retrospectively assessed.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We found a 3.6% total frequency of SFs, 3.3% from the 59 ACMG SF v2.0 genes. One in 70 patients carried SFs in genes linked to familial cancer syndromes, whereas 1 in 60 cases was predisposed to congenital heart disease or other cardiovascular conditions. Retrospective assessment confirmed clinico-molecular diagnoses in several cases. Notably, 37% (11/30) of patients with SFs carried variants in genes linked to male infertility in mice, suggesting that some SFs may have a co-contributing role in spermatogenic impairment. Further studies are needed to determine whether these observations represent chance findings or the profile of SFs in NOA patients is indeed different from the general population.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: One limitation of our cohort was the low proportion of non-Caucasian ethnicities (9%). Additionally, as comprehensive clinical data were not available retrospectively for all men with SFs, we were not able to confirm a clinico-molecular diagnosis and assess the penetrance of the specific variants.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: For the first time, this study analyzed medically actionable SFs in men with spermatogenic failure. With the evolving process to incorporate ES into routine andrology practice for molecular diagnostic purposes, additional assessment of SFs can inform about future significant health concerns for infertility patients. Timely detection of SFs and respective genetic counseling will broaden options for disease prevention and early treatment, as well as inform choices and opportunities regarding family planning. A notable fraction of SFs was detected in genes implicated in maintaining genome integrity, essential in both mitosis and meiosis. Thus, potential genetic pleiotropy may exist between certain adult-onset monogenic diseases and NOA.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This work was supported by the Estonian Research Council grants IUT34-12 and PRG1021 (M.L. and M.P.); National Institutes of Health of the United States of America grant R01HD078641 (D.F.C., K.I.A. and P.N.S.); National Institutes of Health of the United States of America grant P50HD096723 (D.F.C. and P.N.S.); National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia grant APP1120356 (M.K.O'B., D.F.C. and K.I.A.); Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia (FCT)/Ministerio da Ciencia, Tecnologia e Inovacao grant POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007274 (A.M.L., F.C. and J.G.) and FCT: IF/01262/2014 (A.M.L.).

Evidence from randomized trials can be difficult to interpret and of limited ability to inform clinical practice for numerous reasons. These may include complex issues, such as variation in outcome measures and outcome reporting bias, as well as failure to consider the perspectives of men and their partners with lived experience of fertility problems. Previously, the Core Outcome Measure for Infertility Trials (COMMIT) initiative, an international consortium of researchers, healthcare professionals and people with fertility problems, has developed a core outcome set for general infertility research. Now, a bespoke core outcome set for male infertility is required to address the unique challenges pertinent to male infertility research.STUDY DESIGN SIZE DURATION: Stakeholders, including healthcare professionals, allied healthcare professionals, scientists, researchers and people with fertility problems, will be invited to participate. Formal consensus science methods will be used, including the modified Delphi method, modified Nominal Group Technique and the National Institutes of Health's consensus development conference.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS SETTING METHODS: An international steering group, including the relevant stakeholders outlined above, has been established to guide the development of this core outcome set. Possible core outcomes will be identified by undertaking a systematic review of randomized controlled trials evaluating potential treatments for male factor infertility. These outcomes will be entered into a modified Delphi method. Repeated reflection and re-scoring should promote convergence towards consensus outcomes, which will be prioritized during a consensus development meeting to identify a final core outcome set. We will establish standardized definitions and recommend high-quality measurement instruments for individual core outcomes.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS: This work has been supported by the Urology Foundation small project award, 2021.

Although these trends have been attributed to changing reproductive intentions, it is unclear whether declining fecundity (the biologic ability to reproduce measured by TTP in the current report) may also play a role. Indeed, trends based on declining sperm quality and higher utilisation of infertility treatment suggest fecundity may be falling.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This cross-sectional survey data from the National Survey of Family Growth was administered from 2002 to 2017. The surveys are based on nationally representative samples of reproductive-aged women in the USA. Interviews were conducted in person or through computer-assisted self-administration of sensitive questions.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study included women who self-reported time spent trying to become pregnant allowing utilisation of the current duration approach to estimate the total duration of pregnancy attempt (i.e. TTP). In all, 1202 participants were analysed over each study period. To estimate a TTP distribution overall and by parity, we used a piecewise constant proportional hazards model that accounts for digit preference. Accelerated-failure-time regression models, which were weighted to account for the sampling design, were used to estimate time ratios (TRs). Models were adjusted for age, BMI, race, education, relationship status, parity, pelvic inflammatory disease treatment and any reproductive problems.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Of the participants analysed, the average age was 31.8 and BMI was 28.6, which was similar across the survey periods. Relationship status was the only demographic characteristic that changed over time. All other variables remained constant across the study periods. Overall, TRs comparing TTP between 2002 and 2017 increased slightly (TR: 1.02, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.04). When stratified by parity, parous women had a longer TTP over the later years of the study (TR: 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.06). TTP remained constant for nulliparous women. Similarly, TTP also increased over time for women over age thirty (TR: 1.02, 1.00, 1.05) but not for women under age thirty.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Small changes in data collection over time may have impacted the findings. We accounted for this in sensitivity analyses using imputed data. Overall, TRs were slightly attenuated using the imputed data, but represented similar patterns to the original data. Results for parous women and women over 30 remained consistent in the sensitivity analyses.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Consistent with reports of falling fertility rates and sperm counts, this study suggests parous and older couples in the USA may be taking longer to become pregnant. Although trends were suggestive of a small overall increase in TTP, particularly for parous women and women over age thirty, additional data are needed to attempt to understand these trends given the societal, economic and public health implications related to fecundity.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): Funding was provided by National Institutes of Health grant R03HD097287 to A.C.M.

Infants were linked to paired mothers and fathers using family ID. Preconception paternal health was assessed using the number of metabolic syndrome (MetS) components and the most common individual chronic disease diagnoses (hypertension, diabetes mellitus, obesity, hyperlipidemia, COPD, cancer, and depression). Women with MetS components were excluded to avoid potential confounding of maternal and paternal factors. Adverse maternal outcomes assessed included: 1) abnormal placentation including placenta accreta spectrum, placenta previa and placental abruption 2) pre-eclampsia with and without severe features including eclampsia, and 3) severe maternal morbidity (SMM), identified as any indicator from the CDC Index of life-threatening complications at the time of delivery through 6 weeks postpartum. The trend between preconception paternal health and each maternal outcome was determined using the Cochran-Armitage Trend test. The independent association of paternal health and maternal outcomes was also determined using generalized estimating equations (GEE) models accounting for some mothers contributing multiple births and adjusting for maternal age, paternal age, region of birth, year of birth, maternal smoking, and average number of outpatient visits per year.RESULTS: Among 669,256 births to healthy mothers, there was a significant trend of all adverse maternal outcomes with worsening preconception paternal health defined either as number of MetS components or number of chronic diseases (p<0.001, Cochran-Armitage Trend test). In the GEE model, the odds of pre-eclampsia without severe features increased in a dose-dependent fashion and were 21% higher (95% CI 1.17-1.26) among women whose partners had ≥2 MetS than for women whose partners had 0 MetS. The odds of pre-eclampsia with severe features and eclampsia increased in a dose-dependent fashion and were 19% higher (95% CI 1.09-1.30) for women whose partners had ≥2 MetS than for women whose partners had 0 MetS. The odds of SMM were 9% higher (95% CI 1.002-1.19) for women whose partners had ≥2 MetS components than for women whose partners had 0 MetS. The odds of abnormal placentation was similar between groups (aOR 0.96, 95% CI 0.89-1.03).CONCLUSIONS: Among healthy mothers, we report preconception paternal health is significantly associated with increased odds of pre-eclampsia with and without severe features and weakly associated with odds of SMM. These findings suggest that paternally derived factors may play significant roles in the development of adverse maternal outcomes in healthy women with a low a priori risk of obstetric complications.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajogmf.2021.100384\n\nView details for PubMedID 33895399\n\nAbstract\n\nMale-specific late effects after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) include genital chronic graft-versus-host disease (GvHD), hypogonadism, sexual dysfunction, infertility, and subsequent malignancies, such as prostate, penile, and testicular cancer. They may be closely intertwined and cause prolonged morbidity and decreased quality of life after HCT.Here, we provide a systematic review of male-specific late effects in a collaboration between transplant physicians, endocrinologists, urologists, dermatologists, and sexual health professionals through the Late Effects and Quality of Life Working Committee of the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, and the Transplant Complications Working Party of the European Society of Blood and Marrow Transplantation.We utilized systematic review methodology to summarize incidence, risk factors, screening, prevention and treatment of these complications and provide consensus evidence-based recommendations for clinical practice and future research.Most of the evidence regarding male GvHD is still based on limited data, precluding strong therapeutic recommendations. We therefore recommend to systematically screen for male genital GvHD regularly and report it to large registries to allow for a better understanding. Future research should also address treatment since little published evidence is available to date. Male-specific endocrine consequences of HCT include hypogonadism which may also affect bone health. Since the evidence is scarce, current recommendations for hormone substitution and/or bone health treatment are based on similar principles as for the general population. Following HCT, sexual health decreases and this topic should be addressed at regular intervals. Future studies should focus on interventional strategies to address sexual dysfunction. Infertility remains prevalent in patients having undergone myeloablative conditioning, which warrants offering sperm preservation in all HCT candidates. Most studies on fertility rely on descriptive registry analysis and surveys, hence the importance of reporting post-HCT conception data to large registries. Although the quality of evidence is low, the development of cancer in male genital organs does not seem more prevalent than in the general population; however, subsequent malignancies in general seem to be more prevalent in males than females, and special attention should be given to skin and oral mucosa.Male-specific late effects, probably more under-reported than female-specific complications, should be systematically considered during the regular follow-up visits of male survivors who have undergone HCT. Care of patients with male-specific late effects warrants close collaboration between transplant physicians and specialists from other involved disciplines. Future research should be directed towards better data collection on male-specific late effects and on studies about the interrelationship between these late effects, to allow the development of evidence based effective management practices.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.jtct.2021.10.013\n\nView details for PubMedID 34757220\n\nAbstract\n\nSTUDY QUESTION: What is the association between ART conception and treatment parameters and the risk of birth defects?SUMMARY ANSWER: Compared to naturally conceived singleton infants, the risk of a major nonchromosomal defect among ART singletons conceived with autologous oocytes and fresh embryos without use of ICSI was increased by 18%, with increases of 42% and 30% for use of ICSI with and without male factor diagnosis, respectively.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Prior studies have indicated that infertility and ART are associated with an increased risk of birth defects but have been limited by small sample size and inadequate statistical power, failure to differentiate results by plurality, differences in birth defect definitions and methods of ascertainment, lack of information on ART treatment parameters or study periods spanning decades resulting in a substantial historical bias as ART techniques have improved.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This was a population-based cohort study linking ART cycles reported to the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology Clinic Outcome Reporting System (SART CORS) from 1 January 2004 to 31 December 2015 that resulted in live births from 1 September 2004 to 31 December 2016 in Massachusetts and North Carolina and from 1 September 2004 to 31 December 2015 for Texas and New York: these were large and ethnically diverse States, with birth defect registries utilizing the same case definitions and data collected, and with high numbers of ART births annually. A 10:1 sample of non-ART births were chosen within the same time period as the ART birth. Naturally conceived ART siblings were identified through the mother's information. Non-ART children were classified as being born to women who conceived with ovulation induction (OI)/IUI when there was an indication of infertility treatment on the birth certificate, but the woman did not link to the SART CORS; all others were classified as being naturally conceived.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: The study population included 135051 ART children (78362 singletons and 56689 twins), 23647 naturally conceived ART siblings (22301 singletons and 1346 twins) and 9396 children born to women treated with OI/IUI (6597 singletons and 2799 twins) and 1067922 naturally conceived children (1037757 singletons and 30165 twins). All study children were linked to their respective State birth defect registries to identify major defects diagnosed within the first year of life. We classified children with major defects as either chromosomal (i.e. presence of a chromosomal defect with or without any other major defect) or nonchromosomal (i.e. presence of a major defect but having no chromosomal defect), or all major defects (chromosomal and nonchromosomal). Logistic regression models were used to generate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% CI to evaluate the risk of birth defects due to conception with ART (using autologous oocytes and fresh embryos), and with and without the use of ICSI in the absence or presence of male factor infertility, with naturally conceived children as the reference. Analyses within the ART group were stratified by combinations of oocyte source (autologous, donor) and embryo state (fresh, thawed), with births from autologous oocytes and fresh embryos as the reference. Analyses limited to fresh embryos were stratified by oocyte source (autologous, donor) and the use of ICSI. Triplets and higher-order multiples were excluded.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 21998 singleton children (1.9%) and 3037 twin children (3.3%) had a major birth defect. Compared to naturally conceived children, ART singletons (conceived from autologous oocytes, fresh embryos without the use of ICSI) had increased risks of a major nonchromosomal birth defect (AOR 1.18, 95% 1.05, 1.32), cardiovascular defects (AOR 1.20, 95% CI 1.03, 1.40), and any birth defect (AOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.09, 1.27). Compared to naturally conceived children, ART singletons conceived (from autologous oocytes, fresh embryos) with the use of ICSI, the risks were increased for a major nonchromosomal birth defect (AOR 1.30, 95% CI 1.16, 1.45 without male factor diagnosis; AOR 1.42, 95% CI 1.28, 1.57 with male factor diagnosis); blastogenesis defects (AOR 1.49, 95% CI 1.08, 2.05 without male factor; AOR 1.56, 95% CI 1.17, 2.08 with male factor); cardiovascular defects (AOR 1.28, 95% CI 1.10,1.48 without male factor; AOR 1.45, 95% CI 1.27, 1.66 with male factor); in addition, the risk for musculoskeletal defects was increased (AOR 1.34, 95% CI 1.01, 1.78 without male factor) and the risk for genitourinary defects in male infants was increased (AOR 1.33, 95% CI 1.08, 1.65 with male factor). Comparisons within ART singleton births conceived from autologous oocytes and fresh embryos indicated that the use of ICSI was associated with increased risks of a major nonchromosomal birth defect (AOR 1.18, 95% CI 1.03, 1.35), blastogenesis defects (AOR 1.65, 95% CI 1.08, 2.51), gastrointestinal defects (AOR 2.21, 95% CI 1.28, 3.82) and any defect (AOR 1.11, 95% CI 1.01, 1.22). Compared to naturally conceived children, ART singleton siblings had increased risks of musculoskeletal defects (AOR 1.32, 95% CI 1.04, 1.67) and any defect (AOR 1.15, 95% CI 1.08, 1.23). ART twins (conceived with autologous oocytes, fresh embryos, without ICSI) were at increased risk of chromosomal defects (AOR 1.89, 95% CI 1.10, 3.24) and ART twin siblings were at increased risk of any defect (AOR 1.26, 95% CI 1.01, 1.57). The 18% increased risk of a major nonchromosomal birth defect in singleton infants conceived with ART without ICSI (36% of ART births), the 30% increased risk with ICSI without male factor (33% of ART births), and the 42% increased risk with ICSI and male factor (31% of ART births) translates into an estimated excess of 386 major birth defects among the 68908 singleton children born by ART in 2017.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: In the SART CORS database, it was not possible to differentiate method of embryo freezing (slow freezing vs vitrification), and data on ICSI was only available in the fresh embryo ART group. In the OI/IUI group, it was not possible to differentiate type of non-ART treatment utilized, and in both the ART and OI/IUI groups, data were unavailable on duration of infertility.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: The use of ART is associated with increased risks of a major nonchromosomal birth defect, cardiovascular defect and any defect in singleton children, and chromosomal defects in twins; the use of ICSI further increases this risk, the most with male factor infertility. These findings support the judicious use of ICSI only when medically indicated. The relative contribution of ART treatment parameters versus the biology of the subfertile couple to this increased risk remains unclear and warrants further study.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): This project was supported by grant R01 HD084377 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.

Patient demographics, oncologic history, prior treatment, and sexual habits were also queried. Logistic regression was used to evaluate risk factors for sexual dysfunction, and Mann-Whitney U test was used to identify factors associated with individual domains of the FSFI.OUTCOMES: The main outcome measures were FSFI and IIEF-5 score, which are used to diagnose FSD (FSFI<26.55) and ED (IIEF-5<22).RESULTS: A total of 21 (72.4%) female respondents and 20 (71.4%) male respondents were sexually active and completed the survey and FSFI or IIEF-5 questionnaire, respectively. Mean (±SD) age was 23.7 (4.1) years, andaverage age at diagnosis was 9.1 (5.0), with no difference between genders. Overall, 25.0% (5/20) of male and 52.4% (11/21) of female pediatric cancer survivors reported sexual dysfunction (P=.11). Oncologic history and prior treatment were not associated with sexual function. Females who reported difficulty relaxing during intercourse in the last 6months had higher odds of reporting sexual dysfunction (odds ratio: 13.6, 95% confidence interval: 1.2-151.2, P=.03). Subgroup analysis of FSFI domains found that previous radiation therapy was correlated with decreased lubrication and satisfaction during intercourse, whereas previous treatment to the pelvic region significantly reduced satisfaction and increased pain during intercourse.CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Female pediatric cancer survivors have higher odds of reporting sexual dysfunction after treatment and should be screened appropriately to provide early intervention and to mitigate risk.STRENGTH & LIMITATIONS: Our study includes validated questionnaires to assess FSD and ED and queries specific characteristics to assess their association with sexual dysfunction. However, the study is limited by sample size and its cross-sectional survey design.CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of female sexual dysfunction in this cohort is higher than that in the general population of equivalent-aged individuals, and clinicians should be aware of these potential long-term sequelae.

These trends have been linked to potential teratogenicity, maternal morbidity and mortality and poorer fetal outcomes.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: This is a Panel (trend) study of 785809 live births from 2008 to 2016.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: We used the IBM© Marketscan database to gather data on demographic information and International Classification of Diseases codes and Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) during the 12months prior to the estimated date of conception for mothers and fathers. We similarly examined claims of prescriptions in the 3months prior to conception. We performed companion analyses of medications used for >90days in the 12months prior to conception and of any medication use in the 12months prior to conception.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: We confirmed that both maternal medication use and comorbidity (e.g. hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidemia) rose over the study period, consistent with prior studies. We found a concurrent rise in both paternal medication use 3months prior to conception (overall use, 31.5-34.9% during the study period; P<0.0001) and comorbidity (CCI of≥1 and 10.6-18.0% over study period; P<0.0001). The most common conditions seen in the CCI were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease for mothers (6.6-11.6%) and hyperlipidemia for fathers (8.6-13.7%). Similar trends for individual medication classes and specific comorbidities such as hypertension, diabetes and hyperlipidemia were also seen. All primary result trends were statistically significant, making the role of chance minimal.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: As this is a descriptive study, the clinical impact is uncertain and no causal associations may be made. Though the study uses a large and curated database that includes patients from across the USA, our study population is an insured population and our findings may not be generalizable. Mean parental age was seen to slightly increase over the course of the study (<1year) and may be associated with increased comorbidity and medication use.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: As parental comorbidity and certain medication use may impact fecundability, temporal declines in parental health may impact conception, pregnancy and fetal outcomes.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): None.TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: N/A.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1093/humrep/deaa022\n\nView details for PubMedID 32187368\n\nAbstract\n\nBACKGROUND: Bicycle riding's impact on erectile function remains a topic of great interest given cycling's popularity as a mode of transportation and exercise.AIM: We evaluated risk factors for sexual dysfunction in male cyclists with the primary intention of determining if genital/pelvic pain and numbness are associated with erectile dysfunction (ED).METHODS: We surveyed male cyclists using an online anonymous questionnaire. Cyclists were queried on their demographics, cycling experience, and sexual function using the Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM). ED was diagnosed when a completed SHIM score was <22. Regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk of ED in men with genital/pelvic pain or numbness after riding. The survey was designed in the United States.OUTCOMES: Quantitative characterization of cycling habits, onset and timing of genital pain and numbness, and SHIM score.RESULTS: A total of 1635 participants completed the survey. A majority of men were over the age of 50 (58%, 934/1,607), Caucasian (88%, 1,437/1,635), had been active cyclists for over 10years (63%, 1,025/1,635) and used road bikes (97%, 1,578/1,635). Overall, 22%, 30%, and 57% of men reported ED, genital pain, and genital numbness, respectively. While controlling for cohort demographics, body mass index, cycling intensity and equipment, and medical comorbidities, no saddle characteristics were associated with the risk of developing genital numbness. However, men reporting penile numbness were at higher risk of reporting ED (odds ratio [OR]=1.453, P=.048). In addition, quicker onset of numbness and resolution of numbness within a day was associated with impaired erectile function. For example, numbness occurring less than 1hour after cycling had greater odds of leading to ED than numbness after 5hours (OR=2.002, P=.032). Similarly, genital pain occurring less than 1hour (OR=2.466, P=.031) after cycling was associated with higher ED risk.STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Strengths include a large sample size of high-intensity cyclists and validated questionnaire use. Limitations include reliance on anonymous self-reported survey data and minimal inquiry into the riding preferences and terrain traversed by cyclists.CONCLUSIONS: Pelvic pain and numbness are common complaints among male riders in the United States. Men with such complaints are more likely to also report ED especially if it occurs earlier in the ride. Although direction of causality and temporality are uncertain, alleviation of factors resulting in pelvic discomfort may reduce cycling's impact on sexual function. Such interventions are critical given that cycling for both active travel and aerobic exercise confers numerous health benefits. Balasubramanian A, Yu J, Breyer BN, etal.

An IIEF-5 < 21 was considered erectile dysfunction.The main outcome measure of the study was male sexual function via the IIEF domain scores.A total of 325 men completed the survey with a mean age of 46.7 years. 71.1% of the men were Caucasian and 52.6% were married. 13 men (4%) were never users; 29 men (8.9%) used 1-2 times/week; 51 men (15.7%) used 3-5 times/week, and 232 men (71.4%) used 6+ times/week. The average IIEF-5 score was 22.3 with 19.4% of the men having erectile dysfunction. In univariate analysis, men using cannabis more frequently had a higher overall IIEF (65.36 vs 60.52, P = .001), erectile domain (27.32 vs 25.74, P = .03), orgasm domain (9.08 vs 8.12, P < .001), intercourse satisfaction domain (12.42 vs 11.31, P = .006), and overall satisfaction domain (8.11 vs 7.05, P = .002). In multivariable analysis, compared to men who used cannabis 0 times/week, those who used 6 times/week had an increased overall IIEF (69.08 vs 64.64, P-value adjusted = 0.02), intercourse satisfaction domain (P-value adjusted = 0.04), and overall satisfaction domain (P-value adjusted = 0.02). The primary method of consumption (eg, smoking, edibles, etc.) and cannabinoid composition (eg, cannabidiol vs tetrahydrocannabinol dominant) were not associated with sexual function.We report an association between the increased frequency of cannabis use and increased male sexual function. However, while the increased frequency of use was statistically significant with regard to the IIEF scores, the clinical significance of this is likely low, and selection bias may limit the generalizability of these findings. The method of consumption and cannabis chemovar were not associated with sexual function. Bhambhvani HP, Kasman AM, Wilson-King G, et al.

The incidence of infertility is also on the rise, and infertile women experience a higher risk of incident chronic medical disease and cancer, suggesting that fertility may serve as a window to a woman's overall health.To investigate the risk of severe maternal morbidity by maternal fertility status.Retrospective cohort analysis using Optum's de-identifed Clinformatics® Data Mart Database between 2003-2015. Infertile women stratified by infertility diagnosis, testing or treatment were compared to fertile women seeking routine gynecologic care. In both groups, only women who underwent pregnancy and delivery of a singleton during the follow up period were included. Main outcomes were severe maternal morbidity indicators, defined by the CDC, and identified by ICD-10 and CPT codes within 6 weeks of each delivery. Results were adjusted for maternal age, race, education, nulliparity, race, smoking, obesity, delivery mode, preterm birth, number of prenatal visits, and year of delivery.19,658 women comprised the infertile group and 525,695 women comprised the fertile group. The overall incidence of any severe maternal morbidity indicator was 7.0% among women receiving fertility treatment, 6.4% among women receiving a fertility diagnosis, 5.5% among women receiving fertility testing and 4.3% among fertile women.. Overall, infertile women had a significantly higher risk of developing any severe maternal morbidity indicator (AOR 1.22, CI 1.14-1.31, p<0.01) as well as a significantly higher risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) (AOR 1.48, CI 1.26 - 1.73, p<0.01), eclampsia (AOR 1.37, CI 1.05 - 1.79, p<0.01), heart failure during procedure or surgery (AOR 1.54, CI 1.21 - 1.97, p<0.01), internal injuries of the thorax, abdomen or pelvis (AOR 1.59, CI 1.12 - 2.26, p<0.01), intracranial injuries (AOR 1.77, CI 1.20- 2.61, p<0.01), pulmonary edema (AOR 2.18, CI 1.54 - 3.10, p<0.01), thrombotic embolism (AOR 1.58, CI 1.14 - 2.17, p<0.01), and blood transfusion (AOR 1.50, CI 1.30 - 1.72, p<0.01) compared to fertile women. Fertile women did not face a significantly higher risk of any maternal morbidity indicator compared to infertile women. In subgroup analysis by maternal race/ethnicity, the likelihood of severe morbidity was significantly higher among fertile Black women compared to fertile Caucasian women. There was no difference between infertile Black and Caucasian women after multivariable adjustment.Using an insurance claims database, we report that women diagnosed with infertility and women receiving fertility treatment experience a significantly higher risk of multiple indicators of severe maternal morbidity compared to fertile women. The increased risk of severe maternal morbidity noted among fertile Black women compared to fertile Caucasian women is attenuated among infertile Black women, who face similar risks as infertile Caucasian women.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajog.2020.02.027\n\nView details for PubMedID 32112734\n\nAbstract\n\nINTRODUCTION: Bicycle seat pressure on the perineum may impair arousal and clitoral erection, likely contributing to genital pain and numbness experienced by female cyclists.AIM: We aimed to identify the association between genital pain and numbness experienced by female cyclists and female sexual dysfunction (FSD).METHODS: Female cyclists were recruited to complete an online survey using the Female Sexual Function Index (FSFI), a validated questionnaire to assess FSD. Cyclist demographics, experience, preferred riding style, use of ergonomic cycle modifications, and genital discomfort while riding were also queried. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to evaluate risk factors of FSD.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome was FSFI score, which is used to diagnose FSD when the FSFI score is <26.55.RESULTS: Of the survey respondents, 178 (53.1%) completed the survey and FSFI questionnaire. Mean age was 48.1 years (±0.8 standard error [SE]), and the average riding experience was 17.1 years (±0.9 SE). Overall, 53.9% of female cyclists had FSD, 58.1% reported genital numbness, and 69.1% reported genital pain. After adjusting for age, body mass index, relationship status, smoking history, comorbidities, and average time spent cycling per week, females who reported experiencing genital numbness half the time or more were more likely to have FSD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 6.0; 95% CI, 1.5-23.6; P= .01), especially if localized to the clitoris (aOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.2-5.5; P= .02). Females that reported genital pain half the time or more while cycling also were more likely to have FSD (aOR, 3.6; 95% CI, 1.2-11.1; P= .02). Cyclists experiencing genital pain within the first hour of their ride were more likely to have FSD (aOR, 12.6; 95% CI, 2.5-63.1; P= .002). Frequency and duration of cycling were not associated with FSD. Analysis of FSFI domains found that the frequency of numbness was correlated with decreased arousal, orgasm, and satisfaction during intercourse, whereas the frequency of pain significantly reduced arousal, orgasm, and genital lubrication.CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Female cyclists that experience numbness and/or pain have higher odds of reporting FSD.STRENGTHS & LIMITATIONS: Our study includes a validated questionnaire to assess FSD and queries specific characteristics and symptoms of genital pain and genital numbness; however, the study is limited by its cross-sectional survey design.CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need for cyclists to address genital pain and numbness experienced while cycling, and future studies are required to determine if alleviating these symptoms can reduce the impact of cycling on female sexual function.

Information on risk of non-gynecologic cancers is rare and conflicting, and the effect of pregnancy on these risk associations is known for only a minority of cancer types.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: Retrospective cohort analysis between 2003 and 2016 using an insurance claims database.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In all, 64 345 infertile women identified by infertility diagnosis, testing or treatment were compared to 3 128 345 non-infertile patients seeking routine gynecologic care. Women with prior diagnosis of cancer or within 6 months of index event were excluded. Main outcomes were development of any malignancy and individual cancers as identified by ICD-9/ICD-10 codes. Results were adjusted for age at index date, index year, nulliparity, race, smoking, obesity, number of visits per year and highest level of education.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Infertile women had an overall higher risk of developing cancer compared to non-infertile women (2.0 versus 1.7%, adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) = 1.18; CI: 1.12-1.24). In addition, the risk of uterine cancer (0.10 versus 0.06%, aHR = 1.78; CI: 1.39-2.28), ovarian cancer (0.14 versus 0.09%, aHR 1.64; CI: 1.33-2.01), lung cancer (0.21 versus 0.21%, aHR = 1.38; CI: 1.01-1.88), thyroid cancer (0.21 versus 0.16%, aHR = 1.29; CI: 1.09-1.53), leukemia (0.10 versus 0.06%, aHR = 1.55; CI: 1.21-1.98) and liver and gallbladder cancer (0.05 versus 0.03%, aHR = 1.59; CI: 1.11-2.30) were higher in infertile women compared to non-infertile women. In a subgroup analysis of women in each cohort who became pregnant and had a delivery during enrollment, the risk of uterine and ovarian cancer were similar between infertile and non-infertile women. In a subgroup analysis excluding women with PCOS and endometriosis from both cohorts, the risk of uterine cancer was similar between infertile and non-infertile women.LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Absolute risk of cancer was low, average follow up for each individual was limited, and average age at index date was limited. Insurance databases have known limitations.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: Using claims-based data, we report that infertile women may have a higher risk of certain cancers in the years after infertility evaluation; continued follow up should be considered after reproductive goals are achieved.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): None.\n\nView details for PubMedID 30863841\n\nAbstract\n\nSTUDY QUESTION: What is the relationship between semen parameters and birth defect (BD) rates in offspring of men evaluated for infertility?SUMMARY ANSWER: Among men undergoing infertility evaluation, there is no significant relationship between semen parameters and defect rates in live or still births, even when considering mode of conception.WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: Approximately 15% of couples have fertility difficulties, with up to a 50% male factor contribution. An increased risk of BDs exists in couples using ART, particularly IVF and ICSI, but it is unknown if this related to the ART procedures or an underlying male factor.STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: To determine if the severity of male factor infertilty, as assessed via sperm quality and mode of conception, is associated with BD rates, we performed a retrospective cohort study. Fathers with semen analysis data in the Baylor College of Medicine Semen Database (BCMSD) were linked with their offspring using Texas Birth Defects Registry (TBDFR) data between 1999 and 2009. In this 10-year period, a total of 1382 men were identified in linkage between the BCMSD and TBDFR. A total of 109 infants with and 2115 infants without BDs were identified.PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: To determine the association between BDs and semen parameters, we used hierarchical linear modeling to determine odds ratios between BD rates, semen parameters, and mode of conception before and after adjustment for paternal, maternal and birth covariates. Semen parameters were stratified based on thresholds defined by the WHO fifth edition laboratory manual for the examination and processing of human semen.MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: In total 4.9% of 2224 infants were identified with a BD. No statistically significant association was observed between BD rates and semen parameters, before or after adjustment for covariates. The association between sperm concentration and BDs demonstrated an odds ratio (OR) of 1.07 (95% confidence interval: 0.63-1.83); motility: OR 0.91 (0.52-2.22); and total motile count: OR 1.21 (0.70-2.08). Likewise, mode of conception, including infertility treatment and ART, did not affect BD rates (P > 0.05).LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: BDs recorded in the TBDFR only include live born infants or still births after 20 weeks, our study did not evaluate the effect of impaired semen parameters on developmental defects prior to 20 weeks of gestation. With 109 BDs, our statistical analysis was powered to detect moderate differences associated with particular semen parameters. Additionally, data about mode of conception was not available for 1053 of 2224 births.WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: BD rates are not associated with semen quality or mode of conception. The current study suggests that the severity of male factor infertility does not impact the rate of congenital anomalies. This information is important when counseling couples concerned about the relationship between impaired semen quality and BDs.STUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTEREST(S): Supported in part by the NIH Men's Reproductive Health Research (MRHR) K12 HD073917 (D.J.L.), the Multidisciplinary K12 Urologic Research (KURe) Career Development Program (D.J.L.), P01HD36289 from the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute for Child Health and Human Development, NIH (D.J.L.), and by U01DD000494 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Title V Block Grant to the Texas Department of State Health Services.

Data was linked to the Danish causes of death register and sociodemographic registers through personal identification numbers assigned to all Danish citizens at birth.Men that had undergone MAR in Denmark (MAR Cohort; n = 64 563) were identified from the Danish IVF register, which includes data on whether infertility was due to male factor. For each man in the MAR cohort, five age-matched men who became fathers without fertility treatment were selected from the general population (non-MAR fathers; n = 322 108). Men that could not adequately be tracked in the Danish CPR register (n = 1259) and those that were censored prior to study entry (n = 993) were excluded, leaving a final population of 384 419 men. Risk of death was calculated by Cox regression analysis with age as an underlying timeline and adjustments for educational attainment, civil status and year of study entry. The risk of death was compared among men with and without male factor infertility identified from the IVF register (internal comparisons) as well as to the non-MAR fathers (external comparison).The risk of death between the MAR cohort (all men, regardless of infertility) and the non-MAR fathers was comparable [hazard ratio (HR), 1.07; 95% CI, 0.98-1.15]. When the MAR cohort was limited to infertile men, these men were at increased risk of death [HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.12-1.44]. However, when stratified by type of male factor infertility, men with azoospermia had the highest risk of death, which persisted when in both the internal [HR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.54-3.41] and external comparison [HR, 3.32; 95% CI, 2.02-5.40]. No significantly elevated risk of death was observed among men with oligospermia [HR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.87-1.50] and unspecified male factor [HR, 1.10; 95% CI, 0.75-1.61] compared with the non-MAR fathers. The same trends were observed for the internal comparison.Duration of the follow-up was limited and there is limited generalizability to infertile men who do not seek fertility treatment.Using national health registers, we found an increased risk of death among azoospermic men while no increased risk was found among men with other types of infertility. For the azoospermic men, further insight into causal pathways is needed to identify options for monitoring and prevention.This study is part of the ReproUnion collaborative study, co-financed by the European Union, Interreg V ÖKS.

A 10:1 sample of births from non-IVF deliveries were selected for comparison. Those with an indication of infertility treatment on the birth certificate were categorized as subfertile and omitted for the study population; all others were categorized as fertile. The IVF pregnancies were additionally categorized by oocyte source (autologous vs donor) and embryo state (fresh vs thawed). Both the fertile and IVF births were limited to singletons only, and the IVF pregnancies were limited to those using partner sperm. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (including gestational hypertension and preeclampsia) were identified from the birth certificate, modeled using logistic regression, and reported as adjusted odds ratios (AOR) and 95% confidence intervals. For analyses of IVF pregnancies from autologous oocytes-fresh embryos, the reference group was fertile women (subgroup analysis 1). For analyses within the IVF group, the reference group was autologous oocytes- fresh embryos (subgroup analysis 2).The study population included 1,465,893 pregnancies (1,382,311 births to fertile women and 83,582 births to IVF-treated women). Compared to fertile women, IVF women with autologous-fresh cycles did not have an increased risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy [AOR 1.04, 95% CI 0.99, 1.08]. Among IVF births (subgroup analysis 2), the risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy was increased for autologous-thawed, 1.30 [1.20, 1.40]; donor-fresh, 1.92 [1.71, 2.15]; donor-thawed, 1.70 [1.47, 1.96]. Excluding women with pregestational diabetes or chronic hypertension, and adjusting for body mass index and infertility diagnoses did not substantially change the results. When stratified by <34 weeks (early onset hypertensive disorders of pregnancy) versus ≥34 weeks (late onset hypertensive disorders of pregnancy), only the donor-fresh group had an increased risk for early-onset, but the risks for all other oocyte source-embryo state groups compared to autologous-fresh were increased for late-onset.The risk for hypertensive disorders of pregnancy is increased for IVF-treated women and in pregnancies conceived via frozen embryo transfer (with both autologous or donor oocyte) and fresh donor oocyte embryo transfer. No increase in risk was seen with fresh autologous IVF cycles. Excluding women with pregestational diabetes or chronic hypertension, and adjusting for body mass index and infertility diagnoses did not substantially change the results.\n\nView details for DOI 10.1016/j.ajog.2019.10.003\n\nView details for PubMedID 31629726\n\nAbstract\n\nThe subsequent health risks associated with Peyronie's disease (PD) are unknown.This cohort study assesses the risk of developing auto-immune conditions and common chronic health conditions after a diagnosis of PD. We hypothesize that an increase in auto-immune disease will be evident in men with PD, as has been suggested in smaller studies.We determined the longitudinal incidence of 13 auto-immune diseases and 25 common chronic conditions in a cohort from the Truven Health Analytics (Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA) database from 2007-2013. The cohort included men with 1 of 3 exposures in 2007: (1) men with PD, (2) men with erectile dysfunction (ED) but not PD, and (3) men without PD or ED, matched on age and follow-up duration.To assess incidence, we utilized a Cox regression model adjusting for age, smoking, obesity, health care visits per year, urology visits per year, and years of follow-up.We included 8,728 men with PD; 204,147 men with ED; and 87,280 controls. Men with PD had an increased risk of developing benign prostatic hyperplasia (hazard ratio [HR] 1.21, 95% CI 1.16-"
