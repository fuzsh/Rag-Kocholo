        "text": "event\n\nFilthy Nasty Productions\n\nLacuna Coil\n\nwith God Forbid, Lions At The Gate\n\nAges 16 and Up\n\n$35.00 - $65.00\n\nAdditional Info\n\nThis event is partially seated.\n\nTo see a large version of the seating chart go here: https://irp.cdn-website.com/6f06eb1e/dms3rep/multi/2023+New+Seating+Chart.jpg\n\nArtists\n\nLacuna Coil\n\nIt was October of 2002, and the turn of the millennium saw the world of heavy music in flux. If\n\nyou were paying attention to the press then you’d have probably been reading about the\n\nchart-smashing successes of bands like Korn and Queens of the Stone Age, and while Nu\n\nMetal was undeniably king, the angst-ridden musical fragmentation of the 90s had produced a\n\npanoply of genre-bending up-and-comers who refused to sit comfortably in any pre-ordained\n\ncategory or play by the creative rules laid out for them. It would swiftly transform the musical\n\nlandscape in ways nobody could have predicted, and riding the crest of that wave was a humble\n\nItalian outfit who dared to dream big.\n\nLacuna Coil had already been around for eight years, and their two previous releases – 1999’s\n\ndebut In A Reverie and 2001’s Unleashed Memories via longtime label Century Media had\n\nroundly established them as a formidable studio and live act spearheaded by Andrea Ferro and\n\nCristina Scabbia’s pitch-forked vocal delivery, but the gulf between Milan’s most promising\n\nexports and wider recognition was down to more than geography alone. While the genetic\n\nmaterial for 2002’s Comalies was already in place in the form of bassist and songwriter-in-chief\n\nMarco ‘Maki’ Coti-Zelati, Lacuna Coil’s third release was the pivotal moment that would usher in\n\na globe and decade-spanning career. All that said, while the landmark release would undeniably\n\nchange their destiny forever, what is now undeniably an anthem laden millennial classic was\n\nanything but an overnight success. If anything, it established Lacuna Coil as a band with the\n\nstamina to go the distance and much of the climbing still lay ahead.\n\nNow, 20 years later, Lacuna Coil decided to revisit the songs, but not to just re-record the songs\n\nas they were, but deconstruct and transport them into 2022. “This is not a reboot or a spin-off or\n\nanything like that,” says vocalist Cristina Scabbia.”We just wanted to give these songs a 2022\n\ndress and see how this guy or girl who was born 20 years ago would still look fucking slick in\n\n2022.\n\nLions At The Gate\n\nA familiar signature sound, but with a fresh and rejuvenated take, former Ill Niño members Cristian\n\nMachado (vocals), guitarists Diego Verduzco and Ahrue Luster (ex-Machine Head) along with bassist\n\nStephen Brewer and drummer Fern Lemus are LIONS AT THE GATE.\n\nMoving on from their previous projects, these musical forces made the most of their creative freedom and\n\nnew found inspiration. Machado’s powerful vocals are better than ever as he soars with a steady balance\n\nand grace with his aggressive scowl as well as embracing his softer side. What is not lost in this band's\n\nmusical palette are the dynamics of their trademark heaviness, supported by the foundation of big\n\nchoruses to balance the crushing rhythm within the songs."
