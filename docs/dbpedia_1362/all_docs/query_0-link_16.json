Each Contracting Party undertakes that not later than six months after the date of entry into force of this Convention in respect of that Party it shall introduce into its law the rules regarding an international will set out in the Annex to this Convention.\n\n2. Each Contracting Party may introduce the provisions of the Annex into its law either by reproducing the actual text, or by translating it into its official language or languages.\n\n3. Each Contracting Party may introduce into its law such further provisions as are necessary to give the provisions of the Annex full effect in its territory.\n\n4. Each Contracting Party shall submit to the Depositary Government the text of the rules introduced into its national law in order to implement the provisions of this Convention.\n\nArticle II\n\n1. Each Contracting Party shall implement the provisions of the Annex in its law, within the period provided for in the preceding article, by designating the persons who, in its territory, shall be authorized to act in connection with international wills. It may also designate as a person authorized to act with regard to its nationals its diplomatic or consular agents abroad insofar as the local law does not prohibit it.\n\n2. The Party shall notify such designation, as well as any modifications thereof, to the Depositary Government.\n\nArticle III\n\nThe capacity of the authorized person to act in connection with an international will, if conferred in accordance with the law of a Contracting Party, shall be recognized in the territory of the other Contracting Parties.\n\nArticle IV\n\nThe effectiveness of the certificate provided for in Article 10 of the Annex shall be recognized in the territories of all Contracting Parties.\n\nArticle V\n\n1. The conditions requisite to acting as a witness of an international will shall be governed by the law under which the authorized person was designated. The same rule shall apply as regards an interpreter who is called upon to act.\n\n2. Nonetheless no one shall be disqualified to act as a witness of an international will solely because he is an alien.\n\nArticle VI\n\n1. The signature of the testator, of the authorized person, and of the witnesses to an internatíonal will, whether on the will or on the certificate, shall be exempt from any legalization or like formality.\n\n2. Nonetheless, the competent authorities of any Contracting Party may, if necessary, satisfy themselves as to the authenticity of the signature of the authorized person.\n\nArticle VII\n\nThe safekeeping of an international will shall be governed by the law under which the authorized person was designated.\n\nArticle VIII\n\nNo reservation shall be admitted to this Convention or to its Annex.\n\nArticle IX\n\n1. The present Convention shall be open for signature at Washington from October 26, 1973, until December 31, 1974.\n\n2. The Convention shall be subject to ratification.\n\n3. Instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the Government of the United States of America, which shall be the Depositary Government.\n\nArticle X\n\n1. The Convention shall be open indefinitely for accession.\n\n2. Instruments of accession shall be deposited with the Depositary Government.\n\nArticle XI\n\n1. The present Convention shall enter into force six months after the date of deposit of the fifth instrument of ratification or accession with the Depositary Government.\n\n2. In the case of each State which ratifies this Convention or accedes to it after the fifth instrument of ratification or accession has been deposited, this Convention shall enter into force six months after the deposit of its own instrument of ratification or accession.\n\nArticle XII\n\n1. Any Contracting Party may denounce this Convention by written notification to the Depositary Government.\n\n2. Such denunciation shall take effect twelve months from the date on which the Depositary Government has reccived the notification, but such denunciation shall not affect the validity of any will made during the period that the Convention was in effect for the denouncing State.\n\nArticle XIII\n\n1. Any State may, when it deposits its instrument of ratification or accession or at any time thereafter, declare, by a notice addressed to the Depositary Government, that this Convention shall apply to all or part of the territories for the international relations of which it is responsible.\n\n2. Such declaration shall have effect six months after the date on which the Depositary Government shall have received notice thereof or, if at the end of such period the Convention has not yet come into force, from the date of its entry into force.\n\n3. Each Contracting Party which has made a declaration in accordance with paragraph 1 of this Article may, in accordance with Article XII, denounce this Convention in relation to all or part of the territories concerned.\n\nArticle XIV\n\n1. If a State has two or more territorial units in which different systems of law apply in relation to matters respecting the form of wills, it may at the time of signature, ratification, or accession, declare that this Convention shall extend to all its territorial units or only to one or more of them, and may modify its declaration by submitting another declaration at any time.\n\n2. These declarations shall be notified to the Depositary Government and shall state expressly the territorial units to which the Convention applies.\n\nArticle XV\n\nIf a Contracting Party has two or more territorial units in which different systems of law apply in relation to matters respecting the form of wills, any reference to the internal law of the place where the will is made or to the law under which the authorized person has been appointed to act in connection with international wills shall be construed in accordance with the constitutional system of the Party concerned.\n\nArticle XVI\n\n1. The original of the present Convention, in the English, French, Russian and Spanish languages, each version being equally authentic, shall be deposited with the Government of the United States of America, which shall transmit certified copies thereof to each of the signatory and acceding States and to the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law.\n\n2. The Depositary Government shall give notice to the signatory and acceding States, and to the International Institute for the Unification of Private Law, of:\n\n(a) any signature;\n\n(b) the deposit of any instrument of ratification or accession;\n\n(c) any date on which this Convention enters into force in accordance with Article XI;\n\n(d) any communication received in accordance with Article I, paragraph 4;\n\n(e) any notice received in accordance with Article II, paragraph 2;\n\n(f) any declaration received in accordance with Article XIII, paragraph 2, and the date on which such declaration takes effect;\n\n(g) any denunciation received in accordance with Article XII, paragraph 1, or Article XIII, paragraph 3, and the date on which the denunciation takes effect;\n\n(h) any declaration received in accordance with Article XIV, paragraph 2, and the date on which the declaration takes effect.\n\nIN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned Plenipotentiaries, being duly authorized to that effect, have signed the present Convention.\n\nDONE at Washington this twenty-sixth day of October, one thousand nine hundred and seventy-three.\n\nANNEX\n\nUNIFORM LAW ON THE FORM OF AN INTERNATIONAL WILL\n\nArticle 1\n\n1.
