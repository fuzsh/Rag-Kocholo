        "text": "Edinburgh based artist Andrea Geile studied Visual Art in Hanover, Germany, and has held residencies in Orkney, Germany, France and Australia. She has been working from her Scottish studio since 1996 and has realised many public and private art commissions. Her outdoor sculptures are made from Corten steel, often grouped with real plants and relating directly to the site environment. They are subtle interventions, merging into the landscape and are often only visible on closer inspection. Among others she has received Awards from the RSA and the RHS Chelsea Flower Show.\n\nAndrea’s sculptures are hand-made from Corten steel; a weatherproof steel that forms a protective layer which stops further corrosion. They therefore have an unlimited life span and do not stain. Andrea fabricates all her sculptures herself. The patterns are first drawn onto sheet metal then hand-cut, assembled like a 3D puzzle and finally welded together. Andrea has worked on several large scale public commissions including Culzean Castle and, most recently, a sculpture commission titled ‘The Chlorophylles’ at the FANK Arts & Heritage site in Lettermore Forest on the Isle of Mull; celebrating the community effort bringing this site back to life.\n\nPublic Collections include:\n\nCity of Edinburgh Council; The University of Edinburgh; NHS Tayside; City of Albany Art Collection, Australia"
