        "text": "Jennifer Acosta\n\nExecutive Vice President, WorldStrides Higher Ed\n\nJennifer Acosta has been with ISA since 1996 and now as Senior Vice President & General Manager for International Studies abroad (ISA) and The Education Abroad Network (TEAN). She graduated from SUNY Plattsburgh with a Bachelor's Degree in Spanish and Latin American Studies, and then from Southwest Texas State University with a Master of Arts in Teaching Spanish. Her education abroad includes a semester at the Universidad de Sevilla in Sevilla, Spain and a summer at the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City.\n\nJennifer believes in providing exceptional study abroad experiences for college students and is an avid traveler herself. She served as Senior Vice President of Enrollment Management for 10 years prior to her appointment as General Manager. Jennifer has played a key role in ISA's development during her tenure and cites a passion for meeting students on their terms. She lives in Austin, Texas with her husband and two daughters.\n\nAngel (Chicho) Eguiluz Pacheco\n\nSenior Vice President, Global Operations\n\nÁngel Eguiluz Pacheco, known by all as \"Chicho,\" is ISA's Senior Vice President of Global Operations. A native of Spain's northern coastal town of Santander, Chicho began his career with the program when he settled in the southern city of Sevilla in 1997. Before beginning work with the Sevilla program, Chicho spent several years at the University of Salamanca, where he received his degree in Spanish Language and Literature and went on to earn a Masters Degree in Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language. His university career also included his own personal study-abroad experience, when he was awarded a grant to study at the University of Leuven in Belgium. Chicho later went on to experience life in the United States while in Virginia teaching Spanish at James Madison University. His accumulated knowledge of foreign language studies, as well as his ability to closely connect with American study abroad students, have given Chicho the reputation that he has acquired within the study-abroad sphere both in the United States and in Spain. Now leading all of ISA's programs in Europe, Chicho is often on the move, although the Sevilla office remains his home base.\n\nBeth Price\n\nSenior Vice President, Student Outreach\n\nBeth first fell in love with travel during her semester of study abroad as a Marketing student at the University of St. Thomas. As an avid life-long-learner, Beth most recently completed her MBA at UT Austin. While her Minnesota roots were as thick as her accent, she moved to Austin, TX the summer of 2009 to join the ISA team. Since then she has continued exciting travels, which includes exploring 6 out of the 7 continents (you're next, Antarctica). Some of her favorite highlights include climbing Kilimanjaro, seeing the Northern Lights in Iceland, scaling the Great Wall of China, bartering for a rug at the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul, and relishing in Peruvian cuisine while enjoying the view of Machu Picchu.\n\nSusan Farley\n\nVice President, Financial Affairs\n\nSusan was born and raised in Texas and graduated from Texas Christian University with a B.A. in Latin American Studies and Spanish. Her primary study abroad experience was in Costa Rica, where she enjoyed living with a family and exploring the beautiful country. That first program abroad changed the course of her life and sparked a passion for international education. Susan joined the ISA team in 1997 and has returned to Costa Rica many times over the years for business and personal travel. She has also been fortunate to travel extensively in and around ISA's program locations in Europe, Latin America and the Pacific. In her free time, she most enjoys exploring the great outdoors with her husband, sons and the family dog.\n\nMark Gallovic\n\nVice President, Strategic Partnerships\n\nMark has been dedicated to the education abroad profession for more than 24 years, having been transformed by his own student experiences abroad in Venezuela, Mexico, and Spain, as a high school and undergraduate student. Prior to joining ISA in 2014 as Vice President for Strategic Partnerships, he served as Director of Education Abroad as the University North Carolina Wilmington, for eight years, as Assistant Director of the Office of International Programs at Arizona State University for eight years before that, and previously for the Institute for Study Abroad, both in the U.S. and Australia. Mark earned undergraduate degrees in International Studies and Spanish at Miami University, and a M.Ed. in Higher Education Administration from Arizona State University. When not focused on education abroad program development, he likes to go off recipe, and cook by the inspiration of quirky ingredient baskets. Like many others hailing from Cleveland, Ohio, Mark will always root for the underdog.\n\nDavid Puente, Ph.D.\n\nAssociate Vice President, Academics\n\nDavid grew up in Minnesota looking at maps and reading about faraway places when not busy shoveling snow. As a backpacker and later as a military officer he began exploring more temperate parts of the world, and at last count he had visited 45 countries. Shortly after moving to Spain in 2002 he joined ISA. Since then he has worn many hats and shown he's game for any challenge. Currently he leads our site visits and spearheads efforts to enhance and assess students' intercultural learning. David feels lucky to work closely with upper management, resident staff and faculty on both sides of the Atlantic, doing his best to live up to his last name--bridge in Spanish! He is a proud parent, a political news junky, and a bit of a music snob.\n\nElizabeth Erbeznik, Ph.D.\n\nSenior Associate Vice President, Curriculum and Academics\n\nHailing from Northern California, Elizabeth graduated summa cum laude from UCLA with a BA in English and French and then received her MA and PhD in Comparative Literature from the University of Texas at Austin. Elizabeth first traveled to Switzerland as a high school exchange student, then studied abroad for a year in Lyon, France, where she enrolled in literature courses with local students and traveled throughout most of Western Europe during long vacations. After graduating from UCLA, she joined the Peace Corps and taught English in Madagascar. Before joining ISA, she taught French language and literature courses at Northern Illinois University and UT-Austin. She loves reading books in their original language (or translations), traveling, camping and going on adventures with her husband and daughter.\n\nRobin Reliford, J.D.\n\nHead of Health & Safety\n\nRobin joined International Studies Abroad in 2013 and oversees international risk and crisis management for ISA’s higher education programs. She works with staff globally to monitor world events to mitigate against risks; implement emergency protocols and procedures; and manage student emergencies. She works closely with executive management on policy development and compliance. Robin is a leader in the field, presenting on issues affecting student health and safety at local and national conferences. A Philadelphia native, Robin received her J.D. from the University of Pittsburgh School of Law and her B.A. from West Chester University. An avid traveler, Robin is always ready for her next international experience and believes that one day she will learn to pack light.\n\nPatrick Barker\n\nDirector, Health, Safety & Security\n\nPatrick joined the ISA team in August of 2014 working in the ISA Embedded Office at the University of Kentucky. After receiving his BA in Geography from the University of Kentucky, he spent time in Washington, D.C. interning with the Overseas Security Advisory Council. Patrick later returned to UK for his MA from the Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce, where he focused on national security policy. He studied abroad in Amman, Jordan for a summer where he fell in love with the Middle East. He has also been fortunate enough to travel to over 50 countries all over the world. In his free time, Patrick enjoys trying new restaurants, road trips, Instagraming and cheering on his beloved Kentucky Wildcats.\n\nKate McSurley\n\nAssistant Director, Health, Safety & Risk Management\n\nKate first traveled abroad as a participant of TEAN, studying in Australia at the University of Queensland. Her time overseas allowed her to examine English literature from a fresh, new angle and have a proper introduction to Australian literature. Before joining TEAN, Kate also served as a National Admissions Advisor for a fashion & interior design college as well as a technical writer for a sport technology company. Kate holds a BA in English/Communications from Saint Xavier University and earned her M.A. in English at DePaul University, both in Chicago. Since her time at UQ, she has continued her travels throughout Europe and the U.S., but she will always have a soft spot for Australia.\n\nYolanda Golden\n\nHead of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nYolanda Golden leads WorldStrides’ strategic planning and implementation of diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that impact employee training and development, product delivery, and customer service.\n\nYolanda has enriched communities by serving, training, and developing programs to support diverse populations for over 25+ years in K12 and Higher Ed spaces. She joined WorldStrides in 2017 and has enhanced the lives of thousands of students by delivering exceptional STEM programs within the Envision unit of WorldStrides. Yolanda has spearheaded, collaborated, or supported various aspects of WorldStrides’ current DEI infrastructure and programming to include the development of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) and the DEI Council.\n\nYolanda earned a BS in Psychology from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign and a Master of Social Work from Loyola University of Chicago. She's previously served as Associate Dean of Student Success at Arrupe College of Loyola University Chicago as well as Adjunct Professor and Academic Advisor Coordinator at Loyola where she was responsible for ensuring policies and curriculum were inclusive, and equitably met the needs of unrepresented populations. While at Loyola she developed coursework centered on the differential needs of vulnerable populations and practice strategies for invention to budding undergraduate and graduate level educators and social worker scholars.\n\nEmily Busse\n\nSenior Director, Enrollment Management\n\nEmily grew up in a family that celebrated international student exchange, leading her to spend her junior year of high school living with a host family in Melilla, Spain. After graduating from DePaul University, Emily spent another year in Spain, this time living in Malaga and teaching English at a local school. During this period, her younger sister studied abroad in Malaga through ISA. Upon returning home to Chicago, Emily was happy to land at ISA headquarters in Austin, TX as a Program Manager. After six years on the Enrollment Management team, she relocated to Melbourne, Australia for a new role with ISA, which by then had joined the WorldStrides family of companies. In her role as Global Mobility Manager, she helped open a new student recruitment market, partnering with Australian and New Zealand universities to send their students on WorldStrides programs worldwide. Following two exciting years down under, Emily returned to the US to explore new opportunities, expanding her experience in the higher education experiential learning space by working in corporate university recruiting, managing the hiring of interns and new college graduates. Emily is thrilled to have returned to international education and WorldStrides in her role as Senior Director, Enrollment Management. Emily oversees management of ISA & TEAN programs, supporting the Enrollment Management team and all ISA and TEAN students through every phase of the program lifecycle.\n\nMatt Gulizia\n\nDirector, Enrollment Management\n\nOriginally from Omaha, NE, Matt earned his B.S. in International Business, B.A. in French, and M.Ed. in Higher Educational Administration from the University of Nebraska - Lincoln. He studied in Paris through ISA as an undergraduate, which sparked his passion for education abroad and the French language and culture. In his spare time, he likes practicing yoga, baking, and exploring different coffee shops in whichever city he finds himself. Matt finds study abroad to be one of the best ways to contribute to personal growth and loves being a part of that for his students.\n\nAnthony Viltro\n\nAssociate Director, Enrollment Management\n\nAnthony is from Ohio and attended The Ohio State University where he earned degrees in Psychology and Italian. It's hard to believe that once upon a time, Anthony dreaded the idea of learning a second language and studying abroad.

My name is Stuart but feel free to call me \"Stu\", it's been my nickname ever since I was a kid. I was born in North Miami beach, but I was raised in the city of Pembroke Pines, Florida. When I was a kid, my parents would always take me on trips to Disney World, which first sparked a small flame for hospitality, hotels, and travel of course. Over time, we slowly started to travel to other states, to experience some of our Nation's beautiful history, people, and landscapes. I have seen the White House and visited Times square. I will always remember attending Derek Jeter's last game at Fenway Park in Boston, but most of all taking in the view of Grand Canyon was unlike anything I'd seen before. Even so, something was missing. I recently graduated from Florida International University in December '21 with my bachelor's in hospitality management and a focus on travel and tourism. In my time at FIU, I wanted to learn about international cultures and people so that I could continue learning about myself as an individual. I achieved this goal when I studied abroad remotely as an intern in Vietnam, and it was the best decision I ever made. It will be my pleasure to assist you along your journey in making this dream a reality.\n\nKenzi Starr\n\nDirector, Veritas Christian Study Abroad\n\nA born and raised Kansan, Kenzi grew up watching the Travel Channel and dreaming of a chance to explore the world.
