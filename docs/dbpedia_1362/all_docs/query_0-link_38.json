        "text": "One of Italy's most captivating and talented cinematic comedy stars, Italian veteran Alberto Sordi was known for satirizing his country's social mores in pungent black comedies, farcical tales and grim drama. He, along with peers Vittorio Gassman, Ugo Tognazzi and Nino Manfredi, arguably represent the finest of post-war Italian cinema history. Born in Rome on June 15, 1920 in the Trastevere district, Sordi grew up in a musical family, his father being a tuba player for the Rome Opera House. A choir boy at the Sistine Chapel, he later trained for the theater in Milan but returned to Rome to work in radio and musical halls in comedy shows. In the late 30s he found his way into film as an extra. His first important role was in The Three Pilots (1942), a fascist war picture, but he wouldn't hit international stardom until a decade later when he starred in Federico Fellini's early films The White Sheik (1952) and I Vitelloni (1953). The titles of some of his most prolific characters were as simple as their titles: The Seducer, The Bachelor, The Husband, The Widower, The Traffic Cop, and The Moralist. Most of his protagonists amusingly, but not always pleasantly, stereotyped the worst attributes of Italian men and society, yet many of his films are unparalleled in quality and considered masterpieces. Sordi went on to star, direct and co-write more than 150 films. Never married and rather an introvert, he enjoyed a quiet, reclusive personal life. On his 80th birthday, he was made Mayor of Rome for the day. In 2002, after 190 films, he announced his retirement, and died of a heart attack the following year at age 82.\n\nClaudio Santamaria is born in Rome. His career begins on the big screen in 1998, but his big break arrives in 2001, when Gabriele Muccino casts him for \"L'Ultimo Bacio\". Throughout the years he appears in many movies and in 2005 he wins the Nastro D'Argento for Best Actor for \"Romanzo Criminale\" directed by Michele Placido. The Italian and international movies that highlighted his career include: \"Il Cartaio\" by Dario Argento, \"Torneranno I Prati\" by Ermanno Olmi, \"Casino Royale\" by Martin Campbell, \"600 Kilos d'or pur\" by Eric Besnard and \"Pauline Dètective\" directed by Marc Fitoussi. He voiced Christian Bale's Batman in Italian in \"Batman Begins\", \"The Dark Knight\", \"The Dark Knight Rises\" and Batman in \"The Lego Movie\", \"LEGO Batman - The Movie\", The LEGO Movie 2 - The Second Part\" and in the Spotify Podcast \"Batman - Un'autopsia\". He is beloved from the tv audience for his performance in the biopic of the famous Italian singer \"Rino Gaetano - Il Cielo è Sempre Più Blu\" and being himself a great musician he performed all the songs in this series. In 2015 he appears as the protagonist, Orlando Mieli, in the TV series \"È Arrivata la Felicità\", a romantic comedy acclaimed by the Italian public since the pilot episode, this is why the second season was confirmed in 2017. The past few years he works in theatre, acting in \"Occidente Solitario\" by Martin McDonagh directed by Juan Diego Puerta Lopez and \"Gospodin\" by Philipp Lohle directed by Giorgio Barberio Corsetti. In 2017 he acts as Enzo Ceccotti in \"Lo Chiamavano Jeeg Robot\", directed by Gabriele Mainetti: It was thanks to this role that he wins the David Di Donatello as Best Actor. In the meantime he debuts as a director with the short movie \"The Millionairs\"; his cinematic journey proceeds throughout the next few years with \"Brutti e Cattivi\", first movie by Cosimo Gomez, \"Rimetti a Noi i Nostri Debiti\" by Antonio Morabito, \"Tutto il Mio Folle Amore\" directed by Oscar Wininng director Gabriele Salvatores presented in the 76th Venice International Film Festival. He continues his creative journey with the director Gabriele Muccino working on \"Gli Anni Più Belli\" released in 2020. In 2021 he is presented in the 78th Venice International Film Festival with the Film \"Freaks Out\" directed by Gabriele Mainetti where he acts as \"BeastMan\" affected by hypertrichosis with super-human strength. In 2022 he is Matteo, Postulator of the Vatican, in the Sky series \"Christian\" directed by Stefano Lodovichi and Antonio Nicastro, manager of the daily newspaper \"L'Ora - Inchiostro contro Piombo\" directed by Piero Messina, Ciro D'Emilio and Stefano Lorenzi. He also voiced the brave monster hunter Jacob Holland in Italian in the animated Netflix show \"Il Mostro Dei Mari\". In 2023 he acts as Franco in the drama \"Educazione Fisica\" directed by Stefano Cipani and presented as preview in the National Film Festival in Rome, he returns in the second season of the series \"Christian\" as Matteo, and is the voice of Super Mario in the animated movie \"Super Mario Bros - The Movie\".\n\nBorn in Milan in 1933, Gian Maria Volontè studied in Rome at the National Dramatic Arts Academy, where he obtained his degree in 1957. He began working in theatre and television, where he was soon noticed as one of the most promising actors of his generation. After several supporting appearances in film, he reached notoriety with the character of Ramón Rojo in Sergio Leone's Für eine Handvoll Dollar (1964). This success was doubled in Leone's next film, Für ein paar Dollar mehr (1965). The following ten years would be the most intense of Volontè career. Die unglaublichen Abenteuer des hochwohllöblichen Ritters Branca Leone (1966) (directed by Mario Monicelli) was the most successful Italian movie of the year, Zwei Särge auf Bestellung (1967) (directed by Elio Petri) won the Grand Prix du Scenario at the Cannes Film Festival, and Volontè won his first Nastro d'Argento (Silver Ribbon - the most prestigious acting award in Italy) in 1970 for Ermittlungen gegen einen über jeden Verdacht erhabenen Bürger (1970) (also directed by Petri), making him an international star. The film won the Academy Award for Best Foreign-Language Film, the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival and two Italian Golden Globes, including one for his performance. In 1972, he starred in two Italian movies as the protagonist: Petri's Der Weg der Arbeiterklasse ins Paradies (1971) and Francesco Rosi's Der Fall Mattei (1972), both of which won the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival, where he also won a Special Mention. In his life, Volontè won a huge number of other prizes and honours, becoming one of the most celebrated Italian actors of the seventies, and challenging Vittorio Gassman and Marcello Mastroianni as the most popular Italian actor. He died in Greece in 1994.\n\nGiancarlo Giannini is an Oscar-nominated Italian actor, director and multilingual dubber who made an international reputation for his leading roles in Italian films as well as for his mastery of a variety of languages and dialects.\n\nHe was born August 1, 1942, in La Spezia, Italy. For 10 years he lived and studied in Naples, earning a degree in electronics. At 18 he enrolled in the Academy of Dramatic Art D'Amico in Rome and made his stage acting debut there. His credits included performances in contemporary Italian plays as well, as in Italian productions of William Shakespeare's plays \"Romeo and Juliet\" and \"A Midsummer's Night Dream\". In 1965 he made his television debut starring as David Copperfield in the TV miniseries made by RAI ,the Italian national TV company. He made his big-screen debut in Libido (1965), a Freudian psychological thriller. Since 1966 he has been in a successful collaboration with legendary Italian director Lina Wertmüller, who made several award-winning films with Giannini as a male lead. He appears as peasant Tonino who prepares to assassinate dictator Benito Mussolini in Liebe und Anarchie (1973), as a sailor in the irony-laden comedy Hingerissen von einem ungewöhnlichen Schicksal im azurblauen Meer im August (1974), and as a concentration-camp survivor in the Oscar-nominated Sieben Schönheiten (1975). He also starred as a Jewish musician arrested by the Nazis in Rainer Werner Fassbinder's masterpiece Lili Marleen (1981).\n\nGiannini also made a reputation for dubbing international stars in films released on the Italian market, such as Jack Nicholson, Al Pacino, Michael Douglas, Dustin Hoffman, Gérard Depardieu, and Ian McKellen, among others. He received a compliment from Stanley Kubrick for his dubbing of Nicholson in Shining (1980). Giannini's fluency in English and his mastery of dialects has brought him a number of supporting roles in Hollywood productions, such as Dem Himmel so nah (1995), Hannibal (2001), Darkness (2002), and Mann unter Feuer (2004), among many others. He appears as Rene Mathis in the 21st James Bond film Casino Royale (2006), and reprises the role in the sequel, James Bond 007: Ein Quantum Trost (2008).\n\nKim Rossi Stuart was born on October 31th, 1969 in Rome, Lazio, Italy.

Kim has 3 sisters, 2 of them actresses like him: Loretta Rossi Stuart and Valentina Rossi Stuart, the latter also stunt-woman. Ombretta is the third sister.\n\nKim left his parent's home at 14 (1983) and also left school to study theater and in 1986 began acting regularly, especially on TV productions, like Prinzessin Fantaghirò (1991) and for the cinema with a small role in Der Name der Rose (1986). However it was with Karate Warrior (1987) and Poliziotti - Das Ehrenwort eines Mafiosi (1995) that Kim reached popularity. After this commercial movie he began to act only in quality movies, like Ohne Haut (1994) where his role, a man with psychological problems, was appreciated by critics. Then he acted with the legendary director Michelangelo Antonioni in Jenseits der Wolken (1995), and in an international TV fiction Le Rouge et Le Noir (1997).\n\nIn the last years he came back to act in the theater with \"Re Lear\", a tragedy by William Shakespeare, and with the most important Italian actors like Turi Ferro in the opera \"Le visiteur\", a comedy by Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, from which it is derived Il visitatore (1997), still interpreted by Kim and Turi.\n\nOn November 26th, 2011, at the age of 42, Kim became a father: the actress Ilaria Spada, his girlfriend from just a few months before, gave birth to their son, a child called Ettore.

During WW2 he was sent to a German prison camp, but he managed to escape and hide in Venice. He debuted in films as an extra in Marionette (1939), then started working for the Italian department of \"Eagle Lion Films\" in Rome and joined a drama club, where he was discovered by director Luchino Visconti. In 1957 Visconti gave him the starring part in his Fyodor Dostoevsky adaptation Weiße Nächte (1957) and in 1958 he was fine as a little thief in Mario Monicelli's comedy Diebe haben's schwer (1958). But his real breakthrough came in 1960, when Federico Fellini cast him as an attractive, weary-eyed journalist of the Rome jet-set in Das süße Leben (1960); that film was the genesis of his \"Latin lover\" persona, which Mastroianni himself often denied by accepting parts of passive and sensitive men. He would again work with Fellini in several major films, like the exquisite Achteinhalb (1963) (as a movie director who finds himself at a point of crisis) and the touching Ginger und Fred (1986) (as an old entertainer who appears in a TV show). He also appeared as a tired novelist with marital problems in Michelangelo Antonioni's Die Nacht (1961), as an impotent young man in Mauro Bolognini's Bel Antonio (1960) , as an exiled prince in John Boorman's Leo, der Letzte (1970), as a traitor in Paolo and Vittorio Taviani's Allonsanfan (1974) and as a sensitive homosexual in love with a housewife in Ettore Scola's Ein besonderer Tag (1977). He was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor three times, for Scheidung auf italienisch (1961), Ein besonderer Tag (1977), and Schwarze Augen (1987).

He died of pancreatic cancer in 1996.\n\nValeria Golino is an Italian actress and film director.

Appearing on the stage, he finally found an entry into films at age 28 in 1950 with a featured role in the war comedy I cadetti di Guascogna (1950). He built up a solid comedy resume in primarily Neapolitan 50's features including La paura fa 90 (1951) (his first co-starring role), Café chantant (1953), I milanesi a Napoli (1954), La moglie è uguale per tutti (1955), Domenica è sempre domenica (1958), Le confident de ces dames (1959) and Tipi da spiaggia (1959).\n\nUgo became a middle-aged European star the following decade. Turning in a number of powerhouse character studies, he excelled as bon vivants, adulterous husbands and other suave gents in primarily farcical comedy and saucy, sardonic romps, particularly those of director/writer Marco Ferreri. He also demonstrated a remarkable range when it came to portraying world-weary protagonists in political drama or grim satire. For Ferreri alone, he appeared in the award-winning Die Bienenkönigin (1963), Controsesso (1964), Marcia nuziale (1966), Die Audienz (1972) and the masterful Das große Fressen (1973), among others.\n\nIn 1978, Tognazzi decided to take a chance, and play a character unlike anything he had done, (and, also, rarely done, for fear of being 'stereotyped'), and co-starred with the wonderful Michel Serrault in an image-shattering part in 1978. What he did was experience the most popular role of his career as one-half of an aging gay couple who operate a drag club. Ein Käfig voller Narren (1978) went on to spawn two sequels and an American remake (The Birdcage - Ein Paradies für schrille Vögel (1996) starring Robin Williams (in the Tognazzi role) and Nathan Lane (in the diva Serrault part).\n\nTognazzi won several acting honors over the course of his long career. He copped several European awards for his classic roles in I mostri (1963) (The Monsters), Ich habe sie gut gekannt (1965), Unmoralisch lebt man besser (1967) (also a rare foreign Golden Globe nomination), Bambolona - die große Puppe (1968), Il commissario Pepe (1969), Die Kalifin (1970) and Ente auf Orange (1975). He capped it off with the Cannes Film Festival award for his trenchant performance in Die Tragödie eines lächerlichen Mannes (1981), the tale of a near-bankrupt factory owner who attempts to use the kidnapping of his son (played by his real-life eldest son Ricky Tognazzi) to his financial advantage. Tognazzi was also the father of actor Gianmarco Tognazzi and director Maria Sole Tognazzi, and had another son, producer/writer Thomas Robsahm, via a relationship with actress Margrete Robsahm.\n\nIn the eighties, Tognazzi focused strongly on the theater and starred in such plays as Luigi Pirandello's \"Six Characters in Search of an Author\" (1986, directed by Jean-Pierre Vincent in Paris, Théâtre de l' Europe) and Molière's \"The Miser\" (1989, where he sparked a controversy in Italian government circles when he improvised lines about corruption in high places during his performance). Although he directed himself in a handful of his own often sexually explicit films, including Il fischio al naso (1967) and Sissignore (1968), Ugo's true brilliance shines in front of the camera and in the works of other famed European directors, notably Ferrari, Bernardo Bertolucci, Pietro Germi, Dino Risi and Mario Monicelli. He worked up until the end with incisive starring performances in Das Chaoten-Duo (1988), Bandellis Alibi (1988), Tolérance (1989) and La batalla de los Tres Reyes (1990) (The Battle of the Three Kings). In 1972, at age 50, Tognazzi wed actress Franca Bettoia, who survives him. He died of a brain hemorrhage in 1990, age 68."
