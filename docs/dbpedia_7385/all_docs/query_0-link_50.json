        "text": "Dialectics of Labour: Marx and his Relation to Hegel\n\nby C. J. Arthur\n\nfirst published, Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1986\n\nPART TWO: The Critique of Hegel\n\nChapter 7 – The Influence of the Phenomenology\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe fact that\n\nMarx hangs his criticism of Hegel largely on a passage from the last\n\nchapter of the Phenomenology warrants the inference that the main influence\n\nof the work on him is its dialectic in general. However, there is no\n\ndoubt that Marx could not have been so interested in it if he had only\n\nacquainted himself with the rather abstract formulations in the\n\nconclusion and the Preface. Clearly the way Hegel works through historical\n\nmaterial in the concrete to flesh out the dialectic of consciousness and\n\nself-consciousness must have impressed Marx.\n\nAccordingly, this chapter is\n\ndevoted to a discussion of some of the materials concerned. In\n\nrelation to this, there is first a myth to be refuted. [1]\n\nLordship and Bondage\n\nThere is a widely held view that Marx was profoundly influenced by\n\nthe master – servant (‘Herrschaft und Knechtschaft‘) dialectic in\n\nHegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit. This view was first popularized by\n\nJean-Paul Sartre, who refers in his Being and Nothingness (1943) to ‘the famous\n\n“Master Slave” relation which so profoundly influenced Marx’; Sartre\n\ndoes nor explain how he knows this. [2] Probably this remark reflects\n\nthe pervasive influence of Alexandre Kojève’s lectures on Hegel in the\n\n1930s. Kojève presents a reading of the Phenomenology that centralizes\n\nthe place of the master – servant dialectic in it, in a quasi-Marxist\n\ninterpretation. Kojève may have assumed that Marx himself read it in the\n\nsame way. However, it is one thing to read Marxism back into Hegel, it\n\nis another to generate it out of Hegel. Three years after Sartre we find\n\nJean Hyppolite again saying that the dialectic of domination and\n\nservitude is the best-known section of the Phenomenology because of ‘the\n\ninfluence it has had on the political and social philosophy of Hegel’s\n\nsuccessors, especially Marx’. [3]\n\nAs a matter of fact, despite the\n\nassertions of numerous commentators to the contrary, Sartre and Hyppolite did not attend Kojève’s lectures. The myth that they sat at the feet of\n\nthe ‘unknown superior’ is now well established. Thus Wilfred Desan says\n\nthat the audience included Sartre, Merleau-Ponty and Hyppolite; and,\n\nmore specifically, ‘Sartre learned to study Hegel in the classes of Kojève\n\njust before W.W.Il’; but he does not give any evidence for it. [4] Let\n\nus turn then to first-hand accounts. Kojève’s disciple Raymond\n\nQueneau, who was responsible for collecting and publishing Kojève’s lectures\n\nin 1947, has given a list of participants that does not include Sartre\n\nor Hyppolite. [5] As far as Hyppolite is concerned, we have the\n\nadditional testimony of Madame Hyppolite that he did not attend ‘for fear of\n\nbeing influenced’. [6]\n\nHowever that may be, by the time Sartre and\n\nHyppolite made their equations between Hegel and Marx, a crucial document\n\nof Kojève’s was already in the public domain. In the issue of Mesures for 14 January 1939 Kojève published a free translation, with\n\ninterpolated glosses, of the section of the Phenomenology entitled ‘Autonomy and\n\nDependence of Self Consciousness: Mastery and Servitude’. [7] Still more\n\ninteresting for our purposes is that Kojève includes as an epigraph\n\nthe following words of Marx: ‘Hegel . . . erfasst die Arbeit als das Wesen, als das sich bewährende Wesen des Menschen.’ (‘Hegel . . . grasps labour as the essence, as the self-confirming essence of man.’) No\n\nreference is given, but in fact this is quoted from Marx’s 1844 Manuscripts,\n\nwhich remained unpublished until the 1930s. Kojève, therefore, was one\n\nof the first to make a direct connection between this judgement of\n\nMarx’s on Hegel and the master servant dialectic in the Phenomenology.\n\nToday it is dogmatically asserted in numerous books that Marx was inspired\n\nby Hegel’s analysis of the labour of servitude. [8] This view is\n\nfalse. Here I will attempt to show that this is so in the light of the\n\naccount above of the real significance of Marx’s critical appropriation of the Phenomenology.\n\nIf we are to examine the influence of Hegel’s Phenomenology on Marx, the crucial text to consider has to be the 1844 Manuscripts. As we have seen, Marx praises Hegel there for having grasped man\n\nas the result of his own labour. Nearly all commentators, innocently\n\nassuming that material labour is meant here, turn to the Phenomenology and find that there is indeed a fascinating discussion in the ‘master –\n\nservant’ section of the significance of material labour, in and through\n\nwhich the servant ‘finds himself’. Furthermore, the fact that this\n\nlabour is seen by Hegel as actualized in the context of servitude leads\n\nsome commentators to make the more extravagant claim that in his theory\n\nof alienation Marx draws on this same section, Herbert Marcuse was\n\nprobably the first to do so; he says in his Reason and Revolution (1941) that Marx ‘described the “alienation” of labour in the terms of Hegel’s discussion of master and servant’. [9]\n\nThe only difficulty with these\n\npresuppositions of the secondary literature is that Marx never refers to\n\nthis section of the Phenomenology – never mind giving it any\n\nimportance! – when, in his 1844 Manuscripts, he embarks on a ‘critique of Hegel’s\n\ndialectic’. [10] He discusses the Phenomenology as a whole and draws\n\nattention to its last chapter especially; he singles out three other\n\nsections for praise; but none of them is on the master servant dialectic.\n\nThis should make us suspicious, therefore, of the claims made for the\n\n‘Herrschaft und Knechtschaft‘ section. (Incidentally, although it is\n\npopularly nominated the ‘master-slave’, the correct translation of\n\n‘Knecht‘ is servant’ or ‘bondsman’. That this choice of terminology is deliberate is seen when we find that in his 1825 Berlin lecture on Herrschaft\n\nund Knechtschaft Hegel draws a distinction between der Sklave and der\n\nKnecht[11])\n\nLet us now rehearse the dialectic of lordship and\n\nbondage. This section occurs early in the Phenomenology at the point where\n\nconsciousness is to turn into self-consciousness. Hegel believes that the\n\nself can become conscious of itself only in and through the mediation\n\nof another self-consciousness. The first stable relationship that\n\nemerges in Hegel’s dialectical development of this topic is that of lordship\n\nand bondage. The master is acknowledged as such by his servant, and he\n\nachieves immediate satisfaction of his desires through goods and\n\nservices provided by the servant’s labour. The dialectic moves forwards\n\nprecisely through the servant, however, because ‘through work . . . the\n\nbondsman becomes conscious of what he truly is’. Work forms and shapes the\n\nthing; and through this formative activity the consciousness of the\n\nservant now, in the work outside it, acquires ‘an element of permanence’;\n\nfor it comes to see in the independent being of the object ‘its own independence’.\n\n‘The shape does not become something other than himself\n\nthrough being made external to him’, says Hegel, ‘for it is precisely\n\nthis shape that is his pure being-for-self.’ The result of this\n\nrediscovery of himself is that, ‘precisely in labour’, whose meaning seemed so\n\nalien to him, the bondsman gains a sense of himself – ‘a mind of his\n\nown’ so to speak. [12] These terms are superficially comparable to Marx’s\n\nin that both Hegel and Marx see work not merely in its utilitarian\n\naspect but as a vehicle for self realization; thus they see the servant\n\nrather than the master as the locus of a more developed human existence.\n\nFundamental differences between\n\nMarx and Hegel become obvious when we\n\nnotice that, whereas Marx holds that only a change in the mode of\n\nproduction recovers for the worker his sense of self and its fulfilment, Hegel\n\nthinks that the educative effect of work, even within an exploitative\n\nrelation of production, is sufficient for the worker to manifest to\n\nhimself his own ‘meaning’ in his product. Furthermore, at this stage in\n\nthe phenomenological dialectic, as we shall see below, the condition of\n\n‘fear and service’ is stipulated as necessary to this end; that is, to\n\nthe servant’s becoming objective to himself.\n\nRemembering now the\n\ncrucial passage in Marx’s complex discussion of the Phenomenology, in which\n\nMarx praises Hegel for grasping the importance of labour: does such a\n\njudgement (as Kojève insinuates and so many later writers boldly assert)\n\nrest on Hegel’s discussion of the labour of servitude? The first thing\n\nthat should give us pause is that immediately after this praise Marx\n\nqualifies it by complaining that ‘the only labour Hegel knows and\n\nrecognizes is abstract mental labour’. The servant’s labour is clearly material, so this remark seems to show that not only has Marx not drawn on\n\nthat analysis, but he has actually forgotten about it and done Hegel an\n\ninjustice! [13]\n\nWhat Marx does refer us to is ‘the dialectic of\n\nnegativity as the moving and producing principle’. Spirit comes to know itself\n\nthrough producing itself, in the first instance as something alien\n\nstanding over against it. In the final chapter, as we have seen, the world\n\nof estrangement thus brought to life is overcome, or negated, in a\n\npeculiar way in that – as Hegel puts it – ‘self-consciousness has sublated\n\nthis alienation and objectivity . . . so that it is at home with itself\n\nin its otherness as such’. When Marx refers to the final result of the Phenomenology being ‘the dialectic of negativity as the moving and\n\nproducing principle’ it is to this entire labour of spirit in the Phenomenology that he refers. Of course, in Marx’s view, man produces himself\n\nthrough material labour. It would be a mistake, however, to assume\n\ntherefrom that he praises Hegel for what he says about material labour, such\n\nas that of the servant. When Marx says Hegel grasps labour as the\n\nessence he is talking not about what Hegel actually says about material\n\nlabour (hence the lack of reference to ‘Lordship and Bondage’) but about\n\nthe esoteric significance of the dialectic of negativity in spirit’s\n\nentire self-positing movement (hence Marx’s claim that the only labour\n\nHegel knows is spiritual labour). Marx sees in Hegel’s dialectic of\n\nnegativity the hypostatization of the abstract reflection in philosophy of the\n\nmaterial process whereby man produces himself through his own labour,\n\na process which (Marx concurs with Hegel) must pass through a stage of\n\nestrangement.\n\nNevertheless, Marx holds that Hegel’s discussion of the\n\nproblematics of alienation is embedded in speculative illusions, and\n\nbecause of this it is a ‘merely apparent criticism’, shading over into\n\nuncritical positivism. In this connection one must draw attention to the\n\nsophisticated use of quotation by Kojève in the above-mentioned\n\nepigraph to the effect that Hegel grasps labour as the essence. The passage\n\nfrom which Kojève quotes is as follows – with Kojève’s ‘quote’\n\nstressed:\n\nHegel adopts the standpoint of modern political economy. He grasps\n\nlabour as the essence, the self-confirming essence of man; he sees only the\n\npositive and not the negative side of labour. Labour is man’s coming\n\nto be for himself within alienation or as alienated man. [14]\n\nThis\n\npassage is not so much praise, as criticism, of Hegel. It is praise only in\n\na paradoxical sense. As we have seen, in adopting the standpoint of\n\nlabour, both Hegel and political economy achieve an understanding, in\n\ndifferent ways, of the genesis, not merely of wealth, but of human being\n\nitself. But, just because labour is identical with alienating activity,\n\nthe result is ‘man’s coming to be as alienated man’. Marx takes the critically adopted standpoint of labour, the standpoint of the critique of\n\nlabour as alienating; he projects the abolition of labour, its\n\ntransformation into free productive activity.\n\nAs we have seen, a crucial move\n\nHegel makes is to transform labour into spiritual activity; and hence\n\nto project the overcoming of alienation as a revolution in\n\nconsciousness, namely, spirit’s achievement of absolute knowledge of itself and all\n\nits works. It is necessary to locate the ‘master-slave’ dialectic\n\nwithin this perspective of spirit’s development of its self-awareness. As we\n\nhave already noted, and now stress, it is an early moment in the story\n\nof spirit’s recovery of itself. It is much less ‘concrete’ (in Hegel’s\n\nterms) than cultural achievements such as law, art, religion and\n\nphilosophy. None the less, it is located at a turning point of some\n\nimportance, for the problem Hegel faces is how to develop dialectically self-consciousness out of the mere consciousness of external objects.\n\nConsciousness cannot grasp itself in things. It must distinguish itself\n\nabsolutely from them through their radical negation. The consumption of\n\nobjects of desire accomplishes this in an evanescent way. To risk one’s life\n\nin forcing another consciousness to grant one recognition represents a\n\nmore promising mediation. But the master finds himself frustrated in\n\nreducing the vanquished to his servant, his thing. Self-consciousness can\n\nonly gain proper recognition through mutual respect such as that\n\naccorded to individuals constituted in the legal and ethical relations Hegel\n\ndevelops later in the story. At this stage Hegel is not really\n\ndiscussing individuality, and a fortiori, not social relationships. (Hence\n\nthere is no discussion of master – master or slave – slave relationships.)\n\nWe are concerned here\n\nwith the most primitive level of\n\nself-consciousness, that of self-consciousness in general as against consciousness of\n\nobjects.\n\nIn a neat reversal, the dialectic advances now through the\n\ndespised servant. As we have seen, he ‘finds himself’ through the negating\n\naction of work on things. Hegel defines work as ‘desire held in check’;\n\nthat is to say, it involves putting a distance between the immediate\n\nimpulses of self-will and formative activity grounded in objective\n\nprinciples. If you like, it is really the master who is a slave because his\n\nobject is the ‘unalloyed feeling of self-satisfaction’: that is to say,\n\nhe is a slave to his appetites; but his satisfactions are ‘only\n\nfleeting’, lacking the permanence of objectivity. The servant, on the other\n\nhand, in the work he creates, achieves mastery of his craft; it is he who\n\nrises to the level of universal human reason. But Hegel introduces the\n\nnotion that ‘fear and service’ are necessary to induce the check to\n\ndesire and to ensure that consciousness rises above self-centred goals to\n\nthe freedom that comes from a consciousness of the ‘universal power’\n\nof human creative activity. [15] Indeed, it is worth noting that in\n\nHegel’s Encyclopaedia ‘Phenomenology’ no mention is made of the worker\n\nfinding himself in his product; the emphasis in the outcome of the\n\n‘master-slave’ there is on ‘community of need’ and the idea that ‘fear of the\n\nlord is the beginning of wisdom’. [16] By contrast, in the Phenomenology Hegel says that, ‘albeit fear of the lord is the beginning of wisdom,\n\nconsciousness is not therein aware of being self-existent’. But\n\n‘through labour it comes to itself’. However, it turns out that both are\n\nnecessary: ‘for the reflection of self into self the two moments, fear and\n\nservice in general, as also that of formative activity, are necessary . . .’ [17]\n\nThe real point in all this is that it brings about an advance\n\nto self-consciousness. Strictly speaking, it is not the material achievement that is important to provide a basis for Hegelian\n\nself-consciousness, but rather the consciousness of the power of labour to transform\n\nthings. The servant becomes aware in this of the power of thought, of\n\nuniversal concepts. This does not have much in common with Marx’s\n\ninterest in the realization of an objective being in forming the material\n\nworld, but it is of a piece with the project of the Phenomenology as a\n\nwhole. [18] As it is a spiritual odyssey it is quite wrong to place\n\nspecial stress on this moment of material labour (as is the case with the\n\noverly ‘Marxist’ readings of Marcuse and Kojève), for its importance lies\n\nnot in the material result but in the spiritual one. Only if one\n\naccepts this can one fail to be surprised when the next twist of the\n\nphenomenological dialectic brings us to the pure universality of thought in the\n\nattitudes Hegel identifies with Stoicism and Scepticism. The split\n\nbetween the lord’s satisfaction in his autonomy and the negatively\n\nuniversal power developed on the servant’s side is re-worked at this new\n\nlevel.\n\nDesire and work are found wanting from the point of view of free\n\nself-consciousness; they fail to effect adequately the negation of\n\notherness. The self’s negating power cannot be enjoyed by the servant in the\n\nproduct, but only in itself, the power of consciousness working within\n\nitself. For the servant is not independent on his own account in the\n\nobjective world, since he is dominated by the fear of the lord and\n\nsubjected to his desires. Paradoxically, Hegel relies on just these\n\n‘negations’ to make an advance, claiming that without this complete repression\n\nand fear consciousness would remain bogged down in particularity and\n\nservitude, that consciousness of freedom would be mere wilfulness and\n\nobstinacy. Consciousness wins its freedom when its power and knowledge are\n\nredirected inwards, when it deals with its own thought material. Now\n\nconsciousness says to itself: ‘In thinking I am free, because I am not in\n\nanother, but remain simply and solely in communion with myself.’ [19] This ‘freedom’ of inner life is compatible with any social position; as\n\nHegel says: ‘Whether on the throne or in chains . . . its aim is to be\n\nfree.’ [20] (It will be recalled that two prominent Stoics were the\n\nemperor Marcus Aurelius and the Slave Epictetus.)\n\nDoes Marx, as Marcuse\n\nand others claim, follow in his theory of alienation the terms of\n\nHegel’s master – servant dialectic? We have already said enough to cast doubt\n\non this. It would certainly be strange, as well, to refer to this\n\nsection to illustrate the claim that Hegel equates material labour with\n\nalienation, because here labour is a recuperating moment in spirit’s drive\n\nto realize its freedom in the face of the blankness of objectivity.\n\nThe peculiar thing about Hegel’s treatment is that, as we have seen, in\n\nso far as his thematization of the servant’s labour touches on the\n\nalienation involved in such activity, it is seen, on the one hand, as still sufficiently fulfilling for the worker to identify himself in it, and,\n\non the other hand, even as necessary to impel his consciousness to the\n\nlevel of absolute negativity.\n\nThese points are illustrated if we ask\n\nthe question: does Hegel actually mention alienation in this section?\n\nThere are two terms to consider. The term ‘Entfremdung‘ does not occur;\n\nthe nearest Hegel comes to it is when he says that the labour seems to\n\nhave only ‘fremder Sinn‘; this sentence, however, is precisely that in\n\nwhich the servant is said to discover himself in labour in spite of the\n\nfact that it is orientated to the master’s desire. The term\n\n‘Entäusserung‘ does not occur either at this point in the Phenomenology. But Hegel\n\ndoes use it in his Encyclopaedia when he thematizes the master – servant\n\nrelationship. Here the labour-process is said to overcome ‘self-will’\n\nand ‘the inner immediacy of desire’; this in turn is identified as\n\n‘Entäusserung‘ (translated by Wallace as ‘divestment of self’ and by Petty\n\nas ‘privation’). The point, nevertheless, is that this is treated\n\npositively; it\n\nmakes possible ‘the beginning of wisdom’, the transition to\n\n‘universal self-consciousness’. [21] We are very far from Marx now.\n\nOur\n\nconclusion must be that Marx did not draw on Hegel’s analysis of the\n\nlabour of servitude in his theory of alienation. He fails to mention it\n\nfor the simple reason that it did not strike him as important.\n\nIt\n\nremains to be noted that he does not cite this section in any other\n\nwritings, early or late. What we do find in a few places are echoes of its\n\nterms. For example, in 1844 itself there is a somewhat obscure passage in\n\nhis notes on James Mill. [22] However, let us close this section with\n\nan interesting quotation from Marx’s Capital manuscripts.\n\nHence the\n\nrule of the capitalist over the worker is the rule of things over man, of\n\ndead labour over the living, of the product over the producer . . .\n\nThus at the level of material production, of the life-process in the realm\n\nof the social – for that is what the process of production is – we find\n\nthe same situation that we find in religion at the ideological level,\n\nnamely the inversion of subject and object. Viewed historically this\n\ninversion is the indispensable transition without which wealth as such,\n\ni.e. the relentless productive force of social labour, which alone can\n\nform the material base of a free human society, could not possibly be\n\ncreated at the expense of the majority . . . What we are confronted by\n\nhere is the alienation [Entfremdung] of man from his own labour. To that\n\nextent the worker stands on a higher plane than the capitalist from the\n\noutset, since the latter has his roots in the process of alienation and\n\nfinds absolute satisfaction in it whereas right from the start the\n\nworker is a victim who confronts it as a rebel and experiences it as a\n\nprocess of enslavement. [23]\n\n‘The Critical Elements’\n\nMarx finds that,\n\nthough in mystified form, Hegel tackles the problem of estrangement in\n\nhis Phenomenology: ‘even though man appears only as spirit, their lie\n\nconcealed in it all the elements of criticism, already prepared and elaborated in a manner often rising far above the Hegelian standpoint’. What\n\nelements does Marx have in mind? As we have just seen, ‘lordship and\n\nbondage’ is not mentioned. In fact, he cites three sections: ‘the unhappy\n\nconsciousness’, ‘the honest consciousness’ and ‘the struggle of noble\n\nand base consciousness’. According to Marx, these separate sections\n\ncontain ‘the critical elements’ of whole spheres of estrangement such as\n\n‘religion, the state, civil life, etc.’ [24] Unfortunately he gives us\n\nno analysis of these sections. These phenomenological figures will be\n\ntouched on now in so far as they relate to the problem of alienated\n\nlabour.\n\nCitation of the ‘unhappy consciousness’ explains Marx’s reference\n\nto the sphere of religion because the most obvious source for Hegel’s\n\nsubject matter here is traditional forms of religious experience. Hegel\n\nmay well have intended to exempt Lutheranism from this category but\n\nMarx would obviously include it too. Findlay even suggests that it applies\n\nbest to Kierkegaard’s morbid Protestant Christianity. [25] The\n\n‘unhappy consciousness’ finds itself desiring and working but in work and\n\nenjoyment it feels itself lost in superficiality; it does not identify\n\nitself in the world but supposes itself to belong to an unreachable beyond.\n\nAlthough it cannot help getting satisfaction from its work, it\n\nattributes every success to God and endeavours to play down earthly life in\n\norder to get closer to the absolute it supposes to lie beyond it. [26] Hegel’s critique relies on the view that activity, especially work, is\n\nnecessary to self-realization; and that self-consciousness must find its\n\nsatisfaction there and not rely on priestly mediators to direct it\n\ntowards salvation.\n\nThe ‘honest consciousness’ certainly seeks satisfaction\n\nin work, in keeping busy so to speak; but this figure of consciousness\n\nis presented as engaged on his enterprises as an individual. It turns\n\nup in a section with the curious title ‘The spiritual animal kingdom’. [27] This seems to be Hegel’s attempt to characterize a form of\n\nself-consciousness divorced from relations of inter-subjectivity. He deals\n\nhere with an individuality that takes itself to be self-sufficient, single\n\nand specific. Hegel starts with some interesting remarks on the\n\nsignificance of activity. He argues that ‘consciousness must act merely in\n\norder that what it is in itself may become explicit for it’; in other\n\nwords, ‘an individual cannot know what he [really] is until he has made\n\nhimself a reality through action’. [28] The ‘work done’ (das Werk)\n\nexpresses the individual’s original nature. Marx would certainly find this\n\ncongruent with his own ontology, organized as it is around productive\n\nactivity. However, Hegel’s thematization of action soon slips towards\n\nidealism. This is not because he focuses on certain particular forms of\n\nactivity. The work carried out could be material/physical or\n\nintellectual. It is rather a question of the meaning he finds in it. At this point\n\nit is valuable to cite Löwith’s opinion: for Hegel, he says, ‘work is\n\nnot a particular economic activity, to be contrasted, say, to leisure or\n\nplay, but the basic way in which man produces his life, thereby giving\n\nform to the world . . . Work is neither physical nor intellectual in a\n\nparticular sense, but spiritual in the absolute ontological sense’ [29]\n\nHow, in the section under consideration, does Hegel spiritualize the\n\nwork? He argues that consciousness becomes aware that it need not\n\nidentify itself with any particular work, that it is universal because it\n\nis ‘absolute\n\nnegativity’ in so far as it withdraws itself from any determinate or particular work’. [30] In so far as work takes its place as a\n\ndeterminate particular in the world it passes into an ‘alien reality’.\n\nFor example, the interest of other individuals in my work is something\n\nquite different from the work’s original interest. Hegel does not give\n\nexamples here, but one might recall the verdict of the market place on\n\nnew commodities, or the way literary and artistic products are\n\nappropriated by audiences in ways quite unexpected by their authors. (Indeed\n\none might recall that Hegel’s own works have been read in many different\n\nways!) Even in its own terms, whether the work is a success depends on\n\n‘fortune’, the selection of appropriate means, and so on. Consciousness\n\ntherefore takes an ‘idealistic’ attitude to work. The negation of the\n\nwork is itself negated, and consciousness takes the true reality to be\n\nsolely its own negativity. ‘In this way then’, says Hegel,\n\n‘consciousness is reflected out of its perishable work into itself, and preserves\n\nits concept and its certainty of what objectively exists and endures in\n\nthe face of the experience of the contingency of action.’ [31]\n\nThis\n\nform of consciousness, then, busies itself with ‘the matter in hand’\n\n(‘die Sache selbst‘) in abstraction from its moments – end, means and\n\nobject. It is true that ‘they all have this “matter in hand” as their\n\nessence’, Hegel allows, ‘but only in such a way that it, being their abstract universal, can be found in each of them, and can be a predicate of\n\nthem’. [32]\n\nIt is at this point that Hegel identifies the ‘honest\n\nconsciousness’. ‘Consciousness is called honest‘, he says, ‘when it has . . .\n\nattained the idealism which “the matter in hand” expresses . . .’. [33] Hegel emphasizes that this engagement is independent of results. If it\n\ndoes not succeed in its action it has at least willed it, something was taken in hand. If everything goes wrong it still finds satisfaction\n\n‘just like naughty boys who enjoy themselves when they get their ears\n\nboxed because they are the cause of its being done’. [34] Hegel points\n\nout that it is not even necessary to do anything at all: if ‘it should be an\n\nevent of historical importance which does not really concern him, he\n\nmakes it likewise his own; and an interest for which he has done nothing\n\nis, in his own eyes, a party interest which he has favoured or\n\nopposed, and even combated or supported’. [35] One recalls here the pater\n\nfamilias who leaves trivial matters, like the choice of schooling for the\n\nchildren, to his wife; while he concerns himself with important matters\n\nsuch as whether war should be declared on Russia.\n\nHegel now enters\n\ninto one of his dialectical reversals. This man is not as honest as he\n\nseems. Although he keeps busy he is not really in earnest about anything,\n\nonly about his own status in the matter. Others soon realize the\n\ndissimulation involved. For example, should they point out that they\n\nthemselves have already accomplished the matter, or offer their help, the\n\nresult is a fit of pique on the part of the consciousness, whose interest\n\nis really in its own action. The others are in turn put out by his\n\nrejection, because they were only interested in their own self-satisfaction\n\ntoo. Hegel says: ‘a consciousness that opens up a new field soon learns\n\nthat others hurry along like flies to freshly poured out milk, and\n\nwant to busy themselves with it . . . ‘ [36]\n\nIn this whole discussion one\n\nis irresistibly reminded of the self-centredness and asocial sociality\n\nof bourgeois life. Although Hegel’s discussion is quite general, most\n\ncommentators assume that he has particularly in mind the intellectuals\n\nof his day, academics, specialists and artists of various kinds. [37] Obviously Marx found it amusing.\n\nMore seriously, however, what would\n\nMarx make of the final outcome? Consciousness acquires the concept of a\n\ncommon ‘matter in hand’, a work which is the concern of all and each,\n\nand in which the particularity of the individuals is dissolved. Thereby\n\nthe ‘matter in hand’, Hegel argues, ‘no longer has the character of a\n\npredicate, and loses the character of lifeless, abstract universality’. [38] It is a universal shared by all, a spiritual essence, ethical\n\nconsciousness.\n\nIn trying to look at this whole dialectic from Marx’s point\n\nof view, let us remember the general verdict: we have here ‘all the\n\nelements of criticism’ – ‘but still in estranged form’.\n\nClearly Marx\n\nwould agree with two points here: that human work has a universal\n\ncharacter, and that bourgeois individualism needs to be transcended. Less clear\n\nis why Hegel’s discussion is objectionable. Recall the following\n\npassage from Marx’s critique:\n\nThe rich, living, sensuous, concrete activity\n\nof self-objectification is therefore reduced to its mere abstraction, absolute negativity – an abstraction which is again fixed as such and\n\nconsidered as an independent activity – as sheer activity. Because this\n\nso-called negativity is nothing but the abstract, empty form of that\n\nreal living act, its content can in consequence be merely a formal content\n\nproduced by abstraction from all content. [39]\n\nThis seems very\n\npertinent to the idea of absolute negativity Hegel evolves at the beginning\n\nof this discussion. Instead of the universality of activity being\n\ncelebrated in the wealth of its content, the content vanishes in the purity\n\nof absolute negativity. But did not Hegel himself find wanting such\n\nabstract universality? Yes and no. The concept of ‘absolute negativity’\n\nrepresents a real gain in the constitution of spirit, as is clear from its\n\nretention in the overview given in Hegel’s ‘Preface’. The problem at\n\nthis stage of the phenomenological dialectic is that it is constituted\n\nin\n\nopposition to the real life of the individual subject. There is an\n\n‘antithesis of doing and being’. The solution arrived at is to make the universal itself the real individual, which makes itself identical with\n\nthe entire content. The emphasis here, as in the rest of the story,\n\nprioritizes logical forms over real content. [40]\n\nThe third section mentioned by Marx, ‘the struggle of noble and base consciousness’, is part of\n\nan important stage of spirit’s development, namely, ‘self-estranged\n\nspirit’ (‘Der sich entfremdete Geist‘). The historical allusions become\n\nparticularly clear here; the material draws on the world of eighteenth\n\ncentury France up to, and including, the revolution. We are not therefore\n\ndealing with absolute spirit and the total process of its recovery of\n\nitself from alienation, but with a finite stage of its development. It\n\ndeals with the individual and his alienation from society. We are at a\n\nricher, more concrete, level of development of consciousness than in the\n\nprevious stages considered, in that the self knows the substance of\n\nsocial life as its spiritual essence, but society also faces the\n\nindividual as an ‘alien reality . . . in which it does not recognize itself’.\n\nThe individual and its world are estranged from each other. Even though\n\nthe individual knows that it belongs in that world and must find its\n\nplace there, to begin with it finds social institutions face it simply as\n\nobjectively given realities to which it must conform. It achieves\n\nsomething within its world only in alienating itself from itself, in\n\nleaving behind its natural self and moulding itself to these objective\n\nrequirements. This process of mediating the extremes (nature and society) is\n\n‘Bildung‘ – perhaps here to be translated as ‘acculturation’. Hegel\n\nsays: ‘it is therefore through culture [Bildung] that the individual\n\nacquires standing and actuality’. In observing this development, says Hegel,\n\nwe will see ‘the estrangement estrange itself and, through this,\n\nreturn into its concept’. [41]\n\nThis second alienation needs explaining.\n\nThe idea is symptomatic of Hegel’s dialectic in general. Given a totality\n\nwithin which two moments stand in an antagonistic opposition, this can\n\nexist only through a mediating movement. If the estranged elements are\n\nnot transformed and brought into harmony, the mediating movement\n\nitself must appear as an alienation. The original estrangement is sublated\n\nin a second alienation. Earlier we discussed the case of labour: given\n\nthe estrangement of labour-power from its object, any reunification\n\nunder the aegis of wage-labour is alienating in itself and reproduces the\n\nwhole system of estrangement. Here, in Hegel, the self alienates itself\n\nfrom its original nature in cultivating social skills and acquiring\n\npower in society. In this way the original subject-object split is\n\novercome, but within estrangement.\n\nRousseau’s critique of his times rested in\n\njust such a diagnosis, namely that natural and civilized man were at\n\nodds. Even in his positive prescription we find a second alienation\n\nsolution. Lacking the political virtues of the ever pre-given unity of the\n\nGreek polis, and thus beginning with ‘natural’ individuals, unity is to\n\nbe established politically in ‘the general will’ through ‘the total\n\nalienation of each associate … to the whole community’. Moreover,\n\nRousseau stresses the fact that this involves taking away man’s ‘natural\n\nresources’ and providing ‘new ones alien to him, and incapable of being\n\nmade use of without the help of other men’. [42]\n\nReturning now to Hegel,\n\nthe social order is presented as structured in terms of state power\n\nand wealth. It is in considering the possible attitudes of\n\nself-consciousness to these that the ‘noble’, and ‘base’, consciousness appear. The\n\nconsciousness that takes a positive attitude towards each sphere is\n\ncalled noble. It respects public authority and is grateful for its\n\nenjoyment of wealth. The consciousness that adopts a negative relation to them\n\nis base. It regards sovereign power as a fetter and it obeys only with\n\na secret malice, always on the point of revolt. It loves wealth but,\n\nconscious of its temporary and contingent enjoyment, suspects it at the\n\nsame time. There are fairly obvious allusions in Hegel’s discussion to\n\nthe class struggles between the nobility and the third estate.\n\nIn a way\n\nsimilar to the master-servant dialectic, Hegel then develops each side\n\ninto its other. The noble consciousness comes to see in the state and\n\nwealth the power of an alien reality on which it depends. The base\n\nconsciousness learns to affirm itself even in its negative relation to\n\nthem.\n\nThe dialectic advances next through the cultivated consciousness\n\nthat ‘sees through’ all this. It knows everything to be self-alienated,\n\nand it adopts a detached and ironical attitude to social reality. Hegel\n\nsays that ‘the vanity of all things is its own vanity, it is itself vain; it is the self-centred self that knows, not only how to pass\n\njudgement on and chatter about everything, but how to give witty expression to\n\nthe contradiction that is present in the solid elements of the actual world’. It seeks power and wealth while distancing itself from them in\n\nits consciousness. Aware of the self-disruptive nature of all\n\nrelationships it achieves pure self-identity ‘as self-consciousness in revolt’. [43]\n\nIt is clear that Marx was impressed by this description of the\n\nestrangement of individuals in the social institutions they themselves\n\nsustain in their activity: a culture of ‘universal inversion and\n\nestrangement’, as Hegel puts it. [44] State power and wealth appear as alien\n\npowers, even ‘selves’, standing over against the individuals.\n\nAt the same\n\ntime, the general criticism Marx brings against Hegel’s reduction of\n\nsocial forms to forms of consciousness applies with particular force\n\nhere. Indeed, the following comment of Marx’s must have been based on this\n\nsection: ‘when wealth, state power, etc., are understood by Hegel as\n\nentities estranged from the human being, this only happens in their form\n\nas thoughts.’ [45]\n\nSince this sort of criticism was dealt with in the\n\nprevious chapter it will not be further laboured here. (The reader is\n\nalso referred to Richard Norman’s commentary where the application of\n\nMarx’s criticism to this material is discussed with subtlety and clarity. [46]) Instead, let us pick up the reference in Hegel’s discussion to\n\n‘the self-consciousness which rebels against this rejection of itself’\n\n(Empörung = ‘rebellion’). [47] It will be recalled that in the passage\n\nfrom the Capital materials quoted earlier in connection with the\n\nmaster-servant dialectic, Marx also spoke of rebellion. But what is striking\n\nabout Hegel’s master-servant dialectic is the lack of any rebellion on\n\nthe part of the servant. The most one can say is, with Richard Kroner,\n\n‘perhaps young Marx, reading this, found the germ of his future\n\nprogramme’; he explains that ‘in any case, foreshadowed in these words [“mind\n\nof its own”] is the pattern for a labour movement which was to make the\n\nproletarian conscious of his existence and to grant him the knowledge\n\nof having a “mind of his own”.’ [48]\n\nIn Hegel’s text the most one can\n\nfind is a reference to mere obstinacy. Gadamer comments: ‘obstinacy is\n\nonly thought to confirm freedom and is, in fact, a form of rebellious\n\ndependency.’ [49] In fact, to speak here of rebelliousness is already\n\ngoing too far. None the less, there is an interesting idea here. Hegel\n\nclearly distinguishes the exercise of freedom from undisciplined\n\nwilfulness. In a way, Marx could agree. Simple Luddism is not in itself\n\nrevolutionary; but he believes the proletariat potentially embodies universal\n\nemancipation, not a merely partial standpoint. If one denies, as Hegel\n\ndoes, the historical supersession of bourgeois society, then of course\n\nthe proletariat’s rebelliousness is mere particularism.\n\nHowever, in\n\nthe dialectic of noble and base consciousness, Hegel explicitly speaks of\n\nrebelliousness. Therefore, if one is looking for a place where Hegel\n\ngives hints to Marx on rebellion it is here and not in the\n\nmaster-servant dialectic. As a matter of fact, Marx explicitly acknowledges this\n\nwhen composing The Holy Family later in 1844. Here is the passage:\n\nThe\n\npropertied class and the class of the proletariat present the same human\n\nself-estrangement. But the former class feels at ease and strengthened\n\nin this self-estrangement, it recognizes estrangement as its own power and has in it the semblance of a human existence. The latter feels\n\nannihilated in estrangement; it sees in it its own powerlessness and the\n\nreality of an inhuman existence. It is, to use an expression of Hegel’s,\n\nin its abasement the indignation {Empörung} at that abasement . . . [50]\n\nIt is possible, however, that Marx may not have had the Phenomenology in mind so much as the Philosophy of Right. [51] In the 1833 edition\n\nGans intercalated material from Hegel’s lectures on the subject. One\n\nreads there: ‘a rabble is created only when there is joined to poverty a\n\ndisposition of mind, an inner indignation [Empörung] against the rich,\n\nagainst society, against the government, etc.’. [52]\n\nAnother\n\ninteresting point about the Philosophy of Right is that this idea of der Pöbel (translated by Knox as ‘rabble’), a mass of rebellious paupers with no\n\nstake in the existing order, has been thought to be a source for Marx’s\n\nconception of the modern proletariat, as he first defines it as class\n\nin civil society but not of civil society. [53] Another source was\n\nLorenz von Stein’s book on French communism. [54]\n\nTo conclude these remarks\n\nabout the influence of Hegel on Marx, let us return to the\n\ncomprehending consciousness of absolute knowledge. It is interesting to notice\n\nthat Marx himself occasionally echoes the Phenomenology when he treats the\n\nstandpoint of the communist movement as such a comprehending\n\nconsciousness. In one place he states that the genesis of communism is rooted in\n\n‘the entire movement of history’ and, therefore, it is ‘for its\n\nthinking consciousness the comprehended and known process of its becoming.’ [55] This seems to amount to the same claim Hegel makes for absolute\n\nknowledge when he says that it is ‘comprehended history’. [56]\n\nNone the\n\nless, in Marx the objective dialectic of supersession is dominant. The\n\ncommunist movement does not simply know itself to be ‘the riddle of\n\nhistory solved’, but will actually abolish private property through a\n\nrevolutionary ‘negation of the negation’. In Hegel, on the contrary, the\n\nshadowy status of absolute knowledge, as we noted earlier, leads some to\n\nidentify it with Hegel’s own achievement. Marx’s view of this appears\n\nin The Holy Family in the following passage:\n\nAlready in Hegel the\n\nabsolute spirit of history has its material in the mass and finds its\n\nappropriate expression only in philosophy. The philosopher, however, is only\n\nthe organ through which the maker of history, the absolute spirit,\n\narrives at self-consciousness retrospectively after the movement has ended.\n\nThe participation of the philosopher in history is reduced to this\n\nretrospective consciousness, for the real movement is accomplished by the\n\nabsolute spirit unconsciously. Hence the philosopher appears on the\n\nscene post festum. [57]\n\nThis is from a polemic of Marx against the Young\n\nHegelian Bruno Bauer. Bauer ‘overcomes Hegel’s half-heartedness’; he\n\n‘consciously plays the part of world spirit‘ in opposition to the\n\nmasses, says Marx. Doubtless Marx takes the possibility of a personal\n\nidentification of the philosopher with absolute knowledge to be already\n\nimplicit in Hegel’s position.\n\nEven if one insists on the objectivism of\n\nHegel’s unification of subject and substance, Dunayevskaya’s verdict still\n\nhas force: ‘because Hegel could not conceive the masses as “subject”\n\ncreating the new society, the Hegelian philosophy – though it had\n\nreplaced the viewing of things as “things in themselves”, as dead impenetrable\n\nmatter – was compelled to return to Kant’s idea of an external unifier\n\nof opposites.’ She concludes ‘Hegel had destroyed all dogmatism except\n\nthe dogmatism of “the backwardness of the masses”.’ [58]\n\nSummary"
