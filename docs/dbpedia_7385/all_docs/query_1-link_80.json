Also, it is an example of how American artists of the 1980s could reintroduce the human figure in their work after the wide success of Conceptualism and Minimalism, thus establishing a dialogue with the more distant tradition of the 1950s Abstract Expressionism Despite ‘’unstudied’’ appearance of his work, Basquiat very purposefully and skillfully brought together in his art a host of disparate traditions, styles and practices in order to create a unique kind of visual collage, one deriving, partly, from his urban origins, and in another a more distant, African-Caribbean heritage.

Her father fed her intellectual side, providing her with many works of literature and encouraging her to read and write from an early age. Beauvoir was a deeply religious child as a result of her education and her mother 's training; however, at the age of 14 she had a crisis of faith and decided that there was definitely no God.1 This followed the end of WW\n\nSimone De Beauvoir: The Ambiguity Of Human Life\n\n1147 Words | 5 Pages\n\nIn the first place , Simone de Beauvoir describes ambiguity (human ways of thinking about life) through the following categories: nihilism, cynicism, humorism, seriousness and adventurism. In the light of “ existentialism” de Beauvoir makes an implication that there is no difference between philosophy and life. In like manner, she's also aware there are wrong turns that can be taken through the journey of questioning one’s own life. For instance,one way to face ambiguity of human life is “nihilism” this can be described as the drawing for obliviousness at the same time turning everything into an objection, lacking importance or significance as well as the exclusion of all values.

Throughout the essay i shall refer to the relationship between the Individual and the Other, this is simply to mean the relationship found between the ‘I’ and the other humans they interact with who have questionable similarity to the ‘I’. Our relationship to Others is a significant area of discussion because it opens the problem of Other Minds, which entails the idea that I, as an individual, cannot verify that any other individual I interact with is conscious in the same way I am.

The beginning of his life was filled with misfortunes, such as the death of his mother which was quickly followed by a distraught and self-sabotaging attitude which his father adopted. This led to his father’s involvement in illegal behaviors and the subsequent abandonment of Rousseau. His mother’s death was the catalyst for his journey to meet multiple women who would later affect his life greatly. The Influence of Miss Lamberciers, Madame Basile, Countess de Vercellis, and Madam de Warens on the impressionable adolescent mind of Rousseau led to the positive cultivation of self-discovery and the creation of new experiences, as well as the development of inappropriate sexual desires and attachments towards women.\n\nJean-Paul Sartre's Existence Precedes Essence\n\n911 Words | 4 Pages\n\nThe argument Jean-Paul Sartre, a French philosopher, presents on existentialism helps to prove the foundation which is “existence precedes essence”. Existentialism is normally understood as an ideology that involves evaluating existence itself and the way humans find themselves existing currently in the world. For the phrase existence precedes essence, existence’s etymology is exsistere or to stand out while the term Essence means “being” or “to be” therefore the fundamental of existentialism, literally means to stand out comes before being. This can be taken into many different ideas such as individuals having to take responsibility for their own actions and that in Sartre’s case the individual is the sole judge of his or her own actions. According to him, “men is condemned to be free,” therefore “the destiny of man is placed within himself.”\n\nBeauvoir The Married Woman\n\n773 Words | 4 Pages\n\nWashing, ironing, sweeping, ferreting out the rolls of lint from under wardrobes—all this halting of decay is also the denial of life; for time simultaneously creates and destroys, and only its negative aspect concerns the housekeeper” (Beauvoir 380). \"The Married Woman\" is a chapter in Simone de Beauvoir’s book, The Second Sex, which demonstrates her negative thoughts about marriage and the overall treatment of a married woman. I agree with Beauvoir’s argument concerning the inequalities between spouses and the exaggeration of house work because of the time the book was written. In 1950, women’s roles were greatly changed because the men came back from war and took their jobs back."
