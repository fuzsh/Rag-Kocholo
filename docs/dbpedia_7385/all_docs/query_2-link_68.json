        "text": "FATOS TARIFA is a former Albanian ambassador to\n\nthe United States and a Visiting Professor at Eastern\n\nMichigan University. He is the author, most recently,\n\nof Europe Adrift on the Wine-Dark Sea (2007).\n\nIn the midst of intense anti-American sentiments\n\nprevailing in France and throughout\n\nmuch of Europe early in 2006, a book by\n\nBernard-Henri Lévy, American Vertigo (Random\n\nHouse), made it to bookstores all across\n\nthe United States. It was apparently directed\n\nagainst the French and European anti-Americanism\n\nthat has become rampant since the\n\n2003 invasion of Iraq. Lévy, who visited\n\nAmerica in 2004, wrote his book to assess\n\n“the state of health of American democracy”\n\n1 one hundred seventy-three years after\n\nAlexis de Tocqueville published his seminal\n\nwork Democracy in America. To most Americans,\n\nLévy is a totally unknown author. His\n\nname, however, is not quite unknown to\n\nthose familiar with French intellectual life of\n\nthe past three decades.\n\nLévy is a French quondam philosopher, a\n\nwealthy bon vivant, bohemian intellectual,\n\nwho, with his movie-star lifestyle, his picture\n\nfrequently featured on the cover of the Paris\n\nMatch magazine, and his celebrity friends the\n\nlate Yves Saint-Laurent, Alain Delon, and\n\nSalman Rushdie, has long become a fixture\n\nof the continental gossip rags. A man not\n\nparticularly encumbered by modesty, Lévy\n\nis anecdotally known for his words “God is\n\ndead, but my hair is perfect.” American Vertigo,\n\nas the author himself admits, is “not a\n\nbook of philosophy,” but “it’s journalism, it\n\nis literature, it is funny,” it is also, still in his\n\nwords, “un geste philosophique.” It is precisely\n\nthis “philosophical gesture” in Lévy’s most\n\nrecent book that recaptured my sociological\n\nimagination, to use C. Wright Mills’s language,\n\nwhich, by grasping history and biography\n\nand the relationship between the two\n\nwithin French society, evoked a glitzy but\n\notherwise short-lived episode in France’s\n\nintellectual history of the mid-1970s that\n\ncame to be known as the Nouvelle Philosophie\n\n(New Philosophy). The self-announced antianti-\n\nAmerican author of American Vertigo,\n\nBernard-Henri Lévy, was its founder and the\n\nfigurehead of an assemblage of a dozen or so\n\nyoung intellectuals in Paris, whose “new\n\nphilosophy” vanished as swiftly from the\n\nFrench intellectual stage as it appeared on it.\n\nI.\n\nThe May 1968 events in France, as well as a\n\nnumber of political events from the mid-\n\n1950s to the second half of the 1970s, produced\n\na profound crise de conscience in French\n\nMarxist thought. The Nouvelle Philosophie\n\nemerged as a byproduct of this crisis. A\n\ncoterie of French intellectuals, self-proclaimed\n\n“new philosophers,” frantically denounced\n\nall forms of Marxism as a “philosophy of\n\ndomination” and, as Lévy put it, an “opium\n\nfor the people.” The “shocking” novelty of\n\ntheir “new” philosophy was believed to\n\nmark the “end” of Marxism in French social\n\nthought. Thirty years later, however, a number\n\nof questions linger in the intellectual\n\nhorizon. What was new in the Nouvelle\n\nPhilosophie? What were its tenets? Why did it\n\nfail to emerge as a distinctive school of\n\nthought? If Marx est mort, as the “new\n\nphilosophers” and the media announced with\n\nfanfare in the mid-1970s, why couldn’t the\n\nFrench “new philosophy” escape the fate of\n\nan ephemeral phenomenon? Were the “new\n\nphilosophers” misunderstood, incorrectly\n\ninterpreted, or badly read in their time? Or\n\ndid they simply fail to provide a new conceptual\n\nframework for the understanding and\n\nthe interpretation of human society at the fin\n\nde siècle? In what follows I attempt to answer\n\nsome of these questions.\n\nII.\n\nFrance is a country where Marxism in one\n\nform or another, but most importantly in the\n\nform of Marxist existentialism and humanism\n\nas developed in the writings of Jean-Paul\n\nSartre and Maurice Merleau-Ponty, as well\n\nas of a more orthodox Marxism championed\n\nby Louis Althusser in the early 1960s, has\n\nprovided a dominant frame of reference for\n\nwork in philosophy, sociology, and the “human\n\nsciences” ever since the end of World\n\nWar II.2 During the first two decades after\n\nthe war the grip of Marxism on the minds of\n\nFrench intellectuals was virtually complete. It\n\nbecame the cerebral orthodoxy in Parisian\n\nintellectual life, or as Jean-Paul Sartre put it,\n\nthe “unsurpassable horizon” of the age. As a\n\nmatter of fact, it remained so even as it was\n\nreinterpreted in light of existentialism, surrealism,\n\nSaussurean structural linguistics, and\n\neven Freudian psychology.\n\nIt was not until the mid-1960s—a period\n\nof affluence, mobility, and individualism\n\nproduced by remarkable economic growth,\n\ndecline in working-class activism, and the\n\ntedious sclerosis of the Partie Communiste\n\nFrançais—that the intellectual reign of Marxism\n\nin France became vulnerable to profoundly\n\nideological and political attacks from\n\nall sides of the intellectual establishment.\n\nMarxism lost its terrain to structuralism and\n\nto what is called post-structuralism in the\n\nAnglo-Saxon world. It was now clear that\n\ncapitalism, which Marx had so thoroughly\n\nanalyzed a century earlier, was no longer the\n\nsame, and the alternative of a revolutionary\n\ntransformation of capitalist society was neither\n\nthe order of the day nor desirable\n\nanymore. Structuralist movements at this\n\ntime not only called into question every\n\naspect of modern liberal life, they also seemed\n\nto wipe out all hope of escaping the tentacles\n\nof “power” through political action. Instead,\n\nthey offered “new possibilities” for resistance,\n\nincluding what Lévy considered a\n\n“moral and religious resistance against the\n\nevil.”3 The shift was of such magnitude that,\n\nas Mark Lilla points out, “rather than resisting\n\nin action the dehumanization of man on\n\nthe basis of a rational analysis of history, one\n\nresisted in theory the idea of a ‘man’, ‘reason’,\n\nand ‘history’ as the oppressive products\n\nof ideology,”4\n\nAfter the rise of the New Left and the events of\n\nMay ’68, all this became clear. An idiosyncratic\n\nhistorical work like Michel Foucault’s Discipline\n\nand Punish succeeded in casting a far darker\n\nshadow of suspicion over liberal society than\n\nLouis Althusser’s laborious analyses of Marx’s\n\nCapital in the mid sixties….Politically, May ’68\n\nmarked the beginning of the end of Marxism, with\n\nMaoism and the “boutique” movements of the\n\nearly seventies (feminism, ecologism, “Third\n\nWorldism”) left glowing like embers of a dying\n\nfire.5\n\nThis radical transformation in the intellectual\n\nlife of France and other parts of\n\nWestern Europe was further influenced by a\n\nseries of political events, such as the Hungarian\n\ntragedy in 1956, the 1968 Soviet repression\n\nof the “Prague Spring,” and the invasion\n\nof Czechoslovakia, the publication of\n\nAlexander Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago\n\nin 1973 and its translation in 1974 and, as\n\nsignificantly, the butcheries in Cambodia in\n\nthe second half of the 1970s. By revealing the\n\nrepressive nature of state socialism and shaking\n\nliberal sympathies for Third World socialism,\n\nsuch events set off a profound crise de\n\nconscience among French intellectuals.\n\nThere is no doubt that the signs of crisis in\n\nFrench Marxist thought had appeared much\n\nearlier. One of the events that bred such a\n\ncrisis was the Korean conflict in 1950. For\n\nMerleau-Ponty the war in Korea proved the\n\nimperialist nature of the Soviet Union,\n\nwhereas for Sartre it marked “the end of\n\nidealism” and the beginning of “realism.” It\n\nwas in the mid-1950s that Merleau-Ponty,\n\nin his Les aventures de la dialectique (1955,\n\nAdventures of the Dialectic), announced his\n\nrenunciation of Marxism.\n\nThere is not much point in trying Bolshevism all\n\nover again at the moment when its revolutionary\n\nfailure becomes apparent. But neither is there\n\nmuch sense in trying Marx all over again if his\n\nphilosophy is involved in this failure or in acting\n\nas if this philosophy came out of this affair intact.6\n\nFor Sartre, it was a few years later when,\n\nin his La critique de la raison dialectique (1960,\n\nCritique of Dialectical Reason), he “settled\n\nthe accounts” both with his own previous\n\nthought and with that of the Communists,\n\nwho, he then believed, falsified “true Marxism.”\n\n7 It was the publication of Solzhenitsyn’s\n\nwork, however, that had the most shocking\n\nimpact among French intellectuals. As Lévy\n\nputs it, Solzhenitsyn’s work was “enough to\n\nimmediately shake our mental landscape and\n\noverturn our ideological guideposts.”8 In the\n\nspan of a few years, intellectuals who once\n\nsubscribed to Sartre’s view on Marxism as\n\nthe “unsurpassable horizon” of our time\n\nbegan to confess that Communist totalitarianism\n\nmight fall within that horizon and not\n\nbe a historical accident that can be explained\n\nsimply as a consequence of the Bolsheviks’\n\nmistakes and the Stalinist deviations. Such a\n\nview was most eloquently expressed by Michel\n\nFoucault in his review of André Glucksmann’s\n\nLes maîtres penseurs (The Master Thinkers),\n\nwhich was for Foucault himself a final settling\n\nof accounts with Marxism.\n\nThe whole of a certain left has attempted to\n\nexplain the Gulag…in terms of the theory of\n\nhistory, or at least the history of theory. Yes, yes,\n\nthere were massacres, but that was a terrible error.\n\nJust reread Marx or Lenin, compare them with\n\nStalin and you will see where the latter went\n\nwrong. It is obvious that all those deaths could\n\nonly result from a misreading. It was predictable:\n\nStalinism-error was one of the principal agents\n\nbehind the return to Marxism-truth, to Marxism-\n\ntext, which we saw in the 1960s. If you want\n\nto be against Stalin, don’t listen to the victims;\n\nthey will only recount their tortures. Reread the\n\ntheoreticians: they will tell you the truth.9\n\nSuch was, briefly, the context in which\n\nthe nouvelle philosophie emerged in the mid-\n\n1970s.\n\nIII.\n\nThe expression “nouveaux philosophes” (new\n\nphilosophers) derived from the title of a\n\ndossier edited by Lévy in the literary weekly\n\nLes Nouvelles Littéraires in June 1976. The\n\ncollective noun referred to a number of\n\nyoung—and for the most part unknown—\n\nintellectuals including Lévy himself, Jean-\n\nMarie Benoist, Michel Guérin, Christian\n\nJambet, and Guy Lardreau. The dossier\n\nconsisted of several articles presenting the\n\nviews of such young authors, interspersed\n\nwith interviews or exchanges of letters with\n\nwell-known figures such as Claude Lévi-\n\nStrauss and Roland Barthes. In this way the\n\nimpression was created that the imprimatur of\n\nthe philosophico-literary establishment was\n\ngranted to the “new movement,” which the\n\ndossier purported to herald. Lévy’s introduction\n\nof the dossier aimed at producing maximum\n\nimpact in public, giving the impression\n\nthat something truly new, original, unusual,\n\nground-breaking, and exciting was happening\n\nin French thought, but displaying also a\n\nnumber of important theoretical points of\n\nreference—from Nietzsche and Heidegger\n\nto structuralism’s “Gang of Four”: Lévi-\n\nStrauss, Foucault, Lacan, and Althusser.\n\nA month later, Le Nouvel Observateur,\n\nFrance’s leading left-wing weekly, published\n\na lengthy article by Gérard Petitjean,10 in\n\nwhich a number of other young writers were\n\nlaunched as “new philosophers” including\n\nJean-Paul Dollé, André Glucksmann, Jean\n\nBaudrillard, Guy Hocquenhem, and Nikos\n\nPoulantzas. Although that article made no\n\nreference to Maurice Clavel, Gilles Susong,\n\nAlain Finkielkraut, and Philippe Nemo, the\n\nlatter were no less affiliated with the nouvelle\n\nphilosophie than the others. Most of the thirteen\n\nor fourteen “new philosophers” ranged\n\nin age from twenty-eight to forty. Lévy, the\n\nyoungest of all, emerged as the mastermind,\n\nthe founder, the figurehead, and de facto\n\nspokesman of this shifting assemblage, not\n\nleast because most of the “new philosophers”\n\nwere published in the “Figures” and\n\n“Théoriciens” series which he edited for\n\nGrasset.11\n\nAlthough the label “new philosopher” was\n\ninevitably a somewhat fluid term, not least of\n\nall because it is stretching the word to call any\n\nof them—apart from Glucksmann—a “philosopher,”\n\nthe authors who were self-styled\n\nthe “nouveaux philosophes” moved rapidly to\n\nthe center of attention. They dominated\n\npublic perception of the day, creating the\n\nimpression that a moment of philosophical\n\nadventure was happening in contemporary\n\nFrench thought. They were featured on\n\nmagazine covers and TV talk shows and,\n\nmirabile dictu, became overnight celebrities.\n\nThey made headlines not only in France, but\n\nalso in Germany, England, Italy, and to some\n\nextent also in the United States. Time described\n\nthe advent of the “new philosophy”\n\nas “probably the liveliest intellectual hubbub\n\nto hit Paris since the early 1950s.”12 For the\n\nrest of 1976 and the next year or so the\n\nnouvelle philosophie truly became media property.\n\nAppearances on television and public\n\ndebates were accompanied by a flood of\n\npress interviews, many in magazines not\n\nnormally noted for their interest in philosophical\n\nor political issues, such as Lui, Paris-\n\nMatch, the French edition of Playboy, etc. It\n\nseemed impossible to read a Parisian newspaper\n\nor to turn on the radio without finding\n\nsome mention of the “nouveaux philosophes.”13\n\nMedia exposure of the nouvelle philosophie\n\nwas so great as to lead to a new coinage: “pub\n\nphilosophie“14 (from “publicité philosophie“—\n\npublicity philosophy). In summer 1976, Paris\n\nwas once again showing itself to be the city\n\nwhere fashion in the realm of ideas moves\n\nfaster than anywhere else, as was earlier the\n\ncase with the art nouveau, the nouveau roman,\n\nthe nouveau cinéma, and the nouveau réalisme.\n\nBesides their young age, there were basically\n\ntwo things that the “new philosophers”\n\nhad in common: first, they emerged from\n\nthe same socio-political context; second,\n\nthey shared certain political beliefs and philosophical\n\nassumptions. More specifically, however,\n\nthe “new philosophers” shared a common\n\npast of Maoist gauchisme15 and their\n\nactual anti-Marxism. As Sheehan metaphorically\n\nputs it, they all had set flame to their\n\nrecent Maoist past and “had risen like Phoenix\n\nfrom the ashes to go on to condemn\n\nMarxism and modern liberalism, the Gulag\n\nand Coca-Cola, fascism of the left and the\n\nright…and the rule of the masses.”16 David\n\nMacey, in his biography of Michel Foucault,\n\npoints out that to the extent that any unity\n\ncould be found in the work of this somewhat\n\ndisparate group, it was “a negative unity\n\ncentered upon a violent rejection of Marxism\n\nin all its forms.”17 On a cynical view,\n\nsuch as that of Gilles Deleuze, the “varieties”\n\nof the nouvelle philosophie—Christian, leftist,\n\nliberal, Nietzschean—were simply “different\n\nways of dressing up the same reactionary\n\nmessage so as to appeal to as many tastes as\n\npossible.”18\n\nVirtually all the “new philosophers”—\n\nexcept for Benoist—had a leftist past. They\n\nwere veterans of the May ’68 movement and\n\nformer leftist militants descending from different\n\nMaoist groups.19 Their biography of\n\npolitical militancy became an almost indispensable\n\ntrademark for the “new philosophers,”\n\nfor it provided not only the authenticity\n\nof disillusionment in their denunciations\n\nof Marxism, but also served as “a source\n\nof moral authority for their later pronouncements\n\nand provided their work with a vague\n\naura of leftism.”20 For the media, the “new\n\nphilosophers” belonged to a “lost generation,”\n\ndisillusioned by the fading of the\n\ndreams and expectations of May 1968, yet\n\ncontinuing to bear witness to the “inner\n\ntruth” of that movement.\n\nThe extreme gauchisme of the “new philosophers,”\n\nwhich was tempered on the road\n\nfrom Althusser through a French-style\n\nMaoism, was converted in the mid-1970s,\n\nunder the impact of the Soviet and East\n\nEuropean dissidents, into open anti-Marxism.\n\nThey subscribed to the idea that Marxism\n\nis an evil and an obsolete ideology that\n\nleads inevitably to totalitarianism and terror.\n\nFor them, Marx and his holy scriptures alone\n\nwere responsible for the Soviet labor camps\n\nand all the crimes committed by state socialism.\n\nThis conviction became the central\n\nthesis of Glucksmann’s La cuisinière et le\n\nmangeur d’hommes (1975, The Cook and the\n\nMan-Eater), and was further expanded in his\n\nLes maîtres penseurs (1977).\n\nThe first book is a generalization from the\n\nSoviet example to all of Marx and all socialism.\n\nInspired by Solzhenitsyn’s disclosures of\n\nthe horrors of Stalin’s Gulag, La cuisinière is\n\na favorable review of the Gulag Archipelago in\n\nterms of Foucault’s reading of the European\n\nprison system and lunatic asylums.\n\nGlucksmann, who had been Foucault’s student,\n\ndescribed the revolt of the “new philosophers”\n\nagainst Marxism as a refusal to be\n\nswept along the rails of “a system that was\n\nissued 150 years ago by an illustrious longbeard.”\n\nMarx and his nineteenth-century\n\nphilosophical doctrine, which was not only\n\nout of date but, most importantly, dangerous\n\nin the new era, were made responsible for all\n\ncrimes committed by Stalin since, according\n\nto Glucksmann, there would have been “no\n\nRussian camps without Marxism.”21 Communism,\n\nin his view, equals Nazism, for “a\n\ncamp is a camp, be it Russian or Nazi.”22\n\nLévy, on his part, simply echoed\n\nGlucksmann’s view when in his La barbarie à\n\nvisage humain (1977, Barbarism with a Human\n\nFace)—a patchwork of ideas borrowed\n\nfrom the writings of his associates (Lardreau,\n\nJambet, and Glucksmann), which immediately\n\nbecame a bestseller—he strongly attacked\n\nthe promises of Marxism as empty,\n\nblaming Marx for all evils of the Soviet\n\nUnion where the state had grown into a\n\nmonstrous “reactionary machine.” “The\n\nSoviet camps,” Lévy rephrased, “are Marxist,\n\nas Marxist as Auschwitz was Nazi.”23 All\n\nthis, according to Lévy, became evident\n\nwith Solzhenitsyn, whom Lévy called “the\n\nDante of our time,” and “the Shakespeare of\n\nour time, the only one who knows how to\n\npoint out the monsters.”\n\nWe needed another Divine Comedy to represent\n\nHell, the modern Hell of the Gulag, whose\n\nhorrendous topography he [Solzhenitsyn] has\n\noutlined in book after book. Hence there was a\n\nchain reaction, first of all within reference to\n\nMarxism. It was enough that Solzhenitsyn spoke\n\nfor us to wake up from a dogmatic sleep. All he had\n\nto do was to appear, and a very long history finally\n\ncame to an end: the history of those Marxists who,\n\nfor thirty years, had been retracing the path of\n\ndecadence in search of their guilty party, moving\n\nsorrowfully from the “bureaucratic phenomenon”\n\nto the “Stalinist deviation,” from Stalin’s\n\n“crimes” to Lenin’s “faults,” finally from Leninism\n\nto the blunders of the earliest apostles, going\n\nthrough the layers of the Marxian soil one by one,\n\nsacrificing a scapegoat at each step, but always\n\npreserving above suspicion the one he dares to\n\ndenounce for the first time—the founding father\n\nhimself, Karl Capital and his holy scriptures.24\n\nLike Glucksmann, Lévy found that\n\nFoucault’s description of the great confinement\n\nin his Histoire de la folie (History of the\n\nMadness) was applicable to the Soviet Union\n\nand, therefore, he called for “a Foucauldian\n\nanalysis” of Soviet society. The advocacy of\n\nthe “new philosophers” for the Soviet dissidents\n\nand for Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago\n\nwas so zealous that Deleuze, in a\n\nvirulent pamphlet, expressed his disdain,\n\nsaying that he was disgusted by the way the\n\n“new philosophers” were trying to create “a\n\nmartyrology…feeding on corpses, blaming\n\nthe inhabitants of the Gulag for not having\n\n‘understood’ earlier,” and showing rather\n\n“too much scorn for the inhabitants of the\n\nGulag.”25 Other authors also criticized the\n\n“new philosophers” on similar grounds, pointing\n\nout that with their writings they only\n\n“contributed to make the reality of Gulag a\n\nmyth.”26\n\nIV.\n\nCritics usually agree that the “shocking”\n\nnovelty of the “new philosophers” consisted\n\nof the fact that they were a group of young\n\nintellectuals who were no longer prepared to\n\ndialogue with—or work within—the framework\n\nof Marxism but openly denounced it as\n\na philosophy of domination.27 For them,\n\nMarxism had proved incapable of explaining\n\nthe struggles and the sufferings of men in\n\nthe present day. Its theoretical tools were no\n\nlonger valid; hence, as Lévy wrote in his La\n\nbarbarie, it had become “urgent to rethink\n\nthe spectrum of our society, according to\n\nnew guides, new systems of power, and new\n\norders of concepts.”28\n\nThe question for the “new philosophers”\n\nwas not criticizing Marxism as a philosophy\n\nand ideology and its alteration in light of the\n\nnew social realities. Their aim was rather an\n\nout-and-out liquidation of Marxism as a\n\nworldview. In 1970, Jean-Marie Benoist\n\nhad announced the “end” of Marxism in his\n\nbook Marx est mort (Marx is Dead). After\n\ndecades in which the vast majority of French\n\nintellectuals had almost unanimously adhered\n\nto Marxism, the attitude of the “new\n\nphilosophers” seemed now to mark an important\n\ndeparture. Whereas the Paris events\n\nof May ’68 had led to the “stagnation” of\n\nFrench Marxism, the advent first of Deleuze’s\n\n“philosophies of desire” (1970-1975), and\n\nthen of the nouvelle philosophie (1976-1978)\n\n“marked the ‘disappearance’ of Marxism—\n\nat least temporarily—from the field of discussion\n\nin France.”29\n\nBe that as it may, the “new philosophers”\n\ncannot be credited with originality in regard\n\nto their vehement denunciation of Marx and\n\nMarxism. Anti-Marxism in French modern\n\nthought did not arise in 1977. As early as\n\n1948—that is, three decades before the “new\n\nphilosophers” voiced their anger at and\n\nrepugnance of Marx, Marxism, and the\n\nSoviet totalitarian system to which it was\n\napplied—Marxism and Sovietism were\n\nstrongly denounced by Claude Lefort, who\n\nwas directly influenced by Victor\n\nKravchenko’s book I Chose Freedom. Other\n\nimportant examples of earlier denunciation\n\nof Marxism in French modern thought include\n\nRaymond Aron’s L’opium des intellectuels\n\n(1955, The Opium of the Intellectuals), and\n\nMerleau-Ponty’s Les aventures de la dialectique.\n\nEarlier still, André Gide and Arthur Koestler,\n\namong others, had abandoned communism\n\nand Marxism to which they had previously\n\nsubscribed, in bitter disillusionment with\n\nStalin’s purges and the Molotov-Ribbentrop\n\nPact of 1939.\n\nDespite the zealous ambition of the “new\n\nphilosophers” to search for tools for understanding\n\nthe new social world more adequate\n\nthan those Marxism provided, they were\n\nutterly unable to create any coherent system\n\nof concepts and propositions. The “New\n\nPhilosophy” indeed produced nothing that\n\ncould be compared with other philosophical\n\nschools (i.e. the Frankfurt School or existentialism),\n\nnor were the “new philosophers”\n\nallied to one another through some kind of a\n\ncommon doctrine. One could argue, as\n\nHirschhorn does, that the “new philosophy”\n\nwas, in 1976–1977, still “a school in the\n\nmaking.”30 But even if we agree with such a\n\nclaim for a moment, there is no doubt that\n\nthe “new philosophy” failed to emerge as a\n\ndistinctive school of thought, regardless of\n\nsome praise it received initially. On the one\n\nhand, besides their rejection of Marxism,\n\nwhich became a central theme in all fourteen\n\nbooks that the “new philosophers” churned\n\nout and in numerous magazine and newspaper\n\narticles and interviews—their whole theoretical\n\nrepertoire—there was not much else\n\nthat they had in common. Even though\n\nalmost every one of them declared himself a\n\nmoralist in philosophy, a nominalist in\n\nworldview, and an anti-totalitarian in politics,\n\nit is impossible to discuss the “new\n\nphilosophers” as if they represented a unified\n\nviewpoint on anything.31 At the crest of their\n\njubilation, in 1978, Michael Ryan pointed\n\nout that\n\nThe “new philosophers” could be said to exist in\n\nname only. The homogeneity of the movement\n\nrests on a mutual espousal of heterogeneity.\n\nHence, their “program”: a rejection of authority\n\nof any kind whatsoever (be it right or left), a\n\npessimistic belief that the Master (any form of\n\nauthoritarian power, from parents to state) is\n\nineliminable, that the only moral alternative is\n\nneutrality or a Christian detachment from the\n\narena of power, that the only political alternative\n\nis a perpetual revolt which dances constantly out\n\nof the grasp of the Master in the hope of a future\n\nfree from mastery; a condemnation of reason as a\n\nweapon which reinforces mastery in the form of\n\nstate power; and finally (and it is this which has\n\nearned them notoriety) an arraignment of\n\nEurocommunism, as well as of Marx and of\n\nsocialism in general, as a modern Master, whose\n\ninevitable expression is Gulag.32\n\nDespite the public perception that the\n\n“new philosophers” formed a coherent group,\n\nthey themselves insisted that there were important\n\ndifferences in their views and some\n\nbridled at being lumped together. The group’s\n\noldest member, as well as its best-regarded\n\nthinker, Glucksmann, refused even to be\n\ngrouped with them.\n\nOn the other hand, the content of their\n\nworks also is eclectic. Emmanuel Garrigues\n\nrefers to Glucksmann’s works as an example\n\nof philosophical eclectism where Nietzsche,\n\nWagner, Clausewitz, and Mao Tse-tung are\n\nall mixed up together.33 Peter Dews, for his\n\npart, points out that the work of the “new\n\nphilosophers” is in fact an “ill-considered\n\nmélange of theories, attitudes, and responses,\n\nin which positions inherited from the post-\n\n’68 far-left mingle with themes which, under\n\ntheir veneer of novelty, can be seen to belong\n\nto the traditional repertoire of the Right.”34\n\nOld reminiscences of Althusserian Marxism\n\nand Maoism—although Marx, Althusser, and\n\nMao were now rejected en bloc—were mixed\n\nup with a set of notions borrowed from\n\nLacan, Kojève, Foucault, and Solzhenitsyn,\n\nwho became their new gurus. This resulted in\n\nan amalgam of beliefs, ranging from Lévy’s\n\nnihilist spiritualism—at first of a moralistic\n\nform in his La barbarie and then with plain\n\nreligious tones and references to the biblical\n\nheritage in his Le testament de Dieu (1979,\n\nThe Testament of God), which Elle magazine\n\nreferred to as a signal of “un nouveau\n\nmysticisme“35—to a sort of Lacanian Christianity\n\nin the work of Philippe Nemo, and,\n\nfurthermore, to Gnosticism to be found in\n\nL’ange (1976, The Angel), a book written by\n\nGuy Lardreau and Christian Jambet. Gilles\n\nDeleuze, who criticized the “new philosophers”\n\nprobably more harshly than any other\n\nFrench scholar, disdained them as “sophists”\n\nand “TV buffoons,” who should be credited\n\nfor nothing.36\n\nAs was previously suggested, besides their\n\nadmiration for Solzhenitsyn, the thought\n\nand idiom of the “new philosophy” was\n\nmarked by Lacan and Foucault. Lacan’s\n\nwork had been important for several generations\n\nof French intellectuals, including\n\nMerleau-Ponty, Jean Hyppolite, and Louis\n\nAlthusser. Especially after the publication of\n\nhis Ecrits in the late 1960s, Lacan became a\n\ntruly central figure. The “new philosophers”\n\nmade extensive use of Lacan’s perception of\n\nscience as an “ideology of the suppression of\n\nthe subject,” expanding it into an attack on\n\nthe “authoritarianism” implicit in the rigor\n\nof scientific method. This, as Michael Ryan\n\nasserts, might explain their rage against\n\ntheory, science, reason, and Marx, all of\n\nwhich they lumped whole-sale with Gulag\n\nand the concentration camps.37 For Lévy,\n\nthe totalitarian state means “scientists in\n\npower.”38 “Total power,” he wrote, is synonymous\n\nwith “total knowledge.” The threat\n\nof totalitarianism is even greater when a\n\nsociety imposes the duty of “telling all.” This\n\nis, in Lévy’s view, the case with state socialism\n\nand its Marxist ideology, for by sanctifying\n\n“the Hegelian dream of the truth\n\nbecoming the world and the world becoming\n\nthe truth, [it] ends up with an ideal which\n\nis…one of the definitions of modern tyranny.”\n\n39\n\nThe theme of “power/knowledge” became\n\ncentral also in Glucksmann’s Les maîtres\n\npenseurs. Inspired by Foucault, who insisted\n\nthat power is irreducible, that no system can\n\ndo away with the structures of power and\n\nthat a system can at best merely shift them,\n\nGlucksmann extended his criticism to what\n\nhe calls “the Revolution-State,” arguing that\n\nall philosophers, without exception, display a\n\nwill to domination, which explains their\n\ncomplicity with tyrants. Rephrasing Hegel,\n\nGlucksmann maintains that “to dominate is\n\nto know; to know is to dominate.”40 This,\n\naccording to Glucksmann, is a vicious circle.\n\nAnd the circle of circles: “The master fabricates\n\nall the truth.”41 Glucksmann accused\n\nmodern philosophy since Hegel of intellectual\n\ncomplicity in the violence of a history\n\ndominated by principles of the revolutionary\n\nstate. Demonstrating such an understanding\n\nof the relation pouvoir/savoir, the “new philosophers”\n\ntried to find the seeds of “totalitarianism”\n\nin the 1844 Manuscripts of the\n\nyoung Marx and in Hegel’s Logic. In their\n\nview, all Marxism becomes Stalinism or\n\nGulag, whereas the dictatorship of the proletariat\n\nis Hegel’s monarchical state, or Fichte’s\n\npolice state. As Foucault, who welcomed the\n\npublication of Les maîtres penseurs puts it,\n\nGlucksmann’s basic question is: “By what\n\ntrick was German Philosophy able to turn\n\nRevolution into the promise of a true, a good\n\nstate, and the State into the serene and\n\ncomplete form of Revolution?” Foucault\n\nhimself, in his review of this book, endorsed\n\nGlucksmann’s blanket condemnation of the\n\nhyphenated monster “State-Revolution,”\n\nportrayed as inevitably devouring its own\n\nchildren.42\n\nGlucksmann’s and Lévy’s views on the\n\ncomplicity of knowledge and power or philosopher\n\nand tyrant show how much the\n\n“New Philosophy” was influenced by\n\nAlexandre Kojève’s teachings, for it was\n\nKojève who, over two decades earlier, had\n\nannounced that there is “no essential difference\n\nbetween the philosopher and the tyrant.”\n\nThe tyrant, according to Kojève, is\n\nnever anything but a statesman attempting to\n\nrealize a philosophical idea in the world.\n\nSince the truth of a philosophical notion is\n\njudged by its realization in history, the\n\nphilosopher, Kojève argues, cannot reproach\n\nthe tyrant for tyrannizing in the name of an\n\nidea, as is always the case with modern\n\ntyrannies, where those in power consistently\n\nclaim to represent an ideology.43\n\nMore directly still, the subject of the\n\nknowledge/power relationship, as it was\n\nthematized in the works of the “new philosophers,”\n\nand their belief in the inherent oppressiveness\n\nof reason seem to have been\n\ninspired by Foucault’s early work Folie et\n\ndéraison: Histoire de la folie à l’âge classique\n\n(1961, Madness and Civilization: A History of\n\nInsanity in the Age of Reason) and, even more\n\nimportantly, by his Surveiller et punir (1975,\n\nDiscipline and Punish). For Foucault,\n\nPower and knowledge directly imply one another….\n\nThere is no power relation without the\n\ncorrelative constitution of a field of knowledge,\n\nnor any knowledge that does not presuppose and\n\nconstitute at the same time power relations.44\n\nJust as Foucault demonstrated that, in\n\ngeneral, power produces knowledge and\n\nknowledge in turn reinforces power, so the\n\n“new philosophers” located the origin of\n\nauthority in reason. Reason, as a powerful,\n\nordering, and system-making device, lies\n\nbehind the desire to create hierarchy in the\n\norder: Theory, Party, State, Gulag; hence\n\nthe movement from rational thought, as a\n\nform of theoretical mastery, to the concentration\n\ncamps, as a form of practical mastery.\n\nGlucksmann considers Marxism a “rational\n\ntheology,” hence Gulag and the camps are\n\nalready inscribed in Marx’s text, which as a\n\nrational theory has decided how things are\n\nand which therefore constitutes a law that\n\ndemands overall obedience and precludes challenge.\n\nIn his view, Marx’s theory, because it\n\nis a rational system, is in itself authoritarian\n\nand, as such, it leads inevitably to Gulag.\n\n“C’est comme ça,” that’s how it is—as Jambet\n\nand Lardreau, citing Lacan, put it.\n\nSimilar arguments were used by other\n\n“new philosophers” to explain the complicity\n\nof language and power domination. Lévy,\n\nfor example, maintains that language is\n\npower. Moreover, language is the essence of\n\npower, and “grammar is the science of\n\npower.” He writes:\n\nThere is an obvious relationship between the form\n\nof power and the shape of language, between the\n\norders of a Prince and the images of a sentence….\n\nThere is an idiomatic science of power, an algebra\n\nof domination, and there is no politics that is not\n\nfirst of all linguistics…. Speech is not as Aristotle\n\nproposed, a pacified space in which conflict can be\n\nexpressed; neither is it, as the Marxists say, a\n\npolitical instrument which oppressors and oppressed\n\nin turn make use of; nor is it even, as\n\nFoucault’s followers assert, a critical stake in the\n\nstruggle for power. Language is simply power, the\n\nvery form of power, entirely shaped by power even in\n\nits most modest rhetorical expression.45\n\nAlthough we do not intend to go into\n\nfurther detail as regards Lévy’s ideas on the\n\nlanguage/power relationship, a number of\n\nquestions instantly come to mind: Does the\n\noppression of man by man and political\n\ndomination coincide in time with the birth\n\nof human language? Has language, over the\n\ncourse of history, contributed to the progress\n\nof society? How is it that some societies have\n\na more repressive state apparatus than others\n\neven though they may use the same language?\n\nCan there ever be a society free of\n\nexploitation and class domination while\n\npeople will still speak the same language that\n\nthey use today? In this context it is appropriate\n\nto recall the sarcastic words with which\n\nMarx and Engels once disparaged the Young\n\nHegelians:\n\nThey forget, however, that to these phrases they\n\nthemselves are only opposing other phrases, and\n\nthat they are in no way combating the real existing\n\nworld when they are merely combating the\n\nphrases of this world.46\n\nThe rejection of the “white terror of\n\ntheory” led the “new philosophers” to paradoxical\n\nattacks on science, not because of the\n\nfalsity of its discourse, but precisely because\n\nof its “truth.” “We have lost all the respect for\n\nscience,”47 declared Lardreau. In Lévy’s attack\n\non Marxism, for instance—and this\n\napplies to the nouvelle philosophie as a whole—\n\nhis ultimate argument is not that Marxism is\n\na false theory of society, but rather that it is\n\nan all-too-accurate account of the coming\n\nfate of the West. In other words, Marxism is\n\nauthoritarian from the very outset by virtue\n\nof its very rationality. As Lardreau and\n\nJambet put it, Marxism is oppressive because\n\nit is “true,” or at least represents the\n\n“untransvensable philosophy of our time.”48\n\nIn Lévy’s terms, “we are today enclosed\n\nwithin Marxism as Ptolemaic cosmologists\n\nwere enclosed within their cosmology,”49 so\n\nmuch so that to reply to Marxist theory with\n\na counter-theory would only result in a\n\nlapsing back into the “discourse of the Master.”\n\nAccording to Lévy, the protest against\n\nMarxism can only take a moral form, since in\n\nthe end “nothing remains but ethics and\n\nmoral duty”—and in this, Solzhenitsyn has\n\nshown the way:\n\nThe idea of an anti-Marxist politics is absurd,\n\nuntenable, and a contradiction in terms. Anti-\n\nMarxism is and can be nothing but the contemporary\n\nform of the fight against politics….For a\n\nlong time to come, we are condemned to the\n\nlanguage of Capital as long as we resign ourselves\n\nto play the game of politics….We no longer have\n\na politics, a language, or a recourse. There remain\n\nonly ethics and moral duty. There remains only\n\nthe duty to protest against Marxism, since we\n\ncannot forget it.50\n\nV.\n\nDespite a good deal of favorable response and\n\nthe unusual attention they initially received\n\nin the French media, the “new philosophers”\n\nnever had a wide popular following, nor did\n\nthey have much impact on French intellectual\n\nor academic life. As Deleuze pointed\n\nout, the impact of the “new philosophers”\n\nwas due much more to self-advertisement—\n\nmedia hype—than to a conscientious readership.\n\n51 In point of fact, the critical response\n\nin relation to the “new philosophers” in the\n\nFrench academy was one of derision. Very\n\nsoon they became an object for both polemic\n\nand mockery. One year after Lévy had\n\nannounced the aurora of the “New Philosophy”\n\nLe Nouvel Observateur published a\n\n“jeu-test,”52 which proposed a series of\n\nmultiple-choice questions to allow readers to\n\nconclude if they were “new philosophers.”\n\nAnyone who could honestly claim to have\n\nrejected Althusser in the last year scored a\n\nmaximum of three points; rejection of Foucault\n\nscored no points. The ideal “new philosopher”\n\nwas someone who had at various\n\ntimes been an orthodox communist, a Maoist,\n\nand a militant Roman Catholic.\n\nThe nouvelle philosophie was a fashion in\n\nParis. As such, it vanished quickly with the\n\nend of the season, which lasted for about two\n\nyears. Before the 1970s ended there was no\n\nlonger any publicity for it; no important\n\nworks written by any of its adherents; no\n\nserious reference made to them. Indeed,\n\nsince 1977 when Lévy published his La\n\nbarbarie the French public had been fed up\n\nwith the “novelties” of the “New Philosophy”\n\nand the media fanfares. Commenting\n\non this, Lévy would write with sadness and\n\nnarcissism at the same time:\n\nThere is a strange discrepancy between the public\n\nthat has been reached and the one that has been\n\naddressed, and some have to pay a heavy price for\n\nthis. I know that these books are read, but I also\n\nknow that they carry no weight; they are foreign\n\nbodies for the official left, transplants that cannot\n\nbe assimilated by its established institutions….I\n\ndon’t think Glucksmann has persuaded anyone\n\non the left, and not a single Marxist has been\n\nshaken by Marx est mort. This is not uncommon\n\nin the history of ideas: Many significant ideas were\n\nrejected or ignored in their age and always as a\n\ndirect result of their critical and subversive force.\n\nThe “nouveaux philosophes“…have been misunderstood,\n\nincorrectly interpreted, and badly read.\n\nHow could it be otherwise with a somnambulistic\n\nand somehow confused left which is still\n\nrehearsing obscure debates about reform and\n\nrevolution, and whose theoretical spectrum has\n\nnot got beyond the sour polemics of Lenin and\n\nHilferding?53\n\nMarx est mort. Yet, he remains a central\n\nfigure in much of contemporary debate in\n\nthe social sciences. This is not true for the\n\n“new philosophers” who, apart from their\n\nzealous ambition and self-aggrandizement\n\nproved unable to provide a coherent frame of\n\nreference for the understanding of the complexity\n\nof contemporary society, which might\n\nhave defined their “movement” as a new\n\nphilosophical moment. Hence, in the history\n\nof modern French philosophy, which Alain\n\nBadiou defines as the history of ideas that\n\ntook shape between 1940 and the end of the\n\ntwentieth century, that is from the publication\n\nof Sartre’s fundamental work L’être et le\n\nnéant (Being and Nothingness) in 1943 to the\n\nlast writings of Deleuze Qu’est-ce que la\n\nphilosophie? (What is Philosophy?) in 1992,54\n\nthe nouvelle philosophie occupies no place of\n\ndistinction. It failed to pass the test of time,\n\neven though the social and intellectual milieu\n\nand the time in which the “new philosophy”\n\nappeared were particularly conducive to\n\nnovel ideas.\n\nThis episode in French intellectual history\n\nprovides an object lesson in how not to set\n\nabout a philosophical reconstruction of French\n\nintellectual life, which could not be delivered\n\nfrom the dominance of Marxism by a faction\n\nof young men with no resourceful or consistent\n\nidea of their own. The “new philosophers”\n\ndeployed a mélange of postmodern\n\nslogans, including the denial of reason itself,\n\nagainst Marxism, but offered nothing substantially\n\nnew, coherent, or noteworthy in its\n\nplace. Although historical events in the mid-\n\n1970s had rendered Marxism intellectually\n\nvulnerable and politically obsolete, the failure\n\nof the “new philosophers” demonstrates\n\nthat mere opposition to discredited ideas is\n\nnot enough to introduce a new philosophical\n\nmovement without sound, coherent ideas of\n\nits own.\n\nNOTES\n\nSee the conversation of Francis Fukuyama with\n\nBernard-Henry Lévy “It Doesn’t Stay in Vegas,” The\n\nAmerican Interest 1, 3 (2006): 105.\n\nA relevant literature\n\non this issue includes David Caute, Communism and the\n\nFrench Intellectuals (New York: Macmillan, 1964); George\n\nLichtheim, Marxism in Modern France (New York: Columbia\n\nUniversity Press, 1966); Mark Poster, Existential\n\nMarxism in Postwar France (Princeton: Princeton University\n\nPress, 1975); Michael Kelly, Modern French Marxism\n\n(Baltimore: John Hopkins University Press, 1982); and\n\nTony Judt, Marxism and the French Left: Studies in Labor and\n\nPolitics in France, 1830–1881 (Oxford: Oxford University\n\nPress, 1986); Past Imperfect: French Intellectuals, 1944-\n\n1956 (University of California Press, 1992).\n\nQuoted\n\nin Georges Suffert, “Bernard-Henri Lévy un philosophe\n\nsur la montagne,” Le Point, 16 April 1979, 118–19.\n\nMark\n\nLilla, “The Legitimacy of the Liberal Age,” in M.
