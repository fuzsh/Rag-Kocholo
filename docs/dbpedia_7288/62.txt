I am the grandaughter of Reginald Tupper QC. My father was David Tupper QC.

Reginald Tupper was the son of Sir Charles Tupper [who was son of the orginal Sir Charles Tupper, of Nova Scotia].

The Knighthood [Sir] passed to eldest living male of next generation, so it skips around. Reginald Tupper was not the eldest male, so the knighthood passed to his brother and eventually down the line to another branch of the family, whom I am not familliar with. I do believe it is still in existance though.

Reginald Tupper married Isabel Marion Wilson and had two sons Charles Gordon Hibbert Tupper, and David Wilson Hibbert Tupper.

Charles Gordon [known as Gordon...now deceased] Married Margaret Campbell, and had one son Charles Reginald Hibbert Tupper, whom to date has no "issue". This branch of the family [Peggy Tupper, and son Reggie Tupper] reside in Vancouver BC.

David Wilson Hibbert Tupper [known as David, d. 1999], married Joan Margo Gillies of Ottawa [d 1985]. They had two sons and a daughter. Sidney Victor Hibbert Tupper; Charles Austin Hibbert Tupper, and Julia Isobel Tupper.

Sidney Victor Hibbert Tupper married Josaphina Vasallo of Ariquipa Peru, and had two children: Cecila Alexandra Tupper and Jesse Tupper. This branch of the family resides in Vancouver BC.

Charles Austin H has not married and has no "issue", and resides in Vancouver BC.

Julia Isobel Tupper retains her maiden name, has no "issue", is the widow of John Stregc, of Portland Oregon, and currently resides near Portland Oregon.
