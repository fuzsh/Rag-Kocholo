Nestled in against the solid medieval city walls, it is rimmed by the quiet waters of the Majoorgracht – the main moat – at the southern tip of the old walled town. I went there on a late November afternoon, one of the rare sunny days we had on that visit. The sun hung low over the far shore, gilding the still water of the moat. Trees glowed in orange and yellow, a few fallen leaves drifting over the pristine green lawn. Distant traffic and the croak of magpies (no larks!) were the only sounds. And as I had made my habit, I looked for the familiar maple leaf graven into a white stone. Thus, I found the grave of Sapper Jules Moray.\n\nMost are familiar with the notion that most of the Canadian Expeditionary Force was made up of English-born ex-pats, at least in its early years. While this is true, many nationalities and races were eventually accepted into its ranks: other Europeans such as Ukrainians, Polish, Russians, thousands of Americans (many of whom were transplanted Canadians), and somewhat reluctantly, later on Japanese, First Nations and Black Canadians. Also true is the fact that many CEF casualties were not, it turns out, buried far from home. Such was the case of Jules Moray, who was, until age 31, a native son of the land where he fought and fell, Belgium.\n\nJules was born in Liege, Belgium on 13 April 1879. He had a sister, Charlotte and a brother, Walter. I can find no reference to his parent’s names. Jules arrived in Canada, via Bristol, England, on 24 August 1910 on the Royal George to Montreal. He was all alone, apparently unmarried at age 31. He found work in the coal mines of Cape Breton, Nova Scotia before moving to Eastport, Idaho in November of 1910, an area rich in metals and minerals being mined. Five years later he was living in Fernie, British Columbia, still working as a miner, still unmarried. It was here in January 1916, that the tall, red-haired, blue-eyed 35-year-old enlisted in the 103rd Battalion. Permanently tattooed by the coal he dug – his face and hands were noted as having coal marks – Jules put his sister Charlotte of Wandre, Liege, deep in occupied Belgium, as his next of kin. His brother, Walter, it was noted, could be contacted care of the Consulate General of Belgium in Ottawa. His religion was documented as “Free Thought”.\n\nJules left Canada on 5 August 1916 on the S.S. Scotian, arriving in the UK two weeks later. He was in the field by September 1916, back in his native Belgium after six years away. Jules transferred from the 103rd to the 143rd Battalion, ending up – unsurprising given his profession – with first the No. 4, then the No. 3 Tunnelling Company. Jules spent the first part of his field service at Hill 60. This “hill” was the spoil heap from a railway cut, rising 60 feet above sea level. On the other side of the cutting the spoil heap was named “The Caterpillar”. In the relatively flat ground of the Ypres Salient, it gave German artillery an excellent vantage point over Ypres itself. Much fought over, it traded hands in the early years of the war, but in late 1916, a concerted effort was made by the British to root out the Germans. To do so, they dug deep into the earth and stacked these mine shafts with explosives. While the memorial at Hill 60 pays great tribute to the Australian mining efforts here, Canadian tunnelling companies, including Jules’ made contributions as well. By October 1916, the mines at Hill 60 and The Caterpillar held over 53,000 and 70,000 pounds of explosives respectively. Jules then moved not far away to the area of Messine Ridge where more extensive mining was underway. Twenty-four more mines were laid, with Jules working at trenches 127, 122 and the “Birdcage”. On 7 June 1917, at 3:10am twenty of the mines were detonated in the space of 20 seconds. Considered the loudest man-made noise, possibly heard as far away as Dublin, and one of the largest non-nuclear explosions, it was described by journalist Philip Gibbs:\n\n“Suddenly at dawn, as a signal for all of our guns to open fire, there rose out of the dark ridge of Messines and “Whitesheet” and that ill-famed Hill 60, enormous volumes of scarlet flame […] throwing up high towers of earth and smoke all lighted by the flame, spilling over into fountains of fierce colour, so that many of our soldiers waiting for the assault were thrown to the ground. The German troops were stunned, dazed and horror-stricken if they were not killed outright. Many of them lay dead in the great craters opened by the mines.”\n\nSo thorough was the work of the miners like Jules Moray, the operation was deemed such a success that six of the mines were left undetonated. One was accidentally detonated in the 1950s, after a lightning strike, I was told. The largest of them, at La Petite Douve, still sits in uneasy slumber under the barn of a local farm.\n\nI visited the Caterpillar mine crater, and it was truly impressive in size. A few craters are a short walk up from where Jim is buried at R.E. Farm Cemetery. Another that I visited is now called the Pool of Peace and is wrapped in a small copse of trees. It was both an eerie and peaceful place.\n\nCaterpillar crater, my husband is standing on the far side under the arrow. November 2023\n\nPool of Peace, Kruisstrat, Heuvelland, Belgium\n\nSometime during what would come to be known as the Third Battle of Ypres, which culminated in the Canadian capture of Passchendaele Ridge, Jules and the No. 3 Tunneling Company returned to the area of Ypres. It was here in late September that Jules was mortally wounded. He was carried as far as the #69 Field Ambulance, a British unit supporting the Battle of Menin Road. Field Ambulances were not vehicles, rather mobile, front-line units of 10 officers and 224 men, maintaining a series of dressing stations, capable of caring for 150 wounded. Doctors here would have triaged Jules and either initiated care or set him aside as unsavable. Unsavable he was whatever their decision; Jules died on 24 September 1917 and was buried in his home soil in the sheltering arms of the Ypres ramparts. When the war finally ended just over a year later, Charlotte and Walter, unlike most other families, would have been able to come see their brother’s peaceful final resting place.\n\nA Dandy Chap\n\n18 July 2024\n\nPrivate Lewis Murray Southgate\n\nI’m not sure why it took me so long to write this story. Murray’s death broke my great-aunt’s heart, and she didn’t marry until after the next world war stole more young men’s lives. Murray also became a good friend of Jim’s: they both were smitten with sisters from Halifax. I get the sense, through Jim’s letters, that Murray was good fun, loved a laugh, was up for an innocent lark. His war lasted two months.\n\nLewis Murray Southgate was born 21 April 1893 to Lewis Murray Sr and Frances Elizabeth Southgate, in the bustling historic city of London, England – 8 Leister Square, Bayswater, London to be exact. In that, he was like many of the early volunteers in the Canadian Expeditionary Force, an English ex-pat. His father was a “wasteman” which does not mean a garbage man but rather a person involved in keeping mine sites neat. In the early years of the century, Lewis Sr. began work in Springfield, Nova Scotia, likely in the coal mines there. In April 1907, 13-year-old Murray, his mother, 15-year-old sister, Frances, and 11-year-old brother, Frank, joined their father in Canada. Murray graduated from Mount Allison University in near-by Sackville, New Brunswick and took a job as a clerk with the Canadian Express Company in Halifax. In 1913, the senior Southgates moved back to England, settling in fashionable Kensington Square with three servants but none of their children, not even their unmarried daughter. It would not be long before Murray visited them, in uniform.\n\nMurray, a member of the 63rd Halifax Rifles militia, signed on to the Canadian Expeditionary Force in the first wave of volunteers. He arrived in Valcartier, QC in August of 1914 where Murray joined the Royal Highlanders of Canada (Black Watch), donning the famed kilt. The RHC, designated soon after the 13th Battalion, was formed mostly of men from the Montreal region and was noted as having 18 of their 27 officers being millionaires. One was a billionaire! One the 13th Battalion’s members would be Canada’s first Victoria Cross recipient of the First World War, in the conflict now named the Second Battle of Ypres.\n\nIsobel (standing) and Daisy (sitting) McCurdy\n\nIt was in Valcartier that Murray met Jim Johnstone. The two had a profession and the McCurdy sisters, Daisy and Isobel, in common, and a friendship bloomed. The two young men spent their time off duty socializing and even sneaking out of bounds to go swimming in the Jacques Cartier River. Murray, at 5’9”, was taller than the average recruit, with blue eyes and light brown hair. A handsome lad, he wore his kilt with style. In October 1914, the CEF moved overseas – Murray on the S.S. Alaunia – and then to Salisbury Plain. I am quite positive, given the generous amount of leave granted to the Canadians, he was able to visit his parents frequently and they him. What a gift, for when Murray was finally sent to the Front, they would never see him again.\n\nPhoto of the 13th Battalion in February 1915 from the book, “The 13th Battalion Royal Highlanders of Canada 1914-1919” by Robert C Fetherstonhough\n\nIn February 1916, the 13th Battalion was finally sent across the Channel and into the fighting. They embarked on the 12 February straight into the teeth of a gale, and Murray may have been one of the many felled by seasickness. An inauspicious start! After a few weeks learning from experienced British battalions, in March 1916, the CEF was tasked to relieve the 7th British Division in the trenches around the Ypres Salient. On 15 April, riding on re-purposed London omnibuses still resplendent with pre-war advertising, the 13th was brought through Poperinghe to Vlamertinghe, where they disembarked and marched through the brutalized medieval town of Ypres and on to St. Jean (Sint-Jan). On the night of 21 April – Murray’s 23rd birthday – the 13th took over trenches near Langemark-Poelkapelle. To their left were a battalion of French Turcos, soon to be victims of the first large-scale gas attack of the war; on their right was the Canadian 15th Battalion. The morning of 22 April revealed the incredibly poor state of their trenches, however, the Germans – only 50 -75 yards away – were surprisingly inactive, only sending over the occasional rifle shot or short burst of machine gun fire. The reason for this became clear at 5pm, when after 2 hours of heavy bombardment, the Germans released a wave of chlorine gas which destroyed the Turcos line. Investigating, the 13th Battalion officers found the Germans had punched through and were swinging in to flank the Canadians on their left. Despite heavy casualties from the shell fire, a number of companies of the 13th dug in to defend along the Poelkapelle Road. The attacks were unrelenting, from shelling, and machine guns. The 13th pulled back into their former trench lines. Rivers of wounded were evacuated through the 15th’s position. Some companies fought until overwhelmed, their members killed or captured. In this hellscape, Murray went missing.\n\nThe Second Battle of Ypres would go on to become one of those near-legendary battles in Canadian history: plucky Canadians holding off overwhelming opposing German forces until the British could come in to reinforce them, saving the Salient. It is mostly true and mostly a huge success, of which Canadians should be proud. That does not diminish the horrific cost in men lost, men who disappeared into the Ypres mud, never to be seen again. For months, Jim wrote to hospitals, looking for his friend Murray. He corresponded with Murray’s sister Frances. He reassured Daisy McCurdy, through his letters to his beloved Isobel, that men got mixed up in other battalions all the time, that he heard Murray was taken prisoner, was in hospital, would someday turn up. Who was he trying to reassure more, them or himself? Jim would be dead in those awful killing fields when the final pronouncement was made a year later: for all intents and purposes, Murray was presumed dead on or before 24 April 1916.\n\nMurray’s story would be another one lost to history but for Jim’s letters. Murray’s sister Frances married but had no children. His brother, Frank, also a volunteer in the CEF who served in France and Belgium, died by accidental drowning in 1922 in Newfoundland. Murray is not remembered by any generations down the line. His only memorial is an inscription on the Menin Gate, one of 55,000 men there named who sacrificed everything and have no known resting place.\n\nOn The Wings of The Morning\n\n7 May 2024\n\nLieutenant Arthur Clair Gilmour\n\nAs a teenager, I read the Bandy Papers, a three-time Leacock Award for Humour-winning, FWW series of novels by author Donald Jack. Jack’s horse-faced anti-hero, Bartholomew W. Bandy, when thrown out of medical school in 1916, enlists in the infantry. His face drives nearly everyone he meets to murderous rage, including his Colonel who transfers him to the Royal Flying Corps. The joke of the novel being, with the life expectancy in the RFC merely a few weeks, Bandy’s promotion was an almost certain death sentence. Of course, Bandy proves the exception, surviving, becoming an unlikely Ace and nearly killing his former Colonel by running him over with his airplane. It set up a lifelong dream to fly in a Sopwith Camel for me. This RFC reputation was, in reality, no joke, and many young flyers and their observers did indeed come to a premature end. One such Canadian loss was Lieutenant Arthur Clair Gilmour.\n\nGilmour was born in Saint John, New Brunswick on 26 May 1893 to Arthur Burrell and Helen Bertha (Jenks) Gilmour. Arthur’s only brother Francis, born in 1891, died at 10 months of age in 1892. His younger sister, Margaret joined the family in 1899. There would be no other children. Arthur Sr. was a clothier or “merchant tailor” and his son followed in the family business. In April of 1915, 22-year-old Arthur married Miss Nellie Beatrice Williams, daughter of Frank and Isla Williams. The young couple set up housekeeping at 315 Union St, then an area on the edges of the city, now home to a large shopping mall/office complex. By January of 1916, Arthur had enlisted in the newly formed 115th Battalion and Nellie was expecting their first – and only – child. Arthur had spent three years with the 62nd Fusiliers, Saint John’s volunteer militia regiment which is most likely why he entered the CEF as an officer. He was placed in command of a platoon – usually 24 to 40 “other ranks”, NCOs and an officer – during training in Saint John and Valcartier, PQ. It was an intimate group, compared to the massed thousand or so who made up the battalion and it seemed Arthur came to know them all well.\n\nI get the impression that both Arthur and Nellie were generous and caring people, and that business must have been good for the two generations of the Gilmour men because of two incidents mentioned in letters home from James Gilmore, one of the men in Arthur’s platoon. First, when the 115th arrived in England in July 1916, it was quickly broken up to reinforce depleted battalions at the front. This often happened if battalions hadn’t recruited their full strength. When Gilmour was faced with parting from his men, he was so moved, he wept openly in front of them as he bid them goodbye. That Christmas, Nellie, her newborn son only a few weeks old, made boxes of goodies for all the men of her husband’s former platoon and shipped them overseas. Arthur himself sent gifts to certain members of the platoon as well.\n\nIt appears Nellie moved in with her in-laws at 197 Germain St in the summer of 1916, an upscale neighbourhood of elegant brick townhouses built in the 1880s after the Great Fire of 1877 leveled the city. The house where they lived burned in 1918 and a 7-story Italianate, heritage-designated apartment building stands in its place. Arthur (III) Clair Gilmour was born there on 3 October 1916, long after his father, whom he would never meet, had left for England.\n\nIn January 1917, Gilmour was placed in a Garrison Duty Battalion and a month later was transferred to the 3rd Labor Battalion. On 10 February 1917 he was on his way to La Havre, France. This battalion worked in the rear areas, as most of the men were considered not fit for service in the trenches. Because most of their work was building rail lines to funnel ammunition, supplies and men to the front, the 3rd became the 11th Battalion, Canadian Railway Troops in November 1917. Perhaps this was not glamourous enough work for Gilmour, perhaps he wanted to see more action. Whatever the reason, in August of 1917, he was probationally attached to the RFC, as an Observer.\n\nWhile not pilots, and initially looked down on by pilots as mere ballast, by 1916, Observers were an integral and highly trained part of an aerial reconnaissance team. Working with their pilot, Observers mapped routes, determined compass bearings, distances and times for a search. In the air, they were tasked with documenting sightings, troop movements, gun emplacements and any other relevant details of the enemy trenches and fortifications. They often photographed the layout of these. They were often the targets of enemy fighters and guns from below as they carried vital information back to HQ. Their badge was a single wing (pilots had double wings) sprouting from an “O” to distinguish them from pilots.\n\nArmstrong-Whitworth F.K.8\n\nArthur likely spent time in England training for his new role, and arrived in France on 16 November 1917 with the RFC. In January 1918, he was attached to the 82nd Squadron and officially appointed Flight Officer (Observer) on 19 February 1918, with his senority backdated to November 1917. It was probably around then that he had his photo taken, wearing the so-called “maternity” tunic of the RFC, and sent home to his beloved wife and one-year-old son.\n\nOn 6 March 1918, 24-year-old Arthur and his 19-year-old pilot, Second Lieutenant Donovan L Sisley, hopped in their two-seater Armstrong-Whitworth FK8 to undertake a photographic mission southwest of Itancourt, France. In the formation was Lieutenant J. Kernahan. At the same time, five German Fokkers from Jasta 48 under the command of Ltn. Kurt Küppers was on patrol.\n\nLtn K. Küppers (1894 – 1971)\n\nFokkers were one of the most feared airplanes and the more pedestrian F.K.8 didn’t stand much of a chance when the two groups met near Séry-lès-Mézières. Gilmour and Sisley’s airplane was seen going down in flames on the German side. Küppers was credited with shooting down Sisley and Gilmour’s plane.\n\nThe initial report offered the family hope that both young men had survived, but stated that no further “particulars” could be expected for 3 weeks. Rumour ran that Arthur was in hospital and a prisoner of war. Unfortunately, word soon came from Kernahan that he had seen Gilmour hit and slump over in the cockpit. The F.K.8 fell in flames and was seen by officers of the 122nd Siege Battery to crash on its back and burst into flames. Arthur’s body was retrieved and buried in the military hospital cemetery at Itancourt. All this information was sent to the young widow in a letter by a Red Cross Society official, Florence K. Ellissen. Its hard to know whether knowing such details would have made it easier or harder for the family. Perhaps there was some comfort in knowing Arthur was likely dead already before crashing and burning.\n\nWhen Arthur’s medals arrived in September of 1922, and his “death penny”, the memorial plaque, nearly two years later, that wound would have been ripped open anew. It doesn’t appear Nellie ever remarried. Gilmour is remembered on the Flying Services Memorial in Arras, France\n\nOur Darling Soldier Boy\n\n16 April 2024\n\nPrivate James Alec Gilmore\n\nGrand Manan is a small island sitting in the wash of the mighty Bay of Fundy currents, part of the province of New Brunswick. Lashed by storms coming up the Atlantic coast and often muffled in the dense fog the Bay is known for, it is the site of numerous shipwrecks, old and new. Its population today is barely over 2500 people; in the 1880s it was half that. But the residents – most of whom wrest their livelihood from the unforgiving seas around Grand Manan – are resourceful, hardy, pragmatic and deeply in love with their stunningly beautiful island home. One such fisherman was a young man named James Alec Gilmore.\n\nJames – Jimmie to his family – was born on 20 October 1888 to Alexander (Sandy) and Lydia (Smith) Gilmore, the seventh of their ten children. Sandy was a farmer rather than a fisherman; Lydia was originally from Maine. When James was only 8, the sea claimed his eldest brother, 18-year-old Leeman. That seems not to have discouraged James from following in his brother’s footsteps to becoming a fisherman. Or perhaps that was just the pragmatism: fishing is one of the few options for a young man living on a small island.\n\nJames was an educated young man; his handwriting is neat and practiced in the letters he sent home. Fair-haired and blue-eyed, of average height, he was not particularly young for the time when he enlisted. The war had been raging for nearly a year and a half in January of 1916 when 28-year-old James – unmarried and still living at home – ventured to the mainland to sign on. He was attested in nearby Saint John. Perhaps he had hesitated when the original recruiting drive of August 1914 happened, and when the 26th Battalion was formed in New Brunswick in November of 1914, it may have been that his parents – having lost a son already – talked him out of going. The 115th Overseas Battalion was commissioned on 22 December 1915, and on 13 January 1916, James had submitted his name.\n\nJames (left) at Valcartier\n\nThe battalion trained that winter and spring in New Brunswick before travelling to Valcartier Camp in Quebec late in May/early June. They weren’t long there before sailing from Halifax, NS on 23 July 1916 on board the S.S. Olympic. James wrote home with delight, describing the ship for his father and mentioning a swim he’d had mid-Atlantic! They landed in Liverpool eight days later, traveling to the Bramschott training camps near Folkestone, where their training would have continued. James was able to get a pass to visit London, coming home, he said, broke but well pleased with his time there.\n\names’ platoon, likely at Bramschott (based on the huts). James is back row on the right end.\n\nIn late September, James wrote his last will and testament, a typical action for men bound for the front. Sure enough, a week later, James – in a draft of 200 men, no officers – was transferred to the 24th Battalion, Victoria Rifles, a unit who had seen some of the devastating fighting at the Somme – at Thiepval, Flers Courcelette and Ancre Heights. They had been involved in the disastrous attack on Regina Trench on 1 October 1916, and were in need of men to fill their depleted ranks. James arrived on 13 October, as the battalion was relieved from their front-line duties. In fact, the subsequent winter was free from any major operations for the Canadian Corps, and James would have had a relatively “easy” time in his first months. In a series of letters home, addressed to his “Mamma” James assured his family he was well and “fit as a pig”. He often requested smoking and chewing tobacco, mentioned the many boxes of goodies received from home, including bottled lobster. At Christmas he received a box from the wife of his former platoon officer, Saint John native Lieutenant Arthur Gilmour. Mrs. Gilmour had sent a gift to each of the original platoon members. James had noted that Lte. Gilmour was deeply saddened to be parted from his men, moved to tears at their separation. 25-year-old Lte. Arthur Gilmour transferred to the Royal Flying Corps as an Observer in 1917 and unfortunately was lost over German territory in March 1918.\n\nIn the winter of 1917, a major attack was in the plans and those months were spent in preparing for an assault that would become infused with myth and lore: the attack on Vimy Ridge. The Canadian Corps had come under the capable command of General Sir Julien Byng (later Viscount Byng of Vimy) and Canadian Lieutenant-General Sir Arthur Currie, whose meticulous planning resulted in the stunning victory over the formerly impregnable German stronghold on Vimy’s slopes.\n\nIt was a nasty, squally Easter Monday, 9 April 1917, when the Canadian Corps attacked. The 24th Battalion and James Gilmore, were posed to attack up the shallower slopes of the Ridge directly in front of the town of Neuville St. Vaast. A hot meal and a tot of rum in their bellies, the troops were in place by 4am, many in the former mine tunnels dug deep in the chalk. At 5:30am, nearly 1000 guns barked out, laying down the creeping barrage behind which the Canadian troops marched up the Ridge. Every three minutes the guns would lift the line of fire 100 yards and the soldiers would surge forward following the grey-white puffs of shrapnel, leaping over shell holes, barbed wire entanglements and destroyed trench lines. They faced hand-to-hand combat and machine gun fire, but at 6:15am, exactly on schedule, they had reached their objective, the Black Line. While the fighting continued for days more, the majority of Vimy Ridge was captured that day, and it had become very clear to the Germans by mid-morning, that they had lost. What wasn’t clear was where James Gilmore had gone.\n\nHe was reported missing on the 2 May; three months later they concluded he had died in the action that snowy, sleety Easter morning. Canadian casualties numbered 10,600, of which nearly 3600 died, either that day or later of wounds. For three long months, Sandy and Lydia prayed and hoped to hear word their son was safe, only to have their hopes dashed with the follow-up telegram and perhaps a handwritten letter of condolence – small comfort that that would have been. Lydia, obviously a well-educated and well-read woman, poured out her grief in a poem that still hangs, framed, beside James’ photograph in the family home in Grand Manan. I saw the photo and the poem in person – James’ great-nephew is a friend – and I was honoured to have made a visit to Vimy Ridge, to walk that now-peaceful and hallowed ground up to Allward’s stunningly beautiful monument where James’ name is inscribed.\n\nOur Darling Soldier Boy by L.J.

How much pain would their hard-working farmer father have felt?\n\nEmil Rydberg was an 18-year-old with big dreams when he moved from his hometown of Alingsas, Vestergotland, Sweden to the United States in 1881. He married 14-year-old Jenny Era from Missouri and soon had two blue-eyed, blond sons, Roy Weldon and Ray Victor. Emil worked as a driller, presumably in the zinc mines of Missouri, but in December 1901, Jennie died, leaving her 7- and 5-year-old sons in their father’s care. In 1904, Emil uprooted his life once again, moved his family to Alberta, Canada and took up farming. In 1907, he married an ex-pat English girl, Caroline, from the farm next door, and Ray and Roy soon had a small herd of half-siblings: Annie (1908), Selma (1910) and little Emil (1913). Roy would, however, never meet the youngest of his sisters, Mary (1916) and Jean (1919).\n\nRoy was only 16 years old when he applied for a parcel of land of his own, declaring his intention of becoming a British citizen; Canadian citizenship was still nearly 40 years in the future. In 1914, he was still unmarried and so he ventured into Calgary to sign up with the 103rd Calgary Rifles in September 1914, in time to train in Valcartier, PQ and sail on – appropriately enough – the SS Scandinavian with the First Canadian Contingent. In Salisbury, Roy got into a bit of trouble, earning 14 days’ detention while at Sling Plantation, but that wasn’t an uncommon occurrence for the rowdy Canadian troops. Roy was transferred into the 10th Canadian Infantry Battalion, and in April 1915 was in the Ypres area. On the history-making day of 22 April 1915, the 10th was in Divisional Reserve in the town of Ypres, having been sent there on the 19th. Two of the battalion majors and a captain were riding from Elverdinge, 6km northwest of Ypres, to Breilen, when they noticed a “peculiar” coloured cloud – described in the war diary as “greyish, yellowish, greenish” and dark – hanging low to the ground. It was the German release of chlorine gas, the first large-scale, successful gas attack of the war. The French territorial troops in its path had no idea what was happening and no chance at all.\n\nView of the area where Kitchener’s Wood used to be. The 10th Battalion attacked across this field; hundreds of Canadians died in this spot. (photo author’s collection)\n\nAt the same time, the shelling of Ypres had intensified, the Germans using what was noted as their “heaviest of guns”. At 5:20pm, Roy’s 10th Battalion was told to report to Weiltje, a small village NE of Ypres, deeper in the Salient. They arrived at 7:45pm and were given orders to take back Kitchener’s Wood and its captured British guns from the Germans. At 10:47pm, the 10th was lined up waiting for the 16th Battalion to join them. The moon was full enough that the woods and the fields they must cross were clearly visible. An hour later the order to advance came. Fifteen hundred men, shoulder to shoulder, walked across the dark fields. Not a sound was heard but the “soft pad of feet and the knock of bayonet scabbards against thighs” wrote Major D.M. Ormond in the battalion war diary. Halfway across, the men found a hedge and the sound of them breaking through “brought on a hail of bullets”. A moment’s panic, and the Canadians burst out running, but their close formation – a hold-over from 18th century battles – meant casualties were massive. Despite this, they took the woods, recaptured the guns but it was futile. HUndreds of yards deep into the enemy lines, surrounded on three sides, their position was untenable. Destroying the guns, they retreated and entrenched just south of the woods; the cost of their attack was terrible. At 6:30am on the 23rd, it was noted that out of 816 “other ranks” (all those lower than officer rank), there were 188 men left – Roy one of them. The 16th faired little better, having 263 other ranks left. Only 5 officers were left in each battalion.\n\nThe Brooding Soldier Monument to the First Canadian Division at St. Julien (photo author’s collection)\n\nWhat remained of the 10th fought on that day where they had dug in, and on the 24th of April, were moved to Gravenstafel Ridge, halfway between St. Julien and Passchendaele. By the 25th, the battalion had no senior officers left, no one to keep the war diary updated, but we do know they saw continuous action. On the 29th of April, they were pulled back and took up a position on the west bank of the Yser Canal just south of a regimental aid station in a make-shift bunker, manned by then-Major John McCrae who would in the coming days pen the most famous and popular poem of the war. On 1 May 1915, the remnants of the 10th Battalion endured heavy shelling and heavy casualties, and still Roy survived. But his time was limited, and just two days later, on 3 May 1915, under another bout of heavy shelling, Roy was killed. The same day McCrae took pen to paper. Roy was laid to rest in what became Essex Farm Cemetery, and where today, a monument is erected to McCrae’s poem, In Flander’s Fields.\n\nMonument at Essex Farm (photo author’s collection)\n\nAnd what of the other Rydberg brother? Ray, who went by Victor, was listed as a farmer but may have been part of the Royal Northwest Mounted Police (later to become the RCMP). He finally enlisted in May of 1918. While he made it to England, as part of the Canadian Reserve Cavalry Regiment, he was struck down by pneumonia and discharge with asthma, arriving home a year later. He never made it to the Front. It seems Victor became unsettled in life and fell into bootlegging. In 1920, at just 24 years old, he was shot and killed by police near the American border. His despairing father and step-mother had to fight the American authorities to retrieve his body. An article documenting the event seems to have mixed him up with his brother Roy, placing Victor incorrectly in the 10th Battalion. Emil had lost both his sons from his first marriage, and his three youngest children would never know or remember either of their older brothers.\n\nThe Gales of November Came Early\n\n15 February 2024\n\nPrivate Edward James Christy\n\nEvery Canadian – at least those over a certain age – feels deeply when they hear these words sung:\n\nThe legend lives on from the Chippewa on down\n\nOf the big lake they call Gitche Gumee\n\nThe lake, it is said, never gives up her dead\n\nWhen the skies of November turn gloomy\n\nWith a load of iron ore twenty-six thousand tons more\n\nThan the Edmund Fitzgerald weighed empty\n\nThat good ship and true was a bone to be chewed\n\nWhen the gales of November came early[1]\n\nAnd what does the 1975 wreck of an American ship in a November storm on Lake Superior have to do with a soldier killed in the First World War? Edward James Christy was a survivor of the worst – if not the most famous – November gale to hit the Great Lakes. And perhaps that gave him an overly optimistic view of his chances of surviving a war.\n\nThere is very little information available about this young man, aged only 23 when he died. His parents, it seems, registered neither his nor his sister Lillian’s birth; she registered her own at age 71 in 1966. If Edward had more siblings, I can’t find them, but I suspect not. There is no record of his parent’s marriage, or Edward’s. It seems his local newspaper knew of one, even though Edward denied being married on his attestation papers. What we do know is he was born 6 August 1892 to Hugh and Nellie (Sullivan) Christy; Lillian came along three years later. Blue-eyed and blond, he must have been his parent’s delight, their literal “fair-haired child”.\n\nThe family lived in the Barrie, Ontario area but it seems later Nellie was living in Collingwood on the shores of beautiful Georgian Bay, Lake Huron. In 1908, Hugh, a plasterer, died at age 44 of pulmonary TB, perhaps from years of breathing plaster dust, leaving 16-year-old Edward as head of the family. In 1915, Edward’s profession was listed as a steward, on a ship plying the Great Lakes presumably, and I also assume he was working as such, or at least some position on board, two years earlier.\n\nThe Great Lakes are so unfathomably large and deep – carrying over 20% of the world’s fresh water supply – they act like seas, and with hundreds of miles of open water, the winds can build the waves into monsters. When the cold north winds start to blow over the still-warm water of the lakes, the result is the Great Lakes’ famous “gales of November”. In 1913, two fronts collided to create the deadliest lake storm in recorded history, a blizzard with hurricane-force winds that killed 250 people, sank 19 ships and stranded 19 others, and dumped many feet of “lake-effect” snow. Called the “Big Blow”, the “Freshwater Fury” and the “White Hurricane” by the press, winds topped 140kph and the lakes saw waves up to 11 metres. Somewhere in this storm, Edward was on board ship, was one of the lucky ones and survived. His mother was probably incredibly relieved to have her son safely home after that!\n\nIn January 1915, with the First Contingent of men not yet at the Front, Edward decided to sign up for the war. Perhaps his adventure of two years before gave him a taste for more. Perhaps life seemed a little dull compared to the excitement of travel to Europe and a little fighting. He ventured to Sarnia, Ontario and on 28 January 1915 passed his medical exams. At 5’ 6”, he wasn’t terribly tall – he’d never make a gunner – but was of average height for the time and fit. He was signed on to the 34th Battalion and set sail from Montreal on the SS Hesperion on 17 August 1915. On arriving in Shorncliffe, he was placed in the 9th Reserve Battalion. Hundreds of thousands of Canadians – the ones that came after the First Contingent – spent their first months of overseas training in the lush, bucolic fields around Folkestone and lived in the army camp at Shorncliffe. It must have been beautiful that late summer and fall. But all good things come to an end, and on 3 January 1916, Edward finally made it to the trenches, joining Jim Johnstone in the 2nd Battalion, then in the Messine area, near Wulverghem, Heuvelland, Belgium. Over the next few weeks, the battalion was rotating in and out of the front line, but always in this location, marked D1 to D4 in the war diary. I was able to match these locations to current maps and visited the exact site. Now it is a quiet, peaceful place of rolling fields, small stands of trees, the steeple of the church in Mesen (Messine) easily visible. Then, the Germans were in lines a few hundred yards away, and raising your head to look at that steeple would have risked a sniper’s bullet. But it wasn’t the enemy who ended Edward’s war. He took care of that himself.\n\nIn the FWW, hand grenades were called “bombs” and special training courses were held to learn how to make and throw them. By 1917, they were standard kit for Canadians, but this was early 1916, and the armies had only been issued them late in 1915. Perhaps Edward was given one, perhaps he’d had some bomb training. Perhaps he picked it up thinking it was a lark to have one. Either way, he stuck it in his pocket, and somehow, while Edward was on sentry duty, it detonated. Despite immediate medical care, and despite being rushed to the No.8 Casualty Clearing Center, where teams of surgeons had state of the art surgical units, Edward died of his wounds. Abdominal wounds, of which this most likely was, had a more than 50% mortality rate.\n\nMrs. Christy’s fair-haired child’s luck had run out after just seven weeks at the Front.\n\nEdward is buried at the Bailleul Communal Cemetery Extension, in Bailleul, France, 14.5km southwest of Ypres.\n\n[1] Gordon Lightfoot “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald”\n\nA Tale of Two James\n\n12 December 2023\n\nPrivate James Ward Maxwell/Sidey\n\nJames W. Johnstone and James W. Maxwell. They were both in the 2nd Battalion, occupying a quiet line of trenches just northeast and up a slight rise from R.E. Farm cemetery. Maxwell fell the day after Johnstone: the 23rd of February 1916. Neither were mentioned in the battalion war diary as having given up their lives, but James Maxwell was accorded even less attention (if possible) than Jim Johnstone. The war diary coldly states “Day very quiet. Nothing of note.” James Maxwell – somehow, I do feel he went by Jimmy – was not nothing. Maxwell, like many of the first Canadians to enlist was British born, in Edinburgh, Scotland to be precise. And Maxwell was not his real name.\n\nJames Johnstone (left) and James Maxwell (right)\n\nJames Ward Sidey came to Canada in 1911 with his father William Sidey, and brothers John, Robert, and Thomas, from Dublin, Ireland. He left behind a sister Isabella and his mother, also Isabella, who had remarried a man named William Maxwell. The Sideys joined James’ older brother William Charles who had come to Toronto, Ontario in 1908. James worked as a painter and in 1914 was care-free and single.\n\nAt the outbreak of the war in August 1914, brother Robert likely left for the UK to enlist with the BEF, as there seems to be no Canadian records. He was killed in January 1915 in action, before the Canadian First Contingent (excepting the Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry) got to the Front, which goes somewhat to confirm this. On the 26th of January 1915, James signed on, too, perhaps because of his brother, but using his stepfather’s last name – Maxwell – and giving their address in Dublin for his next-of-kin. He assigned his pay to his mother.\n\nAt 5’ 3” and a slight 125 pounds, James was unlikely to have been accepted in the first round of recruiting. However, he was accepted into the 34th Battalion that January and began training. From the very beginning, he proved full of high-spirits, or just plain defiance, or maybe it was the beautiful summer weather. On six occasions between May and August of 1915, he was deducted pay for misdeeds, and served 5 days in detention on one occasion, and 96 hours on another. He hadn’t even left the country, yet! On the 23rd of October 1915, he finally sailed for England. At this point, James was transferred into the 9th Battalion, Jim Johnstone’s original one, which was in reserve in England. Sidey was not done with his bad behaviour, though. In December 1915, he decided to travel to Dublin to visit his family there, whom he hadn’t seen in 4 years most likely, so one can’t blame him, being the Christmas season and all! However, James had no leave and was 14 days “Absent without Leave”; he lost 17 days’ pay.\n\nJust before Christmas, James Sidey finally was transferred into the 2nd Battalion and on the 3rd of January 1916, arrived at the Front. For the 2nd Battalion, this was a line of trenches just north of the tiny village of Wulverghem, Heuvelland, Belgium, within sight of Mount Kemmel and the Messine Ridge where 19 mines would be blown in 1917, one of the largest non-nuclear explosions and considered then the loudest man-made noise in history. Six of these mines were never used; one exploded in 1955 after a lightning strike, one sits currently under a farm and is still a danger to the family living there.\n\nLooking east from the approximate line of the 2nd Bn trenches in February 1916, toward Messine Ridge (Mesen).\n\nJim Johnstone was on leave in London when Sidey arrived to join the battalion, and in his own words, was not much interested in meeting new people at that point anyway. He had lost so many friends, it seemed pointless to make new ones. The two James’ perhaps never met or interacted much. How ironic that they would die a day apart – Johnstone having served a year at the front, Sidey 7 weeks – and lie forever side by side, companions in death if not life.\n\nJohn William Sidey, James’ oldest brother, on hearing of the loss of a second brother at the front, said “I am going now.” At 35, John was getting a bit long in the tooth, and while his attestation papers were signed in March of 1916, he was discharged in August as medically unfit, with the comment that he should never have passed the medical to begin with. A newspaper clipping mentions two other brothers in khaki. I found one: William Charles, who also gave a false name, Wallace this time, and his father as William Wallace, when he enlisted in December 1915. William, a sapper, was gassed and in hospital in Etaples in May 1918 when he was further wounded in the air raid on the Canadian hospital which killed 66 staff and patients, including two Canadian nursing sisters. William never returned to the front, being discharged in October 1918. James’ father was denied his War gratuity for deceased soldiers, having been granted money for William. Of the fifth brother “in the ranks” – presumably Thomas – there is no evidence he signed up in Canada under the name of Sidey. Perhaps he, too, used an alias.\n\nA Pilgrimage to the Sacred Lands\n\n8 – 14 November 2023\n\nA dream came true this November, when I finally made my long-delayed trip to the Ypres Salient and paid a visit to Jim Johnstone. It absolutely was a pilgrimage, a journey of remembrance. A person cannot travel the roads of northern France and Belgium without being struck forcefully by the world’s loss in young men. Who knows what they may have accomplished, had they lived?\n\nWe flew into Paris early in the morning, and rented a car, immediately setting out for the Front. Stops that first day included Thiepval, Beaumont-Hamel and Vimy, before arriving in Ypres. In the pouring rain, we attended the daily 8pm ceremony at Menin Gate. Unfortunately, the Gate is undergoing a 2-year restoration project and is completely shrouded from view. Despite this, the scale of its size was breathtaking and humbling; it is so much larger than I had thought. I did manage to peer in a few cracks to see some of the panels! Remembrance Day at the Menin Gate was an experience never to be forgotten. The dedication to honouring our fallen by the Last Post Association volunteers is unprecedented and unwavering; they celebrated their 33,000th ceremony this fall, and have daily honoured the 55,000 men named on the Gate since 1928 (other than during the German occupation of Ypres during WWII).\n\nOver the next days, we visited the Brooding Soldier, Essex Farm, Langemarck German cemetery, Ploegsteert and Jim. We saw Hill 62, Sanctuary Wood, Hill 60, Tyne Cot cemetery, Sint Eloi, Mt. Kemel, Messine Ridge, and Passchendaele where we took part in the November 10th commemorative walk. As a side trip, we drove to Boulogne, where the many hospitals were based, Wimereax Cemetery, Calais, Dunkirk – site of the miraculous evacuation of British troops in 1940 – and Bruges (highly recommend!). We visited many, many cemeteries, from which I chose at random a Canadian soldier. These men will be featured here over the coming weeks and months.\n\nHe Will Not Return To Me\n\n23 August 2023\n\nLieutenant Daniel Lionel Teed, MC\n\nHe’d followed in his brother, Hugh’s footsteps, attending Rothesay Collegiate School and the Royal Military College in Kingston, Ontario, and in January 1916, he again joined his brother, enlisting in the Canadian Expeditionary Force as a Lieutenant. Daniel Lionel Teed – who went by Lionel – would also follow his brother in sacrifice. M. Gerald and Margaret Teed would endure the heartbreak of losing a second son just two months before Armistice, when the end of the war was firmly in sight and the Canadians were storming through German defenses in the Hundred Days Offensive that would help win the war.\n\nLionel was the Teed family’s third son, born 12 October 1893 and still a student living at home when he enlisted in the 36th Battery, Canadian Field Artillery. Tall like his brother, he wore his uniform with dash: jodhpurs, leather puttees and polished spurs, a riding crop in hand rather than a stick. Two months later, 13 March 1916, he sailed for England on the S.S. Missanabie, the same ship brother Hugh had traveled on when home on medical leave the previous summer. After attending a Howitzer course at Bramshott, Lionel embarked for France on 13 July 1916 and set up with the 36th Battery in one of the “hot spots”, in the Ypres Salient. Within 24 hours, they came under very heavy shelling, quite a trial by fire. In August, they were transferred to Kemmel, a quieter area, then in October 1916 headed for the Somme. One thousand yards behind the lines at Courcelette, the battery was still the target for their counterparts on the German side, but their Commanding officer, Major Daniel A. MacKinnon proudly stated they returned 100 shells for every one that came their way. In April 1917, Lionel participated in the attack on Vimy Ridge, his battery part of an unprecedented nearly 1000-gun barrage that opened the battle.\n\nTrench fever felled Lionel in the late spring of 1917. Spread by the ubiquitous lice, it caused high fever, headaches, abdominal and bone pain. Treatable now (it is found among the urban homeless population) by antibiotics, then a man suffered through until it ran its course.\n\nIt was in August 1917, while engaged at the battle for Hill 70, that Lionel was severely wounded by a brand new and particularly vile form of chemical warfare: mustard gas. Mustard gas, “the king of battlefield gases” was, unlike chlorine or phosgene gas, an irritant rather than an inhaled gas, in that it caused severe blistering of skin, eyes and other mucous membranes. It could soak into the soldier’s uniforms and burn their skin or those who came to help them: fellow soldiers, the nurses and doctors who undressed the casualties. Gas masks were nearly useless against it. It would be weeks before Lionel rejoined his unit… in time to return to the hell hole of mud that was the Ypres Salient and the battle of Passchendaele.\n\nBy March 1918, the 36th Battery was back in France and defending Arras against the German Spring Offensive. The battery took a pummeling by an estimated 2000 German shells but as MacKinnon wrote “Some brave deeds were carried out by members of the battery…”. Lionel was awarded a Military Cross (MC). The German attacks had failed, and the demoralized army was soon under fierce pressure. Beginning 8 August 1918, Canada’s Hundred Days Offensive began: first the Germans were pushed out of their lines at Amiens, then the Drocourt- Queant Line; the Canadians crossed Canal-du-Nord, liberated Cambrai and finally, on the last day of the war, Mons where it all began for the British in August 1914. Sadly, Lionel would not see these final successes.\n\n1 September 1918, the 36th Battery was ordered to blow the barbed wire at the Hindenburg Line and given 4000 rounds to do so. Their position was exposed, observed by enemy balloons. Their shells were falling short, so Lionel telephoned Major MacKinnon with this observation. Thinking he was not getting through, Lionel decided to run down to the No 2 gun to pass on the information to MacKinnon, the kind of brave, selfless action that likely earned him his MC. No sooner did he arrived at the gun when a German shell hit directly. Lionel, Sergeant MacKay, and Gunner John Cornfoot were killed instantly. MacKinnon called this one of the saddest blows in the 36th Battery’s entire war experience. Lionel Teed was, he said, one of the best, a brave, extremely clever officer and loved by all. But the war did not stop for fallen soldiers, not with victory in sight, and the battery moved on with the tide until the end. Lionel is buried at the Monchy-le-Preux Cemetery, Pas de Calais.\n\nTwice in his service record, Lionel was appointed “acting Captain”, meaning he was temporarily serving in the role in place of another officer, rather than being permanently promoted to the rank.\n\nLionel’s oldest brother, John, welcomed a 4th son in December 1918. He named the little boy Daniel Lionel in his uncle’s memory. John’s previous son, born in June 1917, had been named Hugh Mariner. Lionel and Hugh’s sister Emily would also welcome a son in 1923; he was named Lionel Mariner in honour of both the lost Teed brothers.\n\nTo Live In The Hearts We Leave Behind Is Not To Die\n\n14 August 2023\n\nLieutenant Hugh Mariner Teed\n\nHe was tall, a handsome young man who wore his meticulous officer’s uniform and neatly clipped mustache well. His square, dimpled chin was at home with his upright posture. No doubt he was at ease in that uniform having been a cadet at the Royal Military College. His manners were those of gentleman; his father, a well-to-do barrister and King’s Council, had sent his sons to be educated at one of Canada’s elite boarding schools. It is little wonder the daughter of a postman was swept off her feet. In January 1915, Violet M. Stacey married a dashing Canadian officer, Lieutenant Hugh Mariner Teed, who had only arrived in the Salisbury area three months before as a member of the First Canadian Contingent. A week after the wedding, he was sent to the trenches. How well did she really know her husband? How could she know what would become of the confident young man she had, in all innocence, capriciously married?\n\nHugh Teed was born on 21 January 1892 in Dorchester, New Brunswick, and grew up in the port city of Saint John in an elegant three-story brick home in an upscale neighbourhood. He attended Rothesay Collegiate School in the nearby community of Rothesay, NB, home to the province’s oldest and most wealthy families. Hugh was at home in Saint John, working as a civil engineer when war was declared in August 1914, and he immediately joined at the rank of lieutenant. He trained at Valcartier, PQ, and shipped overseas to England in October 1914, where the Canadians would spend the winter of 1914/15 in camps on Salisbury Plain. The soldiers and officers spent much time in the surrounding villages, and it is likely Hugh and Violet met while she was a cashier in a local book shop, a job she was doing as recently as 1911, according to the census. War gives great urgency; hasty marriages were common in the 1914/1918 conflict. Hugh, age 23, and Violet, 21, married on 30 January 1916, knowing he would soon be sent into the fighting. Indeed, Hugh proceeded to France on 7 February 1916 with the 1st Infantry Brigade, completely unprepared for what he was about to face.\n\nApril, May and June 1915 were truly a baptism by fire for the fledgling Canadian Division. First came the Second Battle of Ypres in which the Germans launched the first large scale gas attack of the war and might have overwhelmed the Ypres Salient but for 18,000 untested Canadians. Casualties were an appalling 6035 men, of which 2000 were killed. This was followed in May and June, by bloodbaths at Festubert and Givenchy; another 2900 were killed or wounded in these battles. Hugh was traumatized; his mind was broken.\n\nOn 26 June 1915, Hugh was admitted to hospital as NYD: Not Yet Diagnosed. The physicians of the Canadian Army Medical Corp (CAMC) were being confronted with a new mental disease that was to cause much controversy. We now call it Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD); it would then come to be called shell shock or neurasthenia. While the term shell shock was used as early as February 1915, it quickly fell out of favour and by May of 1915, Dr. Aldren Turner described it as a “…form of temporary ‘nervous breakdown’, exactly what was written in Hugh’s records. By July 1915, and having been sent to hospital in England, the medical boards decided Hugh had had a nervous breakdown.\n\nWhile officers were given more leeway than the other ranks, this would have been hugely stigmatizing. The military felt the term “shellshock” legitimized what amounted to malingering and cowardice. Decisions in labeling and treating it were made, like many others, in an effort to get men back in the trenches, reduce the numbers invalided out of the trenches, and, in the long run, reduce the monetary liability of the government for post-war pensions. In fact, the term “shell shock” was disallowed in military and medical reports by 1916. The result was that sufferers often went from objects of sympathy, to ones of contempt.\n\nBy his medical board hearing in August of 1915, perhaps in recognition of the stigma, Hugh’s debility was now referred to as “anemia”. He complained of shortness of breath and “extreme weakness”. Blood work found his cell counts low. He was found unfit for even light duties and granted leave home to Canada from 12 August to 11 October 1915. This leave was extended to 15 November 1915. Violet joined her husband in Canada on 29 August, travelling to the family’s summer home in Dorchester, Rocklyn, a mansion built in 1831 by Father of Confederation, Edward Barron Chandler.\n\nRocklyn/Chandler House\n\nThe couple returned to England together on 22 November 1915. Perhaps those long months in peace, at home, went some way to healing Hugh’s trauma, but how difficult was it for him to face his return to the war?\n\nIn December 1915, Hugh was appointed acting Captain, and in January was cleared as fit for general duty. He was not returned to the front, however. Hugh bounced around for several months, from HQ in Shorncliffe to a training camp at Bramshott, and staff duties with the 17th reserve battalion. Not until 30 August 1916 was Hugh finally sent back to France, attached to the 2nd Battalion in the field. Two weeks later he was off teaching a grenade course for three weeks, having been appointed the Battalion Bombing Officer.\n\nHugh may not have been a prolific letter writer; his last letter to his family was on 23 November 1916. In it he seems very cheerful, happy to be at the front fighting, calling the sights over the war-torn ground “wonderful”. He described a rescue mission to the enemy line to bring back the wounded and dead, and was looking forward to his leave in December, ten days in England.\n\nLetter to his father, dated 23 November 1916\n\nIt’s impossible to know Hugh’s mental state at this point. PTSD isn’t easily treated or cured, that we do know, and a return to the front would have been triggering for him. What we do know is on 9 January 1917, only 24 years old, Hugh died by “accident”. His circumstances of death register – registers Sip to Z all together – have not survived. We will never know if he was fatally injured by “friendly fire”, by an unfortunate mishap with a grenade during training (most likely) or worse. The family were told, or chose to believe, he was “killed in action” and they were not wrong. Hugh Teed deserves to be remembered with compassion, and to be honoured for his sacrifice, as much as any of the men killed by enemy fire.\n\nHugh’s “death penny”, the memorial plaque issued to families, has been embedded in the family memorial stone.\n\n“To live in the hearts we leave behind is not to die.”\n\n– epitaph on Hugh’s gravestone in Bruay Cemetery, Pas de Calais, France\n\nCapturing the Hangstellung\n\n11 August 2023\n\nMost Canadians have heard of the Easter Monday attack that captured (much of) Vimy Ridge on 9 April 1917. Some have heard of the longer time it took to capture Hill 145, where the now-iconic Canadian memorial stands today, and the final attack to capture the “Pimple” on 12 April that completed the objective. Fewer still may have read of a small but essential skirmish on 10 April, in which the Canadians fought downhill, off Hill 145, to capture the German-occupied Hangstellung, a line of trenches at the bottom of the hill. In the late afternoon, the 44th and 50th Battalions followed a creeping barrage into heavy shelling from the Germans. “Down went a dozen of Canada’s finest chaps in the first 60 seconds” according to Private Victor Wheeler of the 50th Battalion. One of those who died on the second day at Vimy was 27-year-old Lieutenant, and new father, Guy Randolph Yerxa. I’ll admit feeling a special poignancy for this story: Guy was my 2nd cousin, twice removed.\n\nGuy was born in Fredericton, New Brunswick on 15 February 1890, son of Randolph K Yerxa and Mary E Torrens. Guy was 12 when his father died at only 38 years old while away from home working in Massachusetts. Eight years later, tragedy would strike the family, when Guy’s older brother Roy, then 22 years old, died. A tall young man with striking colouring – bright blue eyes and dark hair – Guy worked first for the Royal Bank in Fredericton before transferring out west. By 1914, he was working as a government surveyor in Calgary.\n\nIn December 1914, the former militia member (71st Battalion in Fredericton) signed on when the 50th Battalion began recruiting in Calgary and was quickly assigned as Regimental clerk. The 50th would remain in Calgary for much of the next year, and it was during this time that Guy married 17-year-old Louise M. King, living with her family in the upcoming neighbourhood of Parkdale on the Bow River. When Guy was shipped out in the fall of 1915, Louise was pregnant. Little Randolph was born in March 1916. Guy would have received the happy news in England where the battalion was stationed, and he was promoted to Company Sergeant Major then commissioned as a Lieutenant. He completed a training course in July and in August 1916 the battalion finally embarked for France.\n\nGuy’s first real taste of battle was part of the larger Somme campaign, more specifically the Battle of Ancre Heights. This disputed ground was southeast of Beaumont-Hamel, between Thiepval and Courcelette. The battalion had arrived in the area in early October, having spent August and September north of the area as part of an amalgamated Allied unit. The 50th was involved in the renewed attempts to capture Regina and Desire Trenches in November. At this time Guy was appointed adjutant, becoming a staff officer assisting with unit administration. This was not merely a backroom position as Guy would see action in the trenches.\n\nThe 4th Canadian Division, of which Guy’s 50th Battalion was a part, joined the rest of the Canadian Corps north in Artois in November 1917. The winter of 1916/17 was mostly free of large-scale operations, but rather kept the Canadians raiding, and training for the planned offensive at Vimy. In March 1917, in what might have been a raid to collect prisoners and information, Guy led a group of men to the enemy line under heavy fire. Later he organized the rescue of the wounded. For this “conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty” he was awarded the Military Cross (MC). It is unlikely Guy knew anything about it, as the award was not authorized by Sir Julien Byng, Commander of the Canadian Corps, until May 1917.\n\nGuy’s story was edging toward its end. He’d turned 27, and enjoyed a long leave, likely in England far from the fighting. Now he and the Canadian Corps were facing a monumental task: the taking of what hundreds of thousands of French and British soldiers had failed to take, Vimy Ridge. The battle itself is too complicated for a short blog post. It has entered the realm of myth, a legend of nation-building, and Canadian unity, grit, and determination. I highly recommend Dr. Tim Cook’s book on the subject for anyone who wants to learn more. In it he states: “There were many ways to be killed on Vimy Ridge.” Victor Wheeler described men “impaled like grotesque scarecrows” or “scattered… in gruesome fragments”. The operation that took Guy’s life hardly rates a mention in most descriptions of the battle and only one page in Cook’s hefty tome. Like many others, Guy’s death was swift and unmarked by many other than his mother, who had now lost her husband and her only two sons, and his young widow. Of Guy himself nothing was ever found to recover and bury properly. His only monument is Allward’s masterpiece on Hill 145.\n\nLouise King Yerxa received Guy’s MC medal in a presentation by the Lieutenant-Governor of Alberta in June 1917. She later forwarded it on to Guy’s mother, Mary, small solace for the gaping hole in her life. Louise remarried in 1922. Of their son Randolph there is not much information. It appears he lived until 1981, dying in the US where he moved to marry his third wife, after two divorces in 12 years. There is no evidence he ever visited or met his grandmother, Mary who died in 1951.\n\nTwo Brothers, Three Telegrams\n\n28 June 2023\n\nFrederick (L) and James (R) Manning\n\nThey were the first and second-born sons of Dr. James and Helen Manning’s five children. Their father was a prominent and well-respected city dentist; their mother, the niece of Sir Samuel Leonard Tilley, Premier and Lieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick, as well as member of Sir John A. MacDonald’s first federal government. They grew up on a street of elegant brick and stone homes, most of them constructed after the 1877 fire that had burned two fifths of the city. A live in servant cared for their needs. Fred was the oldest, named for his mother’s brother, and James came along 19 months later. No doubt the brothers were close companions growing up. Both were dark haired with brown eyes; Fred stood five inches taller – the big brother in all respects – at nearly 5’11”. Both enlisted and were commissioned as Lieutenants in 1916 and both fought at the Battle of Vimy Ridge. Only one came home.\n\nFrederick Charles Manning was born on 24 July, 1895 just a year after his parents’ marriage. A bright boy, he graduated at the head of his class at Saint John High School, and promptly headed to Fredericton to the Normal School where he achieved the top classification for a teacher’s license. Fred, only 18, then took over teaching at the school in Fredericton Junction. A year later, he enrolled in Arts at Acadia University, Wolfville, Nova Scotia, perhaps to upgrade his teaching qualifications. It was here that Fred took command of the C.O.T.C. and where a recruiter for the 219th Highland Battalion of NS came calling in early 1916. Fred immediately stepped up, the first in the university to do so, according to an article in the Saint John newspapers. Fred arrived at Aldershot Camp, NS, in May 1916 for training. By June, his “ability was recognized and he was promoted” to a commission. After the summer in Nova Scotia, his battalion headed overseas, sailing from Halifax on the S.S. Olympic on 12 October 1916, and landing in Liverpool a week later. His next four months were spent in England, the training a seemingly endless process, but on 9 February 1917, Lieutenant Frederick Manning was taken on strength by the 85th Battalion and on the 10th was finally on his way to France.\n\nJames Harold Manning, born 15 February 1897, took a different path than his older brother. He was determined to follow in his father’s footsteps, and so enrolled in the same dental school in Pennsylvania as James Senior. Like his father, he had served in the 62nd St. John Fusiliers, where his father had made a name for himself as a marksman, even competing in 1890 at the prestigious Bisley shooting competition in the UK. It is unsurprising after his first year completed and with his older brother enlisted, that James came home to do the same.\n\nIn June 1916, he joined the 140th Battalion. This path led him to Valcartier for training. Oddly, he made it to England months before Fred, sailing on the same ship as his brother would, the S.S. Olympic, on 18 August 1916. I have to wonder if the brothers had any opportunity to visit each other; I certainly hope so.\n\nJames, promoted to Lieutenant as well, was sent to the Crowborough Military School for an advanced Field Officer course. He was attached to the RCR and the PPCLI, taken on strength of the 144th which was absorbed into the 18th Reserve Battalion before finally being drafted into the 52nd Battalion on 10 February 1917, following his brother to France two days later. Quite a convoluted path!\n\nBoth brothers were now on an inexorable path leading to one of the biggest battles in Canadian history, that at Vimy Ridge, and surprisingly both survived the initial assault on Easter Monday 9 April 1917 even though Fred’s 85th was at one of the worst ends of the ridge, at the well-fortified Hill 145 where the memorial now stands. They would have known about the victory but perhaps unaware of the sensation it was causing at home. After the incredible tension and anticipation leading up to this attack, the following days might have seemed anti-climactic, winding down to “normal”. Well, as this war has shown again and again, bad things happen when least expected.\n\nOn the 15 April 1917, a knock that no family wanted came to the door of 158 Germain St in Saint John. A telegram that surely sent hearts plummeting had arrived. James and Helen knew they had two sons in the big battle that was making the newspaper headlines. But all was not lost: Fred had been wounded and it was “serious but not dangerous”. Little did they know, it was more than that. Fred sustained a gunshot wound to the head and had a fractured femur, the long bone in the thigh. Both were life-threatening injuries. It had happened two days earlier and Fred had been whisked by the now efficient medical system to the No. 14 General Hospital south of Calais. Three days later another telegram arrived, this time with the horrible news that Fred, only 21 years old, had died of his wounds, ironically on the same day the first telegram had arrived. The blows did not stop there. The very next day, 19 April, a third telegram came. I can only speculate what the mourning family – younger siblings Laurence, Marjorie and Thomas, ages 18, 17 and 15, were still at home – thought. Perhaps it brought a piercing shaft of hope that Fred hadn’t really died. Perhaps it brought the terror that James had also died. What it said was that James was wounded, not seriously, and on the same day the first telegram had arrived.\n\nJames had taken a shrapnel wound to his left forearm and two fragments had to be surgically removed. It was a “Blighty”, one of those wounds serious enough for a long recovery but not serious enough it would risk the patient’s life moving them across the Channel. James was off for an extended stay in England at the 2nd Western General Hospital in Manchester. Four months later, on 15 August 1917, he was fit for duty and back with his unit, but not for long.\n\nOn 27 August 1917, less than two weeks since his return to the front, James led a party tasked to capture a German machine gun nest. Nine miles behind their position a British artillery unit was laying down a barrage but due to errors in their ranging, the shells fell near James’ position. The telephone wires had been cut so they were unable to message the British. A terrific explosion buried James, but he was dug out by his men. Shaking off the trauma and rounding up seven or eight others, he continued his attack, driving off the Germans and seizing their machine guns. It was this action that led Major General (then Lieutenant-Colonel) Forster, VC, to call James “a born leader of men…”\n\nAs he made his return a whizzbang, a small caliber German shell, hit within six feet of James, throwing him violently across the ground and leaving him concussed. A piece of the shell drove through the palm of his left hand, shattering the bones. James found himself back in Manchester at the 2nd Western as doctors struggled to save his hand from both the physical damage and gas gangrene, a dread result of the filth of the trenches. In the era before antibiotics, surgically opening the wounds and exposing them to air was the only way to stop gas gangrene. Not only did he have the hand injury to contend with but the site on his thigh where they had removed skin for a graft on his hand had become badly infected and he was still suffering a back injury from being thrown by the shell.\n\nBy November, the medical boards saw no hope for James’ hand, and he was medically invalided back to Canada on 19 December 1917. What a sigh of relief his family must have breathed to have him back home again. He was sent to Toronto in one last attempt to fix his hand, but James was left with a clawed hand, the fingers immovable, all their joints fused, the palm and back crossed with scars. James’ dream to follow his father into dentistry came to an end.\n\nUndeterred, James took up town planning and landscape gardening, working in Boston, before attending Harvard University. He ended up in NYC then traveled to Maturin, Venezuela as part of the engineering staff for Standard Oil. Six months into his stay in Venezuela, James caught what might have been malaria or hemorrhagic fever or both. That spring of 1924, seven years after surviving the fighting at Vimy and Lens, James Manning died at age 27. He had lived a life packed densely with experiences, almost as if he had known he would not make old bones. Despite his roaming, James never lost his nostalgia for his foggy port city home by the Bay of Fundy, writing this poem:\n\nIf I were ruler of this land with majesty complete,\n\nIf I owned all these many leagues and not a yard beside,\n\nI’d give them up without a sigh for room to place my feet,\n\nBy the fog-bank and the rain, and the sound of Fundy’s tide\n\nFollow Me to Hell\n\n19 June 2023\n\nCaptain Victor Gordon Tupper, MC\n\nHe called it the “biggest push that has ever been launched” and he had just made the German barbed wire when struck in the hip by a shell. Gordie slipped to the earth with an “expression of surprise, the faint flicker of a smile” and, according to a brother officer who witnessed it, “died within seconds”. Tragic, romantic, heroic, and, from descriptions of the young Captain, possibly true, kind of like the battle of Vimy Ridge itself.\n\nGordon Tupper was a cheerful, active, outdoorsy young man. His older brother described him as having a great love of hiking, fishing, and the unruly game of rugby. It seems little wonder that when the war began in August 1914, he immediately joined up at the tender age of 19. He enlisted as a Private and his profession was listed as chauffeur, but in fact, he came from quite an illustrious family as his last name suggests. Gordon was the 4th son and youngest of six children born to the Honorable Sir Charles Hibbert Tupper, KCMG, and Lady Janet Tupper. His father was a lawyer from Halifax, NS, who followed in Gordon’s grandfather’s political footsteps, becoming an MP, then Justice Minister, and the Solicitor General in a number of Conservative governments. Charles H had been knighted in 1893 after helping broker a deal in the Bering Sea Arbitration. Gordon was born in Ottawa on 4 February 1896 and his godmother was Lady Aberdeen, wife of the Governor-General of Canada.\n\nGordon’s grandfather was the Sir Charles Tupper, a Nova Scotia physician, politician, former Premier of the province, Father of Confederation, and 6th Prime Minister of Canada. The senior Sir Charles was a protégé and good friend of former NS Premier James William Johnston – yes, that J.W. Johnston, great-grandfather of my Private James W. Johnstone (even though the last name has a slightly different spelling!). Sir Charles Tupper, senior, has the dubious distinction of being the shortest serving Prime Minister, one who never sat in Parliament. After 68 days in the PM’s office, in May of 1896, Sir Charles was out, the Conservatives defeated. Charles Hibbert promptly moved his family all the way across the country to British Columbia, first to Victoria, then to Vancouver, where Gordon grew up, and Charles H, oddly, continued to serve as MP for Pictou, NS.\n\nIn September of 1914, Gordon found himself in Valcartier, PQ, with thousands of other eager young volunteers. Traveling from there to England in October 1914 on the S.S. Andania, he spent that winter in misery on Salisbury Plain, coming down with, as so many did, pleurisy and pneumonia. In February 1915, Gordon was left behind with the 17th Battalion in reserve as the rest of the Canadian men shipped to France. He missed the big show in Ypres in April 1915, but because of the horrific losses, was transferred to the 13th Battalion in May 1914. In July, he was transferred to the 16th Battalion, recommended for Cadet School, and by August was promoted first to Lance Corporal then temporary 2nd Lieutenant. His former commanding officers described him as brave, cool in action, and courageous, as having judgement, tact, and true leadership. It certainly would explain his meteoric rise. By October 1916, he was a Captain and in February 1917 an acting Major.\n\nTupper was initially assigned as a Transport Officer but later went to Communications. It was in this role he earned his Military Cross. Under heavy shell fire and personal peril – he was wounded – and “displaying great courage and determination” staying at his post while wounded, he kept the communication lines open between the front lines and HQ, and between the spotting officers and the artillery. In November of 1916, he was “gazetted” – written up in the London Gazette for conspicuous gallantry in action and awarded the Military Cross, the second highest decoration an officer can receive.\n\nGordon seemed genuinely to enjoy his time in the war. He wrote repeatedly to his parents not to worry about him, that while, yes, there were stressful times, they were not constant, and he had a wonderful time while away from the front. Of the Battle of Mont Sorel, he wrote: ”Really I never enjoyed two hours more in my life than when we were attacking. Wonderful excitement!” Later, he wrote: “Will you believe me when I say that I have enjoyed the last two years more than any others in my life?”\n\nIn April 1917, he wrote his parents one of those letters, his third of the war, he said. He had been “over the top” on a few occasions, but this time he would be leading his own Company, 150 officers and men, who would, “follow me to Hell, if need be.” He was proud, calling it the “most glorious day of my life” and was convinced the path to peace was through the action that we now know as the battle of Vimy Ridge. His parents were not to feel sorry for him.\n\nPromptly at 5:30am on Easter Monday, 9 April 1917, nearly 1000 guns and mortars opened up with a roar, pounding the German lines that wreathed the slopes of Vimy Ridge. Firing for three minutes, they lifted 100 yards and fired another three minutes, creating a creeping barrage, behind which poured four Divisions of Canadians. On the right, attacking toward Thelus, the 1st Division, commanded by Major-General Arthur Currie, and including the 16th Battalion and 21-year-old Captain V. Gordon Tupper, would ultimately be successful in capturing their objective, as would all the Canadian Divisions, taking the entire ridge.\n\nGordon was one of the lucky ones whose body was retrieved and properly buried at Ecoivres Military Cemetery, his stone engraved with words chosen by his parents, Be ye faithful unto death and I will give you a crown of life. The battle of Vimy has become legend, almost mythical, a fantasy of nation-building and the crowning glory of Canadian bravado. The ridge itself is home to the foremost of Canada’s war monuments, eclipsing even the National War Monument in Gordon’s birthplace, Ottawa. His name may not be on that monument and its site is not the section of ridge he assaulted in his first command, but I like to think Gordon Tupper would still be proud that the memory of so many young men who sacrificed everything are remembered there, near the place where he, in his words, “went under”.\n\nAbsent Without Leave\n\n6 June 2023\n\nHarbour, Saint John, N.B. (1929)\n\nCredit: Canada. Dept. of Interior / Library and Archives Canada / PA-049781\n\nHe was a stranger in town with few friends. Where would he go? The options were limited.\n\nNot all my stories are about men who died in glorious battle, or even men with proper attestation papers, from which we can learn much about them. John Daniel Pike never enlisted in an overseas battalion, never signed those papers on which we might see his age, his eye colour, or his hair colour to form a picture of a young Canadian. John was part of the home guard, and all we can say about him is he had a mouth full of cavities that likely would have kept him home, if indeed he did try to go overseas. That is not to say protecting Canadian soil was not an important contribution to the war effort.\n\nCanadian Defence Force Recruiting Poster. St. John Globe, April 7, 1917,\n\nIn April of 1918, the Canadian Garrison Regiment was formed to bring together the various detachments of home defense under one umbrella. In Saint John, it drew its strength in large part from the 62nd Regiment, the storied St. John Fusiliers, which had formed in 1872 (as the 62nd Battalion) and contributed members for the Boer War in South Africa. Changing its name to the 62nd Regiment in May of 1900, many members volunteered for the 26th Battalion in 1914, and as such the 62nd has been awarded a long list of First World War battle honours. Others of the 62nd had been guarding the port of Saint John, New Brunswick since the outbreak of the war.\n\nJohn Pike was not a native of Saint John, having been born and raised far to the northeast of New Brunswick in Belledune, on the Baie de Chaleur. He may even have seen the convoy of the First Contingent when they gathered there to await escort to England in the fall of 1914. John was the first of Thomas and Mary Pike’s ten children. In 1911, 17-year-old John was living on the family farm, having no stated profession. Two years later, at 19, John was working as a labourer to support his 25-year-old new bride, Mary Ella Hamilton. Their only child, a daughter Margaret Hannah, was born six months after the wedding. It was not an auspicious start to a marriage that would deteriorate.\n\nWhen John joined the 62nd Regiment is yet unknown to me. I am sure deep digging could find that information in the NB Archives, but it is mostly irrelevant to this story. I suspect it was not until late in the war that he moved to Saint John to join the home guard, as he was a relative stranger to the city in 1918. What is clear is John and Ella had parted ways and not amicably. According to Major C.J. Morgan, John had “serious family troubles”. On what must have been his transfer into the Canadian Garrison Regiment, in April 1918, he refused to sign papers transferring his pay to his wife. Further, Morgan said, without elaborating on specifics, Pike defamed his wife’s character. After “outside influence was brought to bear” – on Pike presumably – Morgan was directed to pay Ella Pike $248 on April 24th, a large sum in those days. Three days later, John was back in Morgan’s office, anxious to see if Ella had received it, perhaps hopeful she had not got all of it, and asked if he could have a share.\n\nAccording to the official records, John Pike was absorbed into the 7th C.G.R. on 1 May 1918. In fact, on the early morning of 1 May 1918, John was posted by Sergeant C. Tracey to the #3 post, 3rd relief (4:30-6:30am) on the docks on the west side of the harbour, relieving Private Frank Galley. Lying alongside of the “beat” which John was required to patrol, was a cargo ship, perhaps laying in supplies to go to an increasingly desperate England. Galley and Pike had had time to chat recently, as they sat waiting for their Medical Board examination – presumably on their transfer to the 7th – and John had discussed his desire to transfer to the 9th Siege (overseas) Battery. John may have really wanted to flee his home situation.\n\nAt 6:30am, May Day, when the sun at that time of year is well up and shining (if no rain or fog) over the harbour toward the west side docks, Private C. Daigle marched with the 1st relief to take over #3 post from Pike. The beat was empty. P. Lumsden, Corporal of the Guard that morning, not finding Pike, posted his guards then returned to report the missing soldier to the Sergeant of the Guards, Tracey. Tracey immediately went to look for himself, and soon called all the guards to search the sheds. At 7am, the news of a missing guard made its way to Lieut. J. Harris, who reported it to Major Morgan and notified the Military Police. Not a sign of John or his equipment was to be found.\n\nJust when was John Pike last seen? According to Private Earl Hawkes, who had spent the 4:30 to 6:30 guard duty at #1 post, immediately next to Pike’s post, John had been there, patrolling as required, not five or ten minutes before the relief came at 6:30. How could a man disappear that quickly, and without a trace? The immediate assumption was that John Pike had absented himself without leave. The Military Police were dispatched to search the city. Interestingly, the Saint John City Police were never briefed or asked to assist. But where could he go if he didn’t know the city and had few friends there? Neither was the coroner informed when Morgan’s thoughts turned to the idea that perhaps Pike had had an unfortunate accident and fallen off the pier into the cold and turbulent waters of the Saint John harbour; an unsuccessful grappling operation was initiated the next day, May 2nd.\n\nOn May 3rd, an inquest was held. Major George Keefe, 1st Depot Battery, Lieut. W. Colin Ewing, 9th Siege Battery, and Lieut. E. S. Cosman, 7th Bn, C.G.R. presided. After the testimony of Major Morgan, Lieut. Harris, Sergeant Tracey, Privates Galley, Daigle and Hawkes, the conclusion was drawn that, given Pike was seen after daylight and in such proximity to the other beat and the crew of the ship, it appeared “impossible for Pte Pike to have met death with an accident” without someone seeing or hearing something. Nearly two months later, Major Morgan completed the paperwork deeming Pike illegally absent and his pay was deducted $100.96 for the missing kit he had taken with him: his uniform and a weapon, presumably. Pike’s Active Service record baldly called him a deserter.\n\nThe harbour in Saint John is where the mighty St. John/Wolastoq River, eastern Canada’s largest, with a daily discharge of 3.5 billion cubic feet, meets the highest tides in the world, which rise and fall nearly 30 feet. The harbour swirls with treacherous currents, and the water temperature rarely gets above 12 degrees Celsius in the heat of summer. The harbour reluctantly gives up her dead, sometimes playing with bodies, sweeping them in and around the docks, carrying them out into the Bay of Fundy and back again, sometimes for months or years, often times never returning them at all. I have yet to find that John Pike was found. What is known: his wife remarried in October of 1919. Perhaps she took it upon herself to decide Pike wasn’t coming back or perhaps she had official word his body had been found. On 27 January 1920, John Pike’s “Part II DB#30, SOS [struck off strength] Deserter” was cancelled and the following substituted: “Pt II DB #27, SOS Deceased, drowned (acc[ident])”.\n\nDespite his marital woes, and his money issues, John was a victim of this war as much as any of the men who fought overseas. Pulled (or driven) from his home in the north, he found himself in an unfamiliar port, doing tedious duty on a dangerous wharf. Sadly, there is no picture of him. We don’t know whether he was tall or short, fair or dark, handsome or plain-faced. What we do know is he was only 23 years old – too young like many of them – and father to a little girl, only 4 years old, whose memories of him likely faded with the passing years.\n\nFour Days in October\n\n21 May 2023\n\nClarence Buckley\n\n28 days. Not even a month at the Front after 10 months of training and traveling to get to the big show. His parents might have got a letter saying he’d made it to the battlefields, if he’d written them, before getting that dreaded telegram on 26 October 1915 to say he was dead.\n\nClarence Buckley was the third son, one of nine children, born to a scandalous relationship: his father, James, was Catholic, his mother, Maggie, Church of England. His parents didn’t get married – may not have been allowed to by their families – until Clarence’s oldest brother, George, was nearly two years old. The children soon began arriving with regularity: Francis in 1892, Florence in 1894, Clarence in 1896, Mary 1898, Ellen 1899, Annie 1900, Margaret 1906 and finally Peter 1909.\n\nDark-haired and blue-eyed, Clarence was a big lad, handsome and cheerful, smiling even in his formal portrait in uniform. He’d graduated from St. Patrick’s School on the west side of Saint John (a Catholic school although he was raised in his mother’s Anglican denomination) and gone to work for the railroad as a gas engineer. When war was declared, he signed on to the newly formed New Brunswick 26th Battalion in November 1914. Although unnecessary, he fudged his birthdate by a year, as so many did, claiming to be born 27 March 1895 rather than 1896. Perhaps he thought being a bit older gave him a better chance of going overseas. Nevertheless, over he went in June 1915, along with his friend, Jack Cameron. Sadly, his mother did not get to wave him farewell. Maggie Buckley, worn out with childbirth and consumption (tuberculosis) died at age 44 in January 1915.\n\nAfter months at Sandling Camp in Folkestone, the 26th Battalion and Clarence Buckley finally made it to France and Belgium in September 1915. Crossing to Boulougne on the 15th , they marched or took trains to Wizernes, then Hazebrouck and Bailleul, finally ending up in permanent billets in Scherpenberg, Belgium. On the 28th of September 1915, the 26th Bn went into the trenches for the first time. “A” company, of which I am relatively sure Clarence was a part, stayed behind in reserve. Was he disappointed at missing the “fun”? Likely, as so many were eager to do their bit. He would however have to wait 11 more days, while listening to the rumble of the artillery not so very far away.\n\nOn the 9th of October, it was Clarence’s turn to occupy K and L trenches. Four days later, the inexperienced “A” company was tasked to assault a mine crater, presumably occupied by the Germans. It was costly for the 26th Battalion: 3 officers and 30 “Other Ranks” (ORs ie the NCOs and privates) were wounded; 19 OR were killed. Clarence was, for the moment, among the wounded. One of “C” company’s stretcher-bearers, a good friend of Clarence’s whom he nicknamed “Doc”, had been detailed to support the action in which “A” company was involved. Doc found Clarence badly injured in the field and carried him back behind the lines. It was clear to all, including Clarence, that he was not going to survive his wounds. Doc gave him enough morphine to deaden his pain and checked on his friend at every possible opportunity. Each time, Clarence would smile and cheerily ask, “How goes it, Doc?” his cheerful personality undaunted at facing his own death. Jack Cameron came across his friend, but by that point, as Jack wrote home to his parents, Clarence was, mercifully, unconscious. Clarence died shortly after sunset on 13 October 1915 and was buried in La Laiterie Cemetery on the Kemmel-Vierstraat Road. He’d been in Begium less than a month and in the fighting lines for four days.\n\nThe Brothers Cameron\n\n29 April 2023\n\nHector and Jack Cameron (note Jack’s two wound stripes on his sleeve)\n\nHis friend liked to recount Hector Cameron’s first encounter with a bullet on the Western Front: laughing at the hole through his flimsy wool cap, the 15-year-old crowed “A close one doesn’t count!’ Less than a month later, Hector would be dead, lost in his first battle – the first real battle for the 1st Canadian Contingent – at Ypres.\n\nHector McDonald Cameron was the youngest child of Captain Lachlan “Lock” and Annie E. Cameron of Lepreau, New Brunswick. In 1914, his oldest brother Charles was living in Connecticut, one sister, Anna, was married and living in Woodstock, NB, and only his brother Ian Donald and sister Mary were at home. According to family lore, Hector had gone up to stay with Anna and her husband. At nearly 5’8” he was a relatively big lad for the time, and perhaps he was helping on a farm. Whatever the reason he was there, it made a much shorter journey for him to Valcartier, QC, and one far from his parent’s control, when war was declared, and recruiting began for a Canadian overseas contingent. Saying his birthday was 31 December 1892 (rather than 1899), the medical officers concurred his “apparent age” was 22. As such, he needed no written permission from his father to enlist. Further, he seems to have been coy about his name, giving only his initial “H”. Strangely, no one seemed to question it and his name is only later filled in, first as William, then as Hector. Regardless of the lies, Hector, only 14 years old, was accepted in the Canadian Expeditionary Force and, after spending a few weeks training in Valcartier, sailed on the S.S. Scotian to England in October 1914. He celebrated his 15th birthday in the miserable conditions of Salisbury Plain that December.\n\nIan Donald Cameron had been named for an older brother who drowned while his mother was pregnant with him, but as his mother found she couldn’t bear to use her late son’s name, he was called Jack. Seven years older than Hector, Jack enlisted in New Brunswick’s 26th Battalion in the fall of 1914. Perhaps he had had no intention of enlisting in those early days, and perhaps he hoped to look out for his younger brother when word came eventually from Valcartier.\n\nThe 26th Battalion formed in October 1914, and Jack attested in Saint John in November 1914. While Hector trained far from home in England, Jack spent the winter of 1914 through to the spring of 1915 near home, training in Saint John. The men were anxious to get overseas, and discipline became an issue, but Jack seems to have behaved, refraining from the clashes with police that plagued the 26th’s last months in Saint John.\n\nMeanwhile Hector was off to France. After transferring to the 14th Battalion (the 12th, his original assignment, was retained in England as a reserve battalion), he sailed for the front at the end of February 1915. The Canadians were brigaded with British units to learn the ropes and helped with the fighting at Neuve-Chapelle in those early days. But as April progressed and the Germans secretly laid plans to release chlorine gas at Ypres, the Canadian battalions found themselves posed to take a huge role in the defense of the Ypres Salient. As the apex of the Salient collapsed inward on 22 April 1915, the result of the first large scale, successful gas attack of the war, Canadian battalions were thrown into the fire, including Hector and the 14th Battalion. On the morning of 23 April 1915, less than 12 hours after the initial gas attack, the 14th occupied positions near St. Julien. There, they faced renewed German advances, and as the firing began, Hector’s luck ran out. According to a letter from Sergeant L.E. Locke to Captain and Mrs. Cameron, Hector was hit in the head and died instantly. Whether this was the truth, or just what seemed the best thing to say to ease his parent’s grief is unknown.\n\nBy the time Jack sailed for England in June 1915, his parents would have been informed of the loss of their youngest son. One can only imagine the distress of Lock and Annie, having lost two sons already and now watching a third set off into danger.\n\nArriving in England in late June, the 26th trained near Folkestone before embarking for the front on 15 September 1915. Jack seemed determined to relieve his parents of their worry, writing home that “We are having the time of our lives here and are perfectly happy…” How much they believed this cheerful statement is speculation. Jack spent the winter of 1915/16 near Kemmel and St Eloi. In February, he sustained what must have been a relatively minor gunshot wound to his left leg, requiring a visit to the No. 4 Canadian Field Ambulance and three-week recovery at the Divisional rest station. By early March he was back in the line in time for the dismal fighting over the craters of St Eloi, the remains of British mines detonated to destroy the salient the Germans had formed in the area. However, before the next momentous Canadian offensive at Mount Sorrel, Jack was seriously injured again and this time it was a “Blighty”.\n\nBlighty was the nickname British troops had for England, and a “Blighty” injury meant a trip across the channel for an extended stay in the comfort of a hospital far from the fighting. These were injuries too serious to mean a quick turn-around back into the fighting, but not serious enough that evacuation risked killing the patient. In Jack’s case, he sustained a gunshot wound to his right knee, his left arm above the elbow and a devastating shrapnel wound across the back of his left hand, shattering the bones. From the No. 11 General Hospital near Boulogne, Jack travelled to Folkestone, then the Bearwood Canadian Convalescent Hospital in Wokingham, and finally the Granville Canadian Special Hospital in Ramsgate. As the months wore on, it became clear that Jack would never regain much use of his left hand. Repeated infection – for which there were no antibiotics – in both his hand and elbow meant operations and procedures to clear infected tissue and which left draining holes. By December of 1916, Jack was sent home to Canada, no longer fit for active service. Convalescing in Halifax for much of 1917, Jack finally made it home that August and was formally discharged on 31 January 1918.\n\nTheir son was home and safe, if left with a permanent disability and a limp. Captain Lock Cameron did not have long to revel in this joy, dying at age 62 in December 1918. Despite a $270 pension, Jack’s life was forever changed, and he would need to use ingenuity to cope with his injured and useless hand. He married the sister of a fallen comrade of the 26th and rejoiced in the arrival of children. While he sought refuge in the bottle, as many survivors did, Jack also volunteered with the Royal Canadian Legion, and helped veterans of the Second World War negotiate the return to civilian life.\n\nHector, however, was left where he fell. In the chaotic days of 22 – 25 April 1915 there was no time to retrieve the dead, and his body was lost in the subsequent fighting, churned into the unforgiving mud of the Ypres Salient. His only memorial is on the Menin Gate.\n\nEveryone Behaved Splendidly\n\n22 April, 2023\n\nPlease excuse this card, etc\n\nMay 2/15\n\nDear Isobel:\n\nGot thru battle of Ypres all right. Sorry to say we all have had many casualties but at present don’t know just who is missing or wounded etc. Very terrible battle while it lasted, everyone behaved splendidly. May go down to base and get reorganized. Was shot thru clothes three times but escaped all right.\n\nJim\n\nNo Life Like It\n\nCaptain William Pitt, DCM\n\n11 April 2023\n\nHe was obviously proud, and it certainly was an achievement. A half-smile quirked up one neatly trimmed, grey mustache. His Sam Browne belt and gloves shone with polish. The gauntleted cuffs of his uniform showed the double line and three pips of his new rank. The photo, taken in a Saint John studio, was an extravagant memorialization of the moment. After decades in the military, and a previous rank no higher than Sergeant, William Pitt was a Captain. Honorary, to be sure, but a Captain, nonetheless. It was a far, far cry from where he began life as a poor orphan in Victorian England.\n\nThe young Princess Victoria called Wolverhampton a “large and dirty town”. During her reign it didn’t change much, only growing larger and d"
