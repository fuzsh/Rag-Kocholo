He asked to see the dominion archivist, Dr Kaye Lamb, newly appointed from the University of British Columbia. 'A Mr Thompson to see you,' Kaye Lamb's secretary said. 'I want to give you my father's papers,' the man remarked. Lamb was mystified and groped for the visitor's identity. Then he remembered. The man was Colonel John Thompson, economy control director during the war, whom he had seen in the Rideau Club. The papers Thompson meant were obviously those of Sir John S.D. Thompson, prime minister of Canada from 1892 to 1894. There certainly were papers - some thirty trunks of them, down in the basement of the Rideau Club, whither Thompson had brought them from Toronto some years before. They were almost untouched. They had been boxed up after Sir John's death and conveyed to Toronto, where Lady Annie Thompson, the widow, had gone to live with her children. There they stayed, year in and year out. She had occasion to dip into them now and then, but that ended when she died in April 1913. Around 1921 Joseph A. Thompson, the colonel's younger brother, offered to sort out the papers, but the family objected and the matter was dropped. Colonel John, the oldest in the family, resisted attempts to open them up, to sort them, or to prune them. In 1948 some of the papers were taken out by one of the nieces and typed copies made. One letter of Sir John's to his wife in 1887, critical of Sir John A. Macdonald, disappeared at this point. It may have been family pressures of this kind that persuaded the old colonel to put his father's papers in the Public Archives of Canada. The Thompson Papers have thus survived almost intact. They do not appear to have been gone through systematically until they came to the\n\nviii Preface archives. Families can have nasty ways of dealing with papers, especially where family honour is concerned, a subject they interpret with latitude. Historians call this process 'laundering.' The Tupper Papers were not just laundered, they were starched, in order to provide posterity with a proper picture of Sir Charles Tupper. There are gaps in the Thompson Papers, but they are gaps that any collection of papers is subject to when the owner is changing houses, moving to Ottawa, or just cleaning up. And they are rich. They include the papers of Sir John Thompson's father, a fascinating Irishman who came to Halifax in 1827, as well as those of Annie, Lady Thompson. In the latter are many letters between Thompson and herself. She insisted that whenever he was away from home he write to her every day, and he followed the injunction however busy he was. She did the same. It is the greatest husband-and-wife correspondence of any of the prime ministers. Altogether the Thompson Papers, father's and son's, take up over three hundred boxes in the Public Archives of Canada. This book has been a long time in the making. Serious work began in 1974, and although other work has supervened from time to time, Thompson has been my main study. The debts incurred have been many. Dalhousie University has been generous with leave and requests for short-term funding for research; the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council has given me leave fellowships and research grants. There are more personal debts. Murray Beck, now Professor Emeritus at Dalhousie, has read and commented on all the Nova Scotian chapters. John Willis, formerly of the University of Toronto and the Dalhousie law schools, has read chapters where I deal with Thompson's law. Lovell Clark, of the University of Manitoba, has read the chapters from 1891. They have corrected errors and made valuable suggestions. The manuscript required excisions where the historian was getting in the way of the biographer; Professors Beck and Willis, and one of the readers for the University of Toronto Press, at different stages, suggested cuts in order that Thompson could stand freer of the history in which he was partly submerged. The manuscript went to the University of Toronto Press in June 1983, as I was leaving for Australia, and the decision to publish was in hand when I returned in December. No author could ask for more. Gerry Hallowell, history editor at the Press, has been especially gracious. I should like also to thank numerous colleagues for suggestions they have made. Dr Kaye Lamb, formerly dominion archivist, has given me the story of Colonel Thompson bringing the Thompson Papers. H.R. Banks of Barrington, Nova Scotia, has donated some valuable Thompson letters. Professor Craig Brown of the University of Toronto has sent me\n\n1x\n\nPreface\n\nuseful sidelights on Thompson from the memoirs of Harold Daly. Allan Dunlop, assistant archivist of Nova Scotia, has been particularly helpful. The staff of the Public Archives of Canada have willingly met repeated calls on their time. Roger Tasse, deputy minister of justice, and Michael Tyrrell, chief of records, have given me permission to use certain departmental files. A special thanks must go to Dr Eric Sams, of Sanderstead, Surrey, England, for his work on Thompson's shorthand. It had proved difficult to crack. It was an early nineteenth-century shorthand, but there were some seventy or so different methods even then, and no one I consulted in Canada could solve it. When working at the British Library in June 1978 I consulted Mrs Ann Payne, then assistant keeper of the Manuscript Room. She could not solve it but she knew someone who might - Dr Sams, who had done work in cryptography. He solved the Thompson shorthand in twenty-four hours. All students of Thompson, especially myself, have reason to be grateful to him. It proved to be an 1823 shorthand devised by J. Dodge and published in Providence, Rhode Island. Almost certainly J.S. Thompson learned it after he arrived in Halifax in 1827. That it was efficacious there can be no doubt, since both father and son used it extensively in court and legislative reporting. Bette Tetreault and Nancy Martin typed several chapters of the manuscript, and Mary Wyman did several hundred pages of nearly perfect copy just when I needed it in June 1983. The final manuscript was edited for the University of Toronto Press by Diane Mew, who went through it with a fine comb, pulling out tangles. She may not have succeeded in smoothing it all- authors retain the right to be spiky once in a while; but the book has greatly benefited from her strong sense of narrative line and relevance of argument. She is a rare editor. My wife and daughters will be delighted to see Thompson within the covers of a book rather than scattered through one whole room of the house, and to find the author more accessible.

Thompson Comes to Halifax\n\nJohn David Thompson was born on 10 November 1845 in a little wooden house that stood, until 1983, at 5 Argyle Street in the heart of Halifax. He was the seventh and the last child of Charlotte and John Sparrow Thompson. 1 The Thompson family were not well off. The old, narrow, three-story house was rented, and it was crowded with seven children from age fifteen down to the new baby. The father of this brood, John Sparrow Thompson, was a hard-working editor and part-time teacher, who added to his thin living by being a shorthand reporter. He kept all three careers going. He needed every one. John Sparrow Thompson had been born about 1796 in Waterford, Ireland, and had come to Halifax in 1827, when he was thirty-two years old. He was not by any means the lrish immigrant of the 1840s, driven from Ireland by famine and desperation; he was driven rather by ambition, knowledge of his own worth, and belief in a better future. He was not Roman Catholic but was descended from one of a number of Waterford families who had been converted to Methodism by the sojourn there of John Wesley between 1747 and 1753. William Thompson, the grandfather, was a wool dyer. The earliest record of him is 20 December 1789, when he married Mary Sparrow in Trinity Church, Waterford. The Sparrows were probably of Quaker origin. 2 John Sparrow Thompson left Waterford about 1818 when he was twenty-two, to try his fortune in London. It did not come easily. Financial difficulties and other vicissitudes in his eight years in London made him think seriously, in 1826, of America. 'I have not allowed (thank God) adverse circumstances to break my spirits and sink my Character. Heaven and my own heart only knows, what pecuniary difficulties, what calumnies and maddening torture I have experienced.'3 What these were\n\n4 Halifax Boy and Lawyer is not known; but by the end of 1826 or early in 1827 Thompson had determined to leave for North America. He promised his family to stay away four years and then return. He sailed from England in the Osprey in the spring of 1827 and arrived in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in May. Halifax in the late 1820s was a wooden town, nearly surrounded by sea, with some fourteen thousand inhabitants and a military and naval population adding another 15 per cent. Halifax's chocolate-brown houses were painted that way but were also stained with the smoke of coal fires; the dormer windows, perched out on the roofs like bluff Scottish eyebrows, had been watching life go by in the narrow, dirty streets for nearly a century. Chimneys and chimney-pots marked the climb of the houses up the hill toward the great counterscarp of the Citadel that crowned the city. There were some stone buildings, though much less common than in Scottish, English, or French towns. There was the handsome Government House for the governor that Sir John Wentworth had succeeded in wheedling out of the Assembly some twenty years before, built opposite the fields that opened south of Spring Garden Road. There was Province House, the home of the Executive Council, Court, and Assembly, begun in 18 12. And there were a few solid merchants' houses, unpretentious after the Halifax fashion, like the Henry House, made of the ironstone that was underneath the Halifax peninsula. Such houses were cornered, sometimes faced, with the granite that was a few miles to south and west. Around the city lay the sea, the forest, and countless lakes and ponds. Halifax had never been chosen for its agricultural potential. As Sam Slick would say, the country around Halifax would starve a rabbit. Woods and lakes, sea and stone, of that there was plenty and indubitably part of Halifax's charm; but its population could not eat charm. Halifax was built to console Boston for the return of Louisbourg to the French in the 17 48 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle and it cost the British government a pretty packet. Edmund Burke burst out in 1780: 'Good God! What sums the nursing of that ill-thriven, hard-visaged, and ill-favoured brat has cost to this wittol nation!' 4 By the 1830s, with the Annapolis valley to feed it and a plump garrison to provide it with balls, pageants, and husbands, Halifax had grown and prospered. Its population in 1836 was 14,422; by 1851 it had reached 20,749, and the 1871 census reported a population of 29,582. Its wharfs, warehouses, and banks, following each other in that order, had spread along the harbour. Garrisons and ships had to be supplied with food, liquor, women. Not all of that was good quality, and the garrison made\n\n5 J .S. Thompson Comes to Halifax periodic incursions upon Halifax, but on the whole Halifax took its garrison, its trollops, and its fighting with equanimity mixed with occasional exasperation.5 Manners and morals were partly dictated by the garrison, the navy, and the governor, as well as by the local population. As late as the 1830s Sunday was not only for religion but for business and pleasure. On Sunday morning the fish market and green produce market were open; grocers generally stayed open until 1oa.m. After church, at 12:3oorso, it was customary for gentlemen to visit friends, where wine and cake would be set out on sideboards, and amiable conversation would go on until the dinner hour at 3 p.m. At dinner a great deal of claret was consumed, especially by the officers and the wealthier class of Halifax; when the ladies retired after dinner, and the port or madeira was passed around, it was not uncommon for men to fill each of three glasses. Drinking was not confined to the upper classes. Fire companies, militia companies, Freemasons, indeed nearly all associations expected to have strong drink available at their meetings. As one Haligonian said, 'Nothing could be done without it.'6 Even choir practices had to be lubricated with punch; singing was thirsty business! Halifax, like other British North American towns, lived and ate and drank and sinned and died amid conditions we would find primitive, if not offensive. Public institutions were meagre if they existed at all. One of the first acts of the legislature of Nova Scotia, in 1759, had been to establish a House of Correction, sometimes called the Work House, or Poor House, a refuge for those who could not earn their living. The nature of the incapacity was almost immaterial; it could be owing to lack of work, illness, infirmity, or even, in the early history of Halifax, lunacy. 7 The poorhouse child, like those that Oliver Twist knew, was sullen, suspicious, and discontented. Most of the children on the street tended to run wild and were, of course, without education. 8 They came for the most part from wretched homes, ill supplied with water, ventilation, or morals. There was no sewage system but outdoor privies or cesspools wherever there was room. As late as the 1860s none were allowed to be connected with the public sewer, which was only concerned with the drainage of water. 9 In the downtown Halifax lots, usually fifty feet by sixty, there would be twenty-five feet or so behind the house where tenements were constructed. 'I ask any of my fellow citizens,' said the rector of St Paul's 'to walk into one or more of them about 11 a.m. in the month of August ... The reek is something terrible.' He spoke from hard personal experience in those houses and streets, ministering to the sick and dying:\n\n6 Halifax Boy and Lawyer The streets are made the receptacle ... for all the dirt that may be brought out ofan over-crowded house. Go where you will through Barrack, Albemarle, and Grafton streets, you will see slatternly women, and half-grown girls emptying all sorts of vessels, with every species of foulness, into the gutter ... vegetable mattersuch as potato peelings, cabbage leaves, turnips, onions, in various stages of putrefaction form little heaps here and there. Dead dogs, cats, and rats, abound by way of variety, some disembowelled, some with the brains dashed out ... A damp, cloudy day, succeeded by a bright and cloudless one, is the proper day for a walk through one of these streets. The vapour literally ascends in clouds ... and one goes home with the temptation ... to resort to rum. ' 0\n\nAutumn and winter were in this respect more tolerable. November in Halifax was a time of year when the city, like many another town in British North America, began to batten down for the winter, put on its storm doors and windows, and lay in its supplies. Ungainly colliers beat their way up the harbour against the pitiless November north-easters, their weather-stained brown sails, brown masts, and stiff white rigging sharply contrasted against the grey, white-flecked, driving sea. Ashore, Halifax sidewalks tended to be monopolized by heaps of shiny black coal from Sydney or Pictou. Carts trundled round the streets laden with potatoes, green cabbages, purple and gold turnips, all reminding the populace that November was now upon them. By mid-November already harbingers of Christmas would be appearing at the grocers. 'Swift winged \"fruiters\" land their cargoes of fruit and golden sherry. Grocers displayed yellow heaps of oranges and lemons, amber skinned figs, and luscious layers of raisins.''' And there was the November rain and sleet, the dark, drenching, bitter weather that cut Halifax's inhabitants to the bone. John Sparrow Thompson adapted well to Halifax and within a year was thanking providence that he was not only free but respectable in this new and strange land. He wrote his elder brother William in May 1828, the first anniversary of his arrival in Nova Scotia, that he had just a week since drunk tea with the editor of the leading newspaper in Halifax. 12 This was young Joseph Howe, aged twenty-four, who had taken over the Nova Scotian six months before. They were to remain, Thompson and Howe, friends for the rest of their lives. Thompson had not intended to stay in Halifax, but hoped to get enough money together and go on to the United States. It was never to come to that. There were two good reasons: he came to like Halifax, and he married. He wrote home in May 1829, two years out from Ireland, the immigrant who had landed on his feet and had great hopes for the future:\n\n7 J.S. Thompson Comes to Halifax I am more respectably situated than I could at all expect to be in that time - I keep a school, conduct a newspaper, and other matters, which in a short time will pay me well. The climate agrees with me and the people are very kind, Halifax seems already like a kind of second home ... Halifax is a pretty place, the winters long and severe, the summers very warm, living is about as cheap as at home. House rent, and firing high, I pay for three rooms £26 a year. I have great reason indeed of thankfulness that I left home when I did, my prospects here are good, I earn what I get easily, and may have five hours of every day to myself ... Charlotte reads a small portion of your Thomas a Kempis, for me, every morning. ' 3\n\nCharlotte was his bride of two months. Her name was Charlotte Pottinger and she had come to Halifax from Pictou. The Pottingers were Scottish, emigrating in 1804 from Kirkwall, in the Orkneys north of the Pentland Firth. It is not known how Charlotte and John Sparrow Thompson met. They were of different religions, she Presbyterian, he Methodist, and were married in Brunswick Street Methodist Church on 24 March 1829. There were to be seven children of this marriage; the first, Mary, born in 1830 and named after Thompson's mother, Mary Sparrow; then Jane in 1832, William in 1834, CharlotteJrin 1836,Joseph in 1838, Elizabeth in 1842, and finally John David in 1845. John Sparrow Thompson was an affectionate father, not indulgent but generous and open. His Methodism freighted little prejudice, and he sought to stamp out bigotry when he saw it in his children. He loved the outdoors. One of the delights of Halifax was its lakes and woods and sea; as Thompson said of the beach at Point Pleasant, it was a joy to see 'the wood nymph hand in hand with the mermaid ... the sporting breakers ... tumbling headmost and as if laughing in ecstacy, running in among the weeds and shells at our feet.'' 4 That side of Thompson was remarked upon by all who knew him. Letters to him from friends were full of reminiscences of-walks, swims, or sailing in and around Halifax harbour. Thompson's school teaching and his shorthand were not enough to satisfy his ambition. His friendship with Howe, and his experience as assistant editor on Howe's paper, the Nova Scotian, was the background for his assumption of the editorship of a literary venture that started in June 1830, the Halifax Monthly Magazine. Thompson had a strong belief in encouraging native Nova Scotian talent. To aspiring local poets, who frequently preferred the inflated to the substantial, Thompson offered good advice: 'Simplicity and strength cover a multitude of sins in poetry.'' 5 The aim of a literary journal, Thompson believed, was not just to amuse but to instruct and improve. He had certain clear precepts. He\n\n8 Halifax Boy and Lawyer believed all men equal in the sight of God and himself. He hated rank. He hated having to ingratiate himself with others; he hated to insinuate his worth, as it were, among either friends, merchants, or the reading public. If people wanted to read him and would pay him a competence, that was all he asked. Intelligence, industry, charity, these pre-eminent virtues JS. Thompson had: suppliant he was not. He was also candid, sometimes too much so. He was apt to call a spade a spade, and this intellectual honesty was to endear him to discerning friends like Howe. This did not prevent differences of opinion between Howe and Thompson, in particular about temperance. Thompson wrote to his friend: You smiled at my sensitiveness, the other evening, on the subject of ardent spirits, but it is no laughing matter with me - the responsibility presses so overwhelmingly ... I may be called unwise, for this hurts myself, but I would not wish to have that wisdom would stifle the plain dictates of conscience. 16\n\nHowe felt it necessary to rein his friend in, and with some good advice: You are tormenting yourself with a false view of the whole case, and are about to rush headlong into a warfare with the whole state of society around you, for no sufficient reason, and with the certainty of sacrificing the very means in your hands of promoting the cause you espouse. ' 7\n\nImportant as temperance and other strong moral principles were to Thompson, literary judgments were just as much so. He defended Byron in a long article in the Halifax Monthly Magazine in September 1830. Byron's morality was, said Thompson, nearly irrelevant. Towering over such considerations was Byron's poetry, his 'scorn of mere rank, and his misanthropic contempt for the great world.' 18 What mattered were Byron's literary qualities, not his morals. In 1833 the Halifax Monthly Magazine folded; there were not enough subscribers to carry it. Thompson had to fall back on his two other resources, school teaching and shorthand. By 1840, after other unsuccessful experiments, it was clear that Thompson could not manage the business side of publishing. A trenchant and able editor, a good judge of quality in others, fearless and straightforward, he lacked the grubby persistence essential for business - the need to dun old subscribers for payment, to scrounge for new ones, to cajole advertisers into using his space and paying for it.\n\n9 J .S. Thompson Comes to Halifax In the autumn of 1840 Howe entered the coalition government that was formed under Lord Falkland. One result of Howe's influence was Thompson's appointment, early in 1843, as Queen's Printer. He received a regular salary from the government in return for editing the Royal Gazette. But Howe and his two Reform colleagues resigned from the Council in December 1843, and Thompson's career as Queen's Printer did not long survive the resignation of his friend. He refused to print the kind of articles the Tory majority of the Council wanted, and in February 1844 Thompson too resigned.1 9 That resignation was not easy. Thompson was now nearly fifty years old. He had a wife and six children dependent upon him. Many people would have swallowed their principles and stayed in office. His brother Joseph wrote him from Ireland consoling him: Yes better to leave the field honourable in the estimation of friend and partisan than wage War (no matter how great the spoils) at the expense of the faintest reproach of conscience, or the withdrawing of the smile from the approving monitor within. 20\n\nThere spoke the Methodist conscience! J.S. Thompson wrote to his nephew in Ireland in 1845 explaining his position, an honest, hardworking man, fighting his way in a difficult but still interesting world. I have, dear William, had a series of difficulties in business; - again and again, and again, reckoning up and starting afresh, causes labour and loss ... I have had care, loss, disappointment, labour, years lapsed to little worldly profit, - but yet, thank Providence, my picture of life is not all dark ... a large and dutiful family has been given to me, and been spared to me - I have been enabled to rear children who may be of much more use in the world than I have been ... 21\n\nThree months after this letter was written, John David Thompson was born in the little wooden house in Argyle Street.\n\n2 Father and Son\n\nJohn David Thompson was the child of aging parents. By the time he was old enough to have a remembered sense of his world his father was fifty-five, his mother forty-nine. If that helped to give him his quiet nature it would not be surprising. So his father described him in 1853: 'john the youngest, has been noted for his comeliness and good manners. He is a shrewd demure little fellow, engaged at this moment, beside me, with first lessons on the flagolet.' 1 It was in these years that Thompson at last got out of rented quarters. In June of 185 1, when John David was five years old, his father gave up the house at 5 Argyle Street, and bought a house at Gottingen and Prince Wiiliam streets, for £500. It was promptly mortgaged for £420. 2 The Gottingen Street house was to remain with the Thompson family for the next twenty years. It was a typical Halifax house, like that in Argyle Street, two stories and an attic, shingled, with the sloping roof agreeably broken with a three-paned dormer window that leaned out over the roof curious to see the street below.3 On a sixty by sixty-seven-foot lot, it was a narrow, economical house for narrow, economical circumstances. It would be an exaggeration to say that J .S. Thompson lived in poverty; but he had, materially speaking, a close enough life. He never had in these years much more than £5 beyond immediate necessities. His own description to Howe is doubtless accurate, for Howe had been in his house often enough. 'I lived,' he said, 'with much economy, consistent with due decensy [sic].' 4 Frugality gets it right. Nevertheless Thompson radiated charm, and his home too. One of his young friends, W.A. Hendry, long afterward remembered the hearth of J .S. Thompson: It was his delight to gather a few select friends about him generally at his own house, perhaps to read a paper of his own or more frequently the production of\n\n11\n\nFather and Son\n\none of his guests, to be followed by a free discussion .. . On such occasions Thompson would shine to great advantage. He was a close thinker as well as an extensive reader ... As a social companion Thompson was delightful ... simple and frolicsome as a child, his conversation being constantly enlivened with true Irish wit. 5\n\nThere were domestic tragedies; before John David was old enough to remember, two of his sisters died. Jane, aged fifteen, died in November 184 7. Eight months later, his eldest sister, Mary, died of dropsy at the age of eighteen. These deaths shook his father as much as any calamity he ever sustained. Thompson loved his children; he was devoted to them in the present and they carried his hopes for the future. 6 The deaths of Mary and Jane strengthened his fundamental conviction, which John David was to mark, that neither goods nor money was the measure of a man's happiness nor any test of his worth. 7 John David's eldest brother, William, was eighteen years old in 1853 when he was appointed, doubtless through Howe's instrumentality, deputy-surveyor of crown lands in Lunenburg County. The title was grander than the salary, which gave little more than a maintenance. William was ambitious and restless, but for the moment settled into his job. Charlotte, now the eldest sister, was nearly seventeen, 'a plain steady girl, with aptitude for music and drawing,' according to her father; 8 but in a household of growing children, from John David aged eight upward, and with the mother not apparently in robust health, Charlotte's time was taken up with housework. Music and drawing had to be left aside. Charlotte's was the fate of many older girls in such families. Some of them were tied down by domestic drudgery for years. Charlotte was to have fourteen more years ofit until she married in 1867. Elizabeth (or Bessie, as everyone called her) was eleven years old, 'a fine simple promising child,' adored by her father. She is the only one of John David's brothers and sisters of whom we have a photograph. She was to be the most long-lived of them all.John David's immediate older brother, Joseph, was just finishing study at the Free Church Academy, and his career was the immediate concent of his father. In 1857 young Joseph Thompson tried to join the Orange Order. Prior to this time what anti-Catholicism there had been in Nova Scotia was more ceremonial than actual. Roman Catholics had to watch a Guy Fawkes' Day every year. In Halifax there was a bonfire on the Grand Parade in the evening of every November the Fifth, when the pope was burnt in effigy amid much cheering. It did not signify much. Indeed, in 1822 Nova Scotia was the first of the British North American colonies to remove the\n\n12 Halifax Boy and Lawyer impediments against Roman Catholics holding office. By the 1851 census, the Roman Catholic population of Nova Scotia was 69,000 in a total of 277,000, or 25 per cent. In neither the 1861 nor the 1871 census did it increase much above 26 per cent. Nova Scotia had not had a tithe of the religious agitation that had shaken colonial societies in Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick, and the Canadas in the 1850s. It was probably not because Nova Scotians were more tolerant; the type of Roman Catholic they encountered was different. The Acadian French were at the western end of Nova Scotia and at Arichat and Cheticamp in the east; they kept to themselves and in political terms did not count. The Scotch Roman Catholics in Antigonish County and in Cape Breton had been there long enough to be accepted. They even occasionally elected Protestants to represent them in the legislature. The Irish who came to Nova Scotia had come mainly to Halifax, arriving before the great hunger of the 1840s had sent the mass of starving, penniless, disease-stricken humanity to British North America. By the 1850s the Irish in Nova Scotia had become established, some as tradesmen and entrepreneurs, their Catholicism pretty much an accepted part of Halifax life. Nevertheless, there were some primitive prejudices in existence. The Irish workmen building the railway from Halifax to Windsor in 1856 were not very tender souls, and the railway also employed some fairly tough Protestants. There was a riot at Gourlay's shanty in May 1856, caused by Protestants taunting Roman Catholics. The latter responded as best they knew how- they beat up their Protestant tormentors. The Irish workmen were charged, but when they came up for trial, in December 1856, the mixed jury split and no convictions were made. This was the immediate cause of the anger of Joseph Howe. Goaded into a fight with the Irish Catholics of Halifax, he ended up by offending all Catholics. It was a blunder politically, as the Liberals, who had won the election of 1855, now in February 1857 found out. When the Nova Scotia Assembly met, their Catholic supporters promptly deserted them for the Conservatives. This brought down William Young's Liberal government and put the Conservative party under J.W. Johnston in power. Howe had dark thoughts of leading a Protestant crusade. The Orange Order had never been strong in Nova Scotia. The first lodge was founded in Halifax in 184 7, and there were eight in the province by 1850. But in the late 1850s it began to feel its oats; incorporated in 1857 it had twenty-one lodges by 1862.9 Among its new acolytes was Joseph Thompson, aged eighteen, a Methodist like the rest of his family. His father objected vigorously. From the earliest days of his Irish childhood, Thompson said, the Orange Order had been spoken of\n\n13 Father and Son disparagingly by Catholics and Protestants alike. To be an Orangeman had been in Thompson's experience a sign of 'uncharitable bigotry.' Roman Catholicism should not be opposed by such sordid means as those associated with the Orange Order, the main results of which had been resistance by the Order's opponents and dissipation by its adherents. It was stupid, indeed wrong, to be insulting to Roman Catholics. Many of these are good persons - I have found them as true and friendly as any others - and while opposed to their religious views, I would think a studied insult to them every way unwarrantable ... Do not estrange yourself from the family. We want yr. counsel and company. You may so estrange yourself & may cause sorrow to your Mother & me & regret to yr. brothers & sisters - or you may be a consolation & comfort to us all. May the Almighty guide you to choose the better and happr. path. ' 0\n\nJohn David and his two brothers were in the Sons of Temperance movement along with their father. They took part in more than one parade that celebrated the transcendent virtues of cold water. But enthusiasm for cold water was to die soon in William. He had proved adept in his work as deputy-surveyor in Lunenburg County. Surveying, however, meant field work during the day and paper work in the evening. It was the latter that proved to be William's undoing. His uncertain business practices and gregariousness he acquired from his father; these, combined with drink, were to prove altogether unsettling. The manly art of surveying led to other manly arts: William's books got into arrears and by the end of four years were in a tangle. Young William believed his problem was only catching up with arrears of paper work; but in 1859 he was dismissed from his position, an investigation started, and his father was asked for the amount of a bond he had signed in 1853. It was a terrible shock to the old man. There is little indication of how much money was involved, but it was at least £400, and likely nearer £700. That is about $35,000 in 1980s money. Fraud was alleged, but it was probably plain bad management. His father was confident that when the details were sorted out, there would be little to be paid. But there was also little to pay with. Thompson's August 1859 letter to the attorney general of Nova Scotia, now J.W. Johnston, is sad reading from a proud man, sixty-three years of age: I need not say how much I have tried to prevent the difficulty, and how bitterly I have lamented it ... Within a few years I have met with disappointments and loss, and have been trying, with industry and economy, to meet daily absolute\n\n14 Halifax Boy and Lawyer requirements. I have no monied means beyond what I describe, and no other property except a little furniture, &c., and a kind of nominal ownership of the house which I occupy, as Mr. Binton, Secretary of the Building Society is aware. If that were sold, it might deprive my family of a valuable refuge, without, perhaps, realizing £50, beyond encumbrances. 11\n\nNevertheless the house was sold on 1 June 1860, and at a loss. Details are not clear; the family continued to live there, probably leasing from the architect to whom they had sold it. 12 The young witness of the sale signed himself J.S.D. Thompson. John David began to use his father's middle name, Sparrow, in his own name from about this time and so signed himself from 1860 onward. William Thompson had been ready and anxious to redeem his character, but that was not going to be easy in the small community of Nova Scotia. The government service was closed against him. Finally, he left Halifax on 3 December 1859 for South Africa. The last letter from him in the J.S. Thompson Papers was from Cape Town, dated 20 February 1860, announcing his arrival. 13 In February 1860 the Nova Scotian Assembly voted out the Conservatives and brought back the Liberals. William Young, the Liberal premier, appointed himself chiefjustice of Nova Scotia, and in August 1860 Joseph Howe became premier of his native province. J .S. Thompson was made reporter to the Assembly for the 1860 session. Early in 1861 Howe's government appointed J.S. Thompson superintendent of the Money Order Department of the Nova Scotia Post Office. From that time on his income was at long last secure. A stipend of £200 a year - roughly $12 ,000 at 1980s levels - was not a great deal, but for Thompson it was enough. The office was not exacting; attention, punctuality, neatness were the essential virtues. None Thompson considered pre-eminent, not as against independence, integrity, and intellectual vitality; but he could summon them up. Now it might not be possible for him to take a cou pie of hours off today and make them up tomorrow. On hot days he had been wont to walk down to De Wolfe's wharf and take a plunge in the harbour when it was too humid to write or think. 14 Thompson was now sixty-six. Life's uncertainties he had felt at an early age and they had not ended with his arrival in the new world. His friend W.M. Brown was struck by Thompson's remark, 'Is not life a fitful fever to us all?' 15 His brother Joseph in Ireland was writing elegiac letters about the days of their youth, morning days Joseph called them, about old houses, old rooms, and the ruins of memory that lived in them. 16 Thompson too had his elegiac moods. Martin Griffin, a boyhood chum of\n\n15 Father and Son\n\nJohn David's, tells how old Thompson loved to recite Whittier, and did it very well, especially 'My Playmate,' which had so many echoes of Thompson's lost Irish days.' 7 For he was never to return to Ireland, never to see his Irish relations again.John David always kept a special place for Waterford and Ireland in his heart because of 'all the sadness I used to see in my father's face when he spoke of it.\" 8 Philosophical, at times pensive, Thompson was; gloomy he was not. He liked life, and there was a spring to his mind. He was ever ready with his hat and coat, ready to collect young John and the dog to go for a hike. Sometimes this was to Cole Harbour, twelve miles from Halifax on the Dartmouth side of the harbour; sometimes it would be across the harbour to sit over a fire on the beach at Tuft's Cove to enjoy the breeze on a warm summer's evening. W.M. Brown recalled a walk to Cole Harbour: 'The smoky currents' of vapour winding round the hillsides - and lake and meadow in the shadowy distance. The shades of evening too as we returned, meeting the villagers going home in their carts; - when the world without was lost to view, the beauties and treasures of the intellectual world were brought forth old and new - familiar and strange, provoking laughter, or awaking a sigh. 'Who so happy as we?' we thought, if we did not speak it and we parted with the resolve to have another pleasant ramble. ' 9\n\nOr the two families, the Thompsons and the Browns, would go sailing together,John David at his favourite perch in the bow looking down into the clear water. 'I was made happier if that could be,' wrote Brown, 'by seeing your young people and mine so happy together, and yourself, at the helm, looked pleased \"all over your face\" .' 20 There were lots of stories between them. 21 Brown and Thompson would argue politics; Brown was indifferent about politics but Thompson certainly was not. Thompson insisted that a man's duty as citizen required that he study politics. Brown wrote, 'I could listen to your bursts of indignation against some wrong doer, and wait to hear you afterwards express sympathy for the wicked fool, notwithstanding his offences ... I have to thank God for that He hath thrown you in my way.' 22 What remained especially in Brown's mind was young John David, at thirteen or fourteen, sitting quietly in the bow of the sailboat or walking beside the two men, listening earnestly to their talk, smiling when they were uproarious, as they frequently were. There are few recollections of John David in these years. A British officer's son recalled how about 1853John David, a bright, curly-headed eight-year-old, recited at Temperance Hall to great applause Caroline\n\n16 Halifax Boy and Lawyer Norton's poem from the 1830s, 'Bingen on the Rhine,' about a young German soldier in the French Foreign Legion, dying far from home: 'A soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers; / There was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of woman's tears .. .' Other information about John David's boyhood is thin. He attended the Royal Acadian School, George and Argyle streets, in the mid-185os. His father was teaching there for a time, and would call the boys to order by banging on a heavy brass bell that stood on the desk. Old Thompson drilled them in recitations, and was especially concerned that they made the proper gestures and pauses when the school put on performances. Then the walls of Acadian's makeshift stage would be hung with spruce boughs and flags; there John David recited another of his father's favourite poems, Thomas Campbell's 'Battle of the Baltic,' written shortly after the battle of Copenhagen in 180 1: Of Nelson and the North Sing the glorious day's renown, When to battle fierce came forth All the might of Denmark's crown ... •3\n\nHe attended briefly, probably between 1859 and 1860, the Free Church Academy, a sort of grammar school founded in 1845 by the Presbyterians. It used the Dalhousie College building. (From 1844 to 1863 Dalhousie was a ghost, a building without students or professors.) All too soon John David was forced to work by the ineluctable necessities of family life. By September 1860, when he was nearly fifteen, he was at work in the law office of Nepean Clarke, clerk of the sessions. More than that, he seems to have been relied upon by his father to help keep the family going when his father was away. Joseph was now a clerk and may have helped, but the one surviving letter from this period suggests how much the old man relied on John David. J .S. Thompson was in Truro in October 1860 as reporter for the session of the Supreme Court, presided over by Chief Justice William Young: My dear John, ... I had rather a busy week, up to Saturday evening, chiefly in a tedious case of disputed land. The Chief Justice got on well and smoothly; Mr. Johnston was at the bar as Chief Council [Counsel] in the chief case, but evinced nothing but courtesy for his successful rival on the bench . ... I will be wanted in Pictou, next week, if a certain case comes on for trial; if so I may remain in Pictou for the week, altho I feel anxious about home ...\n\n17\n\nFather and Son\n\nWrite me by tomorrow's post, saying how affairs are at home, whether I am wanted there &c. Give my love to Mother, Charlotte, Bessy. Joe. Any news from William? ... State any particulars which may be suggested to your mind, as of any interest or consequence. I have perused but one Halifax paper since I left home. Your loving father, JS. Thompson•4\n\nThis letter assumes some maturity in young John, but it is still addressed to Master J .S.D. Thompson, at the office of Nepean Clarke. It is clear that John David was taking on some of his father's responsibilities. By 1864 his father's work at the Post Office became more difficult for him; in the evenings after work at the law office, John David would go over to his father's office in the old Dalhousie College building and try to finish up what his father had been unable to do. John David's day was already long. A lawyer's apprentice had work of monumental dullness: copying out voluminous writs, elaborate arguments and pleadings, on long pieces of heavy lawyer's paper- the kind of work a typist would do in a tenth of the time. Thompson's handwriting had a certain copybook clarity: small, neat, without flourishes . After early experience in Nepean Clarke's office, John David became articled in 1861 to Henry Pryor. Pryor was a well-to-do lawyer, the son of a loyalist merchant from New York. Like many wealthy men in Halifax, he took his duties as citizen seriously, serving three times as mayor, in 1849-50, 1853-5, and 1857-9. He was justice of the peace for Halifax County - one of the few lawyers who was - and in May 1867 was made stipendiary magistrate, a post he was to hold until 1883. Pryor's office was thus not a .b ad place for Thompson, however dull the work. There was a diversified legal business and Thompson could study law in whatever time he had available. He studied it with rare thoroughness, the way his father had taught him, with a ready mastery of detail. Pryor was no intellectual giant, but it made little difference to young Thompson what sort of a teacher he had, so long as he had access to a decent collection of law books. 25 There is evidence that Pryor found Thompson too shy, too bookish, perhaps too scrupulous. 'Thompson,' said Pryor once in a moment of annoyance, 'you will never be able to earn your salt.' 26 If by that Pryor meant wealth, he came closer to the truth than usual with such predictions. The bar examinations were not difficult and on 25 July 1865, J.S.D. Thompson was admitted to the bar of Nova Scotia. He was nineteen years old. He had, of course, to set up his own practice. Early years as a fledgling professional are usually hard and it was fortunate that he had acquired\n\n18\n\nHalifax Boy and Lawyer\n\nmastery of his father's shorthand system. If worse came to worst, he used to say, he could always turn to and make a living with that. In fact he did. In the 1867 spring session of the Nova Scotia Assembly, the last one before confederation, he was John G. Bourinot's assistant in reporting debates. 27 Thompson was, almost certainly, an anti-confederate between 1864 and 1869. There is no evidence to contradict the statement of Lawrence Power, clerk of the Assembly from 1867 to 1877, that Thompson was opposed to confederation and remained so until Howe joined the Macdonald government in 1869. 28 Thompson and his friends enjoyed the discomfiture of the confederationists. This diary entry for 1July 1867 reflects their sentiments: Our first day as Canada. The Union of the Colonies was celebrated in a very lame manner although I suppose the Confeds, will trumpet it in the most graphic manner - the bells rung or toll'd just as you please a few weak guns were fired ... Something they called a procession consisting of a representative of each of the trades and professions - all the Senators and the Band ... the day was very warm and dusty.\" 9\n\nA few months later, on 21 October 1867, Thompson's father died, after a short illness, in the house at 95 Gottingen Street. Thompson was left with full responsibility for the family and little to discharge it with, save the labour of hands and brain. There was no insurance, so far as is known. His mother and his sister Elizabeth had somehow to be provided for. Charlotte, his other sister, a few months earlier had married Daniel Sargent, a widower from Barrington, in Shelburne County.John David's brother William was in South Africa. His other brother,Joseph, was gone. In May 1865Joseph had married Emma Hamilton, a Halifax girl; then, late in 1866, he had emigrated to Galveston, Texas, with his wife. There the young couple ran into an epidemic of yellow fever in the summer of 1867. On 2 August Joseph wrote to John David with some sang froid, 'Give our best love to all and in case of the worst we shall say good-bye. Your bro. Joe.' 30 Within a month both were dead. Thus in October 1867, at nearly twenty-two,John David was left with the house to keep going and two women to support. That was what was left of the strivings, the hopes, the ambitions, of John Sparrow Thompson, the Irish immigrant who had come to Halifax forty years before. Yet was it so small? Caring little about making money, believing all his life that the mind was man's real kingdom, J .S. Thompson was fearless,\n\n19 Father and Son\n\nintelligent, charming, vigorous. He was not forgotten. His pensive, lean face still catches at passers-by out of the dark portrait by William Valentine.31 He was unfitted for public life; so carefully did he balance the rights and wrongs of major issues that he could hardly decide upon them. In private, he was sure-footed, firm, sometimes even obstinate. His great passion in life was literature; the only book in the nineteenth century about Nova Scotian poetry was written by J .S. Thompson, published in 1862.32 Those who knew him trusted his judgment and were much influenced, sometimes debilitated, by it. John Bell, later Halifax's city auditor, used to come away from a literary session at the house on Gottingen Street smarting from Thompson's merciless corrections. Bell had to admit that Thompson was right, that it was only his own 'thinskinnedness' - Thompson's word- that made the criticism so hard to endure. 33 Nothing could induce old J.S. Thompson to praise what he believed was faulty. His sincerity had in it a hardness that could be uncomfortable. He reminds one of Gregers Werle in Ibsen's The Wild Duck, pulling away the very illusions that made life bearable. 34 John David had ample occasion to observe how his father's friends had sometimes to pay a price for such rugged sincerity. But he had loved, admired his father: J.S. Thompson's great legacy of independence, integrity, and industry were to be carried over into John David's strong, coherent, and untrammelled mind.\n\n3\n\nThe Courting of Annie Affleck\n\nJohn David never seems to have been close to his mother; what he may have felt about her as a child is unknown. For all their richness, the Thompson Papers contain not a single letter to or from his mother. Charlotte Pottinger Thompson must remain unknown in default of evidence. She may have been chronically ill; if so, it was for a long time, since she died only in 1887. Conclusions must be highly tentative. But the apparent coldness of their relationship is difficult to explain on any other ground than that certain events of Thompson's early maturity permanently estranged him from his mother. After his father's death, Thompson began what can be described as a quest for certainties. For all its charm, the Thompson home had frequently lacked material certainties. By the time Thompson had started to work himself, he could see how the receipt of a regular income from the Post Office had made his father more comfortable. Routine though the work was, it had brought in £50 every quarter after 1861. There was a lesson in it. Being a lawyer, as Thompson had become in 1865, did not guarantee a livelihood. Thompson's friend, Martin Griffin, discovered after being admitted to the bar that it was good to be in the newspaper business.' Beyond trying to earn his living in a crowded profession, Thompson knew where he was going, what he wanted to be. To be a judge was for young Thompson the summit of his profession; it required qualities that both he and his father cherished- knowledge, probity, and intellectual vigour. It was his ambition the moment he got his feet in a law office. He had only delight in the prospect of becoming what Sir John A. Macdonald was to call 'a legal monk.' 2 His quest for certainty was to take him, however, further than that. He was restless and dissatisfied with the Methodist religion. He had been devoted enough; he attended with his family the Brunswick Street\n\n2 1 The Courting of Annie Affleck Methodist Church, where his mother and father had been married in 1829; he had been taught, and had himself taught, in the Sunday school where he had been a star pupil. Indeed, his old Sunday school teacher remained his spiritual mother for the rest of his life.3 Thompson was probably never attracted to the emotional manifestations of Methodism : the steamy confessions of sin, the passionate abjuring of evil, the golden catharsis that promised everything. These had not been what held his father either. Old J .S. Thompson liked Methodism's levelling, republican honesty, its absence of class, its instinct to measure a man by what he was rather than by what he appeared to be. It was to J.S. Thompson a plain-clothes religion, affirming the fundamental truth that all men were equal in the sight of God. But for John David the Methodist faith may have been unsatisfying metaphysically. The religious upheavals of the 1840s and 1850s within the Church of England about the church and its doctrines, the revival of Roman Catholicism in Britain and in British North America, stirred his search for some towering theology, some better articulated eschatology than the simplicities that Methodism provided. About the time of his father's death John David began to attend the Church of England and the Roman Catholic church, to listen to sermons, to read religion, to search actively for the true faith. In this search he met the sophisticated, intelligent, courageous Roman Catholic archbishop of Halifax, Thomas Connolly. Connolly was Irish, born in Cork in 1814. He studied in Rome for the priesthood, and had come to Nova Scotia in 1842 as secretary to Bishop Walsh, who had been appointed bishop of Halifax. In 1852 Connolly was made bishop of Saint John, New Brunswick, when Halifax itself was elevated into the archdiocese. When Archbishop Walsh died in 1858, Connolly succeeded him. In 1867 and 1868 Archbishop Connolly preached a series of sermons in St Mary's Cathedral on the foundations and doctrines of the church. These sermons and the man himself strongly influenced young Thompson. He was not yet a Roman Catholic, but, like so much else he did, he was carefully surveying the ground. Thompson was not the only one influenced by Connolly's high courage and strong mind. Connolly made a signal impression at the Vatican Council in Rome in 1869-70, where he spoke out strongly against the proposed doctrine of papal infallibility. 4 It was this sort of courage that attracted Thompson, and he was undeniably drawn to Connolly and the Roman Catholic faith over the more obvious, socially easier, claims of the Church of England. Nor was Thompson's conversion sudden. The manner of it was characteristic:\n\n22 Halifax Boy and Lawyer I had been attending the Church of England and Roman Catholic services exclusively for upwards of four years, and reading all of the controversy I could get my hands on, and finally yielded only when to believe and not to profess appeared to be wretched cowardice.5\n\nThompson's favourite character in history was Sir Thomas More.6 It suggests the bent of his mind : he was not seeking a church but the church. It was said that a young Catholic girl, Annie Affleck, had much to do with Thompson's conversion. He refuted this. He was making up his mind about the change before he met her and he only became a Roman Catholic nine months after he married her. 'I did not want it to appear as though I had \"turned\" in order to be married.' 7 Castell Hopkins, whose 1895 biography of Thompson had the family imprimatur, stated: It is indeed understood that they never discussed religious matters, either before or after marriage, until he announced his intention of becoming a Roman Catholic. During their engagement, Mr. Thompson would frequently meet her at the church door and walk home, but he seldom or never attended the services with her.8\n\nAnnie Affleck was born in Halifax on 26 June 1845, the daughter of Captain James Affleck and Catherine Saunders. Her mother was born in Newfoundland; her father came from Berwick, in the north of England, in 1840. His two step-brothers emigrated to Barbados and established a successful plantation there, one that Captain James Affleck, as he became, visited on voyages south from Halifax. 9 On 24July 1844,James Affleck married Catherine Saunders. They had eight children, of whom Annie was the eldest, and Frances, born 1863, the youngest. ' 0 Annie was not well educated, but she was possessed of a quick and vivacious intelligence. She was an attractive young woman; she was also moody, loving wild weather, reminding one of Catherine Linton in Wuthering Heights. Annie was often a creature of her own impulses, and sometimes she was a victim of them, swung upon the great swells of her own exhilaration and depression. She had pride and independence without the physical resources for them, trapped between her emotions and her physical reality. Too often the latter condition.ed the former. She was sometimes unwell and hated herself for being so. She feared becoming, as she put it, 'a useless mope,' neither useful in this world nor prepared for the next. 11 Our first view of her is in June 1867 just at her twenty-second birthday. The first entry in her diary records that Thompson took her to a cricket\n\n23\n\nThe Courting of Annie Affleck\n\nmatch. It was Thompson's advent on the scene, about November 1866, a few months before the diary opened, that created a crisis with another young man called O'Flaherty. Nothing is known of him, but the ending of the affair reveals something of Annie. She and Thompson were out walking and met the rival, who bowed. 'He has had the best of it he acted his part well and now I suppose enjoys his revenge but let him get now out of my mind altogether and he that I would of once dared anything for.' That sense of daring marks Annie Affleck. She was high-spirited and unafraid; she was, after all, a sea captain's daughter. She did not yet give O'Flaherty his conge, but by late September 1867 that affair was virtually over. ui The courtship with Thompson proceeded apace. From July 1867 onward he was at Annie's five or six evenings a week. It was not always easy. They argued, Annie admitted, 'about wifely submission.' Submissive she was not. One has the impression of a fierce young nature only partly controlled by good manners and social custom. The subject of woman's role in marriage continued to arise. Whatever answers Annie may have given, Thompson continued to come and they continued to talk. They would sit around the house chatting, then go walking around the common. In those years and after, the common was the favourite resort for the poor and working classes of the city after work was over, especially in the summer and autumn. ' 3 Young and old would be there, old men watching grandchildren play, or young lovers like Thompson and Annie Affleck discussing their lives or debating, as they did frequently, 'work and a woman's position.' But it was not all fencing. Wednesday, 4 September 1867: T called for me about 1/2 past 3 and we arrived in the [railway] cars at Bedford about 20 minutes to 5 ... We walked on the rail track down along to a dear little brook by the shore for about an hour. I felt real happy for a time kind of away from the world and troubles ... home just at 8 o'clock I need hardly say we talked the evening away.\n\nThompson began teaching her French; he was also teaching her shorthand, and by September Annie began to use it in her diary. It is from Annie's shorthand that one begins to understand something of their relationship. The reasons why Thompson appealed to Annie is a natural question and is not susceptible of an easy answer. Annie was bold, original, and spirited; Thompson was quiet and controlled. She needed a flywheel to control her centrifugal forces; he enjoyed the refreshing vigour of them.\n\n24 Halifax Boy and Lawyer\n\nAnnie in her own family felt a little helpless, and this was compounded by her being from time to time unwell. As the eldest daughter, much may have been expected of her. She was frequently cross and irritable. 'T. in. I did some French and fought.'' 4 Thompson had his emotions disciplined but he was not a cold fish. He gave the impression of a powerful furnace whose coals were well banked but where an alteration of dampers and draughts could produce a raging fire. Nor was he dull; Annie did not enjoy dull people, any more than she could tolerate undisciplined ones. Thompson loved to tease and he had a vigorous sense of humour. More than that, Thompson seemed to be a man Annie could lean on in the business of living she found so hard. He gave her peace. She was soothed by his patience, caught by his kindness. 'How could I live without it now?' she asked herself on 8 September. A few days later she confided in shorthand, 'I kissed Thompson tonight. Heaven help me if I am doing wrong. I can't live without some kindness.'' 5 Courting was not easy with Annie's parents, three brothers, and two sisters around. 'Joey' (Annie's sister Johanna) was now twenty, the youngest sister, Frances, was only four; her brothers were fifteen, thirteen and eleven years of age. But sometimes Joey would be out or go upstairs. As Annie put it on g October, 'Thompson is in and Joey is out.' That night they talked for a while, then Thompson drew her to him, kissed her, and told her how much he cared for her. 'Ring or no ring,' wrote Annie in shorthand, 'it was pleasant, pleasant, to be petted ... lonesome I would be without him now.' There were times when she positively needed to be cajoled, or petted as she used to say. 'I felt horribly dissatisfied with myself and everyone else all day a kind of an uncomfortable independent reckless sort of mood. He kissed me, petted me, and talked it off.' In the midst of this came Thompson's father's final illness and death. Then it was Annie who reached out in sympathy. 'Poor child,' she wrote on 23 October, 'he is tired and worn out. His father is to be buried tomorrow.' 16 When she knew she was being contrary or cross Annie wondered how Thompson's patience could last. Increasingly as November came, she found herself lonely when he was away or could not call. Is it me, she asked herself, or merely passion, that makes me so lonesome for him?' 7 'I shudder to think of having to get over liking him if ever I should have to.' There was a similar ambiguity in their quarrels. One evening she refused to coaxed out of a bad mood, and Thompson left. She was unhappy, thinking that Thompson might believe she was really nothing to him, that he could live just as well, if not better, without her. The following day she spent sewing and reading the biography of Lord Bacon. Thompson came in after supper, and it was Annie who made up the\n\n25\n\nThe Courting of Annie Affleck\n\nquarrel, to her own surprise. 'I sat in his arms, and laid my head on his shoulder and felt glad to feel that I was not alone.' 18 That was 10 December. Christmas eve they spent talking by the fire; Annie remarked on the quiet content she felt and how she had thought that she would never feel that way with anyone: ... I felt that I was dear to him, and is he not as dear to me? He fastened a little chain around my neck to remember this Christmas Eve. I would remember it too ... Whatever my future Christmas Eves may be like this one, at last, after all the bitter trials of this year, troubles that my spirits almost broke under, hard and bitter, but they are in the past now. I am quieter and happier and thank God after all this Christmas Eve was the most peaceful and happy of all that I have spent. God guard him and I along into the dark future, be it long or short. 19\n\nShe was still unwell from time to time; 27 December she spent staring morosely into the fire not even willing to read. Thompson did not come something had held him up - but her impression of her world without him is fascinating: I felt as if I were all alone in the world, the cold chill shiver of lonesomeness went over me. I tried to battle it off and to read but I could not ... and felt again all the long lonesome nights that I have spent ... wondering what I was sent into the world for ... I know that I am silly, that he would have been in tonight if he could and still I could not content myself to sit and read. I suppose as I am I must be; I cannot alter my nature now.20\n\nAnnie's New Year's eve was the summit of her year 1867, and she surveyed the long, difficult road she had come: [Thompson is] the only one that cares for me in truth; for that I am content ... ifhe is to be in in the evening when he kisses me and tells me that I am all to him I feel happy, and when he goes I only think that tomorrow evening I will see him again for now I live for him I am trying to be content for him ... Who would have thought that this night last year, that before he came to be all to me that he was to make me contented with life and that I would look up to anybody ... Annie Affleck Halifax, December 31st, just upon the stroke of 12 o'clock, back room in Starr Street. 21\n\nSo ends Annie's diary. One is admitted to her private world in future only through her letters to and from Thompson.\n\n26 Halifax Boy and Lawyer As Annie's commitment to Thompson grew, so also did her mother's hesitations and her sister Joey's. The cause of the Affleck unease was probably Thompson's religion. It grew so uncomfortable that Thompson's letters and notes had to be smuggled in. 22 There was not yet any question of their marrying; Thompson was the sole support of his mother and sister and Annie had no money. She may even have worked for a while in a shop in the later 1860s to help her family. 23 Of all the letters and notes that Thompson sent to Annie before they were married (in 1886 Annie had a whole box of them), nothing survives but one letter, of 3 December 1869. It was written from Barrington, in Shelburne County, where Thompson was visiting his sister Charlotte and brother-in-law, Daniel Sargent. This letter is written in longhand and shorthand, an example of Thompson's maturing style at the age of twenty-four: Dear Annie, I suppose it is very bold of me to write again and your Ma &Joey will be cross but I will be there soon I hope to apologize in person. Barrington is like a perpetual Sunday- the people are very nice and all very good . It seems strange though how they all live for you see no one going about and even those that keep shop only seem to be there for about an hour a day. Two or three vessels have run ashore in honor of my arrival to their own great personal inconvenience and the embarrasment [sic] of their owners. See what it is to make a sensation. With love to all, I remain, Yours,JSDT.\n\nWhat follows in shorthand reveals, what is so often in Thompson concealed, the volcano underneath. It is at least four times the length of the longhand version: My own baby dear, Yesterday morning the first thing after breakfast I went up to the Way Office to see if the mail had come .. . presently a wagon stopped at the house ... but no letters and I felt just as if I had not a friend in the world. But soon afterwards Dan'! came in with my darling's letters in his hand. My heart jumped up to the ceiling but I put them into my pocket until I could kiss them all four before reading them. My own pet there never were such darling notes written before. They made me so happy and I laughed over them and kissed them and prayed for Annie when I went to bed ... And I thought about her in the long black dress with that pretty frill for her shoulders ... Now ... your ugly coward boy that nobody likes but Annie and that nobody ever did like but Annie, is far away ... but he is counting the hours till he will be back to number 15 [Gottingen Street, the Affleck house] ... I hope dear pet\n\n27 The Courting of Annie Affleck they did not make a fuss at home about my writing ... I wish I could give you a kiss now and get a box on my ears and then a hug and a kiss and be called your darling.\n\nThompson found in Annie the first woman who really cared for him. That she was beautiful and spirited was perhaps beside that more fundamental consideration. Thompson threw himself into his relationship with Annie with an assiduity and a determination remarkable even for a lover. There was also that revealing phrase in shorthand, 'your ugly coward boy that nobody likes but Annie.' It suggests a shy, lonely young man, who had grown up close to his father and now, two years after his father's death, was already distant from his mother. Perhaps Annie was beginning to take on the mistress-mother role, one that was to suggest itself more strongly later. The word 'coward' has to be interpreted carefully. Thompson always appeared well mettled, capable of defending himself. But it is possible to suggest the 'shrewd demure little fellow' that his father observed at the age of eight had by the age of twenty-four developed armour strong enough to protect, even hide, a real self more tender and vulnerable than appearances would suggest. This interpretation puts a great deal of weight upon one word, especially when that word is represented only by the shorthand rt'Yl., that is, cwrd. But some of Annie's letters suggest strongly that this is right, that it is important to remember the 'slight and rather delicate youth, with a shy and timid manner ... utterly devoid of anything like conceit or self assertion,' as Hopkins put it, behind the man. 24 Thompson met difficulties in his own home as well as in Annie's. The steadily developing intimacy between them made both families unhappy; probably Thompson's family was the more unhappy of the two, since Thompson was the sole support of his mother and sister. By 1870, however, their affair had gone on for three years, years in which it was increasingly obvious that there was no prospect of their being separated from each other. Sometime in the late spring of 1870, perhaps when Annie's sea captain father was home, Annie's family consented to their marriage. Archbishop Connolly, who could have arranged all the dispensations, was in Rome at the Vatican Council. An episcopal dispensation was indisputably necessary, since Thompson was still a Methodist. Canon Patrick Power of St Mary's Cathedral gave Annie's mother letters to the Bishop of Portland, Maine, asking him to authorize the ceremony, letters that Annie Affleck and her mother brought with them to Portland at the\n\n28 Halifax Boy and Lawyer\n\nend ofJune 1870, by steamer from Halifax. Bishop David William Bacon authorized the marriage, with the power of ecclesia aeterna sweeping away obstacles.25 In the parlour of the bishop's palace on Congress Street, Portland, on Tuesday, 5 July 1870, Annie Affleck and John Sparrow David Thompson were married by Father R.J. deRose. Nothing else about the wedding is known. They stopped in Saint John on the way home, 26 then probably travelled by boat to Windsor, and thence to Halifax by train. The newlyweds moved in with Thompson's mother and his sister Elizabeth in the old family home at 95 Gottingen Street. The first Dominion census in 187 1 recorded the four of them there, Thompson and his three women; Annie gave her age as twentythree (she was twenty-five); Thompson's mother and sister gave their true ages and declared their religion as Methodist. Thompson significantly gave his religion as Protestant. 27 It was about the last stage of his quest for certainties. For at least three years he had brooded over the decision to become a Roman Catholic. That it was not an easy decision goes without saying. One of his favourite thinking walks was around Point Pleasant; it was (and is) a Halifax custom on fine days in summer or winter. One day early in 187 1, on one of these ruminative walks, Thompson asked a friend who was with him, 'If I become a Roman Catholic, is it likely that my Protestant clients will desert me?' 28 The answer is not known. It would probably have made no difference; Thompson's question was rhetorical, prompted by his desire to apprehend realities, not by his unwillingness to take the risk. He was well aware of risks. He said to another friend, 'I have everything to lose from a worldly standpoint by this step I am about to take.' 29 Nevertheless, on 2 1 April 1871, in St Mary's Cathedral, he was baptized a Roman Catholic with the name of John David Thompson, as he had been baptized in the Methodist church twenty-four years before.30 One of his new godparents was Archbishop Thomas Connolly. Thompson's biographer, Castell Hopkins, asserted that Thompson's popularity in Halifax grew after his change of religion, because of the visible demonstration of the courage required to make it. 3 ' But at the time Thompson felt he was risking the prospect of material comforts for his wife, himself, and his future family. 'In fact,' Thompson said many years later, 'I believed that day of my baptism was the day that closed my chances of professional advancement or any other.'32 George Johnson, a friend since school-days, remembered how Thompson ruminated about the consequences. 'Never mind,' said Thompson, half to himself, 'I know stenography and can scratch a living ... even though it be a poor one.'\n\n29 The Courting of Annie Affleck\n\nSome of his friends were sure he had made a wrong turn. Jeremiah Northrup, an old friend of Thompson's father and of Howe, and vice-president of the Merchant's Bank, said to George Johnson, 'George, John Thompson has never yet to my knowledge put his foot down without being sure of his ground. But this time he has made a mistake.' But he had not; his clients respected him and stuck by him. 'You don't know,' Thompson said to Johnson, 'how much I love my old Methodist friends. Do you know that not one of them left me? I did not lose a single client of them that I had.'33 Thompson was not wealthy, but one ought not to exaggerate his poverty. If he started life with heavy burdens to carry, he was carrying them. He was never so poor that he could not go to the theatre when something good was in town. He and Martin Griffin were both attracted to the theatre, and they were fond of the great English actor, Charles James Mathews, who came to Halifax on his third and last North American tour.34 The old Theatre Royal, at the corner of Spring Garden Road and Queen Street, saw much of Thompson and Griffin in the years prior to Thompson's marriage. Martin Griffin was a close friend who shared Thompson's confidences and difficulties. Griffin had come to Halifax from Newfoundland with his family when he was seven. He was a Roman Catholic, educated at St Mary's College, and called to the bar in Halifax in 1868. Griffin found it hard to make a living, and having some literary flair, he became editor of a Halifax paper that was Roman Catholic in sympathy, the Halifax Evening Express. At the end of 1874 the Express was allowed to fold and in January 1875 the Halifax Morning Herald was formed, with Thompson on the board of directors and Griffin as its editor. 35 Griffin was really responsible for the astonishing success of the Herald. He had a wicked pen and a temper as short as he was. He loved combat almost for its own sake, for its adrenalin, its sense of victories won, however evanescent the victories were. As one of the rival papers said, Griffin always had on his war paint, he was always 'brandishing his tomahawk, and feeling for his scalping knife.' 36 Thompson's law practice developed steadily, if slowly. As long as his father was alive he was able to contribute to the household and still have a little money left over. In September 1867, just before his father's last illness, he had bought a small property at the corner of Argyle and Buckingham streets at an estate sale. Thompson paid £i ,080 for it, and took a mortgage of £850. The assumption is either that he had £230 available for the purpose or had succeeded in borrowing all or part that\n\n30 Halifax Boy and Lawyer amount. 37 Undoubtedly his father's death the next month severely inhibited further savings. His equity after nearly five years, in 1872, was still only $2 ,300 (£575). On 1 April 1869 Thompson was taken on as a partner by a Halifax lawyer named Joseph Coombes. Coombes was made attorney in 1863 and admitted to the bar in May 1864. He had already some skill in court, succeeding in one famous breach-of-promise case before Justice DesBarres. In these sorts of cases, and in many others, Thompson was behind the scenes in the back office of the little firm at 12 Bedford Row. By 187 1 Thompson was beginning to appear in court, and in April of that year an equal division of the profits was arranged, supplanting the two-third/onethird arrangement of 1869.38 A partnership is like a marriage : each partner is jointly and severally responsible for the debts of the other. In Thompson's partnership with Coombes, however, it was agreed that the clients that they each had had prior to their partnership would continue to be their independent concerns. It was just as well. Coombes and Thompson were not suited to each other; an old family friend of Thompson's, John Bell, described Coombes as 'a blusterly low bred attorney without character and means, but abounding in impudence.' 39 Whatever the cause, the ThompsonCoombes partnership was dissolved in August 1873. Sometime after that Coombes, guilty of some irregularities in the administration of a client's affairs, was forced to quit Halifax, ending eventually in Guysborough. Thompson carried on his law practice alone until 1878. Thompson had other strings to his bow. In 1868 J.G. Bourinot had gone to Ottawa as reporter to the House of Commons, and Thompson succeeded him as reporter to the Nova Scotia Assembly. He was paid on contract, at a price based on the government's (and his) assumption that the post-confederation sessions of the legislature would be much shorter. In 1868 it was the other way round, the heaviest session in sever(ll years. It was not a very remunerative first contract! 40 The reporting of debates in Thompson's hands was deftly done, straightforward and compact, without the rotund style Bourinot had affected. Martin Griffin recalled how he and Thompson would sit up at night working on the proofs of those interminable debates. Thompson hated to have to be down at the law office at ten after a midnight working session like that. He was never to be an enthusiast for early rising.4 ' On one occasion an important member of the Assembly had been too indulgent drinking wine at dinner, and his speech afterward in the Assembly was voluble but nearly incomprehensible. What appeared in the\n\n3 1 The Courting of Annie Affleck debates was a lucid column, neatly directed at the question before the House. The MLA went to Thompson and told him, 'I never had a more accurate and satisfactory report of any speech.'42 Before going over to the House, Thompson usually went to Wilson's, a little restaurant on Hollis Street around the corner from his office in Bedford Row, and lunched on mutton pie and a cup of tea. His meal later became a package of coconut caramels, his favourite. He was eating unwisely. One illustration of this occurred a few years later, during what was known in Halifax legal lore as 'the run on the docket.' Mr JusticeJ.W. Ritchie was presiding at the Supreme Court on Spring Garden Road. The case being argued at 12:45 looked as if it would continue into the afternoon; lawyers with cases pending betook themselves to lunch. But the case ended suddenly, so Justice Ritchie called for the next case. No lawyer. Another case was called. No lawyer. Thirty-two more cases were called, one by one. By this time the news had got to the lawyers' offices on Hollis Street, and Thompson came steaming up the hill past St Mary's to the courthouse. There he met his law clerk, Benjamin Russell. 'I informed him,' said Russell, 'that he was too late and saved him from the danger of collapse, which might more easily have taken place in his case than in some others.'43 Thompson was even then eating too well, as the 1879 portrait of him shows. Thompson had taken the twenty-year-old Benjamin Russell into his office in 1869 to help him with the Assembly debates. His father was Nathaniel Russell, a Dartmouth fish merchant and lobster canner. The elder Russell was also a justice of the peace in Dartmouth and was frequently called to preside over the infinite variety of small court cases that were the JP's lot. One morning as Russell was dressing for court, when he knew a request for a filiation order was coming up, his daughter said to him, 'Father, whom are you getting all dressed up today for?' 'Oh, my dear,' said Nathaniel Russell, 'nothing but whores and bastards.' 44 Perhaps as a result of these salty asides from his father, young Benjamin grew up with a taste for law, and used his work as reporter to subsidize study for the bar. He was admitted in 1872, but continued as reporter to the Assembly after Thompson gave it up in 1873, until 1883. He then became a professor of law at the new Dalhousie Law School. All his life Russell was to remember Thompson, a friendship, he said, 'unbroken by a single misunderstanding.' They worked together side by side on the debates for four years, though both men were out of harmony with the government that they so faithfully served. 'It was never supposed,' wrote Russell to Thompson in 1880, 'that we were not faithful and impartial\n\n32 Halifax Boy and Lawyer\n\nreporters, or that the character of the reports would have been improved by ... filling the place with a less skillful but more sympathetic officer.'45 By 1872, with reporting bringing in income and his law practice with Coombes growing, Thompson was able to consider buying a house. The Gottingen Street house was crowded, even though there were no children. In 1871 Annie had given birth to a baby girl, after a difficult first pregnancy; Annie had not been well, the baby was unusually large, and through the whole afternoon of 3 September 1871 her situation was critical. Finally the baby was born but could not survive the trauma and died in half an hour. That Annie was alive and safe was a vast relief to Thompson even with the loss of his firstchild .46 In May 1872, when Annie was three months pregnant with her second baby, Thompson bought the house called Willow Park. The house was the central section of what had once been a much larger property that had originally belonged to John Young, 'Agricola' as he was called, after the letters he published in 1822 urging Nova Scotians to make their farming more scientific. After Young's death the property had passed to Colonel B.H. Hornsby, a Civil War veteran from the South, who cut the estate into lots and began to sell them. Thompson bought the original Young house and its immediate grounds at the southwest corner of Windsor and Almon for $ 1 2 ,ooo, a very ambitious purchase. His down payment consisted of the property he had bought downtown in 1867; for the balance of $9,400, Colonel Hornsby gave Annie Thompson and J .S.D. Thompson jointly a mortgage at 6 per cent. 47 Thompson and Annie called their home Willow Park, as the district itself came to be called, and it was to remain theirs for all their married life. It was a commodious frame house, two stories, with big chimneys at each end. It had a fine bold front with a large main-floor veranda, reached from the ground by a flight of a dozen stairs. The roof leaked from time to time and inconveniently into the parlour; they never succeeded in quite remedying that. On cold nights in winter the nails of the house would contract with a snap that would sometimes keep Annie awake. It did not have indoor plumbing; the w.c. seems to have been in an attached building, probably heated. The house was on a big lot, over three hundred feet square, about two acres; it had a barn, a front field, and a back field; and every July the hay was cut. (The hay concession they rented out.) They kept hens. They had mice from time to time, Annie complaining once that she was quite lonesome without the patter of their feet after the Thompsons had acquired a big black cat.48 They had strawberry beds, some large trees - willows, perhaps - and enough frogs\n\n33 The Courting of Annie Affleck in the field to make choruses on summer evenings. Across Windsor Street was Hornsby's Nursery, with a large, glass hot-house that did not improve the view; but to the west and north there were plenty of fields still farmed . It was about a mile and a half to Thompson's modest law office downtown, and about half that distance to the old house on Gottingen Street where Thompson's mother still lived. Thompson's second child was safely born at Willow Park on 20 October 1872, and was christened a few days later by Archbishop Connolly with the archbishop's own name, John Thomas Connolly Thompson. The god-parents were Annie's brother and sister,James and Johanna Affleck, the latter now Sister Mary Helena with the Sisters of Charity at Mount St Vincent. 49 None of Thompson's children were to bear names of his side of the family. By this time Thompson's friends had been urging him to stand for alderman. At the civic election of October 187 1, the year before the birth of his son, Thompson was elected by the Catholic and Protestant ratepayers of Ward 5 to the city council of Halifax. He was not quite twenty-six years old.\n\n4\n\nThe Halifax of Alderman Thompson\n\nDisraeli used to say that every young man with political ambitions ought to start by getting his feet wet in local politics. Civic issues were sharp, the problems immediate, the taxes real, and the benefits and defects of city government laid out visibly. City politics could be savage; issues were close to home, narrow, and direct, and partisans often exigent and obstreperous. It threw into relief a man's quality, honest or mendacious, strong or weak, capable or incapable. On 13 September 1871 some seventy-eight electors in Ward 5 asked Thompson to stand for election, an invitation he accepted three days later. In the civic election of 1871, held on Monday, 2 October, Thompson won, 299 votes to 237, the second-largest majority of the six new aldermen. 1 Sworn into office on the following day, he would remain alderman of Ward 5 for six years, being re-elected by acclamation in 1874. The main characteristics of Halifax's civic structure were laid down in 1841, with a consolidation of its charter in 1864. Halifax was governed by a mayor and eighteen aldermen for its six wards. Six aldermen were elected for each year. The mayor was elected separately for a one-year term; re-election was common. Halifax's wards had remained unchanged since 1841. Inevitably, by 1871 the population was distributed very unevenly; Thompson's Ward 5 was the largest, containing one-third of the city's population. It was a slice of Halifax from sea to sea, from the harbour on the east to the Arm on the west, enclosed by Quinpool Road and Cogswell Street on the south, and Chebucto Road and North Street on the north. It was expanding rapidly in the early 1870s and there was considerable speculation in real estate. In order to encourage sales in his lots Colonel Hornsby in 1873 established a special omnibus to take residents the mile and a half into the city. It took\n\n35 The Halifax of Alderman Thompson thirty minutes to go from Willow Park to the downtown post office, the fare eight cents. Thompson took it frequently. The bus was drawn by two strong horses; coming out from town, a third horse was added to help haul the heavy yellow machine up the hill to Gottingen Street. The bus lasted until 1895 when it was absorbed into the city's new electric tramway system. 2 Halifax had still much of its old character. The city streets had been lit by gas since 1849; the gas company had the quaint but inconvenient habit of turning off the street lights on nights of the full moon. This arrangement would last until electricity came in 1886. 3 Most Halifax streets were still unpaved; in spring and summer, dust could blow in clouds for two or three days at a time. A shower of rain would bring the dust to a temporary end. Buildings that had not been seen for several days suddenly became visible. There were watercarts whose job it was to slake the streets; the complaints always were that they never mastered the ubiquitous dust. Halifax's sewers emptied into its sea inlets, the harbour and the North-West Arm. (They still do.) The original sewers had been designed to carry off water. The old pipes were crude stone or earthenware ones, subject to breakage since they were buried in the ironstone rock of the Halifax peninsula. The city hall maps were inaccurate. In 1873 E.H. Keating, Halifax's first city engineer, came out with a hard-hitting report: 'Many [sewers] are not two feet below the surface. They are to be found everywhere and anywhere but where they ought to be, ... When wanted no one knows where they are, unless occasionally some old inhabitant.' 4 New sewers were urgent as water closets began to replace the privy. By the 1870s most of the newer houses were installing them and they were slowly appearing in old ones. There was a good deal of makeshift in these arrangements; even in the new suburb of Willow Park, a surface drain carried sewage down to the harbour. Halifax's sewers had a reputation as far as Saint John, New Brunswick, ·where a writer complained of the smells exhaled by the gratings in Halifax streets. 5 Locals were casual about what they put out in the streets. Shopkeepers cleaned out Saturday night, leaving the result to be collected from the street; the noses of the church-goers on Sunday morning would be 'regaled with bouquet de squash pourri, together with triple extract of rotten cheese.' No doubt some of the forty-six hundred unregistered dogs loose in the city would solve the problem before the city did. 6 There were the beggars, old drunks, and young children, the last the hardest to ignore. Was it good or bad to give money to half-naked\n\n36 Halifax Boy and Lawyer children that solicited it? On 7 March 1 877 three children, the youngest a girl of four, were brought before the stipendiary magistrate charged with begging. They were sent home and the parents sought out. The father was a workman with fairly constant work; it was the mother who forced the children to beg, in order to buy gin. 7 Gin was a versatile substance. Thompson was amused at the story reported in Griffin's Evening Express. A horse and cart were on Market Wharf waiting to load potatoes from a schooner. Somehow the horse fell off the wharf, between the schooner and the piling. A boat had to be brought around to lead the frightened horse. This took some time; then it was discovered that there was no place for the poor beast to land and it had to be swum to the schooner slip at Queen's Wharf, some two hundred yards away. It was somehow got ashore. 'The horse was exhausted,' said the Evening Express, 'but was liberally supplied with gin and it revived.' 8 Wharves were treacherous but other parts of town were scarcely less so. There were numerous complaints at city council about the condition of the Grand Parade. Built and levelled in the Duke of Kent's time in Halifax, between 1794 and 1800, the Grand Parade belied its name, being the receptable of all manner of city rubbish, material and human. The ownership of the Parade was disputed between Dalhousie College, which occupied its north end, and the city. Neither would spend money fixing it up; there it was, with crumbling, dangerous walls, a broken-down wooden railing, a standing reproach to the city and a menace to its citizens. The city council that governed Halifax in Thompson's time had earned the sobriquet of the 'Bear Garden.' Personal quarrels, with the inevitable cliques and rancour, sometimes produced close votes, or ties that the mayor had to break. 9 There were regular meetings of council every fortnight, and numerous special ones. During the first six months of Thompson's incumbency as alderman, there was a council meeting a week. Calls to meetings did not always produce a quorum, for aldermen had their own professional work to do and they received no remuneration. The Halifax Express urged that aldermen be paid; many Halifax aldermen were fully equal to members of the Legislative Assembly, and therefore entitled to be paid. 10 It had no effect. The duties of alderman did not merely comprehend attendance at city council. Thompson had to serve on several committees, struck each year: the Laws and Privileges Committee, the City Prison Committee, and several ad hoc committees thrown in. The city council together with the city medical officer functioned as the civic Board of Health. In May 1873, during a smallpox epidemic, it decided to vaccinate some four thousand\n\n37 The Halifax of Alderman Thompson Haligonians at city expense. 11 There were also boards to which aldermen were appointed, the most important of which was the Halifax Board of School Commissioners. On top of everything else, an alderman, while in office, was a justice of the peace. Thompson's first move was characteristic of him: legal housekeeping. He liked to clean up, codify, render clarity out of confusion. Here his object was the confusion of laws surrounding the city's charter. The chairman of the Laws and Privileges Committee, Lawrence Power, proposed in November 1871 that the laws and by-laws of the city be revised. By mid-December he and Thompson had a draft ready. It ran into difficulties. A motion to abandon the whole scheme was narrowly defeated in March 18r2, and Thompson, recognizing the inevitable, proposed instead that they confine themselves to a few simple amendments. Even so, that passed only with the casting vote of the mayor. One result was the creation of the Board of Works, on which was to fall the burden of maintaining the streets. 12 Thompson returned to the issue in the autumn of 1872. He proposed that Ward 5 be split into two, in view of the gross under-representation of its people on city council. This move was struck down by a vote of ten to seven. The Committee on Laws and Privileges was again given the job of revising the charter. 13 Two things emerged. The new consolidation of the city's charter was printed in 1873, under the editorship of Power and Thompson. Secondly, the province authorized the appointment of a new city auditor. Thompson and Power both felt that it was essential to make a beginning on straightening out the city's tangled accounts. In December 1874 the auditor was appointed by the usual method - open vote in council. Approval of city officials was always by open vote; it had been laid down that way in the charter. There were seven candidates for city auditor, two aldermen among them: William Taylor, chairman of the Board of Works, who received no votes at all from his colleagues; and Alderman C.C. Vaux, who got special permission from council to vote for himself! The result was a tie between Vaux (who had, indeed, voted for himself), and John Bell. The mayor gave the casting vote for Bell, who was sworn into office on 2 January 1875. He was then fifty-eight years old; he was to remain in office for another twenty-seven years, dying in it in 1901. 14 The tangle in the city's accounts was aggravated by some problems peculiar to Halifax. A substantial proportion of Halifax property was owned by government - the imperial government, the Dominion government, the Nova Scotian government- none of whom paid taxes or\n\n38 Halifax Boy and Lawyer any funds in lieu of taxes. Thus the full burden of supporting the city fell upon its private citizens. When Thompson first took his seat on council Halifax's debt was over one million dollars. As a result of the development of the water system, the sewer system, and the erection of a new city hall, it would reach two million by 1891. 15 Halifax's estimated expenses for the year 1 May 1872 to 30 April 1873 were $110,000. City receipts included an anticipated $12,000 from liquor and auction licences, and $3,500 from police court fines. Citizens were assessed for the balance. Added to that were assessments for institutions and payments authorized by provincial law, the most important of which was $50,000 to the Board of School Commissioners, as well as an additional $10,000 for the Commissioners for Poor; these items in effect doubled the original assessment. 16 It was anything but easy to keep expenditure within revenue. The main cause was non-payment of t"
