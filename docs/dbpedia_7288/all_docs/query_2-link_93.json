        "text": "Pictonians at Home and Abroad, Chapter 5 CHAPTER V\n\nTHE BENCH AND THE BAR\n\nThe first practicing lawyer in the County, as far as is known, was Nicholas Purdue Olding.\n\nFor many years he was not only the father but the grandfather of the Bar. Born in England,\n\n1751; educated at Oxford; his friends intended him for the Church, but on completing his\n\ncourse, he turned his attention to law. Having finished his law course, he came to America\n\nat the time of the American Revolution and took arms in defence of the mother country. At\n\nthe close of the war, he came to Halifax with his wife and two children.\n\nIn 1784 he was admitted to the Bar, and entered upon the practice of his profession with\n\ngreat promise. But he had received a wound in the head, which rendered him unfit for the\n\nexcitement of the Bar and the social habits of the time. About 1797 he received a grant of\n\nland at Merigomish from Governor Wentworth. Soon afterwards he moved there and settled on\n\nPoint Betty Island, where he lived the remainder of his life.\n\nHe did not regularly practice as a barrister, but did considerable law business, writing\n\ndeeds and issuing legal documents. He generally attended the court at Pictou until near the\n\nclose of his life. Though brought up in the Church of England, he joined the Presbyterian\n\nChurch, under Dr. McGregor's ministry. His wife died in 1841 in the 87th year of her age,\n\nand he in 1845, in his ninety-fifth year. They had lived together for the long period of\n\nsixty-four years. Mr. Olding was well educated, had a high sense of honor, and maintained\n\nthroughout his life a reputation for integrity and justice.\n\nAmong the early members of the legal profession in the county were: Robert Hatton, who came\n\nfrom Ireland in 1813; Thomas Dickson, who was a Colchester man; Henry Blackadar of Halifax,\n\nwho represented the district in the legislature for nearly a dozen years; Martin I. Wilkins,\n\nborn at Windsor, practiced law in Pictou, and afterwards became Prothonotary of Supreme Court\n\nin Halifax, which office he held up to time of his death. He was a Barrister of marked\n\nability, but was rather eccentric in his manner. Daniel Dickson, born at Truro, N. S., died\n\nDecember 27, 1878, was father of Wm. A. Dickson of Pictou. A. C. McDonald the second son of\n\nGeorge McDonald was born at the West River in 1821. Having been admitted to the Bar, he\n\nentered into partnership with Daniel Dickson for the practice of law. In 1853 he married\n\nSarah Brown DeWolfe of Pugwash. He died in 1869, in the forty-eighth year of his age. He was\n\na man of good judgment; and fair dealing characterized his legal career.\n\nJohn MacKinlay, son of Rev. John MacKinlay at one time pastor of Prince St. Church, practiced\n\nlaw in Pictou town for many years and died there December 1888. James Fogo, was born in\n\nGlasgow, came to Pictou when a lad, was educated at Pictou Academy, studied law in the office\n\nof Jotham Blanchard, was admitted to the bar in 1837, became Judge of Probate 1850. He died\n\nin 1897. Edward Roach was a native of Cumberland County and practiced in New Glasgow. David\n\nMatheson was born at West River and died September 1886. For the last twenty-five years of\n\nhis life he was Prothonotary and Clerk to County Court at Pictou.\n\nOne of the best known of the earlier members of the bar, was Jotham Blanchard. He was, by\n\nbirth, a New Englander, but by education and residence a Pictonian. Inasmuch as his whole\n\npublic life was spent in Pictou, the County can fairly claim him as one of her sons. Mr.\n\nBlanchard was born at Peterboro, N., H., in 1800. He was the eldest son of Jonathan\n\nBlanchard. When he was fifteen months old, his parents removed with him to Truro. A few\n\nyears later the family removed to West River, Pictou, where his father bought George\n\nMcConnell's farm and built what was known as the Ten Mile House.\n\nAfterwards they removed to Pictou Town, where Jotham studied at Pictou Academy, being one of\n\nthe first class of students in that institution. He studied law in the office of Thomas\n\nDickson, and was admitted to the Bar in 1821. He soon became one of the most eminent\n\npractitioners in Eastern Nova Scotia. His time and energies were largely devoted to fearless\n\nadvocacy of popular rights and to support of Pictou Academy and higher education.\n\nMr. Blanchard was an able lawyer, a keen debater, a forceful writer; and he used his powers\n\nunstintedly for the best interests of the country. He ended his brilliant career in 1840 in\n\nthe fortieth year of his age and it is not to the credit of his fellow countrymen, that his\n\ngrave lies unmarked in the Old Cemetery in Pictou.\n\nHon. Hiram Blanchard was born in Pictou, in 1820, educated at Pictou Academy, and called to\n\nthe bar of Nova Scotia in 1843, when only twenty-three years of age. He practiced law for\n\nsome years in Halifax. He represented the County of Inverness in the Legislature for several\n\nyears, and was for a short time Premier of the Province. He died in 1874.\n\nSir Charles Townsend, Chief Justice of Nova Scotia says: \"Hiram Blanchard was at one time\n\nregarded as one of the best and most successful lawyers in the Province. While he could not\n\nbe called a well-read and diligent student of the law, yet he possessed in an eminent degree,\n\nthe faculty of quickly absorbing all the facts, and the law bearing thereon in the case in\n\nhand.\" He was a brother of Jotham Blanchard.\n\nA well-known name of later years, was that of Hon. James McDonald, who was born at\n\nBridgeville, East River, July 1, 1828. He was familiarly known and honored by his generation\n\nin Pictou County as \"Jim\" McDonald. His family was among the first Scottish Highlanders who\n\ncame to Nova Scotia and settled on the East River. His grandfather, James Macdonald, known\n\nas \"The Deacon,\" was one of the founders of the Anti-Burgher Church, and, like all the family\n\nwas in politics a strong Radical. His father settled in New Glasgow where his son was\n\neducated. Some of the older people still remember him as the bright, active lad, who without\n\nany advantages, got himself an education and fought his way up to the high position of Chief\n\nJustice of the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia. He studied law in the office of the well-known\n\nHon. Martin I. Wilkins and was admitted to the Bar when only twenty-three years of age.\n\nHe practiced law first in Pictou for twelve years, and in 1863 removed to Halifax where he\n\nwas conspicuous among the leaders of the Bar. In 1878 he was made Minister of Justice in the\n\nSir John Macdonald's Government. He was appointed Chief Justice of Nova Scotia in 1881;\n\nretiring on a pension in 1904, he was presented with a handsome piece of silver by the bar of\n\nNova Scotia as a testimonial. He declined the honor of Knighthood, and passed the closing\n\ndays of his life at \"Blink Bonnie\" on the Northwest Arm, where he died October 3, 1912, in\n\nthe 85th year of his age. Almost his entire life was spent in his native province.\n\nHe was married, in 1856, to Jane Mortimer of Pictou, by whom he had a large family. Two of\n\nhis sons are in the legal profession; Wallace McDonald at Edmonton, Alta., and James A.\n\nMcDonald at Halifax. One of his daughters is married to Sir Hibbert Tupper, Victoria, B. C.,\n\nand another to Mr. Stuart Tupper, Winnipeg, Man., both sons of Sir Charles Tupper, a third is\n\nmarried to the Rev. L. H. Jordan, D. D., Oxford, England. In that great historic debate of\n\ngiants in what is known as the Pacific Railway Scandal, in 1873, the palm was unanimously\n\nawarded to Hon. James McDonald, for his aggressive debating power and skill in defence. At\n\nthat time Sir John A. Macdonald said of him, \"As true as steel; and is, I think, the ablest\n\nman in the House of Commons.\"\n\nOn the first day of October, 1845, there was born at East River another lad, who afterwards\n\nbecame one of Pictou's most popular sons, Duncan C. Fraser. He too, was without material\n\nadvantages; but he was of good Scottish ancestry. By push and perseverance he worked his way\n\nup until he attained the Governorship of the Province.\n\nHe received his education in the common schools, and later at the Normal School, Truro.\n\nAfter graduating with a B.A. degree from Dalhousie College, he taught school for some time\n\nbefore being called to the bar in 1873. He had a strong instinct for political life, and was\n\na popular debater. Local politics paved the way for his career at Ottawa, where he\n\nrepresented the County of Guysboro for many years. He occupied a seat on the, Bench of the\n\nSupreme Court of Nova Scotia for a few years, but gave it up to take the Lieutenant\n\nGovernorship of Nova Scotia. His appointment was received with acclamation, and he was very\n\npopular with the people.\n\nGovernor Fraser had a notable career in Parliament, at the Bar, and on the Bench. His\n\ninfluence was widely felt throughout the country. He was one of the best stump speakers of\n\nhis day, a rare story-teller, and a genial companion. Because of his ready wit and powers of\n\noratory he stood out prominently in the public life of his time.\n\nHe received the degree of LL. D., from Dalhousie College, and D.C.L., from St. Francis Xavier\n\nand King's Colleges. He died in 1910. In 1878 he married Bessie G. Graham of New Glasgow.\n\nOne of his sons, Alister Fraser, is practicing law at Moose Jaw, Sask.\n\nHon. James G. Forbes, has for nineteen years been County Court Judge of St. John, N. B., and\n\na pillar of the Presbyterian Church of that city. For many years he has been connected with\n\nthe Canadian Bible Society and the Lord's Day Alliance and also with the British and Foreign\n\nSociety of London, of which he is one of the Vice Presidents.\n\nHe is a brother of the Revs. John F. and Adam G. Forbes and a native of the County, born in\n\n1838. He took a course in law at Harvard University, and was admitted to the bar in 1865.\n\nHe was long a successful practitioner in St. John where he has resided for over half a\n\ncentury.\n\nHon. Angus McGillivray was admitted to the bar in 1874, practiced in Antigonish, and was\n\nretained in many important cases, civil and criminal. He was appointed Judge of the County\n\nCourt in 1902 and was Speaker of the House of Assembly in 1883. He resides at Antigonish, N.\n\nS.\n\nEast River has the distinction of having given to Canada, three political leaders, Hon. James\n\nMcDonald, Hon. D. C. Fraser, and Hon. Simon H. Holmes. Mr. Holmes was born at Springville,\n\nin 1831, a son of Hon. John Holmes, Senator. He was admitted to the bar, and practiced\n\nsuccessfully in Pictou for many years, devoting part of his time to journalism. For four\n\nyears he was Premier of the Province. He resides at Halifax where he has been Prothonotary\n\nof the Supreme Court for thirty-two years.\n\nJohn D. McLeod is at present, Judge of Probate for the County of Pictou, a position he has\n\nheld for a number of years. He was born at West River, being descended from an old Highland\n\nfamily, was educated at Pictou Academy, studied law, and was admitted as a barrister in 1866.\n\nCharles D. Macdonald, B.A., son of A. C. Macdonald, was born in Pictou in 1854. He entered\n\nDalhousie College in 1869 when only 15 years of age. At 21 he was admitted to the bar. He\n\npracticed in his native place until 1890, when he removed to Halifax. In 1897 he located in\n\nEdmonton, Alta., where he died some years later. He was a brilliant linguist. For several\n\nyears he was editor of the Pictou News.\n\nHon. George Geddie Patterson was born at Green Hill, and is a son of the late Rev. George\n\nPatterson, D. D.
