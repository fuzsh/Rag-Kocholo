Highlights of his career include: Assistant Deputy Minister (ADM) of Field Operations in the Ministry of Natural Resources Saskatchewan, ADM of Water, ADM of Policy, Planning and Research in the Department of the Environment and ADM of Parks Canada.

He joined the Canadian Navy in September 1950, where his career spanned 27 years including two tours during the Korean War. In 1977, he retired as a Warrant Officer but remained a lifetime member of the Chiefs' and P.O.'s Association. He then joined Canada Post in 1978 and remained there for the next 14 years. Don was an avid golfer and sports enthusiast, enjoying years as a spectator of his sons and grandkids both in baseball and soccer. He served on the executive of Gorge Soccer, and was a regular of the Saturday 4 O'Clock Club. He enjoyed his spring trips to Arizona as well as numerous trips to Disneyland with the grandkids. There were many years of laughs and good memories at the house with neighbours and lifetime friends met through the military and sports. The family wishes to thank Dr. Medhurst for years of care, as well as the staff at VGH ICU and 6 North for the special treatment he received during his time there. We would also like to thank our friends and family for their thoughtfulness during this difficult time. Don was small in stature but large in life, and we will miss that quick sense of humour. No service at Don's request. Dad, in your next journey, don't be flipping the cheeseburgers. Love always. You will be missed.

Wayne was born in Halifax on Oct 6th, 1948. He was predeceased by his parents Edward and Iris Ramsay. Wayne was one of six children, with the youngest, Richard, being his loyal caregiver during the last couple of years of Wayne's life. Wayne is survived by his biological children: Mark, April, Mae, and June of Nova Scotia, and Angela and Ashley of New Brunswick. Additionally, stepchildren: Jamie, Shauna and Jody, also of New Brunswick. Wayne was also the grandfather of too many children to mention :) Wayne grew up in Halifax and he loved playing baseball in the commons as a young boy. Later in his life, he would bring his children to the commons and play. He joined the Navy at a young age and then became a porter in the Victoria General Hospital. Wayne did the best he could given his life circumstances and conquered many obstacles throughout his journey. He took great pride in his children. He adored that his boy was a boxer. He was extremely proud for fathering such beautiful girls. Although Wayne appeared to have a \"chip on his shoulder\", he had a very soft soul. During his later years, he admitted to many of his faults and asked for forgiveness. He regretted not being able to be a better father to all of his children and stepchildren. During the last few years of Wayne's life, he enjoyed his humble abode with a beautiful view of the water from his balcony. There will not be a service dedicated to Wayne, however, cremation will be taken place this week and Wayne's ashes will be spread in the Ocean and at a \"secret\" spot where he spent many days as a child.\n\nCURLEIGH, Colin M.

He was predeceased by his son Neil, sisters, Helen and Dorothy, and brother Bill as well as countless lifetime friends. Survived by his loving wife of 64 years, Shelagh (McKnight), sons, Doug (Angie, Mark and Michele) and Bob (Christy, Erin and Ian), daughter Eileen and daughter-in-law Cindy (Kailie and Nikki), and great-grandson Tyson. Don was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan and moved to 457 Kingston Row in Winnipeg in 1939. Dad attended St. Johns College from 1939 to 1942 after which he joined the Royal Canadian Navy and served in the Second World War as a communications officer seeing action on the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean. Mom and Dad met through a mutual group of friends, the group would party together and go to dances. Mom had her eye on the tall smooth talker and even warned her friends to watch him and not be swayed by his good looks and wit. Luckily Mom didn't take her own advice and after 64 years of marriage their love continued to grow. An accomplished sales and management professional, Dad spent the majority of his working life dedicated to the automotive industry. Dad started his career as sales and district manager for Imperial Oil, a short time after he purchased the Imperial Esso Station on Portage and Mount Royal. Dad was offered a position at General Motors as a fleet manager in Winnipeg, Calgary and London, Ontario. Dad returned to Winnipeg in 1970 to work with his lifetime friends at Birchwood Motors and in 1972 he became President and General Manager at National Toyota. Dad operated a number of dealerships until he opened his own business, Woodhaven Toyota in 1978. Dad's long time passion was selling cars. He returned to Birchwood Motors to work with his lifelong friend Robert Chipman where for 31 years he took care of thousands of repeat customers until an unfortunate broken hip forced his retirement at age 83. Dad continued to have customers call him at home where he would take the information and pass it onto his longterm sales partners, Steve Mestrovic and Dennis Verrier. A natural athlete, Dad participated in many sports excelling in swimming. Dad swam for the Royal Canadian Navy Team and the Manitoba Tankers. In 1947 he won the Canadian Title competing in a three mile lake race and many other events across Canada. Dad combined his love of family and nature by always ensuring we had a place to enjoy at the lake. Seasonal trailer sites at Falcon and then Granite Lake led to the purchase of the family cottage in 1971 at Granite Lake, Ontario where we have had many years of great memories. We are very fortunate to share the lake with many great neighbours, Mom and Dad's longtime friends, Bob and Edna Convey on one side and 46 years of friendship with family's on the other side with the Bailie's and the Ainley's. Dad enjoyed swimming to the neighbour's docks for a visit. With his strong front crawl he covered the distance in no time, even his last swim two summers ago. Dad also enjoyed sailing with his sisters and brother and fishing with the boys. We will remember Dad for many things, his great physical and mental strength, his love for family and friends, his kindness and willingness to understand and support, to see beyond the negative and encourage and develop the positive, as well as his determination and drive to stay focused on all of the good things in life. In his last few days he repeated many times, \"Love, Family, Friends, Peace.\" \"Keep on Keepin On.\" The family would like to express their appreciation to the staff at Deer Lodge for their dedication and compassionate care they provided Dad. As per Don's wishes, cremation has taken place. There will be a family service to follow. Flowers are gratefully declined. Dad had a soft spot for animals and if so inclined, a donation in Dad's name to the Winnipeg Humane Society would be greatly appreciated. Rest in Peace Dad, we love you!

A feisty, individualistic and fearless young man, Steve joined the Canadian Navy at the age of 19, after spending several years working as a linesman for the Cape Breton Power Corporation. His 25 years with the Navy took him across the globe; he served on the HMCS Nootka, Haida, Bonaventure, Swansea and many others. He was especially proud of his wartime service in Korea, for which he was recently awarded the Ambassador for Peace Medal from the Republic of Korea. After he was honourably discharged in 1974, he worked at the Halifax Dockyards as a rigger. Although Steve and his wife of 61 years, Anita, lived in many different places in Canada and the United States, their fondest memories centered on their years in England, where Steve trained on submarines, as well as their many excursions to their cottage in Molega Lake. For his entire life, Steve was an ardent pigeon fancier, and won many races as a member of numerous Canadian and American pigeon clubs. He was also an enthusiastic boxing fan, having developed his passion for the sport as a talented amateur boxer in Cape Breton and the Navy. Steves other lifelong love was pool; his fiercely competitive nature made him a skilful player who would happily challenge anyone to a game. Steve is survived by his children, Patricia (Michael), Roxanne, Deborah, Steve (Diane), and Christina (Lea); his grandchildren, Jordan, Shayne, Derrick, Amanda, Dustin and Lauren; and his great-grandson, Hunter.

A blend of intellect, character, passion, humour, and, (particularly once his kids grew up), joyfulness, he cherished being a father, grandfather and great-grandfather. He will be missed by family in Canada, Trinidad and around the world. Dad was born in Siperia, Trinidad where, at the age of 14, he left school to work in the oil fields to support his mother and eight siblings upon the illness and subsequent death of his father. Obtaining his high school diploma through correspondence courses, he came to Winnipeg in 1949 to attend the University of Manitoba. On his second day in Canada, he met Frances Helen Brown, then a recent pharmacy graduate, whose family owned the boarding house where he would live for the next few years. Dad and Frances, our mom, married in 1953. Dad became a teacher and they had the seven of us children. They moved to St. Norbert in 1959 where they lived and were active in the community until they became residents at Deer Lodge Centre in 2015. While in university, Dad joined the Canadian Naval Reserve, achieving the rank of Lieutenant Commander (Major). The Navy remained a significant part of his entire life and the Canadian Armed Forces was a source of support through his final years at Deer Lodge Centre. In the 1960s, Dad started an apiary (honey farm) having learned beekeeping from his father as a child. Sons Gerry and James spent many summers working hard at Dad's side and getting stung while the rest of us enjoyed honey comb, fresh out of the hive. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, while teaching English and French, Dad started writing and had two stage plays (one in English and one in French) produced in Winnipeg and Brandon by St. Norbert's Theatre St. Genese company. George Atwell was an extraordinary man and we are truly fortunate to have had him as our father so long into our lives. A person of unshakeable integrity and character, along with our mother, he will remain our moral compass always. Dad was predeceased by his loving wife of almost 62 years, our mom, Frances, his sisters, Lucille, Ella and Ruth and his brothers, Arthur, Frank and Harold. He is survived by his brother, John, his sister, Phyllis, his children, Carol (Richard), Judy (Paul), Jocelyn (Ken), Gerry, Vincent (Angie), James (Suzanne) and Cathleen (Simon), his grandchildren Sean, Carla (Darrin), Brendan (Jarita), Nicola, Bennet, Kim and Julien, great-grandchildren Caleb and Jacob, as well as family around the world.

Raised in the tiny Icelandic community of Gimli, Manitoba, he didn't speak English until he was 6 years old. A child of the \"dirty thirties\", Lloyd worked hard from a young age, chopping wood, and cutting and selling blocks of ice from Lake Winnipeg in winter to earn 5 cents an hour. But Lloyd also had fun swimming in Lake Winnipeg, diving off the local lighthouse, running 10 miles to compete in a local track meet, and captaining his high school track, baseball and hockey teams. In December, 1942, Lloyd joined the Canadian Navy becoming an able seaman. He served for 3 years on a small Corvette in the North Atlantic, developing a lifelong dislike of British mutton and green peas! Lloyd's ship was on active duty in the English Channel at Normandy on June 6, 1945 (D-Day). Upon his discharge in November, 1945, Lloyd was decorated with a Voluntary Service Medal and an Overseas Service Medal. Lloyd attended the University of British Columbia on the GI bill, receiving a Bachelor of Commerce degree in Accounting in just 3 years. Between 1947 and 1949, Lloyd also played first string right wing for the UBC Thunderbirds Varsity Hockey Team, earning one small and two big block letters. One of his proudest moments was being inducted in 2002 with his T-Bird teammates into the UBC Sports Hall of Fame. In 1950, Lloyd moved to Calgary to work for Texaco as a District Landman. Lloyd left Texaco in 1962 to join Atlantic Richfield. In 1976, he started his own company (Torfason Land Consulting) working as a Petroleum Land Consultant, retiring in 1988. In 1954, he married Edna (Balmforth) Torfason and together they raised 3 daughters. Edna was a keen skier and Lloyd had to learn to ski or be left behind. Skiing quickly became his passion, with many wonderful days spent with family and friends. Lloyd was a founding member of the Calgary Seniors Alpine Ski Club, and he skied every winter until age 82. After Edna's death in 1991, Lloyd spent several years on his own, before marrying long-time family friend, Lucille (Turcotte) Boyle, in 2000. Lucille and her large family quickly became an important part of \"Grandpa T's\" life, providing much company and joy. Lloyd and Lucille travelled extensively, cruising the world's oceans with friends, until shortly before Lucille's death in 2013. Lloyd loved to tease Lucille that no matter how many trips they took, she'd never catch up to his number of days at sea! Lloyd enjoyed reading and staying current on world events and sports. He loved to ski, cycle, curl and play hockey, as well as watch hockey and football. He was very sociable and delighted in hosting others. Although quiet, polite and reserved, Lloyd loved to tease and be teased. Lloyd truly lived \"a life well loved\", making many good friends and creating special memories for everyone around him. Lloyd was predeceased by his parents Sigurdur and Margaret Torfason, his three sisters and their husbands, Margaret (Edo) Vanni (Seattle), and Evelyn (Ben) Plottel and Donna (Bernie) Hauschka (Vancouver), his first and second wives, Edna (Balmforth) Torfason and Lucille (Turcotte) Boyle, and by his first wife Edna's family. He is survived by his three daughters, Lynn Torfason (Mike Allen), Lois Torfason (Rick Buckley), and Carol Winston (Nick Winston), four grandchildren (Shannon Buckley, Andrew Buckley, Kate Winston and Greg Winston), four nieces and nephews, and by his second wife Lucille's family. The family wishes to extend our sincere thanks to all the staff at CareWest Colonel Belcher, the Vets' Angels, and especially to Susan Hughes, Lloyd's fun and caring companion at All About Seniors, for the love, care and compassion you showed Dad in his final years. We love you Dad and will miss you. A simple gathering to remember Lloyd is planned for late September, and will be announced at a future date.
