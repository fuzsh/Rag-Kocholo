D.\n\nTHE FIRST SETTLERS\n\nBy the Indians this river was called Caijebouguac (perhaps: lonely river,\n\nbut with what reference it were only guess-work to say). The name 'River\n\nJohn' is of French origin, the Cape being called Cap Jean on documents\n\ndated before the first Protestant settlers arrived. By the English the\n\nwater was named Deception River; who was deceived and wherein the deception\n\nlay history fails to record. Such a name could not endure among an honest\n\npeople. If any one name be more appropriate than another that one\n\ncertainly is what it bears; for no name seems to have been so dear to its\n\nearly inhabitants as this of JOHN. There were in almost all their families\n\na John, John George, John Frederic, &c. River John is a beautifully\n\neuphonious name which has not become so well and widely known as it\n\ndeserves, because the hundreds of vessels built here were registered in and\n\ndesignated from other larger ports.\n\nThe first settlers at River John were four men and their families, who were\n\ntoo free and independent to settle in Tatamagouche as tenants under Colonel\n\nDesBarres, who refused to sell land. At River John the land was owned by a\n\nCompany* which was ready to dispose of it. In 1785 John Frederic\n\nPatriquin, John George Patriquin, George Frederic Langill and James Gratto\n\ntook up their abode at River John. They built their log huts near each\n\nother on the hill on Smith's Point, where they intended to build a\n\nfortification for defence against the Indians. When additional settlers\n\ncame this plan was abandoned and each built on his own land.\n\n[*The Philadelphia Company, who received it in 1765. See Patterson's\n\nHistory of Pictou County, pages 52.ff for a good account of this Company.]\n\nJohn Frederic Patriquin owned the land now occupied by Mr. C. H..\n\nMacLennan, but returned in five year's time to Tatamagouche. His brother,\n\nJohn George, took up the farm next below this, which he later sold to the\n\nRev. John Mitchell. His also was the farm where Alexr. Heighton now\n\nresides, and there he lived after the original plan of village life was\n\ngiven up and until, in old age, he went to live with his son David on the\n\nMountain Road.\n\nJames Gratto (son of George, one of the first settlers of Tatamagouche)\n\ntook up land next to John George Patriquin below Smith's Point.\n\nGeorge Langill (or Langille) was the oldest son of John James Langill only\n\nson of David Langill by his first wife. His stay in River John covered\n\nvery few years. He removed to New Annan and became the ancestor of the\n\nLangills of that district.\n\nIn the last quarter of the eighteenth century there were many more Indians\n\nin the country than now, and they were by no means so law-abiding. As they\n\ntravelled in bands they were formidable foes to the scattered settlers.\n\nThey were openly opposed to any settlement of whites along this coast, and\n\nwere instigated by French emissaries to harass the settlers, a work they\n\nfound much to their own liking. The fear of the Indians was ever on the\n\nwhite man, who knew their many cruelties to small settlements and to\n\nchildren left unprotected.\n\nAt the time of the French revolutionary war the Micmacs had not shown much\n\nfriendship to the British. In 1779 the whole tribe, from Miramachi to\n\nGabarus, gathered in council at Fraser's Point to consult as to the course\n\nto be pursued in opposition to the new settlers. Against all expectation\n\nthe council broke up quietly. In 1808 the Indians expected an invasion of\n\nthe country by the French, were holding themselves neutral until they\n\nshould see the strength of each party, ready to join the strongest, and\n\nopenly threatened what they intended doing in case of French supremacy.\n\nVery pathetic was the loss of George Patriquin's oldest son Frederic, only\n\nfive years of age. He set out in company with his father and uncle, who\n\nwere driving the uncle's cattle to Tatamagouche, whither he was removing.\n\nThe others, deeming the boy unfit for such a toilsome journey, sent him\n\nback; but he never reached home. He was a timid child, who would not\n\ndisturb a fly on a chip he might wish to pick up. Some Indians were in the\n\nneighborhood and left about that time, and it was thought that they\n\nkidnapped him. His bereaved mother used to walk about at the edge of the\n\nwoods on MacDonald's Hill and call his name, receiving no answer except the\n\nweird echo of her own voice.\n\nIn 1790 George Langill, only son of David's brother Matthew, exchanged his\n\nfarm (where Tatamagouche village now stands) for that of John Frederic\n\nPatriquin, and settled at River John. At the same time George Matatall,\n\nGeorge Bigney and George Joudry took up residence here.\n\nIn the following year the brothers, Christopher and George Perrin, came\n\nfrom Lunenburg direct. Probably in the same year the ancestors of the\n\nMarshville and Louisville Langills were added to the growing settlement:\n\nJohn David, John George, John Frederic and John Lewis, the children of\n\nDavid Langill by his third wife. John Lewis was the first to occupy land\n\nin Louisville; the others settled in Marshville. Doubtless at that time\n\nthere were in this vicinity other families of whose early arrival record\n\nhas not been kept.\n\nIn the winter of 1793 an emissary of the New Lights (as the Baptists then\n\nwere called) threw the little community into a state of excitement over his\n\nstrange teaching. The settlers were all Calvinistic and steadfast in sound\n\nBiblical doctrine; yet lest any might swerve from the faith under the\n\nnew-fangled light and that all might be strengthened and comforted, John\n\nFrederic Langill and George Patriquin went through the woods to Pictou to\n\nbring the Rev. Dr. James MacGregor (who had come to Pictou in 1786) to\n\nRiver John. On their return journey with Dr. MacGregor, they entered the\n\npathless unblazed woods about the (after named) Three Mile House and came\n\nout near where the Oak Church now stands. They performed the trip on\n\nsnowshoes.\n\nThis visit of Dr. MacGregor was not only the quenching of the New Lights,\n\nbut also the kindling of new life in the little community. He preached in\n\none of the houses on Smith's Point, visited all the families and\n\nadministered baptism. From here he visited Tatamagouche and Wallace, which\n\nhad 14 and 20 families respectively. River John had a second benefit on\n\nhis return journey. How often, that winter and many following, was his\n\nvisit recalled around the blazing fire, and his words repeated. His faith\n\nand faithfulness made a lasting impression.\n\nIn the Summer of 1795 Dr. MacGregor again visited River John and the other\n\nplaces along the shore.\n\nSome more settlers, including the West, Hines and Gammon families, came\n\nbefore the end of the century.\n\nIt was in the new century that Lewis Tattrie took up the well-known Tattrie\n\nplace*\n\n*[The grant of 2400 acres of land to John Langill, George Langill, Peter\n\nMatatall, Lewis Tattrie. Lewis Langill, and George Joudrie, is dated 23\n\nFebruary 1815. These men were on the ground before that date, Lewis\n\nLangill probably in 1798, Matatall in 1802 and Tattrie in 1807.]\n\nThese people who were gathering to form the future flock of Mr. Mitchell\n\nwere not of French descent although they were French-speaking. The\n\nLangills were of Swiss origin. Their father David was twice married in his\n\nnative land, having one son by his first wife. A widower the second time,\n\nas he was sailing down the Rhine he fell in love with a fellow passenger, a\n\nyoung and pious widow of a Spanish soldier. They were married on the\n\nship's arrival at Rotterdam, from whence they sailed to Portsmouth in\n\ncompany with many others who, at the invitation of George II., left the\n\npersecutions on account of religion in the homeland to enjoy the freedom of\n\nconscience and the broad acres he promised. This honeymoon trip was quite\n\nunlike the modern tour to Niagara or Paris, for added to the then ordinary\n\ntrials of travel they were forsaken by those who had induced them to come\n\nso far and left destitute. The British Government was induced to help\n\nthem, and at last after so hungry a winter they were embarked aboard four\n\nvessels, two bound for Nova Scotia and two for North Carolina. In the\n\nSpring of 1753 the two vessels landed 224 immigrants on George's Island in\n\nHalifax Harbor, among whom were David Langill and his brother Matthew and\n\ntheir families. Thence they went to Lunenburg; but seventeen years later\n\nsome of them were persuaded by Colonel DesBarres to remove to his lands in\n\nTatamagouche. The Langills, Tattries, Patriquins, and Matatalls formed\n\npart of this migration.\n\nThe Patriquins and Tattries were from Montbeliard, a town and district\n\nwhich, belonging to Wutermberg in 1524, received the gospel by the\n\npreaching of Farel, and belonging to France (by the treachery of Louis\n\nXIV.) in the eighteenth century, it lost much of its liberty of life and\n\nworship. Montbeliard was a border region, sharing most largely in Swiss\n\nand German blood and in the French language.\n\nThese early settlers were of the stuff saints and martyrs are made of. Georg\n\ne Tattrie (the father of Lewis already mentioned) had shown the true martyr\n\nspirit in his fatherland. He was a soldier in the French army and fought\n\nin the battle of Fontenoy (1745). After his return from the army, orders\n\nwere given to deliver one of the Protestant churches to the Roman Catholics\n\n(1752). With forty-nine others George Tattrie gave resistance to the\n\nsoldiers who came to hand over the church to the priest. Their only\n\nweapons were stones and so they were compelled to surrender, after two of\n\ntheir number had been killed and others wounded. Tattrie was among the\n\nwounded. So soon as he was able he joined a party bound for the British\n\npossessions in America. Such experiences gave rise to a deeper loyalty to\n\ntruth and a dislike of the French. From Rotterdam on, Tattrie was a fellow\n\ntraveller with David Langill, until he finally settled at Tatamagouche on\n\nthe French River, where his son Lewis was born in 1785.\n\nThe Perrins were engaged in silk manufacture in Loches in Touraine, France.\n\nWhilst John was from home, his father and uncle were imprisoned because of\n\ntheir steadfastness to Christ and His Word. On his return, learning of the\n\nrenewed and determined persecution of the reformed religion, John with\n\neighteen others went into a boat by night and rowed down the River Loire,\n\nnear the mouth of which they discovered a British frigate which brought\n\nthem to Portsmouth. There they joined the other emigrants for Nova Scotia,\n\nand with them came to Lunenburg, where John Perrin settled. His two sons,\n\nas already said, came to River John, George building at the Creek and\n\nChristopher on the hill between the present village and the railway\n\nstation.\n\nThe mother-tongue of these first settlers was a dialect of French. They\n\ncould read the, French Bible and other books, with an intelligent\n\nunderstanding. They must have also picked up a good deal of English; for\n\nfluent as Dr. MacGregor was in Gaelic, it is not claimed that he could\n\npreach in French. Their first pastor seems to have had no difficulty in\n\nmaking himself understood by them, but says on his first visit to them,\n\n\"They understand English well.\" They had the intelligence and largeness of\n\noutlook of people who speak more than one language.\n\nAlthough for twenty-three years after the arrival of the first settlers\n\nthey had no regular pastor, yet they were not indifferent to religion and\n\nmorality. They had their religious meetings, at which George Patriquin,\n\nJohn George Langill and, later, Christopher Perrin used to lead them to the\n\nthrone of grace and instruct them in the simple yet saving elements of\n\ngospel truth. Thus the community was saved from that decline into\n\nungodliness which overtook some neighboring settlements. There may have\n\nbeen exceptions; Matthew Langill, the brother of David, was one. He had\n\nbeen a light-horseman in the French army, settled in Tatamagouche, made no\n\nkind of success as a farmer, and removing to River John, lived with his son\n\nuntil his death in 1800 at the age of 76 years. He left the impression\n\nthat he was a quarrelsome man, a character which his descendants did not\n\nseek to perpetuate.\n\nAttention was early given to education. Christopher Perrin was the first\n\nschoolmaster, teaching the young people to read, write and count in French.\n\nAs a whole these pioneers who planted River John formed a law-abiding,\n\nGod-fearing, self-respecting community, and they who have inherited their\n\nblood have that whereof to be justly proud if they follow their example of\n\nsteadfastness to Christ and His Church.\n\nTHE REV. JOHN MITCHELL\n\nThe Reverend John Mitchell was born in Newcastle-on-Tyne, England, in the\n\nSpring of 1765. Of his parents it will suffice here to say that they came\n\nfrom Scotland after their marriage, that his mother was a pious woman, and\n\nthat his father was of a different character, decent but irreligious, kind\n\nto his own but without feeling toward God. The father was a flour\n\nmerchant, and had ten sons and three daughters, John being the eldest.\n\nThey were all at home on New Year's Day 1791, but four of them died in the\n\nnext five years and another was lost to knowledge of his friends, whilst\n\nthe whole family was scattered.\n\nJohn received a fairly good common school education, and adopted the trade\n\nof rope-making, which left him long afternoons and evenings of leisure\n\nwithout work or care. In Summer he was free at one, in Winter at four in\n\nthe afternoon. The tradesman's leisure-time makes or mars his life. Young\n\nMitchell spent his evenings heedlessly and wickedly. Indeed he tells us he\n\nchose this trade because of its leisure for wickedness. He was as\n\nregardless of religion as his father until he was about eighteen years of\n\nage. Writing in 1797 he says:-\n\n\"I might notice the goodness of God to me before conversion, especially in\n\nhis preserving me three times from being drowned on the Lord's day, and one\n\nof the times in a miraculous manner. Wonder, O heavens, and be astonished,\n\nO earth, at the love of God in Christ to me; for though I was openly\n\nprofaning his holy day, yet he interposed on my behalf, and saved me from\n\ndrowning and perishing in my sins, when no human help could be given me.\n\nBut ah! ungrateful wretch, I did not consider his mercies, but persisted in\n\nopen rebellion against him.\n\n\"The appointed time always drew nearer when God was to manifest his\n\nsovereign and rich grace, in effectually calling me from darkness into his\n\nmarvellous light. Being a little convinced of my folly I began to attend\n\nthe means of grace, and regularly attended for about one year. No\n\npersuasion or reproaches from my old companions, were able to keep me away.\n\nBut, alas! I heard the minister preach and did not understand him. Still\n\nI thought all was well, if I attended the meeting; and that there was no\n\nneed of so much fuss about religion. I contented myself without reading or\n\npraying, and was happy when I met with any that would join me in\n\nreproaching the true worshippers of the meek and lowly Jesus, because I\n\nthought myself better than they were.\n\n\"But when God was pleased to call me by his grace, I beheld things in\n\nanother light. The first time He began a saving work upon my heart was, if\n\nI mistake not, in the year 1784. It occurred one day when I was attending\n\nthe horse-races in Newcastle. Great trouble of mind came upon me. The\n\ntrouble I endured, and the happiness I felt when the race was over, I never\n\nwill be able to express. From that wicked place I went with a full\n\nresolution never to return any more; and blessed be God, I have been\n\nenabled to keep it. The next day, when others were going to see the races,\n\nI went out to the fields to pray, read and meditate. The Bible became\n\nprecious to me, prayer my delight, and divine contemplations exceedingly\n\nsweet to my soul. When I compared the surpassing pleasures I experienced\n\nin this new employ with what I used to find in the races, I was lost in\n\nwonder and admiration.\"\n\nFrom that time forward he spent his leisure mostly in this same gracious\n\nand helpful pleasure of reading the Scriptures, meditation and prayer. The\n\nthorough change in his disposition was observed by all, and especially\n\npleasing to himself was the transformation in his memory, which he found\n\nweakened to sinful and trifling things but strengthened to retain the words\n\nand works of God. He made public profession of his faith and was admitted\n\nto the full communion of the Church.\n\nHaving received the light himself, this lad of nineteen years did all he\n\ncould to impart it to others. He became even more diligent in studying the\n\nBible lest his ignorance should let an opportunity slip of influencing\n\nother lives for God. He reasoned and pled with those of his own age to\n\nturn from sin and to serve the Lord. Especially did he strive for the\n\nreclaiming of his own father and brothers. He did not find himself so free\n\nat home as he could wish, to speak to them of their lives and the spiritual\n\nworld, so he gladly accepted an opportunity which occurred in 1790 of going\n\nto London, and afterwards to Woolwich. In the Autumn of 1792 he visited\n\nhis home on his way to Scotland, where, in Glasgow, Greenock and Gourock,\n\nhe resided until 1797.\n\nOf his correspondence at this time thirty-eight letters to his family were\n\nextant a few years ago. These manifested the man John Mitchell was\n\nbecoming to be. Of news there was little, but he plied his father and\n\nbrothers with appeals, with the Word of God and all manner of argument from\n\nreason and experience, to move them to the great resolve. After two years\n\nof such strong, loving letters, he is able to write:-\n\n\"Dear Brothers, How pleased was I to hear that the vanities and pleasures\n\nof the world are become your burden, and to love and serve the Lord Jesus\n\nChrist your chief delight, and I hope I may give God thanks for His\n\ndistinguishing love to you in passing by others who are no worse, and\n\nplucking you as brands from the burning, and inclining your hearts to keep\n\nHis statutes, and making the time you spend in solitude the sweetest hours\n\nyou enjoy.\"\n\nAnd a little later:-\n\n\"How glad was I to hear that you had joined yourselves to the Lord, and to\n\nprove the sincerity of your love to him, have obeyed his dying command, and\n\nsolemnly confessed him to be your Lord and Master before men, angels and\n\ndevils. All this I hope you have done willingly and not of constraint, for\n\nall the true lovers of Zion's King are volunteers, whom he makes willing in\n\nthe day of His power.\"\n\nTo his sister, who had married a sea-faring man, John writes as to one who\n\nhad a share with him in the love and religion of his Lord, and when two of\n\nher children were taken away by death, very comforting indeed were his\n\nletters.\n\nDuring all those years (1790-1797) his letters to his father contained\n\nearnest and strong appeals to serve the Lord. In 1795 the father was very\n\nsick, supposed to be dying; and among many such earnest words he wrote:-\n\n\"O Father, if you have any love for your immortal soul and desire that it\n\nmay be saved from the wrath to come, believe in the Lord Jesus, that he is\n\nboth willing and able to save you. We had a sudden parting the last time I\n\ntook farewell of you. As the ship was under sail I was obliged to run and\n\nleave you. But if you believe in Christ and come to him by faith and\n\nprayer, we shall have a joyful meeting in glory and never more part.\"\n\nHis father recovered. In the following year his mother died and he wrote:-\n\n\"Dear Father, many a sorrowful hour she spent and many a watery eye she had\n\non account of your sins and neglect of Christian duties; and without a\n\ndoubt she went down to her grave sorrowing for you. Often have I heard her\n\npraying for you in the silent watches of the night....Consider therefore\n\nthese things, believe in Christ and repent of your evil ways. It is not\n\ntoo late....Jesus is willing that you should be saved for though He gave\n\nyou the first summons, He has spared you last and given you time to\n\nrepent.\"\n\nHis pleadings and prayers had influence beyond what at the time was\n\napparent. In 1797 the father died, and John writes: \"My dear brothers and\n\nsister, our parents have not left us houses and lands, but they have left\n\nus their dying words for our instruction and sweet texts upon which we may\n\npreach their funeral sermons. The last words of our beloved mother were\n\namong the last words of a beloved disciple of Jesus, Come quickly, Lord\n\nJesus. And the last words of our dear father were the first words of the\n\nwoman of Canaan when she began to worship Christ, Lord, help me.\"\n\nFor fourteen years did John Mitchell hear the Call \"Go preach\" in his soul,\n\nand whilst laboring as best he could with voice and pen for the Master, he\n\nwas working to pave the way to the ministry. At last in the autumn of 1797\n\nhe entered Hoxton Academy, an institution founded for the purpose of\n\ntraining ministers of the gospel. Before being admitted to its classes he\n\nhad to give a narrative of his religious experience and call to the\n\nministry, and from this document we learn much of the heart and life of the\n\nyoung Mitchell. At the Academy he took a three years' course of\n\ninstruction, for which he had whilst in Glasgow prepared himself by\n\nattending evening classes.\n\nHaving completed his studies Mr. Mitchell was ordained and sent forth in\n\nthe company with the Rev. John Clerk Benton, by the London Missionary\n\nSociety which was founded by the members of different denominations in\n\n1795. They left London 17 March 1800 and Liverpool seven days later, and\n\narrived at Quebec after ten weeks upon the water. Mr. Benton remained in\n\nQuebec and Mr. Mitchell visited Montreal, where he preached in a\n\nschoolhouse every Sabbath evening from Aug. 3 to Oct. 5. He had here about\n\n120 hearers, belonging mostly to the Church Scotland.\n\nThe people of New Carlisle having petitioned for a minister, Mr. Mitchell\n\nwent thither, mainly because the Montreal friends were able to offer a\n\ngood stipend and could easily obtain a minister, whilst the New Carlisle\n\npeople were poor. Against the desires of the former he said, \"The cries of\n\nthe poor on the Bay are more pressing than the cry of the rich in\n\nMontreal.\"\n\nTaking up his work at New Carlisle in November 1800, he found no lack of\n\ncalls to industry. Without a church building, he preached, taught Sabbath\n\nSchool (using the Shorter Catechism), visited, established a praying\n\nsociety, etc., and even taught a day school for the children of the poor.\n\nIn March 1801 he visited Restigouche. Of his return trip he says, \"We had\n\none of the worst journeys I ever experienced, crossing rivers on pieces of\n\nice, while half up the leg in water, climbing over mountains of ice heaved\n\nupon the shore by the current, travelling through woods in the snow five\n\nfeet deep, in which we sank at every step, and wading over small rivers.\n\nWe were four days travelling in this condition.\" He visited Restigouche\n\nagain in October 1802.\n\nAt New Carlisle opposition was given him by those whose lives were rebuked\n\nby the simple enunciation of the law of God, English people who worked and\n\nfrolicked on the Sabbath, blasphemed their Maker, and baptized each other's\n\nchildren (thinking that sufficient to save them damnation). The chief\n\nopposition, of course, came from the wealthier who saw vanishing their\n\npower to grind seven days' work out of those depending on them for\n\nsupplies. Some who at first attended the preaching of the truth now\n\nrefused to come because they feared the opposers. Mr. Mitchell, yearning\n\nfor the welfare of friend and foe alike, strongly appealed to his Society\n\nto send a Church of England missionary to the ignorant and lawless English\n\npeople for whose salvation he so longed and prayed.\n\nNotwithstanding the strong, malignant and untiring opposition, his work\n\nprogressed, sinners were converted, the young instructed and the true\n\nsaints edified. On 5 May 1801 he writes, \"The praying society mentioned in\n\nmy journal is still continued. The time I was at Restigouche about sixty\n\nof them met every Lord's Day to pray and to read a sermon and examine the\n\nchildren....In the course of nine months I have travelled eight hundred\n\nmiles, travelled twice two hundred in the winter, twice for nine days I\n\nhad no bed to lie upon, and my clothes were never off; and I preached about\n\none hundred sermons; and blessed be God I am none the worse of my journeys,\n\nand enjoy a good state of health to the present day.\"\n\nAt New Carlisle Mr. Mitchell married Janet Shearer, the daughter of a\n\nBritish Empire Loyalist who, originally from Carlisle, England, came to\n\nChaieurs Bay from the south at the time of the American Revolution.\n\nIn 1803 he made an extensive tour to Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. From\n\nBay Chaleurs he sailed to the Gut of Canso, where he twice preached. He\n\nthen visited and preached at Antigonish, Merigomish and Pictou Harbor. Two\n\ndays and a night were spent at the home of the Rev. Duncan Ross, with whom\n\nhe had a feast of spiritual fellowship.\n\nMr. Mitchell came to River John on Thursday, 5 May, and preached that and\n\nthe next day to about forty people and baptized eight children. Of the\n\npeople he says, \"They understand English well.\" From River John he\n\nproceeded to Tatamagouche, Wallace, River Phillip, Amherst, Hopewell, N.\n\nB., Shediac, Shemogue, Richibucto, and a number of places on the Miramichi.\n\nOn his return to New Carlisle Mr. Mitchell prepared to leave that place.\n\nGreat was the sorrow of the majority of the people at his departure. He\n\nintended to move to Hopewell. With his wife and son John he made a stormy\n\npassage in an open boat to Shemogue and Bay Verte. They rode across to\n\nWestmoreland but finding no boat to cross to Hopewell, they went on to\n\nAmherst, where the entreaties of the people constrained to him to remain.\n\nThis in September 1803.\n\nIn August 1804 he undertook another extensive and arduous evangelistic\n\ntour through New Brunswick and in September came to Londonderry, N.S., by\n\nboat from Campobello. He preached at two places between here and home and\n\narrived at Amherst on 20 September. The following extracts from his\n\njournal written on this trip are of interest as indicating the spirit and\n\nmethod of this zealous ambassador of the Lord Jesus Christ:--\n\n\"Lord's Day, August 12. (At the Kennebecasis River) Preached and baptized\n\nfour children. As it was late on Saturday evening before I arrived (having\n\nridden 14 miles and walked 11 miles on that day), I had only about forty\n\nhearers, who were all that heard I was going to preach: but though my\n\nauditory was small, my soul was made glad to see them so attentive and\n\naffected. This river is settled for forty or fifty miles. There is a\n\nChurch of England minister here, but the people in general call themselves\n\nNew Lights. It appears to me from the conversation I have had with some of\n\nthe inhabitants as I travelled down this river, that if a missionary were\n\nstationed here and wholly supported by the Society for some time, he would\n\nhave at different places large congregations, and it is probable he might\n\nbe the honored instrument of winning many precious souls to our glorious\n\nImmanuel.\n\n\"13th. Travelled down the river twenty-nine miles, and as it was\n\nextremely hot, and having to carry my portmanteau, I was much fatigued in\n\nbody, but blessed by God, my mind was greatly refreshed with some sweet\n\nmeditations upon divine things.\n\n\"Lord's Day, Augt. 19th. Travelled eight miles through the woods to the\n\nMacaguadavic River, where I preached to about fifty hearers--all very\n\nattentive and some apparently greatly affected. In the evening, sailed in\n\na boat up the river about six miles, and called upon a Col. MacKay, a\n\nScottish gentleman, who appears to be a well wisher to the cause and the\n\ngood of immortal souls. 20th. Preached to about forty people who all\n\nappeared to be much affected; and spent the rest of the week with the\n\nColonel visiting the inhabitants on the river. They in general appeared to\n\nbe concerned about the one thing needful, and I hope that the Lord has\n\nbegun a good work in the souls of many of them, which He will carry on till\n\nthe day of Christ. Lord's Day, 26th. After sailing down the river about\n\n8 miles, preached twice, had about three or four hundred hearers, and a\n\nmore attentive auditory I never saw, while tears were flowing in abundance\n\nfrom the eyes of many. When I parted with them, many of them could not\n\nspeak for weeping. After preaching, sailed with the Colonel eight miles in\n\na boat to Mascarene, where I preached on the Monday.\n\n\"28th. The Colonel and I left Mascarene in the evening and next day\n\ntravelled eight miles through the woods to Digdegwash river, the next\n\nsettlement to Macaguadavic, where we spent the most of the week visiting\n\nthe inhabitants. On the Lord's day preached here, had about 300 hearers\n\nwho appeared to be as much affected under the word as the people of\n\nMacaguadavic were. A minister settled at Macaguadavic would have upward\n\nof 100 families within a few miles of him. The inhabitants are in general\n\nScottish Americans. They are able to support a minister and are desirous\n\nof having one.\n\n\"Sept. 11th. On account of the wind and rain our boat could not sail and\n\nat the earnest solicitation of the people, I preached in the afternoon and\n\nbaptized five children, and one young woman, which gave me a peculiar\n\nopportunity of speaking to the young people that were hearing me. After I\n\nhad pronounced the blessing, both old and young sat down and wept under a\n\ndeep concern about the salvation of their souls. After we were sitting\n\nsome considerable time two young women (who were sisters) came to me with\n\ntears running down their cheeks and told me they had a desire out of love\n\nto their dear Saviour to be baptized, and were willing this evening in a\n\npublic manner to dedicate themselves to the Lord. After conversing with\n\nthem for about a quarter of an hour, I promised to preach and baptize them\n\nin the evening. So the people dismissed and all returned after the sun was\n\nset, and a more solemn night and greater liberty of speaking I never before\n\nexperienced and a mere serious and affected auditory I never saw.\"\n\nOf his journals the Rev Dr. Patterson says, \"They tell their own tale of\n\nlabor and hardship. We believe they warrant us in saying that if ever\n\nthere was a man ready to endure toil and to sacrifice ease and comfort that\n\nhe might preach the gospel to the destitute, John Mitchell was the man.\"\n\nIn Amherst he was much encouraged by the people and the blessing of God\n\nupon his work. He would have about three hundred hearers in the summer\n\nseason. With many other expressions of esteem and affection the people\n\ngave him a farm (the Berry farm), a horse and two cows. No party opposed\n\nhim here, the work was comparatively light. He had no occasion to leave\n\nexcept the call of the destitute.\n\nSeeing that the people of Amherst were well able to support a minister, and\n\nknowing from his own observation and the reports of others, of the\n\nspiritual destitution along these shores, Mr. Mitchell in the summer of\n\n1808 came to River John and took up the pastoral oversight of River John\n\nand Tatamagouche. In the following year he was received by the Presbytery\n\nof Pictou.* He also removed his family to River John (1809), having\n\npurchased\n\nthe Mitchell farm from George Patriquin.\n\n[*He was a Presbyterian in all but connection hitherto. His parents were\n\nScottish, he had communed with the Presbyterians in Scotland for five\n\nyears, studied in their schools and taught in their Sabbath Schools. He\n\ninherited the incomparable traditions of Presbyterianism, and imbibed its\n\nlove of liberty, reverence for the pure gospel, and sympathy with the\n\noppressed. It would have been a painful wrench for him to join any other\n\ncommunion. He never sought ordination other than he received.]\n\nIt is said that at that time there were fifty families in the River John\n\ncommunity of whom only three were English-speaking. We doubt the accuracy\n\nof both figures. We have no reason to suppose that there were more than 50\n\nfamilies in all his extended parish nor that there were fewer than five\n\nEnglish-speaking families at River John, at the time of his settlement.\n\nHe gave monthly services to Tatamagouche on the Lord's Day, preaching at\n\nfirst in one of the larger houses in winter, and in Mr. Wellwood Waugh's\n\nbarn in summer, and later in the Willow Church which was built through his\n\nefforts and those of Mr. Waugh.\n\nIn 1813 John Bell settled in New Annan, and immediately connected himself\n\nwith Mr. Mitchell's congregation, in which he was soon ordained an elder.\n\nHe attended the meetings of Synod in 1819 and 1822 as representative \"from\n\nRiver John.\" The minutes of 1820 give \"Wm Currie from River John,\" a\n\nmistake for John Currie, the father of our present esteemed and venerable\n\nProfessor of Hebrew.\n\nIn 1817 Wm. Byers, Thomas Swan, James MacGeorge and Wm. Scott settled in\n\nNew Annan and shortly thereafter Mr. Mitchell began a monthly service\n\nthere. A praying society (that is, a regular weekly prayermeeting) was\n\nalso formed in that small but growing community of pious people.\n\nThe relations of Mr. Mitchell with New Annan were specially happy. The way\n\nthither was long, especially in summer, along the shore on foot to\n\nTatamagouche, and then up the French River; but there was cheer and a\n\nhearty welcome at the end. Some of the young men used to come down the\n\nriver side to meet him and take him to his lodgings. I can see the face of\n\nyoung Bell or Byers or Swan, smiling through the trees of the primitive\n\nforest on the dearly loved pastor on the confines of sixty years of age,\n\nand I can feel how his tired step was revived at the meeting.\n\nThe field was wide and its spiritual cultivation arduous. In winter, on\n\nmany Sabbaths, the larger portion of his people could gather at one church.\n\nAbout thirty years ago I heard the old people of New Annan tell how they\n\nwere wont on a Sabbath morning to skate on the ice down the French River\n\nand along the shore to the church at River John, attend two services, and\n\nreturn home the same evening. In 1826 Tatamagouche and New Annan felt\n\nstrong enough to call a minister for themselves and with Mr. Mitchell's\n\nhearty consent the Rev. Hugh Ross was inducted there. The people around\n\nthe Willow Church were unfeignedly attached to Mr. Mitchell and desired him\n\nstill to continue their pastor, Mr. Ross supplying the new church in\n\nTatamagouche village. But Mr. Mitchell, closely as he was attached to\n\nthose his parishioners, felt that they would be better served by the nearer\n\ncentre and advised them to fall in with their nearest neighbors. He was a\n\nman of gentle disposition, who did not grasp at his own advantage but\n\nsought the general good and the spiritual welfare of others. When in\n\n1839-40 Tatamagouche wished to dispense with the services of Mr. Ross, the\n\nRiver John minister refused to share in the dispute.\n\nWhilst true blue to the faith delivered to the saints, Mr. Mitchell was in\n\nnowise narrow or bigoted. He got on peacefully with the Methodists, who\n\nwere invited by Christopher Perrin to give services at River John. When\n\nthe Rev. Mr. MacConnachie of the Church of Scotland at Saltsprings was\n\nvisiting those at the River whose leanings were toward that Church, Angus\n\nChisholm and Alexr. Chisholm (tailor) waited on Mr. Mitchell to ask for the\n\nuse of his church. The request was gladly granted by our Pastor, who\n\nannounced and attended the service. When the Rev. C. Elliott of the Church\n\nof England came to gather the members of his denomination together the\n\nchurch was freely given to him, and in it he held his services until the\n\nfirst Episcopal building was opened. Mr. Mitchell recognized not only that\n\nwe live in a free country and each has a right to use his own judgment but\n\nalso the deeper truth that it is through hearty denominational service that\n\nGod's work is carried on in the individual as well as in the world. The\n\nmeans of service are the means of grace, and my own Church must supply\n\nthese to me if at all it presents the Lord Jesus as the object of my soul's\n\nworship and love. He wrote a tract on \"Why are you not an Armenian?\"\n\ncontending with deep spiritual insight for the paramount importance of the\n\nPresbyterian belief, yet conceded that one might serve Christ while\n\naccepting Wesleyan doctrine or Episcopal government as truly though not so\n\nwell as if he heartily embraced the Presbyterian faith and polity.\n\nThe sphere of his labours being narrowed by elimination of New Annan and\n\nTatamagouche Mr. Mitchell gave himself to a more particular cultivation of\n\nspiritual work within its more easily reached bounds. Prayermeetings and\n\nSabbath Schools he had previously established and now was able for a few\n\nyears to give them needed aid. The last fifteen years of his life were\n\ngiven to River John, but not to the exclusion of attendance at Presbytery\n\nand Synod and the assistance of his brethren at sacramental and other\n\nspecial services.\n\nDuring Mr. Mitchell's pastorate the community was increasing rapidly in\n\nnumber and commercial enterprise. Vessels were laden with lumber removed\n\nfrom the land. Every summer vessels visited the harbor; from these some\n\nEnglish sailors would make their escape and settle in the vicinity to form\n\na not very desirable element in that quiet society. In 1825 the first\n\nvessel was built at the River by Robert MacKay (who built and lived in the\n\nMacQuarrie house), a Mr. Nichols being foreman and Roderic MacGregor of New\n\nGlasgow one of the workmen. From this time shipbuilding became one of the\n\nchief industries of River John for about seventy years.\n\nThe time of our Pastor's departure drew near. In April 1841 he was away\n\nfrom home on duty and slept in a cold bed in a cold room. He returned home\n\nand preached on Sabbath, the 25th., apparently in his usual health. In the\n\nforenoon he spoke of God as the Sun and Shield of believers, Psalm 84: 11.\n\nAt that time he was lecturing in the afternoons on The Revelation and that\n\nday he lectured on the epistle to the Church at Sardis (in the third\n\nchapter). Gradually the disease gained strength until Saturday he was not\n\nable to arise from bed, and on the following Saturday (8 May 1841) he\n\npeacefully passed away, sleeping in that Jesus whom he loved and served.\n\nIn his last illness the theme of his preaching was still the subject of\n\nconversation: the love of the Lord Jesus to poor lost sinners.\n\nMr. Mitchell was so the servant of the Holy Spirit that his labors were not\n\nin vain. He was ardently pious and devoted to the cause of his Master\n\nJesus our God and Saviour. He lent his aid to every good cause, yet never\n\nentered into the greater strifes of his times. He was diligent and\n\nfaithful and kind. Around him arose a band of men of like spirit the\n\ninfluence of whose lives still sweetens the atmosphere of the community.\n\nAlthough in his time the Methodists and Anglicans hived off from the rest\n\nof the people, it was not that they objected to our Pastor, but because\n\nthey wished to go to their own. No ill feelings were engendered by these\n\nmovements. He simply took care that his own people were instructed in the\n\nfoundation principles of their holy religion.\n\nHe was a diligent student and made up in this way for the lateness of his\n\nentry upon an academic curriculum. He left behind him many manuscripts,\n\nembracing his journal of travels and work, which is historically of great\n\nvalue as evidence of the religious, moral and material conditions in the\n\nmany places he visited; his letters to his friends; essays entitled \"Plan\n\nfor a Christian Reform,\" and \"Rules for Regulating Prayermeetings;\" a\n\nvolume containing 26 meditations on various passages of Scripture; and a\n\nhost of smaller volumes of sermons and lectures. As a preacher our Pastor\n\nwas simple, forceful and earnest in presenting his message, and pleasant\n\ncountenance, his tall, well proportioned, sinewy build, and his\n\nNorthumberland burr gave him a good introduction to his audience. He was\n\nfond of allegories and of allegorizing; his discourses were full of Bible\n\nlanguage, images and doctrine.\n\nTHE REV. JAMES WADDELL\n\nI.\n\nAN ADDRESS\n\nBy Mr. W. H. Waddell, delivered at the\n\nCentennial Celebration, 20 August 1908\n\nThe year 1908 will be long remembered in the annals of our country. The\n\nter-centenary of the foundation of Quebec, which has recently been\n\ncelebrated with unprecedented pomp, and participated in by three of the\n\ngreatest nations of the world; the semi-tercentenary of the establishment\n\nof representative institutions in the British Colonies, which only\n\nyesterday was signalized by appropriate ceremonies in the capital city of\n\nour province; and today the centenary of the organization of this\n\ncongregation;- these national, provincial and local events will be ever\n\nassociated in the minds of those here today, and make the year one to be\n\nremembered with pride and gratitude by us all.\n\nIt is certainly fitting that we should embrace the opportunities these\n\noccasions afford us to bring to mind the heroic deeds and patient toilings\n\nof our fathers, and raise our voices in praise and thanksgiving to the All\n\nFather for the blessings and privileges which we enjoy as the result of the\n\ntoils and privations of those who have gone before, and who now rest from\n\ntheir labors.\n\nThe part which has been assigned to me in the proceedings of this occasion\n\nis one which ought to be very congenial to the feelings of a son whose\n\nfilial devotion is allowed to express itself without fear of being regarded\n\nfulsome or extravagant. Before making any remarks of my own in reference\n\nto my father's life and work, I ask your permission to read an estimate of\n\nhis character and abilities by the Rev. John Sprott whose name, a half\n\ncentury ago, was a household word throughout the length and breadth of the\n\nMaritime Provinces. Mr. Sprott assisted at a communion service in River\n\nJohn on Nov. 7th, 1847. In the book of memorials edited by his son, the\n\nRev. George Sprott, D. D., of North Berwick, Scotland, I find these words\n\nin a letter written by him in July, 1862, shortly before my father was\n\ncalled to Sheet Harbor, Halifax County:-\n\n\"I am glad that the people of the Eastern Shore are making an effort to\n\nretain the services of the Rev. James Waddell. I hope that by making a\n\nstrong pull, a long pull, and a pull all together, they will be able to\n\nsustain him... Mr. Waddell is the man for the shore. He is not like a\n\nnewly fledged divine just from school. He is a man of wisdom and\n\nexperience, and has many seals of his ministry. Few ministers have made\n\ndeeper investments of love and affection, toils and labors in Nova Scotia,\n\nthan Mr. Waddell. He has never had a fat living and whatever may be the\n\ncause of this, it is not owing to his want of talents and acquirements.\n\nHad he gone into the navy, he would have gained the quarter deck; had he\n\ngone into the army, if not killed at the battle of Waterloo, by this time\n\nhe might have been the head of a regiment; had he gone to the bar, he might\n\nnow have been upon the bench; but because he made choice of a holy\n\nprofession, he, with many other excellent men, is compelled to pitch his\n\ntent at no great distance from humble poverty. James Waddell ought to be\n\nthe finest blood of the Church, being the son of the Rev. John Waddell of\n\nTruro. I dare not say that he equals his father as a preacher, yet when I\n\nhear him in prayer, I think I hear his father's voice. Both excelled in\n\nprayer-- a noble gift for a minister.\"\n\nMy grandfather, mentioned in this extract, was sent out from Scotland in\n\n1797, by what was then known as the Associate Synod, afterwards merged in\n\nthe United Presbyterian Church. He was settled in Truro, as the second\n\nminister of the metropolis of Presbyterianism. His wife was Miss Blanchard\n\nof Empire Royalist stock from New Hampshire. As a son of the manse, my\n\nfather had all the advantages which accompanied that priviledge. I have\n\nheard him say that as a youth he rather enjoyed the companionship of the\n\nChurch of England minister who lived on the adjoining property, and who\n\ntaught him to play chess, and that Mr. Barnyeat's woodpile had more\n\nattractions for him, than the one in his father's dooryard. I have reason\n\nto think that his choice of profession cost him a struggle, as his\n\ncompanions were a rollicking set of fellows, and he was naturally of an\n\nardent and impulsive temperament. He early took his stand as a total\n\nabstainer, in days when drinking was more fashionable than it is now, and\n\nhe afterwards attained some prominence as a temperance lecturer.\n\nLicensed in 1830 and ordained in 1831, he became pastor of Bathurst\n\ncongregation in the north of New Brunswick. After remaining there a few\n\nyears, he was appointed to the position in Central Academy, Charlottestown\n\nnow Prince of Wales College. While engaged as a teacher, I find that he\n\nfrequently if not habitually occupied the pulpit on Sunday.\n\nIn Prince Edward Island he was brought into close touch with the Rev. John\n\nGeddie, who was, if I mistake not, his classmate at Pictou Acdemy. He\n\nsympathised heartily with the movement which resulted in the appointment of\n\nMr. Geddie as the pioneer Presbyterian foreign missionary of British North\n\nAmerica. On the formation of the Foreign Mission Board in the year 1845,\n\nhe was appointed its first secretary, and thus was the medium of official\n\ncommunication between the missionaries and the Church for about ten years,\n\nduring the early struggles of our pioneers in the new Hebrides. I remember\n\nwell the interest attached to the receipt of letters from Mr. and Mrs.\n\nGeddie, which in those days of sailing ships would be from six months to a\n\nyear old when they were received. Private letters from Mr. and Mrs. Geddie\n\nto my father and mother showed that their correspondence with one another\n\nwas the communion of dear friends whose affection was thus cherished for\n\nlong years though they were separated by so many thousand miles.\n\nWhen Mr. Geddie was home on furlough in 1865, it was my priviledge to drive\n\nhim from Halifax to Sheet Harbor to visit my father and his congregation.\n\nBesides being prominent in the missionary work of the Church, my father was\n\nmost enthusiastic in the cause of general education, and especially in the\n\ntheological seminary conducted at West River under the Rev. James Ross,\n\nafterwards Principal of Dalhousie College. In 1848 during his visit to the\n\nold country, he was engaged in making known to the Churches there the\n\neducational needs of our Church in Nova Scotia, and succeeded in collecting\n\nquite a sum of money for the funds of the institution. In 1852 he visited\n\nthe United States in the interest of the Seminary.\n\nOf his ministry in this Congregation I am probably not so competent to\n\nspeak as some of its older members here present, but I think that any such\n\nwho had the means of knowing will bear me out in saying that he was\n\nfaithful in the performance of his pastoral duties, in visiting the sick,\n\nand in holding prayermeetings in different sections of the congregation,\n\nbesides preaching two sermons on Sabbath with a short interval between.\n\nThe first discourse, if I remember rightly, was mainly expository, and the\n\nsermon after the intermission of a more practical character. He had the\n\nhabit of writing out copious notes of his sermons using a variety of\n\nabbreviations known only to himself.\n\nI cannot recall with any clearness the characteristics of his style, but\n\nthis I know that it was marked by the prominence of scriptural language and\n\nquotations, and his illustrations were drawn from Bible scenes and\n\ncharacters. His library was limited, and consisted mainly of theological\n\nand missionary works. I remember that, on one occasion, he advised me to\n\nstudy Solomon's Proverbs rather than Shakespeare. I knew Bunyan's\n\nPilgrim's Progress almost by heart, but had never heard of Gulliver's\n\nTravels. The first poem I read under his direction was Pollok's \"Course of\n\nTime.\" Dull as Pollok may seem to modern students, he developed in me a\n\ntaste for poetry which I trust I have not altogether lost. Cowper, I know,\n\nwas a favorite with my father, as I remember distinctly that he would often\n\nrecite long passages from \"The Task.\" Grahame's \"Sabbath\" was another\n\ngreat favorite. But he was essentially a man of one book; Henry's and\n\nScott's commentaries, and Guyse's Paraphrase were in constant use, but the\n\nBible itself without note or comment was his chief text book.\n\nThe religious education of the young of the congregation was his especial\n\ncare, and the catechising of the children was a very definite and important\n\npart of his pastoral visitations. The home training which he practised and\n\ninculcated upon his people, included much reading of Scripture on Sabbath\n\nevenings, and a thorough mastery of the Shorter Catechism. The Sabbath\n\nSchool conducted in the church was in my time superintended by Mr. Thomas\n\nB. Gould and psalms and paraphrases learned there have never been\n\nforgotten. Besides the Paraphrases five hymns at the end of the\n\nParaphrases constituted the complete humnal of the Church at that time.\n\nThe communion season was made the occasion of much spiritual interest. The\n\nThursday previous was a fast day, kept most devoutly as a holy day.\n\nServices were also conducted on the Saturday before and the Monday after\n\ncommunion. The minister was, on these occasions, almost invariably\n\nassisted by a neighboring pastor.\n\nMy father was a great pains to enlist the women and children especially in\n\nmissionary and Bible society work. I think I shall not be guilty of making\n\nany invidious distinction in mentioning the name of one lady who was not\n\nonly a warm personal friend of my father and mother, but an efficient and\n\nfaithful helper in every good work---the late Mrs. Alexander MacKenzie,\n\nwhose benevolent countenance I distinctly remember, and whose kind\n\nministrations to the sick and needy endeared her to all who came within her\n\nreach. Though she has long since gone to her reward she is still\n\nremembered with affection by many who enjoyed her tender interest in their\n\nwelfare. It is gratifying to know that her descendants are among the\n\nactive helpers in the congregation.\n\nDuring my father's incumbency, the glebe of some five or six acres was\n\ndonated to the church by Mr. William Matheson, the father of Mrs. Robert\n\nPatterson whose homestead was on the property now owned by Dr. Collie.\n\nThis fact may account for the gift of the land to the congregation for the\n\nuse of the minister. Mr. Matheson was, however, an intimate friend of my\n\nfather. This congregation is certainly to be congratulated on having so\n\ndesirable a manse and glebe.\n\nIn the social and public life of the community my father took a great\n\ninterest. His ideals of life were high, and as a puritan of the puritans,\n\nhostility to the prevalent evils could always be counted upon. His zeal in\n\nthe cause of temperance and purity often caused him disfavor, to say the\n\nleast. Errors which he may have committed in carrying out his views were\n\nerrors of the head rather than of the heart.\n\nFond of innovations that tended to improvement, he was not a faddist. The\n\nonly instance I can recall, as indicating any approach to faddism, was a\n\ndesire to attach French names to localities within the bounds of the\n\ncongregation. He was fond of calling the village of River Jean, Belle Vue,\n\nand much of his correspondence carried that heading. Louisville is another\n\nof the local names, which still survives. Belle Vue though significant and\n\neuphonious, did not seem to take, though an effort was made to obtain\n\nlegislative enactment in its favor.* No doubt, the fact that the great\n\nmajority of his congregation were of French descent, and that many of them\n\nconversed in that language influenced my father in his effort to leave a\n\npermanent French impress on the village and its vicinity.\n\n*[The majority of the French speaking repudiated French origin; the\n\nEnglish-speaking preferred an English name. The attempt of the compilers\n\nof the Atlas of Pictou County to change the name to the barbarism,\n\n\"Johnville\" was happily futile.]\n\nOf the home life at the manse, I shall say but little. The most scrupulous\n\ncare was taken in the moral and religious instruction of the children of\n\nthe household. Brown's \"Short Catechism\" for the younger ones, and the\n\n\"Shorter Catechism\" for the older were dispensed as regularly as our\n\nmorning meal. \"No question, no breakfast\" was the motto by which we were\n\nkept in line. I do not remember any occasion on which any of us lost our\n\nbreakfast, and I am not sure that we invariably had the question, but the\n\nrule was maintained, and probably its inflexibility ensured its observance.\n\nThe children were also encouraged to engage in some work to earn money for\n\nmissions, or to deprive themselves of some so-called luxury, in order to\n\nget pennies for the Lord's treasury. Missionary periodicals for the\n\nchildren were placed in our hands, doubtless in the hope that some\n\nimpression might be made which would be permanent and lead to the addition\n\nfrom the family to the roll of that noble band engaged in the foreign\n\nfield. The discipline of the home was rigid, but I have never heard one of\n\nthe family regret that our childhood was unduly taxed. My parents were\n\nfirm believers in the injunction, Train up a child in the way he should go,\n\nand when he is old, he will not depart from it.\"\n\nTwo of the daughters were virtually missionaries within my father's\n\nextensive parish on the eastern shore of Nova Scotia, where they taught\n\nschool for years in isolated, neglected districts, and where on Sabbath\n\nthey held religious services in the schoolhouse or in the homes of the\n\npeople. Another, after taking care of her mother in her last long illness,\n\nwent with a lady companion to do mission work among the blacks of North\n\nCarolina.\n\nIt is just fifty years within a few days, since my father preached his\n\nfarewell sermon in the old church. His text was \"Brethren, farewell\" and\n\nwas followed by a faithful and affectionate address.\n\nIn 1848 his health became so seriously impaired that he obtained leave of\n\nabsence to make a sea voyage and visit the old country. He sailed from the\n\nharbor in one of Mr. Kitchen's vessels, in which he had been offered a\n\npassage. The ship unexpectedly put in to Cork and my father eagerly\n\nembraced the opportunity to visit Father Matthew, the great apostle of\n\ntemperance. In after years he often alluded to the privilege he enjoyed in\n\nmaking the acquaintance of this truly great man. While in England and\n\nScotland he took advantage of every opportunity to solicit sympathy and\n\nsupport for the Theological Seminary at West River. He returned in one of\n\nMr. Carmichael's vessels under the command of Captain Geo. Mackenzie. A\n\nfellow passenger was Rev. David Honeyman, who then first came to this\n\ncountry. The latter was best known as a practical geologist and curator of\n\nthe Provincial museum. Smallpox broke out on board ship and the passengers\n\nwere detained at quarantine at the beaches of Pictou for some weeks.\n\nWilliam Lawson Grant, in his preface to his father's life quotes a friend\n\nas saying that a biography written by a son is only one degree less\n\ncontemptible than one written by a daughter. I feel confident that if you\n\nhave not reverence for my father's memory which I have, you will none the\n\nless appreciate this simple and unadorned narration of facts as forming a\n\nnot wholly uninteresting link in the history of Salem congregation, which\n\nyou have kindly permitted me to forge.\n\nII.\n\nSOME FURTHER NOTES\n\nA few facts may be added to what Mr. Waddell has said of his worthy father\n\nand the River of his time.\n\nRiver John was no longer the quiet farming district with a preponderating\n\nSwiss manner of thinking and living, as when Mr. Mitchell came. There were\n\nat least five stores where general merchandise was for sale. Four ship\n\nyards were busy. Squire MacLean built on the east side of the river;\n\nMockler on the west side, at the bridge; Kitchen and MacKenzie further\n\ndown. Here as elsewhere the general notion of the time was that the men\n\nwould work better if well supplied with rum. The lumbering camps were\n\ntreated on the same false business principle. Teetotalism was a perpetual\n\nstruggle for the teetotaler; he had to withstand the constant jeerings and\n\npleadings of his fellow workmen, besides the temptings of his own appetite.\n\nNo finer spirit was anywhere developed than under these circumstances.\n\nThe really effective work was not done by the leaders in the temperance\n\ncause: Mr. Waddell, John MacQuarrie, Geo. Patriquin (the blacksmith, who\n\nwas converted by Mr. Waddell`s ministration), James Lauder, E. Munro, Ch.\n\nSutherland, necessary though their work was, but by those who patiently and\n\nmanfully sustained in the strength of Christ His principles from hour to\n\nhour through years of temptation.\n\nTemperance at River John is as old as the settlement; and so is liquor\n\ndrinking. We do not know when the River John Temperance Society was\n\nformed. If it was not in existence when Mr. Waddell arrived it was quickly\n\nby him issued into being. In despite of watchfulness and earnest labor\n\ndrinking increased with the increase of the population. Early in 1847 the\n\nSociety found itself compelled to take special steps \"to wipe off the stain\n\nof drunkeness from our settlement.\" A respectful letter was addressed to\n\nthe magistrates (Messrs. Smith, MacLean, and Mackenzie) to do their duty; a\n\npetition signed by the better people of the community was sent to the Court\n\nof Sessions not to grant tavern license in the district for the petitioners\n\n\"are of the opinion that a house of entertainment conducted on temperance\n\nprinciples would be sufficient for the settlement;\" and a strong committee\n\nwas appointed \"to proceed on and act in accordance with the law in fining\n\nthose that sell without license, and to keep a watch over those that belong\n\nto the Society that break their pledge and to expel them from the Society\n\nif they do not confess their fault and promise amendment.\" These men were\n\nnot in temperance for fun, and the rum interests set seriously to oppose\n\nthem, dealingthe heaviest blows on the chief inspirer and director of a\n\npublic moral sentiment. At a meeting of the Society, 22 March 1847, at\n\nwhich the Town Hall \"was filled with a respectful company,\" his friends\n\npublicly defended him against some who \"thought that he went too far with\n\nmatters.\" As for himself, he said he knew not wherein he had gone too far\n\nand that his conscience accused him for letting matters go on too long.\n\nLater his opponents circulated false stories regarding him, to undermine\n\nhis influence, and those interested in the liquor business withheld their\n\npromised contributions for the support of gospel ordinances.\n\nThe Miil Vale Temperance Society existed for many years, and had a large\n\nmembership. Mr. Waddell attempted establishing a similar organization at\n\nthe Cape where he had regular prayer services in Joseph Gass`s house; but\n\nhe failed to obtain sufficient signatures. The Cape lacked then the unity\n\nand sobriety of Brookvale.\n\nThe reward came in seeing intemperance greatly decrease before the end of 1849.\n\nHis zeal for temperance and for education went hand in hand. In much of\n\nhis field schools had been opened under Mr. Mitchell`s supervision. At the\n\nvillage and at Marshville they are as old as these settlements. A Mr.\n\nTaylor taught in Lewis Tattrie`s old house in Louisville in 1833. David\n\nLangill (son of John David) taught four years at Forbesville and four at\n\nMarshville before he came (about 1840) to teach at the village. Peter De\n\nBrodeur, who used to write rhymes, taught school at Bigney. When Mr.\n\nWaddell came, Wm. Jack taught in the village on the west side, and David\n\nLangill on the east side.\n\nUnder Mr. Waddell`s fostering care these schools were strengthened and\n\nothers instituted. In the Fall of 1846, on his way to Mr. Kirk`s at the\n\nBackshore, he and his driver called at a house to warm themselves. The\n\ngood wife of the house, ignorant of or forgetting his sentiments, in\n\nsincere Scottish hospitality, produced a decanter half-full of whiskey to\n\ntreat them. Besides giving a few friendly hints against drinking and\n\ntreating, he urged them to open a day-school in some suitable place and\n\npromised he would do anything in his power to get them a teacher. He used\n\nto hold prayer service in Mr. Henry`s house at Hodson. On such an\n\noccasion, as he and a few of the neighbours, after service, sat at supper,\n\nthe plans were laid for a school in that district.\n\nWe have seen that our first Pastor was a Sabbath school worker almost as\n\nearly as Robert Raikes, and that what he had become apprenticed to in\n\nScotland he continued in Canada. He found one such school at the River\n\nwhen he came and established others in his wide field. At Marshville the\n\nschool was strong when David Langill (afterwards Elder) began to teach in\n\n1828. In Mr. Waddell`s time five Sabbath schools were conducted in the\n\nCongregation with an average attendance of 27 teachers and 180 scholars.\n\nThe Minister taught three (some years four) Bible-classes each week, with\n\nan average attendance of 58. An equal number of prayer-meetings with 39\n\npersons present on an average, were held weekly. The Congregation was\n\nreported as being 14 miles in length by 10 in breadth.\n\nRiver John in his time was supplied with roads, making pastoral work\n\neasier; yet how it taxed health and strength---such roads! such\n\nconveyances! In 1845 he left Truro at noon (at the close of Synod) and\n\narrived home at eleven at night---horse and carriage crept along at the\n\nrate of three miles an hour! James Lauder describes a trip on the third\n\nSabbath of August 1847: Went to Cape John Shore with Rev. J. Waddell. He\n\npreached in their meeting house from these words: Behold the Lamb of God\n\nthat taketh away the sins of the world; and in the afternoon: I seek not my\n\ninterest but yours. I cannot say that he was very lively. It being a very\n\nwet day there were but few in attendance. Coming home our carriage broke;\n\ngot dinner at Alexr. MacDonald's and came home. It was very wet and\n\nuncomfortable.\n\nTwo matters affected Mr. Waddell`s financial support: his brave and\n\nconstant advocacy of temperance, and the lack of a business system in\n\ncongregational affairs. Because of the first, a number of the wealthier\n\ncontributors withheld the part of the Lord`s treasury that fell into their\n\nhands. So crippled, by these and by a Board of Management that neglected\n\nto manage, did the finances of the house of God become, and so attached\n\nwere the people to their minister, that application for aid was made to the\n\nPresbytery. In July 1851 it was agreed that Mr. Waddell should continue\n\nover the congregation and give his labors in it in proportion to the amount\n\nof salary paid by it, The Presbytery to provide employment and remuneration\n\nduring the remainder of his time. Under this arrangement he spent five\n\nweeks in Cape Breton and five in Guysboro and Little Canso. His work in\n\nthese places was helpful to the Foreign Missions of the Church. In\n\nFebruary 1852 a Call was addressed to him from the Mabou congregation,\n\nwhich, after mature consideration, including consultation of his people, he\n\ndeclined.\n\nThe action of July 1851 was not satisfactory to either party, and hence we\n\nfind the Clerk of Presbytery writing of a new arrangement to the Board of\n\nDomestic Missions under date 31 Aug. 1852:-\n\n\"At the last meeting of the Presbytery of Pictou the state of the\n\ncongregation of River John was under consideration. The congregation\n\nearnestly petitioned to have Mr. Waddell continued over them, and in\n\ntestimony of their sincerity presented a subscription list which in the\n\nstate of the congregation the Presbytery considered very liberal. The\n\nnumber of the families connected with the congregation does not exceed\n\neighty, while of these there be at least the usual number of paupers and\n\nnon-payers, so that the actual burden falls on about forty families and\n\nthese are not in affluent circumstances, yet they have pledged themselves\n\nto pay the sum of ninety pounds {$360}, and have a subscription list from\n\nwhich it is anticipated that they will be able to realize that amount\n\nwithout difficulty. The Presbytery thought this very liberal for them and\n\non examining the subscription list found the individual amounts large.\n\nUnder these circumstances the Presbytery considered the congregation as\n\nhaving a just claim for aid upon the Mission fund and therefore agreed that\n\non its being certified that the congregation had paid up ninety pounds for\n\nthe year the Presbytery would apply to the Home Mission Board for the sum\n\nof ten pounds. I am instructed by the Presbytery to lay this relation\n\nbefore the Board and request their concurrence in the proposal.\"\n\nThis settlement was satisfactory and the congregation paid $360 per annum\n\nuntil the end of his pastorate. The average stipend for the whole time of\n\nhis ministry here was $314.84 a year, worth about $700 according to present\n\nvalues. From the congregation the main schemes of the Church received an\n\naverage annual contribution of $34.15, and other benevolent purposes\n\n$76.27. The givings of the later years were in advance of the earlier.\n\nThe circulation of the Bible received due attention. At a meeting in the\n\nchurch (1846), a committee of ten prominent citizens was appointed to visit\n\nthe various sections of the community in its interest. James Lauder and\n\nhenry Rogers visited the Cape, entered 62 homes, found only one home\n\nwithout a Bible, gave gratis two Bibles and three Testaments, and sold a\n\nfew. In nine months the River John Bible Society sold 100 Bibles and 200\n\ncopies of the New Testament.\n\nHis son rightly refers to Mr. Waddell's eminent service for missions. His\n\nheart was in the foreign work of the Church from its start; and others\n\naround him caught the infection of his zeal. Before Dr. Geddie went to\n\nAneityum he spent some time (1845-46) in arousing the Church at home to her\n\nduty in the matter. Early in the spring of 1846 a tea party was held in\n\nthe Freemason's Hall, Pictou, and some from the River were there. It was a\n\ngreat occasion; people felt the inspiration of having a hand in initiating\n\nsuch a noble work. After tea the gathering was addressed by Revs. David\n\nRoy, John Geddie, James Waddell, James Ross, J. MacKinlay, and Messrs. J.\n\nW. Dawson, A. Patterson, and Fogo. Sixteen pounds ($64) were taken in aid\n\nof the mission. The Missionary Register for 1853 gives an account of the\n\ninstitution at River John of a Juvenile Bible Jubilee and Benevolent\n\nSociety. Among the gifts to missions acknowledged about this time, our eye\n\ncaught the following from the River:-\n\nPrint dress and thread, Mrs. J. MacQuarrie.\n\n5-1/2 yards home spun, Mrs. George Tattrie.\n\n2 Pounds, Mrs. Andrew Lauder.\n\n1 Pound, Andrew Lauder.\n\nHis son makes no reference to Mr. Waddell's generosity; in his giving he\n\ndid not inform his right hand of his left hand's doings. Had one gone to\n\nthe homes of the poor, many testimonies would be heard. In a year of great\n\nscarcity of grain, he sent Joseph Gass to Prince Edward Island for a boat\n\nload of oats, which he sold to those who had not money to buy seed grain.\n\nElder George Langill was of the same spirit, often refusing in time of\n\nscarcity to sell hay or grain to such as had ready cash, saying they could\n\nbuy where the moneyless would be refused. When one looked at Mr. Waddell's\n\nmarvelously gentle face one knew why the children and the poor loved him;\n\nhis hand and his heart were as kind as his face.\n\nTHE REV. HECTOR BRUCE MACKAY\n\nI.\n\nAn Address\n\nBy the Rev. H. B. MacKay, delivered at the\n\nCentennial Celebration.\n\nWe are met today to celebrate the close of the first century of the history\n\nof the Presbyterian Church of River John. Our narrative has to do with\n\ncertain persons and events in connection with the congregation. Many of\n\nthese events must be of interest to this generation. A century is a long\n\ntime. It includes four generations. and each generation is making its own\n\nhistory and building its own character.\n\nThis centennial record divides itself into four pastorates, each one of\n\nwhich has its own peculiar interest. My remarks are intended to deal with\n\nthe third of these.\n\nI was settled in River John in June 1861. I found it to be a village of\n\nmoderate size, built on the river of the same name, and representing the\n\nvarious mercantile and mechanical industries generally found in such\n\nplaces. The congregation included the largest part of the population of\n\nthe village, and almost all the outlying stations. The church was an old\n\nbuilding built in the old style, being two stories in height, with a small\n\ncupola on the middle of the roof. It was seated in the old fashion, with\n\nhigh backed pews, and a gallery around the three sides, with its canonical\n\nhigh pulpit adorned with its ancient sounding board. Our worthy fathers\n\nand mothers worshipped in these sanctuaries with evident enjoyment and\n\nprofit, not thinking so much about their own comfort as they did about the\n\ninward happiness produced by the word.\n\nThe first work which the congregation undertook under the new pastorate was\n\nto secure a manse for the minister. The former ministers lived in their\n\nown houses. Manses were not so common then as they are now, and often\n\nministers were put to great inconvenience for the want of a place to live\n\nin. The congregation wanted to remedy this defect by providing a manse,\n\nand they did so by purchasing Rev. Mr. Waddell's house. In making this\n\npurchase they went about it like honest business men. They first\n\nconsidered what the property was worth, what was its full value between man\n\nand man. They offered Mr. Waddell this sum which he accepted, feeling that\n\nhe had lost nothing by the bargain.\n\nAfter worshipping seven years in the old church the people began to talk\n\nabout building a new church. It was felt that a work so great required\n\nsome preparation; funds must be provided. A few tea meetings were made and\n\nthe money thus collected formed the nucleus of a building fund. At a\n\ncongregational meeting it was decided to arise and build. Five leading\n\nmen: George Tattrie, James Langill, Charles MacLennan, Adams Archibald, and\n\nDuncan Weir, were elected a building committee, with instructions to carry\n\nthe work on as expeditiously as possible. They were practical business\n\nmen, well qualified for the work. The work was given out in two contracts:\n\nGeorge Mitchell finished the outside and George Munro the inside. The work\n\nwas well done, which the building itself can testify after the tear and\n\nwear of thirty eight years. The time of building was very opportune.\n\nLabor and material were then much cheaper than they are now. All agreed\n\nthat the church was very economically built, at an expenditure of $4400,\n\nincluding the bell and furnaces. The Session agreed that the name of the\n\nchurch should be \"Salem Church,\" and that the painter be directed to paint\n\nthe name \"Salem\" on the front of the church: and so the name was\n\nconfirmed.\n\nThe next consideration was what was to be done with the old church. One\n\nopinion prevailed as to that. It was moved a few feet from its original\n\nfoundation and turned into a hall for the Sabbath school and prayer\n\nmeetings. And well has it served its purpose, for there the lambs of the\n\nflock were fed with the sincere milk of the word by faithful and\n\nintelligent teachers. Thomas B. Gould was a life long teacher in the\n\nSabbath school and he was ably assisted in the work by two brethren who\n\nare now in the eldership; I refer to James Perrin and Archibald MacKenzie.\n\nThese brethren have long served their generation, and obtained for\n\nthemselves an honored name.\n\nThe order of service observed in the church in those days differed from\n\nwhat it is now. Then we had two sermons consecutively, with an\n\nintermission of twenty minutes. The village people were anxious to have\n\nthis order changed to morning and evening services while the country people\n\nwished them to remain as they were. The advocates of the change felt that\n\nthe removal into the new church would be a favorable opportunity for the\n\nchange. By wise and timely measures the change was effected, and an old\n\npractice long enjoyed by the people was set aside.\n\nImprovements in church accommodation are always followed by increased\n\nattendance. A new church always draws new hearers and we were no exception\n\nto the rule. I must here say that the River John congregation was always a\n\nchurch-going congregation. In good weather the church would be fairly\n\nfilled, and that was the rule and not the exception. All religious\n\nservices were fairly respected. The prayer meeting was not forgotten, we\n\ndid not forsake the assembling of ourselves together. We held two prayer\n\nmeetings every week, on Wednesday night in the hall in the village and on\n\nThursday night in some outlying section. In each of these places we had\n\npersons who could take part in the exercises. Along with these services we\n\nhad pastoral visitation from house to house in which the Shorter Catechism\n\nwas freely used. This was the order of instruction in those days under\n\nwhich the men and the women of the present day grew up. These agencies of\n\nthe Presbyterian Church when faithfully applied never fail in producing the\n\nhighest type of men and women.\n\nWe will now for a little speak of the eldership of the congregation. This\n\nis an order peculiar to the Presbyterian Church. The men are chosen by the\n\npeople and ordained to the office, and their continuance in office is for\n\nlife, or during good behaviour. The duties of the elders are to examine\n\nand admit applicants to the membership of the Church and to take a general\n\nsuperintendence of the whole congregation.\n\nAt the beginning of my pastorate we had five elders: John George Langill,\n\nEphraim Langill, David Langill, George Tattrie and James Lauder. John\n\nGeorge had retired from the active duties of the eldership through age and\n\ninfirmity. He died about the close of 1863 and his mantle more than fell\n\non his son Ephraim. While our elders as a class are good and excellent\n\nmen, yet each has his own peculiar gift. Ephraim was a man of natural\n\nrefinement. He was one of nature's noblemen. He revelled in the\n\nliterature of the Bible, and chose from among its sacred texts the most\n\nbeautiful and poetic passages and interwove them into his prayers. No one\n\ncould listen to these prayers without feeling that such a man was mighty in\n\nthe Scriptures. David Langill was doctrinal in his turn of mind. He could\n\npresent a whole system of theology in his prayers in the strong and pure\n\nlanguage of the Bible. David was in many respects a very worthy elder.\n\nGeorge Tattrie was a man above the average, and might be put in the class\n\nof whom the apostle Paul speaks when he says, \"Let the elders that rule\n\nwell be counted worthy of double honor.\" He was a man of clear judgment\n\nand of good comon sense, such a man as you would wish to have with you when\n\nyou were going to settle a hard case. Such men are a source of strength to\n\nany Session and a great comfort to a minister. I regard our elders as a\n\nstrong factor in our Presbyterian Polity.\n\nJames Lauder was a Scotsman and had much of the Scottish character. He\n\nprided himself on being the companion of Hugh Miller, the distinguished\n\nJournalist and Scottish Geologist. He was well versed in the folklore of\n\nhis native country and could tell a Scottish story with great interest. He\n\nhad the rare faculty of giving a religious turn to the conversaton in hand\n\nand drawing from the subject good religious lessons. These elders were\n\ngood christian men, having many qualifites that fitted them for their\n\noffice. They served their generation and have gone to their reward; they\n\nrest from their labours and their works do follow them.\n\nAfter a few years of quiet progressive work it was deemed necessary to have\n\na new election of elders, to give increased strength to the Session, and\n\nJohn MacQuarrie, William Redmond, George Langill and John Sutherland were\n\nchosen. These men carry their own recommendation on their face. They were\n\nmen well spoken of from without, and sought to advance not only the\n\ninterests of the Church but the interests of true religion. I must make a\n\nremark here about George Langill which I think is deserved. He lived\n\nfurther from the church than any of the others; he had seven miles to\n\ntravel, and during his younger years he and his wife walked that distance\n\nalmost every Sabbath. In later years he was able to take his own carriage\n\nand drive there, and no man was more regular in his attendance than\n\nMountain George. I often thought that the example of that good man would\n\nbe a swift witness against those careless ones along that road who\n\nneglected the sanctuary.\n\nIn the winter of 1875 our congregation was blessed with a gracious\n\noutpouring of the Spirit of God. There had been much sowing of the word,\n\nmuch attention given to the externals of religion, the gospel was preached\n\nand heard as a matter of course, but there seemed to be little spiritual\n\nlife. In God's time he arose in his might and breathed upon the dry bones\n\nand they became a spiritual power. How did this work begin? When did it\n\nbegin? We must say we cannot tell, but we find an answer in the words of\n\nthe Saviour: \"The wind bloweth where it listeth and thou hearest the sound\n\nthereof but canst not tell whence it cometh or whither it goeth; so is\n\nevery one that is born of the the Spirit.\" Coming events were casting\n\ntheir shadows before. There seemed to be a strong desire for the means of\n\ngrace, a greater earnestness in the discharge of the duties of religion.\n\nIt was found afterwards that the same feeling was experienced by the Kirk\n\ncongregation. I sent for the Rev. A. Sterling and he was with us for a few\n\nnights, but we neither saw nor felt anything special. The same feeling led\n\nMr. MacCunn to send for Rev. J. Fraser Campbell who was at that time\n\nholding meetings in Pictou. On his arrival he proposed a more systematic\n\narrangement of the work. Meetings were held in the three churches, Salem,\n\nSt. George's, and the Methodist, but the evening meeting was held always in\n\nSalem, because it was the largest. Mr. Campbell proved himself to be an\n\nexcellent worker. He had both the tact and the talent that fitted him for\n\nthe work. The largest part of the preaching fell upon him and the common\n\npeople heard him gladly. The church was packed to the door every night\n\nwith an attentive an anxious audience. At the close of every diet of\n\npreaching we had an after meeting, and sometimes as many as two hundred\n\nwould remain. The most of these were spoken to and encouraged and helped\n\non their way. These after meetings often continued till midnight. The\n\nreport of our meetings induced several of our brethren to visit us and take\n\npart in the work. Rev. G. M. Grant from Halifax was with us several nights\n\nand took an active share of the service, and so did Dr. Sedgwick and others\n\nwhom I might mention. These meetings continued without any apparent\n\nabatement for seventeen nights. They were followed by a precious time of\n\ningathering. After careful dealing with each catechumen we received 87 new\n\ncommunicants into the fellowship of the Church. Here we would pause and\n\nsay, \"The Lord hath done great things for us whereof we are glad.\" I do\n\nnot know how many the other churches admitted, but they must have gathered\n\nin a proportionally large number.\n\nWe shall now select one or two cases who distinguished themselves in the\n\nLord's work. Prominent among these is Paul F. Langill. He was destined to\n\nbecome a leader among men. He was strong and active in body, vigorous in\n\nmind, not easily discouraged. The Lord made choice of him at an early\n\nstage of the work to become a laborer in his vineyard. It was among Paul's\n\nfirst impulses to devote himself to the gospel ministry. He knew that\n\nintellectual preparation was necessary, and he saw many difficulties in his\n\nway, but was determined, by the help of the Spirit, to overcome them all.\n\nHe turned aside from the plow, entered the classroom and began to put on\n\nthe armor. He attended Pictou Academy for two or three terms, and then\n\nDalhousie University, where he graduated Bachelor of Arts. He took his\n\ntheological course at Princeton, that famous seat of orthodoxy, and began\n\nhis life work on the prairies of the North West. Here he met with all\n\nsorts of characters but he was ready for them all. He could ride a bronco\n\nas well as the best of them, and he could lift the strongest of them at a\n\ntug of war. Having thus gained their confidence by taking part in their\n\nown sports, he was able to gather them around him to hear a good gospel\n\nsermon. Superintendent Robertson has been heard to say more than once, \" I\n\nwish I had a score of missionaries like Langill.\" I have been told that\n\nRalph Connor has Paul as a character in one of his books. He is such a\n\ncharacter as Connor would like to describe. Having given five years to the\n\nNorth West Mission, he came East and readily found a congregation in the\n\nEastern Townships of Ontario. In parting with our dear friend, we pray\n\nthat his bow may long abide in strength and that his arms may be made\n\nstrong by the mighty God of Jacob.\n\nWe look around us to-night on this large gathering and how few of the old\n\nfaces do we see! Their homesteads are among us, but the inmates are gone.\n\nThe home of our pioneer minister is with us but his large family have gone\n\nthe way of all the earth. Thomas, one of his sons spent his days on the\n\nold homestead, and proved himself to be an excellent, systematic farmer.\n\nHe lived a blameless life as a citizen, and a consistent member of the\n\nchurch of his fathers. And last but not least we mention the name of\n\nAlexander MacKenzie, whose life was identified with River John. He began\n\nlife as a merchant when comparatively young. As trade advanced he branched\n\nout into ship-building. He had the qualities of a good business man, was\n\ncautious yet persevering, could read the signs of the times, so that when\n\nhe saw a crisis coming he was able to confine his business within those\n\ncommercial limits that avoid disaster. He was a wise counsellor, a true\n\nfriend, and a generous friend of the congregation. His house was an open\n\nhouse for all our ministers. Among the many virtues that adorned his\n\ncharacter none shone so brightly as when he entertained his friends around\n\nhis own hospitable table.\n\n\"The fathers, where are they, and do the prophets live forever?\" Time\n\nwould fail me to speak of the many men and women who have here nobly\n\nperformed their part in their day. They did for us what we should do for th\n\ne coming generation. They received a heritage from their fathers, which\n\nthey have transmitted to us, the benefits of which we enjoy. Let us in our\n\nday transmit the same heritage to our children. In this is the saying\n\nverified, \"One soweth and another reapeth. Other men labored and ye are\n\nentered into their labors.\" In our labors let it be our highest ambition\n\nto transmit to our children the precious legacy of a PURE, SCRIPTURAL,\n\nPRESBYTERIAN CHURCH.\n\nII.\n\nTHE THIRD PASTOR\n\nNone could so well describe the men and events of his pastorate as he who\n\nwatched them all with the most intelligent eye, and we appreciate the\n\nservice he has rendered in casting light on the River of his day; but he\n\nhas said little of the one we are most interested in: himself. In the\n\nfollowing sketch use has been made of press notices at the time of his\n\njubilee.\n\nThe Rev. Hector Bruce MacKay was born in 1825 in Caithnesshire, Scotland.\n\nHis father was a sturdy veteran who had fought for king and country when\n\nBritain was at war with France. When peace was restored he returned to a\n\nHighland farm, determining however to seek for his family, if not for\n\nhimself, the better opportunities of Nova Scotia. Before leaving Scotland\n\nhe gave his children a good education and some of them became teachers of\n\nnote in eastern parts of the Province\n\nAfter a preparatory course at Truro Academy Mr. H. B. MacKay entered the\n\nFree Church College, Halifax and enjoyed the social, intellectual and\n\nspiritual influences of Drs. King, Lyall and MacKenzie. Leaving College in\n\n1854 he was licensed by the Presbytery of Halifax to preach the gospel, and\n\nproceed to Chipman, New Brunswick, to exercise his gifts in the cause of\n\nreligion. On 22nd June 1855 he was solemnly ordained to the gospel\n\nministry and inducted into the pastoral charge of Chipman, a scattered,\n\nremote and arduous field, just the arena to call forth the best efforts of\n\na zealous and devoted young man.\n\nCompleting seven years of faithful and successful work in New Brunswick, he\n\ncame to River John with a good store of ministerial experience. He was\n\naccounted a good preacher and, improving as the years passed by, he was\n\nable to keep the interest and attention of this intelligent country\n\ncongregation for 24 years. The church was well filled on Sabbath because\n\nthe people found spiritual food there that sustained them throughout the\n\nweek of joys and sorrows and temptations, of successes and disappointments.\n\nIn 1860 the Presbyterian Church of Nova Scotia (to which Salem congregation\n\nbelonged) and the Free Church of Nova Scotia were united to form the\n\nPresbyterian Church of the Lower Provinces of British North America. At\n\nHalifax, 1 July 1861, by authority of the Synod at the request of the\n\nPresbytery of Tatamagouche was formed, having the following congregations\n\nand ministers; New Annan, Rev. James Watson; Wallace, Rev. John Munro;\n\nGoose River, Rev. W. S. Durragh; River John, Rev. H. B. Mackay;\n\nTatamagouche, Rev. Thos. Sedgwick. James Lauder was the only elder present\n\nat the formation of the Presbytery.\n\nA Call from Wallace removed Mr. MacKay thither, Sept. 1885. The work there\n\nreceived the full benefit of his ripe experience as pastor and teacher.\n\nHis wife, a daughter of John James Archibald of Truro, was called to her\n\neternal home on the 13th Sept. 1901, being 73 years of age. Mrs. MacKay\n\nwas a woman of sterling good sense, sound judgment and marked intelligence.\n\nShe took an active and real interest in religious, benevolent and\n\nmissionary work. To her husband she was a true helper in work and joy and\n\nsorrow. Of her ten children only three survived her; trials that would\n\nbreak many a life, strengthened, developed and beautified hers, so firm was\n\nher faith in our Master as Ruler of all and the Dispenser of joys and\n\nsorrows for the discipline of His children.\n\nIn all his charges, wherever his lot was cast, he was a cheerful and\n\nzealous laborer for the Master of the vineyard, and when, in his judgment,\n\nthe time came for retiring, he tendered his resignation and retired form\n\nthe duties of the pastorate, Oct. 1896. Since retiring he has done much\n\nuseful work, both in preaching and Bible-class teaching.\n\nWhen he had completed fifty years of ministerial service, his jubilee was\n\ncelebrated at Wallace, 22 June 1905. His friends of River John and Wallace\n\nand the minsters of the Presbytery presented a purse of money, and many\n\ntestimonies, neither the first nor the last, were borne to the graciousness\n\nand usefulness of his long, laborious and efficient service in the\n\ncongregations of Christ's people to which he was called to minster.\n\nTHE FOURTH PASTORATE\n\n\"When I saw that curly head go into the pulpit I knew that was the minister\n\nfor us, \" said Mrs. Lauder; she never saw that head before except in a\n\ndream. The rest of the congregation came to the same conclusion although\n\nby a different method. So I was heartily called and duely inducted into\n\nthe pastoral charge of River John, Oct. 1886. That night Elder John\n\nMacLean had a vision: An august and glorious Personage, whom he knew and\n\nloved, said to him, \"As you all deal with this minister so shall I deal\n\nwith you in Judgment.\" Not that he needed the warning; he was ever a\n\nminister's friend; none was truer to me than John MacLean. Special\n\nservices had been held in Salem Church in the Spring of 1886 by Messrs.\n\nMeikle and Gerrior, and I had the unspeakable pleasure of gathering in the\n\nconverts. There was a brisk spiritual life in the congregation that made\n\nmy work a splendid pleasure. Coming in these circumstances no wonder I\n\nloved the place, the people and the work.\n\nThe Rev. Messrs MacCunn and Swallow united with me in a series of\n\nevangelistic services. The attendance was large and the most encouraging\n\nmanifestations of Divine blessing were not wanting. We believe that many\n\nsouls were converted by the Spirit of God and many saints had their\n\nspiritual life brightened and deepened. Seventy persons were received into\n\nthe communion of the Church on profession of faith. Much of the success of\n\nthese services arose from the labors of William Douglas, who afterwards\n\nentered the ministry and did efficient service therein. He had a sweet\n\nvoice, a pleasing manner, a kind heart, a ready wit, a humble mind and a\n\nthorough consecration to his Saviour. His appeals you recognized as coming\n\nfrom a heart filled with intense desire for the salvation of sinners and\n\nthe truly Christlike character in the lives of the saints.\n\nThere followed one monthly and six weekly prayermeetings in the\n\ncongregation, which brought me into frequent fellowship with all the\n\npeople--of course, I could not attend each meeting. Their memory is very\n\nsweet. From five to nine of us would lead in prayer. The praise was\n\nespecially hearty. Many of the aged and of the young who took active part\n\nin these meetings have joined the choir of the invisible in the glory that\n\nexcelleth: Lewis Langill, the brothers John M. David Langill, among the\n\nolder; and Howard Rogers and 'Little Abram' C. Langill, among the younger.\n\nEvangelistic services were held frequently; four series in Middleton, and\n\none a Brule and at Hodson. Bright with perennial gratitude should we keep\n\nthe memory of those seasons of the special manifestation of the presence\n\nwith us of the Holy Spirit. Mention should be made of the series conducted\n\nby Mr. J. Logan Gordon in St. George's, and Mr. J. W. Britton and by\n\nmembers of Preesbytery (Revs. David Wright, F. L. Jobb, and Robert Murray)\n\nin Salem.\n\nSabbath services were held at Middleton, Hodson and (three or four times a\n\nyear) at M'Bain's Corner, besides in Salem Church. Later finding I had one\n\nSabbath evening a month free, it was given to Brule, where the attendance\n\nwas so large as to encourage the people to build a church; which being\n\nfinished, I gave fortnightly evening servies.\n\nThe new church at Hodson was opened in 1894. How much its erection owed to\n\nthe untiring efforts of William Henry, Esqr., I need not here relate,\n\nexcept to say that without his consecrated patience and energy the building\n\nwould not be there.\n\nBible Class was taught in Salem Hall on Friday evenings from 1886 for many y\n\nears; later on Wednesday after prayermeeting. It was resumed and taught by\n\nJames Perrin (1902 to 1906) and Archibald MacKenzie (1907 to 1909). For\n\nsome years I had classes in Higher Religious Instruction in Salem Hall and\n\nMarshville Schoolhouse, and a number of the pupils acquitted themselves\n\nwell in the General Assembly's examinations. I spent a happy seven months,\n\nlater, in teaching four Bible classes in the outlying sections, taking two\n\na week.\n\nThe Salem Guild was organized in 1886 to give further field to the social\n\nand religious energies of the young people. Its members procured many\n\nsignatures to the temperance pledge, encouraged the circulation of the\n\nPresbyterian Record, provided a free loan library for the Sabbath schools\n\nof the congregation and purchased an organ for the hall (which later,\n\nwithout any opposition, was removed to the church.) It had also a lecture\n\ncourse in which, among others, the Rev. Robt. MacCunn gave an address on\n\nthe Hymn Writers of the Church. Later the Guild merged into a Young\n\nPeople's Society of Christian Endeavor, which for many years proved an aid\n\nin the spiritual life. The change, although followed by good results, was\n\nperhaps a mistake; some of us felt, when it was too late, that the Guild\n\nconstitution was better adapted to a small community where already a\n\nprayermeeting existed, than that of the C.E.\n\nIn reply to special invitiations from Middleton, Brule and West Branch,\n\nC.E. societies were organized at these places.\n\nJunior Societies of Christian Endeavor were instituted in Salem Hall (July\n\n1893, which did good work for nine years), at Louisville and at Denmark.\n\nAlthough they have not continued, no one can deny that in their day they\n\nhelped the children of the Church to know its life and doctrine. Had they\n\nbeen monthly meetings their life might have been longer.\n\nSabbath school work has had its rises and falls in the years of my\n\nministry. Its best season was in the second period of ten years, when in\n\nthe schools of the congregation on an average 28 workers and 256 pupils\n\nattended annually. Here credit is due to those faithful superintendents\n\nand teachers who worked along regardless of man's encouragement or the\n\nopposite. What is needed in the Sabbath school teacher, as in every\n\nfollower of our Lord Christ, is a persistent recognition of the Master's\n\neye and an ignoring of human discouragements.\n\nAmong those who rendered long and efficient service in our Sabbath schools,\n\nbesides our elders, none takes a higher place than Joseph Stevenson,\n\nteacher and superintendent in the Middleton union school for a long time.\n\nHis patience, simplicity and evident sincerity render him popular with the\n\nchildren as well as with older people, and the community took occasion to\n\ntell him so in an afternoon gathering at his home, 22 Sept 1905.\n\nThe River John Auxiliary of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society was\n\norganized, 13 July 1887, by Mrs. R.F. Burns and Miss Fairbanks of Halifax.\n\nIn its first year it had thirty members; next year increased to forty. Not\n\nonly has it contributed money and clothing for missions, but the sense of\n\nthe spiritual destitution of the heathen has been kept alive by its\n\nreadings and discussions.\n\nHow many of our co-workers here have lifted their voices in heaven to thank\n\nGod He gave them to do something for the dissemination of His truth among\n\nthe heathen. Of the original thirty one-third and many who joined later\n\nhave entered eternal bliss. Looking over the yearly lists I wish I could\n\nmention each of these our sainted dead, these dear true ones who by word\n\nand disposition helped us so much in life's journey. The Reid girls,\n\nMartha and Alice, who when they married left this congregation but never\n\nlost their loyalty to it; Mrs. John Maclean and Mrs. Lauder, worthy wives\n\nof princes in Israel, each so like her own husband, each in her own way so\n\ndeeply pious; Mrs. John Gass, another elder's worthy wife; Mrs. Charles\n\nMacLennan, Mrs. Lachlan Johnson, Mrs. John Tattrie, Mrs. D. Langill\n\n(teacher), Mrs. T.B. Gould, Mrs. T. Mitchell, and many others; all of whom g\n\nave us cause to thank God that they were given to us.\n\nThe Welsford Auxiliary was organized by Mrs. Gordon, 2 Sept 1890, with a\n\nmembership of eight ladies, which increased to eleven. Each year it has\n\nmade a box of garments and contributed a sum of money to the parent\n\nsociety. It has had capable and saintly members, some of whom have joined\n\nthe majority on the Other Shore, and others are waiting on the river bank\n\nfor the Master's call to cross over. Mrs. Abram Langill, worthy sister of\n\nthe intensely religious elder James Lauder, had a robust Christianity that\n\nfeared no foe and yielded to no discouragement. Mrs. John H. Cameron, so\n\nloyal to her Redeemer and this congregation, was called home in the midst\n\nof her strength and usefulness. The members would also wish to acknowledge\n\nthe helpful and unselfish services of Mrs. Isaac Langill, Mrs. J. R.\n\nSutherland, Mrs. A. J. MacKay, Mrs. David Anderson, Mrs. J. A. Douglas, and\n\nothers, who are no longer able to meet with them.\n\nA Mission Band was begun, Oct. 1893, by Mrs J. R. Collie (an able leader\n\nwho "
