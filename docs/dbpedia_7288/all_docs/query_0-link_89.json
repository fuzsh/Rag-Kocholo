Published on Wednesday.\n\nNOTE: Because I have had some computer problems and have had to retype 1.5 years I am going to use abbreviations through to 1930; e.g. S for South; E for East As in East Dalhousie and where reasonable marriage names and death names may be in bold in one entry and not typed again as in previous listings; it was this or stop.
