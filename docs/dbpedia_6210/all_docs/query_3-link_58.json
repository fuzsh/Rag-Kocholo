        "text": "The average cost of higher education has more than doubled in the 21st century, with an annual growth rate of 2% over the past 10 years. A first-time, full-time undergraduate student will need an average of $36,436/year for tuition, books, supplies, and daily living expenses to pursue a 4-year degree at a postsecondary institution in the United States. Considering student loan interest and loss of income, the ultimate cost of a bachelor’s degree can exceed $500,000.\n\nAs costs continue to rise, enrollment continues to decline—an additional 4.2% from just over a year ago. In addition, over the last six years, college completion rates have plateaued. More than 36 million Americans have some education beyond high school but have not completed their studies and are no longer enrolled in a postsecondary program. It’s also important to note that persistence and completion rates are not equal among student types. Data shows inequities for students of color and adult students.\n\nWhile there are many factors that influence a student’s ability to apply to and remain in college, cost is a significant one. The Cape Cod Foundation offers more than 100 different scholarships and is currently providing nearly $1 million in financial assistance annually for local students pursuing different educational pathways (two or four-year degrees, technical school, certificate programs) at different stages of their lives–from graduating high school seniors to adults entering/returning to college.\n\nIn 2024, we awarded a total of $35,000 in scholarships to seven students from The Cape Cod Foundation Scholarship Fund. To put things into perspective, in 2024, we received 489 completed applications to this fund. The gap in need and available resources is profound.\n\nApproximately 25% of Cape Cod Foundation scholarship applicants are first generation college students. We continue to work individually and collectively with community partners to decrease barriers and support students through the application process.\n\nThere is also a need for wrap-around support outside of scholarship dollars. As part of our 35th Anniversary Celebration, we created a “Postsecondary Success Series” for local students (see below).\n\nFUND NAME\n\nThe Cape Cod Foundation Scholarship Fund\n\nFUND DESCRIPTION\n\nTo support graduating high school seniors, current college students, or returning adult students from Cape Cod who display perseverance and a strong work ethic.\n\nDATE OF INCEPTION\n\n2002\n\nFUND TYPE\n\nPermanent Endowment. Follows spending policy set and approved annually by Foundation’s Board Of Directors\n\nCURRENT BALANCE\n\n$132,608\n\nTOTAL GRANTMAKING FROM FUND\n\n$183,261\n\n5-YEAR LOOKBACK/ALL FUNDS\n\n$3,056,234. Total grantmaking from all Foundations Scholarship Funds from 2019-2023. View the scholarship recipients here.\n\nFUND BACKGROUND\n\nThe Cape Cod Foundation Scholarship Fund, like many discretionary funds, was established with a bequest from a donor who wanted to provide resources for Cape Cod residents to pursue their educational endeavors. The initial gift was $34,149, which enabled us to award at least $1,000 annually to students through 2016. Then, in 2017, we received gifts from two private foundations totaling $15,500 which boosted the amount we had to award each year. Since then, with continual support from private foundations, individual donors, and businesses, we have been able to increase the annual number of awards and award amounts. In 2023 alone, we awarded $21,000 in scholarships."
