        "text": "HARTFORD, July 23 (AP) — The Hartford Financial Services Group paid $115 million to settle accusations that it allowed illegal trading in some mutual funds, the company and the Connecticut attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, announced on Monday.\n\nMr. Blumenthal said the Hartford had paid so-called contingent commissions to insurance brokers and agents, accusing it of steering business in exchange for secret commissions.\n\nThe company said the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission had concluded its investigation into accusations of market timing — the rapid and frequent trading in mutual funds that can benefit some investors at the expense of others — and that it would recommend against any action.\n\nA spokesman for the commission would not comment.\n\nThe Hartford took a charge of $66 million, or 22 cents a share, in 2005 to establish a reserve for federal and state investigations related to market timing.\n\nMr. Blumenthal said the company “failed to act swiftly and strongly to stop and disclose market timing despite its duty to do so.”\n\nThe chairman and chief executive of the Hartford, Ramani Ayer, said the company was pleased to put the matter behind it.\n\nThe company will establish a $5 million fund for policyholders who were harmed by improper insurance practices and pay $3 million each to Connecticut and Illinois and $20 million to New York.\n\nIt also will establish an $84 million fund to compensate market timing investor victims. The company did not admit or deny any violation of federal or state laws as a result of the settlement.\n\nBut the company said the authorities found that some employees of the Hartford engaged in “improper underwriting” by providing quotes for commercial insurance that were not based on an adequate assessment of the risk."
