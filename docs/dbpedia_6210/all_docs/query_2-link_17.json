        "text": "Ramani Ayer\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nHartford Financial Services Group Inc.\n\nHartford, Conn.\n\nHIS ROLE: Hartford Financial Services Group Inc. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Ramani Ayer, who has held the post since 1997, is overseeing a tumultuous time at the insurer. In October, Hartford announced it had received a $2.5 billion capital infusion from Munich, Germany-based Allianz S.E. Subsequently, it reported a $2.63 billion loss for the third quarter that reflected $2.2 billion in investment losses, most of which related to Hartford's investments in other financial services companies negatively affected by the market turmoil. In November, Hartford bought a Florida savings and loan for about $10 million to qualify for up to $3.4 billion in federal bailout funds.\n\nWHAT'S AHEAD: The purchase of the Florida thrift makes Hartford eligible to participate in the Treasury Department's $250 billion Capital Purchase Program, a strategy also used by other life insurers. But some question whether life insurers will be able to convince Treasury that such an infusion will benefit the public at large.\n\nWHAT TO WATCH: Given the considerable competition for government funds from Capital Purchase Program, it is still unclear whether Mr. Ayer will get a cash infusion from the Treasury Department."
