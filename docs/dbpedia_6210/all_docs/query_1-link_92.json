        "text": "***Please do NOT donate funds!***\n\nA Plea to Cape Cod Healthcare’s Board of Trustees, Senior Leadership & Massachusetts Politicians:\n\nBRING BACK VITAL SERVICES FOR WOMEN ON CAPE COD\n\nCape Cod Healthcare CEO Michael Lauf has launched a clear attack on vital services benefiting women on Cape Cod. Following the closure of the Falmouth Hospital Maternity and Pediatric wards, he announced further cuts and restricted access to midwives at the only remaining birthplace on Cape at Cape Cod Hospital.\n\nThese cuts effectively increase the likelihood of more profitable and life threatening c-sections and complications for mothers and babies during delivery. It has further decivilized our medical system, reversing decades of progress achieved by the doctors, nurses and midwives truly dedicated to improving health outcomes for women and children on Cape Cod.\n\nI am calling on Cape Cod Healthcare’s Board of Trustees & Senior Leaders to restore community confidence in the hospitals by announcing a commitment to bring these vital services back when the pandemic subsides and hospital operations return to normal. I am also urging our local politicians to negotiate with Cape Cod Healthcare until an announcement is made laying out a plan to bring the Falmouth Hospital Birth Center back and maintain sufficient staff at both hospital birth centers to ensure the best possible health outcomes for patients.\n\n\"The Falmouth closure, and now these pending cuts to the midwifery practice at Cape Cod Hospital, follow the recent elimination of maternity services at Morton Hospital in Taunton and Tobey Hospital in Wareham. As a result, the March of Dimes has classified this region of the state as a “maternity desert” for the lack of access to adequate obstetrical care.\"\n\nhttps://www.massnurses.org/news-and-events/p/openItem/11854\n\nCape Cod Healthcare Officers:\n\nBruce Johnston, Chairman of the Board\n\nMichael K. Lauf, President & CEO\n\nRamani Ayer, Vice Chairman & Treasurer\n\nRobert “Bert” Talerman, Clerk\n\nTrustees:\n\nTheodore Calianos, M.D., Lawrence Capodilupo, Diane Coletti, Cynthia Hines, M.D., Sharon Kennedy, E.
