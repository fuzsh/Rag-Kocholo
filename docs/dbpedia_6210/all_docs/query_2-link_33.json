        "text": "The Hartford Financial Services Group said Thursday that its chief executive, Ramani Ayer, 62, would retire by the end of the year. The insurer has been under pressure from shareholders as it struggles with record losses, and is expected to receive $3.4 billion in taxpayer funds.\n\nHartford said in a statement that it was looking outside the company for a successor.\n\nShareholders questioned Mr. Ayer’s leadership after Hartford reported billions of dollars in losses over the last three quarters, leading the company to cut major international operations and reduce its dividend by 84 percent.\n\nThe announcement is the latest in a string of senior management changes at Hartford since last year. David M. Johnson, who had been the company’s chief financial officer, resigned in May 2008. And its chief operating officer, Thomas M. Marra, seen by many as a possible successor to Mr. Ayer, announced in February that he would step down and also quit the board immediately."
