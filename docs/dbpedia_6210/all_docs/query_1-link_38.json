        "text": "NEW YORK -The ascension of Indian-born leaders like Vikram Pandit, the new CEO of Citigroup Inc., tracks the economic rise of their home country, once seen by U.S. business as a large market and a source of low-cost technology workers, now viewed as a business power that rivals the U.S. in some industries.\n\nThe change is visible on the board of the U.S.-India Business Council, once comprised only of executives from U.S. companies doing business in India. Now, the board includes executives from global companies with business in India, Indian-Americans heading global businesses and Indian companies with interest in the U.S.\n\nBoard members include Arun Kumar, head partner at KPMG International, Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo and Lakshmi Narayanan, vice chairman of Cognizant Technology Solutions, an outsourcing company that bills itself as “the best of both worlds.”\n\nArcelorMittal has grown into the world’s largest steel-maker, offering $1.65 billion last week for the remaining shares of Chinese steel-maker China Oriental Group it doesn’t already own. While the company is based in the Netherlands, its Indian CEO and founder, Lakshmi Mittal, controls nearly half its shares.\n\nIndia’s outsourcing companies have grown to take on more valuable contracts, pitting them against U.S.-based giants such as IBM Corp. and Accenture Ltd.\n\nFor instance, India’s Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. in October announced a $1.2 billion contract from American market research firm Nielsen, the largest outsourcing order ever won by an Indian company and one that includes services from information technology infrastructure management to payroll processing.\n\nAnd India’s Tata Group has expressed its interest in buying troubled Ford Motor’s Jaguar and Land Rover units.\n\n“It’s harder to see the borders now,” said Gregory Kalbaugh, director and counsel of the U.S.-India Business Council.\n\nAs the Indian economy has been on a tear, clocking 6 to 8 percent annual growth, Indian and U.S. political leaders have viewed business ties as a way to bring the countries closer. President Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh handpicked members of the US-India CEO Forum, launched in 2005, to plan increased partnership and cooperation.\n\nMeanwhile, U.S. businesses, increasingly dependent on foreign trade, have intensified their interest in promoting an international group of executives. Nearly half of sales for 238 of the largest U.S. companies was from outside the U.S. for fiscal year 2006, up from one-third of sales in fiscal 2001, according to Standard & Poor’s.\n\nAt the same time, Indians who came to the United States to study 30 years ago have worked their way up the ranks of American companies. The latest round of promotions includes Shantanu Narayen, who joined San Jose-based Adobe Systems in 1998 and was appointed CEO this month.\n\nOthers have been in their jobs far longer, such as Ramani Ayer, chairman and CEO of Hartford Financial Services Group, who has led the company since 1997.\n\nSome of the rising stars:\n\n• K.S. (Sonny) Kalsi, managing director and global head of Morgan Stanley’s real estate investing business, which has $88.3 billion in assets under management\n\n• Meena Mutyala, vice president of engineering and product management for Westinghouse Electric’s nuclear fuel business worldwide.\n\nThe rise of Indian-born executives such as Pandit, who on Monday was named CEO of Citigroup, the world’s largest bank, follows by more than a decade the advances of Indian business consultants.\n\nRajat Gupta, who joined McKinsey & Company in 1973, was elected managing director of the management consulting firm in 1994, then re-elected to two more three-year terms in 1997 and 2000. Gupta is leaving McKinsey at the end of this year to concentrate on his board positions.\n\nOne of Gupta’s latest gigs: Special adviser on management reform to the secretary-general of the United Nations."
