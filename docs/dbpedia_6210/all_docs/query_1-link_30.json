        "text": "NEW YORK --The ascension of Indian-born leaders such as Vikram Pandit, the new CEO of Citigroup Inc., tracks the economic rise of their home country, once seen by U.S. business as a large market and a source of low-cost technology workers, now viewed as a business power that rivals the U.S. in some industries.\n\nThe change is visible on the board of the U.S.-India Business Council, once composed of executives from only U.S. companies doing business in India. Now, the board includes executives from global companies with business in India, Indian-Americans leading global businesses and Indian companies with interest in the U.S.\n\nBoard members include Arun Kumar, head partner at KPMG International; Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo Inc.; and Lakshmi Narayanan, vice chairman of Cognizant Technology Solutions, an outsourcing company.\n\nArcelorMittal has grown into the world's largest steelmaker, offering $1.65 billion Friday for the remaining shares of Chinese steelmaker China Oriental Group Co. it doesn't already own. Although the company is based in Luxembourg, its Indian CEO and founder, Lakshmi Mittal, controls nearly half of its shares.\n\nIndia's outsourcing companies have grown to take on more valuable contracts, pitting them against U.S.-based giants such as IBM Corp. and Accenture Ltd.\n\nFor instance, India's Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. in October announced a $1.2 billion contract from American market-research firm Nielsen, the largest outsourcing order won by an Indian company and one that includes services from information technology infrastructure management to payroll processing.\n\nAnd India's Tata Group has expressed its interest in buying troubled Ford Motor Co.'s Jaguar and Land Rover units.\n\n\"It's harder to see the borders now,\" said Gregory Kalbaugh, director and counsel of the U.S.-India Business Council.\n\nAs the Indian economy has been on a tear, clocking 6 percent to 8 percent annual growth, Indian and U.S. political leaders have viewed business ties as a way to bring the countries closer.\n\nIndians who came to the U.S. to study 30 years ago have worked their way up the ranks of American companies. The latest round of promotions includes Shantanu Narayen, who joined Adobe Systems Inc. in 1998 and was appointed CEO this month.\n\nOthers have been in their jobs far longer, such as Ramani Ayer, chairman and CEO of Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., who has led the company since 1997.\n\nSome of the rising stars:\n\n• K.S. (Sonny) Kalsi, managing director and global head of Morgan Stanley's real-estate investing business, which has $88.3 billion in assets under management\n\n• Meena Mutyala, vice president of engineering and product management for Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s nuclear fuel business worldwide.\n\n• Sheila Hooda, senior managing director, strategy, at $437 billion investment company TIAA-CREF, who was previously a managing director in the investment-banking division at Credit Suisse."
