        "text": "On 22nd May 2020, Prof. Deepak Phatak released the film in an online event. I would like to share the film link with all of you!\n\nThe film has a long list of credits, simply because there were many, who have contributed. There were two teams, one at IITBombay and the other at Rajkot. Meet Vala who managed the Rajkot shoot is an excellent photographer, and has captured the interviews brilliantly. Some of the interviews are shot by the students themselves, since they were added at the last minute, however most of the shooting in Rajkot has been done by Meet.\n\nMy team at IITBombay has also slogged a lot for the film. We had to shoot at least three times to get my shots perfect! Getting Dr. Phatak’s portion was equally challenging, given his busy schedules..but the team managed. It was a joint effort from the eStudio team led by Sajjan Dixit, and the CDEEP team led by Tarun Negi!! On a lighter note, I said once that the film is looking good because Tarun Sajjan is making it!!\n\nThe editors also need to be complimented, since they had to show patience while dealing with the most confused and unsettled Director (yours truly!) They presented at least 3 edits for the film shoot that we had got during the last 2 years, and I wasn’t able to see the ‘flow’ in the film. I can remember the camera team up for shoot at various locations, and the editors Prakash Jadiyar and Nitin Ayer spending days in creating the Line-up.\n\nI would also like to acknowledge the efforts of the team at Shri Labhubhai Trivedi Institute of Engineering and Technology (STLIET), Rajkot, under the able leadership of Prof. Bharat Ramani and the ever enterprising Prof. Kushal Vala! He and his students have not only participated in the Blender course wholeheartedly, or help me make the film…they have gone ahead and TRANSLATED the entire course in Gujarati, and offering it currently!\n\nI just hope that this film does justice to the efforts of all those who have supported it!\n\nThis year’s birthday on 23rd was a bit low key. Thanks to the changed privacy settings of the birth date on my Facebook account. I was free from a deluge of birthday wishes. Instead I received selective messages, emails, greetings, and phone calls. However, I must admit that this was one of the best birthdays that I celebrated even though it came during the lockdown period. I will explain various things that were unique for this birthday.\n\n12:00 AM:\n\nThe first surprise came in when Kaumudi and Savani brought in homemade ice cream to start the birthday celebrations at the stroke of midnight. This was a pleasant surprise because normally we are used to have dessert at the end. In this case the dessert was actually a ‘starter’ of the celebration and that too as ‘cool’ as an ice cream!\n\n12:02 AM\n\nAs we were relishing the ice-cream, I was shocked to see being added to a new WhatsApp group titled ‘Quarantaine Special’. The group was created by the team members with whom I’ve been working for last 4 months. They are a group of professors from various domains (and various locations), with a common thread of participating in a LCM course.\n\nThis was pretty odd and I didn’t know whether it is a real group or a spam, therefore I asked this question and I saw a panic situation within the group. They had created a nice video greeting for me and wanted to upload it in a separate group and here I was doubting whether that group is genuine or a spam and not ready to participate in it or open that particular greeting.\n\nFinally after getting convinced I opened the greeting and that was an amazing surprise. These 7 people team (who hail from seven different states of the country) actually created a birthday scenario in their respective homes and wished me in their mother tongue. You can also see how they have meticulously planned all the elements for a birthday celebration such as the decorations, cake, music, caps, candles and so on and so forth!! I really cannot thank them enough for this lovely gesture. Have a look at the greeting:\n\nBirthday morning was a busy affair with many phone calls and messages coming in from parents, in-laws, friends, and other family members.\n\n01:00 PM\n\nLunch was really elaborate with Kaumudi and Savani preparing some of the traditional dishes of Maharashtrian cuisine. The picture below gives a labelled story of the menu of my lunch that day.\n\n05:00 PM\n\nBy 5:00 p.m. I was just recovering from the amazing Siesta I had after that elaborate lunch when I saw my neighbour Shivalkar Kaka in the door. He had gotten specially prepared Syria Syria made by his wife to celebrate my birthday. This was really overwhelming because his wife is is already 81 and Kaka is also over 84 now. I was speechless to see their love and affection And could do nothing but to go down and get his blessings.\n\n7:00 PM\n\nLater that evening the Walkers club on the terrace of our building invited me for a birthday party. I could see chairs and brought up and senior citizens excited to participate had come together. Kotia Kaku had prepared a Rava cake specially for the event and Kaumudi had also created a tasty snack to be distributed along with the cake. It was a quiet but a lovely moment where I cut the cake and the senior citizens blessed me! Pictures aren’t that great since the light was low!\n\nI didn’t bother… There are some moments, the camera cannot capture..this was certainly one of them!!\n\nAfter I had put up the ebook version of my course I had never thought that it will have such a positive impact in such a short span of time. However, I was pleasantly surprised when I received an email followed by a call from Prof. Kushal Vala of Rajkot. He was excited to know about the eBook and told me that he would try and convert my eBook to Gujarati, and offer it to school children who are ever willing to learned skills.\n\nThis was an exciting news to me because that is where the power of open source lies. I happily agreed to help him in this endeavor. Within a matter of few weeks he came back to tell me that the book is ready and now they want to convert this into a course for school children. He and his team of students from Shri Labhubhai Trivedi Institute of Engineering and Technology (SLTIET), worked tirelessly for past few weeks have created short courses using the eBook and uploaded them on Canvas platform.\n\nLast week we requested my mentor Prof. Deepak B. Phatak to launch the courses. He happily agreed and surprised all of us by delivering initial part of his address in fluent Gujarati!\n\nProf. Chetas Oza of Akashvani Rajkot station interviewed me about this effort along with Prof. Kushal. This interview is going to transmitted today. I request all of you to propagate this to your friends and families who could be interested in it."
