        "text": "Gov. Malloy’s wise veto of the education commissioner bill\n\nIf you aim to limit the amount of innovation that can happen in the public education arena, one surefire method would be to keep it an insider’s game. On Monday the legislature is required to convene a veto session to consider whether to override any of Gov. Dannel Malloy’s vetoes. At this time, it is […]\n\nThe basics: Future CT education chiefs must be teachers\n\nThe Connecticut House on Thursday approved a bill to ensure that future state education commissioners have a strong background in the classroom — something the last controversial education commissioner lacked. Here are some things to know.\n\nThis time, Malloy picks a former teacher for top education post\n\nUpdated at 4:48 p.m.\n\nWhile announcing Dianna Wentzell as the state’s next education commissioner Friday, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy made clear he was looking for a teacher — a qualification his first controversial commissioner did not have.\n\nOp-Ed: School officials should not interfere with opting out of SBAC tests\n\nGov. Dannel Malloy, Interim Commissioner of Education Dianna Wentzell and all superintendents of schools should cease their obstruction of the rights of parents to decide whether to allow their children to sit for the SBAC test.\n\nHelp wanted: CT commissioner with education background\n\nThe panel searching for the state’s next education commissioner wants someone who has a long background and an advanced degree in education – qualifications the last commissioner did not have and which one of the state’s teachers’ unions called for during the campaign.\n\nPryor heading to Rhode Island as secretary of commerce\n\nOutgoing Connecticut Education Commissioner Stefan Pryor has been nominated to lead the Department of Commerce in Rhode Island — a state with the third-highest unemployment rate in the country.\n\nEducation commissioner leaving first week of January\n\nCommissioner Stefan Pryor, the leader of the state Department of Education who helped craft controversial legislation during his tenure, will leave office the first week of January. Pryor announced in August his intention to leave the post if Gov. Dannel P. Malloy won re-election.\n\nState education board wants to open eight new charter schools\n\nThe State Board of Education is asking the state for $21 million to fund eight new charter schools to open over the next two school years. The request would add hundreds of seats in charter schools throughout Connecticut.\n\nMalloy celebrates Pryor, but makes gesture to union critics\n\nNEW BRITAIN – By turns wistful and upbeat, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy and Education Commissioner Stefan Pryor put a positive spin Thursday on Pryor’s announcement he will leave the Malloy administration, a departure sought by unions important to the governor’s re-election. He later named a leader of a teachers’ union to the State Board of Education.\n\nStefan Pryor to leave education post after one term\n\nStefan Pryor announced Monday he will not seek another term as state education commissioner, a step that could diminish some of the teacher dissatisfaction with the administration of Gov. Dannel P. Malloy.\n\nScandal called ‘important moment’ in charter movement\n\nAn inquiry into the state’s oversight of charter schools, once celebrated as laboratories of urban educational achievement and innovation, comes as they increasingly face a backlash from teachers’ unions and political figures ranging from the mayor of New York City to a third-party candidate for governor of Connecticut.\n\nMalloy offers ‘Connecticut Core’ as Common Core fix\n\nWith cover from the state’s two largest teachers’ unions, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy on Thursday kicked off “Connecticut Core,” the administration’s latest effort to quell the political and policy clamor over how Common Core curriculum standards should be implemented.\n\nWashington Watch, Week of May 18\n\nIn the week before Congress’ Memorial Day Break, the House will tackle a bill that would boost accountability at the scandal-plagued Department of Veterans Affairs. Legislation that would provide billions of dollars for Connecticut’s defense contractors will also move forward this week with a House vote on the National Defense Authorization bill and action in the House Appropriations Committee on a defense spending bill that would fund all projects in the authorization bill.\n\nImproved graduation rates give Malloy a campaign talking point\n\nA fourth consecutive year of improving graduation rates and narrowing achievement gaps gave Gov. Dannel P. Malloy an opportunity Wednesday to begin to turn education reform from an irritant in his relationship with teachers to an election-year asset with the broader electorate."
