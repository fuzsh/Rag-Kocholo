        "text": "Arun Sarin, Vodafone\n\nHe's been called \"the big shots' big shot\".\n\nI prayed to God and asked him how I could have more than 24 hours a day.... And God brought me Arun.\"\n\nInfoSpace Founder Naveen Jain after getting\n\nArun Sarin to sign on as CEO, as quoted in\n\nThe Street.com\n\nThat didn't last. So, in July 2001, Sarin signed on as CEO of Accel-kkr Telecom. But the Vodafone connection remained: he continued to serve as a non-executive director of the company-he is also on the board of Charles Schwab, Cisco, and Gap. Come summer 2003, though, and 48-year old Sarin, an IIT-Kharagpur alumnus will take over as the chief executive of the only mobile telephone company in the world that has over 100 million users across 29 countries. Clearly, the search committee had not forgotten the man who built AirTouch Communications from a small wireless company into a global player prior to its acquisition by Vodafone. Sarin takes over the hot seat at Vodafone (in London) at a time when the company is struggling to earn a return on the $90 billion it invested in 3g (third generation) licences. That's some task.\n\nRajat Gupta, McKinsey\n\nHeading McKinsey is no mean achievement.\n\n''Rajat is the future of the Firm\"\n\nFormer McKinsey consultant and one-man industry Tom Peters in a 1994 interview to Business Today\n\nIn 1973, when Rajat K. Gupta, then a 25-year-old fresh out of Harvard Business School was interviewed by McKinsey, the firm rejected him because he lacked work experience. It was only after one of his professors, Walter Salmon wrote to Ron Daniel, then the manager of McKinsey's New York office and the man who had conducted the interview, asking him to reconsider his decision that Gupta got a look in. In 1994, Gupta was elected to the top post. The IIT-Delhi alum has been re-elected twice since, in 1997 and 2000.\n\nToday, as he nears the end of his third and, probably, last term at the head of the world's premier consulting firm, Gupta is often described as one of the most powerful managing directors McKinsey has ever seen. In the eight years he has been in charge, the Firm has doubled in size and expanded into emerging markets such as China, India, and South Korea. A die-hard Indophile Gupta had to live down the firm's association with Enron and the dotcom bust (the firm had hired in anticipation of a continuing boom), but then, no CEO has had it easy these past years.\n\nRajiv L. Gupta, Rohm and Haas Co\n\nThe other Gupta, he heads a $6-billion speciality chemicals company.\n\n\"While few consumers know us, few industries don't.\"\n\nExcerpt from Rohm & Hass' website\n\nYou could say that about Raj Gupta too. When Gupta moved from Scott Paper Co to Rohm & Haas in 1971 he did so because the company had an office in India: the IIT Mumbai alum believed that the move would one day help him return to India. That didn't happen-he did become director of the company's Asia Pacific operations in 1993, as close as he would get to India-but in 1999, he was named chairman and CEO. Gupta's election as chairman was indication of the growing importance of the division he headed, electronic materials-these go into creating components for cellular phones, computers, and other electronic devices. The year that was, 2002, was hard on Thorm And Haas-it involved a $200 million cost reduction-but surely, electronic devices aren't going to go away.\n\nRamani Ayer, The Hartford\n\nAyer may well be the first Indian to have made it big in the upper-crust world of American insurance.\n\nA hartford lifer, Ayer belongs to a small people of non-American origin who head a large insurance company-The Hartford was one of the United States' largest insurance and financial services company in 2001 with total revenues of $15.2 billion. Like Gupta, Ayer is a product of the Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai.\n\nAman Mehta, HSBC\n\nThe first Indian manager at HSBC has carried things to their logical denouement.\n\nThe third lifer in this section, Mehta is the only one of the six executives profiled here who is not from an IIT. An economics graduate from Delhi U, he began his career at the Mumbai office of Mercantile Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary of HSBC in 1967. \"A multicultural workforce has become something most MNCs see as an advantage these days,\" says Mehta who worked his way up, rung by corporate rung until he was named CEO of HSBC Ltd in 1999. The secret of his success: the Indian education system, proficiency in English, and old-world family values, common in India, that provide a support system.\n\nPast Glory\n\nCEOs who were trail-blazers on the global scene.\n\nShailesh J. Mehta,\n\nChairman and CEO, Providian Financial Corporation\n\nOne of the 20 most highly paid American execs in his time, Mehta, an IIT Mumbai alum made the headlines with his strategy of building a business by issuing credit cards to people with high risk credit profiles. On the strength of this strategy, Providian became the fifth largest issuer of credit cards in the US. Pressure from consumer groups that believed the company charged them too much interest may have had a hand in Mehta's resignation in October 2001. He is now President and CEO of Granite Hill Capital Ventures.\n\nJamshed 'Jim' Wadia,\n\nManaging Partner, Arthur Andersen\n\nA lawyer and accountant by training, Wadia headed premier accounting firm Arthur Andersen until internal disillusionment over his handling of the split with Andersen Consulting caused him to leave in 2000. The man who must be relieved he departed long before Enron happened now works for law firm Linklaters.\n\nRonojoy 'Rono' Dutta\n\nPresident, United Airlines\n\nYet another IIT product (from Kharagpur), fortune magazine once called him \"the company's principal blue-sky thinker\". But Dutta could never see eye to eye with the 54 per cent employee-owned company's union. He quit in September 2002.\n\nRakesh Gangwal,\n\nPresident and CEO, US Airways\n\nA mechanical engineer from IIT-Kanpur, Gangwal was one of the airline industry's most respected execs: he grew US Airways from a $800 million also-ran to a $8-billion powerhouse. But events following 9-11 compounded its woes-a long-anticipated merger with United Airlines had fallen through earlier-and he quit in November 2001. He is now a venture capitalist.\n\nRana Talwar,\n\nCEO, Standard Chartered Bank\n\nTalwar earned his spurs in Citi where he built its retail business in Asia. However, he may have displayed the Citi brand of aggressiveness a mite too soon in Standard Chartered, which named him CEO in 1998. He left in 2001 and will earn a reported £3 million for remaining unemployed till August 31, 2003-so said his contract-after his departure from the bank.\n\nCEOs In The Making\n\nThe men and women most likely to occupy corner rooms in global corporations. Soon.\n\nIndra Nooyi\n\nPepsiCo may essentially be a coloured water company, but an Indian woman is its President and CFO.\n\nFrom the lush Tambaram campus of madras Christian College-she was part of the college band and used to belt out popular hits such as Jailhouse Rock-to the town of Purchase, New York, may be a long strange trip, but Indra Nooyi has done the distance, and done it in style. Now 47, the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta, and Yale School of Management alum is responsible for all corporate functions at the $26-billion PepsiCo, the world's fifth-largest beverage company. From the spin-off of Tricon Global Restaurants and the IPO of Pepsi Bottling to the acquisition of brand Tropicana and Quaker Oats, Nooyi has played a major role in shaping PepsiCo's future. That is why many expect the diminutive mother of two to one day head the company.\n\nMuktesh Pant\n\nFrom HLL, to PepsiCo to Reebok Mickey Pant keeps running.\n\nThe marathon man-he still runs about 42 kms a week-and one-time poster boy of India Inc, Pant is now setting the streets on fire in Boston, where the $3-billion footwear major Reebok is based. The IIT-Kanpur alum-he refused an offer from IIM-A to join HLL (he calls it \"the best training school in the world\")-who has had stints at PepsiCo India and Reebok India, is in charge of marketing at the company he could one day head.\n\nJayshree Ullal\n\nGo-go Cisco's optical business is headed by Ullal.\n\nShe has worked for crescendo, AMD, and Fairchild Semiconductor, heads one of Cisco's most important businesses, and was named by Newsweek as one of the 20 women to watch in 2001-surely, a CV can't get better.\n\nPadmasree Warrior\n\nWarrior was the first woman Chief Technology Officer in the US.\n\nThe requisite IIT Delhi qualification is there in Warrior's resume as is an impressive stint as CTO of Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector-it is the world's largest embedded electronics producer. Now a Corporate Vice President at Motorola and in charge of an emerging business, Energy Systems Group, Warrior actually manages to find time for painting and pottery.\n\nArun Netravali\n\nThe man himself attributes it all to luck, but don't be fooled by that; Netravali is an ace scientific mind.\n\nAsk Netravali about his education at IIT-Mumbai, or his stint at Bell Labs and Lucent's Chief Scientist passes it off as \"luck\". \"It's all about being in the right place at the right time,\" he says. So, it is not easy to get him to talk about his achievements. Of those, the Padma Bhushan recipients has several: 70 patents, partial responsibility for high-definition TV, and the man whose work forms the basis for everything from streaming video on the Net to video compression techniques. And he calls that luck?\n\nKeki Dadiseth\n\nHe generates half Unilever's revenues.\n\nHindustan lever limited may contribute just around 10 per cent to Unilever's revenues of $46.7 billion, but there's no denying its standing as one of the jewels in the Anglo-Dutch consumer product giant's crown. Much of that stems from its ability to feed the Unilever system with superior managerial talent. Like Keki Dadiseth. In 2000, the former HLL chairman moved to London, first as head of personnel and then as the man in charge of Unilever's home and personal care businesses, which accounts for half of Unilever's revenues.\n\nVictor Menezes\n\nMenezes is still in the race for Citigroup's leadership.\n\nAfter blowing hot and blowing cold for well nigh to three years, Menezes, now Chairman and CEO, Citibank, seems to have lost out in the race to become CEO of Citigroup. Still the 53-year-old IIT-Mumbai, Sloan School product has managed to survive Citi's merger with Travellers, and thrived. Don't count the quiet, diplomatic Mr Menezes out yet.\n\nVyomesh Joshi\n\nJoshi heads HP's most profitable business.\n\nA techie at heart-he joined hp in 1980 and spent his first four years \"inventing\"-Joshi is the keeper of hp's digital imaging strategy (his card reads Executive VP, Imaging and Printing Group), key to the success of the new hp. Business isn't just about people and innovation, believes the fuelled-by-passion Joshi. It is about learning.\n\nRakesh Kapoor\n\nLittle-known Kapoor is a star in the Reckitt Benckiser system.\n\nHead of Reckitt's operations in the UK and Ireland, Kapoor attributes his success to \"the ability to change, and to get the business to change\". In his present post since 2001, Kapoor believes it is too early to consider a move back. \"I have unfinished business,\" he says. We understand.\n\nSomasegar Sivaramakichenane\n\nJust think of Microsoft's Soma as Windows' keeper.\n\nHis designation may look innocuous (Corporate Vice President of Microsoft's Windows Engineering Services Group), and he may be just one of the approximately 17,700 Microsoft employees (the software monolith has 50,621 employees on its rolls) who are Indian, but Soma is-we are not kidding here-Windows' keeper.\n\nOffshore Enterprise\n\nTwenty five Global Indian entrepreneurial success stories\n\nLaxmi N.
