It is the No. 1 writer of annuities in the U.S. Ayer spoke recently with BW's Susan Jackson.\n\nA: First of all, I categorize the industry in terms of personal financial services and commercial risk services. Personal financial services include individual property/casualty insurance, life insurance, and annuities. Commercial risk services include commercial property/casualty and other commercial-related products. As I look ahead, I definitely see personal financial services continuing to present good growth opportunities and good margins. In commercial risk services, the intensity of competition and overpayment in the business...will intensify competition even more and cause margins to be under pressure. [In general], the strong companies will get stronger, and the weak companies will get weaker."
