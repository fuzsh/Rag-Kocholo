        "text": "Synopsis\n\nChief of Hartford Financial Services Ramani Ayer and GE's Jeffrey R Immelt have been named among \"overpaid bosses\". Gates, Jobs among top 20 CEOs | NRI Taxation\n\nNEW YORK: At a time when executive compensation has rankled many nerves, India-origin chief of Hartford Financial Services Ramani Ayer and General Electric's chief Jeffrey R Immelt have been named among the \"overpaid bosses\" by business magazine Forbes.\n\nThe list is based on the performance of executives who delivered the most to the company's shareholders, relative to their total compensation.\n\nKenneth D Lewis, who has been at the helm of battered financial services entity Bank of America, medical devices maker Boston Scientific's James R Tobin and automotive seating system's supplier Lear's Robert E Rossiter also come under the \"overpaid bosses\" category.\n\nDuring the 12-year tenure of Ayer at the helm of financial services provider Hartford Financial Services, the annualised total return to shareholders has been \"-8 per cent\", the magazine said.\n\nForbes noted that his six-year average annual compensation stood at USD 13.5 million whereas the annualised six-year total return was \"-17 per cent\". He owns just 0.1 per cent of the firm's stocks.\n\nImmelt has been the Chief Executive of diversified conglomerate General Electric for eight years and in that period, the publication pointed out that the annualised total return was \"-12 per cent\".\n\nThe GE chief's annual pay on a six-year average was at USD 14.4 million while the annualised six-year total return stood at \"-11 per cent\".\n\nAccording to the magazine, Bank of America's six-year annual return of \"-16 per cent\" lagged in comparison with its sector; \"its -8 per cent annual return since Lewis took over as top executive in April 2001 also trailed the S&P 500. Over the past six years, Lewis has been collecting a paycheck averaging USD 30 million annually,\" it added.\n\nForbes' annual performance against pay scorecard looked at \"executives who delivered the most to shareholders relative to their total compensation\".\n\nThe publication found 179 CEOs, whose companies have been publicly trading since April 2003, have been in office at least six years and have at least six years of pay history.\n\nFurther, the grading was based on four factors including the company's stock performance (including dividends) relative to that of its industry peers over six years.\n\nWe consider annualised stock performance during the leader's tenure and performance relative to the S&P 500 during that time. Finally, we look at total compensation over the past six years,\" the magazine said.\n\nMeanwhile, during the 10-year tenure as Boston Scientific's chief Tobin, the annualised return to the shareholders was \"-7 per cent\" whereas the annualised six-year total return stood at \"-14 per cent\".\n\nOver the past six years, Tobin has been receiving a pay averaging USD 8.5 million on an annual basis.\n\nRegarding Lear's Rossiter, the publication noted that he has been the chief for nine years and the annualised total return in that period for shareholders was at \"-29 per cent\".\n\nThe six-year annualised total return was \"-45 per cent\" while Rossiter got a six-year average annual compensation of USD 5.5 million.\n\nPorts to power, what companies facing insolvency mean for Adani Group\n\nA list of 20 large-cap stocks where you have lost money big time.\n\nThe many gaps in conflict of interest allegations against Sebi chief, other Indian regulators\n\nFour ingredients that helped Mahindra Thar leave Maruti Jimny and Jeep Wrangler behind\n\nIndian investors are diverging from those in advanced markets.
