Choose your four-legged bobble headed puppy from a whopping 48 breeds and you%26rsquo;ll begin a surprisingly entertaining adventure. It%26rsquo;s not GTA or anything, obviously, but it%26rsquo;s still quite diverting.\n\nYou must find a cure for your sick sibling, which involves traveling to Dog Island and gathering remedy ingredients. Along the way, your pooch will take part in a host of quests, such as delivering packages, fishing, or finding lost items by sniffing and digging. You can also pimp your pup in various accessories for that personal touch. And there are some basic RPG elements, such as leveling up every time you discover new smells to sniff out.\n\nOK, the graphics are basic and the sound primal, but it%26rsquo;s harmless enough. There%26rsquo;s nothing here for most gamers, but buy it for younglings with a penchant for canines and they%26rsquo;ll be happy for hours.\n\nJul 15, 2008"
