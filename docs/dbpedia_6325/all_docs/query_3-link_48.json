With 175 sites and about 2,000 miles of trail separated into four distinct regions, the IBT represents a collection of bird watching hotspots, diverse habitats, and a glimpse of Idaho's rich natural heritage.\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about birding in Idaho, visit the Idaho Birding Trail website.\n\nBocce\n\nThe bocce ball courts will be used on Tuesday and Wednesday evenings, mid-April to mid-September, and is located off the University and Capital Blvd entrance in between the Ann Morrison soccer and softball fields.\n\nFor Tuesday play contact Judy Campbell, Secretary, Tuesday Ann Morrison Bocce League\n\nFor Wednesday play please contact: Anne Marie Piccotti, President, at (208) 375-5228 or by email at idahobocceballclub@gmail.com\n\nAvailable by reservation or on a first-come, first-serve basis.\n\nDog Off-Leash\n\nDogs and their owners should be sure to follow the city's leash ordinance going to and coming from the dog park, and follow the dog off-leash rules and regulations while visiting the park. Learn more.\n\nTogether Treasure Valley Dog Island is located in the southwest corner of Ann Morrison Park and is a year-round destination for dogs and their owners.\n\nThe site includes a 5.4-acre active dog area, a fenced “shy dog” area and opportunities for dogs to swim and play in the surrounding pond. Two picnic shelters have been installed along with nine Together Treasure Valley park benches offering ample seating throughout the park.\n\nThe $450,000 project was funded in part through donations from the group Together Treasure Valley and the Harry W. Morrison Foundation.\n\nSeasonal Off-Leash at Ann Morrison Park\n\nThe opening of Together Treasure Valley Dog Island will not change Ann Morrison Park’s seasonal dog off-leash schedule. The park will continue to be open to off-leash pets November 1 through the end of February.\n\nRiver Take Out and Floater Drop-Off\n\n2024 SEASON DATES ARE JUNE 27 THROUGH LABOR DAY.\n\nFloating the Boise River from Barber Park to Ann Morrison Park is a popular summer activity. The take out is located river left just before the bridge. When ending your river float at Ann Morrison Park, please use the trash receptacles located at the takeout area. If trash cans are full, please pack out your trash to keep the park clean. The shuttle pick up and drop off is located across the grass from the take out on the main road through Ann Morrison Park.\n\nShuttles are run by Boise River Raft & Tube. Daily they depart Ann Morrison Park every hour on the hour from 12-9 p.m. and Saturday/Sunday every 20 minutes from 12-9 p.m.\n\nThe Boise Parks and Recreation team has added an additional floater drop off area in Ann Morrison Park next to the playground. This area is designed to help the flow of traffic for people who park at Ann Morrison Park and need a place to pack up when they finish their float or when they unload passengers to take the shuttle to Barber Park before floating the river.\n\nPeople who park in Ann Morrison Park can take a shuttle for a small fee to Barber Park to start their float trip. Parking is available on a first come, first served basis at no cost inside the park.\n\nPark Infrastructure Improvement Project\n\nThe project will provide permanent network infrastructure to support park events and operations throughout the park footprint. Improvements include installation of fiber optic conduit and cabling and networking to provide Wi-Fi connectivity for future events, park visitors and staff needs. Thank you for your patience and for staying out of any closed areas while work is completed.\n\nAnn Morrison Park Renewal Project\n\nThe Harry W. Morrison Foundation has initiated the Come Play! Campaign to fund the improvement of Ann Morrison Park. The foundation’s goal is to raise $2 million, which will garner $4 million in matching support. They have partnered with the City of Boise to provide the matching funds. In addition, the Harry W. Morrison Foundation has pledged to pay all fundraising costs.\n\nLEARN MORE\n\nAbout the Park\n\nOne of the \"Ribbon of Jewels,\" Ann Morrison is an urban park located on the Boise River. The park property was purchased by Morrison-Knudsen Co. founder Harry W. Morrison in honor of his late wife, Ann Morrison, and built in 1959 by Morrison-Knudsen employees.\n\nPublic Art\n\nThree Deer by Bernie Jesterbeck Hart"
