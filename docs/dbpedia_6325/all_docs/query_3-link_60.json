        "text": "A portable hunting stand is any device or structure used for the purpose of hunting that can be carried and erected by hand.\n\nPortable hunting stands and blinds and associated equipment using no metal objects (such as screwin steps) to be screwed or driven into trees may be used, but must have the owner’s name and address permanently attached. Stands must be moved at least 200 yards after seven days.\n\nDeer stands and blinds may not be placed on a WMA more than seven days before deer archery season and must be removed from the WMA within seven days after the close of deer archery season.\n\nPortable, pop-up blinds must have 144 square inches of blaze orange or chartreuse visible from all sides of the blind during firearms deer, bear and elk seasons on WMAs.\n\nOn USDA Forest Service lands, portable stands must comply with USDA Forest Service regulations.\n\nEach WMA is a separate zone for which the Commission may establish and apply hunting regulations. All private lands (including any combinations of lands separately owned, and regardless of whether such lands touch a road, creek, stream, river, lake or other waterbody) that are completely surrounded by WMA lands (except NWRs) shall be considered as inholdings. Such inholdings shall be subject to the same regulations pertaining to hunting season dates, hunting hours, bag limits and hunting permits as the surrounding WMA.\n\nException:\n\nPrivate lands that are completely surrounded by ANHC or NWR lands shall be subject to the same state regulations pertaining to hunting season dates, hunting hours, bag limits and hunting permits as the surrounding or nearest adjacent private land deer zone plus any federal regulations pertaining to ANHC or NWR inholdings.\n\nAny motorized vehicle including, all-terrain vehicles, dune buggies, and amphibious vehicles are restricted on WMAs. Motorized vehicles as listed previously may not be operated off any open access road or parking area, behind gated, cabled or earthen barriers, or on levees, dams, food plots, fire lanes or roads developed for wildlife.
