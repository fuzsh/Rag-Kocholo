        "meta_description": "Dog Island (Isla Perro) is a  tropical paradise in the Caribbean Sea off the coast of Panama located in the San Blas Island chain that stretches from the central easten coast of Panama southward to Colombia. These islands are a part of Panama but are governed by the indiginous Kuna people who inhabit the islands. We arrived on Dog Island after an hour long boat ride from Wichub Wala in an open topped wooden skiff. We did hit some pretty large waves on part of the journey so be prepared. The island is beautiful but only one side of the island is safe for swimming. AT the time of our visit there were frequent gusts of wind that created choppy seas in the narrow sea passage that seperates Pelican Island and Dog Island. Just off Dog Island is a sunken long boat that can be easily reached from just off shore. Its a good spot for snorkeling. There is one Kuna family that inhabits the island and live in a well built palm thatched dwelling. They sell cold beverages (including Balboa beer). They may even allow camping on their island if you arrange it with the family upon your arrival. It is a small island so space is limited. We arrived by Twin Otter aircraft at the Cati airstrip which is about an hour or two boat ride from Wichub Wala. From Wichub Wala is was another hour long boat ride to Dog Island. I believe the air strip at El Porvenir is closer. Also...be prepared for some serious sun! The sand is blach white and very reflective. I got the worst burn of my life here......but I still love the place.",
