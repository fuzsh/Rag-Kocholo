        "text": "You are the main character, and you are on a quest to find the Legendary Flower to cure your sibling. Between your hometown and the numerous villages on The Dog Island, you will meet many dogs and a few other creatures. The dogs are of all different breeds, and many will have a task for you to complete.\n\nAlex[edit | edit source]\n\nAlex is the stay-at-home Black Labrador, who likes reading books more than anything else. He also assumes that he is the riddle master and will challenge you to four riddles throughout the game. He is Amalia's brother and, in her opinion, is just lazy and too old to be sitting around. Alex also lives next door to Amalia, his house being a giant book.\n\nIf you speak to Alex, and you're not supposed to be solving a riddle, he can detect how much health you have; if all your hearts are red, he will say \"It's good to see you looking well\", whereas if any of your hearts are black he will say that you look sick.\n\nPlaces: Pupsville\n\nAlice[edit | edit source]\n\nAlice is Noble's maid, and is a Poodle. She'll help her little princely-paws if he is going to get into trouble, even if it means taking a key from the master without permission.\n\nPlaces: Pupsville\n\nAlphonso[edit | edit source]\n\nAlphonso is a Rottweiler and he greets visitors coming from Zoomy Lake.\n\nPlaces: Zoomy Village\n\nAmalia[edit | edit source]\n\nAmalia is the kind Yellow Labrador Retriever who will show you the way to Dr. Potan's clinic and help you get started on your journey. Although she doesn't always get along with her brother, Alex, she'll get along with everyone else just fine. If you are a boy dog, she'll show interest in you and ask you out on a date. If you refuse, she won't speak to you for the rest of the game. She will ask you to make her stew.\n\nPlaces: Pupsville · Green Meadows (during The Golden Pup if you are a boy dog)\n\nAmedio[edit | edit source]\n\nAmedio, a Pug, is your hometown friend along with Viviana. He likes to go to the Puroro Town Festival with you and will send you a letter when you're on your journey. If you're playing a girl character, he hints that he may even like you romantically.\n\nPlaces: Puroro Town\n\nAnc Queen[edit | edit source]\n\nThe Anc Queen has sent your friend Petasi down to the Land of Dogs as punishment for being a brat. She's saddened by the news that dogs have all but forgotten to thank Mother Nature for her bounty (spoiler: nature worship) and believes this is the reason for the deterioration of her homeworld. You can help her by retrieving the Stone of the Heavens for use in the Star Festival.\n\nPlaces: Anc Road\n\nAncient Monster[edit | edit source]\n\nThis malevolent guardian of the Stone of the Heavens will stop at nothing to keep you out of his lair. Find the right buttons, and you'll have no problem with this pile of bones.\n\nPlaces: Kunka Ruins\n\nAndrea[edit | edit source]\n\nAndrea the Great Dane stays in the town square by your Anc Tree. She's very impressed by all the shops Pupsville has to offer. When you are saying good-bye to everyone near the end of the game, she comments on how she'll tell her fellows about how she helped you, although she never did.\n\nPlaces: Pupsville\n\nBalthazar[edit | edit source]\n\nBalthazar, a Doberman, runs the complicated mining machinery used to get water for his village. He shows his importance by saying how there is little water underground, but that is odd, since the Chiro Caves are full of water. Maybe the water is bad or too tricky to get without being mauled by bats.\n\nPlaces: Chiro Village\n\nBernard[edit | edit source]\n\nHe's the cook aboard El Dorado's ship, and he requires fish for dinner. You get some time off of scrubbing the deck on your second day at sea to fish up a Sea Bass and a Pacific Saury for him. You even get a Fishing Rod out of the deal! If you collect extra fish, he will gladly take them off your paws and give you Woofs for them. He is a Shiba Inu.\n\nPlaces: El Dorado's Ship\n\nBill[edit | edit source]\n\nBill, a Bull Terrier, is the ex-leader of the Victory Gang. He'd like to turn them back into nice dogs, but he's pretty busy working for Isaki as a fisherdog. If you find his Victory Gang badge, maybe the other dogs will listen to you.\n\nPlaces: Green Meadows\n\nBoris[edit | edit source]\n\nBoris is a Dalmatian and a delivery man with a bad sense of direction. But once you've helped him overcome this, he'll happily take you to any village you've been to before on the Island, and a few outside areas too. So if you're in Pupsville and you want to get to the Chilly Fields in double quick time, you know who to talk to!\n\nPlaces: Pupsville · Zoomy Village · Gigili Village · Gola Highlands · Chiro Village · West Chilly Field · Snow Village · Rune Village · Rune Canyon\n\nBrian[edit | edit source]\n\nPreferring to keep to himself, Brian is in the building labeled \"A House.\" He says the house near the lake is his, even though there is no such house.\n\nPlaces: Zoomy Village\n\nCameron[edit | edit source]\n\nCameron, a Papillon, sells accessories up north, which, if you want to be a pirate, is the only place to get an Eyepatch.\n\nPlaces: Snow Village\n\nCamille[edit | edit source]\n\nCamille runs an inn in the desert. Make good use of her services if you get poisoned in South Sandy Desert. Obaba's Antidote costs two Woofs more and doesn't even heal the hearts you've lost!\n\nPlaces: Gigili Village\n\nCamu[edit | edit source]\n\nCamu, a Jack Russell Terrier, likes to play hide-and-seek and is more than willing to take you out on a date if you're playing as a girl dog. He is also a member of the Victory Gang.\n\nPlaces: Pupsville · Green Meadows (if you choose him for The Golden Pup)\n\nCarol[edit | edit source]\n\nCarol, a Beagle, is the proprietor of the Zoomy Village Accessory Shop.\n\nPlaces: Zoomy Village\n\nCasbal[edit | edit source]\n\nCasbal is a rude little dog in one of the houses labeled \"A House.\" Don't listen to him when he says you are too weak and small to run away from a buffalo. He should be pleased if you have a Silver on hand. when speaking to him, he will rob you of your Silver.\n\nPlaces: Rune Village\n\nCherry[edit | edit source]\n\nCherry, a Welsh Corgi, is the Flower Collector, and, while there are no missions associated with her, if you want to sell your flowers or earn the Flower Master Decorations, you'll be spending some time with her in the building labeled \"A House.\"\n\nPlaces: Pupsville\n\nClark[edit | edit source]\n\nClark is a Pekingese and another Victory Gang dog, and his main hobby is catching bugs. He'll challenge you at some point, and if you win, you get the Bug Cage and the ability to catch bugs for the rest of the game. He ends most of his sentences with \"man\" and can't pronounce the word necessary. If you give him the Cabbage Butterfly before you help Amalia with her brother, he'll admit that she's really cool, suggesting that he might like her a bit.\n\nPlaces: Pupsville · Zoomy Village\n\nDarna[edit | edit source]\n\nDarna is a Border Collie. She is the Food Collector, appropriately stationed in the Restaurant. You don't ever have to talk to Darna, but if you want to unload some Food or you want to fill out the Food Collector book, you'll need to do some business with her.\n\nPlaces: Pupsville\n\nDerrick[edit | edit source]\n\nDerrick is the Bug Collector who stays in a room in Noble's house with Kristina and Dougal. If you find any bugs while roaming around The Dog Island, Derrick's the one who can take them off your hands. He is also an Akita.\n\nPlaces: Pupsville\n\nDoluk / Doroken[edit | edit source]\n\nYour father is either Doluk or Doroken depending on what gender you are and whether you have a younger brother or sister. Although you never actually see him during gameplay, you are told that he went to The Dog Island a long time ago to find a remedy for your sibling's illness, but he never came back. This is the reason why Mar wasn't sure about letting you go to the Island. If you make it through the credits at the end of the game, you'll see the family reunion when an old friend accompanies him back home. Your father, like everyone in your family, will be the same breed you choose for your character.\n\nPlaces: You never get to interact with your father, but if you wait until after the credits at the end of the game, you will see him in a cutscene.\n\nDonatello[edit | edit source]\n\nThis is a wise old Weimaraner in your hometown who is always ready to tell a long story. He helps Mr. Postman figure out where to deliver your letter in the beginning of the game.\n\nPlaces: Puroro Town\n\nDorothy[edit | edit source]\n\nShe is a Pomeranian and a health nut. She would do anything to stay healthy, even if it means doing something unhealthy. She will ask you to get some things for her.\n\nPlaces: Pupsville\n\nDougal[edit | edit source]\n\nDougal, a Bernese Mountain Dog, is the Fish Collector who stays in Noble's house after you rescue Kristina. He will buy your fish from you or put them in his book. Complete the Fish Collector book and you'll get the Fish Master Hat.\n\nPlaces: Pupsville\n\nDr. Hill[edit | edit source]\n\nYour hometown German Shepherd doctor, Dr. Hill is pessimistic about your sibling's chances of survival. Even though he's a skeptic, he does let you know about Dr. Potan on The Dog Island, who may be of more assistance.\n\nPlaces: Dr. Hill is only seen in a cutscene at the beginning of the game in Puroro Town.\n\nDr. Potan[edit | edit source]\n\nDr. Potan is the doctor on The Dog Island. He lost his girlfriend long ago, and visits her grave on the day she died each month. Your sibling may be suffering from the same sickness that killed her, which makes him more than willing to help you. He had been holding a grudge with Obaba about his girlfriend's death, but eventually forgives her. Despite the fact that a Beagle's sense of smell is 55 times more powerful than a human's, he doesn't really know how to sniff. In a letter he may show romantic feelings for Mar.\n\nPlaces: Puroro Town · Pupsville · Zoomy Lake\n\nEisman[edit | edit source]\n\nEisman is a Chihuahua, and believe it or not, eisman is the German word for \"ice cream.\" Very handy, considering he lives in the middle of the desert!\n\nPlaces: Gigili Village\n\nEl Dorado[edit | edit source]\n\nCaptain of his own ship, El Dorado the English Cocker Spaniel brings letters from afar and is willing to take brave dogs to exotic destinations. When you decide to travel to The Dog Island to search for a cure for your sibling, El Dorado will doesn't mind taking you, as long as you're willing to work for your passage.\n\nPlaces: Puroro Town · El Dorado's Ship · Pupsville\n\nElaine[edit | edit source]\n\nThis is Nurse Francis' childhood friend, with whom she has lost contact. Maybe if they were reunited and they resolved their misunderstandings, Francis could overcome her chronic fear.\n\nPlaces: Zoomy Village\n\nEmilio / Maria[edit | edit source]\n\nYour sibling's name is Emilio or Maria, depending on whether you chose a little brother or little sister, respectively. Your brother or sister is sick with a dangerous illness that has no cure, or so the doctors say. Your sibling hates being sick and will try hard to fight against it. On your travels you will get letters from your brother or sister and maybe even a drawing. Your brother or sister, like everyone in your family, will be the same breed you choose for your character.\n\nPlaces: Puroro Town\n\nEnzo[edit | edit source]\n\nEnzo is an Australian Shepherd, and he is the milkman of Puroro Town. His son sometimes helps him, although it isn't really \"helping\" at all, considering that he lost Enzo's basket.\n\nPlaces: Puroro Town\n\nEve[edit | edit source]\n\nEve, a cream Dachshund, is the other half of the Pupsville construction crew besides Tom. She is working on clearing the shortcut between Pupsville and Treely Woods from the Treely Woods side.\n\nPlaces: Treely Woods\n\nFrancis[edit | edit source]\n\nShe is a Maltese and terribly afraid of the color red! All because of an incident that happened when she was a child, and because of that she decided to become a nurse, but now the Victory Gang Dogs like to pick on her. Francis, like Alex and Obaba, will comment on your health if she doesn't have a mission or other information for you.\n\nPlaces: Pupsville\n\nGainyard[edit | edit source]\n\nThis is the innkeeper up north. If you've tangled with some Polar Bears or you just want to get out of the cold, he'll let you rest up in one of his beds for only 1 Woof.\n\nPlaces: Snow Village\n\nGentle Bear[edit | edit source]\n\nHe is, as the name suggests, a bear that is very kind. The fact that he is bright pink also makes him stand out in a bear crowd! With some honey from Ohlala, he'll help by being the beast in the circus.
