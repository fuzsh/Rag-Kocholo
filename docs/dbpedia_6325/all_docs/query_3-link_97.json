        "text": "Sailing to the Caribbean with a dog can seem like an extremely difficult task. Each island has its own set of rules and regulations when it comes to checking in. The exact requirements are often hard to find or are not clear making the entire check-in process even more stressful.\n\nFirst thing is first, you need to come prepared. That means planning a few months ahead of your intended departure date. A full list of things you need to PREPARE to sail to the Caribbean with a dog can be found here. To summarize, your dog will need a current rabies vaccine, rabies titer test, DAPP vaccine (sometimes referred to as DHPP), Heartworm/parasite test, Lyme, Lepto, and Coronavirus vaccines. The biggest thing to remember is to plan in advance. The titer test can take weeks to receive results and it needs to be taken at least 30 days AFTER your dog’s rabies vaccine. Lyme and Lepto vaccines come in two doses, 2-3 weeks apart. PLAN, PLAN, PLAN!\n\nI am going to do my best to tell you exactly what is required for each country (based on my extensive online research) and our personal experience sailing to the Caribbean with a dog and checking into each country.\n\nThe Bahamas\n\nRequirements\n\nMust be 6 months or older\n\nMicrochipped\n\nVaccinated for Rabies (between 30 days and 10 months of arrival with the 1-year vaccine and between 30 days and 34 months with the 3-year vaccine)\n\nVaccinated for Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvovirus, Adenovirus, Coronavirus, and Leptospirosis.\n\nDeclared free of external and internal parasites\n\nHealth certificate issued within 48 hours of arrival with a signed IMP1(b) form\n\nValid import permit\n\n***Banned Breeds***\n\nPit Bull, Presa Canario, Cane Corso, American Bully, Staffordshire Terrier, and Dogo Argentino (any mixes of these breeds are also banned)\n\nOur Experience\n\nWe have brought our dog, Jetty, to the Bahamas more than five times now. The most lengthy part of the process is applying for the import permit. The Bahamas is one of the few countries that does not accept the application via email. It must be mailed and they will either mail the permit back to you or fax it for an extra $5. Recently a Bahamian by the name of Wellington has started his own business aiding in the time-consuming permit process. You can email your application to him and he will print it and bring it to the Department of Agriculture in Nassau personally. He will then email/fax the permit back to you in just a few days. We have had times where we waited for up to two months waiting on our permit to be mailed back so Wellington’s service is going to be a major game-changer. We have not personally used him yet but have read nothing but positive reviews. Click here to apply online using Wellingtons service.\n\nWhen the captain goes to check in make sure to bring all the paperwork mentioned above. The customs paperwork has a box that asks if you have an animal onboard. Out of the multiple times, we have ever checked in the agent only skims the paperwork we provide. Our health certificate has been up to two weeks old do to us waiting on favorable weather and again we have never been given any issues. I have heard of vets dating health certificates for expected departure dates. Ours would not but it is worth a try to ask.\n\nTurks and Caicos\n\nRequirements\n\nMicrochip\n\nVaccinated for rabies between 3 months and 12 months of arrival\n\nVaccinated for DAPP, Lepto and Lymes disease\n\nRabies Titer Test\n\nEndorsed health certificate issued within 10 days of arrival\n\nImport Permit\n\nTreated against internal and external parasites within 14 days of arrival\n\nOur experience\n\nWe could not get a vet appointment in the Bahamas within 10 days of our planned arrival for the Turks and Caicos. After hearing repeatedly that T&C is one of the strictest places to bring a pet we opted to sail straight through to the Dominican Republic which we had heard was much more lenient.\n\nSorry I cannot give you much help on this one!\n\nDominican Republic\n\nRequirements\n\nMicrochip\n\nVaccinated for Rabies between 30 days and 12 months of arrival.\n\nRabies Titer Test\n\nHealth Certificate endorsed by the USDA or local CFIA office issued within 10 days of arrival.\n\nOur experience:\n\nWe spent a few weeks sailing around the out islands of the Bahamas before heading to the Dominican Republic. We were unable to find a vet before we arrived so we risked the 2-month-old health certificate that we used to check into the Bahamas.\n\nOcean World Marina is known to make the check-in process easy because they had all agents on-site rather than having to track down the Navy, Customs and Immigration, and Drug Enforcement like you would have to in Luperon. The concierge spoke English and made checking in easy. No one asked to look at any paperwork for Jetty. However, when we checked out of Ocean World and got a despacho for Samana the Navy officer said that the customs agent in Samana might ask for it (they did not).\n\nPuerto Rico\n\nRequirements\n\nMicrochip\n\nVaccinated for Rabies within 6 months of arrival\n\nHealth certificate issued within 30 days of arrival\n\nOur Experience\n\nWe checked in using the ROAM App. While on the phone with the customs officer they asked if we had any pets on board. We said a dog, the officer then asked if we had paperwork. We answered yes and that was that.\n\nUSVI’s\n\nRequirements\n\nVaccinated for rabies within 6 months of arrival\n\nScrewworm inspection if arriving from certain countries (list of countries can be found here)\n\nHealth Certificate\n\nOur experience\n\nWe updated our location in the ROAM app and never had to talk to a customs agent. We did, however, visit Progressive Veterinary Hospital to get an updated health certificate for our upcoming trip to Grenada. Progressive got us in for an appointment last minute and was kind and professional. We opted not to spend the $250 to get the health certificate endorsed for our sail to Grenada. The non-endorsed international health certificate cost around $45.\n\nBVI’s\n\nRequirements\n\nMicrochip\n\nVaccinated for rabies at least twice and arrive within 12 months of the second shot\n\nVaccinated for DAPP, Leptospirosis, and Lyme disease\n\nImport permit (unless arriving from rabies controlled country)\n\nOur experience\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nAnguilla\n\nRequirements\n\nVaccinated for rabies within 30 days and 12 months of arrival\n\nEndorsed health certificate issued within 21 days of arrival\n\nImport permit (call 264-497-2615 to request a permit)\n\nOur Experience\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nSt. Martin (French)/St. Maarten (Dutch)\n\nRequirements\n\nMicrochip\n\nVaccinated for rabies (1-year and 3-year rabies vaccines are accepted)\n\nVaccinated for DAPP, Leptospirosis, and Coronavirus\n\nRabies Titer Test if coming from Central or South America\n\nHealth Certificate\n\nFree from internal and external parasites\n\nImport Permit\n\nOur Experience\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nI had a difficult time finding information about bringing a dog to the French side (St. Martin). From what I have heard it is very easy. You check-in via a computer similar to Martinique mentioned below. The Dutch side is known to be a bit more difficult with the requirement of the import permit and meeting a vet once checked in. We plan to only bring Jetty to the French side to simplify things.\n\nSt. Barthelemy\n\nRequirements\n\nVaccinated for rabies between 30 days and 12 months of arrival\n\nHealth certificate issued within 5 days of arrival\n\nOur Experience\n\nCOMING SOON\n\nSt. Kitts and Nevis\n\nRequirements\n\nMicrochip (number must be on all documents and implanted before rabies vaccine)\n\nVaccinated for rabies more than 30 days before arrival (1 and 3-year vaccines are accepted)\n\nTwo Rabies Titer Test between 30 day and 12 months of arrival\n\nHealth certificate issued within 30 days of arrival and another within 7 days of arrival\n\nImport Permit\n\nTreated for internal and external parasites within 72 hours of arrival\n\n30 days of at-home quarantine\n\nOur Experience\n\nUnfortunately, we have opted to skip St. Kitts and Nevis do to the two titer tests and home quarantine. We did not want to keep Jetty on the boat for 30 days. If you plan to visit here I suggest doing a bit more research. Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine has compiled a detailed checklist which would be a great resource if you are making this trip.\n\nMontserrat\n\nRequirements\n\nVaccinated for rabies between 30 days and 12 months\n\nHealth certificate issued within 72 hours of arrival\n\nImport Permit\n\nQuarantine of at least 4 months\n\nContact the Ministry of Agriculture to apply for a permit\n\nPhone:664-491-2070/2546\n\nEmail: malhe@gov.ms\n\nOur Experience\n\nNot worth it..\n\nAntigua/ Barbuda\n\nRequirements\n\nMicrochip\n\nVaccinated for rabies within 12 months\n\nRabies Titer Test unless coming from a rabies-free country\n\nEndorsed Health Certificate (must include results for Ehrlichia and Lyme’s Disease Testing)\n\nTick and tapeworm treatment within 7 days of arrival\n\nImport Permit\n\n***Banned Breeds***\n\nPitbulls are banned and any dog resembling a Pitbull must have a certificate from a recognized kennel club confirming the breed\n\nEmail all health records to vld@ab.gov.ag and request an import permit. You must inform the Veterinary & Livestock Division of your arrival at least 48 prior. You will be charged a Veterinary Inspection Fee US$50.00.\n\nOur Experience\n\nI never got a response to the emails I sent requesting an import permit. I called Dr. Tubal (Whatsapp +1 268 728 9030) 48 hours before our arrival and asked to make an appointment to clear our dog in. We arrived with all of Jetty’s health records and updated vaccines and were prepared to pay an extra fee if need be. We did not disclose to the vet that we did not receive an import permit. He met us at the customs dock in Jolly Harbour and he asked where our last port was, to see our personal/boat clearance paperwork, and a health certificate. He skimmed the paperwork, stamped our papers and requested $130 EC’s. He even referred to himself as “quick draw Mcgraw”. We have heard different stories when checking in with other vets on the island. I would highly suggest making your check-in appointment with Dr. Tubal.\n\nGuadeloupe\n\nRequirements\n\nMicrochip\n\nVaccinated against Rabies (1-year and 3-year vaccines are accepted)\n\nRabies Titer Test if entering from a high-rabies country\n\nEndorsed health certificate within 10 days of arrival\n\nOur experience\n\nIn Guadeloupe, you check in via a computer. There is a box to check if you have a dog but that is it. VERY EASY.\n\nDominica\n\nRequirments\n\nVaccinated for Rabies between 30 days and 12 months of arrival\n\nRabies Titer Test\n\nVaccinated for DAPP, Lepto, and Coronavirus\n\nHealth certificate\n\nImport Permit\n\nEmail health documents to forestvet@gmail.com and request an import permit.\n\nOur Experience\n\nI sent all of Jetty’s health documents to the email address listed above and received a response with the import permit attached a few days later. I asked if I needed to schedule a vet to meet us at check-in and they said they had officers at the port of entry to examine her. Roseau was our port of entry and Billy took our binder filled with our passports, boat paperwork, and Jetty’s documents to check-in. There was a spot to check if you had any animals on board and if they go to shore. He marked yes but no one asked to see the dog. He did not go out of his way to offer any extra info about us having a dog onboard. A few days into our visit we were walking her on a leash along the beach and a man came up to us aggressively asking if we had seen a vet. We answered yes…. because we had just seen the vet in Martinique. He did not seem pleased with the answer and continued staring. Worried we had done something wrong we went back to customs and asked about the check-in process. They said we DID need to make an appointment to see the vet. Later that night we had a vet come meet us and fill out yet ANOTHER health certificate and charge us $150 EC’s. He told us that he has eyes on the beach that keeps an eye out for dogs (sounds like the guy on the beach makes a commission). When I emailed asking “ Do we need to have a vet meet us when we check-in or are we good to go? and the Livestock Development Veterinary Services responded saying “We have officers at the port of entry, to examine dog on arrival”. I took that as we did not need to make an appointment but you DO need to give 24 hours notice so they can make sure someone is there to check the dog.\n\nMartinique\n\nRequirments\n\nMicrochip\n\nVaccinated for rabies at least 30 days before arrival\n\nRabies Titer Test (if coming from a high rabies country)\n\nHealth certificate\n\nOur Experience\n\nYou check into Martinique via a computer. There was a question asking if we had any pets and if so what kind. We marked a dog and no questions were asked. SUPER EASY.\n\nWhile in Martinique a few of Jetty’s shots needed to be updated and we also needed a health certificate for our next country. We made an appointment via email lesvetosdumarin@hotmail.com with Dr. Maximin in Le Marin (one of the very few English speaking vets in Martinique). He was very friendly, got us in and out quickly, and spoke very good English. We highly recommend him.\n\nSt. Lucia\n\nRequirements\n\nMicrochip\n\nVaccinated for rabies between 30 days and 12 months\n\nVaccinated for DAPP and Lepto within 14 days of arrival\n\nRabies Titer Test\n\nEndorsed health certificate\n\nTreated with tick and tapeworm treatment within 14 days of arrival\n\nImport permit\n\nEmail permit to vlsdsec.agriculture@govt.lc and chiefvlsd@govt.lc\n\nPhone: 1-758-468-5621 or 1-758-450-3764\n\nOur Experience\n\nI filled out the import permit application about three weeks in advance. I sent two follow up emails and received the permit 2 weeks later. The veterinary officer wanted details about our arrival port and when we planned to arrive so we could make arrangments for them to inspect Jetty on arrival ($45EC). We actually ended up skipping St. Lucia because of time constraints but everything seemed pretty straight forward and we plan to make it a point to stop next time we are in the islands.\n\nSt. Vincent and the Grenadines\n\nThis is one country that had me awfully confused. Many sources online state that a 6-month quarantine in Europe is required. We had heard so many amazing things about the Grenadines and wanted desperately to be able to stop. I did a bit more digging and found updated requirements thanks to an article by Liesbet Collaert published on caribbeancompass.com.\n\nRequirments\n\nMicrochip\n\nVaccinated against rabies\n\nRabies Titer Test\n\nVaccinated against DAPP\n\nGovernment Issued Export Health Certificate (from a Rabies Free Country),\n\nTreatment for internal and external parasites.\n\nImport Permit\n\nYou must request the import permit from the veterinary department via phone (784) 450-0326 or 457-2452 or email (animalhealthsvg@hotmail.com). Once you fill in the required information email the application back with your dog health records. You will then need an export health certificate from a rabies-free country (St. Lucia is the closest island with this status). You must give the government vet office 48 hours notice upon your arrival. They will schedule an appointment to have a vet come inspect your dog at the Young Island Ferry Dock and issue your import permit.\n\nOur Experience:\n\nThe issue we ran into was that we were coming from Grenada which means we would have had to sail over 100 miles out of the way to St. Lucia to get the export health certificate and then backtrack another 100 miles to island-hop up the Grenadines. We talked to many other sailors coming from the south and they recommended to gather all your updated paperwork and have all vaccines up to date, check into Clifton on Union Island and check that you had a dog on the clearance paperwork. If no one asked any more info do not offer it. They recommended to keep your walks to beaches and not in any towns. We did just that and did not have any issues. We always keep photos of paperwork on our phones just in case! If anyone were to give us any issues about not having an import permit we were prepared to leave. Luckily that did not happen because we LOVED the Grenadines 🙂\n\nGrenada\n\nRequirements\n\nVaccinated for Rabies, DAPP, and Leptospirosis within 12months of arrival\n\nHealth certificate issued within 2 weeks of arrival\n\nImport permit\n\nEmail import application to grenadalivestock@gmail.com\n\nOur experience\n\nWe applied for the import permit about three weeks in advance and did not hear back whether we were approved or not for over two weeks. I finally called to see what the issue was and they must have just missed my application… After speaking with them on the phone I had the permit we needed within a few hours. While checking in there was a question whether we had a dog onboard. We checked yes but the officer never asked to look at papers. We did meet another sailor who had issues importing his pitbull. He had the dog tied up outside the customs office while he was checking in. After two weeks of only being allowed to let the dog out at night, the officers realized how nice the dog was and allowed him to be taken out whenever. If you want to avoid issues like this I would suggest leaving the dog on the boat until the captain has successfully checked in (technically that is the law anyway).\n\nMany different countries make up the eastern Caribbean. At first, bringing a dog to the Caribbean can seem like a nightmare. However, with plenty of research and a few vet appointments here and there 😉 it is definitely doable. While I was planning to bring our dog sailing in the Caribbean with us I was confused, stressed, and nervous. I hope all of this information helps you feel a little more comfortable than I did.\n\nHave fun on your trip and thanks for reading!\n\n~Sierra"
