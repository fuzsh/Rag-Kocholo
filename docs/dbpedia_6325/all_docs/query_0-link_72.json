But it is just the newer to the riiddle you need, you don't have to find it or anything(there is no nail to find in dog island gam)\n\nIs is normal for cats to like to be spanked?\n\nNo, it is not usual for cats to enjoy being spanked. Physical discipline can be perceived as threatening or frightening to cats, and can harm the bond between you and your cat. It is important to find positive and non-physical ways to interact with your cat to build a trusting relationship.\n\nWhere can you find metal ore on sims2 castaway?\n\nYou need the right tool but you can find it in the dark cave on airplane island (second island) and at Volcano Submit on Volcano Island (third island)."
