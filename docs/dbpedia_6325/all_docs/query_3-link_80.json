        "text": "Valid Sep. 1, 2024 through Aug. 31, 2025.\n\nGood Fishing Depends on Clean Water\n\nHarmful algae blooms can affect fishing spots, creating “dead zones” where no aquatic life can survive. The cause is usually pollution from fertilizers, septic systems, animal waste, and sewage treatment plants. Learn more at Nutrient Pollution. Supporting water quality protection supports great fishing!\n\nKills and Spills Team\n\nTo report saltwater or freshwater fish kills, please contact the Kills and Spills Team (KAST) at (512) 389-4848.\n\nFishing License Requirements\n\nAny person who takes or attempts to take fish, mussels, clams, crayfish or other aquatic life in the public waters of Texas must have a current Texas fishing license with the appropriate endorsement. A saltwater endorsement is required to fish in coastal waters; a freshwater endorsement is required for inland waters. For details and exceptions, see license fees and packages.\n\nNote: A hunting license is required to hunt non-protected turtles and frogs.\n\nGame Fish\n\nIncludes hybrids and subspecies of listed fish.

See additional information regarding seagrass regulations.\n\ntransport live, nongame fishes taken from:\n\nthe Red River and all tributary waters in Grayson, Fannin, Lamar, Red River, and Bowie counties below Lake Texoma downstream to the Arkansas border,\n\nBig Cypress Bayou downstream of Ferrell’s Bridge Dam on Lake O’ the Pines (including the Texas waters of Caddo Lake), or\n\nthe Sulphur River downstream of the Lake Wright Patman dam.\n\n(Nongame fishes collected from these waters may be used as live bait on the water bodies where they were collected.)\n\nintentionally or unintentionally possess or transport aquatic invasive species without a permit; see “Possession and Transport of Exotic Aquatic Species.\n\nuse any game fish or part of a game fish as bait.\n\nTagging Fish\n\nAlthough it is legal to place an identification tag (use caution as tags can damage fish) on the exterior of a fish and release it back into public waters, it is unlawful to release a fish with a device or substance implanted or attached to produce an audible, visual, or electronic signal used to monitor, track, follow, or in any manner aid in locating it.\n\nWaste of Fish\n\nIt is unlawful to leave edible fish or bait fish taken from the public waters of the state to die without the intent to retain the fish for consumption or bait.\n\nBait Regulations\n\nThere are several regulations that apply to bait:\n\nIt is unlawful to use any game fish or part of a game fish as bait.\n\nLive fish, including personally caught live bait, cannot be transported from the water body where the fish were caught in or aboard a vessel in water from the water body where the fish were caught.\n\nTransport and use of commercially purchased live bait in water while fishing from a vessel is allowed, provided persons in possession of the bait have a receipt that identifies the source of the bait. Any live bait purchased from a location on or adjacent to public water body that is transported in water from that water body can only be used as bait on that same water body.\n\nIf using dead or live shrimp, whole or in pieces, only the use of shrimp native to the Gulf of Mexico may be used in Texas waters. If using frozen shrimp from a grocery store, be sure to check the package - if it is imported from another country, it may not be used.\n\nSome counties have specific bait fish regulations, know where you are fishing and the local regulations.\n\nSpecial Areas and Restrictions\n\nIt is a violation to move, remove, deface, alter, or destroy any sign, depth marker, or other informational signage placed by the department within, or to delineate boundaries of the Redfish Bay State Scientific Area.\n\nIt is a violation to anchor or moor a vessel, barge, or structure for a period exceeding two consecutive days within the area in Cedar Bayou between a department sign erected where Mesquite Bay flows into Cedar Bayou and the department sign erected near the point where the pass empties in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIt is a violation to leave unattended for any period of time or anchor a barge, boat, or fishing platform in the Trinity River below Livingston Dam in an area 1,000 feet from the dam to a point 1,500 feet downstream from the dam:\n\nfor more than 10 hours in a 24-hour period without moving 100 feet or more during that time, or\n\nfor five or more consecutive days, whether or not it has been moved;\n\nPortions of the Rio Grande adjacent to the Black Gap Wildlife Management Area are designated as a \"Wild and Scenic River.\" Special federal rules apply to fishing, boating and other uses in these areas. Check the Big Bend National Park website for more information concerning these rules and boundaries.\n\nPossession of Fish Taken from Public Water\n\nFish caught and immediately released are not considered to be in possession. Any fish that are retained by using any type of holding device such as stringer, cooler, livewell, or bucket are considered in an angler’s possession and must adhere to established length and bag limits. While fishing, it is illegal to be in possession of more fish than the daily bag limit or fish that are within a protected length limit.\n\nIn order to verify length and species, a fish caught may not have the head or tail removed and may not be filleted until an angler finally lands the catch on the mainland, a peninsula, or barrier island not including jetties or piers and does not transport the catch by boat. For broadbill swordfish and king mackerel, the head or tail may be removed but the remainder of the carcass must remain intact and may not be filleted. For sharks, only the head may be removed. The remainder of the carcass (including the tail) must remain intact and may not be filleted.\n\nAny fish taken from public water and landed by boat or person in Texas must adhere to the length limits and daily bag and possession limits established for those fish in Texas regardless of the state or country in which they were caught.\n\nThe bag limit for a guided fishing party is equal to the total number of persons in the boat licensed to fish or otherwise exempt from holding a license minus each fishing guide and fishing guide deckhand multiplied by the bag limit for each species harvested.\n\nTransfer and Importation of Wildlife and Aquatic Resources\n\nA person may give or receive any legally taken wildlife or aquatic resource, or part of the resource, that is required to be tagged or that is protected by a daily bag / possession limit if the resource is accompanied by a Wildlife Resource Document (WRD). A person may use the downloadable form or a handwritten document that includes the same required information. A properly executed WRD must accompany the resource until it reaches the possessor’s permanent residence or a cold storage/processing facility, except no WRD is required if a person receiving the wildlife resource does not exceed the possession limit (or bag limit if in the field) and is lawfully licensed or possesses the applicable license.\n\nIt is unlawful to import a wildlife or aquatic resource into this state or possess a resource taken outside this state unless:\n\nthe person possesses a valid hunting, fishing, or other applicable license, endorsement, tag, permit, or document for the state or country in which the resource was legally taken; and\n\na person produces, upon request of a game warden, a valid driver’s license or personal identification certificate.\n\nA person may possess an animal legally obtained outside of Texas that is listed as threatened or endangered in Texas if they have proof that the animal was lawfully obtained. Proof consists of bill-of-sale, license tag, permit or notarized affidavit.\n\nImports from Mexico\n\nThe requirements listed above are waived if a United States Customs Officer’s Statement is obtained from the United States Customs Office at the port of entry showing that the wildlife resource was brought in from Mexico. The Customs Officer’s statement must accompany the wildlife resource to its final destination."
