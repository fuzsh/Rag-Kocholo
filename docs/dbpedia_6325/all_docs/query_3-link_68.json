        "text": "Lean-to's\n\nA lean-to is a 3-sided structure that can accommodate up to 8 people. They shelter campers from wind and rain, keep gear dry and kids will love to use them as a stage for performances. Each site comes with a fire ring (or fireplace) with grill and a picnic table.\n\nTent placement in a lean-to: There are several ways to handle tent placement in or around a lean-to site. One way is not to use a tent at all and just set up your sleeping pads and bag inside the lean-to. Some campers use mosquito netting in the lean-to's to keep out the bugs.\n\nOther campers will set up their tents inside the lean-to. This keeps them dry and out of the wind.\n\nStill other campers will use the lean-to to store gear and food, and set up their tents outside. This allows the lean-to itself to become more of a kitchen, a living room, the game room, or just a common area.\n\nLean-to dimensions: (most lean-tos)\n\nFloor is 13'4\" wide, 9'3\" deep\n\nFront opening is 7'5\" inches high, 13'4\" wide\n\nThe lowest height (at the back of the lean-to) is 4'3\"\n\nChanging Reservations\n\nChanging camping reservations: If you wish to change your reservation after it has been made, you may do so at no cost, providing you keep the same number of nights and sites. The reservation may be moved to different dates or to a different park, within the current camping season. Changes must be made by 2:00 p.m. the day prior to your original arrival date. Changes made after that time will be considered a cancellation and rebooking.\n\nReducing number of nights: If you reduce the number of nights on an existing reservation it is considered a cancellation and rebook. You will lose your original $8 non-refundable reservation fee and there will be a $10 cancellation fee per site. You will also incur an additional $8 reservation fee, per site, for your new, reduced-nights reservation.\n\nCancellation Policy\n\nTent/RV sites, lean-to and cabin cancellations: If you cancel your reservation prior to 2:00 p.m. on the day before your expected arrival date, you are entitled to a refund of all fees except a $10 cancellation fee and your $8 reservation fee paid, per site.\n\nIf you cancel after 2:00 p.m. on the day before your expected arrival date or if you come camping and need to leave prior to the end of your stay, you can receive a refund for the unused portion (except for the required minimum), per site, if you notify the park staff before departing. No refunds will be issued for an unused portion of the required minimum reservation period. If you are charged for the minimum number of nights that were in effect when you made your reservation, then the cancellation fee will not be charged. There are no refunds for 1-night reservations.\n\nCottage cancellations: If you cancel your cottage reservation 30 days or more prior to your expected arrival date, you will receive a full refund less a $10 cancellation fee and your $8 reservation fee paid. If you cancel 14 - 30 days prior to your expected arrival date, you will receive a full refund less the equivalent of a two night stay; if you cancel less than 14 days prior to your expected arrival date, you will receive no refund.\n\nNo Shows: If you need to arrive later than your expected start date, please notify park staff by calling the park. If you donât show after your 2nd night of expected arrival and do not contact the park, your reservation will be cancelled, and no refund will be issued.\n\nLocations\n\nBurton Island State Park: In addition to a developed campground, Burton Island, on St. Albans Bay on Lake Champlain has 4 remote tent sites on the south side of the island, away from the developed camping area, office and park store.
