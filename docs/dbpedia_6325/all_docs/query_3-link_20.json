        "text": "Pliers or a band applicator can be used to apply bird bands. We encourage you to be consistent by banding the same foot on all birds (left or right). Put the band on the bird so it is upright and the numbers are easy to read.\n\nWhen you are banding your birds, ensure that you butt the band edges up together and evenly. Do not overlap or misalign the band which may cause unnecessary discomfort or injury to the bird.\n\nBird bands are sold in increments of 10 bands for $1.00. Contact the DNR at 515-725-8200 to place your order by phone. We accept Visa, Mastercard or Discover.\n\nBand sizes available: Quail, Pigeon (also used for Chukar), Pheasant (also used for Duck)\n\nPen-raised game birds of either sex may be used and shot in the training of bird dogs. Birds must be purchased from a certified game breeder and purchasing paperwork must be on your person while training to show that the birds were lawfully purchased. All pen-raised game birds used in dog training must be banded.\n\nIn general, all hunters need a valid hunting license and habitat fee to train a bird dog on wild and pen-raised game birds. An Iowa Migratory Bird Fee and Federal Waterfowl Stamp are required if using pen-raised waterfowl.\n\nIf you have a dog entered in a licensed field trial, you do not need any type of Hunting License to participate in the event or to exercise your dog on the area on which the field trial is to be held during the 24-hour period preceding the trial. See the section titled \"Dog Restrictions\" in the current hunting regulations booklet. If you are dog training on your own private land, you do not need a hunting license nor habitat fee.\n\nA dog can be trained year round, with the following restrictions:\n\nNo dogs are allowed on all state-owned game management areas between March 15 and July 15 of each year, except on designated training areas. In addition, only a pistol, revolver, or other gun shooting blanks shall be used while training during the closed season on public ground.\n\nDuring the closed season on public ground, only a pistol, revolver, or other gun shooting blanks can be used while training using wild game birds.\n\nDuring the open season on public and private ground, it is not necessary to use blanks if training dogs on wild game birds.\n\nIf using pen-raised birds from a license game breeder for dog training, birds may be shot year-round. Keep in mind that dogs are not allowed on state-owned wildlife management areas between March 15 and July 15 of each year, except on designated training areas.\n\nBanded, pen-raised birds can be released for dog training on public property. Birds can be planted and retrieved with a call back pen, or planted and shot using live ammunition. If planting banded, pen-raised birds for dog training, keep your purchase receipt with you to show birds used in training have been purchased from a certified game breeder.\n\nNo dogs are allowed on all state-owned wildlife management areas between March 15 and July 15 of each year, except on designated training areas.\n\nA special events permit must be obtained from the DNR for field and retriever meets. Field and retriever meets are restricted to designated sites. The permit shall show the exact designated site of the meet and all dogs shall be confined to that site per Iowa Code 481A.22.\n\nVisit the Iowa Special Events website to schedule a field trial event or view scheduled trials on public lands: https://programs.iowadnr.gov/specialevents/"
