        "text": "\"We should be golden\"\n\nShaw’s water taxi can shuttle in groceries cheaper than a plane can, but it’s still a three hour boat ride to Port Hardy, the closest large town.\n\nThat’s not always feasible, and it shouldn’t be necessary. The Wuikinuxv’s primary grocery store really should be the water beneath the boat.\n\n“Living where we do, we should be golden,” says Shaw, who previously directed marine use planning and stewardship for the Nation. “There should be no problems growing and harvesting our own food and living practically off-the-grid.”\n\nThe funding doesn’t just increase capacity for stewardship programs; it can transform their scope from reactive outreach to the proactive, holistic First Nation-led stewardship they were always meant to be.\n\n“We're able to look at these dollars and go, ‘Where can we really make this money work as hard as it can possibly work based on the information that we have at hand, the resources we have at hand, the people we have at hand,” says Shaw.\n\n“And we can really get out there and make the most impact that we possibly can within our territories, which then feeds into the larger ocean, which then feeds into global targets of 30x30. And so, any work that we do ultimately impacts the rest of British Columbia, Canada and the world.”\n\nFirst Nations of the region, including Smith’s community, didn’t settle for protection that ended at the water’s edge. They kept leading towards their vision of sweeping protection across land and sea.\n\nTo make the eventual marine deal the best it could be, First Nations continued to invest in the success of the Rainforest PFP, gaining valuable lessons and confidence along the way.\n\nWith that confidence, as Smith described at the 2024 launch of the Great Bear Sea PFP, “people started investing in our dreams as Indigenous People of self-determination and reconciliation.”\n\nAnother huge benefit of the original Rainforest PFP, as Shaw points out, was that First Nations grew their collaborative muscles.\n\n“The relationships that were built amongst the Nations have really been what’ve brought us to today.”\n\nPermanence is a return to balance for food chain-sustaining habitats like eelgrass, spongebeds and kelp forests so that nutritent-dense eulachon fish can run up the inlets of the Wuikinuxv and other First Nations once again.\n\nAnd less reliance on $30 bags of potatoes.\n\n\"We're always playing the long game,” says Shaw. “When we when we talk about ‘long term sustainable,’ we're not talking about ten years. We're talking about a hundred.”\n\nAnd in a game where a seamless ecosystem of sea and rainforest sees renewed health and restored balance, the whole world wins."
