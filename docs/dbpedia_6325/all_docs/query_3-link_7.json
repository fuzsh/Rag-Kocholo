        "text": "Table of Contents\n\nYour Scent List is located in the Memo section of the menu. The Scent List keeps all the scents you learn throughout the game and tracks your percentage to completion. There are 274 scents found in the game, in six different categories. The main reason for collecting scents is to gain the level of Sniff Master, which is required for completing the game. The level ups in the game are based on how many scents you know and each level rewards you with more hearts.\n\nLevel Name Hearts Sniff Apprentice 0 scents 3 Sniff Artisan 20 scents 4 Sniff Expert 50 scents 5 Sniff Master 100 scents 7 Grand Sniff Master 150 scents 10\n\nAnother reason to learn scents is to make finding different items easier. Some items consist of a composite of two other scents, and if you know both base scents, you can learn the main one. This is helpful when you get a mission asking you to find an item, because you can immediately start sniffing it out instead of having to find its composite scents. If you don't know the combination scents at the time you are asked to find something, you learn the scent either when you find the combo scents or when you find the item.\n\nYou can learn scents by digging up Flowers, Food, Special Items or Tools. To learn Fish and Bug scents, you must either fish for them or catch them in a Bug Cage, respectively. You also learn a scent when another dog teaches it to you, or when you receive an item either from another dog or in the mail. Check the Notes section at the bottom for more information on when letters with items inside arrive.\n\nFood[edit | edit source]\n\nFood can be sniffed out and dug up in wild areas. There are two categories of Food in the Collector book: fruits and vegetables. The Food Collector's name is Darna, and she is in the Restaurant in Pupsville. The Special Items, such as Hippo or Elephant Food, are shown using Food items, although you have to find the specific Special Item; you can't just try and use Spinach for instance during Jumping the Hippo.\n\nPicture Name Description Locations Apple A tasty red fruit.\n\nTreely Woods\n\nApple Pear A very juicy, sweet fruit.\n\nWest Chilly Field\n\nRune Caverns\n\nApricot A yellow fruit that can also be used to make fruit wine.\n\nKunka Ruins\n\nBanana A sweet, yellow tropical fruit.\n\nSouth Sandy Desert\n\nBlueberry A fruit that is good for your eyes.\n\nDry Valley\n\nRune Canyon\n\nCabbage A green vegetable with leaves that form a cluster.\n\nGreen Meadows\n\nCarrot An orange vegetable that horses like to eat.\n\nEast Chilly Field\n\nRune Canyon\n\nCherry A small, red and round-shaped fruit.\n\nHoya Plains\n\nChestnut A brown nut surrounded by a spiky crust.\n\nRune Canyon\n\nCucumber A long and green crispy vegetable.\n\nChiro Caves\n\nDurian A strong smelling fruit known as the King of Fruits.\n\nRune Canyon\n\nEggplant A shiny purple vegetable.\n\nWest Chilly Field\n\nGrapefruit A yellow-skinned citrus fruit.\n\nGreen Meadows\n\nGrape A small, round-shaped purple fruit.\n\nGreen Meadows\n\nGreen Apple A green fruit.\n\nZoomy Lake\n\nGreen Grape A very sweet type of grapefruit.\n\nGola Highlands\n\nFig A red fruit that is good for your skin.\n\nChiro Caves\n\nKiwi A fruit with green and white colors inside.\n\nHoya Plains\n\nLemon A very sour-tasting yellow fruit.\n\nRune Caverns\n\nLettuce A green, crispy leaf vegetable used in salads.\n\nZoomy Lake\n\nLitchee A juicy red fruit.\n\nKunka Ruins\n\nMango An orange tropical fruit.\n\nNorth Sandy Desert\n\nMangosteen A tropical fruit shaped like an egg.\n\nKunka Ruins\n\nMelon A green, round-shaped fruit.\n\nGola Highlands\n\nEast Chilly Field\n\nOrange A sweet and sour orange.\n\nTreely Woods\n\nPapaya A fruit that has itty-bitty seeds inside.\n\nDry Valley\n\nPassion Fruit A very intensely red-colored fruit.\n\nNorth Sandy Desert\n\nPeach A pink juicy fruit.\n\nEast Chilly Field\n\nPear A green fruit shaped like a lightbulb.\n\nChiro Caves\n\nPersimmon This fruit can taste either sweet or bitter.\n\nEast Chilly Field\n\nPineapple A sour tropical fruit with pointed leaves.\n\nRune Canyon\n\nPomegranate A fruit that has small red seeds.\n\nDry Valley\n\nPotato A popular source of delicious chips.\n\nSouth Sandy Desert\n\nWest Chilly Field\n\nEast Chilly Field\n\nPumpkin An orange squash fruit.\n\nTreely Woods\n\nSpinach A nutritious vegetable with a dark green color.\n\nHoya Plains\n\nStar Fruit A rare fruit that is shaped like a star.\n\nRune Caverns\n\nRune Canyon\n\nStrawberry A small fruit that grows in the winter.\n\nWest Chilly Field\n\nSweet Potato A sweet vegetable that's great for a quick snack.\n\nSouth Sandy Desert\n\nTomato A lovely red food that might be a vegetable.\n\nGola Highlands\n\nWatermelon A large, round-shaped fruit that grows in the summer.\n\nZoomy Lake\n\nFlowers[edit | edit source]\n\nFlowers are found in wild areas by sniffing them out and digging them up. Flowers come in two categories per the Flower Collector book, flowers that bloom in either hot or cold seasons. At only 22 flowers, the Flower Collector book is the smallest by far with the next largest book having almost twice as many items. The Flower Collector's name is Cherry and her house is the south-westernmost one in Pupsville. Occasionally, one of the Special Items is really a flower with a different name, such as the Yellow Flower, which uses the Sunflower picture. If you don't feel like hunting down flowers in different areas, all flowers can be found in the Ancient Grove. They are also almost always on top of actual flowers in the game (e.g. opposite the entrance to Pupsville in Treely Woods, you can find some Lavender amidst the Lavender in the scenery).\n\nPicture Name Description Locations Amaryllis Flower A beautiful lily flower.\n\nNorth Sandy Desert\n\nAncient Grove\n\nAzalea Flower A light pink flower shaped like a fan.\n\nWest Chilly Field\n\nAncient Grove\n\nBougainvillaea Flower A flower that is flimsy and delicate as paper.\n\nSouth Sandy Desert\n\nAncient Grove\n\nChrysanthemum An autumn flower with many petals.\n\nChiro Caves\n\nAncient Grove\n\nCosmos Flower A pretty flower that grows in Autumn.\n\nKunka Ruins\n\nAncient Grove\n\nDandelion A yellow flower that has many fluffy seeds.\n\nWest Chilly Field\n\nAncient Grove\n\nGeranium Flower A red flower with a citrus and rosy aroma.\n\nRune Canyon\n\nAncient Grove\n\nHibiscus A tropical flower with beautiful colors.\n\nSouth Sandy Desert\n\nAncient Grove\n\nHyacinth Flower A white flower that looks like a trumpet.\n\nHoya Plains\n\nAncient Grove\n\nHydrangea Flower Blooms with many flowers in the shape of a ball.\n\nNorth Sandy Desert\n\nChiro Caves\n\nAncient Grove\n\nLavender A purple flower with a relaxing aroma.\n\nTreely Woods\n\nAncient Grove\n\nLily A beautiful white flower.\n\nGola Highlands\n\nAncient Grove\n\nMorning Glory A purple flower that blossoms in the morning.\n\nZoomy Lake\n\nAncient Grove\n\nOrchid A gorgeous flower with many different species.\n\nGola Highlands\n\nAncient Grove\n\nPansy A flower with two colors.\n\nEast Chilly Field\n\nAncient Grove\n\nPeony Flower A red flower which is the state flower of Indiana.\n\nGreen Meadows\n\nAncient Grove\n\nRose A passionate red-colored flower.\n\nHoya Plains\n\nAncient Grove\n\nRosemary A small flower that has a strong smell.\n\nZoomy Lake\n\nAncient Grove\n\nSunflower A large yellow flower that is shaped like the sun.\n\nTreely Woods\n\nAncient Grove\n\nTulip A flower that has large petals.\n\nGreen Meadows\n\nAncient Grove\n\nViolet A dark and mysterious purple flower.\n\nEast Chilly Field\n\nAncient Grove\n\nWinter Cherry A flower with a paper like leaf covering its fruit.\n\nDry Valley\n\nAncient Grove\n\nFish[edit | edit source]\n\nFor more details on fishing, see the Fish Collector page.\n\nFish are found by fishing off of piers in certain areas. You learn how to fish during Fishing and that is also where you receive your Fishing Rod. Besides learning scents, there are certain times in the game when you are required to fish. These can be for missions, such as Fishing for Marlin and Challenge with Kurtis!, to place on altars in Kunka Ruins, or to send back home to your mom.\n\nThe Fish Collector's name is Dougal, and he stays in the left-hand room in Noble's house in Pupsville. The Fish Collector book is split into four categories: small freshwater fish, small seawater fish, large freshwater fish, and large seawater fish. The Fish Collector won't be available to take your fish until you complete Bee Problems, so doing a lot of fishing when you first get to The Dog Island may result in you running out of room in your inventory. To get 100% completion on the Fish Collector book, you have to complete The Marlin Bait to get the Marlin Bait, so that you can catch the Marlin.\n\nFor more information on when you receive letters requesting fish from you, see the Notes below.\n\nPicture Scent Name Item Name Alaska Pollock Alaska Pollack Albacore Albacore Ancient Fish Ancient Fish Anglerfish Anglerfish Black Bass Black Bass Black Carp Black Carp Blue Gill Blue Gill Blue Minnow Blue Fish Bonito Bonito Bowfin Bowfin Carp Carp Cat Fish Cat Fish Danube Salmon Japanese Huchen Dragonfish Arowana Eel Eel Garfish Gar Fish Goatfish Goatfish Goby Fish Brown Fish Grass Carp Grass Carp Gray Mullet Fish Silver Fish Grunter Yellow Striped Fish Herring Herring Hoki Hoki Kingfish King Fish Kokanee Salmon Kokanee Salmon Lady Fish Yellow Back Fish Marbled Lungfish Marbled Lungfish Marlin Marlin Merluza Fish Merluza Fish Minnow White Fish Northern Snakehead Northern Snakehead Pacific Saury Pacific Saury Paradise Fish Paradise Fish Pirarucu Pirarucu Pollock White Striped Fish Pond Smelt Pond Smelt Red Seabream Red Seabream Righteye Flounder Righteye Flounder River Trout River Trout Salmon Salmon Sardine Sardine Scabbard Fish Scabbard Fish Sea Bass Sea Bass Sole Sole Stonefish Stonefish Tiger Rockfish Tiger Rockfish Tilapia Yellow Scale Fish Wahoo Wahoo Yellowjack Yellow Jack Yellowtail Kingfish Yellowtail Kingfish\n\nBugs[edit | edit source]\n\nFor more details on catching bugs, see the Bug Collector page.\n\nYou can begin to catch bugs once you receive the Bug Cage for completing Challenge with Clark!. Bugs are found in the wild areas by running up to them and pressing when the \"Catch\" command appears. Besides catching bugs to learn scents, a couple of them are also used in making new products with Hope in Malshige's Shop in Pupsville. You also receive a butterfly in the mail from your sibling.\n\nThe Bug Collector's name is Derrick and he is located in Noble's house in Pupsville. The Bug Collector book is split into four sections: bugs with beautiful wings, bugs that flies straight, hard shelled bugs that live on trees, and bugs that live on grasses and flowers. Bugs are not found in snowy, desert or dry regions, and there is a complicated random setup system that determines when bugs appear. The exception is in Chiro Caves, which contains only one bug, the Black Swallowtail Butterfly.\n\nPicture Name Asian Dragonfly Asian Ladybug Atlas Beetle Bell Cricket Birdwing Butterfly Black Ladybug Black Swallowtail Butterfly Brimstone Butterfly Brown Scissors Beetle Brown Wing Cicada Cabbage Butterfly Chestnut Tiger Butterfly Common Eggfly Butterfly Common Hawker Dragonfly Common Skimmer Dragonfly Cricket Elephant Beetle Emperor Beetle Giant Grasshopper Giant Stag Beetle Grasshopper Great Orange Tip Butterfly Green-banded Swallowtail Green Scissors Beetle Green Eyed Dragonfly Green Head Cicada Goliath Birdwing Butterfly Hercules Beetle King Stag Beetle Large Cicada Large Head Cicada Lesser Emperor Dragonfly Little Stag Beetle Monarch Butterfly Morpho Butterfly Piggy Back Grasshopper Purple Spotted Swallowtail Red Dragonfly Red Wing Dragonfly Rhinoceros Beetle Sevenspotted Ladybug Short Horn Rhinoceros Beetle Swallowtail Butterfly Trojanus Butterfly Turtle Back Ladybug White Butterfly White Wing Cicada White Wing Dragonfly Yellow Butterfly Yellow Ladybug\n\nSpecial Items[edit | edit source]\n\nSpecial Items make up the bulk of your Scent List, and are central to the game as the objects of most Diary entries. The scent of a Special Item is usually taught to you by another dog so that you can go find it for them. In most cases you won't get the actual item until later when you dig it up or get it in some other manner. Some Special Items are scents only; you never take physical possession of the item. A different scent meter is also used for Special Items as opposed to normal ones, either one with blue proximity markers or purple proximity markers if you are following a scent trail.\n\nPicture Scent Name Item Name Description Acquired Apprentice's Ring Apprentice's Ring A Pass necessary to enter Rode's dojo.
