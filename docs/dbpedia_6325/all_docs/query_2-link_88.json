        "text": "INKTOBER 2022\n\nPosted by Tinet on November 7, 2022 · Leave a Comment\n\nIn a new record for me, I did a total of three (3) posts for Inktober 2022! I was going to do more, but stuff and thangs happened. V`(oo)´V\n\nCoral necklaces (real and fake) used to be a thing in the 80s. I mixed it up with several different prompt lists again for this year’s Inktober, and this one was for #facetober day 1: “coral, red hair, sunglasses” – which of course made me think of Eva ♥\n\nAgain with just the lineart:\n\nOrion as I saw it (him?!) at night in Galičica National Park in Macedonia, with zero light pollution. It blew my mind! There is literally the outline of his face and bow. The temperatures dropped below zero and we weren’t really prepared for that, but this was absolutely worth it.\n\nThis one was for #artober by thainaaraujoe, day 2: “pick a constellation”\n\nThen, finally, #facetober day 9: “royal, curly hair, blooms”\n\nShannon (from Driftwood and Dog Island) may be the closest of my main characters to any sort of royalty (some kind of pirate royalty!), has curly hair, and is sitting in front of some tiger lilies :3\n\nMaybe I should have been arsed at some point to connect my drawing tablet for the colouring, instead of doing it with my mouse like it’s 2001 …\n\nAnd just the lineart:\n\nWell, I’d planned on doing all the main characters from Driftwood/Dog Island like this, but it didn’t happen this time … Maybe next October I’ll draw more :3 (It’ll be hard not to beat ’22 for sure xD)\n\nInktober 2021\n\nPosted by Tinet on December 6, 2021 · Leave a Comment\n\nMy inktober this year was definitely less quantity, but perhaps more quality?\n\nAs usual I switched between several prompt lists. Starting off with #goretober2021 day 1: Bruises (Eva and Ting Yay edition ♥)\n\n#inktoberrussia2021 2. день: По ту сторону реки (On the other side of the river)\n\nThis is a remake of a sketch I made in 2016 when my life was pretty shit and I was frustrated that my art reflected that (not surprisingly). Today I kind of wish I would have just gone for it and created lots more of depressing, desolate and brilliant art.\n\n#wartober2021 day 3: “Mask on” (Andrei from my piggy book Sweet Peas)\n\n#inktober2021 day 4: Knot (stomach in knots)\n\nMy stomach was indeed in knots on that day about a couple of things (as far as I remember: some bureaucracy shit and a writing project), but eventually I succeeded in everything and all was okay. ^^\n\n#retrotober2021 day 5: Stars (Wilie from Driftwood/Dog Island gazing at the unfamiliar constellations)\n\n#inkhoteeditions 2021 day 6: Chez moi (at home), in a parallel universe where I moved into a two room flat on the 13th floor. I could have done just that, but it wouldn’t have been ideal for my doggie. Instead I got another very nice flat that is very much ideal for my doggie. ♥\n\nThen a skip ahead to the 10th, which was my princess Mitsu’s 27th birthday. She was such a tiny baby and I always tend to chibify my drawings of her if I don’t watch out.\n\nSeveral prompts were suitable for celebrating Mitsu’s memory:\n\n#majasbokdraw2021 day 10: My dream pet\n\n#blacktober_zetta day 10: Mythical Beast\n\n#inkhoteeditions day 10: Anniversaire\n\n… maybe also #gristober2021 day 10: Resurrect? …\n\nIt’s a fun challenge to associate freely with the prompts. I can keep up with it best if I can maintain a fixed inktober routine, but anything upsetting the routine and pulling me out of the mindset (like a comics festival early on right in the middle of it, as happened this year) can be disastrous. ^^;"
