        "text": "Camping is for the dogs, and we mean that in the best way possible. According to The Dyrt’s 2024 Camping Report presented by The All-New Toyota Tacoma, more than half of campers (53.7%) brought their four-legged friends along with them in 2023.\n\nThe Dyrt, the No. 1 app for camping availability, photos and reviews, also found that 46.8% of campers list RVing as their primary camping type. If you think about it, it’s a perfect match. All the comforts of home and your best buddy traveling comfortably alongside you. No surprise then that five of the nine campgrounds in the Top 9 for K-9s: The Most Dog-Friendly Campgrounds in The U.S. for 2024 cater primarily to RVs.\n\nSpeaking of being catered to, the No. 1 campground this year is 4 Paws Kingdom Campground & Dog Retreat. Yes, “Dog” is right there in the name. This property truly prioritizes pampering pooches, right down to not allowing any humans under the age of 18 for optimal relaxation and minimal fur tugging. 4 Paws is set on nine acres and some of the individual campsites even have fenced-in yards.\n\n“People love camping for a lot of the same reasons that dogs love camping,” says Sarah Smith, founder of The Dyrt. “You get out of the house, immerse yourself in nature, explore, see some wildlife, sit by a fire, sleep in the great outdoors. When we take Brandy (aka The Dyrt Dog) camping with us, I know she’s having as much fun as we are.”\n\nTop 9 for K-9s is the official close to The Dyrt awards season, which started with The Glampys and was followed by the Best Places to Camp Regional and National awards, presented by Toyota Tacoma, and the Best Places to RV presented by State Farm.\n\nUsing AI to sift through The Dyrt’s millions of user-generated reviews, photos and tips of U.S. campgrounds, we identified campgrounds that were not just dog-friendly, but dog-welcoming. They are ranked based on reviews, photos, accommodations and amenities offered. Here’s to the dog days of summer! Who wants to go for a ride?!\n\n4 Paws Kingdom Campground & Dog Retreat — North Carolina: Doggy heaven on Earth\n\nWagonhammer RV Park & Campground — Idaho: Welcome to off-leash island\n\nLake George RV Park — New York: Bark Park hits the mark\n\nAlum Creek State Park — Ohio: Fenced-in fields for big and small dogs\n\nTahoe Valley Campground — California: Dogs want to go to Tahoe too\n\nCampground at James Island County Park — South Carolina: 643 acres of exploring\n\nChatfield State Park — Colorado: 69-acre, fenced-in dog park\n\nFirst Landing State Park — Virginia: 20 miles of trails and Chesapeake Bay beach\n\nSanta Fe Skies RV Park — New Mexico: Trails, a dog park and unmatched mountain views\n\nThe Dyrt’s Top 9 for K-9s: The Most Dog-Friendly Campgrounds in The U.S.\n\n1. 4 Paws Kingdom Campground & Dog Retreat — North Carolina\n\nPhoto by The Dyrt camper Shelly S.\n\nLocation: Rutherfordton\n\nWhat makes it a top dog: 4 Paws Kingdom lays claim to be the first dog-dedicated campground in the country. Everything — and when we say everything, that includes the literature on their website — is targeted to dogs. For example, they provide a list of “human amenities” and the FAQ section “is for your human traveling companion. They always have questions, so we want to give them as much information as possible.”\n\nSet on nine acres in the foothills of North Carolina’s Blue Ridge Mountains, 4 Paws Kingdom boasts a doggy bathhouse with grooming station, swimming pond, agility park, main dog park, private dog park and a park just for small pups. Some individual campsites even have fenced-in “yards.” 4 Paws also offers rental RVs and cabins. While fur babies get the first-class treatment, human babies are met with a stern, “No!” That’s right, 4 Paws is strictly 18 and over. And they’re not counting in dog years.\n\nWhat The Dyrt’s community of dog-lovers has to say:\n\n“We visited this park a few weeks ago and wished we could have stayed longer! It’s a well-kept, clean park within approximately half an hour from Lake Lure (where Dirty Dancing was filmed). It is an adult only campground that is dog-centric… For us the best of both worlds! Includes several dog parks for large and small breeds, and a pond in which the pups can swim and splash around. We’ve never been to a park like this one and highly recommend it if you can get in. We’ll be back for sure!” — Gabi B.\n\n“This place was a 13 hour drive and so worth it. All of the cabins and trailers available to rent are so reasonably priced and have AC and fully functioning appliances. Every cabin or RV rental has its own private gated yard with your own firepit. Several dog parks and a private pond for the pups means days of fun for an active, social dog.” — Ash D.\n\nPrice: $43-$145+; Number of sites: 50+; Learn more about 4 Paws Kingdom Campground & Dog Retreat\n\n2. Wagonhammer RV Park & Campground — Idaho\n\nPhoto by The Dyrt camper Lisa B.\n\nLocation: North Fork\n\nWhat makes it a top dog: Wagonhammer RV Park and Campground has 40 pull-thru full-hookup sites or electric and water sites (52 sites total with teepees and tents) along the Salmon River in northeastern Idaho. There are ample opportunities for biking, hiking, bird watching, boating, fishing, ATV riding and Salmon-Challis National Park is closeby.\n\nThe biggest perk at this pet-friendly paradise near the Montana state line is a nature walking path situated on an island accessible by a foot bridge where dogs can run and play off leash. There is also a pond doggos can dip their paws into or paddle around in, plus the river offers another swimming option for more adventurous pups.\n\nWhat The Dyrt’s community of dog-lovers has to say:\n\n“Stayed at wagonhammer campground in September. Great location & super clean! Our campsite was right next to the river. Dog friendly and there is a dog island that your fur kid can run around off leash!” — Lisa B.\n\n“Having to run our company from the road, traveling with three kids under 5, 3 dogs and a cat, all over 5 we need to be able to work. Here’s what we loved: Beautiful and clean; Quiet and close to the river; Incredible dog area.” — Brian C.\n\nPrice: $25-$45; Number of sites: 52; Learn more about Wagonhammer RV Park & Campground\n\n3. Lake George RV Park — New York\n\nPhoto by The Dyrt camper Jim G.\n\nLocation: Lake George\n\nWhat makes it a top dog: Lake George is a destination unto itself, the quintessential Northeast outdoorsy getaway for families and groups of friends. But Lake George RV Park is a destination within a destination. It’s one of the Best Places to RV in the country, but it’s even better if there’s a four-legged friend with you on your four wheels. The park map is reminiscent of a map of Disney, and that’s only a slight exaggeration.\n\nThere are multiple areas for RVs, two ponds, a creek, waterpark, indoor and outdoor pools, courts for various sports and activities, cinemas, arcades and a playhouse. But the pèt de résistance is Charlie’s Bark Park, a two-acre off-leash recreation area and pavilion with designated large and small dog areas. Charlie’s has an indoor dog wash station, pet treat vending area, dog spray fountain, agility events, shaded walking trails and large synthetic turf play area.\n\nWhat The Dyrt’s community of dog-lovers has to say:\n\n“Our favorite part was the dog park. I’ve never seen anything like it and wish we had access to something like this everywhere.” — Debbie W.\n\n“We got a wooded site that is not a too far walk from any of the action or amenities. The dog park area is huge and allows for lots of play. The human amenities of the camp store and cafe are great.” — Erin J.\n\nPrice: $109-$199; Number of sites: 426+; Learn more about Lake George RV Park\n\n4. Alum Creek State Park — Ohio\n\nPhoto by The Dyrt camper Grace D.\n\nLocation: Delaware\n\nWhat makes it a top dog: Alum Creek has sites for all types of camping and pets are more than welcome. There’s even an equestrian camp for horses — they’re kinda like dogs, but a lot bigger — with 30 primitive sites available on a first-come, first-served basis. The other nearly 300 sites offer both shady and sunny areas with some overlooking the lake.\n\nThe human amenities include a beach and boat ramp, basketball courts, volleyball, mini golf, horseshoes and playgrounds. For pups, the park boasts two large fenced-in fields for both small and big dogs and two large fenced-in areas with lake access. Tennis balls are in abundance and water stations are there to make sure hot dogs stay cool.\n\nWhat The Dyrt’s community of dog-lovers has to say:\n\n“There is a campground beach and boat launch. Lots of hiking paths in the campground and in the park area. A great dog park with lake entrance for the pups.” — Jill B.\n\n“The dog park is awesome, they have their own beach!” — Shelly S.\n\nPrice: $17-$50; Number of sites: 316; Learn more about Alum Creek State Park\n\n5. Tahoe Valley Campground — California\n\nPhoto by The Dyrt camper Randy J.\n\nLocation: South Lake Tahoe\n\nWhat makes it a top dog: People love Lake Tahoe. It’s one of the premier vacation destinations in the country where to celebrate life’s finer pleasures. Mountain views blend into towering pines and that internationally known shimmering lake holds it all together. So why wouldn’t dogs love it too?\n\nYour pooch will enjoy a nice walk on the Tahoe Valley grounds, a stroll along the Upper Truckee River and a romp on the beaches of South Lake Tahoe. The campground also has a large dog park to help get the zoomies out, and there are plenty of hiking trails and other sights and sounds for your pup to see and sniff throughout the property.\n\nWhat The Dyrt’s community of dog-lovers has to say:\n\n“The dog park was great!! When you’re traveling with a Great Dane and Australian Shepard, that’s a big deal!! We’ll stay here again.” — David & Sue C.\n\n“I liked the general store a lot, cute gifts and things! They do have a really big dog park which we loved too, the dogs also seemed to love it!” — Kathryn R.\n\nPrice: $46-$258; Number of sites: 439; Learn more about Tahoe Valley Campground\n\n6. Campground at James Island County Park — South Carolina\n\nPhoto by The Dyrt camper Joel R.\n\nLocation: Charleston\n\nWhat makes it a top dog: Just outside of quaint, charming downtown Charleston is scenic, serene James Island County Park. The 643-acre park features a campground that is one of the Best Places to Camp in the Southeast Region, and dogs seem to think as highly of this campground as humans do.\n\nThe off-leash dog park and walking trails are the highlights for the good boys and girls, and there are also 16 acres of freshwater lakes and open meadows abound. There are paved trails for biking and skating, a waterpark, climbing wall, playground area, fishing and crabbing opportunities and picnic areas.\n\nWhat The Dyrt’s community of dog-lovers has to say:\n\n“This was a beyond beautiful park. From walking trails, the pristine bathrooms, and incredible dog park, we couldn’t have had a better stay. We should have stayed longer.” — Lauren and Brent S.\n\n“The park does allow pets and has a dog park with a beach; it seems like the pups were having a marvelous time playing chase on the beach.” — Lori D.\n\nPrice: $35-$70; Number of sites: 134; Learn more about Campground at James Island County Park\n\n7. Chatfield State Park — Colorado\n\nPhoto by The Dyrt camper sunny B.\n\nLocation: Littleton\n\nWhat makes it a top dog: Chatfield State Park is a 5,800-acre nature preserve and recreation area and a favorite among those living in the Denver metro area. There are nearly 200 tent and RV sites, the majority of which are equipped with full hookups, and a group camp area with 10 sites that can accommodate up to 36 people each. All sites are close to the reservoir and activities include swimming, paddling, boating, water-skiing and fishing.\n\nThe 69-acre, fenced-in, off-leash dog park allows pups to run for days, or at least until their next nap. It includes two ponds, where fishing is prohibited, and there are miles of both paved and unpaved walking trails. Owners should still bring a leash and there is a limit of three dogs per handler, so rehearsal for your Vegas show will have to take place elsewhere.\n\nWhat The Dyrt’s community of dog-lovers has to say:\n\n“The biggest dog park around (25 acres), many endless, open spaces/trails for biking and ‘hiking’/walks/runs (mostly flat grounds), 15m from most necessities (stores/restaurants etc).” — sunny B.\n\n“This is a really neat spot. Big dog park, hot air balloons, ice fishing.” — Tanner A.\n\nPrice: $36-$41; Number of sites: 197; Learn more about Chatfield State Park\n\n8. First Landing State Park — Virginia\n\nPhoto by The Dyrt camper Bridget H.\n\nLocation: Virginia Beach\n\nWhat makes it a top dog: First Landing State Park offers a variety of campsite types from tent, group sites, cabins, pop-ups and small RVs to 50-foot motorhomes. There are also yurts with large wooden decks, picnic tables, pedestal grill and fire ring with a cooking grate. As you may have deduced from the name, this is where English colonists first landed in 1607. English bulldogs could not have been far behind.\n\nThe park isn’t geared toward dogs specifically like 4 Paws Kingdom, but its 20 miles of trails and more than a mile of beachfront on Chesapeake Bay offer pooches plenty of room to roam, on a leash of course, and fill their bucket with natural adventure. First Landing is a National Natural Landmark and is in the National Register of Historic Places. Major campground renovations are scheduled to take place this fall.\n\nWhat The Dyrt’s community of dog-lovers has to say:\n\n“I really enjoyed this place. The sites are private and a short walk to the bay. There are nice hiking trails my dog and I walked daily.” — Debbie R.\n\n“This is a beautiful park that is very close to the water. As with other Virginia State Parks, the campground is very clean and the facilities are well-maintained. There are lots of trails to walk and bike on and are great for dogs.” — Brittany B.\n\nPrice: $28-$40; Number of sites: 200+; Learn more about First Landing State Park\n\n9. Santa Fe Skies RV Park — New Mexico\n\nPhoto by The Dyrt camper Kimberly\n\nLocation: Santa Fe\n\nWhat makes it a top dog: Santa Fe Skies sits on 17 acres at the foot of the beautiful Sangre de Cristo Mountains, located just off the scenic Turquoise Trail. The park is on a ridge just outside of town, so visitors get a full panoramic view of Santa Fe.\n\nAmenities for the 98 sites — all of which have 20/30/50 amp service — include free Wi-Fi, propane, laundry, showers and a dump station, but Fido doesn’t care about that. He’s more into the walking trails, one specifically for dogs, and the large off-leash dog park. Unique steel sculptures, many created by Albuquerque artist Joe Forrest Sackett, dot the park and make for interesting backdrops for that Instagram vacation photo dump.\n\nWhat The Dyrt’s community of dog-lovers has to say:\n\n“Friendly staff, great campground setup. Very accommodating to travelers with dogs as they have a dog walking path and dog park.” — Megan\n\n“There is not a bad site in this park that we could tell. All are level, spacious, and have a concrete patio. Wifi was strong enough for streaming at site 18. Nice trail around entire park for dog walks. Also a dog park.” — mary F."
