        "text": "Ahttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Dog_Island\n\nBasically you get to customize your dog (they have different examples so I'd do something boyish obviously), the dog is in search of a special flower he has to sniff out in order to save his sibling.\n\nAren't your doing a tiered cake you could have each one represent parts of the dogs journey. The sibling gets sick at a carnival, so you could start there, then wrap around to the DR's office. He takes off on a boat, and jumps off... You could do some really cool things with this cake!\n\nIf your doing a sheet cake, you could have the whole thing a map with pop up parts and labels. Since the boys older you should try to incorporate as much detail as you can (stay true to the game) within their budget of course but I think the extra research into the actual game will make the cake really special and impressive. I'd love to see what you come up with!\n\nI want to make one now ;)"
