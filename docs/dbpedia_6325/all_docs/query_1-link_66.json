        "text": "ShareCompleted\n\nPrivate\n\n70%Wii\n\n15h 26m Played\n\nDespite being really repetitive gameplay for most of the game, I actually enjoyed this game okay! The story was the best part in my opinion, as it's completely insane how much death and disease is mentioned in this dog game for kids. Had a good and wholesome ending, though. Gameplay was a little fun too but got old super fast due to it being reused too much. Graphics are eh but I will give credit to the dogs for looking like their actual dog breeds. Music was eh too but some tracks are actually better than others and maybe even bangers. Controls we're also iffy for me at times but it's hard to tell if it was my aging Wii freaking out or if it was the game itself.\n\nOveral, 7/10. Would've loved this game as a kid and been OBSESSED if I played it back then. As an adult? You can still find enjoyment in it, but be prepared to do things on repeat. A lot. For all of the game pretty much.\n\nShareCompleted\n\nKerfMerf\n\n70%PlayStation 2\n\n9h 47m Played\n\nHard to rate... on the one hand it is a horribly-paced kids game with one gameplay mechanic stretched out over 8-10 hours, but on the other hand it actually has some interesting levels and surprisingly deep characters.\n\nIf you can handle the ridiculous amount of backtracking (seriously, it's the majority of the game) then you just might find a gem underneath the flawed exterior."
