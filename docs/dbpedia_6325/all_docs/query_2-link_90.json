        "text": "The advertisement is inviting but vague - ''Escape to the island that time forgot - a pristine barrier island off the northwest coast of Florida.'' The only clue to the island's whereabouts is the name of a town, Carabelle, which the map shows is on the coast, west of the big bend on the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nA telephone call reveals some details. However, the name of the island and its short distance from the mainland hardly evoke escape and solitude - Dog Island, three and a half miles from Carabelle, 50 miles southwest of Tallahassee. And yet the trip over is by passenger ferry - no cars are hauled -and the visitor must buy everything in Carabelle but water for the stay on the island. There are no stores, no restaurants, nothing to buy. No telephone either.\n\nDog Island is indeed secluded and everyone on the island wants to keep it that way. The advertisement, which was placed by the only accommodation there, the Pelican Inn, cannot give the name or location of the island because the inn's deed prohibits it from doing so. The inn fits in nicely with the island's quietude. It has only eight small apartments.\n\nThe island is ideal for those who want to shell, swim, take photographs of unobstructed sunrises and sunsets, hike to tidal marshes and freshwater ponds, walk along clean white beaches, seek out birds (200 species during the year) and study plants (391 species of native and naturalized plants). Most of the seven-mile-long island, 1,100 acres of its 1,800 acres, is in the Jeff Lewis Wilderness Preserve. About 100 cottages -in use during the summer - dot the gulf and St. George Sound (known as the bay) side in the central part of the island. The east and west ends are undeveloped. The permanent community consists of three retired couples and two or three other people.\n\nThe few visitors have their favorite seasons. Bird watchers like spring and fall for the migrations. Those who want solitude prefer the winter. During a recent visit, hikes to the east and west ends were made without encountering anyone on the beach or along the tidal marshes. On the walk to the west end, a reddish egret, tricolor heron and great egret were seen fishing at low tide within a few feet of each other. The path passed a pond where sparrows, blackbirds and towhee were spotted. Along the beach at the west end, the stumps seen in the water were the tap roots of trees that were once part of a forest. And the foundation of a lighthouse that once stood here is now investigated by scuba divers 125 yards offshore.\n\nThe island, which was formed some 6,000 years ago from sediments transported by the Apalachicola River system, changes shape with the alternating periods of erosion and sand deposition. Now, the sand is moving from the center to the west and east ends.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
