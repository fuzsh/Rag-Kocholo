        "text": "SULLIVAN’S ISLAND, S.C. (WCSC/Gray News) - A 2-year-old Golden Retriever has earned the nickname “Kona the Coyote Catcher” after saving the life of a smaller poodle from a coyote attack in South Carolina.\n\nThe attack comes a year after Sullivan’s Island town officials reported five coyote-led attacks involving dogs last August.\n\nAshly Chardukian and her golden retriever, Kona, came to the beach on Sullivan’s Island on June 25 for a relaxing day with friends when an unthinkable situation happened right before their eyes.\n\nThe group was sitting on the beach watching the sunset when they suddenly heard a yelp from behind them in the dunes.\n\nA coyote had a small poodle pinned down by the neck, and its owner was trying to rescue the dog.\n\nThat’s when Kona suddenly ran towards the scene, barking and chasing the coyote off, saving the poodle’s life and leaving it uninjured.\n\n“What is she doing? She’s not supposed to do that,” Chardukian said, referring to Kona. “But she’s just a little wild thing, and she just went right after it.”\n\nChardukian’s friend documented the attack. In a still, the poodle, its owner, Kona and the coyote can be seen.\n\n“I think it was just a really special moment,” Chardukian said. “It was nice to be able to witness, and I’m happy that the other dog was safe. Of course, I’m proud of her.”\n\nSullivan’s Island has seen three reported coyote sightings in the first three months of 2024 with Police Chief Glenn Meadows saying the sightings and attacks have gone way down.\n\n“We’ve been lucky that the attacks have always just been against dogs and not against humans,” Meadows said. “We then take those reports and analyze where the coyote activity is occurring on the island.”\n\nTwo of the reported sightings or attacks were around the same time as Kona’s story, but it was not one of the reported incidents. The Sullivan’s Island Police Department put traps out on June 27 and caught one female coyote on July 18.\n\n“We suggest that they keep the dogs on leash because what we’re seeing is that when these attacks against dogs occur, it’s against dogs that are off-leash, and while away from their owners,” Meadows said. “We have not had any attacks reported to us where coyotes approached a dog on a leash.”\n\nThe coyotes on Sullivan’s Island are typically spotted near the dunes or the more wooded area near the beach.\n\n“Be careful close to the dunes, especially if you have a small dog because they’re hiding. You can’t see them, but they’re there,” Chardukian says. “If you have your little dog walking there, I mean, that’s kind of their perfect prey.”\n\nMeadows said if you are attacked or see coyotes to call the non-emergency line so they know where these sightings are happening and what they can do to prevent it from happening again.\n\n“We rely on the citizens to tell us when they see coyotes when there’s a coyote interaction or a coyote attack against a dog,” Meadows said."
