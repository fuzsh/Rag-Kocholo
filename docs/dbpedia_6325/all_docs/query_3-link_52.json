Check the park’s program list for details.\n\nAbout the Park\n\nDelaware’s southernmost beach, Fenwick Island State Park offers three miles of ocean beaches along with access to the Little Assawoman Bay. The park once was home to the late 1800s Fenwick Island Life-Saving Station, lost in the storm of 1962, which provided aid to maritime travelers in distress off Delaware’s Atlantic coast. Fenwick Island State Park is home to a World War II-era fire control tower that helped protect the coastline. Ghost crabs are a popular site along the water, and programs are offered to learn about these and other natural resources at the park. Kayaking is a favorite pastime at this tranquil downstate park.\n\nSwimming, Surfing, Sailing and Sunbathing\n\nToday, Fenwick Island State Park invites visitors to its peaceful ocean and bay shorelines. Swimming and sunbathing are popular activities on the ocean side of the park. The white sand beaches gradually slope into the Atlantic, creating a broad swimming area patrolled by lifeguards during the summer. The park features a modern bathhouse, which offers convenient showers and changing rooms, a satellite park office, and a snack food concession. During the summer months, beach umbrellas and chairs may be rented on the beach. Mobi-Mat equipment, consisting of three 30-foot mats allowing those in wheelchairs and power chairs to access the beach from the boardwalk, is available here.\n\nKayaks, stand-up paddleboards, and sailboats are available for rent if you didn't bring your own.\n\nFishing\n\nThe ocean beaches are a favorite spot for surf fishing. Three dune crossings provide access to multi-use beaches where vehicles with a surf fishing license plate bearing a current surf-fishing decal can drive onto the beach to fish. Surf fishing vehicle decals and plates may be purchased at the nearby Delaware Seashore Regional Office located at the Indian River Marina, at the Indian River Life-Saving Station, or online. A fishing license from DNREC's Division of Fish and Wildlife is required when fishing in tidal waters.\n\nUpcoming Events\n\nWild Crab Chase at Fenwick Island\n\nThursday, August 22, 2024\n\n8:30 PM\n\nWe're sending you on a wild CRAB chase!
