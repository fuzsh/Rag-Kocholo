        "text": "General Information\n\nA turkey permit and a hunting license are required while hunting wild turkey.\n\nYou may buy only one turkey permit per year.\n\nIf you have filled your bag limit, you may call turkeys for another hunter, but you may not carry a bow or firearm.\n\nIf you have taken a turkey which is unfit for consumption, authorized DEC staff may issue a special permit to take another. You will have to surrender the carcass. Call your local wildlife or law enforcement office.\n\nManner of Taking\n\nYou must carry your hunting license and turkey permit while you hunt.\n\nYou may hunt with a bow or crossbow.\n\nYou may not hunt turkey with a crossbow in the fall in the Northern Zone if you are using dogs.\n\nCrossbows are not a legal implement in WMU 1C (Suffolk County).\n\nYou may hunt with a shotgun or handgun only when using shot no larger than #2 and no smaller than #9.\n\nYou may use a muzzleloading shotgun.\n\nYou may not take a turkey with a rifle, or with a handgun firing a bullet.\n\nYou may not hunt with a dog during the spring season. You may hunt with a dog during the fall season.\n\nYou may not use bait to hunt turkey.\n\nYou may not use an electronic calling or amplifying device to locate or hunt turkeys during the open season.\n\nYou may use decoys.\n\nA scope of any type is allowed.\n\nSpring Turkey Season\n\nIn the spring you may take two bearded birds. You may only take one bird per day.\n\nShooting hours are from 1/2-hour before sunrise to noon.\n\nImmediately after taking a turkey, fill out the carcass tag and attach it to the bird.\n\nYou do not need to save and send in turkey legs in the spring. You do need to take careful spur, beard, and weight measurements for reporting.\n\nSpur measurements: spurs should be measured from the tip of the spur to the base of the spur, where it emerges from the scaly part of the leg. Measure to the nearest 1/4 inch. Do not measure to the forward edge of the leg, only to the base of the spur.\n\nBeard Measurements: beards should be measured from the tip of the beard to the base, where it emerges from the skin. Butt the end of your ruler against the base of the beard and extend the beard along the body of the ruler. Measure to the nearest 1/4 inch.\n\nRecord the weight to the nearest pound.\n\nFall Turkey Season\n\nThe statewide season bag limit is one bird of either sex.\n\nSee the turkey season map for season dates.\n\nShooting hours are from sunrise to sunset.\n\nImmediately after taking a turkey, you must fill out the carcass tag in ink and attach it to the bird.\n\nIf you take a turkey, save one of its legs. Return it in the leg envelope you will receive. The legs are used for age and sex information.\n\nYou may not hunt turkey with a crossbow in the fall in the Northern Zone if you are using dogs.\n\nTagging and Possession\n\nImmediately after taking a wild turkey, you must fill out the appropriate carcass tag in ink, cut out or mark in ink the date of the kill, and secure it to the carcass. During the Youth Hunt you will need to write \"April\" on the back of the tag and mark that.\n\nThe carcass tag must stay attached to the turkey carcass until it is prepared for eating.\n\nYou may give your turkey to another person. You must attach a tag with the following information to the turkey carcass:\n\nYour name\n\nYour address\n\nYour hunting license number\n\nYour turkey permit number\n\nHis/Her name\n\nHis/Her address\n\nThis tag must stay attached to the turkey carcass until it is prepared for eating.\n\nReporting Your Take\n\nFor both fall and spring, you must report taking a turkey via the new DECALS reporting system. Call 1-866-GAME-RPT within 7 days to report take.\n\nTo record your spring turkey take, you will need the spur and beard measurements recorded on the carcass tag.\n\nTurkey Hunting Safety Tips\n\nMost turkey hunting injuries happen when one hunter stalks another."
