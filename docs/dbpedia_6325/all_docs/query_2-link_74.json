        "text": "Every year, there is a summer-long discussion about traffic safety and how motorists, pedestrians and bicyclists need to share the road on Long Beach Island. But with dogs accounting for more than half of the animals traveling the world in recent years, perhaps there needs to be a broader discussion about dog safety, too.\n\nLike clockwork, social media posts pop up around the Fourth of July about fireworks, keeping dogs indoors and feeling safe. What, though, of everyday safety, like trips to the dog park or a morning walk? Think the answer is simple, think again.\n\n“Dog parks can be very dirty and full of disease, even when owners clean up after their dogs,” said Megan Keller, owner and head trainer of Layin’ Down the Paw LLC. “It’s a confined space that no one is coming in and sanitizing, to my knowledge.”\n\nStill, she said large, well-defined dog parks that are generally quiet where a dog owner can schedule a play date with a known dog friend could be the right fit for some.\n\n“If someone new comes, just ask them to wait until you get your dogs out,” said Keller, who retired from the Long Beach Township Police Department last year after a 20-year career. “I am OK with that scenario.”\n\nOtherwise, she doesn’t typically recommend dog parks too often.\n\n“There is a small percentage of dogs who like and get along with all other dogs. There is also a small percentage of dogs who don’t like any other dogs outside their own family and don’t want to get along with other dogs,” Keller said, adding there are also dogs who like some other dogs but don’t like others. “We don’t do that as humans, so why are we doing that to our dogs?”\n\nShe likened the expectation that all dogs at dog parks will get along, to on-leash greetings that often occur when dog owners meet other, unknown dog owners at a morning walk.\n\n“You don’t go up to everyone you meet in the street and say hello. That would be weird,” she added. “So, why should your dog do that?”\n\nKeller said she tells her clients not to take their dogs inside dog parks unless it’s empty or they’re meeting a known dog friend there.\n\n“Otherwise, I tell them to work and train their dog outside of the park fence to generalize the training that they’re working on and help create a more neutral reaction to seeing other dogs,” she said, noting proper exercise and socialization of dogs are widely misunderstood.\n\n“Every dog has different exercise needs, and in addition their brains need to be exercised as well,” Keller said. “I highly recommend training as part of an exercise program. It’s beneficial to both the dog and owner and their relationship.”\n\nHowever, many dog owners view dog parks as a safe place for their dogs to run out some energy and socialize with other dogs.\n\n“It (socializing) is not just (about) meeting other dogs,” Keller said, adding, “Ideally, it (socializing dogs) should start at a very early age with gradual exposure to new sights, sounds, experiences – connecting this with positive reinforcement to make the interactions positive experiences.”\n\nKeller said she has found that many dog owners who allow their puppies/dogs to meet and greet every dog they encounter “end up with reactive dogs who can’t be around other dogs on a leash without crying, whining or even worse, barking and lunging.”\n\nThe American Kennel Club said dogs bark for several reasons, including to show their excitement when playing with other dogs and humans. Large breed dogs, like American Staffordshire terrier, Neapolitan mastiff and German shepherd, among others, are often ostracized at dog parks for barking as they play, while smaller dogs are not.\n\n“I think owners don’t realize that little dogs need training and proper socialization, too. All too often, owners don’t start training little dogs right away and unfortunately, they end up with bad behaviors,” she said, noting some of those behaviors stem from fear and insecurity. “They were just picked up, instead of being allowed to explore and build confidence in themselves.”\n\nAnd what about those lengthy, daily morning walks many owners take with their dogs?\n\n“I think that announcing that you’re passing with a dog, or crossing the street to pass, is a great protocol to abide by,” she said.\n\n— Gina G.
