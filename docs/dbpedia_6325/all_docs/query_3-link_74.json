        "text": "Hunting\n\nWild hogs may be trapped and hunted year-round with landowner permission. A hunting license is not required, and a permit is not required to take wild hogs at night with a gun and light with landowner permission.\n\nHunters may use dogs and any legal rifle, shotgun, crossbow, bow, pistol or air gun (including airbow). There is no size or bag limit, and either sex may be harvested.\n\nWild hogs may be trapped using live traps (e.g., box traps, cage traps, corral traps). Trapped animals may not be released on public lands and may only be released on private property with landowner permission. Persons wishing to transport or hold live wild hogs must first obtain applicable permits from the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services (FDACS).\n\nUse of Dogs\n\nWhen hunting wild hogs using dogs, all dogs must wear a collar or tag that legibly displays the dog owner’s name and address. Written permission from the landowner (or lessee) is required, must be in each hunter’s possession, and must be presented for inspection upon request of any FWC wildlife officer or other law enforcement officer.\n\nIn addition, all dogs not under physical restraint used for pursuing wild hog must be equipped and monitored with devices that allow remote tracking and behavior correction."
