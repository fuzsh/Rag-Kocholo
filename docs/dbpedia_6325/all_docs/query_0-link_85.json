It’s the cartridge / disc only unless otherwise specified.\n\nThis is the The Dog Island Nintendo WII Game guaranteed to work like new and backed by the Retrolio Games 90-day no questions asked returns policy!\n\nPRODUCT DETAILS The Dog Island – Wii Game\n\nUPC:008888173595\n\nCondition:Used\n\nGenre:Action & Adventure\n\nPlatform:Nintendo Wii\n\nRegion:NTSC (N. America)\n\nESRB:Everyone\n\nSKU:WII_DOG_ISLAND\n\n———This game is fully cleaned, tested & working. Includes the Disc/Cartridge Only. May have some minor scratches/scuffs.This description was last updated on October 28th, 2020.\n\nThe Dog Island is one of many wii games I’ve wanted for a long time. When I finally got my hands on it I was far from disappointed. Of the 8 wii games I owe so far this might possibly be my favorite wii game.Story: Don’t let the fact that this is a kids game fool you. This game gets extra respect from me for the fact that its not afraid to mention death and other mature conflicts throughout the storyline. The main story involves you playing as a young pup who travels to a far away island known as Dog island to find a cure for a fatal illness your sick sibling is suffering. The story is actually very interesting and I was never once bored with it. It even touched my heartstrings on many occasions.Gameplay: You only need the wii remote to play the game. You move your dog around by pointing the curser at the screen and holding down B and interact with objects and other dogs with A. A is also used to sniff out objects burried in the ground and waggling the wii remote makes your dog bury beneath the ground. There are enemies in this game, but theres no actual combat. You have to sneak up on enemies and bark at them. The longer you hold down “-” the louder the bark and the longer the enemy is knocked out. Icons show up above an enemies head to signal rather you’re seen or not. Early on enemies are extremely easy to stun, but don’t get cocky because later on in the game enemies become impossible to stun, most specifically flying enemies and the annoying cobra enemies that are hard t.\n\nThis game was absolutely stupendous and I loved every moment of it. The shipping and quality of the game from the shop was exactly as was expected, if not better. The game itself has many surprises in store for the player and is so cute.It is much longer than one might expect upon starting it but it was really nice. I got so into the game that I beat it in only 2 days. I would recommend this game to any gamer–hardcore or casual. Just make sure you are all aboard for the feels train.\n\nI agree with the review of just letting this game be what it is. Somethings that will be a drawback for those without patience are the long and mostly unnecessary video sequences very early on in the game. There is also an awful lot of reading as the dialogue between characters is written, not spoken. Younger players who are not reading well or at all will need someone to watch with them much of the time. But hey, reading with our kids is becoming a lost tradition that needs a comeback in some form. This may just lead to bedtimes reading chapters of “Charlotte’s Web” with your children rather than just popping in the video and getting it all over with in just over an hour. Sorry…I digress.The game looks and sounds great, the story is engaging and though sickenly sweet that’s okay. Jeez it’s about Puppies so what would you expect. There are moments when you’ll be moved and think “Aww” and moments you’ll laugh, and even be excited. About 30 minutes into the game it becomes what you want it to with exploration and some angry creatures that, yes, will hurt you if you’re not careful. The youngest boy I work with was afraid of the snakes and the wild boars and always handed the controller to another resident to play those parts but he never quit playing and remained engrossed in the story line. Anyone can relate to being sick, trying to help someone in need and the frustrations and rewards that come with that. That’s what this game is all about. It reminds me very much of th.\n\nFirst off let me just say that I’m probably not the target audience for this game. I’m a 30 something male with no children who traditionally loves adventure games akin to Zelda, Mario Galaxy, Okami etc. But a video game based on the small dogs with oversized heads franchise (known to some as The Dog, to others like me as STRANGE RATIO!) was just too much to pass up. So I picked it up.At 30 bucks this game is totally worth the purchase. Compared to other games of the ‘adventure’ genre, it’s not very original, but the overall cute factor really does make up for it. Essentially the entire game is comprised of various Fetch Quests which involve your character (you can choose to be one of forty odd breeds of dogs like Beagle, Rottweiler, Basset Hound, Poodle, Akita, Husky- the list goes ON and ON and ON) learning how to sniff and running around the Dog Island finding things for other characters, all in the name of finding a cure for your brother/sister (you can decide the gender), who is a non-playable character that gets sick at the beginning of the game.There are a few varied activities such as fishing, bug catching and dog soccer, and mild puzzle solving (not really- they sort of hold your hand through anything resembling a challenge) but for the most part there’s a lot of sniffing and digging. It’s a Dog Island, after all. For example, the Doctor on the island (a very likeable Beagle named Potan) will say “fetch me these three herbs from the field and they can be used to help.\n\nThis game is simply too adorable for words! I bought the game as a surprise so my girlfriend and I could enjoy it together, but I ended up falling in love with it! The price is hard to beat, too. We both like Pomeranians the best of any dog breed, so that’s a big plus in this game for us. :)Is the game difficult? Good heavens, no! It’s perfect for kids, but will be an amusing diversion for adults. The music is pleasant and catchy, the graphics are beautiful; some of the best I’ve seen on the Wii, to be honest. Your puppy’s journey to save his or her younger sibling by finding a cure for his or her illness is very sweet and touching. The game is well worth the price, and is one I can’t recommend highly enough!\n\nI remember playing this game when I was younger and how much I loved it. As a young kid, I had so much fun trying to figure out the riddles and how to get past certain animals or levels in the plot. The plot is original and enticing to young kids, as went with me and any of the friends I showed the game to as a kid. I just wish the would update this game to the newer platforms so that we could all still play it, or those more specifically that have recently updated gaming consoles. I loved making a dog in the very beginning and reading along with the story. Yes, it does have a lot of reading, but it actually helped me become better at reading since I enjoyed the game so much and wanted to thoroughly understand what it was saying without my parents’ input and help. I went from hating reading and hardly being able to do it to gradually building up my skills. Now, of course, my reading skills are a lot different, but as a kid that hated reading, I think it definitely helped to kickstart my love for it and my ability to in general. It also helped me with my concentration and being able to focus on one thing at a time instead of being a normal energetic kid that couldn’t concentrate on anything to save my life. It helped me with my problem solving skills when I was younger to, as you do have help others in this game with their problems and figure out how to accomplish your goals."
