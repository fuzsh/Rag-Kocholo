The non-resident youth under 16 years of age are not required to have completed a hunter safety/education course.\n\nAll preserve game birds and game animals harvested on the licensed preserve must be properly tagged with transportation/kill tags as required by law. Hunting preserve operators are responsible for tagging the harvested game bird or animal before it is transported from the licensed preserve.\n\n** Any resident or nonresident born after January 1, 1972, must have completed an approved hunter education program in Iowa or another state to buy a hunting license. If your hunter education certification is not on your customer record, you will have to either show proof of hunter education when purchasing your license at a local vendor to complete the order.\n\nPurchase Your License Online"
