Basically it‚Äôs about the adventure of a whoa-wtf-so-cute-can-melt puppy of your choice (of all 48 breeds, wichever you want!).\n\nAnd of course what else but did i choose a Maltese! And i named her Cheddie. ^_^\n\n*I think, this must be some kind of fate. I have always, always, always wanted a Maltese and have always, always, always wanted to name my future pup ‚ÄúCheddie‚Äú. Cheddie because my fav cheese is cheddar. ‚ÄúMaltese‚Äù in Japanese spelling looks/sounds like ‚ÄúMaru-chiizu‚Äú. Maru is ‚Äúround‚Äù and ‚Äúchiizu‚Äù in Japanese is CHEESE!!!!‚Äù Cheddie is a ROUND CHEESE! Wahahahoho*\n\nMy Cheddie is the cutest Cheddie in the world (if there‚Äôs any other Cheddie).\n\n(Shih tzu is damn cute too)\n\nThese are your friendly neighbors in Wanko Island.\n\nHaha. Wanko means dog in a kawaii way (think ‚Äúpooch‚Äù or ‚Äúwow wow‚Äú) in Japanese. Sounds funny! Like, he‚Äôs one cute wanko.\n\nImagine that!! If you call a sick person ‚Äúsicko‚Äù, and a weird person ‚Äúweirdo‚Äù, then wanko is‚Ä¶\n\nüòÄ\n\nWahahahoho.\n\nThe only bad thing (and yes, it is very very bad) in this game is‚Ä¶\n\nEveryfreakingthing is in Japanese.\n\nIf you don‚Äôt understand Japanese at all, have fun guessing. But OMC, i think if you‚Äôre learning or want to learn Japanese (but at least have some basic knowledge like understanding katagana and hiragana), and love cute fluffy little creatures, this is the perfect game for you!\n\nThe vocab is quite simple. I manage to understand most of the important keywords so far. Just 3 days and i‚Äôve completed almost 50% liao!\n\nYou have to play it! üòÄ üòÄ"
