        "meta_description": "If you would have told us that the gigantic casual push of Ubisoft titles would combine with the undeniably loveable nature of big-headed puppies to deliver a fresh and entertaining adventure/RPG for kids, we would have called you crazy.  That is, if we didn't totally see this one coming a mile away.  The Dog Island first started showing up on Japan videos nearly two years ago, as the developer Yukes has taken it upon itself to work on a sweet, lovable puppy RPG in between the flaming tables and barbed wire of its WWE fighting games.  Oh it's a stretch &#x2013; in fact, if we had to make a spectrum, we'd put Mankind thrown off a steel cage on the exact opposite side as a black labrador with spectacles &#x2013; but the end result is an adventure 'slash' RPG experience that is light on story, but heavy on style.",
