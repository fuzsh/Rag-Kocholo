        "text": "About Quota Hunts\n\nThe Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency realizes that in some areas of Tennessee, the number of hunters needs to be restricted so as not to cause a major impact on the resource. In these areas, the Agency utilizes a quota hunt system. There are bear, deer, elk, sandhill crane, turkey, and waterfowl hunts.\n\nQUOTA HUNT APPLICATIONS can be submitted or viewed in the following ways (applications cannot be accepted by mail)\n\nOn the Internet\n\nTWRA Licensed Agent locations\n\nTWRA Regional Offices\n\nTWRA Mobile App\n\nYou can log into the quota hunt module to apply for a quota hunt. You will also be able to edit a quota hunt application that you have submitted up until the deadline for that hunt. You will be able to see members that are in your quota hunt party.\n\nTransaction ID numbers are issued for all transactions that are completed in the REAL system. That number is your assurance that your application has been accepted into the system. If you have a valid email address on your account, an email is sent immediately after your transaction is complete. If you do not have a valid email address, you can screenshot the \"CHECKOUT COMPLETE\" page to retain your Transaction ID number or you may click the \"Print Application\" button located in the top, right corner of the page. If you have questions about your quota hunt application, you MUST have your Transaction ID number.\n\nYou will also be able to see the results of your quota hunt drawing as soon as we finish the drawing validation process and release the results to the public. ALL from your customer account.\n\nTennessee has a priority point system in place for several of its quota hunts. An applicant is awarded one point for each year he/she applies and is not drawn. Each point system is unique and separate for the different quota hunts, i.e., WMA Big Game, Spring Turkey, WMA, etc. Applicants with the highest priority are more likely to be drawn first.\n\nPRIORITY FACTS:\n\nIf applicants in a party have varying priority points, the points will be averaged, except for Waterfowl If applicants in a segmented WMA Waterfowl party have varying priority points, the party will assume the point status of the member with the highest priority.\n\nEach applicant’s priority is individual; it is only in the drawing that an applicant’s party priority is considered. When a party is unsuccessful, each applicant’s actual current priority points balance will increase by one point.\n\nPriority points only apply to the hunt category in which they were earned, i.e., WMA Big Game, Spring Turkey Waterfowl, etc.\n\nWhen a person is drawn for a hunt, their priority points will be reset to “0” the following year.\n\nSpring Turkey WMA: No limit.\n\nYouth Spring Turkey WMA: No limit\n\nElk and Youth Elk: No priority. An applicant successfully drawn may not reapply for 10 years.\n\nWMA Big Game: No limit.\n\nYouth WMA Big Game: No limit.\n\nCherokee Bear Party-Dog Hunts: No priority.\n\nWMA Season Long Waterfowl: No priority.\n\nWMA Early Season Waterfowl: No limit.\n\nWMA Mid-Season Waterfowl: No limit.\n\nWMA Late Season Waterfowl: No limit.\n\nSandhill Crane: No limit.\n\nBobwhite Quail: No priority.\n\nCost of Application\n\nA $12 non-refundable application fee is required for each drawing requested, except for individuals possessing a valid Annual, Lifetime, or Senior Sportsman License.\n\nExample: The “Maximum Awarded Permits” for WMA Big Game is two, meaning two drawings are held for the same pool of applicants. You may choose to enter one drawing, where you will only be eligible for one permit that will cost $12.00 plus any applicable fees. If you enter two drawings, you will be eligible for two permits and the cost will be $24.00, plus any fees. You must choose the number of drawings, party information, and hunt choices on one application."
