        "text": "Please send us a message with your full name and mailing address, the name of the game, which pieces you need, and the date code (number above the barcode) of your game. (This helps make sure the replacement pieces match your copy of the game.)\n\nEvery so often, when a game has earned its wings, we send it off to retirement. This is a very happy place where our games spend the rest of their years - the sun always shines and no one ever loses. Fear not, however, as we are continually coming out with new and exciting games! Visit our What's New page for all the details.\n\nYes! Please send a $5.00 check (US bank accounts only) along with a description of the parts you need to:\n\nReplacement Parts c/o Gamewright 250 Royall St. Suite 310W Canton, MA 02021\n\nYou can send in for any number of parts this way. Please include your phone number or e-mail address so we can contact you if we have questions. Please note if the game is out of print we may not have parts available.\n\nWe changed the Thief cards after the initial print run to make the game more accessible to colorblind people, but due to an error some copies of the game did not have updated rules. If your cards only have green dots, then green means the thief is wearing that item, and white means they are not.\n\nYou may play any number of Adventurer cards—even as few as one! But the most you’d ever want to play is six, since there are only six dice in the game.\n\nWhen you reveal the Chopsticks, they have no immediate effect. On any future hand, instead of picking one card as normal, you make pick any two cards at once from the same hand. If you do so, take the Chopsticks card off the table, and put it back into the current hand before you pass it on.\n\nYes. Equipment cards can be played any time, even in between two Storm cards. However, Equipment cannot be used to negate a Storm card that has just been revealed. For example, if a Sun Beats Down card is revealed, a Solar Shield may be played, but the Sun Beats Down card would still take its effect before the Solar Shield is active.\n\nThe stars around the box are a typo; play as if they aren’t actually there. The Maple Bar is worth 3 points if its condition is met at the end of the game (not 2, as in the rulebook). Remember that the Maple Bar itself counts toward its scoring requirement of more than six types."
