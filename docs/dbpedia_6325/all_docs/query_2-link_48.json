        "text": "I want to preface this article by saying that state-funded shelters are amazing. The NHSPCAs and MSPCAs of the world are doing amazing work with little funding, supplies, and support.\n\nThat said, there is a dog rescue (more like a sanctuary) in Maine that I wish every animal shelter could be modeled after.\n\nGrammy Rose Dog Rescue and Sanctuary in Acton is arguably the nicest dog rescue in the United States.\n\nThe dogs here have their own dormitories with a living room, air conditioning, furniture, private bedrooms, and more.\n\nNow why the heck would a rescue do all of this for animals to be adopted?\n\nHonestly, it makes perfect sense.\n\nAt Grammy Rose Dog Rescue, dogs are constantly being trained (whether they know it or not) to be released into loving owners' homes. That is why they have immaculate living conditions. The rescue wants your dog to be accustomed to people coming in and out of a home, having separate bedrooms, and having a yard to roam in.\n\nEverything the rescue offers prepares the dogs for their forever homes.\n\nBut the rescue is also doing amazing things for the owners of these future rescues.\n\nTo start, they are bringing potential owners in through different avenues. There is an ice cream stand and mini-golf course on site, which help fund the sanctuary.\n\nSo unlike other rescues where you may feel pressure or be constantly surrounded by dogs that need a home, this rescue allows you to feel relaxed, enjoy ice cream, and have some fun, all while bringing in people to help rescue these amazing animals.\n\nI think everything that Grammy Rose Dog Rescue is doing should be used as an example. These dogs are not hot and cramped in a full kennel with others. They are loved and shown what it is like to be in a home. They are walked on the various trails on site, they get used to being touched, and most importantly, they are loved.\n\nThe dogs are prepped by the staff to be in forever homes, and that is why Grammy Rose Dog Rescue and Sanctuary is so amazing."
