This exploration game, primarily aimed at children, sees you choose a breed of dog to play and undertake an adventure to the Dog Island to find a herb with which to cure the illness of your brother or sister. Gameplay is primarily quest-based, with a cast of dog characters to help throughout the island, but the game is also open-world once areas have been unlocked within the game. The title is a tie-in to a range of soft toys and other products.
