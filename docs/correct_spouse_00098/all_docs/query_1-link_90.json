According to People, the stunning star was introduced to the British sports agent through mutual friend Kate Moss. Gardner also reportedly holds the high honor of being David Beckham's best friend.\n\nThe news of the pregnancy comes just months into their whirlwind romance. The couple were first spotted together in August 2014, but reportedly began dating back in May.\n\nThe brunette babe already has a 9-year-old son, Milo, with her ex-husband Royston Langdon. Gardner has a son, Gray, from a previous marriage.\n\nHer pregnancy announcement comes after a rough couple of years for Liv. The \"Lord of the Rings\" star split from her hubby of five years in 2008 and took two years off from making films, before heading back to work on her HBO show \"The Leftovers.\" The hit show, which has been renewed for a second season, will have to find a way to cover Tyler's baby bump now.\n\nAerosmith rocker papa Steven Tyler has not publicly commented on his daughter's amazing news.\n\nHopefully he doesn't 'miss a thing!'\n\nMore from AOL\n\nJeff Goldblum stars In this super-crazy commercial for light bulbs\n\n'Twilight' is returning with new short films\n\nMolly Sims is pregnant with her second child"
