        "text": "Liv Tyler splits from husband\n\nLiv Tyler and her British rocker husband Royston Langdon have split up.\n\nAfter months of speculation their marriage was in trouble, the rumour mill went into overdrive when Liv turned up to the Costume Institute Gala alone and without her wedding ring.\n\nAnd a rep for the couple has now confirmed the break-up, saying: 'Liv Tyler and Royston Langdon have confirmed their separation. They remain good friends and devoted parents to their son Milo and are requesting that their family's privacy be respected at this time.'\n\nLord of the Rings star Liv, 30, and Leeds-born Spacehog singer Royston, 36, wed in a private ceremony at a villa in the Caribbean in 2003. Their son, Milo, was born in December 2004."
