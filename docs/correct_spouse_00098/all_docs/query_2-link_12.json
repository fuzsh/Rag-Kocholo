(continued)\n\nGrrr....there's another male to add to my black list!\n\n[image=http://us.news2.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20030403/mdf248962.jpg]\n\nOh well I still love her anyway\n\nWell, to be honest, I only liked her as Arwen ...\n\nI'd only marry her if she wore the pointy elf ears all the time ...\n\nWe should put a link to this thread at the top of pamphlet given to all new users to this site, entitled \"Welcome to Star Wars Nerdom: Check your social lives at the door. Forever.\"\n\nShe's not bad thanks Nyder!\n\nWhat, did our favourite late night fantasy get shattered by a passing remark about the misalignment of her jaw!\n\nMy preference doesn't lie with Tyler. Not when there's ELISHA CUTHBERT!\n\n[image=http://www.tccandler.com/elisha_HQ_HQ_maxim7.jpg]\n\nOoooooh yeah!\n\nE_S\n\nWhy get his permission?\n\nA FOXnews HEADLINE: SYDNEY: MARVINTHEMARTIAN DISSES LIBS, PRAISES LLAMAS AND KIEFER SUTHERLAND\n\nMarvinTheMartian, ardent Liberal supporter and pfffft'er of human rights, today shocked people by denouncing the Liberal Party publicly in response to their interferrance in his new policy of staring at the bust of 24 character Kim Bauer. MarvinTheMartian stated his intent to mix Liberal Party politics with perving on actress Elisha Cuthbert (who plays Kim Bauer) whilst needlessly using the word Llama, in an attempt to win the world record from the Monty Python troupe.\n\nMany experts have concluded that MarvinTheMartian is trying to bring the Liberal Party more in sync with Britain's Conservative Party, who's record of sex scandals and animals is second to none.\n\nReported by Ralph the Wonder Llama from Baghdad."
