        "text": "Dave Gardner was all smiles as he enjoyed a basketball game with friends including David Beckham – hours after his shock split from Hollywood fiancée Liv Tyler was announced.\n\nThe 45-year-old sports agent and the 44-year-old Lord of the Rings star had been together since 2014 and engaged since 2015 – with their son, Sailor, born in February 2015 and daughter, Lula, born in July 2016.\n\nBut this week the couple’s relationship was revealed to have come to an end – with reports detailing that the pair actually split back in March.\n\nWhile the heartbreaking news may be fresh, Dave looked in high spirits as he was joined by close friend David Beckham – who is under fire after becoming the face of the Fifa Qatar Cup – to watch a basketball game on Wednesday night.\n\nThe lads attended the Brooklyn Nets vs Atlanta Hawks basketball game in New York – and were snapped looking engrossed in the game as they sat at the side of the court.\n\nWhile Dave flashed a beaming smile as he posed alongside his friend and entrepreneur Mazdack Rassi during a break in play.\n\nRumours of a rift between Dave and Liv first emerged during the summer last month – when the actress jetted back to LA with Sailor and Lula and leaving the sports agent at home in the Cotswolds alone.\n\nThe family was reunited in October last year – with a close friend furiously denying there was any trouble between the parents.\n\nThe insider said at the time: “Liv wanted to go to LA to see her sister’s baby. But as they are not married, Dave was not able to enter the country because of the Covid-19 restrictions.\n\n“Liv and the children came back to the UK last week and they are back in their Cotswolds home.”\n\nBut some fans questioned the strength of the relationship when they noticed Liv posting videos and photos on social media with her giant engagement ring clearly missing.\n\nOn Tuesday, a source was claiming that the romance was all but over, telling The Sun: “Dave and Liv spent all of the first lockdown together and are a great team as parents but unfortunately, they've grown apart and increasingly they've been living separate lives.\n\n“Both wanted to focus on their careers — her acting and producing, and Dave running his business and working on David's Inter Miami football project.\n\n“They officially parted ways back in March but they've kept it quiet so as to minimise the fuss, and ensure their kids were OK.”\n\nLiv was previously married to British glam-rock singer Royston Langdon from 2003 until 2008.\n\nThe couple share a 16-year-old son named Milo who was born in December 2004.\n\nThe actress – who is the daughter of American rock legend Steven Tyler and singer Bebe Buell – has previously discussed how she struggles to date.\n\nShe told Tatler back in 2010 following the collapse of her marriage, and four years before she met Dave: \"I fall in love once in a blue moon.\n\n\"I wouldn't be capable of having a casual fling. I'm far too sensitive, and I just wouldn't have any pleasure from it.\""
