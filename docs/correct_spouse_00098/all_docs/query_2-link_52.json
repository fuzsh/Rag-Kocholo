        "text": "Liv Tyler is \"too sensitive\" for casual relationships.\n\nThe 32-year-old actress - who has a five-year-old son Milo with ex-husband Royston Langdon - has been single since splitting from the rocker in May 2008 and admits she rarely goes on dates because she worries about getting hurt.\n\nShe told Tatler magazine: \"I fall in love once in a blue moon.\n\n\"I wouldn't be capable of having a casual fling. I'm far too sensitive, and I just wouldn't have any pleasure from it.\"\n\nLiv has previously spoken about how separating from Royston made her feel physically ill.\n\nShe said: \"There's nothing worse than heartache, being lovesick. It's like there's a physical sickness. You go through a couple of weeks where you think, 'Oh, I'm OK, I feel better,' and then suddenly, out of nowhere, it hits you again.\n\n\"The hardest part is when they leave. It also brings up a lot of issues - you might feel like a failure, or like there is something wrong with you. You can't run away from yourself - you kind of have to just deal with it.\"\n\nBang Showbiz"
