        "text": "Aerosmith offspring Liv Tyler has revealed the only ‘healthy’ and ‘consistent’ male relationship in her life is with her son, as she admitted she is ‘mystified’ by men.\n\nThe Lord Of The Rings actress, who has nine-year-old son Milo with former husband, Brit musician Royston Langdon, said: ‘To have a son was huge for me, because it’s been the most solid, healthy, consistent relationship I’ve ever had with a male in my whole life.\n\n‘[Milo] just wants me to make him breakfast and walk him to school and read to him at night and help him with his homework – all the basic things that any child would want.’\n\nShe continued: ‘He couldn’t give a rat’s ass about me being famous or a movie star or anything. I learn so much from him.’\n\nThe 36-year-old, who only discovered rocker Steven Tyler was her father at the age of eight, has been left mystified by men after her unique upbringing.\n\n‘I was raised by the women in my life,’ she revealed in an interview with Net-a-Porter’s digital fashion magazine, The Edit.\n\n‘That’s made me incredibly strong and resilient. I’ve always been able to support myself and my family on my own.\n\n‘Men are a bit of a mystery to me in a way. They are visitors. They visit my life. I am always surprised when there is one around.’"
