Liv Tyler is the biological daughter of Aerosmith lead singer Steven Tyler. Liv Tyler is best known for her performance as Elf maiden Arwen Undómiel in the \"Lord of the Rings\" movie trilogy. She also earned acclaim for her roles in such films as \"Empire Records,\" \"Stealing Beauty,\" \"Cookie's Fortune,\" and \"Jersey Girl,\" among many others. On television, Tyler has starred on shows including \"The Leftovers,\" \"Harlots,\" and \"9-1-1: Lone Star.\"\n\nEarly Life and Career Beginnings\n\nLiv was born as Liv Rundgren on July 1, 1977 in New York City. At birth, her mother Bebe Buell claimed that Liv's father was musician Todd Rundgren. It would later be revealed that Liv's actual father was musician Steven Tyler. Liv was raised by Rundgren and Buell and only met her biological father when she was around 10, Her true parentage wasn't known by the public until 1991.\n\nTyler is of Italian, English, Ukrainian, and German descent, and has three half-siblings: Mia, Chelsea, and Taj.\n\nAs a youth, Tyler attended the Congressional Schools of Virginia, Breakwater School, and Waynflete School in Portland, Maine. Afterward, she returned with her mother to New York City, where she went to York Preparatory for junior high and high school. During this time, Tyler landed her first modeling job, and appeared in television commercials. However, she quickly grew bored of modeling, and decided to pursue a career in acting. In 1994, she made her feature film debut in the psychological thriller \"Silent Fall.\"\n\nFilm Career\n\nFollowing her debut, Tyler had significant roles in the 1995 films \"Empire Records\" and \"Heavy.\" Her breakthrough role, however, came the next year, when she played the character of Lucy Harmon in Bernardo Bertolucci's arthouse drama \"Stealing Beauty.\" Also that year, Tyler was in the Tom Hanks comedy \"That Thing You Do!,\" about a fictional one-hit wonder rock band. The actress followed this with the coming-of-age film \"Inventing the Abbotts,\" costarring Joaquin Phoenix and Jennifer Connelly. Tyler's biggest commercial success thus far came in 1998, when she played the love interest of Ben Affleck's character in Michael Bay's blockbuster science-fiction film \"Armageddon.\" The movie, which grossed over $550 million worldwide, also featured an Oscar-nominated song by Aerosmith. Tyler closed out the decade with turns in the historical comedy \"Plunkett & Macleane,\" Robert Altman's ensemble comedy \"Cookie's Fortune,\" and the romantic drama \"Onegin,\" based on Alexander Pushkin's novel.\n\nIn 2000, Tyler reunited with director Robert Altman for \"Dr. T & the Women,\" a romantic comedy costarring Richard Gere, Helen Hunt, Farrah Fawcett, Shelley Long, and Kate Hudson.

Also that year, Tyler had her most famous role yet in Peter Jackson's critically acclaimed \"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring,\" playing Elf maiden Arwen Undómiel. She reprised the role in the film's two sequels in 2002 and 2003. Following this success, Tyler re-teamed with her \"Armageddon\" costar Ben Affleck in the romantic comedy \"Jersey Girl.\" She was subsequently in \"Lonesome Jim,\" \"Reign Over Me,\" and \"Smother.\" Tyler's later credits have included the horror film \"The Strangers,\" the superhero film \"The Incredible Hulk,\" the thriller \"The Ledge,\" the supernatural horror drama \"Jamie Marks is Dead,\" the horror fantasy \"Wilding,\" and the science-fiction film \"Ad Astra.\"\n\nTelevision Career\n\nOn the small screen, Tyler had a main role on the HBO supernatural drama series \"The Leftovers,\" which ran from 2014 to 2017. Following this, she landed the role of Anne Vaux on the British historical miniseries \"Gunpowder,\" costarring Kit Harrington. Tyler then joined the second and third seasons of the Hulu period drama series \"Harlots,\" playing one of the main characters, Lady Isabella Fitzwilliam. Later, in 2020, Tyler began a starring role on the Fox procedural drama series \"9-1-1: Lone Star,\" a spinoff of Fox's \"9-1-1\" that takes place in Austin, Texas.\n\nMusic Career\n\nAs a teenager, Tyler appeared in Aerosmith's music video for the song \"Crazy.\" Later, as an adult, she served as a guest vocalist on the Lemonheads' 2009 album \"Varshons,\" and appeared on the 2017 bonus disk of Evan Dando's album \"Baby I'm Bored.\" In 2011, Tyler released a cover version of INXS' \"Need You Tonight,\" which was produced from a collaboration between Sony Music and Givenchy perfumes. For the latter brand, Tyler served as a spokesperson for several years.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nFrom 1995 to 1998, Tyler dated her \"Inventing the Abbotts\" costar Joaquin Phoenix. Afterward, she started seeing musician Royston Langdon, whom she married in 2003. The couple had a son the following year, and separated in 2008.

Together, they have two children: son Sailor Gene and daughter Lula Rose.\n\nActivism\n\nAn active supporter of the United Nations Children's Fund, Tyler has served as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador since 2003. She also regularly donates to the Women's Cancer Research Fund, and, in 2007, launched the Emergen-C Pink energy drink with her mother Bebe and grandmother Dorothea. The drink was intended to honor Breast Cancer Awareness month.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2003, Liv paid $2.53 million for a four-bedroom brownstone in New York City's West Village. She sold the home in November 2019 for $17.45 million.\n\nShe and her partner, sports agent Dave Gardner, primarily live in West London, where they own a $12.45 million townhouse.\n\nAdditionally, Tyler owns a home in Malibu, California."
