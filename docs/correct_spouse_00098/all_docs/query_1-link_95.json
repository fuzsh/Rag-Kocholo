        "text": "Liv Tyler is expecting another baby, but with whom? The actress already has a nine-year-old son, Milo, with former husband, Royston Langdon. But right now, she has only been seen casually with rumored boyfriend, Dave Gardner.\n\nLiv Tyler: Issues from an absent father >>\n\nTyler has yet to confirm the baby news, but according to E! News, multiple sources have confirmed the pregnancy. Tyler has also been spotted out on numerous recent occasions, either covering up her tummy or showing a pretty obvious baby bump.\n\nTyler’s five-year marriage to British musician, Langdon, ended in 2008, and Tyler seems to have been focusing on her son and her career ever since. Recently, she has been spotted out with Dave Gardner, a friend of David Beckham’s, holding hands and kissing on many different occasions — including on a romantic getaway to Formentera, Spain. They were reportedly set up by supermodel, Kate Moss, according to a friend, and have “been seeing each other for three months or so.”\n\nTyler’s father, Aerosmith’s Steven Tyler, is also yet to comment on his next grandchild, but Liv Tyler recently said her daddy issues have affected her relationships in life.\n\n“[Men] are visitors. They visit my life. I am always surprised when there is one around,” she told Net-a-Porter’s The Edit.\n\nCelebrities who need to star in a movie together >>\n\nHopefully, Gardner will be more than a visitor for Tyler this time.\n\n“They get on very well and are really enjoying spending time together,” her friend explained. “He flies to New York mostly to see her and they feel very comfortable together.\n\n“He is very charismatic and a real gentleman and she appreciates that about him.”\n\nIf Gardner is indeed the dad, Tyler’s baby will be joining her son, Milo, and also Gardner’s two children from a previous marriage."
