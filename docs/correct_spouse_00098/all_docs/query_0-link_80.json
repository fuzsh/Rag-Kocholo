Hot sibling Paul Sevigny will take a night off from his duties at Beatrice Inn (the new Bungalow 8, and just as silly-willy-Wonka!) to D.J. Anyone else miss the name Spacehog? Moving on to Brian Williams (and when aren’t we?), the NBC News anchor will be bringing “the beach to the streets” (yeowza!) at a Children’s Museum of the East End benefit at Cipriani. That’s right—if you thought April sucks the big one, just remember that Hamptons season is right around the corner. It’s like an all-summer circus, where the clowns have millions of dollars, no real friends and substance-abuse issues! Meanwhile, for our money, the wackiest event of the week comes right on in at the end, as Donny Osmond takes the stage at Feinstein’s at the Regency for a five-day stay performing love songs from the ’70s. Fingers crossed for “Muskrat Love”! Mitt Romney watch in full effect.\n\nSign Up For Our Daily Newsletter\n\nThank you for signing up!\n\nBy clicking submit, you agree to our <a href=\"http://observermedia.com/terms\">terms of service</a> and acknowledge we may use your information to send you emails, product samples, and promotions on this website and other properties.
