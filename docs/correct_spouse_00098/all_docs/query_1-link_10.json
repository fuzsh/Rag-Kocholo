        "meta_description": "The 90s were good to Royston Langdon. His band hit it big in 1996 with their #1 smash \"In The Meantime\" off their debut album Resident Alien. He also married actress Liv Tyler. But after two more Spacehog albums, the band came apart and was never the same. Over the years there have been a couple reunions, but today Royston is focusing on his solo career and released his first solo album Everything's Dandy under the moniker LEEDS (the album we be re-released under his own name soon). And, congratulations are in order as he was recently selected as the opening act for the Psychedelic Furs on their upcoming US tour! Here we talk about what rock stardom really means, the influence of Bowie on Spacehog's music, and how he almost replaced Scott Weiland in Velvet Revolver. It gets deep! \n \nhttps://www.roystonlangdon.com/",
