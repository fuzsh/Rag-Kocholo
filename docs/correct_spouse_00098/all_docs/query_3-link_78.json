        "text": "Royston William Langdon is a British musician currently affiliated with the alternative rock band Spacehog. He is their lead singer and bassist. After starting singing as part of the local church choir, he joined the band his brother formed in New York in 1994. A year later, they released their debut album ‘Resident Alien’ through Sire Records. A huge success, the album spawned the youth anthem ‘In the Meantime’. They would go on to put out two more albums: ‘The Chinese Album’ in 1998 and ‘The Hogyssey’ in 2001. The group split in 2002 and Langdon, along with his brothers Anthony and Christian, and Jonny Cragg formed the new group Arckid in 2005. They were active for the next three years, releasing several singles. Spacehog eventually reunited in 2008 and put out their most recent album, ‘As It Is on Earth’ in 2013."
