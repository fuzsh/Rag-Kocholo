        "text": "On Monday we reported that Liv Tyler was overheard talking to a lawyer about possibly divorcing her husband of five years, British musician Royston Langdon. Us Weekly, which first reported the story, said Tyler was overheard complaining that Langdon was a “leech” on her assets. The couple have since officially split.\n\nLiv Tyler and her husband, British rocker Royston Langdon, have decided to separate, her rep confirms to PEOPLE.\n\n“Liv Tyler and Royston Langdon have confirmed their separation. They remain good friends and devoted parents to their son Milo and are requesting that their family’s privacy be respected at this time.”\n\nTyler, 30, and Langdon, 36, wed in 2003 in a private ceremony at a villa in the Caribbean. Their son Milo was born in December 2004.\n\n[From People]\n\nWhat a sad story. Somehow they always seemed like a fairly happy couple to me. Probably because they lived a pretty regular life. You didn’t see them at every party and opening, and they both seemed pretty devoted to their son. Hopefully they’ll manage to have an amicable relationship after this, and still be great parents.\n\nLiv and Royston are shown on 3/25/07 at Elton John’s birthday party, thanks to WENN. Liv is shown below at the Costume Institute Gala on Monday. Several sources reported that she wasn’t wearing her wedding ring. Thanks to PRPhotos."
