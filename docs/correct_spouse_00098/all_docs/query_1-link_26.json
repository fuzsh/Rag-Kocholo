        "text": "Liv Tyler doesn't think family life can ''flourish'' if you focus on your career.\n\nThe 36-year-old star - who is the daughter of Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler and raises 10-year-old son Milo with ex-husband Royston Langdon - believes it is impossible to perfectly balance a personal and professional life and one will always suffer at the expense of the other.\n\nShe told U.K.'s Red magazine: ''Perhaps I shouldn't think this way but, from a very young age, I had this idea in my head...\n\n''That if you are very successful in your career and you're giving all of your attention to that, then your family life will not ... I need to word this in the right way....\n\n''The life of your family possibly won't flourish as it might. But when you focus on your family and you put that first, then your career suffers in some sort of way.\n\n''I can live with the career part not going so well, I think, but I don't think I could live with my family not.''\n\nLiv admires her A-List pals, designer Stella McCartney and actress Gwyneth Paltrow - who has kids Apple, nine, and Moses, eight, with estranged husband Chris Martin - for the way they have managed to strike a healthy balance between work and motherhood.\n\nShe added: ''I see Stella [McCartney] whenever she's here, and we have a weird, crazy conversation, say 'I love you' and then she's jetting off back to London.\n\n''She's got four kids, and a million businesses. And Gwyneth's just really good at everything. She's very organised, whereas I'm far more sensitive and adaptable.\n\n''She's good at structure and routine and schedules, whereas I get lost all the time. I'm always late and always rushing.''"
