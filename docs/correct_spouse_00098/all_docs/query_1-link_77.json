        "text": "Liv Tyler is engaged to David Gardner.\n\nThe 'Leftovers' actress, who has seven-month-old son Sailor with the British sports agent, is reportedly set to wed for the second time after secretly accepting his proposal last December.\n\nA source close to the couple told UsMagazine.com: ''They have been [engaged] since last Christmas but prefer to be private. She's been wearing the ring.''\n\nThe 38-year-old actress - who also has son Milo, 10, with ex-husband Royston Langdon - recently admitted she was open to getting married again.\n\nShe said: ''I had this philosophy that you should only get married once. But then, of course, that changes. I definitely believe we have lessons we learn through our relationships. You're meant to work through and mirror each other. It's the thing in someone that drives you the most crazy that is maybe a part of yourself somewhere.''\n\nLiv and David, who also has another son, Grey, seven, with ex-wife Davinia Taylor, currently divide their time between her home in New York City, his base in London and Austin, Texas, where she films her HBO series, but hope to be more settled in the future.\n\nThe brunette beauty said: ''We're doing everything we can to be together, but right now because of work we're going back and forth.''"
