        "text": "Lively lyrical showman, multi-instrumentalist and skilled songwriter Royston Langdon found fame as lead vocalist and bassist with glam rock band Spacehog. Almost three decades on from charting with Spacehog’s hit track ‘In the Meantime’, Langdon’s flame still burns brightly and in 2021 he dropped the critically acclaimed six-track EP Chains. Showing just how far he has evolved gracefully as an artist from his spaced-out glam rock days of the 1990s, the EP explores a number of genres and also features the talents of Apples in Stereo and Lemonheads producer Bryce Goggin and former Jeff Buckley drummer Parker Kindred.\n\nHailing from Leeds, West Yorkshire, the multi-instrumentalist/vocalist was influenced heavily by the glam rock of the 1970s and chose music as his career path after seeing iconic rockers Queen performing live. Langdon had already begun singing with his older brother at Leeds Parish Church choir when he was 7, and by the time he reached his teens the brothers had already been involved in several band projects. When he was 19 years old Royston moved to New York City and began working as an intern at Baby Monster Studios where he met producer Bryce Goggin. The pair struck up a friendship and Goggin later produced Spacehog debut ‘In the Meantime’.\n\nAfter a series of critically acclaimed albums the members of Spacehog went their separate ways, but Landon has continued to work on his impressive solo music. 2021 EP Chains has shown that Landon remains in top form and is a promising preview of something much bigger to come."
