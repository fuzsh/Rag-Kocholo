        "text": "Lord of the Rings beauty Liv Tyler says she didn't believe in marriage until she met her husband - British rocker Royston Langdon.\n\nWith Aerosmith frontman Steve Tyler as her dad and former Playboy model Bebe Buell (who counts Mick Jagger and Rod Stewart amongst her exes) her mum, Liv's genes practically make her rock royalty. But her colourful family life, Tyler tells the latest issue of InStyle magazine, didn't give her much belief in the institution of marriage.\n\n\"I knew I wanted love in my life, but I didn't really believe in marriage in a lot of ways, because I don't believe in divorce,\" she tells the magazine.\n\n\"But as soon as I met Roy, I thought about it. You just know when he's the one.\"\n\nThe couple met in 1998 after Tyler split with long-time lover, actor Joaquin Phoenix. Landon proposed three years later - on Valentine's Day.\n\n\"He was very romantic about it,\" she says. \"He called my dad and asked his permission, which my dad loved.\"\n\nThe pair decided to have two weddings.\"Roy and I are very shy people in a lot of ways,\" Tyler says, \"so the most important thing for us was that it was really intimate. \" They tied the knot in a tiny candlelit ceremony last March at a beach house in Barbados and, a month later, held a New York bash for about 100 guests, at which friends and family, including Tyler's parents, Langdon's brother and Spacehog bandmate Antony, and singer Evan Dando, took turns singing. The wedding reception brought Tyler's two dads together - biological dad Steve and the man she thought was her father until the age of nine, Todd Rundgren. All of the parents brought their current spouses to the extended family bash.\n\nNowadays the couple share domestic bliss at their new home in New York, and Tyler's star is rising in Hollywood. From wowing movie fans around the world as Arwen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, we'll see her next on Australian screens with Ben Affleck in Jersey Girl. Tyler plays a video store assistant who helps a single father (Affleck) move on and find love again after the death of his wife (a cameo by Lopez).\n\n\"I feel hungrier than I ever have to find work I'm really passionate about,\" Tyler says in InStyle magazine. \"I feel like I've been holding a lot in for a long time, and I'm ready to let it out.\"\n\n\"My career has never been a calculated thing,\"she says. \"I wouldn't know how to live like that. I just follow my heart.\""
