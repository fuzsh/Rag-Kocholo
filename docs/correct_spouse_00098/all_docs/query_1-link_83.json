        "text": "When Kate Moss puts her mind to a task, she usually pulls it off with panache. So when she introduced her friends Liv Tyler and Dave Gardner she knew what she was doing. Only four months on, there have been rumours that the actress and the sports agent are expecting a baby. A friend has said: “This is the real deal. They are madly in love.” Their names may not work as a portmanteau — Div? Lave? — but they were inseparable at Nick Grimshaw’s 30th birthday party and have passed the time-honoured test of a relationship: a minibreak. They chose Formentera in the Balearics with Kate Moss as chaperone. Tyler likes British men — her ex-husband is Leeds man Royston Langdon, of the band Spacehog — and Gardner has worked in the US. But the longest romance of his life has been with one David Beckham, whom he met at just 14. So who is the man Tyler is taken with? We present Gardner’s question time.\n\nBack in 1991 two boys named David met on a Manchester United training pitch and they have never looked back. Beckham has said he only has three close friends and Gardner is definitely among that select group. He, Beckham’s best man, is godfather to Brooklyn and was chosen to accompany Goldenballs on his voyage of discovery in the Brazilian wilderness for the TV show Into the Unknown earlier this year. Scenes from that show were like an advert for male bonding, they drank Guinness, laughed like bandits and supported each other every step of the way.\n\nGardner had a promising start to his career, being picked as one of Fergie’s fledglings in the Manchester United youth team. But while buddy Beckham rose up, Gardner didn’t make the grade and left in 1995 at just 19. But he wasn’t too crushed by the rejection and soon set up Elite Sport Agency with Jason Ferguson, son of Sir Alex. With connections such as theirs they became serious playmakers, especially at Old Trafford where they collected a generous slice of the millions of pounds paid in agents’ fees during each transfer.\n\nThere was a blip in 2004 when a Panorama documentary claimed Jason Ferguson had exploited his father’s position as Manchester United manager to set up transfer deals and gain financially from them. He was never found guilty of any wrongdoing — and eventually Gardner left and set up a solo operation and is still going strong.\n\nHis first serious rebound relationship was Stephanie Dorrance, ex-wife of Campbell soup heir John Dorrance. She was his plus one at Kate Moss’s wedding. Then there was Rita Ora. They hit it off before Valentine’s Day last year and had a spring romance with dates at Café Royal. A friend called Dave “a total breath of fresh air for Rita. He’s incredibly stable and shuns the limelight”. But all good things come to an end. She moved on to Calvin Harris.\n\nWhen you’re trying to make it as a designer, it can’t hurt to have supermodel Agyness Deyn as a chum. They met growing up in Ramsbottom, in Lancashire, and she was an early champion of his, wearing his brightly coloured slogan T-shirts everywhere until Holland became a household name in his own right."
