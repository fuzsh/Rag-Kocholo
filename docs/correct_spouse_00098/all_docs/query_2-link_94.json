        "text": "Tyler said of the break-up: \"There's nothing worse than heartache. It's like there is a physical sickness.\" Tyler is accustomed to unorthodox family set-ups. She discovered the identity of her father, Steve Tyler of the band Aerosmith, at the age of nine after she noticed a resemblance.\n\nBill Nighy told me at the premiere of his new film The Boat That Rocked how a great many young and attractive women come up to him these days. The 59-year-old actor added glumly that mostly they want to tell him how their mothers like him. Currently single, he has one piece of advice for other older men about how to go about the business of dating: keep your clothes on. \"The thing is only give the girls a bit of top on the first date â€“ one or two shirt buttons undone, no more than that,\" he said, sagely. \"If you start to show them too much of your body too early on, take it from me, you will never see hide nor hair of them again.\"\n\nJust a few days after she sprained her ankle severely in a fall as she left Wyndham's Theatre where she is appearing in Madame de Sade, Dame Judi Dench was on stage again last night, albeit with a stick. Her doctor would have liked her to rest a couple more nights, but, with her name up in lights outside, the 74-year-old actress was determined not to disappoint the punters. The enormous court dresses she has to wear would test the stamina of a woman half her age, even on two good legs. \"We're having too much fun in this play,\" says Dame Judi. \"No one could have kept me away.\""
