        "text": "Post by AeroCooper on\n\n'I've got jowls like my father': Liv Tyler, 36, says she’s taking after Aerosmith rocker Steven as she opens up about ageing process\n\nBy Georgia Hart\n\nPublished: 22:52 EST, 7 June 2014 | Updated: 07:38 EST, 8 June 2014\n\nLiv Tyler says she's becoming more like her father everyday.\n\nThe 36-year-old recently admitted in an interview that she believes she is getting 'jowls' just like her famous rocker dad Steven Tyler.\n\nBut the Empire Records actress is enjoying the process of ageing, claiming she has grown more comfortable in her own skin.\n\nLiv talked to the July issue of Glamour magazine about body image; something she has surely had to deal with a lot with her position in the limelight.\n\n'If you're curvy, you wish you were skinny. If you're short, you wish you were tall,' she said. 'And I think as you get older, you learn to appreciate your looks because it's sort of silly to be against of yourself all the time.'\n\nLiv's famous father Steven, 66, has a very recognizable face of course, and she says that she's picked up some of his physical traits.\n\nTelling the publication that she's noticed changes in her face this year, she referenced the skin on her cheeks, saying: 'The jowls I got from my dad seem more pronounced.'\n\n'I've got a couple of grey hairs,' she added. 'But I've noticed that when I'm happy and healthy on the inside - eating well, laughing with my best friend - I feel more beautiful on the outside.'\n\nShe also opened up about her 'painful' divorce from ex-husband Royston Langdon during the interview.\n\nThe Armageddon actress described her transition from being married to single as 'very challenging.'\n\n'The whole experience of divorce is painful,' she said. 'It's so complex. It's not like it happens, then suddenly one day it's all better.'\n\n'It's a process, ever-changing,' the actress explained, but added that she and Royston have remained close in spite of their marriage dissolution in 2008, in the name of their child, Milo.\n\n'We're still a family because we have Milo together,' she told the magazine. 'No matter what else is going on in our lives, the [two] of us are a unit as parents.'\n\nLiv has recently made the move from film to television, and she also discussed that transition.\n\n'It's a bit trickier than I'd anticipated,' she admitted.\n\n'In a movie you know the beginning, middle and end. You know your schedule. With television you're getting to know a character as time goes by. You never know when you're going to be working.'\n\nBut the mix-up is not getting the actress down.\n\n'I had to learn to be comfortable being uncomfortable,' Liv said, referencing this 'incredible conclusion' she came to.\n\nThe actress is currently working on HBO series The Leftovers.\n\nRead more: www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2651775/Liv-Tyler-36-opens-changing-body-shape-process-ageing.html#ixzz344vwK7UK\n\nFollow us: @mailonline on Twitter | DailyMail on Facebook"
