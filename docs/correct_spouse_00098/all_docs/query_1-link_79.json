        "text": "Liv Tyler has welcomed a beautiful baby boy to the world with partner Dave Gardner.\n\nLiv, 37, and Dave welcomed their little bundle of joy on Wednesday, six and a half weeks earlier than her due date, with her representative confirming the news to People magazine.\n\n“He’s healthy and everyone is very happy,” the rep said.\n\nThe baby boy was six and a half weeks early and will need to remain in the hospital for some time.\n\nWhile this is the first child that Liv and Dave have together, they each already have a child from previous marriages.\n\nLiv has a Milo,10, with her ex-husband, British rocker Royston Langdon, while Dave also has a son, seven-year-old Grey, by his ex-wife Davinia Taylor.\n\nDave, another Brit, is a sports agent and social high-flyer who is also best pals with David Beckham.\n\nThe pair were introduced by their mutual friend supermodel Kate Moss and were seen holidaying together with Kate and her hubby Jamie Hince in Spain earlier in Liv’s pregnancy.\n\nLiv seemed very eager to conceal her growing bump in the early days until sources confirmed that she was expecting in September.\n\nSince then, as her baby bump has grown, Liv has shared many snaps of her pregnant body on Instagram and even commissioned her friend, artist and star of TV show Girls, Jemima Kirke, to paint a portrait of her while pregnant.\n\nClick through the gallery to see the cute couple and their pregnancy snaps!"
