        "text": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liv_Tyler\n\nLiv Rundgren Tyler (born Liv Rundgren; July 1, 1977) is an American actress and former child model. She is the daughter of Aerosmith's lead singer Steven Tyler and model Bebe Buell. Tyler achieved international recognition as a result of her portrayal of the Elf maiden Arwen Undómiel in the Sir Peter Jackson film trilogy Lord of the Rings (2001–2003).\n\nTyler began a career in modeling at the age of 14 but, after less than a year, she decided to focus on acting. After her film debut Silent Fall (1994), she appeared in supporting roles in Empire Records (1995), Heavy (1996) and That Thing You Do! (1996). Tyler later achieved critical recognition in the leading role in Bernardo Bertolucci's Stealing Beauty (1996), playing a teenage girl visiting her deceased mother's artist friends in Italy. She followed this by appearing in supporting roles including Inventing the Abbotts (1997) and Robert Altman's black comedy Cookie's Fortune (1999). She also appeared in the big-budget studio film Armageddon (1998) where she played the daughter of Bruce Willis' character and love interest of Ben Affleck's character. She has appeared in an eclectic range of films, including the 2004 comedy Jersey Girl, the indie film Lonesome Jim (2005), the drama Reign Over Me (2007), the home invasion horror film The Strangers (2008) and The Incredible Hulk (2008).\n\nIn 2014, Tyler made her television debut on the HBO series The Leftovers in a recurring role.\n\nShe has served as a United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Goodwill Ambassador for the United States in 2003, and as a spokesperson for Givenchy's line of perfume and cosmetics.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000239/bio\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000239/bio#trivia\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000239/?ref_=nmbio_bio_nm\n\nActress Liv Tyler appeared in an eclectic range of films, including Stealing Beauty, That Think You Do!, Inventing the Abbotts and big-budget studio film Armageddon before she achieved international recognition as a result of her portrayal of Elf maiden Arwen Undómiel in the Lord of the Rings film trilogy. Since 2003, Tyler has served as a United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) Goodwill Ambassador for the United States, and as a spokesperson for Givenchy's line of perfume and cosmetics.\n\nShe is the daughter of Aerosmith's lead singer, Steven Tyler, and Bebe Buell, model and singer. At birth, Buell claimed that rock star Todd Rundgren was Tyler's biological father. She discovered that she was Steven Tyler's daughter after he began dropping by to visit, and she noticed that his daughter Mia Tyler looked enough like her to be her twin. She confronted her mother, and was told the truth; by the time she was 12, she had taken her father's name.\n\nTyler began a career in modeling at the age of 14, but after less than a year she decided to focus on acting. She made her film debut in the 1994 film Silent Fall. While that film received mixed reviews, Tyler received a huge career boost from her appearance in Aerosmith music video for the song “Crazy” around this time. She then appeared in supporting role in the 1995 movie Empire Records. Her 1995 role as a waitress named Callie in the independent film Heavy earned her praise for her performance. Tyler later achieved critical recognition in the leading role Stealing Beauty (1996). Tyler also found box office success with the nostalgic 1960s rock film That Thing You Do (1996) with Tom Hanks and Armageddon (1998) with Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck.\n\nPerhaps the most magical performance of her career so far has been as Arwen, an elf who falls in love with a human, Aragon, played by Viggo Mortensen, in the Lord of the Rings film trilogy: The Fellowship of the Rings (2001), The Two Towers (2002), and The Return of the King (2003). Based on the books by J. R. R. Tolkien, the film series scored at the box office and became an international phenomenon.\n\nIn 2007, she resurfaced with several new projects, including Reign Over Me with Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. Following Reign Over Me, she starred in the horror-thriller The Strangers with Scott Speedman, a film about a young couple who are terrorized one night by three masked assailants in their remote country house. Then she appeared in The Incredible Hulk (2008), in which she played Dr. Betty Ross, the love interest of the title character, played by Edward Norton. The Incredible Hulk was a box office success, earning over $262 million worldwide. The Washington Post, in review of the film, wrote: \"Tyler gives Betty an appropriately angelic nimbus of ethereal gentleness as the one Beauty who can tame the Beast ... during their most pivotal encounters.\"\n\nTyler married English musician-singer Royston Langdon in 2003. The next year, the couple welcomed a son named Milo born December 14, 2004. She kept a low profile for a while, spending most of her time with her family. The couple announced their separation in May 2008."
