        "text": "People Magazine has excerpts from an interview with Liv Tyler recently published in the UK edition of Marie Claire. The 31 year-old actress and mother of one speaks candidly about trying to find her way as she goes through a divorce from her first husband, British rocker Royston Langdon. Langdon and Tyler remain committed parents to their son Milo, who turns four in December. Tyler says she’s not ready to date again and that she’s just working through the pain of dealing with the loss of her five year marriage:\n\nComing to terms with the end of her five-year marriage has not been easy for the actress, despite her seemingly serene nature. “I don’t feel calm and collected. I feel neurotic, like Woody Allen,” says Tyler, 31. “I’m a Cancer and sometimes I just feel like a crab without a shell.”\n\nTyler who lives in New York City with the couple’s three-year-old son Milo, has her own theory when it comes to healing. “I am trying to just let myself feel it,” she says. “I think you have to mourn and you have to feel that pain.”\n\nFor now, dating remains far from Tyler’s mind. In fact, the actress says she can’t even remember the last time she had a romantic kiss. “I kiss Milo on the lips all the time but I haven’t had a kiss kiss for a very long time,” she reveals.\n\nOn what lies ahead for the actress, Tyler says she is optimistic: “I’m trying to just take one day at a time and be the best mom I can – but it is a strange time, like walking down the road with nowhere to go … We’ll see where it takes me.”\n\n[From People]\n\nI really like Tyler and think she comes across as a kind, genuine person. I hope that she’s able to get through this difficult time in her life and move forward to a happier place, whether that involves another man or not. Tyler doesn’t have another movie in the works, according to IMDB, which may have motivated her to speak to Marie Claire and be bit more candid about what she’s going through in order to get more press. She doesn’t strike me as the type to manipulate the media, but she probably knows what she’s doing when she opens up to a magazine. She seems able to keep her distance and speak in general terms if she wants to, unlike other stars trying to promote their new country albums who just can’t stop talking about their personal lives every minute they’re handed a microphone. Yes, the unnamed but obvious woman I’m referencing is starting to bug the shit out of me with her constant blathering. Tyler, on the other hand, gets our attention for some well-placed tidbits about her life. She knows when to show some skin and when to cover it up."
