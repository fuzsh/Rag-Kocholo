        "text": "The luscious-lipped Liv Tyler (gee, wonder she got those from?) has announced her separation from her husband of five years and longtime boyfriend Royston Langdon, currently of the band Arckid but best known for helming ’90s alt outfit Spacehog. I used to see this dude on the street all the time, and I gotta tell ya, he really pulled a fast one on Liv and ended up with a sweet deal.\n\nHere’s the video for Spacehog’s biggest hit, “In the Meantime.” Not metal, but an awesome song nonetheless, and the album from whence it came, Resident Alien, surprisingly backed it up with good tunes as I discovered when I bought it on an eBay rampage a few years back.\n\nSo anyway, dudes, Liv Tyler is available! Now’s your chance.\n\n-VN"
