        "text": "Liv Tyler, best known as the elf queen Arwen in \"The Lord of the Rings\" series, has a new role as the \"Very Irresistible\" face of a new Givenchy fragrance.\n\nAfter taking two years off to spend time with her husband, musician Royston Langdon, and their son Milo, born in 2004, Tyler also is set to appear in a string of new films-including an upcoming movie remake of \"The Incredible Hulk.\"\n\nIn that movie, Tyler plays the one true love of the \"Hulk,\" but it wasn't a dress-up role. \"I literally wear the same shirt and jeans for pretty much the whole movie,\" she said, \"so it's so wonderful to get to go and do a shoot for a day and wear beautiful clothes and have your hair and make-up done.\"\n\nThe shoot for \"Very Irresistible Givenchy\" sounds a bit easier than shooting a stunt-filled action movie. \"We were in L.A. and they had this idea of me (being) very free -- me laughing and smiling and jumping on a bed,\" Tyler says, \"so I basically jumped on a bed for five hours straight listening to The White Stripes.\""
