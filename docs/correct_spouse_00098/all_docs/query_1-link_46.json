        "text": "Background\n\nLiv Rundgren, better known in show business as Liv Tyler, is an American actress born on July 1, 1977. She is the daughter of former model Beverle Lorence Buell and Steven Victor Tallarico, better known as Steven Tyler, the musician and famous singer of the band Aerosmith.\n\nDespite being born in New York, she spent her childhood in Portland, Maine. However, at the age of 14, she returned to her hometown to follow in her mother’s footsteps and began to work as a model, this being one of the first jobs that would make her way into the world of stardom.\n\nAfter gaining success in the world of modeling, she began to conquer the world of entertainment. She started participating in several television commercials and these two experiences opened a space for her in the music video “Crazy” by the band Aerosmith.\n\nAppearing in the video of this famous musical band completely opened the doors for her to participate in film projects such as “Armageddon,” “Heavy,” “Silent Fall,” and “The Incredible Hulk”, among others. Although she played a secondary role in these projects, it served as an experience to be able to star in the film “Stealing Beauty.”\n\nHer talent as an actress has been recognized several times, in 1999 she won her award for best foreign actress in the Russian Film Critics Guild thanks to her performance in the film “Onegin.”\n\nHowever, her success as an entertainment woman did not stop her from having a happy and private life. In 2001, she got engaged to a musician whom she dated for three years, Royston Langdon. Two years later they got married and a short time after that, they had their first child, Milo William Langdon.\n\nAlthough they lived a very happy married life, they divorced in 2008. However, in 2014 she felt the happiness of being a mother again after David Gardner gave her her second child, Sailor Gene Gardner. The relationship between these two ended in 2021."
