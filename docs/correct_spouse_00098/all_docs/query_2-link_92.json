        "text": "Liv Tyler\n\nLiv Tyler Date of Birth July 1, and it means that she was born under zodiacal sign of Cancer.\n\nLiv Rundgren was born on July 1, 1977 in Portland, USA. Her Mother - Bebe Buell - used to be a model and in her younger years actively dated various rock musicians. Liv was growing up absolutely sure that her father was a rock stage star Todd Rundgren. The truth was revealed when the girl was already 10 years old. Steven Tyler was frequently visiting Liv's mother and soon the resemblance between Liv and Steven as well as with his second daughter became too obvious. After finding out the real story of how she came into this world, at the age of 12 Liv changed her last name to Tyler.\n\nLiv first drew attention to herself when she and Alicia Silverstone appeared in the video for the song \"Crazy\" by Aerosmith. This video kept on top of MTV charts for a long time and millions of teens all around the world were crazy about the two girls from the video.\n\nLiv's debut on a big screen was her part in Bruce Beresford's Silent Fall (1994). Her acting in the movie Heavy received positive reviews and the film by Bernardo Bertolucci Stealing Beauty (1996) was considered the young actress' breakthrough.\n\nNext there were a few secondary and lead roles in Inventing the Abbotts (1997), U Turn (1997) and several other movies. In 1998 Liv Tyler played Bruce Willis' daughter and Ben Affleck's girl-friend in the commercial blockbuster of the year Armageddon.\n\nNext few movies were hardly commercially successful, but some received positive reviews of the critics. In 1999 two historical movies came out - Plinkett & Macleane and Onegin by Martha Fines (and thanks to Alexander Pushkin's input ) where the actress played Tatiana Larina.\n\nRoyston Langdon"
