Liv Tyler, the Hollywood actress, has married her British boyfriend Royston Langdon.

The couple married in a private ceremony at a villa in the Caribbean on March 25 - despite rumours that they were planning to wed in Langdon's native Leeds.

Tyler, the 25-year-old star of Lord of the Rings, and Langdon, 30, have been together for more than four years.

They plan to hold a small reception for family and friends next month in New York, where they have set up home, according to Tyler's spokesman.

The couple met in the US where Langdon, the lead singer for the rock bank Spacehog, has lived for the past eight years.

He moved to New York to live with his brother Antony, now also a member of Spacehog. They began dating in 1998 and Langdon proposed over dinner on Valentine's Day 2001.

Tyler, the daughter of Aerosmith's singer Steve Tyler, has made frequent trips to Leeds to visit the Langdons - sparking rumours that she would choose to marry in the West Yorkshire city.

"I love Leeds and the area around it," she said. "I love the Roman ruins and rolling hills. It is so beautiful. I've also become a big fan of Yorkshire pudding."
