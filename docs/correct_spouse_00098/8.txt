On Monday we reported that Liv Tyler was overheard talking to a lawyer about possibly divorcing her husband of five years, British musician Royston Langdon. Us Weekly, which first reported the story, said Tyler was overheard complaining that Langdon was a âleechâ on her assets. The couple have since officially split.

Liv Tyler and her husband, British rocker Royston Langdon, have decided to separate, her rep confirms to PEOPLE.

“Liv Tyler and Royston Langdon have confirmed their separation. They remain good friends and devoted parents to their son Milo and are requesting that their family’s privacy be respected at this time.”

Tyler, 30, and Langdon, 36, wed in 2003 in a private ceremony at a villa in the Caribbean. Their son Milo was born in December 2004.

What a sad story. Somehow they always seemed like a fairly happy couple to me. Probably because they lived a pretty regular life. You didnât see them at every party and opening, and they both seemed pretty devoted to their son. Hopefully theyâll manage to have an amicable relationship after this, and still be great parents.
