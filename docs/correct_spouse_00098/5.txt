Hollywood actress Liv Tyler has tied the knot with her British boyfriend Royston Langdon.

The couple married in a private ceremony at a villa in the Caribbean on March 25 - despite rumours that they were planning to wed in Langdon's native Leeds.

Lord of the Rings star Tyler, 25, and 30-year-old Langdon, lead singer with rock band Spacehog, met in the US and have been together for more than four years.

They plan to hold a small reception for family and friends next month.
