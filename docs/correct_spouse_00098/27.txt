Liv Tyler and husband Royston Langdon are splitting up. Tyler's rep told People, "Liv Tyler and Royston Langdon have confirmed their separation. They remain good friends and devoted parents to their son Milo and are requesting that their family's privacy be respected at this time." The pair married in 2003, and had Milo in December 2004. Langdon is a British rock artist. Rumors about their separation have been circulating, reaching fever pitch after Monday's Costume gala in New York, where Tyler was seen without her wedding ring. - Anna Dimond
