Liv Tyler, who's been with rocker Royston Langdon for nine years and married for five, is reportedly considering splitting from the man whom she considers (again, reportedly) a "leech" on her assets, Us magazine reports in its new issue.

Tyler, who starred as the elvish princess in "The Lord of the Rings" trilogies (and who is the daughter of Aerosmith's Steven Tyler), was overhead talking to her lawyer about getting a divorce without giving up much of her money. The magazine also reports that the actress, who has a son with Langdon, was spotted last month hunting for townhouses alone in New York's West Village.
