Hollywood actress Liv Tyler and her husband, British rocker Royston Langdon, have separated after five years of marriage, according to a report in People magazine.

Tyler, 30, who is the daughter of Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler, is best known for her role as the elf princess Arwen in the “The Lord of the Rings” movie trilogy.

“Liv Tyler and Royston Langdon have confirmed their separation. They remain good friends and devoted parents to their son Milo and are requesting that their family’s privacy be respected at this time,” Tyler’s representative told People.

Tyler and Langdon, 36, of the now defunct band Spacehog, were married in a private ceremony at a villa in the Caribbean in 2003. Their son, Milo, was born in December 2004.

New York-based Tyler stars in Marvel Studio’s “The Incredible Hulk,” due to be released in the United States next month. She plays the love interest to Dr. Bruce Banner, aka The Hulk.
