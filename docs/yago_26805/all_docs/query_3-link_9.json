        "text": "Film Projects - Cooler...\n\nBloody Mary\n\n...Announced mid-September 2000, Barker and Seraphim Films signed a deal with Disney's Touchstone Pictures to produce a movie inspired by a 1997 non-fiction article, 'Myths Over Miami', written by Lynda Edwards. This article documented urban legends told and retold in the homeless shelters of South Florida, and was originally published in the Miami New Times.\n\nTwo years on from that deal, after lingering at Touchstone, the movie was dropped - although Barker insisted that the project merely needed a more appropriate studio. By the summer of 2003, it looked like a home had been found for the movie with a small studio and hopes were raised for pre-production to start in 2004, but no sign of it just yet, and the 'Bloody Mary' which was created as the third in the Urban Legend series was unconnected with the Barker project... The screenplay, written by Silvio Horta (Urban Legend) concentrates on one particular urban legend, that of Bloody Mary, a monstrous, Everglades-based, vengeful bogeywoman who snatches the souls of children and lives in the supernatural plane between reality and illusion.\n\nThere's nothing new about the legend of Bloody Mary - you might come across her in the guise of Mary Whales or even Mary Queen of Scots! The name Mary Worth recurrs fairly often as a character whose face was so badly scarred that her spirit seeks vengeance by scratching off the face of her victims. Like any good urban legend, it moulds itself to it's teller and it's audience, but many of the tales based on the story of Mary Worth involve invoking her spirit by calling her name thirteen times before a mirror - just as in this draft screenplay for Candyman...\n\nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT\n\nBilly and Clara regard their reflections in the mirrored door of the medicine cabinet, arms around each other. They talk in whispers.\n\nCLARA : You ever heard of the Candyman?\n\nBILLY : No.\n\nCLARA : His right hand is sawn off. he has a hook jammed in the bloody stump. If you look in the mirror and say his name thirteen times, he'll appear behind you...\n\n(nibbles his ear)\n\nbreathing down your neck.\n\n(Billy grins.)\n\nWanna try it?\n\nBILLY : OK...Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman,\n\n(he counts them off on his fingers)\n\nCandyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman, Candyman,\n\n(the thirteenth time)\n\nCan... Billy pauses, Clara laughs.\n\nCLARA : No one ever got past twelve!\n\nBy Bernard Rose - May 1991 draft\n\n...The storyline for the planned movie centres on a young man forced to do community service at a homeless shelter in Miami. There he befriends a group of children whose visions of demons seeping up from hell may or may not be real...\n\n\"Fantasy works best when it's working on a lot of levels, [when] something has you really wondering, 'Is it real, or isn't it?'. These homeless kids are living in a world that's on that borderline, because they are living through the reality of social evils and abuse. What I wanted to do was to use the conventions of urban myth to express our anxieties about the real world.\n\n\"This is not going to be a Hellraiser or a Candyman; as a 48 year-old man, I just don't make those kinds of pictures anymore. That sort of in-your-face gore is a young man's game.\n\n\"We're not responding to the pressure coming out of Washington. This is going to be suspenseful and scary, but it's an aesthetic decision that it not be violent and gory...\"\n\nLatest Hollywood Script Deals\n\nBy [ ], Variety, 21 September 2000\n\n\"There was an article in the Miami New Times by journalist Lynda Edwards, called 'Myths Over Miami.' It was about the children of the city, particularly the homeless and poor, and how their imaginations have cooked up a curious mixture of urban legend, Catholicism and childhood lore to create something quite remarkable.\n\n\"We went to Silvio Horta with an idea based on the article, and he came up with an outline that we worked on together. My team, Renee Rosen and Joe Daley, went out with Silvio last Monday and Tuesday and took meetings back-to-back, and we sold it by Tuesday evening to Disney...\n\n\"It's nice that Disney is allowing me to have my identity as the frightmeister as well as somebody who's producing PG movies.\"\n\nThe Dark Backward\n\nBy Philip Nutman, Fangoria, No 200, March 2001\n\n\"Well, I understand [Phil & Sarah's] concern. It does feel as though this area of Urban Legends has been looked at rather closely of late. And one of the things that I've been talking to people about is the possible change of titles because I think that 'Bloody Mary' signifies that this project is a little too like other Urban Legends projects. It isn't. Actually it is very remote from that. A lot closer in tone to something like 'The Sixth Sense' to something like 'Urban Legend' or even 'Candyman 3.' There is a level of supernatural for sure, but really it is a psychological piece...\n\n\"It was brought to me by my team, by Joe and Renee. This year has been an incredibly busy year... And what Renee and Joe are doing is looking over the proposals we get, the ideas that people, agents, send to us. Unfortunately we can't deal with unsolicited materials cause it just would be crazy. We will only go through agents. A lot of agents come to us especially after our success - my executive producing in Candyman or Gods and Monsters - and they will say, 'Will you come and watch over 'x' and 'y'?' So Joe and Renee read through a lot of stuff and every once in a while they will come to me with a piece that they liked, and with Bloody Mary I liked it also. There is a lot of stuff we have in our development file if you will. We are thinking of doing some stuff that is very, very far from your typical Clive Barker material: we are looking at doing some cartoons, a bunch of other fun stuff, but this one is probably closest to regular 'Clive Barker' material.\"\n\nConfessions\n\nBy Craig Fohr and Kelly Shaw, Lost Souls, March 2001 (note - interview took place 14 December 2000)\n\n\"Bloody Mary has just been turned in to Touchstone and they're very excited about that - so there's a lot of things on the movie side which I thought were going to be relatively slow, plodding projects which have suddenly picked up speed.\"\n\nOpen Roads... What Price Wonderland?\n\nBy Phil and Sarah Stokes, 3 April 2002 (note - full text here)\n\n\"Eventually, we realised that Mary wasn't something we wanted to do with Touchstone, because it's just too intense. So we're going to find a new home for it.\n\n\"One thing I like about it is that it doesn't have a villain, it has a villainess, I've always liked that. You can see it all the way back in the first Hellraiser movie in the character of Julia. And in Saint Sinner, we have some really cool female demons. But Mary is a very intense story and it needs somebody who is going to understand a scary, bloody film. We couldn't find that at Touchstone.\"\n\nSaint Clive\n\nBy Chris Wyatt and Anthony C. Ferrante, Cinescape, Issue 66 and 67, November / December 2002\n\n\"Bloody Mary, we have somebody, this is not a name you would know, a guy who was one of the producers on a bunch of sort of independent hits over the last couple years. He's going to come on and help us co-produce. We are going to end up getting that made next year, which is great. Not with a major studio. It's kind of interesting, looking right now at a time when 28 Days Later is up to 35 million, or something like that, and there is a lot of really wonderful Japanese and Hong Kong horror movies out there on DVD doing pretty well. I think there's a chance that really really tough scary horror will make a comeback. I think it is incredibly encouraging that 28 Days Later has done so well.\"\n\nConfessions\n\nBy Craig Fohr, Lost Souls, 1 August 2003 (note - full text online at Lost Souls)\n\nLynda Edwards : \"One demon is feared even by Satan. In Miami shelters, children know her by two names: Bloody Mary and La Llorona (the Crying Woman). She weeps blood or black tears from ghoulish empty sockets and feeds on children's terror. When a child is killed accidentally in gang crossfire or is murdered, she croons with joy. 'If you wake at night and see her,' a ten-year-old says softly, 'her clothes be blowing back, even in a room where there is no wind. And you know she's marked you for killing.'\n\n\"The homeless children's chief ally is a beautiful angel they have nicknamed the Blue Lady. She has pale blue skin and lives in the ocean, but she is hobbled by a spell. 'The demons made it so she only has power if you know her secret name,' says Andre, whose mother has been through three rehabilitation programs for crack addiction. 'If you and your friends on a corner on a street when a car comes shooting bullets and only one child yells out her true name, all will be safe. Even if bullets tearing your skin, the Blue Lady makes them fall on the ground. She can talk to us, even without her name. She says: 'Hold on.' ' \"\n\nMyths Over Miami\n\nBy Lynda Edwards, Miami New Times, 5 June 1997\n\nZombies Vs. Gladiators\n\n...Amazon announced that Clive was to rewrite the Zombies Vs Gladiators script as Amazon Studios develops the project for a mainstream audience. Based in ancient Rome, the Zombies vs. Gladiators story opens as a shaman who is about to die in the Colosseum casts a spell that unleashes the world's first zombies. It's up to a gladiator to stop the spread of the zombie horde and save Rome...\n\nClick here to read more on the genesis of this project at Amazon Studios.\n\n\"I'm excited by the opportunity to interweave two very rich narrative threads. One of them concerns itself with the reality of the decadence of Rome and its rise and fall. The other is a fantastical narrative element - the living dead. My brief to myself on this project is to give the audience not only zombies they have never seen before but also a Rome they have never seen before.\n\n\"Amazon Studios offered up the dream ticket with this project. In twenty-five years of working in this town, I've rarely had people listen to what I had to say as closely and as carefully as they did and then simply give me the freedom to go do it. Amazon Studios is an innovative creative concept. I am looking forward to providing my own perspective to make Zombies Vs. Gladiators a highly commercial and entertaining movie.\"\n\nPress Release\n\nBy APA, 5 June 2012\n\n\"We can push push push. We can go, I think, to extremes of horror and extremes of spectacle and extremes of narrative intensity that people haven't been given in horror for a very long time. We're actually taking two groups of people that the viewers of those types of films will be very familiar with from other movies - gladiators, and zombies - and we're going to fling them at each other with lots of back story. And that's a great story to tell. In the end, why do you choose any story to tell? Because it excites you. Because it gets your pulse racing. Because it gets your palms clammy. That's why.\"\n\n\"Why Do You Choose Any Story To Tell? Because It Excites You\"\n\nBy [ ], Hollywonk, Amazon Studios, 27 July 2012\n\nRoy Price, director, Amazon Studios: \"We are excited to see how Clive will add his unique narrative to capture the essence of this story and propel the project into something unique and original that could one day be enjoyed by all audiences.\"\n\nPress Release\n\nBy APA, 5 June 2012\n\nEctosphere - The Movie\n\n...The movie version of Ectokid ?? It may well be that the non-appearance of the much trumpeted Ectosphere game caused the project to mutate into a full length screenplay. The end of 1997 saw Fred Vicarel (Silo's scribe - see 'TV that got away...') doing re-writes, since when the trumpets have gone quiet on this one too, with the advent of Nickelodeon and Paramount's purchase of Ectokid (see below) being, perhaps, the final nail in its coffin...\n\n\"There's a movie called Ectosphere, which is a dark science fiction movie, which we're doing with Spelling.\"\n\nA Graveside Chat With Clive Barker\n\nBy Jim Moore, Deathrealm, Fall 1996 (note: interview took place in 1995)\n\n\"When you have superstars with budgets in the tens of millions of dollars, using the risky imagery of horror films can get diluted. I've always believed that the best horror movies were scary because they looked at the world askew, they showed us a risky and dark vision. That kind of vision can only be put on the screen when you have trusting and creative partners. Seraphim has found that partnership in the people at Spelling.\"\n\nThe World of Clive Barker\n\nBy [Stephen Dressler and Cheryl Bentzen], Lost Souls Newsletter, 30th March 1998\n\nEctokid - The Feature\n\n...A further attempt to pick up the unfulfilled storylines of the Razorline 'Barkerverse' looks like it has much going for it so far - with Nickelodeon Pictures and Paramount picking up both the feature film and the TV rights to Ectokid. (Details of the TV project are here.) But is this the reincarnation of the 'Ectosphere' project which languishes in development hell, or something completely different? Will the movie try to tackle the unused storylines of Ectokid meeting James Dean and Janis Joplin? As ever, time will tell...\n\n...Unlike the TV version, expect Barker to produce the feature with Don Murphy whilst Joe Daley gets to exec produce. There's no doubt that the Disney deal has put Seraphim in a great position for selling Clive's not insubstantial back catalogue...\n\n\"But we've got lots going on, as you can hear... Ectokid, the comic, has just been sold to Nickelodeon, the movie - which I will produce.\"\n\nNips And Tucks, Tits And Fucks\n\nBy Phil & Sarah Stokes,\n\n\"In Ecto-kid, the Other Side is here and now. This other world is our world - but not. It's everywhere, but nowhere...\n\n\"I hope to create a franchisable world for Nickelodeon, but also one of the great, transcendent beauty; one that reconfigures people's expectations of what ghosts are, of what comes after death.\"\n\nPar, Nick Take 'Kid' For Ride\n\nBy Claude Brodesser and Cathy Dunkley, Daily Variety, 13 August 2001\n\n\"I've done a 100-page treatment for Ectokid... Nickelodeon is going to do Ectokid - I think that's a long development process because it's an elaborate movie, but if they really go for it I think it's going to be pretty amazing. I think that's two or three years off.\"\n\nOpen Roads... What Price Wonderland?\n\nBy Phil and Sarah Stokes, 3 April 2002 (note - full text here)\n\n\"We're also doing Ectokid, which was another of those comics from the Razorline series. We're doing that over at Nickelodeon with Don Murphy, who did From Hell recently and is doing League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, he's just about to produce that. Don and I are going to produce Ectokid. That's going to be fun.\"\n\nClive And Kicking\n\nBy Mike Watt, The Dark Side, Issue 101, February/March 2003\n\nDon Murphy (producer) : \"I am really excited to bring a master of suspense like Clive Barker to a new, family audience. It's an audience that Nickelodeon understands and reaches completely and very capably.\"\n\nPar, Nick Take 'Kid' For Ride\n\nBy Claude Brodesser and Cathy Dunkley, Daily Variety, 13 August 2001\n\nAge Of Desire\n\n...Age of Desire appears to have dropped down the list a little, and whilst minds are concentrated on 2010's projects details are currently few and far between...\n\n\"[Next is] Age of Desire, which is a story about an aphrodisiac which gets out of control and the more you have it in your system, the more you do stuff you hadn't even thought of before, and we're going to make that next year and that's going to be fun.\"\n\nJump Tribe Panel\n\nSan Diego Comic Con, 14 July 2005\n\n\"Well, it's interesting, we have a take which I really like. It's a hard one, so to speak. It'll be interesting to see whether we can make it fly. I'll be the first one to say that I don't know how we'll do it either, but man, I'd love to give it a go.\"\n\nVisions In Paint And Celluloid\n\nBy Carnell, Fangoria, No.247, October 2005\n\nThe Poe Project\n\n...Back in 1998, Clive devised a series of three pictures for MGM - either adaptations of, or scripts based on themes from, Edgar Allan Poe's short stories, with Barker's Poe tribute, New Murders in the Rue Morgue, thrown in for good measure... Also cited was a biographical tale of Poe and his editor, and another entitled 'Canes Bone'. However, there were perhaps two other Poe projects being floated at that time (including Craig Rosenberg's 'Nevermore') and the project was never realised....\n\n2006 saw The Hollywood Reporter running news of a 'young adult thriller' centred on Poe's ghost and his nightmares, awoken by a group of teenagers. Walden Media are Seraphim's partners for this project in which Clive will work on the story - loosely based on both Poe's life and his stories - and produce, with Anthony DiBlasi and Joe Daley executive producing. 2007 saw continuing progress on this, with DiBlasi working on last script amendments, but little news since then...\n\n\"We've been invited to do some Edgar Allan Poe adaptations for MGM. It could be fun. We're just looking at that right now and trying to make a deal. That would be something I would be interested in doing, absolutely. Poe tends to have been dealt with, I think, on the cheap side. I would like to see him get a little bit more money in his bank. That's something we're shaping up and trying to see if we can do it. We've got a lot of things going on. I'm very happy to have a lot of things in the pipeline.\"\n\nConfessions\n\nBy [Stephen Dressler and Cheryl Bentzen], Lost Souls, Issue 10, June 1998\n\n\"I think we might have a chance with this project to bring the character of Poe alive for a new audience and weave his shadowy existence into the dark enchantments of his stories so that for our protagonist, and for our audience, it will be difficult to be sure where one finishes and the other takes flight.\"\n\nBarker Pairs With Walden For Poe Thrills\n\nBy Nicole Sperling , The Hollywood Reporter, 30 November 2006 (note - full text online at www.hollwoodreporter.com)\n\nAlex Schwartz (Walden Media, Executive VP Production): \"This project is an opportunity for us to reimagine a genre that is generally associated with an older audience... By focusing on mood and atmosphere rather than blood and guts, Clive Barker brings a smart, literate take on the horror genre that will expose young audiences to its great literary underpinnings. It is only appropriate that the grandfather of modern horror fiction, Edgar Allan Poe, provides the fulcrum for the story.\"\n\nBarker Pairs With Walden For Poe Thrills\n\nBy Nicole Sperling , The Hollywood Reporter, 30 November 2006 (note - full text online at www.hollwoodreporter.com)\n\n2Gether 4Ever\n\n...Early November 2005 saw the release of news from Queso Grande Productions of Seraphim's involvement in this projected examination of the dark side of a teenage girl's relationships...\n\n[ ] : \"Queso Grande Productions proudly announces it has joined with Seraphim Films and Aint It Cool Productions to produce 2gether 4ever later this year. Written by W. Boyd Ford (Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat), the film will be produced by Harry Knowles of Aint-It-Cool-News.com, Jacky Lee Morgan (Waiting, Bully, Love Liza) of Queso Grande Productions and Joe Daley and Anthony DiBlasi of Seraphim. Clive Barker (Hellraiser, Nightbreed) will executive produce. Lastly, Lions Gate Film will be handling the domestic distribution of 2gether 4ever.\n\n\"New blood flows as Ford and Morgan join forces to direct the story of a teen girl and her relationship with high school, parents, a ghost and some ghastly goings-on. The duo previously teamed up on the campier side of horror to write and produce H. G. Lewis's Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat. With 2gether 4ever, Morgan and Ford turn their talents to exploring the darker side of the genre.\n\n\"Bestselling author Clive Barker has brought us numerous horrific projects including the iconic Hellraiser series. Seraphim Films is currently in pre production on Midnight Meat Train and post production on The Plague. Seraphim's Midnight Picture Show will also be developing another sinister feature with Queso Grande entitled Scape-Goats based on the short story by Barker.\"\n\n2Gether 4Ever Press Release\n\nBy [ ], 2Gether 4Ever Press Release, 7 November 2005\n\nHarry Knowles : \"It was the whole thing. The structure, the tone, the basic theme and the potential I saw in Jacky & Boyd's script. These two guys have been working behind the scenes for a lot of years. Nicest guys in the world, big dreams, but absolutely egoless. Basically - the sort of people that you want to see make it. They asked for my help, invited me into their creative circle to see if I could help. That and... well I really want to make a horror film that hurts. Not just because of gore and on-screen violence, but because you got caught up in character, the story and the relationships. Plus - I wanted to go the Indie route on one of the films to learn and work in that world. Not because I'm fed up with studios. I'm actually really enjoying that process (so far) - but there's a speed and an excitement to low budget film that is viscerally exciting. That - and well - there's something that we've concocted in the film that - well I can't wait to sit at the back of the theater and watch an audience react to. If it goes the way we think, it could be amazing. Then again, it could just be ass. But there's a lot of folks that'll be doing this stuff for the right reasons. Just hope the fates smile with us along the way.\"\n\nWhat The Hell Is 2gether 4ever And Why Is Clive Barker Associated With It?\n\nBy Harry Knowles, Ain't It Cool News, 7 November 2005 (text online at www.aintitcool.com)\n\nSon Of Celluloid\n\n...First adapted for the movies back in the late 1980s, 2010 saw hints of it moving back towards the silver screen for the first time in twenty years, but to no avail.\n\n\"Right now we are looking at doing something with Son of Celluloid, which appeared in volume three of Books of Blood. It is a surreal supernatural story set in a cinema - and I love the idea of people sitting in a movie theatre watching a movie which is about people sitting in a movie theatre watching a movie.\"\n\nThe Pig Chill\n\nBy [ ], SFX, No 191, February 2010\n\nDown, Satan\n\n...Clive is excited to announce a new adaptation of his 1985 short story, Down, Satan!\n\nConcerning the fate of Gregorius, who contrived to build Hell on Earth in order to tempt the Devil (and, thus, God), Clive tells this tale in a mere 1600 words or so, making this adaptation a challenging one. The feature is currently in its very early stages but Chris Monfette's first draft has been extremely well received at Seraphim and Clive is highly flattering about the way Chris has expanded the story to become solid feature length material...\n\n\"This is probably one of the most ambitious stories from Books of Blood for two reasons. First, the original story is only four pages long, so the writer, Chris, has had to add a great deal of his own material, which he has brilliantly done. Second, because this is a story about the devil. There are inevitably going to be people looking at it in the light of Hellraiser. Chris has proved even in his first draft that he has unique gifts for highly intelligent but still visceral scares.\"\n\nE-mail To Revelations\n\nBy Clive Barker, 3 July 2008\n\n\"I always feel like if you talk too much about things, they don't happen. The reason I don't want to say too much is that the [original] story is five pages long. What Chris has done is mostly Chris. All I can tell you is that the things he has created are superb. When you see it, you go, 'Oh yes, of course.' It's organic, it grows naturally out of what's on the page, but it's brilliant.\"\n\nClive Barker Updates Books of Blood Franchise\n\nBy Jeff Otto, 3 March 2009\n\nChris Monfette : \"In our discussions of the Books of Blood, Clive had asked which of the stories were my favorite, to which I responded 'Down, Satan!' Despite it's relative length, it's something to which I've always connected, not simply because we've all struggled with issues of religion - and the seeming absence of God in those moments when we most need him - but because I felt it reflected, in a sense, the more human experience of our relationship with our parents. The idea that, as adolescents and twenty-somethings - and even into adulthood proper - it can often feel as if the only way to garner any real emotion or recognition from our 'fathers' is to evoke the negative - easier, sometimes, to piss off than please. There's something sad and tragic in that - and all too real - and when I mentioned that to Clive, it opened up a path through which a four-page story could be expanded into a feature film. We've found, I think, a way to really make it work, and I must say - if I can get away with saying so - that it's coming along very well. There's drama and scale and tension and horror and if we can succeed at striking the proper balance, I suspect we should have something very evocative and intensely original. But that's just me doing my own PR. The only judge who matters on this is Clive, so ask me again when the gavel falls! \"\n\nE-mail To Revelations\n\nBy Chris Monfette, 18 June 2008\n\nChris Monfette : \"Down, Satan, there's a script that I'm really proud of, but it's a big, smart horror film in the vein [of] The Exorcist... So we're left in search of real money. Its Hollywood. Any can or won't happen. But the script has been VERY well recieved. \"\n\nTwitter Post\n\nBy Chris Monfette, 11 January 2011\n\nNightbreed 2 and 3\n\n...Who knows where the rights to these currently rest. Could they continue without the corresponding books? Could they continue without Barker? Absolutely no sign of them as yet, although a recent rumour that Barker wrote a prequel in 1997, shipped the script around unsuccessfully for some time but that Artisan Entertainment had recently picked it up and had Barker onboard as exec producer swept around the world with astonishing speed. Sorry to say we've now seen these rumours nixed in print by Nicholas Vince, the Chatterer himself, who had just spoken to Barker...\n\n[Re 3 picture deal between Barker / FilmFutures and Morgan Creek - the first picture being Nightbreed] \"Son of Celluloid is the second picture we'll make together, and the third will hopefully be Nightbreed 2. When Morgan Creek bought the film rights to Cabal they insisted on a more commercial title. They thought it didn't mean anything and they could be right. Who knows?\n\n\"Charles Haid, as Eigerman, gets killed at the end of the film [Nightbreed] but not in the book. This doesn't mean I can't bring him back, of course, as long as the movie does business! There will definitely be more Cabal books, though I envisage trouble keeping the book and film sequels separate. That's a worrying bridge to cross and there is a danger it will all become too self-referential, which I must avoid at all costs. I must look at the books as distinct from the movies. I start writing Cabal II after Nightbreed wraps.\"\n\nClive Barker's Nightbreed\n\nBy Alan Jones, Cinefantastique, Vol 20 Nos 1 & 2 (double-issue), November 1989\n\n\"Midian is destroyed and the second movie does not happen minutes later. It happens after the passage of some time. Nightbreed leaves a lot of questions unanswered, a lot of long-term questions.

I'd be involved in it but I've just signed a two-picture deal with Universal so that'll keep me out of the running for a while.\" [a sci-fi film (Eden USA) & The Mummy re-make]\n\nFlesh and Fury\n\nBy Mark Salisbury, Fear, No 22, October 1990\n\n\"The head of Morgan Creek is still interested in Nightbreed 2... It's extremely ironic. But the story of the Nightbreed can run and run. There's no reason why those creatures couldn't be back in one form or another.\"\n\nBarker Bites Back\n\nBy Anthony Timpone, (i) Fangoria Horror Spectacular, No 1, 1990 (ii) Fangoria : Masters of the Dark\n\n\"For the first 'Nightbreed' picture, which is the first of the 'Cabal' pictures, we might do a little bit of shooting in Canada, but essentially we want to work with the same team that has done such extraordinary work here [on 'Hellbound']. In the 'Nightbreed' pictures, I will say I think there'll be more monsters per square inch of screen than probably ever seen before. I mean this is a major, major number of monsters. It may even be three movies eventually. As long as it's planned, I like the idea of a series. The only time it doesn't work, it seems to me, is when - as in the Nightmare on Elm Street pictures - there isn't planning. I would certainly like to direct the first 'Nightbreed' because I think it is a horror movie with a very new angle. And it has all these creatures in it, and it can be very imaginative and very fun to do. One of the things that Chris [Figg] and I are trying to do is reestablish that tradition in this country. Nobody else is doing it.\"\n\nChains of Love\n\nBy Mark Salisbury Fear, No 3, December 1988\n\nMidnight Meat Train 2 and 3\n\n...Treatments exist but what chance for these after the all-too-literal butchering of the first movie by Lionsgate..?\n\n\"I have plots for two more [Midnight Meat Train] movies which would have extended the narrative and allowed the mythology to breathe a little bit, but I think the DVD will have to do really fucking well for that to happen.\"\n\nMidnight Meat Train\n\nBy [ ], DVD And Blu-Ray Review, No 122, November 2008\n\n\"It frustrates me because we would have had a trilogy out of this. I set to work to develop, in note form from way back, the back story of the city fathers. The other movies were not just taking place in this city but in other parts of America. They were connecting up the story of underground activity which is America-wide. It would have climaxed with a meeting of all the stations, all of the lines. I had this massive plan in my head. The absence of a theatrical release was... not only were we losing the chance to exhibit the picture the way it should have been shown, but also we were killing the chance of getting a real horror trilogy that would be constructed picture by picture.\"\n\nThe Midnight Meat Train Trilogy\n\nBy Ryan Rotten, Shock Till You Drop, 13 February 2009\n\n\"There is a bigger mythology here. We're only seeing the tip of the iceberg. At one point I even contemplated the idea of doing an entire novel which [would] talk about the underworld, the underbelly of America. So there's always been that [feeling] that maybe this is one I could go back to. Most of the stories in the Books of Blood are self-contained. [It is] one with left a lot of mythological questions unanswered. Who were these creatures? What real part did they have in the building of New York or New Amsterdam? There were so many interesting questions which I thought could be prequel and sequel questions. That had always been in my head, even when I first wrote the original story.\"\n\nClive Barker on Midnight Meat Train Trilogy!\n\nBy Jeff Otto, Bloody Disgusting, 6 March 2009\n\nVipex\n\n...aka Lord of Illusions II. Clive clearly has a long-standing relationship with his favourite detective - who can appear (and has) when required, in any number of storylines. Harry can provide that sense of first person involvement crucial to writer and reader alike and is already a well-known and trusted character - so if Vipex doesn't come off then expect to see Harry cropping up somewhere else instead. Interestingly, the bio of Barker in the UK Gods and Monsters DVD booklet (released in June 2000) described the project as \"in the works\" - the first we'd heard about it for almost two years. Whilst news in July 2001 of a Harry D'Amour TV series for MGM (see TV Still To Come...) signalled a shift to the small screen, it now looks like the movie option is back in favour...\n\n\"Harry is the 'good guy' in the story. At least, he's perceived that way. So I'm hoping that, if we do manage a sequel to this picture, I'd get to bring Harry D'Amour back. He's the interesting character to me, he's the man with the haunted past. He's just had a bit of bad luck when it comes to meeting up with the occult. If we do make another movie with Harry, it may give us the chance to keep the material fresh. The ideal model for this is the television series Night Stalker, which I always loved. I'd like to think that we could do something similar with Harry. I think Bakula was tremendous playing the part of Harry. He's a very reassuring, accessible person which, curiously, frees me up to be a lot nastier. Because the movie has such an accessible figure at its heart, it frees me up to be far colder and nastier.\"\n\nA Graveside Chat With Clive Barker\n\nBy Jim Moore, Deathrealm, Fall 1996 (note: interview took place in 1995)\n\n\"I definitely want to once again have the mingling of reality and wild, dark fantasy that marked the first one - it should be a major part of the second. I want to see if we could do that again. Harry comes back [not Nix] and I think it will be set in New York, but I'm just playing with that now. I'd like to have a completely fresh title and emphasise that it's the same character. That would be my ideal and we'd work from there.\"\n\nThe Conjuring of Lord of Illusions part 5 - The Last Interview\n\nBy Anthony C. Ferrante, Fangoria, No 146, September 1995 {Note: interview took place in early Spring 1995}\n\n\"I've been writing about Harry as a character now for ten years and he's encountered a lot of strange things in novels and short stories and so part of this [sequel to Lord Of Illusions] is going and taking him on a fresh adventure. One of the fun things about him as a character, I think, is being funny, accessible, sexy, all those things and, I don't know if I've said this before but horror movies and dark supernatural movies are driven by their villains. When you think about a horror movie you think about the villain: you think about Pinhead; you think about the Candyman; you think about Freddy Kreuger; you think about Isuzu possessing poor little Linda Blair. You don't think about good guys. What I've had to do in this movie is make it so that you care about the good guy. So, forget about Nix - he's gone, all those guys are gone, never to be seen again. I don't want to have that thing of, 'Oh-oh, the monster's back...' We've pulled out the stake and all of that stuff - it's time to take the story somewhere fresh and hopefully the series can continue in some way, maybe develop the idea of an emotional arc for Harry - which has certainly occurred in the books - so that as we live with Harry, as it were, from story to story we understand him better.\n\n\"One of the things that happens to him in Lord Of Illusions is he walks off into a rather grim-looking future with Dorothea. What's happened to Dorothea might indeed be an element in the next picture; not that Dorothea will be, but you know, just to finish off that arc of the story.\"\n\nLeapcon 1996\n\nTranscript of an appearance at Leapcon, the Quantum Leap convention, 18 February 1996\n\n\"There will be a sequel. We're shooting it for a video release, much like the Darkman sequels were made. I'm hoping that Bakula will return. He's making his mind up at the moment. If he decides not to do it, we'll recast the role. After all, we will soon have had four Batmen with George Clooney taking the lead, so changing the actor really shouldn't affect the series and I've always wanted to take Harry to television. He is a natural for a TV series, with shades of Kolchak, the night stalker.\"\n\nLord Of Illusion\n\nBy [ ], Home Cinema Choice, September 1996\n\nScott Bakula : \"I would love to [play Harry again].

It is supposed to start shooting next year. It will have a television and video life. I don't know if Scott has committed yet, but I think he will. He's not had great luck as of late, but he's a very talented actor and I like working with him. He had a great time working on the movie. Craig [Scheffer - Nightbreed] had some problems. Scott, on the other hand, is solid. He's an old fashioned star, in the sense that he learns his lines and he comes on and does what he needs to do. I have nothing but respect for the man. So, we will see what happens with the sequel. If it works, the idea is to then do a Harry D'Amour television series.\"\n\nConfessions\n\nBy [Stephen Dressler and Cheryl Bentzen], Lost Souls, Issue 6, January 1997\n\n\"[Vipex is] still in the works. It hasn't gone away, it has just taken something of a back seat to a whole bunch of other things that have been going on this year. I provided a story. The script - which is very good - was written by David Campbell Wilson, who wrote this new movie 'Supernova' which Walter Hill is directing. It's a really first-rate script, but we just haven't focused a lot on the project.\n\n\"The material still fascinates me because Harry fascinates me.

Tony Todd broke word of the latest 'standalone' Candyman project in 2004 with the promise of Barker's involvement, if only as 'story consultant and an executive producer'.

Apparently the offer of \"an island\" at Disneyland was the clincher in choosing Disney over other suitors...\n\nThe first two books were to form the basis of the first of three planned Disney movies. Whilst discussions continued over the question of live action/CGI, so it became clear that the originally suggested release date of the first movie as 'sometime in 2004' was looking rather ambitious. But progress was certainly made on the project, with John Harrison (who directed the Dune mini-series for TV ahead of writing the Children of Dune mini-series) completing the screenplay for the first Abarat movie...\n\nClive's original deal also included a percentage of the standard Disney merchandising frenzy - we were all prepared for the burger chain freebies as well as the planned Disneyland ride. But if all this was intended to be Clive's way of bringing a darker twist to the 'Disneyfication' of the world he's often talked about, 2007 brought the news that Disney's option had lapsed, putting movie plans back into its creator's hands, but thought likely to be on hold until the completion of all five books...\n\nWith Book Three published and Book Four being written, however, 2012 brings fresh news on the project, with Clive quietly confident about new negotiations with an enthusiastic team (see current projects)...\n\n\"Since I first read C.S. Lewis' Chronicles of Narnia, I've wanted to create a fantasy world of my own, filled with characters and creatures who originated in my waking dreams. A world I could describe in both oil paint and in words, which would be the setting for a series of epic adventures. Abarat is that world. My Oz, my Narnia, my Never-land. I believe we - that is, HarperCollins and myself - will be making books resembling nothing that has ever been produced before.\"\n\nHarperCollins To Publish Children's Fantasy Series by Clive Barker\n\nBy [ ], www.writenews.com, 26 April 2000\n\n\"This is my Wizard of Oz, my Narnia, this is a world I love to lose myself in and where I'll spend most of the next nine years working on these films.\"\n\nDisney Magics Up Girl Rival to Harry Potter\n\nBy John Harlow (Los Angeles), The Sunday Times, 21 May 2000\n\n\"Eventually, it came down to three or four people who really had the size. Not just the size of funds to buy it, but also the size of organization to really exploit all the possibilities that it offered... I wanted this at Disney because they have the mechanism to make it into something extraordinary. Also, they think visually, and here I was with a large number of paintings, a lot of design work already done.\"\n\nClive Barker Gives Disney A Nightmarishly Edgy Kid Flick Rep\n\nBy Kathleen Tracy, KidScreen Magazine, May 2001\n\n\"It's a quartet of novels I wrote for HarperCollins, and I painted 220 oil paintings, some of them huge, some of them 13 feet across to go with these books as illustrations. I suppose the closest you could come to it is the Narnia books. Disney decided they wanted to buy the world for films, for the theme parks, for TV... In other words where Disney are going to be, they want Abarat to be.\n\n\"It's completely the Holy Grail. It's all that I could have wanted and it's a way for me to have the creativity that I want. Write the books, paint the pictures, without being bothered by everyone. And it's tremendous to think I'm going to walk down Disneyland's Main Street into Abarat Land in maybe five years time. It sounds pretty cool!\n\n\"None of those [other projects] are going to be as important as Abarat. I want to show that Disney's faith in me is justified. For three years, Clive Barker is giving himself over to Abarat, and everything that is associated with Abarat will be part of Barker's purview.\"\n\nLord Of Illusions\n\nBy [ ], SFX Magazine, Issue No.65, June 2000\n\n[Peter Schneider's departure from Disney] \"is regrettable - he was a good guy - but there's a lot of good guys there and we've had no bad experiences there so far, they've been really super, so I'm cautiously optimistic that it's all going to work out well.\"\n\nNips And Tucks, Tits And Fucks\n\nBy Phil & Sarah Stokes, 10 July 2001 (note - full text here)\n\n\"I've declined to do an art show this year because most of the paintings are related to Abarat, and although the actual objects belong to me, nevertheless, Disney is going to keep them in their vaults until the movie comes out, just because I want to protect them. Disney has an amazing vaulting system. Disney has been very protective of their artwork over the years. They are going to protect them and when the movie comes out I think I am going to exhibit the paintings around the country and probably sell them at the same time. But my first priority is not the sale but the exhibition of them. I want to hold all the paintings together. I don't want to sell them off in bits and pieces and then find that when we get the movie out there, and all four Abarat books are delivered, and I want to have a huge exhibition, that I can't recover all the paintings because they are in private hands. I prefer to wait and get all the pictures out there at the same time. And then it's going to be quite an exhibition. I don't know quite where we are going to do it yet.\n\n\"One of the things is obviously we can't exhibit everything, but I want to put up as many pictures as possible. And we are talking big pictures. I mean the biggest of them is 13 feet by 9 feet. A lot of them are 4 feet by 5 feet I mean they're big guys. I want to make sure this is done properly. And the great thing about Disney is that they are really enthusiastic about doing this properly. So I think this is going to be a good marriage of minds.\"\n\nConfessions\n\nBy [Craig Fohr], Lost Souls Newsletter, September / December 2000 (note - interview took place 25 August 2000)\n\n\"I shall write four novels, as I am contracted to do, which will constitute the first arc - if this was Star Wars, it would be the first three movies - and Disney will take from those four books the material to make three movies. They may also take material to do TV, games, what have you.\n\n\"What they've done is something they've never done before: they've bought a world from the inside out. They came out and saw a house full of paintings, and heard me talk about the world and the characters and the philosophies, and they said, 'We want to exploit this material in every medium we're in, from theater through parks, through toys, whatever.' And that was my dream for this material. It's a wonderful marriage.\"\n\nThe Dark Backward\n\nBy Philip Nutman, Fangoria, No 200, March 2001\n\n\"The Disney vision is very particular and they're going to take this and run with it and I don't know if even they know where that race is going to end. I know that they want to take the first two books as the subject of the first movie and I think that makes sense because there are certain narrative arcs which actually complete themselves within the first two books so there's a sense of some narrative satisfaction to be had - you know, a couple of minor villains die. You got to have a sense of 'Hey, we've got rid of a few of these guys, got to throw some of these guys to the lions'. So I think they're right to take the first two books, because I want this movie to be - you know what Peter Jackson did with the Lord Of The Rings, if it could be that, or even a part of that, then that would be fantastic...\"\n\nOpen Roads...

I don't think so. I think we'd probably have to cut it. We have to watch...\n\n\"Absolutely [I can envision Abarat games]. And so can Disney. It may even be that the first thing we do are games.

So if you guys want to make the books blue rather than red and you want to tell a different kind of story set in my world, I don't have a problem with that.

But having made movies myself, I certainly didn't come to Abarat thinking, 'Gee, I want to make this movie.' In actual fact, part of me feels as though it's wonderful that Disney is taking on the challenge of making these movies because it frees me to do what I really want to do, which is to continue to write Abarat books.\"\n\nNew Children's Book From Author of 'Hellraiser', 'Pinhead'\n\nBy Seamus O'Regan, transcript from Canada AM, 26 December 2002\n\n\"Showing those pictures [to Disney] at the time was one of the greatest experiences of my life. What was wonderful was having these folks come into my house and look at the work. And when they came in through the door, instantly they got it. Harry Weinstein was extraordinarily articulate and wonderful. Mr Katzenberg was remarkable. He sat on the floor with his legs crossed and said, 'Tell me the story.'\n\n\"It was really quite an exciting time in my life.

I think they liked seeing that part of me, and I liked them seeing it.\"\n\nAbarat\n\nFor HarperCollins (US), The Books Of Abarat.com, Fall 2002.\n\n\"Ben [Smith] said, 'There is a world here, and people are looking for worlds; they're looking for places to play. Why don't we talk to the studios the way you've just talked to me? Keep this very simple, bring the folks up to the house where all the paintings are, and let's just do this in a very 'unpitchlike' way.'... It was a fun thing to do; it was very organic - me just telling the tale...\n\n\"I'll be as involved [in Disney's projects] as they want me to be. My feeling has always been that my first job is to write and paint these books and to create as many cool characters and fun concepts and strange geographies [as I can], so that when other talents in other areas come and look at these worlds, they've got lots to play with. If I'm invited to help in the developmental processes, I'm absolutely there to do that - but I don't want to be proprietary about this. I'm the first to say Abarat will have different lives in different forms, whether it be television or movies or whatever.\"\n\nClive Barker, Author\n\nBy Gina McIntyre, The Hollywood Reporter, 4 October 2002\n\n\"So, great response [to Abarat Volume 2]. Great response from Disney too, which is fun because then they are now going to go and pursue the movie. I think they seem very committed to taking what I've written seriously and really taking a crack at reflecting it in this movie. So I'm going to meet with them in about a month's time and we'll talk about that.\"\n\nConfessions\n\nBy Craig Fohr, Lost Souls, 1 August 2003 (note - full text online at Lost Souls)\n\n\"That man [John Harrison] is writing Abarat, the screenplay, right now, for Disney. And one of the things that made me want to do the deal with Disney was they said, 'We really are excited about it and, by the way, we have an island we could give you...' and I said, 'You're on!' So we are going to create the theme park at some point - Babilonium - party on, man!...\n\n\"My hope, honestly, would be that it'll be a mingling of the best [of live action and CGI] - I think we're finding CGI can do more and more, I just don't want it to be dominated by CGI\"\n\nBarnes and Noble Stage Presentation\n\nBy Brein Lopez, LA Festival of Books, 25 April 2004\n\n\"John Harrison - the last I heard, I should have the script in my hand the next week or so - so we'll see. I like John immensely and I have great faith in his loyalty to my vision, because he did the Dune project and he's approached this scale of thinking before and I think did immensely well with Frank Herbert's world and I have great hopes that he'll do the same with Abarat... He was a Disney choice, but he was kind of offered up to me a little bit - like, 'What do you think about John Harrison?' and because of the Dune experience, or Children of Dune, I was like, 'Yeah! Damn right - that's a great idea!'\n\n\"He spent several parts of days with me, going around the paintings, talking through not only what was on the walls but also what I thought was going to happen to these characters as time went by - to cast my imagination forward from the two books that we do, into whatever the third and the fourth might bring. And I can only do that in a very limited way because of the way I'm working - I haven't painted those books yet! So I don't know that much, but there are some things I know and I was able to offer him some insights. And I was certainly able to give him the feel for what excited me about this whole project in the first place - what had brought me to islands and time and a time out of time and the Fantomaya and all the various elements that plugged into my experiences as a child going to Tiree and Guernsey - two islands which featured hugely in my childhood imaginings.The whole idea of being able to jump through time and then go to a place where time doesn't even exist is something that's very acute right now, being in a state of jet lag! That's the way you feel! You're not plugged into the way the hours work and I made a note to myself two years ago, saying, 'Candy should feel something like jet lag,' and I think that when she gets to move through the islands at a really fast rate (as she'll be required to do in the third and fourth books) that's got to affect her. I mean, jumping from hour to hour, you're getting very strong feelings of what each hour will bring, but they're not in the right order! And it's that weird thing of when you have, for some reason, disturbed sleep, or when you sleep in the middle of the day - you know, when you're really tired and you sleep for a couple of hours in the middle of the day and you lose two hours, you know? This strange sense of being dislocated - I shared a lot of that stuff with John and I think he was excited to have whatever I could give him. What Disney said to him, I do not know, I was not party to. Those conversations were between John and Disney and John didn't choose to share them with me, and that's right and proper. He's a man who's coming to this with three things in his head: who I am, who his employers are - Disney, and who he is as a writer with his own imaginings and his own vision and his own version of what this is (probably I put those in reverse order - probably I should put him first!). He's a very smart, sensitive man and I'm cautiously optimistic that we're going to have something exciting out of this.\"\n\nIn Anticipation Of The Deluge: A Moment At The River's Edge\n\nBy Phil and Sarah Stokes, 1 and 12 July 2004 (note - full text here)\n\n\"The screenwriter is a man called John Harrison, who I respect enormously and who has been very respectful of my desires where the book is concerned and he tells me the script is loyal to the books and I'm delighted that's so.\n\n\"I don't want to get too close to the creative process. I still have two more Abarat books to write, though not two more to paint because I'm half way through the paintings for book three. If I start to get involved in the film I'll be drawn back into the material from books one and two when in fact, as a writer, I should be looking forward. My job is to finish the story I have begun in very a spectacular fashion.\"\n\nIn A Terrifying World Of His Own\n\nBy Laura Davis, icliverpool.co.uk, September 2004 (note - full text online at www.icliverpool.co.uk)\n\n\"Abarat is being adapted by John Harrison for Disney, although we haven't decided on a director yet. What I did right from the beginning was say to Disney, 'Look, I'm creating these books, and there's a lot of my life and energy in it. Come to me if I can be useful, but otherwise I'll just be writing the books and painting.' So they haven't come to me, which I don't mind, because I like and trust John a great deal. There's a high likelihood that Abarat will get going at some point, simply because I think fantasy is where people's heads are right now.\"\n\nClive Barker's Dark Plans\n\nBy Joe Nazzaro, www.fangoria.com, 2 December 2004\n\n\"I'm sure that inevitably [Disney] are going to make changes. Turning the first two books into a movie is a huge deal, and so things will be lost and inevitably changed, so I don't want to get my knickers in a twist about stuff I can do nothing about. What I should be doing is concentrating on the stuff that I can do something about, which is the next book and the next painting!\"\n\nEntering Abarat\n\nBy Joe Nazzaro, Starburst, No 318, January 2005\n\n\"I've been around movies for a long time, and if I've learned anything, it's that a movie isn't made until it's made, so there are no certainties.\n\n\"I think if we pull this off with live-action, it will be like nothing that anyone has ever done before, and that's a hugely exciting prospect. The idea of putting Christopher Carrion on the screen - with his nightmares sinuously moving around his neck - or having a conversation between John Mischief and his brothers... It's a very complicated piece of work, but on the other hand, if it comes off, man, it could be amazing!\n\n\"The first movie will contain material primarily from Books One and Two, which makes sense, because there's a big arc in them, which is taking a newly empowered Candy back to the town where she was a victim of her father's cruelty. So she goes back to Chickentown and liberates the chickens, and then returns to Abarat, having freed herself of the shackles of Chickentown and knowing who she really is. Candy is ready to take her place, although she has no idea what place it will be, or what the cost will be, in the life and history of Abarat. So I believe the first two books will work very well as a single movie. Book Three, Absolute Midnight, will be the second movie, and Book Four, which is the mega-book, will be the third film in the trilogy.\"\n\nDays Of Magic\n\nBy Joe Nazzaro, Fantasy Worlds, No 5, February 2005\n\n\"Abarat, the script (what hopefully is the final script) will be turned in to Disney, though not to us, in a week's time...\n\n\"I have not seen a single word... I sort of am [deliberately avoiding it], actually. I feel as though, 'Let Disney do what they need to do with it and then show it to me,' I think it's hard for people like John Harrison, who is a very, very smart and very respectful man, respectful of the books and of me and I am equally respectful of him. I don't want to be another voice wittering in his ear. I am perfectly sure that there are a dozen script advisers and note-takers and note-takers to the note-takers at Disney who are already doing that. I prefer to wait until the script has found some kind of equilibrium and hopefully John is at a place where he wants to show it to me and when he wants to show it to me, I will happily read it and we'll see, we'll see.\"\n\nThe Hellbound Art : Memory, Fantasy And Filigree\n\nBy Phil and Sarah Stokes, 10 February 2005 (note - full text here)\n\n\"John Harrison, who wrote the screenplay of 'Abarat' has just turned his screenplay over to Disney. I'm gonna be meeting with Disney in about three of four weeks time to show them the new paintings. I have a hundred of new Abarat paintings they last here in the house. So I want to show the staff of Disney the pictures and talk about how my ideas of the third and fourth book have developed by making these paintings. So we are moving slowly - it's a slow process with all these large movies because there's a lot of money involved. And obviously we have to get the screenplays completely right. But what has been nice for Disney is that they have been able to see 'Abarat' go back on to the bestseller list here in America twice - three times the last month.\"\n\nClive Barker On The Phone\n\nBy [Thomas Hemmerich], That's Clive!, 29 March 2005 (note - full text online at www.clivebarker.de)\n\n\"Abarat is at present with Disney - I don't know whether it will stay with Disney, honestly. Disney's in flux a little bit, you may have heard they have changes of mouse and so it's hard to predict. All I know is I'm writing the third book, painting the set of paintings for the third book - there are thirty-two languages now, including Chinese which is great and I feel like a market has opened up in people's heads (I don't even want to say market - a hole, a Jump hole - has opened in people's heads.) People want fantasy more than ever before and I don't think they necessarily want the old kind of fantasy, either.\"\n\nJump Tribe Panel\n\nPanel appearance, San Diego Comic Con, 14 July 2005\n\n\"I don't know... whether we will end up making Abarat with Disney; there's a certain disconnect between Disney and myself. And I can't tell you anything more than that, though it would be terribly fun to do so!\"\n\nAppearance: Reading, Q&A\n\n(i) Tattered Cover Bookshop, Denver, 20 October 2005, (ii) podcast available online at www.authorsontourlive.com as \"Clive Barker Podcasts from Visions of Heaven and Hell\")\n\n\"Abarat will be a movie but I am fighting very hard for them not to try making it too soon. We are no longer making Abarat with Disney, that is now official, the work is back in my hands and my ownership, I owe them nothing. I suppose you could say there were creative differences, I don't know. Certainly the way they wanted to do it was not the way I wanted to do it. I realised a short while after getting into the deal with Disney and I'm glad it's come to this conclusion where we can make this movie. Though I have to tell you, there was a man called John Harrison, who did Children of Dune for Sci-Fi channel and a bunch of other movies, and who has just done a really smart version of the bookend tale from The Books of Blood; it's really very, very good. John has done a very fine draft of Abarat which covers Books 1 and 2.\n\n\"In about six months I'll be writing the third book and I'll be writing the third and fourth books back-to-back; we'll really have this narrative on a roll and these paintings are getting made. As you know there's a lot of paintings now, certainly enough now to start my imagination going - and actually the painting part of it is the hardest part - so we have about 500 paintings that are part of that mythology which could form part of the narrative element for Books 3, 4 and 5.\n\n\"My thing to the filmmakers is, 'Wait until I've written Book 5 and I've delivered everything and then make your movie.' The reason I say that is because Candy doesn't age significantly - she ages maybe three years across the five books and if you're going to do this properly then the actress can't age overmuch either and you've got to have all the books written and all the screenplays written before you start.\"\n\nSowing The Seeds Of The Story Tree\n\nBy Phil and Sarah Stokes, 28 August and 4 September 2006 (note - full text here)\n\n\"I pulled it away from Disney because to be very honest I did that deal because I was working with two men who I liked immensely and they swore to me they were not going anywhere and of course two months later they were gone. I watched as the Disney organisation plodded its way through bouncing this thing back and forth not knowing what to do with it. Meanwhile I turned in a second book, which only confused them even more.\n\n\"There just came a point where last September their time was up with the option and it was time for them to come up with a number on the table to keep the material for a decent amount of time. Their lawyer came to us and said 'We're Disney, Clive's very lucky to be with us and here is what we propose: rather than paying you x amount and keeping the material for another two years we keep it for four years and pay you nothing'. And I said 'Go fuck yourself.'\n\n\"They made it so easy for me and it was lovely because I wanted so much to work with these two guys who I had done the deal with and none whatsoever to work with Disney. That was when it was going off the rails and when Eisner started to back into the archives of what I consider the treasure trove of the great American art that is the original Sleeping Beauty and the original Fantasia. This is great art as far as I'm concerned and I will defend it against whoever else comes along! And it appalled me to see them doing these straight to DVD sequels. They were just violating their own library and to me that was just desperate, just pathetic and I just said 'bye bye'. And now I will wait until I've finished all the books or near enough finished all the books and we'll see. As far as I'm concerned there is nowhere written that a book is not finished unless it's turned into a film.\"\n\nJericho / Hellraiser: Clive Barker Reveals All!\n\nBy Mister Disgusting, Bloody Disgusting.com, 7 November 2007\n\nMichael Mendenhall (Disney): \"I see them [the quartet] as being a combination of Harry Potter and a contemporary 'Wizard of Oz' but even richer in character and setting.

For us, this is a way to develop creative content that will be fresh for years to come. On this project, Clive clearly has a creative direction that's very in line with our studio.\"\n\nMouse Catches Barker\n\nBy Bill Higgins, Daily Variety, 17 April 2000\n\nJane Friedman (HarperCollins President and CEO): \"We are thrilled to announce this exciting project with one of our most successful and respected house authors.

Both have archetypal characters and storylines that I respond to deeply, and both Frank Herbert and Clive Barker are undisputed masters at creating fully realized, complete and integrated worlds. My job on Dune was not to change the world, but to find a way to realize it visually, and to honor the source material as I adapted it to another medium. I learned so much from that, and I hope my success with Dune has enabled me to do much the same with Abarat...\n\n\"Abarat will only be partially live-action. The characters are too fantastical to realize without some accommodation to CGI. My expectation is that by the time this goes into production, there will be technological advances allowing us to bring characters like John Mischief and Christopher Carrion to life in all their Barker-esque glory, not dissimilar to the way Peter Jackson created Gollum.\"\n\nAdapting Abarat\n\nBy Joe Nazzaro, Fantasy Worlds, No 5, February 2005\n\nJohn Harrison: \"I co-wrote a movie for Disney called Dinosaur several years ago, and they had bought Clive's four Abarat books and called me to ask if I'd be interested in adapting them. I had known Clive from some previous encounters - near-misses, things we didn't get to do together - and I was thrilled, because I've been to his house and I've seen his fantastic Abarat paintings. It's phenomenal, because he actually painted the story before he wrote it - his house is filled with canvases, some the size of a whole wall. So I said of course, I'd love to do that.\n\n\"We're taking the first two books and adapting them into one movie. The screenplay will go in in the next couple of weeks, and we'll see what happens. I don't know what the publication schedule is for Clive's next two books in the series, but I hope Disney will go forward quickly with the film. It's got incredible, fantastical characters and a really complex, dark story. He has some wonderfully frightening characters in Abarat - these chimeras of all different shapes and sizes - and Christopher Carrion is a truly scary bad guy.\n\n\"We're obviously trying to design the movie for a broad audience, but I'm hoping that the darker aspects won't get completely removed. I have great faith in the whole grim-fairy-tale attitude about what these stories can be, and I believe that children can handle darker stories than we give them credit for. I hope that the success of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy, which didn't pull any punches in terms of its horrific elements, and the last Harry Potter movie will encourage the studio not to sanitize Clive's material.\"\n\nScreenwriter Talks Clive Barker's Abarat Movie\n\nBy Michael Gingold, Fangoria.com, 24 January 2005 (note - full text online at www.fangoria.com)\n\nJohn Harrison: \"I adapted his Abarat books for Disney, which are currently stuck in contract negotiations, so I don't know what's going to happen with that...

We took the first Abarat books - there are four of them, or there will be four of them - and I took the first two and created the screenplay. It's wonderful.

We have investors who are excited by the prospect of letting us make two movies a year, which we will have creative control over, which will be very strong, hardcore horror movies, and even stronger and more hardcore when we get to the DVD versions which I want to make as complete an experience as possible, so that in a few years' time we'll be able to go to our DVD locker and take out fifteen Films of Blood.

That's my favourite part of horror, probably - when you start screwing with sexual notions. I felt I had a real feel for the story and I knew I couldn't pull any punches. I pull no punches.\"\n\nProducers Talk Barker's Madonna Adaptation\n\nBy [ ], Shock Till You Drop.com, 22 October 2008 (Note: full text online at www.shocktillyoudrop.com)\n\nJoe Daley : \"It's such an interesting story. The Madonna is this creature that lives in this abandoned bath house. The men that enter this cavern are slowly turned into women. You deal with such horrific fears these men share in the presence of the Madonna, in her lair, with these women that live in this place. It's a total taboo.\"\n\nProducers Talk Barker's Madonna Adaptation\n\nBy [ ], Shock Till You Drop.com, 22 October 2008 (Note: full text online at www.shocktillyoudrop.com)\n\nIn The Hills, The Cities\n\n...Anime might be just about the only way to realise In The Hills, The Cities without a ludicrous CGI budget... and after seeing the stylish delivery of Ryuhei Kitamura on Midnight Meat Train, this would be in very safe hands...\n\n\"We also have, with Mr Kitamura who made Midnight Meat Train, a number of anime projects, one of which will be, hopefully, In The Hills, The Cities which was one of the stories from The Books of Blood which didn't, could not conceivably be made as a live-action movie. And it was Mr Kitamura who came to us and said, 'Hey, how about this as an anime?' and I thought that was a sensational idea. So I think that anime, certainly as far as the West is concerned, anime has not been even remotely used, exploited as a genuine source of horror filmmaking. Obviously in Japan it has been, though the tongue has often been close to the cheek in Japanese anime. I think there's a real case for making really, really dark, spectacular horror movies in anime form because many of the stories - In The Hills, The Cities would certainly be an example - but there's a story called The Skins Of The Fathers, for example, which is a sort of Lovecraftian story from The Books of Blood which again requires huge monsters; sort of Cthulhu-sized monsters, which is inconceiveable as a live-action movie but would be wonderful as an anime.\"\n\nInterview\n\nBy Blake, Cinema Is Dope, Sitges, 16 October 2009\n\nPig Blood Blues\n\n...Following the demise of Vincent Perreira's script for Seraphim in 2003/4, (see Films That Got Away...) the Pig Blood Blues project was handed over to Seraphim's own Anthony Diblasi.

I think Pig Blood Blues is relatively imminent in the sense that the script is finished and everybody loves it.\"\n\nWeird Fantasy\n\nBy Joe Nazzaro, Starburst, Special No 76, July 2006\n\n\"Anthony's Pig Blood Blues is phenomenal and has been bought and he will direct it.\"\n\nPinhead's Progress\n\nBy Phil and Sarah Stokes, 15 and 22 December 2006 (note: full text here)\n\n\"We're doing another movie called Pig Blood Blues next year.

It relates to the boys in this borstal and they give themselves to it wholeheartedly. The pig is a very powerful entity in this story, so right now we are talking about getting this giant pig right. I don't want it to be like Razorback, which relied a lot on fast cuts and quick glimpses... Instead I want people to really relate to this creature.\"\n\nThe Pig Chill\n\nBy [ ], SFX, No 191, February 2010\n\nAnthony Diblasi : \"We're doing that one through Phoenix... We'll be casting soon. Being a foreign sales and independent picture we're not setting up domestic distribution for it yet but we're gearing up for another five months, could be sooner...\n\n\"To me, 'Blues' is a twisted take on a classic ghost story... I love stories about outsiders and those kids at this juvenile detention center were certainly outsiders. It has this amazing 'Lord of the Flies' element with all these boys trapped together and this evil entity is stuck in there with them. Where the short story just touches on the supernatural element, I focused a lot on making it a ghost story. But keeping the pig, of course.\"\n\nBooks of Blood Movie Updates\n\nBy Ryan Rotten, Shock Till You Drop.com, 1 May 2007 (Note: full text online at www.shocktillyoudrop.com)\n\nChristmas Horror Story II (The Yattering and Jack)\n\n...Copperheart Entertainment has plans to adapt The Yattering and Jack as part of its sequel to the 2015 anthology feature, Christmas Horror Story...\n\nSteven Hoban (Copperheart Entertainment) : \"There's a Clive Barker story, The Yattering and Jack, that we want to put in the sequel.

I met with him many years ago when I was too inexperienced to be seriously considered to direct it. He knows how passionate I am about the story. If I could do anything, it would be that film. Some day maybe he will let me direct it. You hear me, Clive?

In fact, it's the story that made me want to become a filmmaker. I even had a meeting at Clive's house years ago to convince them to let me adapt it, but it was clear to me that I needed practical experience in order to do it justice. It's not an easy story to tell. So I made the decision right there staring at the many fantastic paintings at Clive's house, that I would go away, leave my day job, learn how to make films and come back some day to make Jacqueline Ess for Clive.\n\nAll these years later, Jacqueline Ess came back to me. And I wasn't going to let her slip through my fingers again. I'm so grateful to Raven Banner and Clive for believing in me and my vision of the story. At the risk of sounding hyperbolic, there really is nothing like it. There is some shit in this movie that will probably get all of our funerals picketed! It is my intention to make a film that is as much a gift to Clive as him choosing me to adapt it is a gift to me.\"\n\nWomen in Film: An interview with Jovanka Vuckovic, director of Jacqueline Ess\n\nBy Prerana Das, Toronto Film Scene.ca, 18 June 2014 (Note: full text online at thetfs.ca)\n\n\"I think the movie shows every sign of being really a class act and, you know, we have a female director, obviously a female star, a female protagonist and I'm excited, very excited. And I've always loved Jacqueline Ess; I've always wondered what kind of mind it would take not only in the director but also in the actor or actress, to actually pull that off. And I think, I know now that I have the answer to that question. And Lena [Headey], as you know, has sort of cornered the market in beautiful monsters, you know?...\n\n\"I talked to [Jovanka Vuckovic] last time I was in Toronto and she said how much she wanted to direct and one thing led to another - we were absolutely sympatico about using Lena, I wanted her as much as they did, so that was great, and, you know there's many a slip twixt cup and lip and I'm never confident that everything will go well but right now it feels very nice.\"\n\nBeautiful Monsters\n\nBy Phil and Sarah Stokes, 30 May 2014 (note - full text here)\n\nChristian Francis : \"I am so excited to be involved in"
