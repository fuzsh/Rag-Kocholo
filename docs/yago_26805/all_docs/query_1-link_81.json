Written and directed by Clive Barker (Nightbreed) and based on his popular short story The Last Illusion (from Books of Blood Vol. 6), the 1995 cult film classic LORD OF ILLUSIONS stars Scott Bakula (“Quantum Leap”), Kevin J. O’Connor (The Mummy), Famke Janssen (X-Men, Taken, “Hemlock Grove”), and Daniel Von Bargen (Crimson Tide, The Faculty).\n\nOn December 16, 2014, SCREAM FACTORY™ is proud to present Clive Barker’s LORD OF ILLUSIONS Collector’s Edition 2-Disc Blu-ray Set on home entertainment shelves everywhere.
