        "text": "Wednesday December 06th 2017 at 04:30 PM\n\nUSA - 1995\n\nLenght : 121 min // Ratio : 1.85 // Format : dcp\n\nLanguage : English // Subtitles : French\n\nDirecting by: Clive Barker\n\nWriting: Clive Barker\n\nCinematography: Rohn Schmidt\n\nMusic: Simon Boswell\n\nProduced by: Clive Barker, JoAnne Sellar\n\nCast: Scott Bakula, Famke Janssen, Kevin J. OâConnor\n\nDistributor: Park Circus\n\nPrivate investigator Harry d'Amour is specialised in occult matters. He is hired by the wife of a famous magician threatened by members of a fanatic cult who await the resurrection of a guru called \"The Puritan\" â¦ When the husband dies on stage, D'Amour takes things in hand to stop them for good.\n\nA successful novelist, particularly known for the Blood Book series, British writer Clive Barker has also done well as a director with three world-famous films: Hellraiser, Nightbreed and Lord of Illusions. Less popular than the two first, Lord of Illusions has nevertheless become over time one of the most unique works of the 90s, especially the director's cut version (screened at the festival) that Clive Barker eagerly operated after his film was terribly edited by the MGM for the purposes of cinema distribution."
