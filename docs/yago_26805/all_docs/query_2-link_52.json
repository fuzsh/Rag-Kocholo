        "text": "Besides The Strangers, there isn't much on the slate this summer when it comes to horror. Previously I asked if this was the downfall of the genre, but I doubt we'll ever truly get to that point. The next horror film on the schedule is one called The Midnight Meat Train, directed by Japanese filmmaker Ryuhei Kitamura and based off of a Clive Barker short story. I wouldn't say I'm excited to see it, but it looked like one of the most original horror films in a while. Unfortunately STYD learned that Lionsgate is planning to only release it in 100 theaters nationwide on August 1st, not the release Barker and Kitamura were hoping for. In retaliation, Barker himself has started a viral campaign to get Lionsgate to change their mind.\n\nClive Barker commented via the Official Clive Barker Resource that he is in support of this viral campaign and wants to help in any way to save this film from being buried by Lionsgate. He is asking all who would like to see the movie get the wide distribution that many people believe it deserves to add their voice.\n\n\"I am very excited about this possibility and I would passionately encourage everybody who cares about my work to use this chance to change the minds of the folks at Lionsgate. This is exciting! I really think, this late in the day, that grassroots support for our movie could significantly improve our chances of reaching a much bigger audience theatrically. The picture is worth the effort, I believe.\"\n\nIf you're interested in helping out, you can head to this link on IMDB where information has been posted on how you can contact Lionsgate and show your support for Midnight Meat Train. If you're debating whether or not you should support this film, the most I can do is point you towards this trailer that was released late last year. It should give you a good idea of what to expect. Beyond that, the decision is up to you, but if this movie is as good as I'm hoping, it may actually be worth it. STYD gave it a fairly positive review back in May and I said previously that I do think it looks pretty damn good."
