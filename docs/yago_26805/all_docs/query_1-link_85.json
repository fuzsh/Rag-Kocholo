        "text": "United International Pictures\n\n1995\n\nR\n\n“I was born to murder the world.”\n\nBack in the early 80s, a very dangerous and mystical cult leader named Nix was buried alive by a former cult member named Swann. Still trying to figure out what happened to that baboon, though. Thirteen years later, and Swann is a very successful magician…er, I mean illusionist, and all seems well that ends well…until those formerly associated with Swann start dying mysteriously and rumors about Nix’s resurrection start surfacing. Enter Detective Harry D’Amour, a P. I. with a specialty in the weird, mystical and unknown. After Swann’s apparent death, D’Amour journeys into the dark side of illusionists, and discovers there is a difference between illusion and magic…and nothing is at all what it seems…\n\nClive Barker. What I wouldn’t give to get inside that wonderfully dark and twisted mind of his. When it comes to horror / fantasy, Barker is definitely in a class all his own. I mean, it’s one thing to be tormented by nightmarish dreamscapes…it’s another thing entirely to bring those unique nightmares to vivid life without loosing any of the darkness in the translation. Very few I’ve found can do that…\n\nLord Of Illusions was adapted by Barker from his short story “The Last Illusion” from part six of his Books Of Blood series (later reprinted in the States as Cabal). As a matter of fact, Harry D’Amour is a recurring character in his other stories and novels, kind of like a supernatural noir detective. Here, in movie form, he’s played by Scott Bakula in an effectively subdued manner (once I managed to separate him from his Sam Becket character on Quantum Leap, he fit the part rather well, like an old strait jacket). Matter of fact, everyone here played their respective parts in a very subdued yet intense way, without hamming it up or going over the top. Even the cracked-out skinhead played it down a bit…and you just have to watch it to get what I’m meaning here…\n\nVisually, Lord Of Illusions is a very dark and fascinating place. From the opening scenes in the cult flophouse (baboon!!!), to Swann’s illusionist show, to the final showdown with Nix and the brainwashed followers, the entire movie is full of Barker’s usual thematic explorations- flesh, sex, and death…okay, um, not much sex (which is odd, considering Barker’s style), but heavy doses of flesh and death, and the supernatural horrors taht lie beneath the surface.\n\nThere were some things about this movie that didn’t hold up well for me, though. Some of the special effects were a bit dated (as this was released in 1995, not really that big of a surprise), especially that scene involving what I referred to during the viewing as Floating Origami Grid Guy…again, you have to view it to understand what I’m getting at.\n\nThat said, I’d say Lord Of Illusions is a movie that takes a general horror premise and twists it into something different. In fact, that’s usually Barker’s MO. This thing got panned by critics when it came out, but don’t let that deter you from watching this movie. Check it out for a night of twisted, mind-bending fun…"
