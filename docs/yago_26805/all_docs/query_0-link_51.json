It’s directed by Clive Barker, and based one one of his short stories that features his recurring character of occult investigator Harry D’Amour, played by Scott Bakula in a solid performance.\n\nThe plot is honestly very difficult to describe, both because I want to avoid spoilers and because it just is genuinely so weird. I definitely recommend the movie, but it gets very silly frequently. It doesn’t have a consistent tone, but it is consistently interesting.\n\nRating: 6/10"
