        "text": "I watched a Clive Barker movie last night called \"Midnight Meat Train.\" Yes it is exactly what the title says it is and true to Clive Barker's movies but the theme of the movie is about a struggling photographer who takes to photographing a city at night and his camera is a Leica M with 50 mm F2 Summicron. The camera designation is blacked out so can't tell which M but since there are no red arrows appearing in the rangefinder scenes I gather it's not a 6 or 7. The camera is shown a lot in the movie and I find it interesting with all the comparisons of DSLR, SLR to Leica that the Leica would be chosen to represent photojournalistic street photography over the Nikons and Canons and that film is still the media of choice. Not a great movie but worth the watch as the guy seems to actually know how to use the camera."
