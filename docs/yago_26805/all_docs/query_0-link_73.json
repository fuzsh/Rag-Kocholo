        "text": "Clive Barker rose to pop culture prominence in the early '80s, his renown (both famous and infamous) supported by the poetically intricate print found in the pages of a book. Actually, in Barker's case it was books, as in the Books of Blood, the series of short story collections which brought his work to the attention of the world at large (and earned him kudos from Stephen King, no less). While it has undoubtedly been Barker's written works of the fantastique that have helped vault his name into the hallowed halls of great practitioners of fiction, it is ultimately his celluloid ventures which have reached a broader audience and left an indelible scratch on the minds of those who never seem to have the time (or inclination) to read a good book.\n\nThe author of more than 10 novels, innumerous short stories and plays, and an accomplished illustrator and painter, Barker has also written and directed three major motion pictures, directed several artsy b/w shorts, and even found the time to write and/or produce several more films, both inside and outside the horror/fantasy genre.\n\nIn fact, the only other modern author to have as many screen credits (writer, director, producer) attached to his name is mega-author Michael Crichton.\n\nAt any rate, while Clive's main staple of income continues to be generated from the tales he spins onto the page, his cinematic achievements are no less important and exhilarating. Although Barker has had his hand in many areas of film development (screenwriter (Candyman), director (see below), producer (Gods and Monsters)), I have chosen to focus on the films to date which Barker has both written and directed (i.e., these are the films, that, for the most part, Barker has had the majority of creative control over).\n\nSalome/The Forbidden\n\nBarker's earliest foray into celluloid dementia came in the form of two short B/W films made back in the early '70s during his collegiate days in England.\n\nThe first of the two shorts, Salome is a grainy B/W affair based on the Oscar Wilde play of the same name. Filmed with muted light, heavy shadows, and w/o sound (except for a spacey, electronic type score), it is a weird collage of dreamlike nightmares that eventually leaves the viewer feeling disconnected and disturbed. Barker fanatics will find the find of special note as Clive's collegiate mate, Doug Bradley makes an appearance here (Bradley would later become Pinhead in the Hellraiser films).\n\nBarker's second short, The Forbidden, is loosely based on the Faustian legend, and follows suit in that it also is rendered in B/W filmstock, is rife with moody lighting, and also is silent, save for a swelling neo-ambient score. It too is of particular note to Barker fans in that touches upon themes of the flesh and also contains, what many believe to be the first appearance of the puzzle box (both themes and images Barker would later expand upon in Hellraiser.)\n\nWhile these films prove to be intriguing (especially if viewed through a red-eyed haze of some sort), they are ultimately geared toward the Barker fanatical\n\nHellraiser\n\nBarker first hit the big screen with 1987's Hellraiser, which is still considered by many to be one of the best modern horror flicks to emerge in the last century. Most horrorophiles are familiar with the Cenobites (led by the foreboding Pinhead), the golden puzzle box which opens a doorway to another dimension (a common theme in Barker's work), and the examination of the limitations of the flesh (yet another running thematic in Barker's work). Barker's deft handling of the film, which was shot on a miniscule budget (by today's overblown standards) helped create a brooding, well-paced supernatural thriller unlike anything ever seen before on the screen. And Barker's chum, Doug Bradley, instilled the nail laden Pinhead with sufficient demonic aplomb and thus helped create a character who joined the ranks of Freddy, Michael, Leatherface, and Jason as a modern horror icon.\n\nNightbreed\n\nBarker's second feature film, 1990's Nightbreed, was based on his 1987 novel Cabal. A slightly more mainstream picture than Hellraiser, Nightbreed once again examined the permutations of the flesh, this time in the form of an ancient race of shapeshifters hiding from the world in an underground realm called Midian.\n\nThe story centers around Boone (Craig Sheffer) who has been having nightmares of Midian for years. Convinced by his doctor (eerily rendered by David Cronenberg) that he is mad, he escapes from the city and eventually makes his way to Midian where he uncovers his secret face.\n\nFar less compelling, creepy or hideous than Hellraiser, Nightbreed contains some unsettling visions, creative monster effects, and a fairly decent amount of gore.\n\nLord of Illusions\n\nIn 1995 Barker unveiled his third, and perhaps most ambitious, feature length effort, Lord of Illusions. A combination Mike Hammeresque murder mystery and occult soaked thriller, the film featured Scott Bakula in the lead role as detective Harry D'Amour, a sadsack gumshoe with a penchant for the supernatural. Drawn to LA on a case, he is inevitably sucked into the world of master illusionist Phillip Swann (Kevin J. O'Conner). The film wanders between gritty private dick terrain and bizarre dreamlike transference. Excellent supporting characters and one of the screens truly creepy villains is rendered in the form of Nix (the pudgy Daniel Von Bargen). Toss in Famke Janssen in one of her earliest (and muy sultry) roles, some exquisite and twisted scenes of gore, and you've got yourself one damn intriguing picture that gets better with repeated viewings.\n\nAs for Barker's future film work, he is currently helping Universal bring his book The Thief of Always into realization. He is also in negotiations with New Line to write and direct a \"gothic\" horror film, and is in the process of bringing The Books of Blood to the screen, as well."
