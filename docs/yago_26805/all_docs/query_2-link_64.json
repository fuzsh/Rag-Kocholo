        "text": "Though Doug Bradley's “Pinhead” first appears in Hellraiser, he is never actually referred to by this name. Even in the credits for Hellraiser, he is simply called \"Lead Cenobite.\" In early drafts of the script and even the source novella for the movie, he is referred to as Priest. Pinhead was simply a nickname picked up on set. And, much to Barker’s dismay (he felt it was rather undignified), it quickly caught on.\n\nIn the 2011 Hellraiser comic series, Barker restored the name Priest in favor of Pinhead, and has said that Priest does in fact have a real Cenobite name, one which he plans to reveal later down the line.\n\nHaving been adapted from Clive Barker’s novella, The Hellbound Heart, Barker wished for the film adaptation to have the same name. Unfortunately, due to the studio fearing this would make it sound like a romance movie, the title was vetoed.\n\nBarker then suggested the more apt (though possibly tongue-in-cheek) title Sadomasochists From Beyond the Grave. When that title was inevitably turned down, one of the older crew members took everyone by surprise when she threw in her two cents for a title suggestion. “One of the very English, very proper ladies working on the set said it should be called What A Woman Will Do For A Good F***,\" Barker claims.\n\nAlthough the studio wasn’t wild about it, they eventually settled on the title Hellraiser.\n\nAlthough 1986’s Clive Barker had a bunch of experience directing theater, he had little to none where film was concerned. But he was adamant that he’d be directing his next project himself - after being very unhappy with his stories that were adapted to the screen by other directors (Underworld and Rawhead Rex).\n\nIt was at this point that Barker bumped into his future collaborative partner, Chris Figg, who always wanted to produce movies. Barker mentioned to Figg that he’d always wanted to direct movies, and thus began their partnership. As Barker himself said, “Two inexperienced people is always more interesting as a combination than one inexperienced person.”\n\nBarker and Figg put together a Hellraiser package that consisted mainly of the script, half a dozen drawings, and some log lines for what the two were trying to accomplish. As luck would have it, when the two flew out to the states, the first studio they pitched, New World International, agreed to give them a shot.\n\nThankfully, not only was Barker allowed to direct, but he was also lucky enough to work with a cast and crew that was completely on board with helping him achieve his vision. Pinhead actor Doug Bradley said, “I knew with Clive at the helm it was going to look good and the dark side of it would be absolutely to the fore.”\n\nClive Barker and Doug Bradley went to school together in Liverpool, England. Their first encounter with each other was at a rehearsal for a school play. It was at this stage in Barker’s life that he was writing, directing, and starring in his own plays, which is where the two hooked up and Bradley started starring in original plays by Barker himself.\n\nIt was around 1985 when Barker first mentioned the concept for Hellraiser to Bradley, who by this stage had already read the manuscript for The Hellbound Heart novella. A year later, they began filming Hellraiser.\n\nToday, it’s easy to see the Cenobites have a distinctly gothic S&M vibe about them, but back in 1986, this wasn’t a look most of the Hellraiser film crew were familiar with. Most of what the costume designers had to go on were the descriptions from Barker himself, who confirmed the source of his inspiration in an interview with The Guardian:\n\nThe look of the Cenobites, such as the pins in their leader’s head, was inspired by S&M clubs. But I was emotionally inspired by them, too. On S&M’s sliding scale, I’m probably a 6. There was an underground club called Cellblock 28 in New York that had a very hard S&M night... It was the first time I ever saw people pierced for fun... The austere atmosphere definitely informed Pinhead: \"No tears, please. It’s a waste of good suffering!\"\n\n...And I got a good reaction from the S&M crowd - and still do. I was validating a lifestyle. It was a celebration of the beauty of these strange secret rituals.\n\nTo help with this S&M inspiration, Jane Wildgoose (Cenobite costume designer) received a Piercing Fans International Quarterly magazine, as well as some notes from the director, on the Cenobites' look.\n\nThese notes suggested “areas of revealed flesh where some kind of torture has or is occurring” and “something associated with butchery involved,” followed by very Barker-esque turns of phrase like “repulsive glamour” and “magnificent super butchers.”"
