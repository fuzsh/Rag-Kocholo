        "text": "What is there to say about this movie that came out in 1995? This thriller, horror, mystery movie was not the most popular movie of the time. Many people did not even know that it exist. However, the graphics both special effects and computer animated took you on a ride to remember. Though the computer graphics are quite dated now the gore and anguish seen in this movie made me want to come back for more thrills.\n\nThis movie is about a private investigator sent on a job in Los Angeles to find a tax evader. Yes he does find him but from that point on there is nothing but ghoulish terror afterwards. Scott Bakula plays the private detective which caught me off guard due to the fact I only remembered him from the Quantum Leap series which he played a time traveler trying to save people from tragedy. Now, this movie he is trying to save people from tragedy but it does not work when you are against illusionist and people using dark magic to corrupt and destroy everything in its path. Harry (Bakula) follows his mark to a fortune teller who has been brutally tortured by a member of a cult that existed many years before this point. This man is destroying all the people who killed his leader in order to resurrect his leader named Nix a powerful illusionist who was sent to destroy the world. After Nix’s student Swann betrays him because he knows Nix was going to sacrifice a young girl for ultimate power the cult is decidedly upset but not as much as Butterfield a sadist with a pension for sharp objects and human flesh.\n\nButterfield’s murder of the fortune teller leads Harry to Swann. A now active illusionist who fears his and his wife’s death after hearing of the fortune teller being murdered. The carnage does not stop there, when Harry starts to get to close he learns of the evil nature that exist in the magic realm and of Nix’s cult. The movie then focuses on Harry and Swann going after the evil terrified of what is to come.\n\nThe movie is great in my opinion. I think it some kind of cult following movie realms this movie may get some money in order to make a remake with better darker special effects that could be invested into this movie to make it more terrifying than it is now due to the development of movies. In fact some actors/actresses we could use would be David Harbour as Nix, Paul Bettany as Butterfield, Anna Kendrick as Jennifer Desiderio, and Edward Norton/Nicolas Cage as Harry. Their I worked it out for you. Haha. Well I hope you enjoyed this post. I do appreciate you reading and I suggest besides the dated graphics this is a good watch for you horror fans."
