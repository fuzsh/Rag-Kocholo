        "text": "LORD OF ILLUSIONS is a film I haven’t seen for at least 10 years, it felt like a natural choice to include as part of 90s Horror Movie Month. You can see my experience as I live tweeted while watching the film.\n\n@supermarcey\n\nAll I remember about this film is liking it and that Scott Bakula was hot #LordOfIllusions\n\nThe text at the beginning is really cool, I like magic and this definitely deals with it in a different way #LordOfIllusions\n\nI don’t remember this desert opening credit sequences at all! My memory sucks #LordOfIllusions\n\nI think it’s cool that Clive got to write the script and direct the film, that man genuinely is frightening #LordOfIllusions\n\nOne of the guys in the crowd looks like George R. R. Martin #LordOfIllusions\n\nI swear the young dude that went into the tent thing was on Return Of The Living Dead 3 #LordOfIllusions\n\nWhat the fuck is up with this beginning and why is a girl chained up and a baboon in the same room? #LordOfIllusions\n\nThis beginning is weird but I do like it, it’s also messed up #LordOfIllusions\n\nI never want to be stuck in Clive Barkers dreams, bloody hell he thinks of some weird shit #LordOfIllusions\n\nOff the bat the effects are really damn solid and nightmare inducing #LordOfIllusions\n\nWhy don’t they shoot the crazy monster dude in the head? #LordOfIllusions\n\nWait what he hell is that they put on his head? Looks like a metal face hugger #LordOfIllusions\n\nAnd here we are 13 years later with Scott Bakula showing off some sexy arms #LordOfIllusions\n\nHe hasn’t aged much in 20 years either #LordOfIllusions\n\nHe’s a P.I. that’s right I remember and he’s into weird stuff … #LordOfIllusions\n\nOk what the fuck was that nightmare flash?? #LordOfIllusions\n\nClive Barker I am holding you responsible for any nightmares tonight #LordOfIllusions\n\nI think Scott Bakula is keeping a little too close to the guy he’s spying on #LordOfIllusions\n\nAhhhh fucking hell a damn jump scare! #LordOfIllusions\n\nWhat is with all these weird characters? Did they just jump out of a David Lynch film? #LordOfIllusions\n\nScott Bakula randomly throws a guy (prolly on PCP) out a window. No wonder I liked this film #LordOfIllusions\n\nHe just walked away from the fall out the window, not a bad trick #LordOfIllusions\n\nSo these guys want to resurrect that cult leader dude? I kind of remember the story now #LordOfIllusions\n\nWhy hello Famke you’re looking well today #LordOfIllusions\n\nSo the dude at the beginning who put the facehugger thing on the other dude is now an illusionist #LordOfIllusions\n\nThings make more sense now, haha I thought I would have remembered more d’oh #LordOfIllusions\n\nNo fucking way!? Swann in this was Beni in The Mummy? Mind blown! #LordOfIllusions\n\nProps to how great the film looks and the lightning is excellent. This illusionist show is spectacular #LordOfIllusions\n\nAlso there’s guys in gstrings dancing #LordOfIllusions\n\nThose swords probably shouldn’t be stabbing him … When illusions go wrong #LordOfIllusions\n\nYeah he wasn’t meant to kill himself on stage, the cult did it! Ahhh run #LordOfIllusions\n\nPretty sure Scott Bakula didn’t ask for this messed up assignment he’s just a P.I. yo #LordOfIllusions\n\nWow that cummerbund is shocking! #LordOfIllusions\n\nWhat is this a meeting of the illusionists counsel #LordOfIllusions\n\nThe wardrobe choices in this film are questionable #LordOfIllusions\n\nNaked Scott Bakula! Yay #LordOfIllusions\n\nThere’s a very nice vibrant colour scheme in this film, visually it’s just so nice to look at #LordOfIllusions\n\nHurry up and get what’s going on Scott Bakula, the audience already knows! #LordOfIllusions\n\nI definitely remember the film a lot better now, it’s crazy #LordOfIllusions\n\nI wonder if illusionists like @MurraySawChuck and @MrSilverScott like this film? #LordOfIllusions\n\nWhat the? Is that a hologram projection? Too damn funny #LordOfIllusions\n\nWhoa hello Famke nipples showing through her dress #LordOfIllusions\n\nOh do I smell a sex scene coming ? #LordOfIllusions\n\nMore shirtless Bakula!!! Woohoo #LordOfIllusions\n\nAh mid 90s cgi, how I love thee #LordOfIllusions\n\nI love how he’s shooting his gun at fire … Yeah it doesn’t work that way mate #LordOfIllusions\n\nI like the tattoo they gave Bakula for this film! Oh and neat plot twist regarding Swann #LordOfIllusions\n\nDamn Beni from The Mummy can levitate cars #LordOfIllusions\n\nWhat’s with the spandex gold pants? The films wardrobe really is pretty dreadful #LordOfIllusions\n\nThis dude is pretty dedicated to this Nix fellow. He even has kept those bleached eye brows for 13 years #LordOfIllusions\n\nHe did a shit job of tying up Famke #LordOfIllusions\n\nWhat the fuck is going on? Why are they cutting their hair into the fire? #LordOfIllusions\n\nI’m still stunned about Beni being Swann! Like how did that happen? This dude is unreal! #LordOfIllusions\n\nDo you think Nix would want this guy to wear that gold spandex? I can’t really think of why else he’s wearing it #LordOfIllusions\n\nThe Dark Knight Rises totally stole the chanting from this movie #LordOfIllusions\n\nWait what’s with the velvet gold top? To go with the gold spandex? Weird #LordOfIllusions\n\nNix looks like one ugly mofo, incredible work though he looks terrifying #LordOfIllusions\n\nNix looks like one of those people who have had too many face lifts and plastic surgeries #LordOfIllusions\n\nIf I were Nix I would want a refund on that resurrection #LordOfIllusions\n\nI really have no idea what wisdom Nix has, but there’s a vagina on his forehead #LordOfIllusions\n\nI will say this again I never want to be inside Clive Barkers nightmares or hell even know what goes on in that mind #LordOfIllusions\n\nDude Beni just puked fire! He could have used that in The Mummy #LordOfIllusions\n\nNix is a bit of a bastard #LordOfIllusions\n\nNix kinda looks like Jason in Jason X … WTF #LordOfIllusions\n\nPoor Beni/Swann just can’t catch a break #LordOfIllusions\n\nIt’s Nix vs Bakula! #LordOfIllusions\n\nShe did what should have been done at the start, the headshot! #LordOfIllusions\n\nWhat’s with the badass FX? Seems too good for 1995, great work! #LordOfIllusions\n\nOk hopefully Nix has fallen back into @RealCliveBarker’s imagination #LordOfIllusions\n\nHe’s still not dead? Oh bloody hell #LordOfIllusions\n\nOk he better be gone now #LordOfIllusions\n\nAnd that’s the end, i hope I don’t have nightmares if I do it’s @RealCliveBarker’s fault #LordOfIllusions"
