        "text": "Clive Barker’s name is synonymous with the horror genre. Short stories such as Hellraiser and Candyman have been adapted to the big screen and horror icons have been born. His work, mainly Gods and Monsters, have even been nominated for Academy Awards. One of his more popular and recent works is the 2008 film The Midnight Meat Train. We spoke to Ryuhei Kitamura for his new film The Price We Pay and when we asked him about adapting future Clive Barker properties, he not only revealed his enthusiasm for adapting more of Barker’s stories, but he even said Barker once mentioned a title for a sequel to Midnight Meat Train:\n\nRyuhei Kitamura: I’d love to! Me and Clive [Barker] became very good friends and we talked about a lot of things and the one thing he wanted me to do, and something I wanted to do, was this video game called Jericho that he did for the Xbox. Do you remember that?\n\nBSL: I’ve heard of Jericho, yes.\n\nRyuhei Kitamura: Yes, that one. You know, I love Jacqueline Ess and it was announced that somebody was doing the movie for that but it’s not happening. Believe it or not, me and Clive had an idea for the sequel, Midnight Meat Train 2.\n\nBSL: That’s awesome! Anything you can say about that?\n\nRyuhei Kitamura: (laughs) Not really. But one day, he came to the set when I was shooting and he went “Hey, I came up with the title. Butcher’s Boy“. Butcher’s Boy – Midnight Meat Train 2, that’s pretty cool. I don’t know, anything is possible in this world so maybe someday?\n\nFor those who don’t know, Kitamura directed Midnight Meat Train, a film based on the 1984 Clive Barker story of the same name. The film follows photographer Leon, played by Bradley Cooper, as he tries to track down a serial killer dubbed the “Subway Butcher”, played by Vinnie Jones. However, things quickly go wrong. Released in 2008, fans of Barker’s work have long praised the story and it’s widely considered to be one of the best adaptations of Barker’s work. With the cliffhanger ending of the first film, a sequel would be fun to see.\n\nThe Price We Pay is out on VOD and will play in select theatres on January 13. Stay tuned for the rest of our chat with Kitamura!"
