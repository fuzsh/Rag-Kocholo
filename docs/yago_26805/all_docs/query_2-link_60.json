        "text": "I love horror, and Hellraiser is one of the best horror movies I have in my big collection. (I've got the six first). Sure the second, fourth and sixth are really bad movies, but the rest are great. But Clive Barker is far more than Hellraiser. And sure I hated Nightbreed (it just wasn't scary at all), but that's about all experience I have with him.\n\nCan someone recommend me a great horror novel by Barker? I know he has plenty of those, so how come I can't find any? Is it simply because I don't know where to look or what to look for? I read a synopsis of a few of his books (Galilea and one about some photographer or something), but they sounded incredible boring.\n\nHow come I can't find any horror novels from one of the best modern horror writers there are?\n\nThe thing is, after those early novellas, he hasn't done much in the way of horror. His new novel, Mister B. Gone, is horror and his early stuff (The Books Of Blood and The Damnation Game) are horror. But the rest if pretty much fantasy, of sorts. You may enjoy The Damnation Game - it's similar to The Hellbound Heart, in its Faustian storyline.\n\nMy personal favourites are Sacrament and Galilee, but they are not horror. Next year, finally, I hope, we'll get The Scarlet Gospels, which is a sequel to The Hellbound Heart.\n\nSequel to Hellbound Heart? Does that fit into the movies, or is he restarting Hellraiser entirely? Guess we'll have to wait and see. I love Hellbound Heart, both book and movie. I can't wait for a sequel.\n\nI had the fortune of meeting him back in 1999 and he said that he'd love to write something that finally killed of the Pinhead character for good, as he wasn't happy with what the films were doing. And rightly so, the films from Hell On Earth (Hellraiser III) were terrible.\n\nThen a few years later he did a book of erotic short stories and photography, called The Scarlet Gospels, which was never released. The title then got used in a collection of short stories which has yet to materialise. But one of those short stories has assumed The Scarlet Gospels as its title and has grown into a full length novel which, as usual, has yet to see the light of day. But it's on Amazon for pre-order, despite the publication date constantly pushing into the distance.\n\nApparently he wants to remake Hellraiser - rather than let anyone else do it - and I presume the idea is to introduce new aspects into the remake so that it ties in better with the new developments of this sequel. Whether this remake gets made, who knows.\n\nI love Clive's work. He creates some wonderful fantasy. Horror? It's not scary Horror, more macabre and twisted.\n\nI would also recommend you read Damnation Game. The books of Blood are also worth a look and with many of his short stories having been/to be turned into movies, read them before watching. The films are generally rubbish but fun to watch where the stories are very strong.\n\nJust finished Mister B. Gone and it was ok, for a novella. A bit sily in places and not in any way horrific. A bit gory perhaps. I've gone back to the Great and Secret Show again becasue that is one of my favourites.\n\nAlso looking forward to Abarat 3 and Scarlet Gospels.\n\nI think Hellraiser is one of the worst movies ever. Everything about it is shit, besides the comical \"scary\" effects and gore. I just tried to watch the second one about an hour ago, and turned it off after five minutes. The first one was hard enough to sludge through even when I was a kid, and seeing it all again just made me cringe and want to vomit (not because of the gore).\n\nPinhead is a cool looking character though.\n\nI love the first Hellraiser movie. It's completely nightmarish. It scared the shit out of me when I was younger. Everything about it is just creepy and has that feeling of being wrong. It's corrupt somehow. I love it. I know they are remaking it and I hope the new one does justice to the original.\n\nI haven't read too much of Clive Barker's books but I did thoroughly enjoy The Great and Secret Show."
