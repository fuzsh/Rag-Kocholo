        "text": "A few days ago I sat down and rewatched Clive Barker’s Lord Of Illusions, a film that I feel doesn’t get enough credit with many horror fans. I was first interested in this movie when I saw the poster for it at my local movie theater. Something about that image enticed me and it was always on my mind. When I was old enough, I rented the VHS and sat down to watch this supernatural-horror-meets-film-noir that I’d been eager to see for years. Much to my chagrin, it was awful. Full of plot holes and jarring edits, it was a mess of a film. Being a big Clive Barker fan, I was crushed.\n\nA few years later I decided to give the film another shot, thinking that I had been too harsh the first time around. What I didn’t realize was that this time I had rented the Director’s Cut, not the theatrical version that I had previously seen. Suddenly, the film made sense and everything clicked. Again, while not a perfect piece of cinema, it became a much stronger, far more cohesive experience that allows it to hold up to multiple, very enjoyable viewings.\n\nPerhaps one of my favorite aspects of the film is Simon Boswell’s engaging, unique, and beautiful score. Boswell also composed for such films as Phenomena, Bathory: Countess Of Blood, Demons 2, among others. It’s one of those scores that sticks in your mind, much like A Nightmare On Elm St. or The Exorcist.\n\nBoswell deftly mixed terrifying, demonic choirs (such as in “Resurrection” and “God’s Eyes”), sexy jazz horns (“The Detective”), and surreal, ambient pieces (“What Are You Looking At”) as well as thrilling cues that were meant to evoke the experience of attending a magic show (“Flesh Is A Trap”, “Swann’s Last Act”). The combination of these themes and motifs makes Boswell’s score something of a journey. It is easy to join Harry D’Amour (Scott Bakula) as he tries to understand the connection between Phillip Swann (Kevin J. O’Connor) and Nix (Daniel von Bargen), all while trying to protect the beautiful Dorthea (Famke Janssen).\n\nBoswell’s score, to this day, remains one of my favorite horror soundtracks.\n\nGot any thoughts/questions/concerns for Jonathan Barkan? Shoot him a message on Twitter or on Bloody-Disgusting!\n\nI think part of our collective fascination with serial killers comes from an empathetic desire to uncover exactly what needs to go wrong for a human being to snap and turn into a murderer. That’s why it makes sense that this form of morbid curiosity lies at the heart of so many successful horror stories, with countless genre filmmakers trying their best to explore the minds of predators.\n\nAnd in honor of M. Night Shyamalan’s latest thriller expertly allowing us to see through the eyes of a cold-blooded murderer, we’ve decided to come up with a list highlighting six other serial killer movies told from the killer’s perspective. After all, there are plenty of interesting cinematic killers out there, and not all of them are as charming as Josh Hartnett in Trap.\n\nAs usual, don’t forget to comment below with your own murderous favorites if you think we missed a particularly thrilling one. And while we won’t be including it on the list, I’d also like to give a shout-out to Chris Nash’s avant-garde slasher In a Violent Nature, which follows a Jason-Voorhees-inspired murderer as he embarks on a vengeful rampage.\n\nWith that out of the way, onto the list…\n\n6. Mr. Brooks (2007)\n\nI can’t be the only one who wishes Kevin Costner did more horror movies. While Bruce A. Evans’ deep dive into the mind of a fractured man is more of a psychological thriller than a proper scary movie, it’s still proof that Costner can be legitimately terrifying when he chooses to be.\n\nTelling the story of a seemingly normal man who secretly struggles to keep his murderous alter ego under control, Mr. Brooks doesn’t exactly re-invent the serial killer wheel with its ruminations on addiction, but you can’t help but sympathize with Costner as his double life spirals out of control.\n\nAnd if you like this one, don’t forget to check out our interview with the director as he explores the film’s unmade sequels!\n\n5. Maniac (1980)\n\nIt’s rare that both a horror film and its remake are equally good explorations of their respective subject matter, but since we already included Franck Khalfoun’s Maniac on our list recommending six experimental slashers, today I’d like to highlight the grimy thrills of William Lustig’s 1980 original. It may not feature the same POV gimmick as its 2012 successor, but Maniac still does a phenomenal job of putting viewers in the shoes of a deeply disturbed individual.\n\nFollowing a murderous landlord as he slays (and scalps) his way through New York City, this brutal character study is only enhanced by its low production value and seedy Manhattan backdrop. Lustig makes the most of eerie street corners and dark alleyways here, making this film a memorable portrait of urban chaos – as well as one hell of a disturbing gore-fest.\n\n4. The House that Jack Built (2018)\n\nEven Lars von Trier’s more conventional films tend to tackle controversial subject matter, but The House that Jack Built takes the director’s penchant for dark stories to the next level with its portrayal of a deeply malevolent man that embodies all the worst traits of famous serial killers. Feeling a lot like an art-house companion piece to American Psycho, this mean-spirited romp is so gruesome that you often forget it’s meant to be satirical.\n\nFrom animal cruelty to the disturbingly realistic slaughter of innocent women, this is one of the most uncomfortable movies on this list, but it also features a mesmerizing performance by the incredibly talented Matt Dillon. That alone already makes it worth the price of admission. I wouldn’t recommend this one to duck lovers, though.\n\n3. Peeping Tom (1960)\n\nMoral panics are nothing new, especially when it comes to media depicting grisly acts of murder. And while some desensitized viewers might not understand why this 1960 thriller nearly ruined its director’s career, I think Peeping Tom still holds up as one of the UK’s earliest example of schlocky exploitation.\n\nA surprisingly meta story about the thrills of watching others die on celluloid, Peeping Tom introduces us to an aspiring filmmaker who secretly murders women and produces snuff films about their dying moments – a decidedly modern premise for a movie produced decades before the slasher craze.\n\n2. Man Bites Dog (1992)\n\nOne of the most shocking examples of Found Footage/mockumentary filmmaking that doesn’t involve the paranormal, this pioneer Belgian flick is way more influential than most genre fans give it credit for. Inspiring everything from Behind the Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon to What We Do in the Shadows, Man Bites Dog is another case of storytellers using serial killing as an excuse to explore our fascination with violent media.\n\nAnd while the film is presented as a serious documentary about a charming murderer who slowly recruits the filmmakers to his cause, it’s the satirical undertones that make it so effective. That being said, you’ll likely forget the humorous elements when Ben commits some of the most heinous acts ever put on film.\n\n1. Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986)\n\nHenry: Portrait of a Serial Killer is loosely inspired by claims made by real life murderer Henry Lee Lucas (as well as his partner in crime Otis Toole), and while most of the supposed 600 deaths once attributed to Henry have since been proven to be false confessions, John McNaughton’s low budget character study escapes its sensationalist True Crime origins due to its honest and unflinching portrayal of antisocial behavior.\n\nFrom the gritty 16mm photography to the frighteningly realistic death scenes, there’s plenty to love about this controversial indie flick. However, the film’s greatest asset is a young Michael Rooker in a career-making role as our disturbed main character.\n\nJust make sure you don’t choose this one for family movie night."
