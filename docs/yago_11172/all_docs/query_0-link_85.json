        "text": "Hiten Tejwani has managed to win hearts of co-contestants (read: lovelorn Arshi Khan) and the ardent Bigg Boss viewers.\n\nHiten Tejwani is one of the most sought-after contestants of the Bigg Boss 11 house. The handsome television actor who was ruling the hearts of audiences with his romantic hero image in the early 2000s took an interesting step by becoming a part of Indian television’s most controversial reality show. But the man with calm demeanour has managed to win hearts of co-contestants (read: lovelorn Arshi Khan) and the ardent Bigg Boss viewers. People are not only loving Hiten’s cool and composed temperament but also his ideal family man personality. It is no secret he is married to television actress, Gauri Pradhan for past 13 years. Fans of TV’s favourite couple are aware of their fairytale love story, which began while shooting for an advertisement for a soap brand. The video of the good-looking pair is too good, too romantic and simply too perfect to miss.\n\nHiten and Gauri instantly became television’s most loved pair after starring in Ekta Kapoor’s successful daily soap, Kutumb. But before doing a serial together, the two appeared in a commercial for Breeze soap. The ad showed Hiten completely smitten by Gauri’s beauty as the two meet during a wedding. After a series of sweet meetings, the two fall in love with each other. This advertisement makes you feel super mushy and makes us believe in fairytale ‘Happily Ever After’ endings.\n\nAfter this TVC, they went on to do Kutumb with their characters Pratham and Gauri quickly getting love from all quarters. They were appreciated for their set of acting skills but it was their crackling chemistry that remains unforgettable. Hiten and Gauri also starred in marathon K-serial, Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi as cross lovers, Karan and Nandini.\n\nTheir on-screen chemistry soon translated into an off-screen romance. After two years of courtship, they finally got married in 2004. It is no secret that Hiten was a divorcee before finding his true love in Gauri. The couple was blessed with twins, a son named Neevan and a daughter named Katya. We saw the cute family during the Bigg Boss 11 premiere when Gauri along with kids had come to see off Hiten. Their fans are definitely backing and hoping the actor to win the title on Salman Khan’s show."
