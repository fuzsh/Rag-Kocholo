Hiten Tejwani wooed his co-star, Gauri Pradhan, with food! The actor gets candid about his epic love story exclusively to The Free Press Journal. Excerpts:\n\nWhen and how did you first meet Gauri?\n\nI first met Gauri at the airport. I mean, our eyes met. We were going to Chennai to shoot an ad. When we landed, the agency guys introduced us.\n\nWho played Cupid?\n\nWell, we started shooting for our show Kutumb, and that is where we bonded. Nobody knew, and when people heard we were getting married, they were surprised.\n\nDid the bell begin tolling immediately, or did that happen later?\n\nI liked her the moment I saw her, but I thought there would be no way to meet her after the ad. She was this girl who sat in one corner reading a book. She would come when the shot was ready and, once it was okayed, would go back to reading her book. In sharp contrast, I was all over the place, laughing and joking with everyone. Fortunately, Ektaa Kapoor cast us together in Kutumb, and I got to know her. Thereafter we started going out.\n\nWhat do you like about her?\n\nShe cares a lot, but she is not very demonstrative. She told me she was very happy when she heard that I was cast opposite her.\n\nWhat was the ice-breaker?\n\nI would get homemade food for her, a separate dabba of whatever my mom cooked.\n\nWho took the initiative to fix a date?\n\nIt was mutual. Like, let’s go for dinner or maybe a drink. I remember once she had made a plan, and I couldn’t go; she was really upset.\n\nWhere did you go for the first date?\n\nWe sat by the beach in Madh Island.\n\nDid you guys go Dutch?\n\nShe insisted she would pay, but I didn’t let her. Thereafter we would take turns.\n\nWhat did you take for her on your first date?\n\nI would take her to a 5-star bar every day. I took perfume the first time I went to meet her.\n\nWho said I love you first?\n\nThere was no need to say I love you because we were both in love.\n\nHow many times in a day would you speak with her?\n\nThe entire day and sometimes all through the night.\n\nWho is more possessive?\n\nI am a shade more than her.\n\nWho is the funnier one?\n\nI am. Gauri says she doesn’t need to switch on the TV when I am around.\n\nWho is more short-tempered?\n\nGauri gets really upset when I don’t keep things in their designated place. She keeps everything prim and proper. She is a cleanliness freak while I make a mess of my cupboard when I have to take out a shirt.\n\nWould you both fight during your courtship?\n\nWe hardly fought. But even if I committed a mistake, even a small one, I would say sorry.\n\nWho proposed marriage?\n\nI did. She was shooting at Madh Island. I dropped on the sets and slipped a ring on her finger. It was my birthday gift.\n\nDid you face any opposition when you were ready to marry?\n\nNope. I would like to thank my parents and her parents for this. They were happy then and are happy today too. And even today, our love for each other as a couple is the same as it was when she was my girlfriend."
