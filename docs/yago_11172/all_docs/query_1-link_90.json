        "text": "Confession time: I was sincerely rooting for Hiten Tejwani as the winner while he was in the Bigg Boss house. (I am equally happy for Shilpa Shinde too. Congratulations, girl!) But speaking of Hiten, he was the perfect package, always calm & composed with a cool head. Moreover, he was the family guy amongst all the dudes in the house. His emotional meeting with his wife Gauri Pradhan and his little kids was quite stirring, TBH. And of course, it doesn’t hurt that he is good-looking too!\n\nWhen Gauri sent a motivational message for her hubby, Hina had a rather nasty analysis on it. Later when Gauri visited the house, she even told Hina that it was not her place to comment on it, as the message was for Hiten only. Previously, Hina had also said that she was surprised when Hiten married Gauri as the latter doesn’t mingle with anyone.\n\nPost the finale, when Hiten was asked about Hina’s statements, he told a leading daily:\n\nI am a social person and Gauri isn’t. As they say, opposites attract each other. Hina does not know me or Gauri well enough to comment on my marriage. I would not respect her views if she has said that.\n\nIrrespective of what Hina says, we love Hiten & Gauri. They are straight up #LoveGoals!"
