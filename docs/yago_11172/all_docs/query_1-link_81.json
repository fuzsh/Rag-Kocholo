However, the makers of the show have yet not unveiled the names of the participants but suddenly, on Friday, television couple Hiten Tejwani and Gauri Pradhan started trending on the Internet. Several media outlets reported that both Hiten and Gauri have been approached for Bigg Boss 11. \"Getting a couple always adds more drama and fun and staying true to the custom, the makers have zeroed in on Hiten-Gauri this time. Hiten is already on board and since Gauri is shooting for Tu Aashiqui, the makers are currently graphing out her participation,\" a source told Indian Express.\n\nIn the previous seasons, the Bigg Boss house has hosted couples such as Bakhtiyaar Irani and Tanaaz, Keith Sequeira and Rochelle Rao, Suyyash Rai and Kishwer Merchantt and Apurva Agnihotri and Shilpa. While Sana Khan and Monalisa married their respective boyfriends on the show.\n\nOf Hiten and Gauri's participation, the source further told Indian Express, \"Gauri doesn't shoot regularly for Tu Aashiqui and has only given around 15 days to the production. Things are still being discussed to adjust her absence as the couple is keen to enter the show together.\"\n\nHiten Tejwani, 43, and Gauri Pradhan, 40, fell in love on the sets of Kutumb and have been married for over 13 years now. They are parents to son Nevaan and daughter Katya. Hiten and Gauri have also been co-stars of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi.\n\nMeanwhile, it is also being reported that television actress Hina Khan, will also be part of Bigg Boss 11. The format of the show changed last year as non-celebrity contestants were also invited. The format remains unchanged this year but some padosis (neighbours) have been invited and four of them have already been introduced.\n\nBigg Boss 11 starts from October 1 and will be at 10:30 pm on weekdays and the primetime slot has been allotted for the weekends.\n\nEntertainment I Read Latest News on NDTV Entertainment.
