        "text": "About the Couple\n\nThe daughter of a retired Army Major, the Maharashtrian beauty moved from Pune to Mumbai to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. Besides pursuing her roles in TV serials, Gauri whose other passion is psychology is doing a course in counseling and hopes to set up practice as a counselor soon. Sindhi dude Hiten hails from Borivili in Mumbai. He has done numerous modeling and television assignments and has acted in “Joggers Park” and “Krishna Cottage”.\n\nHow they Met\n\nThe beautiful pair met in Hyderabad at the shooting of a commercial for ‘Breeze’ soap; later on, they were cast together in the television serials Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and Kutumb, and their reel romance translated into real-life romance too. “The fact that people kept saying we make a wonderful couple on television really helped, and we soon realized that we’d make a wonderful couple off-screen too”, quip the models turned successful actors.\n\nA Simple Affair\n\nThe wedding was held on the morning of April 29, 2004. The venue was Pune’s Sun-n-Sand Hotel and was conducted as per Maharashtrian customs. Says Gauri: “All the arrangements were made by my parents and it was a simple affair with 40-50 close friends and relatives. Thanks to the fact that my parents were doing everything, I only had to take care of buying my clothes and accessories. Of course, I had to help Hiten with buying his stuff too. Since my parents were in Pune, and I had a hectic shooting schedule my close friends actress Mayoori Kango and journalist Arshiya Kapadia helped me co-ordinate the shopping bit.”\n\nThe Reception\n\nSays Hiten: “We also wanted a quiet and simple celebration without too much noise or fanfare. And since we didn’t invite too many friends or professional acquaintances for the wedding, the reception at Juhu’s Army Club on May 9, 2004 was a relatively big affair with over 400 guests. We didn’t have a stage-like setting, but were at the entrance and mingled with all the guests. The dÃÆ’©cor was simple and the menu included a Mughlai spread and some Chinese dishes.”\n\nWhat they Wore\n\nFor the morning pheras Gauri wore a yellow georgette sari with kundan and pink zardozi work that she teamed with a pink blouse and a pink dupatta that covered her head. “I picked the creation from Jaipur, a popular boutique in Juhu, that sources creations from Rajasthan, I really like their stuff and my friend Mayoori (hyper-link to article on Mayoori) also picked her bridal wear from there. I accessorised it with an antique gold set and Pandhari Jhuker, the veteran make-up artist did my make-up. Hiten wore a cream churidar kurta for the pheras.” For the reception in Mumbai, Gauri picked an orange and rani pink lehenga from Hauz Khas, a boutique on Juhu Tara Road. Hiten wore a suit from Mumbai’s Shoppers Stop.\n\nLife after Marriage\n\nAfter the wedding the newlywed beach lovers spent a relaxing week at Kohsamui, a beautiful island located an hour away from Bangkok. They now live in Andheri’s Oshiwara area in the same flat which Gauri and her actress friend Mayoori Kango shared earlier. “Since we are both leading a very hectic schedule, we haven’t had time to locate a new place yet but will do so soon”, says Tejwani who now makes special efforts to finish his shooting schedule early and come home by 10 p.m. every night.\n\nRelated Articles:"
