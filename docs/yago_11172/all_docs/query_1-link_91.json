        "text": "Hiten Tejwani and Gauri Pradhan are one of the OG couples of the Indian television industry. The two met on the sets of a TV show, worked together as a reel-couple and ended up falling in love for real . It doesn't get better than this! We first saw the couple on-screen in Kutumb and later Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi and while it's been close to two decades, we still smile when we see the two of them together. The couple are parents to eight-year old twins, have been married for fourteen years, and have know each other for almost two decades... and their social media PDA is better than it ever was. Mainly to spread smiles and make you believe in true love, here's a look at their social media cuteness.\n\nSneakily filming your wife, while at the movies: check!\n\nHere's another one.\n\nAndd one more...\n\nIf this doesn't define forever we don't know what does!\n\nThe photo's cute and Hiten's captions are cuter.\n\nHoliday done right. This vacation happened right after Hiten came out of Bigg Boss season 11.\n\nGotta love this fam jam!\n\nAnd this one.\n\nThe duo sure knows how to get into the Holi mood.\n\nAnother #Holifie\n\nSo cute.\n\n‚ù§\n\nThat's Diwali done just right.\n\nPlaying dress up... and totally winning the game!\n\nThey keep getting cuter, and cuter!\n\nWe are also totally in love with Hiten's photo caption skills!\n\nNo seriously guys, take notes!\n\nWho isn't going to love that?!\n\nOh and did we mention how much we love their holiday selfies?!\n\nOne more #Holidayfie\n\nAnd that caption....\n\nJust.\n\nLook.\n\nAt.\n\nThem!\n\nWho can forget their beautiful interaction in Bigg Boss?!\n\nToo cute.
