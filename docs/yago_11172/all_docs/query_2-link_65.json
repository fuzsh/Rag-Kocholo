        "text": "TV actor Hiten Tejwani is currently in the Bigg Boss house and has not yet been involed in any controversy in the show. His gentleman image is intact despite he participating in Bigg Boss 11.\n\nThen again, it doesn't take much time to land into controversies for a celebrity. Hiten is a known TV actor, and his wife Gauri Pradhan is also quite popular. They were first seen in 2000's TV show Kutumb, and started dating from there.\n\nThe lovebirds subsequently tied the knot, and are now a happy family with two kids. But Hiten's life has not been perfect. He had a bitter past, like many of us.\n\nDid you know Gauri is not Hiten's first wife? Yes, you read it right. Hiten was married for 11 months to someone else before Gauri. We found an old article on India Forums — posted on July 18, 2005 — that gives us more information.\n\nHiten had been quoted in the post as saying: \"Yes, I was married once, before Gauri entered my life. I didn't want to talk about it. Divorce isn't the best thing that can happen to anyone.\"\n\nHiten divorced his first wife in 2001, and took the blame for the failure of the relationship. He had said the reason for the divorce was he wasn't able to give time to his then-partner.\n\n\"After a bitter experience, I've realised that it's better to get married to a person you love. My marriage with Gauri (Pradhan) is the best thing that could ever happen to me. We know each other inside out. Also, since we're in the same profession, it helps us understand each other better,\" the actor had said.\n\nHere's everything to know about Hiten:\n\nThe TV actor is known for his work in serials like Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi, Kutumb, and Pavitra Rishta.\n\nHe is father of two twins -- one boy named Nevaan and daughter named Katya.\n\nIn 2007, Hiten appeared on Koffee With Karan along with Ram Kapoor and Ronit Roy."
