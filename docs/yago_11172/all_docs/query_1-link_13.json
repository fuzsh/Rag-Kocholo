        "text": "The audience is always curious and eager to know more about it's favourite actors. Their likes, dislikes, hobbies...everything is of interest to the aam junta. But what really interests the people is an actor's personal life and dark secrets. Actor Hiten Tejwani is the man in question. That he is a popular and sought after actor is common knowledge. But very few know that Hiten aka Karan Virani of Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi fame was much married (and divorced) before he tied the knot with his current wife Gauri Pradhan. Tejwani who has been married twice in the serial as well, has never spoken about his previous marriage that resulted in a painful divorce. Reason? He's always been sceptical about revealing too much about his personal life. \"Yes, I've been married once before,\" he confesses. So why was this truth hidden from the public, media and his fans for so many years? \"I didn't want to talk about it. Divorce isn't the best thing that can happen to anyone.\" Hiten who had an arrange marriage, divorced his first wife in 2001. He blames himself for the failure of his first marriage. He also says that a communication gap drove them apart from each other. \"I'd started my career around the same time I got married. Probably I couldn't give her the time she deserved. It's said that, in an arranged marriage, love happens after you get married. But in my case, it never happened.\" So, the two decided to put an end to their eleven- month marriage and moved on in different directions. Hiten says that he is not in touch with his ex wife. But we found out that the former Mrs. Tejwani resides in Malad and is currently working in a call centre. Hiten believes in marriage being a lifetime commitment. \"After a bitter experience, I've realised that it's better to get married to a person you love. My marriage with Gauri (Pradhan) is the best thing that could ever happen to me. We know each other inside out. Also, since we're in the same profession, it helps us understand each other better.\" Was Gauri okay with the fact that her then boyfriend was a divorcee? \"Initially, Gauri had her reservations!\" he says. \"When I proposed marriage to her she was reluctant about making a decision but everything settled down after I answered all her queries.\" Apparently, his parents were miffed with him for divorcing the girl they chose for him. \"My parents were upset initially but they realised that its best to part ways now than do it when there are children involved.\" We totally agree with that!\n\n* I didn't want to talk about it. Divorce isn't the best thing that can happen to anyone. After a bitter experience, I've realised that it's better to get married to a person you love"
