        "text": "The ouster of Hiten Tejwani from Bigg Boss 11 sent shock-waves across fans. One of the most suljha hua contestants of the season, Hiten was out of the show and even Salman Khan was visibly upset about it. He told him that he played the game with grace and dignity and that would be missed inside the house. While Vikas Gupta, Puneesh Sharma and Arshi Khan voted for Hiten, others like Luv Tyagi, Hina Khan, Akash Dadlani and most shockingly Shilpa Shinde voted in favour of Priyank Sharma. Many saw it as a tactical move from Shilpa's side to eliminate Hiten to strengthen her position inside the house.\n\nWife Gauri Pradhan tweeted about her husband writing: Proud to be his wife #Bringback Hiten. The actress had entered the house last week with the kids. She told Shilpa Shinde that she was sweet and playing well. She also told Hina Khan that her message for her husband, to be a leader and not a follower was not meant to be analysed. We wonder what Gauri must be feeling about Shilpa right now. The Bhabhi Ji Ghar Par Hain actress defended her decision saying that Hiten was too diplomatic and that kind of game plan did not suit this stage of the game.\n\nThe actor who has part of the industry for nearly 20 years endeared himself to many on the show. His cute flirting with Arshi Khan was one of the nice things of the show. The actor forged a great friendship with Vikas Gupta on the show. Since, they mutually agreed on many things, they stuck together. He was funny even in the drag avatar. The actor who was last seen on the daily soap Gangaa has done films as well. This is his first major reality show.
