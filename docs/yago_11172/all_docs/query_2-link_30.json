        "text": "Television star Hiten Tejwani, who is currently seen in Bigg Boss 11, is not making much noise in the house. But to be fair to him and the show, it has only been three days since he went inside the Bigg Boss 11 house as one of the participants.\n\nHiten's current image in the house may be squeaky clean, but that was not always the case. Just like everyone, Hiten too has a past that is not perfect. Before tying the knot with his Kutumb co-star Gauri Pradhan, did you know the actor was previously married to a woman for 11 months?\n\nadvertisement\n\nYes, you read that right. And the reason the actor has never spoken about his first marriage is because it is painful.\n\n\"Yes, I was married once, before Gauri entered my life. I didn't want to talk about it. Divorce isn't the best thing that can happen to anyone,\" India Forums quoted the actor as saying.\n\nHiten divorced his first wife in 2001, and took the blame for the failure of the relationship, stating that the marriage suffered probably because he wasn't able to give time to his then-partner.\n\nAccording to the same report, Hiten is not in touch with his first wife. But he is glad that he found Gauri, who according to him, had her own reservations about his first marriage, but later relented.\n\n\"After a bitter experience, I've realised that it's better to get married to a person you love. My marriage with Gauri (Pradhan) is the best thing that could ever happen to me. We know each other inside out. Also, since we're in the same profession, it helps us understand each other better,\" the actor told India Forums.\n\nEarlier it was speculated that Hiten's wife Gauri would also make an appearance in the show as a participant, but that didn't happen. But Gauri thinks Hiten is the perfect candidate for the show.\n\n\"Nothing affects Hiten, he seldom loses his cool. He is malleable. He will not differentiate between celebrities and commoners and will mix with both. One doesn't need to fight or hurl abuses to become popular. I have just told him to be a leader and not a follower. He should stand up for the right reasons,\" Gauri had told BollywoodLife.\n\nWhen asked about why she refused to participate in the show, the actress said, \"My Temperament is not conducive for the show. Hiten and I are opposites, while he is even-tempered, people call me Jhansi Ki Rani.\"\n\nYou can find out more about the actor by tuning in to Bigg Boss 11 tonight at 10:30 pm."
