        "text": "As Salman Khan returns with Bigg Boss 11, there are a host of interesting candidates but the first celeb who entered the house was none other than Hiten Tejwani, the TV actor who found fame with Kyunki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi. The actor appeared on Bigg Boss 11 with wife, actor Gauri Pradhan, and both were seen dancing to a Salman Khan hit from Prem Ratan Dhan Paayo.\n\nAfter bidding goodbye to his wife and both his children, Hiten entered the house as first celeb guest. Speaking to Pinkvilla before the launch of the show, Hiten said, “The exact point of me going inside the house is. I want to win and come. I have no clue what is going to happen inside, so I can’t plan anything but let’s see. I think I will just try and be myself and take a stand on what is right or wrong. I will try to be a little calm and composed like I am in real life.”\n\nDebuting on TV 17 years ago with Ghar Ek Mandir, Hiten has worked in shows such as Kabhi Sautan Kabhi Saheli, Kahin Kissii Roz , Kya Hadsa Kya Haqeeqat, Kutumb, and, of course, Kyon Ki Saas Bhi Kabhi Bahu Thi among others. He met Gauri on the show and the two married in 2004.\n\nCheckout our live coverage of Bigg Boss 11 premiere here."
