When you have the most compatible spouse and a wonderful family, who would not flash a million dollar smile? This is the sweet and simple love story of Television’s most favourite couple. We have seen Hiten and Gauri indulging in some nok-jhok in their serial. But in real life, they hardly fight. Here is the cute love story of this lovely couple who is everyone's favourite.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRecommended Read: The Beautiful Love Story Of Indian Television Couple Gurmeet Choudhary And Debina Bonnerjee\n\nThe First Meeting\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nBefore their serial Kutumb, Hiten and Gauri shot for a commercial for Breeze soap.

We were on our way to shoot for an advertisement and we didn’t even know that we were paired with each other. The agency introduced us at the Hyderabad airport after we landed.\"\n\nThese self-made people are a self-made couple as well. They did not need anyone to be their cupid. They took their time, getting to know each other and then committed.\n\nadvertisement.\n\nMust Read: 10 Television Couples Who Have Been Married For Over A Decade And Reinstate Our Faith In Love\n\nadvertisement\n\nadvertisement\n\nHiten explains about the progress of their relationship as:\n\n\"She just said hi and bye to me for about six months, and then one day madam smiled at my jokes. I told her, ‘You must be laughing out loud at my jokes in your room right?” We started talking after that, then we started going out and we knew that we are serious about each other.\"\n\nWhile working for their much-loved serial, Kutumb, their chemistry grew. Hiten, an extrovert and Gauri, an introvert, got attracted to each other. But, this attraction was not enough to get a girl like Gauri to marry. According to Hiten, she was a little reluctant at first and he had to do a lot of wooing before she finally said yes to his wedding proposal.\n\nADVT.\n\nAlso Read: 9 Types Of Quirky And Bold Choker Necklaces Every Girl Should Try This Season\n\nadvertisement\n\nRevealing About His 1st Marriage\n\nHiten had been married earlier and told Gauri everything before they tied the knot on April 29, 2004. Before tying the knot with Gauri Pradhan, he was married for a brief period of 11 months. Though he never revealed the name of his 1st wife, but he shared that it was an arranged marriage which never resulted in love happening after marriage. He took the blame upon himself for his first failed marriage and divorce that took place in 2001. He said that he was the one who wasn't giving enough time to his marriage because of his work commitments. Due to lack of communication and love, his first marriage resulted in divorce. Talking about his failed marriage and divorce, he once said:\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Yes, I was married once, before Gauri entered my life. I didn't want to talk about it. Divorce isn't the best thing that can happen to anyone.\"\n\nHe thinks that his decision to marry Gauri was the best decision of his life. Talking further about his marriage with Gauri, Hiten once said:\n\n\"After a bitter experience, I've realised that it's better to get married to a person you love. My marriage with Gauri (Pradhan) is the best thing that could ever happen to me. We know each other inside out. Also, since we're in the same profession, it helps us understand each other better.\"\n\nThe Wedding\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe wedding was a private ceremony that took place on April 29, 2004, in Gauri's hometown, Pune. The couple hosted their wedding reception in Mumbai on May 9, 2004, for their industry friends and well-wishers. Bangkok was the destination they chose for their honeymoon.\n\nTake a look at these 7 Bollywood-Inspired Locations That Should Be On Your Bucket List For A Perfect Honeymoon\n\nadvertisement\n\nHaving known each other for such a long time, you can calculate the goods and bads of the person easily.
