        "text": "Grand Duchess Victoria Melita received a few important guests in the hotel, including Mr. Boris Brasol, who was the official representative of the Grand Duke in New York,[3]as well as several members of the press. Her day ended with a small dinner in her rooms with her retinue, Mrs. Loomis, Mrs. Lansing, and “a few elite invited guests.”[4]\n\nThe next morning, Grand Duchess Victoria’s schedule began in earnest. Mrs. Loomis had arranged for a motorcar tour of the highlights of New York City. The drive included Central Park, Riverside Drive, Park Avenue, Fifth Avenue, Times Square, and a few other sites of interest. The Grand Duchess was very interested in the sheer scale of the city and the density of its population. The press commented that the Grand Duchess took far more interest in the Lieutenants Brown, Murphy, Kelley and Nerman, her motorcycle escorts, and the men from the bomb squad who were part of her entourage, than in many of the sites in the city. The Grand Duchess frequently asked after their wellbeing as they stood in the cold, rode on the running boards of her automobile, and waited for her in the chilly December weather. In the late afternoon, the Grand Duchess returned to the Waldorf to rest, and was presented by her entourage with a book of crossword puzzles that was all the rage in New York. The crossword puzzle was a new American craze, and had completely captured the public’s attention. The Grand Duchess accepted the gift and retired to rest and change.[5]\n\nThat afternoon, with Mrs. Loomis at her side, the Grand Duchess had a full-fledged press conference with members of the local and national press corps. The topics were wide and varied, and Mrs. Loomis confided later in a letter to a friend:\n\nShe is so easy and pleasant, particularly with the press. It is remarkable how kind she is to them. She is genuinely interested in their questions, and has infinite patience even for the stupidest and least tactful among them. She is somehow both serious and gay, which is no mean feat. I later asked her Imperial Highness if she were tired after the meeting with them [the press] ‘Oh, no,’ she said, ‘How could I be? Everyone here is so happy and bright, it is hard not to feel it oneself. How lovely a country this is!’[6]\n\nThe conference avoided politics, and when questions of succession or finance arose, the Grand Duchess skirted them with elegance, often returning to comment on the beauty of some of New York’s buildings, or the kindness of its citizens that she had met. When asked about American women, she smiled and answered: “I had always been of the opinion that American women were the best-dressed in the world, and after seeing them at tea and then at a formal dinner as I did yesterday, I am convinced they are… certainly the last word in fashion. In addition they are very charming, and I am having an extraordinarily good time.”\n\nThe dinner on the first night in Philadelphia read like a “Who’s Who” of Main Line Philadelphia Society. In the “Pink Room” of the Bellevue Strafford Hotel, the Grand Duchess was received by Chapter 2 of the Colonial Dames of America, as well as the Kuhns, Drexels, Biddles, Dukes, Van Rensselaers, and Sculls, before proceeding into the Grand Ballroom for the main entertainments. The Grand Duchess entered, making a great impression dressed in a black velvet evening gown with silver trim, as the entire room rose to their feet for the Russian Imperial Anthem played by the Philadelphia orchestra engaged for the occasion[13]. Mrs. Scull, wearing the second-class silver medal of the Russian Imperial Red Cross which had been presented to her during the war by the Russian Ambassador Count Cassini on behalf of the Empresses Maria Feodorovna and Alexandra Feodorovna, introduced the Grand Duchess to each of the more than 200 guests who had arrived in Philadelphia for the occasion.\n\nThe following day, the Grand Duchess was taken on a tour of Philadelphia, but mostly, the press noted her elegant clothes and comportment, rather than her impressions of the city. The press commented on her Romanoff heirloom jewelry, fur-trimmed brown suit and matching brown shoes with sensible heels. It noted that the pale blue accessories worn with her brown ensemble matched her eyes, “the same color as those of her cousin, the Prince of Wales’.” Despite a degree of confusion over her title (Philadelphians were not really sure whether she was an empress, a grand duchess, a princess, or “the Queen of Russia”), her important status was acknowledged by the people of the city.[14] The Grand Duchess left Philadelphia for Washington, and one may presume that she and her party were in high spirits. Press reports do not indicate anything other than smooth sailing, until the Grand Duchess arrived in Washington. As the Grand Duchess and her party made their way towards the nation’s capital and the very large events there planned by Mrs. Lansing, word may have come to the party that all was not well in New York.\n\nOn the eleventh, a piece was published from Paris via the Chicago Tribune which ran in the New York Times, claiming that 300,000 émigrés had sworn to back Grand Duke Nicholas, and that the remains of the Russian Imperial Army had sworn loyalty to him. The article further went on to outline Grand Duke Nicholas’ plans to create a constitutional assembly, and to list the names of the organizations that supported him, including the Union of Russian Officers Abroad, and the Monarchist and Nationalist Union. The article roundly denounced Kirill and his claim, and made particular note of the fact that the Parisian papers were full of scorn for the important reception currently being offered Grand Duchess Kirill in the United States, particularly papers which referred to her as the Tsarina. The article made it clear that while Grand Duke Kirill had the better and only legal claim to the throne, he was “profoundly unpopular” and that most émigrés had thrown their support behind Grand Duke Nicholas, including General Baron Wrangel. All of this information in the Times appears to have little corroborating support in European papers of the time, indicating that it may, in fact, have simply been a reprint of a propaganda leaflet printed in Paris at the time, sent to New York by supporters of Nicholas [15]\n\nThat evening, the Grand Duchess attended a dinner at the great house of Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt at 640 Fifth Avenue. Grace Vanderbilt was known for the splendors of her entertainments, and the dinner for Grand Duchess Victoria was no exception. Many of the major social and political figures in New York were there. Official Washington might have turned its back on the Grand Duchess, but cosmopolitan New York would do no such thing. The list of guests who dined in Grace Vanderbilt’s Louis XVI dining room reads like the Social Register, filled with Astors, Vanderbilts, Whitneys, Morgans, Phippses, Van Rensselaers, Livingstons, Bakers, Dukes, and Webbs. The Cantacuzènes, Shouvaloffs, and Troubetskoys were in attendance, and even the Countess Tolstoy made the list.\n\nGrand Duchess Victoria released an official statement the next day: she published two complete English translations of Grand Duke Kirill’s Manifesto, the full texts of both letters made public by Grand Duke Nicholas, and Grand Duke Kirill’s responses to them. She added an important coda: a statement from Grand Duke Kirill’s Paris headquarters which had been widely published in Europe, but not yet seen in the United States—which contained the following quote:\n\nThere are and there can be no aspirants nor candidates for the Russian throne other than the Romanoff dynasty, and as to that dynasty, the Russian Law is precise and imperative in designating the Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich to be the direct and legitimate heir to the Russian throne upon the death of the Emperor Nicholas, as well as that of his son and his brother. The succession to the throne has always been announced to the Russian people directly through proclamation of the Emperor who has ascended the throne.[29]\n\nThis statement is important to westerners seeking to understand the process of Russian Succession: the use of the phrase “self-styled” or “self-proclaimed” was often used to diminish Kirill, implying that he was the only person who saw himself as Emperor, and that the manifesto was somehow an illegal or usurpatory act. In fact, unlike Western Europe, where the accession of a monarch is frequently announced by a parliament or by a chief officer of the court, in Russia, each Emperor announced his own accession for the same reason they crowned themselves at the coronation; under Russian Imperial Law, the Emperor was the ultimate authority, and no one but the Emperor could make such an announcement. Kirill was simply following the Fundamental Laws to the letter with his manifesto of 1924. Copies of the letters written by Grand Duke Kirill made their rounds, and Countess Orlov made a statement on behalf of the Grand Duchess:\n\nThe Grand Duchess Cyril regrets that certain ill-informed persons should have taken the occasion of her visit to this country to publish certain documents and correspondence In an effort to ascribe a political significance to her visit in spite of her previous disavowal of such intent. This correspondence has been public property in Europe since September last. The publication of the single letter from the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna cannot but give a false and misleading impression without the knowledge of the antecedent correspondence to which it was written in reply. Solely in the interests of a correction of this false impression, the Grand Duchess wishes me to give to the press copies of the English translation of the preceding letters written by her husband, the Grand Duke Cyril, to the Dowager Empress and to his uncle, the Grand Duke Nicholas, without comment from her.[30]\n\nIn November 1924 Mother received an invitation to visit the United States, and was away for a month. She was very well received in America, where a number of big receptions were organized in her honour. The moral success of her visit was very considerable, which was only natural, as she was an exceptional woman in every sense. Her brilliant intellect, her profound knowledge of life, and her great presence never failed to win the hearts of all with whom she came in contact.\n\nIn accepting this invitation my mother had one end in view - to further my father's cause in America, and in this she undoubtedly succeeded. It was rumoured at the time that her object was to collect funds, but this was untrue. Mother had no such object in mind, and considered it far more important to establish connections with prominent Americans who were interested in the Russian question.\n\nMother's journey was a cause of great anxiety to Father, and he eagerly awaited news from her all the time.[40]\n\nPerhaps the final word on the visit of Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna comes from Harald Graf, head of the Chancellery-in-Exile, who deeply regretted that the visit ultimately fell into a sort of self-sabotage. Too many emigrés objected to the visit, and some of the members of the highest nobility were insulted to see their Sovereign lady on a charity tour. Graf mentions that he was deeply pained that the donations which were inspired by the Grand Duchess’ visit were ultimately given by Mrs. Loomis to the International Red Cross, as the Committee for Russian Relief had been disbanded in 1924. Graf believed that if those unsolicited donations had been given instead to the Russian Imperial House and had been allowed to be distributed by them to the relief charities they supported in Paris, Coburg, and Berlin, a great many Russians would have been helped and support for the Imperial House would have grown among émigrés. The Grand Duchess refused to accept any of the funds which were accumulated as a result of the visit. Sadly, the Grand Duchess was castigated by her family and many Russians for attempting such a bold effort.\n\nIt is poignant to remember that the idea for the trip began when Grand Duchess Victoria’s sister, Queen Marie of Romania, introduced her to Mrs. Spreckles through whom Mrs. Loomis was introduced. Grand Duchess Victoria wrote extensively to her sister about the trip and its organizers, and ultimately about her disappointment in the final result.\n\nQueen Marie however, thought that the charity tour idea still had merit, and so on the 18th of October 1926, HM Queen Marie of Romania arrived in New York to cheering crowds and a ticker-tape parade. Invited by businessman Sam Hill and danseuse Loïe Fuller, Queen Marie arrived with her two youngest children, Prince Nicolas and Princess Ileana for an American-Canadian tour that would net Romanian charities millions. What was unacceptable for Grand Duchess Victoria was widely praised when done by Queen Marie. Grand Duchess Victoria was, perhaps, a bit too “modern” for people’s taste, and as always, perhaps, a little ahead of her time.\n\nThe visit of Grand Duchess Victoria Feodorovna to the United States is a fine illustration of several constants: that the Russian Imperial House has a long and fruitful history of relationships with Americans via visits to the US, that the Imperial House has always felt the United States and its people to be kind and generous and has considered American support important, and that it remains grateful for American support for Russia and for Russians abroad.\n\nendnotes\n\n[1]Erin Allsop, Waldorf-Astoria Archivist, Telephone interview and email exchange, 6 February 2014.\n\n[2]The original Hotel Waldorf was built along 34th Street, and its construction heralded the transition of New York’s Murray Hill neighborhood from an affluent residential area, home to the Astors and the Morgans, to a commercial one. Objecting to the noise and construction, Caroline Backhouse Astor (“The” Mrs. Astor) sold her adjacent house on Fifth Avenue to her hotelier nephew, Waldorf Astor. The Astor mansion, with its ballroom where New York’s “Four Hundred” had danced was demolished, and on the site was built the “Astoria” hotel, later combined with the Waldorf to become the Waldorf-Astoria.\n\n[3]Mr. Brasol was later to become the first American President of the Pushkin Society, as well as the Russian Imperial Union-Order, a legitimist-monarchist organization founded in 1928 which still exists in the US and in Russia in full support of the restoration of a legitimist monarchy in Russia in the person of Grand Duchess Maria Vladimirovna.\n\n[4]“Grand Duchess Discovers Crossword Puzzle”, New York Times, 9 December 1924\n\n[5]“I was shown one of these puzzles, and have been working at them ever since,” the Grand Duchess told a reporter. “You know, one has to be shown their way about a bit in these puzzles.” The Grand Duchess ordered several copies to take home with her.

While Wrangel’s own memoirs note that Grand Duke Nicholas’ popularity with soldiers increased as the First World War went on, and that his liberal democratic views became increasingly popular, nowhere that the author can find does any source suggest that General Baron Wrangel ever officially placed his support behind Grand Duke Nicholas as a candidate for a restoration. While Baron Wrangel certainly did not wholeheartedly support Grand Duke Kirill, (See GD Kirill, “My Life in Russia’s Service…” p. 221-222) Wrangel and Grand Duke Nicholas did work together heading the “All-Russian Military Union” as former soldiers of the Empire, but there is no suggestion that Wrangel ever saw Nicholas Nicholaevich as Sovereign or a legitimate pretender to the throne. There are no sources that this author can find that support the existence of a “Monarchist and Nationalist Union” or even a source that can corroborate the numbers of the membership of the “Union of Russian Officers Abroad.” This article may be no more than a reprint of a pro-Nicholas pamphlet circulating in France at this time. In fact, Grand Duke Kirill admired Baron Wrangel greatly, and on the Baron’s death in 1928, he wrote to Wrangel’s daughter in sympathy. (Graf, p. 155) “His Majesty had always had the greatest respect for Wrangel, recognizing his merits in fighting the Bolsheviks. He sent a cable of condolence to his widow expressing his sincerest sympathy.”\n\n[16]The full text of Grand Duke Kirill’s response began: “It was with a feeling of the most profound sadness of heart that I read the letter of 21 September/4 October of this year of Her Imperial Majesty, the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, to Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, which the latter then made public, and in which Her Majesty states that she finds Our adoption of the title of Emperor of All the Russias that was proclaimed in My Manifesto of 31 August, to be premature. Still more deplorable are the remarks added to this letter in the name of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, who permitted Himself in these remarks even to condemn My decision….” Grand Duke Kirill, “Announcement of Emperor Kirill I concerning the Published Letters of the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna and of Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, Commenting on the Adoption by Kirill of the Title of Emperor” Russian Imperial House, accessed 22 June 2014 http://www.imperialhouse.ru/eng/dynastyhistory/dinzak3/1111.html)\n\n[18]Graf, p. 184-185\n\n[19]It is also interesting to note that the extant diaries of the Dowager Empress were published in a Russian translation from the original Danish in their entirety in 2005. The Empress’ diaries for 1921 and 1922 do not exist, and they end on 29 August of 1923. Grand Duke Kirill’s announcement that he would assume the role of “curator” of the throne was 8 August of 1924, and his announcement of his accession was 31 August 1924. There is, thus, no record of the Dowager Empress’ actual opinions on his succession other than the letter denounced by Grand Duchess Xenia as not written by her, but by supporters of Nicholas Nicholaevich.\n\n[20]“Mother of the Czar Denounces Cyril,”, New York Times,13 December 1924\n\n[21] “Three Wedding Ceremonies for Miss Whittier of New-York”New York Times, 9 October 1894.\n\n[22]“Russia Ruled by A Woman—Princess Orloff is Muscovy’s real Autocrat” The Rideau Record, 4 September 1913. Acc, 22 June 2014 http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=92&dat=19130904&id=nWgBAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sSkDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4856,2616446The tabloid headline of this piece is terrible, but it contains useful information about Princess Orlova’s connections and influence at court. Princess Olga Konstantinovna Orlova, née Princess Belosselskaya-Belozerskaya, was among the most important figures in St. Petersburg society. Her father’s family was central during the reign of Alexander III, and her husband was in Nicholas II’s inner circle. As a result, Princess Orlova was a bridge between the two generations often at odds with one another. Pious, charitable, and a great supporter of the arts, Princess Orlova left St. Petersburg for the Crimea during the revolution, where her son, Nicholas Orlov married Grand Duke Nicholas’ niece, HH Princess Nadezhda Petrovna. She left Russia in 1919 on the HMS Marlborough with the Dowager Empress, and died in 1923 [cf. Welch, Frances, The Russian Court at Sea, (London: Short Books, Ltd., 2011)].\n\n[23]The author does not wish to imply that either Princess Orlova or her brother Prince Belosselsky-Belozersky were knowing accomplices in a plot to undermine the Grand Duchess Kirill during her visit to the United States—this is only to point out that if, as the author believes, they were instructed by pro-Nicholas courtiers to make the documents public on the Dowager Empress’ behalf, they would have done so without question or hesitation out of their longstanding loyalty to the Dowager Empress and their newly close marital relations to the Russian Imperial Family through HH Princess Nadezhda Petrovna’s marriage to Prince Orlov. They were well-placed to do so.\n\n[24]“Grand Duchess Gets No Official Honors”, New York Times,12 December, 1924.\n\n[25]“Visitor Greeted at Fête,” The Washington Post, 12 December 1924.\n\n[26]Special Russian Orthodox commemorative prayer service.\n\n[27]“Duchess is Silent on Attack on Kirill”, New York Times, 14 December 1924\n\n[28]Letopis' Istoriko-rodoslovnago obshchestva v Moskve.Moscow, 1905-1915 and 1993 sq., cit. 1992 2(46), pp. 80-81.\n\n[29]“Duchess is Silent on Attack on Kirill”, New York Times, 14 December 1924\n\n[30]“Cyril Sought Aid of Czar’s Mother”, New York Times, 15 December 1924\n\n[31]“Andrea Chénier”, New York Sun, 15 December1924\n\n[32]“Grand Duchess Off, Pleased With Visit”, New York Times, 17 December, 1924\n\n[33]Ibid.\n\n[34]“Opera Club Denies Diversion of Funds to Entertain Grand Duchess”, New York Times, 18 December 1924.
