Oksana Girko\n\nIn pre-revolutionary Russia, it was a custom for newborns to be presented with a “measured” icon; that is, an icon of their patron saint, painted on a panel the exact same length as the newborn. This practice was revived in Russia for Prince Alexander with two measured icons presented this one was a gift from friends and supporters of the Imperial Family in St. Petersburg. The other was a gift from the Knights and Dames of the Russian Imperial and Royal Orders.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n1.\n\nThe feast of St. Alexander Nevsky Great Prince of Novgorod, in Schema Alexis (1263) takes place on 23 November on the Julian calendar and 6 December on the Gregorian.
