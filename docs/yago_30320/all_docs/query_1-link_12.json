        "text": "Alexis (born August 12 [August 25, New Style], 1904, Peterhof, near St. Petersburg, Russia—died July 17, 1918, Yekaterinburg) was the only son of Nicholas II, the last tsar of Russia, and the tsarina Alexandra. He was the first male heir born to a reigning tsar since the 17th century.\n\nAlexis was a hemophiliac, and at that time there was no medical treatment that could alleviate his condition or lessen his vulnerability to uncontrolled bleeding. The mystic healer Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin was summoned to the palace to help the little tsarevich during one of his bleeding episodes, and he achieved marked success in relieving Alexis’s suffering. Whether through the hypnotic power of suggestion or the use of drugs or both, Rasputin proved indispensable in helping the boy survive several serious crises. Rasputin’s subsequent acquisition of enormous influence at the imperial court was due primarily to the relief and gratitude of the royal couple.\n\nIn March 1917 the tsar received from the Duma a demand for his abdication. At first he favoured giving up the crown to Alexis, with his brother Grand Duke Michael as regent, but he changed his mind, feeling that the boy was too fragile. His abdication was made then in favour of the Grand Duke Michael, who, however, refused to accept the crown unless it was tendered to him by the will of the people. The last chance for a regime of constitutional monarchy was thus cut short."
