        "text": "Early years\n\nOn 11 September 1822, one of the most beautiful princesses of her time was born in Russia: Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna (1822 – 1892), the second daughter of Tsar Nicholas I and Charlotte of Prussia. Her maternal grandmother was the bold and patriotic Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nOlga had two older brothers, the future Emperor Alexander II of Russia and Grand Duchess Maria, and four younger siblings, Grand Duchess Alexandra, Grand Duke Constantine, Nicholas and Michael.\n\nIn 1825, when Olga was three years old, her father ascended the throne as Nicholas I. The Emperor and Empress took great care of their children and Olga grew up in a loving and close-knit family. Nicholas and Alexandra (Charlotte had taken the name Alexandra Fёdorovna after their marriage) managed to create a real ‘happy island’, in the words of the Grand Duchess: ‘Along with a very strict upbringing, on the other hand, we were given a lot of freedom. My father demanded strict obedience, but allowed us pleasure inherent in our childhood, which he himself loved to decorate what some unexpected surprises.’\n\nHer education consisted of studying languages (German, French and English), history and geography. She learned to play the harpsichord and organ. However, her passions were painting and sculpture.\n\nIn 1838, the imperial family travelled to Prussia to visit the Empress’s father, King Friedrich Wilhelm III. In her memoirs, Olga recalls how she and her sisters enjoyed their stay with their Prussian relatives, where there was always joking and laughter. The old king loved being surrounded by his Russian granddaughters. Olga reports that during dinners he always wanted Maria, Olga and Alexandra to sit opposite him and that ‘liked to look at [them] all and enjoy [their] beauty‘. Olga also recalls that of the three, she was the one who least resembled her mother and that Alexandra was her grandfather’s favourite because, according to the King, ‘was the only one among us who look ‘Prussian’ with her snub nose and a sly face.’\n\nLooking for a husband\n\nIt was in Prussia that Olga met Crown Prince Maximilian of Bavaria. The Bavarian royal family wanted Max to marry one of the Russian princesses and thought of Maria. The crown prince, however, told Olga that he saw a resemblance between her and a portrait in one of the Bavarian palaces and therefore he wanted to marry her alone. When her mother told her of Max’s intention, Olga refused to even think about marriage.\n\nOlga was attractive, cultured, intelligent and was considered one of the most desirable princesses in Europe. It is said that Olga had a strong personality and was very similar to her father ‘with regular features, a strong will and a persistent nature‘. On the other hand, she had also inherited her mother’s ‘femininity and angelic tenderness‘. She was described as the ideal female beauty: ‘tall, slender, blond, with a cameo profile and big blue eyes‘.\n\nAfter the marriage of her sister Maria, who had married a prince lower in rank than hers, her parents were determined to find Olga a royal husband. In 1838, there was Max of Bavaria, but neither Olga nor her family liked him. A year later, their thoughts turned to Archduke Stephan of Austria. He was the son of Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary, born from his second marriage. Olga liked Stephan but a possible marriage between the two was prevented by Stephan’s stepmother. Furthermore, Austria did not want a princess of the Orthodox faith, as this could lead to social unrest among the minorities. In 1840, Olga decided there was no need to rush the marriage. She was happy to stay at home. Her father told her she was free to choose whoever she wanted.\n\nWhen Prince Frederick William of Hesse-Kassel visited Russia in 1843, Nicholas and Alexandra hoped he would consider marrying 21-year-old Olga. He was introduced to her when he arrived at Peterhof. Olga seemed to appreciate Frederick and enjoyed his company and conversation. However, the next day, Frederick met 18-year-old Alexandra and, to everyone’s surprise, fell in love with the younger princess. Realising that the couple was very much in love with each other, Olga kindly stepped aside in favour of her sister. Frederick William and Alexandra were married in January 1844 but the couple’s happy married life was tragically cut short when Alexandra died six months later of consumption and premature birth.\n\nLater that year, Adolf, Duke of Nassau, visited Russia with his younger brother Maurice. The Emperor and Empress saw this visit as a great opportunity for a marriage between Adolf and Olga. However, their hopes were dashed once again when Adolf fell in love and decided to marry Olga’s cousin, Grand Duchess Elisabeth Michajlovna. The emperor was surprised but Olga wrote that she “had nothing against it“.\n\nTrip to Italy\n\nThe death of Olga’s younger sister Alexandra in the summer of 1844 was a devastating blow to the whole family. Olga’s grief over the death of her beloved sister prompted her to write her memoirs and reported how it felt without Alexandra, the family’s favourite. She described her as ‘a lark that emanates with joy’.\n\nThe empress was particularly affected by Alexandra’s death. Not being of robust constitution, her grief greatly worsened her health. The doctors advised her to spend some time abroad and to benefit from the warm climate of the South. Olga accompanied her mother and wrote sadly that the journey was like a death sentence. ‘Away from the family, from home, without Papa and my brothers, wandering around Europe, not knowing when we can return‘.\n\nOlga, her mother and some co-workers wandered around Europe, going from one care centre to another. By the time they reached their final destination, Palermo, Italy, the empress’s health had certainly improved and Olga happily writes that her mother is quite well, is more cheerful and is strong enough to carry out daily activities.\n\nEngagement to Charles of Württemberg\n\nDuring this stay in Italy, Olga received two letters that would decide her fate. The first contained a request from the King of Württemberg to present his son to Olga, as the prince wanted to meet her. The second letter came from Count Metternich saying that the Austrian imperial family was interested in a rapprochement regarding the failed marriage between Archduke Stephan and Olga.\n\nOlga felt confused and, in her own words, had doubts for the first time. She did not want to be tied to a husband who depended entirely on Metternich. She decided to travel to Stuttgart to meet the crown prince of Württemberg and only then would she decide which of the two candidates was more suitable for her.\n\nOlga finally made her decision, she would marry Crown Prince Charles of Württemberg. The reason for her choice was a family one. Of all the ruling families in Germany, the family of Württemberg was the most closely related to the Romanovs. Olga’s grandmother, the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna, had been born a princess of Württemberg, just as her aunt, the Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna, had been married to the King of Württemberg.\n\nCrown Prince Charles of Württemberg arrived in Palermo on 1 January 1846. At their first meeting, Olga felt nervous but not shy. She remembers that she immediately fell in love with his soft voice, admired his figure, his brown eyes and the way his hair framed his forehead and temples. “He was rather shy and spoke little”. After several meetings, Olga accepted Charles’s marriage proposal. She was overjoyed by this event, as was her whole family and Russia.\n\nAfter the announcement of their engagement, Olga spent most of her free time with Charles: “I looked at his eyes and listened to him in intently, but the upcoming big change in my life also interested me, so I kept clear memories and impressions. It seemed to me that it is more important and significant to know the character and nature of Charles. His childhood was not happy: his parents never had a harmonious time together. He grew up lonely, and his need for affection was great. He loved to talk to me while walking in the garden, on bank of the Arno…When he found out that my birthday is on 11 September, he exclaimed: ‘Oh, it lies exactly between the birthdays of my parents! This may mean that you are destined to become the connecting link between the two.’ He guessed my nature and I have thus the direction of my path.”\n\nChildless marriage\n\nOlga and Charles were married in pomp at Peterhof Palace in Russia in July 1846. Olga was radiant. After the Orthodox wedding, a Lutheran one followed. The celebrations lasted several days and then the couple attended a ball in their honour. The people remarked: “She was incomparably beautiful. Her husband was not handsome, but his face radiates common sense and kindness.”\n\nIn September, Olga and Charles left Russia for Württemberg. People welcomed her enthusiastically. The couple settled at Villa Berg in Stuttgart.\n\nThe marriage initially looked congenial, but the couple had no children, probably due to the homosexuality of Charles, who often caused a scandal at court due to his constant proximity to other men.\n\nIn 1863, a year before he ascended the throne, the couple adopted the nine-year-old youngest daughter of Konstantin Nikolaevich, Olga’s brother. Grand Duchess Vera Konstantinovna was a very problematic child, prone to violent outbursts and her parents eventually failed to manage her. Despite the difficulties, Olga put a great deal of effort into caring for her niece and for Vera, her aunt assumed the role of mother to all intents and purposes.\n\nQueen of Württemberg\n\nOn 25 June 1864, after the death of his father, Charles ascended the throne and became the third king of Württemberg.\n\nOlga devoted her public and private life to social causes. She took a particular interest in the education of girls and also supported wounded veterans and the handicapped. Several charitable organisations and hospitals were opened in her name. She also took an interest in agriculture and natural sciences and was an amateur collector and mineralogist.\n\nThese charitable initiatives made her very popular among her subjects, much more so than her husband.\n\nQueen Olga was known for her dignity and regal behaviour. During a visit of the royal couple to Austria-Hungary in July 1873, a lady-in-waiting of Empress Elisabeth of Austria remarked: ‘He is most insignificant. She makes a most imposing appearance … the only one who is a queen…”\n\nIn 1881, Olga wrote a memoir entitled ‘The Golden Dream of My Youth‘ that described her childhood at the Russian imperial court, her grief at the loss of her sister Alexandra and her early adult life, which ended with her marriage to Charles."
