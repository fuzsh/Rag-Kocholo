She too was exceeding fair, dowered with the classic beauty of the Romanovs: her eyes were dark blue, shaded by long lashes, and she had masses of dark brown hair. Marie was plump, and the Empress often teased her about this; she was not so lively as her sisters, but she was much more decided in her outlook. The Grand Duchess Marie knew at once what she wanted, and why she wanted it.“ - Lili Dehn\n\nMarie Nikolaievna was like Olga Nikolaievna in colouring and features, but all on a more vivid scale. She had the same charming smile, the same shape of face, but her eyes, “Marie’s saucers,” as they were called by her cousins, were magnificent, and of a deep dark blue. Her hair had golden lights in it, and when it was cut after her illness in 1917, it curled naturally over her head.- Sophie Buxhoeveden\n\nanastasianikolaevna-blog:\n\nHappy 112th Birthday Anastasia\n\nthemauveroom:\n\nGrand Duchesses Maria and Anastasia with Pierre Gilliard on the lake at the Alexander Palace: 1915.\n\ntragicrussianbeauty:\n\n17 May, 1910, Peterhof\n\nMy dear Mama!

One was discovered in 1991 and the other in 2007. The bodies buried in the first pit were reburied in 1998, but the bodies buried in the second pit have not ben reburied. In the first pit were the bodies of Nicholas, Alexandra, Olga, Tatiana, and either Maria or Anastasia. In the second pit were the bodies of Alexei and either Anastasia or Maria. Either way, no one survived that night in the cellar.\n\nthemauveroom:\n\nGrand Duchess Maria in a car c. 1913."
