        "text": "Intro\n\nGrand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna (1860-1922) was one of the most fascinating and independent royal women of her generation. The only daughter of Grand Duke Michael Nikolaevich and his German-born wife, Duchess Cecilie of Baden, Anastasia was the granddaughter of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia.\n\nAnastasia grew up with her six brothers in Tbilisi and St. Petersburg. She was known as ‘Stassie’ within the family and was her father’s favourite. Anastasia inherited her mother’s looks, intelligence and strong, outspoken personality, characteristics that often made both women unpopular in the royal courts of the 19th century.\n\nIn 1879 she married Frederick Francis, Crown Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, by whom she had three children.\n\nAfter her husband’s death, she had an illegitimate child by his secretary and caused a scandal for her unconventional behaviour.\n\nKey points\n\nIn this article on Anastasia Mikhailovna of Russia, Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, we will analyse the following key points:\n\nHer dynastic marriage to Frederick Francis, hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, with whom she had several ancestors in common, and her husband’s poor health, which forced them to live mostly away from the Schwerin court, preferring Italy and France.\n\nThe strong-willed, vital and independent personality of the Grand Duchess, who had three children by her husband and loved sport, music and theatre.\n\nThe worsening illness of Grand Duke Frederick Francis III and the mysterious circumstances of his death, about which journalists spoke at length.\n\nThe well-combined marriages of Anastasia’s two daughters to the hereditary princes of Denmark and Germany.\n\nThe child of the scandal, born of Anastasia’s affair with her secretary. She managed to hide the pregnancy by passing it off as a cancer. Once the scandal became public, she was no longer allowed to see her daughter Cecilie, who had become Crown Princess of Germany.\n\nDuring the First World War, Anastasia could neither stay in France nor go to Germany because she was considered an enemy of all these nations, so she settled in neutral Switzerland.\n\nThe effects of the war were fatal for her family: her son and daughter Cecilie lost their (future) crowns while the Bolsheviks killed three of Anastasia’s brothers, Nikolai, Georgi and Sergei, during the Russian Revolution.\n\nMarriage to the hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nIn 1879, Anastasia married Frederick Francis, hereditary Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Newspapers of the time reported that the couple’s common cousin, Emperor Wilhelm I of Germany, had helped arrange the union.\n\n‘Anastasia, tall, slender and with dark hair, in a heavy silver brocade gown, was wonderfully beautiful when Emperor Alexander II led her at the head of the wedding procession, attended by representatives of all the ruling Houses of Europe, through the halls of the Winter Palace to the palace church…’.\n\n‘The train’s departure signal sounded,’ the bride’s younger brother, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, later recalled, ’and we lost sight of our Anastasia. My mother burst into tears, my father nervously fumbled with his gloves…. The ruthless law that forced members of the Russian Imperial Household to marry representatives of foreign ruling houses claimed its first victim in our family‘.\n\nIt was certainly a favourable marriage for dynastic reasons. However, young Anastasia was embarrassed by the groom’s poor health and the rashes he suffered from eczema on his face.\n\nHer husband was a third cousin of the Grand Duchess, their common ancestor being the Russian Emperor Paul I. Furthermore, Frederick Francis’s grandmother, Alexandrine of Prussia, and Anastasia’s grandmother, Charlotte of Prussia (who became Alexandra Feodorovna), were sisters, as they were daughters of Frederick William III of Prussia and Queen Louise, Princess of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nWhen the newlyweds arrived in Schwerin, Anastasia was not allowed to settle in according to her tastes. She found the court in Schwerin too austere and old-fashioned. Frederick Francis’s poor health was the perfect excuse to spend as much time as possible in southern Italy and France, where the climate suited her husband.\n\nAnastasia Grand Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin\n\nIn December, their first daughter, Alexandrine, was born. Their second child, another Frederick Francis, was born in Italy, Palermo. The third and last child, Cecilie, was born in 1886.\n\nThe death of Anastasia’s father-in-law in 1883 forced the couple to return to Schwerin, where Frederick Francis became the reigning Grand Duke. At first, Anastasia appreciated her new position and settled in the luxury of Schwerin Castle. However, she soon wished to return to Italy or France. Anastasia travelled to Cannes, where her husband built a large Italian-style palace for her. Between 1887 and 1895 they lived in Cannes from November to May.\n\nAnastasia raised her children with a sense of freedom and maintained close relationships with them throughout her life. She was good at tennis, loved the theatre and Italian music. Anastasia also had a lifelong passion for gambling and was a frequent visitor to the casino in Monte Carlo.\n\nAnastasia’s letters that have come down to us reveal a warm and affectionate person who loved life. Despite her extravagances, she never lost the affection of her husband, whose homosexuality was generally acknowledged.\n\nTragedy in the family\n\nIn 1897, a tragedy struck the family. After years of medical problems, Grand Duke Frederick Francis III’s health deteriorated at Villa Wenden. He died there in April 1897, but the exact circumstances of his death are shrouded in mystery. Newspapers published contradictory accounts of the Grand Duke’s last moments. All agreed that he died as a result of a fall somewhere in the park of the villa or nearby. Some wrote that the fall was a deliberate act, an attempt to end the immense physical suffering he was enduring. Others stated that the fall was accidental. The most plausible hypothesis is that it was indeed suicide.\n\nIn 1898, a book on Grand Duke Frederick III was published in Schwerin. Its author, Professor Karl Schroeder, knew the Grand Duke personally and dedicated his work to the widow, the Russian Grand Duchess. Before the book was published, he sent the following letter to Anastasia Mikhailovna: ‘Your Highness did me the favour of agreeing to the dedication of my book to you. Who could have had greater right to do so than you, the blessed lord’s life companion, the faithful nurse during the many years of his illness!’.\n\nIn reply, the Grand Duke’s widow wrote: ‘Dear Professor Schroeder! I have gratefully accepted the dedication of your book about my husband. It is very dear to me that through this dedication my name is linked to the man from whom I have received all the happy and good things I have had in life.’\n\nLife goes on\n\nAfter her husband’s death, Anastasia rarely visited Schwerin; she preferred to live on the French Riviera or stay in St. Petersburg, Paris or London.\n\nHer daughters married well, Alexandrine to the future king of Denmark and Cecilie to the man who was to become the German emperor. Her son followed in his father’s footsteps as Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.\n\nHis nephew, Felix Yusupov, described Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna in his memoirs: ‘Although she was over forty, she had not lost her temper; she was kind and affectionate, but her eccentric and despotic nature made her rather formidable. She was very early and would phone me at eight o’clock in the morning. If I was away from home, she would send her servants to look for me all over Paris, and sometimes she would participate in the search herself. I had to have lunch, dinner, go to the theatre and dine with her almost every day. She would usually sleep through the first act of a play, and then wake up in a daze declaring that the play was stupid and that she wanted to go somewhere else. We often changed the theatre one or three times in an evening‘.\n\nThe scandal\n\nIn Paris, Anastasia met Vladimir Alexandrovich Paltov, who became her secretary. She got pregnant by him. At first she said her belly was caused by a cancer. In the last months of her pregnancy, Anastasia let it be known that she had caught chicken pox and had to remain isolated. In December 1902 she gave birth to a son, named Alexis Louis, and received the title Count of Venden from King Christian IX of Denmark.\n\nAfter the scandal became public, she was advised never to live near her daughter Cecilie, who was now Crown Princess of Germany. Emperor Wilhelm II only allowed her to visit the court in Berlin twice, in 1905 for the marriage of his youngest daughter to the Crown Prince and a second time in 1906 for the birth of their first child, Wilhelm. After that, she was no longer welcome.\n\nMeanwhile, Anastasia inherited an enormous fortune when her father died in 1909, becoming perhaps even more eccentric than before.\n\nFirst World War implications\n\nWith the outbreak of World War I, Anastasia, as a German Grand Duchess, could not stay in France, as the country was at war with Germany, nor could she return to Schwerin, which had become an enemy of her native Russia. She therefore decided to settle in neutral Switzerland.\n\nThe war cost his son and daughter their (future) crowns. The Bolsheviks killed her brothers Nikolai, Georgi and Sergei during the Russian Revolution.\n\nLater years and death\n\nAfter the war, she lived at Villa Fantasia in Èze, near Cannes, where she died suddenly of a heart attack on 11 March 1922. She is buried in Ludwigslust next to her husband.\n\nMatilda Kschesinskaya describes her death as follows: ‘Three weeks later we suffered a great loss in the person of Grand Duchess Anastasia Mikhailovna, who died suddenly in her Villa Fantasia in Eze on 26 February (11 March) 1922. No one could have expected her to be gone so soon. Two days before her passing we saw her cheerful and lively. Her old and devoted maid Olga called us, asking us to come immediately, because the Grand Duchess was dangerously ill. When we arrived, the Grand Duchess lay unconscious, but with her eyes open. We do not know whether she recognised us; she did not show it in any way. Her private secretary held a mirror to her lips to see if she was breathing. Suddenly she took a deep breath and the end came. We all knelt around her bed and prayed. We closed her eyes. It was the first time Vova had witnessed the death and he did not want to believe that his dear friend, with whom he had spent a cheerful evening two days before, could have died so suddenly. It was a great sorrow for him, because from early childhood she had shown him much attention. During these two years she had filled our lives with her cheerfulness and affection. Two hours later young Leeds arrived like a madman from Cannes with his wife, Ksenia Georgievna, and our old priest, Father Ostroumov, who was barely alive from the mad rush. The next day, Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich, brother of the deceased, arrived from Paris. The Grand Duchess’ eldest daughter, Queen Alexandrine of Denmark, arrived shortly afterwards. She and I spent a few days at Villa Fantasia and I helped her sort out all the little things left behind by the deceased and put aside what she wanted to take with her. (…) The coffin with the Grand Duchess’ remains was transported to Cannes, to our church, and then sent to Mecklenburg for burial in the family crypt.’"
