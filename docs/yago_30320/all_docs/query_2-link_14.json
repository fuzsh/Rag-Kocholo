        "text": "Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia (Olga Nikolaevna Romanova) (Russian: Великая Княжна Ольга Николаевна/Velikaya Knyazhna Ol'ga Nikolaevna); 15 November [O.S. 3 November] 1895 – Summer 1944) was the eldest sister of Emperor Alexei II of Russia and the wife of the ethnic Polish Belarusian nationalist Stanisław Bułak-Bałachowicz.\n\nOlga was born in the autumn of 1895, as the eldest daughter of Emperor Nicholas II. During her youth, Olga's future marriage was the subject of great speculation within Russia. Matches were rumored with Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia, Crown Prince Carol of Romania, Edward, Prince of Wales, eldest son of Britain's George V, and with Crown Prince Alexander of Serbia. Olga herself wanted to marry a Russian and remain in her home country. She eventually got her wish (somewhat) when she married Bułak-Bałachowicz in 1924. The couple had two daughters (Natalia and Alexandra) and they resided in Minsk.\n\nOlga served as what she called \"the peacemaker\" between her husband, a Belarusian nationalist, and her brother and the Prime Minister in Saint Petersburg. During the Great Caucasian War, Olga nursed wounded soldiers in a military hospital until her own nerves gave out and, thereafter, oversaw administrative duties at the hospital.\n\nIn 1941, the German Army invaded Russia, Bułak-Bałachowicz remained in Minsk leading the city's final defence against the Wehrmacht. Sometime during the Siege of Minsk (as part of the Białystok–Minsk Campaign), Bułak-Bałachowicz was killed in action. After all of Belarus was captured by the Germans, Olga and her daughters were captured. They were treated far better than ordinary prisoners-of-war, being under house arrest. The Germans later offered to exchange them for Friedrich Paulus, the German Field Marshal captured by the Russians after the Battle of Tsaritsyn. On the advice of his generals, the Emperor declined. Olga and the daughters were later sent to Auschwitz Concentration Camp, where Olga and Alexandra were murdered in the gas chambers. Natalia survived the selection and she was sent to forced labour, and later transferred to Bergen-Belsen Concentration Camp.\n\nFollowing the war, upon hearing of the fate of his sister, the Emperor sentenced Joseph Goebbels to death and staged a posthumous mock execution of Adolf Hitler. Today in Minsk, there exists a memorial to Olga, Stanisław and Alexandra."
