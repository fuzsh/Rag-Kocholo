        "text": "The Landgravine Eleonora Catherine of Hessen-Escwege, born a Countess Palatine of Pfalz-Zweibrücken and considered a Princess of Sweden after her brother Karl X ascended that throne, had an illegitimate daughter in 1647 only a few months after her marriage to the Landgrave Friedrich. She had confessed to her husband early on in their marriage that she was pregnant with the French lute player Beschon. Her husband asked her to keep quiet. The daughter named Margareta didn't even live a year.\n\nIn a strange twist of fate the couple's daughter Landgravine Juliana, who had been sent to Sweden to be raised and eventually marry her cousin Karl XI, got pregnant with the already married Count Lillie but managed to hide it until she got into labour while riding in a carriage with the Queen Dowager Hedvig Eleonora. Juliana was banished to a country estate and the boy was put in foster care.\n\nThings didn't end there - in 1679 Juliana was found pregnant with the Dutch commoner Johann Jakob Marchand. After the birth of their son they were allowed to marry and Johann was given the title Baron von Lillienburg. The family left for Haarlem and was according to some sources given an estate near IJsselstein by Prince Wilhelm III of Orange.\n\nMore names:\n\nRoyal women who gave birth while unmarried\n\n#1 Blanche of Portugal (1259-1321)\n\nhttps://www.historyofroyalwomen.com/blanche-of-portugal/blanche-portugal-illegitimate-son/\n\n#2 Germaine de Foix (c1488-1538), niece of King Louis XII of France and widow of King Ferdinand II of Aragon\n\nhttps://www.historyofroyalwomen.com...oixs-illegitimate-daughter-isabel-of-castile/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Germaine_of_Foix\n\n#3 [allegedly] Sophia Albertina of Sweden (1753-1829)\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sophia_Albertina,_Abbess_of_Quedlinburg\n\nMarried royal women with children not fathered by their husbands\n\n#1 Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel (1764-1788), wife of King Frederick I of Wurttemberg\n\nhttps://www.historyofroyalwomen.com...therine-great-augusta-brunswick-wolfenbuttel/\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duchess_Augusta_of_Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel\n\n#2 Maria Pia of Savoy (1934- ), daughter of King Umberto II of Italy, married (1) Prince Alexander of Yugoslavia and (2) Prince Michael of Bourbon-Parma\n\nIn 1963, while married to Prince Alexander, she gave birth to twins (Serge and Helene), fathered by Prince Michael, who was also married.

Most certainly, the youngest son Peter who died as an infant was not fathered by the prince -- and perhaps Kira\" and \"the youngest son of Grand Duchess Maria Kirillovna was most likely not fathered by her husband -most likely the gardener or the chauffeur.”\n\nI am currently reading Evelyn Farr's Marie Antoinette and Count Axel Fersen: The Untold Love Story.\n\nThe author's rather shocking assertion is that the queen's two younger children Louis-Charles, Duc de Normandie and Princess Sophie(who died in infancy) were fathered by Fersen and not Louis XVI.\n\nThis is the first time I've heard this.\n\nThere is a saying in French which goes : A beau mentir qui vient de loin It means when you are far away (distance and time) you can lie as much as you want.\n\nI think it is easy to say anything when you are so far in time.\n\nSome key biographers have put forth the possibility that Princess Louise of the United Kingdom (fourth daughter and sixth child overall of Queen Victoria), before she became the Duchess of Argyll, may have had an illegitimate child by her brother's tutor. The evidence is scant, but that does not necessarily mean it didn't happen—we know from what occurred in the case of Princess Thyra of Denmark's illegitimate child exactly how a princess being impregnated out of wedlock in the Victorian era would have panned out: She would have been sent somewhere far away to give birth to the child, who would have immediately been adopted out to a common family while the Royal Household worked overtime to erase all evidence that the pregnancy had ever occurred; and that's assuming the pregnancy didn't end in a miscarriage or the Royal Household didn't, in panic mode, procure an abortion to avoid scandal.\n\nIt does seem very likely that the future Catherine the Great's daughter, who died young, was fathered by the future King of Poland. She definitely had an illegitimate son, Alexis Bobrinsky, by Grigori Orlov. And it's quite possible that her son Paul was fathered by her lover Sergei Saltykov, but it's probably best not to go there because it'd mean none of the Romanovs since were actually real Romanovs! One of George III's daughters, Princess Sophia, is also supposed to have had an illegitimate child, and that seems a lot more likely than the Princess Louise story.\n\nAnd it's quite possible that her son Paul was fathered by her lover Sergei Saltykov, but it's probably best not to go there because it'd mean none of the Romanovs since were actually real Romanovs!\n\nThere's an old story I've read about how that when Empress Alexandra of Russia tried to pressure the staff at Almanach da Gotha into listing the Imperial house as Romanov instead of Holstein-Gottorp-Romanov the reply was that if she wasn't happy with the name they could always name it Holstein-Gottorp-Saltykov.\n\nIt's probably a fake story, but it shows that many were aware of the possibility of Sergei Saltykov being the father of Emperor Paul.\n\nSome key biographers have put forth the possibility that Princess Louise of the United Kingdom (fourth daughter and sixth child overall of Queen Victoria), before she became the Duchess of Argyll, may have had an illegitimate child by her brother's tutor. The evidence is scant, but that does not necessarily mean it didn't happen—we know from what occurred in the case of Princess Thyra of Denmark's illegitimate child exactly how a princess being impregnated out of wedlock in the Victorian era would have panned out: She would have been sent somewhere far away to give birth to the child, who would have immediately been adopted out to a common family while the Royal Household worked overtime to erase all evidence that the pregnancy had ever occurred; and that's assuming the pregnancy didn't end in a miscarriage or the Royal Household didn't, in panic mode, procure an abortion to avoid scandal.\n\nThe story stems from the supposed kid himself. The queen's gynaecologist Charles locock had a son Frederick. Fred and his wife Mary had a child Henry who may have been adopted. What is known Louise did show some interest in the child after Mary died. Henry bragged as he grew up she visited as he was her son. And the rumor passed down the family.\n\nLouise was a feminist and a bit wild in her time. There was plenty of rumors due to it, of her having lovers.\n\nToday we have the case of \"Xenia Prinzessin und Herzogin von Sachsen\" who is named thus because her mother, Iris Prinzessin und Herzogin von Sachsen did not name a father (though I recently read anyone who wanted to know knew who the girl's father is) - so in former times she would have been considered \"non existent\" but today she has a right to her mother's name and thus is regarded by \"normal\" people as a real princess.\n\nNot only is Xenia illegitimate, but so too is her sister, Xandra. Additionally, Xenia has an illegitimate child of her own.\n\nI can't see how she would be a Princess since Royal titles descend to legitimate children....\n\nSome countries do allow the descent of royal titles to illegitimate children. Currently, the titles officially recognized in the German republic may descend to all acknowledged children without reference to their parents' marital status.\n\nIn the Japanese monarchy pre-1947, not only royal titles but succession rights descended to sons born from concubines, who would be considered illegitimate by Western laws.\n\nBecause of the German law making royal and noble titles part of the surname it's completely legal for Xenia, who doesn't carry her father's name, to adopt the surname of her mother Iris, Prinzessin von Sachsen. This in turn makes it possible for people to be confused and think she is a \"real\" princess, something that she gladly and actively encourages them to do.\n\nDoes she actively encourage people to think that her father was married to her mother? As far as the title/surname she carries is concerned, it is equally real as those carried by legitimate children.\n\nA good example would be the later children of Grand Duchess Wilhelmine of Hesse, wife of Louis II of Hesse. The marriage was unhappy; there was a wide age difference between the two and Louis had his own extramarital affairs. After Wilhelmine provided an heir and a spare (the future Louis III and Prince Karl, respectively) she moved into Heiligenberg Castle. After embarking on an affair with Baron August von Senarclens de Grancy in 1820, she gave birth to an additional four children. Louis acknowledged them as his own, but it was well-known that the Grand Duke and Grand Duchess were not even living together.\n\nOnly the two youngest, Alexander and Marie, survived to adulthood and made a rather spectacular mark on history. Marie became Empress of Russia as the wife of Tsar Alexander II. Reportedly when courtiers tried to whisper to Alexander about the rumors of Marie's parentage, he responded with the allegations that his own ancestor Paul I wasn't the actual son of Peter III. Meanwhile, Alexander morgantically married Countess Julia von Hauke, Princess of Battenberg. Among his descendants are King Felipe of Spain and Prince Philip.\n\nThere is also a welll-known speculation that the children of Queen Isabella II of Spain were all illegitimate even though officially they were born of her marriage with Francisco, Duke of Cádiz.\n\nThere is also a welll-known speculation that the children of Queen Isabella II of Spain were all illegitimate even though officially they were born of her marriage with Francisco, Duke of Cádiz.\n\nIndeed. According to this book entitled \"Isabel II: Los Espejos de la Reina (2004), Isabella II's son and successor Alfonso XII of Spain, had been fathered by Enrique Puigmoltó y Mayans- a captain of the guard.\n\nThis is still shrouded in mystery since the people who peddled these at that time were the Carlists. But yes, it still should be noted that Francisco, Duke of Cádiz was said to be gay.\n\nAs a side question, why is it that royal watchers outside of Spain usually refer to Francisco de Asís by his ducal title rather than his title of Infante or King?\n\nI believe it is customary to refer to deceased queen consorts by their maiden names or titles. Sometimes that is done even for living consorts. For example, I think non-English versions of the Wikipedia use “Máxima Zorreguieta” or “Mathilde d’Udekem d’Aoiz” to name their articles on Queen Máxima and Queen Mathilde.\n\nI suppose that , by extension, the same applies to Francisco de Asis, who was indeed an Infante by birth and later king consort. Sometimes he is referrred to as Infante Francisco, Duke of Cádiz, but it is indeed rare to call him King Francisco.\n\nI believe it is customary to refer to deceased queen consorts by their maiden names or titles.

Sometimes he is referrred to as Infante Francisco, Duke of Cádiz, but it is indeed rare to call him King Francisco.\n\nThat's true, and provided that is the reason, then I suppose my question is why English royal watchers usually refer to him by the ducal title he carried at birth (as the constitution in place at the time limited royal status to the children of the King and the children of the Prince of Asturias) and not the higher title of Infante which he received as a child and carried at the time of his marriage.\n\nYeah, Xenia and Xandra are most definitely not princesses. While it could be argued that Article 6 of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany automatically legitimizes all bastards, the fact remains that there is no tradition of legitimation entitling a legitimized bastard to the use of the title of prince(ss), even if there were there is no tradition in the very Salic House of Wettin of uterine inheritance of titles, and, even if that weren't an issue, the Federal Republic of Germany does not recognize any royal or noble titles.\n\nAnd the House of Wettin is also quite clear that Xenia is not a member of the House of Wettin.\n\nThat said, the fact remains that both Xenia and Xandra are illegitimate children of a titular princess.\n\nYeah, Xenia and Xandra are most definitely not princesses.

I suppose you refer to the fact that titles are not recognized in the form of titles, but in that case, the same applies to the \"legitimate\" members of the House of Wettin.\n\nThe House of Wettin is a private family with no official role in legislation following the fall of Germany's monarchies, and the descent of titles which have been made parts of surnames is no longer regulated by the traditions of the House of Wettin but by the laws of the federal republic.\n\nI'm sorry, I always value your opinion, but in this case you are, and have been before, wrong. While it's true that Xenia legally carries the surname Prinzessin von Sachsen this does not make her a Princess of Sachsen. The two are completely separate. Membership of the Royal House of Saxony depends on the customs and House laws of said Royal House.\n\nYou can be both a member of the Royal family and carry the surname of Prinz von Sachsen, but there are also several people who carry said surname without being members of the Royal family.\n\nThe House of Wettin is a private family with no official role in legislation following the fall of Germany's monarchies, and the descent of titles which have been made parts of surnames is no longer regulated by the traditions of the House of Wettin but by the laws of the federal republic.\n\nI'm sorry, I always value your opinion, but in this case you are, and have been before, wrong.

However, as the concept that the House of Wettin continues to have an official part in legislating for the federal republic of Germany (as that is the part of my post which you quoted and refer to as wrong) is contrary to my previous understanding, I would appreciate a reference in addition to the bare statement that I am wrong.\n\nETA: As a reference for my own statement, here is a European Union court ruling noting that titles of nobility, as such, are abolished in Germany and their descent, as names, is regulated by \"the German Law on personal status\"."
