        "text": "I was wondering what would happen if the main branch of the Romanovs died out in 1899. I don't know of any specific event that might work as a POD, but I simply want it to happen before Nicholas had the opportunity to completely ruin things.\n\nI think this would leave the throne of Vladimir Romanov, Alexander II's next son in line, and leave him with about 10 years on the throne to try and salvage things in. From what I understand Vladimir was rather more cultured, better educated, and less of a religious fanatic than Nicholas. He had held various high posts in government and in the military. He was also at odds with the more conservative branches of the Romanovs. This is before Bloody Sunday in 1905 where his reputation was tarnished, so he should be in pretty good standing with the general populace.\n\nI have probably missed a ton of details, but what and how do people think a Vladimir IV Romanov (would it be IV or I?) would do things differently?\n\nI have been reading through Simon Sebag Montefiore's The Romanovs, and reached the chapter on Nicholas II.\n\nVladimir while hedonistic would have fit much better into the Petersburg society, where Nicholas and his wife cut themselves completely off from the rest of the world. Further he had several adult children who would all work as heirs. While not an ideal emperor I can't imagine he would be worse than Nicholas.\n\nAs I understand it Vladimir was relatively moderate compared to many of the other nutjobs that made up the more reactionary Romanovs and while he was conservative, he was happy to bring in people regardless of ideology so long as they interested him. The reactionary Romanovs were particularly the Nikolaieviches (descended from Nicholas I through his son Nicholas) and Nicholas' uncle Sergei while the Mikhailoviches (descended from another son of Nicholas') were largely the liberal branch of the family as far as I have been able to understand. Vladimir was basically used as scapegoat for a lot of the chaos surrounding Bloody Sunday despite not being in the city, leading to he and his family becoming implacable opponents of Nicholas and Alexandra.\n\nI think it is difficult to find anyone who could have done a worse job than Nicholas when you look at the way he was able to tear apart any and every group that had the least level of loyalty to him, his indecisiveness, religious fanaticism, unwillingness to delegate any responsibilities, reliance on spiritual mystics, complete lack of any governmental training, unwillingness to compromise and a dozen other character faults that made him an absolute failure as Tsar.\n\nThe way I understand it, many members of the Romanov dynasty - such as Michael, Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich, and even Nicholas II - came across as moderate when compared to Vladimir.\n\nIt's true that Vladimir was not particularly responsible for Bloody Sunday; but there are plenty of other venues where his politics and personality shone through. He did insist that those who were responsible for the Sunday chaos go unpunished and be allowed to keep their positions. He was outraged at the very idea of having a Constitution, even a very weak one. He staunchly opposed Nicholas II's gift of crown lands for the Stolypin land reform. He was a kneejerk Anglophobe and apparently a supporter of the Hamidian regime (if only because of that kneejerk Anglophobia). And so on.\n\nIt seems like 90% of Nicholas II's bad decisions were made on Vladimir's advice, under Vladimir's pressure, or at the very least with Vladimir's approval. While 90% of his good decisions were made against Vladimir's opposition. I could be wrong, but everything I've read about Vladimir basically paints him as a pompous ass, all ambition and no quality (such as Robert Massie's biography of Nicholas; and Montefiore's book isn't exactly overflowing with praise for him, either).\n\nNicholas, for all his many faults, was at least humble, occasionally open to compromise and reform, and had a strong sense of duty.\n\nI didn't know that, certainly interesting. I would disagree with the humble part regarding Nicholas, from the bits and pieces of his novels, his general actions and everything else he comes across as completely unwilling to allow others to ease the burden of rulership. While yes, he does view the task of ruling as a burden and works hard towards accomplishing it, he seems unwilling to work through subordinates or find any way of easing that burden, consider people outside his family for positions of trust, and seems to have a complete inability to work towards a goal without undermining himself constantly.\n\nSince Vladimir seems like a bad solution, who among the Romanov brood would be able to do a better job than Nicholas? To me at least, it seems as if one of Nicholas' most problematic points is simply that he is a weak man in many ways, unwilling and largely unable to lead, and consistently allows himself to be dominated by others.\n\nI didn't know that, certainly interesting.

Especially with say, Nicky's eldest daughter as a bride for him, if only to unite the lines of the Romanovs? And what happens to Nicky's daughters? OTL he had three by 1899, so they would still be a feature here. Plus, Alicky is still drifting around the Imperial court somewhere (and I could see her wanting to fight for her daughters to succeed with herself as regent)\n\nNicholas Alexandrovich, Tsesarevich of Russia\n\nBut that requires a different POD\n\nThe idea of Nicholas Alexandrovich surviving is incredibly interesting and I would love to see someone do a TL based on that premise. It would probably change a great deal, both internally in the Romanov family, and externally in that Nicholas would probably have taken a different approach than Alexander III. That being said, I chose this precise point in time because the Russian Empire is really nearing the precipice in many ways when it comes to reform and popular movements. You have large terrorist organization at the top of their game and a dissatisfied nobility which create some very interesting dynamics in the Russian Empire.\n\nWell, should Vlad not suit, might not his eldest son, Kiril Vladimirovich be considered?

OTL he had three by 1899, so they would still be a feature here. Plus, Alicky is still drifting around the Imperial court somewhere (and I could see her wanting to fight for her daughters to succeed with herself as regent)\n\nKiril was another option that might be interesting to explore. I don't see how Olga could work as a bride in this case, considering the 19 year age difference and the fact that she would be around 4 years old at this point in time. Kiril might be interesting to follow, considering the difficulties he had with his OTL wife. With him potentially as Tsar I doubt he would be able to follow through on a marriage to his first cousin, who would also need to be a divorcée, seems like a tall order in this case. How stubborn he is about marrying his OTL wife would probably impact things a lot.\n\nGenerally, as I read up on the Vladimiroviches, they really don't seem like all that good of an option. Which sort of brings it all back to whether there are any of the Romanovs who would work as Tsar at this point in time, and what it would take for them to get to that position. The Borki disaster being more deadly just leaves the Vladimiroviches as rulers in 1888 instead, not really solving the problem.\n\nSince it was only a year later OTL that Count Witte et al got into a fight about what should be done were Nikolai to die of typhoid leaving Alicky preggers with what they hoped was a tsarevich (spoiler: It wasn't). Would there be any branches that might support a female succession (particularly if they've got age-appropriate son(s) to marry the Big Pair)? Or that just don't like the Vladimirovichi so they support the press for Empress Olga Nikolaïevna. But even if thats the case, what happens with Alicky? The last Russian empress dowager not the next emperor's mom was Elizabeth Alexeïevna (if we remove Ekaterina Dolgurokova from the list). She'd probably prefer the privacy etc, but at the same time, Ican still see her having the desire to meddle (which Mieche-Miechen might not stand for).\n\nIn the end, I guess it depends mainly on Nicky and Misha's mode of death. If Nicky's ill and knows he's dying he might allow Misha to marry Baby Bee as Misha wanted OTL, or attempt to fiddle with the succession to allow Olga to succeed. Whereas if they're assassinated or a motorbike accident (like brother George and Misha's son), then I can see the court being thrown into a sort of chaos depending on whether Alicky's given birth to Marie or not (ergo the hoping for a tsarevich or the disappointment of knowing it's impossible).\n\nNicholas when ill with typhoid did in fact at Alexandra's urging discuss altering the succession to allow his eldest daughter to succeed in the absence of a male heir - it was pointed out that he would struggle to get it through. As most of his family would be opposed to it - whilst amending the family laws was technically possible there was a real reluctance to alter the essential elements of the Pauline Laws. Given there were numerous male Romanov's around he couldn't even say it was necessary.\n\nthe chance of marrying Olga to Kyril is remote - Marie Pavlovna (Miechen) loathed Alexandra after her attempts to help the young Empress were rebuffed. Kyril himself had been in love with his future wife for some time despite her being pushed to marry Alexandra's brother Ernie.\n\nIn terms of contenders its a long-haul to get anyone better by 1899 - numbers 5,6, 7, 21 are all involved in dubious relationships not sanctioned by Alexander III or Nicholas II. 9 was declared insane. I have only included children born before 1900. Of the below - the Mikhailovichi were more liberal in views than the rest but were the lowest down the succession list.\n\nThe motley crew usually means that people tend to opt for Nicholas II's death (after George's death) leaving the throne to Michael - because the rest are such an appalling choice.\n\n1) Vladmir Alexandrovich\n\n2) Kyril Vladimirovich\n\n3) Boris Vladimirovich\n\n4) Andrei Vladimirovich\n\n5) Alexei Alexandrovich\n\n6) Sergei Alexandrovich\n\n7) Paul Alexandrovich\n\n8) Dmitri Pavlovich\n\n9) Nicholas Konstantinovich\n\n10) Konstantin Konstantinovich\n\n11) Ion Konstantinovich\n\n12) Gavril Konstantinovich\n\n13) Konstantin Konstantinovich\n\n14) Oleg Konstantinovich\n\n15) Georgy Konstantinovich\n\n16) Dmitry_Konstantinovich\n\n17) Nikolai Nikolaevich\n\n18) Peter Nikolaevich\n\n19) Roman Petrovich\n\n20) Nicholas Mikhailovich\n\n21) Michael Mikhailovich\n\n22) George Mikhailovich\n\n23) Alexander Mikhailovich\n\n24) Andrei Alexandrovich\n\n25) Feodor Alexandrovich\n\n26) Sergei Mikhailovich\n\nNicholas when ill with typhoid did in fact at Alexandra's urging discuss altering the succession to allow his eldest daughter to succeed in the absence of a male heir - it was pointed out that he would struggle to get it through.

What on earth happened? How far back do you need to go to get a good Tsar on the throne? Any point after Tsarevich Nicholas?\n\nPart of the problem was that as the generations grew there was nothing much for them to do. Not all of them were completely useless some did as much as they could in the military or the artistic field etc without great distinction - but it was drummed into almost all members of the Imperial family that they were there to support the Emperor and not to question him. In addition they had their vast incomes from the Imperial appanages which for a Grand Duke was around £200,000 roubles a year.\n\nThey had no real reason to propose change until of course it was too late even if the emperor was going to listen to them.\n\nOf course with a strong Emperor like Alexander III most of the family were forced to toe the line - Nicholas II was on the one hand browbeaten by his uncles but on the other would stand on his dignity and offend them and his cousins when he insisted on certain matters particularly in terms of their attempts to make unsuitable marriages etc.\n\nNicholas was unfortunately as rigid as his father but without the ability to back up his intransigence and the fact his wife hardly knew the family she was marrying into and was prudishly intolerant herself just made it all worse.\n\nPaul might not have been a bad bet - he was moderate or as moderate as a Grand Duke got - but of course in the late 90's he'd begun his relationship with his second morganatic wife (though not yet married her) - he was also on reasonably good relations with his nephew and his wife at this period - helped by his closeness to his brother Serge who was married to Alexandra's sister.\n\nBut you would have to get rid of Nicholas, Michael, Vladimir and his three sons, then the two childless Grand Dukes' Alexei and Sergei - which would be a bit of a stretch.\n\nI was wondering what would happen if the main branch of the Romanovs died out in 1899. I don't know of any specific event that might work as a POD, but I simply want it to happen before Nicholas had the opportunity to completely ruin things.\n\nI think this would leave the throne of Vladimir Romanov, Alexander II's next son in line, and leave him with about 10 years on the throne to try and salvage things in.
