        "text": "On the surface...\n\nthere’s nothing special about Lilli. She didn’t write a memoir, like her cousin Olga. She didn’t say goodbye to Alexander II moments before his assassination, like her sister Ekaterina. But she left a huge impression on her suitor, Duke Adolph of Nassau. So much so that he waited years for her to grow up, until he could get her parents to agree to a wedding.\n\nThat’s when I realized\n\ntheirs was a story worth telling. But once I started digging, I realized Lilli’s story wasn’t complete without the story of her cousins, Adini and Olga. To get it right, you had to know why Lilli felt her destiny and Adini’s were linked. You had to know why it was so hard for Olga to find a suitable husband...and what happened when her parents thought Adolph might fit the bill.\n\nWe don’t know much about Lilli’s inner thoughts, her hopes, her needs, her dreams. She didn’t leave a memoir, diaries, or published volumes of her letters - at least none that are available outside Russian archives. That’s what makes telling this story so hard.\n\nSo why tell it at all?\n\nBecause it’s part of the larger tapestry of stories I’m working on. Because Lilli was so important to Adolph of Nassau (the father of my research subject, Grand Duchess Hilda of Baden). Because Lilli was the great-granddaughter of Augusta of Brunswick, another of my research subjects. She’s the middle point in a continuum of stories that takes us from Catherine the Great to 1918 and the German and Russian Revolutions.\n\nSo, yes, this is definitely the messiest of the big stories I’m working on. Six girls and their parents, plus their suitors, fiances, and husbands. Phew! As tangled and tangent-filled as this story may be, it’s also about dreams, hope, love, drama, heartbreak, tears, and tragedy. In other words, it’s just like my life or yours. I can’t think of a better reason to share it with the world.\n\nThis is a story of love, loss, and longing.\n\nIt’s about all of us, really.\n\nThe more I read about these women, the more I realized we really are all the same. Oh, sure, they lived in palaces and wore jewels that could buy a small country. But they also had sleepless nights wondering if a sick loved one would be better the next day. They cried when they thought no one was looking because the boy they liked didn’t like them back. They stared out the window and wondered if there was a point to any of this soul-crushing madness, if they’d ever amount to anything, if they’d ever be remembered.\n\nWhat parents don’t want the best for their kids? What kids don’t want the freedom to choose who they date or marry? What siblings don’t give into a little rivalry now and then?\n\nWe think of history as isolated, something set apart from our daily lives.\n\nIt’s not.\n\nThat’s why this is a different kind of history book, built around the stories of Lilli, Olga, Adini, and their sisters. There are plenty of detours where their stories intersect with a fascinating person or incident.\n\nWhat did Grand Duchess Olga think of Queen Victoria’s bae, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha?\n\nWhat exactly did a grand duchess get as a dowry?\n\nWhat went so catastrophically wrong between Elena and Mikhail?\n\nWho missed Lilli’s arrival in Nassau because he’d shot a dude in Hungary and been arrested?\n\nWhich museums have items that used to belong to the characters in our story?\n\nWhat does Grand Duchess Louise of Baden’s meat loaf recipe have to do with any of this? Well, nothing, but the fact that it exists and that I have it is too good not to share. You can get it by joining my mailing list.\n\nIf I were writing a traditional history book, all these incidents and references would have been left out, dismissed as tangential or irrelevant.\n\nTo me, they’re what make history come alive.\n\nI hope this story moves you. I hope it makes you cheer, makes you cry, and makes you call your sister. But first, I have to finish writing the thing.
