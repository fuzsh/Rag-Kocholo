        "text": "Jewels and Diamonds of the Grand Duchess Olga Feodorovna\n\nJewellery of Grand Duchess Olga Feodorovna\n\nThe jewel album Grand Duchess Olga Feodorovna.\n\nA virtual glimpse by Uwe Ripka\n\nThe barely seventeen-year-old Princess Cecilia of Baden (1839-1891) married on August 16, 1857 the Grand Duke Mikhail Nikolayevich Romanov (1832-1909), the youngest son of Tsar Nicholas I and Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna. Prior to marrying, it was necessary for Cecilia to accept the Russian Orthodox faith.\n\nSo she was baptized on August 15, 1857 in a ceremony being given the name Olga Feodorovna Ольга Фёдоровна.\n\nThe first important jewels were traditionally presented on this occasion.\n\nShe completed her jewels one day later, on the day of the wedding.\n\nThe majority was, however, given as a dowry the morning after the wedding. Here she received, among other things, a large sapphire set from Tsar Alexander II.\n\nIt consisted of a diadem, a large necklace and a large brooch.\n\nIn an album. almost all jewellery owned by Olga Feodorovna with drawings and partially detailed notes are provided.\n\nThis brooch is described as Sévigné.\n\nIt consists of two faceted sapphires and diamonds. Unfortunately, we lack the carat details. But there is 3 large diamonds, 6 medium and 13 smaller diamonds, and some even smaller stones, which are all located in the upper body and the suspension for the sapphire pendant.\n\nOther small diamonds are noted without number, which form the fringe. In addition, many small rose-cut diamonds were incorporated.\n\nThe versatile convertible version is made of silver and gold.\n\nThe brooch's value is specified as 10,950 rubles, while the tiara with 7 sapphires amounted to 39,725 rubles.\n\nThe very large necklace with 18 sapphires had a value of 57,450 rubles at that time. This devant de corsage was therefore very large.\n\nMeasured in comparison to the materials of the necklace and the tiara, the corsage brooch is relatively the most precious piece of this parure.\n\nOnly the necklace with sapphires has been preserved and was inherited by her son Mikhail Mikhailovich Romanov.\n\nHe sold the necklace in 1922 to Henry Lascelles, Earl of Harewood, who gave it to his bride Mary, Princess Royal, Countess of Harewood as a wedding gift.\n\nAfter her death in 1965, this necklace was purchased by an unknown buyer.\n\nThe sapphire brooch from this parure is similar in design to a turquoise brooch, which is expected to come from the same workshop and also had been in the possession of an Imperial Grand Duchess, see picture on the right above."
