        "text": "For cultural alarmists of the 1990s Clinton era, the film “Kids” represented a culmination of fears.\n\nReleased 20 years ago this month, the film centers on a cabal of broken New York teenagers who spend 24 hours boozing, rolling blunts, fighting and indulging in unsafe, emotionally vacant sex. It is “Lord of the Flies” with skateboards, nitrous oxide and hip-hop.\n\nUnflinching in its quasi-vérité realism, “Kids” opens with Telly, a pale and rawboned Lothario, deflowering an adolescent girl and ends with a drug-fueled rape at a house party. There is no thunderous moral reckoning, only observational detachment.\n\n“It makes almost any other portrait of American adolescence look like the picture of Dorian Gray,” Janet Maslin wrote of the unrated film in her review for The New York Times.\n\nHarvey Weinstein, who purchased and distributed the movie, wrote in an email: “ ‘Kids’ was the most controversial film I’ve ever been associated with.” His company, he said, was threatened by state courts that asserted that the film violated certain nonfederal laws. “The vitriolic reactions only reinforced its importance and further affirmed how special the film was,” Mr. Weinstein said.\n\nTwo decades later, “Kids” has become an art house classic and a cultural touchstone, celebrated by a screening last month at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, which reunited the cast for the first time, and a commemorative skate-wear collection at Supreme.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
