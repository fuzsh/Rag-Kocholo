        "text": "After method dressing, there's no denying the biggest red carpet trend among our favorite A-listers right now is celebrities wearing vintage. Not only is it a great sustainable fashion choice, but choosing to wear something from the designer archives seems to possess an unspeakable magical quality that hits different compared to a new season runway number. (Psssst: Extra points if it was previously worn by Hollywood royalty, too‚Äì√† la Katy Perry in Claudia Schiffer's orange Chanel thongkini from 1995.)\n\nWell, Blake Lively just upped the ante in a *big* way. The actor has been on a winning streak as of late by donning a series of floral-themed 'fits while promoting her new film It Ends With Us. But her sartorial prowess reached its crescendo at the film's world premiere when she arrived in a vintage 2003 Versace dress that was first worn by none other than Britney Spears.\n\nImpressive‚Äîbut even more so, when followed up with a Vogue photoshoot in which she wore Elizabeth Taylor's actual ruby and diamond necklace!\n\nFor the magazine's September 2024 issue, Blake poses in a movie-themed photoshoot shot by acclaimed director Baz Luhrmann. One scene/image sees her pose in a Monte Carlo casino wearing a plunging, backless gold sequined LaQuan Smith gown. With her trademark blonde hair styled in a deep side part and voluminous waves, Blake oozes old Hollywood glamour, making the Cartier necklace the perfect accessory.\n\nTaking to her Instagram stories to reveal the jewelry's history, Blake wrote the following over the snap: ‚ÄúThat's Elizabeth Taylor's actual necklace ü§Ø‚ù§Ô∏èüôè As a magpie, that was surreal.‚Äù\n\nFYI, Elizabeth Taylor was one of the biggest film stars during the 1950s, known just as much for her starring roles as her eight marriages to seven men (she married Richard Burton twice). Her love and collection of jewelry is also well recorded, with the ruby and diamond necklace being part of a matching earrings and bracelet Cartier set gifted to the actor by her third husband, Mike Todd, in 1957.\n\nThe moment was actually captured on film, albeit without sound.\n\nThe couple had a daughter together, Liza Todd, but was only married for 13 months when Todd was killed in a plane crash the following year. The ruby jewels were sold individually after Elizabeth Taylor‚Äôs death in 2011 as part of a Christie‚Äôs estate auction. The Cartier Collection bought the necklace for $3,778,500 with the earrings and bracelet, selling them to a private buyer for $782,500 and $842,500 respectively.\n\nTL;DR: We're not sure you can top wearing Elizabeth Taylor's vintage jewelry. Needless to say, this is officially Blake's style peak!\n\nFollow Alex on Instagram.\n\nYou Might Also Like"
