If you live in another country, your magazines are on their way. Hope you won’t have to wait too long.\n\nThis magazine is filled with wonderful testimonies that will draw mothers back to their homes and to living God’s plan for their lives. We must share this message to everyone we can. We live in a deceived age where even the majority of Christian women have left the home. We are no longer living by biblical standards in the church.\n\nI have also printed a number of testimonies of God restoring marriages. They will be such an encouragement to those whose marriages are fragmented and falling apart. I know you will think of many women to whom you will want to give this magazine. That’s a little difficult if you only received one magazine. It’s hard to give it away, isn’t it?\n\nHowever, you are welcome to email me for more magazines if you can effectively use them. I love to take a few Above Rubies with me every time I go out. Most supermarkets and restaurants have baby-changing tables in their bathrooms. A lovely idea is to put an Above Rubies magazine in the table and then it is waiting for the next mother who comes to change her baby.\n\nAnd you can look up these ideas for further ideas of how to share the magazines.\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/DistributingIdeas\n\nABOVE RUBIES PHONE NUMBER\n\nIf you need to call to call us, our phone umber is 931 729 9861. The area code is no longer 877!\n\nBABY NEWS\n\nWe have been so blessed to have new babies coming into our family and on the Hilltop—and more on the way.\n\nThe first one to arrive was Noble and Megan’s beautiful little daughter, Isla Rose who was born 25 November 2021. Noble is Pearl’s son and Megan is Erin’s daughter Have you read the wonderful testimony of Erin Harrison (who adopted two special needs children) in the latest issue of Above Rubies on pages 16-18? You will love this testimony. So, Erin is the grandmother, and I am the great-grandmother!\n\nI love what Megan wrote recently on her Facebook. In fact, I love to behold the way these young mothers are mothering. They are the most beautiful, happy, and embracing-motherhood mothers you could ever find.\n\n“I never knew how fulfilling it would be to be a mother, but now I understand completely. Waking every morning to be greeted by a happy little smiling baby is one of the major highlights of course! Even though there are many moments where it can be a challenge, I still love every moment, because every challenge is making me learn and grow as a mother.\n\n“I feel like I can look at her all day and never get tired of it, and I’ve never known a feeling like the love I have for this little baby. God surely knew what He was doing when He put instincts in a mother. They make us so bonded to our babies and fearlessly protective of them.”\n\n******************************************************\n\nMegan’s sister, Molly also gave birth to her darling baby boy, Hiro Atlas on the 6 January so they are enjoying their babies together. They are also now part of the family.\n\nMolly is married to Riku who is Kahoru’s brother. Kahoru is married to Bowen, Pearl’s oldest son.\n\nMolly who has Type 1 Diabetes did so marvelously with her pregnancy and birth.\n\n******************************************************\n\nChalice and Trae’s little baby girl, Marvel Lea, arrived at home in December. Chalice is Serene’s daughter. Little Marvel was not really so little, and she continues to grow fatter every day. Oh, don’t you love chubby fat babies?\n\n******************************************************\n\nOur daughter Mercy gave birth to little Ezra on the 4 January, same day as Serene’s birthday and my mother who would have been 106 years if she was still alive!\n\n******************************************************\n\nAnd then our granddaughter, Gaby (Gabrielle Warden) gave birth to sweet Shiloh Brave on 15 January. Don’t they all have such beautiful names? Gaby wrote on her Facebook: “On the most surreal, beautiful, and love-filled morning of our lives our baby girl has joined us earth side.”\n\n******************************************************\n\nAnd now we are waiting for more babies:\n\nKahoru and Bowen can hardly wait for their second baby boy in May.\n\nAddie and Isaiah are due to have their first baby, Solomon Michael in June.\n\nMeadow and Kendall are waiting for the third baby, a little girl in July.\n\nAnd we are sure to hear more exciting news this coming year.\n\nThis coming Saturday Cherish and Ben will be married. Cherish is Serene and Sam’s daughter. Sam and his team of builders are working very hard to get the wedding barn prepared in time. It’s going to be amazing.\n\nLIFE TO THE FULL WITH NANCY CAMPBELL\n\nI mentioned in the magazine that I have now changed the name of my podcast to LIFE TO THE FULL! I trust you’re enjoying these podcasts.\n\nWE LOVE OUR KITCHENS\n\nErin Harrison (her testimony is in the current magazine) and I recently did a Three-Part series called WE LOVE OUR KITCHENS. I know you will love this series.\n\n187. WE LOVE OUR KITCHENS, Part 1\n\nhttps://www.buzzsprout.com/183665/9843168\n\n188. WE LOVE OUR KITCHENS, Part 2\n\nhttps://www.buzzsprout.com/183665/9906312\n\n189. WE LOVE OUR KITCHENS, Part 3\n\nhttps://www.buzzsprout.com/183665/9944028\n\nIn Part 3 Erin and I continue sharing about the GLORY OF THE KITCHEN. Did I say “glory”? Yes. It certainly can become glory when we get the right attitude and vision. We also talk about how important it is to have a meal ready for our husbands when they come home from work. What does a husband want more than anything?\n\nA WARM WELCOME HOME,\n\nA WARM MEAL ON THE TABLE, and\n\nA WARM BED! This means more than an electric blanket!!!\n\nThese are very basic but wonderful things that will bless your husband, but as I thought more about this, I thought WARM IS LOVELY BUT . . .\n\nI think we can notch it up further and make it a . . .\n\nHOT AND SPICY WELCOME\n\nDon’t just yell Hi from the kitchen when your husband comes home. Get up from what you are doing. Go to the door or walk toward your husband and welcome him with open arms and a loving and lingering kiss. Tell him how happy you are to see him. A warm welcome is nice, but a hot spicy welcome is even nicer!\n\nHOT AND SPICY MEAL\n\nMake a lovely nutritious meal for your husband and family but make it spicy and full of flavor too. Bland food is boring. Spice up your food with herbs and spices and if you are up to it, hot peppers too. Basic, wholesome food changes from satisfying to scrumptious when you make it flavorful. God gave us tastebuds. Tantalize those tastebuds. Try out new things.\n\nAnd spice up your family mealtimes with good conversation. Mealtimes can be terribly boring if there is no purposeful conversation. As I raised our children, I found that it was just as important to think about what we would talk about as what I would cook for the meal. Things don’t just happen. You have to make them happen. Think of a subject to bring to the table to discuss with your husband and family—political, biblical, historical, or geographical. Ask a question and get each one in the family to share their thoughts. Think of ideas to make your mealtimes exciting.\n\nHOT AND SPICY BED\n\nAlways be ready to love your husband passionately. Forget being passive and pour out your hot spicy love on him. He is waiting for it. As you give to him, you will be blessed beyond measure. Proverbs 5:20 tells us that the wife is to “satisfy” and “ravish” her husband. Yes, that’s King James language. Other translations say “captivate, intoxicate, exhilarate, rapture” I can’t let you off the hook, ladies. It’s Bible!\n\nYour husband will love coming home to you!\n\nFIVE NECESSARY QUALITIES FOR END TIME LIVING!\n\nDid you get to listen to this series? Eight sessions on this subject.\n\nAnd now, I have just begun a new series called THE LAND OF MOTHERHOOD. You are going to enjoy these too.\n\nGo to http://ARPoddy.buzzsprout.com or your favorite poddy app for LIFE TO THE FULL w/ Nancy Campbell\n\nNEW ABOVE RUBIES HELPER\n\nMy two current Above Rubies helpers will be leaving at the end of this week. They have been with me for nearly three months, and it is time for them to return home. I have one new girl with me, currently learning the ropes. However, I am looking for one more helper. I like to have two girls at a time, so they are company for one another.\n\nI prefer girls to be at least 17 years of age, ready for a mission trip. They need to be able to use the computer well and have a good work attitude.\n\nIf your daughter is interested in being an Above Rubies helper, could you please contact me at 615 524 1572 or 931 729 9861 or email me at This email address is being protected from spambots. You need JavaScript enabled to view it. . Thank you so much. You can ask me all the questions you need to ask.\n\nSINGAPORE AND ASIAN READERS\n\nDear lovely ladies in Singapore and Asia. Very sadly, the computer of our director in Singapore crashed and she lost the whole of our Above Rubies Asian mailing list. I am so burdened that I cannot send you the magazines. This is now the third magazine you have missed. If you read this newsletter, can you please email me your current mailing address so I can send you the latest magazine?\n\nSOUTH AFRICAN READERS\n\nAnother sad situation. Our director in South African has had troubles in sending out the magazines and therefore no one in South Africa has been receiving the magazines either. If you are a South African reader, please email me your address so we can send you the magazine. We will be so happy to do that.\n\nABOVE RUBIES FAMILY RETREATS\n\nThe first one coming up this year is the annual GULF COAST retreat in\n\nLaguna Beach, Panama City, Florida, 21 – 27 APRIL\n\nLocation: https://christiancamp.com/\n\nApril 21-24 (Conference Only) or\n\nApril 20-27 (Full Week)\n\nTo check out details and register, go to:\n\nhttps://aboverubiesgulfcoast.com/\n\nFamilies have the option of coming for the official conference or you may stay the full week for unofficial and informal hangouts, sharing, prayer, and evangelism. We highly recommend coming for the full week as the conference schedule is packed tight with activities. Having a few extra days to relax and enjoy getting to know people is everyone’s favorite part of the week!\n\nAll accommodations are filling up fast so you will need to book now!\n\nCHANGE OF DATE FOR CALIFORNIA\n\nThe dates for the California retreat are printed wrongly in the magazine. They should be 5 – 7 August.\n\nCheck out this link to see further retreats for this year:\n\nAbove Rubies Retreat & Family Camp Info and Schedule\n\nMOTHERHOOD IS MY GLORY\n\nDid you read the lovely testimony from Karissa Collins on page 27 of this magazine? Have you checked out her Instagram yet @thecollinskids? You will love watching Karissa and their beautiful children doing something special every day. They will keep you entertained.\n\nP.S. I just typed the lovely news that Karissa was expecting a new baby, but now I read that there is no heartbeat. Here is what Karissa wrote:\n\nThe love of a mother is indescribable!\n\nIt can’t be defined by words.\n\nThere’s no limit to a mother’s love.\n\nOnly a mother can understand it.\n\nNo one can describe it.\n\nIt starts in the womb.\n\nA love that can’t be contained or quenched.\n\nIt doesn’t stop but grows greater and greater with each child.\n\nIt surpasses impossible limits.\n\nIt’s never ending.\n\nIt’s eternal.\n\nWith a heavy yet grateful heart, I deliver this news. I had a sonogram today and got to see our sweet baby. There’s no longer a heartbeat. You don’t understand how much you love someone until they’re gone. My body doesn’t have any signs of miscarriage. Everything looks great except a missing heartbeat.\n\nI came home and told my children and Andersyn immediately prayed for resurrection. Nothing is impossible for Yahuwah. So until my body passes this baby, we will believe for that. Either way, God has been preparing me for this. He is good. He is faithful. And to be praised. We will not be shaken. We will trust in him and wait upon the Lord.\n\n~ Karissa Collins\n\nINSTAGRAM\n\nIf you are on Instagram, I would encourage you to also check out The Transformed Wife with Lori Alexander and also HomeAndGardenTN with Amy Laurie. Both of these are very encouraging and affirming to mothers.\n\nAlso, please check out my Above Rubies Instagram: _above_rubies_\n\nThis time last year my Instagram account was hacked, and I lost all my posts and well over 12,000 subscribers. Now, I only have a few subscribers. If you are on Instagram, please encourage others to come back so they can be encouraged.

They are not standing so much against vaccinations but against MANDATES!\n\nNo one should be mandated to go against their own freedoms in our free western countries. What happens in Canada will affect the rest of the world.\n\nPlease pray that Justin Trudeau will release freedom to his people.\n\nWe are in a battle and this battle will take the earnest and daily committed prayers of God’s people.\n\nTHOSE WHO HAVE MORE WILL GET MORE!\n\nThis is an interesting principle, isn’t it? I read the other morning in Numbers 33:54: “And ye shall divide the land by inheritance among your families; and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance.”\n\nThe Complete Jewish Bible translates it clearly: “You are to give more land to the longer families and less to the smaller ones.”\n\nThe humanistic mindset of our society thinks that if we have too many children we will stay poor. We will be deprived of many things. But this Scripture promises that those who have more children will get more land! Those who have less will receive less.\n\nAnd it is true. God does not provide for children that we don’t yet have. He is a faithful God. He provides when a new baby comes along. Therefore, the more babies God gives you the more provision will come your way. It’s just the way it works.\n\nDeuteronomy 28:4 – 13 tells us that the first blessing God gives is the fruit of the womb. But when He gives the fruit of the womb, He adds so many more blessings to enable you to provide for the fruit of the womb.\n\nYou don’t get the provision first; you get the baby first.\n\nAnd then comes the blessing of provision!\n\nDeuteronomy 28:4 (BSB) tells us: “The fruit of your womb will blessed, AS WELL as the Produce of your land and the offspring of your livestock—the calves of your herds and the lambs of your flocks.” Look it up and keep reading until verse 13 to read all the rest of the blessings.\n\nI know some big families live in small homes, but it may not be forever. God will enlarge you as your family enlarges.\n\nWHAT DO YOU WANT?\n\nI don’t know about you, but when raising my children, I was not content for the status quo. Although our children have all grown and have all done amazing things in this life (and I am sure they will yet do greater things), I was not really so interested in what fêtes they would accomplish, but only that they would have a consuming passion for God and His kingdom.\n\nThis does not just happen. We as parents must be totally dedicated to God. If our children see half-heartedness in us, they will gravitate to half-heartedness. They always gravitate to the easier way. It takes hours of prayer and crying out to God. It takes steering them in paths of righteousness and true holiness.\n\nIt breaks my heart that the majority of “Christian” children today know more about their video games than they do of God’s Word.\n\nDearest mothers, what do you want your children to be filled with? Do you want them to be FILLED with the truth of God’s Word or are you happy for them to be captivated with social media that consume so many children today? What are the standards you have for your children? If you want children who are totally consumed with a passion for God, you can’t allow them to be consumed with the worldly games of today. I guess it comes down to the question: WHAT DO YOU WANT?\n\nA Christian man recently wrote: “I personally have been in churches that were supposedly ‘filled with the anointing’ and watched the children in the seats in front of me playing Pokémon and dungeons and dragons while the parents ‘worshipped God.’” They must be consumed with it to be doing it in church. The sad thing is that many Christian parents are now consumed with social media themselves!\n\nThis won’t turn this nation around to God. How can this be happening in such an hour of desperation?\n\nIf we want our children to be radical for God, we better start being radical ourselves. If we want our children to grow up to turn this nation back to God, we better steer them to pursue God, not the occultist junk of this world.\n\nI must confess that I am tired of status quo, average, sitting on the fence, half-hearted, lukewarm, compromising, and following the trends of the world Christianity. I’m tired of the continual lowering of godly standards among God’s people.\n\nIt all comes back to us parents. What is our consuming passion for our lives? What is our consuming passion for our children’s lives?\n\nMay God clothe you with His blessings. May He pour out His blessings on you and your husband, your home, and all your children.\n\nIN HIS LOVE,\n\nNANCY CAMPBELL\n\nwww.aboverubies.org"
