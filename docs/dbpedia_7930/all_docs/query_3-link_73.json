        "text": "“I mean, how many young women get a set of rubies just for doing something wholesome like swimming laps? Or win a diamond ring at ping pong with their husband? Well, I did, and for all of these memories and the people in my life I feel blessed.”\n\nThe rubies were Cartier, from Mike Todd. The ring, from a shop in Gstaad, were from Richard Burton. The documentary Elizabeth Taylor: The Lost Tapes that recently premiered on HBO is notable for being told through Taylor’s own words, but hers is a life that can also be told through love—and through jewelry.\n\nThe record-breaking sale of her collection at Christie’s in 2011 was a kind of diamond-studded biography. Each lot served as a timeline of films made, marriages celebrated, roles won, loves lost. Taylor’s jewelry has always reflected her own strength and beauty. “I’ve never thought of my jewelry as trophies,” said Taylor. “I’m here to take care of it and to love it, for we are only temporary custodians of beauty.”\n\nThe Christies sale of Elizabeth Taylor’s jewelry was a landmark, as filled with drama as her own life, and it was one to remember. “When I first got my copy of My Love Affair With Jewelry,” says Christie’s jewelry specialist Claibourne Poindexter, “my world was transformed. I still have the book on my shelf, the spine cracked from reading it hundreds of times and immersing my mind in the glamour and style that is Elizabeth Taylor. When she passed away in 2011, I was bound and determined to go to that auction, despite being in college and years before I myself would come to work for Christie’s. Everything about that evening is something that I will never forget. From lining up at the entrance waiting for the doors to open and everyone getting their assigned seats, to Lot 1, one of her charm bracelets, opening up for sale and seeing 25 auction paddles raised in the air at one time, it still gives me goosebumps to think about. I had been to many auctions before and have been to many since… but there is only one Elizabeth Taylor. It was, and probably will always be, the greatest auction I have ever attended.”\n\nAnd though it’s difficult to play favorites with a collection so full of pieces that reflect such a storied personal history—as well as actual historic pieces—we asked the jewelry expert to do just that. Here, as we look back on Elizabeth Taylor’s spectacular life once again, is a look back at her spectacular jewels.Below, Poindexter shares his top five (OK, actually six) of Elizabeth Taylor's jewels."
