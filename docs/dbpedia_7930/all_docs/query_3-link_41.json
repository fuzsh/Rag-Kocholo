        "text": "What I Really Want to do is. . . Write: Boaz Yakin on \"A\n\nPrice Above Rubies\"\n\nby Anthony Kaufman\n\nWriter/director of “Fresh” and writer of such screenplays as Clint\n\nEastwood’s “The Rookie“, Boaz Yakin returns to the director’s chair for\n\n“A Price Above Rubies“, the story of Sonia, (played by “Jerry Maguire“\n\ndarling, Renee Zellweger) a Hasidic woman struggling to free herself\n\nfrom her surroundings. To many cynics, it seems impossible that a\n\nwhite Jewish male could write intelligently and perceptively about young\n\nblacks in the hood and then a Hasidic woman trapped in her Orthodox\n\ncommunity. But after speaking with Yakin (who for the record went to a\n\nYeshiva on the Upper West Side until he was 15 years-old), he appears to\n\nhave the required imagination and ability to delve into these foreign\n\nworlds. He also has an affinity with his characters that crosses\n\nracial and sexual lines. “I really tried to do a film more balanced and\n\nopen about the difficulty of being an individual in that society.”\n\nAs far as the potentially controversial subject matter, Yakin claims, “I\n\nknew when I wrote it, obviously, that I was writing things that we’re\n\ngoing to be upsetting to certain people,” he explains, “but the goal was\n\nto write something that asked questions and that wasn’t necessarily easy\n\nto swallow in every way. In a lot of ways, I feel I made a gentler film\n\nthan I might have,. . . but I really felt had I gone in that direction,\n\nit actually wouldn’t have gotten across the human point that I wanted to\n\nget across.”\n\n“A Price Above Rubies” was produced by independent producer of the\n\nmoment, Lawrence Bender (“Pulp Fiction“, “Good Will Hunting“), so I\n\ndecided to begin the interview with discussion about him.\n\nindieWIRE: How did you get involved with Lawrence Bender?\n\nBoaz Yakin: We were friends. When I moved to Los Angeles. . . I optioned\n\nmy first script when I was 19 years-old and I was at NYU. I was\n\nfortunate enough to get an option. I ended up moving out to Los\n\nAngeles. And I just, Lawrence was a friend of a common friend. So we\n\nkind of became buddies. He was broke and I had to take him to Cantor’s\n\nfor lunch, like he wanted to go and I had to pay for it. He was really\n\nbroke. He was struggling for years, working very hard. And, in fact,\n\nthe first film he produced was a film that I introduced him to my other\n\nfriend, Scotty, Scott Spiegel, and they made this low budget, horror\n\nfilm called, “Intruder” for like $200,000. And Scotty and I wrote this\n\nthing, “The Rookie”. Actually, it was Scotty that introduced Lawrence\n\nto Quentin [Tarantino]. And at that time, I was leaving Los Angeles. I\n\nwas out of there. I had had it with L.A. I lived in France for a\n\nyear. While I was in France, Lawrence produced “Reservoir Dogs” and he\n\ncalled me up and said, “If you could write a script for a low enough\n\nbudget, I think I can get this thing made now.” At that time, I was\n\nthinking about not making movies anymore. I’d had it. I was doing okay\n\nselling scripts and things, but it wasn’t the kind of thing. . .\n\niW: Did you see yourself as being a director?\n\nYakin: Interestingly enough, I got into screenwriting in order to use it\n\nas a path to directing. Now I realize what I’d really like to do more\n\nthan anything is write. I much prefer it to directing. It’s my\n\nfavorite thing in the world to do. Sometimes you discover your “metier”\n\nso to speak, when you’re thinking you’re going to do something else. I\n\nhave to say I can see directing for awhile, if I can, if I’m lucky to\n\nget my scripts financed. But it is such a physically exhausting,\n\nmentally exhausting, emotionally draining thing, that I can’t see doing\n\nit forever — it’s just not a life. It’s terrible. And I seem to\n\nalways have a tough time getting my stuff made. And the sort of battle\n\nto get it made, to find the financing and all that, just wears you out.\n\nSo I think without complaining, that while I can, I’d like to try and\n\nmake as many films as I can. And then I’d like to just write. But not\n\nscripts.\n\niW: Then what?\n\nYakin: I don’t know. Fiction. Writing is great because essentially\n\nall the battles you fight are battles with yourself and your own\n\nlimitations. And filmmaking is like, you show up, you don’t have enough\n\ntime, you don’t have enough money, and the clouds are wrong, and you\n\nonly have two shots instead of ten shots. Essentially, you’re spending\n\nyour day batting your head against the wall, against reality. Whereas\n\nI’d much rather bat my head against this sort of fantasy world that I\n\nlike to live in. So eventually . . . But for now I’m trying to do this.\n\niW: So tell me about those battles that “A Price Above Rubies” faced?\n\nYakin: Everyone passed on it. And finally what happened was almost by\n\na stroke of luck, not luck, but. . . Lawrence was in England for some\n\nproject that had nothing to do with this, but he ended up hooking up\n\nwith this guy, Ernst Goldschmidt who runs a company called Pandora who\n\nhad read the script and was wondering what was going on with it.\n\nLawrence told them, if we can get a European financier involved, maybe\n\nwe can get Miramax to put up the other half of the money. Ernst was the\n\nguy who really got it made. And Miramax agreed to put up a certain\n\namount. But that was after many months of a long time looking like this\n\nmovie was not going to happen.\n\niW: Was there any politicking with Miramax?\n\nYakin: No, I think it was a matter of them feeling like the film was\n\nnot, you know — who wants to see a film about Hasidism? There were\n\ncertain things about the script that I think they wanted worked on. And\n\nI did some work on the script. It was mainly that Lawrence leaned on\n\nthem. Once we got the European part of it, I think Harvey [Weinstein]\n\njust went, “Oh fuck it, my risk has been minimized to the point of where\n\nI might as well make this fucking thing so they leave me alone.”\n\niW: And they pretty much left you alone once it was shot?\n\nYakin: It was good. You know, of course, once you get into editing,\n\nyou do your screenings and “Oh, this needs to be shorter, this needs to\n\nbe this.” But that’s just normal. And they never made me do anything\n\nthat I didn’t feel was right. It was just a matter of discussions and\n\narguments which is fine. I felt actually they were pretty cool\n\nthroughout the whole process once they got on board.\n\niW: So as opposed to “Fresh”, do you feel this is in any ways less your\n\npersonal vision or has it maintained the same. . . ?\n\nYakin: I’d say it has maintained the exact same level. Essentially,\n\nwhat I’m happy about in terms of both films is that even though there\n\nwere things. . . look, you compromise all the way through a film. But\n\nif the film at the end of the day reflects what your original intention\n\nwas, I think it’s a good achievement, considering the environment of\n\nmaking movies. This and “Fresh”, both reflect my script and my vision.\n\nThis one was tougher for me in certain ways than “Fresh” because I was\n\nwriting from a woman’s point of view, which I had never done before,\n\nwhich I found very difficult at first and then got into. I was working\n\nwith different kinds of actors on this one. But in terms of my\n\nintentions, both of them are equally personal.\n\niW: So considering now that you think your heart is in writing, what\n\nwere some of the difficulties you faced in the directing process?"
