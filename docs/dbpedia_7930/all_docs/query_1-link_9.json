        "text": "I have a tendency to explore and rent movies that I never heard about. I recognized the title as a quotation from the Bible. It quotes Proverbs, which is a book that I read every day in my quite time. Proverbs is a book that has thirty-one chapters of wisdom. I like Ren√©e Zellweger (Jerry Maguire, One True Thing) \"Sonia\" and liked the character she played, enjoyed her expertise in gemology and jewelry and could empathize and sometimes identify with her. Her family was a family of fanatics. She had a good relationship with her brother. Her brother kept coming back as the voice of her very own conscience, and kept Sonia true to herself. This movie to me parallels the movie: \"At Play in the Fields of the Lord\" which deals with fanaticism in a Protestant community. Both of those movies deal with people that are excessively judgmental. \"Too heavenly minded that they are no earthly good.\" I am quoting a song, but I cannot remember the name of the singer and we lost the tape we had.\n\nI found that Christopher Eccleston (Elizabeth) \"Sender,\" was a very mean and annoying person, and a non understanding husband. A fanatic, he could not enjoy life itself because everything in his mind was a sin. How binding! He felt that he had problems dealing with his wife, but instead of dealing with her, he went to the synagogue and prayed instead of talking to her. As the movie was showing: what is the point of praying when you are unable to ask for forgiveness? Julianna Margulies (ER) \"Rachel\" was very judgmental. She had the kind of fanaticism that leads people to leave their own family homeless because they do not agree with them. I just wonder where is God in all this? This is a very interesting movie, which I recommend, because it made me think about: (1) keeping checks and balances on my own behavior as a believer; (2) thinking about the emancipation of women in this type of environment; (3) seeing how people can live under the bondage of fear and guilt, without any relief ever; (4) how they appear never to experience the deliverance that forgiveness brings; (5) and the core of religion which is love. Love is what unites people and leads mankind toward God, who is love Himself. The movie was nominated for Grand Special Prize at the Deauville Film Festival. This movie is worthwhile watching, it is enlightening because it shows the dark and sad side of religion, which is in itself evil and therefore the opposite of God! Favorite Quotes: \"We suffer because it is just the way it is.\" Rabbi: \"We don't question the ways of God.\" Sonia: \"Dr.Rabbi I am going to question whatever I want.\" Artist: \"This is the garden of the jeweler. This is Adam, and you are Eve.\" Sonia: \"I suppose that makes you are the snake!\" \"Walls have to be broken down so you can see what they were hiding inside. \"Favorite Scenes: Sonia stating that she does not belong in there.\n\nThere is no way she could belong with those people, ever!"
