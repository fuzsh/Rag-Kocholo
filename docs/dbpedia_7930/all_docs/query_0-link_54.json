        "text": "A Century of Film\n\nMiramax / The Weinstein Company\n\nThe Studio\n\nSome forty years ago, long before one brother sank beneath the weight of his other brother’s sexual crimes, there were Bob and Harvey Weinstein. Though they were from New York City, they had been successful with a rock promotion business in Buffalo during the seventies. But their passion for films won them over and began a small, independent distribution business that they named after their parents Miriam and Max.\n\n“These were the Weinstein brothers, Harvey and Bob. In the mid-eighties, they were a unique hybrid combining the competitive yet collegial world of Cinecom and Island with the dealmeister approach of Golan and Gobus at Cannon. … The Weinsteins might have acted like hustlers, but they seemed to have much better taste than your average hustler.” (Spike, Mike, Slackers & Dykes, John Pierson, p 84-85).\n\nNormally in the Century of Film posts, I act as if it’s the end of 2011 and we’ve just completed the first century of film. But for this post, partially because of the way TWC and Miramax are both effectively done and partially because of the fall of Harvey Weinstein (I’ve been working on this to get it done because I was afraid he would die and I would be appalled if anyone thought this was a tribute to Weinstein so I wanted to make certain this was published before that potential event), it’s so difficult to pretend that it’s the past. So this is a full reckoning of the two independent studios that the Weinsteins created.\n\nThis is not the full sordid history of the brothers and their lives. There’s too much to say about Harvey and so much of it is awful. Years before his fall and imprisonment, Peter Biskind in his book Down and Dirty Pictures: Miramax, Sundance, and the Rise of Independent Film (a seminal book to read about the studio – see the bottom of the post for my full take on the book) gave a pretty good description of him: “The Lizzie Grubman of the movie business, Harvey is like a drunk driver who jumps the curb, maims a few pedestrians, swerves crazily back into traffic, and screeches to a halt inches from a stroller, whereupon he leaps out, grabs the baby and holds it up for everyone to see as he takes credit for saving its life.” (p 4)\n\nSo, if you want more about them, read the books that are out there. Biskind’s book does focus more on their work and not their lives and it was published back in 2004 but I’m certain there will be others before too long that really will tell the whole ugly, repulsive story. So this introduction will focus on a brief history of the studios and if you want more, there are others places you can find that info (it turned out not to be so brief and I really truncated things after 2000 to even get it to that point). With COVID still raging, I’ve been forced to do this just with the materials I own but there are more books out there.\n\nThe Weinsteins actually tried to make a film once: “The Weinsteins had been making like the Taviani Brothers, co-directing a feature for Universal Pictures called Playing for Keeps. It is the pits, although they did call in some chits from their years as rock ‘n’ roll concert promoters in Buffalo, to assemble an impressive soundtrack album with artists like Phil Collins, Pete Townshend, and Eric Clapton. Having quickly realized their limitations as filmmakers, Bob and Harvey jumped back into their distribution company with a vengeance.” (Pierson, p 87) Playing for Keeps, as noted, was a Universal film so isn’t ranked below but it would be at about #490 to give an idea of its quality. Pierson knew them well at this point because they decided they wanted to distribute the film Working Girls that Pierson was involved with and they massively outbid the other distributors. Pierson explains not only why he went with them but why others did as well: “They had an instinctual grasp of how to walk the tightrope between sensationalistic come-on and classy intellectual tease.” (Pierson, p 87)\n\nPierson would then again deal with the brothers when they would distribute the documentary The Thin Blue Line which would make a big splash and help establish them as the premiere independent distributors in American film. What’s more, they differed greatly from New World Pictures and AIP by focusing much more on art-house films and the possibility of winning awards and getting critical attention. This strategy was born out at the Oscars before too long. By 1992, with just 44 Miramax films even having been submitted it had already earned more Oscar nominations than AIP (369 Oscar submitted films) and New World (163 submitted films) combined. That was also the year that Miramax earned its second Best Picture nomination, putting them one more than New World and AIP combined.\n\nThe Thin Blue Line might have been a success story in terms of critical acclaim and national attention, but it also highlighted something else that would be a hallmark of the studio: “Errol had already spent years editing his film. Miramax has acquired it ‘as is’, without any contingencies as to running time. Harvey now suggested that it should be five to ten minutes shorter.” (Pierson, p 109) This was still 1988, so Edward Scissorhands hadn’t been released yet to give Harvey what would soon be one of his nicknames: Harvey Scissorhands.\n\nPelle the Conqueror, which Harvey tried to market as an Adventure film to sell it outside of big cities (which didn’t work), was the first success for Miramax at the Oscars, earning it its first major nomination (Best Actor) and its first win (Best Foreign Film). Pelle would also be emblematic of Miramax’s box office approach. It opened quite small and then eventually made far more than its opening weekend would suggest. All the way until the end, Miramax would rely on that strategy. Only with the Dimension films which were designed for bigger opening weekends, would Miramax abandon the platform approach of a limited opening release then a wider push. Miramax would eventually have nine films make over $75 million (not including Dimension films) and none of them earned more than 15% of their total gross in their opening weekends.\n\nIn the winter of 1988-89, Miramax purchased distribution rights to two films that would help pave the way for the future. The first was My Left Foot, seen by Harvey in England in late 1988 but held back until November of 1989 and pushed for major Oscars, which it succeeded in scoring, managing Picture and Director nominations where Glory stumbled. The second, seen at Sundance, was sex, lies and videotape which at $25 million, would outgross all of Miramax’s previous films combined and would continue to the be the studio’s biggest hit until the fall of 1992.\n\nMy Left Foot owed part of its success to a new trend that Weinstein would eventually leverage to the hilt: “Companies were starting to send our screener tapes to Academy members, a practice that leveled the playing field. ‘The tapes are what did it for My Left Foot,’ says Weinstein. ‘We didn’t have the money to do screening after screening, busing people in, having lavish parties. That gave us parity.'” (Biskind, p 98-99)\n\nIn 1990 and 1991, however, the studio hit a wall. Though it won the Oscar for Foreign Film each year (completing a four year streak and in the midst of a 12 year streak of winning at least one Oscar – the longest streak by any studio since 1972) and had the most Oscar nominated films of any studio in 1990 with five, it couldn’t manage a Best Picture nomination and it couldn’t find mainstream success. Of the first 41 films released after My Left Foot, only Truth or Dare managed to break $15 million (and just barely) and the films averaged just $3 million. Miramax needed a hit or awards success to stay alive.\n\n1992 saved the game for the studio. The modest box office success of Enchanted April (with eventual Oscar nominations), the start of the genre subsidiary studio Dimension Films and its first film Hellraiser III (the first Miramax film to have an opening weekend over $3 million) and the release of Reservoir Dogs which began the studio’s relationship with Quentin Tarantino all set the stage for the massive success of The Crying Game. The Crying Game was far and away the biggest hit the studio had ever released, grossing over $60 million in the States and returning Miramax to a Best Picture race from which it would never leave. That success set the stage for the next level: “On April Fool’s Day, Katzenberg phoned Chris McGurk, who was then CFO of Disney Studios, and said, ‘Hey, call Harvey Weinstein, let’s talk to him about buying the company.'” (Biskind, p 149)\n\nThis was a true win-win. Disney ensured that Miramax would have the budget to get (or make) the films they wanted with a hands-off approach provided they stuck within the budget and Miramax would finally start bringing in some Oscars to the studio. But it would remain to be seen how good films would be if Miramax actually made them:\n\nNow that Miramax was on its way to becoming a producer as well as an acquirer and distributor, the biggest question mark was whether the Weinsteins would be as skillful developing, shooting, and editing their own films as they had been acquiring those of others, which is to say, it’s much easier to recognize in a finished film elements that can be exploited for an effective marketing campaign than it is to develop an idea from scratch and successfully see it through production. Not to put too fine a point on it, none of the films Miramax had produced up to that point had been any good. (Biskind, p 153)\n\nThen Harvey started taking on all of Hollywood. His presence was important: “Each year Miramax releases as many films as a couple of studios combined. By virtue of the volume of its output, it is by far the largest employer of above-the-line talent and below-the-line crew in New York City, and it has a significant presence in Los Angeles as well.” (Biskind, p 3) And in the middle of all this, came their greatest film.\n\n“Taking in $107,921,755 at the U.S. box office, Pulp Fiction was the tenth highest grossing movie of 1994, becoming the most profitable independent film ever made. The film took in an additional $105 million overseas. For the first time, Hollywood’s major studios were forced to pay attention to the New York-centric world of independent film and could no longer ignore Miramax and its ringleader, Harvey Weinstein. The success of Pulp Fiction fueled a move to create art-house divisions on the studio lots – Fox Searchlight, Paramount Classics, October (later USA Films), and, though it took a decade, Warner Independent – that were aimed at breeding crossover indie hits and cultivating indie talent for the major studios.” (Rebels on the Backlot: Six Maverick Directors and How They Conquered the Studio System, Sharon Waxman, p xvii-xviii)\n\nBut after a weaker 1995, 1996 helped the studio stay on top with another $100 million film (Scream) and the elusive prize that Harvey had long been after: Best Picture. The English Patient would not only be the big winner for Miramax, but one of the biggest films in Oscar history and helped Miramax to a whopping 12 total Oscars in 1996. It would also, ironically, lead to a deal that would make the Weinsteins personally a lot of money but would deny Miramax a much, much larger amount of money, prestige and Oscar gold. English Patient producer Saul Zaentz happened to own the rights to the Lord of the Rings and Weinstein connected him with director Peter Jackson who had released Heavenly Creatures through Miramax. In the end, because Miramax was owned by Disney, given the cost of the potential production, Weinstein needed Michael Eisner’s permission to take on the project and Eisner wouldn’t do it. Not wanting to give it up, Weinstein applied draconian terms to hold on to the film but Jackson’s perseverance and the intelligent insight from Bob Shaye at New Line ended up with the project being moved and being released as three films instead of Jackson’s originally proposed two or Disney’s offer to make just one with a more limited budget. The Weinsteins names would appear on the film and they would make money from it, but it was not to be the their baby. (for more on this, see the books at the bottom of the post)\n\nComing out of The English Patient, Miramax was now firmly in the Oscar business. Every year would see a film pushed hard for the Oscars and always landing one among the Best Picture nominees. The next year would see Good Will Hunting and the start of Matt and Ben. After that would be a nomination for Life is Beautiful (22 years with no foreign Best Picture nominees and Miramax did it twice in four years) and the Oscar for Shakespeare in Love.\n\nBut Shakespeare also seemed to be the point where it became much more well known the kind of things that Weinstein would do to get his film to succeed. As described on pages 369 and 370 of Down and Dirty Pictures, this was where the Oscar campaigning really took off, this is where the reputation of Harvey using dirty tricks to attack other films came from and this is the point where Harvey rushed up on stage to grab the mic away from Ed Zwick because this was his big Oscar moment.\n\nThe following 100 pages of Biskind’s book takes the story of the studio through the era of heavy campaigning and scoring nominations for Cider House Rules and Chocolat, of the nasty race against A Beautiful Mind and of the big triumph in 2002 with Chicago winning it all even though Gangs didn’t win anything.\n\nBut then came the real changes as the book was being published. Cold Mountain was pushed heavily but fell short at the Oscars. The Aviator cost a lot and couldn’t win Best Picture. Miramax was buying less and producing more expensive films. The films were bigger but there were far fewer. In 2004, Miramax would release just 14 films, its fewest since 1989. They would have their highest box office average ($30 million) but higher costs. So in the spring of 2005 came the announcement of the long-rumored split, that the Weinsteins would leave behind the company they had founded, letting Disney keep the name while they would depart and form their own indie studio yet again.\n\nDisney would never really have the proper handle on how to run Miramax without the Weinsteins. They would have some Oscar gold, yes, winning a fourth Best Picture for the studio with No Country for Old Men. But that and The Queen (more Oscar gold) would be the only post-Weinstein films to make over $50 million and the entire slate of 37 films released between the departure and the ending of the label in late 2010 would make less than the films released in 2004 alone.\n\nAnd now suddenly the Weinsteins had their own studio again. Their first release, Derailed, would show the mixed results. It would make $36 million, more than all but two post-Weinstein releases at Disney and more than the first 75 films released by Miramax but also a little bit less than The Brothers Grimm, the last Miramax film released while the brothers were still there. It would also be terrible.\n\nDimension went with them, so they had genre films to make money while they tried to find the path to Oscar gold again. But they weren’t finding the way. Bobby and The Great Debaters found Globe nominations but the Oscars ignored them. The second was particularly painful as Miramax won Best Picture that year without them. Finally in 2008, The Reader broke through, snagging Oscar nominations out from under the feet of The Dark Knight. Then came QT to the rescue again.\n\nInglourious Basterds was the best film the studio had made to-date. It was also a big Oscar contender, the first TWC film to break $100 million (just as Pulp Fiction had been the first Miramax film to do so) and the first non-Dimension film to even break $60 million. The brothers had found their place again. The following year would come The King’s Speech, a surprise smash (the second biggest grossing film in the studio’s history) and a surprise winner over the clear critics favorite The Social Network at the Oscars. They followed that up the next year by winning Best Picture again with The Artist.\n\nBut the brothers weren’t riding a wave higher and higher – they had peaked. The next year brought more financial success (Silver Linings, Django) with high grosses and major Oscar gold but not Picture or Director. After that, there would only be one more $100 million film and the main reason they were getting into the Oscar race was because of the expanded Picture category, only scoring three more Picture nominations and one more Director nomination. The grosses were going down, the quality of the films were slipping and they no longer had a magic touch with the Academy. The studio was floundering and then came the lawsuits. The studio and all its assets were put up for sale. What had once, in a lot of ways, been the most powerful force in the film industry, was over.\n\nNotable Miramax Films\n\nRockshow (1980) – Paul McCartney concert film; first Miramax release\n\nI’ve Heard the Mermaids Singing (1987) – first Miramax film submitted for the Oscars\n\nThe Thin Blue Line (1988) – major documentary that earned a lot of publicity\n\nPelle the Conqueror (1988) – first Miramax Oscar nominee; first Oscar winner (Foreign Film)\n\nsex, lies and videotape (1989) – first Miramax film to gross over $20 million\n\nMy Left Foot (1989) – first Miramax film nominated for Best Picture\n\nReservoir Dogs (1992) – beginning of Quentin Tarantino’s relationship with Miramax\n\nHellraiser III: Hell on Earth (1992) – first film produced by Dimension, Miramax’s genre subdivision\n\nThe Crying Game (1992) – second Miramax Best Picture nominee; first film from Miramax to gross over $25 million; first independent film from any studio to gross over $60 million\n\nPulp Fiction (1994) – first Miramax film (or independent film from any studio) to gross over $100 million\n\nIl Postino (1995) – first Foreign film from any studio to be nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars in 26 years\n\nThe English Patient (1996) – first Best Picture winner for Miramax\n\nGood Will Hunting (1997) – first Miramax film to gross over $125 million\n\nShakespeare in Love (1998) – second Best Picture winner for Miramax\n\nScary Movie (2000) – first Miramax film to gross over $150 million\n\nChicago (2002) – third Best Picture winner; highest grossing film in Miramax’s history\n\nThe Brothers Grimm (2005) – final film released with the Weinsteins still in charge of Miramax\n\nThe Queen (2006) – first Miramax nominee for Best Picture post-Weinsteins\n\nNo Country for Old Men (2007) – fourth and final Best Picture winner\n\nThe Tempest (2010) – final Miramax Oscar submission and for all intents and purposes the final Miramax film\n\nNotable TWC Films\n\nDerailed (2005) – first TWC release\n\nThe Reader (2008) – first TWC Best Picture nominee\n\nIngloruious Basterds (2009) – first Tarantino film for TWC; first TWC film to gross over $100 million\n\nThe King’s Speech (2010) – first Best Picture winner for TWC; second highest grossing TWC film\n\nThe Artist (2011) – second Best Picture winner for TWC, giving TWC back-to-back winners, something Miramax never did\n\nDjango Unchained (2012) – highest grossing TWC film\n\nLion (2016) – final TWC film to earn a Best Picture nomination\n\nTulip Fever (2017) – final TWC release\n\nThe Directors\n\nHarvey Weinstein famously pissed off a lot of directors who then refused to ever go back to Miramax. Biskind’s book makes quite clear why Steven Soderbergh (who did make two more films for them) and Neil Jordan (who didn’t make any) came to loathe him. But other directors had a good working relationship with him and made several films at the studio, even moving from Miramax to TWC.\n\nQuentin Tarantino\n\nFilms: 9\n\nYears: 1994-2015\n\nAverage Film: 89.7\n\nBest Film: Pulp Fiction\n\nWorst Film: Death Proof\n\nTarantino’s Reservoir Dogs was an art-house hit but Pulp Fiction helped Miramax become the company that could make big box office and win major Oscars. Tarantino stayed on, often arguing (he refused to cut Jackie Brown) but also making brilliant films. He jumped to TWC and might still be there if it hadn’t disintegrated.\n\nKevin Smith\n\nFilms: 6\n\nYears: 1994 – 2008\n\nAverage Film: 73.8\n\nBest Film: Clerks\n\nWorst Film: Jersey Girl\n\nSmith’s Clerks was bought by Miramax and was a big cult hit. Smith left and came back (“After the failure of Mallrats, Smith famously called Harvey and said, ‘Can I come home now?'” Biskind, p 285) and then stayed through Zack and Miri before he started making really bad films. Dogma, however, wouldn’t be released by Miramax (see pages 344-346 and 366-67 of Biskind) and the Weinsteins own the film rights so you can’t get it on streaming so I guess I should hold on to my DVD.\n\nWoody Allen\n\nFilms: 6\n\nYears: 1994 – 2008\n\nAverage Film: 74.5\n\nBest Film: Bullets over Broadway\n\nWorst Film: Celebrity\n\nIf you line up all the Oscar nominated directors and sort their films by years, it’s interesting to look at the studios, especially after 1960. Yes, some modern directors, like Eastwood, stay with the same studio for their careers. Others, like Scorsese, jump all around and rarely even make two films in a row for the same studio. Then there is Woody Allen, who would make several films with a studio, then move to a new, more hip studio. He joined up with Miramax in 1994 for the first of four films and then later two more with TWC. In that time, his films won three Oscars just for Supporting Actress (Wiest, Sorvino, Cruz). Most directors are happy to have their films win three acting Oscars ever. What’s more, in Bullets, Everyone Says I Love You and Vicky Cristina Barcelona, we have three of his strongest post-1990 films.\n\nStephen Frears\n\nFilms: 8\n\nYears: 1990 – 2013\n\nAverage Film: 79.9\n\nBest Film: The Grifters\n\nWorst Film: Lay the Favorite\n\nFrears is often over-looked and could easily be here as well. He’s the only director aside from Marty and Quentin with two films in the studio’s Top 15. He directed two Best Picture nominees (The Queen, Philomena) earned another nomination for Director (The Grifters) and had two more films earn major Oscar noms (Dirty Pretty Things, Mrs Henderson Presents). If not for the awful Lay the Favorite, his studio average would be 86.4.\n\nRobert Rodriguez\n\nFilms: 11\n\nYears: 1995 – 2014\n\nAverage Film: 59.4\n\nBest Film: Sin City\n\nWorst Film: The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl\n\nRodriguez was brought in to Miramax as part of the four directors on Four Rooms then re-teamed with Tarantino directing his script for From Dusk Till Dawn. Starting with that, he became Dimension’s resident auteur, with most of his films from then until the dissolution of TWC released by the genre division of Miramax / TWC. No other director made more films for the Weinsteins.\n\nThe Stars\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\n\nYes, she has clearly become a crazy person of Tom Cruise proportions. And lots of people don’t feel she should have won the Oscar. But, aside from a lot of crap that Emma did for the studio (The Pallbearer, View from the Top), all of her best performances came in films from Miramax and they are really worth remembering and watching.\n\nEssential Viewing: Shakespeare in Love, Proof, Emma, Sliding Doors\n\nBen Affleck\n\n“It’s Miramax. So I’m sure it’ll be Ben Affleck and Matt Damon. They put those guys in a bunch of movies.” Ben Affleck in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. It actually started with Chasing Amy before Good Will Hunting. But Hunting made him and Damon household names and Affleck was then in Shakespeare in Love as well as many of Kevin Smith’s subsequent films. It’s interesting to note that Affleck’s directorial debut, Gone Baby Gone, was made for post-Weinstein Miramax.\n\nEssential Viewing: Good Will Hunting, Chasing Amy, Shakespeare in Love\n\nRenee Zellweger\n\nShe didn’t do much at Miramax but it’s hard to ignore the fact that Zellweger made three films in three years with the studio, all three earned her Oscar noms, the second not only won Best Picture but was the highest grossing film in either studio’s history and the third film won her the Oscar. That’s kind of the definition of a star right there.\n\nEssential Viewing: Chicago, Bridget Jones’ Diary, Cold Mountain\n\nGenres\n\nAs can be seen by the lists below, the two studios did eventually cover all the genres. But they mostly focused on Comedies and Dramas. A lot of their genre films would be released by Dimension Films, the sub-studio for both studios. It’s interesting to note that Quentin Tarantino made the best film in two genres at Miramax and then made the best film in two completely different other genres at TWC. One thing of note is that Miramax made a lot of really great Crime films while TWC made very few Crime films at all and none worthy of noting. TWC just didn’t do the genres as well as Miramax had.\n\nForeign Films\n\nMiramax did a lot of their early business by distributing foreign films in the States. Their first Oscar nomination (and win) was Best Foreign Film in 1988 for Pelle the Conqueror. They followed that up with three more wins (Cinema Paradiso, Journey of Hope, Mediterraneo), an unprecedented run of success in any category. Miramax was incredibly successful, winning eight Oscars and earning another 17 nominations. TWC didn’t focus on that in the same way and earned just two nominations. Two more TWC films were semi-finalists. There were also 22 films that Miramax distributed that were submitted that weren’t nominated (and one TWC). What’s more, Miramax had a wide array. They won the Oscar with six different countries (three for Italy) and earned nominations for 13 more. In all, Miramax submitted films from at last 25 different countries including 8 from Italy and 6 from France.\n\nAll of the films, ranked\n\nnote: This list consists of all the films I considered for the various categories below. Because colors tend to get thrown off when I apply links, the TWC films are in bold. I don’t note the Dimension films separately from either studio nor do I specify other branches such as Miramax Zoe or TWC-RADiUS. This list is every film (except documentaries) released by either Miramax or TWC according to the lists I could find (BOM, Wikipedia, Academy records). The two exceptions are Strike It Rich, the 1990 adaptation of a Graham Greene novel which kills me that I can’t find it and The Crude Oasis, which isn’t listed at BOM but is the only film ever submitted to the Oscars by Miramax that I haven’t seen. Those are the only two Miramax films I haven’t seen. I’ve seen all the TWC films.\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nTrainspotting\n\nThe Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain\n\nThe English Patient\n\nThe Aviator\n\nNo Country for Old Men\n\nThe Crying Game\n\nGangs of

The films are listed in alphabetical order. Unless I have something specific to say, I don’t mention films that have full reviews elsewhere or films that I saw in the theater from 1989 to 2005 (they are all mentioned in those Nighthawk Awards) or films listed already in the Adapted Screenplay project (through 2002).\n\n54 – One of the most infamous examples of Weinstein butchering a film. I will admit that my rating of low ** is based on the original theatrical version and I haven’t seen the later director’s cut that restored much of the homosexuality in the film.\n\nAccidental Love – Talk about famous butchering. I use this title (instead of the original Nailed) and I list Stephen Greene (the pseudonym David O. Russell used on the released film) and don’t count it as a Russell film at all.\n\nBegin Again – Absolutely should have been released under the original title (Love is an Unfinished Song). Ironic that the Academy got Adam Levine to sing at the Oscars when the whole point is that he ruins the authenticity of the songs in the film.\n\nBobby – The TWC Oscar hope for 2006. Far from a great film but the last few minutes are magnificent and the speech that it makes use of has provided my e-mail signature for well over a decade now and they words well worth remembering: “But we can perhaps remember – even if only for a time – that those who live with us are our brothers, that they share with us the same short movement of life, that they seek – as we do – nothing but the chance to live out their lives in purpose and happiness, winning what satisfaction and fulfillment they can.” Robert Kennedy April 5, 1968\n\nCoriolanus – I have this as a 75, the highest a film can earn without being considered for my Best Picture lists. The studios actually released several Shakespeare films (five plus two more that are quasi). This one is also nice because it’s such a lesser known play.\n\nDeath Proof – I just want to mention my low (**.5) opinion of this so people will realize that I don’t think everything QT does is brilliant. Just almost everything.\n\nThe Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby: Them – I actually watched all three versions but I only list this one. One of the most under-rated films that TWC ever released.\n\nEagle vs. Shark – Another film I don’t like from a director I do, in this case Taika Waititi. I had heard this was like Napoleon Dynamite and that was correct but I hated Napoleon Dynamite. This film brings Waititi’s average film down seven points.\n\nFanboys – A very good example of a guilty pleasure. A fun film that we’ve seen three times because it totally embraces a big part of our lives.\n\nFour Rooms – Proof before Death Proof that QT wasn’t perfect. A terrible, terrible anthology film. In anthology films, I usually only list one director and for this one I list Robert Rodriguez which isn’t really fair since his segment is the only good one.\n\nHellraiser III: Hell on Earth / Highlander III: The Final Dimension – Before you get too up in arms over how much I thought the third and fourth films in these franchises (of which the first two, in each case, was released by a different studio before Dimension took on the third and fourth installments) sucked, you should also know that I think the originals suck.\n\nHero – The release of this brilliant Zhang Yimou Action film is somewhat inexplicable. It scored an Oscar nomination in 2002 but then Miramax kept delaying a U.S. release. It lollygagged so long that Zhang Yimou’s even more brilliant Action follow-up, House of Flying Daggers, was already out and getting rave reviews in Asia before this got a U.S. release. Finally, Disney pushed Miramax to release it and QT even added his name to the poster to get people to see it. Miramax did the opposite of their normal release strategy and dumped it wide, but it managed to score the third best opening for a non-Dimension film in the studio’s history ($18 million) and went on to gross $53 million in the States to become what is still, 16 years later, the third highest grossing Foreign language release (though Parasite would have likely caught it if not for COVID as it ended up just a few hundred thousand short of it). That release actually scored Hero some critics awards (that it shared with House).\n\nHoodwinked – Not a bad film but it infuriated me that people compared it to Rashomon. Those people either didn’t watch or didn’t understand Rashomon. The story in this film is that you don’t know the whole story and each layer, told from a different perspective, adds to the last one and allows you to see the whole story. But the whole point of Rashomon is that truth is different and subjective and that you can never get to the real truth.\n\nHorns – After making the worst film in TWC’s history, Alexandre Aja followed it up with this Horror-Comedy from the interesting book by Joe Hill (Stephen King’s son). Flawed, yes, but also interesting and deserved better reviews (which were not good) and better box office (which was terrible). Also was one of the first films to show that Daniel Radcliffe was not just going to sit on his Harry Potter laurels but was looking for interesting work.\n\nKilling Them Softly – Critics really over-rated this film which I didn’t find that surprising given that critics also really over-rated the previous Andrew Dominik directed film that starred Brad Pitt (Assassination of Jesse James).\n\nLove Serenade – One of the films I tracked down in the wake of Lord of the Rings, looking to find the Kiwi / Aussie actors who I hadn’t been familiar with. Miranda Otto is funny and very plain and the complete opposite of her role as Eowyn in a bizarre but winning Comedy.\n\nMacbeth – I am convinced a great film can be made of this play, one of Shakespeare’s best, but it still hasn’t happened. This has great casting (Fassbender, Cotillard) but was just a mess.\n\nThe Nanny Diaries – I paused this film in a scene where Scarlett Johansson’s pants have been pulled down and she is bending over and called Veronica into the room. “I’ve already seen her in her underwear thanks to Lost in Translation,” she replied. “Wait for it,” I said and then the cute next door neighbor meets her and I said “Black Widow, meet Captain America.”\n\nNext Stop Wonderland – Ugh, the Blue Line. I lived in Boston for 13 years and only once went out to Wonderland station, just to say I had ridden the whole length of the Blue Line. But Hope Davis is good.\n\nPelle the Conquerer – I probably should watch this again. At the time, I think it’s likely I hadn’t seen a single Bergman film.\n\nPhantoms – “Affleck was the bomb in Phantoms.” Ben Affleck in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Good he has a sense of humor about a film that was just terrible.\n\nSin City: A Dame to Kill For – I think I saw this the same day I saw the 300 sequel and both of them only have one good thing – a good nude sex scene with Eva Green. Everything else about the two films sucked.\n\nSing Street – I have not done the research on this but I’m willing to bet it had been quite a while since a Golden Globe Best Picture nominee had earned less than $5 million. This little film that could (and did) was from John Carney, so I should have expected a great soundtrack. But this film was already streaming on Netflix when the Globe noms came out and I saw it and then had Veronica watch it and she loved it so much I got her the soundtrack for Christmas. She especially loved the line “No woman can truly love a man who listens to Phil Collins,” although she does truly love a man who listens to Phil Collins.\n\nThe Tempest – Miramax has done Shakespeare really wrong (Hamlet) but they have also done it really right in this, certainly one of the most under-rated Shakespeare film adaptations.\n\nWind River – A number of Avengers have given really good performances in Miramax or TWC films and a couple of final ones come here, in TWC’s last great film, with solid performances from Jeremy Renner and Elizabeth Olsen.\n\nThe Best Miramax / TWC Films by Decade\n\n1980’s: My Left Foot\n\n1990’s: Pulp Fiction\n\n2000’s: The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain\n\n2010’s: Carol\n\nThe Best Miramax Films by Genre\n\nAction: Kill Bill Volume 1\n\nAdventure: The Warrior\n\nComedy: The Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain\n\nCrime: Pulp Fiction\n\nDrama: The English Patient\n\nFantasy: Heavenly Creatures\n\nHorror: Trainspotting\n\nKids: n/a\n\nMusical: Chicago\n\nMystery: Gone Baby Gone\n\nSci-Fi: Existenz\n\nSuspense: The Crying Game\n\nWar: The Quiet American\n\nWestern: none\n\nnote: Films listed with n/a mean that no Miramax film in that genre met my threshold (***.5).\n\nThe Best TWC Films by Genre\n\nAction: n/a\n\nAdventure: n/a\n\nComedy: The Artist\n\nCrime: n/a\n\nDrama: Carol\n\nFantasy: n/a\n\nHorror: n/a\n\nKids: Paddington\n\nMusical: I’m Not There\n\nMystery: Wind River\n\nSci-Fi: Snowpiercer\n\nSuspense: n/a\n\nWar: Inglourious Basterds\n\nWestern: Django Unchained\n\nnote: Films listed with n/a mean that no TWC film in that genre met my threshold (***.5).\n\nThe Worst Miramax Films by Genre\n\nAction: Underclassmen\n\nAdventure: n/a\n\nComedy: Scary Movie 3\n\nCrime: Reindeer Games\n\nDrama: Hamlet\n\nFantasy: Highlander: Endgame\n\nHorror: Cursed\n\nKids: Pinocchio\n\nMusical: Johnny Suede\n\nMystery: Deception\n\nSci-Fi: Spaced Out\n\nSuspense: Stepfather II\n\nWar: n/a\n\nWestern: Texas Rangers\n\nnote: Films listed with n/a mean that no Miramax film in that genre met my threshold (** or below).\n\nThe Worst TWC Films by Genre\n\nAction: DOA: Dead or Alive\n\nAdventure: The Last Legion\n\nComedy: Superhero Movie\n\nCrime: Only God Forgives\n\nDrama: Dirty Girl\n\nFantasy: Solomon Kane\n\nHorror: Piranha 3DD\n\nKids: Doogal\n\nMusical: n/a\n\nMystery: n/a\n\nSci-Fi: The Giver\n\nSuspense: Derailed\n\nWar: n/a\n\nWestern: n/a\n\nnote: Films listed with n/a mean that no TWC film in that genre met my threshold (** or below).\n\nThe Statistics\n\nTotal Films 1912-2020: 597 (11th)\n\nTotal Films (Miramax only): 417 (11th)\n\nTotal Films (TWC only): 180 (16th)\n\nTotal Percentage of All Films, 1912-2020: 2.47%\n\nTotal Percentage of All Films, 1983-2017: 5.15%\n\nDecade Totals:\n\n1983-1989: 18 (0.95%) (23rd)\n\n1990-1999: 240 (7.90%) (1st)\n\n2000-2009: 219 (5.83%) (2nd)\n\n2010-2017: 120 (4.15%) (8th)\n\nBiggest Years:\n\n1998: 34\n\n1995, 1996: 31\n\n1999: 29\n\n2002, 2005: 28\n\n2013, 2014: 22 (biggest TWC year)\n\nBiggest Years by Percentage of All Films:\n\n1998: 10.46%\n\n1995: 10.26%\n\n1996: 9.90%\n\n1999: 8.81%\n\n2001: 7.99%\n\nBest Year:\n\n1994: 5 Top 10, 8 Top 20\n\n1996: 2 Top 10, 6 Top 20\n\nAverage Film By Decade:\n\n1983-1989: 56.00\n\n1990-1999: 62.32\n\n2000-2009: 57.40\n\n2010-2017: 55.62\n\nTOTAL: 58.98\n\nTOTAL – Miramax: 61.16\n\nTOTAL – TWC: 53.97\n\nnote: This is considerably higher than the overall average during the same period (54.21).

There were four different years where Miramax released double-digit numbers of films and had averages over 10 points higher than the average for all films, peaking in 1997 when the Miramax average was an astonishing 16.99 points higher than the overall average.\n\nnote: I will also point out that Miramax never once had the worst film of the year.

In total, including the winners, there are 19 Nighthawk nominees, five of which are TWC films. That includes a whopping seven second place finishers: Crying Game, Pulp Fiction, Trainspotting, Shakespeare in Love, Amelie, Gangs, The Artist. Pulp Fiction adds a Drama win with Trainspotting, Jackie Brown, Amelie, Chicago and The Artist winning in Comedy. In total, including winners, there are 17 Drama noms and 15 Comedy noms.\n\nMiramax would win three Oscars with the Weinsteins (English Patient, Shakespeare, Chicago), one without them (No Country) and then TWC would win back-to-back Oscars for King’s Speech and The Artist. In total, Miramax would score 18 Oscar nominations (two without the Weinsteins) with a whopping 15 of them from 1992-2004 with one every year except 2003. In an era of just five nominees per year, they managed two in 1998, 2002 and 2004. In nine years, TWC would add another nine nominations.\n\nMiramax would win Drama at the Globes just twice (English Patient, Aviator) among 12 total noms with TWC adding 10 noms but no wins. In Comedy, Miramax would win twice (Shakespeare, Chicago) out of nine noms while TWC would also win twice (Vicky Cristina Barcelona, Artist) among eight noms.\n\nMiramax would win four BAFTAs (English Patient, Shakespeare, Aviator, Queen) while TWC would win twice (King’s Speech, Artist). Miramax would have another 13 noms while TWC would have another four. King’s Speech also won British Film and Picture nominees Crying Game and East is East would also win British Film. The Warrior would add British Film without a Picture nom and in total, between Miramax and TWC, there would be 23 total nominees in the category, although many of them wouldn’t be released by Miramax in Britain.\n\nChicago, No Country and The Artist would win the BFCA with a whopping 25 other nominees in just over 20 years including three in 2012.\n\nMiramax would win the PGA five times (Crying Game, English Patient, Chicago, Aviator, No Country) with King’s Speech and Artist adding two more for TWC. In total, including winners, the two studios would combine for 25 nominations.\n\nPulp Fiction would win four critics awards as would No Country. The Artist would win two more. Surprisingly, outside of that, it’s pretty thin with just five awards spread among five films (My Left Foot, Trainspotting, In the Bedroom, Finding Neverland, Carol). In looking at the way the Weinsteins played the awards game, it’s worth noting that the five films that won Best Picture at the Oscars under the Weinsteins hands, only The Artist managed a critics win for Best Picture. It’s worth noting as well that Miramax has the top two (The Piano, The Queen) and four of the top six (adding Happy-Go-Lucky and The Master) films in points at the critics awards without a Picture win.\n\nBest Director\n\nQuentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction)\n\nAnthony Minghella (The English Patient)\n\nMartin Scorsese (The Aviator)\n\nMartin Scorsese (Gangs of New York)\n\nDanny Boyle (Trainspotting)\n\nAnalysis: Minghella and Scorsese (Aviator) win the Nighthawk as do the Coens (No Country), Quentin (but for Basterds) and Todd Haynes (Carol). The other three in my Top 5 all earn Nighthawk noms as do ten other directors (including Quentin two other times). Quentin adds a Drama win for Pulp while Comedy wins are added for Quentin (Jackie Brown), Jean-Pierre Jeunet (Amelie), Rob Marshall (Chicago), Mike Leigh (Happy-Go-Lucky) and Michel Hazanavicius (The Artist). In total, including winners, there are 18 Drama noms and 17 Comedy noms.\n\nDirector was the weak link for the Weinsteins, only winning once of their three Miramax Best Picture wins (English Patient), though the Coens won a second for Miramax after they left and the two Best Picture winners at TWC both won the Oscar. But Miramax did manage five Director nominations without corresponding Picture noms, which meant in 1994, they had one Picture nominee but three of the five Director noms. In total, including winners, the studios combined for 26 Oscar noms.\n\nMarty would be the only Weinstein Globe winner (for Gangs) though Diving Bell and the Butterfly would be a post-Weinstein Miramax win. In addition, 10 Miramax films and 6 TWC films earned noms, three of which were Quentin. It’s similar at the BAFTAs with Il Postino the only Weinstein win at Miramax, the Coens adding a post win and The Artist adding a TWC win. There are, including winners, 22 nominees. Minghella, Marty (Aviator), the Coens and Hazanavicius would win the BFCA with eight other nominees, split between the two studios.\n\nMiramax would do better at the DGA, with wins for Minghella, Marshall, the Coens, Tom Hooper (King’s Speech) and Hazanavicius. Another 16 films would earn DGA noms with only the last three being TWC films.\n\nTarantino would set a new record by sweeping all six Director awards in 1994. Todd Haynes would add three awards for Carol while two awards each would go to Jane Campion (The Piano), the Coens and Mike Leigh. Seven other films would win one award each though two of them were the same award in the same year for the same director who directed two Miramax films (Phillip Noyce in 2002 for Quiet American and Rabbit-Proof Fence).\n\nBest Adapted Screenplay:\n\nTrainspotting\n\nThe English Patient\n\nNo Country for Old Men\n\nCarol\n\nIn the Bedroom\n\nAnalysis: Trainspotting, No Country, The Imitation Game and Carol win the Nighthawk (English Patient loses to Trainspotting). Another 12 films earn nominations. English Patient does win the Drama award while The Snapper, Jackie Brown, My Week with Marilyn and Silver Linings Playbook add Comedy wins. Including winners there are 15 Drama noms and 17 Comedy noms.\n\nFour films win the Oscar including Sling Blade, one of the worst choices in the category’s history (as well as Cider House Rules, No Country and Imitation Game). Miramax earns 15 other nominations (two post-Weinstein) including two of the films that Sling Blade somehow beat (Trainspotting, English Patient). TWC adds five more nominations.\n\nNo Country is the only adapted script to win the Globe. Of the 18 Globe nominees, 10 of them are adapted. Six films win the BAFTA: Trainspotting, English Patient (different BAFTA eligibility), Diving Bell and the Butterfly (post-Weinstein Miramax), Silver Linings Playbook, Philomena, Lion (the last three all TWC). Also, 14 Miramax films and 4 TWC films earn noms. English Patient and Confessions of a Dangerous Mind win the BFCA with nine other noms.\n\nSling Blade, No Country and Imitation Game win the WGA. Fourteen other Miramax films earn noms (including three that lose to Sling Blade – adding Emma to the mix) and three other TWC do as well.\n\nNo Country wins three critics awards, the only adapted film to win more than one. Nine films do win a single award each.\n\nBest Original Screenplay:\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nThe Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain\n\nThe Crying Game\n\nShakespeare in Love\n\nInglourious Basterds\n\nAnalysis: All of my Top 5 win the Nighthawk. There are also 18 other nominees, three more of which are Tarantino films. The Aviator and Django win Drama awards (giving Tarantino four total genre wins among the two writing categories). In total, including winners, there are 25 Drama noms and 15 Comedy noms. Tarantino earns seven total genre noms.\n\nMiramax wins three Oscars in a row from 92-94 and then adds two more in 97 and 98 while TWC adds King’s Speech and Django. Miramax adds 13 more with two more for TWC. Miramax has three of the five nominees in 1994.\n\nTarantino wins the first Globe for Miramax in 94 and the only one for TWC in 2012. In between three other original scripts win the Globe (Good Will Hunting, Shakespeare in Love, The Queen). There are also 8 Globe nominees that are original. Tarantino earns the first Globe nomination for an original for TWC (The Reader had done it for adapted) and the last Globe nomination at all for Hateful Eight.\n\nMiramax does well at the BAFTAs, winning for Cinema Paradiso, Pulp Fiction, Amelie and Station Agent before adding wins for King’s Speech, Artist and Django (all in a row) with TWC. There are also 17 Miramax noms and 4 TWC noms. Good Will Hunting, Shakespeare in Love, Basterds, King’s Speech and Django win the BFCA with noms for five other films.\n\nA key writer is missing at the WGA with Tarantino not eligible. Still, Crying Game and Piano win back-to-back and Shakespeare adds a third win. There are also 12 other Miramax nominees and 2 TWC noms.\n\nPulp Fiction sweep the critics awards (it wins five when the NBR didn’t have the category), The Queen wins four, The Piano wins three, three films add two (Crying Game, Shakespeare in Love, Happy-Go-Lucky) while The Artist and Hateful Eight are the only original scripts to win one award each.\n\nBest Actor:\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis (My Left Foot)\n\nDaniel Day-Lewis (Gangs of New York)\n\nRalph Fiennes (The English Patient)\n\nTom Wilkinson (In the Bedroom)\n\nLeonardo DiCaprio (The Aviator)\n\nAnalysis: For both Actor and Actress, I had four perfect 9 performances and then had to pick from a myriad of performances I rank at an 8 and it was very difficult. All five of these performances win the Nighthawk as does Colin Firth (King’s Speech). There are actually only nine other nominees which honestly seems kind of low. Benedict (Imitation Game) adds a Drama win and Ewan (Trainspotting) and Jean Dujardin (The Artist) score Comedy wins. In total, including winners, there are 15 Drama nominees and 12 Comedy nominees.\n\nDay-Lewis (My Left Foot), Roberto Benigni, Firth and Dujardin won the Oscar. There were also 18 other nominees including Max Von Sydow (Pelle the Conqueror), who earned his first Oscar nomination as well as the studio’s first nomination. Two of the winners and four of the nominees were TWC films.\n\nThere would be two Drama winners at the Globes (Leo, Firth) and three Comedy winners (Michael Caine (Little Voice), Richard Gere (Chicago), Dujardin). In total, including winners, there would be 17 Drama nominees and 14 Comedy nominees.\n\nMiramax would win big at the BAFTAs with seven winners over the years as well as 19 other nominees including all four of the losing nominees in 2001. Day-Lewis (Gangs) and Firth would win the BFCA with nine other actors earning noms, most from TWC, given the time period. After earning six nominations in the preceding four years, Roberto Benigni became the first Miramax actor to win SAG, followed by Day-Lewis (Gangs), Firth and Dujardin. Including winners, Miramax earned 15 noms and TWC earned six.\n\nDay-Lewis dominates with four critics wins for My Left Foot and three more for Gangs. Firth also earned three critics wins. Six other performances (two from TWC) managed a single critics win each.\n\nBest Actress\n\nHelen Mirren (The Queen)\n\nCate Blanchett (Carol)\n\nHolly Hunter (The Piano)\n\nSissy Spacek (In the Bedroom)\n\nAnjelica Huston (The Grifters)\n\nAnalysis: Hunter doesn’t win the Nighthawk but the other four do as do Gwyneth (Proof) and Michelle Williams (My Week with Marilyn). There are also a whopping 25 other nominees including three in 2008. The studio scores 12 nominations each in the 90s and 00s. Meryl adds a Drama win (Iron Lady) with Comedy wins for Lina Stolze (Nasty Girl), Gwyneth (Shakespeare), Audrey Tautou (Amelie), Renee Zellweger (Chicago), Sally Hawkins (Happy-Go-Lucky), Jennifer Lawrence (Silver Linings Playbook) and Amy Adams (Big Eyes). In total, including winners, there are 28 Drama nominees and 25 Comedy nominees.\n\nMiramax would win three Oscars (Hunter, Gwyneth, Mirren) then TWC would add three more (Kate Winslet (Reader), Meryl, Lawrence). Including winners there would be 29 nominees in the course of 26 years including seven years with two nominees and one (2001) with three. 2003-04 were the only back-to-back years without an Oscar nomination from 1990 to 2015.\n\nThe studio would romp at the Globes with six Drama winners and seven Comedy winners and a total of 27 Drama nominees and 22 Comedy nominees. Surprisingly, given that, it would take until 2011 for the studio to win both awards in the same year (Meryl, Williams).\n\nSix actresses would win the BAFTA (Hunter, Judi Dench (Mrs Brown and Iris), Mirren, Winslet, Meryl) while another 25 would earn nominations. From 1992 to 2005, Miramax earned 21 nominations, won three awards, was nominated every year except one (1995) and earned four noms in 2001 alone (including the winner). Helena Bonham-Carter (Wings of the Dove), Spacek, Mirren and Meryl (Doubt) would win the BFCA with 14 other performances (mostly from TWC) earning noms.\n\nIn the first two years of SAG (94-95), Miramax earned no noms. Then it earned three in 96 and four in 97 before winning the award with Gwyneth (and earning another nom) in 98. After that, Zellweger, Mirren, Meryl and Lawrence would also win. In total, including wins, Miramax would earn 19 noms (in just nine years) while TWC would earn 9 (in eleven years).\n\nHolly Hunter would sweep all six critics awards in 1993 and then Mirren would do it again in 2006. Sally Hawkins would win four, Huston, Bonham-Carter and Marion Cotillard (for The Immigrant, although shared with a non-TWC film) would win three, Spacek and Williams would win two each and eight other actresses would win one each. That’s a total of 37 awards spread across 16 performances.\n\nBest Supporting Actor:\n\nChristoph Waltz (Inglourious Basterds)\n\nMichael Sheen (The Queen)\n\nSamuel L. Jackson (Pulp Fiction)\n\nTommy Lee Jones (No Country for Old Men)\n\nJavier Bardem (No Country for Old Men)\n\nAnalysis: This is the only category in which the all-time studio winner is from a TWC film. Surprisingly, in spite of their awards success, only Waltz and Sheen win the Nighthawk (as does Waltz again for Django Unchained and Dev Patel in Lion). The other three earn Nighthawks as do 16 other performances with a lot that were contenders for the Top 5 (Jaye Davidson in Crying Game, Robert Forster in Jackie Brown, Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting). Jackson adds a Drama win and Forster, Bob Hoskins (Mrs Henderson Presents) and Robert De Niro (Silver Linings Playbook) add Comedy wins. In total there are 19 Drama noms and 14 Comedy noms.\n\nThere are six Oscar winners, four from Miramax (one post-Weinstein) and two from TWC: Williams, Michael Caine (Cider House Rules), Jim Bonneville (Iris), Bardem, Waltz (twice). There are also another 13 noms (five of which are TWC).\n\nBonneville, Bardem and Waltz (twice) also won Globes in addition to 8 more Miramax nominees and 6 TWC noms.\n\nThis was the first big category for Miramax at the BAFTAs. Its first award was in 1989 for Ray McNally (My Left Foot) and then again in 1990 (Salvatore Cascio for Cinema Paradiso). There would be three more Miramax wins (Jackson, Geoffrey Rush (Shakespeare in Love), Bardem) and four for TWC (Waltz twice, Rush again (King’s Speech), Patel) as well as second nominations for Shakespeare (Tom Wilkinson) and No Country (Jones) plus nine more for Miramax and three more for TWC.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix would win the BFCA in 2000 (for The Yards among other performances) followed by Bardem, Waltz and Hoffman with three more Miramax noms and four TWC noms. Williams, Caine, Bardem and Waltz would all win SAG with 14 more noms (nine for Miramax, five for TWC).\n\nWaltz would dominate with five critics awards. Edward Norton would win three for Everyone Says I Love You (but also for other, more powerful performances that year) and Bardem would win three. Bonneville would add two. Six other actors would add one each (three for a TWC film including two different performances in 2012).\n\nBest Supporting Actress:\n\nDianne Wiest (Bullets over Broadway)\n\nCate Blanchett (The Aviator)\n\nRooney Mara (Carol)\n\nJulia Roberts (August: Osage County)\n\nCate Blanchett (I’m Not There)\n\nAnalysis: When your Top 5 has no room for Oscar winners like Brenda Fricker (My Left Foot), Anna Paquin (The Piano), Juliette Binoche (The English Patient) and Penelope Cruz (Vicky Cristina Barcelona) you know the category is stacked. And it is massively stacked – the best category Miramax has. It wins nine Nighthawks in just over 25 years (Fricker, Miranda Richardson (Crying Game), Wiest, Judi Dench (Shakespeare in Love), Blanchett (both times), Cruz, Roberts, Mara), the last four from TWC. There are also 22 more nominations (including two for Chicago). From 1989 to 1996 alone the studio had three wins and 12 total nominations. And it didn’t fade as TWC earned at least one nomination every year from 2007 to 2015. Between the two it also managed seven Drama wins (Fricker, Richardson, Uma Thurman (Pulp Fiction), Marisa Tomei (In the Bedroom), Blanchett (Aviator), Keira Knightley (Imitation Game), Mara) and 18 more nominations (including two for Doubt) and a whopping nine Comedy wins including four in five years from 1994-98 and five in six years from 07-113 There are also 15 additional Comedy noms.\n\nMiramax dominated in this category at the Oscars. After an initial win in 1989 (Fricker), came four in a row from 93-96 (Paquin, Wiest, Mira Sorvino (Mighty Aphrodite), Binoche), again in 98 (Dench), then three in a row from 2002-04 (Catherine Zeta-Jones (Chicago), Renee Zellweger (Cold Mountain), Blanchett) before a TWC win in 2008 for Cruz. All that, plus there were second noms for Bullets and Chicago and two for Doubt. Miramax also earned 11 nominations. Then came TWC, which couldn’t match Miramax’s wins (just the one) but managed (including the win), 12 nominations in a decade with a nomination every year and two each in 2012 and 2015. In fact, in just 28 years, there were a total of 10 wins and 36 total nominations, averaging better than one per year.\n\nThough not as strong as at the Oscars, Miramax still managed four wins (plus two for TWC) for Joan Plowright (Enchanted April), Wiest, Sorvino and Zellweger with TWC wins for Blanchett and Kate Winslet (The Reader). There were in total 25 nominations for Miramax in 20 years and 12 noms for TWC in ten years.\n\nThe studio had to wait until 1996 to win the BAFTA (Binoche) but then won four more in less than a decade (Dench, Zeta-Jones, Zellweger, Blanchett) while TWC would add two more (Cruz, Helena Bonham-Carter (King’s Speech)). Miramax would earn a total of 19 noms (two each for Chicago and Chocolat) and TWC would earn 13 (two for Nowhere Boy). With the BFCA coming in late and being their own group, Miramax only had one award before 2002 (Sorvino) but then added Zeta-Jones, Zellweger and Amy Ryan (Gone Baby Gone) while TWC would win for Winslet. Miramax had four other nominees while TWC managed an astounding 15 noms in a decade. SAG would be another contrary group with only Wiest winning before 2000. But after that, it was all Miramax with four wins in five years (Judi Dench (Chocolat), Zeta-Jones, Zellweger, Blanchett) while TWC would win with Winslet. In total, there would be 22 nominations for Miramax in just 14 years while TWC would manage 13 in just ten years.\n\nBut perhaps the critics awards are the most impressive. Miramax had two performances win four awards (Wiest, Ryan) while TWC had another (Cruz). But in all three cases, the studio actually added more winners! In 1994, Rosemary Harris (Tom & Viv) added an award, in 2008 Winslet had another for TWC and in 2007, Cate Blanchett snagged the other two awards giving Miramax / TWC a clean sweep. That’s in addition to the three awards for Patricia Clarkson for The Station Agent, three for Amy Adams in The Master, two each for Fricker and Sorvino, the two awards in 1996 for two different actresses in The English Patient and the 13 other awards I haven’t mentioned. In just over 25 years, the two studios combined for an amazing 41 critics awards in this category.\n\nBest Ensemble\n\nShakespeare in Love\n\nAugust: Osage County\n\nChicago\n\nThe Queen\n\nNo Country for Old Men\n\nAnalysis: This is based on the total points for acting for all members of the cast.\n\nThe SAG Ensemble award would be won by Miramax three times (Shakespeare, Chicago, No Country) and by TWC twice (Basterds, King’s Speech). Miramax would also earn 13 nominations (in just a decade, with three each in 1996 and 1998) while TWC would add seven more noms.\n\nBest Editing:\n\nPulp Fiction\n\nTrainspotting\n\nThe English Patient\n\nThe Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain\n\nNo Country for Old Men\n\nAnalysis: City of God can’t manage a Top 5 even with a perfect 9 score. Trainspotting, English Patient and Amelie, in spite of perfect 9 scores don’t win the Nighthawk (nor does City of God). Joining Pulp and No Country with wins are Aviator, Basterds and Carol. There are eight other nominees aside from the four already mentioned. Five of the 17 films with nominations are Tarantino films.\n\nEnglish Patient, Chicago and Aviator win the Oscar. There are also 13 nominations from Miramax films and five more from TWC films.\n\nEnglish Patient, Shakespeare and City of God win the BAFTA. There are also 17 nominations, the last five of which are from TWC films. Four Tarantino films earn noms (as opposed to just two at the Oscars). As a late addition to the BFCA there are just three nominees, all of them from TWC. With multiple categories at ACE, there are six winners including both in 2002 (Chicago, Gangs). The last two (Artist, Silver Linings) are both from TWC. There are also 11 Miramax nominees and five TWC nominees.\n\nBest Cinematography:\n\nThe English Patient\n\nThe Aviator\n\nGangs of New York\n\nNo Country for Old Men\n\nThe Hateful Eight\n\nAnalysis: The first two films win the Nighthawk as does Basterds. Another 17 films earn noms, four of which are directed by Tarantino.\n\nOnly English Patient and Aviator win the Oscar but there are some 22 nominees, nine of which are TWC films (three of those are Tarantino films).\n\nEnglish Patient, Wings of the Dove, No Country and Artist win the BAFTA. Eleven more Miramax films and six more TWC films earn noms. Another late BFCA category, so just seven nominations, no wins, all from TWC. English Patient won the ASC then twenty years later, Lion won. There are also 17 nominees, split evenly (nine from Miramax) and all of the nominees except The Piano were between the two wins.\n\nEnglish Patient, The Master and Carol all won three critics awards. The Piano, Hero and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly managed two wins each. Dead Man, The Aviator and The Immigrant each won one award.\n\nBest Original Score:\n\nThe Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain\n\nThe Hateful Eight\n\nShakespeare in Love\n\nThe English Patient\n\nCarol\n\nAnalysis: Shakespeare is actually the only Nighthawk winner. The others are among 18 Nighthawk nominees.\n\nThe studio has been much more impressive at the Oscars with nine wins including five in a four year stretch (winning both the regular and Comedy awards in both 1996 and 1998). There are also 11 nominations.\n\nEnglish Patient, Frida, Aviator, Artist and Hateful Eight all win the Globe. There are also nine more nominees each for each of the two studios. Eight films win the BAFTA with 14 more earning nominations. After 2006, only four films are nominated and three of those win with only Lion failing to win. Artist and Hateful Eight win the BFCA while nine films earn noms.\n\nBest Sound:\n\nThe Aviator\n\nGangs of New York\n\nKill Bill Volume 2\n\nInglourious Basterds\n\nThe English Patient\n\nAnalysis: The Crow, English Patient and Aviator win the Nighthawk. Another seven films earn nominations.\n\nThe English Patient and Chicago win the Oscar with only seven other nominations, one of the studio’s weaker categories.\n\nChicago is the only BAFTA winner but there have been a total of 16 nominations over the years. Nine was the only BFCA nominee in their short-lived category. English Patient, Aviator and No Country all won CAS though only Chicago, Finding Neverland and Hateful Eight managed nominations aside from the winners.\n\nBest Art Direction:\n\nGangs of New York\n\nShakespeare in Love\n\nThe Aviator\n\nThe English Patient\n\nChicago\n\nAnalysis: Aside from the Top 5, Hero also manages a perfect 9. And that Top 5 was a complete bitch to decide on an order, especially given the irony that the winner doesn’t even win the Nighthawk. But, with tough competition, only Shakespeare, Aviator and Carol win the Nighthawk. Another 13 films (including the others in the Top 5) earn nominations.\n\nBizarrely, Miramax manages five Oscars in just a decade (95-04) with Restoration, English Patient, Shakespeare, Chicago and Aviator but none after that. It does earn a total of 16 nominations with four of those coming from TWC films. It had three of the five nominees in 2002.\n\nThe studio wins four BAFTAs (Strictly Ballroom, Piano, Amelie, Aviator) and earns 15 other nominations, six of which are from TWC films. With the BFCA starting in 2009, only TWC has managed nominations (and no wins) with seven noms (including three in 2009). With multiple categories, the wins extend later with the ADG with five films winning the award (English Patient, Chocolat, Amelie, No Country for Old Men, King’s Speech). Another 16 films have earned noms including six TWC films. Gangs of New York, Aviator and The Master all won the LAFC.\n\nBest Visual Effects\n\nHeavenly Creatures\n\nThe Aviator\n\nPaddington\n\nThe Tempest\n\nShaolin Soccer\n\nAnalysis: A weak category for Miramax as noted in the next paragraph. Heavenly Creatures wins the Nighthawk with noms for Kill Bill, Aviator and Tempest.\n\nGoing through in order, this is the first category in which Miramax never won an Oscar. In fact, aside from Animated Film, it’s the only Oscar category in which Miramax never even received a nomination. It did earn four BAFTA noms though (Prospero’s Books, Gangs, Kill Bill 1, Aviator). Aviator won several VES awards, Gangs earned two noms while Frida, The Road and Imitation Game earned noms.\n\nBest Sound Editing\n\nThe Aviator\n\nKill Bill Volume 1\n\nKill Bill Volume 2\n\nThe Crow\n\nDjango Unchained\n\nAnalysis: Crow and Aviator win the Nighthawk. The second Kill Bill doesn’t earn a nom (tough year) but eight other films do (the other two Top 5 films plus Heavenly Creatures, Hero, No Country, Inglourious Basterds, Tempest and Hateful Eight).\n\nMiramax earned a nomination (after the Weinsteins) for No Country and TWC earned ones for Basterds and Django. Miramax has done well at the MPSE with multiple wins for Gangs and Aviator, wins for Chicago, Cold Mountain and Basterds, three noms without a win for Kill Bill 1, wins for six other films, multiple noms without wins for two more and a single nom for 26 more films. In all, 50 films, 62 noms, 12 wins.\n\nBest Costume Design:\n\nThe Aviator\n\nShakespeare in Love\n\nGangs of New York\n\nHero\n\nFarewell My Concubine\n\nAnalysis: Another stacked category with English Patient, Chicago, Ridicule and Queen Margot unable to make the final five. The Aviator, astoundingly, is the only Nighthawk winner even though the next three films are all perfect 9’s (just with massive competition with Hero losing out to Aviator). Miramax does score an additional 19 nominations (five of which are actually TWC) including three in 1996 (English Patient, Ridicule, Emma).\n\nMiramax has done great at the Oscars with five wins plus one for TWC. The five wins were in just a decade (Restoration, English Patient, Shakespeare, Chicago, Aviator). There are also 12 more nominations for Miramax (including its last Oscar nom for The Tempest) and six more for TWC. Four of the six Picture winners for the two studios also won Costume Design. Miramax scored 10 noms including three wins in six years (1992-98) and then five in three years with two wins (2002-04).\n\nMiramax also won four BAFTAs (Strictly Ballroom, The Piano, Mrs Brown, Velvet Goldmine) and one more for TWC (The Artist). Given that only the TWC winner overlaps with the Oscars it shows how great their costumes were. Another 14 Miramax films and six TWC films earned noms. Even with a late start for the category at the BFCA, TWC won an award (The Artist) and earned five more nominations with five total nominations in the first three years of the category. Even missing out on the great Miramax work in the 90s, Miramax won two CDG awards (Chicago, The Queen) while TWC added three more (Transamerica, King’s Speech, W.E.) with seven more Miramax noms and seven for TWC. Starting in 2000, the only year without a CDG nomination were 2001 and 2008.\n\nBest Makeup\n\nThe English Patient\n\nVelvet Goldmine\n\nFarewell My Concubine\n\nShakespeare in Love\n\nRidicule\n\nAnalysis: An under-appreciated category at Miramax. It produces two Nighthawk winners (Farewell, English Patient) and 13 other Nighthawk nominees.\n\nOn the other hand, it took until 1997 for Miramax to earn its first Oscar nom (Mrs. Brown) and 2002 for its first win (Frida). It only has one other nom (Shakespeare) plus a win for TWC (Iron Lady). It’s done much better at the BAFTAs with four wins (Wings of the Dove, Frida, Aviator, Iron Lady) and 19 nominations but the BAFTAs did more with hair and had a larger group of nominees. The final six nominees were all for TWC. TWC has scored seven BFCA noms in seven years (Nine, Road, Iron Lady, My Week with Marilyn, Butler, Carol, Hateful Eight). During the short-lived MUASG, Chicago and Gangs of New York each won an award while Human Stain earned a nom and Frida was nominated in four different categories without winning any of them while since the revival, six TWC have earned noms.\n\nBest Technical Aspects\n\nThe Aviator\n\nGangs of New York\n\nThe English Patient\n\nHero\n\nThe Hateful Eight\n\nAnalysis: This just adds up the totals in the Tech categories.\n\nBest Original Song:\n\n“Can’t Even Tell” (Clerks)\n\n“The Hands That Built America” (Gangs of New York)\n\n“Ordinary Love” (Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom)\n\n“It Can’t Rain All the Time” (The Crow)\n\n“Tell Me If You Wanna Go Home” (Begin Again)\n\nAnalysis: Some of these songs are of questionable eligibility as original songs but fuck it, it’s my list. The first two win the Nighthawk while the next three earn nominations. There are also nominations for lesser songs in weaker years from Chasing Amy, Hero, Bobby, Nine and W.E.. There are also several songs from Sing Street. This is the only category where a film lower than ***.5 (Mandela, Begin Again) makes the Top 5.\n\nIt would take until 1997 for Miramax to earn an Oscar nomination in this category, one of the last categories it picked up. It would also never win an Oscar in the category. It would come on strong in the late 90s and early 00s with 9 nominations from 1997 to 2004 including two for Cold Mountain and three nominations in 2002. In fact, with Chicago, it would have the first film in 26 years and only the second over to win Picture but lose Song. TWC would add two nominations, one in 2005 and one in 2009. Between the two groups, it would also have the two U2 songs that would win the Globe but lose the Oscar. In total, the two studios would earn 13 nominations from 12 films.\n\nThe studio would do much better at the Globes, winning back to back in 2001 (Kate and Leopold) and 2002 (Gangs). TWC would add a win in 2011 with W.E. and again in 2013 with Mandela. There would also be three more Miramax noms and seven more for TWC.\n\nMusic of the Heart would manage a BFCA win followed by two other Miramax noms and eight TWC noms.\n\nBest Animated Film:\n\nPrincess Mononoke\n\nAnalysis: Miramax (9) and TWC (6) released a combined 15 Animated films, several of them Foreign films. Not only is Princess Mononoke the only great one, not only is there is no very good film on the list, but there isn’t even a good one. The next best Animated film on the list is a 60 or a high **.5 (Hoodwinked). What’s more, Mononoke has no awards history for Best Animated Film because almost no group had an award at the time and because by the time it was released in the States, it had to compete with Toy Story 2 for the few awards that did exist. It does win the Nighthawk.\n\nBest Foreign Film:\n\nThe Fabulous Destiny of Amelie Poulain\n\nCity of God\n\nThree Colors: Red\n\nPrincess Mononoke\n\nHero\n\nAnalysis: In many ways, of course, Miramax’s defining category (not so much for TWC). Miramax became known early on for distributing Foreign films (or British films). In just over a decade (1989-2001), Miramax wins the Nighthawk an astounding six times (Cinema Paradiso, Blue, Red, Ridicule, Mononoke, Amelie). In addition, there are another 13 nominees although surprisingly only two of them lose to a fellow Miramax film (White, Il Postino). In all, Miramax has 29 films that land in the Top 20 in a year for Best Foreign Film while TWC doesn’t have any (their best Foreign film is Days of Glory which I give a 75 to, the highest rating possible that can’t earn a nomination).\n\nThis was Miramax’s first major Oscar category and its best. It won the Oscar eight times in all from 1988 to 2005. More importantly, it won four straight Oscars (1988-91) with Pelle the Conqueror, Cinema Paradiso, Journey of Hope and Mediterraneo. It was not only the first studio to win four straight Foreign Film awards (the only other studios with even two straight at that point were Janus with back-to-back Bergman films in 1960 and 1961 and New World with back-to-back Fellini and Kurosawa films) it was the first studio to win four straight Oscars in any category since Paramount did it with Actress in the mid 50s. The other four Oscar winners were Kolya, Life is Beautiful, Barbarian Invasions and Tsotsi. In addition, there were 19 Oscar nominees with all but Days of Glory and Kon-Tiki being from Miramax. From 1988 to 2005 the only year a Miramax film wasn’t nominated for Foreign Film was 1999. In the 90s, Miramax accounted for 30% of the nominees and 40% of the winners at the Oscars.\n\nAt the Globes, Miramax wouldn’t be quite as dominant, winning five awards (Pelle, Paradiso, Farewell My Concubine, Kolya, Diving Bell and the Butterfly) but in all from 1988 to 2005 it would earn 24 nominations and TWC would add one in 2010 and two more in 2012. Every year from 1991 to 1994 Miramax would have at least two Globe nominees and it had two again in 2001 and 2002.\n\nAt the BAFTAs, Miramax would win five of the first seven awards in the 90s (Paradiso, Nasty Girl, Farewell, Il Postino, Ridicule) but that was it for wins. In total, Miramax would earn 24 nominations from 1989 to 2007 with one more for TWC. Even with the BFCA starting after Miramax’s initial big run, it would win four straight awards from 95-98 and still add three more (Il Postino, Ridicule, Shall We Dance, Life is Beautiful, Amelie, Barbarian Invasions and Diving Bell). It would also add a nom for City of God with TWC adding two for Days of Glory and Intouchables.\n\nRed is the biggest critics winner with five wins (every group but the NBR). Concubine would win four critics awards (no NBR or CFC). Three more films would win two each (Crying Game, City of God, Diving Bell) and another ten would win one each. From 1990 to 1998 at least one Miramax film would win a critics award every year.\n\nBest Film (by my points system):\n\nGangs of New York\n\nThe Aviator\n\nThe English Patient\n\nShakespeare in Love\n\nNo Country for Old Men\n\nAnalysis: Adding up all of my points. Gangs would actually come in third if not for “The Hands That Built America” while Aviator and English Patient didn’t have any original songs.\n\nBest Film (weighted points system)\n\nThe English Patient\n\nThe Aviator\n\nGangs of New York\n\nShakespare in Love\n\nNo Country for Old Men\n\nAnalysis: The English Patient’s superb ensemble acting leap-frogs it into the #1 spot. There’s a significant drop (over 30 points) after the Top 5.\n\nBest Films With No Top 5 Finishers:\n\nThe Artist\n\nJackie Brown\n\nThe Imitation Game\n\nThe King’s Speech\n\nWorst Film with a Top 5 Finish:\n\nMandela: Long Walk to Freedom\n\nNighthawk Notables\n\nBest Film to Watch Over and Over: Clerks\n\nBest Line (dramatic): “Choose Life.

Both because of their timing and their Oscar success, I’ve seen a lot of Miramax films in the theater. In order:\n\nMiramax: The Crying Game, The Piano, Sirens, The Crow, Pulp Fiction, Bullets over Broadway, Pret-a-Porter, Smoke, Il Postino, Belle de Jour (as a re-issue), Kids, Mighty Aphrodite, French Twist, The Pallbearer, Trainspotting (three times), Emma, The English Patient, Everyone Says I Love You, Chasing Amy, Good Will Hunting, Scream 2, Jackie Brown, Rounders, Life is Beautiful, Celebrity, Shakespeare in Love, The Cider House Rules, Scary Movie, Chocolat, Bridget Jones’s Diary, The Others, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Serendipity, Amelie, In the Bedroom, Iris, The Shipping News, Spy Kids 2, Quiet American, Gangs of New York, Chicago (twice), Spy Kids 3D, Kill Bill Vol. 1, Cold Mountain, Jersey Girl, Kill Bill Vol. 2, Finding Neverland, The Aviator, Sin City\n\nMiramax post-Weinsteins: The Queen, No Country for Old Men\n\nTWC: Clerks II, The Reader, The Artist, The Master, Silver Linings Playbook, Django Unchained, The Imitation Game, Carol, The Hateful Eight\n\nAwards\n\nAcademy Awards\n\nNumber of Films That Have Earned Nominations: 109\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Oscars: 40\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Nominations: 62\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Wins: 16\n\nBest Picture Nominations: 27\n\nTotal Number of Nominations: 366\n\nTotal Number of Wins: 84\n\nCategory With the Most Nominations: Supporting Actress (36)\n\nDirectors with Most Oscar Nominated Films: Stephen Frears / Quentin Tarantino (5)\n\nBest Film with No Oscar Nominations: Kill Bill Volume 1\n\nYear with Most Nominated Films: 1994 / 1996 (7)\n\nYear with Most Nominations: 2002 (31)\n\nYear with Most Oscars: 1996 (12)\n\nOscar Oddities:\n\nThe Top 10 Points down below is astonishing. The Top 4 is especially so. RKO never had a single film with 530 points. UA, Warners and Universal have only managed 4 films with that many points if you combine all three. The only studio to match it is Columbia (4) and Paramount (5) and they have much, much longer track records.\n\nMiramax had two streaks of four consecutive years with at least 5 nominated films (94-97, 00-03). No studio had done it even once since Paramount in 73-76 and no other studio has done it even once since.\n\nMiramax had the most nominated films four years in a row (00-03), the longest such streak since Paramount in the mid 70s.\n\nSince 1939, only twice has a studio had the most Oscar nominations at least three years in a row. Miramax did it both times (96-98, 01-04).\n\nMiramax’s 31 nominations in 2002 was the most for any studio since 1981 and the third most since 1961.\n\nMiramax is the only studio to have the most nominations for a decade twice in a row (135 in the 90s, 118 in the 00s).\n\nMiramax had a streak of 12 straight years with an Oscar (88-99), the longest streak since 1972.\n\nMiramax’s 12 Oscars in 1996 are tied with UA in 1961 for the most ever by a studio in a single year.\n\nEven though Miramax didn’t even submit a film until 1987 and didn’t earn an Oscar nomination until 1988, by 1998, it had the eighth most for any studio, more than Disney or RKO.\n\nMiramax managed to earn an Oscar nomination 23% of the time (of their submitted films). The average major is at 15% and no major except UA is above 17%. Over 5% of all their submitted films were nominated for Best Picture. The only studio higher is TWC (5.88%) while nearly all the majors are below 3.5%. TWC managed a Best Picture nom for 32% of its nominated films, which blows away everyone else. Miramax is in third, just behind Columbia and just ahead of Warners, all at 22%.\n\nMost Oscar Nominations\n\nShakespeare in Love – 13\n\nChicago – 13\n\nThe English Patient – 12\n\nThe King’s Speech – 12\n\nThe Aviator – 11\n\nGangs of New York – 10\n\nThe Artist – 10\n\nGood Will Hunting – 9\n\nThe Piano / No Country for Old Men – 8\n\nInglourious Basterds / Silver Linings Playbook / The Imitation Game – 8\n\nMost Oscar Wins:\n\nThe English Patient – 9\n\nShakespeare in Love – 7\n\nChicago – 6\n\nThe Aviator – 5\n\nThe Artist – 5\n\nMost Oscar Points:\n\nThe English Patient – 620\n\nShakespeare in Love – 585\n\nChicago – 535\n\nThe King’s Speech – 530\n\nThe Artist – 480\n\nThe Aviator – 450\n\nNo Country for Old Men – 420\n\nThe Piano – 370\n\nGood Will Hunting – 360\n\nSilver Linings Playbok – 325\n\nCritics Awards\n\nNumber of Films That Have Won Critics Awards: 71\n\nNumber of Films With Multiple Awards: 41\n\nBest Picture Wins: 15\n\nTotal Number of Awards: 238\n\nCategory With the Most Awards: Supporting Actress (41)\n\nMost Awards:\n\nThe Piano – 16\n\nPulp Fiction – 16\n\nNo Country for Old Men – 13\n\nThe Queen – 12\n\nThe Master – 11\n\nHappy-Go-Lucky – 9\n\nCarol – 9\n\nMy Left Foot – 7\n\nThe Crying Game – 6\n\nIn the Bedroom – 6\n\nMost Points:\n\nPulp Fiction – 1301\n\nThe Piano – 1033\n\nNo Country for Old Men – 915\n\nThe Queen – 799\n\nHappy-Go-Lucky – 643\n\nThe Master – 602\n\nCarol – 572\n\nMy Left Foot – 480\n\nIn the Bedroom – 446\n\nThe Artist – 397\n\nnote: At the time of its release, Pulp Fiction was #3 all-time.
