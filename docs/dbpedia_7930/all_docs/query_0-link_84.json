        "text": "It's 5.30pm. Nobody's eaten dinner at 5.30 since Judy Garland passed into the next world. But if there's one thing we know about Renée Zellweger it's that, to play Bridget Jones (which she is, again), she has to beef up. She has to eat all day long. And so here we are in this Belgravia hotel, and Zellweger is very ruefully asking for a menu. She muses quietly over the mozzarella and avocado salad (\"That sounds easy to eat\"), while her expression says, \"I might be able to choke down something I don't have to chew\", and we all wait, expectantly, while she doesn't order. The air fills with tension; her PA is watching discreetly from a distance. The barman brings tempting superior crisps and nuts in a silver carousel, and I try to lead by example by hoovering them up. It's like hanging out with a baby bird, although in this respect alone - otherwise, she is a fully fledged and much more serious individual than the endless high-protein milkshake stories might lead you to expect.\n\nBridget Jones is a side issue, anyway - we're here to talk about Cold Mountain, Anthony Minghella's adaptation of Charles Frazier's civil war love epic, set in North Carolina. I'm beginning to wonder whether Minghella is the only person in the history of cinema who makes films that are unfailingly better than the books. Sure, the book has enormous grace and momentum, but the film is almost too moving to bear. I started crying 15 minutes in and by the end thought I was about to have some kind of seizure.\n\nThe love-story tag is slightly misleading, or at least doesn't tell anything like the whole of it. Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are Ada and Inman, the romantic axis, but the relationship between Ada and Zellweger's Ruby is just as carefully drawn and compelling as the boy-girl plot and, crucially, is accorded just as much weight. It makes you realise how rare it is in film to see a female friendship not simply depicted as a concrete, bolshy, subplot alliance, but developing and growing in warmth and resonance, almost romantically, the way real friendships develop. And Zellweger is brilliant - she has this fabled comic delivery, anyway, which is why she's such a favourite on the modern-screwball-comedy circuit, but here she maintains a tragicomic poise that is not just wonderful to watch, but also gives the film real texture.\n\nIn fact, Zellweger has a bit of history with this book - when she first read it, she thought about buying the rights, but couldn't. \"I didn't really have much of a chance, because Newsweek called it the most beautifully written book about the American civil war in the past 50 years, and by the Monday morning it was, like, fat chance, Renée, this has a million-dollar price tag.\"\n\nMinghella, having been told of her interest after he'd bought the rights, met up with her five years later. He remembers, \"She had wanted to do it so she could play Ada, I think. But I thought she would just be so astonishing as Ruby. The interesting thing about her was that, as I was waiting for her to have lunch, I realised that I didn't have the faintest idea what she looked like. I honestly didn't think I'd recognise her. Because there's the film where she plays a Hasidic jew [A Price Above Rubies] and she looked like a totally different person from the one in Jerry Maguire. It's an intriguing characteristic, that she can create these creatures. Very few actors of that kind of profile can disappear into a role. And Ruby had to be a kind of troll, a kind of creature from the mountains. Nothing was known of her provenance. You had to think, 'What kind of alchemy could create this look?' Renée is someone who's changed her weight, changed her face, she's not worried about preserving an image of herself.\"\n\nThis is rather more than a lack of aesthetic vanity; hers is an unremarkable ego all round. She talks very rarely about acting as \"self-expression\" and even then seems only to be paying lip service to it. Expressing herself wasn't the point; making a good film was the point. \"I wouldn't really say I identified with Ruby, it was more about the feeling of the book, the land, the beauty of that part of the country, the way he'd taken this event and humanised it, made it smaller, made it a real experience, which is what it was. Obviously.\" But you do notice a marked lack of physical vanity all the same - this isn't a character that asserts itself as a beauty. It grows on you, the way Cameron Diaz did in Being John Malkovich. There aren't many female actors who have that in their portfolio. In fact, this lack of personal vanity is easily counteracted by the faintly neurotic care of her Hollywood fixers, who won't have her photographed while in excess of Extremely Thin, and in the end won't let us have any shots that convey anything beyond this exaggeratedly joyful coquetry that is the stock in trade of the female actor. But I think it would be a disservice to extrapolate anything about Zellweger herself from this silliness. You don't spend three seasons on top of a Transylvanian mountain, acting a troll, if your aim in life is to be a poster girl.\n\nAnyway, I know I have a tendency to gush, but I honestly think it's justified with Cold Mountain. Besides Zellweger, Nicole Kidman is warmer and more human than at any time in her career; and Jude Law is hotter, and also more human.\n\nRenée Zellweger's CV is as remarkable for its absences as for its triumphs. Her first part was a small one in Dazed And Confused (1993), followed by a smattering of respectable indie features before she hit household levels with Jerry Maguire in 1996 (she was 27). Since then, naturally, some things have been better than others - Nurse Betty and Me, Myself & Irene, both 2000, were better than Down With Love (the Ewan McGregor-paired homage to Doris Day). Chicago was better than Bridget Jones, but only if you buy the line that films with singing and dancing are de facto better than films without (which I do... apart from Cold Mountain, which has very little singing).\n\nBut there isn't a single embarrassment; there's no rubbishy blockbuster with \"I just got paid $13m for pretending to fancy Ben Affleck\" written all over it. There are no roles that just involve a lot of running about, in advanced states of undress, while you get chased by aliens or policemen, or aliens dressed as policemen. There's no raunchiness - sure, there's sex, but it's always either comic, as in Bridget Jones, where such sexual tension as there is gets effortlessly released by big pants and jokes about anal sex, or it's highly stylised, as in Chicago, where the modern musical genre allows for this phenomenal, vaudeville sexuality, but no actual rudeness. Or it's very elliptical, as in Cold Mountain, where one minute she is just eyeing up a local and the next she has two kids and a bossy mouth on her. (Did I just blow the ending? I don't think so. I hope not.) There's no deadwood girlfriend the hero just happens to fall in love with because she was there, and was better-looking than whoever was standing next to her. And those kinds of films are so ubiquitous, in the careers of even the most respectable actors, that you forget they have a choice - nobody has to do pointless stuff for the money, but very few people refuse it.\n\n\"Well, no, I always knew why this was important to me,\" says Zellweger. \"I always knew that what I really loved in my life wasn't going to be determined by whether or not I had a job as an actress. So I didn't feel the need to compromise myself, ever. That's why I was never disenchanted, at the beginning - it wasn't like I was making these massive sacrifices and compromising my convictions for this thing, and then being disappointed. I never did go into work and not care about what I was doing. never did go to work just to say some crap that had been written, and not be able to work out why.\" She hesitates for a bit. \"I mean, come on, let's be honest...\" (There's a long pause, and I want to say, \"OK! What about?\") \"Happiness doesn't come from certain things. You only need to learn that once. I know what I love, and it was never absent because I was struggling.\"\n\nI figure out what's going on here, which is that she wants to say money can't buy you happiness, but can't choke it out because it's too hackneyed. And it is a cliché, but at least it's a cliché with a purpose, and one that it's difficult for a phenomenally loaded person, with a basically leftie sensibility, to either ignore or say out loud. \"I don't understand LA sometimes - I don't understand what it chooses to celebrate. It's not just Los Angeles, it's ubiquitous. I really question what it is that we celebrate as a society - why is acquisition representative of success, as opposed to looking back at the contribution you made and asking whether or not it's had a positive impact? I just don't understand the appetite for negativity that has surfaced in both of our societies in the past five years - it seems insatiable. There's like this angry, embittered tone to everything.\" I quite like this post-Marxist causal relationship between materialism and social alienation, but Zellweger won't be drawn any further.\n\nShe habitually describes herself as \"opinionated but uninformed\", and her most overused phrases are \"It's hard to say\" and \"I don't know\". I point this out. She says, rather disarmingly, \"Well, I get asked things all the time, and most of the time the answer is, 'I really don't know'.\"\n\nThe lack of garden-variety sexpot roles was likewise a conscious decision. \"My sexuality is not something that I depend upon that much. It's just not interesting to me. Really early on, in Texas, most of the roles I was offered were the other woman, the harlot, the one-night stand, the hot blonde in black dress. It's a really difficult path to get off, once you've embraced it. It's the most boring part of it to me. And I don't like the pressure, it's disingenuous. I've had someone rush in to powder my nose because it's red when the character is broken-hearted and crying. And you know what happens when you cry? Your nose gets red! I like that!\"\n\nThe most difficult thing about talking to this woman is getting her to stick to the subject of herself. She seems pretty sheepish about examining her own motivations, or priorities. \"I don't know if I think of myself as a self-aware person. Can you say that? Does that work?\" Ask about her parents and you'll find out what Norway was like just after the war (her father was Swiss, her mother Norwegian). Ask about filming Cold Mountain and you'll find out what social changes are occurring in Romania, where it was shot (lots). Ask about Down With Love and you'll get rather a mournful, acute imaginative reconstruction of what life must have been like if you were female in the 1950s. \"The make-up was torture. I just kept thinking, oh God, they couldn't leave their houses until they had done all this. Their success was dependent on maintaining this image. Imagine that sort of pressure - that you're not allowed to have a natural human experience of going through life, and going through changes, without resenting it. You should be able to do it gracefully and gladly, not be thinking, 'Oh, good God, I'm not going to be able to take care of myself because I'm no longer pretty'.\"\n\nMinghella said in passing that you were much more likely to end up talking about Iraq than about any aspect of Zellweger's life, and it's true - well, kind of true. She wants to talk about Iraq and not talk about Iraq in exactly equal measure. \"I think it's irresponsible to speak on behalf of something that is important to you without becoming really well informed first. Because you stand to do more damage in the long run to what it is you're trying to support. You know, I was watching the news from the Transylvanian mountain tops, the BBC, the Belgian news, the German news, and it was so confusing to see accounts of what was happening in my country, call home, speak to my friends about it, and have them know nothing about what was going on. I know what's important. I know what things I question. But I can't speak, because I've got nothing to stand on.\"\n\nI'm guessing here, but I'd say she shares George Clooney's antiwar, sceptical political bent - partly because they're very good friends (they were rumoured to be going out, but weren't) and partly because she speaks very highly of him, how unfrivolous he is. But she's dead right: being an actor with this level of celebrity is like having a gagging order slapped on you. The downside of fame is meant to be the lack of privacy, but there's also an aspect of your public persona that is castrated by the fact that, when even the most trivial aspects of your life are scrutinised, your view on larger matters will not just be derided, it will bring the entire standpoint into disrepute. I posit the view here that the mainstream media, specifically Hollywood, pretends to be apolitical when, in fact, it's deeply conservative and expects its players to adhere slavishly to bland, patriotic consensus. She smiles and says, \"I really couldn't say. I just don't know.\"\n\nWhile Jerry Maguire was the breakthrough flick in the US, it's fair to say that Bridget Jones's Diary was the film that turned Renée Zellweger into a household name over here. There was a lot of resistance to the casting when it was first revealed in early 2000 that the lead would not be played by some feckless thirtysomething English bird, after all, but a lickety-split, perfectly formed American. I wrote at the time that it was like casting Jude Law in a remake of The Elephant Man, and I was partly being an arse, but partly serious, insofar as an injection of such glamour wouldn't just prettify the whole Bridget Jones business, but miss the point of it entirely. This was plainly wrong-headed, for the simple reason that Zellweger is a character actor - she doesn't show up and do another Renée Zellweger the way Julia Roberts might do a Julia Roberts. Besides which, of course, everyone was terribly careful to stop her looking glamorous, with the judicious application of 20 jammy doughnuts a day, a precaution I think was basically unnecessary (I mean, surely the whole point was that being neurotic about your weight was, like, neurotic? Surely she didn't have to be literally lardy?).\n\nWell, you have to ask about all the food, even while you expect rather an impatient response. Which is what I got. \"That was such a tiny part of the whole experience! A tiny part.\" \"I'm sure it was,\" I say. \"God, it was only three months, anyway.\" \"Nine months,\" she says. \"It was nine months.\" \"Well, then, just like being pregnant.\" \"Yes. And giving birth to something very different.\" \"But also worthwhile, and less noisy.\" \"You hope so.\"\n\nThe lasting legacy of the Bridget Jones film was not saddlebags, but a reputation for being unlucky in love. \"It was everywhere, I've been plagued by this whole, Renée has such a sad, challenging love life... poor, single Renée, always looking for the boy.\" This is certainly true; in the impossibility of being single, female and famous without being either a marriage-breaker or a tragic spin, Zellweger has, since her split from Jim Carrey, been relentlessly portrayed as the latter. The myth dovetails rather nicely with the many layers of weight-gain fascination, so that her recent parting from Jack White, of the White Stripes, was put down in gossip circles to his being unhappy about her hectic eating schedule. She didn't really want to talk about all this, naturally enough, but was wryly adamant that she isn't this disappointed flower she's made out to be. \"It's just not true. I mean, I didn't grow up thinking that the guy was going to ride up on a horse, and I was going to have this kind of wedding, and by the time I was this age I was going to have the house and the kids, I just didn't have those prerequisites for happiness. I've never been an active partner-seeker; sure, it's happiness, and it's a lovely thing, and I believe in it, and I've seen it with my parents. But I don't think that happiness is contingent upon finding it.\"\n\nShe talks fondly of having a lot in common with Kidman, being both \"single girls in Hollywood\", which makes it all sound a bit 1940s - someone should update them as a new-generation Monroe and Russell, capering about not looking for a millionaire. This is one of a number of misconceptions she wouldn't mind clearing up. Others include, for one, that just because she's an actor doesn't mean she has to have fortnightly botox injections and other enhancements to maintain the look of a rather surprised 12-year-old. \"My signature thing is not Poster Girl Renée, anyway. I don't want to be doing the same thing at 60 that I was doing at 25. Good God, I'll bore myself to death and everybody else along with me.\"\n\nAnd, in a similar vein, just because you're famous doesn't mean you have to cut off contact with the civilian world. (That was a phrase Liz Hurley used once, that it was difficult to go out with \"civilians\" - it made me think she was vile, but at the same time, I just blithely believed her.) \"Oh God, look, if you can pay your rent and your friend can't, then you help out, like you always have,\" says Zellweger. \"But once you've reached the point where you can pay rent, you can go to the vet and you can go to the grocery store, after that point it's all the same. I don't have an appetite for a decadent lifestyle. It's not like it looks from the outside. It's not, 'This tea isn't good enough because it's not luxury tea. It's not The Best Tea'.\"\n\nOh, and just because you get a lot of attention, doesn't mean it's what you want. \"A lot of times when I encounter paparazzi on the street, the attitude seems to be, 'Well, this is what you wanted. You wanted to be applauded and celebrated' and it's such a cliché, but I didn't. I just wanted to do my job.\" It is a cliché, but it sounded different when she said it. She's got enormous charm, and I'm a sucker for charm.\n\nThe form with interviewing famous people is that five minutes before your time is up, they look bored and say they have to wind up, you ask them who they're having sex with, they don't tell you, and then you both go home. This point has way passed; Zellweger's mother has called for the third time. It's Thanksgiving and, naturally, her family are all around a table somewhere in Dallas, waiting to give her the love of the season. They're manifestly very close - she speaks with enormous warmth about her brother, who works in the wine business, and says wryly about her parents, \"I wouldn't say they were proud of me especially. I think they're both happy that they did OK, you know. They raised a couple of kids who don't call home from prison for bail.\"\n\nThe household she grew up in was pretty idiosyncratic, with its national mix and troubled history: \"They've seen different things, my parents. They had to struggle not just to get by, but to survive. And that's something most of our generation haven't experienced, what it's like to have your town invaded and burned to the ground, for example. I was always grateful for it, you know, it was nice to see that even though on the map the United States is in the middle, it's not the centre of the world. I mean, there were a lot of things that they couldn't understand. My mom could never understand why it would ever be a drag to go to school, when she'd been desperate to go to school, but couldn't, because it had burned down. But I was always grateful for it.\" She hasn't got anything to say about the whole of her childhood that isn't suffused with affection, apart from maybe that she didn't like pickled herring night. And yet, after all this time in the business, she's still too polite to tell me to go away so she can ring her mum"
