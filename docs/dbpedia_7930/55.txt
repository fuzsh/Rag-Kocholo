Mentalist, The 2.09 Price Above Rubies, A (2009)

When a jewellery store robbery ends up with the manager shot, Jane states that the victim must be the prime suspect because he used to be a tennis pro.

6/10

Hypnotism isn’t really a useful interrogation technique. If it was, there’d be no need for torture. Elsewhere, this is an entirely ordinary episode but that means it’s quite entertaining, inoffensive and highly watchable. Favourite line was Jane’s response to "he’s not my uncle": "Sorry, the man having sex with your aunt, then."

This Mentalist, The episode contains mild adult dialogue and gun violence, unpleasant scenes.
