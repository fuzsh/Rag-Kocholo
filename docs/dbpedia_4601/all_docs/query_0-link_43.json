        "text": "SYNOPSIS\n\nContaining thirty-two films – with a running time of over 720 minutes – this collection documents Buster Keaton’s short films between 1917-1923.\n\nCapturing Keaton’s first steps in front of a camera this box set charts his early association with ex-Keystone Kop Roscoe ‘Fatty’ Arbuckle through to starring in, headlining, and directing his own box office smash hits. Using Chaplin’s old Hollywood studios in 1920, Keaton’s sophisticated technical inventiveness coupled with his haunted-yet-handsome ‘Stone Face’ persona, created a succession of the most timeless, classic comedy shorts ever realised. The Masters of Cinema Series is proud to present the following films in a luxurious box set, available on DVD, as well as on Blu-ray for the first time in the UK.\n\nFeaturing: The Butcher Boy (1917), The Rough House (1917), His Wedding Night (1917), Oh, Doctor!
