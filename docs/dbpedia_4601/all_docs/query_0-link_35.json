Very uncommon lobby card from one of the classic Keaton short films, with slapstick interactions between him and various Native American characters, who are attempting to prevent a land grab by some crooked white guys.  This card originally had a vertical fold (many rare silent lobby cards have only been found like this, as they werer used as bookmarks by musicians accompanying silent movies, and, in many cases, these folded examples are the only ones known to exist). It was starch backed, allowing a talented conservator to touch up the center, where there had been a fold. The card now presents very nicely, VERY GOOD-.",
