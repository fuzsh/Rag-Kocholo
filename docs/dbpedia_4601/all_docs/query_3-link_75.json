        "text": "Bob Hope and Jane Russell\n\nSon of Paleface - Released July 14, 1952\n\nBob Hope (along with co-stars Jane Russell and Roy Rogers) create a parody of western movies that gives Hope 95 minutes to pack in a series of inside-jokes on culture, circa 1952, and allows Rogers to ride Trigger (\"the smartest horse in the movies\") and softly lampoon his own western films.\n\nJane Russell wears a selection of outfits (by Edith Head, with jewelry by Joan Joseff) and sings a number of tunes (for example Wing-Ding Tonight) and Hope and Rogers also sing onscreen, the three stars providing a whole soundtrack album's worth of songs.\n\nStructured more-or-less in the same loose comedy style as the Bing Crosby - Bob Hope Road movies, the film rolls along like a variety show, with Bob Hope, of course, dominant, playing Peter Potter Jr, son of \"painless\" Peter Potter Sr, who was the star of the 1948 The Paleface (and also played by Hope!)\n\nCecil B. DeMille makes a cameo as a bathtub photographer.\n\nThis film is usually listed as one of Bob Hope's best comedies. Inventive and full of Luney Tune-style cartoon humour, the story paradies western movie tropes unmercifully. Hope throws in constant jabs at his previous films, at Bing Crosby, Harvard University, and Roy Rogers.\n\nJane Russell plays an adventurous double-agent but a lot of her screen time consists of standing in an Edith Head gown or western-outfit and frowning at Hope's misbehaviour.\n\nRelated:\n\nBob Hope in Here Come the Girls - 1953\n\nBob Hope and Jane Russell in The Paleface - 1948\n\nBob Hope and Jane Russell in Son of Paleface - 1952\n\nBob Hope and Paulette Goddard in The Cat and the Canary - 1939\n\nWhat's Recent\n\nOriginal Page Nov 21, 2015"
