        "text": "‘What Remains’\n\nRent or buy it on major platforms.\n\nAndrea Riseborough and Stellan Skarsgard star in Ran Huang’s devastating feature debut. It’s a psychodrama inspired by Thomas Quick, who confessed to more than 30 murders in the 1990s while detained in a Swedish mental institution, only to later admit that he fabricated them.\n\nMads (Gustaf Skarsgard, a son of Stellan) is desperate for a fresh start after being discharged from a psychiatric facility. As Mads acclimates to the outside world, he gets acquainted with Anna, his magnanimous therapist (Riseborough, perfectly icy yet still kind), and Soren (the elder Skarsgard), a seen-it-all detective assigned to the case after Mads confesses to killing a boy.\n\nIn a heartbreaking scene, Huang films one of Mads’s confessions through rain-soaked car windows, softening a horrific monologue and making me feel compassion for someone who is admitting to being a pedophile serial killer — an uneasy feeling from a horror movie (or any movie) that’s far scarier than watching a masked butcher stalk teenagers.\n\nIs Mads a real monster? Or is he monstrous for untruthfully confessing to being a heinous human? These and other questions — of morality, forgiveness, redemption — get no easy answers in this deeply affecting film."
