        "text": "- Who are the great kings of comedy?\n\nDo Danny Kaye and Bob Hope rate with Charlie Chaplin and the Marx Brothers? Kaye and Hope are heralded, multifaceted entertainers, but their movies usually don't rank up there with those of Chaplin, Buster Keaton, W.C. Fields or the Marx Brothers. Yet the Denver Art Museum's \"Kings of Comedy\" film series, which begins Tuesday and continues through May 15, treats them like, well, kings. Each gets his own feature film - while Fields, by comparison, gets but a short. In the program notes for Kaye's 1956 \"The Court Jester,\" which screens May 8, series programmer Thomas Delapa writes that Kaye had \"versatile talents as mime, mimic and vocal virtuoso.\"\n\nThe film, a musical fable, stars Kaye as a rebel masquerading as a corrupt king's jester.\n\nHere are the other films in the series:\n\n- \"Sherlock Junior,\" Tuesday: An innovative 1924 Buster Keaton silent, shown with two Keaton shorts, accompanied by Hank Troy on piano.\n\n- \"The Circus,\" April 10: Charlie Chaplin's 1928 feature, containing his amazing trapeze act, along with his short \"The Adventurer.\"\n\n- \"The Freshman,\" April 17: It features Harold Lloyd's daredevil slapstick stunts; shown with a Laurel and Hardy short, \"Two Tars.\"\n\nHank Troy will provide piano accompaniment.\n\n- \"Animal Crackers,\" April 24: The Marx Brothers' 1930 film with comic foil Margaret Dumont.\n\n- \"The Paleface,\" May 1: Bob Hope plays an inept dentist teamed with Jane Russell in this 1948 film; he also lip-syncs the Oscar-winning song \"Buttons and Bows.\"\n\nAlso shown will be a Three Stooges short, \"I Can Hardly Wait.\"\n\n- \"The Court Jester,\" May 8:\n\n- \"Take the Money and Run,\" May 15: Woody Allen's first wacky auteurist hit, shown with W.C. Fields' short \"The Fatal Glass of Beer.\"\n\nThe films will be presented in 16millimeter prints at 7 p.m. at Acoma Center, 1080 Acoma St. Single tickets are $7; $6 to DAM members, seniors and students with an ID. Series tickets are $40; $35 to DAM members, etc. Call 720-865-5000 for advance tickets or purchase them at the museum; call 720-913-0105 for information.\n\nNotable this month\n\nHere are some of April's other notable film festivals and special screenings:\n\n- Bluebird Theater, 3317 E. Colfax Ave., presents director Nicolas Roeg's \"The Man Who Fell to Earth\" at 8 p.m. April 12 as part of its Cinema Sips and Sounds series. The 1976 science-fiction film, one of the more unusual and engrossing ones of the decade, stars David Bowie as an alien and was written by \"Croupier's\" Paul Mayersburg. Admission is $5.\n\n- The Aspen Shortsfest, which runs April 10-14 at locations in Aspen and Carbondale, offers outrageous director John Waters ( \"Pink Flamingos'') as its closingnight guest speaker. Waters, who started his career as an independent filmmaker by making the shorts \"Eat Your Makeup\" and \"Hag in a Black Leather Jacket,\" will speak at 7 p.m. April 14 at Wheeler Opera House. Tickets are $12.50 and go on sale Tuesday at the Wheeler box office (970-920-5770).\n\n- \"The Gleaners and I,\" French director Agnes Varda's latest and highly praised film, comes to University of Colorado-Boulder's International Film Series, at Muenzinger Auditorium, for 7 p.m. and 9 p.m. screenings April 26 and 27. It is a documentary about those who scavenge amid the detritus of modern life. Admission is $4; call 303-492-1531 for information.\n\nInformation about May screenings and festivals should be sent to Steven Rosen, Denver Post, 1560 Broadway, Denver, CO 80202, by April 20.\n\nDenver's five best first-run movies\n\n- \"Before Night Falls\"\n\n- \"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\"\n\n- \"Pollock\"\n\n- \"Traffic\"\n\n- \"The Widow of St. Pierre\"\n\nSee capsule reviews for details."
