        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nPart i coMedy Part 1 focuses on comedy, which, having strong roots in vaudeville, burlesque, and music hall, had a tradition upon which to build before the invention of cinema. Because slapstick comedy quickly reached a height of inventiveness in Hollywood during the silent era, it was a genre earlier critics were inclined to write about with varying degrees of nostalgia. While comedy is understood today more as a mode than a genre, given that such recognizable forms as screwball comedy, slapstick comedy, romantic comedy, bromance, and parody , among others, all have their own conventions, the achievements of this “golden age” of comedy clearly attracted genre critics early on. The section opens with James Agee’s well-known feature article on silent comedy, “Comedy’s Greatest Era,” which appeared originally in Life in September 1949, followed by Siegfried Kracauer’s lesser-known piece “Silent Film Comedy ,” originally published in the British journal Sight and Sound two years later. A screenwriter, poet, and critic who reviewed films for the Nation and Time through the 1940s, Agee sees the great silent comic filmmakers—Sennett, Chaplin, Keaton, Langdon, Lloyd—as having the imagination to build on physical gags, an ability sadly lacking in the verbal comedians of the day such as Bob Hope, whose film The Paleface (1948) pales in comparison to Buster Keaton’s The Navigator (1924). Both Agee and Kracauer view the introduction of sound as destroying cinematic comedy, but whereas the former focuses on the formal mechanics of the gag, the latter sees slapstick as expressing a sense of alienation from mechanical progress and acknowledging the importance of material reality and its contingencies, qualities Kracauer emphasizes as inherent “affinities” of cinema in his 1960 book, Theory of Film. In turn, British writer Allen Eyles, author of several star studies and histories of British film exhibition and editor of the magazine Focus on Film during its run in the 1970s, finds comedy at the time of his writing in 1963 wanting compared to the sound comedies of the 1930s and ’40s. In “Uncle Sam’s Funny 12 coMedy Bone,” from Films and Filming in 1963, Eyles provides a wide-ranging overview of contemporary Hollywood comedy and, anticipating later ideological analyses of genre such as those of Judith Hess Wright and Jean-Loup Bourget,1 emphasizes how the potentially subversive energy of several types of film comedy has become diluted or compromised by industrial and cultural factors. Next, Dwight Macdonald, a public intellectual who professed progressive politics but took a conservative view on cultural matters, joins the chorus lamenting the current state of film comedy compared to the “golden age.”2 In “Whatever Happened to Hollywood Comedy?,” which appeared originally in Esquire in 1965, Macdonald seeks to identify a number of structural rules for successful comedy based on the failure of so many recent comic films. Subtlety and sympathetic identification, Macdonald claims, are essential to comedy but sorely lacking in comedies of the time. The following essay, “The Evolution of the Chase in the Silent Screen Comedy ,” published in 1964 in Cinema Journal, the scholarly journal of the Society for Cinema and Media Studies, by Donald W. McCaffrey, takes an altogether different approach. McCaffrey, a longtime professor of film who taught at the University of North Dakota beginning in 1960 and author of several books on Hollywood comedy, including works on Charlie Chaplin and Bob Hope, is less concerned with aesthetic judgment than with tracing the changes of one specific comic trope, the chase, in relation to the narrative in comedies made during the silent era. In effect, McCaffrey considers what Rick Altman would later call one of comedy’s semantic elements and its evolving use in the genre’s syntactic structure.3 Part 1 concludes with “From Kops to Robbers: Transformation of Archetypal Figures in the American Cinema of the 1920s and ’30s,” by Carolyn and Harry Geduld. Author of numerous books on film, Harry Geduld taught at Indiana University in Bloomington, where he established its film studies program in 1964 and served as its first director. Like McCaffrey, the Gedulds are interested here in tracing broader patterns in the genre, in this case in the transition from silent to sound comedy. Focusing on the visual dynamic of the conventional “little man” versus the larger villain (“the heavy”) in silent comedy, they find fascinating connections to the conventional representations in gangster films while noting the considerably different ideological implications between the two genres and their different responses to changing times.
