        "text": "Biography\n\nThe stylish Arizona transplants moved to Nashville in 2003 and began writing and performing as LUCY ANGEL. Kate, mother of Lindsay and Emily, grew up as an army brat and knows no life without music. Among her many accomplishments is winning the Wrangler® Country Showdown. Lindsay and Emily remember being carpooled around in the denim blue Wrangler® Van. “It was the perfect playground back there for us” the girls laugh, speaking of the spacious van equipped to haul band gear but lacking seats.\n\nAt the tender age of four, Lindsay sang her first solo, “Paper Woses,” (as she called it) and never looked back. By the time Lindsay was twelve, she began singing professionally alongside her mom and was quick to develop her own style and sound. It wasn’t until the Arizona natives made the trek to Nashville, when Lindsay and Kate gained recognition as a duo, that Emily decided to join the band. Emily picked up the guitar right away and instantly made her way to the front of the stage. Together these talented, magnetic personalities make up the unique family band, LUCY ANGEL. The first show LUCY ANGEL performed as a trio was opening up for Neal McCoy.\n\nLUCY ANGEL has captivated audiences around the world performing hundreds of shows in the U.S. in support of their debut EP. In addition, they have toured Japan, Switzerland and China. They were honored to be the very first Western /American act to ever sing at the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square, Beijing in front of Chinese government officials and more than 280 international dignitaries and ambassadors.\n\nThe group is currently on a radio tour to deliver their new single “SERIOUS” off their self-titled LUCY ANGEL EP, produced by Nashville songwriting prodigy Anthony Smith. The EP includes several songs written by Smith (George Strait, Tim McGraw, Rascal Flatts). Their overall sound is distinctly their own in that it’s a little bit sassy and a little bit sweet… from their opening harmonies to the closing note on this hit filled EP these ladies unmistakably create music that is charismatic, refreshingly honest and undeniably alluring."
