        "text": "Lucy Louise de Padilla Carrillo\n\nOur family matriarch was born February 23, 1928 in El Llanito, to Juanita Crespin and Pablo De Padilla. Lucy grew up in a big Catholic family, sharing an especially close relationship with her sister, Sadie. On April 10, 1954, Lucy married Raymundo Carrillo in Las Vegas, NM. They were blessed with three children, Connie, Raimund Jr. and Juanita Jo. The five of them explored the world while in active duty in the military and made lifelong friends along the way. Although countless others consider her family, Lucy is survived by her husband; two children (plus spouses & her bonus children Lisa, Paul and Laurence); six grandchildren, Amanda (Daniel), Ana-Marie (John), Paula, Alexandra, Max, and Sofia; and five great-grandchildren, Noah, Augustine, Lucie, Jay, and Elijah; and sister, Angie. She was preceded in death by her daughter, Connie; sister, Sadie; and many other loved ones. Community was important to Lucy. She belonged to the Shrine of St. Bernadette where she was active in the Alter Rosary Society. She loved volunteering with seniors. She was a member of the Retreat House and sewed many beautifully intricate vestment gifts for the priests in her churches. She was accomplished and dedicated her life to the service of others, but she was so much more than that.\n\nHer sense of humor brought people closer. She absolutely loved teasing her husband; they made each other laugh nonstop. She was the best storyteller. Her kitchen was always open, she loved hosting and her cooking was the absolute best. She listened when you talked, she knew how to be an amazing friend. She kept her house beautifully decorated and at the same time, so welcoming. She loved with her whole being and never hesitated to tell you. She made us all feel like we were her favorite. She was a fantastic artist, sharing her sewing and crochet made her very happy. She had beautiful handwriting and was a skilled illustrator. Lucy was a friend to every baby, animal, hito, hita, and viejitos she ever met. Her collections were epic. So were her holiday decorations. She loved going out to eat. She loved popcorn. She took pride in her classy appearance, but her real beauty was not skin deep. She never judged, she never had an enemy, she forgave. Her deep spirituality was something to admire. Her hugs were so big. She made the world a better place.\n\nOn Tuesday, June 21, 2022, Lucy’s heart ran out of beats, and she gained her angel wings. She will go on in the hearts of the countless lives she's touched. We were all so incredibly blessed to know her, to love her, and to be loved by her.\n\nA Rosary will be held Monday June 27, 2022, at 6:00 p.m. at FRENCH – Lomas, 10500 Lomas Blvd NE. A Mass will be held Tuesday June 28, 2022, at 10:00 a.m. at St. Bernadette Catholic Church, 11509 Indian School Rd NE."
