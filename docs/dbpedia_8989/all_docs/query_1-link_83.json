        "text": "MusicRow was recently blessed with visits from not one, but two, family trios: Australian sisters The McClymonts, and the Anderton family members of Lucy Angel. The McClymonts played selections from their American debut Wrapped Up Good, including the title track (No. 38 on the CountryBreakout Chart this week) and “I Could Be A Cowboy.” The sisters will also have a segment airing on NPR’s Weekend Edition tomorrow (10/8) as well as an appearance on Fox & Friends October 16. Lucy Angel showcased songs from their self-titled EP, including CountryBreakout Top 30 single “Serious” and possible single contender “I’ll Be Your Whiskey.”"
