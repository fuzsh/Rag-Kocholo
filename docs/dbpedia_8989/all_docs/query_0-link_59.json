        "text": "“We wanted support from a doula after experiencing some difficulties with our antenatal midwifery care. We wanted someone to offer evidence based information and advocate for us when we weren't able to do this for ourselves. In addition to this we had read about the benefits of having a birth doula present during labour: reduced pain relief, reduced labour time and better birth experience.\n\nWe chose Lucy because she immediately instilled us with confidence. Lucy is caring, passionate and enthusiastic.\n\nLucy took time to explain the birthing process to us which we found really useful. She answered any questions we had and it was reassuring to know that there was someone there to speak to at the end of the phone on a 24 hour basis. She also lent us books and directed us to relevant information.\n\nLucy 's personality put us both at ease. She has a very calming influence. Lucy made practical suggestions to support pain management during labour. She empowered us by giving us information and by making sure we were fully informed and involved in all decisions in hospital care. It felt like we were a team.\n\nLucy is a unique lady who made us feel empowered and strong during pregnancy and birth. She was a guide, educator, friend and sister to us. It felt completely natural having her present at the birth of our daughter and we both feel, without a doubt, that her input improved our birth experience.\n\nWe would recommend Lucy to anyone pregnant in a heartbeat.”\n\n- SARa and SCott\n\nI felt so comfortable at my most vulnerable. Lucy puts all involved at ease; my midwives also commented how wonderful it was to have her here.\n\nWe had a home water birth and due to this being my first baby, this could have been incredibly scary but having wonderful Lucy by my side, encouraging me, supporting me and doing whatever was needed to help it go smoothly made me feel confident I could do it.\n\nNothing fazes Lucy and nothing is too much trouble.\n\nI will be eternally grateful to Lucy for being an important part of the birth of our darling daughter Saba. Her knowledge is endless. I highly recommend this beautiful lady as your doula!\"\n\n- alisa\n\n\"How can I even put this into words?! I'm going to attempt anyway... Thank you for everything you did to support me and Dave in the run up to labour, during labour and afterwards. Your role exceeded anything I could have imagined. Thank you for listening and helping me process ALL THE THINGS! Thank you for your wisdom and insight into things about me I would never have have clocked. This honestly doesn't do it justice. Just- thank you. You are truly, truly gifted in what you do. A champion of women, of community, of support and love. So much love and gratitude,\"\n\n- hannah and dave\n\nHannah has written beautifully about her preparation whilst pregnant and birth on her blog. I feature a bit so please do click through if you'd like to read more about how I work.\n\nShe was calm, gentle and instinctive, seeming to know exactly what I needed before I asked. She kept me focussed, relaxed, comfortable and, most importantly, looked after by someone with profound experience.\n\nQuite apart from the support she gave me, she also kept my husband calm, guiding and reassuring him, which, in turn, helped me, too. I chose to have a hospital birth. Lucy, drawing on her professional experience, knew exactly which questions to ask and what to push for in a fraught and sometimes difficult hospital environment.\n\nPostnatally, Lucy gave me invaluable advice and support in the crucial and daunting first few hours and days with our new baby– particularly around breastfeeding.I truly feel that we would have been at a loss without Lucy. After she arrived, everything seemed to turn around. I cannot recommend her highly enough.\"\n\n- Charlotte\n\n“We thought Lucy couldn’t possibly be as amazing as *Roz, but we were so utterly wrong. What a dream team these two ladies make! We found Lucy every bit as wonderful as Roz, deeply empathic, intelligent, supportive, kind and understanding with a huge generosity of spirit. She, like Roz, encouraged our absolute autonomy and decision making, whilst always ensuring we were fully aware of all our options. Always holding our hand, but letting us lead the way and supporting us as we developed the confidence to make the choices that felt right for us, sharing experience and information but never being directive. As the pregnancy progressed and I flailed around, ever more fuggyheaded, in unfamiliarly choppy tides of hormones, these ladies were a beacon, guiding me back to my agency, lighting the ways I chose to sail, keeping me afloat. They seemed to appear, like fairy godmothers, at the exact times we needed them most, with precisely the wisdom, calm, support, words, hugs, in fact exactly whatever it was we needed most in that particular moment – whatever bumps in the road we encountered they were always there for us -and the birth was no different… …yes, of course you can birth without a Roz or a Lucy, but if you can have them by your side, why wouldn’t you?”\n\n- Suzannah\n\n“Lucy had a very kind and giving nature throughout the process. She lent us and helped to set up the birth pool (and cleaned it afterwards!). She had an incredible calming influence on my wife and I during the birth and I am sure this contributed to a very successful birth. She visited regularly after the birth, reassuring me when I was worried about my wife’s lochia and recovery, giving sound information and plans of actions if I was worried things were getting worse rather than better. She took on household tasks so that we could concentrate on our toddler and new baby, we felt so well looked after. The thing I was most grateful for was that I had a very supportive friend with me throughout a challenging journey.”\n\n-David\n\n“Although it was so close to my due date, Lucy was fully involved and supportive towards my partner and I; we had two face to face meetings and kept in touch via text and email. Lucy sent us very useful and informative information about the birthing process and together we devised a birthing plan. Lucy was always very focused and empathic towards us, especially with regards to my first difficult birthing experience.\n\n...It was during the actual delivery that Lucy was so essential in making my birthing experience so good, it was her instructions to me (to breathe, to relax etc) that allowed me to give birth to our son. Afterwards, Lucy helped with getting breastfeeding started and helping me and our son get cleaned up. I haven’t been ‘put to bed’ since I was a little girl but Lucy did this for me as well! And she then cleaned out the birthing pool while we were fast asleep upstairs. The following morning, my daughter came into our bedroom to meet her new brother (which was what I had pictured happening!). Lucy still kept in touch, bringing us something to eat later that day and then having a couple of follow up visits/debriefs. I’m so pleased that Lucy was part of my birthing experience, I really don’t believe that I could have had such a successful experience without her being present and for this I am very grateful to her.”\n\n-Krista\n\n“Lucy was absolutely brilliant. I was planning a home birth but in the end chose to go into hospital for an induction after my waters had gone and 4 nights of nothing really happening. Lucy gave my partner and I superb support at our prenatal visits, so much useful information to prepare us and help us make decisions, then when my waters had broken we kept in contact the whole time and she gave me resources to look at to keep me in a positive state. During the birth at hospital she held the sacred space for me, and was a support to my husband and took over water, feeding and massage duties when he needed a rest. She was a brilliant moral support throughout as well giving me words of support just at the right moment, and afterwards she gave me an amazing massage. She also helped us unload the car at the hospital and load it up after so that my husband could concentrate on me. She was our birthing angel throughout. After the birth she continued her high level of support checking in on me making sure I wasn't doing too much and advising on breastfeeding. Lucy has a lovely light energy about her, and brightens up any situation, and has great humour as well as professionalism and is always on hand to help.”\n\n-Clare"
