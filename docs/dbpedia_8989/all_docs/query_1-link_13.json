        "text": "Press\n\nLucy Angel is a Triple Dose of Country Blonde\n\nReviewed by: Matt Herrick / nashvillecountryclub.com\n\nLucy Angel Self Titled EP GForce Records, Franklin, TN\n\nFirst glance at this three-headed 'blontourage' you might find yourself caught up in the flowing golden hair and striking sex appeal. But does this triple threat of country goodness make magic with their vocals and country talent? I think they deserve a good, unbiased listen to as there are some moments in this power-packed EP worthy of an iTunes playlist!\n\nProduced by talented Anthony Smith, this 5 track EP boasts some really nice moments. The EP starts off with 'Serious', with an up-tempo drive that blatantly contradicts the song title! The vocal quality of the intro tune is spot on but sports a very common country chorus. \"We're gonna paint it up/ We're gonna burn it down/ We're gonna party like we own this town!\" is an example of what to expect in this everyday country tune.\n\n'I'll Be Your Whiskey' reels me back in with a beautiful melody and haunting lyrics. Written with help from the hugely famous Hilary Lindsey who has teamed up with greats like Carrie Underwood ('Jesus Take the Wheel), Sara Evans (A Little Bit Stronger), Lady A (American Honey), and Taylor Swift (Fearless). This tune starts off with a gentle lead vocal as the rhythm section and great harmonies join shortly after. The song's message hints at domestic abuse with lyrics, \"I'll be the one you love to fight, when you're thirsty\". The album continues on with \"Only Women Left\" that is a carefree summer song that is perfectly tailored for a female vocal to sing along to. The tune gives me the feeling that if the Spice Girls were in country music, they would have cut this song! The chorus is perfect for girls taking a convertible joyride down a Tennessee interstate without a care in the world.\n\n\"Color Love Blue\" stands out as an album favorite for me as the harmonies in this tune stand out second to none to anything I have heard on this album. It's almost the girls were holding back in their first three songs and then really showed what they were all about in \"Color Love Blue\". Each flowing verse highlights a new and gorgeous harmony that shows me what this trio is capable of. The simple guitar from the start is just the right amount of instrumentation for the song. Lucy Angel showed me what they can do musically after hearing this tune.\n\nHonest at first, I couldn't get by the fact that these ladies' looks were outweighing their musical talents. After hearing their album, especially \"Color Love Blue\", I quickly readjusted my initial opinion of the 'blontourage' and can now see this attractive trio for what they can create using their gifts in country music.\n\nwww.lucyangel.com\n\nTootsieʼs Packed With New Talent, Famous Faces Throughout This Yearʼs CMA Music Festival\n\nShania Twain, Jerry Springer, Kellie Pickler Among\n\nCelebrity Onlookers\n\n(June 16, 2011) Everybody who was anybody and lots of nobodies who are going to be somebodies some day stopped in at Tootsieʼs Orchid Lounge during the 40th Annual CMA Music Festival.\n\nThe world-renowned Nashville honky tonk showcased live music non-stop on its two stages throughout the Festival, an annual event that draws tens of thousands of country music fans from around the planet.\n\nAmong the famous faces in the Tootsieʼs crowd were Shania Twain, Kellie Pickler, Country Music Hall of Fame member Mel Tillis, TV ringmaster Jerry Springer and John Chadwell from the History Channelʼs American Pickers series. Mark Herndon of Alabama, also a Country Music Hall of Famer, sat in on drums with Tootsieʼs house band when Fort Payne thrush Leah Seawright performed. Herndon now leads Seawrightʼs band.\n\nSeveral other rising acts generated huge applause, according to Tootsieʼs entertainment director, John Taylor.; Georgiaʼs sultry country/soul singer, Melanie Denard; 10-year old guitar prodigy, Jackson Capps. New Jerseyʼs queen of country, Sherry Lynn; hot West Virginia vocal trio, Taylor Made; the genre-blending Kentucky cover band, The Other Side of Midnight; and Tootsieʼs alumna and former RCA Records star, Crystal\n\nShawanda.\n\nAlso making their musical marks were Saddlebrook, Shelby Dressel, Chloe Litton, JOURDON Pace, Courtney Dickenson, Everett Lee & The Underground Stampede, Nathan Young, LANNDON , Morgan Frazier, Josh Black, John Stone, Kelsy Emma, Jordyn Mallory, Daniel Eagle, Kait Marsh, Tara Arender, Anthony Orio, Seth Tabor, Jake Maurer, Scott Collier, Amanda Ousley, LUK Nichols, Courtney Craig, Hollywood Yates, Heather Beeler, Steven West, Courtney Lynn, Lesley Crain, Mandy Layne & Lost Highway, Greg Hanna and The Boyle Brothers.\n\nThese included Lucy Angel, the eye-popping mother-and-daughters trio from Arizona that easily were the biggest draw with packed crowds every time they played.\n\n\"This is the best festival turnout we've had in years,\" says Taylor, who also notes that Tootsieʼs was packed from morning to night every day of the Festival.\n\nLUCY ANGEL ON THE MOVE -- ON THE GROUND, ON THE CHARTS AND ON THE TUBE\n\nNashville, TN (May 13, 2011) -- The triple threat trio, LUCY ANGEL have been moving at a radical pace these days. The music group, that consists of mother Kate and her two daughters Emily & Lindsay, have been on the road delivering their new single “Serious” to radio, where it’s gaining ground on the charts every week. This morning, on Friday, May 13, Lucy Angel made a stop in Chicago to introduce, to the massive television audience at WGN’s Morning Show, the charismatic stylings of their unique family band.\n\nWhile on the road visiting country radio stations across the country, Lucy Angel took a detour through the tornado ravaged town of Cullman, Alabama to help out a close family friend whose home was destroyed in the disaster. The vocalists were overcome with emotion at the site of the devastation. They presented gas cards to many of the now homeless neighbors, along with a commitment to the town’s mayor to lend their talents in any way to help the area re-build.\n\nLucy Angel’s striking good looks, natural talent and captivating personalities have not gone unnoticed by television executives in Hollywood. Next week the ladies will fly to Los Angeles, where the group will be taking part in meetings with several major cable networks to launch their own Lucy Angel reality show.\n\nThe new Lucy Angel single, “Serious” was written by hit-making songwriters Anthony Smith (George Strait, Tim McGraw), Chris Wallin (Toby Keith, Kenny Chesney) and David Lee Murphy (Blake Shelton, Brad Paisley). The up-tempo song can be heard at www.lucyangel.com, and kicks off the self-titled EP, LUCY ANGEL, which is available now on iTunes and amazon.com"
