        "text": "Lucy Angel are back with a fun new single, and they're letting Taste of Country readers hear it first in this audio exclusive.\n\nThe trio of mother Kate Anderton and her daughters, Lindsay and Emily Anderton, co-wrote the up-tempo pop-country song with their son and brother, Jake Anderton, along with Summer Overstreet. Noah Gordon produced the track, which pairs the trio's signature harmonies with an irresistible hook that will have you singing along by the time the second chorus lands.\n\nThe song's lyrics are a clever play on the familiar phrase Boyz II Men.\n\n\"All he's gonna do is waste your time / You know he's gonna make you lose your mind / And mess you up again and again / 'Cause you can't turn boys to men,\" they lament in an extremely catchy refrain.\n\nLucy Angel tell us the song is \"an upbeat and relevant 'Public Service Announcement' to girls about when it's time to call it quits.\"\n\n\"We've all 'had a friend' who's been in a relationship with a 'fixer-upper,' and as crazy stupid as you (I mean your friend might be) about a person, sometimes you're going to have to face the music and realize that you can't turn 'Boyz II Men,'\" they add. \"And if you were born before 1995, you're definitely gonna dig all the '90s references!\"\n\nThe trio released a well-received single, \"Crazy Too,\" in 2015, and their unique family business was the subject of a reality show called Discovering Lucy Angel on AXS TV. They currently chronicle their lives and career in a vlog series titled Life With Lucy Angel, and they also host a twice-weekly living room concert on Facebook Live called the Jammie Jam, an informal setting where they perform new music and covers, as well as interact with fans.\n\n\"Boyz II Men\" is one of a series of new songs Lucy Angel are set to release over the next few months. For more information about the group, visit their official website, or keep with Lucy Angel on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nMost Powerful Women in Country Music"
