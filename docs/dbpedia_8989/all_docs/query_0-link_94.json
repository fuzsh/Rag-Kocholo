        "text": "Lusia Harris, a powerful center who led the Delta State University women’s basketball team to three consecutive national championships in the mid-1970s and later entered the Basketball Hall of Fame as the first Black woman and the first female college player ever to be enshrined there, died on Tuesday in Mound Bayou, Miss. She was 66.\n\nHer daughter Crystal Stewart Washington confirmed the death, at a therapy facility, but said she did not know the cause. Harris lived in Greenwood, Miss.\n\nOne of women’s basketball’s most accomplished players, Harris was also the first woman to be officially drafted by an N.B.A. team, the New Orleans (now Utah) Jazz, although she said at the time that she did not think she could play at the level of professional male players.\n\nShe averaged 25.9 points and 14.4 rebounds a game at Delta State, in Cleveland, Miss., and also scored the opening points when women’s basketball was first played at the Olympics, in Montreal in 1976.\n\nHer Olympic teammate Pat Summitt, who went on to a Hall of Fame career as the women’s basketball coach at the University of Tennessee, described Harris, in her book “Sum It Up” (2013, with Sally Jenkins), as “the first truly dominant player of modern women’s basketball, 6-foot-3 and 185 hard-muscled pounds of pivoting, to-the-rim force.”\n\nHarris, known as Lucy, played at Delta State before the N.C.A.A. held a women’s basketball tournament (its first one was in 1982) and before major universities began to dominate the sport.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
