        "text": "Country Cruising has already announced the names of some of the artists that will be taking to the high seas in January 2017, with a trio of the hottest artists today – Kelsea Ballerini, LOCASH, and Chris Young, in addition to “Nashville” cast members Charles Esten and Clare Bowen, as well as longtime fan favorites Montgomery Gentry, Diamond Rio, Phil Vassar, and Halfway To Hazard. The cruise’s organizers continue to go the extra mile by providing a wide array of talent on the Brilliance of the Seas® with six of the top newcomers in the format being represented on the cruise – Lucas Hoge, Platinum-selling Canadian artist Dallas Smith, James Wesley, Olivia Lane, Lucy Angel and Australian act Viper Creek.\n\nThe musical journey of Lucas Hoge begins in his native state of Nebraska. His hometown consisted of forty-four people, and many of them donated money to the singer to make his way to Nashville. His song “If I Only Could” was featured on the hit TV show Smallville. He also written jingles for such companies as Lipton Tea and appeared with Faith Hill in the TV campaign for NBC’s Sunday Night Football. He wrote the title song and starred in the Animal Planet TV show Last Chance Highway, a reality show focused on rescuing dogs and transporting them to their forever homes. Hoge is currently in the studio working on his debut project for Rebel Engine and his debut single “Boom, Boom” will go for adds in July.\n\nArmed with an arena-sized voice Dallas Smith is one of the most successful Country singers from north of the border. The Vancouver, British Columbia native is the only Canadian Country Artist to have all of his 12 charted singles peak in the Top Ten including the multi-week #1 hit “Wastin’ Gas.” His album, Lifted, took home trophies from the JUNO Awards as well as the Canadian Country Music Awards for Album of the Year. Smith kicks off 2016 with the infectious new single “One Little Kiss”.

Influenced by such artists as Marty Robbins and Merle Haggard, the Broken Bow recording artist struck a chord with fans via his debut single “Jackson Hole,” and has landed on many “Ones to Watch” lists because of such follow-up singles as “Real,” “Didn’t I” and “Thank A Farmer.” His newest single is called “Hooked Up,” recorded in association with his sponsor, Calcutta Fishing.\n\nNamed to several 2016 “Artists To Watch” lists, Texas native Olivia Lane brings a youthful and vibrant approach to her music. A fan of many styles of music, Lane says she enjoys everything from Frank Sinatra to Katy Perry. That versatility shows up in her music. Her latest single, “Make My Own Sunshine,” is beginning to make an impact at radio stations across the United States, and she has shared the stage with such acts as Frankie Ballard and the incomparable Wynonna.\n\nConsisting of mother Kate and daughters Lindsay and Emily Anderton, the trio Lucy Angel made waves as they emerged onto the Country scene with debut single “Crazy Too.” Their self-titled album made its way to Walmart and Target shelves nationwide alongside the AXS TV premiere of their 13-episode docu-series, DISCOVERING LUCY ANGEL. No strangers to the road, the trio visited over 100 radio stations in the U.S. while “Crazy Too” soared up the Billboard/Mediabase chart and was named One of Tomorrows Hits by Billboard. The upbeat and lighthearted acclaimed single led them to headline shows coast to coast as well as open for artists including Jake Owen, Chris Young, Dustin Lynch, Kip Moore, Craig Campbell, Chris Janson, Big & Rich, Lauren Alaina, James Otto, A Thousand Horses, LoCash, The Swon Brothers and more. Also deemed Pepsi’s No. 1 Country Star Lighting Up 2015 Out of Nowhere, Lucy Angel was honored as the first Western/American act to ever sing at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China and “Crazy Too” found success in the UK, spending 6 weeks at No. 1 on the Hotdisc Chart. DISCOVERING LUCY ANGEL made it’s UK debut on SHOWBIZ TV in February and has garnered the trio a great deal of international media attention. Lucy Angel most recently performed on ABC’s hit romance reality show The Bachelor, which catapulted their digital sales landing them in the top 30 on the iTunes Country chart.\n\nHigh energy and boundless enthusiasm are what fans can expect from Australian band Viper Creek. Nominated for a pair of awards from the CMC (Country Music Channel) Awards, the four piece band has made their mark on the “land down under,” and are working on bringing their unique sound to American audiences. They have released three well-received albums, with their latest being Kickin’ Up Dust. A brand new album, Just Press Play, is slated for release in August.\n\nCountry Cruising will set sail on January 14, 2017 from Tampa, and will stop in Key West before making its’ voyage to Cozumel, Mexico. The ship will arrive back in Tampa on January 19. Country Cruising offers the Country Music fan an amazing experience – a five night cruise, with accommodations and all meals taken care of during the event, as well as autograph sessions, photo opportunities, daily musical performances, and songwriter workshops. The Brilliance of the Seas ship is a beautiful Radiance-class ship that combines sleek swiftness, panoramic vistas, and wide-open spaces. With acres of glass enclosing the nine-story central atrium, elevators facing the sea, and floor-to-ceiling windows throughout, guests never be at a loss for an incredible view.\n\nPricing begins at $1299 for interior rooms, and packages are also available with ocean and balcony views as well.\n\nFor more information about tickets and payment plans, visitwww.CountryCruising.com.\n\nNASHVILLE, Tenn.
