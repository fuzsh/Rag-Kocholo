Lucy Angel Camarena, a first generation Mexican-American whoâ€™s worked with global brands like New Balance and Don Julio Tequila, puts together wispy, natural-style arrangements that pay homage to her heritage and cultural identity. She also offers classes from time to time for those interested in learning how to arrange."
