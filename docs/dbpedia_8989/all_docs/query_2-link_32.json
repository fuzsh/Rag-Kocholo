The country music-themed series is set to air its 13-episode first season during SHOWBIZ TV’s Sunday night primetime programming block.\n\nDISCOVERING LUCY ANGEL follows the mother-daughter trio Lucy Angel and their family, the Andertons, as they work together to launch their music career in Nashville. The docu­-series captures the ups and downs of the family members’ lives as they make a name for themselves in country music. It follows the endearing group while on the road, and looks in on family life at their home in Franklin, Tennessee.\n\nThe cast includes daughters Lindsay, Emily and their mother Kate Anderton, who together comprise the trio Lucy Angel; also featured are father and band manager Doug (aka G-Man); sons Fletcher and Jake; hit songwriter Anthony Smith; Anthony and Lindsay’s daughter, McCartney; and the family’s two beloved dogs, Faith and Hope.\n\nIn the debut episode, the Anderton family members rehearse and prepare for the biggest performance of their career to date: a live concert at the Pocono Raceway.\n\n“We are thrilled to have acquired the rights to this ground-breaking Country-themed series,” said Kevin Petillo, ShowBiz TV’s Head of Acquisitions.\n\n“We look forward to a long and fruitful partnership with the producers of DISCOVERING LUCY ANGEL, as we develop and expand our Country programming.”\n\nLucy Angel emerged onto the country music scene with their acclaimed debut single “Crazy Too,” staging them as one of tomorrow’s supergroups. The upbeat and lighthearted tune from their self-titled album soared up the Billboard/Mediabase charts while the trio toured the U.S. headlining and opening shows for artists such as Jake Owen, Chris Young, Dustin Lynch, Kip Moore, Craig Campbell, Chris Janson, Big & Rich and more.\n\nDISCOVERING LUCY ANGEL is produced by Taylored TV and Eggplant TV. The series is executive-produced and directed by Emmy® Award-winning television producer JT Taylor, who is known for producing the original hit reality television series The Osbournes from 2002.\n\nABOUT SHOWBIZ TV\n\nShowBiz TV is a British channel delivering broad-spectrum entertainment content nationwide.
