        "text": "Lucy Liu worked with Cameron Diaz and Drew Barrymore on the silver screen as a crime-fighting team – but off screen, Liu says she was verbally \"attacked\" by co-star Bill Murray.\n\nLiu's role as Alex Munday saw her as one-third of the woman-powered spy team in the 2000 movie \"Charlie's Angels\" and its 2003 sequel. The 52-year-old actress opened up about the encounter during a Tuesday episode of Los Angeles Times' \"Asian Enough\" podcast.\n\nLiu recounted a weekend rehearsal where Murray was absent, revealing that when he realized a specific scene was reworked while he was gone, the now-70-year-old actor who played John Bosley in the film began to \"hurl insults\" at the actress.\n\n\"I couldn’t believe that (the comments) could be towards me, because what do I have to do with anything majorly important at that time? I literally do the look around my shoulder thing, like, 'Who is he talking to behind me?' \" Liu said.\n\nLucy Liu reveals the significance of her 'Charlie's Angels' role: It 'normalized Asian identity'\n\nLiu said she asked Murray if he was talking to her, after which the insults evolved into a one-on-one confrontation.\n\n\"Some of the language was inexcusable and unacceptable, and I was not going to just sit there and take it. So, yes, I stood up for myself, and I don’t regret it,\" Liu said.\n\nUSA TODAY has reached out to Murray's reps for comment.\n\nLiu said though she was the last actress cast and had the \"least amount of privilege\" on set, it didn't excuse Murray's words.\n\n\"No matter how low on the totem pole you may be or wherever you came from, there’s no need to condescend or to put other people down,\" Liu said. \"I would not stand down, and nor should I have.\"\n\nLiu said some of her confidence may have stemmed from childhood, witnessing others being condescending toward her mother because of her mom's language barrier. Experiences like that made her stand up for her \"self-respect,\" she said.\n\n\"No matter what happens between now and whatever career choices I make or whatever life decisions I make, I will walk away with my dignity,\" she said.\n\nMore: 'An amazing sight to behold': CW's 'Kung Fu' debuts at crucial time for Asian American community\n\nLiu has also been transparent about the dignity her role in \"Charlie's Angels\" provided for the Asian community. In an op-ed she wrote in April for the Washington Post, the actress detailed how she didn't want to be cast \"in 'typically Asian' roles because they reinforce stereotypes.\"\n\nLiu said her role made an impact.\n\n\"As part of something so iconic, my character &mldr; normalized Asian identity for a mainstream audience and made a piece of Americana a little more inclusive,\" she wrote.\n\nContributing: Jenna Ryu"
