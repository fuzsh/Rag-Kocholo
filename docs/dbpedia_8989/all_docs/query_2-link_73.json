        "text": "My wife, our Mother, Grandma, Sister, Aunt, and Friend was called home on August 20, 2012. Our Mother was born on March 8, 1949 in Pagosa Junction, Colorado to Juan and Delfina Martinez. I, Lorenzo Garcia, married the love of my life on June 10, 1967. From this wedding we have four beautiful children: Chauntelle Garcia, Nichole (Jose) Martinez, Lori and Fernando Garcia. Grandma loved to spoil us - Julian, Jaime, and Anthony J. Padilla; Jose Martinez; and Dallas Garcia. She would do anything for us and her three great-grandchildren. She couldn't wait to do the same for her future granddaughter. Our sister was very dear and special to us - Chris (Olivia) Martinez, Jean (Don) Chavez, Kenneth Martinez, Dorothy (Doug) Reed, and Anthony (Gina) Martinez. She is preceded in death by her parents; in-laws Celestino and Corina Garcia; brother Rudy; sisters Flora and Mary; and sisters-in-law Priscilla, Carmella and Delores. She especially loved Asnncion Garcia. Our friend , Lucy, will be dearly missed by the numerous people she has touched, especially Virginia, her Little Angel Lola and by her many Bingo friends. My Mother, Wife, Grandma, loved crafts, porcelain dolls, Native American decor and anything Southwestern. Two of the things she loved most is playing bingo and gambling in Wendover and Mesquite . Mom also loved to read. Rosary and Mass will be held at St. Joseph's Catholic Church at 9:30 am on August 27, 2012"
