        "text": "If you're looking for something saucy and fresh to feast your eyes on, I'm taking on a 100 Design Challenge! While I can‚Äôt guarantee a design every day, I‚Äôm dedicated to crafting soul-led designs to stoke my creative fire üëº If you ever find yourself thinking, \"I just want to create art,\" remember that you always have the power to do just that. Being paid for something doesn't define the value of your work. Make space, find the time, and create for yourself üåô If you want to follow along or use my challenge as accountability for your own project then come join me at -https://lnkd.in/g3GM33jU Featured design is 2/100, No Choice Without Sacrifice üêâ\n\nKia ora koutou whƒÅnau, WHAT‚ÄôS GOOD! 2023 felt like an evolution in so many ways, preparing for the transition to make some mad moves in 2024. After 3+ years of rolling with the VUWSA crew, it‚Äôs time for me to ride solo. VUWSA has been an epic space to cultivate my skills, expand my passion and form solid connections with some SICK people. So what‚Äôs next? WE‚ÄôRE GOING FULL-TIME FREELANCE BABY üèÅ I‚Äôve already been working part-time freelance alongside VUWSA but the time feels right to make things ‚ú®official‚ú® and become full-time. I‚Äôve put together a cheeky website with a portfolio of my design and photography work (painting coming soon) so feel free to procrastinate your Friday work and go have a scroll ü§† My books are open for branding, graphic design, content creation, photography and pretty much everything in between so if you‚Äôre cooking up a project that needs some out-the-gate visuals then GET IN TOUCH NOW üëº https://lnkd.in/gs4cUcVW\n\nIt's 2023 and you all know it wouldn't be me if I hadn't been hectic busy over the summer. This year, something extra special was adding to the hecticness but also getting me so excited I've been bursting at the seams. For those who don't know Lexi, they are my twin flame, my matching pair of checkered sunglasses and the person you have probably overheard me laughing with from a mile away. Our yarns are constantly started with \"what if\" and \"can you imagine\" followed by wild ideas and dreams of the world we want to make. From this, there was one idea that we both stopped and said \"wait, I think we could really do this\". After individually seeking ways to utilise our menagerie of skills we decided to combine our power and Gooey was born. Gooey is our sticky, fresh and juicy creative outlet. We will use this platform to educate, elevate and inspire the entrepreneurs of Aotearoa and inject some flavour into the business world. Gooey is a creative studio specialising in Branding, Strategy and Design. Over the next year, we'll be working to build our portfolio as freelancers and we'll be ready to launch as a full, service-based business in early 2024. In the future, we will be expanding into new and exciting ventures so for now go give us a follow, connect and see where this journey takes us!\n\nVUWSA 2022 Student Orientation Guide üìì As we bury our eyes in pixels and bitterly self-critique it can often be challenging to take notice of the milestones in our journey. Just over a year ago I signed a 3 month contract at VUWSA, was shown the 2021 O-Week branding and asked to have a wall planner, notebook designs and an O-Guide (amongst other things) print ready in 2 weeks üôÄ 12 months, 1 lockdown and 5 contract extensions later I can proudly show you the VUWSA 2022 Student O-Guide, designed from head to toe by VUWSA's permanent in-house designer, Lucy Angel Egan üëº I guess this can be a reminder that if you aren't proud of your progress then you'll never enjoy the journey. I definitely have a long way to go and I'm absolutely clueless as to what could happen in the next 12 months but I can't fucking wait üí• Full design here: Behance - https://lnkd.in/ghEasz_b Issu - https://lnkd.in/gCQKBYCx #design #branding #designer #printdesign #bookletdesign #typography #graphicdesign #aotearoa #studentguide"
