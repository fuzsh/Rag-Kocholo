        "text": "Lucy H. Fritz, age 94, formerly of Plymouth Meeting, PA, passed away on Sunday, October 3, 2021 at St. Joseph Villa in Flourtown, PA.\n\nShe was born in Philadelphia, PA on July 6, 1927, the daughter of the late Thomas and Josephine Loughran.\n\nLucy was a parishioner of St. Paul's RC Church of East Norriton.\n\nShe was the wife of the late Charles J. \"Binky\" Fritz.\n\nShe is survived by two daughters, Karen (& Bill) Lee and Charlene (& Sal) Lombardo; daughter in-law, Deborah Fritz; 6 grandchildren, Briana (Sean), Eric (Patty), Daria, Justin (Lydia), Sal Jr. “Tore” (Rachel), Alyssa; 3 great-grandchildren Kayla, Ryan and Mila.\n\nAlong with her husband and parents, she was preceded in death by her daughter, Lucy Ann Fritz; and son, Charles J. Fritz, Jr. She was the last surviving sibling of 13 from the Loughran family.\n\nLucy was a sweet, caring, loving and special person who loved everyone around her, even people she just met. Her greatest joy was her family. She loved to watch Shirley Temple movies and play Bingo and Rummikub. She will always be remembered for her smile, bright blue eyes, sense of humor, and sweet personality. She was supportive to anyone who needed her, despite the obstacles she was facing in her own life. Her faith was strong and her love of God helped her daily especially after losing her daughter, husband, and most recently, her son. Lucy will be forever loved, forever missed, and forever in our hearts.\n\n“I hope you’re dancing in the sky. And I hope you’re singing in the angel’s choir. I hope the angels know what they have. I’ll bet it’s so nice up in Heaven since you arrived.”\n\nHer Funeral Mass will be held on Thursday, October 7, 2021 at 10:00 AM from St. Paul's RC Church, 2007 New Hope St. Norristown, PA 19401.\n\nRelatives and friends are invited to the viewing on Thursday morning from 9:00 AM to 9:50 AM at the Church.\n\nInterment will be private."
