        "text": "Credit: Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock\n\nKim Kardashian, Jimmy Fallon and More Celebrities Who Used Surrogates\n\nPursuing surrogacy! Lance Bass and more celebrities have brought babies into the world with the help of gestational carriers. The singer and Michael Turchin became parents to twins in October 2021 — but the couple spent three years trying to start their family. The former 'NSync member first told Us Weekly exclusively in March 2018 that he wanted a baby with his artist husband within the year, saying, \"I don't think anyone is really prepared to have kids. I think you just have to go with the flow. ... We have tons of friends who have gone through the process. We're interviewing everyone.” In January of the following year, the Out of Sync author exclusively told Us that they were “on donor No. 7.” The Mississippi native explained at the time: \"I think we broke a record with how many donors we’ve gone through. But it’s looking like this next one is actually going to work. We’re being cautious.” Bass told Us in March 2020 that the “heartbreaking” IVF attempt had not worked, explaining, \"We have tons of friends that are doing IVF, and it was definitely consoling to know that they all went through the same thing we went through. It’s just disappointing. You work so hard for this, you get pregnant and weeks later, it doesn’t stick. But to know that some of your friends have gone through the same thing, you feel like you’re a part of this family. It just makes you feel a little more normal.” [sendtonews type=\"float\" key=\"5DTyrMSI1g-2838227-14453\"] The Dancing With the Stars alum felt that he and the Florida native had “reset” and were prepared to try again. In June 2021, the pair announced via Instagram that they had a son and daughter on the way. “Coming soon,” the couple wrote at the time. While awaiting their little ones, Bass exclusively told Us that their “10th donor was the one that worked.” The ups and downs brought the actor and Turchin “closer together,” he added in August 2021. \"I didn’t think that we could love each other more and have a bigger bond, but when you go through an experience of trying to start a family and it's just not working, it could either tear you apart or bring you closer together. … It was quite the journey.\" From Kim Kardashian and Kanye West to Jimmy Fallon and his wife, Nancy Juvonen, scroll down for details on more famous families who have welcomed their little ones via surrogacy.\n\nCredit: ZUMAPRESS/MEGA\n\nTara Lipinski and Todd Kapostasy\n\nLipinski revealed in August 2023 that she and her husband \"seemingly hit every roadblock imaginable\" while attempting to start a family, noting via Instagram that the couple had tried to conceive for five years. \"It has been an excruciatingly painful journey that has been filled with loss & dealing with the grief that comes along with that. We are lucky to have the ability to make our embryos but pregnancy is another story,\" she wrote.\n\nThe pair started a podcast titled \"Tara Lipinski: Unexpecting\" to share more about their path to parenthood. In October 2023, Lipinski announced that she and Kapostasy were expecting their first baby via surrogate. Daughter Georgie arrived later that month.\n\nCredit: Broadimage/Shutterstock\n\nJamie Chung and Bryan Greenberg\n\nThe Gotham actress and One Tree Hill alum welcomed twin boys via surrogacy in October 2021 — a decision that stemmed heavily from the pressures put on women in the entertainment industry.\n\n\"I was terrified of becoming pregnant. I was terrified of putting my life on hold for two-plus years,\" the Lovecraft Country star revealed to Today Parents in June 2022. \"In my industry, it feels like you're easily forgotten if you don't work within the next month of your last job. Things are so quickly paced in what we do. So it's a compromise that we made together as a couple.\"\n\nChung said that while “people will probably think, ‘Oh, she’s so vain,’” the decision to have a baby via surrogate is actually a lot more complicated than that. “I worked my ass off my entire life to get where I am,” she said. \"I don't want to lose opportunities. I don't want to be resentful.\"\n\nCredit: Charles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images\n\nAndy Cohen\n\nThe Real Housewives producer revealed in December 2018 that he hired a surrogate to carry his child. “I want you to be the first to know that after many years of careful deliberation, fair amount of prayers and the benefit of science, if all goes according to plan, in about six weeks time, I’m going to become a father thanks to a wonderful surrogate who is carrying my future,” Cohen told Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen viewers at the time, noting that family is “everything” to him.\n\nCohen welcomed his son, Benjamin Allen, in February 2019. The TV host surprised fans in April 2022 when he announced the arrival of his second child, a baby girl named Lucy, via a surrogate. “Thank you to my rock star surrogate (ALL surrogates are rockstars, by the way) and everyone who helped make this miracle happen. I’m so happy,” he wrote via Instagram at the time.\n\nCredit: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP/Shutterstock\n\nAnderson Cooper and Benjamin Maisani\n\n“I am grateful to a remarkable surrogate who carried Wyatt and watched over him lovingly, and tenderly, and gave birth to him,” the CNN anchor captioned photos with his newborn son in April 2020. “It is an extraordinary blessing — what she, and all surrogates give to families who cant have children. My surrogate has a beautiful family of her own, a wonderfully supportive husband and kids, and I am incredibly thankful for all the support they have given Wyatt and me. My family is blessed to have this family in our lives.”\n\nIn February 2022, the CNN anchor announced the arrival of his second son with ex Benjamin Maisani via gestational carrier, gushing, \"He mostly just sleeps and eats, and he certainly poops, but he already seems like a wise and thoughtful little chap.”\n\nCredit: Nils Jorgensen/Shutterstock\n\nAmber Heard\n\nIn July 2021, Us Weekly confirmed the actress welcomed a daughter, Oonagh Paige. She later confirmed the news via Instagram. \"Four years ago, I decided I wanted to have a child. I wanted to do it on my own terms. I now appreciate how radical it is for us as women to think about one of the most fundamental parts of our destinies in this way. I hope we arrive at a point in which it’s normalized to not want a ring in order to have a crib,\" Heard wrote at the time. \"A part of me wants to uphold that my private life is none of anyone’s business. I also get that the nature of my job compels me to take control of this. My daughter was born on April 8, 2021. Her name is Oonagh Paige Heard. She’s the beginning of the rest of my life.\"\n\nCredit: Chris Chew/UPI/Shutterstock\n\nLucy Liu\n\nThe proud mom welcomed her son in August 2015. \"I can confirm that Lucy Liu is the proud mother of Rockwell Lloyd Liu, brought into the world via gestational carrier,\" a rep for the actress told Us Weekly at the time. \"Mom and baby are healthy and happy.\"\n\n“I didn’t have a plan. I just thought, ‘I want to change the conversation a little bit.’ I didn’t want to talk about the next project. I felt like I was reading the same script. I got tired of it.
