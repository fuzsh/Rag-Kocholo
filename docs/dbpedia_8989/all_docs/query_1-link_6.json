        "text": "Consisting of mother Kate and daughters Lindsay and Emily Anderton, the trio Lucy Angel made waves as they emerged onto the Country scene with debut single “Crazy Too.” Their self-titled album made its way to Walmart and Target shelves nationwide alongside the AXS TV premiere of their 13-episode docu-series, DISCOVERING LUCY ANGEL. No strangers to the road, the trio visited over 100 radio stations in the U.S. while “Crazy Too” soared up the Billboard/Mediabase chart and was named One of Tomorrows Hits by Billboard. The upbeat and lighthearted acclaimed single led them to headline shows coast to coast as well as open for artists including Jake Owen, Chris Young, Dustin Lynch, Kip Moore, Craig Campbell, Chris Janson, Big & Rich, Lauren Alaina, James Otto, A Thousand Horses, LoCash, The Swon Brothers and more. Also deemed Pepsi’s No. 1 Country Star Lighting Up 2015 Out of Nowhere, Lucy Angel was honored as the first Western/American act to ever sing at the Great Hall of the People in Beijing, China and “Crazy Too” found success in the UK, spending 6 weeks at No. 1 on the Hotdisc Chart. DISCOVERING LUCY ANGEL is slated to make its UK debut on SHOWBIZ TV beginning in February."
