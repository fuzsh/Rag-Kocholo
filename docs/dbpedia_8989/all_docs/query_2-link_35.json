        "text": "I was born in 1963, in Sachs Harbour. When I was one, my family moved to Ulukhaktok, where my mother was from. I have lived here ever since.\n\nI learned to sew when I was really small, five or six years old. I learned by watching my mother, she taught me how to sew duffle liners for kamiks. Just a little at a time, she didn’t ever rush me.\n\nAs my ancestors before me, I don’t own a sewing machine. I sew all my creations by hand and waste very little material. If I can make something from it, I will. I usually make my own patterns and work mostly with sealskin, making things like wall hangings, mitts, and other crafts such as angel treetops and sealskin ookpiks (owls). I can usually get four pairs of mitts out of a sealskin pelt, and then use the left over pieces for other crafts. I also like to sew using Melton wool but sometimes it’s hard to buy locally so I order it online from Winnipeg. I like sewing for the sake of sewing and because it’s relaxing.\n\nI’d love to see my work in a gallery one day, and I have one of my wall hangings in the Prince of Wales Heritage Center in Yellowknife. One piece I have made it all the way to Rome, Italy! I am really happy about that. It was so exciting. I never imagined anything I made would get that far."
