        "text": "Country Radio Seminar (CRS) is a gold mine for publicity and making connections. Groups like Lucy Angel are making the rounds with the media at their tail clambering for interviews, radio and TV spots as well as the ever present fan photo. This is a great jump start to a radio tour with so many communicators in one place.\n\nLucy Angel is the combined forces of Kate, Lindsay and Emily Anderson, three talented, entertaining and brilliantly focused individuals. Kate, mother to Lindsay and Emily, passed her talent and her love to her daughters and so Lucy Angel was born. Their single, “Only Woman Left,” is at radio now!\n\nThe ladies of Lucy Angel stopped for interviews with stations like KZBQ out of Pocatello, Idaho where they shared their heart, music, and story. In addition to interviews, artists often add a live showcase to their CRS line-up so that the radio ears in town can have a first-hand take on their talent and fall in love.\n\nFriday night, the showcase for Lucy Angel will be at 10:30pm at 12th and Porter. The last night of CRS will be just getting started. Don’t miss this vocal group – you will not be let down!"
