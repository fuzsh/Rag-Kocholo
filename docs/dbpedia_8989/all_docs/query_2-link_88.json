        "text": "Protected by Angels is a story about a teenager, Lucy Wells, who can see into the spirit realm, and often sees demons that she refers to as shadow creatures as they assault others. Although highly unusual, she also sees and talks to her guardian angel who was assigned to protect Lucy from birth. Neither she nor her guardian angel knows Lucy has a higher purpose, a legacy of faith passed down to her from her grandmother, and that demons are determined to stop her from realizing that mission at all costs. The demonic determination and her guardian's assignment to protect her from the enemy will take them on a harrowing journey into the unknown world of human sex trafficking, murder and running for her life.\n\nProtected by Angels is not a story about new-age angels who come and go at Lucy's commands. This inspiring story is about a young girl who learns to trust God and discovers her reason for existence in the process. The heavenly angels are often in conflict with the demons of darkness as they try to thwart God's plan for Lucy's life. Throughout the book, the angelic forces of Heaven's armies protect and defend Lucy and her family from demonic attack and from demon-motivated/possessed people with intent to harm them."
