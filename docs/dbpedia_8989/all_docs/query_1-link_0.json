        "text": "Up and coming, Nashville-based, country band Lucy Angel consists of mother Kate Anderton and her daughters Lindsay and Emily. After playing gigs across the world, Lucy Angel are putting themselves out there with new single Crazy Too and a brand new documentary that will look at the highs and lows of their growing musical career. Maverick found out more‚Ä¶\n\nHow did Lucy Angel begin?\n\nKate Anderton: Well I guess it all started when a farm boy and an army brat fell in love in college, got married and had four kids. The girls grew up singing with me in different projects so forming a band was kind of inevitable. The three of us have been singing together as Lucy Angel since we moved to Nashville.\n\nWho has influenced you the most musically and how would you describe your sound?\n\nKate Anderton: Being three individuals who have been known to share a ‚Äúcommon brain‚Äù we have a lot of influences. I grew up listening to The Beatles, Carole King, and opera thrown in from my father. My love of country music started with listening to standards from Willie, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette and Brenda Lee. Collectively, we love everyone from Michael Jackson to Garth Brooks, Adele, the Dixie Chicks, Huey Lewis, Ronnie Milsap, Reba, Trisha Yearwood, Sheryl Crow and Shania. Our sound is driven by close harmonies, strong melodies and honest lyrics that we hope everyone can relate to. We know the three of us can üôÇ\n\nHow long have you been chasing your musical dreams?\n\nLindsay Anderton: It‚Äôs truly been a lifetime in the making. In 2003 we decided if we really wanted to make this dream of singing country music a reality we had to move from our home in Phoenix, AZ to Nashville, TN. Music is what we do, who we are and why we are still here.\n\nWhat is it like to work with your family?\n\nLindsay Anderton: If you‚Äôve ever seen the movie ‚ÄòChristmas Vacation‚Äô it‚Äôs like that but all year long.\n\nThe honest truth is that we are all best friends and would not have it any other way. It‚Äôs pretty unique and special to be able to share these experiences as a family. Naturally, as with any family there are some bumps in the road but luckily we all have a sense of humour and that‚Äôs how we survive.\n\nHow did the TV series ‚ÄòDiscovering Lucy Angel‚Äô come about?\n\nEmily Anderton: J.T. Taylor (Creator of hit TV show ‚ÄòThe Osbournes‚Äô) which followed Ozzy Osbourne and his family and Terry Tompkins (Eggplant Productions) saw some of our YouTube videos. After they flew out to Nashville to meet the family and hear us sing we filmed a sizzle reel. The show was picked up and we started filming the 13 episode series a few months later. J.T. said it best ‚ÄúI thought that the story of this incredibly likeable, funny and talented all-American family struggling to make it in the music business was a story worth telling.‚Äù\n\nWhat‚Äôs been the highlight of your career so far?\n\nEmily Anderton: It was definitely surreal being the first Western Hemisphere act to sing at the Great Hall of The People in Beijing, China. It is mind blowing that on the opposite side of the world there are such huge country music fans. We‚Äôre also pretty sure it was the first time Cowboy boots set foot in the Great Hall.\n\nWhat do you have planned next?\n\nEmily, Lindsay and Kate Anderton: We are so excited for 2016! Coming off the success of our single Crazy Too we are gearing up for the next single release to radio early spring. We‚Äôll be touring the US and can‚Äôt wait to get back for some shows in Europe and the UK.\n\n‚ÄòDiscovering Lucy Angel‚Äô premieres February 14 on Showbiz TV ‚Äì Sky 266 @ 7.30pm\n\nTheir album LUCY ANGEL is released on February 19.\n\nPhoto: Jake Anderton"
