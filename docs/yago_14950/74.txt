Joe McStravick - DIRECTOR SHOWREEL 2024 - Big thank you to everyone who worked on these films with me - there are far too many names to mention, without writing a post which is the length on an essay. Thank you to all of you, let's work together again soon. #director #showreel #film #shortfilm #TV https://lnkd.in/e2Ub2naf

The last 10 months have been tough for me, and for many other people in the creative industries. Every time I feel frustrated, helpless, lost or isolated I remind myself how lucky I am to have these two lads to keep me smiling and focused on what’s important - family comes first! I love being a dad!❤️ If you having similar feelings, or worse, then do yourself a favour and reach out to friends, family or others who you can talk to.

OPPORTUNITIES” - Development Schemes and Residencies - On behalf of those of us who are struggling financially in the creative industries at this time I would like to point out - We cannot afford to take up any of the above “opportunities” because covering expenses does not pay the bills, the bills which we are already struggling to pay. You may attract a number of middle-class applicants but working-class creatives cannot afford to avail of unpaid “opportunities”! Arts and funding organisations need to look at the consequences of the cost of living crisis AND the cuts to arts funding because artists and creative practitioners are struggling. You need to offer expenses AND an artist fee. I just saw three more of these, so called, opportunities this morning, it’s a joke. #arts #funding #film #TV #VR #visualarts #unpaid
