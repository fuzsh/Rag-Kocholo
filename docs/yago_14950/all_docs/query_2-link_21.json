        "text": "Theatre and cultural hub Accidental Theatre completed a recent report on small arts business best practice during the pandemic and beyond. Addressing pressing concerns for artists and practitioners in a time of isolation and the loss of potential revenue from live events, Accidental Theatre, with Tickle Productions and Aisling Productions with financial support from Future Screens NI sought in their research to find best practice techniques to monetise digital performance. Looking at a range of options including but not limited to streaming live shows, Accidental Theatre and their partners sought methods of engagement with audiences through a broadcast programme of live events, therefore distancing the practice from standard streaming platforms. The project sought alternative and more direct audience engagement than the passive viewing experiences of leading streaming platforms. Working with artists, festivals and other partners over a period across 2020/21 the project focused on three main case studies of One-off sales, Memberships, and Donations as potential revenue streams. The report addresses three issues of particular interests to small businesses and sole traders such as a lack of monetisation options, streaming market competition and the devaluation of artistic content. The conclusions drawn from the case studies were that a mix of subscription and one-off sales will likely be the most accessible option for companies and sole artists.\n\nThe project was funded in-part by Future Screens NI’s Rewriting the Narrative Award.\n\nFor more information on Accidental Theatre follow the link: https://accidentaltheatre.co.uk\n\nKey Personnel\n\nAccidental Theatre was founded in 2012 to develop an exciting brand of modern Northern Irish theatre.

Glove Play Pain Relief is a state of the-art technology sensor infused glove, which has been developed to analyze the movement of hand, wrist and fingers, in order to detect and measure joint stiffness.\n\nActionSense have developed a cost-effective efficient sensor system for the monitoring of exercise and rehabilitation of rheumatology patients remotely at home. Most arthritic patients suffer with pain, swelling and stiffness but current outcomes tend to focus on pain and swelling as opposed to stiffness. Where clinicians have sought to measure joint movement in arthritic patients, they continue to rely on manual goniometry. This however is widely seen as having fundamental deficiencies in terms of accuracy, time taken and lack of adaptability.\n\nActionSense are utilising gaming technology to enhance their gloves as a form of pain relief, to distract from pain during clinically prescribed home exercise routines. Through this unique provision of tailored computer games ActionSense can enhance engagement and completion of prescribed exercises using gamified processes and tasks to aid motivation. Their unique provision adds 3D graphics to augment the presentation of feedback and continuous real-time visualization of clinical data.\n\nKey Personnel\n\nProfessor Condell. Joan is Co- founder and CEO of Action Sense and Professor in Intelligent Technologies at the Intelligent Systems Research Centre at Ulster University.

In 2017 ALT Animation optioned an idea for an animated series from children’s author and music expert Ann Bryant.\n\nWorking with Ann and Mark Gordon of Score Draw Music, ALT have developed the idea into The Hearios, a property with true international appeal which promises to couple compelling animated content with a very valuable message for a modern pre-school audience.\n\nIn order to make The Hearios stand out from its competitors, ALT are proposing to bolster their current proposition by carrying out user testing with their target audience, in collaboration with QUB, to provide information about the existing listening skills and vocabulary of pre-schoolers and how they are affected by the central premise of the show. The series has been designed to improve children’s active listening skills which have been shown to assist with their development in areas such as speech, language skills and memory. ALT propose to carry out some user testing in order to establish the effectiveness of the show in capturing children’s attention to the sounds presented and their development of a vocabulary of sounds. Educational aspects of a series are of huge importance to broadcasters, especially public service broadcasters who have a particular remit to inspire and educate their audiences.\n\nAcademic Collaborators\n\nDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, many of the most vulnerable people faced increased isolation, resulting in decreased opportunities for social interaction and physical activity - so vital for good mental and physical wellbeing. In addition, local artists and makers faced a loss of income and significant negative impact on their small businesses, due to closure of physical premises, local markets and craft fairs.\n\nThe act of creating something, and our and others, appreciation of it, provides an experience that can have positive effects on our physical and mental health. The current situation demands that opportunities to participate in, and connect with others through creative activities need to be made easily available, affordable and accessible. With that in mind, and with the support of Future Screens NI, Makers House at the Designerie Bushmills have created “The Makers Series”.\n\nFunded by Future Screens NI- ‘Rewriting the Narrative’- The Maker’s Series comprises eight, easily accessible and free ‘virtual’ workshops, led by established local artists/makers, allowing those most in need to engage in creative activities and connect with others. The workshops introduce crafters, makers and artists to a range of traditional crafts and art forms that they may already be familiar with, but have not engaged with for some time (weaving, macrame) and new crafts and arts forms they may not have tried before (photography, needle felting, paper crafts). Each of the workshops will encourage viewers to explore their talent, through expansion and extension of learned skills, and to continue to develop and to express themselves creatively in their own time. All workshops feature clear audio and visual instructions and will also provide the option of free downloads of user friendly, printed instructions, featuring full colour photographs of each step.\n\nClíona Ni Bhuachalla of Icebox Films is award-winning feature film and TV drama producer with extensive credits including the Award-winning feature documentary “Seamus Heaney: Out of the Marvellous, Legend and The Clinic.

It is currently in early pre-production with an anticipated filming date of 7th September 2020.\n\nClíona will be moderating and observing the Puttnam Scholarship Programme on behalf of Future Screens NI and NI Screen."
