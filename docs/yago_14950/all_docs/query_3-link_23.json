His community is threatened by agro-livestock companies that are taking over their territory. Since a while his goats have been dying and he doesn’t know why. In between assemblies and roadblocks, Martín must decide whether to respond to the black tree’s call or not...\n\nThis film is part of a combined programme with: As if the king."
