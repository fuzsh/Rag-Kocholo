        "text": "It is Quiet Here.\n\nDirector - Olena Podolianko, Novruz Hikmet\n\n13 min.\n\nUkraine\n\nA young couple is torn from the world for one long night in a hotel room in a town near the border. That night they agreed not to talk about the war. Completely lost in each other' s small world, they don't realize when the morning comes and force them to go back to reality.\n\nLuteal\n\nDirector - Hilary Williams\n\n16 min.\n\nChicago\n\nOne year after a woman’s partner dies of leukemia, she decides to have their child on her own through insemination. But maybe she’s not as alone as she thinks.\n\nThe Gift\n\nDirector - Elizabeth Love\n\n11 min.\n\nChicago\n\nThe Gift is a documentary style short film sharing the perspectives of 10 young Chinese American women, who were adopted from China from 1998 to 2001 during China’s one-child policy, which was implemented in 1979 and discontinued in 2016. These women were adopted into families who traveled together initially in 1998 to adopt baby girls. Later, several of these families returned to China to adopt another girl, and in one instance, another girl and a boy. All of the adoptees in this group of families have a bond that has continued over the years. I composed the music for this film with traditional Chinese music elements in mind. The instrumentation includes piano, guitar, and hand bells. This work is dedicated to everyone in my China group family.\n\nThe Noddy House\n\nBenjamin Allen Smith - Director\n\n14 min.\n\nChicago\n\nOn Christmas Eve, a typical visit from Santa Claus is interrupted by a piercing scream from upstairs. Upon investigating, Santa finds himself eavesdropping on a private family conversation. They say Santa knows who's naughty and who's nice, but Saint Nick has never met a family quite like the Noddys. Twisted and Hilarious.\n\nAs de Trèfle\n\nDirector - Henri Kebabdjian\n\n10 min\n\nFrance\n\nNathan is joined by his daughter Camille by the racetracks. He hopes that by betting on the race, he will be able to afford the school of her dreams. But when Nathan discovers that Camille is admitted in an other school far away, the race takes a whole other turn.\n\nTrashman\n\nDirected by Cam Lewis\n\n6 min.\n\nMichighan\n\nAn anachronistic sci-fi comedy about a hapless trash worker who must learn that reality doesn't always align with the romanticized world of his adventure novels when he attempts to escape his mundane existence and be the hero by helping a homeless man threatened by some punks.\n\nBlack Action Figures\n\n7 min.\n\nDirected by Dave Steck\n\nNew York\n\nA short documentary about representation, connection and the power of seeing yourself reflected in popular culture.\n\nIt features Duro Wicks sharing some of his personal doll collection and talking about his motivation, process and passion to find and collect Black action figures.\n\nLove\n\nDirector - Jane Ashmore\n\n19 min.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nAn unrequited love story, starring British autistic TV and film actor Jules Robertson. This bittersweet film tells the story of Oscar, a complex character with unique needs but the same hopes and desires as anyone. Rather than a film ‘about’ autism, LOVE invites its audience to consider the world from the viewpoint of an autistic person. We follow Oscar’s journey as he navigates the stresses and strains of daily life, taking the poetic lyrics of his favourite band The Streets, and using them a coping mechanism when faced with uncomfortable social conundrums.\n\nTorn\n\nDirected by Joe McStravick\n\n11 min.\n\nUnited Kingdom\n\nMaeve has had to grow up faster than others her age. She makes the choices she needs to for survival. The difference between right and wrong is often purely subjective.\n\nthis is not the morning i thought i was going to have\n\nDirected by Margaret Kellas\n\n15 min.\n\nChicago\n\nTwo estranged sisters are forced to reunite in a 2005 Honda Civic on a sweaty Chicago day. As the car comes to a boil so does their tolerance for one another.\n\nFleeced\n\nDirected by Wesley Alley\n\n9 min.\n\nCalifornia\n\nFarmer Johnson, a man of few words, loves his life of solid routines. Every day is exactly the same, from his usual order of two eggs over easy, two strips of bacon, two pieces of toast, orange juice, and his coffee. Even his lottery ticket numbers are the same, played so often that Millie, his usual waitress, doesn’t even have to ask him what they are any longer. She simply punches them in every morning and gives him the ticket with his tab at the end of his meal.\n\nEncounters\n\nDirector - MARLEY DIANGELO\n\n12 min.\n\nIllinois\n\nJoe Clark, a ride share driver with a mission to please, unlocks a karmic powder keg when he leaves his mistress one morning. A series of encounters lead him on a journey of self discovery that will change his life forever.\n\nChampagne For One\n\nDirector - Seth Iliff\n\n3 min.\n\nTennessee\n\n\"Champagne for One\" celebrates a woman who owns her solitude and isn't afraid to dine alone. The idea for the film is derived from my first book (of the same title) that launched in February 2022; and the film doubled as a book trailer. It was named \"trailer of the month\" by Shelf Awareness."
