        "text": "So the zipper on your pants won’t stay up no matter how hard you try. Here’s a ridiculously simple repair for this common and embarrassing problem that can be achieved with something you probably already have in your pocket.\n\nA cool science demonstration which shows how the electrons swirling around the outside of a Tesla coil can turn it into an impromptu motor – in this case, causing a wire balanced on top of it to spin and shoot sparks as it goes. Originally seen in a video from ElectroBOOM.\n\nThe Sahara Force India Formula One team had their driver Nico Hülkenberg wear a Tobii head-mounted camera with eye-tracking sensors while practicing. The resulting video points out where Nico spends most of his time looking as well as his incredible focus and reflexes.\n\nNow You See It’s simple deconstruction explores the cultural and historical origins of American and British humor. We’d like to add that British humor tends to be reserved while Americans love to put on a show – The Black Knight and Ace Ventura.\n\n“It also comes in pumpkin flavored, if you’d prefer that to the wet cigar, boiled asphalt flavor that occurs naturally.” Cracked’s honest salesman looks at how we’ve managed to transform a highly addictive substance that can cause bodily harm into a daily ritual.\n\nWith this whole Brexit mess, the UK has been in the global news every day. Here, YouTuber Exurb1a explains what makes England unique, for those of us unfamiliar with their unique traditions, language, and achievements.\n\nPrimitive Technology makes building your own home look easy in his latest episode. In fact, it took him 7 days to put it together – five of which were spent gathering grass. Psh. One time we missed winning the lottery by just four numbers.\n\n(SPOILERS) Channel Criswell masterfully explains how cinematographer Emmanuel “Chivo” Lubezki used the camera to reinforce The Revenant‘s conflicts – that of man against nature, and survival against revenge.\n\nFrom his earliest feature films like Duel, to classics like Jaws, Raiders, and E.T., to dramas like Schindler’s List to his diverse later works like War of the Worlds and Tintin, Burger Fiction reminds us just how amazing, prolific, and versatile Steven Spielberg is behind the lens.\n\nSketchfab member elbriga made a three dimensional version of a Calvin & Hobbes comic strip. It’s also compatible with virtual reality headsets. Now make it bigger, then take us inside. Spaceman Spiff’s adventures were made for this.\n\n“…it’s 400 times over the most dangerous rating imposed by the FDA. So without further ado let’s play with this thing.” A statement that no one should ever say, but YouTuber styropyro utters it as if he was talking about a NERF dart. This thing would be right at home in Fallout 4.\n\nThe second place winner at the 2016 Illusion of the Year, Kokichi Sugihara’s Ambiguous Cylinders look like they’re either composed of cylinders or boxes depending on the side that’s facing you. The secret of the “hybrid squircle” design is surprisingly simple.\n\n(SPOILERS) “Lord Snow, you’ll be fighting their battles forever.” YouTuber TheGaroStudios recaps the story of Game of Thrones’ apparent main character, and one of the few people in Westeros who knows how screwed they all are.\n\n(SPOILERS) We’ve taken a peek at the live-action filming and practical effects that went into the climactic battle in Game of Thrones’ sixth season. But the epic sequence also wouldn’t have been possible without visual effects studio Iloura.\n\nUnless you’re a dog, there’s not too much to get excited about when it comes to door bells. But leave it to madman Colin Furze to figure out a way to build a door bell system bonkers enough to get his attention even when he’s working on one of his jet engine projects."
