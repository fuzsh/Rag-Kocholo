        "text": "Scammers were taped joking they would be on the news if they got caught in what has been called Northern Ireland's biggest ever case of tax fraud.\n\nThey were secretly recorded plotting their crimes in a Belfast accountancy firm that was bugged by investigators.\n\nThe gang created a \"false audit trail\" so construction clients could avoid tax and VAT, amounting to a total of Â£5m.\n\nDetails of the recordings were released after the two ringleaders were jailed. Twenty-five others got suspended terms.\n\nBelfast men Francis Devlin and Paul McStravick were jailed for four years on Tuesday.\n\nDevlin was a partner at the bugged accountancy firm Allen Tully & Co, which HMRC said was used as a base by members of gang.\n\nTheir 25 accomplices - 23 men and two women - were spared prison over their involvement in the scam but they each received suspended jail sentences during previous court hearings.\n\n'We'd go down in history'\n\nThe complex investigation spanned more than a decade, according to His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\n\nInvestigators kept the gang under surveillance for six weeks between February and March 2012.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .
