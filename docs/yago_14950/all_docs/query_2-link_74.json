        "text": "Scammers were taped joking they would be on the news if they got caught in what has been called Northern Ireland's biggest ever case of tax fraud.\n\nThey were secretly recorded plotting their crimes in a Belfast accountancy firm that was bugged by investigators.\n\nThe gang created a \"false audit trail\" so construction clients could avoid tax and VAT, amounting to a total of £5m.\n\nDetails of the recordings were released after the two ringleaders were jailed. Twenty-five others got suspended terms.\n\nBelfast men Francis Devlin and Paul McStravick were jailed for four years on Tuesday.\n\nDevlin was a partner at the bugged accountancy firm Allen Tully & Co, which HMRC said was used as a base by members of gang.\n\nTheir 25 accomplices - 23 men and two women - were spared prison over their involvement in the scam but they each received suspended jail sentences during previous court hearings.\n\n'We'd go down in history'\n\nThe complex investigation spanned more than a decade, according to His Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC).\n\nInvestigators kept the gang under surveillance for six weeks between February and March 2012.\n\nAllow Twitter content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Twitter .

To view this content choose ‘accept and continue’.\n\nOn the HMRC recordings, one of the men can be heard speculating about the scale of their scam, and how they would become notorious if they were caught.\n\n\"It's like Aladdin's Cave in here for the revenue,\" the man is heard saying.\n\n\"If the revenue were to come in here... you know, we'd go down in history.\"\n\nLaughing, the man then suggests that the gang would appear \"on the Six O'Clock News\" and not in just in Northern Ireland, but also \"in London or something\".\n\nThe scam involved creating 16 \"bogus companies\" to avoid tax, with the fraudsters using 56 associated bank accounts to commit the offences.\n\nAs well as bugging the accountant's office, the HMRC followed the gang and filmed their meetings and cash drop-offs.\n\nThey also recorded the suspects withdrawing money from cash machines.\n\n'Stopped the loss of millions'\n\nMore than 400 HMRC officers were involved in the investigation, carrying out searches at 34 business and residential premises, including three in England.\n\nThe lengthy prosecution case ended on Tuesday when 58-year-old Devlin and 56-year-old McStravick were both jailed for four years at Belfast Crown Court.\n\nDevlin, from Bristow Park, Belfast, pleaded guilty to conspiring to cheat the public revenue and conspiracy to convert criminal property.\n\nMcStravick, from Myrtlefield Park in the city, admitted the same offences.\n\nFollowing the completion of the prosecution process, HMRC released excerpts of the recordings and a statement on the scale of their investigation.\n\n\"This was a sophisticated and complex fraud that took the largest ever tax probe in Northern Ireland, including extensive covert surveillance, for HMRC fraud investigators to bring it down,\" said Richard Las, director of HMRC's Fraud Investigation Service.\n\n\"Their tenacity and expertise has stopped the loss of millions of pounds in taxpayers' money, which is now paying for our vital public services, rather than lining the pockets of criminals.\n\n\"The fact is, no tax criminal is beyond our reach and that includes those corrupt professionals who aid and abet them, as these sentences clearly show,\" Mr Las added.\n\nHMRC's statement said it was the first time it had used the secret recording technique in Northern Ireland because it was \"reserved for the most serious of tax fraud cases\".\n\n\"Use of this technique requires approval from the surveillance commissioner,\" it explained.\n\n'Complex file of evidence'\n\nGraham Cardwell form the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) said it \"worked closely with HMRC from an early stage in their investigation, which involved an extensive undercover surveillance operation\".\n\nThe 25 people were given suspended sentences during previous court hearings over the past three and a half years.\n\nThey were:\n\nRobert Clarke, aged 71, of Dundrod Road, Crumlin, who pleaded guilty to one count of converting criminal property\n\nKenneth Sheehan, aged 44, of Cromwell Road, Belfast, who pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue\n\nMatthew Brennan, aged 37, of Mathieson Terrace, Glasgow, who pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue\n\nDesmond Crean, aged 56, of Drummond Park, Belfast, who pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue\n\nDaniel Lyons, age 42, of Whiterock Road, Belfast, who pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiring to convert criminal property\n\nSean Armstrong, aged 46, of Conor Rise, Belfast, who pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue\n\nJohn Donnan, aged 44, of Portnamona Court, Belfast, who pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiring to convert criminal property\n\nKieran McGuinness, aged 46, of Berkeley Hall Square, Lisburn, who pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue\n\nFrancis Rooney, aged 56, of Coolnasilla Park, Belfast, who pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiring to convert criminal property\n\nAnthony Cassidy, aged 65, of Gausson Villas, Ballyronan, who pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue and one count of converting criminal property\n\nElizabeth Mulholland, aged 68, of Cavehill Road, Belfast, who pleaded guilty to one count of converting criminal property\n\nColin Crean, aged 31, of Ligoneil Road, Belfast, who pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue.\n\nVincent O'Neill.
