        "text": "ALTER Agency have been working hard throughout lockdown to keep their clients at the forefront of people’s minds, with innovative sales platforms, partnership deals and digital marketing ongoing to keep our partners profitable.\n\nAs some lockdown measures start to lessen, that hasn’t stopped us from innovating for our clients to ensure they stay as successful as possible, and the next stage of that is releasing the TCL 10 Pro’s first UK trailer!\n\nThe TCL 10 Pro is part of the TCL 10 Series, a new smartphone brand that was launched into the UK market on June 1st, and in Ireland on July 1st.\n\nThere have obviously been a huge number of challenges in introducing a relatively unheard-of brand, in the UK, into the market, but as an agency we were confident in our abilities, and in TCL’s products, that we could make it a success.\n\nThis was in spite of only having limited access to one of our best resources for launching a phone: our award-winning tech team. Well known in the industry for providing some of the best hands-on product training to stores and staff, lockdown has obviously limited their ability to hero the products. In typical ALTER Agency fashion though, we adapted how they worked and continued to utilise their incredible skills in a more consumer facing role than usual, all while providing remote training to retailers who wanted to access it.\n\nNot having the Tech Team would be a major barrier to most, but we’ve managed to work around it, and combined with our ongoing marketing activity, the UK-wide launch of the TCL 10 Series has in fact been so successful, that it leads the rest of Europe in sales so far.\n\nLaunch was just stage one though, as we now continue our mission to raise the profile of what we believe to be an industry-leading brand in this new market. One of the most exciting steps towards that, was the debut of the first ever TCL Cinema trailer for the 10 Pro at Luna Cinema’s Drive-in event at the Allianz Arena.\n\nThe creation of this video was a great example of the power of genuine partnerships. Finding brands whose ethos and ambitions are similar and who can help one another thrive, is one of the true strengths of ALTER Agency’s services.\n\nIn this case, it was the bringing together of TCL and the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.\n\nFollowing TCL’s prestigious partnership announcement with BAFTA: A Life in Pictures, the global consumer electronics business created their cinema ad exclusively using the talents of BAFTA Crew, a professional development and networking programme connecting emerging talent with film productions.\n\nWilliam Paterson, Area Director for TCL Communications Northern Europe said:\n\n“We wanted to produce an advert to show that its great display makes it the ideal personal device for watching entertainment and content. Having recently partnered with BAFTA, we saw an opportunity to utilise the creative talent of the film makers supported as part of BAFTA’s year-round support programme. As a result, we are delighted to be working with BAFTA Crew network to produce our first cinema ad.”\n\nThe ad titled “Made for Watching – Everywhere” is written, produced and directed by Joe McStravick and the soundtrack is composed by Andrew Simon McAllister. The ad tells the simple story of how some well-earned screen-time can add happiness to everyone’s day. The trailer highlights the magic of cinema as each of the actors’ faces light up with colour and anticipation as they tentatively wait for their movie to begin.\n\nJoe McStravick, BAFTA Crew director, said:\n\n“It’s been an incredible experience working with TCL during these surreal times and I’m incredibly proud of the result. Given the circumstances, it has been a lifesaver for me, and it has been great to be back doing what I love best.”\n\nFurther immersing audiences into the heart of the advert, composer Andrew Simon McAllister created a bespoke piece of music titled ‘Beyond the Theatre’. The musical piece mirrors a Hollywood movie trailer, building to a crescendo and perfectly mirroring the story played out on screen.\n\nWilliam Paterson, said:\n\n“BAFTA is working hard to support the creative communities and we are proud to be able to support them through the creation of this advert. BAFTA is a wonderful champion and supporter of the film, games and television industries, which aligns perfectly with our Display Greatness ethos. We are incredibly proud to be working with the team and will continue to support the Academy however possible.”\n\nCombining our clients with great brands, to produce great results, is something we here at ALTER Agency really pride ourselves on, and we can say with absolute certainty, that the partnerships do not stop here!\n\nKeep your eyes closely peeled on TCL this summer, as there is a LOT more to come…"
