        "text": "The award-winning writer and playwright behind local star Maggie Muff is swapping seeing her work on stages across the country to seeing it on the big screen.\n\nLeesa Harker, whose Maggie Muff plays and hilarious 50 Shades of Red, White and Blue novel made her a local success story, is currently showing her first short film at festivals across the world.\n\nThe Bully is a dark comedy set and filmed in Northern Ireland, starring Hope Street actress Kerri Quinn, one of the country's top comedians Shane Todd and rising young talent Fionn O'Hagan.\n\nRead more: Derry Girls delight as they land Emmy nomination\n\nRead more: First look at NI actor Fra Fee in new series 'Lost Boys & Fairies'\n\nA synopsis of the film reads: \"Stressed-out single mother Gloria’s boss is a bully. Her ex is a bully.\n\n\"And now her son is being bullied at school.\n\n\"Gloria tries to be the bigger and better person, but when all of the bullies in her life do a pile-on, she must decide if she’s going to get walked over forever…or will she choose revenge?\"\n\nAfter a successful debut at film festivals from Co Louth to Washington state, Leesa's creation, directed by Joe McStravick, has been completely self-produced and funded by her own production company Beezer Productions.\n\nSpeaking to Belfast Live, Leesa explained how she was inspired to write the comedy short after her own experience with dealing with bullying close to home.\n\nLeesa said: \"My daughter was getting bullied - it was a good few years ago and when I went into the school to try and get them to sort it out, they just wouldn't it\n\n\"They have all these fancy anti-bullying policies but until the school admits it is bullying, then they just stay in the drawer.\n\n\"So that's the kind of thing that shocked me - my daughter was told that she wasn't allowed to say that she was being bullied because that would affect the mental health of the child that was getting branded a bully.\n\n\"It really did affect her. When know you can't help your own child it makes you feel powerless.\"\n\nLeesa's success story is one of a single mother building herself up to become one of the biggest names in the local theatre industry through her power and determination in the face of those saying she can't - a fire she is now bringing into the world of TV and film.\n\n\"I've had so many years now working in theatre, but I just walked in off the street as well back then. I never had any experience in theatre, so I had to do everything myself.\n\n\"I had to set my own production company up and everything I've done, all my Maggie plays and everything, have all been self-funded and every time I make money out of one play, I invest it to make another.\n\n\"That's always what I've been about,\" she explained.\n\nLeesa continued: \"I'm finding the same thing in the film industry and as I've been trying for a couple of years to get into things, it's just been 'no, no, no.'\n\n\"I just found the doors getting closed. left, right, and centre so I did a similar kind of thing to the theatre, and I thought, I'm just going to set up the TV production company myself.\"\n\n\"So I did that in 2020 on the year of lockdown.\"\n\nLeesa set up Beezer Productions and soon after, found herself writing for local cop series Hope Street where she met Joe McStravick and got him on board to direct something she had been thinking about writing - and The Bully was born.\n\n\"I could go one way or the other - a lot of people would just give up to say 'you know what, my stuff is not good enough' but I'm the opposite.\n\n\"So I'm not going to stop.\"\n\nHeading to film festivals in New York and Kerry soon, Leesa hopes to prove that a single mother from a working-class background can make a name for herself in the industry as The Bully plays to thousands at festivals this season.\n\nBeing able to see the audience's reaction at her first in-person festival screening in Dundalk was what she described as a \"pinch me\" moment.\n\n\"That's the first time I've been in an actual cinema where people have paid money to go in and the short film.\n\n\"I was like a child. I was so excited.\n\n\"I'll never, ever not appreciate people spending money to go and see the things that I dream up in my head.\n\n\"And the audience laughed in the right places and stuff, and it got an applause at the end, so I can't really ask for more than that.\"\n\nTo keep up to date with screenings of The Bully, see here"
