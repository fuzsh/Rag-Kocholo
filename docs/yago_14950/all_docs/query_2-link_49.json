We are working with our filmmakers, distributors and tech vendors to take our program online in early 2021 and will be in touch with more information in the coming weeks.

NEW IRISH SHORTS PROGRAM 2 (82 minutes) SUNNY SIDE UP 2019/Ireland (11 minutes) Director: Peter Kilmartin Peter Pringle and Sunny Jacobs both served years in prison for crimes they did not commit. After being exonerated, what are the chances they both met and fell in love? This film explores how love can prevail, and hearts can keep beating when a soul is dragged through so much. THE NIGHT IS BLACK AND THE DAY IS WHITE 2019/Ireland/United Kingdom (8 minutes) Director: Joe McStravick A mother and a father share their experiences of living with, caring for and loving a child who has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). THE WORKHOUSE PRODIGY 2020/Ireland (7 minutes) Director: Paul Murphy Born in a workhouse, in post famine Ireland Johnny Butler's prospects are not great, but help comes from the most unlikely source. MAID IN AMERICA 2019/Ireland (1 minute) Director: Kathy Raftery Josephine from County Galway shares a story of when she encountered a member of the Rockefeller family whilst she was working as maid in America in the early 1950's. THE LAST ORGANIST 2019/Ireland (6 minutes) Director: Paddy McConnell A 94 year old organist reminisces on his love of music and his move to Ireland from Belgium 67 years ago. COMING HOME: AT TEACHT ABHAILE 2019/Ireland/United States (24 minutes) Co-directors: Dylan Ladds and Ryan Scura Paddy O'Leary grew up in Wexford, Ireland, but didn't discover his love and talent for running until he moved to San Francisco. Now, he is returning to Ireland to take on the fastest known time on the self-navigated 115 kilometer Wicklow Round, and to rediscover his home through the lens of running. THE VASECTOMY DOCTOR 2018/Ireland (11 minutes) Director: Paul Webster Dr. Andrew Rynne was the first doctor to perform vasectomies in Ireland; he estimates that he has performed over 35,000. This is a distinction that did not come without controversy in the extremely Catholic Ireland of the nineteen seventies and eighties, but Dr. Rynne persevered in the face of opposition from the church. In the eighties, he challenged the restrictive laws on contraceptives by selling condoms without a prescription. He got his day in court and forced the government to change policy. In 1990, Dr. Rynne was about to perform a vasectomy on a patient, when a gunman entered his surgery and shot him. After surviving the attempt on his life, he would later meet with his assailant and forgive him. STRONG AT THE BROKEN PLACES 2018/Ireland (14 minutes) Director: Anna Rogers Raped at 14 by a Catholic Priest, human rights activist Colm Oâ€™Gorman challenges Pope Francis to tell the truth about the cover up of abuse during his divisive visit to Ireland in August 2018.\n\nThis listing has no upcoming events\n\nStart: 2020-11-19T00:00:00-05:00\n\nEnd: 2020-11-22T00:00:00-05:00\n\nCategory\n\nFilm\n\nTickets"
