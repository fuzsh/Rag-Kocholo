        "text": "Abstract\n\nThe endangered snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is widely but sparsely distributed throughout the mountainous regions of central Asia. Detailed information on the status and abundance of the snow leopard is limited because of the logistical challenges faced when working in the rugged terrain it occupies, along with its secretive nature. Camera-trapping and noninvasive genetic techniques have been used successfully to survey this felid. We compared noninvasive genetic and camera-trapping snow leopard surveys in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. We collected 180 putative snow leopard scats from 3 sites during an 8-day period along 37.74 km of transects. We then conducted a 65-day photographic survey at 1 of these sites, approximately 2 months after scat collection. In the site where both techniques were used noninvasive genetics detected 5 individuals in only 2 days of fieldwork compared to 7 individuals observed in the 65-day camera-trapping session. Estimates of population size from noninvasive genetics ranged between 16 and 19 snow leopards in the 314.3-km2 area surveyed, yielding densities of 4.9–5.9 individuals/100 km2. In comparison, the population estimate from the 65-day photographic survey was 4 individuals (adults only) within the 264-km2 area, for a density estimate of 1.5 snow leopards/100 km2. Higher density estimates from the noninvasive genetic survey were due partly to an inability to determine age and exclude subadults, reduced spatial distribution of sampling points as a consequence of collecting scats along linear transects, and deposition of scats by multiple snow leopards on common sites. Resulting differences could inflate abundance estimated from noninvasive genetic surveys and prevent direct comparison of densities derived from the 2 approaches unless appropriate adjustments are made to the study design.\n\nThe endangered snow leopard (Panthera uncia) occupies particularly inaccessible mountainous habitat in central Asia, covering an area of more than 1.2 million km2 across 12 countries (Nowell and Jackson 1996). Snow leopards are elusive and sparsely distributed, making them extremely difficult to observe and study in the wild (Nowell and Jackson 1996). As a result, reliable information is lacking on the number of snow leopards remaining, locations of peripheral and core populations, and areas where they are in decline. However, such knowledge is critical for the conservation of this flagship species. Considerable effort is underway to determine the status of the species across its extensive and highly fragmented range (Ale et al. 2007; Jackson et al. 2009; Janecka et al. 2008; Lovari et al. 2009; McCarthy et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2008). Survey methods used must generate reliable quantitative data and be time efficient, easily repeatable, and affordable.\n\nTo date, researchers have relied heavily on field sign to detect and monitor snow leopards (Ale et al. 2007; Fox et al. 1991; Hussain 2003; Jackson and Hunter 1996; Mallon 1991; McCarthy and Munkhtsog 1997; Schaller et al. 1987, 1988; Xu et al. 2008). Spoors, scrapes, scats, and scent-sprayed rocks constitute evidence used for presence–absence surveys and abundance indexes (Jackson and Hunter 1996). The high marking frequency of snow leopards, conspicuousness of the deposited sign, and use of predictable marking sites located along ridgelines, saddles, and cliff bases facilitate this approach (Ahlborn and Jackson 1988). However, many environmental and biological factors (e.g., time of year, structure of substrate, available scraping sites, breeding status of females, age structure, social status, and home-range overlap—Ahlborn and Jackson 1988; Jackson and Hunter 1996) confound the relationship between snow leopard density and distribution and frequency of sign, making comparisons between sites difficult. In addition, sign surveys do not account for differences in detection probabilities or distinguish between individual snow leopards, making it largely impossible to derive quantitative population estimates with this approach.\n\nPhotographic and molecular methods incorporating nonin-vasive sampling offer more-robust techniques for monitoring carnivore populations (Karanth and Nichols 1998; Kohn et al. 1999). Camera trapping has been used extensively for estimating abundance and population size of many felids, including ocelots (Leopardus pardalis—Dillon and Kelly 2008), jaguars (Panthern onca—Soisalo and Cavalcanti 2006), leopards (Panthera pardus—Balme et al. 2009), and tigers (Panthera tigris—Karanth and Nichols 1998). In northern India, Jackson et al. (2006) demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach on snow leopards and concluded that it was a useful tool for estimating population size where density exceeds 2 or 3 individuals/100 km2. However, camera trapping requires substantial investment in field time and equipment, along with careful attention to the distribution and placement of cameras. Low captures and detection probabilities as a result of insufficient sampling lead to wide confidence intervals and poor precision of capture-mark-recapture estimates of population size (Thompson 2004). Ruggedness of snow leopard habitat and generally poor access within study sites increases the amount of time and effort required to set and maintain camera stations. This limits the size of areas that can be surveyed within the 45- to 55-day period recommended for maintaining population closure (Jackson et al. 2006, 2009).\n\nNoninvasive genetic techniques also enable estimation of population size and density and are becoming more common for wildlife monitoring (Schwartz et al. 2007; Waits and Paetkau 2005). This approach has been used to estimate population size in diverse species, including tigers (Mondol et al. 2009), bobcats (Lynx rufus—Ruell et al. 2009), coyotes (Canis latrans—Kohn et al. 1999), and elephants (Loxodonta cyclotis—Eggert et al. 2003). The simplest technique is to sample scats deposited within a study site and attribute the scat to specific individuals by genotyping variable microsatellite loci. Two approaches are used for deriving population estimates from noninvasive genetic data collected in this manner. The 1st uses multiple sampling occasions and a capture–mark–recapture model similar to camera-trapping surveys. The 2nd approach derives population estimates from the number of times different individuals are observed among samples collected during a single period. In a tiger study in Bandipur National Park (India) capture–mark–recapture estimates of population size from noninvasive genetic techniques were similar to those from camera trapping (Mondol et al. 2009).\n\nEfficacy of detecting multiple snow leopards via genetic analysis of scats recently has been illustrated across diverse geographic areas (Janecka et al. 2008; Lovari et al. 2009; McCarthy et al. 2008). McCarthy et al. (2008) found a correlation between the frequency of snow leopard sign (total sign per kilometer) and number of individuals genetically detected via analysis of scats. However, neither estimator was correlated with camera-trapping results from 2 of 3 study sites (McCarthy et al. 2008). In addition, McCarthy et al. (2008) did not derive population estimates from genetic analysis of scats and so did not directly compare abundance from noninvasive genetic and camera-trapping techniques.\n\nBoth noninvasive genetic and camera techniques are promising for generating quantitative information on distribution and abundance of snow leopards. Cost-effective and reliable methods for estimating snow leopard abundance to better target conservation initiatives are urgently -needed (Jackson and Fox 1997; McCarthy and Chapron 2003). The objective of our study was to compare the 2 most common noninvasive approaches for deriving density estimates in terms of effort, cost, and ability to detect and recapture individual snow leopards in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia. Comparison of results obtained by these approaches, along with the advantages and disadvantages of each, are important for making decisions on the investment of resources for monitoring snow leopards. A priori knowledge of the actual abundance of snow leopards in the area was not available; therefore, we made comparisons using information on snow leopard biology and ecology and previous estimates of population density.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nStudy area.—The distribution of snow leopards in Mongolia extends into the Gobi Desert (Bannikov 1954). In this region numerous relatively isolated, low-elevation (1,500–2,500 m) mountains run west to east, south of the larger Gobi Altai range. We surveyed Tost Uul (i.e., Tost Mountains; 43°10.8∲N, 101°34.8∲E) and Noyon Uul (43°7.8∲N, 102°0.00∲E) located approximately 250 km west of Dalan-zadgad (Fig. 1). These rugged massifs rise out of the desert and are composed of exposed rock and steep slopes broken by seasonal drainages. In Dalanzadgad the mean annual precipitation for the period between 1961 and 2004 was 1.31 cm with most falling in July and August (Cheng et al. 2011; Sternberg et al., in press). Temperatures were typically lowest\n\nin January (monthly mean –14.5° C, 1961–2004) and highest in July (monthly mean 21.6° C, 1961–2004—Cheng et al. 2011).\n\nThe vegetation is sparse on mountain massifs, with feather grass (Stipa gobica and S. glareosa), low shrubs (Caragana spp. and Artemisia frigida), and herbaceous plants (Ajania spp. and Scorzonera capita) most common. In valleys and gullies the bush Amygdalus mongolica is often dominant. Snow leopards prey primarily on ibex (Capra sibirica) and argali (Ovis ammon) in the Gobi Desert, although the argali is now rare in many areas. Small mammals also are utilized by snow leopards and include the Tolai hare (Lepus tolai) and Pallas's pika (Ochotona pallasi). Sympatric carnivores that potentially compete for resources include the gray wolf (Canis lupus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), and Eurasian lynx (Lynx lynx—Bannikov 1954; Bold and Dorjzunduy 1976). Pastoralists primarily graze goats and sheep; they use desert slopes during summer but live in winter-spring camps closer to the mountains from October through May. Both the local people and wildlife are dependent on a small number of wells and springs because of limited available water.\n\nScat collection.—Snow leopards were not handled directly during this project. Three sites were surveyed by collecting scats that later were analyzed genetically. The 1st site (Noyon) was in Noy on Uul and the other 2 sites (Tost A and Tost B) in Tost Uul, ∼125 km to the west of Noyon (Figs. 1 and 2). Knowledgeable local residents guided field teams to areas actively used by snow leopards. We focused on sites with known or suspected snow leopard activity to maximize probability of detection because sampling random locations would provide low detection rates insufficient for population size estimates (Otis et al. 1978; Pollock et al. 1990).\n\nTwo teams concurrently searched for snow leopard sign (scrapes, tracks, and scent marks) along different transects traversing ridgelines, saddles, and rocky outcrops. When sign was observed, each team followed wildlife trails along well-defined topographic features and collected snow leopard scats that were present. Species identification of scats in the field was based on diameter, segmentation, odor, and proximity to other snow leopard sign (Jackson and Hunter 1996). Only scats believed to be of snow leopard origin were collected. A small sample of each scat (∼1 cm2) was stored in 15-ml centrifuge tubes with silica desiccant. Total numbers of scats, scrapes, and tracks observed were noted. Length of each transect was dependent on terrain, amount of scat, and available time. Transects were continued until approximately 18 samples were collected or 5 km of terrain were covered. Limits were imposed to avoid uneven representation among transects and to ensure sufficient time for teams to return to base camp.\n\nSpecies, sex, and individual identification of scats.—DNA was extracted from scats using the Qiagen Stool DNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, California) following manufacturer recommendations. Species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or restriction enzyme assays were not available for all sympatric carnivores present in our study sites. We therefore identified species that deposited scats by PCR amplifying and sequencing a 148-base pair (bp) segment of the mitochondrial cytochrome-b gene using previously described methods (Farrell et al. 2000; Janečka et al. 2008). Sequences observed (GenBank accessions HQ897983– HQ897986) were aligned with reference taxa, and a neighbor-joining phylogeny was reconstructed in PAUP* 4.0bl0 (Janecka et al. 2008; Swofford 2003). A scat was identified when its haplotype was in a monophyletic clade with a reference species supported by 100% bootstrap values and exhibited <3% sequence divergence (Janecka et al. 2008).\n\nGenetically identified snow leopard scats were genotyped at 7 microsatellite loci (PUN082, PUN100, PUN124, PUN132, PUN225, PUN229, and PUN327—Janečka et al. 2008). Loci were originally characterized in the domestic cat by Menotti-Raymond et al. (1999) and assayed in snow leopards by Waits et al. (2007), but the primers used were redesigned from snow leopard flanking sequences and placed closer to microsatellite repeats to minimize geno typing errors as a result of PCR failure, allele dropout, and false alleles (Janečka et al. 2008). Previous analysis of error rates suggested that 3 independent PCR replicates were sufficient to minimize genotyping errors to an acceptable level (Janecka et al. 2008). All 7 loci were variable in the snow leopard population studied.\n\nMicrosatellites were PCR amplified using the methods of Janecka et al. (2008) and genotyped on an ABI 3730 (Applied Biosystems, Inc., Foster City, California) in the Molecular Cytogenetics and Genomics Laboratory (Texas A&M University) Samples were handled in a dedicated pre-PCR area, and barrier-tips were used to minimize contamination. All PCRs and genotyping were done in triplicate and analyzed with extraction blanks. Samples that did not yield ≥2 consistent replicates at each locus were discarded from analyses. Alleles had to be observed ≥2 times in the 3 PCR replicates to be included in the consensus genotype. Only samples with consensus genotypes generated for all 7 loci were included in the analysis.\n\nSex identification was performed with felid-specific primers (Murphy et al. 1999) that amplified a 200-bp intronic segment of the AMELY gene on the Y chromosome (Janečka et al. 2008). Amplifications were performed in triplicate along with 1 male positive control, 1 female positive control, and 1 negative control. PCR products were run on a 1.5% agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under ultraviolet light. A sample was identified as male if at least 2 of 3 PCRs gave strong amplification of the AMELY marker. Samples that yielded PCR product in only 1 PCR were not assigned to either sex. If no amplification of the AMELY marker occurred in all 3 replicates, the individuals were considered females. However, to avoid misidentifying male samples as female due to poor DNA quality or quantity, only scats that were genotyped successfully with the complete 7-microsatellite panel were identified positively as female.\n\nAnalysis of microsatellite data.—Level of PCR failure and allele dropout were monitored closely, and scat samples with missing consensus genotypes at ≥1 loci were excluded to avoid genotyping errors. We thus excluded 21 snow leopard scat samples. We estimated PCR failure and allele dropout rates for 39 scats included in population analyses. We also estimated the quality index for each locus and sample, and global quality index as recommended by Miquel et al. (2006). Quality index can range from 0 to 1; the higher the index, the lower the error rate. We discarded all samples that had a quality index < 0.80. Allele number (AN), observed heterozygosity (Ho), expected heterozygosity (HE), and Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were calculated in GENALEX 6.0.9 (Peakall and Smouse 2006). The sequential Bonferroni technique was used to correct for multiple comparisons in Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium tests (Rice 1989). Probability of identity (Paetkau and Strobeck 1994) was estimated in GENALEX for unrelated individuals (PID-unr) and siblings (PiD-sibs—Waits et al. 2001).\n\nPopulation size estimates from scat survey.—Numbers of snow leopards detected were compared across transects. Capture-mark-recapture population estimates were inappropriate for our sample set because scats were collected in only 1 survey session. Estimating population size by pooling noninvasive samples into 1 temporal period previously has provided robust estimates across diverse taxa and study sites (Eggert et al. 2003; Kohn et al. 1999; Miller et al. 2005; Ruell et al. 2009); we therefore used this approach. However, one of the major weaknesses of pooling scat samples is that the temporal period remains undefined because the length of time scats persist in the field is uncertain. In the Gobi the time period represented can be 2–6 months, based on previous field experience.\n\nThe 1st method used was the maximum-likelihood estimator of CAPWIRE, which calculates the likelihood of data fitting hypothesized population sizes (Miller et al. 2005). CAPWIRE takes into account capture heterogeneity by assigning individuals into 1 of 2 classes (type A and type B) and estimating relative capture probabilities. The likelihood ratio test was used to determine if our data fit the equal capture probability model or the 2 innate rates model with a rejection value of 0.05 (based on 1,000 bootstrap replicates). Confidence intervals (CIs) around the population size were estimated from 1,000 bootstrap replicates.\n\nThe 2nd method involved the use of rarefaction estimators that derive an asymptote (the estimate of population size) from the curve of the cumulative number of individuals detected versus number of samples genotyped. These approaches do not incorporate capture heterogeneity. Three proposed formulas, originally described by Kohn et al. (Kohn—1999), Eggert et al. (Eggert—2003), and D. Chessel (Chessel—Valière 2002), can be used for calculating the rarefaction curve; all were implemented in GIMLET 1.3.1 (Valiere 2002). GIMLET was used to generate 1,000 pseudoreplicates from random reiterations of sampling order. Population estimates were derived in R version 1.7.1 (Ihaka and Gentleman 1996) from the asymptote of the rarefaction equations fitting the data from the pseudoreplicates generated by GIMLET.\n\nTo define area surveyed we buffered transects with mean maximum distance moved (MMDM) and one-half MMDM between locations where the same individual was genetically “recaptured” (Karanth and Nichols 2002; Wilson and Anderson 1985). Polygons were generated from buffers and areas estimated in ArcGIS 9.3 (ESRI, Inc., Redlands, California). Density was derived from population estimates divided by area of buffered transects.\n\nCamera-trapping methods.—Two months after scat collection a camera-trapping survey described by Jackson et al. (2009) was conducted in the Tost A site (Figs. 1 and 2). The approach was based on methods refined during a 2-year camera-trap study undertaken in the Indian Trans-Himalaya (Jackson et al. 2006). We deployed 18 camera stations, each 2–4 km apart (Fig. 2). Two film (analog) cameras triggered by a TrailMaster 1550 active-infrared sensor (20-s delay, 24-h continuous operation; Goodson & Associates, Inc., Lenexa, Kansas) were concealed within natural rock cairns at each station. Camera traps were positioned along snow leopard travel routes (e.g., ridgelines, valley edges, and passes); no baits or lures were used as attractants. We did not relocate traps during the survey because of limited access and to maximize the probability of observing all individuals present within the surveyed area. Camera traps were checked every 2– 10 days to ensure that they were functional and to replace film. Results of camera trapping are decribed in Jackson et al. (2009).\n\nPopulation size estimates from camera-trapping survey.— We distinguished individual snow leopards from pelage patterns using the criteria of Jackson et al. (2006). Program CAPTURE (Karanth and Nichols 1998; White et al. 1982) was used to estimate population size with the capture–mark— recapture approach under 1-day, 3-day, 5-day, and 7-day sampling occasions; details and results of the capture–mark– recapture analysis are provided in Jackson et al. (2009). Cubs were excluded from the analysis. Population closure was tested with the Stanley and Burnham (1999) method. To define effective area surveyed and estimate snow leopard densities, polygons were generated in ArcGIS 9.3 by buffering individual camera traps and the minimum convex polygon of camera traps using one-half MMDM and MMDM distances between successive captures of individuals (Karanth and Nichols 2002).\n\nCost comparison of surveys.—Effort put forth during surveys was estimated by multiplying number of trained personnel and days required to complete work (i.e., person-days). We calculated total costs of surveys by summing expenditures for domestic airfares (Ulaanbaatar to Dalanzad-gad), ground transportation to study sites, food and accomodation for team members, expendable field and laboratory supplies (e.g., film, batteries, and scat collection kits), and salaries of local staff. Expenditures in the laboratory were estimated for DNA extraction and species identification (extraction kits, PCR, and sequencing), individual identification (PCR and microsatellite genotyping), and sex identification (PCR and agarose electrophoresis).. Remote-sensing cameras, laboratory equipment, indirect costs, and salaries of staff from the United States were excluded.\n\nResults\n\nNoninvasive genetic survey.—Thirteen transects were surveyed from 8 to 16 March 2007 (Fig. 1). Of the 180 scats collected we obtained genetic species identification for 81% (Table 1). Number of scrapes per kilometer ranged from 3.46 in Noyon to 10.56 in Tost B (Table 2). Tracks were observed in 2 of 3 sites, with 1.01 tracks/km in Noyon and 0.30 tracks/km in Tost A. The majority of scats collected were red fox (n = 83), and the snow leopard was the next most common species detected (n = 60). Three wolf or dog scats were observed.\n\nWe genotyped the verified snow leopard scats with 7 microsatellites. We used rigorous criteria for allele sizing and discarded all ambiguous samples (21 of 60) from the analysis. For the 39 scats used for population analysis our mean PCR failure rate was 2.44% (range, 0.85–3.42%), and allele dropout was 0.83%; (range, 0.00–1.79%; Appendix I). Mean quality index for loci was 0.971 (range, 0.957–0.991) and for scats also 0.971 (range, 0.857–1.00; Appendix I). Global quality index was 0.966. Our high quality values were a direct result of excluding all questionable genotypes from the analysis. Complete genotypes were obtained for 39 samples (65%), among which a total of 15 unique genotypes were observed (Table 1).\n\nAll 7 loci were polymorphic, with AN ranging from 2 to 5 (X̄ = 3.6) and HE from 0.18 to 0.70 (X̄ = 0.51; Appendix II). No additional snow leopard samples were available from the study population that would permit an independent estimate of allelic frequencies. We therefore estimated allelic frequencies and genetic parameters from unique genotypes observed during our survey. All loci were in Hardy–Weinberg\n\nequilibrium. The PID.unr was 0.00016 and PID.sib was 0.01801 with all 7 loci. In conjunction with the Y-linked marker we identified 9 male and 6 female snow leopards.\n\nPopulation size estimates.—Fifteen snow leopards were genetically detected; numbers in each of the 3 sites varied from 4 (3 males and 1 female) in Tost B to 6 (3 males and 3 females) in Noyon (Table 1). Mean number of captures was 2.7 per snow leopard. Six snow leopards (40%) were observed only once, and the other 10 a mean of 3.5 times. The most common male was observed 8 times and the most common female 5 times. Within the camera-trapped site (Tost A), scat sampling detected a total of 5 individuals, with 3 males and 1 female observed 3 or more times and 1 female observed only once. The male that was identified in 8 scats was detected at this site.\n\nWe combined data across all 3 sites to estimate population size within the entire area sampled. The CAPWIRE program selected the 2 innate rates model model based on the difference between the likelihood scores (P = 0.046). Population size derived from the maximum-likelihood method was 19 (95% CI = 11–26). Mean number of observations per individual was 2.7, and relative capture probability of type A versus type B individuals was 4.15. The rarefaction population size estimates were 16 (95% CI = 12–19 [Chessel]), 17 (95% CI = 12–31 [Eggert]), and 24 (95% CI = 15–95 [Kohn]). Previous studies have shown that the Kohn method overestimates sizes of small populations (Eggert et al. 2003; Frantz and Roper 2006; Valière 2002). In our data set it also produced unrealistically wide confidence intervals; thus, we excluded it from subsequent analyses.\n\nWe derived density estimates from the CAPWIRE and Chessel results, which provided an upper and lower range. Scat transects buffered using one-half MMDM (2.84 km) yielded survey areas of 155.5 km2 (Noyon), 108.0 km2 (Tost A), and 59.8 km2 (Tost B), for a total of 323.3 km2. Buffers provided density estimates of 4.9 (95% CI = 3.6–5.8) and 5.9 (95% CI = 3.4–8.0) snow leopards/100 km2. When the 5.69-km MMDM buffer was used, the total area was 859.2 km2, yielding densities of 1.8 (95% CI = 1.3–2.2) and 2.2 (95% CI = 1.3– 3.0) snow leopards/100 km2.\n\nWe examined possible effects of violations of population closure resulting from scats deposited well before our survey (>2 months prior) by reestimating population size with the CAPWIRE and Chessel methods after excluding scats classified as old. During collection, scats were divided into 3 subjective categories: fresh—surface was completely intact and glossy; recent—majority of surface was intact, very dry, and slightly cracked; and old—surface was cracked and visibly deteriorated. Although it was not possible to gauge the absolute age of scats, this exercise provided insight into the effects temporal distribution of scat deposition had on population estimators. We removed 10 scats that were old, based on our classification scheme. This removal reduced the number of individuals detected to 13; however, population estimates were similar to those derived when all scats were included (CAPWIRE: n = 19, 95% CI = 13–29; Chessel: n = 14, 95% CI = 10–18).\n\nCamera-trapping effort and capture success.—A contiguous block of habitat in Tost A (Figs. 1 and 2) was camera trapped over 65 consecutive days using 18 camera stations (12 May–16 July 2007; 1,114 total trap nights). It took 7 days to deploy all camera stations. The survey period began after all cameras were activated. Snow leopards were observed during 47 capture events (120 total photographs), leading to a capture rate of 10.77 snow leopard photos/100 trap nights (Jackson et al. 2009). In 13 of 47 capture events a specific individual could not be identified. Seven snow leopards were detected, including 1 female (SL-1) with 3 cubs (∼12 months of age), 2 adult males (SL-2 and SL-4), and 1 adult (SL-3) of undetermined sex. Three adults (SL-1, SL-2, and SL-4) and 3 cubs were detected within the first 4 trap nights. It took an additional 18 nights to detect the remaining adult snow leopard male, SL-3. The individual capture rate was 0.63 individuals (including cubs)/100 trap nights (Jackson et al. 2009).\n\nCapture–mark–recapture history and population estimates.—We captured SL-1 seven times, SL-2 sixteen times, SL-3 twice, and SL-4 four times. Capture rates declined after 40 days of trapping, particularly for SL-1 and her cubs. Cubs were not detected after the initial 40 days. Fifty-two percent of captures were made at 4 trap sites that were located on actively used travel routes with high abundance of snow leopard sign. Four camera stations (22%) did not detect any snow leopards (Jackson et al. 2009).\n\nData for the capture–mark–recapture analysis are provided in Jackson et al. (2009) and Appendixes III and IV. Although CAPTURE indicated a closed population over the entire 65-day period, the Stanley–Burnham test (Stanley and Burnham 1999) supported closure only for <57 days. Relative fit tests could not reject the null Mo model (constant capture probabilities) over the Mt (variation by time) and Mb, (behavioral response) models. Expected values were too small to test the Mh (heterogeneity) model and Mh versus Mbh (behavioral response and heterogeneity).\n\nThe simplest model, Mo, was most appropriate for our data based on these tests. The model selection criteria derived by CAPTURE also indicated that model Mo provided the best fit ( Appendix III). The Mh model, in which capture probabilities are heterogeneous as a result of factors including sex, age, activity patterns, and social status, was 2nd (model selection criteria = 0.84–0.95; Appendix III). However, small sample size does not provide sufficient power to discriminate between null and more complex models; therefore, we estimated abundance using the 2 best-fitting models. Population size estimates were 4 (95% CI = 4–4) adult snow leopards with both Mo and Mh ( Appendix IV). The narrow confidence interval indicated that we detected all snow leopards present during the survey. Capture probabilities were relatively high, ranging from 0.118 for 1-day trapping occasions to 0.563 for 7-day occasions ( Appendix IV), further supporting this conclusion.\n\nThe one-half MMDM was 3.38 km, yielding an effective area of 264 km2 for individually buffered camera stations and 294 km2 when the minimum convex polygon of stations was buffered. This resulted in densities of 1.5 (95% CI = 1.5–1.5) and 1.4 (95% = 1.4–1.4) snow leopards/100 km2, respectively (Table 3). Using the MMDM (6.75 km) as a buffer distance reduced densities to 0.8 (95% CI = 0.8–0.8) and 0.7 (95% CI = 0.7–0. 7) snow leopards/100 km2, respectively.\n\nComparison of noninvasive genetic and camera-trapping surveys.—Within Tost A, scats were collected on only 2 field days compared to a total of 65 days of sampling for camera trapping (Table 4). Total effort was 149 person-days for camera trapping of 1 site versus 59 person-days for the genetic survey of 3 sites (Noyon, Tost A, and Tost B). Genetic analysis costs at Texas A&M University were $10/sample for extraction and sequencing (n = 180 scats), $30/sample for individual identification (60 snow leopard scats), and $3/ sample for sex identification (60 snow leopard scats). Excluding equipment purchases, air travel, and United States salaries, our total survey expenditures were $5,230 for the genetic survey and $10,800 for camera trapping.\n\nDiscussion\n\nNoninvasive genetic survey.—Genetic analysis revealed that the majority of scats collected were deposited by red fox; only 41% were attributed to snow leopards. This high misidenti-fication rate was observed despite only sampling scats that were judged to be from our target species based on their appearance and associated sign. Red fox scats were found frequently (76.3% of the total) on active snow leopard scrape sites. Misidentification of carnivore scat has been reported in previous field studies incorporating genetics (Davison et al. 2002; Farrell et al. 2000; Perez et al. 2006). The error rate for snow leopards was 35% in Ladakh (Janečka et al. 2008), 51% in Mongolia (Janečka et al. 2008), and 41% in China and Kyrgyzstan (McCarthy et al. 2008), suggesting that this is a prevalent problem with carnivore fecal surveys.\n\nThe proportion of misidentified scats varied among transects, even within the same site (e.g., 38–89% for Tost B). Confirmed snow leopard scats per kilometer were 2- to 3-fold lower than those based on visual identification. Because snow leopard scat is misidentified frequently in the field, and the proportion might not be consistent across transects, its use in surveys should be discounted unless corroborated by genetic analysis. Trained dogs could be incorporated into snow leopard surveys to improve species-specific scat detection (Mackay et al. 2008).\n\nLowest numbers of scrapes were detected in Noyon. In this area scrapes per kilometer (3.46 scrapes/km) were similar to those previously observed in Ladakh, India (up to 2.6 scrapes/ km—Fox et al. 1991) and Nepal (2.46 scrapes/km, range 0.28— 4.96 scrapes/km—Ale et al. 2007). Other studies reported only total sign per kilometer after incorporating visually identified scats, making it difficult to make additional comparisons (Hussain 2003; Lovari et al. 2009; McCarthy et al. 2008). Scrape frequency was 3-fold higher in the Tost sites than in Noyon, even though numbers of detected individuals per kilometer were similar (1.1 versus 0.9 individuals/km, respectively) Jackson et al. (2006) noted that sign indexes likely underestimate abundance based on their camera-trapping data. Marking behavior in snow leopards is behaviorally, seasonally, and site-dependent (Ahlborn and Jackson 1988). Such factors likely influence scraping frequency, limiting the utility of this type of sign for indexes of abundance, a conclusion consistent with the discrepancies we observed.\n\nThe genetic survey was effective for documenting presence of snow leopards. This species was detected on 11 of 13 transects sampled across 3 different sites in 8 days of fieldwork. We obtained enough individual recaptures to make preliminary estimates of population size. The maximum-likelihood estimator of CAPWIRE can in some cases outperform rarefaction methods because it incorporates heterogeneity in capture probabilities (Miller et al. 2005). This is largely dependent on how individual capture probabilities fit the 2-category model, compared to the equal probability assumed in rarefaction approaches.\n\nWe used both models (rarefaction and 2-category) because we did not have a priori knowledge of capture probabilities. Our estimate derived using the heterogeneity model was not significantly different from the rarefaction results. The long persistence of scat in dry, cold environments makes it difficult to determine whether pooling samples into 1 temporal period violated population closure, potentially inflating size estimates. However, excluding samples defined as old did not change our results substantially.\n\nCamera-trapping survey.—The camera-trapping rate in Tost Uul was relatively high (10.77 snow leopard photos/100 nights compared to 0.09, 0.93, and 2.37 snow leopard photos/100 nights in the Tien Shan Mountains of Kyrgyzstan and China— McCarthy et al. 2008), and 3.5 snow leopard photos/100 nights in the western Sayan Mountains of Russia (Subbotin and Istomov 2009). Photographic captures were similar to those observed over 2 successive years in Ladakh, India (9.41 and 15.11 photos/100 nights—Jackson et al. 2006). Capture probabilities in our survey ranged from 0.12 for 1-day sampling occasions to 0.56 for 7-day occasions (see Appendix IV); in contrast, tiger capture probabilities ranged from 0.04 (3-day occasions) to 0.26 (4- to 6-day occasions) for several surveys (Karanth et al. 2004; Karanth and Nichols 1998). The mean interval between snow leopard captures was 9.3 nights, lower than in the Ladakh study (14.5 nights) and substantially less than the mean for tiger captures (99.4 nights, 19 studies), but consistent with intervals for areas where tiger densities approach 10 individuals/100 km2 (Carbone et al. 2001). Repeated use of well-defined travel routes by snow leopards in the Gobi appears to enable high capture rates when appropriate camera-trapping sites are selected.\n\nUnfortunately, high capture rates and detection probabilities do not necessarily lead to more robust population estimates. It also is necessary to obtain sufficient samples over an area large enough to encompass a significant portion of the population (Otis et al. 1978; Thompson 2004). This is especially problematic when surveying rare and difficult to detect carnivores. The small area we were able to survey within the 65-day period exemplifies the difficulty of meeting this goal. The narrow confidence intervals and selection of the simplest capture model suggest that although we may have detected nearly all individuals within the specific study site because of the uniform trap layout and high capture rates, our sample was likely insufficient for estimating population size with the capture-mark-recapture model (Otis et al. 1978; White et al. 1982). In addition, the relevance of our estimate for overall abundance in the region is difficult to assess, because the area covered was limited.\n\nWhite et al. (1982) recommended using closed population models to estimate population size with more than 20 individuals. Even a cursory review of the literature indicates that camera-trapping surveys of felids rarely attain this threshold. There is no snow leopard survey that we are aware in which >10 individuals were observed during an independent session (Jackson et al. 2006; McCarthy et al. 2008; Subbotin and Istomov 2009). Few surveys of other cat species have had larger sample sizes. For example, only 3 of 15 camera-trapping surveys of tigers had >20 photo-captured individuals (Harihar et al. 2009). We found only 1 survey of jaguars that detected >11 individuals (Soisalo and Cavalcanti 2006). Ocelots numbered <10 in 3 published camera-trap studies (Haines et al. 2006; Maffei and Noss 2008; Trolle and Kery 2003). This is a direct result of the limited resources researchers have when conducting camera-trapping surveys of species with inherently low densities.\n\nComparison of noninvasive genetic and camera-trapping methods.—Each approach provided information on snow leopard presence-absence, the minimum number of individuals detected, and estimates of abundance. At 1 of the sites (Tost A) we conducted both surveys for direct comparison of results. During the noninvasive genetic survey of this site we collected 84 scats on 4 transects over the course of only 2 days. Genetic identification confirmed that 33 originated from snow leopards. This species was detected on all 4 transects, with a total of 3 males and 2 females being observed. In Tost A we found many active scrapes. Two months later the camera-trapping survey identified 7 individuals (including 3 cubs); however, it took 11 field days (7 days to deploy cameras and 4 trap nights) to detect 6 and 25 field days to observe all 7. Recaptures were common with both methods, enabling population estimates. Population size derived from camera trapping (4 adults, with additional 3 cubs) was similar to the number of individuals (5) genetically observed among the scats collected at this site.\n\nSeveral important factors must be considered when comparing camera-trapping and genetic surveys. First, sub-adults typically are excluded from capture–mark–recapture estimates. In contrast, age of individuals cannot be inferred from scat; thus, the data set might include subadults. Camera trapping also provides date and time of each capture allowing a definition of sampling periods, but unless the same transects are sampled repeatedly, no definite temporal bounds exist for scat surveys. If scats persist in the field for >2 months, violations to population closure could exist. However, the number of individuals genetically detected in Tost A was below that observed by camera trapping, suggesting that migrants and transients might not significantly affect the genetic survey. Scat sampling can fail to detect individuals that have lower marking activity, as was the case with subadult wolves (Marucco et al. 2009).\n\nDensity.—The geographic extent of our study population was uncertain. This is a problem faced in many wildlife surveys (Wilson and Anderson 1985), because most cannot cover the entire geographic area encompassed by a population, often for logistical reasons alone. Researchers, therefore, typically use density to compare abundance and population trends, which requires a careful definition of effective area surveyed (Wilson and Anderson 1985). One of the most difficult problems to overcome when monitoring populations is defining this parameter critical for assessing density and study effort.\n\nA common approach is to buffer the locations sampled (camera stations or scat transects) with a distance representative of movement patterns in the area (Wilson and Anderson 1985). Subsequent densities therefore are influenced strongly by the distribution of the sampled points, the concordance between the buffered area and home ranges, and the metric used as the buffer (Balme et al. 2009; Maffei and Noss 2008). Much debate surrounds how this metric, a surrogate for movement distances, should be derived (Balme et al. 2009; Dillon and Kelly 2008; Soisalo and Cavalcanti 2006; Wilson and Anderson 1985). Previously, studies have shown that using derivations of the mean of the maximum distance between successive captures yields reasonable densities (Jackson et al. 2006; Karanth and Nichols 1998; Silver et al. 2004; Wilson and Anderson 1985).\n\nSome studies also have used mean home-range diameter or summary statistics of directly observed movements when telemetry data were available (Balme et al. 2009; Dillon and Kelly 2008; Soisalo and Cavalcanti 2006). In most snow leopard field sites telemetry is logistically not feasible (Jackson and Ahlborn 1989; McCarthy et al. 2005). Applying telemetry data to different sites or periods could lead to densities biased by previously observed movement patterns. We thus chose to use one-half MMDM and MMDM for estimating our effective areas and densities. In a study of leopards one-half MMDM provided meaningful density estimates from camera-trapping data (Balme et al. 2009). However, concurrent global positioning system telemetry and camera-trapping jaguar studies found that one-half MMDM underestimated distances moved, significantly inflating density (Soisalo and Cavalcanti 2006). In another study MMDM buffers resulted in ocelot densities consistent with radiotracking data (Dillon and Kelly 2008). These discrepancies likely are caused by site-specific differences in habitat distribution, individual movement, and distribution of sampling locations.\n\nOur estimates varied from 1.5 individuals/100 km2 from camera trapping to 5.9 individuals/100 km2 from the noninvasive genetic survey (using one-half MMDM). Bold and Dorjzunduy (1976) estimated 4.4 individuals/100 km2 in Tost Uul, although they did not explain clearly how this estimate was derived. Snow leopard densities have ranged from a low of 0.2 individuals/100 km2 in SaryChat Zapovednik, Kyrgyzstan (McCarthy et al. 2008) to 4.5 individuals/100 km2 (2002) and 8.5 individuals/100 km2 (2003) in Hemis National Park, India (Jackson et al. 2006). Jackson et al. (2006) noted that narrow spacing of camera stations in 2003 likely led to an overestimation of density. Methods used to define effective areas have been inconsistent among snow leopard surveys. The few studies reporting density have used either one-half MMDM (Jackson et al. 2009), mean home-range diameter inferred from ungulate density (McCarthy et al. 2008), or an ad hoc estimation of study area size (Lovari et al. 2009). This lack of consistency prevents direct comparisons. A method of defining study areas should be used consistently across snow leopard surveys conducted by different research groups.\n\nDespite comparable one-half MMDM distances from scat and photo captures (2.84 km versus 3.38 km, respectively), the effective areas covered by the 2 surveys contributed to substantial differences in density. Densities from the genetic survey were nearly 4-fold greater than from camera trapping (∼5.4/100 km2 versus 1.4/100 km2). This can be attributed largely to 2 main factors. First, cubs were excluded in population estimates from camera trapping; in contrast, all detected individuals were used in the genetic survey. Second, the broader spacing of camera stations compared to scats collected along transects resulted in a greater effective area. This is clearly seen in Tost A, where the camera survey covered a 2.5-fold larger area (Fig. 2). In addition, multiple snow leopards frequently mark and deposit scats in common sites such as prominent outcrops and saddles (Ahlborn and Jackson 1988). When transects are selected preferentially to cover these sites, a large portion of the population can be detected within a relatively small area. Finally, the persistence of scat in cold, dry environments makes it difficult to define the length of the survey when collected scats are pooled into 1 sampling period, although excluding scats judged to be old did not significantly change our estimates. The combination of these factors, particularly the reduced size of the area covered in each site (Fig. 2), seems to inflate density derived from scat transects. To minimize such bias in noninvasive genetic surveys scat transects need to be separated spatially and oriented to maximize the area surveyed. It can be advantageous to sample a greater number of shorter transects (Ahlborn and Jackson 1988). These modifications should be combined with a stratified sampling design that ensures a more uniform distribution of sampled points than in our study.\n\nBecause of the uncertainties involved in deriving density estimates, Jackson et al. (2009) recommended that surveys report basic capture indexes (e.g., minimum number of individuals detected) and trapping effort (e.g., photographs per 100 trap nights). Similarly, some standardized metrics also should be used in genetic surveys. We propose reporting number of genetically verified snow leopard scats per kilometer and individual snow leopards per kilometer, along with derived densities. Information on the spatial distribution of transects and effort per site defined as transect kilometer per square kilometer also is necessary for meaningful comparisons. This would facilitate comparisons between surveys undertaken in different areas and habitats without relying on possibly questionable density estimates.\n\nLogistical advantages and disadvantages of methods.—To attain the target of 20 individuals proposed by White et al. (1982) a snow leopard survey must cover a large contiguous area. In regions where densities are ∼3 snow leopards/100 km2 field teams would need to survey approximately 700 km2 while avoiding home-range-size gaps. Given poor access, rough terrain, and often high altitude of snow leopard habitat, this presents a logistically daunting task. Assuming 1.5 camera stations/25 km2, availability of 20 stations (each with 2 cameras), and the ability to set 3 stations daily, it would take approximately 7 days to set 20 stations covering only 350 km2. After six 3-day sampling occasions (areas with low capture probability would likely require more) it would take another 10 days to move the stations and survey an additional 350 km2 over another 18-day period. Seven more days would be required to take down the stations. A field team would have difficulty covering ∼700 km2 within 60 days. In contrast, a noninvasive genetic survey could be conducted in a shorter time frame. Assuming 2 transects within each 25-km2 block, 28 blocks sampled at a rate of 1 block per day, and 4 additional days for travel between more distant sites, a genetic survey could cover the same ∼700-km2 area within approximately 32 days.\n\nNoninvasive genetic surveys do not require specialized or expensive field equipment. The ability to complete transects rapidly, and the relatively high detection rates, enable more sites and larger areas to be surveyed. Further, scat surveys yield DNA samples of populations, thereby greatly expanding the scope of information that can be generated. The cost also is substantially lower, in our case <50% that of camera trapping even though we sampled 2 additional sites. However, genetic surveys involve sophisticated laboratory facilities, trained personnel, and additional time and financial cost to complete analysis after the field session. Some countries within the distribution of the snow leopard currently lack the necessary laboratories for genetic analysis and have restrictions on the export of fecal material.\n\nConservation implications.—Quantitative status and distribution surveys of snow leopards are notably difficult compared to those of other rare carnivores, such as tigers, leopards, or jaguars that tend to have greater road access in their study areas. Camera trapping has offered a major advance for research and conservation of snow leopards. However, this approach is hampered by the rugged terrain, poor access, field logistics, and subsequent small sample sizes. Our results suggest that population estimates in larger areas are more attainable with noninvasive genetic surveys because of the ability to detect multiple individuals with less field effort.\n\nExamination of genetic data also can offer invaluable insight into relatedness, dispersal, population structure, and landscape connectivity (Schwartz et al. 2007), which is critical for conservation planning. The information camera trapping can provide on these topics is limited. Samples collected during wide-ranging, noninvasive genetic surveys can be used to address these population-level questions. This approach will be useful for identifying core snow leopard populations and landscape-level mapping of corridors that likely play a key role in the long-term persistence of snow leopards, particularly in disjunct mountain ranges.\n\nMore research is needed to establish optimal strategies for scat sampling, given different snow leopard densities, habitat factors, and terrain conditions. Behavior and social structure influence marking and scat deposition and need to be understood to model capture probabilites (Marucco et al. 2009). Concurrent genetic surveys and telemetry studies could explore various sampling strategies under specific environmental and biological conditions (Balme et al. 2009). However, because of financial and logistical constraints, such studies will be limited to only a few sites. For results to be widely applicable research among groups should be coordinated so that the selected sites are representative of snow leopard populations across most of the range.\n\nOur results suggest that the collection and genetic analysis of scats offers a more efficient means than camera trapping for detecting snow leopards in terms of field effort, total effort, and financial expenditure. The main factor is the reduction in time required to sample populations. Time spent in the field by researchers in many areas of central Asia occupied by snow leopards is severely constrained. Sample size and number of sampled sites principally limit population surveys. The ability to collect a greater number of samples over a larger area can yield better population estimates. Noninvasive genetics, therefore, has a greater potential for monitoring snow leopards on a larger scale than camera trapping. The main challenges that need to be addressed are factors that influence scat deposition, violations to population closure, absence of age information, optimal sampling schemes, and insufficient capacity for genetic analysis in many countries within the distribution of the snow leopard.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe appreciate funding generously provided by the Snow Leopard Conservancy, The National Geographic Society, Leonard X.
