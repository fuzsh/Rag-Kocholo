Because of this, he continued his film education and studied ‘Film Directing’ at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Ghent.\n\nAt this Film Academy, Machiel was seen as a filmmaker with authorship. In his films, he is looking for content in stories and personalities that somehow reflect his inner life and also have a universal appeal. This content has a few recurring themes which involves in particular: the search for meaning in life, issues of injustice, the strife for an ideal self and/or world and a feeling that is called Weltschmerz. This feeling can be described as a mood of weariness or sadness about the existence of evil and suffering in the world.\n\nFinally, an important goal for him as a filmmaker is to create worlds that stand on their own and tell something universal about the human race. Crucial elements that contribute to this are: a high level of authenticity; universal content that is author-driven; a plot that shows something essential about the main character; a match between content and (experimental) form and finally, the existence of an inner story. The six films, he is working on now, contain most of these elements and are busy to grow towards organic wholes. 'The Sako Tapes' is the first film that is finished and he would love to share it with the world.\n\nSee More\n\nNatasha Pizzey-Siegert\n\nAward-Winning Filmmaker\n\nNatasha Pizzey-Siegert is a filmmaker and multimedia journalist based in Mexico City.
