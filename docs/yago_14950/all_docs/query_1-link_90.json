The Broadway musical is modernized, made more streetwise and brought back to life in this new version that’s iintimate and hip, sarcastic and flip. Director Will Gluck and the producers tailor this to production to Quvenzhane Wallis’ talents, and it pays dividends. Cameron Diaz vamps it up, Jamie Foxx is the rich would-be mayor and Bobby Cannavale his campaign manager. The film staggers through its third act, though. ** ½\n\n“Big Hero 6”: (Animation action comedy, PG, 108 minutes, reviewed by Richard Roeper, Chicago Sun-Times). Disney’s animated story about a teenager befriending a health-care robot is a big, gorgeous adventure with wonderful voice performances, some dark undertones that give the story more depth, an uplifting message and more than a few laugh-out-loud moments. ***½\n\n“Birdman”: (comedy/drama, R, 119 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). In the crowning performance of his career, the darkly funny, brooding Michael Keaton plays a faded movie star attempting a comeback by directing and starring in a Broadway play. This is a strange and beautiful and unique film, one of the best movies of the year. ****\n\n“Dumb and Dumber To”: (comedy, PG-13, 110 minutes, reviewed by Moore). Those fart-joke farceurs, the Farrellys, re-team with stars Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels and an equally aged supporting cast for a sequel of occasional funny lines, random uproarious sight gags and bodily function jokes, all scented with a whiff of sad desperation. They're \"Stooges\" in a post-\"Hangover\" world, and the staleness shows. * 1/2\n\n\"Exodus: Gods and Kings\": (action adventure, PG-13, 142 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). Director Ridley Scott's borderline-lunatic, bold, gargantuan and visually stunning epic is in some ways more reminiscent of his \"Gladiator\" than \"The Ten Commandments.\" Playing an intense, sword-wielding, tormented, visionary Moses, Christian Bale humanizes one of the most iconic figures of all time. ****\n\n“Gone Girl”: (thriller, R, 149 minutes, reviewed by Moore). This is David “Zodiac” Fincher’s seriously twisted, twisty-turny adaptation of Gillian Flynn’s novel about a husband accused of killing his wife, first by the outrage engine known as cable news, and then by the cops. But it’s also about public opinion, modern marriage and other issues. It’s good, but the film is absurdly long, occasionally miscast and lacks much mystery. ***\n\n\"The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies\": (fantasy, PG-13, 140 minutes, reviewed by Moore). This finales ends this not-really-a-trilogy off in style. That means stuffing in everything the fans want, or that Jackson thinks the fans want out of these films made from the novel that came before \"The Lord of the Rings.\" So \"Battle\" is bookended by two epic fights; there are stunning set pieces; the invented love story is back, but it still doesn’t work; and “Rings” characters are brought in to link the two sets of movies in the most heavyhanded way. It's the best film of this trilogy, but that’s not saying much. ** 1/2\n\n\"Horrible Bosses 2\": (comedy, R, 108 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). The sequel to the mediocre, uneven \"Horrible Bosses\" is so lazy it's not even about horrible bosses. It's a slapstick kidnapping yarn as the three dimwits (Jason Bateman, Charlie Day, Jason Sudeikis) plot revenge against a thieving business kingpin. Also back is Jennifer Aniston as the sex-addicted dentist, one of the most poorly drawn, pathetic characters of the year. * 1/2\n\n“Interstellar”: (Adventure/mystery/sci-fi, PG-13, 169 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). What a beautiful and epic film this is, filled with great performances, tingling our senses with masterful special effects, daring to be openly sentimental, asking gigantic questions about the meaning of life and leaving us drained and grateful for the experience. ****\n\n“The Hunger Games - Mockingjay Part 1”: (science fiction, PG-13, 123 minutes, reviewed by Moore). Dark and hazy, relentlessly glum and dull, this is the first film in this sci-fi series to refuse to even attempt to stand on its own. If you haven’t seen previous films, good luck, and any climactic action is saved for Part 2. Traumatized Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (and Josh Hutcherson) take sides in a revolt she inspired, with competing plotting and video campaigning by various characters. There is more overt humor and melodrama this time, and it's not a bad film, but just a tedious good-looking set-up for the finale. **\n\n\"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb\": (comedy adventure, PG, 97 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). Sitting through the thoroughly tiresome final chapter in this trilogy, I wondered: Did anybody involved in the making of this movie actually believe it was a quality effort? Ben Stiller, Robin Williams and Owen Wilson are among the terrific actors sinking in the cinematic quicksand. *½\n\n\"Nightcrawler\": (crime thriller, R, 117 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). As a freelance vulture who records video of crime and crash scenes for TV news, Jake Gyllenhaal plays one of the most disturbing movie characters of the year. But the film veers from dark satire to tense crime thriller before the tires come off near the end, leaving the entire vehicle just short of worth recommending. **½\n\n“Penguins of Madagascar”: (PG, 92 minutes, reviewed by Moore). These penguins are as cute and cuddly as ever and often downright hilarious. Kids will giggle at the plucky impertinence, pratfalls, sheer breakneck speed of the gags, and the occasional gas-passing joke. And for parents, there’s puns, movie references and impersonations. The plot is about dopey and adorable newly hatched Private’s efforts to become a “meaningful and valued member of the team” against the villains. ***\n\n“St. Vincent”: (comedy, PG-13, 102 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). This story of a chain-smoking gambler baby-sitting the neighbor kid is a prime showcase for Bill Murray and his skill set. Nearly every scene is contrived, but writer-director Ted Melfi has a nice way with dialogue, and the cast – including Melissa McCarthy and young Jaeden Lieberher – is uniformly outstanding. ***1/2\n\n\"The Theory of Everything\": (biography, PG-13, 123 minutes, reviewed by Roeper). Playing the young Stephen Hawking from reckless Cambridge student to brilliant physicist, Eddie Redmayne undergoes a remarkable transformation. But it's a memorable performance in a rather ordinary love story about his romance with future wife, Jane (Felicity Jones). **½\n\n\"Wild\": (drama, R, 115 minutes). The more time we spend with former heroin addict Cheryl Strayed, the more we feel the change in this young woman's heart and spirit as she hikes 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail by herself. It's a raw, beautiful performance by Reese Witherspoon, and Laura Dern is warm and wonderful as her mother. ***½\n\nAlso showing\n\nMartha’s Vineyard Film Society: Martha’s Vineyard Film Center, 78 Beach Road, Vineyard Haven: \"National Gallery,\" 4 p.m. Friday; \"Force Majeure,\" 7:30 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 4 p.m. Sunday; Winter Holiday Festival: Santa, singing, treats and film \"Home Alone,\" 1 p.m. Saturday; OPERA & BALLET in cinema: THE NUTCRACKER from the Vienna Staatsballett, noon Sunday; \"Awake: The Life of Yogananda,\" 7:30 p.m. Sunday. www.mvfilmsociety.com.\n\nWaters Edge Cinema: 237 Commercial St., Provincetown.
