        "text": "SUNNY SIDE UP\n\n2019/Ireland (11 minutes)\n\nDirector: Peter Kilmartin\n\nPeter Pringle and Sunny Jacobs both served years in prison for crimes they did not commit. After being exonerated, what are the chances they both met and fell in love? This film explores how love can prevail, and hearts can keep beating when a soul is dragged through so much.\n\nTHE NIGHT IS BLACK AND THE DAY IS WHITE\n\n2019/Ireland/United Kingdom (8 minutes)\n\nDirector: Joe McStravickA mother and a father share their experiences of living with, caring for and loving a child who has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\n\nTHE WORKHOUSE PRODIGY\n\n2020/Ireland (7 minutes)\n\nDirector: Paul Murphy\n\nBorn in a workhouse, in post famine Ireland Johnny Butler's prospects are not great, but help comes from the most unlikely source.\n\nMAID IN AMERICA\n\n2019/Ireland (1 minute)\n\nDirector: Kathy Raftery\n\nJosephine from County Galway shares a story of when she encountered a member of the Rockefeller family whilst she was working as maid in America in the early 1950's.\n\nTHE LAST ORGANIST\n\n2019/Ireland (6 minutes) Director: Paddy McConnell\n\nA 94 year old organist reminisces on his love of music and his move to Ireland from Belgium 67 years ago.\n\nCOMING HOME: AG TEACHT ABHAILE\n\n2019/Ireland/United States (24 minutes)\n\nCo-directors: Dylan Ladds and Ryan Scura\n\nPaddy O'Leary grew up in Wexford, Ireland, but didn't discover his love and talent for running until he moved to San Francisco.

This is a distinction that did not come without controversy in the extremely Catholic Ireland of the nineteen seventies and eighties, but Dr. Rynne persevered in the face of opposition from the church. In the eighties, he challenged the restrictive laws on contraceptives by selling condoms without a prescription. He got his day in court and forced the government to change policy. In 1990, Dr. Rynne was about to perform a vasectomy on a patient, when a gunman entered his surgery and shot him. After surviving the attempt on his life, he would later meet with his assailant and forgive him.\n\nSTRONG AT THE BROKEN PLACES\n\n2018/Ireland (14 minutes)\n\nDirector: Anna Rogers\n\nRaped at 14 by a Catholic Priest, human rights activist Colm O’Gorman challenges Pope Francis to tell the truth about the cover up of abuse during his divisive visit to Ireland in August 2018."
