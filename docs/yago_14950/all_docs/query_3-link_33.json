        "text": "There’s a drug for everything online….\n\nSo we’ve just announced the cast for ‘The Familiar Sting’, my new NI Screen funded short about heroin addicts and abortion in Northern Ireland. That’s pretty exciting. Especially when I look at the names of the actors and actresses that are going to bring the words to life. Aimee Richardson and Forest Campbell as the leads, Ellie McKay and Nigel O’Neill in support. Brilliant performers, some that I worked with before. All directed by the extremely talented Joe McStravick and produced by Chloe Langton….Seems like a good reason to start a blog. I’d been thinking about it for awhile. Anyone that knows me knows that I have opinion on most things, whether or not anyone wants to listen to my ramblings is something different altogether. Still sounding off into the impassive grey hum of the inter-ether is a way to spend an hour or two I suppose. Even if no one listens it’s bound to have some sort of therapeutic benefit…. I won’t be a regular blogger, but you’ll definitely catch me online every now and again if you click subscribe below."
