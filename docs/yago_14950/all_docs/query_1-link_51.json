At Forward Festival, Felicitas Berger and I let us get inspired for our #CorporateDesign and #Branding work at Zoi by the latest AI advancements - especially by Max Lederer from Jung von Matt, Mieke Haase, or Deutsche & Japaner to name a few. Dreamy fact 💭: The first AI tools are learning to read brainwaves during sleep, and soon it may be possible to relive dreams with AI-generated technology. Find more insights in our blog post on Medium: https://lnkd.in/eHRPcvu8 Thanks Zoi for this great opportunity!\n\nWe have two exciting days ahead of us as we unite teams from all Schibsted offices for AI inspirational days! This internal event is all about exploring and learning about the latest trends and applications in AI that are shaping our future.🦾 We will listen to engaging sessions with leading AI experts and unleash creativity in a hackathon. 👉 Don't miss out on the insights! Follow us on Instagram to catch live updates and get a glimpse into how Schibsted is driving innovation from within: https://lnkd.in/d7jQsNGS #schibstedmarketplaces #Aiinspiration #innovation #schibstedhackday\n\n🚀 The future of AI art is here, and it's only limited by our imagination (and maybe our coffee supply ☕)! 🧠✨ With tools like Stable Diffusion, ControlNet, LoRAs, and AnimateDiffusion, we can create anything we dream up. Want to see a unicorn dancing in a neon cityscape? Done. 🦄💃🌆 So, why wait? Dive in, experiment, and let your creativity run wild. The only limit is how many crazy ideas you can come up with! Here's what I just made starting from an old picture of Kajurau temple. 🏛️🔮 #AIArt #TechInnovation #UnleashCreativity #DigitalArt #FutureIsNow #DreamBig #TechHumor\n\n1300 employees in Schibsted Nordic Marketplaces set aside two days for inspiration and hackathon on the topic of AI 🤖 Great vibe and lot’s of external inspirational speakers 🤩 Teams get the opportunity to play around and experiment with AI. We in the Mobility marketplace truly believe AI will radically change the role of marketplaces going forward. By combining this powerful tech with solving the Jobs to be Done for our users and customers we will deliver more, and different, great products! 🙌🏻 The internet drove cost of distribution down, AI will do the same with cost of development and cognitive work. Everyone in Schibsted have access to ChatGPT enterprise to boost productivity and learn more about how to use AI in their daily work. The future is exciting (and a bit scary…) ☀️"
