“I don’t know our son as well as I would like to, because he can’t express himself as I think he would like to be able to. But my heart knows him.” A mother and a father share their experiences of living with, caring for and loving a child who has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Directed by Joe McStravick.
