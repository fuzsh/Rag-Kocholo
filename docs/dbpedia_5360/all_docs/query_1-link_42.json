In 1976 Lewis began to plan the Robert Lewis Acting Company, which produced three productions in 1977 before folding for financial reasons. In the 1980s Lewis again explored the possibility of creating a company to be called the Robert Lewis Theatre Company. However, it did not grow beyond the planning and fundraising stage.
