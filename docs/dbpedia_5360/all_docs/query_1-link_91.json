        "text": "Ambush on Hill 689, 27 June, 1967\n\nCAP O-3 was ordered by the Marine HQ at KSCB to send a patrol to investigate suspected enemy rocket and mortar launch sites spotted earlier that day by an aerial observer. These sites were believed to be the source of a heavy attack on KSCB just after midnight that morning.\n\nThe patrol included CPL Dennis A. O'Connor, CPL James M. Shepard, Jr., LCPL Francisco A. Mazariegos, LCPL Earl B. Grissom, William Pennock, Richard Moison, Raymond Strehlow and HN Bell (the unit Hospital Corpsman), as well as the Popular Force contingent of local Bru tribesmen, all from Oscar-3. Also on this patrol as a volunteer was LCPL Charles Aaron Lynch of Oscar-1, who had been visiting some friends at O-3.\n\nThe patrol could see that 689 was under heavy attack by air assaults, but continued on, during the course of which they made contact with the arial observer, who was astounded to see them there. Nevertheless, he called off the assaults and the patrol continued up the hill.\n\nAccording to the 3/26 Command Chronology, by approximately 1230, the patrol had reached the top of Hill 689 As they reached the crest, they encountered a much larger enemy force set up in ambush, and began receiving heavy enemy fire, including rockets and automatic weapons. They immediately sustained several casualties KIA and WIA.\n\nAn artillery mission was called in, but landed nearly on top of their position. After the artillery fire, two men attempted to sweep the hill for friendly WIA and KIA, but were driven back. The survivors were unable to reach the KIA and wounded, except for one WIA they had already recovered who died en route. The survivors were forced to retreat, leaving two Marines (listed as MIA, but judging from Earl Grissom's account, almost certainly dead) and one Bru PF on the hill. The survivors fell back, while elements of the other CAPs were mustering a relief force.\n\nThe relief column was dispatched, but they were unable to gain the hill, being driven off by heavy fire and hampered by the reluctance of the Bru to ascend the hill. (The Bru usually knew when things were going to be very bad - their senses were much finer tuned than those of most Americans.)\n\nMeanwhile, India 3/26, which had been returning from an overnight patrol, had been re-routed to Hill 689 to assist the Oscar Marines.\n\nAccording to LCOL (then LT) \"Tony\" Anthony, a participant, CPT Coulter, India's CO, quickly deployed two platoons in the attack, both executing frontal assaults. 1st platoon was on the left portion of the hill, separated by a small saddle, and 2nd platoon assaulted the right hand portion of the hill. LTC Anthony's 2nd platoon assaulted their portion of the hill with the classic \"two up, one back\" - i.e., two squads on line and one in reserve.\n\nBoth the leading platoons were soon engaged in heavy fire-fights, including some literal hand-to-hand fighting, and sustained heavy casualties. The remainder of India 3/26 was soon deployed to assist.\n\nMeanwhile, elements of Lima 3/26 were air-lifted into the area by helicopter and soon deployed. They too encountered heavy fighting, and also soon began sustaining casualties.\n\nAccording to the 3/26 CC, by approximately 1935, the crest of Hill 689 had been cleared of NVA and the survivors of India and Lima companies joined to form a consolidated position.\n\nMost of the MIAs from CAC Oscar weredead, (though \"Red\" Strehlow had somehow survived). and 3/26 lost 14 men KIA in the engagement, for a total of 18 Americans killed in the actions on the hill. LCpl Charles M. Gattis, WIA, later died from wounds received on Hill 689, raising the toll to 19.\n\nJudging from first-hand accounts, there is little doubt that some of the casualties were the result of \"friendly fire.\"\n\nThere were also several men of H&S 3/26, A 1/13, and other units KIA on KSCB as a result of incoming fire.\n\nIn addition to the KIA, the men of 3/26 sustained a number of WIAs, among them Frank McCarthy, 3rd Plt. Commander of L 3/26.\n\n(For a detailed personal account of the ambush written by survivor Earl B. Grissom and information and pictures by survivors Richard Moison, William Pennock, and other survivors I have been able to locate, and personal accounts of the subsequent assault by some of the officers and men of 3/26, see : CAP Oscar History - O-3 Loses a Patrol - Ambush on Hill 689, 27 June, 1967. For more information on 3/26, see the battalion's website. Anyone who has a complete list of WIAs, especially one with their names, please contact me for inclusion. I am also looking for more information on HN Curtis D. Jackson of 3/26, KIA that day.)\n\nThe following men were KIA on Hill 689:\n\nFrancisco Alberto Mazariegos of Tampa, FL was born on 29 December 1947, and named for his father. He was part of a patrol from O-3 that was ambushed on Hill 689. (See above.) His name is on Panel 22E, Row 68 of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and a profile and remembrances can be found on the Vietnam Veterans' War Memorial site. (Note: Frank's middle name is almost always given on other sources as \"Albe\" - a typographical mistake apparently made early on. Since it was \"official\" it has been self-perpetuating. His full and correct name was as given above, as verified by his family.) Frank sent this poem home while in Vietnam, shortly before he was killed. I post it here and his picture with the permission of his sister, Mary, who provided them.\n\n10 February 1967\n\n\"Look, God, I have never spoken to You\n\nBut now I want to say, \"How do You do\"\n\nYou see God, they told me you didn't exist\n\nAnd like a fool, I believed all of this\n\nLast night from a shell hole I saw Your sky\n\nI figured right then they had told me a lie\n\nHad I taken the time to see the things You made,\n\nI'd have known they weren't calling a spade a spade\n\nI wonder, God if you'd shake my hand\n\nSomehow, I feel you will understand\n\nFunny, I had to come to this hellish place\n\nBefore I had time to see Your face\n\nWell, I guess there isn't much more to say\n\nBut I'm sure glad, God, I met You today\n\nI guess the zero hour will soon be here\n\nBut I'm not afraid since I know You're near\n\nThe signal!

He was described by his family as \"a fun-loving guy.\" He enlisted in the Marines in 1964, and was trained at MCRD San Diego and Camp Pendleton, California. His first tour was spent at Phu Bai. He already had considerable experience in-country, some of which will be familiar to those who served in Vietnam. His mother related to me that while he was still on his first tour, he was chased by a water buffalo (which, for some reason, seemed not to like Americans). The beast followed him through a house (RIGHT through it - they are built like bulldozers) and gored him badly enough to be sent to a hospital ship off the coast. He was subsequently returned to duty.\n\nDennis extended his tour of duty voluntarily, and spent his month's extension leave at home, although, as his mother put it; \"understandably, mostly with his girlfriend.\" Dennis told his mother that he wanted to return to help the people, and had plans to send a young man to the US for an education. Unfortunately, by the time he returned, the young man had been married, and was ineligibl;e for a visa. Although he was dedicated to what we were doing there, his mother Betty told me that when they left him at the airport, he seemed to have regretted his decision to return.\n\nAfter Dennis returned, he was reassigned to Phu Bai, but then was sent to Khe Sanh, where he was assigned to O-3. His niece wrote that on his first day there, he was assigned as part of the patrol from O-3 that was ambushed on Hill 689, where he was KIA. (See above.)\n\nDennis is buried at Fairhaven Memorial Park in Santa Ana, CA.\n\nHis name is on Panel 22E, Row 72 of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and a profile and remembrances can be found on the Vietnam Veterans' War Memorial site. Dennis was survived by his mother Betty and his father Joe, and his sister, Jo Ann, nieces Anne and Suzanne, a nephew, Dennis, cousins Blair and Cynthia, and by his former fiancee. His family provided his picture.\n\nDennis sent this poem home shortly before he was killed. Jane Fonda was in North Vietnam at the time, and there were protests against the war near his home. It is reprinted here courtesy of his family, who provided me with a copy.\n\nI’m Just a Fighting Boy\n\nI’m just a fighting boy, fighting is my life\n\nI risk my neck night after night\n\nI don’t ask questions I just do my job\n\nBut once in awhile my heart gives a throb\n\nWhy do you people, people back home\n\nLeave me over here all alone?\n\nMaybe the policy is not right,\n\nbut our boys are dying every night\n\nI fight for you every one no matter if liberal, conservative or none,\n\nSo why don’t you citizens unite into one and you can be sure we’ll get the job done?\n\nJust think for a moment what would have occurred\n\nif people during the other wars Had been so absurd,\n\nIf they had not united and fought as one,\n\nWe might have lived under the communist thumb.\n\nU.S. Army Special Forces Ambush and Rescue Operations on Hill 471, 29 January, 1968\n\nAfter the initial assault on Khe Sanh village, Combined Action Company Oscar and all other American units were withdrawn to the Khe Sanh Combat Base. However, the Marine command, perhaps fearing some might be enemy agents, refused entry to our Bru allies. Fortunately, the command of Special Forces Forward Operating Base 3 were glad to get our Bru soldiers, as they recruited Bru from the same tribes we did for service in their CIDG units. They were so happy to get more Bru, they were even willing to take the Marines! As a result, we fought and worked alongside them for the duration of the Siege, and occasionally ran patrols and outposts for them. In a few instances, we participated as volunteers in their operations. This describes one of those actions.\n\n(The following information was taken mainly from a letter and account of the action written March 10, 1997 from MSG Bill Wood to MAJ Harlan E. Van Winkle, US Army Special Forces, and to a lesser extent from the less accurate official records.)\n\nMSG Bill Wood and his team ran a mission to Hill 471, vicinity of Khe Sanh, on the morning of 29 January, 1968. The team consisted of himself, SFC Don Voorhees, SSG Gary Crone, and Bru CIDG soldiers Xon, To, Tu, and 7 other Bru whose names are not known, with SP5 Mike Mahoney as a volunteer \"straphanger.\" All the team except MSG Wood, SSG Crone, and one of the Bru were new.\n\nThe team was ambushed shortly after reaching the saddle of Hill 471 and came under heavy enemy fire, resulting in the team being split into three parts. One element consisted of MSG Wood and SSG Gary Crone, the second consisted of SFC Voorhees, and five of the remaining Bru CIDG accompanying them, and the third consisted of SP5 Michael Mahoney and at least two Bru CIDG. (Note: Several of the Bru team members are not accounted for in any of the records I currently have access to.)\n\nSSG Crone was KIA by enemy fire while trying to call in support, and his radio (the only one the team had) was rendered completely inoperable. MSG Wood was unable to recover SSG Crone's remains alone, so he rejoined SFC Voorhees and his segment of the team, which had already suffered two Bru casualties - their M-79 gunner was KIA and Xon was WIA.\n\nSP5 Mahoney was not with SFC Voorhees group. According to the official record, he had attempted to cover the retreat of his comrades and was hit by enemy fire. However, the official record errs in listing him as being KIA at this time, as an American was reported alive and moving by several observers at KSCB and FOB 3, at least as late as the time our relief force launched to recover the casualties. Since SSG Crone was undoubtedly KIA at the onset, that leaves only one possible American unaccounted for - SP5 Mahoney. (See below for details.)\n\nMSG Wood and SFC Voorhees determined to withdraw, as they had heavy casualties, no communications, and were seriously outnumbered. During the withdrawal, MSG Wood was wounded in the leg and Tu, one of the Bru CIDG, was KIA. Unable to communicate otherwise, MSG Wood wrote down a situation report and handed it to one of the remaining Bru CIDG with instructions to try to evade the enemy and get back to FOB 3.\n\nAfter the Bru had left on his mission, an H-34 helicopter piloted by LT Thieu, a Vietnamese pilot, dropped in suddenly despite the danger, and picked up MSG Wood, SFC Voorhees, and the remaining Bru CIDG. The LZ was too hot to recover any of the casualties, and SP5 Mahoney and his Bru were not in view at that time.\n\nGary was born on December 3rd, 1941. His home of record was York, PA. He joined the army, and served for 8 years, being promoted to Staff Sergeant. At the time of his death, he was serving with Special Forces at FOB 3, Khe Sanh, RVN, as a member of a team under the late MSG Bill Wood. On a mission to Hill 471, vicinity of Khe San, his team was ambushed, and SSG Crone was KIA. His remains were not recovered until after the Siege, in early April 1968. (See above for details.) After recovery, his remains were interred in Zion View, PA. His parents are buried there as well. Gary is survived by several family members, one of whom, his eldest sister, provided the photograph above and some of his biographical details.\n\nGary is honored on Panel 35E, Row 58, and on the Vietnam Veterans' War Memorial site and there is a mention of him on the Medics on the Wall site.\n\n(Ed. Note: there has been a story circulating for years that SSG Crone was captured alive and decapitated by the NVA. MSG Wood's comments clearly demonstrate that this tale is incorrect, as SSG Crone was definitely KIA at the onset. The story probably started because the head became detached from the body when it was recovered, after months of exposure. Whatever else the NVA or VC may have been responsible for, this was not one of them. MSG Wood expressed indignation about this story, as he viewed it as implying that he had left SSG Crone while he was still alive.)\n\nGary's sister sent me this poem that was returned with his effects. She believes it was either written by Gary or was important to him. It would have been written before his last patrol, as his death was too sudden for him to have penned it at the time he was killed. It seems strangely prophetic.\n\nWe have both had some English college professors look it over (several of them poets) and they have said they cannot find it under another author, but one said that it was a good piece of minimalist poetry. The other said; \"There's a kind of echo of the moment in \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" when the soldier in the trenches sees a butterfly, and while admiring its beauty is shot and killed. This appeared in the book, but was a major feature of the film, and might have stayed in this writer's imagination: that solitude and that quiet reflectiveness associated with the moment of death. What's interesting here is the existentialist awareness of our inability to make sense of things: one of the great legacies of the Second World War. It's notable that this writer does not make a cheap joke or a sentimental moment out of this sense of absurdity, but just quietly speaks and fades away.\" I agree. In any case, here it is as received.\n\nWhen I was young,\n\nI was told over and over\n\nYou know nothing..\n\nI searched,\n\nI listened, I saw, and still,\n\nI know nothing\n\nNow as I lay in darkness\n\nand my blood seeps slowly into the earth\n\nI open my eyes and see..\n\nA spider mending his web,\n\nNow I know\n\nThat I still know nothing.\n\nTommy, (as his family called him), was born in Sayre, Pa. on October 18, 1945. He graduated from Towanda Area High School in 1963 and Lake City Forest Ranger School in Lake City, Fla., in 1964. Among his interests were football, skydiving and hunting.\n\nHe joined the army on Sept. 20, 1965, and was promoted to Specialist 5. He was serving with Headquarters and Headquarters Company (Command and Control), 5th Special Forces Group (Airborne), 1st Special Forces when he was killed while serving as a volunteer member of the reconnaissance team under the late MSG Bill Wood (above). His team was ambushed and came under heavy enemy fire, resulting in the team being split. According to the official record, Tommy positioned himself in front of the team and commenced to lay a heavy volume of automatic weapon fire while his team was moving to a secure area. After the team had reached a relatively secure area, he attempted to withdraw but was hit by enemy fire.\n\nThe \"official\" account is incorrect at this point as it states Tommy was KIA. However, based on reports by ground observers at Khe Sanh Combat Base and aerial observers, though he was badly wounded in the leg, he fashioned a make-shift crutch and was seen alive for some time evading the enemy forces and attempting to reach US forces. He was unable to, and we were unfortunately unaware of his position and situation until after our return. At some point, he must have either died of wounds, or been hit again. He was run as MIA, and his remains were not recovered until after the Siege, in early April 1968, by Navy HN Robert \"Johnny\" Gaspard and Marines from Company C, 1/9, who were digging in on the hill after it was re-taken. \"Doc\" Gaspard noted; \"He had a broken leg and what appeared to be a walking stick (crutch) besides him.\"\n\nSpec 5 Mahoney was awarded the Bronze Star Medal with V for Valor and Oak Leaf Cluster for Meritorious Service, the Purple Heart, National Defense Service Medal, Vietnamese Service Medal, Vietnamese Campaign Ribbon and the Combat Infantryman's Badge.\n\nHe was 22 years old at the time of his death, and was survived by his parents, Rita B. and Francis Joseph Mahoney and 3 sisters, Frances Jo, Marianne, and Peggy, who provided his picture. He is remembered on Panel 35E, Line 61 of the Vietnam Memorial. He is also remembered on the Vietnam Veterans' War Memorial site.\n\nBru CIDG Troops with MSG Wood's Team\n\nTu - KIA\n\n1 Bru (name unknown) - KIA\n\nXon - WIA\n\nTo - Status Unknown\n\n6 Bru - names and status unknown\n\nI regret I don't have all their names, pictures, and information. They served well, and deserve remembrance.\n\nShortly after MSG Wood's med-evac, an American Special Forces team, HF Denver, plus the author as a volunteer \"straphanger\" augmented by Bru CIDG forces, were assembled to attempt to recover SFC Crone's remains, MIA SP5 Mahoney and the other KIA / WIAs.\n\nMuch of the following is drawn from the written account of the team leader, CPT H. E. \"Rip\" Van Winkle, as edited and updated by the writer. It is based on contemporary after-action reports, maps, official accounts, and personal recollections of the surviving team members.\n\n\"I was unable to speak to the wounded team leader prior to his medevac, which left a large gap in first hand information. This lack proved critical in all subsequent mission decisions. The decision was made to go in with eight Americans and sixteen Bru.\"\n\n(Ed. Note: Such knowledge probably would have been of small value in any case, as MSG Wood's estimate of enemy forces was either low, or the enemy had placed more troops in the area between the ambush of Wood's team and the arrival of HF Denver.)\n\nThe American team members were:\n\nCPT Harlan E. 'Rip' Van Winkle, XO, \"A\" 221\n\n1LT Grenville Sutcliffe, FOB 3 Assistant S-3 Officer (Rip's designated replacement).\n\nSFC Robert Scully, Medic, FOB 3\n\nSFC Charles N. Tredinnick, Senior Combat Engineer. \"A\" 221\n\nSGT Dennis C. Lansing, Junior Communications NCO, \"A\" 221\n\nSGT Donald R. Rumph, Junior Medic \"A\" 221\n\nSP5 John L. Frescura, Junior Combat Engineer. \"A\" 221\n\nPFC Freeman J. Taylor, USMC, CAC O-2 (volunteer)\n\n\"We lifted off at 1135 hours and inserted on the southeastern point of the ridge-line of Hill 471. The insertion went off without problems. Cover was non-existent and concealment limited to a stand of elephant grass that averaged less than three feet in height and a few scraggly bushes.\n\nWe set up a hasty perimeter with SFC Tredinnick. SP5 Frescura and four Bru took the east, SGT Lansing, SGT Rumph and four Bru were covering the north. 1LT Sutcliffe, SFC Scully and four Bru covered west, while PFC Taylor and I, with the remaining four Bru covered the south. The saddle where the bodies were located was to the front of Tredinnick and Frescura.\n\nTredinnick took three Bru and moved forward, down into the saddle and up to the top of the small peak on the other side, a distance of perhaps 150-175 meters. They did not locate the bodies or make any contact. However, Tredinnick relayed that he had spotted a large force of enemy ground troops attempting to encircle us from the east. I instructed him to return to the ridgeline and reestablish the perimeter.\n\nUpon his return, he moved to my position. We were discussing our situation when we heard and spotted movement in a small bush directly to our front, probably less than six feet away. Tredinnick asked; \"What was that?\" just before we were fired upon by an enemy rifleman from a well concealed fighting position. The rounds passed between us. How they missed hitting us, I'll never know. We returned fire and I dropped an M-26 fragmentation grenade into the hole.\n\nA short time later 1LT Sutcliffe received a serious wound in the throat while using the radio to get and coordinate support. Taylor went to him, then SFC Scully, who was was already working on him when Tredinnick and I went to him. Tredinnick started back to his position on the perimeter. I turned my attention to getting fire support. We received fire from every point except the north, with the heaviest coming from the west and southeast.\n\nA literal storm of enemy hand grenades were then thrown into our position. Some reports stated the sky turned \"black\" with grenades. PFC Taylor shouted a warning and gave me a \"friendly\" shove. For as many grenades as were thrown, there seemed to be a lot of \"duds\". Others did not explode with nearly the force of US grenades. One of the weaker ones went off between my legs and I received a dozen or so painful, but not disabling, fragmentation wounds.\n\nI heard the distinctive sound of a bullet strike someone behind me. I turned and saw Tredinnick lying on the ground.\n\n(Ed. Note: SFC Tredinnick had been heading back to his exposed position on the left flank to rally his strikers.)\n\nSGT Rumph, PFC Taylor and I converged on him. He had been wounded low down on the left side of his chest. The entrance wound was very small but the exit wound was massive. His last words to me were; \"It hurts real bad, sir.\" Rumph and Taylor were performing immediate first aid, and I put all of my effort to moving us some place reasonably safe for a medevac.\n\nSFC Sculley and SGT Rumph, the two medics on the ground, deserve special mention for their valiant action under fire. Both tended the wounded and dying American and Bru troops with cool and calm skill, even though they were continually exposed to a withering concentration of enemy fire.\n\nThe volume of enemy fire was such that I felt we were in danger of being overrun at any point. Fire support was limited to our helicopter gunships, unable to do much because of the close proximity of the two forces. During one of the gunship runs, the door gunner missed Taylor and me by less than six inches and shot La, the Bru platoon leader in both legs, shattering both of them. I don't fault the gunner. He was doing his best to provide needed support under very trying circumstances. We had not received any fire from the north, and SGT Rumph, SFC Scully, and PFC Taylor were already hauling wounded down the steep north slope of the hill.\n\nSGT Lansing had turned his attention to the threat from the south and west, focusing on a small gully that led from the south slope directly into our position. While positioning his Bru machine gunner, Pa Lang, to cover this approach, the gunner was shot dead, and the entire element was pinned down. By then, the only Americans still on the hill and carrying on the fight were SGT Lansing, SP5 Frescura and myself. The others were either wounded or assisting with the wounded. Perhaps ten or eleven of the Bru were also still firing.\n\nWe started to ease back from the south slope trying to put a little distance between us and the enemy. The width of the ridge line where we were was less than sixty meters and the enemy owned at least a third of that. By getting my force down below the crest on the north side, I was finally able to call in some air strikes. We had been on the ground over an hour and the fight itself was about forty-five minutes old.\n\nThe Forward Air Controller (FAC) on hand when we inserted had to leave us to refuel. He was replaced by a USMC FAC with the call sign of \"American Beauty Delta\". This gentleman deserves a lot of credit for getting the rest of us off the hill alive with little further damage. The manner in which he coordinated all of the air support into that one small area without doing us any more damage was nothing short of phenomenal. He was also dealing with two battalion size enemy units within 400-500 meters that were trying to get between us and the FOB.)\n\nWe were able to gain some fire superiority with the help of US Army and USMC gunships and some pinpoint bombing from USAF \"fast-movers\" in the area. One USAF pilot stated his ordnance was napalm and cluster bomb units, but that we were too close to the impact area for him to drop it. I told American Beauty Delta that without the support, we would have more serious problems. The air strike came in on target.\n\nI can't estimate the amount of ordnance expended on our behalf that afternoon. It was all considered \"Danger Close\" and that even with all of the helicopter gunship rocket runs, and numerous 250 pound bombs, followed with CBU's, the enemy pressure was still very intense. Not until they dropped the napalm did the close-in enemy fire disappear.\n\nWe were finally able to get two medevac helicopters in. One was a US Army Medevac and the other was one of MACV-SOG's King Bees (H-34), one of the helicopters we had inserted on earlier. SFC Dick Sweezy, the senior medic of A-221, had offered his assistance and came in with the US Army medevac ship. Focused on his own task, he stated that he couldn't understand why we were having such difficulty loading the wounded. The ship crash-landed at the FOB, with over two hundred new bullet holes, the windscreen shot away, and the gallant pilot mortally wounded.\n\n(Ed. Note: SFC Sweezy and the chopper crews also deserve recognition for their great valor in coming into a very hot LZ and staying long enough to take our wounded, dying, and dead out. Their valor was the more exceptional since by SOP they were in no way obligated to land in a hot LZ. They acted as volunteers, at risk of their own lives, to help their comrades.)\n\nI estimate the unit which initiated fire on us was at least a reinforced platoon, and there were much larger units (estimated at two battalions) seen during the fight in the near vicinity.\n\n(Ed. Note: According to reports from personnel observing the action, including the FAC and ground observers at KSCB, the number of enemy engaged was a reinforced company, with battalion-sized elements closing fast.)\n\nSFC Tredinnick was mortally wounded. He was awarded the Silver Star for his actions that day. We lost one Bru KIA and had two Americans WIA and six Bru WIA. Following the final medevac and seeing all survivors were off the hill, we finally moved by foot back to the FOB. We were met about 600 meters from the gate by a rescue unit lead by SFC Robert Cavanaugh. He gave me the word that Tredinnick had died. All of that and we did not accomplish what we set out to do.\"\n\nThe remains were eventually recovered in April 1968 by a Marine unit and a team led by CPT Hammond Salley, which included SF medic Denis Chericone. (See below.)\n\nCasualties from Hatchet Force Denver, Hill 471\n\nCharles Nicholas Tredinnick was born at Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania on 13 December 1934. According to his sister Jean, during his younger days, Chuck had a pet monkey, and played the guitar.\n\nChuck entered the United States Army from Dallas, Pennsylvania, in 1953, at the age of 19. He had originally wanted to enlist in the Marines, but had been turned down. Undeterred, he entered the Army, and eventually became a member of their elite Special Forces.\n\nHe finished basic training and was married to the late Joy Keller in their home town on 3 July 1954, while on leave before going to airborne training. They moved to Fayetteville in November, 1954.\n\nChuck joined the Special Forces after completing Airborne and Ranger training, and was assigned to Germany. After his return from Germany, he and Joy bought a home in Fayetteville. He had served for over 14 years, and was a Senior Combat Engineer when he was assigned to the 5th Special Forces Group for a second tour in Vietnam.\n\nHaving nearly completed his second combat tour, Chuck and his team-mates were scheduled to return to Okinawa for transport to CONUS within hours.\n\nChuck had often written home to his wife, telling her not to worry because “only the good die young.” Two days before the action on Hill 471, he wrote: “Well darling, that’s about it for today. I don’t know when I’ll get the time to write again…. So until then know I love you very much and always will.” It was the last time he would write Joy.\n\nDespite their being so close to leaving, he and his team-mates volunteered to recover the bodies of their comrades and an MIA who had been ambushed earlier on the morning of 29 January 1968 on Hill 471 just outside Khe Sanh Combat Base. A team of American Special Forces soldiers from ODA-221 with a Marine volunteer, and Bru CIDG forces were assembled to accomplish this task. Another man was supposed to go in Chuck's place, but he refused the mission. (This was a prerogative of SOG troops. However, he was subsequently re-assigned to Vietnam later and was killed on that tour.)\n\nHowever, the attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, due to the presence of a much larger enemy force on the hill, estimated at reinforced company, with a battalion maneuvering in to cut off the American force. SFC Tredinnick was killed in action during the ensuing close combat. He died with his face to the enemy.\n\nSFC Tredinnick was awarded the Silver Star for gallantry in action, and the Purple Heart. He had previously received the Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster and the Purple Heart, among other decorations and ribbons, as well as various commendations. He was interred with full military honors in Arlington National Cemetery. He was survived by his wife, Ms. Joy Keller Tredinnick, of Fayetteville, NC, his sister, the late Jean Tredinnick Donnora, who was very close to her brother and had named her son Charles after him (though he predeceased his uncle in 1960 at age 5 in an accident), by his brothers Arthur and Dennis C. Tredinnick, and his cousin, Dennis L. Tredinnick.\n\nJoy never remarried, and remained in their home in Fayetteville until she died on 28 March 2005. She was interred with Chuck in Arlington National Cemetery on 8 April 2005. She is survived by her sister, Ms. Patsy Goodwin, and her friend, Helen Daley, who cared for her in her last days.\n\nChuck is remembered on Panel 35E, Row 63 of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Remembrances can be viewed at the Arlington Cemetery Site, and the Vietnam Veterans' War Memorial site.\n\n(Ed. Note: Due to a clerical error somewhere along the line, SFC Tredinnick' middle name was rendered \"Nichol.\" However, his late wife and sister and other family members informed me that his given name was \"Nicholas\" so I have rendered it as such here.)\n\nLCPL BILLY DALE LIVINGSTON, USMC\n\n9 Apr 1949 - 26 Feb 1968\n\nKilled in non-hostile \"friendly\" fire incident, 26 February 1968\n\n(Photo courtesy of Doc John Roberts, O-2)\n\nBilly Dale Livingston was born on 9 April 1949. He joined the Marines in Alma, Arkansas. His MOS was 0311. He had been in in-country since 15 Aug. 1967. Upon joining CAP, he was assigned to Oscar Co. in January 1967, and was posted to FOB-3 after the initial assaults caused the CAP Marines to be withdrawn from their villes. (See: CAP Oscar History)\n\nI remember him as a nice kid, and he was friendly. One of our Motor Transport Marines, Jimmie J. Tyson, said that Billy had a friendly smile, and a self-deprecating sense of humor.\n\nThe 26th of February was one of the rare nice days at that time of year, with little enemy action or shelling to contend with. Billy had been sharing a bunker with our late comrade, William Allen Breedlove of O-1. (See below and CAP Oscar History).\n\nBreedlove said he was going out, Livingston said “I’m going to stay here.” Breedlove went out behind the bunker wall. Billy must have changed his mind, and started out, just when a US jet came over the base, flying close air support fire missions.\n\nThe enemy were so close at that point that the pilot was making his passes right over our positions, instead of flying across the front of our lines.\n\nI was coming back from an errand on the combat base when I saw the jet coming in, fast and low. When he released his rockets, it was plain that the pilot had fired too soon. I could see that the rockets would hit our lines, so I began running to the bunkers. I knew they'd need help.\n\nA number of guys were hit. Billy had just come out of his bunker, and was killed, likely almost instantly by the blast wave and shrapnel.\n\nWe helped gather his remains.\n\n“Doc” HN John Roberts \"Doc\" Roberts (O-2) said in a telephone interview in August 2005;\n\n\"He was killed by \"friendly\" fire because at the time we were recieving close ground support from aircraft off of the USS Kitty Hawk (CVA 63) who dropped his rockets on us by mistake. The pilot, at the time, was receiving intense machine gun fire from the NVA and they were firing tracers. Billy told me he was planning on getting married as soon as he returned to the states. I wish he had made it.”\n\nBilly lost his life to \"friendly fire\" from a US aircraft, while serving on FOB 3, adjacent to the Khe Sanh Combat Base in Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam. He was just short of his 19th birthday. His rank at time of death was PFC, but he received a posthumous promotion to LCPL (E3).\n\nBilly is buried at Fort Smith National Cemetery, Sebastian Co. Arkansas, Plot: 12, 0, 135. His name is on the Vietnam Memorial Wall on Panel 41E, Row 40. He is also remembered on the Vietnam Veterans' War Memorial site, and on a memorial at the Crawford Co. Courthouse in Arkansas.\n\nDeparted Comrades (Non-Combat)\n\nCraig Albers was born on 22 Aug 1948. He was an aspiring track and field athlete, whose nickname was \"Slats\" (referring to his build). According to a former team-mate from high school;\n\n\"Craig was very friendly, and care-free. He had only friends in high school. I can not remember Craig ever saying a bad thing about anyone.\n\nIn school Craig was a so-so student, preferring to be fun and funny, but he was an excellent athlete. I met him at Freshman Football tryouts in Sept. of 1962. He played End, I played half back.\n\nCraig excelled at basketball. He was our freshman A Squad scoring leader. He was as thin as a rail but could really jump and was an excellent shot and rebounder.\n\nAs good as Craig was in basketball, his real sport (in my opinion) was track. He was an awesome high jumper.\n\nCraig broke his arm our Sophomore year during basketball tryouts and missed that season. He did not turn out his Jr year, and (as I recall) broke his arm again during tryouts our Sr. year. Missing that season\n\nIn our Junior year, Craig fell in with a group of guys that smoked, dressed \"hard\" and drank. Craig adopted their ways, hence he missed out on sports in our Jr. year.\n\nIn our Senior year, Craig dropped out of the group he was in and came back for sports. Unfortunately, as I said, he broke his arm and did not play basketball. I am absolutely certain he would have made the team and been a big contributor had he played. Our team ( I was NOT on the team) placed 2nd in state. With Craig, who knows.\n\nSr. track season saw Craig out working hard and getting better and better. Early in the season, however, Craig was made aware that because of his antics our Jr. year he would not graduate with our class, but would, instead, be required to go to Summer School. I can remember him in the locker room telling all of us that he would not do that, but instead was dropping out to join the Marines.\n\nThe next time I heard of Craig was my Sophomore year in college. I was at the University of Oregon in Eugene. I saw Craig's photo on the front page of the newspaper. He was in his uniform minus two legs and his arm. It was really sad.\n\nA few years later, after college, I ran into Craig in a tavern. He was shooting pool and smoking and drinking like a mad-man. Some years after that, at St. Pius X Catholic Church (we were both Catholics), Fr. Joseph McMahon mentioned at Mass that Craig had passed away. Many of us in the church were very sad to learn the news.\n\nIn short, I remember Craig Albers as a smiling, fresh-faced kid that was fearless. He had no enemies, and was a wonderful friend and teammate. He was a spectacular natural athlete. I am a better person to have met him, the United States Marine Corps is better to have had him in their ranks.\"\n\nOn 14 June 1967, Craig and another CAP Marine were removing mines from the O-3 fields of fire (coordinates XD842408) under orders from the Oscar Company CO (who may in turn have had orders from the Marine command on the combat base), but they didn't have a map of the field. This was an extremely poor decision, and contrary to general practice. The fields should have been cleared by EOD and / or combat engineers with training and detection equipment. The unit NCOIC tried to protest this, but was over-ruled by the CO.\n\nAn explosion occurred which seriously wounded Craig and the other Marine. Craig lost his arm and both legs above the knee, and was med-evaced.\n\n(From my research, I believe the other Marine injured was probably the late Brian W. Oldervik, also of O-3. See below)\n\nAfter a period in the Oak Knoll Naval Hospital, Craig returned to his home town in the vicinity of Beaverton, OR, where the people of the town built him a wheel-chair accessible home in gratitude for his service. Craig became a good pool shooter, despite his disabilities, using a specially made bridge to steady the cue.\n\nWilliam Raymond Corson was born in Chicago on 25th September, 1925. By his own account, He grew up \"a slum kid,\" on the wrong side of Chicago, raised much of the time by grandparents after his parents divorced when he was 2. At 10 he was working a newsstand. At 14, he was touring the country as a migrant worker, picking fruit and learning to gamble.\n\nHe later got a job at The Chicago Daily News. The publisher, Frank Knox, (later Secretary of the Navy), believed Corson had ability, and as a board member of the University of Chicago, helped Corson get a scholarship in math and physics at the age of 15.\n\nCorson left college in 1943 at age 17 to join the service. (Acc. to one biography, he joined the Army, another says the Marines. His theater of service [South Pacific] makes the Marines a strong possibility.) He fought on Guam and Bougainville, rising to the rank of sergeant. After World War II, he returned to school, eventually earning a Master's degree in economics at the University of Miami, and later a doctorate in economics at American University in Washington.\n\nIn 1949 he joined the Marine Corps as an officer. For much of his Marine career, Corson would be an intelligence officer on special assignment with the CIA and the Marine Corps, specializing in Asian affairs, skills which later served him well in his work with Combined Action.\n\nHe served in the Korean War and was a student at the Naval Intelligence School in Washington (1953-55). He began studying Vietnam in the early 1950s during the French attempt to retain its colony. After learning Chinese, Corson became liaison officer in Hong Kong. In 1962, after four years as liaison officer, he was assigned to the Office of the Secretary of Defense. This put him in touch with decision-making at the highest level as U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia deepened. Later he taught a course on communism at the U.S. Naval Academy (1964-66).\n\nIn 1966 Corson was sent to Vietnam where he became commander of a Marine tank battalion. In 1967, he was put in charge of the Combined Action Program. The purpose of this program was to provide security from the communists and win the loyalty of the local people.\n\nAfter the success of the Combined Action Program, Corson, upon his return, was appointed deputy director of the Southeast Asia Intelligence Force in the office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, where he worked closely with the Central Intelligence Agency. However, despite the success of the CAP, he had become convinced that U.S. policies in Vietnam were doomed.\n\nCorson planned to retire in June 1968, and had written a book he planned to publish after retirement called \"The Betrayal\" in which he stated that the Saigon government was corrupt and incompetent and as such was not strongly supported by most ordinary Vietnamese. Unless the United States revised its policies and forced changes on the South vietnamese government, the war would be lost and American servicemen would have died in vain. Publication was set for July 1, 1968, a month after Corson's originally scheduled retirement.\n\nHowever, news of the book had caused a furore in Washington, and in an effort to stop Corson, the Marine Corps invoked a regulation that required officers on active duty to submit statements on public policy to review before making them public. Corson claimed that this did not apply to him because the book would not go on sale until after his retirement.\n\nThe Marine Corps responded by holding up his retirement held up, and taking steps to convene a general court-martial. However, Corson stuck to his guns, and the threatened court-martial was dropped on the grounds that it would only serve to draw attention to the book. Corson's retirement went through a month later than originally scheduled, and the book was published by W. W. Norton.\n\nHis military decorations include the Silver Star Medal and the Navy Commendation Medal with combat \"V\".\n\nOther books by Corson include: \"Promise or Peril; the Black College Student in America\" (1970), \"New KGB: Engine of Soviet Power\" (1985), \"Consequences of Failure\" and \"The Armies of Ignorance: The Rise of the American Intelligence Empire\" (1986).\n\nAfter retirement, Corson taught history at Howard University for a year, and wrote a column on veteran's affairs for Penthouse Magazine, and was it Washington editor. He also worked as an unofficial adviser to Frank Church and the Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities.\n\nIn 1989 Corson co-wrote with Joseph Trento and Susan Trento, Widows: The Explosive Truth Behind 25 Years of Western Intelligence Disasters. The book included an account of the life and death of John Paisley.\n\nI had the pleasure of meeting LCOL Corson several times, and we discussed his experience with the CAP, and his other work and views. He remained convinced that the main premise of The Betrayal was correct.\n\nLCOL Corson died of lung cancer on 17th July, 2000, at Suburban Hospital, Virginia, and buried in Arlington National Cemetery. He was survived by his second wife of 33 years, Judith Ellen Corson, a former Pentagon analyst, who had helped him with the research on The Betrayal and a number of his other books (who later died of melanoma on February 8, 2001, in Potomac, MD), and their three children, Adam, Zachary and Andrew, all of Potomac; and two children from his first marriage to Charlotte Corson, Christopher and David Corson, and five grandchildren.\n\nBorn in Bronx, N.Y., Bill graduated from Bernards High School in Basking Ridge, N.J., and in 1961, graduated magna cum laude from Rutgers University with a bachelor of arts degree in history in 1965. From 1965 to 1969, he served in the Marines, achieving the rank of captain. He received his basic training in Quantico, Va., served two tours of duty in Vietnam, the first with A 1/9 in 1966.\n\nBill became the first CO of Oscar Co. in Feb. 1967, and served until he was replaced by CPT Haines.\n\nBill returned to Quantico in 1968 as an instructor.\n\nOn Jan 11, 1969, Bill married for the first time. Among those in attendance was Anthony Zinni, later to become a general.\n\nDuring his service, Bill received the Navy Commendation Medal w/V, the Purple Heart Medal, Combat Action Ribbon, Presidential Unit Citation, Vietnam Service Medal w/ stars, and the Republic of Vietnam Campaign Medal w/ date bar.\n\nHe later received an MBA degree from Harvard University in 1971.\n\nDivorcing in 1987, Bill later re-married in 1989. He lived in Raleigh, N.C., before moving to Lanesboro, MN about 1991.\n\nHe and his second wife owned Mrs. B's Historic Inn and Restaurant in Lanesboro for 11 years. He retired in 2001.\n\nBill was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, was active in Boy Scouts of America and was pack master of Cub Scout Troop 49 for several years. He had served on the boards of the Minnesota Bed and Breakfast Guild and Lanesboro Business Association. He enjoyed gardening, canoeing, camping and traveling.\n\nBill died of brain cancer on 4 April, 2003 at Seasons Hospice in Rochester, where he had been a patient three months. (His cancer may well have been the result of the heavy Agent Orange exposure we all received at Khe Sanh.)\n\nSurvivors included his wife; two daughters, his son, his mother, and brother. He was preceded in death by an infant son and his father.\n\nThere was a memorial service on April 10, 2003 at Bethlehem Lutheran Church in Lanesboro, with the Rev. Kerry Eversole officiating. Flag presentation was by the Lanesboro American Legion. Interment was in Arlington National Cemetery on 12 May 2003.\n\nHis former brother-in-law from his first marriage wrote and delivered this eulogy, which I share with his kind permission:\n\nBill Sermeus was my friend. We knew each other best from when we were 25 years old until we were 43. At times we played important roles in each other’s lives. We camped together, canoed together and occasionally had a couple of beers together.\n\nThe Bill Sermeus I knew was defined by two main qualities.\n\nFirst, was self-discipline. Anybody who knew Bill knows he had a great track record for making himself do what he should. Self-discipline made him a good Boy Scout; a good student; a good self-employed business man.\n\nPerhaps the ultimate test of his self-discipline was Viet Nam. He told me he did not politicize the war, that his only aim was to keep his Marines alive. At the personal level he told me, “I wanted to stare evil in the eye and see what I could do.” That took self-discipline.\n\nThe second quality that defined Bill was that he was without guile. Bill conducted himself out in the open, in a straightforward manner. There was no façade, no outer layer over the real person. It follows that he was not a slave to fashion or given to trendiness. He didn’t hide his true intentions and his stated intentions were his true intentions. In his business and his personal life he treated others with respect. One way he showed that respect was to say what he really thought, unfiltered, no matter the audience or consequences.\n\nIn my eyes, one of Bill’s most remarkable achievements was the time he got a total stranger to loan us his pickup truck. We were canoeing the St. Croix River. When Bill left our tent one misty morning he discovered that the river had risen and our canoe had floated away. In his remembering of this moment of discovery, Bill always laughed, explaining that at first he couldn’t decide whether to take a leak or dive in and swim after the canoe. In the end, we went to a nearby house and Bill asked the homeowner for his pickup to chase down the canoe. And the man agreed, agreed to loan his truck to two unshaven complete strangers who appeared on his doorstep at around 6 A.M.. I’ll always believe that he did this because Bill Sermeus was simply being Bill Sermeus.\n\nJim Stanton was born in Detroit, Michigan to Edward Hamilton Stanton and Elizabeth D. Stanton. He grew up in Ferndale and Pleasant Ridge, Michigan, and attended Miami University in Oxford, Ohio on a NROTC Scholarship. Taking the Marine Corps option upon graduation in June of 1959, Jim was commissioned a Second Lieutenant in the Marine Corps on June 8, 1959. Five days after his commission, Jim married Elaine (Rasch) Stanton of Highland Park, Michigan, and together they started his thirty year career in the Marine Corps.\n\nUpon completion of The Basic School in Quantico, VA, Jim attended the Artillery Basic Course and the Artillery Officer's Career Course. He held various positions and attended several schools in the Marine Corps.\n\nWhile serving in Vietnam, Jim was acting as an aerial observer and supporting arms coordinator on January 29th, 1968, for ODA-221 during our unsuccessful attempt to recover the dead and missing men from a team that had been ambushed earlier that day on Hill 471 (see above). Known to us at that time only by his call sign \"American Beauty Delta\" (a name which he later told us he did not pick and had hated), he cooly flew overhead during the fight despite enemy fire, directing and coordinating the \"fast-movers\" and other aircraft in laying down heavy supporting fire. In the words of the team leader, H. E. Van Winkle:\n\n\"The Forward Air Controller (FAC) on hand when we inserted had to leave us to refuel. He was replaced by a USMC FAC with the call sign of \"American Beauty Delta\" (Major James Stanton). This gentleman deserves a lot of credit for getting the rest of us off the hill with little further damage. The manner in which he coordinated all of the air support into that one small area without doing us any more damage was nothing short of phenomenal. He was also dealing with two battalion size enemy units that were trying to get between us and the FOB. These were enemy troops spotted moving in the open within 400-500 meters from Hill 471.\"\n\nIt is unlikely that any of us would have survived had it not been for his coolness and accuracy in calling fire. Every man on that hill who survived owes his life to Jim. We did not meet Jim then, but he got in touch over 20 years later after reading an account of the action by MAJ H. E. Van Winkle in an issue of Red Clay, the Khe Sanh Veteran's magazine, and attended some reunions with us.\n\nJim was later the Marine Corps representative to Research and Development at Fort Ord from July of 1979 until his promotion to Colonel in June of 1981, when he assumed the Command of the 23rd Marine Regiment in Alameda, CA. He later served as Chief of Staff at the United States Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center, Twenty Nine Palms, CA.\n\nAmong the decorations Jim earned during his service were the following medals: Legion of Merit, Bronze Star w/Combat \"V\", Purple Heart, Air Medal w/Numeral 10, Humanitarian Service Medal, Marine Corps Expeditionary Medal, National Defense Medal, Vietnam Service Medal w/5 Stars, Joint Service Commendation Medal, Vietnam Commendation Medal, and the Vietnamese Campaign Medal. He also earned a number of ribbons including the: Presidential Unit Citation, Navy Unit Citation, Meritorious Unit Citation, Combat Action Ribbon, Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon, Republic of Vietnam Meritorious Unit Citation (Gallantry Cross) Medal Color w/Palm. Jim also received a number of Letters of Commendation and Appreciation. (Not all Jim's medals and ribbons are illustrated above.)\n\nJim and Elaine returned to North Monterey County upon his retirement from the civilian sector in 1998. Jim was involved with numerous activities, and was a member of All Saints Episcopal Church.\n\nJim passed away on the 6th of November, 2007, following a long battle with a series of illnesses. His memorial service was (appropriately) held on the 10th of November, celebrated by Marines as the \"Marine Corps Birthday\" - the traditional date of the founding of the Continental Marine Corps in 1775 in Tun Tavern (again appropriately!), a Philadelphia pub.\n\nJim was survived by his loving wife of 48 years, Elaine, daughters Susan, Amie and Katie, brother Tom and his wife Marilyn, brother Dave and sister in-law Martha, grandchildren Abigail and Simon, and nieces and nephews. He is missed by his family, and those of us who are fortunate enough to still be here because of his courage and professionalism.\n\nJim's wife, Elaine Fredericka Rasch Stanton (b. Sept. 18, 1937) passed away peacefully in Carmel, CA on September 26th, 2017 aged 80 years. ELaine was raised in Highland Park, MI, where she met Jim in high school, where they were sweethearts. She was a fine woman, lovely, charming, and a great wife (and later care-giver) to Jim. She was also a very successful real estate agent in her own right, and went to work again after Jim contracted his first round of cancer, making a large number of sales that helped pay for his out-of-pocket treatment costs. She will be missed by all who knew her. After Jim's passing in 2007, Elaine moved to Del Mesa Carmel where she was an active member of Del Mesa community serving on the Board of Directors. Elaine is survived by her three daughters, Susan, Amie and her husband Brian, and Kathleen and her husband Steve); her grandchildren, Abigail and Simon; sister-in-law and brother-in-law Marilyn and Thomas Stanton; sister and brother-in-law Martha and Dave Kissinger, nieces and nephews and her many loving friends.\n\nStan was born in Ft. Wayne, IN. to Clarence Dilley and Anna Shiffi Dilley.\n\nHe enlisted in the Marines in 1966, and went to Vietnam in December 1966, serving first as a member of Shore Party, near Da Nang. He then extended his tour 6 months, and upon his return from leave, was posted to Combined Action Company Oscar, 1st Platoon, at Khe Sanh as a CAP Marine working with the Bru tribesmen who served as our native counterparts. He arrived prior to the Siege, and was one of the gallant garrison of Oscar-1 when the NVA attacked in force on 21 January, 1968. Stan and his comrades fought the greatly numerically superior enemy force, and beat them in detail.\n\n(See CAC Oscar History - \"Big Tet\" and Bruce Clarke's \"Expendable Warriors\" for more on the battle for Khe Sanh ville.)\n\nAfter Stan left Khe Sanh following the Siege, he was placed in charge of a CAP near Hue. He later served at Que Lai (sp.?) in a unit he called \"Rat Hole 6.\"\n\nStan left the Marines in 1969 and went to work at Slater Steel in Fort Wayne, remaining there for 38 years, and later he went to work for Pena’s Plumbing and Heating in Ossian, IN for 5 years.\n\nOne of his steel mill co-workers, Mr. Todd Radke (who put us in contact with Stan) sent me the following statement about for Stan:\n\n\"I spent a lot of time with Stan when we worked in the rolling mill at Slater Steels in Fort Wayne, In. We were having a lot of quality issues with the mill, and Stan took it upon himself to temporarily give up a pud job in the Roughing Mill Pulpit, and he came to the set-up area to work with my crew. He organized all the components (mostly from memory), ordered the missing pieces, and began to teach me the \"art\" of rolling mill set-up.\n\nWeek's end saw vast improvements, within a month the mill was running as if new. Stan stayed with us until he was confident in my ability. Soon after, our shift (11-7) set a record; 28 days of production without a single billet scrapped.\n\nStan is a natural leader, and a team player, I enjoyed the time I spent with him. It was during a period of down-time that he told me of his Viet Nam experiences. I never imagined that one day a casual E-mail to Bob (Hall, formerly of Radio Relay at O-1) might reunite Stan and his Warrior Brethren.\"\n\n(We are grateful to Todd and Bob for that E-mail, despite the reunion being all too brief.)\n\nStan married his wife of 34 years, Cheryl Hill on Aug. 1, 1977, in Reno, NV.\n\nHe was a member of American Legion Post 111 in Bluffton, IN, and was also an avid Harley Davidson motorcylist.\n\nStan had been battling cancer when he died on Saturday, at the Bluffton Regional Medical Center.\n\nHe is survived by his wife Cheryl, his two brothers and sisters-in-law, Lee & Patty Dilley of Churubusco and Tony & Patty Dilley of Whiteland, and four sisters and brothers-in-law, Roseanna & Scott Uhl of Avilla, Joellen & Ray Solga of Alabama, Kathy & Tim Wenning of Fort Wayne, and Larene & Ron Pulver of Leo.\n\nHe was preceded in death by his parents and by a daughter, Erika Smith, in 1995.Services were held at 10 AM on Saturday November 26th, 2011 at the at the Thomas / Rich, Chaney and Lemler Funeral Home with Larry Sprinkle officiating.\n\nBurial was at the Fairview Cemetery in Bluffton. Graveside military honors were conducted by members of American Legion Post 111 and a U.S. Marine Corps Honor Guard.\n\nLarry (aka \"Boz\") was assigned early in 1967 to Oscar Company at Khe Sanh as part of the \"Plank Crew.\" He proceeded to help establish Oscar Co., and was the squad leader of two of its CAPs, serving as NCOIC of O-3 until Oct. 1967.\n\nOn 27 June, 1967, Oscar Company was ordered by the Marine command at Khe Sanh to send a patrol to investigate suspected rocket and mortar launch sites spotted earlier by an aerial observer that were believed to be the origin of an NVA rocket and mortar attack on the Khe Sanh base which had occurred just after midnight of the night before. This patrol resulted in the ambush of our patrol on Hill 689 and the deaths of most of the patrol. (See CAC Oscar History)\n\nLarry was a good NCO who cared a great deal for his men's welfare. He told me in various Es and phone conversations that he greatly regretted sending that patrol out, as he knew it was a mistake at the time, as they all knew the area was \"hot\" and that the CAP unit was not big enough or well enough supported to make a combat patrol of that type, which was better suited to an infantry company. However, while LT Sermeus agreed, he was also under orders.\n\nLarry was further troubled by the fact that if he had not injured his leg shortly before, he would have been leading the patrol himself. His feelings about this remained strong. Speaking of this event, Larry wrote to me and Frank Mazariego's sister in an E dtd. January 26, 2006:\n\n\"Ever since I departed Viet Nam, I have tremendous guilt feelings about the day Frank and three other Marines were killed. It has haunted me all of my life. Most of the events I do not remember because it is just too painful to remember. I am so sorry about Frank.\n\nI always thought I wrote the the parents of each Marine who was killed that day but I may not have. I really cannot remember exactly. I was somewhat relieved when I made a trip to Wisconsin on a Memorial Day weekend a few years ago to visit the family of CPL James Shepard. His town held a memorial service for Jimmy and some Marines who knew him came to ths service. His mother showed me the letter I wrote when her son was killed the same day as Frank. Unfortunately, it had taken me a long time to even write that letter.\n\nFrank was a good Marine. We all became very close to one another in those days. I could always count on Frank and he helped me become a better Marine and person. I too miss Frank and the other fine Marines who gave their all.\"\n\nLarry left in October, 1967, prior to the Tet assault on the village and the Siege.\n\nLike many of us, Larry also cared a great deal about the native population we were there to serve and protect. He often expressed a great fondness for the Bru and other native people of the region.\n\nSteve was the son of Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Biddle of Anderson, IN, and resided most of his life in Anderson and Pendleton, IN. He enlisted in the Marines in August, 1966, graduating after 8 weeks basic training from the Marine Corps Recruit Depot at San Diego, CA, and then underwent four more weeks of ICT and a further four weeks of basic specialist training at MCB Camp Pendleton, CA, becoming an 0351 specializing in the 3.5\" rocket launcher (a descendant of the famed \"bazooka\" of WW II). Steve told his sons in 2014 that he only fired the 3.5\" rocket launcher once - a smoke projectile used to mark a sniper's position. This may have been partially due to the fact that until the attack on Lang Vei during Tet 1968, the PAVN had not deployed armor against our troops, knowing that they would be out-classed and out-gunned by our tanks, our air support, and devices like the 3.5\" rocket launcher and a newer device, the M-72 LAW (Light Anti-tank Weapon, aka LAAW and LAWS) a 66 MM unguided rocket system, meant to be a one-shot disposable weapon that was superseding the 3.5\" rocket launcher.\n\nArriving in Vietnam, he was first assigned to 1st Plt., E 2/26, and was stationed near Da Nang on Hill 222. He fought in the heavy and often hellacious fighting at the DMZ during May 1967, on Operation Prairie and other hard-fought campaigns. He was later stationed at Camp Evans, which was located at Co Bi Than Tan (near Phu Bai), near the northern end of the infamous A Shau Valley (aka \"The Valley of Death\"). While there, he and some friends volunteered for Combined Action, arriving at CAC Oscar in July 1967, where he was assigned to O-2.\n\nAt O-2, Steve participated in patrols, ambushes, and other operations as well as helping to train our native counterparts, guard the local people, and assist in civic action work.\n\nSteve was one of the defenders of O-2 during the heavy assaults on 21 January 1968 (See CAC Oscar History), and was later on FOB 3 during the early days of the Siege. He was supposed to fly out on his birthday (Feb 5) but according to what he told his sons, the plane that would take him out was either hit or crashed on landing (which happened several times during the Siege, until they stopped landing aircraft), so he left a little later.\n\nIn March 1968 he was sent stateside to Camp Lejeune where he embarked on the Med Cruise with 3/8 from Apr-Sept on the USS Cambria APA-36. After the cruise he remained in 3/8 until he was transferred to his last station, Marine Barracks, NSB Bangor, WA. Steve was released from active duty in Sep. 1969. After discharge, he returned to IN.\n\nHe then worked in machine repair, maintenance and upkeep at Owens Illinois Brockway Glass company in Lapel, IN from 1969 until retiring in 2008, after 38 years of service.\n\nSteve was a member of the Pendleton Kiwanis Club and Pendleton American Legion.\n\nHe is survived by his 2 sons, Nathan K. Biddle of Pendleton, IN and Seth E. Biddle & daughter-in-law Heather Biddle of Newton, KS; his daughter, Chandra R & son-in-law Mike Seybert of McCordsville, IN; his brother, Roger Biddle of Knightstown, IN, 3 grandchildren, Natalie, Hunter, and Wyatt; and several nieces, nephews, and cousins.\n\nSteve was preceded in death by mother, Rachel (Jones) Biddle, father, Kenneth Biddle, brothers John and Doug Biddle; and his grandson Steven William Biddle.\n\nServices were held Monday, June 22, 2015, 6:00 pm at Robert D. Loose Funeral Homes & Crematory, Anderson, IN, with Pastor Larry Bingham officiating.\n\nA military ceremony will be conducted by the V.F.W. Post 266 Honor Guard and the U.S. Marine Corp at the funeral home following the service, followed by cremation and interment in the National Cemetery in Marion, IN.\n\nMemorial contributions may be made to the American Diabetes Association. Tributes can be left on his obituary site at the Loose Funeral Homes website.\n\nThose of us who knew Steve in Vietnam remember him as a good man and a good Marine, dependable, reliable, capable and steady. He will be missed by all who knew him.\n\nBorn to loving parents Gerard and Rose (Brun) Maranda in Grand Digue, New Brunswick, Canada, Armand was one of thirteen children and cherished every moment of growing up with a large family.\n\nAs a young man with an adventurous spirit and love for his adopted country, he enlisted in the Marines to go to Vietnam, where he served in Combined Action Company Oscar, 3rd platoon as the NCOIC. Armand was a bold an fearless Marine that everyone trusted, respected, and looked up to. He received several medals, ribbons and badges including: the Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Medal, Vietnam Service Medal, and the Vietnamese Campaign Medal, as well as the following ribbons without accompanying medals (in order of precedence): Combat Action, Presidential Unit Citation, Navy Unit Commendation, Vietnamese Cross of Gallantry (Unit Level w/ frame and palm, and the Vietnamese Civic Action Ribbon (Unit Level w/ frame and palm).\n\nArmand started his civilian career in construction in Waltham, Mass. and ended as general manager for a large international engineering and construction company. He managed multimillion dollar projects including hospitals, wastewater treatment plants, nuclear plants and oil refineries which took him from the U.S to Africa, Wales, France and Canada. In retirement his life-long love of music led him to become a certified luthier and that became his passion. He loved working in his shop in Las Vegas making guitars and fiddles.\n\nArmand enjoyed playing in several bands in and around Waltham, MA when he lived in that region. His main focus at the cottage he and his wife had in Nova Scotia was the “party room” where he enjoyed many parties with friends and family. He played the guitar, the fiddle, the steel guitar, and many other instruments. Other than traveling, his favorite pastime was to have jam session parties where he and the band could play music and dance with family and friends to the wee hours of the morning. He appreciated everybody’s talent and his greatest joy was to be part of the band!\n\nArmand also enjoyed card games. He treasured the many nights playing 200 and Tarabish with family and friends in Cape Breton. Poker was certainly high on the list. The many poker tournaments we played in California and Missouri with family and friends was the highlight of the visits!\n\nArmand was a hero to his family and friends, someone we all looked up to. He was loved and respected by everyone who knew him. Always there when you needed him and always trying to make you laugh, even when you wanted to cry. He was strong, yet gentle with those he loved.\n\nHis wife and family describe Armand as an amazing, loving and supportive husband, father, and grandfather. Those of us who were privileged to serve with and know him remember him as a tough, competent, NCO who took care of his men and performed the missions assigned to him. I know I speak for all his comrades when I say he was respected by all of us.\n\nArmand was preceded in death by Corine Sheppard, Donald Maranda, Mary Maranda, step-siblings Clara, Aline, Maria and Ivon.\n\nAmong those left to cherish Armand’s memory are his loving wife of 51 years Lucille, his daughters Sheila Holm (husband Stacey) of California and Pamela Monday (husband Jason) of Missouri, his grandchildren; Madison, Delaney and Zakk, and “bonus grandchildren”; Paige, Nina and Jaden, by his siblings; Claudette Goguen of New Brunswick, Canada, Leon Maranda of New Brunswick, Canada, John Paul Maranda of Mass., Jeanette Maranda of New Brunswick, Canada, Diane Sullivan of NH, and Doris Coraccio of Mass., and a host of nieces, nephews, close relatives and friends, and his long-time comrade-in-arms from Oscar Co. and by his life-long friend, John Balanco and his wife, Toni, as well as by all his comrades from Oscar Co.\n\nArmand went far too soon, and we will all miss him more than words can express, but the memory of his laughter and his smiling face will brighten our days.\n\nA memorial service was held on September 10, 2021, at 1 PM at Kraft Sussman Funeral Services, 3975 S. Durango Drive, Ste 105, Las Vegas, Nevada 89147.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, the Maranda family requested donations be made to any of the charities below, that were important to Armand.\n\nwww.woundedwarriorproject.org\n\nwww.ptsdusa.org\n\nwww.foldsofhonor.org\n\nwww.t2t.org\n\nJerry was born August 3rd, 1946, in Knoxville, Tennessee to parents, Dewey and Mary King French.\n\nJerry lived a full life, enlisting in the United States Marine Corps at the age of 17 and deploying to Vietnam to serve as part of the Combined Action Company program, a Civil Affairs program dedicated to winning the hearts and minds of the Vietnamese people.\n\nJerry was a key member of the garrison in Combined Action Company Oscar, 2nd platoon, during the assaults on his unit which took place at the beginning of the Siege of Khe Sahn in January 1968. Jerry’s courage durning the fighting was outstanding. While manning an M-60 machine gun, Jerry laid down heavy suppressive fire against the enemy. Jerry told me in a telephone conversation that he had bent over during a break in the fighting to pick up his cigarette lighter, which he had dropped, when a short round from the base hit the bunker and tore the M-60 to pieces, literally burying him alive w/ dirt.\n\n\"I was addled from the concussion\" he said. 'Doc' Sargent and some others dug me out. After we were evacuated, I took that damned machine gun to Phu Bai. I thought they might give me another one.\"\n\nWhen his comrades dug him out, he quickly obtained a Browning Automatic Rifle and again began delivering a steady and accurate stream of fire.\n\n\"Doc\" Roberts said of him that \"He was one of the bravest men I have ever seen.\" Jerry once told me that he had been \"so scared I was glued to the trigger!\" While this may have been true, what he dids requires real courage - rising above one's fears to do the job that needs to be done. In my opinion, Jerry should have received a decoration for valor for his actions, but such are the fortunes of war.\n\nIn my experience, Jerry was a brave and reliable Marine who knew his trade. He was a man of few words, but worth listening to, and his deeds spoke volumes.\n\nAfter Vietnam, Jerry was stationed at MCB Camp Lejeune, where he met and married the love of his life, Betty Carole Reaves. They were married for over 52 years.\n\nAfter leaving the service, Jerry became an entrepreneur and created Polywood, an architectural millwork business starting out in a small shop behind the house. Polywood became regionally known for beautiful arches and columns and expanded into a large facility in Walstonburg.\n\nIn retirement, he took up various hobbies including wine making, bees, and raising various farm animals including ducks, geese, and cows. He also enjoyed fishing and netting at his river house in Kennel’s Beach.\n\nJerry passed away on Sunday, September 26, 2021. In addition to his parents, he was preceded in death by his son, Jerry L. French Jr. (Jay) and his sisters, Ella, Jenny and Betty.\n\nHe is survived by his wife, Betty Carole; sons, Connor Brown, of Chapel Hill, and Jayden Brown, of the home; daughter, Lisa French, of Ayden; grandchildren, Josh Gurganus and wife, Brittany, and Ashley Williams and husband, Chris; great grandchildren, Tristan, Evelyn and Waylon, and Leon and Levi; brothers, George, of Texas, and David, of Kentucky; sisters, Vickie and Diane White and their husbands, and many nieces and nephews, and by his comrades of Oscar company.\n\nThe funeral service was held on Thursday, September 30, 2021, at 2 pm at Elm Grove Church by his pastor Dr. Frankie Baggett. Burial with military honors followed in the Reaves Cemetery, Ayden, NC\n\nJohn Ray Roberts, Sr., was born August 14, 1943 in Freeport, TX to Morris and Mary Bryan Roberts.\n\nIn 1962, he married Ms. Linda Darlene Bowsher in Amarillo.\n\nIn 1964, John enlisted in the US Navy, graduating with the rank of E3 and was assigned to Balboa Naval Hospital's Hospital Corpsman Training Command. He graduated and was assigned to Fleet Marine Force Field Medical School to learn Marine Corps Infantry tactics. Upon graduation, John served for six years as a medical corpsman with the Marines, being ordered first to Marine Corps Base, 29 Palms, Ca Base Hospital for Pharmacy Assistant Training and served as the Assistant Pharmacist for 7 months.\n\nOrdered to South Vietnam, 3rd MAF, 3rd Marine Division as a platoon Hospital Corpsman to the newly formed Civil Action Platoon program (later re-designated as Combined Action Companies), and was later assigned to Combined Action Company Oscar, 2nd Platoon, I Corps, Khe Sanh, South Vietnam.\n\nAs part of Combined Action, John would go into the villages and help the local people with wound care, injuries, and illness. His duties included helping to deliver babies using sterile methods and modern medicines. His military role did not deter him from demonstrating his love of mankind and humanity to his Marines as well as to the native men, women, and children of Vietnam.\n\nJohn was then assigned to USS Kitty Hawk (CVA-63) in the Gulf of Tonkin, Vietnam and served out his enlistment.\n\nJohn often said he was most proud of his service with us in Combined Action Company Oscar (2nd Platoon) before and during the Siege of Khe Sanh.\n\nJohn later received a Bachelor’s degree from West Texas State University and became a Marine Reserve officer, and later received a Master’s degree from Pepperdine University,\n\nIn civilian life, he was a registered investment advisor and financial adviser.\n\nJohn passed away on Monday, July 18, 2022.\n\nJohn was a devoted father and grandfather who loved his family very much. He was preceded in death by his grandson, Jonathan Roberts, his brother, David Roberts, and his parents. Survivors include his wife of 60 years, Linda Roberts; daughter, Karen Brentlinger; son, John Roberts, Jr. and wife, Kristen; grandchildren, Jamie Cantwell and husband, Colin, Jessica Pham and husband, David, Jennifer Jones and husband, Morgan, Mikaela Brentlinger, Brayden Brentlinger, Josh Roberts and wife, Hannah, and Haley Roberts and fiancé Aaron Sunday; three great grandchildren, Rebekah, Luca, and Thomas; one great granddaughter on the way, Emily; and his step-father, H.A.

Craig attended Columbia Basin College on a football scholarship and helped take the team to the Junior Rose Bowl in Pasadena that fall.\n\nCraig met the love of his life, Patty Bucklin in 1963. When Patty spotted him across the room at \"The Social Club\" she apparently liked what she saw, and went over and sat on his lap. The happy couple celebrated 58 years of bliss on August 1, 2022. Craig and Patty were blessed with two children, Shane and Stephane, seven grandchildren, and his Cocker Spaniel Moses, all of whom he adored.\n\nIn 1965, Craig enlisted in the US Army, and became a Green Beret in the Special Forces.

(See the story of this mission here: https://sites.google.com/site/usmccaposcar/cap-oscar/the-siege - The Siege. Oscar Co. Patrols with and for the Special Forces.) Craig's time spent in Vietnam undoubtedly had a profound effect on him later in life. While in the Special Forces, he became a certified Airborne Jump Master in 1968 and Scuba Diver/Instructor in 1973.\n\nDuring the one gunfight we were in together, he sought well and bravely, and I am proud to have known and served with him and his comrades, albeit briefly, on that fateful day.\n\nCraig graduated from the Army’s Officers Candidate School in 1975, ranking #11 out of 112 officer students, placing him in the top ten percent of his class, and he became a Commissioned Officer in the United States Army. He subsequently earned a Bachelors of Science in Criminal Justice in 1979. Craig's distinguished military career took him all over the world and Craig received numerous meritorious honors, commendations and awards. Craig retired from the Army in 1988, but his tenacity, attention to detail, and ability to lead allowed Craig to excel in any endeavor he embarked on.\n\nCraig later worked for Dresser Industries in Texas, and Hanford Patrol and Emergency Preparedness, from which he retired. Craig earned several certificates and awards while employed for Hanford.\n\nCraig was a Christian, attending Calvary Chapel Tri-Cities for the last 17 years. In retirement, Craig spent many hours reading his bible, watching the History Channel and working on his 1941 Ford Business Coupe.

MacLeod from Auchtermuchty, a member of the Scottish Tartans Society, he designed the USMC \"Leatherneck\" tartan, which is available for all Marines, families and friends. While HQMC has so far declined to recognize it officially (write your representative!), it is the official tartan of Clan Leatherneck, a Marine organization that began with the Marine Detachment in Holy Loch, Scotland in the 1950s. It is a very handsome design, and incorporates all the traditional Marine colors - Green, Blue, Scarlet and Gold. (See: https://www.tartanregister.gov.uk/tartanDetails?ref=4187 )\n\nFrom July, 2017 to July, 2021, he worked PT for the VA, interviewing 450 vets and writing their life stories, and from 2022 to 2023 he taught chess to young people after school.\n\nFrom November, 2023 until shortly before his death, he served as a substitute teacher in Madison, Sun Prairie, Cottage Grove and Fitchburg school districts, Dane County.\n\nHall is survived by his beloved wife, Bonnie Beinart Hall (who he met while teaching Scottish Country Dance); stepchildren, Julie Cruz and Dale Boehm; his granddaughter, Britnye R.
