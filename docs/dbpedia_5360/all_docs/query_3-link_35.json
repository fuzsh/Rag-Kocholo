He was also known for voicing Archie in The Land Before Time franchise.\n\nHis Disney roles included Doc Hopper in The Muppet Movie, Chief Brandon in Dick Tracy, Deke Yablonski in Tough Guys, Det. Lt. Bobby Mallory in V.I. Warshawski, and the Director in Spy Hard. He also made a brief appearance in the 1979 special The Muppets Go Hollywood, aired as a promotion for The Muppet Movie.
