        "text": "This week on «Film Friday,» I have decided to celebrate both Gene Kelly's 104th and Van Johnson's 100th birthdays by telling you about one of the only two pictures they made together. Incidentally, this was the first Van Johnson film I ever saw.\n\nDirected by Vincente Minnelli, Brigadoon (1954) begins when New Yorkers Tommy Albright (Gene Kelly) and Jeff Douglas (Van Johnson) become lost in the highlands of Scotland while on a hunting trip. Upon the clearing of the mists, they discover Brigadoon, a village that only materializes once every century for only a day. If any villager ever leaves, the enchantment will be broken for all and the whole town will vanish forever. If, in contrast, an outsider wishes to stay, then they must prove to love someone in the village strongly enough. Cynic Jeff finds himself increasingly bored with the town's peculiarities, while dreamer Tommy falls in love with both Brigadoon and village lass Fiona Campbell (Cyd Charisse), whose younger sister Jean (Virginia Bosler) is about to marry Charlie Dalrymple (Jimmy Thompson).\n\nGene Kelly, Cyd Charisse, Van Johnson and Barry Jones in Brigadoon.\n\nThat evening, Mr. Lundie (Barry Jones), the village schoolmaster, officiates at Jean and Charlie's wedding, which Tommy and Fiona attend. Interrupting the festivities, the jealous Harry Beaton (Hugh Laing) announces that he is leaving Brigadoon to make everything disappear, since the girl he loves, Jean, is marrying another man. Harry's words create mass chaos among the townspeople, who all rush to stop him. Harry fights off his pursuers, including Tommy, but while hiding in a tree, he is accidentally shot to death by Jeff, who skipped the wedding to hunt. Afterwards, Tommy and Fiona confess their love to each other and decide to marry, thus allowing him to stay in Brigadoon. When Tommy tells his plan to his friend, however, a drunk and remorseful Jeff admits that he killed Harry. Shaken by Jeff's words, Tommy apologetically changes his mind and bids Fiona farewell just before Brigadoon disappears.\n\nFour months later, in a New York bar, Tommy tells Jeff that he is still in love with Fiona and had been avoiding his fiancé, Jane Ashton (Elaine Stewart). At dinner that evening, Tommy abruptly calls off his engagement and calls Jeff, instructing him to get the first flight back to Scotland. He and Jeff return to same place where Brigadoon once stood and suddenly see the village reappearing. As Tommy finally reunites with Fiona, Brigadoon fades back into the mist.\n\nMr. Lundie: It's the hardest thing in the world to give everything. Though it's usually the only way to get everything.\n\nLyricist and book writer Alan Jay Lerner first met Austrian composer Frederick Loewe in 1942 at the Lamb's Club, a theatrical organization based in New York City. Since Loewe was looking for a partner, he and Lerner soon collaborated on a musical adaptation of Barry Conners's farce The Patsy called The Life of the Party for a Detroit stock company. Although the show ran for only nine weeks, Lerner and Loewe decided to continue acting as a team for the foreseeable future.\n\nBack in New York, the duo got to work on What's Up? with Arthur Pierson, who co-wrote the musical with Lerner. Opening at the National Theatre on Broadway in November 1943, What's Up? received negative reviews from critics and closed after 63 performances. Undeterred by a second disappointment, Lerner and Loewe set about writing their next piece, The Day Before Spring, which debuted at the National Theatre in 1945. In spite of the mixed reception, the show ran for 165 performances and finally brought Lerner and Loewe some attention.\n\nComposer Frederick Loewe and lyricist Alan Jay Lerner.\n\nInspired by Rodgers and Hammerstein's successful collaborations Oklahoma! (1943) and Carousel (1945), Lerner and Loewe next created Brigadoon, a romantic fantasy set in a mystical village in the Scottish Highlands. Directed by Robert Lewis, Brigadoon opened at Ziegfeld Theatre on Broadway in March 1947 to excellent critical reviews. Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times called it a «beautiful orchestrated Scotch idyll,» while Ward Morehouse of the New York Sun declared it to be «by far the best musical play this season has produced.» The production, which ran for 581 performances, starred David Brooks as Tommy Albright, George Keane as Jeff Douglas, Marion Bell as Fiona MacLaren, Virginia Bosler as her sister Jean, James Mitchell as Harry Beaton and William Hansen as Mr. Lundie. A West End production of Brigadoon premiered at Her Majesty's Theatre in London in April 1949 and lasted 685 performances. It featured Philip Hanna as Tommy and Patricia Hughes as Fiona.\n\nScenes from the original Broadway production of Brigadoon.\n\nIn February 1951, British producer J. Arthur Rank acquired the rights to Brigadoon, but sold them a month later to MGM's Arthur Freed, who «paid a fortune» for the property. Soon, the studio announced that Gene Kelly and Kathryn Grayson, the stars of Thousands Cheer (1943) and Anchors Aweigh (1945), would play the lead roles of Tommy and Fiona in the film version of Brigadoon. However, Kelly's other commitments stalled the production for almost two years, by which point the studio's contract with Grayson had lapsed.\n\nMGM then decided to cast Moira Shearer, who had come to international attention for her first screen role as a ballerina in the British film The Red Shoes (1948). Whereas Grayson hailed from North Carolina, Shearer was an authentic Scottish lass and thus perfect for the part. But, as fate would have it, Sadlers Wells Ballet, of which Shearer was a member, refused to release her for the length of the picture's shooting schedule. Having lost Shearer as their ideal Fiona, Metro finally settled on contract player and Freed Unit favourite Cyd Charisse, who had risen to fame as Kelly's sexy dancing partner in Singin' in the Rain (1951).\n\nGene Kelly and Cyd Charisse as Tommy and Fiona in Brigadoon.\n\nFor the role of Jeff Douglas, the protagonist's best friend, MGM initially considered British actor Alec Guinness and Singin' in the Rain co-star Donald O'Connor, but eventually assigned the role to Van Johnson, who had appeared with Kelly in the propaganda war film Pilot #5 (1943).\n\nKnown as MGM's «Golden Boy,» Johnson began his show business career in 1935, singing and dancing in an off-Broadway production called Entre Nous. The following year, noted producer Leonard Sillman cast him in New Faces of 1936, which was a huge hit among audiences and critics alike. That led to small featured parts in Rodgers and Hart's Too Many Girls (1939) and Pal Joey (1940), wherein he also served as Kelly's understudy. In 1942, Johnson signed a long-term contract with MGM and became one of the studio's most popular leading men during and right after World War II, appearing in such successful pictures as Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo (1944), and Battleground (1949). Brigadoon ended up being Johnson's penultimate film for MGM; he was dropped from his contract following the release of The Last Time I Saw Paris (1954).\n\nGene Kelly and Van Johnson as Tommy and Jeff in Brigadoon.\n\nTo helm Brigadoon, the studio selected Vincente Minnelli, who had previously worked with Kelly in The Pirate (1948) and the Best Picture winner An American in Paris (1951). The son of a musical conductor, Minnelli started out as a costume and set designer at the Chicago Theatre, before transitioning to stage director at Radio City Musical Hall in New York. The first play he directed was the hit musical revue At Home Abroad, which opened in October 1935 and featured future Hollywood stars Eleanor Powell and John Payne. Minnelli continued to enjoy great success on Broadway until Freed brought him to MGM in 1940. His other credits include Meet Me in St. Louis (1944), Father of the Bride (1950) and The Band Wagon (1953), the latter of which gave Charisse her first leading role. Lerner described Minnelli as «the greatest director of motion picture musicals the screen has ever seen.»\n\nVincente Minnelli, Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse during the making of Brigadoon.\n\nKelly and Minnelli originally planned to shoot Brigadoon on location in Scotland, where the story is set. However, the country's unpredictable climate and the high cost of overseas production made this unfeasible. According to Kelly, he and Freed actually travelled to Scotland to scout locations, but found that «the weather was so bad that we had to agree with the studio. So we came back to the United States and started looking for locations here. We found some highlands above Monterey [in Northern California's Big Sur] that looked like Scotland. But then the studio had an economy wave, and they clamped the lid on that idea.»\n\nTo the disappointment of the cast and crew — and the delight of newly-appointed studio head Dore Schary, who disliked musicals and always pushed for films to be produced on a low budget — Brigadoon was filmed on the soundstages at the MGM facilities in Culver City. Art director Preston Ames, who had won an Oscar for An American in Paris, devised a way to build the village of Brigadoon, as well as the surrounding heathered hills, on a single, gigantic stage, in order to allow the camera to move through it more easily and shoot in a full 360-degree angle.\n\nThe ensemble cast of Brigadoon. The entire village was built on a soundstage.\n\nPrincipal photography on Brigadoon took place between early December 1953 and late March 1954. From the beginning, Minnelli and Kelly disagreed on how the film should be shot. «Vincente and I were never in sync, I must confess,» Kelly admitted. Minnelli envisioned the film as «'more of an operetta' — the type of 'theatrical artifice' that was less like An American in Paris and more like The Pirate.» Kelly, however, saw Brigadoon as a «'Scottish Western' — Arthur Freed meets John Ford.» When the entire production veered more in Minnelli's direction, Kelly was not shy about voicing his unhappiness. Minnelli later said that he «had many talks with [Kelly], trying to impress on him the need to show exuberance in the part.» Nevertheless, Kelly remained remote and grim-looking throughout filming.\n\nAdding to the already palpable tension on the set was the fact that once the performers finally managed to produce whatever effect their exacting, non-verbal director was looking for, they were obliged to do it all over again. As Johnson recalled,\n\n«They were going from Widescreen to CinemaScope, so when we got a take, Vincent would say, 'Now we're going to do one for CinemaScope.' So I watched him. It took another 45 minutes to put his big camera on and relight and widen the thing. So, finally, I said, 'I'm shooting two pictures!' I went to see Dore Schary and I said, 'I'm shooting two movies. I should have two salaries,' but Dore said, 'Yes, you're shooting two versions. That's right. And you're getting one salary, Van, and be glad that you're getting it,' and I walked out very meekly. I never did that again.»\n\nCyd Charisse, Gene Kelly and Van Johnson during the making of Brigadoon.\n\nBrigadoon premiered on September 8, 1954 and was moderately successful at the box-office. Critical reviews, however, were not as favorable, with many complaining about the film's stagy quality. Bosley Crowther of The New York Times, for instance, described the film as «curiously flat and out-of-joint, rambling all over creation and seldom generating warmth or charm.» Crowther admired the costumes, sets and decor, but deplored the omission of several musical numbers. He also found fault with the film's two stars and its director: «the personable Gene Kelly and Cyd Charisse have the lead dancing roles. Even so, their several individual numbers are done too slickly, too mechanistically. What should be wistful and lyric smack strongly of trickery and style [...] Mr. Kelly's [performance] is as thin and metallic as a nail; Miss Charisse's is solemn and posey [...] Vincente Minnelli's direction lacks his usual vitality and flow.» He concluded his review by noting that the film was «pretty weak synthetic Scotch.»\n\nOriginal theatrical release posters for Brigadoon.\n\nIf my memory serves me right, Brigadoon was one of the first classic films I ever saw. At that point, I was still very much obsessed with Gene Kelly and tried to watch as many of his films as I could possibly find. When I read the plot synopsis of Brigadoon, I thought it sounded really interesting — a kind of story I never really seen before. As I started watching it, however, I was immediately put off by the blatant artificiality of the settings and ended up not enjoying the film as much as I thought I would. I truly wish the film had been shot on location in Scotland or at least in Big Sur, as Kelly suggested. In my opinion, real «live» surroundings would made Brigadoon an excellent film instead of just an okay one. Brigadoon was also the first Van Johnson picture I ever saw, although I barely noticed him at the time. It was only several months later when I watched Thrill of a Romance (1945) and Easy to Wed (1946) that I realized that Esther Williams's adorable leading man and Gene Kelly's sardonic sidekick were the same person. At that point, I went back and re-watched Van's scenes in Brigadoon and that made me like the film a little bit more. My favourite sequence is definitely «I'll Go Home With Bonnie Jean,» which he performs with Gene. Van was actually a really good dancer and it is a shame that MGM did not give him more opportunities to showcase his dancing skills.\n\n_______________________________________\n\nSOURCES:\n\nA Hundred or More Hidden Things: The Life and Films of Vincente Minnelli by Mark Griffin (Da Capo Press, 2010)\n\nVincente Minnelli: Hollywood's Dark Dreamer by Emanuel Levy (St. Martin's Press, 2009)\n\nLabels\n\nIt was April 1948 when director King Vidor spotted 22-year-old Patricia Neal on the Warner Bros. studio lot. A drama graduate from Northwestern University, she had just arrived in Hollywood following a Tony Award-winning performance in Lillian Hellman's Another Part of the Forest . Impressed by Patricia's looks, Vidor approached the young actress and asked if she would be interested in doing a screen test for the female lead in his newest film, The Fountainhead (1949). Gary Cooper had already signed as the male protagonist, and the studio was then considering Lauren Bacall and Barbara Stanwyck to play his love interest. Neal liked the script and about two months later, she met with the director for sound and photographic tests. Vidor was enthusiastic about Patricia, but her first audition was a complete disaster. Cooper was apparently watching her from off the set and he was so unimpressed by her performance that he commented, « What's that!? » He tried to con\n\nIn the mid- and late 1930s, screwball comedy was in vogue and practically every actress in Hollywood tried her hand at it. Barbara Stanwyck never considered herself a naturally funny person or a comedienne per se , but after delivering a heart-wrenching performance in King Vidor's Stella Dallas (1937), she decided she needed a « vacation » from emotional dramas. In her search for a role, she stumbled upon a « champagne comedy » called The Mad Miss Manton (1938), originally intended as a Katharine Hepburn vehicle. Barbara Stanwyck and Henry Fonda as Melsa and Peter in The Mad Miss Manton . Directed by Leigh Jason from a script by Philip G. Epstein, The Mad Miss Manton begins when vivacious Park Avenue socialite Melsa Manton finds a corpse while walking her dogs in the early hours of the morning. She calls the police, but they dismiss the incident — not only because Melsa is a notorious prankster, but also because the body disappears in the meantime.

Hoping that she would be inspired to repeat that accomplishment, Irving Thalberg, head of production at Metro, sent Marion to Chicago, Illinois to research story ideas. While flicking through the pages of The Saturday Evening Post , she found an article revealing that, in a city where people distrusted the police, a small group of leading citizens met in secret to arrange their own justice for criminals. Marion took inspiration from that story and wrote The Secret Six (1931), in which Wallace Beery and Lewis Stone, stars of The Big House , play two mobsters prosecuted by a half a dozen vigilantes. Thalberg was pleased with the leading roles Marion wrote for Beery and Stone, but asked if she could also fill out one of the minor leads for Clark Gable , a tall, dark and handsome 30-year-old actor whom Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had recen\n\nTheatrical release poster Directed by George Sidney , Who Was That Lady?

This list includes both classic and «modern» films, which make up a total of 161 titles. About three or four of these were re-watches, but I decided to include them anyway.

Since then, it has become one of the most influential war dramas, noted for its technical realism and spectacular air-combat sequences. This is the story of how it came to be made. A man and his story The concept for Wings originated from a writer trying to sell one of his stories. In September 1924, Byron Morgan approached Jesse L. Lasky, vice-president of Famous Players-Lasky, a component of Paramount Pictures, proposing that the studio do an aviation film. Morgan suggested an «incident and plot» focused on the failure of the American aerial effort in World War I and the effect that the country's «aviation unpreparedness» would have in upcoming conflicts. Lasky liked the idea, and approved the project under the working title «The Menace.» LEFT: Byron Morgan (1889-1963). RIGHT: Jesse L. Lasky (1880-1958).

I used to watch dozens of classic films every month, and every time I discovered a new star I liked I would go and watch their entire filmography. But somewhere along the way, that passion dimmed down. For instance, I watched 73 classic films in 2016, and only 10 in 2020. The other day, I found this film with Douglas Fairbanks Jr. that I had never heard of — the film is Mimi (1935), by the way — and for some reason it made me really excited about Old Hollywood again. It made me really miss the magic of that era and all the wonderful actors and actresses. And it also made me think of all the reasons why I fell in love with classic films in the first place. I came up with 80 reasons, which I thought would be fun to share with you. Most of them are just random little scenes or quirky little quotes, but put them together and they spell Old Hollywood to me.

Over the years, filmmakers have adapted various Christmas stories into both movies and TV specials, which have become staples during the holiday season all around the world. Even though Christmas is my favourite holiday, I haven't watched a lot of Christmas films. Still, I thought it would be fun to rank my top 10 favourites, based on the ones that I have indeed seen. Here they are. 10. Holiday Affair (1949) Directed by Don Hartman, Holiday Affair tells the story of a young widow (Janet Leigh) torn between a boring attorney (Wendell Corey) and a romantic drifter (Robert Mitchum). She's engaged to marry the boring attorney, but her son (Gordon Gebert) likes the romantic drifter better. Who will she choose? Well, we all know who she will choose. Holiday Affair is not by any means the greatest Christmas film of all time, but it's still a very enjoyable Yule-tide comedy to watch over the holi\n\nIn January 1944, MGM chief Louis B. Mayer happened to see a young crooner by the name of Frank Sinatra perform at a benefit concert for The Jewish Home for the Aged in Los Angeles. According to Nancy Sinatra, Frank's eldest daughter, Mayer was so moved by her father's soulful rendition of « Ol' Man River » that he made the decision right then and there to sign Frank to his studio. Sinatra had been on the MGM payroll once before, singing with the Tommy Dorsey Orchestra in the Eleanor Powell vehicle Ship Ahoy (1942), although it is very likely that Mayer never bothered to see that film. Now that Frank was «hot,» however, Metro made arrangements to buy half of his contract from RKO, with the final deal being signed in February of that year.
