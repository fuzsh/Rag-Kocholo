These latter efforts are generally ignored by students of world politics because they do not directly involve governments. A study of transnational environmental activist groups (TEAGs) such as Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, and World Wildlife Fund demonstrates that NGO societal efforts indeed shape widespread behavior throughout the world. TEAGs work through transnational social, economic, and cultural networks to shift standards of good conduct, change corporate practices, and empower local communities. This type of practice involves “world civic politics.” That is, TEAGs influence widespread behavior by politicizing global civil society—that slice of collective life which exists above the individual and below the state yet across national boundaries. This article examines the activity of world civic politics as practiced by environmental activists and evaluates its relevance for the study of NGOs and world politics in general.\n\nType\n\nResearch Article\n\nInformation\n\nWorld Politics , Volume 47 , Issue 3 , April 1995 , pp. 311 - 340\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1017/S0043887100016415 [Opens in a new window]\n\nCopyright\n\nCopyright © Trustees of Princeton University 1995\n\nAccess options\n\nGet access to the full version of this content by using one of the access options below.

The term has a long and continually evolving, if not contestable, conceptual history.

Later formulations, most notably those offered by Gramsci and Parsons, introduce a three-part model that differentiates civil society from both the state and the economy.

This was the central idea behind the Polish “self-limiting revolution,” which recognized the power of the state with its Soviet support and hence the improbability of toppling it. See Michnik (fn. 10).\n\n12\n\n12 In 1992 the budgets of Greenpeace International and World Wildlife Fund were roughly $100 million and $200 million, respectively. UNEP's budget was roughly $75 million.\n\n13\n\n13 In 1994 both Greenpeace and World Wildlife Fund each had over six million members.\n\n14\n\n14 For a comprehensive study of environmental NGOs in the developing world, with important references to transnational ones, see Fisher, Julie, The Road from Rio: Sustainable Development and the Nongovernmental Movement in the Third World (Westport, Conn.: Praeger, 1993)Google Scholar.\n\n15\n\n15 In 1967, for example, General Motors had production facilities in 24 countries and total sales of $20 billion. This total was greater than the GNP of all but 14 of the 124 members of the UN at the time. Also in 1967 Standard Oil of New Jersey had facilities in 45 countries and total sales of $13.3 billion.

It is important to note that Vernon was not a proponent of the transnationalist challenge, even though the title of his book provided a catchphrase to encapsulate the host of arguments advanced by its proponents. See Vernon, Raymond, “Sovereignty at Bay: Ten Years After,” International Organization 35 (Summer 1981)CrossRefGoogle Scholar.\n\n25\n\n25 In the words of John Ruggie, it could be said that the debate died down because scholars studied NGOs with an eye toward “institutional substitutability.” If NGOs cannot substitute for the state as an institutional entity, they become politically irrelevant. Ruggie argues that such a mind-set bleaches out much of the phenomena responsible for long-term political change. See John Gerard Ruggie, Territoriality and Beyond: Problematizing Modernity in International Relations,” International Organization 47 (Winter 1993), 143Google Scholar.\n\n26\n\n26 See Holsti, K.

There is still much to understand regarding the extent to which NGOs influence governments and the quality of their lobbying efforts. A focus on world civic politics, then, is not meant to supplant a statecentric notion of international politics so much as to augment it.\n\n32\n\n32 Harwood, Michael, “Daredevils for the Environment,” New York Times Magazine, October 2, 1988, p. 7Google Scholar.

It requires that one who has observed a morally objectionable act (in this case an ecologically destructive one) must either take action to prevent further injustice or stand by and attest to its occurrence; one may not turn away in ignorance. For bearing witness as used by Greenpeace, see Hunter (fn. 33); Brown, Michael and May, John, The Greenpeace Story (Ontario: Prentice-Hall Canada, 1989)Google Scholar; Greenpeace, , “Fifteen Years at the Front Lines,” Greenpeace Examiner 11 (October-December 1986)Google Scholar.\n\n35\n\n35 Hunter (fn. 33), 229.\n\n36\n\n36 Sociological perspectives on world politics have proliferated over the past few years.

According to a 1991 Gallup poll, 28 percent of the U.S. public claimed to have “boycotted a company's products because of its record on the environment,” and, according to Cambridge Reports, in 1990, 50 percent of respondents said that they were “avoiding the purchase of products by a company that pollutes the environment”—an increase of 18 percent since 1987.

See Wenzel, George, Animal Rights, Human Rights (Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1991), 124, table 6.12Google Scholar.\n\n49\n\n49 This led to a further drop in price.

There is no evidence that harp seals were ever an endangered species. This is particularly troubling because the activities of Greenpeace, IFAW, and others produced severe social dislocation and hardship for communities as far away as Greenland, Iceland, and the Faroe Islands, as well as in the coastal communities of Newfoundland and Baffin Island.

One should note that although the overall trend is to fund local NGOs, the amount of money going to local NGOs decreased in 1987. It increased the following year, however.\n\n79\n\n79 Cernea (fn. 78), 118, table 1. One should note that the reason for this shift in funding is a combination of the perceived failure of governments to promote development, the proved effectiveness of NGO responses to recent famines throughout Africa, and donor's preference for private sector development.

The state, however, does not supersede civil society but rather contains and preserves it in order to transform it into a higher level of social expression. The state's job, as it were, is to enable universal interest—in contrast to private interest—to prevail. In Hegelian terminology, it allows for the realization of ethical life in contrast to the abstract morality available in civil society. See Hegel's “Philosophy of Right,” trans. Knox, T. M. (London: Oxford University Press, 1967)Google Scholar.\n\n84\n\n84 More recent formulations of civil society, informed by new understandings of the public/private distinction, include the family as part of civil society.

It led to his “lowering the sights” of politics—that is, removing such matters as salvation and morality from the domain of political life— insofar as he recognized the limited capacities of state apparatuses.
