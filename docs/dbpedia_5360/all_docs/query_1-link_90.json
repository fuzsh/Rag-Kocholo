        "text": "PROGRAM DIRECTOR - ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF CRITICAL DANCE STUDIES\n\ndanielle.goldman@newschool.edu\n\nIn my research, I analyze the social, cultural, and historical conditions that affect how people move. I’m fascinated by critical theories of the body, and I tend to think about dance as an arena for experimental relations between self and other. These interests are informed by my experience as a dancer – taking class, rehearsing, and performing (most recently for the choreographers Sarah Michelson, Beth Gill and DD Dorvillier). Persistent shuttling between dance practice and academic work – two worlds that I’ve been trying to bridge for as long as I can remember – has shown me that dance and critical theory inform each other in significant ways, revealing much about embodiment, subjectivity, and notions of identity. I hope to make these relations apparent in my classes.\n\nMA and PhD, Performance Studies, New York University\n\nBA, Philosophy, Stanford University\n\nAuthor of I Want to be Ready: Improvised Dance as a Practice of Freedom (University of Michigan Press, 2010).\n\nCOURSES TAUGHT:\n\nBlack Boxes & White Cubes: Relations between Dance & the Visual Arts\n\nDance and Theories of Community\n\nDebates in Performance Studies\n\nEphemeral Art\n\nFirst Year Seminar: Improvisation: Embodied Practices in Art and Everyday Life\n\nFoundations in Dance Studies\n\nNew York Dance in the Eighties\n\nPolitics of Improvisation\n\nPerformance, Politics, and Power\n\nPerforming Intimacy\n\nReconsidering Judson\n\nSenior Seminar: Re-imagining the Archive\n\nPROGRAM DIRECTOR - PROFESSOR OF CHOREOGRAPHY\n\nneil.greenberg@newschool.edu\n\nI’ve been creating dances since 1979. I’m obsessed with the particular kinds of meaning that dance can provide (sensual, perceptual, phenomenological), and with how we construct meaninfulness from the various data we receive, in dance and in life. My extensive dance background includes working as a dancer with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company; as a teacher on the dance faculties of Purchase College, Sarah Lawrence College, and the University of California, Riverside; and as dance curator at The Kitchen, the interdisciplinary performance space in NYC. Together with my ongoing work as a choreographer these experiences all inform my teaching, though which I hope to help students find a broad understanding of what dance might be.\n\nCOURSES TAUGHT:\n\nDance Improvisation\n\nFirst Year Seminar: Performance Making and Viewing: Spectatorship and Meaning-Making\n\nIntroduction to Choreographic Research\n\nLang at Judson\n\nMoving with Somatics\n\nMusic & The Body\n\nPerformance & Meaning Making\n\nPerformance Research: Queering Cunningham & Cage\n\nPerformance Workshop\n\nSenior Seminar: Time-Based Performance\n\nAWARDS:\n\nGuggenheim Fellowship for Choreography; Foundation for Contemporary Arts Fellowship, 6 NEA Fellowships, “Bessie” New York Dance and Performance Awards for Not-About-AIDS-Dance (1994) and Partial View (2005); \"Bessie\" nomination, Outstanding Production, This (2014).\n\nLINKS:\n\nNeil’s website\n\nVideo of Neil’s choreography\n\ntop photo credit: Frank Mullaney\n\nbottom photo credit: Frank Mullaney, (like a vase) -2010\n\nluciana achugar is a Brooklyn-based choreographer from Uruguay who grew as an artist in close dialogue with the NY and Uruguayan contemporary dance communities.

After experiencing the NYC club scene of the late 80’s and being scouted to do background dancing for recording artists, she focused her energy on having a career in dance. Street performing with the Breeze Team/ Transformers gave her a solid and unique edge in her dance display. Traveling the world with Hip-hop dance pioneer and husband Kwikstep further exposed her to the reach and history of Hip-hop and became immersed in sharing its vernacular aspects. She quickly became known as a female contender in many styles such as House, Popping and Breaking not to mention the “uptown” free style of Hip-hop dance. After co founding Full Circle Prod a non profit Bronx-based dance company, she began to incorporate her poetry and vocal talents to the evening length engagements in addition to developing her choreographic and directorial skills. She was featured as a B girl in many rap music videos and appeared in a few films and work on commercial shoots as well. Internationally she is hired as an event host, dance teacher and dance contest judge as one of the few females that can hold her own in a male dominated genre. Martha Cooper asked her to contribute her story for the We B*Girlz photo book released in 2006 and she was invited to choreograph the players scene in the Oregon Shakespeare Festival's 70 anniversary season of Hamlet. Presently, she is working on part 2 of her documentary about the B girl lifestyle entitled “All The Ladies Say”. She proudly references her Latino culture and its presence in Hip-hop and has performed her original music at festivals such as Momma’s Hip-hop Kitchen and NJPAC’s Alternate Routes.\n\nCOURSES TAUGHT:\n\nHip Hop Dance Practices\n\nHip Hop Dance Practices Continued\n\nLINKS:\n\nwww.fullcirclesouljahs.com\n\nwww.alltheladiessay.com\n\nwww.larokasoul.com\n\nJuliette is a dancer, teacher and choreographer who has worked in and out of New York City since graduating from Sarah Lawrence College (BA) in 1993.

Through rooted ritual and spiritual practice, embodied poetics, Black critical studies, and queer theories of the body, kosoko conjures and crafts perpetual modes of freedom, healing, and care when/where/however possible.\n\njaamil is the recipient of awards including the 2022 Slamdance Jury Prize for Best Experimental Short film, 2021/22 MacDowell Fellowship, 2020 Pew Fellowship in the Arts, 2020 NCCAkron Creative Administrative Fellowship, 2019 NPN Creation & Development Fund award, 2019 Red Bull Arts Fellowship, 2019 NYSCA/NYFA Artist Fellowship in Choreography, 2017-2019 Princeton Arts Fellowship, 2018 NEFA National Dance Project Award, 2018-20 New York Live Arts Live Feed Residency, 2017 Cave Canem Poetry Fellowship, and consecutive 2016-2020 USArtists International Awards from the Mid-Atlantic Arts Foundation.\n\nBlending poetry and memoir, conversation and performance theory, their book Black Body Amnesia: Poems and Other Speech Acts, was released Spring 2022. Black Body Amnesia: LIVE, the performance reading, is a live theatrical event that examines the shapeshifting, illegible, and fugitive realities of Black diasporan people negotiating the psychic lifeworlds of living inside the American context. It is performed with an alternating ensemble of performers including jaamil olawale kosoko, Raymond Pinto, mayfield brooks, DJ Maij, and features original sound compositions by Everett-Asis Saunders. In this new work, kosoko uses complexity theory—which they define as the study of adaptive survivalist strategies inside complex networks or environments—as a performance device. From this artistic vantage point, the artist explores how minoritarianized communities record and affirm their existence through collaborative actions and protests, and how they then archive these personal freedom narratives to subvert culturally charged fields of systemic oppression, loss, and erasure.\n\nCOURSES TAUGHT:\n\nGuest Artist Residency Spring 2025\n\nLINKS:\n\nJaamil's website\n\nKaty Pyle is a choreographer and dancer whose works explore their own complex relationship to ballet.\n\nPyle graduated summa cum laude from Hollins University with a BA in Multimedia Performance Art in '02, and from the high school conservatory program at North Carolina School of the Arts in '99, majoring in Ballet and Contemporary.\n\nPyle then moved to New York City and danced in the works of Ivy Baldwin, Faye Driscoll, John Jasperse, Xavier Le Roy, Karinne Keithley, Jennifer Monson, Anna Sperber, Katie Workum, and Young Jean Lee, among many others.

These investigations gave rise to a wide range of works including: LONELINESS (2006), WOW MOM, WOW (2007), 837 VENICE BOULEVARD (2008, Bessie Award), THERE IS SO MUCH MAD IN ME (2010), YOU’RE ME (2012), and THANK YOU FOR COMING: ATTENDANCE (2014), the first in a series of works that propose performance as a shared political act, where performer and audience co-create reality.

I've toured nationally and internationally in England, Norway, Macedonia and Serbia.

Described in New York Magazine’s blog, Bedford and Bowery, “Whether it’s rapping, dancing, or throwing down in the (wrestling) ring, their work is high-energy, silly, odd, and even chaotic at times, going from spectacle to cartoon to pop culture critique and back again.”\n\nThe year 2016, Velez-Jackson’s tenth year of making experimental dance, fulfilled the famous Martha Graham adage “it takes ten years to make a dancer,” or in this case a choreographer.
