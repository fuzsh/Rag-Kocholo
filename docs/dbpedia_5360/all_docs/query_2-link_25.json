I truly love the performing arts, especially dance. Since I was young, I always looked for ways to be creative and bring my ideas to reality. I began creating and sewing my own Halloween costumes at an early age, with my mother at my side, teaching all the tricks of the seamstress trade. Luckily, my daughter became a beautiful dancer and through her years of dance school I volunteered my skills designing and styling costumes for performances dating back to 2002 and still going strong. Costume Design, Wardrobe styling, Makeup and hair styling to transform performers into their characters is a true passion. I now have the privilege to collaborate with Alex Jones and Project Alchemy, where I can continue to construct, create, dance a little and share my knowledge, visions and passion with amazing dancers, beautiful people and most of all, my incredibly talented, beautiful, amazing daughter."
