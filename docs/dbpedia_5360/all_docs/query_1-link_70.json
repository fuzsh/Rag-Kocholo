I would dearly love to hear from any of these men, especially Sp 4 Hill (meat) who saved my life from a sniper in a tree while I was placing out my claymore one evening while leaving my rifle back at our foxhole. Also as someone has stated both the St nd battalions of the nd Infantry Regiment holds an annual reunion in Pigeon Forge TN every year in late May. At the Norma Dan Motel. Everyone îs invited and urged to attend. It always runs from Thursday through Sunday. Next year, 2019 it will be May 30 through June 02.Thanks to Dave Berry for allowing me to say so much.Street kids living under the thunder.\n\nAs a \" new man and 18 years old I saw things a little differently than most. And I had a year in Vietnam and six months and freedom. I just wanted to get out with everything I had when I stepped on the ground in Saigon. After I started working the thunder fsb 's on highway 13 thunder road. I began to see dirty little kids in groups eating from our dump sites. They were orphans of the war. There were groups at each fsb. I had brothers and sisters their ages. I thought what if this happened to them. The only thing I could think of was to save candy and throw it to them when I saw them .i noticed a one armed blond haired kid who seemed to run the gang of kids. The one armed kid was around 8 years old. After watching them take orders from the kid with an arm missing above the elbow. It struck me the kid wearing only ragged dirty shorts was a girl. She had a bad temper if you yelled her. She cussed like a drunken sailor . After running into them the older boys would start talking about things . One time I purposely started an arguement with a couple and as we were going out to board choppers. One of them yelled at me I know where you are going . I said bullshit. He yelled an loc . When Lima 5 came by I said we're going to an loc. He looked at me and asked how in hell did you know that. Was someone monitoring our radio.\n\nIn my examination of all writings about Ong Thanh, we seem to come up with more reasons for our loss...from a more experienced 271st to faulty M-16s to being wornout from the last 10 days(true)I'm sure that all of these contributed BUT the real reasons were position, defense and surprise. These 3 were enough to take down any in unit; our boys were some of the best and our C o. Cmdrs. were tops. I also believe the other officers and key NCOS were good soldiers. Despite the Brass' comments; the Bn. Cmdr. was in the wrong slot; he was the sole cause of the massacre. There is NO shame by any member of A or D companies nor any on the unit. We did not blame the 7th Cav at Little Big Horn. My latest,THE CUL de SAC OF DEATH, captures, I pray, the emotions before, during and ater the battle of our men.I was at Lai Khe during that period and our main discussion was about the absence of Dog tags; as the 'lid' had been put on the facts of the battle. We didn't even know its name. Thanks for alerting me to this tragedy; it speaks volumes for young guys caught in a meat grinder BUT determined to survive and bring out their buddies.

I'm Howard E. Akins..B Co 2/18th 1st Infantry Div.(Big Red One)B co 1/28 September 12 or 13th september 1968. We b co left bandit hill major Bruner 1id . 5th special forces in commanding officer. B. Co. Filed out of ndp at bandit hill towards a yard village a few clicks away . We passed in backyard of a nicely groomed home and dipped into the rubber tree plantation ( the major told me to go to back of file and walk rear security . Instead of point. In the long rows of dripping trees I saw a person following way behind , darting from tree to tree. I pretended not to see him until I let him catch up . I stood sideways and he couldn't see where I went. He walked past me and I put my m 16 in his back and said chu hoi . Didn't know what else to say. We caught up to the patrol and I finally held up the column . Lt s were growling as they went to crouch position. The major aske me what was up. I told him the situation . After being interrogated the vietnamese man was picked up at a spot out on the thunder. We waited for a couple hours and a jeep picked him up and whisked him to saigon. I asked what would happen to him answer. He will be asked a lot of questions. When finished he will be given an i cream cone .Pagoda phu Loi after a long patrol ambush and patrol back to the pagoda. My team I call it because it was never a full platoon . We were seen by a second lt laying about on the bunkers resting and drying out from a wet R stormy night and some of the jungle was dense and difficult to pass through. Unless you walked trails . Back at the bunker lt sees us and jumped rooster on us. He thought hard and discovered a pile of clay tiles meant at one time a couple hundred. Years ago. Order stack all that tile . As he left I suggested to the rest let's use sticks to move those things. After killing a few scorpions came out to find out what was going on. We sprayed them with our dioxin mosquito repellent. Tha sent the writhing and soon dieing. At last to my horror a small snake came out of tiles and wrapped itself around my leg and bit into my pants leg ang hung on . I finally after looking like a dancing monkey knocked the snake to the ground a quick head stomp and the little snake with the tiny head lost the fight. Lt sees the ruckus walks over and says that's a two step you should have been messing with the snake. That was the first step growing into a black lion. To l 5 Wardell . You must have been at an loc when the mortar attack kia little joe from philly. I moved l p position at air strip we were being probed just after dark . I could hear the few strands of rusty barbed wire creaking at different intervals along an old non functional b wire fence. I called in on every radio I knew was monitoring . I may have asked for arty but no answer. I knew they were pacing out distances to the track company who were squeezed in that small thunder position. The last thing I said over the radio was blank blank I'm moving position. The only thing I heard back was you better not move your position. Ronnie baucom and another guy moved about 40 ft away and lay down a small hump in ground as side of airstrip. I kept an eye on the spot we were in . Ronnie and other guy were getting down and I was in center behind them. As I pushed to the ground I saw two or three mortar rounds hit our old spot. And then they concentrated in center of airstrip a few feet behind us. Then they walked the rounds I and went counter clockwise until they were out of amo. Laying on that strip that night taught me a good lesson. My life didn't mean much. Nothing made sense to me. Please contact me.\n\n\"We are their voices\"\n\nOnly surviving combat soldiers can tell their story with any accuracy.\n\nAs I was hanging my American flag up today in remembrance of Memorial Day (May 25, 2015), I was revisiting my last minutes in Vietnam after being air lifted out of the field, full of morphine with my best buddy laying next to me in a UH-1 helicopter. I was going home. I was one of the lucky ones so to speak.\n\nMore importantly to this story is my reoccurring memory not of my circumstance but of the two American soldiers that lost their earthly voices on October 27, 1967. They did not return home and their Western Union telegram to their families was much different than mine!\n\nI didn’t know either of these two American combat soldiers but I was on the friendly side of an NVA bunker when I spotted them. These two wounded American soldiers had encountered the full wrath of enemy NVA machine gun. I will never forget the desire to help them and be close enough to know that they were so riddled with bullets that their fate was most likely sealed but we stilled tried to help them. Leave no soldier behind was instilled in us!\n\nIn the end, try as we might to help them, they perished on that day only to be remembered as true “Hero’s” that gave of themselves for the good of their combat partners and our country.\n\nThough I have my own memories of my Vietnam experience, I’m alive, able and willing to help tell their story. As veterans and families of fallen soldiers, we must keep their stories alive with the hope that those who live in this country somehow appreciate the sacrifice others have paid for them.\n\nThe take-away message about these two United States combat soldiers is that there were 58,220 Armed Forces members that lost their life in Vietnam so the rest of us could try to make them proud of their service and our accomplishments.\n\nFor me, my heart has much empathy for those that serve our country and especially our combat soldiers.\n\nWhat do you do to make America worth them dying for us?\n\nGary Chamberlain\n\nVietnam veteran 1967\n\nChu Lai, Vietnam\n\nB Troop, 1st Squadron, 1st Armored Cavalry\n\nCornville, AZ USA\n\nFolksvilleUSA@gmail.com\n\nThanks for providing this website!\n\nHOWAD \"DUCK\" AKINS B Co 2/18th Infantry 1st Infantry Div.

Howard Akins 2212 Chamberlain Ave Chattanooga Tn 37404 scrapmaster_p@comcast.net THANKS!!!!Hello my dad was in Vietnam in Mat Control from July 31,1967-1968. I do not know where he was stationed when he went possibly England. I was born in 1969 at Scott Air Firce base. My mother said he never fought as all he did was draw maps and hand out supplies, but I got a letter that said he worked from 6 am to 6 pm and pulled guard duty every night sometime between 11:30 pm- 2:00 am. Every night VC attacked them but they always won as he put it. He said he had 5 airmen working for him. My father was from China his father was an officer in the KMT and close ties with Chennault. His mother was in prison for being a Christain. My mother says he didn't do anything much. He was in the Air Force for 22 years. If you know my father please tell me the truth about him because I have suffered a life time without him. All the others favored my mother. I was my father's child and always felt abducted. People have always been very mean to me because I'm European and Chinese and I have always had to be tough but after all these years I'm not so tough anymore as I still just want to go home. I want to tell him it was an honor to have him as my father. No matter what he did.Hi, my name is Cindy (Hall) Davis Peterson. I am making contact with you on behalf of my father, Joseph A. Hall III. He served during Operation Billings, and I am trying to find others that served as well. He was a Platoon Sgt with the 1/16 Infantry, B Company, again, his name is Joe, he was from Virginia. I was reading aloud to him, the info wiki had about Operation billings, at this time he gave me three names...Company Commander Owens, Company Commander Waltzman, and one Lt Benjamin \"Benny\" Star, that at a later date went to recon, and at some point, lost his life. These men were from B and C Company. Please if you have info to share, or know of ways I can see if I could find living soldiers from this operation, you can contact me at boston1445@hotmail.com or on FB under Cindy Davis Peterson in Tennessee. I recently posted a picture on Face Book that came from the front page of the American Traveler. It is dated June 24th, 1967, Vol 28, No 24. The front page picture is of my dad,while in battle, he is laying on his belly, pointing in the direction of where VC are firing upon them..... this is what I have to offer info wise, and would be elated to learn more. Thanks again, not only for reading this, but for your sacrifice, and your service to this great country. I look forward to hearing from you..... Joe's girl, CindyThese are fantastic pictures. From about April, 1968 to August,1968 I was Forward Observer Asst to Lt. Charles Smith Forward Observer of Alpha Co. 2/28. After he went home, I became the forward observer Sgt. Henry E. Smith( niner one romero ) for Alpha Co. I was called Smitty then.I was permanently assigned to Charlie Battery 2/33rd Artillery.There was a battle around May or June, 1968 that consisted of a batallion (2nd/28th)size S&D coming in contact with a regiment of NVA in a massive bunker complex on a hill near I think Loc Ninh. To my recollection, Delta was in lead with Alpha and Charlie behind them. A lot of guys got killed and wounded. I recall that we came off that hill escorted by air strikes to our rear and 11 Armoured Cav. on point. This was a battle it seems very similar to Ong Tranh in October, 1967. I remember the company commander and several others in the command section getting killed by a short round being fired line over us. The round hit a tree showering down sharpnel killing everyone directly underneath. There was a Commander who was killed while in a helicopter overlooking the battle. It's all confusing to me and have haunted me all these years because of the eerie similarity to Ong Tranh in 1967. Even the name Cpt Jim Blackwell is recalled for this battle, though I know a captain of that same name died in Ong Tranh 1967.If anyone can help me with clarifying all of this I would greatly appreciate it.I was the Arty forward observer with Alpha Company 2/28 in 67 during Billings and numerous other operations prior to that campaign. Captain Donald Sawtelle was the company commander and 1 was a 1st Lt. When in Lai Khe I shared a hooch with Lt Brad Boeham and Lt Welch.\n\nBillings was by far the most trying operation I was on. I have seen different versions of how bad it was, but I noticed that nothing is mentioned about the Recon Platoon being hit by friendly fires (remember a bomb fell short in the woods at the south end of the LZ. I also remember how bad the 1/16th got hit and churning up the North West quadrant of landing zone xray until it was just smoking branches and kindling - the forest just disappeared on the northeast side. Vietcong had overrun some of the line and we were asked by the platoon leader to bring fire on their own position. That was an awful situation. I know that when I controlled fire on the northwest quadrant we brought it in so close that we were being hit by our own shrapnel nothing serious but it did hurt. I was hit in the back by a small sliver and on the foot with a piece that did nothing but bounced off my boot and hurt like hell..It hurt worse than the little piece that penetrated my shoulder.\n\nCaptain Sawtelle rotated back home after billings and i was given a nice job of fire direction officer - little safer when you are underground..\n\nOddly I was the fire direction officer firing for my replacement when Terry Allen brought his men back the same path they went in on and was overran that 17th Oct 67 . My replacement was killed along with my previous Kilo  Sadly I do not remember his name, but he was one hell of a great guy. I do have pictures of him and maybe someone will recognize him. My name is David Hearne and I was a 1st lt when I was with the Big Red one. My call sign was Dungeon Niner Seven. My current Email is fpsoft@aol.com - I also have occasional contact with Donald Sawtelle (CPT)  who was also one wonderful guy to serve with. Hi i am looking for guys that were in the 2/28 C co i was 2/3 squade leader i was wonded but not there, but i was there durning the 3 nights of the wave attacks until we got the arty in to fire point blank at the gooks i was on LP the first night they hit us with two new guys but when the s--t happened they left me out there with their wepons and the radio when i was finally told to come back in i went looking for them, they were hiding from me the bad thing was i was their squad leader i was 2/3 so if anyone remembers me or the time it happened i would be very greatful, the VA is giving me a hard time with my PTSD saying i was not in the line of fire, i was wonded later on but the army never put that on my records at least none that i have found thats why i'm trying to prove that i was there i was shot in the head so i do remember names just the events so if some one remembers SGT CANO 2nd platoon 3rd squad please let me know sgtleadhead@gmail.com\n\nlove and respect\n\nRamon Cano"
