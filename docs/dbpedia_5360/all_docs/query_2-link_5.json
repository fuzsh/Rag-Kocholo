        "text": "Augustine “Augie” Marie Lusk\n\nFormerly Highland Falls, NY\n\nAugustine “Augie” Marie Lusk, a resident of Aiken, SC and a former 74-year resident of Highland Falls, NY died peacefully in her sleep after a brief illness; She was 100 years young. She is survived by her: daughter, Michele & her husband Luis of Aiken, SC, son Alan of Palm Beach, FL, and her grandchildren Rebecca & fiancee’ Gerard of Long Island, NY, Kyle of Rhode Island, Thomas stationed in Germany, and Kayleigh of Maryland. Additionally, her sister Marguerite, and brothers Jacques & wife Lyalla, Donat, Henri; sister- in- law Rejeanne; and many cousins, nieces & nephews in the US and Canada.\n\nAugie was predeceased by her daughter Barbara Ann; son Herbie and husband Herb and additionally predeceased by her mother Marie Louise, father Augustin, sisters Marianne and Noella and brothers Augustin, Emile and Roland.\n\nAugie first came to the United States to work at West Point with her sister Marianne when she was just sixteen years old. Before he became famous, Augie went on several dates with a young man named Charles Durning. She loved to share her memories about what a great dancer he was and all the times she went dancing at the Pick Wick in Highland Falls.\n\nAugie was a homemaker raising her children, caring for her neighbor’s children and later helped care for several of her elderly neighbors as well. She also worked part time at The Park Restaurant for over 23 years. Over the course of her life, she also gave countless hours to helping others and volunteering for many causes dear to her heart.\n\nShe was a 42-year volunteer at The Sacred Heart Thrift Shop and Food Pantry until she was 90 years old. She received a “Women of Distinction Award” for those years of service in 2004. She sadly outlived almost all of her dear friends from the Thrift Shop, Highland Falls, Fort Montgomery and West Point. She spoke of all of them fondly, recalling many great memories and missed them all to her last days. She also was a past member of the Highland Falls Senior Citizens Club, the Pike County Senior Club and The Pike/Wayne County Association for the Blind Support Group and member of Sacred Heart Church. She also leaves behind the friends she made at both Twin Cedars in PA and Trinity in SC.\n\nAugie did not have an easy life, surviving the loss of her children, cancer several times and going blind, but she still loved life, and was totally devoted to always giving everything her all. Her deep faith, that never seemed to waiver, and her sheer will and determination to never give up were many of the reasons why she got to celebrate her 100th birthday this year and for that, we will forever be grateful.\n\nArrangements are being made by Shellhouse Funeral Home of Aiken, SC and a funeral memorial service will be held at West Point, NY by the family at a later date.\n\nPatricia Nugent\n\nFebruary 25, 1955—April 30, 2021\n\nFort Montgomery, NY\n\nPatricia Nugent, beloved grandmother and dear friend to many, passed away peacefully from a brief and complicated battle with cancer on April 30, 2021. Born Patricia Elizabeth O’Hara on February 25, 1955, she was the fifth of nine siblings raised in Yonkers, NY, and for the past 40 years made a home in Fort Montgomery.\n\nPatti is survived by her husband of 43 years, Edward; siblings Kathleen Mills, Jean Murphy, Susan Harrington, and Barbara, Thomas, and Peter O’Hara; daughters Pamela Nugent, and Emily (Charles) Cheadle; grandson Francis Cheadle; along with many nieces and nephews and their families. She is predeceased by parents John Sr. and Kathleen Ann (Riley) O’Hara, and siblings John Jr. (Jack) and Carol O’Hara.\n\nThroughout her life, Patti touched many with her particular sense of humor and sage advice. She was a friendly face that many looked forward to seeing at her various jobs in the community, in places such as Dyroff’s pharmacy, the Sacred Heart School cafeteria, M&R Deli, and most recently, the Holiday Inn Express. Patti was known for being a great host, always having the scoop on friends and family, and for her generosity towards others. A memorial service is planned for later this year."
