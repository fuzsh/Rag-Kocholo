        "text": "IT was just another Wednesday night at the McCarter Theater here, the actors just back after two days off. That means an off night. Especially right after the rush of opening night on Friday, the tension of press performances the rest of the weekend. Now for an ordinary night to regain wind, energy, momentum.\n\nBut ordinariness is unimaginable, given the ensemble drawn together by the director Scott Zigler in David Mamet's ''Glengarry Glen Ross.'' If anything, the play itself could come off as ordinary, even passe, 16 years after the Pulitzer, 8 after a much-touted starry movie version.\n\nAnd in a confluence of events, the explosive film, ''Boiler Room,'' was released nationwide, on the very day the familiar ''Glengarry'' resurfaced in New Jersey. Surely Ben Younger's dazzling take on sleazily grasping modern-day con men -- their monkey business is selling fake I.P.O.'s, not real estate swamplands named Glengarry Highlands -- would signify the taming of Mr. Mamet, master chronicler of human sharks.\n\nEven though Mr. Younger, the 29-year-old writer and director, by his own admission, was ''tipping my hat to David Mamet,'' his movie rife with ''Glengarry'' references, the personifications of greed in ''Boiler Room'' are in their early 20's. Of the six so-called salesmen in ''Glengarry,'' four are in their early 40's; three in their 50's. And a seventh, not a mere hustler but the devil's slick pitchman, brought in to give lead-deficient, therefore dying salesmen a booster shot, is just the one who inspired and ignited Mr. Younger's homage to Mr. Mamet. Many feel that a barker named Blake, an added character, drives the plot, all the more dating the play.\n\nMr. Zigler's speed-the-clock staging allows no time for useless comparisons and validates Mr. Mamet's still contemporary, still scatalogical play. The director is Mamet-schooled in the best unstereotypical sense. Too many productions of the playwright's works have been peopled by practitioners of a dubious, stylized Mamet-endorsed acting method. Mr. Zigler's extraordinary Broadway staging of Mr. Mamet's ''Old Neighborhood'' in 1997 probed, painfully, the subtleties and seething undercurrents of tormented pasts, never failing to sock across theatrical power. Here is just the director for a high octane, immensely funny, up to the millisecond version of a play, most likely not seen by Mr. Younger, who presumably has had only text and video as guide.\n\nNear the end, when Roma, of the early 40's group, says, ''We are the members of a dying breed. That's . . . that's . . . that's why we have to stick together,'' it is excruciatingly clear that the breed is not dying, only morphing. Let an actor with the slithering command of Ruben Santiago-Hudson have a tear at the role and he'll shake the earth simply by announcing, ''My name is Richard Roma.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
