        "text": "Ernest Borgnine was born Ermes Effron Borgnino on January 24, 1917 in Hamden, Connecticut. His parents were Anna (Boselli), who had emigrated from Carpi (MO), Italy, and Camillo Borgnino, who had emigrated from Ottiglio (AL), Italy. As an only child, Ernest enjoyed most sports, especially boxing, but took no real interest in acting. At age 18, after graduating from high school in New Haven, and undecided about his future career, he joined the United States Navy, where he stayed for ten years until leaving in 1945. After a few factory jobs, his mother suggested that his forceful personality could make him suitable for a career in acting, and Borgnine promptly enrolled at the Randall School of Drama in Hartford. After completing the course, he joined Robert Porterfield's famous Barter Theatre in Abingdon, Virginia, staying there for four years, undertaking odd jobs and playing every type of role imaginable. His big break came in 1949, when he made his acting debut on Broadway playing a male nurse in \"Harvey\".\n\nIn 1951, Borgnine moved to Los Angeles to pursue a movie career, and made his film debut as Bill Street in The Whistle at Eaton Falls (1951). His career took off in 1953 when he was cast in the role of Sergeant \"Fatso\" Judson in Verdammt in alle Ewigkeit (1953). This memorable performance led to numerous supporting roles as \"heavies\" in a steady string of dramas and westerns. He played against type in 1955 by securing the lead role of Marty Piletti, a shy and sensitive butcher, in Marty (1955). He won an Academy Award for Best Actor for his performance, despite strong competition from Spencer Tracy, Frank Sinatra, James Dean and James Cagney. Throughout the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, Borgnine performed memorably in such films as Mädchen ohne Mitgift (1956), Eisstation Zebra (1968) and Ein Zug für zwei Halunken (1973). Between 1962 and 1966, he played Lt. Commander Quinton McHale in the popular television series McHale's Navy (1962). In early 1984, he returned to television as Dominic Santini in the action series Airwolf (1984) co-starring Jan-Michael Vincent, and in 1995, he was cast in the comedy series Ein Single kommt immer allein (1995) as doorman Manny Cordoba. He also appeared in several made-for-TV movies.\n\nErnest Borgnine has often stated that acting was his greatest passion. His amazing 61-year career (1951 - 2012) included appearances in well over 100 feature films and as a regular in three television series, as well as voice-overs in animated films such as Charlie - Ein himmlischer Held (1996), Small Soldiers (1998), and a continued role in the series SpongeBob Schwammkopf (1999). Between 1973 until his death, Ernest was married to Tova Traesnaes, who heads her own cosmetics company. They lived in Beverly Hills, California, where Ernest assisted his wife between film projects. When not acting, Ernest actively supported numerous charities and spoke tirelessly at benefits throughout the country. He has been awarded several honorary doctorates from colleges across the United States as well as numerous Lifetime Achievement Awards. In 1996, Ernest purchased a bus and traveled across the United States to see the country and meet his many fans. On December 17, 1999, he presented the University of North Alabama with a collection of scripts from his film and television career, due to his long friendship with North Alabama alumnus and actor George Lindsey (died May 6, 2012), who was an artist in residence at North Alabama.\n\nErnest Borgnine passed away aged 95 on July 8, 2012, at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, California, of renal failure. He is survived by his wife Tova, their children and his younger sister Evelyn (1926-2013)\n\nJohn Belushi was born in Chicago, Illinois, USA, on January 24, 1949, to Agnes Demetri (Samaras) and Adam Anastos Belushi, a restaurant owner. His father was an Albanian immigrant, from Qytezë, and his mother was also of Albanian descent. He grew up in Wheaton, where the family moved when he was six. Though a young hellion in grade school, John became the perfect all-American boy during his high school years where he was co-captain of the Wheaton Central High School football team and was elected homecoming king his senior year. He also developed an interest in acting and appeared in the high school variety show. Encouraged by his drama teacher, John decided to put aside his plans to become a football coach to pursue a career in acting.\n\nAfter graduation in 1967, John performed in summer stock in rural Indiana in a variety of roles from \"Cardinal Wolsey\" in \"Anne of a Thousand Days\" to a comic detective in \"Ten Little Indians\". In the fall of his freshman year at the University of Wisconsin at Whitewater, John changed his image into a bad-boy appearance by growing his hair long and began to have problems with discipline and structure of attending classes.\n\nDropping out of Wisconsin, John spent the next two years at the College of DuPage, a junior college a few miles from his parents' Wheaton home, where his father began persuading him to become a partner in his restaurant, but John still preferred acting. While attending DuPage, John helped found the \"West Compass Players\", an improv comedy troupe patterned after Chicago's famous \"Second City\" ensemble.\n\nIn 1971, John made the leap to \"Second City\" itself where he performed in various on-stage comic performances with others, who included Harold Ramis and Joe Flaherty. John loved his life at \"Second City\" where he performed six nights a week, perfecting the physical \"gonzo\" style of comedy he later made famous.\n\nA year later, John and his live-in girlfriend from his high school years, Judith Belushi-Pisano, moved to New York because John had joined the cast of National Lampoon's Lemmings, an off-Broadway rock musical revue that was originally booked for a six-week run but played to full crowds for nearly 10 months.\n\nIn 1973, John was hired as a writer for the syndicated National Lampoon's Radio Hour which became the National Lampoon Show in 1975. John's big break came that same year when he joined the ground-breaking TV variety series Saturday Night Live (1975) which made him a star. The unpredictable, aggressively physical style of humor that he began on \"Second City\" flowered on SNL.\n\nIn 1978, while still working on Saturday Night Live (1975), John appeared in the movie Der Galgenstrick (1978) which starred and was directed by Jack Nicholson. It was here that director John Landis noticed John and decided to cast him in his movie National Lampoon's Ich glaub', mich tritt ein Pferd (1978). John's minor role as the notorious, beer-swilling \"Bluto\" made it a box-office smash and the year's top grossing comedy. Despite appearing in only a dozen scenes, John's performance stole the movie, which portrays college fraternity shenanigans at a small college set in the year 1962.\n\nIn 1979, John along with fellow SNL regular Dan Aykroyd quit the series to pursue movie projects. John and Dan Aykroyd appeared in minor roles in Steven Spielberg's financially unsuccessful 1941 - Wo bitte geht's nach Hollywood (1979) and, the following year, in John Landis' Blues Brothers (1980). Around this time, John's drug use began escalating. Cocaine, which was ubiquitous in show-business circles in the 1970's, became his drug of choice. After he first experimented with cocaine in the mid 1970s, John almost immediately became addicted to it. His frequent cocaine sniffing binges became a source of friction between him and Judy, whom he married in 1976.\n\nJohn's love for blues and soul music inspired the \"Blues Brothers\". He and Aykroyd first appeared as Joliet Jake and Elwood Blues, a pair of white soul men dressed in black suits, skinny ties, fedora hats and Rayban sunglasses, as a warm-up act before the telecasts of Saturday Night Live (1975). Building on the success of their acts and the release of their album \"A Briefcase Full of Blues\", John and Dan Aykroyd starred in the movie, which gave John a chance to act with his favorite musical heroes including Ray Charles, James Brown and Aretha Franklin.\n\nAlthough John's reputation for being an off-screen party animal is legendary, his generous side is less well known. Using some of his money, he bought his father a ranch outside San Diego for him to live. John helped set up some of his Chicago friends with their own businesses and even financially helped his younger brother, Jim Belushi, who followed his older brother's path to both \"Second City\" and Saturday Night Live (1975).\n\nIn 1981, John appeared in the movie Zwei wie Katz und Maus (1981), playing a hard-nosed Chicago newspaperman who finds romance in Colorado with eagle expert Blair Brown. That same year, John and Dan Aykroyd appeared again in the movie Die verrückten Nachbarn (1981), which gave them a chance to reverse roles, with John playing a straight-arrow family man whose life is turned upside down when a wild family man (Aykroyd) moves in next door.\n\nIn January 1982, John began work on the screenplay for another movie to be titled \"Noble Rot\". Also, John had checked into a bungalow at the Chateau Marmont, a popular celebrity hotel in Los Angeles. John's drug use had been steadily increasing for over a year now, which alarmed his wife and friends, but he continued to promise Judy that he would quit someday. On March 5, 1982, John Belushi was found dead in his hotel room at the age of 33. The local coroner gave the cause of death as a lethal injection of cocaine and heroin. Several years later, John's drug dealing/drug user companion during his final weeks, Cathy Evelyn Smith, was tried and sentenced to three years in prison for supplying John with the drugs. Close friend James Taylor sang \"That Lonesome Road\" at a memorial service at Martha's Vineyard cemetery where John was buried.\n\nCandy was one of Canada's greatest and funniest character actors. His well-known role as the big hearted buffoon earned him classics in Allein mit Onkel Buck (1989) and Ein Ticket für zwei (1987). His career has handed him some dry spells but Candy always rebounded.\n\nBorn in Newmarket, Ontario, in the year 1950, Candy was the son of Evangeline (Aker) and Sidney James Candy. His mother was of Ukrainian and Polish ancestry. Candy found his passion for drama while attending a community college. In 1971 Candy made his TV debut in an episode of Polizeiarzt Simon Lark (1971) co-starring Sharon Farrell, John Hamelin, and Nick Mancuso. Candy then found a number of bit parts in other Canadian television shows and also in such small films as Tunnel Vision (1976) and Alle entführen Victoria (1976). However, his big success came at the age of twenty-seven, when he became part of the comedy group \"Second City\" in Toronto. Alongside such soon-to-be Canadian stars as Catherine O'Hara (one of Candy's lifelong friends), Eugene Levy, Rick Moranis, and Harold Ramis, Candy was also part of the television show the group inspired. Second City TV (1976) earned Candy a reputation for his quirky humor and his uncanny imitations of others.\n\nAfter the television series, Candy appeared alongside fellow Canadian Dan Aykroyd in the Steven Spielberg flop 1941 - Wo bitte geht's nach Hollywood (1979). However, other jobs followed and Candy landed a role, once again with Aykroyd, in the successful classic Blues Brothers (1980). Candy played a parole officer who is part of the chase after Jake and Elwood Blues. The film was a hit and Candy followed up accordingly.\n\nCandy acted in the smash hit Ich glaub' mich knutscht ein Elch! (1981) where he played a dopey, overweight recruit affectionately nicknamed 'Ox'. After the success of Ich glaub' mich knutscht ein Elch! (1981), Candy returned to the Second City with the other former stars, in SCTV Network 90 (1981). Candy also hosted \"Saturday Night Live\" before landing himself a role in the Ron Howard film Splash: Jungfrau am Haken (1983), a romantic comedy about a mermaid who washes ashore and learns to live like a human. Candy played a sleazy womanizing brother to the character played by Tom Hanks. The film was a bigger success than even Ich glaub' mich knutscht ein Elch! (1981) and a number of people have said that Splash: Jungfrau am Haken (1983) was his breakout role.\n\nHe took a second billing in the comedic film Zum Teufel mit den Kohlen (1985) where a man must spend thirty million in order to inherit three hundred million from his deceased relative. Candy played the man's best friend, who accidentally gets in the way as much as helping out. Candy continued making films tirelessly, including the film Zwei Unter Volldampf (1986) where he and Eugene Levy play characters who become security guards.\n\n1987 was an especially good year to Candy, giving him two classic roles: Barf the Mawg in the Mel Brooks comedy Spaceballs - Mel Brooks' verrückte Raumfahrt (1987) and the bumbling salesman Del Griffith alongside Steve Martin's uptight character in the John Hughes film Ein Ticket für zwei (1987). The latter film is a golden classic and is one of Candy's greatest films. He followed up immediately with Ferien zu dritt (1988), once again alongside Dan Aykroyd. Candy landed another classic role in the film Allein mit Onkel Buck (1989) which was about a bumbling uncle who must look after his brother's three children.\n\nAlthough he was in the smash hit Kevin - Allein zu Haus (1990), Candy's career fell into a slump, turning out unsuccessful films in the early nineties. This caused him to change his strategy by taking more serious roles. The first of these serious roles was the corrupt lawyer Dean Andrews in the 'Oliver Stone' film JFK: Tatort Dallas (1991). The film was a big success, and Candy moved on from this victory to make the film Cool Runnings - Dabei sein ist alles (1993) about the first Jamaican bobsled team.\n\nCandy was well known for his size, six feet two and weighing around 300 pounds. However, he was very sensitive about the subject and in the nineties tried to lose weight and quit smoking. He was aware that heart attacks were in his family: both his father and his grandfather died of heart attacks and Candy wanted to prevent that happening to him as best he could.\n\nIn the mid-nineties Candy filmed the Michael Moore comedy Unsere feindlichen Nachbarn (1995) then went to Mexico to film the western spoof Wagons East! (1994). It was in Mexico that Candy had a heart attack and passed away in March 1994. Unsere feindlichen Nachbarn (1995) was released a year after his death and is his last film.\n\nCandy was loved by thousands of people who loved his classic antics in Splash: Jungfrau am Haken (1983) and Ferien zu dritt (1988). He was well-known for his roles in Ich glaub' mich knutscht ein Elch! (1981) and Allein mit Onkel Buck (1989) and he himself never forgot his Canadian background.\n\nDanny DeVito has amassed a formidable and versatile body of work as an actor, producer and director that spans the stage, television and film.\n\nDaniel Michael DeVito Jr. was born on November 17, 1944, in Neptune, New Jersey, to Italian-American parents. His mother, Julia (Moccello), was a homemaker. His father, Daniel, Sr., was a small business owner whose ventures included a dry cleaning shop, a dairy outlet, a diner, and a pool hall.\n\nWhile growing up in Asbury Park, his parents sent him to private schools. He attended Our Lady of Mount Carmel grammar school and Oratory Prep School. Following graduation in 1962, he took a job as a cosmetician at his sister's beauty salon. A year later, he enrolled at New York's American Academy of Dramatic Arts so he could learn more about cosmetology. While at the academy, he fell in love with acting and decided to further pursue an acting career. During this time, he met another aspiring actor Michael Douglas at the National Playwrights Conference in Waterford, Connecticut. The two would later go on to collaborate on numerous projects. Soon after he also met an actress named Rhea Perlman. The two fell in love and moved in together. They were married in 1982 and had three children together.\n\nIn 1968, Danny landed his first part in a movie when he appeared as a thug in the obscure Dreams of Glass (1970). Despite this minor triumph, Danny became discouraged with the film industry and decided to focus on stage productions. He made his Off-Broadway debut in 1969 in \"The Man With the Flower in His Mouth.\" He followed this up with stage roles in \"The Shrinking Bride,\" and \"Lady Liberty.\" In 1975, he was approached by director Milos Forman and Michael Douglas about appearing in the film version of Einer flog über das Kuckucksnest (1975), which would star Jack Nicholson in the leading role. With box office success almost guaranteed and a chance for national exposure, Danny agreed to the role. The movie became a huge hit, both critically and financially, and still ranks today as one the greatest movies of all time. Unfortunately, the movie did very little to help Danny's career. In the years following, he was relegated to small movie roles and guest appearances on television shows. His big break came in 1978 when he auditioned for a role on an ABC sitcom pilot called Taxi (1978), which centered around taxi cab drivers at a New York City garage. Danny auditioned for the role of dispatcher Louie DePalma. At the audition, the producers told Danny that he needed to show more attitude in order to get the part. He then slammed down the script and yelled, \"Who wrote this sh**?\" The producers, realizing he was perfect for the part, brought him on board. The show was a huge success, running from 1978 to 1983.\n\nLouie DePalma, played flawlessly by Danny, became one of the most memorable (and reviled) characters in television history. While he was universally hated by TV viewers, he was well-praised by critics, winning an Emmy award and being nominated three other times. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Danny maintained his status as a great character actor with memorable roles in movies like Auf der Jagd nach dem grünen Diamanten (1984), Die unglaubliche Entführung der verrückten Mrs. Stone (1986), Schmeiß' die Mama aus dem Zug (1987) and Twins - Zwillinge (1988). He also had a great deal of success behind the camera, directing movies like Der Rosenkrieg (1989) and Jimmy Hoffa (1992). In 1992, Danny was introduced to a new generation of moviegoers when he was given the role of The Penguin/Oswald Cobblepot in Tim Burton's highly successful Batmans Rückkehr (1992). This earned him a nomination for Best Villain at the MTV Movie Awards. That same year, along with his wife Rhea Perlman, Danny co-founded Jersey Films, which has produced many popular films and TV shows, including Pulp Fiction (1994), Schnappt Shorty (1995), Der Mondmann (1999) and Erin Brockovich (2000). DeVito has many directing credits to his name as well, including Schmeiß' die Mama aus dem Zug (1987), Der Rosenkrieg (1989), Jimmy Hoffa (1992), Tötet Smoochy (2002) and the upcoming St. Sebastian.\n\nIn 2006, he returned to series television in the FX comedy series It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia (2005). With a prominent role in a hit series, Devito's comic talents were now on display for a new generation of television viewers. In 2012, he provided the title voice role in Dr. Seuss' Der Lorax (2012).\n\nThese days, he continues to work with many of today's top talents as an actor, director and producer.\n\nAs might be said for the late and great comedians Harvey Korman and Madeline Kahn, it seems that Mel Brooks was the only director on the planet who knew how to best utilize this funnyman's talents on film. Brooks once remarked that, whenever he cast Dom in one of his films he'd add an extra two days to the shooting schedule because of delays between takes due to the constant laughter from cast and crew at Dom's improvisations.\n\nThe lovable, butterball comedian was a mainstay on 1960s and '70s TV variety as a \"second banana,\" or comic-relief player. While his harsher critics believed his schtick would be better served in smaller doses, Dom nevertheless went on to find some range in a few moving, more restrained projects. Those few glimpses behind all the mirth and merriment revealed a dramatic actor waiting to be unleashed. As they say, behind every clown's smile, one finds tears.\n\nHe was born Dominick DeLuise on August 1, 1933, in Brooklyn, New York, to parents John, a sanitation engineer, and Vicenza (DeStefano) DeLuise, both Italian immigrants. A natural school-class clown, his irrepressible sense of humor helped Dom fit in at school, and he started drawing belly laughs fairly young in his very first school play that had him portraying an inert copper penny! He later attended New York's High School of Performing Arts, but when it came to college, he decided to major in biology at Tufts University, outside Boston. That decision failed to expunge the idea of being a comedian from his head and heart, however, and that determination finally prevailed.\n\nDom's formative years as an actor were spent apprenticing at the Cleveland Playhouse, where which he gamely played roles in everything from contemporary shows like \"Guys and Dolls\" and \"Stalag 17\" to classics like \"The School for Scandal\" and even \"Hamlet.\" He earned his first professional paycheck playing the titular Bernie the dog in \"Bernie's Last Wish.\" Dom also got a taste of what it was like in front of the camera in Cleveland, appearing on the local TV kiddie's show \"Tip Top Clubhouse.\"\n\nBack in NYC, he took over the lead role of Tinker the toymaker in another children's local program, Tinker's Workshop (1954), for one season in 1958. He also started making noise on the off-Broadway scene. Appearing in the plays \"The Jackass\" and \"All in Love,\" he became part of the featured ensemble of the 1961 musical revue \"An Evening with Harry Stoones,\" which included 19-year-old Barbra Streisand. More outlandish musical roles came his way in the early 1960s with \"Little Mary Sunshine\" (as Corporal Billy Jester) and \"The Student Gypsy, or the Prince of Liederkrantz\" (his Broadway debut as Muffin T. Raggamuffin). While appearing in the lighthearted summer stock spoof \"Summer & Smirk\" in Provincetown, Massachusetts, Dom met fellow performer Carol Arthur (née Carol Arata). They married on November 23, 1965. Their three sons, Peter DeLuise, Michael DeLuise and David DeLuise all eventually found their way into show business. In 1971, Dom returned successfully to Broadway in a perfectly-suited Neil Simon vehicle, \"The Last of the Red Hot Lovers.\"\n\nDom was first noticed on the smaller screen, creating the sketch character of Dominick the Great, a magician who tries in vain to mask his inept prestidigitations with feigned dignity on Garry Moore's popular show. The comedian truly thrived in this TV variety atmosphere and soon began popping up seemingly everywhere: (The Hollywood Palace (1964), The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour (1967), The Jackie Gleason Show (1966)). Balding, blushing, dimpled and moon-faced (comparisons to a ripe tomato were not wide of the mark), he was readily equipped with a high-wattage, Cheshire Cat smile that became his trademark. At his best, looking embarrassed or agitated, the laughs usually came at his own expense, whether playing a panic-stricken klutz or squirming nervous-Nelly type. Dom took his magician character to the ensemble comedy show The Entertainers (1964), which also showcased Carol Burnett and Bob Newhart, and found more regular employment as a bumbling private eye in puppeteer Shari Lewis' daytime children's program, and as a foil for Dean Martin on the entertainer's regular and summer replacement shows. Dom again repeated his Dominick the Great character on Martin's show and received great reception. He later found himself part of Martin's \"in-crowd\" of comedians on his \"celebrity roasts.\"\n\nDom's obvious comic genius was more readily evident, and succeeded better, in tandem with other performers than it was on its own. Hosting duties for his very first comedy/variety program The Dom DeLuise Show (1968), which featured wife Carol as part of the regular roster, lasted only one summer. The sitcom Lotsa Luck! (1973), which showcased Dom as bachelor Stanley Belmont having to contend with a live-in mother (a harping Kathleen Freeman) and sister (an ungainly Beverly Sanders), was canceled after its first season. He gave it a rest for awhile before trying once again with the sketch-like sitcom The Dom DeLuise Show (1987), but it, too, quickly faded. Another brief stint was as host of a revamped Candid Camera (1991).\n\nWhile Dom made an unlikely film debut as a high-strung Air Force technician in the gripping nuclear drama Angriffsziel Moskau (1964) starring Henry Fonda, it was in zany, irreverent comedy that he found his true calling. Appearing in support of others such as Sid Caesar and Mary Tyler Moore, respectively, in the so-so comedies The Busy Body (1967) and Hochzeitsnacht vor Zeugen (1968), he proved a delight as an inept, dim-witted spy in the Doris Day caper Spion in Spitzenhöschen (1966).\n\nMel Brooks first cast Dom as the miserly Russian Orthodox priest, Father Fyodor, in his film Zwölf Stühle (1970), and found plenty of room for the comedian after that -- as campy director Buddy Bizarre in Der wilde wilde Westen (1974), the silly-ass director's assistant in Mel Brooks letzte Verrücktheit - Silent Movie (1976), Emperor Nero in Mel Brooks' verrückte Geschichte der Welt (1981), the voice of the cheese-oozing Pizza the Hutt in the \"Star Wars\" parody Spaceballs - Mel Brooks' verrückte Raumfahrt (1987), and as Sherwood Forest's very own puffy-cheeked Godfather, Don Giovanni, in Robin Hood - Helden in Strumpfhosen (1993).\n\nA very close friend of action star Burt Reynolds, Dom romped through a number of Reynolds' freewheeling films as well, including Das ausgekochte Schlitzohr ist wieder auf Achse (1980), Auf dem Highway ist die Hölle los (1981) and Das schönste Freudenhaus in Texas (1982). One of his finest scene-stealing film roles, in fact, was as Reynolds' schizo pal in Nobody Is Perfect (1978). Dom went on to direct a number of stage productions for his close friend at the Burt Reynolds Theatre in Jupiter, Florida -- among them \"Butterflies Are Free,\" \"Same Time, Next Year\" (starring Burt and Carol Burnett), \"Brighton Beach Memoirs\" (starring son Peter), and the musical \"Jump\" (featuring wife Carol). Still another comic buddy, Gene Wilder, handed Dom the roles of the indulgent opera star in Sherlock Holmes cleverer Bruder (1975) and harassed movie mogul Adolf Zitz in Der größte Liebhaber der Welt (1977). Dom later joined Wilder once again, along with Wilder's wife Gilda Radner, in the leaden comedy Hochzeitsnacht im Geisterschloß (1986), a clumsy haunted-house spoof that even Dom, in full drag, could not salvage.\n\nChange-of-pace roles were few and far between. One that did come Dom's way was the compulsive-eating protagonist in Fetty - Der Dicke legt los! (1980). Directed by and co-starring Brooks' wife Anne Bancroft, Dom managed to mix comedy with pathos. Obesity was also a chronic, real-life problem for the comedian and, at one point in 1999, it was reported that he had tipped the scales at 325 lbs. On a positive note, this passion for food actually fed into a more lucrative sideline -- as a respected chef and culinary author (\"Eat This\" and \"Eat This Too\") in which he appeared all over the tube cooking and demonstrating his favorite recipes. He also found time to write children's books on the side.\n\nDom tackled broad comedy films with great abandon -- a wallflower he was not -- but they were hit-or-miss. Some of his biggest misses were the Mae West disaster Sextette (1977), the Dudley Moore showcase Oh, Moses! (1980) (although Dom was arguably the best thing in it), Der Harte und der Zarte (1990), in which he appeared as portly pornographer Harry \"The Hippo\" Gutterman, Trabbi Goes to Hollywood (1991), which filmed far away in Germany, and Das Schweigen der Hammel (1994), a parody on the horror genre in which he played Dr. Animal Cannibal Pizza.\n\nFilms could also be a family affair. True to life, Dom played a sympathetic kiddie show host in the moving TV-movie Happy (1983). Also the executive producer, he was joined by wife Carol and all three sons in the cast. In addition, Dom offered a cameo in Traumpaar wider Willen (2003), a film written by Peter, directed, edited and executive-produced by Michael, and featuring roles for the rest of the family.\n\nDom's voiceover skills did not go untapped, either, in films including the animated features Mrs. Brisby und das Geheimnis von NIMH (1982), Feivel, der Mauswanderer (1986) and Charlie - Alle Hunde kommen in den Himmel (1989), plus all of their offshoots. The heavily-bearded DeLuise even displayed scene-stealing antics on the operatic scene, once playing the speaking part of Frosch the Jailer in Johann Srauss II's operetta \"Die ,\" at the Metropolitan Opera.\n\nSuffering from various physical ailments in later years, some of which were exacerbated by his chronic obesity and diabetes, Dom's health declined, and he died in 2009 at age 75. His wife and three children survive him, as do three grandchildren.\n\nKevin Patrick Smith was born in Red Bank but grew up in Highlands, New Jersey, the son of Grace (Schultz) and Donald E. Smith, a postal worker. He is very proud of his native state; this fact can be seen in all of his movies. Kevin is of mostly German, with some Irish and English, ancestry.\n\nHis first movie, Clerks - Die Ladenhüter (1994), was filmed in the convenience store in which Smith worked. He was only allowed to shoot at night after the store closed. This movie won the highest award at the Sundance film festival and was brought to theaters by Miramax. The movie went over so well that Smith was able to make another movie, Mallrats (1995). This movie, as Kevin has said, was meant to be a \"smart Porkys\". Although it didn't do well at all in the box office, it has done more than well on video store shelves and is usually the favorite among many Smith fans.\n\nDuring filming for the movie, Smith met his new close friends and stars of his next movie, Ben Affleck, Jason Lee, and his new girlfriend, Joey Lauren Adams. Smith has said that his relationship with Adams has been much of an inspiration for his next movie, Chasing Amy (1997), Smith's comedy drama which won two independent Spirit awards: Best Screenplay and Best Supporting Role (for Jason Lee). Around the time that Chasing Amy (1997) was wrapping, Smith broke up with Adams and, then when the Spirit awards were approaching, he met his soon-to-be wife, Jennifer Schwalbach Smith. After Chasing Amy (1997), Smith started on Dogma (1999), a controversial film about Christianity. Around this time, Smith's wife gave birth to their first baby girl, Harley Quinn Smith. Harley Quinn and Jennifer both have roles in Smith's next film,Jay und Silent Bob schlagen zurück (2001). In this road trip comedy, the cult heroes, Jay and Silent Bob, go on an adventure to stop the production of a movie being made about them, find true love, and save an orangutan.\n\nIn 2004, he wrote and directed Jersey Girl (2004), starring Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler. Although there were some disappointing reviews and the movie was a disappointment at the box office, Smith says it did alright going up against the \"Bennifer Massacre\" known as Liebe mit Risiko - Gigli (2003).\n\nIn 2005, Smith wrote the screenplay for Clerks II (2006), which he planned to start shooting in January of 2005. But then he got a call from Susannah Grant, who wanted Smith to audition for her new film. Smith went into the audition and, five minutes after finishing, he got a call saying he got the part. Filming began in January 2005 so Smith had to delay the filming of Clerks II (2006). After Lieben und lassen (2006) finished filming, Smith shot \"Clerks II\" in September 2005. After cutting \"Clerks II\", they submitted it to the Cannes film festival. It got accepted and, at Cannes, it got an 8 minute standing ovation.\n\nIn 2006, Smith also got offered a part in the fourth \"Die Hard\" film, Stirb langsam 4.0 (2007). Smith got to film a scene with one of his idols, Bruce Willis, the scene was supposed to take one day of filming, it ended up taking a week. In 2007, Smith was also hired to direct the pilot for the show Reaper - Ein teuflischer Job (2007), which garnered favorable reviews.\n\nIn 2007 and 2008, Smith wrote two scripts: a comedy, Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008), and a horror film called Red State (2011). Harvey Weinstein green-lighted \"Zack and Miri\", based just off the title, although they passed on \"Red State\", Smith plans to get \"Red State\" independently funded. Smith filmed \"Zack and Miri\" with comedy starSeth Rogen. The film did not meet expectations at the box office but got good reviews. It is Smith's highest grossing movie, although he says he was crushed by the disappointing box office of the film.\n\nSmith was offered the chance to direct a film which was written by Robb Cullen and Mark Cullen called Cop Out - Geladen und entsichert (2010). Smith accepted, it would be two firsts; the first feature Smith has directed but not written and the first feature of Smith's that Scott Mosier has not produced (Mosier is trying to find a film to direct). Smith hired Bruce Willis for the film."
