        "text": "Cyanide compounds are produced and used in commerce in large quantities. In the United States, for example, approximately 200 million pounds of sodium cyanide are used annually just in heap leaching extraction of gold from ore, with much of this use taking place in one state, Nevada, which accounts for about 70% of U.S. gold production. Large amounts of sodium cyanide are also used in electroplating. Cyanide compounds are also produced incidentally in many processes, such as in aluminum and steel production, and are associated with wastewaters, solid wastes, and air emissions from these processes. In addition, cyanide compounds are present in legacy wastes disposed onsite at numerous manufactured gas plant sites in the United States and Europe. As a result, cyanide is a commonly encountered contaminant in water and soil."
