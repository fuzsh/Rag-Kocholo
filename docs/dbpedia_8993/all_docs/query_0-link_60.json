        "text": "Milk pH as a function of CO2 concentration, temperature, and pressure in a heat exchanger.\n\nPubMed\n\nMa, Y; Barbano, D M\n\n2003-12-01\n\nRaw skim milk, with or without added CO2, was heated, held, and cooled in a small pilot-scale tubular heat exchanger (372 ml/min). The experiment was replicated twice, and, for each replication, milk was first carbonated at 0 to 1 degree C to contain 0 (control), 600, 1200, 1800, and 2400 ppm added CO2 using a continuous carbonation unit. After storage at 0 to 1 degree C, portions of milk at each CO2 concentration were heated to 40, 56, 72, and 80 degrees C, held at the desired temperature for 30 s (except 80 degrees C, holding 20 s) and cooled to 0 to 1 degree C. At each temperature, five pressures were applied: 69, 138, 207, 276, and 345 kPa. Pressure was controlled with a needle valve at the heat exchanger exit. Both the pressure gauge and pH probe were inline at the end of the holding section. Milk pH during heating depended on CO2 concentration, temperature, and pressure. During heating of milk without added CO2, pH decreased linearly as a function of increasing temperature but was independent of pressure. In general, the pH of milk with added CO2 decreased with increasing CO2 concentration and pressure. For milk with added CO2, at a fixed CO2 concentration, the effect of pressure on pH decrease was greater at a higher temperature. At a fixed temperature, the effect of pressure on pH decrease was greater for milk with a higher CO2 concentration. Thermal death of bacteria during pasteurization of milk without added CO2 is probably due not only to temperature but also to the decrease in pH that occurs during the process. Increasing milk CO2 concentration and pressure decreases the milk pH even further during heating and may further enhance the microbial killing power of pasteurization.\n\nEffects of niacin supplementation and dietary concentrate proportion on body temperature, ruminal pH and milk performance of primiparous dairy cows.\n\nPubMed\n\nLohÃ¶lter, Malte; Meyer, Ulrich; Rauls, Caroline; Rehage, JÃ¼rgen; DÃ¤nicke, Sven\n\n2013-06-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to investigate the effects of niacin and dietary concentrate proportion on body temperature, ruminal pH and milk production of dairy cows. In a 2 Ã 2 factorial design, 20 primiparous Holstein cows (179 Â± 12 days in milk) were assigned to four dietary treatments aimed to receive either 0 or 24 g niacin and 30% (low) or 60% (high) concentrate with the rest being a partial mixed ration (PMR) composed of 60% corn and 40% grass silage (on dry matter basis). Ambient temperature and relative humidity were determined and combined by the calculation of temperature humidity index. Respiration rates, rectal, skin and subcutaneous temperatures were measured. Milk production and composition were determined. Ruminal pH and temperature were recorded at a frequency of 5 min using wireless devices for continuous intra-ruminal measurement (boluses). pH values were corrected for pH sensor drift. The climatic conditions varied considerably but temporarily indicated mild heat stress. Niacin did not affect skin, rectal and subcutaneous temperatures but tended to increase respiration rates. High concentrate reduced skin temperatures at rump, thigh and neck by 0.1-0.3Â°C. Due to the technical disturbances, not all bolus data could be subjected to statistical evaluation. However, both niacin and high concentrate influenced mean ruminal pH. High concentrate increased the time spent with a pH below 5.6 and ruminal temperatures (0.2-0.3Â°C). Niacin and high concentrate enhanced milk, protein and lactose yield but reduced milk fat and protein content. Milk fat yield was slightly reduced by high concentrate but increased due to niacin supplementation. In conclusion, niacin did not affect body temperature but stimulated milk performance. High concentrate partially influenced body temperatures and had beneficial effects on milk production.\n\nFacile synthesis of concentrated gold nanoparticles with low size-distribution in water: temperature and pH controls\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLi, Chunfang; Li, Dongxiang; Wan, Gangqiang; Xu, Jie; Hou, Wanguo\n\n2011-07-01\n\nThe citrate reduction method for the synthesis of gold nanoparticles (GNPs) has known advantages but usually provides the products with low nanoparticle concentration and limits its application. Herein, we report a facile method to synthesize GNPs from concentrated chloroauric acid (2.5 mM) via adding sodium hydroxide and controlling the temperature. It was found that adding a proper amount of sodium hydroxide can produce uniform concentrated GNPs with low size distribution; otherwise, the largely distributed nanoparticles or instable colloids were obtained. The low reaction temperature is helpful to control the nanoparticle formation rate, and uniform GNPs can be obtained in presence of optimized NaOH concentrations. The pH values of the obtained uniform GNPs were found to be very near to neutral, and the pH influence on the particle size distribution may reveal the different formation mechanism of GNPs at high or low pH condition. Moreover, this modified synthesis method can save more than 90% energy in the heating step. Such environmental-friendly synthesis method for gold nanoparticles may have a great potential in large-scale manufacturing for commercial and industrial demand.\n\nSilica Precipitation from Geothermal Brines: Effects of Iron Addition, Kinetics, Temperature, pH, and Brine Concentration\n\nDOE Data Explorer\n\nJay Renew\n\n2016-02-06\n\nThis document provides results of experiments aimed at removing silica from geothermal brines. All experiments were conducted with simulated brines. The data presented shows the effect of iron addition, kinetics, temperature, pH and brine concentration.\n\nTemperature, soluble solids and pH effect on Alicyclobacillus acidoterrestris viability in lemon juice concentrate.\n\nPubMed\n\nMaldonado, MarÃ­a C; Belfiore, Carolina; Navarro, Antonio R\n\n2008-02-01\n\nAlicyclobacillus acidoterrestris is a thermoacidophilic, non-pathogenic, spore-forming bacterium detected in spoiled commercial pasteurized fruit juice. Apple, white grape and tomato are particularly susceptible. A. acidoterrestris spores are resistant to lemon juice pasteurization (2 min at 82 degrees C), and they can germinate and grow causing spoilage. This contamination is characterized by a medicinal or disinfectant smell attributed to guaiacol (o-dihydroxybenzene) production and other taint chemicals. The aim of this work was to study the influence of temperature (82, 86, 92 and 95 degrees C), total soluble solids (SS) (6.20, 9.8, 50 and 68 degrees Brix) and pH (2.28, 2.45, 2.80, 3.25, 3.5) on decimal reduction time (D) of the A. acidoterrestris in clarified and non-clarified concentrated lemon juice. Once D-value was determined, the resistance of A. acidoterrestris at the assayed temperatures was confirmed. SS and pH influence spore viability, because spore resistance increases with higher SS (50 degrees Brix 22 min 82 degrees C-68 degrees Brix 28 min 82 degrees C) and pH values (pH 2.28, 17 min-pH 4.00, 22 min). Bacterial growth was lower in clarified lemon juice, 26 min at 82 degrees C, than in non-clarified lemon juice, 51 min at 82 degrees C. Temperature was the parameter that had the greatest influence on the D value.\n\nInfluence of temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen concentration on enhanced biological phosphorus removal under strictly aerobic conditions.\n\nPubMed\n\nNittami, Tadashi; Oi, Hiroshi; Matsumoto, Kanji; Seviour, Robert J\n\n2011-12-15\n\nPrevious research has suggested that enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR) from wastewater can be achieved under continuous aerobic conditions over the short term. However, little is known how environmental conditions might affect aerobic EBPR performance. Consequently we have investigated the impact of temperature, pH and dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations on EBPR performance under strictly aerobic conditions. A sequencing batch reactor (SBR) was operated for 108 days on a six-hour cycle (four cycles a day). The SBR ran under alternating anaerobic-aerobic conditions as standard and then operated under strictly aerobic conditions for one cycle every three or four days. SBR operational temperature (10, 15, 20, 25 and 30Â°C), pH (6, 7, 8 and 9) and DO concentration (0.5, 2.0 and 3.5mg/L) were changed consecutively during the aerobic cycle. Recorded increases in mixed liquor phosphorus (P) concentrations during aerobic carbon source uptake (P release) were affected by the biomass P content rather than the imposed changes in the operational conditions. Thus, P release levels increased with biomass P content. By contrast, subsequent aerobic P assimilation (P uptake) levels were both affected by changes in operational temperature and pH, and peaked at 20-25Â°C and pH 7-8. Highest P uptake detected under these SBR operating conditions was 15.4 mg Pg-MLSS(-1) (at 25Â°C, pH 7 and DO 2.0mg/L). The ability of the community for linked aerobic P release and P uptake required the presence of acetate in the medium, a finding which differs from previous data, where these are reported to occur in the absence of any exogenous carbon source. Fluorescence in situ hybridization was performed on samples collected from the SBR, and Candidatus 'Accumulibacter phosphatis' cells were detected with PAOmix probes through the operational periods. Thus, Candidatus 'Accumulibacter phosphatis' seemed to perform P removal in the SBR as shown in previous studies on P removal under\n\nInfluence of condensing equipment and temperature on exhaled breath condensate pH, total protein and leukotriene concentrations.\n\nPubMed\n\nCzebe, Krisztina; Barta, Imre; Antus, BalÃ¡zs; Valyon, MÃ¡rta; HorvÃ¡th, IldikÃ³; Kullmann, TamÃ¡s\n\n2008-05-01\n\nExhaled breath condensate analysis is an attractive but still not fully standardised method for investigating airway pathology. Adherence of biomarkers to various condensing surfaces and changes in condensing temperature has been considered to be responsible for the variability of the results. Our aims were to compare the efficacy of different types of condensers and to test the influence of condensing temperature on condensate composition. Breath condensates from 12 healthy persons were collected in two settings: (1) by using three condensers of different type (EcoScreen, R-Tube, Anacon) and (2) by using R-Tube condenser either cooled to -20 or -70 degrees C. Condensate pH at standardised CO(2) level was determined; protein content was measured by the Bradford method and leukotrienes by EIA. Breath condensates collected using EcoScreen were more alkaline (6.45+/-0.20 vs. 6.19+/-0.23, p<0.05 and 6.10+/-0.26, p<0.001) and contained more protein (3.89+/-2.03 vs. 2.65+/-1.98, n.s. and 1.88+/-1.99 microg/ml, p<0.004) as compared to the other devices. Only parameters obtained with R-Tube and Anacon correlated. Condensing temperature affected condensate pH (5.99+/-0.20 at -20 degrees C and 5.82+/-0.07 at -70 degrees C, p<0.05) but not protein content. Leukotriene B(4) was not found in any sample and cysteinyl-leukotriene was not found in condensates collected with R-Tube or Anacon. Condenser type influences sample pH, total protein content and cysteinyl-leukotriene concentration. Condensing temperature influences condensate pH but not total protein content. These results suggest that adherence of the biomarkers to condenser surface and condensing temperature may play a role but does not fully explain the variability of EBC biomarker levels.\n\nEffect of pH, temperature, and lead concentration on the bioremoval of lead from water using Lemna minor.\n\nPubMed\n\nUysal, YaÄmur; Taner, Fadime\n\n2009-09-01\n\nThis study examined the ability of the aquatic plant Lemna minor (duckweed) to remove soluble lead under various laboratory conditions. In a batch process L. minor was exposed to different pH values (4.5-8.0) and temperature (15-35 degrees C) in presence of different lead concentrations (0.1-10.0 mg L(-1)) for 168 h. The amount of biomass obtained in the study period on a dry weight basis, the concentrations of lead in tissue and in medium and net uptake of lead by Lemna all have been determined in each condition. The percentages of lead uptake ratios (PMU) and bioconcentration factors (BCF) were also calculated for these conditions. Bioaccumulated lead concentrations and the PMU were obtained at lowest pH of 4.5, and at 30 degrees C. The highest accumulated lead concentration was found at pH 4.5 as 3.599 mg Pb g(-1) in 10.0 mg L(-1). It decreased to pH 6.0, but it did not change at pH 6.0-8.0 range. The maximum lead accumulation was obtained at 30 degrees C as 8.622 mg Pb g(-1) in 10 mg L(-1) at pH 5.0, and the minimum was at 15 degrees C as 0.291 mg g(-1) in 0.1 mg L(-1). Lead accumulation gradually increased with increasing lead in medium, but the opposite trend was observed for PMU. Lead accumulation increased up to 50 mg L(-1), but did not change significantly in the 50.0-100.0 mg L(-1) range. The lead uptake from water was modeled and the equation fit the experimental data very well\n\nEffects of pH and Temperature on the Stability of Fumonisins in Maize Products.\n\nPubMed\n\nBryÅa, Marcin; WaÅkiewicz, Agnieszka; Szymczyk, Krystyna; JÄdrzejczak, Renata\n\n2017-03-01\n\nThis paper is a study of the stability of fumonisins in dough based on maize flour prepared in a phosphate buffer with a pH of 3.5, 5.5 or 7.5 and baked at a temperature within the range of 100-250 Â°C. Buffers with various pH values were tested, since it is well-known that pH may significantly influence interactions of fumonisins with other substances. A standard analytical procedure was used to determine the concentration of free fumonisins. Hydrolysis in an alkaline medium was then applied to reveal the hidden forms, while the total fumonisins concentations was determined in another measurement. The total concentration of fumonisins was statistically higher in pH = 3.5 and pH = 5.5 than the concentration of free fumonisins; no similar difference was found at pH = 7.5. The applied phosphate buffer pH 7.5 may enhance solubility of fumonisins, which would increase extraction efficiency of free analytes, thereby decreasing the difference between concentrations of total and free fumonisins. Hydrolysed Bâ fumonisin (HFBâ) and partially hydrolysed Bâ fumonisin (isomers a and b: PHFB 1a and PHFB 1b , respectively) were the main investigated substances. For baking temperatures below 220 Â°C, fumonisins were slightly more stable for pH = 5.5 than for pH = 3.5 and pH = 7.5. In both of these latter cases, the concentration of partially hydrolysed fumonisins grew initially (up to 200 Â°C) with an increase in the baking temperature, and then dropped. Similar behaviour was observed for free HFBâ, which may suggest the following fumonisin degradation mechanism: initially, the tricarballylic acid (TCA) groups are removed from the molecules, and next, the HFBâ molecules disintegrate.\n\nEffects of pH and Temperature on the Stability of Fumonisins in Maize Products\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBryÅa, Marcin; WaÅkiewicz, Agnieszka; Szymczyk, Krystyna; JÄdrzejczak, Renata\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThis paper is a study of the stability of fumonisins in dough based on maize flour prepared in a phosphate buffer with a pH of 3.5, 5.5 or 7.5 and baked at a temperature within the range of 100â250 Â°C.

In particular, by varying all 3 factors simultaneously, the interactions between them could also be determined. Fresh feces and artificial urine solutions were combined into a slurry to characterize the rate of urea hydrolysis under 2 temperatures (15Â°C and 35Â°C), 3 urea concentrations in urine solutions (500, 1,000, and 1,500 mg of urea-N/dL), and 3 pH levels (6, 7, and 8). Urea N concentration in slurry was analyzed at 0.0167, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 h after initial mixing. A nonlinear mixed effects model was used to determine the effects of urea concentration, pH, and temperature treatments on the exponential rate of urea hydrolysis and to predict the hydrolysis rate for each treatment combination. We detected a significant interaction between pH and initial urea level. Increasing urea concentration from 1,000 to 1,500 mg of urea-N/dL decreased the rate of urea hydrolysis across all pH levels. Across all pH and initial urea levels, the rate of urea hydrolysis increased with temperature, but the effect of pH was only observed for pH 6 versus pH 8 at the intermediate initial urea concentration. The fast rates of urea hydrolysis indicate that urea was almost completely hydrolyzed within a few hours of urine mixing with feces. The estimated urea hydrolysis rates from this study are likely maximum rates because of the thorough mixing before each sampling. Although considerable mixing of feces and urine occurs on the barn floor of commercial dairy operations from cattle walking through the manure, such mixing may be not as quick and thorough as in this study. Consequently, the urea hydrolysis rates from this study indicate the maximum loss of urea and should be accounted for in management aimed at mitigating ammonia emissions from dairy cattle manure under similar urea concentration, pH\n\nEvaluation of the effect of temperature, pH, and bioproduction on Hg concentration in sediments, water, molluscs and algae of the delta of the Ebro river.\n\nPubMed\n\nSchuhmacher, M; Domingo, J L; Llobet, J M; Corbella, J\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe effects of temperature, pH, and bioproduction on mercury levels in sediments, water, molluscs and algae from the delta of the Ebro river (NE Spain) were determined in this study. Mercury concentrations were measured in a cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The ranges of mercury concentrations were the following: sediments, 0.014-0.185 microgram g-1; water, 0.001-0.018 microgram g-1; molluscs, 0.118-0.861 microgram g-1; and algae 0.008-0.026 microgram g-1. Although not statistically significant, a decrease in the pH of the water corresponded with a diminution in the content of mercury in sediments and molluscs, while the mercury levels in water and algae were lower in the areas with high levels of bioproduction. The concentrations of mercury in water significantly decreased with temperature. However, the differences with temperature of the mercury concentrations in sediments did not reach the level of significance. Consequently, water would not be an adequate indicator to determine the levels of mercury contamination, although both sediments and molluscs can be used for this purpose.\n\nInteracting Effects of pH, Temperature, and Salt Concentration on Growth and Survival of Vibrio parahaemolyticus\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBeuchat, L.

A.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nCellulose is the most abundant biopolymer in soils and globally ubiquitous. It serves as a primary carbon source for myriad microbes able to release cellulases which cleave the cellulose into smaller molecules. For example, Î²-glucosidase, one type of cellulase, breaks down a terminal Î²-glycosidic bond of cellulose. The carbon of the liberated glucose becomes available for microbial uptake, after which it can then be mineralized and returned to the atmosphere via heterotrophic respiration. Thus, exoenzymes play an important role in the global cycling of carbon. Numerous studies suggest that global warming potentially increases the rate at which Î²-glucosidase breaks down cellulose, but it is not known how pH of the soil solution influences the effect of temperature on cellulose decomposition rates; this is important given the globally wide range of soil pH. Using fluorescence enzyme assay techniques, we studied the effect of temperature and pH on the reaction rate at which purified Î²-Glucosidase decays Î²-D-cellobioside (a compound often employed to simulate cellulose). We evaluated the temperature sensitivity of this reaction at five temperatures (5, 10, 15, 20, and 25Â°C) and six pH values (3.5, 4.5, 5.5, 6.5, 7.5, and 8.5)encompassing the naturally occurring range in soils, in a full-factorial design. First, we determined Vmax at 25Â°C and pH 6.5, standard conditions for measuring enzyme activities in many studies. The Vmax was 858.65 Î¼mol h-1mg-1and was achieved at substrate concentration of 270 Î¼M. At all pH values, the reaction rate slowed down at lower temperatures; at a pH of 3.5, no enzymatic activity was detected. The enzyme activity was significantly different between pH 4.5 and higher pHs. For example, enzyme reactivity at pH 4.5 was significantly lower than that at 7.5 at 20 and 25Â°C (Bonferroni-corrected P =0.0006, 0.0004, respectively), but not at lower temperatures. Similarly, enzyme reactivity at pH 4.5 was lower than that at pH 8.5 at 10, 15\n\nEffects of constant pH and unsteady pH at different free ammonia concentrations on shortcut nitrification for landfill leachate treatment.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Chaosheng; Zhang, Shaoqing; Zhang, Liqiu; Rong, Hongwei; Zhang, Kefang\n\n2015-04-01\n\nOn the basis of achieving shortcut nitrification in a lab-scale SBR, the effects of constant pH and unsteady pH at different free ammonia concentrations on shortcut nitrification for landfill leachate treatment was investigated. The results indicate that under the condition of DO of 0.5âÂ±â0.2 mg/L and temperature of 30âÂ±â2 Â°C, the absolute value of nitrite accumulation increased significantly with the increase in free ammonia (FA) concentration from 5.30 to 48.67 mg/L; however, the nitrite accumulation rate remained almost constant at a constant pH of 8.0âÂ±â0.1. Ammonia oxidation and the nitrite accumulation become slow with the pH decreased from 8.0âÂ±â0.1 to 7.5âÂ±â0.2, and the activities of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) were severely inhibited when the pH further decreased to 6.5. More importantly, this study confirmed that the pH decrease from 8.0 to 6.5 within a short time exhibited significant negative effect on the ammonia oxidation rather than the FA concentration.\n\nOrganic solvent tolerance of an Î±-amylase from haloalkaliphilic bacteria as a function of pH, temperature, and salt concentrations.\n\nPubMed\n\nPandey, Sandeep; Singh, S P\n\n2012-04-01\n\nA haloalkaliphilic bacterium was isolated from salt-enriched soil of Mithapur, Gujarat (India) and identified as Bacillus agaradhaerens Mi-10-6â based on 16S rRNA sequence analysis (NCBI gene bank accession, GQ121032). The bacterium was studied for its Î±-amylase characteristic in the presence of organic solvents. The enzyme was quite active and it retained considerable activity in 30% (v/v) organic solvents, dodecane, decane, heptane, n-hexane, methanol, and propanol. At lower concentrations of solvents, the catalysis was quite comparable to control. Enzyme catalysis at wide range of alkanes and alcohol was an interesting finding of the study. Mi-10-6â amylase retained activity over a broader alkaline pH range, with the optimal pH at 10-11. Two molars of salt was optimum for catalysis in the presence of most of the tested solvents, though the enzyme retained significant activity even at 4 M salt. With dodecane, the optimum temperature shifted from 50 Â°C to 60 Â°C, while the enzyme was active up to 80 Â°C. Over all, the present study focused on the effect of organic solvents on an extracellular Î±-amylase from haloalkaliphilic bacteria under varying conditions of pH, temperature, and salt.\n\nAlternative approach to modeling bacterial lag time, using logistic regression as a function of time, temperature, pH, and sodium chloride concentration.\n\nPubMed\n\nKoseki, Shige; Nonaka, Junko\n\n2012-09-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to develop a probabilistic model to predict the end of lag time (Î») during the growth of Bacillus cereus vegetative cells as a function of temperature, pH, and salt concentration using logistic regression. The developed Î» model was subsequently combined with a logistic differential equation to simulate bacterial numbers over time. To develop a novel model for Î», we determined whether bacterial growth had begun, i.e., whether Î» had ended, at each time point during the growth kinetics. The growth of B. cereus was evaluated by optical density (OD) measurements in culture media for various pHs (5.5 â¼ 7.0) and salt concentrations (0.5 â¼ 2.0%) at static temperatures (10 â¼ 20Â°C). The probability of the end of Î» was modeled using dichotomous judgments obtained at each OD measurement point concerning whether a significant increase had been observed. The probability of the end of Î» was described as a function of time, temperature, pH, and salt concentration and showed a high goodness of fit. The Î» model was validated with independent data sets of B. cereus growth in culture media and foods, indicating acceptable performance. Furthermore, the Î» model, in combination with a logistic differential equation, enabled a simulation of the population of B. cereus in various foods over time at static and/or fluctuating temperatures with high accuracy. Thus, this newly developed modeling procedure enables the description of Î» using observable environmental parameters without any conceptual assumptions and the simulation of bacterial numbers over time with the use of a logistic differential equation.\n\nRemoval of Pb(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), and Zn(II) by hematite nanoparticles: effect of sorbent concentration, pH, temperature, and exhaustion.\n\nPubMed\n\nShipley, Heather J; Engates, Karen E; Grover, Valerie A\n\n2013-03-01\n\nNanoparticles offer the potential to improve environmental treatment technologies due to their unique properties. Adsorption of metal ions (Pb(II), Cd(II), Cu(II), Zn(II)) to nanohematite was examined as a function of sorbent concentration, pH, temperature, and exhaustion. Adsorption experiments were conducted with 0.05, 0.1, and 0.5 g/L nanoparticles in a pH 8 solution and in spiked San Antonio tap water. The adsorption data showed the ability of nanohematite to remove Pb, Cd, Cu, and Zn species from solution with adsorption increasing as the nanoparticle concentration increased. At 0.5 g/L nanohematite, 100 % Pb species adsorbed, 94 % Cd species adsorbed, 89 % Cu species adsorbed and 100 % Zn species adsorbed. Adsorption kinetics for all metals tested was described by a pseudo second-order rate equation with lead having the fastest rate of adsorption. The effect of temperature on adsorption showed that Pb(II), Cu(II), and Cd(II) underwent an endothermic reaction, while Zn(II) underwent an exothermic reaction. The nanoparticles were able to simultaneously remove multiple metals species (Zn, Cd, Pb, and Cu) from both a pH 8 solution and spiked San Antonio tap water. Exhaustion experiments showed that at pH 8, exhaustion did not occur for the nanoparticles but adsorption does decrease for Cd, Cu, and Zn species but not Pb species. The strong adsorption coupled with the ability to simultaneously remove multiple metal ions offers a potential remediation method for the removal of metals from water.\n\nWater temperature, specific conductance, pH, and dissolved-oxygen concentrations in the lower White River and the Puyallup River estuary, Washington, August-October 2002\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nEbbert, James C.\n\n2003-01-01\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey, Washington State Department of Ecology, and Puyallup Tribe of Indians monitored water temperature, specific conductance, pH, and dissolved-oxygen concentrations in the White River at river miles 4.9 and 1.8 from August until mid-October 2002. Water diverted from the White River upstream from the monitoring sites into Lake Tapps is returned to the river at river mile 3.6 between the two sites. The same characteristics were measured in a cross section of the Puyallup River estuary at river mile 1.5 during high and low tides in September 2002. In late August, maximum daily water temperatures in the White River of 21.1Â°C (degrees Celsius) at river mile 4.9 and 19.6Â°C at river mile 1.8 exceeded the water-quality standard of 18Â°C at both monitoring sites. In mid-September, maximum daily water temperatures at river mile 4.9 exceeded the standard on 5 days. From August 2-25, water temperatures at both monitoring sites were similar and little or no water was discharged from Lake Tapps to the White River. Increases in water temperature at river mile 1.8 in late September and early October were caused by the mixing of warmer water discharged from Lake Tapps with cooler water in the White River.Specific conductance in the White River usually was lower at river mile 1.8 than at river mile 4.9 because of mixing with water from Lake Tapps, which has a lower specific conductance. Maximum values of pH in the White River at river mile 4.9 often exceeded the upper limit of the water-quality standard, 8.5 pH units, from early September until mid-October, when turbidity decreased. The pH standard was not exceeded at river mile 1.8. Dissolved-oxygen concentrations in the White River were often lower at river mile 1.8 than at river mile 4.9 because of mixing with water discharged from Lake Tapps, which has lower dissolved-oxygen concentrations. The lowest concentration of dissolved oxygen observed was 7.9 mg/L (milligrams per liter) at river mile 1.8.

The objective of the present investigation was to optimize the temperature (60-90 Â°C), pH (3-7) and CaCl2 concentration (2Â·0-6Â·0 mm) for maximum yield/recovery of milk constituents. The research work was carried out in two phases. In 1st phase, the influence of these processing conditions was evaluated through 20 experiments formulated by central composite design (CCD) keeping the yield as response factor. The results obtained from these experiments were used to optimize processing conditions for maximum yield using response surface methodology (RSM). The three best combinations of processing conditions (90 Â°C, pH 7, CaCl2 6 mm), (100 Â°C, pH 5, CaCl2 4 mm) and (75 Â°C, pH 8Â·4, CaCl2 4 mm) were exploited in the next phase for Ricotta cheese production from a mixture of Buffalo cheese whey and skim milk (9 : 1) to determine the influence of optimized conditions on the cheese composition. Ricotta cheeses were analyzed for various physicochemical (moisture, fat, protein, lactose, total solids, pH and acidity indicated) parameters during storage of 60 d at 4 Â± 2 Â°C after every 15 d interval. Ricotta cheese prepared at 90 Â°C, pH 7 and CaCl2 6 mm exhibited the highest cheese yield, proteins and total solids, while high fat content was recorded for cheese processed at 100 Â°C, pH 5 and 4 mm CaCl2 concentration. A significant storage-related increase in acidity and NPN was recorded for all cheese samples.\n\nSperm motility in fishes. I. Effects of temperature and pH: a review.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlavi, Sayyed Mohammad Hadi; Cosson, Jacky\n\n2005-02-01\n\nSperm motility is a key factor in allowing us to determine semen quality and fertilizing capacity. Motility in semen is mainly controlled by K+ in salmonids, and probably also in sturgeons, and by osmotic pressure in other freshwater and seawater fish species, but other factors, such as concentration of surrounding metabolites and ions (Ca2+, Mg2+, etc.), pH and temperature also influence motility characteristics. In the present study, we have mainly reviewed and summarized the effects of temperature and pH on the motility of spermatozoa in three fish species: salmonids, cyprinids and sturgeons. Data in the literature show that motility, fertilizing ability and velocity of spermatozoa, as well as the duration of the motility period, depend on the temperature of the assay medium and also of that of the brood fish holding tank. In contrast, the pH of the swimming medium, and thus the intracellular pH of spermatozoa, has less influence on sperm motility parameters in cyprinids, salmonids and sturgeons.\n\nDetermining pH at elevated pressure and temperature using in situ Â¹Â³C NMR.\n\nPubMed\n\nSurface, J Andrew; Wang, Fei; Zhu, Yanzhe; Hayes, Sophia E; Giammar, Daniel E; Conradi, Mark S\n\n2015-02-03\n\nWe have developed an approach for determining pH at elevated pressures and temperatures by using (13)C NMR measurements of inorganic carbon species together with a geochemical equilibrium model. The approach can determine in situ pH with precision better than 0.1 pH units at pressures, temperatures, and ionic strengths typical of geologic carbon sequestration systems. A custom-built high pressure NMR probe was used to collect (13)C NMR spectra of (13)C-labeled CO2 reactions with NaOH solutions and Mg(OH)2 suspensions at pressures up to 107 bar and temperatures of 80 Â°C. The quantitative nature of NMR spectroscopy allows the concentration ratio [CO2]/[HCO3(-)] to be experimentally determined. This ratio is then used with equilibrium constants calculated for the specific pressure and temperature conditions and appropriate activity coefficients for the solutes to calculate the in situ pH. The experimentally determined [CO2]/[HCO3(-)] ratios agree well with the predicted values for experiments performed with three different concentrations of NaOH and equilibration with multiple pressures of CO2. The approach was then applied to experiments with Mg(OH)2 slurries in which the change in pH could track the dissolution of CO2 into solution, rapid initial Mg(OH)2 dissolution, and onset of magnesium carbonate precipitation.\n\nEffects of temperature, pH and NaCl on protease activity in digestive tract of young turbot, Scophthalmus maximus\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Muyan; Zhang, Xiumei; Gao, Tianxiang; Chen, Chao\n\n2006-09-01\n\nThe protease activity in digestive tract of young turbot Scophthalmus maximum was studied, and the optimal pH, temperature and NaCl concentration were determined for different portions of the fish's internal organs. The optimal activity in the fish's stomach was at pH of 2.2, while that in the intestinal extracts was within the alkaline range from 9.5 to 10.0. In hepatopancreas, the optimal pH was in low alkalinity at 8.5. The optimal reaction temperature was above 40Â°C in stomach, intestine and hepatopancreas. With increasing temperature, the pH value increased in stomach, while in the intestine, an opposite tendency was observed due to combined effect of pH and temperature. NaCl concentration showed inhibitory impact on protein digestion in hepatopancreas. The main protease for protein digestion in turbot seemed to be pepsin. Moreover, the maximum protease activity in different segments of intestine existed in the hindgut.\n\nThe effect of pH and buffer concentration on anode biofilms of Thermincola ferriacetica.\n\nPubMed\n\nLusk, Bradley G; Parameswaran, Prathap; Popat, Sudeep C; Rittmann, Bruce E; Torres, Cesar I\n\n2016-12-01\n\nWe assessed the effects of pH and buffer concentration on current production and growth of biofilms of Thermincola ferriacetica - a thermophilic, Gram-positive, anode-respiring bacterium (ARB) - grown on anodes poised at a potential of -0.06V vs. SHE in microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) at 60Â°C. T. ferriacetica generated current in the pH range of 5.2 to 8.3 with acetate as the electron donor and 50mM bicarbonate buffer. Maximum current density was reduced by ~80% at pH5.2 and ~14% at 7.0 compared to pH8.3. Increasing bicarbonate buffer concentrations from 10mM to 100mM resulted in an increase in the current density by 40Â±6%, from 6.8Â±1.1 to 11.2Â±2.7Am(-2), supporting that more buffer alleviated pH depression within T. ferriacetica biofilms. Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images indicated that higher bicarbonate buffer concentrations resulted in larger live biofilm thicknesses: from 68Â±20Î¼m at 10mM bicarbonate to >150Î¼m at 100mM, supporting that buffer availability was a strong influence on biofilm thickness. In comparison to mesophilic Geobacter sulfurreducens biofilms, the faster transport rates at higher temperature and the ability to grow at relatively lower pH allowed T. ferriacetica to produce higher current densities with lower buffer concentrations.

The beverages were divided into 4 groups: yogurt (GI) fermented milk (GII), chocolate-based products (GIII) and fermented dairy beverages (GIV). They were asked which type, flavor and temperature. The most popular beverages were selected, and these made up the sample. A pH meter Quimis 400A device was used to verify pH. The average pH from each beverage was calculated and submitted to statistical analysis (Variance and Tukey test with a 5% significance level). for groups I, II and III beverages, type x temperature interaction was significant, showing the pH averages were influenced by temperature variation. At iced temperatures, they presented lower pH values, which were considered statistically significant when compared to the values found for the same beverages at room temperature. All dairy beverages, with the exception of the chocolate-based type presented pH below critical level for enamel and present corrosive potential; as to ingestion temperature, iced temperature influenced pH reducing its values, in vitro.\n\nRaman spectroscopy of gold chloro-hydroxy speciation in fluids at ambient temperature and pressure: a re-evaluation of the effects of pH and chloride concentration\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMurphy, P. J.; LaGrange, M. S.\n\n1998-11-01\n\nPrevious work on gold chloride and hydroxide speciation in fluids has shown differences in opinion as to the relative importance of gold (I) and gold (III) species, as well as for the Raman peak assignments for the various species. In addition, previous experimental work has not been consistent with theoretical predictions either of the number or of the frequencies of the peaks in the Raman spectrum. In order to re-evaluate the effect of pH on Raman spectra and speciation, solutions containing gold (III) chloride were analysed by Raman spectroscopy at ambient temperature and pressure, over a range of pH from 1 to 11. Total gold concentrations were from 0.001 to 0.02 M, with total chloride concentrations of 0.004-0.5 M. The spectra obtained are consistent with the hydrolysis sequence of square-planar Au(III) complex ions [AuCl x(OH) 4-x] -, where x = 0-4. The Au-Cl stretching peaks obtained were 348/325 Rcm -1 for [AuCl 4] -, 348/335/325 Rcm -1 for [AuCl 3(OH)] -, 337/355 Rcm -1 for [AuCl 2(OH) 2] -, and 355 Rcm -1 for [AuCl(OH) 3] -. [Au(OH) 4] - probably occurred, alongside [AuCl(OH) 3] - at pH values above 11. A dark purplish-grey precipitate (Au(I)OH) formed at high pH values. No evidence for Au(I) species was found. The spectra are more consistent with theory than previous data and show the predicted number of peaks for Au-Cl and Au-OH stretches for each species. However, the peak frequencies do not fit precisely with the predictions of Tossell (1996), particularly for Au-OH stretches. Hydrolysis of the simple chloride species occurs at lower pH values than found previously, and both gold and chloride concentration were found to affect the pH ranges of stability for the various chloro-hydroxy species. Decreasing gold concentration resulted in hydrolysis occurring at lower pH values. This is especially important in the absence of excess chloride (Î£Cl = 4Î£Au). Substantial hydrolysis occurred below pH = 4 for 0.02 M Au /0.08 M Cl -, and below pH = 2 for 0.001 M\n\nEffect of pH and nitrite concentration on nitrite oxidation rate.\n\nPubMed\n\nJimÃ©nez, E; GimÃ©nez, J B; Ruano, M V; Ferrer, J; Serralta, J\n\n2011-10-01\n\nThe effect of pH and nitrite concentration on the activity of the nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in an activated sludge reactor has been determined by means of laboratory batch experiments based on respirometric techniques. The bacterial activity was measured at different pH and at different total nitrite concentrations (TNOâ). The experimental results showed that the nitrite oxidation rate (NOR) depends on the TNOâ concentration independently of the free nitrous acid (FNA) concentration, so FNA cannot be considered as the real substrate for NOB. NOB were strongly affected by low pH values (no activity was detected at pH 6.5) but no inhibition was observed at high pH values (activity was nearly the same for the pH range 7.5-9.95). A kinetic expression for nitrite oxidation process including switch functions to model the effect of TNOâ concentration and pH inhibition is proposed. Substrate half saturation constant and pH inhibition constants have been obtained. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Blaine\n\n2004-01-01\n\nDiel (24 hr) cycles in dissolved metal and As concentrations have been documented in many northern Rocky Mountain streams in the U.S.A. The cause(s) of the cycles are unknown, although temperature- and pH-dependent sorption reactions have been cited as likely causes. A light/dark experiment was conducted to isolate temperature and pH as variables affecting diel metal cycles in Prickly Pear Creek, Montana. Light and dark chambers containing sediment and a strand of macrophyte were placed in the stream to simulate instream temperature oscillations. Photosynthesis-induced pH changes were allowed to proceed in the light chambers while photosynthesis was prevented in the dark chambers. Water samples were collected periodically for 22 hr in late July 2001 from all chambers and the stream. In the stream, dissolved Zn concentrations increased by 300% from late afternoon to early morning, while dissolved As concentrations exhibited the opposite pattern, increasing 33% between early morning and late afternoon. Zn and As concentrations in the light chambers showed similar, though less pronounced, diel variations. Conversely, Zn and As concentrations in the dark chambers had no obvious diel variation, indicating that light, or light-induced reactions, caused the variation. Temperature oscillations were nearly identical between light and dark chambers, strongly suggesting that temperature was not controlling the diel variations. As expected, pH was negatively correlated (P < 0.01) with dissolved Zn concentrations and positively correlated with dissolved As concentrations in both the light and dark chambers. From these experiments, photosynthesis-induced pH changes were determined to be the major cause of the diel dissolved Zn and As cycles in Prickly Pear Creek. Further research is necessary in other streams to verify that this finding is consistent among streams having large differences in trace-element concentrations and mineralogy of channel substrate. ?? 2004 Kluwer\n\nDiurnal variation of intraoral pH and temperature.\n\nPubMed\n\nChoi, Jung Eun; Lyons, Karl M; Kieser, Jules A; Waddell, Neil J\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to measure continuously the intraoral pH and temperature of healthy individuals to investigate their diurnal variations. Seventeen participants (mean age, 31Â±9 years) wore a custom-made intraoral appliance fitted with a pH probe and thermocouple for two sets of 24âh, while carrying out normal daily activities including sleep. The continuous changes in intraoral pH and temperature were captured using a sensor placed on the palatal aspect of the upper central incisors. The collected data were categorised into different status (awake and sleep) and periods (morning, afternoon, evening and night). Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were conducted. The intraoral pH change was found to show a distinctive daily rhythm, showing a 12-h interval between maximum (7.73) and minimum (6.6) pH values. The maximum and minimum values were found to repeat after 24âh. The mean pH over 48âh (two sets of 24âh) was found to be 7.27 (Â±0.74). There was significant difference found in pH when subjects were awake and asleep and different periods during the day ( P <0.001). The mean intraoral temperature was 33.99âÂ°C (Â±4.9), with less distinctive daily rhythm compared with pH. There was a significant difference found in temperature depending on the time of the day, except between morning and afternoon ( P =0.78). Our results showed that there is a distinctive daily, circadian-like pattern in intraoral pH variation over a 24-h period, which has been considered as one of the risk factors in sleep-related dental diseases.\n\nFluoroquinolone resistance of Serratia marcescens: sucrose, salicylate, temperature, and pH induction of phenotypic resistance.\n\nPubMed\n\nBegic, Sanela; Worobec, Elizabeth A\n\n2007-11-01\n\nSerratia marcescens is a nosocomial agent with a natural resistance to a broad spectrum of antibiotics, making the treatment of its infections very challenging. This study examines the influence of salicylate, sucrose, temperature, and pH variability on membrane permeability and susceptibility of S. marcescens to norfloxacin (hydrophilic fluoroquinolone) and nalidixic acid (hydrophobic quinolone). Resistance of wild-type S. marcescens UOC-67 (ATCC 13880) to norfloxacin and nalidixic acid was assessed by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays after growth in the presence of various concentrations of sucrose and salicylate and different temperatures and pH values. Norfloxacin and nalidixic acid accumulation was determined in the absence and presence of (i) carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP), a proton-motive-force collapser, and (ii) Phe-Arg beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN), an efflux pump inhibitor. Accumulation of norfloxacin decreased when S. marcescens was grown in high concentrations of salicylate (8 mmol/L) and sucrose (10% m/v), at high temperature (42 degrees C), and at pH 6, and it was restored in the presence of CCCP because of the collapse of proton-gradient-dependent efflux in S. marcescens. Although nalidixic acid accumulation was observed, it was not affected by salicylate, sucrose, pH, or temperature changes. In the absence of PAbetaN, and either in the presence or absence of CCCP, a plateau was reached in the nalidixic acid accumulation for all environmental conditions. With the addition of 20 mg/L PAbetaN nalidixic acid accumulation is restored for all environmental conditions, suggesting that this quinolone is recognized by a yet to be identified S. marcescens pump that does not use proton motive force as its energy source.\n\nThe application of exhaled breath analysis in racing Thoroughbreds and the influence of high intensity exercise and ambient temperature on the concentration of carbon monoxide and pH in exhaled breath.\n\nPubMed\n\nCathcart, Michael P; Love, Sandy; Sutton, David G M; Reardon, Richard J M; Hughes, Kristopher J\n\n2013-08-01\n\nAnalyses of exhaled breath (EB) and exhaled breath condensate (EBC) are non-invasive modalities for assessing the lower airways but these methods have not been applied to Thoroughbred racehorses in training. The aims of this study were to determine whether EB and EBC could be obtained from Thoroughbred racehorses in the field and to investigate the effects of exercise per se and during different ambient temperatures and humidity on exhaled concentrations of nitric oxide (eNO), carbon monoxide (eCO) and EBC pH. EB and EBC samples were obtained from 28 Thoroughbred racehorses pre- and post-exercise during warm (n=23) and/or cold (n=19) ambient temperatures. eNO was detected in 19/84 EB samples. eCO was measured in 39/42 EB samples pre-exercise (median 1.3 ppm) and concentrations decreased significantly post-exercise (median 0.8 ppm, P<0.005) and were associated with ambient temperature. EBC pH was 4.51 Â± 0.23 pre-exercise and increased significantly post-exercise (4.79 Â± 0.59, P=0.003). The study documented the collection of EB and EBC from Thoroughbred racehorses in a field setting. Alterations in concentrations of volatile gases and EBC pH occurred in response to exercise, and were likely to have been influenced by environmental factors. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

It was our objective to investigate the ethanol-induced dissociation of micellar casein as affected by temperature and a wide range of pH, along with the concentrations of calcium and casein. Two different concentrations of casein micelles were dispersed in imidazole buffer with 0 to 80% ethanol (vol/vol) and 2 and 10 mM calcium. Apparent micelle size was determined by dynamic light scattering at 5, 30, and 60Â°C. In the absence of ethanol, casein precipitation occurred at pH 4.6 in imidazole buffer. Ten to forty percent ethanol promoted casein aggregation (>1,000 nm) and higher temperature (30 and 60Â°C) enhanced this effect. Higher ethanol concentrations at 50 to 80% induced the dissociation (<40 nm) of the casein micelle upon acidification (pH <5) and alkalization (pH >8) in imidazole buffer. In addition, higher concentrations of casein (0.25 mg/mL) and calcium (20 mM) caused the formation of larger aggregates (>1,000 nm) in the presence of ethanol when comparing with the initial lower concentrations of casein (0.1 mg/mL) and calcium (2 mM). Casein micelle dissociation can be achieved near the isoelectric pH by modifying the solvent composition and temperature.

Treated samples were analyzed for protein solubility, thermal stability, and aggregation in 0, 0.1, and 0.6 M NaCl solutions at pH 2.0-8.0. The pH(12) shifting resulted in drastic increases (up to 2.5-fold) in SPI solubility in the pH 6.0-7.0 range, especially at 0 M NaCl. The pH(1.5) shifting had a generally lesser effect on solubility. 11S exhibited a solubility pattern similar to that of SPI, but the solubility of 7S was unaffected by pH shifting except at 0.6 M NaCl. The pH shifting, notably at pH 12.0, produced soluble, disulfide-linked polymers from 11S and reduced (P < 0.05) its enthalpy but not its temperature of denaturation. Soy proteins structurally altered by pH shifting had a reduced sensitivity to thermal aggregation.\n\nEffect of pH and temperature on the uptake of cadmium by Lemna minor L\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChawla, G.; Singh, J.; Viswanathan, P.N.\n\n1991-07-01\n\nMany aquatic macrophytes have the capacity to take up toxic heavy metals from polluted water and accumulate them. Cut leaves and intact plants have been suggested for clearing polluted water bodies of heavy metals. However, uptake of metal ion from water is dependent on concentration, pH, temperature, presence of other substances and functional and morphological status of the biotic species. In an attempt to understand any correlation between metal bioconcentration, pH and temperature, the optimal conditions for the removal of cadmium ions by duckweed, Lemna minor (L.) were studied.\n\nSimultaneous wireless assessment of intra-oral pH and temperature.\n\nPubMed\n\nFarella, M; Loke, C; Sander, S; Songini, A; Allen, M; Mei, L; Cannon, R D\n\n2016-08-01\n\nIntra-oral pH plays an important role in the pathogenesis of tooth erosion and decay, but there is limited information about its variation in real life settings. The aims of this research were to: 1) develop a wireless device, which can be used to continuously monitor intra-oral pH and temperature in real-time; 2) test and validate the device under controlled laboratory conditions; and 3) collect data in a natural environment in a sample of healthy volunteers. A wireless device for measuring pH and temperature simultaneously was developed, calibrated and validated against the gold standard glass electrode pH meter. A smart phone was used as data logger. The wireless device was embedded in an oral appliance and worn by eleven participants (mean age 31.1Â±6.9years) for 24h, while conducting standardised drinking tasks and regular daily activities. The wireless device could accurately measure pH and temperature both in vitro and in vivo. The recovery time following the swallow of a standard acidic drink varied markedly among individuals (mean=1.3Â±0.9min). The intra-oral pH and temperature recorded in the natural environment also showed a large inter- and intra-individual variability. The average intra-oral pH when asleep (6.7Â±0.5) was lower (p<0.001) than when awake (7.2Â±0.5). The average intra-oral temperature during sleep (35.6Â±0.5Â°C) was higher (p<0.001) than when awake (34.5Â±0.7Â°C). Intra-oral pH and temperature can be continuously and wirelessly assessed in real-life settings, and show individual-specific patterns with circadian variations. Intra-oral pH becomes slightly acidic during sleep while intra-oral temperature increases and fluctuates less. We propose a wireless device that is capable of measuring intra-oral pH over a 24-h period. We found marked inter-individual variation after acidic stimuli, and day to sleep time variation of both intra-oral temperature and pH. Our approach may provide new insight into the relationship between oral pH, tooth\n\nCasein maps: effect of ethanol, pH, temperature, and CaCl2 on the particle size of reconstituted casein micelles.\n\nPubMed\n\nYe, Ran; Harte, Federico\n\n2013-02-01\n\nAlthough conditions favoring casein micelle aggregation are well known, factors promoting the dissociation of the casein micelle are not fully understood.

Such enzyme recovery was recently demonstrated using enzymogel nanoparticles with grafted polymer brushes loaded with cellulases. In this work, cellulase (NS50013) and Î²-glucosidase (Novozyme 188) were immobilized on enzymogels made of poly(acrylic acid) polymer brushes grafted to the surface of silica nanoparticles. Response surface methodology was used to model effects of pH and temperature on hydrolysis and recovery of free and attached enzymes. Hydrolysis yields using both enzymogels and free cellulase and Î²-glucosidase were highest at the maximum temperature tested, 50Â Â°C. The optimal pH for cellulase enzymogels and free enzyme was 5.0 and 4.4, respectively, while both free Î²-glucosidase and enzymogels had an optimal pH near 4.4. Highest hydrolysis sugar concentrations with cellulase and Î²-glucosidase enzymogels were 69 and 53Â % of those with free enzymes, respectively. Enzyme recovery using enzymogels decreased with increasing pH, but cellulase recovery remained greater than 88Â % throughout the operating range of pH values less than 5.0 and was greater than 95Â % at pH values below 4.3. Recovery of Î²-glucosidase enzymogels was not affected by temperature and had little impact on cellulase recovery.\n\nTime-related Changes in pH, Buffering Capacity and Phosphate and Urea Concentration of Stimulated Saliva.\n\nPubMed\n\nVuletic, Lea; Peros, Kristina; Spalj, Stjepan; Rogic, Dunja; Alajbeg, Ivan\n\n2014-01-01\n\nTo quantify changes in pH, buffering capacity and hydrogen carbonate, phosphate, protein and urea concentrations of stimulated saliva which occur during a 30-min measurement delay after saliva collection. The correlation between time-related chemical changes and changes of salivary pH and buffering capacity was assessed in order to explain the observed changes in salivary pH and buffering capacity. Stimulated saliva samples were collected from 30 volunteers after inducing salivation by chewing a piece of parafilm. Measurements of salivary variables were made immediately after saliva collection and again 30 min later, during which time the specimens were exposed to the atmosphere in collection cups at room temperature. Postponement of measurements resulted in a significant increase in pH and a significant decrease of buffering capacity, phosphate and urea concentration. The results suggest that the time-related pH increase could primarily be attributed to loss of dissolved carbon dioxide from saliva, and confirm the importance of hydrogen carbonate in the neutralisation of hydrogen ions, but they do not support the principle of catalysed phase-buffering for the hydrogen carbonate buffer system in saliva. A decrease in phosphate and urea concentration affects salivary buffering capacity. This study emphasises the importance of the standardisation of measurement time when measuring salivary pH, buffering capacity, phosphate and urea concentrations following the collection of saliva in order to obtain comparable results. It also provides a partial explanation of the mechanisms underlying the observed changes of pH and buffering capacity over time.\n\nEffect of chelators on functionality of milk protein concentrates obtained by ultrafiltration at a constant pH and temperature.\n\nPubMed\n\nRamchandran, Lata; Luo, XiaoXia; Vasiljevic, Todor\n\n2017-11-01\n\nModulating conditions during ultrafiltration of skim milk appears to be a feasible strategy to obtain milk protein concentrates (MPC) with tailored functionalities. Adjustment of pH and process temperature attenuated properties of casein micelle resulting in enhanced emulsification capacity. Additional pre-treatment options such as addition of calcium chelators can further impact on the functionality of MPC by modifying the calcium distribution and casein micelle integrity. The objective of the project was to establish effects of pre-treating skim milk with calcium chelators (EDTA or citrate) in concentrations between 10 to 30 mm prior to UF on the physical properties of the feed, corresponding retentates and dried MPC, including particle size, zeta potential and calcium distribution in skim milk and the corresponding retentates, as well as the physical functionalities such as solubility, heat stability and emulsifying properties. Addition of calcium chelators (EDTA or citrate), at levels 20-30 mm concentrations reduced casein micelle size as well as total, soluble and ionic calcium contents that resulted in MPC with enhanced solubility and heat stability. The emulsion capacity was, however, improved only with EDTA at 10 mm concentration. The enhanced functionality is attributed to the reduced particle size resulting from the removal of calcium from the retentate that could modify micellar casein to an extent sufficient to cause such improvements.\n\nThe Effect of Temperature and Solution pH on Tetragonal Lysozyme Nucleation Kinetics\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJudge, Russell A.; Jacobs, Randolph S.; Frazier, Tyralynn; Snell, Edward H.; Pusey, Marc L.\n\n1998-01-01\n\nPart of the challenge of macromolecular crystal growth for structure determination is obtaining an appropriate number of crystals with a crystal volume suitable for x-ray analysis. In this respect an understanding of the effect of solution conditions on macromolecule nucleation rates is advantageous. This study investigated the effects of supersaturation, temperature and pH on the nucleation rate of tetragonal lysozyme crystals. Batch crystallization plates were prepared at given solution concentrations and incubated at set temperatures over one week. The number of crystals per well with their size and axial ratios were recorded and correlated with solution conditions, Duplicate experiments indicate the reproducibility of the technique, Crystal numbers were found to increase with increasing supersaturation and temperature. The most significant variable however, was pH, where crystal numbers changed by two orders of magnitude over the pH range 4.0 to 5.2. Crystal size varied also with solution conditions, with the largest crystals being obtained at pH 5.2. Having optimized the crystallization conditions, a batch of crystals were prepared under exactly the same conditions and fifty of these crystals were analyzed by x-ray techniques. The results indicate that even under the same crystallization conditions, a marked variation in crystal properties exists.\n\n21 CFR 868.1170 - Indwelling blood hydrogen ion concentration (pH) analyzer.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2011-04-01 2011-04-01 false Indwelling blood hydrogen ion concentration (pH...

In this study batch experiments were carried out to evaluate the relative affinity of a range of relevant organic pollutants to Oasis HLB in aqueous systems. The influence of sorbate concentration, temperature, pH, and salinity on the equilibrium sorption was investigated. Equilibrium partition ratios (K D ) of 28 compounds were determined, ranging over three orders of magnitude from 1.16Â ÃÂ 10 3 Â L/kg (atenolol) to 1.07Â ÃÂ 10 6 Â L/kg (isoproturon). The Freundlich model was able to describe the equilibrium partitioning to Oasis HLB, and an analysis of the thermodynamic parameters revealed the spontaneous and exothermic nature of the partitioning process. Ionic strength had only a minor effect on the partitioning, whereas pH had a considerable effect but only for ionizable compounds. The results show that apolar interactions between the Oasis HLB and analyte mainly determine the equilibrium partitioning. These research findings can be used to optimize the application of SPE and POCIS for analyses of environmental contaminants even in complex mixtures. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

Experiments were carried out in concentrated grape juice inoculated with Z.Â rouxii at isothermal conditions (23Â Â°C) for 60 days. pH was the variable with the highest effect on growth parameters (potential maximum growth rate and lag phase duration), although the effect of sugar concentration were also significant. In a second experiment, the time for spoilage by this microorganism in concentrated grape juice was evaluated at isothermal (23Â Â°C) and non-isothermal conditions, in an effort to reproduce standard storage and overseas shipping temperature conditions, respectively. Results show that pH was again the environmental factor with the highest impact on delaying the spoilage of the product. Thereby, a pH value below 2.0 was enough to increase the shelf life of the product for more than 60 days in both isothermal and non-isothermal conditions. The information obtained in the present work could be used by producers and buyers to predict the growth and time for spoilage of Z.Â rouxii in concentrated grape juice.

A.; Payne, J.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe pH of a habitat is essential to an organism's growth and success in its environment. Although most organisms maintain a neutral internal pH, their environmental pH can vary greatly. However, little research has been done concerning an organism's environmental pH across a wide range of taxa. We studied pH tolerance in prokaryotes and its relationship with biovolume, taxonomic classification, and ideal temperature. We had three hypotheses: pH and temperature are not correlated; pH tolerance is similar within taxonomic groups; and extremophiles have small cell sizes. To test these hypotheses, we used pH, size, and taxonomic data from The Prokaryotes. We found that the mean optimum external pH was neutral for prokaryotes as a whole and when divided by domain, phylum, and class. Using ANOVA to test for pH within and among group variances, we found that variation of pH in domains, phyla, classes, and families was greater than between them. pH and size did not show much of a correlation, except that the largest and smallest sized prokaryotes had nearly neutral pH. This seems significant because extremophiles need to divert more of their energy from growth to maintain a neutral internal pH. Acidophiles showed a larger range of optimum pH values than alkaliphiles. A similar result was seen with the minimum and maximum pH values of acidophiles and alkaliphiles. While acidophiles were spread out and had some alkaline maximum values, alkaliphiles had smaller ranges, and unlike some acidophiles that had pH minimums close to zero, alkaliphile pH maximums did not go beyond a pH of 12. No statistically significant differences were found between sizes of acidophiles and alkaliphiles. However, optimum temperatures of acidophiles and alkaliphiles did have a statistically significant difference. pH and temperature had a negative correlation. Therefore, pH seems to have a correlation with cell size, temperature, and taxonomy to some extent.\n\nLactic acid fermentation from food waste with indigenous microbiota: Effects of pH, temperature and high OLR.\n\nPubMed\n\nTang, Jialing; Wang, Xiaochang; Hu, Yisong; Zhang, Yongmei; Li, Yuyou\n\n2016-06-01\n\nThe effects of pH, temperature and high organic loading rate (OLR) on lactic acid production from food waste without extra inoculum addition were investigated in this study. Using batch experiments, the results showed that although the hydrolysis rate increased with pH adjustment, the lactic acid concentration and productivity were highest at pH 6. High temperatures were suitable for solubilization but seriously restricted the acidification processes. The highest lactic acid yield (0.46g/g-TS) and productivity (278.1mg/Lh) were obtained at 37Â°C and pH 6. In addition, the lactic acid concentration gradually increased with the increase in OLR, and the semi-continuous reactor could be stably operated at an OLR of 18g-TS/Ld. However, system instability, low lactic acid yield and a decrease in VS removal were noticed at high OLRs (22g-TS/Ld). The concentrations of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) in the fermentation mixture were relatively low but slightly increased with OLR, and acetate was the predominant VFA component. Using high-throughput pyrosequencing, Lactobacillus from the raw food waste was found to selectively accumulate and become dominant in the semi-continuous reactor. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

If DMI enters the aquatic environment, it can be transformed by the environmental bacteria or UV radiation. Therefore, photolysis of DMI in water was performed using a simulated sunlight Xenon-lamp and a UV-lamp. Subsequently, the biodegradability of DMI and its photo-transformation products (PTPs) formed during its UV photolysis was studied. The influence of variable conditions, such as initial DMI concentration, solution pH, and temperature, on DMI UV photolysis behavior was also studied. The degree of mineralization of DMI and its PTPs was monitored. A Shimadzu HPLC-UV apparatus was used to follow the kinetic profile of DMI during UV-irradiation; after that, ion-trap and high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with chromatography were used to monitor and identify the possible PTPs. The environmentally relevant properties and selected toxicity properties of DMI and the non-biodegradable PTPs were predicted using different QSAR models. DMI underwent UV photolysis with first-order kinetics. Quantum yields were very low. DOC values indicated that DMI formed new PTPs and was not completely mineralized. Analysis by means of high-resolution mass spectrometry revealed that the photolysis of DMI followed three main photolysis pathways: isomerization, hydroxylation, and ring opening. The photolysis rate was inversely proportional to initial DMI concentration. The pH showed a significant impact on the photolysis rate of DMI, and on the PTPs in terms of both formation kinetics and mechanisms. Although temperature was expected to increase the photolysis rate, it showed a non-significant impact in this study. Results from biodegradation tests and QSAR analysis revealed that DMI and its PTPs are not readily biodegradable and that some PTPs may be human and/or eco\n\nEffects of pH and Temperature on Recombinant Manganese Peroxidase Production and Stability\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJiang, Fei; Kongsaeree, Puapong; Schilke, Karl; Lajoie, Curtis; Kelly, Christine\n\nThe enzyme manganese peroxidase (MnP) is produced by numerous white-rot fungi to overcome biomass recalcitrance caused by lignin. MnP acts directly on lignin and increases access of the woody structure to synergistic wood-degrading enzymes such as cellulases and xylanases. Recombinant MnP (rMnP) can be produced in the yeast Pichia pastoris Î±MnP1-1 in fed-batch fermentations. The effects of pH and temperature on recombinant manganese peroxidase (rMnP) production by P. pastoris Î±MnP1-1 were investigated in shake flask and fed-batch fermentations. The optimum pH and temperature for a standardized fed-batch fermentation process for rMnP production in P. pastoris ctMnP1-1 were determined to be pH 6 and 30 Â°C, respectively. P. pastoris Î±MnP1-1 constitutively expresses the manganese peroxidase (mnp1) complementary DNA from Phanerochaete chrysosporium, and the rMnP has similar kinetic characteristics and pH activity and stability ranges as the wild-type MnP (wtMnP). Cultivation of P. chrysosporium mycelia in stationary flasks for production of heme peroxidases is commonly conducted at low pH (pH 4.2). However, shake flask and fed-batch fermentation experiments with P. pastoris Î±MnP1-1 demonstrated that rMnP production is highest at pH 6, with rMnP concentrations in the medium declining rapidly at pH less than 5.5, although cell growth rates were similar from pH 4-7. Investigations of the cause of low rMnP production at low pH were consistent with the hypothesis that intracellular proteases are released from dead and lysed yeast cells during the fermentation that are active against rMnP at pH less than 5.5.\n\nThe Effect of Temperature and Solution pH on the Nucleation of Tetragonal Lysozyme Crystals\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nJudge, Russell A.; Jacobs, Randolph S.; Frazier, Tyralynn; Snell, Edward H.; Pusey, Marc L.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nPart of the challenge of macromolecular crystal growth for structure determination is obtaining crystals with a volume suitable for x-ray analysis.

This is important in the production of second generation biofuels among other biotechnological applications. In this investigation, bacteria isolated from sugarcane bagasse were identified as strains of Enterobacter xiangfangensis , Serratia rubidaea , Klebsiella pneumoniae and a novel species of Citrobacter designated Citrobacter sp. UWIBGS10. The glucose production potential of these strains was studied on thermally and solvent pretreated sugarcane bagasse. This was performed at 24-hour intervals up to 168 hours in the range of pH 5-9 and temperature range 25-40 Â°C. Maximal concentrations of glucose for Citrobacter sp. UWIBGS10 occurred at pH 6 and 25 Â°C. For E. xiangfangensis , S. rubidaea , K. pneumoniae glucose concentrations were consistent across the pH and temperature ranges examined. From these results it could be concluded that the bacteria demonstrated ability for lignocellulolytic hydrolysis for the production of glucose and could be further explored for the characterization of commercial cellulolytic enzymes.\n\nHYDROXYL RADICAL/OZONE RATIOS DURING OZONATION PROCESSES.

The technique provides amino modified Mn-doped ZnS QDs as fluorescent supports, 4-vinylphenylbronic acid as a covalent monomer, N-isopropyl acrylamide as a thermo-responsive monomer in combination with acrylamide as a non-covalent monomer, and glycosyl moiety of a glycopeptide antibiotic as a template to produce fluorescent molecularly imprinted polymer (FMIP) in aqueous solution. The FMIP can alter its functional moieties and structure with pH and temperature stimulation. This allows recognition of target molecules through control of pH and temperature. The fluorescence intensity of the FMIP was enhanced gradually as the concentration of telavancin increased, and showed selective recognition toward the target glycopeptide antibiotic preferentially among other antibiotics. Using the FMIP as a sensing material, good linear correlations were obtained over the concentration range of 3.0-300.0Î¼g/L and with a low limit of detection of 1.0Î¼g/L. The analysis results of telavancin in real samples were consistent with that obtained by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This paper describes the fabrication and performances of a temperature and a pH sensor on a biocompatible and wearable board for healthcare applications. The temperature sensor was based on a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) layer that changed its electrical resistivity with the temperature. When tested in a human serum sample between 25 and 43Â°C, the sensor had a sensitivity of 110Â±10Î©/Â°C and an error of 0.4Â±0.1Â°C compared with the reference value set in a thermostatic bath. The pH sensor, based on a graphene oxide (GO) sensitive layer, had a sensitivity of 40Â±4mV/pH in the pH range between 4 and 10. Five sensor prototypes were tested in a human serum sample over one week and the maximum deviation of the average response from reference values obtained by a glass electrode was 0.2pH units. For biological applications, the temperature and pH sensors were successfully tested for in vitro cytotoxicity with human fibroblast cells (MRC-5) over 24h. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The coliform bacteria are modeled using a first-order decay (death) rate, which is a function of the local salinity, temperature, and daily solar radiation. The pH is computed by solving a set of chemical-equilibrium equations for carbonate-bicarbonate buffered aqueous solutions. Concentrations of total- and fecal-coliform bacteria computed by the model for the Duwamish River estuary during June-September 1971 generally agreed with observed concentrations within about 40 and 60 percent, respectively. The computed pH generally agreed with observed pH within about a 0.2 pH unit; however, for one 3-week period the computed pH was about a 0.4 unit lower than the observed pH.

Postmortem pH45min (pH at 45 min postmortem or initial pH) via analysis of Pearsonâs correlation showed high positive correlation with pH change pHc24 (pH change from pH45min to pH24h postmortem). However, postmortem pH after 24 h (pH24h or ultimate pH) had a high negative correlation with pH change, pHc24, CIE L*, and protein content. Initial temperature postmortem (T1h ) was positively associated with a change in temperature from 45 min to 24 h postmortem (Tc24) and cooking loss, but negatively correlated with water holding capacity. Temperature at 24 h postmortem (T24h) was negatively associated with Tc24. Collectively, these results indicate that higher initial pH was associated with higher pHc24, T1h, and Tc24. However, higher initial pH was associated with a reduction in carcass weight, backfat thickness, CIE a* and b*, water holding capacity, collagen and fat content, drip loss, and cooking loss as well as decreased shear force. In contrast, CIE a* and b*, drip loss, cooking loss, and shear force in higher ultimate pH was showed by a similar pattern to higher initial pH, whereas pHc24, carcass weight, backfat thickness, water holding capacity, fat content, moisture content, protein content, T1h, T24h, and Tc24 were exhibited by completely differential patterns (p<0.05). Therefore, we suggest that initial pH, ultimate pH, and temperatures postmortem are important factors in determining the meat quality of pork.

A total of 71 examples of artificial tear preparations were identified in a search of Vademecum 2014 and the Spanish Medicines Agency website. In the 24 artificial tear products containing phosphates, quantification of these was performed by ultraviolet molecular absorption spectrophotometry, and the determination of pH was performed using scan image analysis algorithms of pH strips. Of the 71 artificial tears tested, 24 contained phosphate among their excipients in the data sheet, three of which had a concentration level below detection limit (<0.1mM). The mean phosphate concentration was 17.91Â±23.87mM. The artificial tear sample containing a higher concentration was Colircusi Humectante (87.1mM). Lubricants based on hypromellose showed the highest phosphate concentration (41.59Â±32.1mM), showing statistically significant differences compared to povidone (P=.0196) and hyaluronate (P=.0067). Statistically significant differences were found between products containing preservatives (32.39Â±20.91mM), and preservative free ones (8.49Â±11.98mM) (P=.0498). However, no difference was found between multidose (20.21Â±26.91mM) and unidose (9.31Â±14.39mM) samples, or between brand name (15.44Â±23.3mM) and generic eye drops (20.81mM). The mean pH was 6.93Â±0.26 (6.2-7.22). No statistical correlation was detected between phosphate concentration and pH (Spearman's Rho -0.1089 and P=.6125). A total of 24 (33.8%) of the 71 artificial tears contained phosphate. We believe identifying the phosphate concentration of artificial tears is useful information in order to avoid complications in high-risk patients. Copyright Â© 2016.

The calorimetric signals obtained were fitted to a mass action model description of aggregation using a previously reported analytical procedure (Patterson et al., Langmuir 13 (1997) 2219). The presence of a central ethylene diamine moiety in the molecular structure renders the T701 molecule basic; this was confirmed and measured by acid/base titration. Basicity is shown to have an important impact upon aggregation. At low pH (2.5), the poloxamine exists in its protonated form and the bulk solution proton concentration is sufficient to suppress de-protonation, aggregation-as a consequence-is shifted to a higher temperature range. Any increase in pH reduces the temperature range over which aggregation occurs. The derived experimental calorimetric parameters, obtained from model fitting procedures, can be used to compute the fraction of poloxamine existing in an aggregated form, at any particular temperature. The data sets obtained were interpolated to show that at human body temperature (310.6 K) the fraction of poloxamine found in its aggregated form is zero at a pH of 2.5. However at a pH of 6.8, the percentage aggregation increases to about 85%. These aggregation characteristics of T701 have important implications for the design of drug delivery systems, which incorporate poloxamines.\n\nModeling carbon dioxide effect in a controlled atmosphere and its interactions with temperature and pH on the growth of L.Â monocytogenes and P.Â fluorescens.\n\nPubMed\n\nCouvert, Olivier; GuÃ©gan, StÃ©phanie; HÃ©zard, Bernard; Huchet, VÃ©ronique; Lintz, Adrienne; Thuault, Dominique; Stahl, ValÃ©rie\n\n2017-12-01\n\nThe effect of carbon dioxide, temperature, and pH on growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Pseudomonas fluorescens was studied, following a protocol to monitor microbial growth under a constant gas composition. In this way, the CO 2 dissolution didn't modify the partial pressures in the gas phase. Growth curves were acquired at different temperatures (8, 12, 22 and 37Â Â°C), pH (5.5 and 7) and CO 2 concentration in the gas phase (0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100% of the atmospheric pressure, and over 1Â bar). These three factors greatly influenced the growth rate of L.Â monocytogenes and P.Â fluorescens, and significant interactions have been observed between the carbon dioxide and the temperature effects. Results showed no significant effect of the CO 2 concentration at 37Â Â°C, which may be attributed to low CO2 solubility at high temperature. An inhibitory effect of CO 2 appeared at lower temperatures (8 and 12Â Â°C). Regardless of the temperature, the gaseous CO 2 is sparingly soluble at acid pH. However, the CO 2 inhibition was not significantly different between pH 5.5 and pH 7. Considering the pKa of the carbonic acid, these results showed the dissolved carbon under HCO 3 - form didn't affect the bacterial inhibition. Finally, a global model was proposed to estimate the growth rate vs. CO 2 concentration in the aqueous phase. This dissolved concentration is calculated according to the physical equations related to the CO 2 equilibriums, involving temperature and pH interactions. This developed model is a new tool available to manage the food safety of MAP. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

If designed properly, the subsurface rock formations will lead this water back to the extraction well as heated brine. Proper monitoring of these geothermal reservoirs is essential for developing and maintaining the necessary level of productivity of the field. Chemical tracers are commonly used to characterize the fracture network and determine the connectivity between the injection and production wells. Currently, most tracer experiments involve injecting the tracer at the injection well, manually collecting liquid samples at the wellhead of the production well, and sending the samples off for laboratory analysis. While this method provides accurate tracer concentration data at very low levels of detection, it does not provide information regarding the location of the fractures which were conducting the tracer between wellbores. Sandia is developing a high-temperature electrochemical sensor capable of measuring tracer concentrations and pH downhole on a wireline tool. The goal of this effort is to collect real-time pH and ionic tracer concentration data at temperatures up to 225 Â°C and pressures up to 3000 psi. In this paper, a prototype electrochemical sensor and the initial data obtained will be presented detailing the measurement of iodide tracer concentrations at high temperature and pressure in a newly developed laboratory scale autoclave.\n\nThe Influence of Tablet Formulation, Drug Concentration, and pH Modification on the Stability of Extemporaneously Compounded Levothyroxine Suspensions.\n\nPubMed\n\nSvirskis, Darren; Lin, Shao-Wei; Brown, Helen; Sangaroomthong, Annie; Shin, Daniel; Wang, Ziqi; Xu, Hongtao; Dean, Rebecca; Vareed, Preetika; Jensen, Maree; Wu, Zimei\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThree brands of levothyroxine tablets are currently available in New Zealand (Eltroxin, Mercury Pharma, Synthroid) for extemporaneous compounding into suspensions. This study aims to determine whether tablet brand (i.e., formulation), concentration, storage conditions, as well as pH, impact the stability of compounded levothyroxine suspensions. Using the three available brands of levothyroxine tablets, suspensions were compounded at concentrations of 15 Âµg/mL and 25 Âµg/mL and stored at 4Â°C and 22Â°C. Samples were withdrawn weekly for 4 weeks, and chemical stability was evaluated using high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis. Physical appearance, ease of resuspension, and pH were also monitored weekly. To evaluate the effect on drug stability, pH modifiers were added to a suspension. As demonstrated by high-performance liquid chromatographic analysis, the suspensions compounded from the Eltroxin and Mercury Pharma tablets were more stable (>90% remaining after 4 weeks) than Synthroid across both storage conditions and concentrations. The drug was more stable at the higher concentration of 25 Âµg/mL than at 15 Âµg/mL. Levothyroxine was stable when pH was increased to pH 8 through the addition of sodium citrate; stability was reduced at a lower pH. Storage temperature did not affect the stability of the suspensions during the 4-week study. This is the first study demonstrating the impact of tablet brand, with different excipients, and drug concentrations on stability, and thus the beyond-use date of the compounded levothyroxine liquid formulations. The pH control achieved by sodium citrate, either as an excipient in tablets or an additive during compounding, improved drug stability.

Determining the sporulation environmental boundaries could contribute to identify potential sporulation niches. Spore formation was determined in a Sporulation Mineral Buffer. The effect of incubation temperature, pH and water activity on time to one spore per mL, maximum sporulation rate and final spore concentration was investigated for a Bacillus weihenstephanensis and a Bacillus licheniformis strain. Sporulation boundaries of B. weihenstephanensis and of B. licheniformis were similar to, or included within, the range of temperatures, pH and water activities supporting growth. For instance, sporulation boundaries of B. weihenstephanensis were evaluated at 5Â°C, 35Â°C, pH 5.2 and a(w) 0.960 while growth boundaries were observed at 5Â°C, 37Â°C, pH 4.9 and a(w) 0.950. Optimum spore formation was determined at 30Â°C pH 7.2 for B. weihenstephanensis and at 45Â°C pH 7.2 for B. licheniformis. Lower temperatures and pH delayed the sporulation process. For instance, the time to one spore per mL was tenfold longer when sporulation occurred at 10Â°C and 20Â°C, for each strain respectively, than at optimum sporulation temperature. The relative effect of temperature and pH on sporulation rates and on growth rates is similar. This work suggests that the influence of environmental factors on the quantitative changes in sporulation boundaries and rates was similar to their influence on changes in growth rate.

Phosphorus circulation activity is an index of soil's ability to supply soluble phosphorus from organic phosphorus in the soil solution. To understand the relationship among phosphorus circulation activity; bacterial biomass; pH; and Fe, Al, and Ca concentrations (described as mineral concentration in this paper) in agricultural soil, 232 soil samples from various agricultural fields were collected and analyzed.
