Indianapolis White Castle Entry is not about the food, but could use an update. Current photo? What is the status of the building? Who has used it since 2011? Flanner House Entry needs an expanded lead. Section on Cleo’s Bodega needs citations. 2022 United States infant formula shortage Entry mentions that Indianapolis is a \"Nestlé distribution hub,\" but that's probably Anderson, Indiana. The entry for Nestlé does not mention its hubs. Indiana State Fair Entry states that Indiana was the 6th state to establish an \"agricultural fair\"--needs citation. Entry does not describe role of agriculture in more recent iterations of the fair. National FFA Organization Entry is in good shape, but mentions that convention will be held in Indianapolis until 2024. That can be updated to 2031. * https://www.ibj.com/articles/71668-indianapolis-wins-bid-to-host-ffa-convention-through-2031 Corteva Stub.
