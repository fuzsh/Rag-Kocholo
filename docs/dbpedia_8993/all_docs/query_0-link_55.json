Estimates of fluid-inclusion homogenization temperature and density can be obtained using a petrographic microscope with thin sections, and they can be refined using heating and freezing stages. Fluid inclusion studies, used in conjunction with paragenetic studies, can provide direct data on the time and space variations of parameters such as temperature, pressure, density, and composition of fluids in geologic environments. Changes in these parameters directly affect the fugacity, composition, and pH of fluids, thus directly influencing localization of ore metals. ?? 1977 Ferdinand Enke Verlag Stuttgart.\n\nThe Cocos Ridge hydrothermal system revealed by microthermometry of fluid and melt inclusions\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBrandstÃ¤tter, J.; Kurz, W.; Krenn, K.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nMicrothermometric analyses of fluid and melt inclusions in hydrothermal veins and in the Cocos Ridge (CCR) basalt were used to reveal the CCR thermal history at IODP Site 344-U1414 and to constrain fluid source and flow. Hydrothermal veins are hosted by lithified sediments and CCR basalt . Site 344-U1414, located 1 km seaward of the Middle American Trench offshore Costa Rica, serves to evaluate fluid/rock interaction, the hydrologic system and geochemical processes linked with the tectonic evolution of the incoming Cocos Plate from the Early Miocene up to recent times. The veins in the sedimentary rocks are mainly filled by blocky calcite, containing numerous fluid inclusions, and sometimes crosscut fibrous quartz/chalcedony veins. The veins in the basalt can be differentiated into three types: antitaxial fibrous calcite veins, composite veins with fibrous calcite and clay minerals at the vein margins and spherulitic quartz in the center, and syntaxial blocky aragonite veins surrounded by a clay selvage in the uppermost CCR basalt sections. Secondary minerals, clay minerals, fibrous calcite, quartz/chalcedony and pyrite also filled vesicles in the basalt. Fluid inclusions were mainly found in the aragonite veins and rarely in quartz in the composite veins and vesicles. Blocky veins with embedded wall rock fragments appear in the sediments and in the basalt indicate hydraulic fracturing. The occurrence of decrepitated fluid inclusions show high homogenization temperatures up to 400 Â°C. Decrepitated fluid inclusions are formed by increased internal overpressure, related to isobaric heating. Elongated fluid inclusion planes, arc-like fluid inclusions and low homogenization temperatures indicate subsequent isobaric cooling. The results obtained so far from Raman spectroscopy and microthermometry indicate CO2 inclusions and petrographic observations suggest the presence of silicate melt inclusions in phenocrysts in the basalt (mainly in clinopyroxene and plagioclase\n\nAqSo_NaCl: Computer program to calculate p-T-V-x properties in the H2O-NaCl fluid system applied to fluid inclusion research and pore fluid calculation\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBakker, Ronald J.\n\n2018-06-01\n\nThe program AqSo_NaCl has been developed to calculate pressure - molar volume - temperature - composition (p-V-T-x) properties, enthalpy, and heat capacity of the binary H2O-NaCl system. The algorithms are designed in BASIC within the Xojo programming environment, and can be operated as stand-alone project with Macintosh-, Windows-, and Unix-based operating systems. A series of ten self-instructive interfaces (modules) are developed to calculate fluid inclusion properties and pore fluid properties. The modules may be used to calculate properties of pure NaCl, the halite-liquidus, the halite-vapourus, dew-point and bubble-point curves (liquid-vapour), critical point, and SLV solid-liquid-vapour curves at temperatures above 0.1 Â°C (with halite) and below 0.1 Â°C (with ice or hydrohalite). Isochores of homogeneous fluids and unmixed fluids in a closed system can be calculated and exported to a.txt file. Isochores calculated for fluid inclusions can be corrected according to the volumetric properties of quartz. Microthermometric data, i.e. dissolution temperatures and homogenization temperatures, can be used to calculated bulk fluid properties of fluid inclusions. Alternatively, in the absence of total homogenization temperature the volume fraction of the liquid phase in fluid inclusions can be used to obtain bulk properties.\n\nCharacterization of fluid inclusions from mineralized pegmatites of the Damara Belt, Namibia: insight into late-stage fluid evolution and implications for mineralization\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nAshworth, Luisa; Kinnaird, Judith Ann; Nex, Paul Andrew Martin; Erasmus, Rudolph Marthinus; PrzybyÅowicz, Wojciech JÃ³zef\n\n2018-05-01\n\nMineralized NYF and LCT pegmatites occur throughout the northeast-trending Neoproterozoic Damara Belt, Namibia. Mineralization in the pegmatites varies geographically, from the northeast, where they are enriched in Li-Be, to the southwest, where they also contain notable Sn and U. Similar fluid inclusion populations occur throughout the pegmatites, regardless of their respective metal enrichments, and primary fluid inclusion textures were destroyed by continued fluid activity. Pseudosecondary to secondary inclusions are aqueo-carbonic, carbonic, and aqueous in composition, and have been divided into five types. The earliest populations are saline (>26.3 eq. wt.% NaCl), homogenizing at temperatures in excess of 300 Â°C. Their carbonic phase is composed of CO2, with minor CH4, and micro-elemental mapping indicates they contain trace metals, including Ca, Fe, Zn, Cu, and K. Type 3 inclusions formed later, homogenize at 325 Â°C, and are less saline, with a carbonic phase composed of CO2. Type 4 carbonic inclusions are composed of pure CO2, and represent the latest stages of fluid evolution, while Type 5 aqueous inclusions are believed to be unrelated to the crystallization of the pegmatites, and rather the result of regional Cretaceous magmatism, or the ingress of meteoric water. The similarities in fluid inclusion populations observed in the pegmatites suggest that differences in mineralization were driven by magma composition rather than fluid activity alone, however saline fluids facilitated the enrichment and deposition of metals during the late stages of crystallization. Furthermore, the similarities between fluid inclusion populations in different pegmatites suggests they share a similar fluid evolution.\n\nHydrothermal Fluid evolution in the Dalli porphyry Cu-Au Deposit: Fluid Inclusion microthermometry studies\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlireza Zarasvandi\n\n2015-10-01\n\nfrom drill cores DH01, DH02, DH06, and DH07, and outcrop samples. Microthermometric data were obtained by freezing and heating of fluid inclusions on a Linkam THMSG600 mounted on an Olympus microscope at Lorestan University. Results 1 Five main veintypes were identified, belonging to three stages of mineralization:type (I: barren quartz, type (II: quartz + pyrite + chalcopyrite Â± bornite Â± chalcocite Â± covelite, type (III: quartz + magnetite Â± chalcopyrite, type (IV: K-feldsparÂ± quartz Â± chalcopyrite, type (V: chlorite + biotite. 2 Seven groups of fluid inclusionswere observed: (IA liquid-rich mono-phase, (IB vapor-rich mono-phase, (IIA liquid-rich two-phase (liquid + vapor, (IIB vapor-rich two-phase (vapor + liquid, (IIIA high salinity simple fluids (liquid + vapor + halite, (IIIB high salinity opaque mineral-bearing fluids (liquid + vapor + halite + pyrite + chalcopyrite + hematite, (IIIAB multi-phase fluids (liquid + vapor + halite + sylvite + hematite + magnetite + pyrite + chalcopyrite Â± erythrosiderite 3 Multiphase fluid inclusions with predominant homogenization temperatures 420 to 620ËC and predominant salinities 70 to 75 wt.%NaCl, are thought to be the early fluids involved in mineralization. 4 The coexistence of high saline liquid and vapor rich fluid inclusions (IIIAB, IIIB, IIIA and IIA types resulted either from fluid entrapment during the boiling process or the co-presence of two immiscible fluids generated from the magma. 5 Dalliporphyry Cu-Au deposit was formed in a magmatic-meteoric system. Discussion Two conventional thermometric procedures, freezing and heating, were employed for the measurement of temperature of homogenization and approximate salinity. Freezing was conducted mainly for halite-under saturated inclusions (types IIA and IIB, to measure the initial melting temperature (Te and the last melting point (Tmice, whereas heating was carried out on the halite-bearing inclusions (types IIIA, IIIB and IIIAB.

The fluid inclusions in quartz are of two types viz. (i) H 2 O liquid + vapour and (ii) H 2 O liquid + CO 2 liquid + CO 2 gas. Homogenization temperatures of H 2 O liquid + vapour type inclusions indicate that the temperature of formation varied between 150-350degC. Ice melting temperatures indicate that the hydrothermal solutions were CO 2 -bearing with a salinity of 6-8% NaCl. A common range of homogenization temperature for both liquid-rich as well as vapour-rich inclusions provides evidence for the boiling of the ore fluids.

The paper has the following contents: Introduction; A homogenization method; Validation of the method; Conclusion. In conclusion, a homogenization method has been exposed in the present paper to deal with the modal analysis of a coupled fluid-structure problem that takes into account the presence of solid inner inclusions on the fluid domain. The basic theory of the developed homogenization method has been recalled. The fluid-structure interaction is described in terms of pressure-displacement with the corrective terms taking into account the confinement effect induced by the inclusion. From the theoretical point of view, the method is furthermore demonstrated to be physically consistent in terms of total mass conservation. The method is validated on a generic 2D case, by a comparison of calculation performed on the fluid-structure system with inclusions and on the fluid-structure modified problem without inclusions. The numerical results are identical both in terms of Eigen-frequencies, Eigenmodes and modal masses. The method can be applied to the modal analysis of a nuclear reactor\n\nPetrography and fluid inclusions study in Marbin porphyry Molybdenum (Sn) index (northeast of Isfahan)\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMirzaei, M.; Bagheri, H.; Ayati, F.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nMarbin Tin and Molybdenum index is located in north of Zefreh Village the Isfahan Province and Uromieh-Dokhtar magmatic zone. The main rock units in this area are Eocene subvolcanic and volcanic rocks with rhyolite to dacite composition. Based on petrography studies the main minerals are plagioclase, quartz, sanidine and biotite and secondary minerals are chlorite, calcite, epidote and sericite. The main hydrothermal alterations are including sericitic, propylitic, intermediate argillic and silisification. Average grade of tin, molybdenum, copper and gold is about 4850, 157, 330 ppm and 82 ppb, respectively. Microthermometric studies on silica veins and veinlet indicate five different types of fluid inclusion, 1-three-phase type (L+V+SâL), 2- three-phase type (L+V+SâV), 3- two-phase type (L+VâL), 4- two-phase type (V+LâV), 5- vapor rich single phase type (V). Fluid inclusion studies in mineralized veins in phyllic and propylitic zones, show the wide range of homogenization temperature from 248 to 600 ÂºC and salinity from 28 to 65 wt% NaCl equivalent. The temperature, salinity and density of fluids decrease from phyllic to propylitic alteration zone. The wide range of homogenization temperatures for the studied fluid inclusions in index show dilution with surface water and fluid boiling, as the most important factor in ore deposition. According to field, mineralogical, geochemical and fluid inclusion studies Marbin index has been considered as a porphyry deposit type which show the most similarity with Mo porphyry systems in world wide.\n\n3D Volumetric Analysis of Fluid Inclusions Using Confocal Microscopy\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nProussevitch, A.; Mulukutla, G.; Sahagian, D.; Bodnar, B.\n\n2009-05-01\n\nFluid inclusions preserve valuable information regarding hydrothermal, metamorphic, and magmatic processes. The molar quantities of liquid and gaseous components in the inclusions can be estimated from their volumetric measurements at room temperatures combined with knowledge of the PVTX properties of the fluid and homogenization temperatures. Thus, accurate measurements of inclusion volumes and their two phase components are critical. One of the greatest advantages of the Laser Scanning Confocal Microscopy (LSCM) in application to fluid inclsion analsyis is that it is affordable for large numbers of samples, given the appropriate software analysis tools and methodology. Our present work is directed toward developing those tools and methods. For the last decade LSCM has been considered as a potential method for inclusion volume measurements. Nevertheless, the adequate and accurate measurement by LSCM has not yet been successful for fluid inclusions containing non-fluorescing fluids due to many technical challenges in image analysis despite the fact that the cost of collecting raw LSCM imagery has dramatically decreased in recent years. These problems mostly relate to image analysis methodology and software tools that are needed for pre-processing and image segmentation, which enable solid, liquid and gaseous components to be delineated. Other challenges involve image quality and contrast, which is controlled by fluorescence of the material (most aqueous fluid inclusions do not fluoresce at the appropriate laser wavelengths), material optical properties, and application of transmitted and/or reflected confocal illumination. In this work we have identified the key problems of image analysis and propose some potential solutions. For instance, we found that better contrast of pseudo-confocal transmitted light images could be overlayed with poor-contrast true-confocal reflected light images within the same stack of z-ordered slices. This approach allows one to narrow\n\nFluid inclusion from drill hole DW-5, Hohi geothermal area, Japan: Evidence of boiling and procedure for estimating CO2 content\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSasada, M.; Roedder, E.; Belkin, H.E.\n\n1986-01-01\n\nFluid inclusion studies have been used to derive a model for fluid evolution in the Hohi geothermal area, Japan. Six types of fluid inclusions are found in quartz obtained from the drill core of DW-5 hole. They are: (I) primary liquid-rich with evidence of boiling; (II) primary liquid-rich without evidence of boiling; (III) primary vapor-rich (assumed to have been formed by boiling); (IV) secondary liquid-rich with evidence of boiling; (V) secondary liquid-rich without evidence of boiling; (VI) secondary vapor-rich (assumed to have been formed by boiling). Homogenization temperatures (Th) range between 196 and 347??C and the final melting point of ice (Tm) between -0.2 and -4.3??C. The CO2 content was estimated semiquantitatively to be between 0 and 0.39 wt. % based on the bubble behavior on crushing. NaCl equivalent solid solute salinity of fluid inclusions was determined as being between 0 and 6.8 wt. % after minor correction for CO2 content. Fluid inclusions in quartz provide a record of geothermal activity of early boiling and later cooling. The CO2 contents and homogenization temperatures of fluid inclusions with evidence of boiling generally increase with depth; these changes, and NaCl equivalent solid solute salinity of the fluid can be explained by an adiabatic boiling model for a CO2-bearing low-salinity fluid. Some high-salinity inclusions without CO2 are presumed to have formed by a local boiling process due to a temperature increase or a pressure decrease. The liquid-rich primary and secondary inclusions without evidence of boiling formed during the cooling process. The salinity and CO2 content of these inclusions are lower than those in the boiling fluid at the early stage, probably as a result of admixture with groundwater. ?? 1986.\n\nA New Equivalent Statistical Damage Constitutive Model on Rock Block Mixed Up with Fluid Inclusions\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nXiao Chen\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available So far, there are few studies concerning the effect of closed âfluid inclusionsâ on the macroscopic constitutive relation of deep rock. Fluid-matrix element (FME is defined based on rock element in statistical damage model. The properties of FME are related to the size of inclusions, fluid properties, and pore pressure. Using FME, the equivalent elastic modulus of rock block containing fluid inclusions is obtained with Eshelby inclusion theory and the double M-T homogenization method. The new statistical damage model of rock is established on the equivalent elastic modulus. Besides, the porosity and confining pressure are important influencing factors of the model. The model reflects the initial damage (void and fluid inclusion and the macroscopic deformation law of rock, which is an improvement of the traditional statistical damage model. Additionally, the model can not only be consistent with the rock damage experiment date and three-axis compression experiment date of rock containing pore water but also describe the locked-in stress experiment in rock-like material. It is a new fundamental study of the constitutive relation of locked-in stress in deep rock mass.\n\nFluid Characteristics in the Giant Quartz Reef System of the Bundelkhand Craton, India: Constraints from Fluid Inclusion Study\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRout, D.; Panigrahi, M. K.; Pati, J. K.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nGiant quartz reefs are anomalous features indicating extensive mobilization of silica in the crust. Such reefs in the Abitibi belt, Canada and elsewhere are believed to be the result of activity of fluid of diverse sources on terrain boundaries. The Bundelkhand granitoid complex constituting a major part of the Bundelkhnad Craton in north-Central India is traversed by numerous such quartz reefs all across for a length of about 500 km. There are about 20 major reefs having dimensions of 35 to 40 km in length, 50 to 60 m in width standing out as prominent ridges in the region. Almost all are aligned parallel to each other in a sub-vertical to vertical manner following the NE-SW to NNE-SSW trend. Fluid inclusion petrography in quartz from these reefs reveal four types of inclusions viz. aqueous biphase (type-I), pure carbonic (type-II), aqueous carbonic (type-III) and polyphase (type-IV) inclusions. The type-I aqueous biphase inclusions are the dominant type in all the samples studied so far. Salinities calculated from temperature of melting of last ice (Tm) values are low to moderate, ranging from 0.18 to 18.19 wt% NaCl equivalents. Temperature of liquid-vapor homogenization (Th) values of these inclusions show a wide range from 101 ÂºC to 386 ÂºC (cluster around 150-250 ÂºC) essentially into liquid phase ruling out boiling during its course of evolution. Besides, aqueous Biphase inclusions, some data on pure CO2 inclusions furnish a near constant value of TmCO2 at -56.6 ÂºC in the Bundelkhand Craton indicating absence of CH4. Bivariate plot between Th and salinity suggest three possible water types which are controlling the overall activity of fluid in quartz reefs of Bundelkhand Craton viz. low-T low saline, high-T low saline and moderate-T and moderate saline. A low saline and CO2-bearing and higher temperature nature resembles a metamorphic fluid that may be a source for these giant quartz reefs. The low temperature low-salinity component could be a meteoric\n\nGeological setting of silica in Dehnow-Abid region (Eshghabad northeast using fluid inclusions studies\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOmid Yazdanpanah\n\n2017-02-01\n\n, fine and coarse grains arkosic and lithic arkose sandstones (Tucker, 1994 that show low grade metamorphic texture which may be attributed to these sediments metamorphosed Jurassic age, but their equivalence is more with Shemshak forrnation (Aghanabati, 1994. Silica mineralization occurred as veins, veinlets and in some parts show silica mass of lense. In this area, there are two generations of faults with trends of northeast-southwest and north-south. Based on the geological section, the North â South faults is the second generation that cut system North-East to South-West faults (Kosari, 2004. In microscopic studies of fluid inclusions different characteristics such as their relationship with the host mineral, phase contents, size, shape, necking down and degree of filling were investigated. Microscopic investigates at room temperature, based on the criteria provided by Van den Kerkhof and Hein, 2001; Shepherd et al., 1985; Rodder, 1984 were performed. These studies indicated that as genetically point fluid inclusions in quartz area are able to divide into three groups (primary, secondary and pseudo secondary. The shapes of fluid inclusions are very different, but partly follow mineral crystallization system. Size of fluid inclusion varies between 5 to 120 microns, but most abundant fluid inclusions have size of 20 to 60 microns. According to a survey done on double polishing sections in laboratory conditions, the phase contents of fluid inclusions may be divided into six groups that include : monophase liquid (L, monophase vapor (V, two phases rich of liquid (L+V, two phases rich of vapor (V+L, three phases (L+V+S and immiscible liquid (L1+L2+V. The presence of CO2 around gas bubbles can represent metamorphism environments (Yardley and Bodnar, 2014; Van den Kerkhof et al., 2014. Heating analysis was done on 113 samples of fluid inclusions studied in order to investigate the situation homogenization temperature, and cooling analysis was done on 99 selected samples\n\nFluid Inclusion Study of Quartz Xenocrysts in Mafic Dykes from Kawant Area, Chhota Udaipur District, Gujarat, India\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRandive Kirtikumar\n\n2015-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Unusual mafic dykes occur in the proximity of the Ambadongar Carbonatite Complex, Lower Narmada Valley, Gujarat, India. The dykes contain dense population of quartz xenocrysts within the basaltic matrix metasomatised by carbonate-rich fluids. Plagioclase feldspars, relict pyroxenes, chlorite, barite, rutile, magnetite, Fe-Ti oxides and glass were identified in the basaltic matrix. Quartz xenocrysts occur in various shapes and sizes and form an intricate growth pattern with carbonates. The xenocrysts are fractured and contain several types of primary and secondary, single phase and two-phase fluid inclusions. The two-phase inclusions are dominated by aqueous liquid, whereas the monophase inclusions are composed of carbonic gas and the aqueous inclusions homogenize to liquid between 226Â°C and 361Â°C. Majority of the inclusions are secondary in origin and are therefore unrelated to the crystallization of quartz. Moreover, the inclusions have mixed carbonic-aqueous compositions that inhibit their direct correlation with the crustal or mantle fluids. The composition of dilute CO2-rich fluids observed in the quartz xenocrysts appear similar to those exsolved during the final stages of evolution of the Amba Dongar carbonatites. However, the carbonates are devoid of fluid inclusions and therefore their genetic relation with the quartz xenocrysts cannot be established.\n\nDeciphering fluid inclusions in high-grade rocks\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlfons van den Kerkhof\n\n2014-09-01\n\nFull Text Available The study of fluid inclusions in high-grade rocks is especially challenging as the host minerals have been normally subjected to deformation, recrystallization and fluid-rock interaction so that primary inclusions, formed at the peak of metamorphism are rare. The larger part of the fluid inclusions found in metamorphic minerals is typically modified during uplift. These late processes may strongly disguise the characteristics of the âoriginalâ peak metamorphic fluid. A detailed microstructural analysis of the host minerals, notably quartz, is therefore indispensable for a proper interpretation of fluid inclusions. Cathodoluminescence (CL techniques combined with trace element analysis of quartz (EPMA, LA-ICPMS have shown to be very helpful in deciphering the rock-fluid evolution. Whereas high-grade metamorphic quartz may have relatively high contents of trace elements like Ti and Al, low-temperature re-equilibrated quartz typically shows reduced trace element concentrations. The resulting microstructures in CL can be basically distinguished in diffusion patterns (along microfractures and grain boundaries, and secondary quartz formed by dissolution-reprecipitation. Most of these textures are formed during retrograde fluid-controlled processes between ca. 220 and 500Â Â°C, i.e. the range of semi-brittle deformation (greenschist-facies and can be correlated with the fluid inclusions. In this way modified and re-trapped fluids can be identified, even when there are no optical features observed under the microscope.\n\nFluid inclusion brine compositions from Palo Duro Basin salt sites\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMoody, J.B.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nThe fluid inclusion analyses were done on salt samples from Lower San Andres Cycle 4 and 5. The stable isotope composition of the fluid inclusion brines was measured on duplicate samples taken from the same fluid inclusion brine for correlation of geochemical content with the stable isotopic content. The analyzed Palo Duro Basin salt fluid inclusions are predominantly one phase, i.e., the presence of a fluid only. However, many of the larger fluid inclusions do have a small vapor bubble. This liquid/vapor ratio is so high in these vapor-containing fluid inclusions that their behavior in a thermal gradient would be almost identical to that of all liquid inclusions. Closely associated with the fluid inclusions are cryptomelane where some fibers penetrate into halite host crystal. The fluid inclusions have a wide variability in content for those components that were analyzed, even within the same salt type. The fluid inclusion brines are also acidic, ranging from 3 to 6 as measured with pH test papers\n\nCu-Mo-Au mineralization in Qarachilar area, Qaradagh batholith (NW Iran): Fluid inclusion and stable isotope studies and Re-Os dating\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSimmonds, Vartan; Moazzen, Mohssen\n\n2015-04-01\n\nThe Qaradagh batholith is located in NW Iran, neighboring the Meghri-Ordubad granitoid in southern Armenia. This magmatic complex is emplaced in the northwestern part of the Urumieh-Dokhtar magmatic arc, which formed through north-eastward subduction of Neo-Tethyan oceanic crust beneath the central Iranian domain in the late-Mesozoic and early-Cenozoic and hosts most of the porphyry copper deposits and prospects in Iran, such as Sarcheshmeh and Sungun. The Qaradagh batholith is comprised of Eocene-Oligocene intrusive rocks occurring as multi-episode stocks, where the dominant rock type is granodiorite. Hydrothermal alterations have also occurred in these rocks including potassic, phyllic-sericitic, argillic and propylitic alterations and silicification. These alterations are accompanied by vein-type and disseminated Cu, Mo and Au mineralization. The Qarachilar area is located in the central part of the Qaradagh batholith, which hosts mono-mineralic and quartz-sulfide veins and veinlets (several mm to <1 m thick and 50-700 m long) and silicic zones containing Cu-Mo-Au-Ag ore minerals (mainly pyrite, chalcopyrite and molybdenite). Microthermometric studies on the fluid inclusions of quartz-sulfide veins-veinlets show that the salinity ranges between 15-70 wt% NaCl, with the highest peak between 35-40 wt% NaCl. The homogenization temperature for primary 2-phase and multi-phase inclusions ranges between 220 and 540 Â°C. Two-phase inclusions homogenizing by vapor disappearance have TH values between 280 and 440 Â°C (mainly between 300 and 360 Â°C). A few of them homogenize into vapor state with TH values of 440-540 Â°C. Multi-phase inclusions show 3 types of homogenization. Most of them homogenize by simultaneous disappearance of vapor bubble and dissolution of halite daughter crystal, for which the TH value is 240-420 Â°C (mostly between 260 and 340 Â°C). Those homogenizing by halite dissolution show TH values about 220-360 Â°C and a few homogenizing by vapor\n\nInvestigations of alteration zones based on fluid inclusion microthermometry at Sungun porphyry copper deposit, Iran\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nOmid ASGHARI\n\n2010-06-01\n\nFull Text Available The Sungun porphyry copper deposit is located in East Azerbaijan, NW of Iran. The porphyries occur as stocks and dikes ranging in composition from quartz monzodiorite to quartz monzonite. Four types of hypogene alteration are developed; potassic, phyllic, propylitic and argillic. Three types of fluid inclusions are typically observed at Sungun; (1 vapor-rich, (2 liquid-rich and (3 multi-phase. Halite is the principal solid phase in the latter. The primary multiphase inclusions within the quartz crystals were chosen for micro-thermometric analyses and considered to calculate the geological pressure and hydrothermal fluid density. In potassic zone, the average of homogenization temperature is 413.6 Â°C while in phyllic alteration, 375.9 Â°C. As expected in potassic alteration, the temperature of hydrothermal solutions is higher than that in the phyllic zone. The salinity of the hydrothermal fluids has a high coherency with homogenization temperature, so the average of salinity in potassic samples is 46.3 (wt% NaCl which is higher than phyllic samples. Based on the location of potassic alteration, as expected, the lithostatic pressure is much more than the phyllic one. Finally, the average density of hydrothermal fluids in the potassically altered samples is 1.124 (gr/cm3 which is higher than the ones in phyllic zone (1.083 gr/cm3 .\n\nMagmatic gases in fluid inclusions from hydrothermal ore deposits\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nGraney, J.; Kesler, S. (University of Michigan, MI (United States))\n\n1992-08-31\n\nIn this study, magmatic gases in fluid inclusions from hydrothermal ore deposits have been analyzed. The gas composition of fluid inclusions from a wide range of extinct hydrothermal systems as represented by different ore deposit types was determined using a quadrupole mass spectrometer. Most samples used for analysis consisted of transparent quartz, although barite, jasperoid, opal, sphalerite, pyrite, chalcopyrite, and bornite were also analyzed. H2O was the dominant volatile component in fluid inclusions, and composed 95-99 mole percent of the inclusion fluid. CO2 comprised most of the remaining volatile component and the other gases were generally present in amounts smaller than 0.1 mole percent. Analysis from porphyry and acid-sulfate deposits, in which magmatic gas contributions are considered to be largest, plotted closest to the fumarolic gas compositions. These inclusion fluid volatile component comparisons have shown that there are systematic differences in inclusion fluids from different hydrothermal systems. 9 refs., 3 figs.\n\nFluid Inclusion Study of The Tumpangpitu High Sulfidation Epithermal Gold Deposit in Banyuwangi District, East Java, Indonesia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nYu Yu Myaing\n\n2018-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The Tumpangpitu high sulfidation (HS epithermal gold deposit is located in the south coast of East Java, Banyuwangi District, East Java Province, Indonesia. This area lies within the central portion of the Cenozoic SundaâBanda magmatic arc which trends southeast from northern Sumatra to west Java then eastward through east Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa and terminating at Banda sea. The geology of the Tumpangpitu is predominantly occupied by Late Oligocene to Middle Miocene low-K calc-alkaline to alkaline andesitic volcanic rocks and interbedded with volcaniclastic rock sequences, which are associated with low-K intermediate intrusions. The mineralization style at the Tumpangpitu area is composed of a highâsulfidation (HS epithermal gold-copper system which is typically associated with concealed gold-rich porphyry copper system. The HS epithermal mineralization is hosted by volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks in this research area. The mineralization domains are divided into Zone A, Zone B and Zone C which are situated along NW-SE-trending silica ledges zones. The HS epithermal mineralization is texturally occurs as vuggy replacements mineralization as well as stockworks, disseminated forms, fractures and veins. Fluid inclusion study was conducted for 6 quartz vein samples which petrographically entrapped fluid inclusions. Homogenization temperature (Th and melting temperature (Tm can microthermometrically be determined by fluid inclusion analysis. The average homogenization temperature (Th of the fluid inclusions gives 180ËC to 342ËC and melting temperature are from -0.1 ËC to -1.4ËC. Tm corresponds to the salinities ranging from 0.1 to 4.5 wt% NaCl equivalent. The paleodepth of ore formation can be estimated from the salinity of fluid. Since the deposit was not formed at boiling condition, the minimum paleodepth of ore (quartz samples taken from both shallow level (53.35 m and deep level (135.15 m is determined at 650m and 1,220 m\n\nFluid inclusions study in thermal gradient wells, Nevado del Ruiz Volcano\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nUruena Suarez, Cindy L; Zuluaga, Carlos A; Molano, Juan Carlos\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA fluid inclusions study in the Nevado del Ruiz volcano hydrothermal system allowed to characterize fluids involved in the evolution of the geothermal system. Fluid inclusions hosted in quartz, plagioclase and carbonate from samples of the deepest parts of three thermal gradient wells were analyzed to understand fluid-rock interaction. Fluid inclusions hosted in carbonate veins with coloform microestructure represent hydrothermal fluids with temperatures higher than 250 Celsius degrade. This interpretation is supported by microprobe and cathodoluminescence analysis that also indicate a hydrothermal origin for the veins. Fluid inclusions hosted in quartz (mylonite) were originated by metamorphic fluids and fluid inclusions hosted in plagioclase (andesitic lavas) are considered to be originated from magmatic fluids (H 2 O + CO 2 system).\n\nGauge freedom in perfect fluid spatially homogeneous spacetimes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJantzen, R.T.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nThe class of reference systems compatible with the symmetry of a spatially homogeneous perfect fluid spacetime is discussed together with the associated class of symmetry adapted comoving ADM frames (or computational frames).

The ENE-WSW trending fracture zone is cut by NW-SE trending quartz reef. Fluid inclusion study carried out on quartz from the mineralized cataclasite and as well as from the quartz reef shows the presence of both primary [8-20 microns] and abundant secondary up to [6 microns] inclusions. Most of the inclusions are bi-phase (L+V) liquid rich having a degree of fill around 0.90 with constant liquid to vapour ratio. Few inclusions are liquid monophase and multiphase [S+L+V]. They behave as H 2 O-NaCl system and homogenize into liquid phase at low temperature range [125 to 200 degC] except some bi-phase inclusions in the barren quartz reef, which are found to behave as an impure H 2 O-NaCl system admixed with other salts. Wide variation of salinity in the range of 3-25 wt%e NaCl is recorded by the inclusions in both the mineralized cataclasite and the barren quartz reef. The trapping pressure [P T ] of the inclusions of barren quartz reef spreads between 200 to 600 bars while those of mineralized cataclasite restricts to upper end of that range. Some inclusions in mineralized cataclasite that homogenize at high temperatures [200 to 250 degC] show P T between 800 to 1000 bars. The presence of more than one population without any change in fluid composition indicate their origin at different stages of deformation modifying the primary inclusions of the granite and from fluids migrated through fractures at later stages. In the barren quartz reef, the distribution of inclusions of contrasting salinity implies the environment of mixing of connectively driven hydrothermal fluid of metamorphic origin and meteoric water.

[Hattenburg Dilley & Linnell, LLC, Anchorage, AL (United States)\n\n2015-04-13\n\nThe purpose of this project was to: 1) evaluate the relationship between geothermal fluid processes and the compositions of the fluid inclusion gases trapped in the reservoir rocks; and 2) develop methodologies for interpreting fluid inclusion gas data in terms of the chemical, thermal and hydrological properties of geothermal reservoirs. Phase 1 of this project was designed to conduct the following: 1) model the effects of boiling, condensation, conductive cooling and mixing on selected gaseous species; using fluid compositions obtained from geothermal wells, 2) evaluate, using quantitative analyses provided by New Mexico Tech (NMT), how these processes are recorded by fluid inclusions trapped in individual crystals; and 3) determine if the results obtained on individual crystals can be applied to the bulk fluid inclusion analyses determined by Fluid Inclusion Technology (FIT). Our initial studies however, suggested that numerical modeling of the data would be premature. We observed that the gas compositions, determined on bulk and individual samples were not the same as those discharged by the geothermal wells. Gases discharged from geothermal wells are CO2-rich and contain low concentrations of light gases (i.e. H2, He, N, Ar, CH4). In contrast many of our samples displayed enrichments in these light gases. Efforts were initiated to evaluate the reasons for the observed gas distributions. As a first step, we examined the potential importance of different reservoir processes using a variety of commonly employed gas ratios (e.g. Giggenbach plots). The second technical target was the development of interpretational methodologies. We have develop methodologies for the interpretation of fluid inclusion gas data, based on the results of Phase 1, geologic interpretation of fluid inclusion data, and integration of the data. These methodologies can be used in conjunction with the relevant geological and hydrological information on the system to\n\nThe nature of hydrothermal fluids in the Kahang porphyry copper deposit (Northeast of Isfahan based on mineralography, fluid inclusion and stable isotopic data\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSalimeh Sadat Komeili\n\n2017-02-01\n\nhypogene sulfide mineral and chalcopyrite is the predominant Cu- sulfide in the Kahang mineralized area. Primary magnetite grains having irregular boundaries formed in association with phyllic âpotassic altered zones (Afshooni et al., 2014. Chalcocite and covellite as secondary copper minerals in the enriched supergene zone replaced the chalcopyrite. Thermometric studies on fluid inclusions conducted on quartz veins was related to the phyllic zone. Almost all studied fluid inclusions were homogenized to the liquid phase. Hydrothermal solutions with salinity over 26% wt equivalent NaCl, comparable with those of the other porphyry deposits (Morales Ruano et al., 2002; Hezarkhani, 2006; Hezarkhani, 2009 were responsible for the formation of the Kahang porphyry copper deposit. Homogenization temperatures of 200-450Â°C and 500-550Â°C were obtained from heating- cooling experiments on the two and multi phase fluid inclusions. The presence of gas riched fluid inclusions together with those of liquid riched and multiphase different salinities in the quartz veins as well as the occurrence of hydrothermal breccias are indicative of boiling fluids. Result In the Kahang porphyry Cu- deposit, the oxidation zone is characterized by hematite, goethite, jarosite, malachite, and azurite; the supergene zone is identified by chalcocite, chalcopyrite and coevllite; and chalcopyrite, pyrite and magnetite are the mineral assemblage of the hypogene zone. The volcanic as well as the plutonic rocks of the area have been hydrothermally altered which gave rise to the formation of propyllitic, intermediate argillic and mineralized phyllic zones. Fluid inclusion study on quartz veins revealed salinity over 26% wt equivalent NaCl and homogenization temperature of 200-450Â°C and 500-550Â°C.

The migration of fluid inclusions in a thermal gradient is a potential hazard to the safe disposal of nuclear waste in a salt repository. At the present time, a prediction as to whether this hazard precludes the use of salt for waste disposal can not be made. Limited data from the Salt-Vault in situ heater experiments in the early 1960's (Bradshaw and McClain, 1971) leave little doubt that fluid inclusions can migrate towards a heat source. In addition to the bibliography, there is a brief summary of the physical and chemical characteristics that together with the temperature of the waste will determine the chemical composition of the brine in contact with the waste canister, the rate of fluid migration, and the brine-canister-waste interactions\n\nGeochemical and geophysical investigations, and fluid inclusion studies in the exploration area of Zafarghand (Northeast Isfahan, Iran\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZahra Alaminia\n\n2017-11-01\n\nproducing maps resulting from the detecting of anomaly or threshold values from the background (Aitchison, 1986; Sun et al., 2009. Anomalies of Cu, Mo, Au, Ag, Pb, Zn and Sb were determined by Mean + 2 standard deviation (Cheng, 2007; Zuo et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2016. Geochemical maps for these elements in rocks and soils (Fig. 4 show significant contrasts in haloes concentrations within the diorite and dacite rocks in the southeast of the study area. The addition of concentrations in rocks is suggested indicating that a district-scale geochemical present is confined to either base metals or precious metals. The obtained fluid inclusion results are compiled in Table 3. Primary fluid inclusions in quartz mostly consist of two-phases and rarely three phases. Homogenization temperatures (Th in quartz samples represent wide variations from 123Â° to 550Â°C. They were classified according to the mode of homogenization into two immiscible types (Fig. 8: These are early inclusions stage with a high Th (between 328Â° and 550Â°C and late stage inclusions with a low Th (between 123Â° and 390Â°C. The salinity measured using the equation of Bodnar (1993 for fluid inclusions varies from 1.15 to 43 eqv.wt% NaCl. It was divided into two groups including high salinity (32 to 43 eqv.wt% NaCl and low salinity (1.15 to 5.16 eqv.wt% NaCl. Discussion The predictive results obtained by field observations, geochemical and micro thermometric studies are in good agreement with the known deposits. Geochemical anomalies are associated with phyllic and rare silicified altered rocks. The host rocks of anomalies are mainly dacite and diorite, respectively with an Eocene and younger age. District-scale geochemical patterns of several elements (Cu, Mo, Au, Pb, Ag, As, and Sb in the surface coincide with the southeastern area and can be used to explore for epithermal and/or porphyry-type deposits.

MeV protons interact with a target through electronic interactions with a loss of â¼100 eV per collision. Such small energy loss leads to a smooth and predictable slowing down behaviour with a small energy uncertainty. Furthermore, the small momentum transfers in these collisions result in negligible spreading of the beam (e.g. â¼1 Î¼m at 40 Î¼m depth in quartz). Hence, the proton path can be regarded as linear. The principle mechanisms for proton energy loss, proton-induced ionization, secondary fluorescence and X-ray absorption and detection are understood and well characterized. This enables the integration of expected PIXE X-ray yields along the path of the proton beam and provides the foundation for a standardless microanalytical method. A strength of standardless PIXE analysis enables the approach to be extended to complex problems where the production of standards becomes impractical or unrepresentative of natural samples. One such problem is the study of ore metal transport and ore formation processes using the non-destructive analysis of fluids trapped as fluid inclusions in minerals using a raster-scanned proton probe. In this case, the integration of PIXE X-rays can be confined to the volume of the fluid inclusion in order to calculate the yield of elemental X-rays per ppm of an element. This calculation is illustrated, which shows one volume element of the fluid inclusion excited by the beam and the X-ray path to a detector. The CSIRO-GEMOC Nuclear Microprobe can focus a 3 MeV proton beam into a 1.3 Î¼m beam spot for fluid inclusion analysis and intense beams for mineral imaging at 1.8 Î¼m resolution (Ryan et al., 2001a).

Under diagenetic temperatures (fluid inclusion trails. The association of DauphinÃ© twins and fluid inclusion trails from which temperature and possibly timing can be inferred provides a way to research mechanism and timing of twinning, and potentially the magnitude of paleostrain and stress in some diagenetic settings. Using examples from East Texas and Colorado cores, we show that twins are associated with crack-seal microstructure and fluid inclusions. Fracture wall-parallel and wall-normal inclusion trails contain coexisting aqueous and hydrocarbon gas inclusions, so homogenization temperatures of aqueous inclusions, ranging from 130Â°C to 159Â°C in the East Texas Basin, and from 162Â°C to 176Â°C in the Piceance Basin, record true trapping temperatures. Inclusions in wall-normal trails are large and irregularly shaped compared to those in wall-parallel trails, but both show similar liquid-to-vapor ratios. Trapping temperatures for wall-normal inclusion trails are usually higher than those in the wall-parallel trails. Wall-normal fluid inclusion assemblage temperatures typically match the highest temperatures of wall-parallel assemblages trapped during sequential widening, but not necessarily the most recent. In context of burial histories for these samples, this temperature pattern implies that wall-normal assemblages form at discrete times during or after crack-seal fracture widening. Stacking transmitted light images with scanning electron microscope cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) and electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) images demonstrates that the twin boundaries are localized along wall-normal inclusion trails. Localization in isolated, potentially high-stress quartz deposits in fractures is compatible with a mechanical origin for these DauphinÃ© twins. Punctuated temperature values and discrepant sizes and shapes of inclusions in wall-normal trails imply that twinning is\n\nMineralogical, stable isotope, and fluid inclusion studies of spatially related porphyry Cu and epithermal Au-Te mineralization, Fakos Peninsula, Limnos Island, Greece\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFornadel, Andrew P.; Voudouris, Panagiotis Ch.; Spry, Paul G.; Melfos, Vasilios\n\n2012-05-01\n\nThe Fakos porphyry Cu and epithermal Au-Te deposit, Limnos Island, Greece, is hosted in a ~20 Ma quartz monzonite and shoshonitic subvolcanic rocks that intruded middle Eocene to lower Miocene sedimentary basement rocks. Metallic mineralization formed in three stages in quartz and quartz-calcite veins. Early porphyry-style (Stage 1) metallic minerals consist of pyrite, chalcopyrite, galena, bornite, sphalerite, molybdenite, and iron oxides, which are surrounded by halos of potassic and propylitic alteration. Stage 2 mineralization is composed mostly of quartz-tourmaline veins associated with sericitic alteration and disseminated pyrite and molybdenite, whereas Stage 3, epithermal-style mineralization is characterized by polymetallic veins containing pyrite, chalcopyrite, sphalerite, galena, enargite, bournonite, tetrahedrite-tennantite, hessite, petzite, altaite, an unknown cervelleite-like Ag-telluride, native Au, and Au-Ag alloy. Stage 3 veins are spatially associated with sericitic and argillic alteration. Fluid inclusions in quartz from Stage 1 (porphyry-style) mineralization contain five types of inclusions. Type I, liquid-vapor inclusions, which homogenize at temperatures ranging from 189.5Â°C to 403.3Â°C have salinities of 14.8 to 19.9 wt. % NaCl equiv. Type II, liquid-vapor-NaCl, Type III liquid-vapor-NaCl-XCl2 (where XCl is an unknown chloride phase, likely CaCl2), and Type IV, liquid-vapor-hematite Â± NaCl homogenize to the liquid phase by liquid-vapor homogenization or by daughter crystal dissolution at temperatures of 209.3 to 740.5 Â°C, 267.6 to 780.8 Â°C, and 357.9 to 684.2 Â°C, respectively, and, Type V, vapor-rich inclusions. Stage 2 veins are devoid of interpretable fluid inclusions. Quartz from Stage 3 (epithermal-style) veins contains two types of fluid inclusions, Type I, liquid-vapor inclusions that homogenize to the liquid phase (191.6 to 310.0 Â°C) with salinities of 1.40 to 9.73 wt. % NaCl equiv., and Type II, vapor-rich inclusions.

Inclusions have been measured in minerals from four of the five stages of mineralization previously recognized at Creede. The few inclusions of fluids depositing rhodochrosite (A-stage, earliest in the paragenesis) yield Th and salinity values more similar to those of the low-temperature (average Th 217?C) fluids forming some of the much later fluorite (C-stage) than to any of the other fluids. Th measurements on A-stage quartz range from 192?C to 263?C and average 237?C. The early, fine-grained, B-stage sphalerites yielded Th of 214 to 241?C and salinities of 6.1 to 10.2 wt. % eq. D-stage sphalerite (late in the paragenesis) has been studied in detail (growth-zone by growth-zone) for several localities along the OH vein and reveals a generally positive correlation among Th, salinity and iron content of the host sphalerite. The deposition of D-stage sphalerite was characterized by repeated cycling through different regions of salinity/Th space, as Th and salinity generally decreased with time. Seventeen salinity-Th measurements were made on D-stage sphalerite from one locality on the Bulldog Mountain vein system, which, like the OH vein, is one of four major ore-producing vein systems at Creede. These data suggest a lower Th for a given salinity fluid from sphalerite on the Bulldog Mountain vein than on the OH vein.

The ores are unconformity and fault-controlled and occur as subvertical column-shaped bodies developed in dissolution-collapse breccias and in cavities within the Late Aptian platform carbonate rocks, which are covered unconformably by impermeable shales and marls of the Fahdene Formation (Late Albian-Cenomanian age). The host rock is hydrothermally altered to ankerite proximal to and within the ore bodies. Quartz, as fine-grained bipyramidal crystals, formed during hydrothermal alteration of the host rocks. The ore mineral assemblage is composed of barite, fluorite, sphalerite, and galena in decreasing abundance. The ore zones outline distinct depositional events: sphalerite-galena, barite-ankerite, and fluorite. Fluid inclusions, commonly oil-rich, have distinct fluid salinities and homogenization temperatures for each of these events: sphalerite-galena (17 to 24 wt% NaCl eq., and Th from 112 to 136 Â°C); ankerite-barite (11 to 17 wt% NaCl eq., and Th from 100 to 130 Â°C); fluorite (19 to 21 wt% NaCl eq., Th from 140 to 165 Â°C). The mean temperature of the ore fluids decreased from sphalerite (125 Â°C) to barite (115 Â°C) and increased during fluorite deposition (152 Â°C); then decreased to Ë110 Â°C during late calcite precipitation. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses of fluid inclusions in fluorite are metal rich (hundreds to thousands ppm Pb, Zn, Cu, Fe) but the inclusions in barite are deficient in Pb, Zn, Cu, Fe. Inclusions in fluorite have Cl/Br and Na/Br ratios of several thousand, consistent with dissolution of halite while the inclusions analysed in barite have values lower than seawater which are indicative of a Br-enriched brine derived from evaporation plus a component of halite dissolution. The salinity of the barite-hosted fluid inclusions is less than obtained simply by the\n\nFluid inclusion investigations in Nagra's boreholes of Northern Switzerland\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMullis, J.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nFluid inclusions studied in quartz and calcite from 6 Nagra-boreholes and the oil exploration well Pfaffnau in northern Switzerland were used to evaluate the evolution of fluid composition and trapping conditions. The studied boreholes covered representative sections of the Tertiary, Mesozoic and Permo-Carboniferous sedimentary rocks in addition to the underlying crystalline basement. Two fluid groups were identified, one containing salt-poor NaCl-(KCl) fluids of Upper Carboniferous age, and a second group containing salt-rich to salt-poor CaCl 2 -NaCl-(MgCl 2 ) fluids trapped between Permian and Tertiary times. The inclusions of the first group were trapped at relatively high temperatures (100 degrees to 350 degrees C, rarely up to 400 degrees C) and low pressures (probably below 1 kbar). Their widespread occurrence along healed fractures in rock forming minerals of the crystalline basement and in detrital quartz grains of the Permo-Carboniferous and Triassic sandstones imply a tectonic/thermic event on a regional scale during late Variscan orogeny. The second group of fluids comprises early salt-rich and late salt-poor inclusions. The inclusions were trapped between 30 degrees and 140 degrees C and are detected preferentially in fissure minerals and porefilling cements. The widespread occurrence of the salt-poor fluids along healed fractures inside the host minerals imply major tectonic events especially during Tertiary times. These tectonic events are probably responsible for increased fluid migration and possibly also for brine dilution. The two fluid groups display a considerable similarity with the high-temperature/low-saliniferous Variscan fluid system of the Black Forest and Oberpfalz.

The mÃ©lange represents a fossil subduction-zone channel from a cold, mature subduction zone with a geothermal gradient of 6 Â°C/km. One hundred and twenty-five determinations of salinity in primary inclusions hosted in jadeite, quartz, apatite and lawsonite range between extremes of 1.2 and 8.7, but yield a well-defined mean of 4.5 Â± 1.1 wt% (Â±1 s.d.) NaCl equiv, slightly higher than mean seawater (3.5 wt%). In one sample, eight additional fluid inclusions in quartz aligned along grain boundaries yield slightly lower values of 2.7 Â± 1.3 wt% NaCl equiv. Homogenization temperatures were also measured for 47 fluid inclusions in two samples, but primary entrapment densities are not preserved. It is significant that the suite includes two types of samples: those precipitated directly from an aqueous fluid as well as examples of metasomatic replacement of a pre-existing magmatic rock. Nevertheless, the results indicate identical salinity for both types and suggest a much stronger genetic link between the two types of jadeitite and jadeite-rich rock than has previously been assumed. Based on the results of conductivity measurements in modern subduction zones, we envision a pervasive fluid in the subduction channel that evolved from salinity levels lower than those in sea-water up to the measured values due to on-going but largely completed serpentinization in the subduction channel. The present data represent a reference marker for the subduction channel of the Rio San Juan intra-oceanic subduction zone at 30-50 km depth and after 50-60 Myr of operation.\n\nOrigin and timing of DauphinÃ© twins in quartz cement in fractured sandstones from diagenetic environments: Insight from fluid inclusions\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nFall, AndrÃ¡s; Ukar, Estibalitz; Laubach, Stephen E.\n\n2016-09-01\n\nElectron backscattered diffraction techniques (EBSD) show that DauphinÃ© twins in quartz are widespread in many tectonometamorphic environments. Our study documents that under diagenetic temperatures (fluid inclusions. Fracture wall-parallel and wall-normal inclusion trails contain coexisting aqueous and hydrocarbon gas inclusions, so homogenization temperatures of aqueous inclusions record true trapping temperatures. Inclusions in alignments normal to fracture walls are large and irregularly shaped compared to those aligned parallel to walls, but both show similar liquid-to-vapor ratios. Stacking transmitted light images with scanning electron microscope cathodoluminescence (SEM-CL) and EBSD images demonstrates that DauphinÃ© twin boundaries are localized along wall-normal inclusion trails. Trapping temperatures for wall-normal inclusion trails are usually higher than those aligned parallel to the fracture wall. Wall-normal fluid inclusion assemblage temperatures typically match the highest temperatures of wall-parallel assemblages trapped during sequential widening, but not necessarily the most recent. In context of burial histories for these samples, this temperature pattern implies that wall-normal assemblages form at discrete times during or after crack-seal fracture widening. Localization in isolated, potentially high-stress quartz deposits in fractures is compatible with a mechanical origin for these DauphinÃ© twins. Punctuated temperature values and discrepant sizes and shapes of inclusions in wall-normal trails implies that twinning is a by-product of the formation of the wall-normal inclusion assemblages. The association of DauphinÃ© twins and fluid inclusion assemblages from which temperature and possibly timing can be inferred provides a way to research timing as well as magnitude of paleostress in some diagenetic settings.\n\nStatistical mechanics of homogeneous partly pinned fluid systems.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKrakoviack, Vincent\n\n2010-12-01\n\nThe homogeneous partly pinned fluid systems are simple models of a fluid confined in a disordered porous matrix obtained by arresting randomly chosen particles in a one-component bulk fluid or one of the two components of a binary mixture. In this paper, their configurational properties are investigated. It is shown that a peculiar complementarity exists between the mobile and immobile phases, which originates from the fact that the solid is prepared in presence of and in equilibrium with the adsorbed fluid. Simple identities follow, which connect different types of configurational averages, either relative to the fluid-matrix system or to the bulk fluid from which it is prepared. Crucial simplifications result for the computation of important structural quantities, both in computer simulations and in theoretical approaches. Finally, possible applications of the model in the field of dynamics in confinement or in strongly asymmetric mixtures are suggested.\n\nA computational analysis on homogeneous-heterogeneous mechanism in Carreau fluid flow\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKhan, Imad; Rehman, Khalil Ur; Malik, M. Y.; Shafquatullah\n\n2018-03-01\n\nIn this article magnetohydrodynamic Carreau fluid flow towards stretching cylinder is considered in the presence of homogeneous-heterogeneous reactions effect. The flow model is structured by utilizing theoretical grounds. For the numerical solution a shooting method along with Runge-Kutta algorithm is executed. The outcomes are provided through graphs. It is observed that the Carreau fluid concentration shows decline values via positive iterations of homogeneous-heterogeneous reaction parameters towards both shear thinning and thickening case. The present work is certified through comparison with already existing literature in a limiting sense.\n\nA salt diapir-related Mississippi Valley-type deposit: The Bou Jaber Pb-Zn-Ba-F deposit, Tunisia: Fluid inclusion and isotope study\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBouhlel, Salah; Leach, David; Johnson, Craig A.; Marsh, Erin; Salmi-Laouar, Sihem; Banks, David A.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nThe Bou Jaber Ba-F-Pb-Zn deposit is located at the edge of the Bou Jaber Triassic salt diapir in the Tunisia Salt Diapir Province. The ores are unconformity and fault-controlled and occur as subvertical column-shaped bodies developed in dissolution-collapse breccias and in cavities within the Late Aptian platform carbonate rocks, which are covered unconformably by impermeable shales and marls of the Fahdene Formation (Late AlbianâCenomanian age). The host rock is hydrothermally altered to ankerite proximal to and within the ore bodies. Quartz, as fine-grained bipyramidal crystals, formed during hydrothermal alteration of the host rocks. The ore mineral assemblage is composed of barite, fluorite, sphalerite, and galena in decreasing abundance. The ore zones outline distinct depositional events: sphalerite-galena, barite-ankerite, and fluorite. Fluid inclusions, commonly oil-rich, have distinct fluid salinities and homogenization temperatures for each of these events: sphalerite-galena (17 to 24Â wt% NaCl eq., and Th from 112 to 136Â Â°C); ankerite-barite (11 to 17Â wt% NaCl eq., and Th from 100 to 130Â Â°C); fluorite (19 to 21Â wt% NaCl eq., Th from 140 to 165Â Â°C). The mean temperature of the ore fluids decreased from sphalerite (125Â Â°C) to barite (115Â Â°C) and increased during fluorite deposition (152Â Â°C); then decreased to â¼110Â Â°C during late calcite precipitation. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) analyses of fluid inclusions in fluorite are metal rich (hundreds to thousands ppm Pb, Zn, Cu, Fe) but the inclusions in barite are deficient in Pb, Zn, Cu, Fe. Inclusions in fluorite have Cl/Br and Na/Br ratios of several thousand, consistent with dissolution of halite while the inclusions analysed in barite have values lower than seawater which are indicative of a Br-enriched brine derived from evaporation plus a component of halite dissolution. The salinity of the barite-hosted fluid inclusions is less than obtained\n\nFluids in the SiilinjÃ¤rvi carbonatite complex, eastern Finland: Fluid inclusion evidence for the formation conditions of zircon and apatite\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPoutiainen, M.\n\n1995-06-01\n\nFull Text Available In the studied zircon and apatite crystals, data recorded two different compositional types of fluid inclusions: Type 1 H2O-CO2, low salinity inclusions (XCO2 = 0.42 to 0.87; XNaCl = 0.001 to 0.005 with bulk densities of 0.73 to 0.87 g/cm3, and Type 2 H2O moderate salinity (XNaCl = 0.03 to 0.06 inclusions with densities of 0.83 to 1.02 g/cm3. The Type 1 inclusions are not present in apatite. In zircon, the observed fluid inclusion types occur in separate domains: around (Type 1 and outside (Type 2 the apparent core. Fluid inclusions are further subdivided into pseudosecondary and secondary inclusions. Using a combination of SEM-EDS, optical characteristics and crushing-stage, various daughter and captive minerals were identified. The fluid inclusion data suggest that the pseudosecondary Type 1 and Type 2 inclusions in zircon and apatite were trapped during the pre-emplacement evolution of the carbonatite at mid-crustal conditions (Pâ¥4 kbar, Tâ¥625Â°C. The Type 1 fluid was depleted in CO2, during crystal fractionation and cooling leading to a fluid phase enriched in water and alkalies. Fenitization was obviously induced by these saline aqueous fluids. During emplacement of the carbonatite to the present level, zircon phenocrysts were intensively fractured, some Type 1 inclusions were re-equilibrated, and multiphase Type 2 inclusions were trapped. It is assumed that all these inclusions in zircon and the pseudosecondary Type 2 inclusions in apatite have a magmatic origin. In apatite, calcite inclusions occur side-by-side with the secondary Type 2 inclusions. These calcites co-existed with the aqueous fluid during fracturing and metamorphic re-crystallization of apatites. Probably, this metamorphic fluid also is responsible for the transport and deposition of at least some of the calcite at low temperatures (200-350Â°C.\n\nTrace element analyses of fluid inclusions using laser ablation ICP-MS\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCong-ying Li\n\n2018-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Fluid inclusions are records of the physico-chemical conditions of ï¬uidârock interactions during magmatism, mineralization and fluid percolation and mixing processes. Laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS is a powerful tool for in situ analyses of small samples at micrometer levels. Here we report in situ analyses of fluid inclusions using LA-ICP-MS method. NIST SRM glasses and 23Na are generally used as external and internal standards for LA-ICP-MS analysis of fluid inclusion, respectively, although the RSD of microthermometric estimation of 23Na is about 20% and even worse, the background signal of Na is high for most ICP-MS. Using well-characterized natural fluids inclusion, we show that RESOlution S-155 laser system analyze fluid inclusions in quartz and determine the trace element concentrations. Resonetics RESOlution S-155 laser has the advantage of the motorized Z stage can be used to accommodate variation of sample height or sample topography and height difference between samples, which is very important for analyzing the fluid inclusion in quartz. Our results suggest laser energy density is 25Â J/cm2, laser pulse repetition rates are commonly between 6 and 10Â Hz to avoid the fissuring of quartz and obtain adequate results. For this LA-ICP-MS analysis, uncertainty on 35Cl content is around 40% because of intensity of the 35Cl signal is three orders of magnitude less intense than the intensity of the 23Na signal. Nevertheless, it is still a useful reference for fluid inclusion analyses in addition to 23Na. This technique can be applied to a range of hydrothermal geology problems, including determining the origins of ore forming brines and ore deposition processes, mapping metamorphic and hydrothermal ï¬uid provinces and pathways, and constraining the effects of ï¬uidârock reactions and ï¬uid mixing.\n\nCharacterization of fluid inclusions and sulfur isotopes in the Iju porphyry copper deposit, North West of Shahr-e-Babak\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMalihe Golestani\n\n2017-07-01\n\nhomogenization temperatures between 140 to 480Â°C and salinity between 0.18 to >52.99 wt.% NaCl equiv., which are most similar to the results of the other Iranian porphyry copper deposits. Being located in the quartz-sericite-pyrite alteration zone, the results of thermometry indicates that ore deposition in the Iju deposit has occurred via mixing of magmatic and surface fluids. Variations in salinity and paragenesis of the saline multiphase fluid inclusions and two-phase gas-rich fluid inclusions indicate the occurrence of boiling phenomenon in some samples of the Iju deposit. The amount of Î´34S for pyrite has a limited range close to zero (average, 0.229â° that shows a magmatic origin for sulfur. Considering the presence of subvolcanic rocks, the type and extension of alteration zones, the structure and texture of ore bodies, thermometry results of fluid inclusions and sulfur isotope values, the Iju deposit is similar to porphyry copper deposits. Discussion In the quartz-sericite-pyrite zone, three main groups of veinlets have been identified. The quartz+pyrite veinlets are more abundant than the other types and they were selected for fluid inclusions and stable isotope studies. Petrographic studies of fluid inclusions identifies two groups of fluids including: 1- fluid inclusions without the halite phase, including the types L+V, L+V+S1 and (L+V+S1+S2, that is secondary, 2- fluid inclusions with halite phase, including the types L+V+H, L+V+H+S1, L+V+H+S1+S2 and L+V+H+S1+An. Homogenization temperature and salinity for the fluid inclusions without halite phase are as follows: 140 to 380Â°C and 0.18 to 24 wt.% NaCl (Fig. 8A and C and for the fluid inclusions with halite phase they range from 230 to 480Â°C and 30 to 52 wt.% NaCl (Fig. 9A, B and D, In addition, the pressure and depth for the fluid inclusions containing halite phase are 750 bar and 3500 m on the average. Fluid inclusions available at the quartz veinlets of porphyry copper deposits can be formed in a wide range of\n\n[Application of in situ cryogenic Raman spectroscopy to analysis of fluid inclusions in reservoirs].\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChen, Yong; Lin, Cheng-yan; Yu, Wen-quan; Zheng, Jie; Wang, Ai-guo\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIdentification of salts is a principal problem for analysis of fluid inclusions in reservoirs. The fluid inclusions from deep natural gas reservoirs in Minfeng sub-sag were analyzed by in situ cryogenic Raman spectroscopy. The type of fluid inclusions was identified by Raman spectroscopy at room temperature. The Raman spectra show that the inclusions contain methane-bearing brine aqueous liquids. The fluid inclusions were analyzed at -180 degrees C by in situ cryogenic Raman spectroscopy. The spectra show that inclusions contain three salts, namely NaCl2, CaCl2 and MgCl2. Sodium chloride is most salt component, coexisting with small calcium chloride and little magnesium chloride. The origin of fluids in inclusions was explained by analysis of the process of sedimentation and diagenesis. The mechanism of diagenesis in reservoirs was also given in this paper. The results of this study indicate that in situ cryogenic Raman spectroscopy is an available method to get the composition of fluid inclusions in reservoirs. Based on the analysis of fluid inclusions in reservoirs by in situ cryogenic Raman spectroscopy with combination of the history of sedimentation and diagenesis, the authors can give important evidence for the type and mechanism of diagenesis in reservoirs.\n\nFluid structure interaction in LMFBR cores modelling by an homogenization method\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBrochard, D.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThe upper plenum of the internals of PWR, the steam generator bundle, the nuclear reactor core, may be schematically represented by a beam bundle immersed in a fluid. The dynamical study of such a system needs to take into account fluid structure interaction. A refined model at the scale of the tubes can be used but leads to a very difficult problem to solve even on the largest computers. The homogenization method allows to have an approximation of the fluid structure interaction for the global behaviour of the bundle. It consists of replacing the heterogeneous physical medium (tubes and fluid) by an equivalent homogeneous medium whose characteristics are determined from the resolution of a set of problems on the elementary cell. The aim of this paper is to present the main steps of the determination of this equivalent medium in the case of small displacements (acoustic behaviour of the fluid). Then an application to LMFBR core geometry has been realised, which shows the lowering effect on eigenfrequencies due to the fluid. Some comparisons with test results will be presented. 6 refs, 7 figs, 2 tabs\n\nStudy of genesis in Qahr-Abad fluorite deposit using fluid inclusion, southeast of Saqqez, the Kurdistan province\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMehrdad Barati\n\n2017-07-01\n\nFull Text Available Introduction The Qahr-abad fluorite deposit is located in the area of 36Â°10â² 3â²â² N and 46Â°34â² 21â²â²E within the Sanandaj-Sirjan district east of the Kurdistan province , Iran and it is located ~57 km southeast of the city of Saqqez (Kholghi Khasraghi, 1999. This deposit is developed as scatter lenses, veins, and veinlets (stockwork structure within carbonate rocks of Elika formation and controlled by the regional NWâSE trending Zagross thrust nappe system. Fault trends in this area are perpendicular to fault trends in the Zagros zone. The fault dips are nearly vertical and mineralization has occurred in the brecciation fault zone (Talaii, 2010. The rough geological instruction of the deposit has indicated that it is similar to worldwide Epithermal deposits. The mineralization occurs as replacement (type I/ open-space (type II vein fillings and bodies within Mesozoic lime stones (mostly Upper Triassic and Lower Jurassic members of the Elika Formation, where they crop out to form horst structures. The mineralization is typically associated with post Pliocene disjunctive faults, which in part appear to have served as channel ways for the fluorite forming fluids that are representative of the geological setting of the mineralized area. Fluorite occurs in several color variations such as green, violet, blue, white or colorless, and is accompanied by quartz, barite and calcite (Moslehi, 2013. Materials and methods The minerals sampled for the ï¬uid inclusion study include ï¬uorite from mineralization stages. Samples covered all ore types. Micro thermometry analyses for 23 samples were performed after careful microscopic observation of 35 sections and 30 doubly polished sections. Micro thermometry was undertaken using a Linkam THS600 heating-freezing stage, with a measurable temperature range of between â196 and +600 Â°C (precision of freezing data and homogenization temperature of Â±0.2 Â°C.

Understanding the life cycle of a fracture in a geothermal system is fundamental to the development of techniques for creating fractures. Recognizing the stage of a fracture, whether it is currently open and transmitting fluids; if it recently has closed; or if it is an ancient fracture would assist in targeting areas for further fracture stimulation. Identifying dense fracture areas as well as large open fractures from small fracture systems will also assist in fracture stimulation selection. Geothermal systems are constantly generating fractures, and fluids and gases passing through rocks in these systems leave small fluid and gas samples trapped in healed microfractures. Fluid inclusions trapped in minerals as the fractures heal are characteristic of the fluids that formed them, and this signature can be seen in fluid inclusion gas analysis. Our hypothesis is that fractures over their life cycle have different chemical signatures that we can see in fluid inclusion gas analysis and by using the new method of fluid inclusion stratigraphy (FIS) the different stages of fractures, along with an estimate of fracture size can be identified during the well drilling process. We have shown with this study that it is possible to identify fracture locations using FIS and that different fractures have different chemical signatures however that signature is somewhat dependent upon rock type. Open, active fractures correlate with increase concentrations of CO2, N2, Ar, and to a lesser extent H2O. These fractures would be targets for further enhancement. The usefulness of this method is that it is low cost alternative to current well logging techniques and can be done as a well is being drilled.\n\nFluorine concentrations of ore fluids in the Illinois-Kentucky district: Evidence from SEM-EDS analysis of fluid inclusion decrepitates\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nKenderes, Stuart M.; Appold, Martin S.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nThe Illinois-Kentucky district is an atypical occurrence of Mississippi Valley-type (MVT) mineralization that consists predominantly of fluorite rather than metal sulfide minerals. A long-standing assumption for the predominance of fluorite in the Illinois-Kentucky district is that the ore fluids there were anomalously rich in dissolved fluorine compared to typical sedimentary brines and other MVT ore fluids. This hypothesis is based on the unusual close temporal and spatial association of fluorine-rich ultramafic igneous rocks to MVT mineralization in the district, high K and Sr concentrations in the igneous rocks and in MVT ore-hosted fluid inclusions, a significant mantle 3He/4He component in ore-hosted fluid inclusions, and reaction path models that show titration of a HF-rich fluid into sedimentary brine is capable of producing a fluorite-dominated MVT ore mineral assemblage. The purpose of the present study was to test this hypothesis more directly by determining the fluorine concentration of the Illinois-Kentucky ore fluid through SEM-EDS analysis of evaporative solute mounds resulting from thermal decrepitation of fluid inclusions hosted in sphalerite. All 26 evaporative solute mounds from Illinois-Kentucky sphalerite samples analyzed contained detectable concentrations of fluorine of 1-4 weight percent. Based on calibration to standard solutions and previously published fluid inclusion major element concentrations, these solute mound fluorine concentrations correspond to fluid inclusion fluorine concentrations of about 680-4300 ppm, indicating that the Illinois-Kentucky ore fluids were quite rich in fluorine compared to typical sedimentary brines, which have fluorine concentrations mainly on the order of 1's to 10's of ppm. In contrast, solute mounds from sphalerite-hosted fluid inclusions from the Tri-State district did not contain fluorine in excess of the detection limit. The detection limit equates to an aqueous fluorine concentration between 87 and\n\nHypersurface-homogeneous Universe filled with perfect fluid in f ( R ...\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nhomogeneous Universe filled with perfect fluid in the framework of f ( R , T ) theory of gravity (Harko et al, \\\\emph{Phys.

The use of a confocal micro-Raman apparatus allowed to obtain information on the fluid composition, in particular on the gas phase, minimizing the contributions of the host matrix to the Raman signal. The samples studied were collected from an area (Lepaguare mining district, Northern-Central Honduras) rich in ore deposits due to the Cenozoic magmatic activity, where the gold and sulphide mineralization is connected with a system of quartz veins (few decimetres thick) occurring in low-grade metamorphic rocks and produced by hydrothermal fluids. The quartz crystals present in the gold-rich veins often contain fluid inclusions. Four types of fluid inclusions have been observed, but their assemblage in the same clusters and fracture systems, as well as their comparable salinity and homogenization data, suggest that they have the same origin. Micro-thermometry and Raman spectroscopy provide a composition of the mineralizing fluids attributable to the system H(2)O-NaCl-KCl-CO(2)-CH(4), with temperature and pressure intervals of 210-413 degrees C and 1050-3850 bar, respectively. These data agree with an epigenetic origin of the gold deposit (depth < 6 km) related to granitoid or granodiorite intrusions associated to orogenic environments.\n\nPressure-temperature condition and hydrothermal-magmatic fluid evolution of the Cu-Mo Senj deposit, Central Alborz: fluid inclusion evidence\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEbrahim Tale Fazel\n\n2017-02-01\n\nThe Cu-Mo Senj deposit covering an area about 5 km2 is located in the central part of the Alborz Magmatic Arc (AMA. The Nb/Y versus Zr/TiO2 diagram (after Winchester and Floyd, 1977 illustrates a typical trend for the magmas in the Senj magmatic areaâstarting from basaltic and evolving to dacite/rhyodacitic compositions, with few data plotting in the alkali basalt field. Most of the igneous rocks plot within the medium- and high-K fields in the K2O versus SiO2 diagram. The igneous rocks from the Senj area define a typical high-K calc-alkaline on SiO2 versus K2O diagram (Le Maitre et al., 1989. All studied rocks show similar incompatible trace element patterns with an enrichment of large ion lithophile elements (LILE: K, Rb, Ba, Th and depletion of high field strength elements (HFSE: Nb and Ti, which are typical features of magmas from convergent margin tectonic settings (Pearce and Can, 1973. At least three veining stages namely QBC, QM, and QP which are related to alteration and mineralization are distinguished at the Senj mineralized area. Three distinct alteration assemblages including K-feldspar-biotite-sericite-quartz, quartz-sericite-K-feldspar-pyrite, and K-feldspar-biotite-sericite-quartz, are distinguishable with these veins. About 80 % of the copper at Senj is associated with the early QBC-stage veins, with another 5 to 15 % in the QM-and QP-stage veins. About 70 % of the molybdenite occur in QM veins. Discussion Fluid inclusion distribution, fluid chemistry, and homogenization behavior document that S2-type fluids are samples of magma-derived aqueous-saline fluids characterized by high salinity and temperature, and high Cu content. Such parental fluids scavenged Cu and Mo from the melt below and transported them to the hydrothermal system above. The increased abundance of S- and LV-types inclusion coinciding with the highest grade Cu mineralization (early QBC-stage veins at the Senj deposit suggests that brine-vapor unmixing and phase separation plays an\n\nAnalysis of I-Br-Cl in single fluid inclusions by LA-ICP-MS\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGiehl, C.; Fusswinkel, T.; Beermann, O.; Garbe-SchÃ¶nberg, D.; Scholten, L.; Wagner, T.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nHalogens are excellent tracers of hydrothermal fluid sources and in-situ LA-ICP-MS analysis of Cl and Br in single fluid inclusions has provided fundamentally new insight into hydrothermal fluid flow and ore formation. There is mounting evidence that enrichment and depletion of Br relative to Cl may be caused by a number of processes beyond seawater evaporation and halite dissolution which cannot be discriminated on the basis of Br/Cl ratios alone. Expanding the analytical capabilities of fluid inclusion LA-ICP-MS analysis to include iodine would allow to discern between selective and coupled enrichment processes of Cl, Br and I, even in geologically complex samples that are inaccessible to bulk extraction techniques. We present iodine concentration data determined by LA-ICP-MS analysis of synthetic fluid inclusions, using the Sca17 scapolite reference material for external standardization (Seo et al., 2011). Iodine concentrations in Sca17 were determined using the Durango apatite standard. Four starting solutions containing I (0.3, 1.5, 27, 78 Âµg/g), Br (941, 1403, 2868, 4275 Âµg/g), Na (30.7, 94.7 mg/g), and Cl (50, 137 mg/g) (analyzed by ICP-OES and ICP-MS at CAU Kiel) were prepared by dissolving reagent grade chemical powders in ultra-pure water. Spherical inclusions (up to 40 Âµm) were synthesized from the starting solutions in pre-cracked, HF-treated synthetic quartz crystals which were placed in gold capsules and equilibrated at 600Â°C, 100/200 MPa in cold seal pressure vessels. Fluid inclusion LA-ICP-MS analysis (University of Helsinki) yielded average I concentrations in excellent agreement with the starting solutions (27.3 Âµg/g Â± 14 %RSD for the 27 Âµg/g solution and 77.6 Âµg/g Â± 8.3 %RSD for the 78 Âµg/g solution). Average Br and I concentrations deviate less than 10 % from solution concentration values. For the low I concentration solutions, the synthetic inclusions were too small to detect I. Thus, given suitable standard materials and sufficient\n\nFluid Inclusion and Oxygen Isotope Constraints on the Origin and Hydrothermal Evolution of the Haisugou Porphyry Mo Deposit in the Northern Xilamulun District, NE China\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nQihai Shu\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The Haisugou porphyry Mo deposit is located in the northern Xilamulun district, northeastern China. Based on alteration and mineralization styles and crosscutting relationships, the hydrothermal evolution in Haisugou can be divided into three stages: an early potassic alteration stage with no significant metal deposition, a synmineralization sericite-chlorite alteration stage with extensive Mo precipitation, and a postmineralization stage characterized by barren quartz and minor calcite and fluorite. The coexistence of high-salinity brine inclusions with low-salinity inclusions both in potassic alteration stage (~440Â°C and locally in the early time of mineralization stage (380â320Â°C indicates the occurrence of fluid boiling. The positive correlations between the homogenization temperatures and the salinities of the fluids and the low oxygen isotopic compositions (Î´18Ofluid < 3â° of the syn- to postmineralization quartz together suggest the mixing of magmatic fluids with meteoric water, which dominated the whole mineralization process. The early boiling fluids were not responsible for ore precipitation, whereas the mixing with meteoric water, which resulted in temperature decrease and dilution that significantly reduced the metal solubility, should have played the major role in Mo mineralization. Combined fluid inclusion microthermometry and chlorite geothermometer results reveal that ore deposition mainly occurred between 350 and 290Â°C in Haisugou.\n\nChemical Signatures of and Precursors to Fractures Using Fluid Inclusion Stratigraphy\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLorie M. Dilley\n\n2011-03-30\n\nEnhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) are designed to recover heat from the subsurface by mechanically creating fractures in subsurface rocks. Open or recently closed fractures would be more susceptible to enhancing the permeability of the system. Identifying dense fracture areas as well as large open fractures from small fracture systems will assist in fracture stimulation site selection. Geothermal systems are constantly generating fractures (Moore, Morrow et al. 1987), and fluids and gases passing through rocks in these systems leave small fluid and gas samples trapped in healed microfractures. These fluid inclusions are faithful records of pore fluid chemistry. Fluid inclusions trapped in minerals as the fractures heal are characteristic of the fluids that formed them, and this signature can be seen in fluid inclusion gas analysis. This report presents the results of the project to determine fracture locations by the chemical signatures from gas analysis of fluid inclusions. With this project we hope to test our assumptions that gas chemistry can distinguish if the fractures are open and bearing production fluids or represent prior active fractures and whether there are chemical signs of open fracture systems in the wall rock above the fracture. Fluid Inclusion Stratigraphy (FIS) is a method developed for the geothermal industry which applies the mass quantification of fluid inclusion gas data from drill cuttings and applying known gas ratios and compositions to determine depth profiles of fluid barriers in a modern geothermal system (Dilley, 2009; Dilley et al., 2005; Norman et al., 2005). Identifying key gas signatures associated with fractures for isolating geothermal fluid production is the latest advancement in the application of FIS to geothermal systems (Dilley and Norman, 2005; Dilley and Norman, 2007). Our hypothesis is that peaks in FIS data are related to location of fractures.

The Tongkeng-Changpo mineralization consists of veins and stockworks in the upper levels and replacement stratiform orebodies (mantos) at lower levels. Based on textural relationships, three major mineralizing stages can be recognized: stage I with cassiterite, sulphides, stannite, tourmaline, and quartz; stage II with cassiterite, sulphides, sulphosalts, quartz, and calcite; and stage III with calcite as the main phase. The study of fluid inclusions has shown that there are two main fluid types: CO2 and NaCl-H2O. Homogenization temperatures are 270 to 365Â°C, 210 to 240Â°C, and 140 to 190Â°C for stages I, II, and III, respectively. Salinities range from 1 to 7 wt.% NaCl equiv. in the early ore stage and 3 to 10 wt.% NaCl equiv. in the late stages. Laser Raman Spectroscopy indicates that the inclusion fluids in stages I and II were of carbono-aqueous composition, with minor amounts of CH4 and H2S, whereas those in stage III were aqueous. Helium isotopic analyses of inclusion fluids indicate that the 3He/4He ratios in the ore veins are in between 1.2 to 2.9 Ra (Ra = 1.4 Ã 10-6, modern atmospheric ratio), and range from 1.6 to 2.5 Ra in the stratiform orebodies. This range of 3He/4He ratios is significantly higher than that of crustal fluids (0.01-0.05 Ra). The similar characteristics of fluid inclusions and their He isotopic composition, as well as age constraints, indicate that the ore veins and stratiform orebodies of the Tongkeng-Changpo deposit formed from the same hydrothermal system, likely related to granite intrusions of the Mesozoic Yanshanian tectono-thermal event. In addition, the high R/Ra ratios indicate a mantle contribution in the ore fluids.\n\nFluid inclusion study of the Witwatersrand gold-uranium ores\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nShepherd, T.J.\n\n1977-01-01\n\nFluid inclusions, preserved in quartz pebbles of the uraniferous and auriferous Precambrian oligomictic conglomerates of the Witwatersrand Basin, provide a unique insight into the genesis of the ores. Using differences in inclusion characteristics in conjunction with intra- and inter-deformational textures for adjacent pebbles, a distinction is made between pre- and post-depositional inclusions. Excluding those related to subsequent brittle fracture, the fo"
