        "text": "Ionically cross-linked poly(allylamine) as a stimulus-responsive underwater adhesive: ionic strength and pH effects.\n\nPubMed\n\nLawrence, Patrick G; Lapitsky, Yakov\n\n2015-02-03\n\nGel-like coacervates that adhere to both hydrophilic and hydrophobic substrates under water have recently been prepared by ionically cross-linking poly(allylamine) (PAH) with pyrophosphate (PPi) and tripolyphosphate (TPP). Among the many advantages of these underwater adhesives (which include their simple preparation and low cost) is their ability to dissolve on demand when exposed to high or low pH. To further analyze their stimulus-responsive properties, we have investigated the pH and ionic strength effects on the formation, rheology and adhesion of PAH/PPi and PAH/TPP complexes. The ionic cross-linker concentrations needed to form these adhesives decreased with increasing pH and ionic strength (although the complexes ceased to form when the parent solution pH exceeded ca. 8.5; i.e., the effective pKa of PAH). Once formed, their ionic cross-links were most stable (as inferred from their relaxation times) at near-neutral or slightly alkaline pH values (of roughly 6.5-9) and at low ionic strengths. The decrease in ionic cross-link stability within complexes prepared at other pH values and at elevated (150-300 mM) NaCl concentrations diminished both the strength and longevity of adhesion (although, under most conditions tested, the short-term tensile adhesion strengths remained above 10(5) Pa). Additionally, the sensitivity of PAH/PPi and PAH/TPP complexes to ionic strength was demonstrated as a potential route to injectable adhesive design (where spontaneous adhesive formation was triggered via injection of low-viscosity, colloidal PAH/TPP dispersions into phosphate buffered saline). Thus, while the sensitivity of ionically cross-linked PAH networks to pH and ionic strength can weaken their adhesion, it can also impart them with additional functionality, such as minimally invasive, injectable delivery, and ability to form and dissolve their bonds on demand.\n\nAdsorption of Eu(III) onto TiO2: effect of pH, concentration, ionic strength and soil fulvic acid.\n\nPubMed\n\nTan, Xiaoli; Fang, Ming; Li, Jiaxing; Lu, Yi; Wang, Xiangke\n\n2009-08-30\n\nThe effects of pH, initial Eu(III) concentration, ionic strength and fulvic acid (FA) on the adsorption of Eu(III) on TiO(2) are investigated by using batch techniques. The results indicate that the presence of FA strongly enhances the adsorption of Eu(III) on TiO(2) at low pH values. Besides, the adsorption of Eu(III) on TiO(2) is significantly dependent on pH values and independent of ionic strength. The adsorption of Eu(III) on TiO(2) is attributed to inner-sphere surface complexation. The diffuse layer model (DLM) is applied to simulate the adsorption data, and fits the experimental data well with the aid of FITEQL 3.2. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) is performed to study the species of Eu(III) adsorbed on the surfaces of TiO(2)/FA-TiO(2) hybrids at a molecular level, which suggest that FA act as \"bridge\" between Eu(III) and TiO(2) particles to enhance the ability to adsorb Eu(III) in solution.\n\nApplication of quartz crystal microbalance to study the impact of pH and ionic strength on protein-silicone oil interactions.\n\nPubMed\n\nDixit, Nitin; Maloney, Kevin M; Kalonia, Devendra S\n\n2011-06-30\n\nIn this study, we have used quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) to quantitate the adsorption of a protein on silicone oil coated surfaces as a function of protein concentration, pH and ionic strength using a 5 MHz quartz crystal. Protein adsorption isotherms were generated at different solution pH and ionic strengths. Surface saturation concentrations were selected from adsorption isotherms and used to generate adsorption profiles from pH 3.0 to 9.0, and at ionic strengths of 10 mM and 150 mM. At low ionic strength (10mM) and pH 5.0 (close to the isoelectric point of the protein), maximum adsorption of protein to the silicone oil surface was observed. At higher ionic strength (150 mM), no significant pH influence on adsorption was observed. QCM could be used as a reliable technique to study the binding of proteins to silicone oil coated surfaces.

If designed properly, the subsurface rock formations will lead this water back to the extraction well as heated brine. Proper monitoring of these geothermal reservoirs is essential for developing and maintaining the necessary level of productivity of the field. Chemical tracers are commonly used to characterize the fracture network and determine the connectivity between the injection and production wells. Currently, most tracer experiments involve injecting the tracer at the injection well, manually collecting liquid samples at the wellhead of the production well, and sending the samples off for laboratory analysis. While this method provides accurate tracer concentration data at very low levels of detection, it does not provide information regarding the location of the fractures which were conducting the tracer between wellbores. Sandia is developing a high-temperature electrochemical sensor capable of measuring tracer concentrations and pH downhole on a wireline tool. The goal of this effort is to collect real-time pH and ionic tracer concentration data at temperatures up to 225 Â°C and pressures up to 3000 psi. In this paper, a prototype electrochemical sensor and the initial data obtained will be presented detailing the measurement of iodide tracer concentrations at high temperature and pressure in a newly developed laboratory scale autoclave.\n\nSorption of triclosan onto activated carbon, kaolinite and montmorillonite: effects of pH, ionic strength, and humic acid.\n\nPubMed\n\nBehera, Shishir Kumar; Oh, Seok-Young; Park, Hung-Suck\n\n2010-07-15\n\nSorption of triclosan on three sorbents, viz., activated carbon, kaolinite and montmorillonite was studied as a function of pH, ionic strength and humic acid (HA) concentration through controlled batch experiments. Triclosan sorption was found to be higher in the acidic pH range, as varying pH showed significant influence on the surface charge of the sorbents and degree of ionization of the sorbate. Sorption capacity of the sorbents increased with an increase in the ionic strength of solution. At low pH (pH 3), the overall increase in triclosan sorption was 1.2, approximately 4 and 3.5 times, respectively for activated carbon, kaolinite and montmorillonite when ionic strength was increased from 1x10(-3) to 5x10(-1) M. Triclosan sorption onto activated carbon decreased from 31.4 to 10.6 mg g(-1) by increasing the HA concentration to 200 mg C L(-1). However, during sorption onto kaolinite and montmorillonite, the effect of HA was very complex probably due to (i) hydrophobicity (log K(ow)=4.76) of triclosan; and (ii) complexation of HA with triclosan. Though triclosan sorption onto activated carbon is higher, the potential of kaolinite and montmorillonite in controlling the transport of triclosan in subsurface environment can still be appreciable. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Solution pH and ionic strength are two key factors that affect the colloidal stability of protein solutions. In this work, we use a method based on the PEG-induced liquid-liquid phase separation to examine the effects of pH and ionic strength on the colloidal stability of IgG solutions. We found that at high ionic strength (â¥0.25M), the colloidal stability of most of our IgGs is insensitive to pH, and at low ionic strength (â¤0.15M), all IgG solutions are much more stable at pH 5 than at pH 7. In addition, the PEG-induced depletion force is less efficient in causing phase separation at pH 5 than at pH 7. In contrast to the native inter-protein interaction of IgGs, the effect of depletion force on phase separation of the antibody solutions is insensitive to ionic strength. Our results suggest that the long-range electrostatic inter-protein repulsion at low ionic strength stabilizes the IgG solutions at low pH. At high ionic strength, the short-range electrostatic interactions do not make a significant contribution to the colloidal stability for most IgGs with a few exceptions. The weaker effect of depletion force at lower pH indicates a reduction of protein concentration in the condensed phase. This work advances our basic understanding of the colloidal stability of IgG solutions and also introduces a practical approach to measuring protein colloidal stability under various solution conditions.\n\nResponse surface optimization of pH and ionic strength for emulsion characteristics of egg yolk.\n\nPubMed\n\nKurt, S; Zorba, O\n\n2009-11-01\n\nEffects of pH (3.5, 4.5, 6.0, 7.5, and 8.5) and ionic strength (0.05, 0.15, 0.30, 0.45, and 0.55 M NaCl) on emulsion capacity, emulsion stability (ES), apparent yield stress of emulsion (AYS), and emulsion density (ED) of egg yolk were studied by using a model system. Ionic strength and pH had significant (P < 0.01) effects on the emulsion characteristics of egg yolk. Their interaction effects also have been found significant on ES, AYS, and ED. Predicted solutions of ES, emulsion capacity, and ED were minimum. The critical point of ES was determined to be at pH 6.08 and an ionic strength of 0.49 (M NaCl). Predicted solution for AYS was a maximum, which was determined to be at pH 6.04 and an ionic strength of 0.29 (M NaCl). Optimum values of pH and ionic strenght were 4.61 to 7.43 and 0.10 to 0.47, respectively.\n\nState-of-the-Art pH Electrode Quality Control for Measurements of Acidic, Low Ionic Strength Waters.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nStapanian, Martin A.; Metcalf, Richard C.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nDescribed is the derivation of the relationship between the pH measurement error and the resulting percentage error in hydrogen ion concentration including the use of variable activity coefficients. The relative influence of the ionic strength of the solution on the percentage error is shown. (CW)\n\nNovel self-powered pH indicator using ionic polymeric gel muscles\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nShahinpoor, Mohsen\n\n1994-05-01\n\nA novel design for a torsional spring-loaded pH indicator using ionic polymeric gel fibrous muscles is presented. The essential parts of the proposed self-powered pH indicator are a pair of co-axial and concentric cylinders, an assembly of fibrous polyacrylonitrile (PAN) muscles, a torsional spring, and a dial indicator. The two co-axial cylinders are such that the inner cylinder may pivotally rotate about the central rotation axis that is fixed to the inner bottom or side of the outer cylinder. The outer cylinder also serves as a reservoir for any liquid whose pH is to be determined either statically or dynamically. The internal cylindrical drum is further equipped with a dial indicator on one of its outer end caps such that when a pH environment is present the contraction or expansion of the PAN fibers cause the inner drum to rotate and thus give a reading of the dial indicator. The motion of the dial indicator may also be converted to an electrical signal (voltage) for digital electronics display and computer control. A mathematical model is also presented for the dynamic response of the self-powered pH indicator made with contractile PAN fiber bundle assemblies.\n\nRenewable energy powered membrane technology: Impact of pH and ionic strength on fluoride and natural organic matter removal.\n\nPubMed\n\nOwusu-Agyeman, Isaac; Shen, Junjie; SchÃ¤fer, Andrea Iris\n\n2018-04-15\n\nReal water pH and ionic strength vary greatly, which influences the performance of membrane processes such as nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO). Systematic variation of pH (3-12) and ionic strength (2-10g/L as total dissolved solids (TDS)) was undertaken with a real Tanzanian water to investigate how water quality affects retention mechanisms of fluoride (F) and natural organic matter (NOM). An autonomous solar powered NF/RO system driven by a solar array simulator was supplied with constant power from a generator. An open NF (NF270) and a brackish water RO (BW30) membrane were used. A surface water with a very high F (59.7mg/L) and NOM (110mgC/L) was used. Retention of F by NF270 was <20% at pH <6, increased to 40% at pH6, and 60-70% at pH7-12, indicating a dominance of charge repulsion while being ineffective in meeting the guideline of 1.5mg/L. Increase in ionic strength led to a significant decline in retention of F (from 70 to 50%) and electrical conductivity (from 60 to 10%) by NF270, presumably due to charge screening. In contrast, BW30 retained about 50% of F at pH3, >80% at pH4, and about 99% at pH >5, due to the smaller pore size and hence a more dominant size exclusion. In consequence, only little impact of ionic strength increase was observed for BW30. The concentration of NOM in permeates of both NF270 and BW30 were typically <2mg/L. This was not affected by pH or ionic strength due to the fact that the bulk of NOM was rejected by both membranes through size exclusion. The research is carried out in the context of providing safe drinking water for rural and remote communities where infrastructure is lacking, and water quality varies significantly. While other studies focus on energy fluctuations, this research emphasises on feed water quality that affects system performance and may alter due to a number of environmental factors.

In the present investigation, the sorption-desorption of fipronil was studied in some soils at varying concentrations, ionic strengths, temperatures and pH values, and IR specta of fipronil sorbed onto soils were studied. The sorption of fipronil onto soils conformed to the Freundlich isotherm model. The sorption-desorption of fipronil varied with ionic strength in each of the soils. Sorption decreased but desorption increased with temperature. Sorption did not change with increasing pH, but for desorption there was no correlation. The cumulative desorption of fipronil from soil was significantly and inversely related to soil organic carbon content. IR spectra of sorbed fipronil showed the involvement of amino, nitrile, sulfone, chloro and fluoro groups and the pyrazole nucleus of the fipronil molecule. The sorption of fipronil onto soils appeared to be a physical process with the involvement of hydrogen bonding. An increase in soil organic carbon may help to reduce desorption of fipronil. High-temperature regimes are more conducive to the desorption. Â© 2015 Society of Chemical Industry.

The redox reaction of RFN is a pH-dependent process that requires no water. The electrode was fabricated using our previously described 'stuffing' method to entrap RFN into vapor phase polymerized poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene). The electrode is shown to be capable of measuring the proton activity in the form of an effective pH over a range of different water contents including nonaqueous systems and ionic liquids (ILs). This demonstrates that the entrapment of the redox center facilitates direct electron communication with the polymer. This work provides a miniaturizable system to determine pH (effective) in nonaqueous systems as well as in ionic liquids. The ability to measure pH (effective) is an important step toward the ability to customize ILs with suitable pH (effective) for catalytic reactions and biotechnology applications such as protein preservation.\n\nSorption of Th (IV) to silica as a function of pH, humic/fulvic acid, ionic strength, electrolyte type.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Changlun; Wang, Xiangke\n\n2007-02-01\n\nThe removal behavior of thorium (Th(IV)) has been investigated in multicomponent systems containing silica (SiO2) as the model of inorganic particles because of its widespread presence in the earth's crust and soil humic acid (HA)/fulvic acid (FA) by batch experiments. The influence of pH from 2 to 12, ionic strength from 0.02 to 0.2 M KNO3, soil HA/FA concentration from 8.3 to 22.5 mg/L, and foreign cations (Li+, Na+, K+) and anions (NO3(-), Cl-) on the sorption of Th(IV) onto SiO2 was also tested. The sorption isotherms of Th(IV) at approximately constant pH (3.50+/-0.02) were determined and analyzed regressively with three kinds of sorption isotherm models, i.e., linear, Langmuir, and Freundlich models. The results demonstrated that the sorption of Th(IV) onto SiO2 increased steeply with increasing pH from 2 to 4. Generally, humic substances (HSs) were shown to enhance Th(IV) sorption at low pH, but to reduce Th(IV) sorption at intermediate and high pH. It was a hypothesis that the significantly positive influence of HA/FA at pH from 2 to 4 on the sorption of Th(IV) onto SiO2 was attributed to strong surface binding of HA/FA on SiO2 and subsequently the formation of ternary surface complexes such as [triple bond]MO-O-HA-Th or [triple bond]MO-O-FA-Th. The results also demonstrated that the sorption was strongly dependent on the concentration of HA/FA, and independent of ionic strength and foreign ions under our experimental conditions.\n\nInfluence of pH, soil humic/fulvic acid, ionic strength, foreign ions and addition sequences on adsorption of Pb(II) onto GMZ bentonite.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Suowei; Hu, Jun; Li, Jiaxing; Dong, Yunhui\n\n2009-08-15\n\nThis work contributed to the adsorption of Pb(II) onto GMZ bentonite in the absence and presence of soil humic acid (HA)/fulvic acid (FA) using a batch technique. The influences of pH from 2 to 12, ionic strengths from 0.004M to 0.05M NaNO(3), soil HA/FA concentrations from 1.6 mg/L to 20mg/L, foreign cations (Li+, Na+, K+), anions (Cl(-), NO(3)(-)), and addition sequences on the adsorption of Pb(II) onto GMZ bentonite were tested. The adsorption isotherms of Pb(II) were determined at pH 3.6+/-0.1 and simulated with the Langmuir, Freundlich, and D-R adsorption models, respectively. The results demonstrated that the adsorption of Pb(II) onto GMZ bentonite increased with increasing pH from 2 to 6. HA was shown to enhance Pb(II) adsorption at low pH, but to reduce Pb(II) adsorption at high pH, whereas FA was shown to decrease Pb(II) adsorption at pH from 2 to 11. The results also demonstrated that the adsorption was strongly dependent on ionic strength and slightly dependent on the concentration of HA/FA. The adsorption of Pb(II) onto GMZ bentonite was dependent on foreign ions in solution. The addition sequences of bentonite/Pb(II)/HA had no effect on the adsorption of Pb(II).\n\nOn the pH of Aqueous Attoliter-Volume Droplets\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRamos, Kieran P.; Velpula, Samson S.; Demille, Trevor B.; Pajela, Ryan; Goldner, Lori S.\n\nDroplets of water dispersed in perfluorinated liquids have widespread use including microfluidics, drug delivery and single-molecule measurements. Perfluorinated liquids are distinctly biocompatible due to their stability, low surface tension, lipophobicity, and hydrophobicity. For this reason, the effect of the perfluorinated surface on droplet contents is usually ignored. However, as the droplet diameter is reduced, we expect that any effect of the water/oil interface on droplet contents will become more obvious. We studied the pH of attoliter-volume aqueous droplets in perfluorinated liquids using pH-sensing fluorescent dyes. Droplets were prepared either by sonication or extrusion from buffer and perfluorinated liquids (FC40 or FC77). A non-ionic surfactant was used to stabilize the droplets. Buffer strength, ionic strength, and pH of the aqueous phase were varied and resulting droplet pH compared to the pH of the buffer from which they were formed. Preliminary data are consistent with a pH in droplets that depends on the concentration of non-ionic surfactant. At low surfactant concentrations, the pH in droplets is distinctly lower than the stock buffer. However, as the concentration of non-ionic surfactant is increased the change in pH decreases. This work was funded by NSF/DBI-1152386.\n\nStability of Secondary and Tertiary Structures of Virus-Like Particles Representing Noroviruses: Effects of pH, Ionic Strength, and Temperature and Implications for Adhesion to Surfaces.\n\nPubMed\n\nSamandoulgou, Idrissa; Hammami, Riadh; Morales Rayas, Rocio; Fliss, Ismail; Jean, Julie\n\n2015-11-01\n\nLoss of ordered molecular structure in proteins is known to increase their adhesion to surfaces. The aim of this work was to study the stability of norovirus secondary and tertiary structures and its implications for viral adhesion to fresh foods and agrifood surfaces. The pH, ionic strength, and temperature conditions studied correspond to those prevalent in the principal vehicles of viral transmission (vomit and feces) and in the food processing and handling environment (pasteurization and refrigeration). The structures of virus-like particles representing GI.1, GII.4, and feline calicivirus (FCV) were studied using circular dichroism and intrinsic UV fluorescence. The particles were remarkably stable under most of the conditions. However, heating to 65Â°C caused losses of Î²-strand structure, notably in GI.1 and FCV, while at 75Â°C the Î±-helix content of GII.4 and FCV decreased and tertiary structures unfolded in all three cases. Combining temperature with pH or ionic strength caused variable losses of structure depending on the particle type. Regardless of pH, heating to pasteurization temperatures or higher would be required to increase GII.4 and FCV adhesion, while either low or high temperatures would favor GI.1 adhesion. Regardless of temperature, increased ionic strength would increase GII.4 adhesion but would decrease GI.1 adhesion. FCV adsorption would be greater at refrigeration, pasteurization, or high temperature combined with a low salt concentration or at a higher NaCl concentration regardless of temperature. Norovirus adhesion mediated by hydrophobic interaction may depend on hydrophobic residues normally exposed on the capsid surface at pH 3, pH 8, physiological ionic strength, and low temperature, while at pasteurization temperatures it may rely more on buried hydrophobic residues exposed upon structural rearrangement.

The T1 and T2 NMR relaxation times in gels depend predominantly on Xan concentration; the presence of PF has negligible influence on them. It is interesting that the matrix swelling is primarily regulated by Xan despite high drug loading (25%, 50%). The gastric pH and high ionic strength of the media do not influence the position of the penetration and swelling fronts but do affect the erosion front and gel thickness. The different release profiles obtained in mixing and nonmixing in vitro methods are the consequence of matrix hydration level and erosion at the surface. In water and in diluted acid medium with low ionic strength, the main release mechanism is erosion, whereas in other media (pH 1.2, Î¼ â¥ 0.20 M), anomalous transport dominates as was found out by fitting of measured data with theoretical model. Besides the in vitro investigation that mimics gastric conditions, mathematical modeling makes the product development more successful.\n\nIn-vitro investigations of a pH- and ionic-strength-responsive polyelectrolytic hydrogel using a piezoresistive microsensor\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchulz, Volker; Guenther, Margarita; Gerlach, Gerald; Magda, Jules J.; Tathireddy, Prashant; Rieth, Loren; Solzbacher, Florian\n\n2010-01-01\n\nEnvironmental responsive or smart hydrogels show a volume phase transition due to changes of external stimuli such as pH or ionic strength of an ambient solution. Thus, they are able to convert reversibly chemical energy into mechanical energy and therefore they are suitable as sensitive material for integration in biochemical microsensors and MEMS devices. In this work, micro-fabricated silicon pressure sensor chips with integrated piezoresistors were used as transducers for the conversion of mechanical work into an appropriate electrical output signal due to the deflection of a thin silicon bending plate. Within this work two different sensor designs have been studied. The biocompatible poly(hydroxypropyl methacrylate-N,N-dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate-tetra-ethyleneglycol dimethacrylate) (HPMA-DMA-TEGDMA) was used as an environmental sensitive element in piezoresistive biochemical sensors. This polyelectrolytic hydrogel shows a very sharp volume phase transition at pH values below about 7.4 which is in the range of the physiological pH. The sensor's characteristic response was measured in-vitro for changes in pH of PBS buffer solution at fixed ionic strength. The experimental data was applied to the Hill equation and the sensor sensitivity as a function of pH was calculated out of it. The time-dependent sensor response was measured for small changes in pH, whereas different time constants have been observed. The same sensor principal was used for sensing of ionic strength. The time-dependent electrical sensor signal of both sensors was measured for variations in ionic strength at fixed pH value using PBS buffer solution. Both sensor types showed an asymmetric swelling behavior between the swelling and the deswelling cycle as well as different time constants, which was attributed to the different nature of mechanical hydrogel-confinement inside the sensor. PMID:21152365\n\nEffect of various pH values, ionic strength, and temperature on papain hydrolysis of salivary film.\n\nPubMed\n\nYao, Jiang-Wu; Xiao, Yin; Lin, Feng\n\n2012-04-01\n\nStimulated human whole saliva (WS) was used to study the dynamics of papain hydrolysis at defined pH, ionic strength, and temperature with the view of reducing an acquired pellicle. A quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) was used to monitor the changes in frequency caused by enzyme hydrolysis of WS films, and the hydrolytic parameters were calculated using an empirical model. The morphological and conformational changes of the salivary films before and after enzymatic hydrolysis were characterized by atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging and grazing-angle Fourier transform infrared (GA-FTIR ) spectra, respectively. The characteristics of papain hydrolysis of WS films were pH-, ionic strength-, and temperature-dependent. The WS films were partially removed by the action of papain, resulting in thinner and smoother surfaces. The infrared data suggested that hydrolysis-induced deformation did not occur on the remnants of salivary films. The processes of papain hydrolysis of WS films can be controlled by properly regulating pH, ionic strength, and temperature.

We used the layer-by-layer (LBL) technique to assemble PEM of the polysaccharides heparin (a strong polyanion) and chitosan (a weak polycation) and characterized the sensitivity of the PEM composition and layer thickness to changes in processing parameters. Fourier-transform surface plasmon resonance (FT-SPR) and spectroscopic ellipsometry provided in situ and ex situ measurements of the PEM thickness, respectively. Vibrational spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) provided details of the chemistry (i.e., composition, electrostatic interactions) of the PEM. We found that when PEM were assembled from 0.2 M buffer, the PEM thickness could be increased from less than 2 nm per bilayer to greater than 4 nm per bilayer by changing the solution pH; higher and lower ionic strength buffer solutions resulted in narrower ranges of accessible thickness. Molar composition of the PEM was not very sensitive to solution pH or ionic strength, but pH did affect the interactions between the sulfonates in heparin and amines in chitosan when PEM were assembled from 0.2 M buffer. Changes in the PEM thickness with pH and ionic strength can be interpreted through descriptions of the charge density and conformation of the polyelectrolyte chains in solution.\n\nTransport and Retention of TiO2 Rutile Nanoparticles in Saturated Porous Media: Influence of Solution pH, Ionic Strength, and the Presence of Humic Acid\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nThe influence of solution pH, ionic strength, and varying concentrations of the Suwannee River Humic Acid (SRHA) on the transport of titanium dioxide (TiO2, rutile) nanoparticle aggregates (nTiO2) in saturated porous media was investigated through systematically examining the tra...\n\nImpact of multicomponent ionic transport on pH fronts propagation in saturated porous media\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMuniruzzaman, Muhammad; Rolle, Massimo\n\n2016-04-01\n\nMulticomponent ionic interactions have been increasingly recognized as important factors for the displacement of charged species in porous media under both diffusion- [1,2] and advection-dominated flow regimes [3,4]. In this study we investigate the propagation of pH fronts during multicomponent ionic transport in saturated porous media under flow-through conditions. By performing laboratory bench-scale experiments combined with numerical modeling we show the important influence of Coulombic effects on proton transport in the presence of ionic admixtures. The experiments were performed in a quasi two-dimensional flow-through setup under steady-state flow and transport conditions. Dilute solutions of hydrochloric acid with MgCl2 (1:2 strong electrolyte) were used as tracer solutions to experimentally test the effect of electrochemical cross-coupling on the migration of diffusive/dispersive pH fronts. We focus on two experimental scenarios, with different composition of tracer solutions, causing remarkably different effects on the propagation of the acidic fronts with relative differences in the penetration depth of pH fronts of 36% between the two scenarios and of 25% and 15% for each scenario with respect to the transport of ions at liberated state (i.e., without considering the charge effects). Also significant differences in the dilution of the distinct ionic plumes, quantified using the flux-related dilution index at the laboratory bench scale [5], were measured at the outflow of the flow-through system. The dilution of the pH plumes also changed considerably (26% relative difference) in the two flow-through experiments only due to the different composition of the pore water solution and to the electrostatic coupling of the ions in the flow-through setups. Numerical transport simulations were performed to interpret the laboratory experiments. The simulations were based on a multicomponent ionic formulation accurately capturing the Coulombic interactions between\n\nHumic Acid Effects on the Transport of Colloidal Particles in Unsaturated Porous Media: Humic Acid Dosage, pH, and Ionic Strength Dependence\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMorales, V. L.; Gao, B.; Steenhuis, T. S.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nSoil colloids and biocolloids can facilitate contaminant transport within the soil profile through the complexation of pollutants previously thought to have limited mobility. Dissolved organic substances are qualitatively known to alter the behavior of colloids and surface chemistry of soil particles in aquatic environments when adsorbed to their surfaces. Specifically, it has been observed that even small amounts of adsorbed humic acids result in a pronounced increase in colloid mobility in saturated porous systems, presumably by a combination of electrostatic and steric stabilization. However, the degree to which adsorbed humic acids stabilize colloidal suspension is highly sensitive to the system's solution chemistry; mainly in terms of pH, ionic strength, and metal ions present. The objective of this study is to expound quantitatively on the role that combined stabilizing and destabilizing solution chemistry components have on humic acid-colloid transport in unsaturated media by isolating experimentally some underlying mechanisms that regulate colloid transport in realistic aquatic systems. We hypothesize that in chemically heterogeneous porous media, with ionic strength values above 0 and pH ranges from 4 to 9, the effect of humic acid on colloid suspensions cannot be simply characterized by increased stability and mobility. That a critical salt concentration must exists for a given humic acid concentration and pH, above which the network of humic acid collapses by forming coordination complexes with other suspended or adsorbed humic acids, thus increasing greatly the retention of colloids in the porous medium by sweep flocculation. In addition, capillary forces in unsaturated media may contribute further to overcome repulsive forces that prevent flocculation of humic acid-colloid complexes. The experimental work in this study will include: jar tests to determine critical solution concentration combinations for desired coagulation/flocculation rates, column\n\nMobilization of natural colloids from an iron oxide-coated sand aquifer--Effect of pH and ionic strength\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nBunn, Rebecca A.; Magelky, Robin D.; Ryan, Joseph N.; Elimelech, Menachem\n\n2002-01-01\n\nField and laboratory column experiments were performed to assess the effect of elevated pH and reduced ionic strength on the mobilization of natural colloids in a ferric oxyhydroxide-coated aquifer sediment. The field experiments were conducted as natural gradient injections of groundwater amended by sodium hydroxide additions. The laboratory experiments were conducted in columns of undisturbed, oriented sediments and disturbed, disoriented sediments. In the field, the breakthrough of released colloids coincided with the pH pulse breakthrough and lagged the bromide tracer breakthrough. The breakthrough behavior suggested that the progress of the elevated pH front controlled the transport of the mobilized colloids. In the laboratory, about twice as much colloid release occurred in the disturbed sediments as in the undisturbed sediments. The field and laboratory experiments both showed that the total mass of colloid release increased with increasing pH until the concurrent increase in ionic strength limited release. A decrease in ionic strength did not mobilize significant amounts of colloids in the field. The amount of colloids released normalized to the mass of the sediments was similar for the field and the undisturbed laboratory experiments.\n\nEffects of ionic strength, temperature, and pH on degradation of selected antibiotics\n\nUSGS Publications Warehouse\n\nLoftin, K.A.; Adams, C.D.; Meyer, M.T.; Surampalli, R.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nAqueous degradation rates, which include hydrolysis and epimerization, for chlorretracycline (CTC), oxytetracycline (OTC), tetracycline (TET), lincomycin (LNC), sulfachlorpyridazine (SCP), sulfadimethoxine (SDM), sulfathiazole (STZ), trimethoprim (TRM), and tylosin A (TYL) were studied as a function of ionic strength (0.0015, 0.050, or 0.084 mg/L as Na2HPO4), temperature (7, 22, and 35??C), and pH (2, 5, 7, 9, and 11). Multiple linear regression revealed that ionic strength did not significantly affect (?? = 0.05) degradation rates for all compounds, but temperature and pH affected rates for CTC, OTC, and TET significandy (?? = 0.05). Degradation also was observed for TYL at pH 2 and 11. No significant degradation was observed for LNC, SCR SDM, STZ, TRM, and TYL (pH 5, 7, and 9) under study conditions. Pseudo first-order rate constants, half-lives, and Arrhenius coefficients were calculated where appropriate. In general, hydrolysis rates for CTC, OTC, and TET increased as pH and temperature increased following Arrhenius relationships. Known degradation products were used to confirm that degradation had occurred, but these products were not quantified. Half-lives ranged from less than 6 h up to 9.7 wk for the tetracyclines and for TYL (pH 2 and 11), but no degradation of LIN, the sulfonamides, or TRM was observed during the study period. These results indicate that tetracyclines and TYL at pH 2 and 11 are prone to pH-mediated transformation and hydrolysis in some cases, but not the sulfonamides, LIN nor TRM are inclined to degrade under study conditions. This indicates that with the exception of CTC OTC, and TET, pH-mediated reactions such as hydrolysis and epimerization are not likely removal mechanisms in surface water, anaerobic swine lagoons, wastewater, and ground water.

We find that the capacitance first increases with ion concentration following its expected ideal solution behavior but decreases upon approaching a pure ionic liquid in agreement with recent experimental observations. The nonmonotonic behavior of the capacitance as a function of ion concentration results from the competition between the independent motion of solvated ions in the dilute regime and solvation fluctuations in the concentrated regime. Mirroring the capacitance, we find that the characteristic decay length of charge density correlations away from the electrode is also nonmonotonic. The correlation length first decreases with ion concentration as a result of better electrostatic screening but increases with ion concentration as a result of enhanced steric interactions. When charge fluctuations induced by correlated ion-solvent fluctuations are large relative to those induced by the pure ionic liquid, such capacitive behavior is expected to be generic.\n\nChallenges in Determining Intrinsic Viscosity Under Low Ionic Strength Solution Conditions.\n\nPubMed\n\nPindrus, Mariya A; Shire, Steven J; Yadav, Sandeep; Kalonia, Devendra S\n\n2017-04-01\n\nTo determine the intrinsic viscosity of several monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) under varying pH and ionic strength solution conditions. An online viscosity detector attached to HPLC (ViscotekÂ®) was used to determine the intrinsic viscosity of mAbs. The Ross and Minton equation was used for viscosity prediction at high protein concentrations. Bulk viscosity was determined by a Cambridge viscometer. At 15Â mM ionic strength, intrinsic viscosity of the mAbs determined by the single-point approach varied from 5.6 to 6.4Â mL/g with changes in pH. High ionic strength did not significantly alter intrinsic viscosity, while a significant increase (up to 24.0Â mL/g) was observed near zero mM. No difference in bulk viscosity of mAb3 was observed around pH 6 as a function of ionic strength. Data analysis revealed that near zero mM ionic strength limitations of the single-point technique result in erroneously high intrinsic viscosity. Intrinsic viscosity is a valuable tool that can be used to model baseline viscosity at higher protein concentrations. However, it is not predictive of solution non-ideality at higher protein concentrations. Furthermore, breakdown of numerous assumptions limits the applicability of experimental techniques near zero mM ionic strength conditions. For molecules and conditions studied, the single-point approach produced reliable intrinsic viscosity results at 15Â mM. However, this approach must be used with caution near zero mM ionic strength. Data analysis can be used to reveal whether determined intrinsic viscosity is reliable or erroneously high.\n\nIgG1 adsorption to siliconized glass vials-influence of pH, ionic strength, and nonionic surfactants.\n\nPubMed\n\nHÃ¶ger, Kerstin; Mathes, Johannes; FrieÃ, Wolfgang\n\n2015-01-01\n\nIn this study, the adsorption of an IgG1 antibody to siliconized vials was investigated with focus on the formulation parameters pH, ionic strength, and nonionic surfactants. Electrophoretic mobility measurements were performed to investigate the charge characteristics of protein and siliconized glass particles at different pH values. Calculation of the electrokinetic charge density allowed further insight into the energetic conditions in the protein-sorbent interface. Maximum adsorption of IgG1 was found at acidic pH values and could be correlated with energetically favorable minimal ion incorporation into the interface. The importance of electrostatic interactions for IgG1 adsorption at acidic pH values was also confirmed by the efficient adsorption reduction at decreased solution ionic strength. A second adsorption maximum around the pI of the protein was assigned to hydrophobic interactions with the siliconized surface. Addition of the nonionic surfactants poloxamer 188 or polysorbate 80 resulted in almost complete suppression of adsorption at pH 7.2, and a strong but less efficient effect at pH 4 on siliconized glass vials. This adsorption suppression was much less pronounced on borosilicate glass vials. From these results, it can be concluded that electrostatic interactions contribute substantially to IgG1 adsorption to siliconized glass vials especially at acidic formulation pH.

By employing a mean field theory, we unravel a highly nonintuitive interplay of pH and electrolyte salt concentration in dictating the height of the end-charged PE brush. Larger pH or weak hydrogen ion concentration leads to maximum ionization of the charge-producing group-as a consequence, the resulting the electric double layer (EDL) energy get maximized causing a maximum deviation of the brush height from the value (d 0 ) of the uncharged brush. This deviation may result in enhancement or lowering of the brush height as compared to d 0 depending on whether the PE end locates lower or higher than h/2 (h is the nanochannel half height) and the salt concentration. Subsequently, we use this combined PE-brush-configuration-EDL-electrostatics framework to compute the ionic current in the nanochannel. We witness that the ionic current for smaller pH is much larger despite the corresponding magnitude of the EDL electrostatic potential being much smaller-this stems from the presence of a much larger concentration of H+ ions at small pH and the fact that H+ ions have very large mobilities. In fact, this ionic current shows a steep variation with pH that can be useful in exploring new designs for applications involving quantification and characterization of ionic current in PE-brush-grafted nanochannels.

The extraction behavior of neodymium(iii) from nitrate medium by these ionic liquids, diluted with the room temperature ionic liquids 1-hexyl-3-methylimidazolium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [C6mim][NTf2], 1-hexyl-3-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [C6mpyr][NTf2], and tributylmethylammonium bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide, [N1444][NTf2], was studied. The distribution ratio of neodymium(iii) was measured as a function of various parameters, such as pH, concentration of the ionic liquid extractant, nature of diluents, concentration of ionic liquid cations and nitrate anions in the aqueous phase. The extraction behavior was compared with that obtained for a solution of the molecular extractant bis(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid (DEHPA) in an ionic liquid diluent. The extraction of neodymium(iii) in the ionic liquids [C6mim][DEHP] and [C6mpyr][DEHP] showed markedly different extraction properties in comparison with that of the quaternary ammonium analogue [N4444][DEHP], especially concerning the pH dependence of the extraction process. These results show that the extraction process can be tuned by the selection of the ionic liquid cation. The extraction experiments also included the trivalent rare-earth ions lanthanum(iii), cerium(iii), praseodymium(iii), ytterbium(iii) and yttrium(iii). Studies of the stripping behavior and the reusability of the ionic liquids were carried out, which indicate that the ionic liquids can be reused with no loss in activity.\n\nThe pH and ionic composition of stratiform cloud water\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCastillo, Raymond A.; Jiusto, James E.; Mclaren, Eugene\n\nOver 50 cloud water samples were collected during five comprehensive case studies of the water chemistry of stratiform clouds at Whiteface Mountain, New York. The water samples were analyzed for pH, conductivity and ions of sodium, potassium, magnesium, calcium, ammonium, sulfate, chloride and nitrate. Trajectory analyses and cloud condensation nucleus concentrations at 0.5 % confirmed that the air masses in all five of these cases represented continental air that was relatively clean (low aerosol concentration) for the northeystern United States. The major ions related to cloud water pH were found to be sulfate, nitrate, potassium, ammonium and calcium. The results revealed a mean hydrogen ion concentration [ H+] = 0.239 meq â -1 ( Ï = Â± 0.21) which converts to a mean pH = 3.6 for all collected cloud samples. The low pH values are related to a normal background of nitrate ions found in the rural continental air masses plus sulfate ions largely from the industrial emissions of the midwestern United States. The [NO -3], in two of the three cases presented, demonstrates the importance of the nitrate ions' contribution to the pH of cloud water. A dependent means analysis of 40 events yielded a significant difference (0.04 level of significance), with the mean pH of precipitation (4.2) being greater than the mean pH of cloud water (4.0) for event samples. The ion concentrations indicated that the cloud rainout process contributed from 67 % to almost 100% of the total ion concentration of the precipitation. The washout process, i.e. precipitation scavenging below the cloud base, contributed considerably less than the cloud/rainout process of those total precipitation anions associated with air pollution.\n\nThe effect of humic acid on the aggregation of titanium dioxide nanoparticles under different pH and ionic strengths.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhu, Miao; Wang, Hongtao; Keller, Arturo A; Wang, Tao; Li, Fengting\n\n2014-07-15\n\nWith the increasingly widespread use of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs), the particles' environmental impacts have attracted concern, making it necessary to understand the fate and transport of TiO2 NPs in aqueous media. In this study, we investigated TiO2 NP aggregation caused by the effects of humic acid (HA), ionic strength (IS) and different pH using dynamic light scattering (DLS) to monitor the size distribution of the TiO2 NPs continuously. It was determined that HA can influence the stability of TiO2 NPs through charge neutralization, steric hindrance and bridging effects. In the absence of IS, aggregation was promoted by adding HA only when the pH (pH=4) is less than the point of zero charge for the TiO2 NPs (pHPZCâ6) because HA reduces the zeta potential of the TiO2 NPs via charge neutralization. At pH=4 and when the concentration of HA is 94.5 Î¼g/L, the zeta potential of TiO2 NPs is close to zero, and they reach an aggregation maximum. A higher concentration of HA results in more negatively charged TiO2 NP surfaces, which hinder their aggregation. When the pH is 5.8, HA enhances the negative zeta potential of the TiO2 NPs and increases their stability via electrostatic repulsion and steric hindrance. When the pH (pH=8) is greater than pHpzc, the zeta potential of the TiO2 NPs is high (~40 mV), and it barely changes with increasing HA concentration. Thus, the TiO2 NPs are notably stable, and their size does not grow at pH8. The increase in the critical coagulation concentration (CCC) of TiO2 NPs indicated that there is steric hindrance after the addition of HA. HA can enhance the coagulation of TiO2 NPs, primarily due to bridging effect. These findings are useful in understanding the size change of TiO2 NPs, as well as the removal of TiO2 NPs and HA from aqueous media. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, the impact of solution chemistry on naphthol polymerization and removal has not been documented. This research investigated the impact of pH and ionic strength on peroxidase-mediated removal of 1-naphthol in completely mixed batch reactors. The impact of hydrogen peroxide to 1-naphthol ratio and activity of horseradish peroxidase was also studied. Size exclusion chromatography was used to estimate the molecular weight distribution of oligomeric products, and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry was used to estimate product structure. Naphthol transformation decreased with ionic strength, and substrate removal was lowest at neutral pHs. Solution pH influenced the size and the composition of the oligomeric products. An equimolar ratio of H(2)O(2):naphthol was sufficient for optimal naphthol removal. Polymerization products included naphthoquinones and oligomers derived from two, three, and four naphthol molecules. Our results illustrate the importance of water chemistry when considering a peroxidase-based approach for treatment of naphthol-contaminated waters.\n\nEffect of soil humic and fulvic acids, pH and ionic strength on Th(IV) sorption to TiO2 nanoparticles.\n\nPubMed\n\nTan, Xiaoli; Wang, Xiangke; Chen, Changlun; Sun, Aihua\n\n2007-04-01\n\nThorium is considered as a chemical analog of other tetravalent actinides. Herein, the sorption of Th(IV) on TiO(2) in the presence or absence of soil fulvic acid (FA)/humic acid (HA) as a function of pH, ionic strength and FA/HA concentration has been studied by a batch method. The morphology was characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results indicate that sorption of Th(IV) on TiO(2) increases from 0% to approximately 94% at pH 1 approximately 4, and then maintains level with increasing pH values. Both FA and HA have a positive effect on Th(IV) sorption at low pH values and the contribution of FA on Th(IV) sorption is rather higher than that of HA at pH<4. The sorption is weakly dependent on the concentration of KNO(3) in solution, but the cations K(+), Na(+) and Li(+) influence Th(IV) sorption more obviously. The batch results indicate that the inner sphere complex formation is formed at bare surfaces or FA/HA-bound TiO(2) particle surfaces. Results of SEM analysis show that the particle sizes of TiO(2), Th-TiO(2) and Th-HA-TiO(2) colloids are quite different. Surface complexation may be considered as the main sorption mechanism.\n\nThe effect of pH and ionic strength of dissolution media on in-vitro release of two model drugs of different solubilities from HPMC matrices.\n\nPubMed\n\nAsare-Addo, Kofi; Conway, Barbara R; Larhrib, Hassan; Levina, Marina; Rajabi-Siahboomi, Ali R; Tetteh, John; Boateng, Joshua; Nokhodchi, Ali\n\n2013-11-01\n\nThe evaluation of the effects of different media ionic strengths and pH on the release of hydrochlorothiazide, a poorly soluble drug, and diltiazem hydrochloride, a cationic and soluble drug, from a gel forming hydrophilic polymeric matrix was the objective of this study. The drug to polymer ratio of formulated tablets was 4:1. Hydrochlorothiazide or diltiazem HCl extended release (ER) matrices containing hypromellose (hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC)) were evaluated in media with a pH range of 1.2-7.5, using an automated USP type III, Bio-Dis dissolution apparatus. The ionic strength of the media was varied over a range of 0-0.4M to simulate the gastrointestinal fed and fasted states and various physiological pH conditions. Sodium chloride was used for ionic regulation due to its ability to salt out polymers in the midrange of the lyotropic series. The results showed that the ionic strength had a profound effect on the drug release from the diltiazem HCl K100LV matrices. The K4M, K15M and K100M tablets however withstood the effects of media ionic strength and showed a decrease in drug release to occur with an increase in ionic strength. For example, drug release after the 1h mark for the K100M matrices in water was 36%. Drug release in pH 1.2 after 1h was 30%. An increase of the pH 1.2 ionic strength to 0.4M saw a reduction of drug release to 26%. This was the general trend for the K4M and K15M matrices as well. The similarity factor f2 was calculated using drug release in water as a reference. Despite similarity occurring for all the diltiazem HCl matrices in the pH 1.2 media (f2=64-72), increases of ionic strength at 0.2M and 0.4M brought about dissimilarity. The hydrochlorothiazide tablet matrices showed similarity at all the ionic strength tested for all polymers (f2=56-81). The values of f2 however reduced with increasing ionic strengths. DSC hydration results explained the hydrochlorothiazide release from their HPMC matrices. There was an increase in\n\nIonic pH and glucose sensors fabricated using hydrothermal ZnO nanostructures\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Jyh-Liang; Yang, Po-Yu; Hsieh, Tsang-Yen; Juan, Pi-Chun\n\n2016-01-01\n\nHydrothermally synthesized aluminum-doped ZnO (AZO) nanostructures have been adopted in extended-gate field-effect transistor (EGFET) sensors to demonstrate the sensitive and stable pH and glucose sensing characteristics of AZO-nanostructured EGFET sensors. The AZO-nanostructured EGFET sensors exhibited the following superior pH sensing characteristics: a high current sensitivity of 0.96 ÂµA1/2/pH, a high linearity of 0.9999, less distortion of output waveforms, a small hysteresis width of 4.83 mV, good long-term repeatability, and a wide sensing range from pHs 1 to 13. The glucose sensing characteristics of AZO-nanostructured biosensors exhibited the desired sensitivity of 60.5 ÂµAÂ·cm-2Â·mM-1 and a linearity of 0.9996 up to 13.9 mM. The attractive characteristics of high sensitivity, high linearity, and repeatability of using ionic AZO-nanostructured EGFET sensors indicate their potential use as electrochemical and disposable biosensors.\n\nStructure evolution of gelatin particles induced by pH and ionic strength.\n\nPubMed\n\nXu, Jing; Li, Tianduo; Tao, Furong; Cui, Yuezhi; Xia, Yongmei\n\n2013-03-01\n\nMicrostructure of gelatin particles played a key role in determining the physicochemical properties of gelatin. Ionic strength and pH as systematic manners were considered to affect gelatin particles structure on the micrometer scale. Scanning electron microscopy was used for depicting the morphologies of gelatin particles. Increasing pH to 10.0 or decreasing pH to 4.0, spherical, spindle, and irregular aggregates of gelatin particles at 2, 6, 10, and 14% solution (w/w) were all transformed to spindle aggregates. When NaCl was added to the system, the molecular chains of gelatin possibly rearranged themselves in a stretched state, and the ribbon aggregates was observed. The structural transitions of gelatin aggregates were strongly depended on the electrostatic repulsion. In the gelatin-sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) case, the micrometer scale of aggregates was larger and the different degrees of cross-links were induced through hydrophobic interaction and electrostatic repulsion.

The concentration field, flow field and electric field are strongly coupled via concentration dependent zeta potential, dielectric constant and electric conductivity. The results show that the electric field and the flow velocity are non-uniform when the concentration dependence of these parameters is taken into consideration. It is also found that when the ionic concentration of the electrolyte solution is higher than 1M, the electrolyte solution essentially cannot enter the channel due to the extremely low electroosmotic flow mobility. The effects of the concentration dependence of zeta potential, dielectric constant and electric conductivity on electroosmotic flow mixing are studied. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Natural diatomite has been tested as a potential sorbent for the removal of Th(IV) from aqueous solutions. The results indicate that sorption of Th(IV) is strongly dependent on ionic strength at pH<3, and is independent of ionic strength at pH>3. Outer-sphere complexation or ion exchange may be the main sorption mechanism of Th(IV) to diatomite at low pH values, whereas the sorption of Th(IV) at pH>3 is mainly dominated by inner-sphere complexation or precipitation. The competition for Th(IV) between aqueous or surface adsorbed anions (e.g., herein ClO(4)(-), NO(3)(-) and Cl(-)) and surface functional groups of diatomite is important for Th(IV) sorption. The thermodynamic data (DeltaH(0), DeltaS(0), DeltaG(0)) are calculated from the temperature-dependent sorption isotherms. The results suggest that sorption process of Th(IV) on diatomite is spontaneous and endothermic.\n\nFluorophotometric determination of critical micelle concentration (CMC) of ionic and non-ionic surfactants with carbon dots via Stokes shift.\n\nPubMed\n\nLavkush Bhaisare, Mukesh; Pandey, Sunil; Shahnawaz Khan, M; Talib, Abou; Wu, Hui-Fen\n\n2015-01-01\n\nA new and facile method for the determination of critical micelle concentration (CMC) of ionic and non-ionic surfactants is proposed in this article. Carbon dots exhibited substantial fluorescence and therefore enhanced the sensitivity of this evaluation. Understanding the formation of surfactant micelles is vital for the applications of biomedicine such as drug fabrication and smart molecular vehicles in delivering therapeutic dosage to various molecular sites. The fluorescence property of carbon dots was utilized for the first time to estimate the critical micelle concentration of surfactants. The central concept of the approach is based on the Stokes shift determination of a system composed of constant amount of carbon dots with varying concentrations of ionic and non-ionic surfactants. The synthesized carbon dots were characterized by FTIR, TEM, XRD, Raman, UV, and fluorescence spectroscope. The carbon dots were excited at 280 nm so as to obtain maximum emission for the Stokes shift measurement. The CMC value of cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), Triton X-100, dodecyldimethyl(3-sulfopropyl)ammonium hydroxide (SB-12) evaluated by this approach was found to be 0.98, 7.3, 0.19, and 3.5mM, respectively. The signals of spectra were assigned and explained in terms of both electron transitions between specific molecular orbital and the interaction with solvent. Copyright Â© 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A Monte Carlo simulation and ellipsometry study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHyltegren, Kristin; SkepÃ¶, Marie\n\n2017-05-15\n\nThe adsorbed amount of the polyelectrolyte-like protein histatin 5 on a silica surface depends on the pH and the ionic strength of the solution. Interestingly, an increase in ionic strength affects the adsorbed amount differently depending on the pH of the solution, as shown by ellipsometry measurements (Hyltegren, 2016). We have tested the hypothesis that the same (qualitative) trends can be found also from a coarse-grained model that takes all charge-charge interactions into account within the frameworks of Gouy-Chapman and Debye-HÃ¼ckel theories. Using the same coarse-grained model as in our previous Monte Carlo study of single protein adsorption (Hyltegren, 2016), simulations of systems with many histatin 5 molecules were performed and then compared with ellipsometry measurements. The strength of the short-ranged attractive interaction between the protein and the surface was varied. The coarse-grained model does not qualitatively reproduce the pH-dependence of the experimentally observed trends in adsorbed amount as a function of ionic strength. However, the simulations cast light on the balance between electrostatic attraction between protein and surface and electrostatic repulsion between adsorbed proteins, the deficiencies of the Langmuir isotherm, and the implications of protein charge regulation in concentrated systems.

J.; Wang, L.; Bardy, S. L.; Li, J.\n\n2010-12-01\n\nIn this research, we investigate the effects of starvation on the transport of E. coli K12 in saturated porous media. Particularly, we examine the relationship between such effects and the pH and ionic strength of the electrolyte solutions that were used to suspend bacterial cells. E. coli K12 (ATCC 10798) cells were cultured using either Luria-Bertani Miller (LB-Miller) broth (10 g trypton, 5 g yeast extract and 10 g NaCl in 1 L of deionized water) or LB-Luria broth (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast extract and 0.5 g NaCl in 1 L of deionized water). Both broths had similar pH (~7.1) but differed in ionic strength (LB-Miller: ~170 mM, LB-Luria: ~ 8 mM). The bacterial cells were then harvested and suspended using one of the following electrolyte solutions: phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (pH ~7.2; ionic strength ~170 mM), 168 mM NaCl (pH ~5.7), 5% of PBS (pH ~ 7.2; ionic strength ~ 8 mM) and 8 mM NaCl (pH ~ 5.7). Column transport experiments were performed at 0, 21 and 48 hours following cell harvesting to evaluate the change in cell mobility over time under âstarvationâ conditions. Our results showed that 1) starvation increased the mobility of E. coli K12 cells; 2) the most significant change in mobility occurred when bacterial cells were suspended in an electrolyte solution that had different pH and ionic strength (i.e., LB-Miller culture suspended in 8 mM NaCl and LB-Luria culture suspended in 168 mM Nacl); and 3) the change in cell mobility primarily occurred within the first 21 hours. The size of the bacterial cells was measured and the surface properties (e.g., zeta potential, hydrophobicity, cell-bound protein, LPS sugar content, outer membrane protein profiles) of the bacterial cells were characterized. We found that the measured cell surface properties could not fully explain the observed changes in cell mobility caused by starvation.\n\nEFFECTS OF PH, SOLID/SOLUTION RATIO, IONIC STRENGTH, AND ORGANIC ACIDS ON PB AND CD SOPRTION ON KAOLINITE\n\nEPA Science Inventory\n\nPotentiometric and ion-selective electrode titrations together with batch sorption/desorption experiments, were performed to explain the aqueous and surface complexation reactions between kaolinite, Pb, Cd and three organic acids.

Current methods for determining ionic calcium are not sensitive, overestimate ionic calcium, or require complex procedures. Molecular probes designed specifically for measuring ionic calcium could potentially be used to determine the ionic calcium content of skim milk. The goal of the current study was to develop foundation methods for future studies to determine ionic calcium directly in skim milk and other dairy products with molecular probes and fluorescence spectroscopy. In this study, the effect of pH on calcium-sensitive fluorescent probe (Rhod-5N and Fluo-5N) performance using various concentrations of skim milk was determined. The pH of diluted skim milk (1.9 to 8.9% skim milk), was adjusted to either 6.2 or 7.0, after which the samples were analyzed with fluorescent probes (1 microM) and front-face fluorescence spectroscopy. The ionic calcium content of each sample was also determined using a calcium ion-selective electrode. The results demonstrated that the ionic calcium content of each sample was highly correlated (R2 > 0.989) with the fluorescence intensities of the probe-calcium adduct using simple linear regression. Higher than suggested ionic calcium contents of 1,207 and 1,973 microM were determined with the probes (Fluo-5N and Rhod-5N) in diluted skim milk with pH 7.0 and 6.2, respectively. The fluorescence intensity of the probe-calcium adduct decreased with a decrease in pH for the same ionic calcium concentration. This study demonstrates that Fluo-5N and Rhod-5N can be used to determine the ionic-calcium content of diluted milk with front-face fluorescence spectroscopy. Furthermore, these probes may also have the potential to determine the ionic calcium content of undiluted skim milk.\n\nCounterion-induced swelling of ionic microgels\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDenton, Alan R.; Tang, Qiyun\n\n2016-10-01\n\nIonic microgel particles, when dispersed in a solvent, swell to equilibrium sizes that are governed by a balance between electrostatic and elastic forces. Tuning of particle size by varying external stimuli, such as pH, salt concentration, and temperature, has relevance for drug delivery, microfluidics, and filtration. To model swelling of ionic microgels, we derive a statistical mechanical theorem, which proves exact within the cell model, for the electrostatic contribution to the osmotic pressure inside a permeable colloidal macroion. Applying the theorem, we demonstrate how the distribution of counterions within an ionic microgel determines the internal osmotic pressure. By combining the electrostatic pressure, which we compute via both Poisson-Boltzmann theory and molecular dynamics simulation, with the elastic pressure, modeled via the Flory-Rehner theory of swollen polymer networks, we show how deswelling of ionic microgels with increasing concentration of particles can result from a redistribution of counterions that reduces electrostatic pressure. A linearized approximation for the electrostatic pressure, which proves remarkably accurate, provides physical insight and greatly eases numerical calculations for practical applications. Comparing with experiments, we explain why soft particles in deionized suspensions deswell upon increasing concentration and why this effect may be suppressed at higher ionic strength. The failure of the uniform ideal-gas approximation to adequately account for counterion-induced deswelling below close packing of microgels is attributed to neglect of spatial variation of the counterion density profile and the electrostatic pressure of incompletely neutralized macroions.\n\nEffects of temperature, pH, and ionic strength on the Henry's law constant of triethylamine\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nLeng, Chun-Bo; Roberts, Jason E.; Zeng, Guang; Zhang, Yun-Hong; Liu, Yong\n\n2015-05-01\n\nThe Henry's law constants (KH) of triethylamine (TEA) in pure water and in 1-octanol were measured for the temperatures pertinent to the lower troposphere (278-298 K) using a bubble column system coupled to a Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The KH values of TEA in water and 1-octanol at 298 K are 5.75 Â± 0.86 mol L-1 atm-1 and 115.62 Â± 5.78 mol L-1 atm-1. The KH values display strong dependence on temperature, pH, and ionic strength. The characteristic times for TEA to establish an equilibrium between gas and droplet with a size of 5.6 Âµm are ~33 s (298 K, pH = 5.6); ~8.9 Ã 102 s (278 K, pH = 5.6); ~1.3 Ã 103 s (298 K, pH = 4.0); and 3.6 Ã 104 s (278 K, pH = 4.0). The evaluation of TEA partitioning between gas phase and condensed phase implies that TEA predominantly resides in rainwater, and TEA loss to organic aerosol is negligible.\n\nCellulose ionics: switching ionic diode responses by surface charge in reconstituted cellulose films.\n\nPubMed\n\nAaronson, Barak D B; Wigmore, David; Johns, Marcus A; Scott, Janet L; Polikarpov, Igor; Marken, Frank\n\n2017-09-25\n\nCellulose films as well as chitosan-modified cellulose films of approximately 5 Î¼m thickness, reconstituted from ionic liquid media onto a poly(ethylene-terephthalate) (PET, 6 Î¼m thickness) film with a 5, 10, 20, or 40 Î¼m diameter laser-drilled microhole, show significant current rectification in aqueous NaCl. Reconstituted Î±-cellulose films provide \"cationic diodes\" (due to predominant cation conductivity) whereas chitosan-doped cellulose shows \"anionic diode\" effects (due to predominant anion conductivity). The current rectification, or \"ionic diode\" behaviour, is investigated as a function of NaCl concentration, pH, microhole diameter, and molecular weight of the chitosan dopant. Future applications are envisaged exploiting the surface charge induced switching of diode currents for signal amplification in sensing.\n\npH during non-synaptic epileptiform activity-computational simulations.\n\nPubMed\n\nRodrigues, AntÃ´nio MÃ¡rcio; Santos, Luiz Eduardo Canton; Covolan, Luciene; Hamani, Clement; de Almeida, AntÃ´nio-Carlos GuimarÃ£es\n\n2015-09-02\n\nThe excitability of neuronal networks is strongly modulated by changes in pH. The origin of these changes, however, is still under debate. The high complexity of neural systems justifies the use of computational simulation to investigate mechanisms that are possibly involved. Simulated neuronal activity includes non-synaptic epileptiform events (NEA) induced in hippocampal slices perfused with high-K(+) and zero-Ca(2+), therefore in the absence of the synaptic circuitry. A network of functional units composes the NEA model. Each functional unit represents one interface of neuronal/extracellular space/glial segments. Each interface contains transmembrane ionic transports, such as ionic channels, cotransporters, exchangers and pumps. Neuronal interconnections are mediated by gap-junctions, electric field effects and extracellular ionic fluctuations modulated by extracellular electrodiffusion. Mechanisms investigated are those that change intracellular and extracellular ionic concentrations and are able to affect [H(+)]. Our simulations suggest that the intense fluctuations in intra and extracellular concentrations of Na(+), K(+) and Cl(-) that accompany NEA are able to affect the combined action of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger (NHE), [HCO(-)(3)]/Cl(-) exchanger (HCE), H(+) pump and the catalytic activity of intra and extracellular carbonic anhydrase. Cellular volume changes and extracellular electrodiffusion are responsible for modulating pH.\n\nEffect of pH and nitrite concentration on nitrite oxidation rate.\n\nPubMed\n\nJimÃ©nez, E; GimÃ©nez, J B; Ruano, M V; Ferrer, J; Serralta, J\n\n2011-10-01\n\nThe effect of pH and nitrite concentration on the activity of the nitrite oxidizing bacteria (NOB) in an activated sludge reactor has been determined by means of laboratory batch experiments based on respirometric techniques. The bacterial activity was measured at different pH and at different total nitrite concentrations (TNOâ). The experimental results showed that the nitrite oxidation rate (NOR) depends on the TNOâ concentration independently of the free nitrous acid (FNA) concentration, so FNA cannot be considered as the real substrate for NOB. NOB were strongly affected by low pH values (no activity was detected at pH 6.5) but no inhibition was observed at high pH values (activity was nearly the same for the pH range 7.5-9.95). A kinetic expression for nitrite oxidation process including switch functions to model the effect of TNOâ concentration and pH inhibition is proposed. Substrate half saturation constant and pH inhibition constants have been obtained. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Micropolarity, microviscosity, critical micellar concentration of these micelles based on steady state absorption and fluorescence and time resolved emission spectroscopy of the probe DMANAN show that the molecule resides in the micelle-water interface for ionic micelles and in the core for the non-ionic micelle. The effect of variation of pH of the micellar solution as well as fluorescence quenching measurements of DMANAN provide further support for the location of the probe in the micelles.\n\nInfluence of ionic strength and OH(-) ion concentration on the Cu(II) complex formation with EDTA in alkaline solutions.\n\nPubMed\n\nNorkus, E; Vaskelis, A; Zakaite, I\n\n1996-03-01\n\nD.c. polarographic data show that the complex formation of copper ions with EDTA depends markedly on the ionic strength of the solution at pH 8-10. This is primarily associated with the dependence of the fourth deprotonization constant of EDTA on the solution ionic strength: when it increases from 0.4 to 3.4, the pK(a4) value decreases from 9.5 to 8.2. According to polarographic and spectrophotometric data the degree of Cu(II) complexation increases at pH>10 due to transformation of the complex CuY(2-) to the more stable CuY(OH)(3-) (Y(4-), a fully deprotonized anion of EDTA), but it decreases with increase in alkalinity in a highly alkaline solution (pH>13.5). The latter result could be explained by the decrease in the EDTA anion activity. The calculated values of the activity coefficient are lower than 0.05 at pH>14.\n\nCation effect on small phosphonium based ionic liquid electrolytes with high concentrations of lithium salt\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Fangfang; Kerr, Robert; Forsyth, Maria\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIonic liquid electrolytes with high alkali salt concentrations have displayed some excellent electrochemical properties, thus opening up the field for further improvements to liquid electrolytes for lithium or sodium batteries. Fundamental computational investigations into these high concentration systems are required in order to gain a better understanding of these systems, yet they remain lacking. Small phosphonium-based ionic liquids with high concentrations of alkali metal ions have recently shown many promising results in experimental studies, thereby prompting us to conduct further theoretical exploration of these materials. Here, we conducted a molecular dynamics simulation on four small phosphonium-based ionic liquids with 50 mol. % LiFSI salt, focusing on the effect of cation structure on local structuring and ion diffusional and rotational dynamicsâwhich are closely related to the electrochemical properties of these materials.\n\nForces of interactions between bare and polymer-coated iron and silica: effect of pH, ionic strength, and humic acids.\n\nPubMed\n\nPensini, Erica; Sleep, Brent E; Yip, Christopher M; O'Carroll, Denis\n\n2012-12-18\n\nThe interactions between a silica substrate and iron particles were investigated using atomic force microscopy-based force spectroscopy (AFM). The micrometer- and nanosized iron particles employed were either bare or coated with carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), a polymer utilized to stabilize iron particle suspensions. The effect of water chemistry on the forces of interaction was probed by varying ionic strength (with 100 mM NaCl and 100 mM CaClâ) or pH (4, 5.5, and 8) or by introducing 10 mg/L of humic acids (HA). When particles were uncoated, the forces upon approach between silica and iron were attractive at pH 4 and 5.5 and in 100 mM CaClâ at pH 8, but they were negligible in 100 mM NaCl buffered to pH 8 and repulsive in water buffered to pH 8 and in HA solutions. HA produced electrosteric repulsion between iron particles and silica, likely due to its sorption to iron particles. HA sorption to silica was excluded on the basis of experiments conducted with a quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring. Repulsion with CMC-coated iron was attributed to electrosteric forces, which were damped at high ionic strength. An extended DLVO model and a modified version of Ohshima's theory were successfully utilized to model AFM data.\n\nAdsorption of sulfamethoxazole by magnetic biochar: Effects of pH, ionic strength, natural organic matter and 17Î±-ethinylestradiol.\n\nPubMed\n\nReguyal, Febelyn; Sarmah, Ajit K\n\n2018-07-01\n\nRecent studies have shown the widespread occurrence of pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment leading to increasing global concern on their potential adverse effects in the environment and public health. In this study, we evaluated the use of magnetic biochar derived from pine sawdust, one of New Zealand's major wood wastes, to remove an emerging contaminant, sulfamethoxazole (SMX), at different pH, ionic strength, natural organic matter (NOM) and a competing compound, 17Î±-ethinylestradiol (EE2). In single-solute system, the sorption of SMX onto magnetic biochar was found to be highly pH-dependent and slightly increased with increase in ionic strength. However, the effects of pH, ionic strength and NOM were relatively insignificant compared to the sorption inhibition caused by EE2 in binary-solute system. Both SMX and EE2 sorption onto the highly carbonised biochar in magnetic biochar were postulated to be due to the Ï-Ï electron donor acceptor and hydrophobic interaction. EE2 is more hydrophobic than SMX. Hence, strong competition between these compounds was identified where EE2 markedly inhibited the sorption of SMX onto magnetic biochar in all artificial environmental conditions studied.

The results (K(d) values from the first slice and theoretical calculation, apparent and effective diffusion coefficients) derived from the new capillary method are in good agreement with the literature data under similar conditions, and fit the Fick's second law very well. The results suggest that the diffusion of Eu(III) is dependent on pH values and independent on solution concentration in our experimental conditions. Humic acid forms precipitation/complexation with Eu(III) at the surface of compacted bentonite and thus deduces the diffusion/transport of Eu(III) in compacted bentonite. The K(d) values in compacted bentonite are in most cases lower than those in powdered bentonite obtained from batch experiments. The difference between the K(d) values from powdered and compacted bentonite is a strong function of the bulk density of the bentonite. The results suggest that the content of interlaminary space plays a very important role to the diffusion, sorption and migration of Eu(III) in compacted bentonite.\n\nIonic conduction and self-diffusion near infinitesimal concentration in lithium salt-organic solvent electrolytes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAihara, Yuichi; Sugimoto, Kyoko; Price, William S.; Hayamizu, Kikuko\n\n2000-08-01\n\nThe Debye-HÃ¼ckel-Onsager and Nernst-Einstein equations, which are based on two different conceptual approaches, constitute the most widely used equations for relating ionic conduction to ionic mobility. However, both of these classical (simple) equations are predictive of ionic conductivity only at very low salt concentrations. In the present work the ionic conductivity of four organic solvent-lithium salt-based electrolytes were measured. These experimental conductivity values were then contrasted with theoretical values calculated using the translational diffusion (also known as self-diffusion or intradiffusion) coefficients of all of the species present obtained using pulsed-gradient spin-echo (1H, 19F and 7Li) nuclear magnetic resonance self-diffusion measurements. The experimental results verified the applicability of both theoretical approaches at very low salt concentrations for these particular systems as well as helping to clarify the reasons for the divergence between theory and experiment. In particular, it was found that the correspondence between the Debye-HÃ¼ckel-Onsager equation and experimental values could be improved by using the measured solvent self-diffusion values to correct for salt-induced changes in the solution viscosity. The concentration dependence of the self-diffusion coefficients is discussed in terms of the Jones-Dole equation.\n\nControl of intracellular ionic concentrations by mid-infrared laser irradiation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTakebe, G.; Yamauchi, T.; Shimizu, Y.; Dougakiuchi, T.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nWe successfully induced intracellular ion concentration changes in live culture cells using mid-infrared laser irradiation. The laser used for irradiation was a quantum cascade laser with a wavelength of 6.1 micrometers. We tuned the power of the laser to be between 30 to 60 mW at the sample. Cell lines, namely HeLa and Chinese hamster ovary cell lines, were used. They were cultured on specially fabricated silicon-bottom dishes. Live cells were stained using ion-sensitive dyes such as Calcium Green-1. The mid-infrared light was incident on the cell samples from the bottom of the dish through the silicon plate, and fluorescence imaging of the ion concentrations was performed using an upright fluorescence microscope placed on top of the sample stage. The mid-infrared lasers were operated in the continuous wave mode and light irradiations onto the cells were temporally controlled using a mechanical shutter in a periodical on-and-off pattern in the second timescale. The cells showed oscillations in their ionic concentration, which was synchronized with the periodical mid-infrared irradiation, and the threshold power needed for evoking the ion concentration change was dependent on the cell types and ion species. These results demonstrated that mid-infrared light directly changed the ionic response within cells and had the ability to change cell functions.\n\nEffect of pH on ion current through conical nanopores\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChander, M.; Kumar, R.; Kumar, S.; Kumar, N.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nHere, we examined ionic current behavior of conical nanopores at different pH and a fixed ion concentration of potassium halide (KCl). Conical shaped nanopores have been developed by chemical etching technique in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) membrane/foil of thickness 12 micron. For this we employed a self-assembled electrochemical cell having two chambers and the foil was fitted in the centre of cell. The nanopores were produced in the foil using etching and stopping solutions. The experimental results show that ionic current rectification (ICR) occurs through synthesized conical nanopores. Further, ion current increases significantly with increase of voltage from the base side of nanopores to the tip side at fixed pH of electrolyte.\n\n21 CFR 868.1170 - Indwelling blood hydrogen ion concentration (pH) analyzer.\n\nCode of Federal Regulations, 2011 CFR\n\n2011-04-01\n\n... 21 Food and Drugs 8 2011-04-01 2011-04-01 false Indwelling blood hydrogen ion concentration (pH...

The morphology and stability of the AgNPs was analyzed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), dynamic light scattering (DLS) and zeta potential measurements. The percentage conversion of the initial [Ag(+)] to [AgNPs] was determined from a combination of atomic absorption (AAS) and UV-Vis spectroscopy, and centrifugation techniques. The results indicate higher AgNP transport and consequently low deposition in the porous media at basic pH conditions and low ionic strength. However, at low acidic pH and high ionic strength, especially with the divalent metallic cations, the mobility of the AgNPs in the porous media was very low, most likely due to NP aggregation. Overall, the results suggest the potential for AgNP contamination of subsurface soils and groundwater aquifers is mostly dependent on their aggregation state, controlled by the soil water and sediment ionic strength and pH.

On the basis of chemical analyses of the water, and either laboratory or field determinations of pH, temperature, and dissolved oxygen, the program calculates the equilibrium distribution of major inorganic aqueous species and of inorganic aluminum complexes. The concentration of the organic anion is estimated from the dissolved organic concentration. Ionic ferrous iron is calculated from the dissolved oxygen concentration. Ionic balances and comparisons of computed with measured specific conductances are performed as checks on the analytical accuracy of chemical analyses. ARCHEM may be tailored easily to fit different sampling protocols, and may be run on multiple sample analyses.

The cropland system was exposed to acid rain by spraying the wheat foliage and irrigating the soil with simulated rainwater of T1 (pH 6.0), T2 (pH 6.0, ionic concentration was twice as rainwater T1), and T3 (pH 4.4, ionic concentration was twice as rainwater T1), respectively. The static opaque chamber-gas chromatograph method was used to measure CO2 fluxes from cropland system. The results showed that acid rain affected the respiration rate of cropland system through crop plant, and the cropland system could adapt to acid rain. Acid rainwater significantly increased the average respiration rate in alkaline soil (S3) cropland system, while it had no significant effects on the average respiration rate in neutral soil (S2) and acidic soil (S1) cropland systems. During 2005-2006, after the alkaline soil cropland system was treated with rainwater T3, the average respiration rate was 23.6% and 27.6% higher than that of alkaline soil cropland system treated with rainwater T1 and T2, respectively. During March to April, the respiration rate was enhanced with the increase of rainwater ionic concentration, while it was dropped with the decrease of rainwater pH value in acidic soil cropland system. It was demonstrated that soil pH and crop plant played important roles on the respiration rate of cropland system.\n\nThe effect of intact talin and talin tail fragment on actin filament dynamics and structure depends on pH and ionic strength.\n\nPubMed\n\nGoldmann, W H; Hess, D; Isenberg, G\n\n1999-03-01\n\nWe employed quasi-elastic light scattering and electron microscopy to investigate the influence of intact talin and talin tail fragment on actin filament dynamics and network structure. Using these methods, we confirm previous reports that intact talin induces cross-linking as well as filament shortening on actin networks. We now show that the effect of intact talin as well as talin tail fragment on actin networks is controlled by pH and ionic strength. At pH 7.5, actin filament dynamics in the presence of intact talin and talin tail fragment are characterized by a rapid decay of the dynamic structure factor and by a square root power law for the stretched exponential decay which is in contrast with the theory for pure actin solutions. At pH 6 and low ionic strength, intact talin cross-links actin filaments more tightly than talin tail fragment. Talin head fragment showed no effect on actin networks, indicating that the actin binding sites reside probably exclusively within the tail domain.\n\nThe Role of Ionic Interactions in the Adherence of the S. epidermidis Adhesin SdrF to Prosthetic Material\n\nPubMed Central\n\nToba, Faustino A.; Visai, Livia; Trivedi, Sheetal; Lowy, Franklin D.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nStaphylococcus epidermidis infections are common complications of prosthetic device implantation. SdrF, a surface protein, appears to play a critical role in the initial colonization step by adhering to type I collagen and Dacronâ¢. The role of ionic interactions in S. epidermidis adherence to prosthetic material was examined. SdrF was cloned and expressed in Lactococcus lactis. The effect of pH, cation concentration and detergents on adherence to different types of plastic surfaces was assessed by crystal violet staining and bacterial cell counting. SdrF, in contrast with controls and other S. epidermidis surface proteins, bound to hydrophobic materials such as polystyrene. Binding was an ionic interaction and was affected by surface charge of the plastic, pH and cation concentration. Adherence of the SdrF construct was increased to positively charged plastics and was reduced by increasing concentrations of Ca2+ and Na+. Binding was optimal at pH 7.4. Kinetic studies demonstrated that the SdrF B domain, as well as one of the B subdomains was sufficient to mediate binding. The SdrF construct also bound more avidly to Goretexâ¢ than the lacotococcal control. SdrF is a multifunctional protein that contributes to prosthetic devices infections by ionic, as well as specific receptor-ligand interactions.

F1 tablets were prepared using blends of high and low viscosity grades of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC K4M and K100LV, respectively), while F2 tablets were prepared from HPMC K4M and PEGylated glyceryl behenate (Compritol Â® HD5 ATO). The two formulations attained release profiles of QF over 24âh similar to that of Seroquel Â® XR using the dissolution medium published by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). A series of solubility and in vitro dissolution studies was then carried out using media that simulate the gastric and intestinal fluids and cover the physiological pH, buffer capacity and ionic strength range of the GIT. Solubility studies revealed that QF exhibits a typical weak base pH-dependent solubility profile and that the solubility of QF increases with increasing the buffer capacity and ionic strength of the media. The release profiles of QF from F1, F2 and Seroquel Â® XR tablets were found to be influenced by the pH, buffer capacity and ionic strength of the dissolution media to varying degrees. Results highlight the importance of studying the physiological variables along the GIT in designing controlled release formulations for more predictive in vitro-in vivo correlations.\n\nChanges in the quaternary structure of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase induced by ionic strength affect its catalytic activity.\n\nPubMed\n\nWagner, R; Gonzalez, D H; Podesta, F E; Andreo, C S\n\n1987-05-04\n\nPhosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase from maize leaves dissociated into dimers and/or monomers when exposed to increasing ionic strength (e.g. 200-400 mM NaCl) as indicated by gel filtration experiments. Changes in the oligomerization state were dependent on pH, time of preincubation with salt and protein concentration. A dissociation into dimers and monomers was observed at pH 8, while at pH 7 dissociation into the dimeric form only was observed. Exposure of the enzyme to higher ionic strength decreased the activity in a time-dependent manner. Turnover conditions and glucose 6-phosphate protected the carboxylase from the decay in activity, which was faster at pH 7 than at pH 8. The results suggest that changes in activity"
