Sustainable development has become more widely received and promoted in many parts of the world. The need is now critical for earth and environmental scientists and engineers to work together to implement technologies that can preserve our environment. The Earth’s population was 6.6 billion as of April 2007 according to the U.S. Census Bureau. This number is expected to rise to 9.4 billion by 2050. The population is increasing the demand for natural resources and energy, and increasing stress on the environment. Thus, protection of the environment and remediation of damage to the environment must be a priority. It is also important to develop procedures that will help to avert further damage to the environment and to recognize as early as possible the risks associated with changes in the environment. Many methodologies and technologies have become more advanced in the past few decades, and new technologies and approaches have been developed, all to address the growing need for environmental assessment, monitoring, and remediation. As these technologies have grown, the need for interdisciplinary cooperation has also become more apparent. Specialists in remote sensing, geophysical methods, hydrogeology, geology, and geochemistry must maintain current awareness of developments within their sister disciplines in order to formulate effective overall approaches for environmental issues. Too often, resolution of environmental problems is constrained by political or economic boundaries. In many parts of the world, standards for acceptable air, water, and soil quality must be compromised in order to meet more pressing human needs. It is therefore important that cost-effective interdisciplinary solutions be developed, in order to allow all nations and socio-economic groups to benefit from a clean, sustainable environment. Economic development is ultimately limited by environmental quality. Water is needed for all aspects of life. All social and economic activities depend on having a reliable supply of high quality water. As populations grow and economic activity increases, many countries are rapidly confronted with the problem of water scarcity, which limits economic development. More than 1 billion people, mainly in the developing countries, lack an adequate supply of safe drinking water. By 2050, 25 percent of the people on Earth will live in countries in which water is permanently scarce. Contaminated drinking water is a major cause of disease and death in developing countries. An adequate water supply is a prerequisite for human existence, not only for drinking, but also for agriculture. Degradation of soils also poses a direct threat to food production in developing countries. The availability of arable land is decreasing. Population growth is complicating the situation. According to the\n\nXXVI\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), there are more refugees from a deteriorating environment than from war. Others warn that water quality will play a growing role in regional conflicts and wars. High quality water and uncontaminated soil must be given greater priority throughout the world. This book, Environmental Geology - Handbook of Field Methods and Case Studies, is intended to enable progress toward these challenging goals. It provides a broad spectrum of investigatory methods in several disciplines to support cross-fertilization among experts in those disciplines and others. Methods that are treated in this book include remote sensing, geophysics, geology, hydrogeology, geochemistry, and microbiology. Most of the methods described in this handbook are available and used in developing countries. Information is provided about the principle of the method, possible applications, fundamentals, instruments, survey practice, processing and interpretation of the data, quality assurance, personnel, equipment, and time needed. Examples are given, as well as references and sources for further reading. Besides geoscientific methods, the procedures for stepwise site investigations are described, as well as common problems encountered in field operations. This handbook is not intended to be used as a textbook, but instead as a reference, providing insights into the fundamentals, application and limits of methods. Interdisciplinary case studies from different parts of the world have been selected as examples for extrapolation to other geoenvironmental concerns. With this structure the handbook can be used as a practical guide for training students. The descriptions of the methods and case studies also illustrate the advantages of interdisciplinary geoscientific site investigations to decisionmakers who deal with environmental investigations. This applies to both remediation assessments and preventative measures. Thorough and knowledgeable application of such an approach will enhance its reliability, credibility, and value to future generations. William E. Doll Oak Ridge, 2007\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 1 Introduction\n\n1\n\n1 Introduction KLAUS KNÖDEL, GERHARD LANGE & HANS-JÜRGEN VOIGT\n\nIncreasing population density and industrialization are creating a high strain on the natural environment and resources of many countries. Therefore, precautionary measures to protect the environment and remedial action to repair the damages of the past have high priority. Resources to be protected are surface water and groundwater, soil and air. Hazards to these resources are landfills and industrial sites as well as mining facilities, including tailings, conditioning plants, and smelters, oil refineries, distribution facilities and pipelines, gas stations and other areas used by humans (e.g., military training sites). Waste disposal, mining, and industrial sites are an absolutely necessary part of the infrastructure of an industrial society. Suitable new sites must be found for the disposal of waste and for mining and industrial facilities. It is often very difficult to obtain political approval and this is possible only if state-of-the-art methods are used to show that such sites have layers that can function as barrier, preventing entry of contaminants into the environment. Areas of both consolidated and unconsolidated rock can be suitable sites for landfills and industrial facilities. Knowledge and experience with the disposal of waste and the operation of mines and industrial facilities in an ecologically nondetrimental way have been acquired only gradually during the past several decades. On the basis of this knowledge, numerous abandoned landfills, mining, and industrial sites must now be regarded as hazardous. Impermeable layers at such sites are the most important barrier for impeding the spread of pollutants. It must be assumed that this geological barrier is always of importance, since the currently used techniques for preparing sites for landfills, mines and industrial plants will prevent the spread of pollutants for only a finite time. A site investigation stepwise is usually carried out in at least two phases: (1) a orientating investigation and (2) a detailed investigation. A flow chart of the stepwise procedure for site investigations is shown in Figure 1-1. Some references to chapters of this book are given in the flow chart. Field and laboratory work as well as data processing, data presentation and interpretation of the data from individual methods are described in the\n\n2\n\n1 Introduction\n\nchapters of Parts 3 to 5. Solutions to common problems are treated in Part 2. For more details of site investigation procedure see books with strategies and recommendations for site investigations (e.g., WILKEN & KNÖDEL, 1999, VOIGT et al., 2006).\n\nFig. 1-1: Flow chart for site investigations\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 1 Introduction\n\n3\n\nIn the orientating investigation, the following information is obtained from maps and other archived data sources: x topography, land use and vegetation, settlements, roads and railways, x climate: precipitation, temperature, evapotranspiration, direction and velocity of the wind, as well as the frequency of strong winds, x hydrological and hydrogeological conditions: streams, lakes and ponds, springs, wells, use and quality of surface and groundwater, runoff, water balance, aquifer/aquiclude properties and stratigraphy, groundwater table, groundwater recharge and discharge, x geology: soil, geological structures, stratigraphy and lithology, x ecological aspects: e.g., nature reserves, protected geotopes, water protection areas. This is accompanied by a reconnaissance survey in the field and by a historical review of earlier use of the site (interviews of persons who lived or worked around the site during the time of mining or industrial operations). The following aspects or parts of them must be taken into account for a detailed site investigation and assessment: x geology: thickness and lateral extent of strata and geological units, lithology, homogeneity and heterogeneity, bedding conditions and tectonic structures, fractures, impact of weathering, x groundwater: water table, water content, direction and rate of groundwater flow, hydraulic conductivity, value of aquifer, x geochemical site characterization: chemical composition of soil, rocks and groundwater, estimation of contaminant retention, x geotechnical stability: The geological barrier must be capable of adsorbing strain from the weight of a landfill, slag heap or industrial building. x geogenic events: active faults, karst, earthquakes, subsidence, landslides, x anthropogenic activities: mining damage, buildings, quarries, gravel pits, clay pits, etc., and x changes in soil and groundwater quality. An interdisciplinary geoscientific program is required for a site investigation. Numerous methods are available for such studies. The geological and hydrogeological conditions as well as the surface conditions (e.g., vegetation, surface sealing, buildings) at the site must be taken into consideration when the investigation methods are selected. There are some rules of thumb for site investigations: Start with the less expensive methods, expanding as necessary to more expensive methods for detailed investigations, i.e., remote sensing\n\n4\n\n1 Introduction\n\nbefore geophysics, geology and hydrogeology before geochemistry and modeling. Mapping should be carried out before sounding and drilling, investigations of the area as a whole before point data. First, a representation of the data is made, it is then interpreted, and an assessment of the conditions at the site is made. Not only the geological structures immediately below a landfill, slag heap or industrial site has to be examined, but also the surrounding area. The investigation of the surrounding area must include that part of the geological barrier that is expected to be needed for contaminant retention and that part of the regional groundwater system that will possibly become contaminated. Each landfill, mining or industrial site, whether in operation or abandoned, is within a groundwater system of several tens of square kilometers. A general survey of this area has to be made. A detailed study must be carried out in an area of 0.1 - 1 km² around the site itself. The structures down to a depth of 50 m are relevant to a study of abandoned and planned waste disposal sites. It is often necessary to extend the investigations down to 150 m to obtain information on the groundwater system. In some cases, the geology and the groundwater system below groundwater protection areas also have to be investigated in order to assess their vulnerability to pollution. The following methods and tools can be used to assess a geological barrier and the potential for the spread of contaminants: Remote sensing methods can provide geoscientific data for large areas in a relatively very short time. They are not limited by extremes in terrain or hazardous conditions that may be encountered during an on-site appraisal. In many cases aerial photographs and satellite images should be used to prepare a base map of the investigation area. Remote sensing methods can enable a preliminary assessment and site characterization of an area prior to the use of more costly and time consuming techniques, such as field mapping, geophysical surveys and drilling. The data obtained from satellite-based remote-sensing systems is best suited for regional studies as well as for detecting and monitoring large-scale environmental problems. However, for detailed site characterization, satellite data is sometimes of limited use due to relatively low spatial resolution. Mapping scales of 1 : 10 000 or larger are required for a detailed geoenvironmental assessment of landfills, mining, and industrial sites. Highresolution aerial photographs, airborne scanners, and some satellite-based remote-sensing systems provide data at the required spatial resolution (e.g., 70 cm and better). Aerial photographs made at different times can reveal the changes at sites suspected to be hazardous. Geophysical methods are used to develop a model of the geology below the site, to locate fracture zones, to investigate the groundwater system, to detect and delineate abandoned landfills and contamination plumes, as well as to obtain information on the lithology and physical parameters of the ground. Necessary condition for a meaningful use of geophysical methods is the existence of contrasts in the physical parameter values (magnetization,\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 1 Introduction\n\n5\n\nsusceptibility, density, electrical resistivity, seismic velocities, etc.) of soil and rock. The parameter values to be expected at the site must be considered before a geophysical survey is conducted. Geophysical methods supplement each other because they are sensitive for different physical parameters. Seismic methods are used to investigate structures and lithology. Electrical and electromagnetic methods are very sensitive to changes in electrolyte concentrations in the pore water. Ground-penetrating radar can be used in areas with dry, low-conductivity rocks. Both magnetic and electromagnetic mapping have proved useful for locating and delineating concealed landfills. Both methods are fast and easy to conduct, enabling large areas to be investigated in a short time. Seismic, dc-resistivity, electromagnetic and gravity methods are used to investigate groundwater systems on a regional scale. Geophysical surveys help find suitable locations for drilling groundwater observation wells and provide information between boreholes and for areas where it is impossible to drill. Well logging is absolutely necessary. Logging data are not only necessary for processing and interpretation of surface geophysical data but also as a bridge between geophysical surveys and hydrogeological modeling. Geological and hydrogeological studies are used to investigate lithological structures, to determine the homogeneity of the rock, to locate fractures, to determine the permeability of the rock with respect to water, gases and various contaminants, to assess the mechanical stability of the ground, and to obtain data on the groundwater system. Flow and transport models must be developed to estimate groundwater recharge and the potential for groundwater contamination. The main tasks of geological and hydrogeological surveys are to gain information directly by examining outcrops, digging trenches and drilling boreholes, conducting hydraulic tests (e.g., pumping tests and tracer tests) in wells to determine hydraulic properties in situ. This work is augmented by geological mapping, examination of drill cores, construction and expansion of a network of groundwater observation wells. Rock, soil and groundwater samples are taken to determine physical, chemical, petrographic and mineralogical parameters. Special laboratory experiments can be carried out to estimate migration parameters and the texture of rock and soil samples. Data from cone penetration tests and other field and laboratory methods are used to assess the stability of the ground. Geophysical and geochemical methods can be used to delineate and monitor operating and abandoned landfills as well as to determine the spread of contaminants. Geochemical methods are necessary to obtain information about the capacity of the rock to retain contaminants seeping from a landfill, as well as about the degradation of the hazardous substances. The objectives of the site investigation must be well defined. Additionally important is for suitable methods to be chosen to accomplish the objectives. The sections “Possible Applications” and “Examples” in the chapters of Parts 3 to 5 of this book can aid the selection of suitable methods. Suitable\n\n6\n\n1 Introduction\n\nmethods are recommended in Tables 1-1 to 1-3, for example, for geological investigations, investigations of landfill waste bodies, and the evaluation of groundwater conditions. These tables should not be considered as a substitute for the advice of an experienced specialist. This handbook is designed to provide geoscientific methods to investigate landfills and mining and industrial sites. It describes methods in the fields of remote sensing, geophysics, geology, hydrogeology, geochemistry, and microbiology. Most of the methods described in this volume are also available and used in developing countries. The descriptions provide information about the principle of the method, possible applications, fundamentals, instruments, survey practice, processing and interpretation of the data, quality assurance, personnel, equipment, time needed, examples, as well as references and sources for further reading. Most of the remote-sensing and geophysical methods are subdivided in this way (see Table of Contents). The geological, hydrogeological, and geochemical methods are subdivided in other ways, owing to the different way they are applied in site surveys. The handbook is not intended to be used as a textbook, but, instead, to provide insights into the fundamentals, application and limits of methods, as well as case studies, selected as examples for extrapolation to other geoenvironmental concerns. This handbook cannot replace consultation with an experienced remote-sensing expert, geologist, geophysicist and/or chemist. Involvement of experts insures that the most up-to-date methods and techniques are applied. Prior starting a project, it is beneficial to first define the objectives and goals of the study so that the most suitable techniques and methods can be used. The Federal Institute for Geosciences and Natural Resources (BGR), Germany, in cooperation with scientists from universities, research institutes, and industry, has carried out two projects entitled \"Methods for the Investigation and Characterization of the Ground below Waste Disposal Sites\" and “Recommendations for Site Investigations of Waste Disposal Sites and Contaminated Sites in Thailand” funded by the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF). The primary objective of these studies was to increase the understanding of the characteristics of the ground below waste disposal sites using geoscientific methods. Eight volumes of the German Handbuch zur Erkundung des Untergrundes von Deponien und Altlasten (Handbook for Investigation of the Ground below Landfills and Sites Suspected to be Hazardous) (Springer-Verlag) were prepared in the first project. The handbook “Site Investigation Methods” presented here is a product of the second project. This book contains numerous examples from both of the above-mentioned projects.\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 1 Introduction Table 1-1: Geoscientific methods for site investigations: geology\n\n7\n\n8\n\n1 Introduction\n\nTable 1-2: Geoscientific methods for site investigations: landfill waste body (both operating and abandoned)\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 1 Introduction Table 1-3: Geoscientific methods for site investigations: groundwater conditions\n\n9\n\n10\n\n1 Introduction\n\nThe authors and editors of this volume believe that the method descriptions and case studies in this volume will illustrate the advantages of applying remote-sensing, geophysical, geological, hydrogeological, geochemical, and microbiological methods to decision-makers faced with their own environmental investigations. The consistent and knowledgeable application of methods will improve the timeliness, cost-effectiveness, and thoroughness of most environmental site assessments. Site investigation is active environmental protection. Money for effective site investigations is well invested. This is an investment in our future and that of our children.

Springer, Berlin.\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 2 Preparatory Steps and Common Problems\n\n11\n\n2 Preparatory Steps and Common Problems KLAUS KNÖDEL, GERHARD LANGE & HANS-JÜRGEN VOIGT\n\nThe procedures for investigating planned, operating, or abandoned landfills, mining or industrial sites and the available methods are introduced in Part 1. The geoscientific methods are described in more detail in Parts 3 to 5. Certain preparations are required for any site investigation using ground-based methods in order to ensure the efficient implementation of field operations.\n\n2.1 Placing of Orders and Order Handling The \"rules\" for commissioning site investigations differ from country to country, very often depending on national or international regulations (e.g., for World Bank or EU projects). The \"rules\" must be well formulated and known and accepted by both customer and the contractor. Invitations to tender must contain a specification of the investigation aims and detailed terms of references for the commissioned work. The bidding contractor has to prove that he is able to carry out the requested work. Before a bid is submitted the site should be inspected by all prospective contractors. Thus, the bidders can become acquainted with the local conditions and the customer can be questioned in detail about the proposed investigation. The situation at the site (e.g., noise sources, sealed ground surface) can hamper the application of some methods and method combinations. On the other hand, information about the terrain, accessibility and plant cover in the area to be surveyed are important for estimating the length of time needed of the field work and thus for cost calculations. Not only is information about the survey conditions important for conducting a geoscientific survey, but attention must be paid to operational safety. The opinion of an operational safety specialist may be needed to rule out any hazards for the field team. In the case of a military or abandoned ammunition site, a specialist for the removal of explosives has to be consulted. This will entail additional costs. It has to be kept in mind – that the lowest bid is not always the best one! The contract awarded to the best bidder should include a listing of the rights and duties of both customer and contractor, a description of the work to be carried out, quality assurance measures, time schedule for the work, including the delivery of the reports and data, as well as the terms of payment.\n\n12\n\n2 Preparatory Steps and Common Problems\n\nThe quality of the work should be checked (e.g., well logging to check the placement of screens in groundwater observation wells) by the customer. If the customer is not able to do so, the geological survey and/or the environmental protection authorities will provide advice and can help with the quality assurance of such work. Quality assurance is discussed in Chapter 2.6 and the corresponding sections in the method descriptions. The same base map (see Chapter 2.2) and the same benchmarks at the site or near it have to be used for all work carried out at a site. It is very important that the local authorities and residents be informed about the field work (see Chapter 2.3). It is also important for the investigation results to be available and transparent to the local people. Details of the rights and duties of the customer and the contractor, as well as on operational safety, are not subject of this volume. The objective here is to sensitize authorities, customers and contractors to these problems.\n\n2.2 Collection and Use of Existing Data The most basic requirement for successful site investigations is the availability of maps and documents which facilitate a general overview of the investigation area and its surroundings and provide as much detailed information as possible. Topographic maps Topographic maps mainly display the morphology, the vegetation cover, the drainage system, and infrastructure. Scales of official maps vary between 1 : 100 000 and 1 : 10 000. A widely used scale is 1 : 50 000. Map content, however, can be rather outdated if map revisions are made only at long time intervals. While the 1 : 50 000 scale appears to be appropriate for an overview, site investigations usually require the most up-to-date maps at a considerably larger scale (1 : 10 000 to 1 : 2000). Such a large-scale map is needed as the base map for all field operations, as well as for the subsequent data documentation and interpretation. In many countries, large-scale topographic maps are not available. Therefore, base maps have to be prepared from aerial photographs or high resolution satellite images (e.g., IKONOS and QUICK BIRD). Cloud cover on the images should be less than 20 %. A ground check of the maps with a handheld GPS instrument can provide coordinates with a precision of about 10 m. This is sufficient for site investigations in most cases, however. If higher precision is necessary, maps constructed from large-scale aerial photographs (greater than 1 : 10 000) have to be geocoded and rectified by ground checks in the field (see Chapter 3.2).\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 2 Preparatory Steps and Common Problems\n\n13\n\nGeoscientific maps Geoscientific maps are a further necessary tool for site investigations. They generally depict a variety of information about geology, hydrogeology, mineral exploration, soil, natural hazards, and land use. Although the scale of the available geoscientific maps might not always be suitable to obtain the needed information in the necessary detail, the maps nevertheless place the investigation area in its regional context and permit the survey data to be interpreted with respect to its geological, hydrogeological and structural setting. Aerial photographs and satellite images Aerial photographs and satellite images are very useful tools for planning and implementing field operations. They provide the best overview and impression of the topography and infrastructure of the investigation area. In certain cases they allow a three-dimensional evaluation. They can provide information about lineaments, geomorphological structures, and flood-prone areas, as well as land use. Aerial photographs taken at different time are helpful for reconstructing the history of a site, often with immediate relevance to environment-related problems (see Part 3).\n\nPoint data compilation An important preparatory step for a geoscientific site investigation and data interpretation is the collection of already existing information about the subsurface (desk studies). This task mainly comprises the compilation and assessment of available data from boreholes for groundwater or mineral exploration. These point data are a valuable source of information and are indispensable for the interpretation of geophysical results and calibration of hydrogeological models. Results of desk studies on the geology at the site should be verified in the field. Quarries, road cuts and other outcrops provide information about the stratigraphy, lithology and structures in the investigation area. The data should be easily accessible in an appropriately prepared and documented database (e.g., GIS).\n\n14\n\n2 Preparatory Steps and Common Problems\n\nDocument review For the investigation of abandoned landfills, industrial and mining sites, it is necessary to obtain the history of the site as completely as possible. For this purpose, a review of all documents on the site facilities, their construction, length of operations, as well as waste composition, quantity, and treatment methods. These documents will be normally available from the relevant authorities or the site owners. This information not only aids the interpretation of geophysical survey data and hydrogeological observations, but it is also essential for any assessment of the risk present at the site and for recommendations of remediation measures and further use of the site. As not all or even any such information may be available, it is highly useful to interview persons who lived or worked around the site during the time of landfill, mining or industrial operations.\n\n2.3 Information Campaign and Permit Application Investigation of an operating, abandoned and planned landfill, mining or industrial site requires the approval of the relevant authorities at the state, district and/or local levels and of the affected private property owners. The objectives of the investigations, the estimated duration, and the scope of the work, as well as the methods and their likely impacts, should be explained in detail to those affected before approval for the operations is requested. Recommendations and information from public and private sources should be integrated into the working concept. As geophysical surveys and likely follow-up shallow drilling have to extend beyond the immediate investigation site, a large number of private and public landowners may be affected. Before field work is begun, permits must be applied for in order to ensure the work will be undisturbed during the site investigation. Before a permit is applied for, the customer should give the contractor a letter requesting support for the field work. The customer should also provide a site map showing the coordinates of survey lines and/or the boundary of the survey area. Depending on nature and extent of the investigation area, as well as the authorities and organizations concerned, e.g., municipal administrations, police stations and other relevant institutions must be informed on the impending field work (see check list in Table 2-1). If the investigation area includes nature, landscape, or water protection areas or other restricted areas, the governmental and/or private organizations involved must be provided information about possible impacts of the survey method(s) that will be used in order to obtain an exemption to the restrictions.\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 2 Preparatory Steps and Common Problems\n\n15\n\nTable 2-1: Check list for the preparation of site investigations customer customer (if possible) land surveying offices, land registry offices, map distributors\n\ndistrict authorities municipal authorities local authorities police stations if necessary mining authorities if necessary water management authorities if necessary forestry offices if necessary road authorities if necessary railway operators if necessary occupants/leaser and/or owners of the premises\n\nutilities operators (long-distance and local operators may be different): – freshwater – waste water – electricity (including street lighting) – gas – telecommunications specialists for the removal of unexploded ordnance (UXO), if necessary contractor\n\ncontractor contractor\n\nprovides the contractor with a letter authorizing the implementation of the work provides plans and maps provides topographic and geological maps (also as digital maps), general and detailed maps, land register maps, and names of property owners, information about topographic benchmarks to be informed and, if necessary, authorization is requested to be informed and, if necessary, authorization is requested to be informed and, if necessary, authorization is requested to be informed and, if necessary, authorization is requested to be informed and, if necessary, authorization is requested to be informed and, if necessary, authorization is requested to be informed and, if necessary, authorization is requested to be informed and, if necessary, authorization is requested to be informed and, if necessary, authorization is requested provides name, address, designation of the premises involved, private roads that may be used, authorization to use the premises, description of any damages provides information on the location of utility lines\n\nwould involve a subcontractor secures office and lodgings in the field (address, telephone and fax numbers, number of rooms, price) allocates human resources and equipment, hires local manpower if necessary provides the field team with road maps showing the way to the investigation area and the meeting point\n\n16\n\n2 Preparatory Steps and Common Problems\n\nIt is important to collect all available information on existing surface and subsurface installations (e.g., power lines, water mains, oil and gas pipelines, and sewer lines). If no official maps are available, local people generally know about these installations. As the locations of power lines and pipelines in an area often differ from the records provided by the operators, it is advisable to check the information on the maps with a cable/pipeline detector before starting the work. If public roads or railway tracks are crossed by survey cables it is necessary to discuss safety precautions with the road authorities or railway operators and procure written authorization. In some cases, the field investigations should be announced in local newspapers, stating time and area concerned. When the ownership of the premises has been determined, the owners or occupants must be contacted. The persons affected by the planned survey are given leaflet containing information on the site investigation and a questionnaire to obtain information about the locations of drainage ditches and other drainage facilities, private roads, power and water supply lines etc. so that appropriate measures can be taken to avoid damage. In farming areas, the contractor should meet with property owners and/or leasers to discuss the avoidance of disruptions of the field work and damage to survey equipment by agricultural machines. Immediately after termination of the survey, owners and occupants/leasers have to be contacted in order to assess any crop damage etc. Indemnity for crop damage depends on the season, on the anticipated harvest, and on the kind of damage to the land.\n\n2.4 Mobilization and Demobilization Field work generally starts with the mobilization of a survey party or a survey group and ends with its demobilization. This involves the following work and is part of the contract: – Preparation of the survey equipment and transport to the survey site, – transport of the working party to the survey area, – establish a field office and preparation of the field work, – disassembly and loading of the equipment at the end of the field work, – transport of the working party back to the home base, and – unloading and maintenance of the equipment. The personnel and time required depends on the methods, the distance to the location, and the size of the investigation program.\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 2 Preparatory Steps and Common Problems\n\n17\n\n2.5 Land Surveying Additional geotechnical measures, for example, drilling and cone penetration tests, or supplementary geophysical investigations are often planned within the scope of site investigations. These are carried out on the basis of the results of a geophysical survey campaign. Thus, the exact determination of measuring points and profiles is very important in order to document consistently all investigations in a site map of an appropriate scale. To properly interpret the geophysical data, it is often necessary to relate the surveyed profiles and measured points to the country's national topographic grid. The coordinates and elevation of benchmarks in or near the area to be surveyed have to be obtained from the land surveying office before the fixed points are surveyed at the investigation site. A map of the site and surroundings at a scale 1 appropriate for the aims of the survey should be made available by the customer. This will make it possible to compare the results of several contractors working in the same project area. Position determination The fixed points (benchmarks) near the investigation area must be inspected and their coordinates must be expressed in the units of the country's geodetic reference system (WGS 84, GRS 80, Universal Transverse Mercator Grid System - UTM, Gauss-Krueger system) so that the survey results can be related to the official maps. Table 2-2: The required accuracy of the geophysical measuring points and boreholes as a function of the scale of the field and presentation maps Scale of the field and presentation maps\n\nRequired accuracy\n\n1 : 10 000\n\nr 10 m\n\n1 : 5 000\n\nr 7.5 m\n\n1 : 2 000\n\nr5m\n\n1 : 1 000\n\nr2m\n\n1:\n\nr1m\n\n500\n\nThe required accuracy of the geophysical measuring points and boreholes, as shown in Table 2-2, depends on the working and presentation scale. The tolerable error in the relative positions measured within the survey area depends on the applied geophysical method. It must be smaller than r 1 m. For quality assurance, the accuracy of the position and height measurements should be documented in the report.\n\n1 The scale should be chosen so that the density of measuring points in maps and profile plots is not less than three measuring points per centimeter.\n\n18\n\n2 Preparatory Steps and Common Problems\n\nIf there are several benchmarks in the investigation area, the locations of the geophysical measuring points and profiles can be determined by \"free positioning\". The instrument (e.g., tachymeter) is positioned at a point where a line-of-sight view of the profiles to be measured geophysically and at least two, better three, fixed points is possible. The coordinates of this point can be determined from these measurements. The measurement to three or more benchmarks provides an indication of the precision of the coordinate determination for the standpoint. This method cannot be used if there is an insufficient number of fixed points. In this case, measurements must be made at several points along the profile and subsequently connected to the fixed points. In some site investigations, a local base grid is used and permanent markers placed at three base points of the grid. The locations of these base points must be marked on the maps or sketch maps included in the technical and scientific reports. The locations of the measuring points and profiles are determined with respect to this base grid using measuring tapes, an optical square and ranging poles. If possible, the local grid can be connected to the country’s grid. Altimetry The required precision for altimetry measurements is given in Table 2-3 according to the purpose they are used for. If there are no geodetic points with an elevation value near the survey area, measurements to tie the local benchmarks with remote benchmarks must be carried out. The most exact method for this objective is geometric leveling, which, however, takes a considerable amount of time, especially in rugged terrain. Measurements must be made to at least two remote points as a control on each other. This can result in long topographic leveling paths. Table 2-3: Required precision for altimetry measurements Method/object\n\nPrecision\n\ngravity methods\n\nr 0.03 m, for special measurements r 0.003 m\n\nseismic methods\n\nr 0.1 m\n\ngeoelectrics, geomagnetics\n\nr 0.5 m\n\ngroundwater observation wells\n\nr 0.01 m\n\nThe measurements can be made much more quickly if electronic tachymeters are used. The possibility of direct transfer of the data from the tachymeter to a computer also facilitates the data processing. The precision of the tachymeter measurements is less than that of geometric leveling, but sufficient for geophysical investigations. Because benchmarks often give only elevations or only coordinates, separate altimetry measurements are then necessary to tie the local benchmarks to the official grid.\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 2 Preparatory Steps and Common Problems\n\n19\n\nSatellite supported positioning The American Department of Defense completed the Navigation Satellite Timing and Ranging – Global Positioning System (NAVSTAR-GPS) in 1993. This system consists of 24 operating and 3 extra satellites, with at least 4 satellites being visible from any place on the Earth at any time. Each satellite transmits modulated navigation information on two carrier frequencies (L1, L2). This information includes the orbit parameters of the satellite (ephemerides), a refraction model, a clock parameter, as well as the orbital data (in simplified form) of all satellites in the space segment. Two positioning signals (C/A code 2 , P code 3 ) are modulated on frequency L1. With the P code modulated on L2 and the navigation information, the signal traveltime from the satellite to the receiver can be determined. The P code is encoded as a safeguard against falsification (“anti-spoofing”, A-S) and is accessible only by authorized users, especially military. From the traveling time of the signals, a GPS receiver calculates its three-dimensional position (longitude, latitude and altitude). Longitude and latitude can be calculated from the data of at least three satellites and using the signals of a fourth satellite the altitude can also be determined. “Selected Availability” (SA), which reduced the attainable precision by random signal falsification, was deactivated in May 2000. When that was done, measurements could be made by nonprivileged users with greater precision. Thus, using simple GPS receivers, a precision of r 5 to 20 m can be reached for the latitude and longitude. The precision for altitude is generally lower by a factor of 1.5 to 2. Maximum precision, however, can only be attained with an optimum constellation of the satellites. How optimal the constellation is is indicated by the PDOP factors 4 of the GPS display. Multipath effects, generated at the walls of buildings, can lead to a decrease in precision. Precision can be enhanced, for example, by using differential GPS (DGPS). The error in each satellite signal is calculated from the signals received by a GPS base station with coordinates known from a non-GPS source. The correction data is then transmitted to the portable DGPS station. The precision in the GPS measurements can be within a few centimeters when both the L1 and L2 carrier frequencies are used. There are three ways to transmit this information: – Direct transmission is possible if the base station and the mobile station are only a few kilometers apart and there are no significant barriers between them. This is due to the limited range of the radio in the GPS instruments. 2 C/A code stands for Clear/Acquisition, Clear/Access or Coarse/Access 3 P code: Precise Code 4 PDOP: Position Dilution of Precision: the smaller the value the better the results that may\n\nbe expected.\n\n20\n\n2 Preparatory Steps and Common Problems\n\n– As the correction signal of a reference station, however, can be used for distances up to several hundred kilometers (depending on the required precision) powerful commercial transmitters are being increasingly used for transmission of the correction data. – The third possibility is to send the correction signal via satellite. Some companies offer reference signals from geostationary satellites for a fee. Required is line-of-sight contact between the GPS instrument and the satellite. This kind of reference data transmission is of interest in nonEuropean countries. Use of satellite positioning for geoscientific purposes is a relatively new development. Besides the NAVSTAR-GPS and the Russian GLONASS systems, which can be used worldwide, the EU is installing the GALILEO system, for which more than 30 satellites will have been launched by 2008. Especially multifunctional “satellite positioning services” will increase the importance of satellite-supported positioning and navigation. These systems can be used without problems in open land, difficulties may occur in woodland or urban areas. A precision of about 1 cm to several millimeters is attainable by post-processing. The coordinates and altimetry data determined by GPS must be converted to the national or local frame of reference. Personnel, equipment, time needed How long it takes a surveying crew to execute a land survey depends on the precision required by the geoscientific methods that will be used. The survey progress is determined by topography, vegetation, visibility conditions, the distance to fixed points (benchmarks) and the survey method. Highperformance GPS systems and electro-optical tachymeters are now available, allowing precise survey data with relatively few personnel. In favorable cases, e.g., dc resistivity soundings or gravity and magnetic surveys, a land survey can be carried out by the geophysical personnel together with the data acquisition. The personnel, equipment and time needed in comparison with geophysical measurements are given in Table 2-4.\n\n21\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 2 Preparatory Steps and Common Problems\n\nTable 2-4: Personnel, equipment and time needed in comparison with geophysical measurements Survey personnel 5 marking of points on the basis of the topography and map marking of points on the basis of the topography and map and subsequent determination of position and elevation preparation of map showing the positions and elevations of the profiles and points in the survey area\n\n0\n\nEquipment needed\n\nTime 6 required [in %]\n\nmeasuring tape\n\n5 - 10\n\n1-2\n\nposition determination by tachymeter or GPS\n\n20 - 50\n\n1-2\n\ncomputer with appropriate software for maps\n\n50 - 100\n\n2.6 Quality Assurance and Reporting Quality assurance is an important part of the field work, the data processing, the interpretation, and the reporting. It must be documented in field protocols as well as summarized in the reports. Quality assurance includes x instrument checks before, at certain time intervals during, and after the measurements; x careful maintenance and calibration of equipment; x entry of all relevant occurrences and possible noise sources (e.g., passing cars during the geophysical measurements, heavy rain, storm, steel fences, power lines) in the field protocols; x daily data check and plotting of results during the field campaign; x repetition of a certain percentage of the measurements in order to estimate measurement errors; x documentation of all steps and parameter values used in the data processing and interpretation. x The report must contain all information needed to understand the report. x The figures and maps must be clear, understandable, and convincing.\n\n5 Land survey personnel in addition to the personnel needed for the geophysical survey. 6 Time needed for the land survey compared to the time needed for the geophysical survey.\n\n100 % means that the same time is needed for the land survey as for the geophysical measurement.\n\n22\n\n2 Preparatory Steps and Common Problems\n\nx The conclusions of the report must answer the question whether and how far the tasks and targets were achieved, must list remaining problems, and must be understandable for non-experts. x All measured data, relevant intermediate results, as well as figures and maps of the final report must be submitted to the customer in well documented form in both hardcopy and machine-readable form (e.g., CD or floppy disk) for later use as evidence in possible legal dispute and/or reinterpretation together with results of other investigations and, if necessary, with supplementary measurements. For the specific aspects of quality assurance of methods, see the “Quality Assurance” sections in Parts 3 to 5.\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 3 Remote Sensing\n\n23\n\n3 Remote Sensing PETER HERMS, BERNHARD HÖRIG, FRIEDRICH KÜHN, DIETMAR SCHMIDT & ANKE STEINBACH, with a contribution by TILMANN BUCHER\n\n3.1 Aerial Photography DIETMAR SCHMIDT & FRIEDRICH KÜHN\n\n3.1.1 Principle of the Methods Despite all technical progress in digital imaging, interpretations of standard aerial photographic images remain an important remote-sensing tool. Aerial photography can address a multitude of geoscientific questions and can be highly effective when used for logistics and planning (BÖKER & KÜHN, 1992). The cost of aerial photography is rather low. The data are informative, easy to manage, and the film does not require special image processing resources for analysis. Cameras for aerial photography, also referred to as metric cameras and frame reconnaissance cameras, are analog to standard photographic cameras using lenses, shutters, and film. These cameras, however, are more expensive, and mechanically and electronically complicated since they need to adjust the orientation of the camera during data acquisition. Ideally, aerial photography equipment is coupled to a Global Positioning System (GPS) to ensure better precision and accuracy. Photographic multispectral cameras have been widely used in planes and satellites in the 1970s and 1980s (COLWELL, 1983; KÜHN & OLEIKIEWITZ, 1983). Since then, the application of such cameras has decreased for several reasons: their complicated operation mode, spectral distortion depending on the angle of incidence on the camera lenses and filters, and the complicated and imprecise evaluation procedures. They have been replaced by multispectral digital imaging systems (see Chapter 3.3). Although there are a variety of types of film available for aerial photography, three kinds are used in almost all situations. These commonly utilized films are panchromatic (black and white), color and color-infrared\n\n24\n\n3.1 Aerial Photography\n\n(CIR) film. The latter one is able to serve most environmental and geological tasks. Vertical aerial photographs provide a three-dimensional impression of an area. Interpretations of stereo-pair photographs require an overlap of 60 - 90 % between two images along the flight line. An overlap of approximately 35 % is needed between adjacent flight lines to allow for flight irregularities. As the distance between any two consecutive images is greater than the distance between the human eyes, the topography of the target area appears strongly enhanced and exaggerated when the images are viewed stereoscopically. This enhancement commonly provides detailed information for geological and environmental analysis. Aerial photographs can be used for, but are not limited, for detection of man-made features. In addition, aerial photographs can often be analyzed to identify rock formations and types of soil, typical relief forms, distinctive vegetation types, drainage patterns and specific types of land use via changes in color or gray scale. In general, as the frequency of man-made features increases in an area, it becomes more difficult to extract geologic information from aerial photographs. Even older aerial photographs provide proper spatial resolution and often document changes in an area of interest over a period of several decades. They allow the evaluation of geological and initial environmental situation. Archives of aerial photographs are maintained worldwide, e.g., in governmental survey offices, and can provide aerial photographs at low cost. A thematic interpretation of a specific site using aerial photographs is usually carried out at scales between 1 : 2000 and 1 : 10 000. A topographic base map at the selected scale is necessary. The preparation of topographic maps is described in Chapter 3.2. Regional analyses (e.g., lineament analyses) are carried out at scales between 1 : 25 000 and 1 : 100 000.\n\n3.1.2 Applications x Chronological analysis of the development of land use, waste disposal, mining, and industrial sites and their surroundings, x assessment of the previous geological and environmental situation at sites now covered by waste disposal, mining, and industrial facilities, x search for seepage of water at the edges of landfills and mining waste heaps, x locating springs and moisture anomalies, x investigation of natural and artificial drainage systems, x locating areas of high and low permeability to water,\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 3 Remote Sensing\n\n25\n\nx recognition and monitoring of areas of destabilization, x investigation of vegetation vitality, x assessment of surface water conditions, x delineation of fractures and lineaments, x inventory of sites suspected to be contaminated, x mapping of land use patterns and biotops, and x search for potential new waste disposal sites.\n\n3.1.3 Fundamentals Remote sensing utilizes electromagnetic (EM) radiation in the ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and microwave portions of the EM spectrum to obtain information about the Earth’s surface with sensors carried by either an aircraft or satellite. Active and passive methods are used for remote sensing. Passive methods (see Chapters 3.1 - 3.3) use reflected solar radiation and radiation emitted from a surface. Active remote-sensing systems (Chapters 3.2 and 3.3) have their own source of radiation (e.g., radar or laser). Interaction of electromagnetic radiation with the Earth’s surface provides information about the reflecting or absorbing materials. Due to the small wavelengths of EM radiation used (nanometer to micrometer range) there is limited penetration of the targeted (optically thick) land surface objects. Given the proper atmospheric transmission, remotely sensed data represent the Earth surface conditions. Because EM radiation is the carrier of the remote-sensing information, it is important to define the different ranges of the EM spectrum. In the literature, it is difficult to find an unambiguous division of the electromagnetic spectrum, since it is of continuous nature. Divisions are commonly based on type of sensor and response of natural materials, etc. We have decided to use the divisions of the spectrum of ERB (1989). In addition to ERB’s divisions, we will use a further subdivision of the middle infrared (MIR) into MIR-I and MIR-II (Table 3.1-1) for remote-sensing purposes. The sun is the primary source of the Earth’s incident EM radiation. The energy spectrum of the sun is almost identical to that of a black body at 5900 K. Solar radiation reflected from the Earth’s surface is in the NUV to NIR-II (0.315 - 3.0 µm). However, there are gaps in this spectral range due to scattering, absorption, and reflection by gases, particles, and other atmospheric constituents. Major atmospheric absorption bands appear at 1.4 µm, 1.9 µm, and 2.5 - 3.0 µm resulting from atmospheric water vapor and carbon dioxide (KRONBERG, 1985; KUEHN et al., 2000). Little or no solar radiation reaches the Earth’s surface at these wavelengths and they cannot be used for land remotesensing purposes.\n\n26\n\n3.1 Aerial Photography\n\nTable 3.1-1: Spectral range of electromagnetic radiation utilized by remote-sensing sensors; spectral divisions by ERB (1989) Radiation near ultraviolet visible light near infrared middle infrared (thermal infrared) far infrared microwave (radar)\n\nAbbreviation NUV VIS NIR-I NIR-II MIR MIR-I MIR-II FIR MW\n\nWavelength O [in µm] 0.315 0.38 0.78 1.4 3.0 3.0 8.0 50.0 1000\n\n– 0.38 – 0.78 – 1.4 – 3.0 – 50.0 – 5.5 – 15.0 – 1000 – 106\n\nSolar radiation is either transmitted, absorbed or reflected at the surface. Reflections can be either direct or diffuse. The proportions of reflection, absorption, and penetration of the incident radiation at the Earth’s surface depend on the physical, chemical, structural, and textural properties of the surface. Molecules and chemical bonds (which make up all materials, including soils, rocks, water, and plants) are characterized by a specific energy level. The absorption of the incoming radiation provides the energy required for the transition from one energy state to another. Remote-sensing systems record the reflected radiation that reaches the sensor after its interaction with the Earth’s surface. Hence, the properties of the soil, rock, and other materials at the Earth’s surface are indirectly recorded in the data or images. The maximum energy of solar radiation is within the visible part of the spectrum (VIS) at 0.48 µm. The maximum radiation from the Earth is at about 9.7 µm. Thus, the best range for recording thermal radiation from the Earth’s surface is between 8 and 12 µm. Within this spectral range, slight temperature variations resulting from differences in the type of soil, soil moisture, or the presence of specific pollutants can be identified. Therefore, thermal scanners (Chapter 3.3) are designed to be most sensitive in the spectral range of 8 - 12 µm. To investigate hot surfaces (e.g., radiation from a blast furnace or the structure of a lava flow), a spectral range of 3 - 5 µm is more suitable. Radiation in the visible and infrared portions of the spectrum is absorbed by certain constituents of the atmosphere. Major absorption bands lie between 5 and 8 µm and between 13 and 30 µm. These spectral regions are usually not used for land remote sensing. Applications of thermal remote sensing are described in Chapter 3.3. Vertical aerial photographs are commonly produced at scales of 1 : 20 000 (sometimes 1 : 50 000) to 1 : 5000 for applications in environmental geology. Using a lens with a focal length of 150 mm, the flight altitude required to\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 3 Remote Sensing\n\n27\n\nproduce these scales is between 3000 m and 750 m above ground, respectively. Standard film size of 23 cm u 23 cm then will capture an area of 4600 m u 4600 m (at a scale 1 : 20 000) or 1150 m u 1150 m (scale 1 : 5000). The basic parameters of aerial photography, i.e., the scale (S) of the aerial photograph, the field of view (A) of the camera, and the ground resolution (Rg), can be calculated using the following equations (BORMANN, 1981a): S\n\nA\n\nRg\n\ncf hg hg k cf\n\nhg k RL\n\nwhere c f Sn hg k RL\n\n1 , Sn\n\n,\n\n(3.1.1)\n\n(3.1.2)\n\n,\n\n(3.1.3) is the focal length of the camera lens, scale constant, flight altitude above ground, film frame size (usually 23cm u 23 cm), and line resolution (lpi) of the film according to the manufacturer.\n\nEquation 3.1.3 gives an estimate of the spatial resolution, Rg. To precisely calculate the resolution of a given “film–lens” system, a contrast modulation function has to be used which describes the relation between the degree of contrast in the terrain and in the image as a function of object size for a given spatial frequency domain (BORMANN, 1981b).\n\n3.1.4 Instruments and Film Aerial photographs are used for both thematic interpretation and photogrammetry. The equipment and quality standards are mainly the same. They differ only in the films used. The following equipment and materials are required for aerial photo surveys: x Large format aerial cameras (Table 3.1-2) are available with different focal lengths (Table 3.1-3). Modern survey cameras (Table 3.1-2) are fully equipped for movement compensation (IMC – Image Motion Compensation). Blurring caused by the forward movement of the aircraft, can be compensated by FMC (Forward Motion Compensation). Fuzzy film images resulting from vibrations of the aircraft are prevented by using a gyroscope mount. x The “Flight Management System” (corresponds to IGI’s CCNS-4, T-FLITE of ZI/IMAGING or Ascot of LH-Systems), which was specially developed for survey flights on the basis of GPS, enables higher precision\n\n28\n\n3.1 Aerial Photography\n\nin flight management and more accurate shutter release for the specified areas. x DGPS (Differential Global Positioning System, see Chapter 2.5) receiver in the aircraft and on the ground, as well as GPS for terrestrial surveying. x Suitable film (see below in this section). x Equipment for the developing of black and white, color and/or CIR aerial film.

This film is frequently applied for geodetic and cartographic purposes, but may also be used for specific thematic mapping tasks. The high spatial resolution allows for identification of minor fractures. Phenomena such as changes in rock and soil type, soil moisture, or secondary effects related to contamination can also be detected with this film. Stereoscopic techniques using pairs of aerial photographs allow an experienced interpreter to characterize objects at the surface of a site in detail. SCHNEIDER (1974), KRONBERG (1984) and CICIARELLI (1991) show a multitude of applications for panchromatic film. Updates of topographic maps are in many countries made with panchromatic black-and-white film (Fig. 3.1-1).\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 3 Remote Sensing\n\n29\n\nFig. 3.1-1: Black-and-white aerial photograph taken by the Royal Thai Survey Department on November 11, 1995, showing the more than 35 m deep Nong Harn borrow pit near Chiang Mai in northern Thailand. The pit is being filled with waste from the west along a road to the bottom of the pit. The pit has steep slopes and was previously about 45 - 50 m deep. The western part of the pit floor is covered by more than 10 m of waste. The southern, western, and eastern slopes are covered by a plastic liner. The fine white lines on these slopes are ropes to hold down the strips of the liners. The northern slopes have the ropes too, but no plastic liner cover, as indicated by the brighter gray color and by the micro-topography of the uncovered slope.\n\nInfrared film Black-and-white film can be sensitized to extend beyond the visible range of light (VIS) into near-infrared wavelengths (NIR-I). This part of the nearinfrared spectrum, also referred to as the photographic infrared, ranges from wavelengths of 0.78 µm to about 0.9 µm. EM radiation detected by nearinfrared film is reflected solar radiation and should not be mistaken with thermal infrared radiation. The latter is the EM range between 8 and 15 µm and is used for thermal imaging. Due to the intense absorption of infrared radiation by water, near-infrared film is highly sensitive to changes in soil moisture content. Also, near-infrared film can be used to detect changes,\n\n30\n\n3.1 Aerial Photography\n\nextent, and state of vegetation cover. Healthy vegetation intensely reflects radiation in the same range. Color infrared film (CIR) has largely replaced black-and-white infrared film for investigations of damage to forests and other environmental conditions. Color and CIR film Color aerial film is used to depict a terrain in natural colors. Color film has three light-sensitive layers for the visible wavelengths of blue, green, and red. By substituting a near-infrared-sensitive layer for the blue-sensitive layer, a false-color photograph can be produced. This near-infrared-sensitive layer reacts to the intense reflection of NIR-I radiation by vegetation. As a result, if a reversal process is used for developing the film, the chlorophyll-rich vegetation will be represented by intensive red colors and low chlorophyll content by pale grayish red. Because there is less scattering of infrared radiation in the atmosphere than that in the visible range, CIR film (Fig. 3.1-2) yields sharper images with greater contrast from high altitudes than normal color film. The increase in contrast is enhanced by the use of a yellow filter to suppress the blue parts of light. CIR film has proven indispensable for a broad range of thematic mapping objectives. Environmental mapping relies on CIR aerial photography because of its high sensitivity to changes in plant type and vitality. Methods for mapping the vitality of trees in the vicinity of a waste disposal site using CIR images are described in Section 3.1.6.\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 3 Remote Sensing\n\n31\n\nFig. 3.1-2: CIR photograph, taken by Hansa Luftbild (German Air Survey) together with Sky Eyes (Thailand) on December 22, 2000, showing the refilled Nong Harn borrow pit near Chiang Mai in northern Thailand. The site is surrounded by a forest of several species of trees, recognizable by different colors and shapes of the crowns. Compaction of the 45 - 50 m thick waste in the pit creates a depression cone, visible by the blue round pond in the middle. Usually, water in CIR photographs appears dark or black. The blue color indicates relatively high turbidity. Chemical reactions within a landfill produce gas, which carries water with it as it ascends and escapes at the surface. The red arrows show the flow direction of surface water towards the pond at the surface.\n\nArchival aerial photographs Generally, any characterization of hazardous sites starts with an archival search for aerial photographs to reconstruct the historical development of the site and its surroundings. These photographs are commonly panchromatic black-and-white. Archives of aerial photographs are maintained by governmental survey offices, municipal administrative offices, commercial aerial photography firms, military institutions, private archives, and users of aerial photographs.\n\n32\n\n3.1 Aerial Photography\n\nFig. 3.1-3: World War II aerial photograph (March 24, 1945) of a destroyed industrial complex in the Dortmund area (Ruhr district, Germany). Damaged industrial plants, from which pollutants may have seeped into the soil, and bomb craters and pits, which may have served as dumps, are potential hazardous sites (courtesy of Luftbild-Datenbank, Ing.-Büro Dr. Carls, Estenfeld).\n\nMost wartime aerial photographs were taken during World War II. More rarely, photographs from times before are available as well. Target Information Sheets exist for most wartime reconnaissance flights; these define the rationale for and the outcome of each bombing. In general, it is possible to use these sheets to deduce which potentially toxic substances seeped into the soil after bombing an ordnance plant or a chemical factory. These sites should be considered to be potentially hazardous. Although aerial photographs taken\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 3 Remote Sensing\n\n33\n\nas part of a land survey usually cover large areas, military photographs are generally taken on linear traces with sudden direction changes (DECH et al., 1991). The archives of the American and British governments are additional sources of historical aerial photographs. There are also archives of aerial photographs which were taken during military actions by the American or British army since World War II. Figure 3.1-3 shows an archival aerial photograph taken in 1945. In general, private consulting companies are specialized in archive searches for these wartime aerial photographs. Oblique aerial photographs Geo-environmental assessments may require oblique aerial photographs, when overviews of large areas are needed (Fig. 3.1-4). Oblique photographs may prove particularly valuable in the early phases of a project when the overall site is being characterized.\n\nFig. 3.1-4: Oblique aerial photograph taken on May 11, 1993, looking westward across the waste incineration facilities at Gallun, south of Berlin, Germany, (foreground) and the northern part of the Schöneiche landfill (middle ground) to the Schöneicher Plan landfill in the background.

KÜHN, BGR).\n\n34\n\n3.1 Aerial Photography\n\nInterpretation instruments The thematic evaluation and interpretation of aerial photographs can be carried out using a mirror stereoscope or a digital stereoplotter. Stereoscopes are available in various shapes and sizes.\n\n3.1.5 Survey Practice Important aspects in planning and carrying out an aerial photography survey are selection of the camera, objective and navigation system, scale, ground resolution and flight altitude, flight path and spacing of flight lines, selection of a suitable film, choice of season and time of day, weather conditions, and ground check and logistics. For scale, ground resolution and flight altitude see Section 3.1.3. State-of-the-art instruments and films are described in Section 3.1.4. Aerial photography surveys, which now are semi-automated with modern navigation and camera systems, require extensive sophisticated equipment and techniques. As already mentioned in Section 3.1.1, aerial photographs should be taken with 60 - 90 % overlap in the direction of flight for stereoscopic restitution to be carried out. An overlap of approximately 35 % is needed between adjacent flight lines to allow for flight irregularities (Fig. 3.1-5). Current aerial film has different spectral sensitivities and geometric resolution (see Section 3.1.4). The film must be transported from the flight area to the photo lab and developed strictly following manufacturer’s instructions. Ground control point coordinates for rectification of aerial photographs may be determined after a flight and the film has been developed in a separate GPS survey if no reference data set is at hand. For this task it is necessary to select and carefully mark control points in the aerial photographs as well as some additional points that can be used if the selected ones are inaccessible on the ground. During the ground survey it is helpful to carry out photographic documentation or sketches of the terrain at the control point to confirm the relationships between the images at later stages. Coordinates of ground control points must always be determined at ground level in order to avoid a shift between the on-site measurement and the control points on the aerial photograph (e.g., roofs and masts). Particularly suited for control points are geometric man-made features such as street intersection and trail crossings, junctions, bridges, and the corners of buildings and walls.\n\nEnvironmental Geology, 3 Remote Sensing\n\n35\n\nFig. 3.1-5: A 60 % forward overlap and a 35 % flight-path overlap (sidelap) are necessary for effective stereoscopic evaluation (3-D) of photo pairs, after SCHNEIDER (1974)\n\nThe time of acquisition of the aerial photography is a critical factor in maximizing the value of aerial photographs for interpretation (BÖKER & KÜHN, 1992). Vegetation often covers geological features. Therefore, photographs for geologic interpretation should be taken during seasons with minimum vegetation. In temperate climate zones for example, aerial photographs taken in early spring after the snow has melted and the surface has dried up, and before the vegetation has fully emerged, are well suited for separating different kinds of soils and rocks and for detecting fractures and permeability anomalies. On the other hand, the existence of pollutants in specific areas may be recognized on the basis of certain vegetation patterns. In this case, and for mapping land use patterns and biotopes, it is better to use aerial photographs taken during the summer. Data about damages to vegetation caused by contamination should be acquired during the second half of the growing season in the late summer to early autumn. Taking photographs during this season avoids both the springtime vegetation burst, when small or moderate changes in vitality are hard to detect, and the rapid seasonal decay in late autumn. In the climates of the subtropics and tropics, the alternation between the temperature and moisture conditions of rain and dry seasons determines the time of aerial photo acquisition. For investigations of barren soils, rocks, and geological structures the best time is at the end of the dry season, when the vegetation cover is at its minimum. If the vegetation itself is the object of\n\n36\n\n3.1 Aerial Photography\n\nevaluation, e.g., for land use or biotope mapping, forest inventory and vitality evaluation, the beginning of the dry season is the best time for the photographic survey. The vitality of the vegetation is commonly still high at this time and visibility from the air is good for taking aerial photographs. Weather conditions are an important factor when acquiring images for geologic interpretation because soil moisture can greatly affect the quality of data interpretations. In some instances, it will be even useful to acquire data at a low altitude of the sun (10° to 30° above horizon), since low-relief forms appear enhanced by the more pronounced shadows on the ground. This increases the chance of detecting subtle"
