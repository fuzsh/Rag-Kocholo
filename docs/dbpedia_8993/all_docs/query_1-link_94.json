AND REPORTS. SECURITIES In using the series it is to be remembered that they are inter-dependent This is one of our four Supplements. jublications, complete only as a whole. If utilized together, and with the fresh items of news the Chronicle contains from vreek to we»>k, the investor will have all the information he needs in seeking a safe and remunerative lodgment for his money Street Railways forcibly illustrate this inter-dependence. Such roads obviously rely for their income, and therefore IB great part for the value of their securities, upon the population and activity of the country they serve. Hence constant reference to our STATS and City SUPPLEMENT will be found necessary by those wishing to purchase the stocks and bonds of street roads. Population, assessed valuation, tax rate, total debts of the counties, cities and minor municipalities are given at length in that publication, every one of which items is an essential fact contributing more or less to any correct estimate of the amount of suburban travel a given road commands. The Abbreviations used in our Street Railway statements will be found explained in a table immediately following the last statement in this Supplement. full Index which shows where each railway will be found is also given on the closing pages.
