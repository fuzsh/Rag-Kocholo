        "text": "It can be tough for a coach to yell at you, and in our current culture, parents can get involved to try and tone things down a bit. But from his earliest days learning the game from his father all the way to the NBA, Steve Blake learned how to play the point guard position right by learning lessons in toughness and resilience from old school coaches who weren’t afraid to yell when necessary.\n\nA precocious high school talent, Steve won a state championship at Miami High with Udonis Haslem, the iron man who is currently the oldest player in the NBA, and future USC coach Frank Martin. He then transferred to Oak Hill Academy, the Virginia prep school that has produced such pro talents as Carmelo Anthony, Rajon Rondo, and Jerry Stackhouse, where he played for legendary coach Steve Smith. Blake then benefited from the tutelage of Hall of Famer Gary Williams, starting at the University of Maryland as a freshman and leading the Terrapins to a national championship. Blake then spent 13 seasons in the NBA with the Wizards, Lakers, and three stints with the Blazers.\n\nIn this episode, Steve shares:\n\nWhat it means to be a pass-first point guard\n\nHow to develop quiet leadership when you’re an introvert\n\nWhy he embraced the tough love of Frank Martin, Steve Smith, and Gary Williams\n\nHow to handle game day pressure\n\nWhat makes Udonis Haslem such a wonderful teammate and friend"
