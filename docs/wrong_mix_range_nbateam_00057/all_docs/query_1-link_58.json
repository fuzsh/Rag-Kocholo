        "text": "Raphael Chillious was an assistant coach for Washington in the winter of 2013, a Pac-12 guy at the time, but with roots firmly on the East Coast, just outside Baltimore. He was in his home area on a recruiting trip and figured he’d swing by perennial powerhouse DeMatha in Hyattsville, Maryland, to take in a game. He arrived early at the gym, in time to catch the junior varsity play.\n\nChillious was on the phone as he settled into his seat when he took notice of a bundle of knees and elbows out on the floor, a thin and awkwardly built sophomore who somehow moved with precision and smoothness once the ball was in his hands. “Oh my gosh,” he said. Chillious hung up the phone.\n\n“He was like a newborn deer,” Chillious said. “Because he had—he was only about 6-1 when I first saw him—but he had these big hands and long arms and big feet. I was looking at the length of his leg from his knee to his ankle and I was like, ‘Man, I think that kid is going to grow, and if he grows, it’s over.’”\n\nChillious asked around for the young player’s name. He got it: Markelle Fultz.\n\nAt the time, Fultz was entirely unknown on the recruiting circuit, an undersize forward who still had not cracked the varsity roster even as a sophomore. Most big-time recruits are already nationally known by their mid-teens. But Fultz was out of position. It was only when he had the ball that you could see his gift, his ability to anticipate player movement and throw snap-crisp passes with accuracy. Chillious approached Fultz after the game and asked him what position he liked to play.\n\n“I am playing forward, Coach,” he said, “but I really want to play point guard.” That was exactly what Chillious wanted to hear.\n\n“I have coached a few pros,” Chillious said, “and the thing that always jumps out to me is that they have something about them that is elite. I first saw him, it was like, to use a baseball comparison, it was like I was watching Ken Griffey Jr. They said he had Top 5 percent best vision in being able to see a baseball. I felt that way about Markelle, being able to see the next play, to make the read, the make the pass. He could just see it. Letting a play develop, finding his guys, it made him happy.”\n\nSimple happiness—passing a ball to help teammates score—has escaped Fultz over the last two years, dating back to when he was the No. 1 pick in the 2017 draft. The Sixers traded up to acquire him only to find that, shortly thereafter, something wasn’t quite right with Fultz’s shoulder. He was having trouble lifting his arms, an obvious problem for a basketball player. The ailment, since diagnosed as Thoracic Outlet Syndrome, was difficult to identify and treat. Fultz’s season-and-a-half in Philadelphia was broken into a series of stops and starts, new beginnings and clean slates.\n\nNone of them worked. He played the first four games of his rookie year, when even shooting free throws became a nightmare (he shot 47.6 percent from the line that season and was ridiculed for a string of unsuccessful and bizarre pre-free-throw routines). He sat out three months after having his shoulder drained of fluid before returning in March 2018. Fultz played the Sixers’ last 10 regular-season games and their first three playoff games but was yanked from the lineup again. Philadelphia coach Brett Brown made him a starter to open the 2018-19 season, hoping to bolster his confidence, but the starting-lineup experiment failed and Fultz returned to the bench.\n\nIn his final game in Philadelphia, Sixers fans cheered when he was removed for guard T.J. McConnell after he missed the only two shots he attempted and committed three fouls in seven minutes. That was November 19 of last year. The following day, Fultz’s agent said he would not practice again until he saw another shoulder specialist. Fultz has not played a meaningful game since. The Sixers decided to move on from him in February, shunting him off to Orlando for what likely will be two second-rounders. For Fultz, it’s been a struggle.\n\n“It’s just like anything you love,” Fultz told reporters at the start of training camp. “I think anything, if you asked anybody, what’s the thing you love the most and asked them how would it feel being taken away from you? It’s tough. I just wanted to go out there. If I had no arms, I would want to play basketball. There’s just something about having something that you love taken away from you that’s different.”\n\nFor Chillious, his old coach and friend, it’s been painful to watch Fultz go through the grind of the shoulder pain and the public flogging that comes when a top draft pick does not immediately produce. Fultz is not a glum type, but on the NBA stage, he seems to have had as little happiness as playing time in the past two years. Maybe that will change in Orlando. Fultz is just two days away from getting back on the floor in a real NBA game, on Wednesday at home against Cleveland, just two days from putting Philadelphia firmly behind him and starting the Magic phase of his career.\n\n“I just want to see the kid smile,” Chillious said. “Markelle is an unbelievably happy-go-lucky kid. You like to see that. When he is smiling, he is in his comfort zone and he’s going to play well. That is all I want for him. Play, have fun, do the things that we all know you can do and do it with confidence. Most of all, be a point guard and help your team win. And smile.”\n\nAnother Clean Slate And Something To Prove\n\nEarlier this month, with just under eight minutes to play in the second quarter of the of the Magic’s second preseason game, in Detroit, Fultz curled into the lane on a drive and immediately drew out both Pistons big men, Blake Griffin and Christian Wood, to meet him about 12 feet from the basket. Fultz saw center Mo Bamba trickle toward the basket, and Fultz stopped, faked, then floated a pass that landed softly in Bamba’s hands for a wide-open two-foot layup.\n\nThat’s the kind of play that the Magic are looking for from Fultz as he embarks on yet another new beginning, another clean slate, in Orlando, where the Magic will bring Fultz along slowly, in 20-24 minute chances behind starter D.J. Augustin. For all Fultz has been through in two years, he could yet have a bright future ahead. It’s only his third season, after all. He knows many have given up on him and, in a way, he’s more comfortable in that underdog role—it’s almost like being back on the DeMatha JV squad.\n\n“That’s just what I grew up with,” Fultz said. “A lot of people don’t know that about me coming up. I’ve talked about it a lot, I wasn’t one of the top players in the nation, I wasn’t a kid that played varsity all four years, I had to work for everything I got. It’s a big thing that my mom goes by, just never quitting, no matter if it goes your way or not.”\n\nFultz has something to prove, obviously, but he’s willing to do so within his role. When he arrived in Orlando, there was speculation that the Magic intended to make him the starter, and that there could be some bitterness from Augustin, the incumbent. But according to Augustin that was never the case. Augustin is 32, after all, and has played 12 NBA seasons. He’s found Fultz an easy player to mentor and said that while the two push each other on the practice floor, he just tries to be there for Fultz when he needs to talk off the floor.\n\n“You can see the joy on him,” Augustin told Forbes. “Basketball is what we’ve known since we were little kids, we’ve dreamed of playing in the NBA. When something like that is taken from you, you can go through all kinds of things. Depression, anxiety, whatever it is. But the fact that he is on the floor and able to be healthy, all those things I think he is a lot happier now. He just wants to get better.”\n\nThat’s where things are still dicey for Fultz. The Magic hoped to rebuild Fultz’s shot in the offseason and after working with trainer Drew Hanlen in the offseason, he has come back with a more consistent form. In his six preseason games, he averaged 10.0 points and 4.0 assists, with 1.8 steals per game in 19.8 minutes. But the shot, even if the form is better, still is not working. Fultz made 31.5 percent from the field in the preseason and was 0-for-6 from the 3-point line.\n\nMagic coach Steve Clifford, who has a well-earned reputation for player development around the league, has been delicate with Fultz. He sometimes speaks of his backup point guard as though he is in the mist of a 12-step program.\n\n“Markelle needs to do, in my opinion, what Markelle has done since he got here: have good days,” Clifford explained to reporters after a practice. “Have a good day tomorrow. That’s what the best players do. That’s what the best teams do: is have good days, [and] put good stretches of days together. Be better Friday than he is Tuesday.”\n\nClifford’s day-at-a-time approach just might mask some concern in Orlando that Fultz’s new beginning just might turn out like the handful of new beginnings he had with the Sixers. There’s no doubt that his shot is not where it needs to be. It’s in the best interest of the team to tamp down expectations on Fultz and to limit the pressure on him. But Fultz is remaining positive. This comeback is just starting. The fact that he’s here at all means a lot.\n\n“Every time I step on the floor, I take it as a huge thanks,” he said last week. “I don’t take anything for granted. Every day I go out there, I get a little more and more comfortable, I get more used to being back out there. It’s been so long for me, I am just happy to be back out there. And I’m just trying to learn and play as hard as I can.”\n\nThe Video Tape Does Not Lie\n\nAfter watching Fultz blossom at DeMatha and serving as an assistant coach for Washington’s Lorenzo Romar during Fultz’s one-and-done season with the Huskies—in which Fultz averaged 23.2 points—Chillious had developed a familiarity with Fultz’s game that few could match. Chillious was watching Fultz’s performance in the opener of the Las Vegas Summer League in July 2017 and, while most were focused on the battle he had with Boston’s Jayson Tatum (Fultz scored 17, to 21 for Tatum) Chillious noticed that Fultz’s shot was not quite right. He had altered his shooting motion.\n\n“When I saw him in the Summer League,” Chillious said, “I saw him take a shot and I saw his shot was totally different than it was at Washington. First thing I thought was, he must be hurt and he’s not telling anybody.”\n\nThis was not new for Fultz. He’d done much the same at Washington, when he tried to play through an injured left knee suffered down the stretch of the season. The Huskies shut him down in mid-February, after he had played 25 games. The draft was four months later. After that, Fultz did not want to go from the knee injury to finish his career at Washington to missing time with the mysterious shoulder injury before his career as the NBA’s No. 1 overall pick even began.\n\n“Markelle, even when his knee was bothering him at Washington, he wouldn’t tell us,” Chillious said. “He wants to play. He was such a good teammate, he didn’t want to let anyone down by not playing. I admired him for wanting to hang in there and play with his teammates even though it was not the best thing, maybe, for his health. He never complained. He is the kind of kid, he does not complain about anything.”\n\nFor a guy not given to complaining about his aches and pains, Thoracic Outlet Syndrome was an especially tough ailment to handle. Its symptoms are subtle—numbness in the hands, difficulty gripping, pain in the shoulders—and inconsistent. If you tear a ligament or break a bone, you know it. But Fultz would not necessarily have known what was wrong with his shoulder, even if he was inclined to tell somebody.\n\nFultz is hopeful that he is and will remain healthy now. He’s got a new role on a new team and while he is happy to find ways to chip in on both ends of the floor (he has the build and instincts to be a great defender) he hasn’t given up on his potential as a star player. He just needs his shoulder to cooperate, as well as his jump shot. And his brain—for a cerebral guy like Fultz, the trials of the past two years have been difficult between the ears as well as on the floor.\n\n“I’ve always been a fast learner,” Fultz said, “and, you know, quick to pick up stuff. I feel like the game is simple when you limit what you’re thinking about. When you go out there and control what you can control, have fun and just try to execute the game plan. I feel like all the rest of my game—points, steals, defense—all that will take care of itself if I’m just worried about having fun and doing what coach asks me. … I can be one of the best guards in this league. And I feel like it’s gonna come with work.”\n\nFor Chillious, it’s encouraging to hear Fultz talk that way. It might feel like a lifetime ago that he first saw Fultz in the gym at DeMatha, but Fultz is only 21 years old. “Still a baby,” said Chillious, who is coaching at East Carolina now. Throughout the last two years, as he has followed Fultz’s tribulations, Chillious has kept snippets of Fultz in the back of his mind—plays that he saw in the past in which Fultz flaunted his instinct for passing, the way he used that five-percent vision, the way Fultz would coach his teammates after they left a huddle during a timeout.\n\nAs Fultz embarks on another fresh start, Chillious just wants to see that guy again.\n\n“You can’t fudge the video tape,” he said. “As coaches, we always say the tape doesn’t lie. You know what he is capable of doing. But you feel for the kid. There’s guys who are 30 years old who have been in the league eight, nine years who wouldn’t be able to handle the situation as the No. 1 pick the way he has. I really like that he has been grinding his way through it. I think he is going to smile, hopefully stay healthy and play good basketball.\n\n“I know what he can be. I’ve seen it, from the beginning.”"
