        "text": "American basketball player (born 1977)\n\nThis article is about the American basketball player. For other people with the same name, see Vince Carter (disambiguation).\n\nVincent Lamar Carter Jr. (born January 26, 1977) is an American former professional basketball player who serves as a basketball analyst for YES Network, an alternate Studio Analyst for the NBA on TNT, and formerly ESPN. He primarily played the shooting guard and small forward positions, but occasionally played power forward later in his NBA career. Carter was an eight-time All-Star and a two-time All-NBA Team selection. He is the only player in NBA history to play as many as 22 seasons from his debut in 1999 to his retirement in 2020, as well as the only player to play in four different decades.[1][2] In 2024, it was announced that Carter would be inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.[3]\n\nCarter entertained crowds with his leaping ability and slam dunks, earning him nicknames such as \"Vinsanity\", \"Air Canada\" named after the Canadian airline with the same name, and \"Half Man, Half Amazing\".[a] He has been ranked as the greatest dunker of all time by numerous players, journalists, and by the National Basketball Association (NBA).[4][5][6][7] In addition to his dunking prowess, Carter was a prolific three-point shooter, making the ninth most three-point field goals in league history.[8] Various contemporaries have called him the league's \"most gifted/talented\" player.[9]\n\nA high school McDonald's All-American, Carter played college basketball for three years with the North Carolina Tar Heels and twice advanced to the Final Four of the NCAA Tournament. He was selected with the fifth overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors, who traded him to the Toronto Raptors. Carter emerged as a global star in Toronto, winning the 1999 NBA Rookie of the Year Award and the Slam Dunk Contest at the 2000 NBA All-Star Weekend. He represented the United States in the 2000 Summer Olympics, where he led the team in scoring and captured a gold medal. In December 2004, Carter was traded to the New Jersey Nets, where he continued his offensive success. He also played for the Orlando Magic, Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks, Memphis Grizzlies, Sacramento Kings, and Atlanta Hawks. He received the Twyman–Stokes Teammate of the Year Award in 2016. Off the court, Carter established the Embassy of Hope Foundation, helping children and their families in Florida, New Jersey and Ontario. He was recognized in 2000 as Child Advocate of the Year by the Children's Home Society, and received the Florida Governor's Points of Light award in 2007 for his philanthropy in his home state. Carter was inducted into the Florida Sports Hall of Fame in 2023.\n\nBorn in Daytona Beach, Florida, Carter is the son of Michelle and Vincent Carter Sr. His parents divorced when he was seven.[10] His mother remarried several times.[10][11]\n\nCarter attended Mainland High School in Daytona Beach. He played football as a quarterback until a broken wrist in his freshman year forced him to switch to volleyball.[12] In volleyball, he was named the Volusia County Player of the Year as a junior and averaged 24 kills per match; for comparison, none of his teammates averaged more than one.[13] He was also offered a saxophone scholarship to attend Bethune–Cookman University in Daytona Beach.[14]\n\nHe led Mainland's basketball team to its first Class 6A state title in 56 years, and was a 1995 McDonald's All-American.[15] On January 31, 2012, he was designated one of the 35 greatest McDonald's All-Americans.[16][17] In his senior year he averaged 22 points, 11.4 rebounds, 4.5 assists and 3.5 blocks per game.[18] Carter's career totals at Mainland are 2,299 points, 1,042 rebounds, 356 assists and 178 steals.[18] He was contacted by 77 NCAA Division I schools but ultimately chose North Carolina over Florida.[12]\n\nCarter enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1995. He is a member of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity.[19]\n\nHe played three seasons of college basketball for the North Carolina Tar Heels under Dean Smith and later Bill Guthridge. During the 1997–98 season, he was a member of new coach Guthridge's \"Six Starters\" system that also featured Antawn Jamison, Shammond Williams, Ed Cota, Ademola Okulaja, and Makhtar N'Diaye.[20] During his sophomore and junior seasons, Carter helped North Carolina to consecutive ACC men's basketball tournament titles and Final Four appearances. He finished the 1997–98 season with a 15.6 points per game average and was named second-team All-American, First-Team All-ACC, and to the fan's guide third-annual Coaches ACC All-Defensive Team. In May 1998 after his junior year, Carter declared for the 1998 NBA draft, following his classmate Jamison, who had declared earlier that spring.[21]\n\nDuring his NBA career, Carter continued his coursework at North Carolina, and in August 2000, he graduated with a degree in Afro-American studies, squeezing in attendance at May 2001 graduation ceremonies at North Carolina before leaving to make a Raptors' playoff game in Philadelphia.[22]\n\nCarter was initially drafted by the Golden State Warriors with the fifth overall pick in the 1998 NBA draft. He was then immediately traded to the Toronto Raptors for the fourth overall pick, Antawn Jamison on draft night.[23] The Raptors had struggled in their first three years as a franchise. Carter was instrumental in leading the Raptors to their first-ever playoff appearance in 2000 before going on to lead them to a 47-win season and their first-ever playoff series win in 2001, advancing them to the Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\nDue to the NBA lockout, Carter's rookie season did not start until January 1999. Carter quickly became a fan favorite with a soaring offensive game that earned him the nickname \"Air Canada\". He won the NBA Rookie of the Year Award after averaging 18.3 points and throwing down countless highlight-reel dunks.[24] Carter ascended to full-fledged stardom in his second season—he averaged 25.7 points per game (fourth-highest in the league) and lifted Toronto to its first playoff appearance in franchise history. He subsequently earned his first NBA All-Star selection and was named to the All-NBA Third Team. During the 2000 NBA All-Star Weekend, Carter showcased arguably the most memorable Slam Dunk Contest event in its history.[24] He won the contest by performing an array of dunks including a 360° windmill, a between-the-legs bounce dunk, and an \"elbow in the rim\" dunk (also known as a \"cookie jar\" dunk or the \"honey dip\").[23] Carter and his second cousin once removed, Tracy McGrady, formed a formidable one-two punch as teammates in Toronto between 1998 and 2000. However, McGrady left in free agency to the Orlando Magic in August 2000, leaving Carter as the Raptors' franchise player.\n\nIn 2000–01, his third season, Carter averaged a career-high 27.6 points per game, made the All-NBA Second Team, and was voted in as a starter for the 2001 NBA All-Star Game. The Raptors finished the regular season with a then franchise-record 47 wins. In the playoffs, the Raptors beat the New York Knicks 3–2 in the first round and advanced to the Eastern Conference Semifinals to face off against the Philadelphia 76ers. Carter and 76ers star Allen Iverson both dominated in a seven-game series that see-sawed back and forth. Carter scored 50 points in Game 3 and set an NBA playoff record for most three-point field goals made in one game. In Game 7, Carter missed a potential game-winning shot with 2.0 seconds remaining.[25] Iverson said of the series in July 2011: \"It was incredible. (Carter) had great games at home and I had some great games at home, but both of us were just trying to put our teams on our back and win basketball games. It is great just having those memories and being a part of something like that.\"[26]\n\nIn August 2001, Carter signed a six-year contract extension worth as much as $94 million.[27] Carter missed the final 22 games of the 2001–02 regular season due to injury. He started in 60 games and averaged 24.7 points per game. On December 7, 2001, Carter recorded 42 points, 15 rebounds, 6 assists and 5 steals against the Denver Nuggets.[28] He joined Charles Barkley (1988) as just the second player ever to finish a game with 40 points, 15 rebounds, five steals and five assists, dating back to the 1973–74 season, when the league began officially tracking steals.[29] He was voted into the 2002 NBA All-Star Game, but he could not participate due to injury. Without Carter during the playoffs, the Raptors were defeated in five games by the Detroit Pistons in the first round.\n\nFollowing off-season surgery,[24] Carter only managed 43 games during the 2002–03 season. In February 2003, Carter gave up his starting spot in the 2003 NBA All-Star Game to Michael Jordan to allow Jordan to make his final start as an All-Star.[30] Carter played in 73 games during the 2003–04 season, but the Raptors fell three games short of making the playoffs.\n\nDuring the 2004 off-season, general manager Glen Grunwald and the entire coaching staff were fired. Following trade rumours all season long, on December 17, 2004, new general manager Rob Babcock traded Carter to the New Jersey Nets for Alonzo Mourning, Aaron Williams, Eric Williams and two first round draft picks.[31]\n\nIn his first game back in Toronto, on April 15, 2005, Carter was heavily booed and jeered by Raptors fans. Carter would finish with 39 points in a 101–90 New Jersey victory.[32][33] Carter continued to receive similar treatment for years to come in the town that once embraced him. Despite this, he thrived on many occasions in Toronto as a Net.[24] On January 8, 2006, after a missed free throw by the Raptors, Carter hit a long three pointer at the other end with 0.1 seconds left to seal a 105–104 win to shock the Toronto crowd. Afterwards Carter, who finished with 42 points, referred to it among his greatest shots ever saying \"That's definitely number one. The atmosphere, the emotion, the hostility in the arena, it was a fun game.\"[34] On November 21, 2008, Carter's late game heroics sent the game into overtime where he would hit another game winner doing so on an inbounds alley-oop dunk with 1.5 seconds left in a 129–127 victory. Carter scored 39 points and regarding the continued booing he insisted he held no grudges to the fans \"I know, deep down, that's just sports, that's the way it goes. I root for my team and I'm a terrible fan.\"[35]\n\nIn November 2011, Carter, along with Tracy McGrady and Charles Oakley, addressed the Toronto audience in an interview on Off the Record with Michael Landsberg. When asked about being booed in Toronto, Carter said, \"They watched myself and Tracy grow up. And when we left they still got to see (us) flourish and become (who we are). For me, I looked at it as, a young child growing up into a grown man and moving on. And I get it. Leaving, hurt a lot of people. It hurt me because I tell you what... I accomplished a lot, I learned a lot, I became the person and player of who I am today because of that experience, through the coaches, players, and everything else. I get it... but regardless I still love the city. I have friends there and my heart is still there because that's where it all started.\" Later in the interview, when asked about any words to the Toronto fans, Carter said, \"I appreciate the fans and whether you cheer for me, boo me, or hate me, I still love you. Toronto's one of the best kept secrets... puts one of the best products on the floor and one of the top places to play in.\"[36][37][38]\n\nOn November 6, 2012, in an interview with TSN Radio 1050, Carter reiterated his love for the city and his appreciation for the Toronto Raptors organization.[39][40] The next day, Sam Mitchell and Rob Babcock revealed on Sportsnet 590, The Fan that the night before Carter was traded to New Jersey, Carter phoned Mitchell to express his desire to stay in Toronto. However, Babcock said it was too late and the trade had already been verbally agreed upon. Looking back on it, Mitchell feels he should have personally contacted the MLSE chairman, Larry Tanenbaum, but was reluctant because he did not want to break the chain of command.[41][42]\n\nRaptors general manager Masai Ujiri referred to Carter in April 2014 as \"one of the symbols of the Toronto Raptors.\"[43] To this day, Carter remains as one of the Raptors' elite scorers in franchise history having amassed 9,420 points and is Toronto's all-time leader in points per game, box plus/minus and player efficiency rating during his 6+1⁄2-year run in Toronto. [44]\n\nOn November 19, 2014, nearly a decade after the trade, as a part of the Raptors' 20th anniversary celebration, the team paid tribute to Carter with a video montage during the first quarter of the Raptors–Grizzlies game. Leading up to the game, questions were raised about how Raptors fans would receive the planned video tribute.[45] As the sellout crowd watched the video tribute featuring highlights of Carter's high-flying Raptors days, what began as the usual booing turned into an overwhelmingly positive standing ovation.[46][47][48] An emotional Carter used his warm-up shirt to wipe tears running down his face as he pointed to his heart and waved to the fans in appreciation. He later stated, \"It was a great feeling, I couldn't write it any better.\"[49]\n\nCarter was acquired by the New Jersey Nets on December 17, 2004,[50] playing five seasons for them before departing in June 2009. Carter produced some of his highest numbers with the Nets, surpassing his 23.4 points per game with the Raptors to average 23.6 points per game over his tenure in New Jersey. He missed just 11 games in his four full seasons and helped lead the Nets to three straight playoff runs between 2005 and 2007.\n\nCarter joined a Nets team with Jason Kidd and Richard Jefferson as the leading players. However, the trio never got to play together at full strength during the 2004–05 season. Carter and Kidd carried a shallow roster on a 15–4 run to end the season to make the playoffs.[51]\n\nIn the 2005–06 season, the Carter-Kidd duo co-led the Nets to 49 wins, an Atlantic Division title, and the No. 3 seed in the playoffs. Carter helped lead the Nets to the second round of the playoffs before losing to the eventual NBA champions Miami Heat in five games. Carter averaged 29.6 points, 7.0 rebounds and 5.3 assists in 11 playoff games. Carter was named an Eastern Conference All-Star in 2006. On November 7, 2005, Carter threw down a very memorable dunk against the Miami Heat, over defensive stalwart, Alonzo Mourning.[52] On December 23, 2005, Carter set an NBA record for the most free throws made in a quarter (4th quarter) with 16 against Miami. He tied his career-high of 51 points in the same game.[53]\n\nIn the 2006–07 season, Carter was named as a reserve to the 2007 NBA All-Star Game,[54] marking his eighth All-Star appearance.[55] In a 120–114 overtime win over the Washington Wizards on April 7, 2007, Carter and Kidd became the first teammates in over 18 years to record triple-doubles in the same game since the Chicago Bulls' Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen achieved this feat against the Los Angeles Clippers in 1989. Carter finished with 46 points, a career-high 16 rebounds, and 10 assists. Kidd finished with 10 points, tied a career high with 16 rebounds, and tied a season high with 18 assists.[56] Carter finished the 2006–07 season playing all 82 games, averaging over 25 points with a 21 PER.[57]\n\nIn July 2007, Carter re-signed with the Nets to a four-year, $61.8 million contract.[58]\n\nDuring the 2007–08 season, Kidd was traded to the Dallas Mavericks. Carter was credited for becoming a leader following the All-Star break.[59] He became captain of the Nets, and in 2008–09, he and teammate Devin Harris were the highest-scoring starting backcourt in the league.[60] On November 21, 2008, Carter scored a season-high 39 points, including a game winning two-handed reverse dunk, as the Nets battled back from an 18-point deficit to defeat the Toronto Raptors 129–127 in overtime at the Air Canada Centre. He hit a 29-foot, game tying three-pointer to send the game into overtime and then scored the winning basket in the extra period.[61] On February 3, 2009, Carter recorded his fifth career triple-double with 15 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a 99–85 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.[62]\n\nOn June 25, 2009, Carter was traded, along with Ryan Anderson, to the Orlando Magic in exchange for Rafer Alston, Tony Battie and Courtney Lee.[63] Orlando hoped Carter would provide center Dwight Howard with a perimeter scorer who can create his own shot—something the Magic had lacked when they were defeated in the 2009 NBA Finals by the Los Angeles Lakers.[64] On February 8, 2010, Carter had a season-high 48 points, 34 in the second half, when the Magic rallied from a 17-point deficit to defeat the New Orleans Hornets 123–117.[65] Carter helped the Magic reach the Eastern Conference Finals, where they were defeated 4–2 by the Boston Celtics.\n\nOn December 18, 2010, Carter was acquired by the Phoenix Suns along with Marcin Gortat, Mickael Pietrus, and a first-round draft pick in 2011 NBA draft in exchange for Jason Richardson, Hedo Turkoglu, and Earl Clark.[66] On January 17, 2011, Carter recorded 29 points and 12 rebounds in a 129–121 win over the New York Knicks.[67] He reached 20,000 career points during the game, becoming the 37th NBA player to reach that plateau.[68]\n\nOn December 9, 2011, following the conclusion of the NBA lockout, Carter was waived by the Suns, meaning the team only had to pay him $4 million of the $18 million he was due for the 2011–12 season.[69] Carter appeared in 51 games with 41 starts, averaging 13.5 points while shooting 42 percent.[69]\n\nOn December 12, 2011, Carter signed a three-year contract with the defending NBA champion Dallas Mavericks.[70] This move reunited Carter with former Nets teammate Jason Kidd. On April 20, 2012, against the Golden State Warriors, Carter became the eighth player in NBA history with 1,500 3-pointers when he made one in the closing minutes.[71]\n\nWhile known early on in his career for his circus dunks, Carter became known for his 3-point shooting with the Mavericks.[72] On February 13, 2013, in a 123–100 win over the Sacramento Kings, Carter scored 26 points to pass Larry Bird on the NBA's career scoring list, moving him into 29th place.[73] Carter turned aside a Sacramento rally in the third quarter by going 5 of 7 from long range and scoring 17 of Dallas' last 21 points in the period. He ended the night with 21,796 career points for 29th on the all-time list, five ahead of Bird.[72] He also became the 11th NBA player with at least 1,600 3-pointers.[72] He finished the season ranked 27th on the NBA's all-time scoring list with 22,223 career points. His 162 3-pointers tied his career high for 3s made in a season (162-of-397, .408, with Toronto in 2000–01). Over the course of the season, he advanced from 17th place to 11th place on the NBA's all-time 3-point field goals made list (passing Nick Van Exel, Tim Hardaway, Eddie Jones, Glen Rice, Jason Richardson and Kobe Bryant), finishing the year with 1,663 career 3-pointers.[74]\n\nPrior to the 2013–14 season, Carter established himself as the Mavericks' sixth man, after the departure of Jason Terry.[75] He averaged just 10.5 points and shot 37.6% from the field during the first 22 games of the season due to increased responsibilities and pressure to be the team's lone scoring punch off of the bench. He saw his numbers improve in December, averaging 12.5 points and shooting 44.3% from the field during an 18-game stretch.[75] On March 16, 2014, against the Oklahoma City Thunder, Carter raised his career total to 23,010 points, becoming the 27th NBA player to pass the 23,000-point mark with a 3-pointer with 2:17 left in the third quarter.[76] In Game 3 of the Mavericks' first-round playoff series against the San Antonio Spurs, Carter drilled the game-winning 3-pointer with no time remaining on the clock to give the eighth-seeded Mavericks a 109–108 win and a 2–1 series edge over the top-seeded Spurs.[77] The Mavericks went on to lose the series in seven games.[78]\n\nOn July 12, 2014, Carter signed a multi-year deal with the Memphis Grizzlies.[79] On November 13, 2014, he made a game winning alley-oop assist from the sideline to teammate Courtney Lee at the buzzer to win the game 111–110 over the Sacramento Kings.[80] On December 17, 2014, Carter scored a season-high 18 points in a 117–116 triple overtime win over the San Antonio Spurs.[81] Carter moved into 25th in all-time NBA scoring during the game, passing Robert Parish (23,334).[82]\n\nCarter appeared in just one of the Grizzlies' first 12 games of the 2015–16 season.[83] On February 24, 2016, with nine points scored against the Los Angeles Lakers, Carter passed Charles Barkley (23,757) for 24th in career points scored.[84] Two days later, he scored a season-high 19 points in a 112–95 win over the Lakers.[85] For the latter half of April and the whole first round playoff series against the Spurs, Carter was inserted in the starting lineup and played well.[86] In Game 1 against the Spurs, Carter scored a team-high 16 points in a 106–74 loss.[87] The Grizzlies went on to lose the series in four games. After finishing second behind Tim Duncan in the 2014–15 season, Carter was awarded with the Twyman–Stokes Teammate of the Year Award for the 2015–16 season.
