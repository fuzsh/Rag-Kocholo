        "text": "Various snapshots emerged during training camp once the Lakers open their doors in time for the media to watch the final moments of practice.\n\nSome show the starters and reserves scrimmaging against each other. Other times, the Lakers are performing various drills involving pick-and-rolls and their defensive packages. Afterward, most players either receive treatment or work on individual shooting drills.\n\nBut what percentage have the Lakers devoted to both offense and defense well before reporters spill out on the court? Coach Mike D’Antoni sounds cognizant of his reputation that accuses him of being obsessed more with his team’s outscoring their opponents than actually stopping them.\n\n“I would say 99.9 percent on defense and .1 percent on offense,” D’Antoni said, laughing. “Does that satisfy you guys?”\n\nBetween scrimmaging and team drills, D’Antoni then said he’s devoted an equal amount of time going over the team’s offense and defense. How that teaching translates into the Lakers’ defensive performance could play a large part of their failure or success in the 2013-14 season.\n\n“We’re going to have to be a good defensive team for us to do anything,” said Kurt Rambis, who joined D’Antoni’s coaching staff this offseason partly to oversee the team’s defense. “We don’t have guys we can just stick out there who are really good defensively that will just shut everybody down.”\n\nThe Lakers lost two former NBA defensive player of the years this offseason, including Dwight Howard (free agency) and Metta World Peace (waived via amnesty clause). Even with a surgically repaired back, Howard led the league last season with 12.4 rebounds and recorded a fifth-best 2.45 blocks per game. World Peace’s improved conditioning enabled him to bring back images of the former Ron Artest when he limited the league’s top scorers.\n\nThis season, the Lakers’ defensive heavyweights feature some unsuspecting names.\n\nSteve Blake’s feistiness and Jordan Farmar’s experience last season in Turkey as a defensive specialist could offset Steve Nash’s declining footspeed when an unstoppable Russell Westbrook, Chris Paul or Tony Parker drive toward the basket.\n\nThe Lakers hope Wesley Johnson can shed his reputation as an underachieving fourth pick of the 2010 NBA Draft by using his wingspan and athleticism to clog up the perimeter. With Jordan Hill healed from a surgically repaired hip that sidelined him last season for 53 games, his penchant for hustle plays could mitigate a depleted frontline.\n\n“It’s definitely a challenge for us,” Hill said. “We got guys who are athletic and young. We just got to help each other out. That was our problem last season. Everybody wasn’t on the same page on the defensive end.”\n\nOther issues could leave the Lakers defensively disjointed.\n\nThe Lakers haven’t outlined when Kobe Bryant will fully heal his left Achilles tendon. Although they reported full recovery from their respective knee and hamstring injuries, the 33-year-old Pau Gasol and 39-year-old Nash aren’t considered defensive stalwarts.\n\nThe Lakers also have acquired a variety of parts that could help offensive chemistry, including versatile center Chris Kaman and speedy scorer Nick Young. But Kaman lasted one season last year with the Dallas Mavericks partly because he and Dirk Nowitzki hardly auditioned for any defensive awards. D’Antoni already has conceded the trigger-happy Young takes plays off on defense.\n\nHow do the Lakers overcome such variables?\n\n“You have to do it collectively,” D’Antoni said. “I just didn’t think we were into it that much last year. That’s the way it was. We can offset that by team spirit.”\n\nEven with Howard and World Peace last season, the Lakers didn’t thrive in several defensive areas. That included finishing 22nd out of 30 NBA teams in total defense (101.05 points per game), 14th in defensive field-goal percentage (45.3 percent), 15th in 3-point field-goal percentage (35.7 percent) and 29th in fastbreak points allowed (16 points per game).\n\nBreakdowns became normal for reasons including Nash’s lack of speed, Bryant’s gambling, Howard’s diminished athleticism, poor communication and effort. It didn’t help that the Lakers had overlapping injuries and committed an average of 15.1 turnovers per game (22nd overall).\n\nD’Antoni downplayed Rambis’ past experience last season as an analyst for ESPN and Time Warner Cable SportsNet, where he criticized D’Anoni’s preferred style of pace and his initial reluctance to play both Gasol and Howard together. But Rambis spent 10 seasons as an assistant to Phil Jackson with the Lakers and oversaw the team’s defense that limited the Orlando Magic to an average of 91.2 points per game in the 2009 NBA Finals.\n\nRambis ticked off a litany of concepts that could restore the Lakers’ defense, including help defense, communication and effort. He suggested the Lakers can reduce their turnovers and subsequent fastbreak points by slowing the pace when their veteran-laden players are on the court. Rambis also has instructed for the team’s backcourt and wing player to run back on defense following a shot, while the frontcourt should only fight for a rebound if they’re already in the paint.\n\nSaid Rambis: “There’s a wider gap between what you give up in transition points and what you give up in offensive rebounds.”\n\nA week into training camp, Rambis believes “everybody has done a good job.” He also reported improvement in Young’s awareness on rotations, the hustle Blake and Jodie Meeks show, Johnson’s speed, and Gasol and Kaman helping out on pick-and-rolls. Should the Lakers adhere to these concepts, how good will they be on defense?\n\n“They can be very good but I’d be stretching it if I said great,” Rambis said. “We’re striving to get into the top 10 in terms of both our defensive and offensive efficiency.”\n\nSuch metrics involve equating the team’s points per 100 possessions and the opponent’s effective field-goal percentage (includes 3-pointers). Last season, the Lakers allowed 103.6 points per 100 possessions (18th) and their opponents effective field-goal percentage hovered at 49.7 percent (16th). Hence, why Rambis said the Lakers are working a “good chunk” on defense, though D’Antoni argues nothing beats game simulations to make up for such shortcomings.\n\n“One team’s got the ball (in a scrimmage) so they’re on offense and working on offense. The other team is defense, So it’s really 100 percent on both,” D’Antoni said. “You mostly learn to play and we play a lot. And when you play a lot, hopefully we’re working on our defense all the time.”"
