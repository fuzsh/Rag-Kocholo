Steve Blake was signed of Friday by the Sydney Kings of the Australian National Basketball League per ESPN’s Marc Stein.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nKings coach Andrew Gaze commented on the signing, via Real GM:\n\n“Any time you have someone of that experience it means a lot,” coach Andrew Gaze said. “He’s played at the highest level for such a long period of time. He’s played with some of the greatest players in the world.\n\n“The role that we have for him is something that is going to be an adjustment for us and an adjustment for him, and hopefully it can all work out and be beneficial for both.”\n\nBlake was acquired from the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Quincy Miller in July of 2015. He played 58 games for the Pistons, starting two. He averaged 4.4 points and 3.4 assists per game, shooting 38.8 percent from the field and 34.4 percent from three-point range.\n\nMore from PistonPowered\n\nThis article originally appeared on\n\nGet more from National Basketball Association Follow your favorites to get information about games, news and more"
