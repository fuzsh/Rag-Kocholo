        "text": "The Twitter threats to Steve Blake, his wife and their three young sons have been reported to police authorities and NBA security officials for further investigation, Lakers general manager Mitch Kupchak said before Game 3 Friday night.\n\nBlake’s wife, Kristen, reported she had blocked 500 Twitter accounts after receiving profane threats after Blake missed what would have been the go-ahead 3-pointer in the closing seconds of the Lakers’ loss in Game 2 Wednesday.\n\nThe insults continued Thursday and Friday, however.\n\n“That gets me emotional right now,” Lakers coach Mike Brown said. “I feel bad for his family, for him. That shouldn’t be a part of life. To have somebody do stuff like that, to attack your family, your kids.\n\n“No. I don’t like that. I feel bad for him.\n\n“You understand the passion and the love people have for this team. I respect that. I respect you guys (reporters) saying what you say about me and Steve. That’s your job and you respect people saying that. But golly, everybody has families.\n\n“You hate to say it, but he’s just got to get himself ready for the game. When I saw it, it’s a shame, it’s a doggone shame. You want to say something about me or him, that’s fine. But the wife and the kids? Come on, give me a break.”\n\nGasol honored\n\nThe Lakers kept the J. Walter Kennedy Citizenship Award in house.\n\nPau Gasol was named the 2011-12 winner for showing outstanding service and dedication to the community for his work on behalf of UNICEF, one season after Metta World Peace was honored for his work in promoting mental health awareness.\n\nGasol has been a UNICEF ambassador for seven years.\n\nMembers of the Professional Basketball Writers Association voted on the award. Other finalists this season were Josh Smith of the Atlanta Hawks, Jason Terry of the Dallas Mavericks and J.J. Redick of the Orlando Magic.\n\n“It’s special,” Gasol said. “It’s very meaningful.”\n\nGasol, a 7-foot power forward from Spain, began his charity work with St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis when he was a rookie with the Grizzlies. He, his younger brother, Marc, and their parents also have worked with St. Jude.\n\n“It’s a fitting award,” Brown said. “At times, because he’s known as a nice guy, people don’t appreciate the value he brings not only on the floor but off the floor to an organization. So, it’s a great award for him. I’m happy for him and his family.”\n\nIn addition to Gasol and World Peace (the former Ron Artest), other Lakers to win the award are: Michael Cooper (1985-86) and Magic Johnson (1991-92).\n\nThe award is named for Kennedy, a former NBA commissioner.\n\nGetting defensive\n\nThe Lakers’ 77-75 defeat to the Thunder in Game 2 Wednesday marked the first time since the introduction of the shot clock in 1954-55 that they had lost a playoff game when holding an opponent to 77 points or fewer.\n\nThey were 13-0 before Wednesday’s loss, including a memorable 89-67 defeat of the Boston Celtics in Game 6 of the 2010 Finals. They used that victory as a springboard to an 83-79 win in Game 7 and a second consecutive NBA championship."
