        "text": "by Ben Liebowitz on SportsRaid.com\n\nWhen NBA fans think “best draft ever,” the 2003 draft often comes to mind, which saw superstars LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Chris Bosh and Dwyane Wade all selected in the top five picks.\n\nAnd while that class holds up as arguably the best ever when expanded out to solid second-round picks like Kyle Korver, Mo Williams and Zaza Pachulia, if you delve just a little deeper into draft history, another year stands out for the magnitude of the stars it produced. The year was 1996, when future league legends like Kobe Bryant and Allen Iverson realized their dreams of becoming NBA players.\n\nAs is the case with every draft, however, teams didn’t exactly get it right. For instance, Bryant — a future five-time champion and 18-time All-Star — fell to No. 13 overall before being selected by the Charlotte Hornets.\n\nFollowing Bryant’s retirement, PointAfter, a sports data visualization site that’s part of the Graphiq network, set out to right the wrongs by re-picking the ’96 draft. Based on each player’s career win shares (an estimate of the number of wins contributed to a team by a player) and accolades (All-NBA teams, MVPs, championship rings, All-Star berths, etc.), we re-ordered the draft to better reflect the “correct” order in terms of how guys panned out in the pros.\n\nNote: There are 29 first-round draft slots because 29 NBA franchises existed in 1996, rather than today’s total of 30.\n\n#1. Kobe Bryant\n\nKobe Bryant | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Philadelphia 76ers\n\nOriginal Slot for Bryant: No. 13\n\nOriginal No. 1 Pick: Allen Iverson\n\nCareer Win Shares: 172.7\n\nIn the re-draft, former MVP and two-time Finals MVP Kobe Bryant gets selected with the No. 1 overall pick by the Philadelphia 76ers. Though this would negate the Allen Iverson era in Philly, it’s a perfect fit in the sense that Bryant was born in Philadelphia and attended high school in Pennsylvania at Lower Merion.\n\n#2. Steve Nash\n\nSteve Nash | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Toronto Raptors\n\nOriginal Slot for Nash: No. 15\n\nOriginal No. 2 Pick: Marcus Camby\n\nCareer Win Shares: 129.7\n\nCanadian point guard Steve Nash gets to hoop in Canada via PointAfter’s re-draft process. The Toronto Raptors actually made an attempt to acquire Nash back in 2012, and they even grossly overpaid former second-round pick Landry Fields to block Nash’s path to the New York Knicks in the process.\n\nUltimately, the two-time MVP was shipped to the Los Angeles Lakers, where his career crumbled due to injuries.\n\n#3. Allen Iverson\n\nAllen Iverson | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Vancouver Grizzlies (Memphis Grizzlies)\n\nOriginal Slot for Iverson: No. 1\n\nOriginal No. 3 Pick: Shareef Abdur-Rahim\n\nCareer Win Shares: 99.0\n\n“The Answer” was often referred to during his NBA career as the best pound-for-pound basketball player ever. Listed at 165 pounds and a (perhaps generous) 6 feet tall, A.I. proved the meaning of the phrase “height doesn’t measure heart.”\n\nHe won the league’s Most Valuable Player award in 2001, the same year he dragged a mediocre supporting cast all the way to the NBA Finals.\n\n#4. Ray Allen\n\nRay Allen | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Milwaukee Bucks\n\nOriginal Slot for Allen: No. 5\n\nOriginal No. 4 Pick: Stephon Marbury\n\nCareer Win Shares: 145.1\n\nThe NBA’s all-time leader in three-point field goals ends up with the franchise where he started his career (Milwaukee). In the re-draft, however, the Bucks take him straight up, rather than selecting Marbury and shipping him to Minnesota in exchange for Allen on draft night.\n\nA deadly sharpshooter, the man otherwise known as “Jesus Shuttlesworth” spent most of his NBA career as an elite scorer before reinventing himself as a complimentary piece on championship teams in Boston and Miami.\n\n#5. Ben Wallace\n\nNBA Leaders in Defensive Player of the Year Awards | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nOriginal Slot for Wallace: Undrafted\n\nOriginal No. 5 Pick: Ray Allen\n\nCareer Win Shares: 93.5\n\nAs an undrafted free agent out of Virginia Union University, Ben Wallace signed with the Washington Bullets in October 1996. It took a number of years for “Big Ben” to find his niche in the NBA, but that eventually happened when he was traded to the Detroit Pistons.\n\nWhile in Motown, Wallace made four All-Star teams and won a record four Defensive Player of the Year awards. Known for his elite rim protection and towering afro, Wallace swiftly became a fan favorite in Detroit.\n\n#6. Marcus Camby\n\nMarcus Camby | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Boston Celtics\n\nOriginal Slot for Camby: No. 2\n\nOriginal No. 6 Pick: Antoine Walker\n\nCareer Win Shares: 81.6\n\nThough Camby didn’t win four Defensive Player of the Year awards during his career, the University of Massachusetts Amherst product did establish himself as an elite defender in his own right.\n\nThe lanky center with unmistakable Chinese character tattoos on his right bicep won DPOY honors in 2007. He also made two All-Defensive First Teams, two All-Defensive Second Teams and led the league in blocks four times.\n\n#7. Jermaine O’Neal\n\nJermaine O’Neal | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Los Angeles Clippers\n\nOriginal Slot for O’Neal: No. 17\n\nOriginal No. 7 Pick: Lorenzen Wright\n\nCareer Win Shares: 66.0\n\nJermaine O’Neal won the league’s Most Improved Player award for the 2001–02 season after blossoming as a go-to interior scorer with the Indiana Pacers. From there, he finished third in MVP voting in 2004 behind other dominant bigs Kevin Garnett and Tim Duncan.\n\nO’Neal experienced an elite basketball peak, but it didn’t last very long due to a rash of injuries.\n\n#8. Peja Stojakovic\n\nPeja Stojakovic | PointAfter\n\nTeam: New Jersey Nets (Brooklyn Nets)\n\nOriginal Slot for Stojakovic: No. 14\n\nOriginal No. 8 Pick: Kerry Kittles\n\nCareer Win Shares: 82.6\n\nPeja Stojakovic is remembered as one of the league’s best three-point shooters of all time. What fans may not recall is just how stellar the Serbian was in his prime.\n\nEarly in his career for the Sacramento Kings, Stojakovic made three consecutive All-Star teams. He averaged 24.2 points, 6.3 rebounds and 2.1 assists during the 2003–04 season, finishing fourth in MVP voting (directly behind Jermaine O’Neal) as a result.\n\n#9. Stephon Marbury\n\nStephon Marbury | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Dallas Mavericks\n\nOriginal Slot for Marbury: No. 4\n\nOriginal No. 9 Pick: Samaki Walker\n\nCareer Win Shares: 77.5\n\nStephon Marbury bounced around quite a bit during his NBA career. After being drafted No. 4 overall by the Milwaukee Bucks, “Starbury” was traded on draft night to the Minnesota Timberwolves. From there, he was traded to the New Jersey Nets, then to the Phoenix Suns, then again to the New York Knicks.\n\nMarbury spent his final NBA season with the Boston Celtics in 2008–09 before moving on to play overseas in China. In the Chinese Basketball Association, Marbury has become an absolute legend. He’s won three CBA championships with the Beijing Ducks, and has been named a CBA All-Star six times.\n\n#10. Shareef Abdur-Rahim\n\nShareef Abdur-Rahim | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Indiana Pacers\n\nOriginal Slot for Abdur-Rahim: No. 3\n\nOriginal No. 10 Pick: Erick Dampier\n\nCareer Win Shares: 71.2\n\nAlthough Shareef Abdur-Rahim only made one All-Star team during his NBA tenure, his per-game averages are impossible to ignore. He averaged at least 20 points and seven rebounds in five consecutive seasons from age 21 to 25, then missed out on a sixth straight by 0.1 points per contest.\n\nHe wasn’t nearly as effective after the fact, but he still retired with averages of 18.1 points and 7.5 rebounds.\n\n#11. Antoine Walker\n\nAntoine Walker | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Golden State Warriors\n\nOriginal Slot for Walker: No. 6\n\nOriginal No. 11 Pick: Todd Fuller\n\nCareer Win Shares: 38.1\n\nAntoine Walker’s 38.1 career win shares rank 14th among players drafted in 1996. It’s his three All-Star berths, rather, that prevent him from dropping any lower in the re-draft.\n\n“Toine” was a very productive player for the Boston Celtics during the late 1990s and early 2000s, averaging 20.6 points over the course of eight seasons while being an occasional threat from beyond the arc.\n\n#12. Zydrunas Ilgauskas\n\nZydrunas Ilgauskas | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nOriginal Slot for Ilgauskas: No. 20\n\nOriginal No. 12 Pick: Vitaly Potapenko\n\nCareer Win Shares: 66.3\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers still wind up with franchise favorite Zydrunas Ilgauskas in the re-draft, but they have to take him eight spots higher than they did originally.\n\n“Big Z” spent 12 of his 13 NBA seasons in Cleveland and made two All-Star teams there after missing the entire 1999–00 season due to reconstructive foot surgery. The procedure, called an osteotomy, involves realigning the bones in the foot to more evenly distribute weight and prevent future fractures. It was unclear at the time if Ilgauskas would ever play again, but he thrived after the injury forced him to miss significant time.\n\n#13. Derek Fisher\n\nDerek Fisher | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Charlotte Hornets\n\nOriginal Slot for Fisher: No. 24\n\nOriginal No. 13 Pick: Kobe Bryant\n\nCareer Win Shares:\n\nThis would be viewed as a massive downgrade for the Charlotte Hornets if they had decided to hang onto Kobe Bryant back in 1996. Instead, they decided to trade him to the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for Vlade Divac, so they did the damage to themselves.\n\nFisher, who carved a niche as one of the game’s most productive role players while suiting up for the Los Angeles Lakers, won five championship rings in a Lakers jersey.\n\n#14. Kerry Kittles\n\nKerry Kittles | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Sacramento Kings\n\nOriginal Slot for Kittles: No. 8\n\nOriginal No. 14 Pick: Peja Stojakovic\n\nCareer Win Shares: 44.8\n\nKerry Kittles was a decorated college athlete at Villanova, but the extent of his accolades in the NBA end at All-Rookie Second Team.\n\nThat doesn’t mean Kittles wasn’t a solid player at the next level. He averaged 15.2 points on 37.8 percent shooting from long range in his career, and he was a key cog of the Nets teams that made back-to-back NBA Finals appearances in the early 2000s.\n\n#15. Jerome Williams\n\nJerome Williams | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Phoenix Suns\n\nOriginal Slot for Williams: No. 26\n\nOriginal No. 15 Pick: Steve Nash\n\nCareer Win Shares: 37.9\n\nWith Nash off the board all the way up at No. 2 overall in the re-draft, the Phoenix Suns have to pivot and take Jerome Williams. Nicknamed the “Junkyard Dog” for his uncanny ability to do all the dirty work on the court, Williams cobbled together a successful (though unspectacular) NBA career.\n\n#16. Erick Dampier\n\nErick Dampier | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Charlotte Hornets\n\nOriginal Slot for Dampier: No. 10\n\nOriginal No. 16 Pick: Tony Delk\n\nCareer Win Shares: 52.7\n\nErick Dampier played 16 seasons in the NBA, mostly spent as a productive starting center. Though he posted respectable numbers, he’s perhaps best remembered for being called “Ericka Dampier” by fellow big man Shaquille O’Neal.\n\n#17. Chucky Atkins\n\nChucky Atkins | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Portland Trail Blazers\n\nOriginal Slot for Atkins: Undrafted\n\nOriginal No. 17 Pick: Jermaine O’Neal\n\nCareer Win Shares: 27.9\n\nChucky Atkins is the second player in the re-draft who originally went undrafted back in 1996. He didn’t suit up in the NBA until he was already 25 years old, but he played 11 seasons as a reliable point guard — both in a backup and starting capacity.\n\nAs a rookie with the Orlando Magic, Atkins played all 82 regular season games off the bench and notched a career-best assist percentage of 30.9.\n\n#18. Lorenzen Wright\n\nLorenzen Wright | PointAfter\n\nTeam: New York Knicks\n\nOriginal Slot for Wright: No. 7\n\nOriginal No. 18 Pick: John Wallace\n\nCareer Win Shares: 30.5\n\nOriginally drafted No. 7 overall by the Los Angeles Clippers (a franchise not renowned for its abilities to scout big-time talents), Lorenzen Wright didn’t move the needle much in the NBA.\n\nHe turned in some solid seasons when he moved on to the Memphis Grizzlies, but his numbers tailed off after his 30th birthday.\n\n#19. Malik Rose\n\nMalik Rose | PointAfter\n\nTeam: New York Knicks\n\nOriginal Slot for Rose: No. 44\n\nOriginal No. 19 Pick: Walter McCarty\n\nCareer Win Shares: 26.5\n\nThe Charlotte Hornets originally drafted Malik Rose in the second round, No. 44 overall back in 1996. A year later, they waived him.\n\nRose then signed as a free agent with the San Antonio Spurs. Under head coach Gregg Popovich, Rose would win two championship rings (in 1999 and 2003) alongside Tim Duncan and Co.\n\n#20. Tony Delk\n\nTeam: Cleveland Cavaliers\n\nOriginal Slot for Delk: No. 16\n\nOriginal No. 20 Pick: Zydrunas Ilgauskas\n\nCareer Win Shares: 19.5\n\nTony Delk was a true journeyman during his playing days, suiting up for eight different teams during his stint in the NBA before playing overseas in Greece (where he won a Euroleague championship in 2007) and Puerto Rico.\n\nThe highlight of Delk’s career occurred in a Phoenix Suns jersey, when he scored a career-high 53 points in a loss against the Sacramento Kings. Interestingly, he amassed those 53 points without converting a single three-pointer. He finished the game 20-of-27 from the field and 13-of-15 from the free throw line.\n\nAt the time of writing, Delk is one of just 118 players in NBA history to score at least 50 points in a game.\n\n#21. Othella Harrington\n\nOthella Harrington | PointAfter\n\nTeam: New York Knicks\n\nOriginal Slot for Harrington: No. 30\n\nOriginal No. 21 Pick: Dontae’ Jones\n\nCareer Win Shares: 23.1\n\nA big man out of Georgetown, Othella Harrington maxed out as an NBA player in 1999–00 with the Vancouver Grizzlies. He averaged 13.1 points and 6.9 rebounds that season while starting all 82 games and converting 50.6 percent of his field goals.\n\nAside from that, he was merely a solid role player who posted respectable per-36-minute numbers.\n\n#22. Shandon Anderson\n\nShandon Anderson | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Vancouver Grizzlies (Memphis Grizzlies)\n\nOriginal Slot for Anderson: No. 54\n\nOriginal No. 22 Pick: Roy Rogers\n\nCareer Win Shares: 23.6\n\nShandon Anderson was selected in the second round, No. 54 overall by the Utah Jazz back in 1996. He finished his career 18th in the draft class with 23.6 win shares.\n\nThe former Georgia Bulldog was nothing more than a decent scorer in his career. He retired following the 2005–06 season when he won a championship ring with the Miami Heat.\n\n#23. Adrian Griffin\n\nAdrian Griffin | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Denver Nuggets\n\nOriginal Slot for Griffin: Undrafted\n\nOriginal No. 23 Pick: Efthimi Rentzias\n\nCareer Win Shares: 16.3\n\nAdrian Griffin played nine seasons in the NBA after going undrafted in 1996. His three seasons spent with the Dallas Mavericks were easily his best, as he compiled 9.3 of his career 16.3 win shares in a Mavs jersey.\n\nGriffin now serves as an assistant coach for the Orlando Magic.\n\n#24. Vitaly Potapenko\n\nVitaly Potapenko | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Los Angeles Lakers\n\nOriginal Slot for Potapenko: No. 12\n\nOriginal No. 24 Pick: Derek Fisher\n\nCareer Win Shares: 15.5\n\nA 6-foot-10 center, Vitaly Potapenko of the Ukraine played parts of 11 seasons in the NBA. He wasn’t particularly adept on either end of the court, but he had staying power due to his sheer size (add 280 pounds of bulk to that 6-foot-10 frame).\n\n#25. Walter McCarty\n\nWalter McCarty | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Utah Jazz\n\nOriginal Slot for McCarty: No. 19\n\nOriginal No. 25 Pick: Martin Muursepp\n\nCareer Win Shares: 13.7\n\nThe New York Knicks took 6-foot-10 forward Walter McCarty No. 19 overall back in 1996 with one of their three first-round selections. In the re-draft, McCarty slips to No. 25 overall.\n\nAlthough McCarty wasn’t very skilled in any one aspect of the game, he did develop into a sound three-point shooter at age 27. He drained a career-high 39.4 percent of his triples for the Boston Celtics in 2001–02 and retired with a career percentage of 34.6 from beyond the arc.\n\n#26. Erick Strickland\n\nErick Strickland | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Detroit Pistons\n\nOriginal Slot for Strickland: Undrafted\n\nOriginal No. 26 Pick: Jerome Williams\n\nCareer Win Shares: 13.4\n\nYet another undrafted player to make his way into the first round of the 1996 re-draft, Erick Strickland peaked with one great season on the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nThroughout the 1999–00 season, Strickland averaged 12.8 points, 4.8 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 1.5 steals while suiting up as the Mavs’ starting shooting guard. He never reached those numbers again.\n\n#27. Samaki Walker\n\nSamaki Walker | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Orlando Magic\n\nOriginal Slot for Walker: No. 9\n\nOriginal No. 27 Pick: Brian Evans\n\nCareer Win Shares: 14.2\n\nOutside of Todd Fuller, who was drafted No. 11 overall back in 1996 and fell completely out of the first round of his re-draft, Samaki Walker took the biggest tumble.\n\nOriginally a top-10 pick who went to the Mavericks, Walker and his career averages of 5.3 points and 4.7 rebounds slip nearly out of the first round altogether. In 10 NBA seasons, Walker suited up for six different franchises.\n\n#28. Moochie Norris\n\nMoochie Norris | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Atlanta Hawks\n\nOriginal Slot for Norris: No. 33\n\nOriginal No. 28 Pick: Priest Lauderdale\n\nCareer Win Shares: 10.0\n\nPerhaps best remembered for his lofty afro, Moochie Norris played the majority of his NBA career (parts of seven seasons) with the Houston Rockets.\n\nA left-handed point guard, Norris played in the Continental Basketball Association, United States Basketball League, France and Italy in addition to his NBA tenure.\n\n#29. Travis Knight\n\nTravis Knight | PointAfter\n\nTeam: Chicago Bulls\n\nOriginal Slot for Knight: No. 29\n\nOriginal No. 29 Pick: Travis Knight\n\nCareer Win Shares: 7.9\n\nA 7-footer out of UConn, Travis Knight is the only player in the re-draft who retains the same draft position from 1996. With the final selection of the first round, the Chicago Bulls stick with Knight.\n\nInterestingly, Knight never suited up for the Bulls in his NBA career, because Chicago released him less than one month after drafting him in 1996. While playing for the Boston Celtics under head coach Rick Pitino in 1997–98, Knight peaked by averaging 6.5 points, 4.9 rebounds and 1.1 blocks. He was out of the league by age 28."
