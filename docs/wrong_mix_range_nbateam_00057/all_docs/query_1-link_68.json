        "text": "Just over thirty minutes into the NBA’s 2020 Free Agency period, reports began to circulate that the Orlando Magic have agreed to deals with a couple of young players that will add needed depth to their roster in ‘20-’21.\n\nVincent Goodwill of Yahoo Sports first broke the news that Dwayne Bacon would be joining the Orlando Magic on a two-year deal. Bacon (25) is a third-year wing who boasts career averages of 5.3 points and 2.3 rebounds (135 career games, 30 career starts, 16.0 minutes per game). Bacon is a career 40.3 percent shooter from the floor, 34.5 percent from behind the three-point line.\n\nThe Lakeland, Florida native has spent all three years of his career playing for the Charlotte Hornets. Bacon was coached his rookie season by current Magic head coach Steve Clifford. An FSU product, Bacon also played collegiately with Magic forward Jonathan Isaac.\n\nNews came in from Josh Robbins of The Athletic shortly after the initial agreement came to light that Orlando’s reported deal with Bacon will be for the league minimum (with a team option in the second year).\n\nOrlando has also made another reported deal with 20 year-old Canadian guard Karim Mane, agreeing to offer Mane one of their two two-way deals."
