        "text": "Unicorn Unleashed-Kristaps Porzingiz\n\nThe Phil Jackson nod. That’s all it took for the slender Latvian to become the great new hope of the New York Knicks. In the mecca of playgrounds and hardwoods where Kenny Anderson once dazzled fans with handles so fresh, as the pillared pride of the New York baller. Not since Patrick Ewing, have the Knick’s hopes bet so heavily on a youngster. The Knicks have slummed in the gutter of NBA basketball, since they traded away their devalued franchise player decades ago. Since Ewing, there was the disaster that was Stephon Marbury, Zach Randolph’s burger binge, David Lee’s inflated stat line, Raymond Felton’s existence, a brief high of Linsanity, Amare’s shaky knees and finally the New York state of Melo. The superstar that was dubbed the savior of the franchise, rummaging through Derick Fisher’s bitch Slapping and Kurt Rambis’s 80s mustache. Melo has been the punching bag of the franchise, some necessary, most arbitrary.\n\nFast forward to the 2015 draft; Knicks fans subdued, as the lost season was destined to amount to a promise the big city was thirsting for. All eyes were on D’angelo Russel and Jahlil Okafor, two franchise cornerstones touted to change the landscape of any franchise. Tested in the battle infested NCAA, Russel was a sleek shooting crafty guard that looked like a lefty version of Steph Curry. The latter, was the most dominant big man in college, leading the blue Devils and the nation in domination. In the midst of all the hoopla, a skinny Latvian workout video appeared with the stalking frame of Phil Jackson hawking from the rafters. Kristap’s Porzingis’s workout was off the charts. No contact drills showed skills at 7’3 never seen before. It also showed a sniper like shooting touch that was unswerving, easy and barely tickling the twine. Jackson was in a bind, divided by a couple of so called “safe” choices and his gut, his gut was probably right.\n\nKristaps Porzingiz is the future. A do it all giant that shoots 3s from Steph range and leap frogs over players for blocks and dynamic rock your face off rim rockers. The unicorn is real, even though he looks like a created a player that would only exist on NBA 2k, this unicorn exists.\n\nIf we look closer at KP, he was actually created by his brothers, his coaches and mentors. They prepared him early for this moment. His shot mechanics and insatiable attitude are there to prove it. GMs questioned KPs thin frame and particularly his base. An issue he has addressed by adding more weight to his core. Continuing his progress into one of the most double teamed players of the 16-17 season, the youngster’s most challenging obstacle is his on ball defense, particularly with gaurds on a switch. It is almost redundant that foreign players are questioned with delicate softness. Questions early on about KP’s love for the game were squashed after 2 put back dunks mesmerized the garden faithful with a roar. These doubts come from an even keel Kristaps, spoon fed the game. Many tall young men are berated to play basketball at a young age. As hard as it is for any athlete to be a select member of the NBA, it is empirically common for 7 footers to play in the NBA at one point or another. There is an astonishing fact that roughly 10% of 7 footers worldwide have played in the NBA in some capacity. What really raises GM’s eye brows, is when they see a European 7-footer draining jumpers like Dirk and looking like a created player who was born on a game console.\n\nAs for the Knicks, they are at a cross roads of sorts when it comes to catering for KP’s rise. Is Carmelo Anthony the best fit for KP’s development ? Is he better off becoming a focal point now and learn by trial and FML? Does the potential rise of the Knicks back to the playoffs bode well for a young KP?\n\nLots of questions, fairy tale answers, about one unicorn that this state of mind was built for.\n\nMuch love and basketball,\n\nRambeeni\n\nCharlie V is Dirk Nowitzki\n\nIt wasn’t Steph Curry and his undefeated Warriors, nor was it my Fisher bashing that pushed me to write about basketball again nor was it Kobe’s last dance, it was the hairless mamba. Thank you for the readers that still visit my blog, despite my nonexistent contribution of late. I work and I coach, so I apologize for not writing. Here we go…\n\nMy brother is a die-hard Mavs fan and I don’t blame him. He’s 8 years younger than I am and has already witnessed a championship season, a feat my Knicks haven’t accomplished in my lifetime. Little bro loves Dirk, (who doesn’t?) and his Mavs are regularly atop the Western conference standings year after year. Great management and fantastic coaching. Rick Carlisle finds lost players and makes them system contributors every season. The list is long, players that fall off the radar only to return to the Mavs to maximize their potential, the sure sign of an elite coach and franchise. Here is a recap of said players: JJ Barea, Devin Harris, Raymond fukin Felton, Mcgee (on the way), Deshawn Stevenson, Peja Stojakovic ( championship season) and many others. Great coaching, defined roles and most importantly wins, good for them.\n\nEnter one Charlie V, an NBA rat, not a gym rat, just a player that seems to hang around longer than he should. After signing a huge contract with Detroit, he disappeared and disappointed then withered away on NBA benches. All of a sudden he comes out gun slinging this season with Dallas, acting like Dirk coming of the bench. This was funny for 2 reasons, first off Charlie V doesn’t look like a solid NBA power forward, sure he can shoot, but he has tiny shoulders with lazy and uninterested body language. The second reason is its freakin Charlie V, how is this not hilarious? He’s draining floaters, put back dunks and shoots with the confidence of a young Drazen Petrovic. The jokes continued all throughout our Mavs league pass watch. I would say “Dude, Charlie V is going Dirk on ‘em.” and it was somehow true. In today’s fantasy infused social media Steph curry religious like fanfare, Charlie V has gone unnoticed clocking 11 minutes per game. I’m here to change that with the standard per 36 mins stats. I know it doesn’t account for stamina or efficiency, but as you can see Charlie V is a mini Dirk Nowitzki. As funny as it is, the truth is kinda in the numbers. His per 36 minute stats destroy Vucevic’s stats from Orlando for example. Here is how he has become a mini clone of Dirk.\n\nGo on NBA advanced stats and match him with other starting power forwards and you will see the light of Charlie V. At first, I wondered how Chalie had the legs, since he looked old at 21, he’s still only 31 and doing this!\n\nIf you catch the Mavs this season, keep an eye out for the hairless mamba, ready to launch Steph Curryesque threes if given the opportunity, or brick his life away. We will never know, but here’s a shout out to Charlie V and all the minis out there. The unheralded clones of greats, that nobody will likely remember. The proverbial we shall not forget the Mavs’ bench assassin that entertained when the stadium was empty.\n\nMuch love and basketball,\n\nRambeeni\n\nArakji’s NBA Briefcase\n\nI wrote an article about Al Riadi’s future stars about a year ago called Al Riadi’s future is left handedhttp:// https://rambeeni.wordpress.com/2014/03/31/al-riyadis-future-is-left-handed/. The article featured overviews and interviews with Amir Saoud and Ali Haidar. The story was supposed to include three of Riadi’s players, Wael Arakji (NBA prospect) being the 3rd exciting young lefty.\n\nUnfortunately, Wael was injured at the time and hadn’t been active for a few months. Fast forward a year later and Arakji is on the NBA radar. When I first heard of Wael’s early draft entry, I was amused and felt a glow of possibility followed by a dose of reality.\n\nThe NBA is one of the most difficult professional leagues to break into. Only 60 players are drafted each year and only 30 1st round picks have guaranteed contracts, while the other 30 are acquired by NBA teams without the promise of a roster spot. A 2nd round pick simply means a team has dibs on a certain player, but does not mean this player will make the roster.\n\nThis article is for scouts. As much as I love Wael’s game I will try to be as objective as possible. I have watched Wael for 4 years, at the pro and school level. I have played pick up with Wael more than 5 times at the American university of Beirut. Here is a short scouting report.\n\nWael is a composed, well rounded point gaurd, rebounds and finds his temmates and never gives up on a play. He is long and has great defensive prowess. He knows when to help and when to stay at home on defense. At 6’3, he is a point gaurd with above average IQ that loves to break down the defense and almost always makes the right play. Although his shot is known to be lagging compared to his ball penetration and court awarness, he actually does shoot a solid percentage from the mid range and from the corner 3-point shot. The truth is he waits for better shots.\n\nThe NBA is a pick and roll league and he is an expert at finding the defensive weakeness in any set. Arakji is not a glory hunter. He simply makes the right play, be it a weak side skip pass to a shooter, a roll or pop: Arakji surveys and executes. If defenses leave an inch of an opening in the lane, he will find it and finish with care, strength and efficiency. This is Wael’s greatest skill, his manuesque craftiness to get to the rim. The one glaring weakness is his shot off the dribble.\n\nWe can talk basketball all you want, but here are a few things alot of outsiders do not know. Wael has flourished in every pressure situation during his young career. That, along with his skills and size, makes me hopeful that an NBA team will snag Arakji somewhere in the 2nd round. He has no fear, he has zero self doubt. He forgets the bad possessions and carries on. He plays like he expects to improve everyday and he doesn’t settle.\n\nThere were two Instances that I will never forget about this player that separate him from other good young players. Last year’s Dubai final that involved a double overtime final thriller between Riadi and arch rivals Sagesse. The stage was set and fans were treated to a shootout of the highest caliber. Sagesse attempted to foul Arakji in overtime multiple times, trying to use his youth against him. The pressure was high and Arakji closed out the double overtime win with ice cold free throws and wanted the ball amongst a team of wily veterans. Another is a regular season game where riadi were facing an improbable loss against a weaker team and had just conceded a corner 3 to put Riadi down 1. With 2 seconds left, Wael sprinted down the court faster than the camera could change direction and drained a last second jumper, no doubt.\n\nWhat scouts and GMs don’t know and will find out is Wael’s humility. He is a rising Lebanese star and acts like any other player that loves the game. He loves being on a team and appreciates the moment. He has the attitude of a true team player and is gracious with all fans.\n\nAs a high school and college stand out, Wael once scored 74 points, raining 3s and scoring at will. As a pro, fans have not seen scoring outbursts yet, as he has adjusted to play on the best pro team in the region, making him a fresh multiple champion.\n\nCoach Jad Fattouh, who was Arajki’s Riadi’s assistant coach and current Mega Leks’ assistant coach in Serbia goes on to say: “Wael is a talented kid with great work ethics, I think he should start playing and developing at the European level as a first step then we’ll go from there and sky is the limit…”\n\nCurrent Riadi assistant and long time youth coach Ahmad Farran added that Arakji has “huge chances”. When asked about Wael’s new challenge, Farran added: ” I think he needs to improve his shot and work hard, its his only weakness. He’s a geat pick and roll player with great vision and leadership. His size for his position is ideal and he has gained valuable experience the last 3 yrs with Riyadi.”\n\nMy hope and prediction is that Wael should be drafted by an NBA team in the late 2nd round. Teams are not afraid to take a risk there and if these gms have met Wael and seen his play, he will get a shot at a roster. Whatever happens, this experience will only make him stronger and hungrier to move forward. A young man with purpose and dreams. Talent coupled with hard work, intellect and a basketball body. The NBA is cut throat, but so is Wael when he sees an open seem.\n\nMuch love and basketball,\n\nRambeeni\n\nAddition by Subtraction\n\nThis one’s for the bball junkies, enough about the Lehman basketball talk, let’s get into the gritty details that affect a team. Arguably the most interesting stat of the last decade has been the +/- barometer of each player, the report card behind the eye test. Who makes a positive or negative impact, half of this being the newly instated Josh Smith rule. Today, Rambeeni basketball will take a look at NBA players that may benefit their teams by simply leaving, by pulling an ACL, by eating too much candy, or by dating a Kardashian. We will list the candidates that need a change of scenery or just need a flight straight to China. We’ll also mention a few underrated players as well as players that usually just add rather than subtract.\n\nThe Josh Smith mystery was never a secret; Bill Simmons and Zach Lowe had been bewildered by his shot chart for years, waving red flags about Smith, shining light on his new levels of degradation. Stan Van Gundy finally heard the call and the stats along with their record were wounds that proved too deep to overlook. The result? The Pistons dumped all that money down the drain to get rid of Smith and ended up going on a winning streak that looks to have them in the playoffs within the substandard east. Simmons called this the Ewing rule because of the Knicks ’99 finals run when Ewing was injured and the Knicks rallied, but Simmons can suck on a 7 foot Jamaican for that statement. What Simmons didn’t mention was that the Knicks switched to a young and gun style with Spree and Houston running the break in ‘99, a style that fit Marcus Camby like a glove. It was not Patrick’s deficiencies, it was a fit issue. Patrick Ewing is the best Knick to ever play and Simmons’ Ewing rule is just another Knick tirade that Simmons dishes out on a monthly basis. Josh Smith ( Rudy Gay) is the King of addition by subtraction; let’s look at other candidates that need to be slapped in the face.\n\nWe used the help of nba.com advanced stats to look at the Net ratings for players averaging more than 15 minutes to determine who is crap and who is a winner. The net rating is the difference between offensive and defensive player efficiency in respect to team scores per 100 possessions. This is a little tricky because the whole Golden state team is at the top and most of the losing team’s players are at the bottom, I’ll curve it out to reason and disparities using the simple plus/minus stat, let’s see what we’ve got.\n\nCrap\n\nMaurice Harkless: Harkless was supposed to break out this season; he has now faded into obscurity and is shooting less and worse.\n\nLance Stephenson has been such a disappointment this season. After a fantastic triple double packed season, he has struggled to fit into the Bobcats half court offense. The bigs clog up the lane and he’s just running into his own players with his Brooklyn crossovers. The Bobcats would do anything to get his 36 million off the books and it’s only year one.\n\nKobe Bryant: Before I get a bashing, just look at Kobe’s plus minus, 2nd worst in the league. He takes lots of shots and his team is worse with him than without him. I attribute this to his polarizing stature rather than his play. What player wouldn’t like to play with Kobe? He’ll bounce back next year; something tells me he’s not done. Start spreading the news…\n\nChanning Frye: I have nothing against stretch 4s, but the anomaly that Frye pulled last week has only happened once before in NBA history. Check this anomaly from this article, Frye basically tried his best to do nothing; he was a statistical ghost for one game.\n\nhttp:// http://uproxx.com/dimemag/2015/01/channing-fryes-unique-o-night-milwaukee/\n\nEvan Turner: Who has the patience for Evan Turner? He passes the eye test and fails all the others. He can cross up, pass, jump, rebound and occasionally hit a clutch bucket, it all means nothing if he makes terrible decision with horrible precision.\n\nAustin Rivers: Even though pops got his back and Rivers has improved, he’s still inefficient and is a guard lost in translation. The former Duke Blue Devil was supposed to be a future point guard filled with promise. He is currently an undersized 2 guard that takes bad shots and can’t find his teammates in traffic.\n\nOther notables: Nick Young, Chris Kamen.\n\nOn the rise and underrated\n\nDarrel Arthur: has always been an underrated player, looking superficially at his stats doesn’t show much, but Arthur is an above average shooter with a strong frame that can play the 4 and the 5, he has long arms and can also run the floor. Good player.\n\nJohn Henson: When John Henson gets time, he affects the game on both ends, jump hook, efficient finishing and his shot has taken a step forward. The new age plastic man is a shot deterrent that coaches are now evading in their game plans.\n\nIsiah Canaan: A balls deep fantasy radar has been on Canaan for a while, he’s suffered multiple injuries but has shown grit and balls in the little time he’s on the floor, Cannaan’’s +/- is still +5.5 and that is impressive for a player even though he plays for the winning rockets.\n\nKhris Middlton: Even though his name sounds like a 14 year old girl listening to Taylor Swift, Middleton has found his niche under Jason Kidd, taking big shots and quietly contributing across the board.\n\nMarcus Smart: I know what you’re thinking, all these rookies have been disappointing and Smart’s stats don’t stand out, but Smart’s teams on the floor have been winning. His turnovers are high, but his work rate is also high and he has a bounce back mentality that will make this kid a long time pro.\n\nDonatas Montiejunas: This lefty Lithuanian has been superb, filling in night after night for Dwight Howard’s weekly paper scratch injury. Donatas is the top James Harden ball boy the Rockets have.\n\nKyle Korver: The crafty professional with a deadly eye. His accuracy in all facets of the game should have made him an all-star. Wait he is now an All-star.\n\nTony Allen: There were idiots that complained about his 5 million/year deal. There isn’t one team in the league that wouldn’t love to have Tony Allen on their team, name one!\n\nOther Notable difference makers: Rudy Gobert, James Johnson.\n\nThe plus minus stat is deceiving, the whole Warriors team is at the top of the league, while most Knicks and Sixers players are found in the gutter, but there are standouts at both ends. These standouts tell a story, a story that can make or break a team. Stats and team attributes are viewed by a smaller sample size of minutes, making GM’s jobs more challenging. The single most important aspect of managing an NBA team the right way is finding contracts with value, contracts that are movable, while ascending in value. Finding these cheap players is a full time job, just look at the Hawks and look at the Nets. Half the budget for twice the fun, smells like a garage sale! At the end of the day, players live and die in their environment, there is always a diamond in the ruff and there is always a bad apple spoiling the batch.\n\nMuch love and basketball,\n\nRambeeni\n\n*Stats were updated as of February 7th.\n\nStoglinsanity 74/7 (Interview)\n\nTerrell Stoglin has busted through the stat gates of the Lebanese league in unprecedented fashion. The former Maryland Terrapin has taken the Middle East by storm, breaking scoring records left, right and center, leaving defenders bamboozled and fans buzzing. In a span of 10 days, the legendary Saggesse basketball club has given us two separate double overtime games for the ages. The first coming against Riadi in the Dubai tournament final, where Stoglin mesmerized Arab fans in Dubai to the smooth tune of 64 points against arch-rival Riadi. Unfortunatly for Stoglin, the breathtaking game ended in a Saggesse loss .\n\nA few days later Terell had 74 reasons to impress against Champville. With Sagesse anchor and big man sidelined, Terell dropped 74 points against Champville, also resulting in a double overtime thriller, again resulting in a loss. Terell bombed 14 made threes in that game and scored at will, taking step backs against double teams and making them. Stoglin is a young prospect with sky-high confidence, coupled with a quick and sneaky knack for scoring that has the marks of a brash young Hoya we once knew. I had a sit down with the king of the green castle, here’s the man of the hour.\n\nRambeeni: Welcome to Lebanon Terrell, what does it feel like to score 74 points in your sleep?\n\nTS: First off, I want to thank god. It feels great to score 74 points, it’s a personal record for me, but it feels bad to lose that game.\n\nRambeeni: Are you a point guard or a shooting guard?\n\nTS: I’m a point guard, but I can also be a combo guard. When I was in the US, people always wanted me to be a point guard, but overseas, I can play the 2, I can pass and shoot so I’m comfortable in both roles.\n\nRambeeni: What are your views on the Lebanese league?\n\nTS: The Lebanese league is good, I like how physical it is, but I wish Americans would get more calls to play here.\n\nRambeeni: What kind of shooting drills do you go through?\n\nTS: I don’t do any specific shooting drills, it’s mostly muscle memory, I take the same shots I take in the game. Most of my shooting happens in the offseason though, where I usually go through 500 makes a day.\n\nRambeeni: You are a master at splitting a double team; can you give our young players some tips on how you do it?\n\nTS: Well you have to be able to recognize the double team early and try to break it early. For me, when I see a double coming, I attack the big man right away, because I know he’s slower than the others and couldn’t contain me.\n\nRambeeni: With Hassan Whiteside now shining in the NBA, do you believe that Lebanon can be a stepping stone for you to get to the big leagues?\n\nTS: I think anywhere is a stepping stone to the NBA, Hassan is 7-footer and it’s easier for a 7-footer to get a shot to make an NBA roster. At the same time this is a solid league and it is respected, so the NBA is within reach.\n\nRambeeni: Who is your basketball role model?\n\nTS: Allen Iverson (seems fitting).\n\nRambeeni: Would you consider being naturalized to play for the Lebanese national team?\n\nTS: No I wouldn’t, I am American and would only play for team USA.\n\nRambeeni: What do you say to critics that think you’re selfish?\n\nTS: I say look at the game man. A selfish player doesn’t average 4 assists a game. I feel I open up the game for my teammates and my teammates will be open and I am confident my teammates will knock those shots down. I don’t play for people that speak negatively about me, I work for the positive fans and stay positive, I play for God.\n\nTerell is a player that petrifies any team facing Saggesse this season. At 23 he’s still young and has all the tools to make his journey towards his NBA dream. He’s undersized, but what he lacks in height, he makes up for with skill and heart. Stoglinsanity continues and it’s a 74/7 affair.\n\nMuch Love and Basketball,\n\nRambeeni\n\nNBA Survivor\n\nNBA injuries have retcheted up at an unprecedented pace. The frequency, the manner, and the timing of these injuries is suspect. With conditioning and medical advances boasting break through after breakthrough and hoards of staff with the technology of a Sci-fi movie at their disposal, the frequency and types of injuries we are witnessing in today’s NBA makes us ask some tough questions. Why is this happening? Has the game speed picked up to light speeds further than an ACL or Achilles can handle? Are player’s livelihoods under too much pressure to perform? Practice?! We talkin about practice?! All these questions come to mind.\n\nMy theory or assumption has manifested in the last few weeks and here it is: Guards are doing too much with too little. When Tim Hardaway blew past defenders with a killer crossover, it was simply a between the leg dribble followed by a crossover dribble to the hoop. Timmy’s move was beautiful, quick, compact, simple and effective. While Timmy senior had a long and mostly healthy career, we see today’s flashy point guards’ going through daily ice bucket challenges or comparing ACL tears and sprained ankles more than trophies.\n\nLet’s look at the list of current injured NBA players:\n\nOut for the season: Brandon Jennings, Jabari Parker, Kemba Walker, Steve Nash (old), Kobe, Tony Wroten, Paul George, Joel Embid.\n\nOut indefinitely: Ricky Rubio, Deron Williams, Jrue Holiday, Robin Lopez, Shabazz Muhammad, Alec Burks, Anderson Varejeo, Rodney Hood, Josh Mcroberts, Kendall Marshall, Shelvin Mack, Nicolas Batum.\n\nStruggling to stay on the court: Dwayne Wade, Derrick Rose, Lamarcus Aldridge and many others.\n\nThe above list comprises of 8 former all stars and 21 1st round picks that are expected to contribute. Not to mention the plethora of second tier players that are role players just trying to make it to practice. What is clear from this list is that it’s guard dominant; the cliché of the changing of the guard may signal a change to the hospital bed to go along with the 7 crossovers a possession. So based on the assumption that most of the injuries are guard related, let’s look back at the recent past leading guard’s regular season playing history for the sake of comparison.\n\nJohn Stockton: 1984-2003, 1504 games in 19 seasons.79 games/year on average, wow!\n\nJason Kidd: 1994-2013, 1391 games in 19 seasons, 73 games/year on average.\n\nAllen Iverson: 1996-2011, 914 games in 15 seasons, 61 games/year on average.\n\nTracy McGrady: 1997-2013, 938 games in 16 seasons, 59 games/ year on average.\n\nPenny Hardaway: 1993-2007, 704 games in 14 seasons, 50 games on average. This is sad, but Penny crashed before the halfway line of his career.\n\nGary Payton: 1990-2007, 1335 games in 17 seasons, 78.5 games on average, impressive.\n\nVersus\n\nRussell Westbrook: 2008-present, 440 games in 6.5 seasons, 68 games on average.\n\nKobe Bryant: 1996-present, 1280 games in 19.5 seasons, 65 games on average.\n\nDeron Williams: 2005-present, 648 games in 9.5 seasons 65 games on average.\n\nDwayne Wade: 2003-present, 719 games in11.5 seasons 62 games on average\n\nDerrick Rose: 2008-present, 289 games in 6.5 seasons, 44 games on average, wowzers!\n\nStephen Curry: 2009- present, 336 in 5.5 seasons, 61 games on average.\n\nOld school versus new school: The old school average 67 games on average/ regular season vs. the new school average 61 games on average/regular season and already have completed lengthy careers. That’s 60 extra games in a 10 year career and 120 extra games in a 20 year career. These numbers do not take playoffs into account and are a random sample size. Yet it is obvious that the old school players mentioned were all long time playoff warriors. The sample size is small, but both sets have dominated an era and make this semi-relevant.\n\nThe theory that I have yet to prove is that ankle breaker point guards are breaking their own ankles. Time will tell. Less is more, a player should think about quality over quantity. Kidd and Stockton were not that flashy and changed direction in stride, Damien Lillard, Steph Curry, D Wade, D Rose all do too much on offense for their own good. So next time you’re on the basketball court and want to cross up and get some oohs and ahs, think about how many of those crossovers you really need to get through your defender and think about the mileage you’re putting on your body by planting and changing direction. Trainers are better, strength and conditioning is more detailed and the players we love to watch are brittle. It’s how we play the game today; it’s not the food or the amount of games or any performance enhancing drugs.\n\nLet’s take the phoenix suns staff of 8 for example, widely known as one of the best medical staffs in the nba, taken from this article: http://valleyofthesuns.com/2012/04/05/secret-behind-phoenix-suns-elite-training-staff/\n\nHead athletic trainer Aaron Nelson, of the Suns’ weighs in. “To Shaq, it’s unorthodox, to us it’s regular science,” Nelson said. “It’s regular kinesiology, physiology, functional anatomy.” In a nutshell, the Suns aim to ensure that a weakness in one area does not compromise other parts of the body. For example, if a player injures his right ankle he will start compensating by putting more stress on his healthy side, so the training staff treats the entire athlete and not just the injured part to ensure “there is no movement dysfunction,” as Nelson put it. More specifically, the Suns chart an abundance of information on each player. This process starts with an overall assessment in the preseason that’s used as a baseline, and then rotation players are continually reassessed at least four times a week, if not daily. These assessments can include the following:\n\n– Utilizing a goniometer to evaluate players’ flexibility in eight different areas, including the big toe, the foot and ankle, the knee, the hips, internal and external rotations, and shoulder flexibility.\n\n– Manual muscle testing to evaluate the strength of particular muscles. The trainers will also look for differences in the measurements of the legs, ankles and hips to see if they’ve deviated from game to game.\n\n– Visual and movement assessments involving leg squats. The training staff will have players squat down a few times and watch for deviations.\n\n“Do the feet turn out, do the feet cave in, do the knees come in, do they come out, does the low back arch, does it round, all that kind of stuff, do they fall forward in their motion?” Nelson said.\n\nSo I highly doubt it’s the science used. It’s the way they play, it’s the expectations and the rewards that push these extremes. Competition is fiercer, more people are watching, social Media destroys and bestows, it’s all part of the game now, the game that only lets the fittest and smartest survive. You want more proof? Check Andre Miller.\n\nWhat factors do YOU think have caused this plague of injuries? I’m talking to you!\n\nMuch Love and Basketball,\n\nRambeeni\n\nRambeeni Mock Draft (1-15)\n\nLet’s attempt a mock draft, while looking at team needs and prospect fit. This is the best draft since Lebron, Darko, Melo, Dwayne, and Chris Bosh shook hands with the comish. Imagine that starting lineup! With Darko as the go-to guy, bam! This is the deepest draft since, not because there will be 4 superstars coming out, but because this year’s class is so deep, I can almost guarantee there will be a future All-star selected in the 2nd round. Let the GM games begin!\n\n1. Cleveland Cavs: Joel Embiid, in typical lucky bastard fashion, the Cavs will fuck this up. I have a feeling they chose Embiid with his stress fracture, all while jinxing him from the moment he puts on a Cavs uniform. Embid is a great talent that came out of nowhere. He’s a long, a legit 7-foot center with great athletic ability. He can run up and down the floor like a Gazelle, he has a post up game and adds a deadly baseline shot. Most importantly he has a good stroke from the line that has drawn comparisons to legend Hakeem Olajowan. This is where people get carried away. Part of that assessment comes from his stone-cold demeanour, which resembles the dream, but come on folks, he’s not spinning like Hakeem, he’s not wheeling and dealing or soaring like Hakeem. I think he could be a less durable Kevin Willis, which is still notable, but not life changing.\n\n2. Milwakee Bucks: Andrew Wiggins, once again the Bucks will mess this up and choose Wiggins. He has potential and can shoot, he has the athletic ability to be a star. I’ve watched three Wiggans’ games and none of them were impressive. I get it, the smooth jumper, the athletic finish, but he’s not Paul George and he’s not taking the world by storm. A decent NBA comparison is Eddie Jones, Jones was a great 3rd option and an All-star, that’s where I see Wiggins.\n\n3. Philideliphia Sixers: Jabari Parker is the top player in this draft. He’s NBA ready and has the tools to be a perennial All-star and winner. I love what Philly has done with their roster, especially their Jrue Holiday trade that is a quintessential sell high fantasy trade. With MCW and Nerlens Noels beefing up with more Philly cheese Stakes and Jabari Parker taking over this team, I think Philly will be a 7 seed in 2016. The city of brotherly love hope to get a Melo-esque player that can pass out of a double team and can rebound and defend better than Melo. He’s not the unstoppable scorer that Carmelo is, but he has more attributes than Melo and is an incredible athlete with size and dexterity. Jabari Parker will be the face of any franchise that drafts him.\n\n4. Orlando Magic: Dante Exum, the 6-6 point guard out of the land down unda! Just like everyone else, I’ve been looking at highlights and drills, the talent and potential is clearly there, but it’s all so grey. How will he handle Patrick Beverly bullying him? How will he average less than 7 turnovers without facing NCAA defenses? I think this guy’s upper limit is a Shaun Livingston with shooting range, which is saying volumes about his potential. Orlando has been searching for a replacement for Jameer Nelson and it looks like they found him in Exum. The Penny Hardaway comparisons are ridiculous!\n\n5. Utah Jazz: Noah Vonleh is a typical Jazz draftee. He has the biggest hands in this draft and has loads of potential, but needs time to develop. He looks to gain some familiarity and will eventually bolt when he’s ripe for a breakout, in typical Utah jazz fashion.\n\n6. Boston Celtics: Julius Randle, the Celtics may have Randle fall in their laps and they won’t think twice. Randle is still unpolished and has a lot of mental work to do, but he already possesses an NBA body. He could be solid or fade into obscurity, I’m leaning towards somewhere in the middle, maybe one or 2 All-star appearances and a solid post presence down low for 9 years. A poor man’s Zach Randolph, he should produce right away, which may place Sullenger on the trading block. A future front court rotation of Olynik, Sullenger and Randle would cause some bruises. Maybe a guard like Smart could help? Celtics need everything and anything.\n\n7. Los Angeles Lakers: Aaron Gordon, the Lakers are already hoping and praying these idiot analysts keep bashing Gordon. The Lakers are dreaming of having a player of his caliber chosen at 7, and this is the true magnificence of this draft. I adore this guy’s game and I love his potential, attitude and skill set. He’s a special player that can play the 3 or the 4. If it was up to me, I would draft him 3rd or 4th. He has great handles and can jump out of the gym. His jumper needs work, but it could end up being deadly in a couple of years. I see Aaron Gordon as a 7 time NBA all-star that will add to his game year after year.\n\n8. Sacramento Kings: Marcus Smart, will they blow this again? Kings have so much talent but so little cohesiveness it all seems like some sort of adventure #sacramentoadventures. They must take Smart, despite the fact they have Mclemore. Smart is NBA ready and has veteran savvy before even entering the league. He has potential to be an unyielding player but his ceiling is near. His vertical is lacking but the power and wits are there. He’s an undersized shooting guard that can play the 1. I’d compare him to a deprived shooting guard version of Baron Davis, with less hops. If you guys remember BD, this is a compliment and not an insult.\n\n9. Charlotte Hornets: Dario Saric, this is going to be a tough pick for Charlotte with so much talent still available, but Saric looks to be a super version of a Josh Mcroberts. A point forward that can shoot and pass and create. He may be too tempting to pass up and MJ’s previous draft picks of high level college scorers like Adam Morison (barf!) will shy them away from the likes of Doug Mcdermot.\n\n10. Philedlphia Sixers: Doug Mcdermot, this historic scorer will fit right in with Philly’s athletic core. He can shoot and can play the 3 or the 4. Imagine a small ball lineup of MCW, Parker, Noel, Mcdermott and Thad Young. I don’t know how that would work, but it’s uber versatile.\n\n11. Denver Nuggets: Adrian Payne makes sense for the Nuggets. He can play forward and center and can step out and shoot it. He plays big and could fit into a starting role in a year or two. Even though a guard is most needed, Denver may take a risk on this Spartan.\n\n12. Orlando Magic: James Young shot himself into the forefront of the draft when the lights were brightest in the NCAA tournament. This athletic silky smooth shooter has good height at 6-7 and great athletic ability. His finals facial dunk is considered one of the greatest of all time. He will be ready once Aaron affalo nears the end of his contract so expect him to start for the Magic in the next couple of years. He is a below average defender, so until that’s improved, he’ll have bench splinters.\n\n13. Minnesota Timberwolves: Rodney Hood is a 6’8 shooter that has a great NBA body and plays with passion every second on the floor. The Blue Devil is still a work in progress and could end up being a more efficient Wilson Chandler. This could be a long term pick for the Wolves that are looking for anything to get over Kevin Love’s recent infidelity.\n\n14. Phoenix Suns: Nick Stauskas, some analysts have Stauskas lower, but this would be a smart pick for the Suns. Senior college shooters with high IQ are usually looked over, but Stauskas isn’t only a knock down shooter. This past year he added accurate play making skills and was an average defender. He can give the Suns’ core the outside threat they love. At 6’6, he’s the best prospect at moving without the ball. Even though a center is needed, Stauskas fits the bill. Nick isn’t a sexy pick but he’ll have a long NBA career and is a great addition to the Suns’ already scary bench mob.\n\n15. Atlanta Hawks: Tyler Ennis, the Hawks must draft the best player here, passing up on Ennis would be dim-witted. Regardless of Jeff Teague and the blond German, Ferry will draft Ennis if available. Easily the top point guard in this draft, Ennis has heart, vision and leadership and is only 19. Expect Ennis to be traded on draft night.\n\nExpect more draft analysis coming soon with the same format throughout. Which picks do you disagree with? Who did we miss in the top 15?

A racist was spotted and burned, always a good thing, yet even the Sterling distraction couldn’t take us away from the action. Every series was thrilling, every team was fighting, and it got me thinking about the change of format. Maybe we should just keep this system, Atlanta proved this much. My predictions were mostly on point, but the length of each series was surprising. Portland proved that Damian Lillard is in fact “Machete”, as mentioned a couple of months ago. Dallas were admirable, Toronto fought for every inch, Chicago got to the playoffs with basically no talent, Indiana celebrated like middle school cheerleaders and dodged a hawk and Miami look like champions again.\n\nNow that the second round is set, here’s a preview:\n\nSpurs vs. Blazers: Spurs looked old in some instances against Dallas, but Manu looks as smooth as his bald spot. Rick Carlisle challenged San Antonio’s weaknesses and the Spurs reacted in legendary fashion. Portland’s rotation may not have the depth the Spurs have, but I won’t sleep on them again. The solid starting line-up for the Blazers will be a terror once again, but the Spurs will give them a valuable lesson if all goes according to plan. Spurs in 6\n\nThunder vs. Clippers: Every basketball fan is looking closely at this match-up. There are many story lines at play; the leadership of Durant has been questioned, while Chris Paul leads by wit and example. The Blake -Ibaka match-up, the long awaited Dudley vs. Lamb match-up, Ok I’ve gone too far. It should be another classic. Thunder in 7\n\nPacers vs. Wizards: The Pacers’ struggles may bode well for them going forward. The Hawks have given them a warranted wake-up call . Washington has a horde of talent, and all the unfounded hate dished out by Bill Simmons seems unfounded. Sure they missed on many draft picks, but as Sir Charles said, Beal and Wall will be the top back court for years to come. Indiana will improve, Washington will fight, but the Wizards’ idiot coach will mess this up. Pacers in 6\n\nMiami vs. Brooklyn: We saved the best for last, I know I’ll get hate mail for this, but I’m sticking to my guns, Brooklyn can take this series, here’s why: Miami’s secret weapon, apart from Wade and Lebron has been their outside shooting that spaces the floor for LBJ to operate. Brooklyn can rotate to guard those shooters and this year Miami’s shooters haven’t been good as last year. Perhaps a heroic effort by Lebron and Wade is coming up, they’re more than capable, but are the Heat at their best when it’s only the Wade and Lebron show? Mike Miller is an underrated subtraction, Miller could shoot, handle and guard anywhere from a 2 to a smaller 4-man. Regular season numbers don’t mean much, but the odd part is Brooklyn was never at full strength when they beat the Heat 4 times this year. Kidd is implementing his evil plan and the veterans are peaking at the right time. This is my long shot and my major threat to a semi-perfect bracket, here goes nothing. Brooklyn in 6\n\nDo you think I’m loco? What are your 2nd round predictions?\n\nMuch love and basketball,\n\nRambeeni\n\nNBA Playoffs Briefing- Part 1\n\nLate nights, less sleep, stupid arguments, important arguments, playing for a place in history, the Playoffs are here and now! The men from the boys, the teams from the memes, the stage is set. My apologies for the delay, but as a friend of mine says, I was busy living. Let’s get right into it with the beasts in the east (no pun intended).\n\nMiami vs. Charlotte: The Bobcats were supposed to be my sleeper pick in the East. The match-up with Miami eliminates any chance for the Cats to move to the second round. Heat’s season just started, expect a different team. As Rudy T once said: ” Don’t ever underestimate the heart of a champion”.\n\nHeat should finish it up in 5.\n\nIndiana vs. Atlanta: Atlanta have destroyed Indiana in the regular season, it looks like it may translate to the postseason. Atlanta has shooting big-men in Milsap, Antic, and Scott. The stretch bigs force Indiana’s slower forwards into running suicides on defense. We’ve discovered the water boy from San Antonio can coach a team and win 50 games, the Spurs effect. This is not good news for Indy, Indiana needs to take care of business if they want to make a finals run.\n\nIndiana in 5 games.\n\nBrooklyn vs. Toronto: Arguably the most intriguing of the eastern conference match-ups. Canadians gone wild versus the veteran dinosaurs. This looks to go 7 games, but I still think Nets will come off on top. Too many veterans and talent beat-boxing in Brooklyn.\n\nNets move on in 6 or 7.\n\nChicago vs. Washington: This looks to be a grueling series. Washington’s talent and youth versus Chicago’s veteran defensive claws. Wall is too long for the Chicago point guards, as tough as Chicago are, I think they will lose in 7, simply because the Bulls’ offense could stagnate more than their stingy defense.\n\nWizards in 7.\n\nOut West! Boy ‘o boy this is complicated.\n\nSan Antonio vs. Dallas: This doesn’t look good for the Mavs, The Mavs look at the Spurs with older brother syndrome, that’s unlikely to change. The only possible shot the Mavs have is if Dirk plays like MVP Dirk.\n\nSpurs in 5.\n\nOklahoma City vs. Memphis: Memphis is one of the worst first round match-ups you can get, but the Thunder are ready. OKC are primed for a finals run. Often a tough test to start the postseason, is the best recipe to get a ring.\n\nOKC in 6.\n\nGolden State vs. LA: This is guaranteed to get dirty. Despite Mark Jackson’s sub par tactics, he’s a good motivator. He could motivate Steph Curry into confirming his alien status. Clearly my favorite match-up this year, the clippers must pull this one out or something has to change. Chris Paul will lead, but will others follow? Clippers have weaknesses on the interior once you get past D Jordan and Griffin. Clippers’ core is at stake and something tells me these guys enjoy playing together, so expect their maximum effort. Hand down, man down.\n\nClippers in 7.\n\nPortland vs. Houston: Expect high scoring and slightly better defense than Steve Nash in his 40’s. This series has so many unknowns, both teams are relatively new. Houston has the talent but have been up and down all season. Portland dropped significantly at the end of the year and are heavily under-achieving on defense. Portland’s horrible season defensive numbers don’t add up, considering the defensive specialists they have. A close and exciting series coming right up.\n\nHouston in 7.\n\nWe’re all hoping for a change in the playoff format, hopefully that will happen in the next few years. Where do you differ with our predictions? Which series are you watching closely? Enjoy the first round, see you in the 2nd!\n\nMuch love and basketball,\n\nRambeeni\n\nNBA Dynasties: Past and Present\n\nWith the playoffs around the corner, it’s time to look at the history of dynasties and point out two teams that have sky-scraping stakes this season. Books have been written about NBA dynasties; let’s try to keep it simple.\n\nNBA Dynasty:\n\nAn NBA team that has won multiple championships in close succession while dominating a span of at least 3-5 years.\n\nA team that still shows up on NBA TV at least once a month.\n\nA team that has three or more of its core players on different championship teams.\n\nClear-cut Dynasties:\n\nMikan’s Minneapolis Lakers: The first dynasty. Mikan was simply taller than everyone and could see the future with his glasses.\n\nRussel’s Celtics: 11 rings? Russell is the equivalent of Gholam, obsessed with this ring business, and stands 6’11 instead of 2’11.\n\nMagic’s Lakers: The Lakers dominated from the moment Magic stepped on the floor, from 1980-1991. They earned 5 championships and an unbelievable 8 finals appearances. Magic was in the finals almost every year of his career.\n\nMJ’s Bulls: 6 championships could have easily been 7 or 8, and they’re the only team to ever three-peat, twice! The best regular season record of all-time, coupled with 6 rings, makes the Bulls arguably the greatest team of all-time.\n\nShaq and Kobe’s Lakers: Absolute dominance. Shaq was the most dominant player ever seen. In his prime, no one could stop Shaq, not Hakeem, not Ewing, not MJ, not Wilt, not Russell, not Lebron, no one, never forget that. The burbling beast, hungry for a ring, paired with a young Kobe, instilled fear in the opposition. It’s a shame egos got in the way, despite the Zen keeping the peace. Kobe wasn’t in his prime, which is the real sad part about the split. The epic game 7 against Portland is one of the greatest “Give me that!” moments ever seen. I thought this was going to be a tough call, but it isn’t. They’re the only team to 3-peat apart from MJ’s bulls. Dynasty Status: Granted. Kobe did continue to win another 2 rings, but apart from Phil and D fish, it was a different team.\n\nHonorable Mentions:\n\nDr J’s Sixers: The Sixers had an up and down decade when they acquired the silky smooth Julius Erving in the late 70’s. They were consistently relevant, reaching the finals 4 times from 1977-1984 and failing to win all but one of them. Despite a star-studded roster, it was a difficult era with Magic and Larry coming in and taking the league by storm. Dynasty Status: Not even close.\n\nLarry’s Celtics: The smell of sweat in the old Boston garden was enough to make you cough up the ball or a lung. They had the best home record in NBA history, with the white version of basketball Jesus as their leader. A well-balanced team, with grit and unprecedented IQ, Bird’s Celtics went to the finals 5 times in the 80’s, only winning 3 championships. As historic as that team was, they fall short, merely because they only won 3 without repeating once. Dynasty status: Close, but they were unlucky in that the competition in the 80s was fierce enough to deny them dynasty status.\n\nModern day Goliath:\n\nTim Duncan’s Spurs: Ever since Greg Popovich lucked out in the 1997 draft with the 1st overall pick, the spurs haven’t looked back. The NBA is a league of blessings in disguise; David Robinson’s season ending injury was the reason Timmy joined the Spurs. The Spurs military apparatus, with the talent of Timmy, the admiral, Sean Elliot and mastery of Pop, bred a project of excellence and consistency. Years later, the Spurs are still a model of patience and continuity. The permanence in bridging the Robinson era with the Duncan era was seamless; the addition of TP and Manu Ginobili gave them a stellar force to continue that success with unrivalled longevity. They’ve won 4 NBA Championships since 1998; all winning seasons. They have only been ousted in the first round three times and have been to the finals 5 times, winning 4 out of the five. Not to mention, the measure of regular season excellence, as they peaked this year. Pop is a player, with Tim Duncan as the centrepiece, bridge D-rob with TP and Manu and we got ourselves a long-term dynasty that may always be underrated. Dynasty Status: Yes, granted, they are a dynasty. Another finals appearance or win would put them firmly as one of the supreme franchises in history. The final chapter will be decided next week. The curtain waits.\n\nMiami Heat: Three straight finals appearances with 2 championships in the bank. Pat Riley’s Padowan genius Eric Spolstera has been instrumental, making sure egos and games mesh. The humility of Wade to take a back seat and ice his knees has been solicitous. It helps to have a mammoth freak of nature that can shoot, drive, pass, intimidate and bully everyone; Lebron is a physical and cerebral specimen never seen before. Bosh is a half decent compliment. Dynasty status: To be constructed, a minimum of 2 more rings required based on the talent involved.\n\nWhen there are many pundits whaling at the gap between the top teams and the second tier teams nowadays, we can see that Miami and San Antonio are playing for their place in history. In the bigger scheme of things, this year is pivotal. For Miami, a third straight title would cement their dynasty status, instantly. For the Spurs, it will further embolden their case for long-term consistency and supremacy. The beauty of this season is it’s up for grabs. Out west, anyone from the Spurs, Thunder, Clips, and Rockets could win it. In the East, apart from Miami, Indiana and Brooklyn look to roll in the hay by next week. It’s also the first time in the history of the NBA that the Knicks, Lakers and Celtics miss the playoffs (collective bargaining?). How will this year play out? Who are your East and West finalists?\n\nShaBlam! I just realized the Lakers are the top franchise in history; the Lakers had 3 different dynasties, with Boston a close 2nd and Chicago right behind them. Any dynasties missed?\n\nStay tuned for our playoff preview this Friday.\n\nMuch love and basketball,\n\nRambeeni\n\nJ Kidd Play-Making in Brooklyn\n\nThe second greatest point guard in history made the controversial move from player to coach this summer. The skeptics were out; “You can’t just coach!”. There is truth to that, but Kidd has always been a quick learner and has been coaching his whole life, not to mention a basketball genius. After the Brooklyn Nets started the season as a laughingstock, Kidd shunned his assistant Frank (Kidd’s ex-coach), adjusted his injury plagued team (Blopez, KG & AK), changed the offense, and now plays with a smaller line-up that defends well and doesn’t waste time. Fresh off a franchise record 14 home game winning streak, how is J Kidd doing it?\n\nBefore the season started, I went out on a limb saying there’s no way the Brooklyn offense could play Pierce and Joe Johnson at the 2 and 3 position respectively. Kidd concurred, by realizing both cause stagnation offensively, while being too slow defensively. What I didn’t expect, is Kidd moving Pierce to the power forward spot. The move that has made the Nets’ offense as unique as any and a mismatch nightmare for bigger teams. Despite the smaller line-up, the Nets have been defending and rebounding well, helping and recovering smoothly and imposing their up tempo play with four shooters on the floor. Another bad-ass dynamic is the amazing story of Shaun Livingston. Livingston is known for the horrific knee injury he suffered more than 5 years ago,\n\nbut is also remembered for having the potential to be a star before that injury. At 6’7, Livingston is a rare athletic passing point guard that can guard 1-3 positions,as well as some small ball 4s. That versatility, has given Kidd the option of switching off screens in many defensive sets.\n\nThese changes are another chapter for fans and coaches to learn from the genius that is Jason Kidd. The last shot Kidd gave his team is the most powerful one. He finally moved Deron Williams to the off guard position, his natural position in Illinois, where he hoisted the NCAA trophy. Playing D-Will at the 2 has given Kidd a go-to option in his prime, and has relieved Deron of the burden of making everyone happy. Livingston can do that and has shown glimpses of why he was deemed the next Penny Hardaway so many years ago. The nets have a plethora of shooters and at least 4 high level shot creators. Mind you, all of this has been done without their all-star center (Brook Lopez) and KG (legend).\n\nKidd coaches like he plays, heart, vision, the extra pass and execution. There is no excuse for mismatches; Kidd defended players faster or bigger than him. Most of that defensive prowess hinges on not gambling, as well as the intuition by studying the habits of offensive players. When the Mavs won the title 2 years ago, Kidd was often switching on to D Wade in his prime and Lebron successfully, Kidd was 38. Read that again. When you have a disciplined defense that doesn’t bite and switches well, without mismatching, Bam! You’re winning games. Throw in a free-flowing offense that runs a 3-man game similar to an extended triangle to perfection, you have a formula that many teams in the East are dreading. I took the liberty of drawing up my favorite Nets offensive set, as I couldn’t find the video, apologies for the chicken scribble.\n\nBrooklyn can beat anyone in the east on any given night and have been the 2nd best team in the league this calendar year. Some teams have to hit rock bottom to bounce back. Kidd was too good of a player, leader, student, he manages personalities and has the right demeanor to be a great NBA coach.\n\nThe best decision Prokhorov and King have ever made was hire Jason Kidd, the best player to ever wear a Nets uniform; there I said it (Dr. J included). Feel free to point out other aspects of the Nets’ successful game plan I may have missed.\n\nMuch love and Basketball,\n\nRambeeni\n\nDedicated to the moon"
