His selection mystified some critics, who argued that the Magic were overloading on point guards, already having Steve Francis and Jameer Nelson on their roster. Diener made his NBA debut on December 2, 2005, playing 12 minutes and scoring three points in a loss to the Memphis Grizzlies. On December 3, 2005, Travis made his “hometown” debut in Milwaukee, Wisconsin (about 60 miles from his actual home town of Fond du Lac), where he played more than 22 minutes and scored 14 points, including 4-4 shooting from three-point range, but the Orlando Magic lost the game to the Milwaukee Bucks by a final score of 104-84. In the 2006 Pepsi Pro Summer League, Diener averaged 20.3 points, 6.5 assists, and 1.0 turnover per game. Diener finished with a 34 point outburst on 7-10 three point shooting to lead the Magic over the Chicago Bulls, before missing the final game with a slight foot injury.\n\nAfter totaling just 75 minutes in five appearances in the Magic’s first 33 games, he saw action in 12 of the next 14 games and averaged 4.0 ppg in those outings…the remainder of the season, he scored a total of three points in six appearances…from 1/13 through 2/8, he scored six or more points four times and shot 16-39 FGS, 13-33 3-pt FGS and 3-4 FTS…returning to his home state of Wisconsin for the first time as a pro and playing on the court where he starred in college, he connected on 5-6 from the floor and 4-4 from 3-pt range on his way to a season-high 14 points at Milwaukee, 12/3…that was the first of his three games with 10+ points…he had 11 points on 4-7 FG and 3-6 3-pt FG in 15 minutes at Portland, 1/13…he went to the foul line six times on the season, including 3-4 on his way to 12 points at Charlotte, 1/20…his other two free throws came in a 15-minute appearance vs. the Bobcats, 1/7, in which he scored eight points…in 18 minutes vs. Sacramento, 1/21, he had just two points (1-5 FGS), but added a career-best six rebounds and a season-high four assists…his rebounds against the Kings all came at the defensive end and he had just four offensive rebounds all season…the game against the Kings was his only outing in which he had more than two assists.\n\n2006-2007\n\nIn 26 appearances for the Orlando Magic, he averaged 3.8 ppg for the second straight season and handed out 1.3 apg…he made appearances in each of the team’s first three games, but totaled just eight minutes…then he made one appearance in the next 18 games, missing one with a sprained right ankle and the rest due to coaching decisions…he played in a season-high seven straight games from 12/11 to 12/23 and scored at least five points six times in that stretch with three games of 10+ points…he logged at least 10 minutes in each of those seven games, including a career-high 30 minutes at New Orleans/Oklahoma City, 12/20…in that seven-game stretch, he played 20+ minutes four times and totaled just two turnovers with 14 assists in 149 minutes…scoring 10+ points in consecutive games for the first time in his career, he averaged 13.3 ppg and shot 13-20 (.650) from the floor in a three-game span that included outings at Charlotte, 12/13; vs. Cleveland, 12/14, and vs. New Orleans, 12/16…he also shot 8-15 from 3-pt range in those three games…he scored a career-best 16 points at Charlotte, 12/14…against the Bobcats, he shot 5-6 FGS, 3-4 3-pt FG and 3-3 FTS…he also had three rebounds and three assists in that game…against the Cavs, 12/14, he had a team-high four assists off the bench and that was the only time he topped the Magic in assists…he had six games with three or more assists, including a career-best five at Cleveland, 1/22…in his first 13 appearances of the season, he had 18 assists and just seven turnovers (2.57:1) and then had nearly three assists for every turnover (2.83:1) in his last 13 outings…after logging six minutes at Charlotte, 3/12, he was on the Magic’s inactive list for the remaining 17 games…he totaled four steals on the season, three of which came in a five-game span from 12/11 to 12/20.\n\nIndiana Pacers\n\n2007-2008\n\nOn July 19, 2007 Travis Diener signed a three-year, $4.86 million contract with the Indiana Pacers as a back up point guard to Jamaal Tinsley. Contract details: 2007-08, $1,500,000; 2008-09, $1,620,000; 2009-10, $1,740,000 (player option).\n\nHe made appearances in 22 of the first 38 games of the season, averaged just 1.3 apg and had an assists-to-turnover ratio of just 2.0:1…in his last 44 appearances, he averaged better than five assists a game (5.1) and posted a ratio of 5.44 assists to every turnover committed…for the season, his

5.26:1…after averaging just 2.9 ppg in his first 16 outings, and scoring 10+ points once, he averaged 8.6 ppg and scored 10+ points 21 times in his last 50 games…he had his best game as a pro with 22 points on 6-10 FGS and 10-10 FTS vs. Chicago, 2/27…in that game against the Bulls, he shot 6-6 from 2-pt range…that game against Chicago was the first of a career-high five straight games in double figures and he averaged 13.8 ppg in those five games…in that five-game streak, he shot 25-50 FGS, 6-18 3-pt FGS and 13-13 FTS…one of only three Indiana players to record double-digit assists in 2007-08, he had a career-high 10 twice: vs. Orlando, 2/2, and in the Pacers' win at Toronto, 2/29…he added 10 points against the Raptors, for the first double-double of his NBA career…he and Jamaal Tinsley were the only Indiana players to have 10 or more assists in more than one game in 2007-08…in that game vs. Orlando, 2/2, the former Magic player added a then career-high tying six rebounds…he topped that figure with eight rebounds vs. New Jersey, 2/22…including three of the season's final five games, he had five or more rebounds six times in 2007-08 and averaged 1.7 rpg…he had more than one offensive rebound just four times, including four against the Nets, 2/22, and two vs. Charlotte, 4/12, and at Washington, 4/14…he had just five steals in his first 29 appearances, but then claimed

career-best four steals in 32 minutes…he made 74 3-pt FGS in 2007-08 and after making just 14 in his first 23 games, he connected on 5-7 from behind the arc on his way to 19 points in the Pacers' win at Sacramento, 1/12…that was one of seven games in which he made at least three 3-pt FGS…in the Pacers' win vs. Milwaukee, 4/6, he shot 6-8 from 3-pt range to account for all of his 18 points…in that game, the Pacers entered the fourth quarter trailing by 10 points…however, he and Mike Dunleavy keyed a 29-7 run in the first 7:09 of the final period by hitting a combined six 3-pt FGS…Diener alone hit 5-6 3-pt FGS in the fourth quarter of that game…though he only had 70 free throw attempts on the season, he shot a team-best 90.1 percent which was also his career-best…beginning with the second of his two FTS against the Raptors, 2/25, he made 32 straight free throws…that streak ended with his final attempt of the season vs. Charlotte, 4/12…he sat out four games with injuries, missing two straight in early December (12/4-7) with a sore shoulder, one in mid-February (2/13) with a sore right foot, and the final game of the season (4/16) with a sore left foot.\n\n2008-2009\n\nThe only Pacers' player with more steals (26) than turnovers in 2008-09, he averaged one turnover every 34.2 minutes on the floor and his assists-to-turnover ratio of 5.81-to-1 would have been the best in the NBA, had he met the league minimums…he played in just eight of the Pacers' first 24 games and totaled 22 points in his first 10 appearances…he then scored 10+ points in consecutive games, hitting 7-12
