        "text": "Dwight Howard still believes Shaquille O'Neal can be a fit for an NBA team as the legendary center approaches the end of his career.\n\n\"He's still a big body. He's different than he was back in the day but he's still big. He can be a great fit for a team to help them win,\" Howard said of O'Neal\n\n\"I think his presence in the locker room will be needed more than anything at this point in his career. If he would embrace whatever team he's on, he has a lot of knowledge and he could help a team grow.\"\n\nHoward was also asked by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution whether he felt O'Neal was a good fit for the Hawks.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said. \"I like their lineup now. I know a lot of people get mad and say they're not big on the inside, but they're a big team. They've got big guards. They've got big forwards. They've got a flying forward [Josh Smith]. So it doesn't really matter about having a seven-footer.\"\n\nThe Magic could still opt to re-sign free-agent Jason Williams to be their third point guard.\n\nOrlando general manager Otis Smith said he'll decide \"by week's end\" what to do at the position.\n\n\"Jason Williams we would probably like to have back, but what that would look like I'm not necessarily sure,\" Smith said. \"We'll have to have a conversation with his agent in the next couple of days.\"\n\nSmith said he's also considering \"two younger guys\" for the spot.\n\nJosh Robbins of the Orlando Sentinel wrote on Wednesday that those \"younger\" guys could be Chris Quinn and Travis Diener.\n\nThe Magic might be on Chris Paul's wish list, but they don't sound very confident of landing him in the near future.\n\nOrlando isn't convinced that New Orleans will be forced into trading Paul and they aren't keen on taking on the contract of center Emeka Okafor.\n\n\"Much ado about nothing,\" is how Magic coach Stan Van Gundy Saturday described the reports of his team being linked to Paul.\n\n\"We are only involved in this story because someone said he wants to be traded and someone said he wants to come to Orlando,\" Van Gundy told FanHouse Sunday. \"It's a New Orleans and Chris Paul story.\"\n\nMagic general manager Otis Smith dismissed the reports as \"rumors.\"\n\nThe Hornets haven't yet entertained trade offers for Chris Paul, but the point guard is already considering a number of scenarios.\n\nAccording to league sources, the Magic have replaced the Knicks atop Paul's list of preferred destinations.\n\nThe Knicks are still high on his list, but Paul believes Dwight Howard and the Magic are currently a better fit.\n\nPaul will meet with Hornets president Hugh Weber, new general manager Dell Demps and new head coach Monty Williams to discuss the future direction of the club on Monday.\n\nAccording to a source with knowledge of his plan, Chris Paul has requested that the Hornets trade him to the Knicks, Magic or Lakers before the season begins.\n\n\"He wants out,\" the source told Ken Berger of CBS Sports. \"He wants to play with another superstar. He wants to follow LeBron's model of teaming up with other great players.\"\n\nNBA sources say that members of Paul's camp recently told them, \"He's not going to start the season in New Orleans.\"\n\nThe Hornets will try to persuade Paul to remain based on the team's new direction.\n\n\"Paul won't go public with his trade request -- if he did, he'd be subject to a fine under NBA rules -- but those with knowledge of his plans believe his desire to pair up with another superstar (or two) has gained too much momentum to stop,\" writes Berger.\n\nThe Knicks have been compiling chips they could use to trade for a superstar-level talent.\n\n\"According to sources familiar with the Knicks' strategy,\" writes Berger, \"part of the reason for orchestrating the sign-and-trade for David Lee -- which yielded young talents Anthony Randolph and Kelenna Azubuike from Golden State -- was to stock the roster with attractive assets that could be used to acquire such marquee players if the opportunities presented themselves.\"\n\nFive teams remain in the running to sign free-agent forward Matt Barnes, according to sources.\n\nThe Raptors are still one of those teams, despite the unlikelihood of a sign-and-trade with the Magic that Barnes thought would be completed by now.\n\nIn addition to the Raptors, Barnes is weighing interest from the Cavaliers, Heat, Celtics and Lakers.\n\nBarnes announced on his Twitter feed Monday night that he was headed to Toronto, but the deal feel through when it became apparent that the Magic had limited sign-and-trade options.\n\n\"It's something we've discussed and talked about,\" Magic general manager Otis Smith told the Orlando Sentinel on Tuesday when asked about the sign-and-trade talks with Toronto.\n\n\"At this point nothing has happened,\" Smith continued, \"and I don't really anticipate anything happening.\"\n\nMatt Barnes announced on Monday night that he is going to sign with the Raptors.\n\nHowever, ESPN.com's Marc Stein reports that Orlando's limited sign-and-trade options may scuttle the deal, according to sources.\n\nBarnes is expecting to sign a two-year, $10 million deal.\n\nThe Raptors and Magic will resume discussions on a sign-and-trade Tuesday. However, because of the financial standing of both clubs, it's possible that Barnes may have to agree to new terms.\n\nToronto recently spent the bulk of its $5.8 million mid-level exception to sign Linas Kleiza. They don't have the available funds to sign Barnes outright to a deal that starts in the neighborhood of $4 million.\n\nThe Magic are prevented by salary-cap rules from starting a sign-and-trade deal for Barnes at higher than $2 million, because Orlando doesn't have Barnes' full Bird rights after employing him for only one season.\n\nHaving retained J.J. Redick, the Magic are now looking for a third point guard behind Jameer Nelson and Chris Duhon.\n\nOrlando's roster consists of 12 players. The NBA-mandated minimum is 13 players.\n\n\"I think we're going to sit still for a week or so, let some things shake out, let the movement continue around the league,\" general manager Otis Smith said.\n\n\"There's a list of a few guys that we like, including J-Will if the opportunity presents itself for him to come here. But there's a list of other guards that we really like at that spot.\"\n\nMatt Barnes expected to announce on Friday where he'd sign as a free agent, but the forward's agent says the decision has been delayed.\n\nAaron Goodwin says additional teams have become involved since it became clear that the Magic will not re-sign Barnes.\n\n\"Couple new teams just jumped n2 the game, so I'm sorry 2 say ima have 2 get back 2 you. Ill let yall know something with in the nxt few days,\" Barnes tweeted on Friday afternoon."
