        "text": "The Los Angeles Lakers have already been without point guard Steve Blake for the past eight games, but on Wednesday they received news from team doctor Steven Yoon than an MRI revealed Blake would be out \"at least another two weeks\", according to the team.\n\nBlake originally suffered the injury on Nov. 12. It was a disappointing blow to the Lakers at the time, as they were already without point guard Steve Nash because of a left leg fracture.\n\nDuring Blake's absence the Lakers have gone 4-4 and are currently 7-8, which is good enough for third place in the Pacific Division behind the Clippers and the Golden State Warriors.\n\nBlake has appeared in seven games on the year, averaging 26.0 minutes and 5.1 points per game. He was also averaging 3.4 assists."
