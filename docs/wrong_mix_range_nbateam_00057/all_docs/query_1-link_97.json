        "text": "WHILE IT MAY seem glorious to be named as the head coach of an NBA team — it takes impressive credentials, powerful communication skills, and shrewd strategizing abilities to eve be consideredfor the job — the new reality of being a coach suggests otherwise.\n\nThink about the “life cycle” of an NBA coach: immediately after being hired, the pressure begins. On a rebuilding team, teams afford coaches more time to “develop” their players — though this effectively translates to being assured the head coaching spot for one season.\n\nBut on a contending roster, coaches are scrutinized daily, with the blame for losses and early playoff exits often being placed squarely on coaches. And this repeated action of coaches being let go after disappointments is by design: as many in the sports world have expressed, the players can’t be fired. but the coaches can.\n\nAnd in a single day, coaches have to get up early for media availability, move players within a rotation, manage the collective spirit of a team, and watch hours and hours of game tape to prepare — all while fielding demands from players, front office executives, media representatives, and agents.\n\nCoaching has become a cycle, a rotation in which coaches are replaced as fast as they are hired. And the inevitable pressure of performance that begins one day into the job takes its toll on coaches — who aren’t afforded the same 24-hour medical attention that players enjoy.\n\nThe pressure to win as many as games as possible doesn’t matchup to the unquantifiable pressure of star players influencing team decisions. In what job are the co-workers you suit up with be the very people to spell your dismissal?\n\nWhen coaches respond to the power of their players — usually by dictating the culture and environment of the team, akin to the top college programs — they are often met with hostility and bitterness from their players and front-office executives.\n\nThis is the reality of being a coach in today’s NBA, with instability and pressure causing unhealthiness and unhappiness to be rampant among the individuals who run the sidelines.\n\nSEEING HIS WELLNESS and his career at a crossroads, Steve Clifford finally prioritized his health over his career, a choice that many in the industry fear, especially because a second opportunity is never promised in sports.\n\nI was “scared, big-time scared,” said Clifford, when asked if he felt his coaching career would end after his leave absence. But from the stories surrounding his descent into a recurring state of despondency and desolation, he made the right decision.\n\nDuring a grueling, three-city road trip with his team, the Charlotte Hornets, Clifford’s poor habits began to rear their ugly head. He complained of feeling sick and not sleeping well — a problem exacerbated by the dubious bed quality at hotels on the road.\n\nAfter waking up early — before the rest of his staff — for the Hornets’ first game back at home after the road trip, Clifford sensed something was wrong. His head was pounding and rumbling, a debilitating feeling that was the tipping point in his battle against his health.\n\nHe texted an assistant on his staff, Pat Delaney, and begged him to run shoot-around while he struggled with the ill-feeling in his body. He went to his car to go home, seeking a reprieve from the pounding in his head.\n\n“I went out to drive home because I only lived four blocks away (from Charlotte’s arena),” he said. But “once I sat down in my car, I knew it wouldn’t be smart for me to drive. So, I just walked home.’’ The reason he couldn’t drive home was because his body was trembling as he sat in the driver’s seat.\n\nTwo days later, after undergoing a variety of tests from the Hornets medical staff — who are usually dedicated to the players — it was announced that Clifford would take a leave of absence.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the situation, these health problems had inflicted Clifford for over two years before action was taken. The medications he took only remedied his pain, but they never solved his very real issues.\n\n“As the headaches got worse, I just used stronger medication,” Clifford said. “And what you learn with headaches is that the medication is like a band-aid. You’re not taking care of the headaches.”\n\nBut taking time off was against everything Clifford knew since entering the industry. After working at the collegiate level for 15 years, he got his first job as an assistant in New York under Jeff Van Gundy, where he joined Tom Thibodeau, who is famous for his relentless nature, and Don Chaney, a former Coach of the Year.\n\nHe then persevered and fought his way from being a scout to gaining assistant roles on the Rockets, Magic, and Lakers. By the time he was named as head coach of the Hornets, he had accrued many poor habits. Among them, he stayed up late watching film and scouting other teams, as he specialized in defense, but he also made a point of arriving earlier to work than his colleagues, a habit he learned from Thibodeau.\n\nOver the years, Clifford’s sleeping routine became non-existent, and doctors would warned of the looming reality that he was on the path to developing chronic migraines — an experience that would ensure his coaching career ended.\n\nThankfully, for the wellness of Clifford and his family, he was able to take time off, re-learning the necessary habits that are conducive to good health, both physically and mentally. But the scary reality is that Clifford’s crisis was a byproduct of the industry he worked in; his actions modeled those before him, and there will be future coaches with the same steely desire that causes poor health.\n\nDescribing his monumental decision to take a leave of absence, Clifford recalled.“A year ago [in 2018], they made me do an MRI to make sure there was nothing there, and it wasn’t. But this year [2019] it got to the point where it was just so difficult to function during the day he said ‘look, you’re going to have to take some time off here.’ ”\n\nIN A SEASON full of chaos, while trying to make his third straight NBA Finals, Tyronn Lue had enough. Navigating through consistent physical pain, roster upheaval, and the pressure of coaching a LeBron James-led roster, he was never fully himself throughout the first half of the 2017–2018 season.\n\nLike many in the industry, however, Lue was convinced he needed to keep working, keep grinding. With the Cavaliers sporting a porous defense and a 3–5 record after just eight games, the stress continued to grow on Lue and the Cavaliers organization.\n\n“I think when you’re going through a tough season, tough stretch, it’s easy to say you’re going to bow out. And I didn’t want to be that guy. It was tough,” Lue told Rachel Nichols of ESPN at the time. He added that the determination of James to play in every regular-season game, despite many roster changes and even teammates battling mental health issues, motivated him to push through his health issues.\n\nIt’s easy to forget now, but as a young, inexperienced head coach, Lue’s story remains one of the most successful coaching debuts ever. Yet, as many have noted, this success was largely due to the nightly all-time performances of James — which meant that the physical and emotional grind that Lue endured was never recognized.\n\nNight after night, as the spotlight of the league was being shined on Cleveland, Lue felt the pressure — and his anxiety grew. Sleepless nights, strange pains, and overwhelming anxiety became a troubling reality. It didn’t help that the 2017–2018 Cavs remain as one of the most turbulent teams in recent history.\n\nAfter trading Kyrie Irving for Isaiah Thomas, the Cavs had three iterations of their roster that Lue had to manage: the pre-Thomas iteration, the iteration with Thomas and James (a partnership that failed), and the new, younger roster featuring inexperienced talent from the Lakers and Jazz to pair with James.\n\nWith 13 games to go, and his team battling for playoff positioning, Lue reached a breaking point in his health. After being unable to coach the second half of a game in Chicago, Lue met with team doctors to properly find a solution to his problems.\n\n“I have had chest pains and other troubling symptoms, compounded by a loss of sleep, throughout the year,” Lue said in a statement. “Despite a battery of tests, there have been no conclusions as to what the exact issue is.”\n\nThe issue, though he never named it, was simply being a head coach on one of the most high-profile teams in the league.\n\nHe finally took a leave of absence, getting a proper break for the first time since before his playing days in the league. He had to relearn many habits, including his sleep routine, changing his diet, and exercising on a more consistent basis.\n\nThis incident put life into perspective for Lue, who has lived a life of a blue-collar, tough-minded person while being in the basketball industry. For once, while missing over nine games to recover, he could step away from the game — no longer worried about silencing critics or worrying about disappointing int he playoffs.\n\nTom Withers from the Associated Press said it best when describing Lue, commenting “he [Lue] now realizes there are more important things than worrying about Cleveland’s rotation, defending the pick and roll or getting the Cavs back to the NBA Finals.\n\nSadly, the reality for most coaches is similar to Lue’s predicament: there are so many people to please, so many expectations to meet, and so much internal and external pressure in the NBA that quality of life becomes an afterthought.\n\n“While I have tried to work through it, the last thing I want is for it to affect the team,” Lue said before his leave of absence. “I am going to use this time to focus on a prescribed routine and medication, which has previously been difficult to start in the midst of a season. My goal is to come out of it a stronger and healthier version of myself so I can continue to lead this team to the championship we are all working towards.”\n\nAnd while he ultimately didn’t guide his team to a championship against the indomitable Golden State Warriors, he learned a lesson more valuable than the championship ring he owns from the 2016 Finals: nothing is more precious than life itself — not even a championship.\n\nWHEN A COACH’S power is tested, his roster questioned, and the pressure to win rising by the day, the natural response is simple: take control.\n\nBut throughout recent seasons, the balance of power has shifted to the players — and coaching has become a subservient role because of this shift in power. This effect has only added to the growing anxiety of coaches, who not are being fired at an unprecedented rate — despite often not being allowed to mold a team’s culture or identity.\n\nIn recent months, two of the more controlling coaches in the league — John Beilein and Kenny Atkinson — lost their jobs, and their firings have left a trail pointing directly at their very own players.\n\nAtkinson, after joining a defunct Nets roster, changed the identity of the team to one of hard work and determination — a coach’s dream. He developed players who were on the fringes of the league, and he turned them into players that figure to be key pieces on next season’s contending roster in Brooklyn.\n\nHe developed D’Angelo Russell, Joe Harris, Jarrett Allen, Caris LeVert, and Spencer Dinwiddie, while also resuscitating the careers of veterans like DeMarre Carroll and Jared Dudley.\n\nYet, as reports come out detailing why, in the middle of a non-competitive season, Brooklyn would fire the coach who saved their franchise, there is a very clear picture being painted of Atkinson’s departure: the players, including those whose careers took off under Atkinson, refused to vouch or defend Atkinson as a coach.\n\nAnd as Kyrie Irving, Kevin Durant, and DeAndre Jordan — three high-profile players — came to Brooklyn, Atkinson’s voice no longer echoed with the same power it had just months earlier. By the preseason, Irving was dealing with his uncontrollable mood wings, while demanding an almost unparalleled amount of isolation possessions on offense. Durant, for his part, questioned if Atkinson was a championship coach months after praising him, all while never taking the floor this season.\n\nAnd worst of all, the locker room became divided over Atkinson’s decision to start Jarrett Allen, a young, athletic center, over Jordan, whose effectiveness has fallen precipitously since his departure from L.A. Players are supposed to put winning above all, so it is almost disturbing to see how quickly they became frustrated over a trivial decision to start Allen — who is unquestionably a better player than Jordan.\n\nPerhaps, most telling of all was Atkinson’s push for his firing — as he felt the new team in Brooklyn was too toxic and too divided for him to want to continue coaching them.\n\nAnd months earlier before Atkinson’s firing, John Beilein, Cleveland’s flashy coaching hire from the collegiate ranks, was fired as quickly as he was hired. Troubling reports and stories came out of Cleveland almost weekly, with on-court drama and locker room tension dominating headlines.\n\nWhile Beilein’s coaching left much to be desired, particularly his inability to incorporate a game-plan that fostered his developing talents and older veterans, the real story of his firing was the lack of power he had compared to his players.\n\nOne of the most comical yet disturbing headlines was Beilein reportedly calling his team “thugs” when he meant “slugs,” a headline that had the collective basketball world looking down on Cleveland, yet again. But what ensued tells a more sad reality — a reality in which players can force their coaches into submission.\n\nOver the ensuing months, players would attempt to play songs with the word “thug” whenever Beilein was present. This, paired with incompetence from the younger players and dissatisfaction from the older veterans created an atmosphere that was rapidly deteriorating the health of Beilein (who is 67).\n\nBy the time he renegotiated his role in Cleveland, Beilein had experienced fits of anger from his supposed star player, Kevin Love, ignorance from his young players, and explicit taunting from his team as a whole.\n\nKnowing his power was gone forever in the Cavalier locker room, Beilein made an embarrassing, yet correct choice: he would resign, effectively sealing any hopes of an NBA coaching career."
