        "text": "We'll call it the payoff for the Spurs. The chance for Gregg Popovich and company to finally see the NBA's free agent market reward the most consistent franchise in sports. Everything clicked into place at once in San Antonio, and a contender that never went away was reborn.\n\nWe'll call it the star turn of DeAndre Jordan. The moment where the third-best player on a second-round playoff team managed to earn two teams fines and provide a full news cycle's worth of entertainment that proved to be as fictional as his choice of Dallas as a new home.\n\nMORE: Eight players ready for breakout seasons | NBA Draft grades | Free agency winners and losers\n\nWe'll call it the summer before the summer. The final offseason before the NBA's new TV and media deal boosted the salary cap to unseen heights without relenting and led to mass spending and mass hysteria. Because that's what's coming. And you thought Enes Kanter got paid ...\n\nTaking stock of this NBA offseason requires two eyes toward the future and one toward the past. Several teams dramatically changed their future paths, while none stayed pat entirely. A few players were injured, a few aged obviously, and many others showed signs of being on the cusp of breaking out.\n\nSporting News' Adi Joseph sorted through all of the action to try to find every team's plan and vision for the future. The resulting project was this list for you to slide through, grading every team on its performance this offseason. Every move and decision, including those not listed or involving future assets, was considered. And in the off chance that you may not agree, feel free to contact @AdiJoseph on Twitter or [email protected] with your thoughts.\n\nAtlanta Hawks: B-\n\nKey newcomers: C Tiago Splitter, SG Tim Hardaway Jr., SF Justin Holiday, C Walter Tavares.\n\nKey losses: SF DeMarre Carroll, C Pero Antic, PF Elton Brand, SG John Jenkins.\n\nWhat do we make of a team turning into the skid? Coming off the best season in Atlanta Hawks history, management decided that losing DeMarre Carroll was inevitable and made a great trade to bring in Splitter from the Spurs for nothing. But that put them in a spot where three of their four or five best players are big men.\n\nHardaway, Holiday (an underrated addition), Thabo Sefolosha and Kent Bazemore will vie for minutes alongside Kyle Korver, but the wing depth was a question mark last year and is only worse now. On the other hand, the frontcourt is as good as any in the NBA.\n\nThe Hardaway trade is the perplexing one, as the Hawks gave up the No. 15 pick for him and two future second-rounders in two trades. That may be the right move to win now, if Hardaway can emerge like Iman Shumpert did after leaving New York, but it is easy to imagine the No. 15 pick ending up a better value.\n\nIt still feels like coach/president Mike Budenholzer has another move to make because Carroll will be missed. Re-signing Paul Millsap bumps this grade up.\n\nGrade: B-\n\nMORE HAWKS: Dominique Wilkins explains Hawks ignoring small ball\n\nBoston Celtics: C+\n\nKey newcomers: PF Amir Johnson, PF/C David Lee, SF Jonas Jerebko, PG Terry Rozier, SG R.J. Hunter, PF Jordan Mickey, PF Perry Jones.\n\nKey departures: PF Brandon Bass, SF Gerald Wallace.\n\nBoston has become a land of power forwards, to the point that it is completely unclear who president Danny Ainge prioritizes. And the right answer may be none. There is no doubt the Celtics would love to package up some of their assets in another move, but right now they seem to specialize in redundancy — the selection of defense-first guard Rozier was a real head-scratcher with Marcus Smart and Avery Bradley already on board.\n\nThe big question is the value of all of those assets. And much of that hinges on the Nets, whose picks the Celtics own for the next three years in one form or another. No one wants to give up real value for mid-to-low first-round picks, and the Celtics’ best hope is the Nets fall apart in their quasi-rebuild efforts. (The very-injury-prone Brook Lopez is the centerpiece, so it’s possible.)\n\nThe good news is the Celtics definitely enter this season with more talent than they had last year, when they stunned everyone with a second-half push into the playoffs. But it’s not that much better, as small forward remains an issue. And coach Brad Stevens is going to have one heck of a time balancing minutes in the frontcourt, with a whole bunch of guys you wish were your third big man.\n\nThe big move hasn’t come. It may never.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nMORE CELTICS: How Brad Stevens went from 'clueless' to coaching elite\n\nCharlotte Hornets: B\n\nKey newcomers: SF Nicolas Batum, PF/C Frank Kaminsky, C Spencer Hawes, PG Jeremy Lin, PF Tyler Hansbrough.\n\nKey departures: PF Noah Vonleh, SG Gerald Henderson, SG Lance Stephenson, PG Mo Williams, C Bismack Biyombo.\n\nThe Hornets had one of the busiest early offseasons in recent memory, making a few multiplayer trades before the NBA Draft and reportedly rejecting a huge offer on draft night. The final result: a very different roster that might produce similar results.\n\nHere’s the good: The Hornets dramatically improved their shooting. Every addition other than Hansbrough will help the league’s worst 3-point shooting team, and that doesn’t even factor in improvements from several returnees beyond the arc. These were very offensive-minded additions, with the arguable exception of Batum.\n\nAnd the Frenchman is the X-factor here. Trading 20-year-old Vonleh and longtime starter Henderson to the Blazers was a risk with potentially huge dividends. Batum has seemed underused for years on offense, a product of his willingness to become a glue guy for a balanced lineup. Charlotte will ask for more — all while hoping that he stays. Batum is a free agent next offseason, and losing him can’t be an option after giving up Vonleh, arguably the highest-potential player on the roster.\n\nA glut of positional overlap could be a concern, too. The Hornets project to play very big now, and Kaminsky, Hawes and Hansbrough will battle with fellow offensive-minded big men Al Jefferson and Cody Zeller for time. Instead of landing a shooting guard (Devin Booker in the draft or Marco Belinelli in free agency, for instance), the Hornets turned toward a less traditional alignment.\n\nThe moves were risks, but the Hornets have much more offensive talent now than they did a year ago. The defense will need to be figured out, but they have the right coach for the job in Steve Clifford. The crowning move, however, was the final move: They signed defensive linchpin Michael Kidd-Gilchrist to a four-year contract extension at a very reasonable price.\n\nGrade: B\n\nMORE HORNETS: Kidd-Gilchrist can't shoot, but he can be a franchise centerpiece\n\nChicago Bulls: B+\n\nKey newcomer: PF Bobby Portis.\n\nKey departures: None.\n\nNo team changed its personnel less than the Bulls, yet few teams changed their identities more. New coach Fred Hoiberg will take all the spotlight, but the new Bulls are leaning on more than his emphasis on offense to contrast the Tom Thibodeau era. Derrick Rose has a lot to build on after a strong second half as he continues his rehabilitation, and Nikola Mirotic could be a breakout star this season if he gets the minutes.\n\nThat’s the complex issue at hand. The Bulls do not have a very creative front office, and they decided to stick with this roster despite an overload of big men — and then added a very talented rookie in Portis to that mix. The good thing is that they didn’t need to make any major upgrades, especially if Hoiberg can get more out of Tony Snell and Doug McDermott than Thibodeau did. But Mirotic can’t be blocked for minutes again after his efficient rookie season. Moving Pau Gasol would be a starting point, as Joakim Noah is an emotional and (when he’s healthy) defensive leader who will help keep that end of the court in order without Thibodeau.\n\nBut short of that, the Bulls didn’t mess up. They hopefully will be healthier next season, and they probably were the second-best team in the Eastern Conference at full strength last year. Locking up Jimmy Butler on a five-year contract and bringing back Mike Dunleavy at a reasonable rate were solid moves. Hiring Hoiberg was essential.\n\nGrade: B+\n\nMORE BULLS: Butler could set a trend with unusual money-up-front request\n\nCleveland Cavaliers: A-\n\nKey newcomer: PG Mo Williams.\n\nKey departures: None.\n\nIt’s impossible to fault the Cavaliers for mostly standing pat, and the one big move they made was bringing back Williams on a smart contract. That is a good move because Williams provides playmaking insurance for another Kyrie Irving injury, which they sorely lacked in the NBA Finals, but he also can play off the ball.\n\nThe Tristan Thompson extension situation has been awkward and clumsy, but getting Kevin Love to take a max contract now instead of using leverage to secure a bigger one in a year or two was excellent work. Love (26 years old) and Irving (23) are under contract for the next five years. They also saved some money while keeping J.R. Smith.\n\nThere remains the complication of locking up Tristan Thompson on a deal all sides can agree with, but that seems more like a formality and a game of chicken than anything else. It's not fun that it's taken this long, but it doesn't say anything bad about either side that they are trying to use as much leverage as possible in a one-team, one-player bidding war.\n\nStill, factor in that LeBron James is not going anywhere, and the Cavs had a ridiculously inexpensive offseason that did what it needed to do. That includes the nice trade exception they added by dealing Brendan Haywood’s non-guaranteed contract.\n\nDan Gilbert brought back James in a shared mission to bring a championship to Cleveland, and it's good to see he is willing to pay the cost.\n\nGrade: A-\n\nMORE CAVALIERS: Showing financial commitment to a worthy cause\n\nOklahoma City Thunder: B-\n\nKey additions: PG Cameron Payne, SF Josh Huestis.\n\nKey departures: PF Perry Jones, SG Jeremy Lamb.\n\nSo they gave a maximum-level contract to Enes Kanter. That’s the move to discuss here. That’s the move that could make or break this run of success. Kanter is a divisive player for the right reasons; his offensive skill is rare in modern centers, yet his defensive ineptitude could tear apart a team that had previously asked centers to focus on that end.\n\nKanter made a lot of sense for the Thunder last season because he came in after Kevin Durant’s final game of the year. He was great as a No. 2 scorer, but he now is joined by Durant and Serge Ibaka. To throw a max contract match of the Blazers’ offer at Kanter meant the Thunder were committing to him, and given his attitude problems in Utah, that could be dangerous. He may not have much of a trade market if he fails.\n\nRegardless, every move the Thunder made this offseason was geared toward winning now. That’s what they know they must do to keep Durant in town as he hits free agency next year. Lamb and Jones are talented, but they didn’t reach any semblance of their potential in Oklahoma City bench roles. Payne could be a nice backup point guard, though he doesn’t need to take that role immediately. Re-signing Kyle Singler could prove to be a great under-the-radar decision, even if they slightly overpaid.\n\nIt’s tough to justify paying Kanter as much as they did, especially given that he seems to be a stylistic mismatch for the healthy Thunder. But it also is tough to argue for letting a good player leave for nothing as Durant watches. If Durant and Russell Westbrook are in Thunder uniforms in 2018, we will know that whatever happened now worked.\n\nGrade: B-\n\nMORE THUNDER: Why Westbrook is Allen Iverson's favorite player\n\nPhoenix Suns: C+\n\nKey additions: C Tyson Chandler, PF Mirza Teletovic, PF Jon Leuer, SG Devin Booker, PG Ronnie Price.\n\nKey departures: SF Marcus Morris, C Brandan Wright, SG Reggie Bullock.\n\nNo team has as much uncertainty remaining as the Suns. That’s because Markieff Morris, their second-best player last season, is demanding a trade after feeling betrayed by the organization over the trade of twin brother Marcus. Now, the Morris twins have great contracts (signed jointly last offseason), play well together and seemed comfortable in Phoenix, but off-the-court issues were overshadowing their play. The situation was tough.\n\nThe problem is that Marcus Morris probably would not have been traded had it not been for the Suns’ failed pursuit of LaMarcus Aldridge. It was impressive that Phoenix landed Chandler and was a finalist for Aldridge, showing a new position at the free agency table. But the success may have backfired if it costs them Markieff Morris (the better twin) for little return.\n\nThe newcomers provide exactly what the Suns need, though. Chandler will anchor the defense, while Teletovic and Leuer battle for minutes to replace what Channing Frye gave the 2013-14 Suns that could not be replicated last season. Booker was a great value at No. 13 overall in the NBA Draft, and he should compete with fellow Kentucky alumnus for minutes at shooting guard. Bringing back Brandon Knight, even on a five-year contract after a half-season of struggling, was wise because the contract works well under the expanding salary cap.\n\nIf the Suns can get Markieff Morris back on track or land a good return for him in a trade, this grade goes up a bit. For now, though, the continual distractions for what was once an up-and-coming team are not ideal, regardless of talent.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nMORE SUNS: Full quotes demanding trade from Markieff Morris\n\nSacramento Kings: B\n\nKey additions: C Kosta Koufos, PG Rajon Rondo, PF/C Willie Cauley-Stein, SG Marco Belinelli, PG Seth Curry, SF Caron Butler, PF Quincy Acy, SG James Anderson.\n\nKey departures: PF Jason Thompson, PF Derrick Williams, PG Ray McCallum, PF Carl Landry, SG Nik Stauskas, PG Andre Miller.\n\nThis was, bluntly, the most difficult grade to determine. (Shoutout to the Suns for at least giving the Kings competition.)\n\nHere’s the thing: The Kings dramatically improved their roster this offseason. This will be the best opening-day roster for Sacramento since Peja Stojakovic’s prime. There’s enough youth to have hope for the future, and there’s enough experience to suggest that this group could make a stunning playoff push.\n\nYet we spent the entire offseason discussing how they were falling apart. Rumors of coach George Karl wanting DeMarcus Cousins gone still have not abated, and friction from the top down seems to be the name of the game under second-year owner Vivek Ranadive.\n\nLet’s put that aside for a moment. Karl and Cousins may not enjoy each other, but they both are somewhat locked in to be in the locker room for the start of the season. Firing Karl now would be desperate, and he’s owed a lot of money. Trading Cousins might cause a fan revolt. So they will be told to act their ages and get along. Let’s imagine that works; Cousins is a superstar, and Karl is a veteran, proven coach.\n\nThat leaves three moves up for debate: the trade of Stauskas and several future picks for salary cap space; the trade of McCallum for a future second-rounder; and the signing of Rondo to a one-year contract. Rondo may not even be good enough to start over Darren Collison, and the upside of his contract is low for Sacramento. If he’s good, they’ll have to overpay to keep him. If he’s not, that’s $10 million down the drain — which was the whole reason they traded Stauskas and the picks to the 76ers. Rondo also made McCallum expendable, and the return was minimal.\n\nStill, there’s plenty to like. Koufos was a great value signing. Belinelli, Butler and Curry should help with shooting. And Cauley-Stein has great upside and should play well with Cousins. The team isn’t good enough to make much of a dent in the Western Conference, but even a playoff bid would be nice right now. And maybe this roster can get there.\n\nThat doesn't mean there aren't cracks in the bridge.\n\nGrade: B\n\nMORE KINGS: Offseason turmoil starts at the top, with owner Ranadive\n\nSan Antonio Spurs: A+\n\nKey additions: PF LaMarcus Aldridge, PF David West, PG Ray McCallum, SG Jonathon Simmons, C Boban Marjanovic.\n\nKey departures: C Tiago Splitter, PG Cory Joseph, C Aron Baynes, SG Marco Belinelli.\n\nThe Spurs emerged as the clear-cut winners of the offseason to little surprise. First, they locked up Kawhi Leonard on a well-deserved five-year maximum contract and Danny Green on a team-friendly four-year deal. Then they went to work maneuvering salary cap space to bring in Aldridge, the best player to change teams this offseason, while convincing West to take a veteran’s minimum contract after opting out of a $12 million season with the Pacers.\n\nBut perhaps the most genius move by Gregg Popovich, R.C. Buford and company was the trade with the Kings for McCallum, a young point guard who cost San Antonio only a future second-rounder. The Spurs couldn’t afford to replace Joseph with a real backup point guard, so they got McCallum for next-to-nothing.\n\nThere is one clear-cut fault here: They did not figure out how to staff the center position. Splitter and Ayres were not essential players, but they will be difficult to replace, particularly if 7-4 Serbian Marjanovic can’t play because of injuries. Aldridge has never been great at center, and West and Boris Diaw don’t have ideal size.\n\nBut all of that is quibbling over a masterpiece. The Spurs simultaneously locked up their best players under 30 and brought in a new superstar to march into the future with them. Then they filled out their bench anyway, as though Popovich and Buford didn’t have enough respect already.\n\nGrade: A+\n\nMORE SPURS: Tim Duncan has tallest task of his career ahead\n\nWashington Wizards: C+\n\nKey additions: SG Gary Neal, SF Jared Dudley, SF Kelly Oubre Jr.\n\nKey departures: SF Paul Pierce, C Kevin Seraphin, SF Rasual Butler.\n\nThe Wizards spent their offseason getting younger on the wing, which was a good priority given how many key minutes were played by Pierce (37) and Butler (36) last season. Oubre probably won’t contribute much next year, and Dudley will spend the early part of his season getting over back surgery. But Otto Porter Jr. should be ready for significantly increased minutes, taking pressure off them.\n\nNeal is the key addition, and he makes sense for a lot of reasons. He can play either guard spot and provides a scoring punch the bench needed last season. He will help Washington play small and probably is glad to return closer to his hometown of Baltimore. He struggled last season, though, and he will have a lot to prove.\n\nLosing Seraphin could be a blow. The Wizards are old and injury-prone up front, and the 25-year-old Frenchman was a nice change of pace to that. But a smaller frontcourt rotation also could bring more small-ball minutes, a welcome change for a team that looked excellent with Pierce and Porter at the forward spots during the playoffs.\n\nThe biggest issue will be losing Pierce's presence, on the court and in the locker room. Dudley and Martell Webster now will be counted on, but both have had back issues. And someone new will have to rise to the occasion for the biggest shots of the season.\n\nGrade: C+\n\nMORE WIZARDS: John Wall reaffirms what everyone but Cowherd knows about his leadership"
