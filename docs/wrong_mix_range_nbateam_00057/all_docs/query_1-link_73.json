        "text": "New Phoenix Suns head coach Monty Williams was high on the potential of his new coaching staff before officially formulating it.\n\n“The guys that we have targeted are smarter than I am,” Williams said at last month’s introductory news conference. “They’re bright guys who’ve been around the league. Some have played. I don’t want to get too far ahead of myself, but I’m really excited about our staff and they really wanted to be here.”\n\nThe staff is now official.\n\nThe Suns have hired Willie Green, Darko Rajakovic, Mark Bryant, Randy Ayers, Larry Greer and Steve Blake as assistant coaches and Riccardo Fois and Ben Strong as player-development coaches. Ryan Frazier was hired as head video coordinator.\n\n“In assembling a staff, the goal was simple: identify high-character individuals with high-level experience who will work relentlessly to develop a culture of championship habits here in Phoenix,\" said Williams in a release announcing their hiring.\n\nGreen, 37, who played 12 NBA seasons, has been an assistant coach and worked in player development for Golden State the past three seasons.\n\nThe Warriors won back-to-back NBA titles during Green's first two seasons and reached the Finals last season with him on the staff.\n\n\"He's one of the younger guys in the NBA who I look up to,\" said Williams of Green, 37, who coached Golden State's Summer League team last year, on the Suns' team podcast.\n\n\"He's just a good man. An unbelievable coach. I coached him New Orleans. I'd be here all day talking about Willie. I think Willie is going to have an impact on Devin (Booker) that's going to take our program to a level that it's going to be really good in the future.\"\n\nWilliams coached Green in New Orleans in the 2010-11 season.\n\nRajakovic was previously an assistant with the Oklahoma City Thunder for seven seasons. Before that, Rajakovic spent three years as head coach in Spain.\n\nBryant was on the Thunder staff for 12 seasons. He joined them in 2007 before the team’s final season in Seattle. He played two season for the Suns (1996-98).\n\nAyers spent the past three seasons as a pro scout in Brooklyn, but has more than three decades of coaching experience. He previously coached under Williams in New Orleans all five seasons Williams was head coach.\n\nGreer joins the Suns following two seasons with the Minnesota Timberwolves. He served as an assistant coach for the Timberwolves last season after working as the club’s advance scout in 2017-18.\n\nLike Ayers, Greer reunites with Williams. Greer was an advanced scout in Oklahoma City and Portland when Williams was an assistant. He also was an assistant at Arizona State for three seasons (2012-15).\n\nBlake is familiar with Williams and Suns General Manager James Jones. He and Jones were teammates in Portland in 2007-08 when Williams was an assistant there.\n\nBlake returned to Portland to work as an coaching intern in 2017-18 after a 13-year career as a player. He worked as an on-court assistant last season.\n\nFois has been on Gonzaga men's basketball team staff for the past five seasons, most recently as the director of analytics. Strong worked with Williams in Philadelphia in player development last season.\n\nFrazier served as video/player development assistant in Milwaukee last season.\n\nHave opinion about current state of the Suns?
