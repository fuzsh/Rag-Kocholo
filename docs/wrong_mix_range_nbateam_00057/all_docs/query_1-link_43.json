        "text": "Ranked By\n\n685 votes\n\n197 voters\n\nVoting Rules\n\nVote up the best NBA players who can't dunk.\n\nWho are the best NBA players who can't dunk? Being an NBA player without the necessary hops to dunk in a two-handed slam is kind of embarrassing. For some, not dunking can be a cheeky gimmick, like how point guard Ricky Rubio has never intentionally utilized his 6'9\" wingspan to jam one home in an NBA game. For other players in NBA who can't dunk, it's due to genetics and basically not being tall enough, or not wanting to use those sneakers that jack up your calves enough to help increase vertical leaping ability. So, who is the best NBA player who can't dunk? Which NBA players with no hops do you love?\n\nWhen it come to the best NBA players to never slam dunk, Steve Nash is up there with the best of them. In his 17-year NBA career, Nash attempted just one in-game dunk, in 2007, but he missed it. Then there's NBA All Stars like Jason Kidd and Jameer Nelson who couldn't dunk. There are even shooting guards who couldn't dunk like J.J. Redick and Beno Udrih.\n\nVote up the best NBA players who couldn't dunk, and help decide the best NBA player in history with no hops.\n\nMost divisive: Pablo Prigioni\n\nOver 100 Ranker voters have come together to rank this list of NBA Stars Who Can't Dunk\n\nHeight: 6'3\"\n\nWingspan: 6'4\"\n\nSteve Nash, born February 7, 1974, in Johannesburg, South Africa, is a retired professional basketball player who is best known for his time in the NBA. Raised in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, Nash's athletic prowess was evident from an early age, but it was during his tenure at Santa Clara University that he truly began to make waves. His remarkable skills saw him being selected as the 15th pick by the Phoenix Suns in the 1996 NBA draft, marking the start of a career that would span nearly two decades. Nash's journey in the NBA was nothing short of extraordinary. He played for teams such as the Phoenix Suns, Dallas Mavericks, and Los Angeles Lakers, bringing his unique style and vision to each game. His achievements include being named the NBA's Most Valuable Player (MVP) twice, in 2005 and 2006, an honor only a handful of players have ever received. Nash also managed to secure eight NBA All-Star designations and became one of the top ten players for assists in NBA history. His ability to create scoring opportunities for his teammates earned him a reputation as one of the best point guards in the league. Off the court, Nash has been equally impactful. He established the Steve Nash Foundation in 2001, aiming to assist underserved children in their health, personal development, education, and enjoyment of life. His philanthropic efforts extend to environmental sustainability, where he has been an outspoken advocate. Nash's commitment to the sport and society has transcended his playing career, making him an influential figure in both realms.
