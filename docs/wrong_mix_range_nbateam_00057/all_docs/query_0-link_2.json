        "text": "Watson lives in the Los Angeles area with his actress wife, and his first preference would be to sign with the Lakers, the source said. The Lakers are high on Steve Blake, but would prefer to not spend their entire midlevel exception, possibly making Watson an affordable option.\n\nSources close to the Orlando Magic peg Clippers’ guard Steve Blake as the team’s primary free agent acquisition. Sources say the Magic could offer a similar package to what was given to Brandon Bass last summer ($4 years roughly $16 million). Blake is expected to have several suitors this week and may make a a visit to Orlando early in the process."
