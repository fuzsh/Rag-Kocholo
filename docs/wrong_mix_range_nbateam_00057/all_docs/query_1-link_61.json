        "text": "Record: 45-37, 3rd in Pacific Division\n\nExpectations were high heading into the season after the Lakers acquired Orlando Magic star Dwight Howard in the biggest blockbuster trade of the summer. Howard, who was labeled by many as Kobe Bryantâs heir apparent, immediately made the Lakers a preseason favorite for the NBA title. Those expectations, however, quickly crumbled after Howardâs subpar play coupled by an early-season coaching change and numerous injuries crippled the Lakersâ chances to re-establish themselves as one of the Western Conferenceâs elite teams. The season also was marked by the death of longtime owner Jerry Buss.\n\nAfter the Lakers started the season 1-4, Coach Mike Brown was fired by the team. Assistant coach Bernie Bickerstaff took over as interim coach before the team hired Mike DâAntoni to a multiyear contract. The Lakers spoke to Brownâs predecessor, Phil Jackson, about the job first, but they ended up giving the position to DâAntoni after Jackson requested two days to think about the offer. DâAntoni made his coaching debut with the Lakers on November 20, but it did little to reverse the Lakersâ slide down the standings as injuries started to take their toll. Injuries to Steve Blake, Steve Nash and Pau Gasol played a key role in the Lakers posting a 20-26 record by the end of January.\n\nIn danger of missing the playoffs for the first time since 2005, a healthier Lakers squad posted a winning record over the final three months of the season to qualify for the playoffs. But the teamâs hopes of mounting a surprise playoff run were shattered in April when star Kobe Bryant suffered a torn left Achillesâ tendon. With Howard continuing to struggle as both an offensive and defensive leader for the Lakers in the wake of Bryantâs injury, the Lakers were swept by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round of the playoffs. Howard left Los Angeles in the offseason, signing with the Houston Rockets.\n\n-- Austin Knoblauch"
