The NBA free-agency period has begun, and with it, the rumors have begin running amok. Here are two big ones involving the Orlando Magic from Yahoo!'s Adrian Wojnarowski:

Several teams without salary-cap space, including Cleveland, Orlando and Houston are interested in making presentations to [Amar'e] Stoudemire. They hope to acquire him through sign-and-trades.

The Magic's best trading chip is Vince Carter's semi-expiring contract; any sign-and-trade for a major star would certainly include him, as well as Marcin Gortat, who told the Polish media earlier this week that the Magic told him they would be willing to deal him in such a trade.

Also from Wojnarowski...

The Celtics could then use their midlevel exception for a different player. Several sources believe that [Danny] Ainge’s target is Orlando’s J.J. Redick, who is a restricted free agent.

I'd say the chances of the Magic matching an offer sheet worth the mid-level exception are 100%. Anything more than that will give them pause.

Redick, incidentally, isn't in a hurry to secure his future. He is currently honeymooning and not in the United States. I'm sure Redick's agents are fielding calls on his behalf, however.

And Steve Kyler of HOOPSWORLD passes this along:

Sources close to the Orlando Magic peg Clippers' guard Steve Blake as the team's primary free agent acquisition. Sources say the Magic could offer a similar package to what was given to Brandon Bass last summer ($4 years roughly $16 million). Blake is expected to have several suitors this week and may make a a visit to Orlando early in the process.

I took a look at Blake's credentials earlier this week. He would be a solid fit as the Magic's backup point guard.
