        "text": "The Remains of the Day is a critically acclaimed novel by Kazuo Ishiguro. The film adaptation in 1993 was well received by critics. The 1993 film mostly stays true to the original story with some understandable changes to plot to make the film not too arduously long. And there are many instances that the film version does deliver finer experiences. However, the differences in the way the story is presented make the movie as a whole slightly less effective. Furthermore, some key elements of the original story were overlooked to an extent that makes the ending of the film misleading and sloppy.\n\nThe most noticeable difference is that there is no narrative voice in the movie. In the novel, Stevens frequently provides details of various events and experiences he goes through. In different parts of the story, Stevens would explain the reasoning behind the decisions he makes and, more importantly, describe his emotional state, albeit sometimes being unaccountable. These details are essential to the development of the story. However, the superior acting of Anthony Hopkins lessens the disappointment of not hearing a narrator providing insights into the mind of Stevens.\n\nThe definition of a great butler involves, as Stevens puts it, “dignity in keeping my position.” And this topic of how to define a great butler suffers the most from a lack of narrative. What is lacking in the film is the process of thinking that helps Stevens to reach a conclusion. A conclusion that he does not feel perfect about but is a core idea of his principles as a butler. While the film gives us scenes that are crucial to convey the idea of a “great butler”, the thinking process presented abundantly in the novel shows us a more solid foundation on which Stevens bases his principles and beliefs as a butler.\n\nHowever, there are many scenes from the film so well performed and arranged that help us to formulate a very similar or perhaps superior impression of Stevens’ character to the one we have from the novel. One such example can be found near the end of the film where young Mr. Cardinal visits unexpectedly. Stevens, after learning that Miss Kenton has accepted Mr. Benn’s proposal, continues to serve Lord Darlington and his visitors. When Mr. Cardinal attempts to make Stevens understand how big a mistake Lord Darlington is making, Stevens is obviously being influenced by what he says. Shortly afterward, Stevens goes down to the cellar and lets a bottle of wine slip from his hand, a very rare mistake. Stevens then appears in the corridor and hears Miss Kenton crying. He then pushes through the ajar door telling Miss Kenton a trivial matter and then he leaves.\n\nWhile in the novel, the scenes are described slightly differently, Stevens does not enter Miss Kenton’s parlor nor does he drop the bottle of wine. But Stevens tells us what he feels about the night — “…come through an extremely trying evening, throughout which I had managed to preserve ‘dignity in keeping with my position…’” What Stevens describes afterward gives us reason to speculate whether Miss Kenton’s forthcoming departure or a potential terrible mistake by Lord Darlington or both make it “an extremely trying evening.” Comparing the scenes from the movie and the novel, both achieve a sense of mystery as to what really occupies Stevens’ mind during that night. Nevertheless, the scenes from the movie are so well arranged and performed that it might pack more dramatic effect than the original passages.\n\nThere is one key element that the movie fails to capitalize on. Bantering is one of the recurring elements that has an essential role in the closure of the story but is nearly absent in the film. In the movie, we may notice that Stevens is capable of responding to Mr. Faraday’s banter at the very end, a great deal of improvement over his inability at the beginning. But not receiving much-needed attention during the rest of the film, the topic loses its potential to connect the title of the story and the future that awaits Stevens or more importantly how Stevens prepares himself for the future.\n\nThe original story has a wonderfully designed resolution. In the final few pages of the novel, an old man sitting with Stevens tells him that “…your attitude is all wrong… Don’t keep looking back all the time, you’re bound to get depressed… you’ve got to keep looking forward… You’ve got to enjoy yourself. The evening is the best part of the day….” And Stevens later states that “…I should adopt a more positive outlook and try to make the best of what remains of my day.” In the final few paragraphs, Stevens finally becomes more enthusiastic about bantering in the remainder of his career. The ending provides a clear connection between the title of the book, The Remains of the Day, and the future that Stevens is looking forward to.\n\nThe modified ending from the movie, on the other hand, is a sloppy and misleading conclusion to Stevens’ story. Instead of the old man, Miss Kenton sits with Stevens on the bench, not a problematic modification. However, she only says “…for many people, the evening is the best part of the day. The part they most look forward to.” And Miss Kenton asks what Stevens most looks forward to. He replies “…Always was more work, work, and more work and will continue to be so, I have no doubt.” After bidding farewell to Miss Kenton, Stevens returns to Darlington Hall exchanging a conversation as well as a small talk. The bantering appears out of context losing its purpose in the story. Moreover, the poorly employed and distorted dialogue between Miss Kenton and Stevens actually leaves us with a sense of sorrow, a drastically different feeling compared to the original.\n\nDespite being a condensed version of the novel, the film adaptation does capture the essence of the original version. Perhaps the execution of the film does hurt the overall experience due to some unfavorable changes. The main differences do not really interfere much with the topics presented in the story. We can greatly enjoy the part of the story where the international conference takes place from both the novel and the movie. The relationship between Stevens and Miss Kenton is as touching in the movie as in the novel. To be fair, the work by Kazuo Ishiguro is a real masterpiece while the 1993 film can defiantly provide a delightful experience."
