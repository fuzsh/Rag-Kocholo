        "text": "Warning: Contains spoilers\n\nAnthony Hopkins recently won his second Oscar for his stunning turn in The Father (2020). Much well-deserved praise ensued. Hopkins has always been a first-rate actor, from early supporting performances in the likes of The Lion in Winter (1968), through to excellent leads in the likes of The Bounty (1984), Shadowlands (1993), and of course, his most famous role, for which he also won an Oscar: The Silence of the Lambs (1991).\n\nHowever, for me, Hopkins’s best-ever performance is in the greatest Merchant-Ivory film, The Remains of the Day (1993). As James Stevens, butler to Lord Darlington (Edward Fox) circa 1930s Britain, he is the living, breathing embodiment of the protagonist in Kazuo Ishiguro’s Booker prize-winning novel. I can’t imagine any other actor playing him with such elegant subtlety, nuance, and understated anguish, in which every stiff-upper-lip imbued look and gesture speaks volumes. Superlatives are meaningless when describing the way his quietly tragic character gets under the skin."
