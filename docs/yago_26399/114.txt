Sweet Liberty

A Hollywood film crew invades the small Southern town of the author whose Revolutionary War novel they've turned into a racy teen comedy, much to his consternation. Alan Alda wrote, directed and stars in this lively farce, supported by Michael Caine, Michelle Pfeiffer, Bob Hoskins and Lillian Gish.
