        "text": "ALAN ALDA'S talent as a writer-director-star is also his Achilles heel: he's nice.\n\nHe seems to be a genuinely reflective man in a business made up mostly of people who shoot first and ask questions later, who never underestimate the possibilities of con-artistry and who have only the foggiest notions of right and wrong.\n\nAs he demonstrated with ''The Seduction of Joe Tynan'' (1979), the political comedy he wrote and starred in (but which Jerry Schatzberg directed), Mr. Alda sees the world not through the Hollywood movie-maker's periscope. He sees it in the round, more or less like the rest of us who ride subways and who read newspapers and books without hoping to find a hot property.\n\nIn ''The Four Seasons'' (1981), Mr. Alda's first film as a triple-threat man, his decency and generosity, as well as his gentle sense of humor, served the needs of a totally uncritical comedy about the enduring friendship of three middle-class couples. In the context of television's brainless sitcoms, Mr. Alda's compassionate, eye-level approach to the habits of the bourgeoisie appeared to be almost rigorously honest.\n\nThat honesty and niceness, however, are the undoing of his new film, ''Sweet Liberty,'' which he wrote and directed and stars in as Michael Burgess, a college professor who's written a best-selling, meticulously researched historical novel set during the American Revolution.\n\n''Sweet Liberty,'' opening today at the Tower East and other theaters, means to be a send-up of Hollywood manners and methods when a movie company invades Michael's small college town to shoot the screen version of the book, which, to his horror, has suddenly become a Revolutionary War comedy.\n\nNo matter how often the eccentricities of movie people have been used in plays and films (one of the funniest: that brief, soberly lunatic sequence from ''The Bank Dick''), they remain rich with possibilities, especially when exploited by people who, like W. C. Fields, Kaufman and Hart, Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder, thoroughly enjoy biting the hands that have fed them. If Mr. Alda ever did such a thing, he'd probably apologize.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
