On television this season, he is appearing on \"The West Wing.\"\n\nHe played Hawkeye Pierce on the classic television series \"M*A*S*H,\" and also wrote and directed many of the episodes. In eleven years on \"M*A*S*H,\" Alda won the Emmy Award five times and is the only person to be honored by the TV Academy as top performer, writer and director. In all, he has been nominated for 30 Emmys including a nomination in 1999 for his performance on ER. In 1994 he was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame. In addition, he has won the Director's Guild Award three times, has received six Golden Globes from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, and seven People's Choice Awards, and has been nominated for two Writer's Guild Awards.\n\nFor his role in Woody Allen's \"Crimes and Misdemeanors\" he won the D.W.
