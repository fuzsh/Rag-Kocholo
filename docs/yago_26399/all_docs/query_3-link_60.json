        "text": "This has been the perfect Maine summer for ice cream, but sometimes it can break the bank!\n\nI recently went to the iconic and famous Red's Dairy Freeze in South Portland. I hadn't been in a long time. I had been limiting my ice cream intake, and when I did splurge, it was with hard ice cream. But when you get a cone these days, a small size can cost you six to nine dollars! Not Red's.\n\nRed's only has soft serve, and I got a kiddie* cone, a swirl combo of chocolate and vanilla with chocolate sprinkles. It cost me $3.40. It was the perfect after-dinner sweet I was looking for.\n\n*I got a kiddie size because someone has changed the sizes of ice cream cones to where they all moved up a size. Small is really medium, medium is definitely large, and large usually comes with a wheelbarrow!\n\nRed's Dairy Freeze in South Portland has been around since the '50s.\n\nYou don't have to live in South Portland, Maine, to know about Red's. In fact, it was newsworthy when the place opened for the season, and people started planning their first trip. The ice cream was delicious, and the flavor choices were plenty. But it was the affordability that had families standing in a long line, waiting patiently for their turn. So worth it!\n\nDidn't Red's Dairy Freeze in South Portland, Maine, burn down?\n\nThey did have an electrical fire in the spring of 2010. Unfortunately, they had to demolish the building and rebuild with the help of local fundraisers. Red's was rebuilt to look exactly the same, and opened in March of 2011.\n\nThere's plenty of summer left to get to Red's in South Portland, Maine, and get yourself a dose of nostalgia and a great ice cream cone."
