        "text": "It only took Barbra Streisand six years to complete her EGOT, but it took her more than 20 to pen My Name is Barbra, her recently-released memoir from Viking Press. And if two decades sounds like a long time, you must not have picked up your copy yet. Clocking in at 966 pages—48 hours and 14 minutes if you’re listening to the read-by-Babs audiobook—the tome spans the singularly prolific artist’s 81 years on earth, from her torch-singing origins in Greenwich Village gay bars to her fraught relationship with her mother, Diana Kind. “I do love her,” Streisand writes in the short, wrenching chapter all about Diana. “But that doesn’t mean I like her.”\n\nRepeated throughout is a quote from G.B. Shaw’s Saint Joan (coincidentally, Barbra’s middle name): “It is an old saying that he who tells too much truth is sure to be hanged.” Well, in My Name is Barbra, Streisand braves the gallows. But the book, for all its unvarnished truth-telling, lacks an index. “No flipping straight to the sordid bits,” Streisand seems to say.\n\nUntil now. A Fran Fine-level Barbra fan, I inhaled the masterpiece in a few short days and cobbled together a handy little index—“cheat sheet” might be more apt; it’s not perfectly comprehensive, but it’ll get you where you need to go—for those eager to skip the filler and get to the meat of it. I recommend starting with Barbra’s digressions on the subject of food. They go down like buttah.\n\n———\n\nAbe, Shinzo | Page 840\n\n“In 1994 I was approached by the Institute of Politics at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government to be part of a program which over the years had brought in speakers ranging from Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, to Ted Turner, the founder of CNN.\n\nI thought, Oh my God … I was intimidated, yet it was hard to refuse, because they happened to catch me at just the right moment. I was so incensed at what was going on, and this was an opportunity to express my feelings about it.”\n\nAcid reflux | 868\n\n“It’s interesting how quickly I regressed from being charmed to ‘this will never work.’ I guess I was looking for the negative, and I found it. So I left, and Jim remembers that I didn’t even say goodbye to him.\n\nI went home so distressed that I asked Renata to make me a hot dog with mustard and relish. Fuck the diet. And then when I had finished it, I said ‘I need another one.’ I ate them both in bed, with two coffee ice cream cones afterward (I can never have just one), while I read the latest issue of The Economist. I thought, No more relationships. Back to politics.\n\nJim called several times that night, but I wasn’t ready to speak to him. I told Renata to say I was out.”\n\nActing like a chocolate chip | 35, 53\n\nThe Actors Studio | 16, 36, 48, 87, 431\n\n“Adam’s Rib” | 342\n\nAdams, Bryan | 859-860\n\nAdler, Stella | 343\n\nAerosmith | 877\n\nAbzug, Bella | 229, 350-353, 399, 795, 842\n\n“Here we were, two Jewish girls . . . Bella from the Bronx and Barbra from Brooklyn . . . who made good!”\n\nAgassi, Andre | 746-747, 795\n\n“It was a completely unexpected relationship, and it was fun. He sent me six dozen pink and yellow roses after one dinner. He came out to the ranch. I remember playing tennis with him as my partner in doubles (don’t laugh), and I was trying so hard that I tore my meniscus. I actually heard it pop, but I didn’t want to stop, even to ice it, because I didn’t want to look like a wimp.”\n\nAghayan, Ray | 426\n\nAIDS crisis | 617-618, 635, 640, 730, 749, 775, 782, 816\n\nAir Force One | 810\n\n“Airplane!” | 656\n\nAlbright, Madeline | 826-828, 908, 958\n\nAlda, Alan | 313, 352,\n\nAleichem, Sholem | 545\n\nAlexander the Great | 648\n\nAlexandre de Paris | 219\n\nAli, Muhammad | 429\n\n“Alice Doesn’t Live Here Anymore” | 405\n\n“Alice in Wonderland” | 191, 434\n\n“All Night Long” | 405, 531, 533\n\nAllen, Woody | 131, 335, 709\n\n“I was on the bill with Woody Allen, but we barely met. We were both such loners that we never said anything to each other. He would read in his dressing room, and I would read in mine.”\n\nAltman, Robert | 602\n\nAmazon stock | 895\n\nAmerican Civil Liberties Union | 398\n\nAmerican Film Institute | 896\n\n“An American in Paris” | 724\n\nAMFAR | 618\n\nAndersson, Bibi | 336, 339\n\n“Angelina Scarangella” | 223\n\nAngelou, Maya | 893\n\n“Angels in America” | 645\n\n“Anna Karenina” | 237, 323\n\n“On July 11, the first day of shooting, we were in an abandoned railroad station, built in the 1880s, with a soaring ceiling, Romanesque brick arches, and wrought-iron gates. We were doing the scene where the Ziegfeld girls arrive in Baltimore. There’s a moment when I step off the train, and I suddenly had an idea. I asked Willy, “What if we do a takeoff on Garbo’s entrance in Anna Karenina?” It’s a famous scene, where she’s hidden behind a burst of smoke coming off the train wheels, and then it clears to reveal her beautiful face as she stands in the doorway of the train. I thought it would be funny to do the same shot, but this time it would reveal me, coughing and waving the smoke away…”\n\n“Another Evening with Harry Stoones” | 79, 192\n\n“Another unsupportive male” | 701\n\nAnouilh, Jean | 36\n\n“Anxiety” | 782\n\n“In my thirties I was plagued with more anxiety-related problems. As I wrote in my journal, ‘I wish my stomach was absolutely normal again. I wish I could accept my fears and think everything will turn out okay. I want to be more loving, even to myself. I want to learn how to redirect negative thoughts into more positive ones.'”\n\n“Anyone Can Whistle” | 608, 752\n\nAOL stock | 895\n\n“Apparently Bush had called Clinton beforehand…” | 914\n\n“Apparently no one brings a dog to the White House…” | 938\n\nApple stock | 895\n\nArafat, Yasser | 834-835\n\nArcherd, Army | 470\n\nArendt, Hannah | 839\n\nAristotle | 648\n\nArlen, Harold | 50, 59, 66, 103, 120, 121, 124, 125, 134, 230, 444, 497, 604, 739-740\n\nArmstrong, Louis | 65, 282\n\nArmstrong-Jones, Antony (Lord Snowdown) | 257\n\nArnstein, Nicky | 109, 112, 154, 159, 160, 161, 165, 166, 167, 186, 518\n\nArt prices | 310-311\n\nAstaire, Fred | 218\n\n“Attracted to attractive men” | 673\n\n“I wanted to share my life with someone. It was very lonely being me… For Christmas I went to Aspen, and there, at a party, a man walked up to me. That was refreshing… if a guy makes the first move, he’s already a step ahead. And this guy was lean and tan, with an easy grin (and good teeth). His name was Don Johnson, and he was the heartthrob of the moment on the TV series Miami Vice. I have to admit, I’m very attracted to attractive men. (Okay, so I’m superficial!) It’s almost like an aesthetic thing . . . like a piece of art. I collect!”\n\nAvedon, Richard | 215, 218, 238, 330\n\n“The Awful Truth” | 342\n\nAznavour, Charles | 591, 910\n\nBacall, Lauren | 171, 352, 851, 853-855, 861-863, 897\n\nBacharach, Burt | 331, 334\n\nBackyard concert | 630-632\n\nBacon, Kevin | 640\n\nBaez, Joan | 137\n\nBAFTA | 862\n\nBalanchine, George | 331, 332\n\nBaldwin, Alec | 795, 940\n\nBaldwin, James | 648\n\nBancroft, Anne | 109, 110, 112, 315\n\n“But Ray, as I only learned much later, had reservations about Anne Bancroft… And so did Jule. He was writing songs that required a singer with range, and he wasn’t sure Bancroft could handle them. And as he acknowledged after he had heard me sing, ‘In my head, I was really writing for Barbra.'”\n\nBanderas, Antonio | 940, 956-957\n\nBarbra Streisand Women’s Heart Center | 918\n\n“Barefoot in the Park” | 366\n\nBarr, Roseanne | 830\n\nBarry, John | 720\n\n“Barry Lyndon” | 545\n\nBartkowiak, Andrzej | 618, 660, 667, 853, 860, 935\n\nBaryshnikov, Mikhail | 603, 893\n\n“We shot it in 1984 in London, which was way ahead of America fashion-wise. I’d see these incredible-looking kids with Mohawk hairdos and dazzling makeup on the streets and ask, ‘Do you want to be in my video?’ I said the same thing to Mikhail Baryshnikov one night when he came over to the table in a Chinese restaurant where Richard and I were eating. Miraculously he said yes and played a role in one of my fantasies. As a child I wanted to be a ballet dancer, and who would be better than Misha to leap through a window, lift me up, and sweep me off my feet?”\n\nBashert | 103, 213, 394, 442, 961\n\nBasie, Count | 113\n\nBasin Street East | 132, 133, 175\n\nBasinger, Kim | 795\n\nBaskin, Richard | 307, 588, 602-603, 612, 614, 616, 650-651, 671-672, 685, 690, 764, 766, 771, 791, 802, 810, 856, 870, 883-884, 921\n\nBaskin-Robbins | 307\n\nBates, Kathy | 636,\n\n“Batman” | 472, 759\n\nBattle, Kathleen | 764\n\nBean, Orson | 68, 69, 74, 101\n\nThe Beatles | 150, 188, 398, 958\n\nBeaton, Cecil | 132, 175, 238, 304, 305, 308, 575\n\nBeatty, Warren, 37, 38, 285, 298, 359, 472, 480-481, 591, 680, 696, 749, 765, 828, 897\n\n“Warren and I go back a long way (back to summer stock) and there’s some water under that bridge. Recently, we were on the phone talking politics and who knows what else when he said, “I remember why we broke up.”\n\nI said, “When were we together?”\n\nThen I hung up and asked myself, Did I sleep with Warren? I kind of remember. I guess I did. Probably once.”\n\nBecker, Lee | 109\n\nThe Bee Gees | 499, 503\n\nBegelman, David | 540-541, 552, 576\n\nBegley Jr., Ed | 298\n\n“Behind the Green Door” | 316\n\nBeing called a “bitch” | 2, 284, 382\n\n“Being a kook” | 91, 111, 163, 172, 300, 675\n\nBelafonte, Harry | 284-285, 350, 352\n\nBelmondo, Jean-Paul | 93, 910\n\n“Bells Are Ringing” | 106\n\nBenny, Jack | 139, 789\n\nBening, Annette | 298, 765, 828\n\nBeresford, Bruce | 587\n\nBergdorf Goodman | 193, 194, 196\n\nBergman, Alan | 517-521, 524, 532, 536, 550, 587-589, 591, 594-595, 597, 602, 605, 651, 685, 720, 725, 739, 741, 763, 785, 789, 795, 810, 830, 859, 880, 883, 897-898, 915, 919, 942, 948-950, 953, 958\n\nBergman, Ingmar | 336-340, 561, 580, 587\n\n“Bergman understood the beauty of stillness. Over and over again, he man-aged to create so many quiet yet compelling moments. He had a profound sense of truth, and that’s what I respond to on-screen.”\n\nBergman, Ingrid | 183, 238, 263-264, 729\n\nBerle, Milton | 20, 139\n\nBerlin, Irving | 187, 920\n\nBerman, Shelley | 193\n\nBernhardt, Sarah | 45, 278, 282, 301, 311-312, 905, 906\n\nBernstein, Leonard | 103, 116, 190, 229, 350, 441, 616, 618, 626, 789\n\n“But when we were about to release [The Broadway Album], I didn’t know what kind of response it would get. The person whose opinion mattered so much to me was Leonard Bernstein’s, so I sent him a copy of the album. Here’s the note I received in return:\n\nDear Barbra,\n\nI love your voice, your style, your guts, your arrangements (Somewhere is something else!) and I love you for sending me the album. Putting It Together is putting it mild.\n\nThank you,\n\nLenny\n\nThat made me feel blessed.”\n\nBerry, Chuck | 764\n\nBertolucci, Bernardo | 290, 603\n\n“The Best Years of Our Lives” | 236\n\n“Betrayal” | 469\n\n“I couldn’t believe what I was looking at, and I don’t want to reread it now. I do know that Frank took great pleasure in ridiculing me and Jon, and our ‘$6 million home home.’ He twisted the facts, and he made up stories, saying that he had to persuade me to put the moment with Leon Russell into the script, and that he had to convince me to hire Bob Surtees . . . when it was exactly the other way around.\n\nI was furious and immediately called him up. ‘How could you lie like this?’\n\nWas he delusional?\n\n…But in the article, he told a different story… every anecdote was meant to paint him as the savior and Jon and me as fools. When I challenged him on it, he kept reiterating that the article was not for publication. And I made the mistake of believing him. I still didn’t realize that I was dealing with a pathological liar. And as I’ve said, I cannot deal with people who lie.”\n\nBeyoncé | 914-915\n\n“And when Beyoncé came out to sing ‘The Way We Were,’ I was thrilled. After her last note, in the midst of the applause, she looked up at me and said, ‘It’s an honor to sing for you, Miss Streisand.’ At the party afterward, she was so charming and complimentary, and I told her I felt the same way about her. She’s done such imaginative work in her music and her videos . . . she just knocks me out.”\n\nBigelow, Kathryn | 733\n\n“Birds flying around loose inside my home” | 478\n\n“The Birth of a Nation” | 840\n\nBisset, Jacqueline | 405\n\nBlair, Tony | 841, 931-932\n\nBlanchett, Cate | 924\n\nBlass, Bill | 191, 194\n\n“The Blob” | 94\n\nBloch-Bauer, Adele | 802\n\n“Blowjobs” | 668\n\nThe Blue Angel | 82, 92, 110, 116, 129\n\n“Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice” | 335\n\nBogart, Humphrey | 854\n\nBogdanovich, Peter | 341-347, 398, 795, 849, 958\n\nBogosian, Eric | 640\n\nBon Soir | 55-56, 59, 60, 61, 62, 64, 71, 75, 82, 101, 105, 106, 109, 115, 116, 117, 119, 123, 125, 138, 190, 193, 217, 731, 779, 962, 964\n\nBonaparte, Napoleon | 258\n\nBorder crossing | 532-533\n\nBotti, Chris | 929\n\nBourke-White, Margaret | 681, 924\n\nBoxer, Barbara | 819, 942\n\n“Boyz n the Hood” | 731\n\nBradley, Tom | 631\n\nBranagh, Kenneth | 643\n\nBrandeis, Louis | 907\n\nBrando, Marlon | 24, 49, 93, 138, 178, 234, 273, 283-298, 350, 559, 580, 746, 751, 789-790, 813, 855, 880\n\n“Breakfast at Tiffany’s” | 371\n\nBreaking royal protocol | 429\n\n“I didn’t like the feeling I got when I was standing in the receiving line waiting to meet the queen. I struggled with whether I should curtsy or not. After all, she wasn’t my queen. And the idea of curtsying to anyone felt demeaning. Then there were all these rules. According to protocol, you’re not supposed to speak until the queen speak to you. And women were required to wear gloves.\n\nHuh? That seemed like something out of another era. And if women were required to wear gloves, why not men?\n\nWhen Jon dared me to ask her, I said, ‘How much do you want to bet?’\n\nHe said, ‘A hundred.’\n\nAnd I thought, Why not? (This is probably why I got a D in conduct back at the yeshiva.)\n\nWhen the queen and I were finally face-to-face, I did do a kind of curtsy, and she said something complimentary (which of course I’ve forgotten).

I bought it in a thrift shop for ten dollars and thought it was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen.

They told me that would be a first for the magazine, and I thought, Well, no one will expect that. So I said okay, as long as I had photo approval. At the shoot they handed me the Playboy Bunny costume… basically a skimpy black bathing suit with a push-up bra. Let’s just say I had nothing like that in my closet. It was so different from my image and my own sense of self that it was almost disconcerting to put it on, but I have to admit it was also kind of fun, and quite flattering to my figure. But I didn’t like the symbolism of the outfit. After all, I was a feminist and I didn’t want to do anything that might be interpreted as a betrayal of the movement.

He walked in with two bodyguards, and then gave the guys a look and gestured with his head (like in the movies), which clearly meant ‘Scram.’ So the two of us were alone in my dressing room. I was a bit nervous to meet him, so I started putting polish on my nails, because I didn’t know what else to do. I’m not good at small talk, and I wasn’t a big Elvis fan at the time (I came to really love him later). My shyness was paralyzing. I have no memory of our conversation. I barely looked up. But at the same level as my eyes was a huge silver belt buckle and his belly button, because his suit jacket was open to the waist and he had no shirt on, just his bare chest. His thick head of hair was dyed jet-black, and I thought, Why would a young man dye his hair like that? He was only thirty-four.

She was warm and friendly, and it was fun to sit next to her in the balcony of the theater at Leicester Square, watching the film. When it ended, people started to applaud. The lights came up. I was told that the princess has to stand up first… that was royal protocol… but instead Diana was smiling and clapping along with everyone else and she whispered to me, ‘You must stand up.’\n\nI said, ‘Really?

Another time he came back, stole my little convertible, and checked into the Beverly Hills Hotel, saying that he was my husband, the king of Israel, and that I was his queen.”\n\nStanislavsky | 30-31\n\nStanley, Kim | 49\n\nStapleton, Maureen | 656\n\n“A Star is Born” (1954) | 26, 114, 141, 582, 825\n\n“A Star is Born” (1976) | 67, 332, 405, 407, 440, 508-509, 570, 684, 699, 756, 916, 917, 951, 953, 956\n\nStarbucks stock | 895\n\n“Starfucker” | 37\n\nStark, Frances | 108, 109, 112, 154, 234\n\nStark, Ray | 106, 108, 109, 111, 139, 140, 142, 143, 156, 157, 159, 163, 169, 170, 172, 182, 183, 186, 204, 206, 207, 221, 222, 225, 227, 233, 234, 236, 239, 240, 242, 252, 255, 256, 257, 313, 314, 315, 319, 335, 364, 365, 366, 367, 371, 389, 402, 403, 420, 422, 424, 427-428, 430-431, 535, 579, 599, 740, 822\n\nStarr, Ringo | 398\n\nSteele, Tommy | 220\n\nSteiger, Rod | 294\n\nStein, Gertrude | 648\n\nSteinem, Gloria | 352, 634\n\nStern, Bert | 175\n\nStevens, Kaye | 109\n\nStewart, Jimmy | 233\n\nStewart, Sandy | 118\n\nStiller, Ben | 645-646, 903\n\nStock trading | 894-896\n\n“While I was consumed with the state of the country, I had also developed another absorbing interest. As I wrote in my journal, “I’m addicted to the stock market . . . the risk and the reward. It gives me the drama I need for the day.” From about 1998 to 2000, I was trading Monday through Friday, from 6:30 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. (which proves my level of commitment, because I’m not a morning person). But somehow the siren song of the stock market penetrated my sleep.\n\nAt 6:25 my eyes would open wide, without an alarm. I’d get up, throw on my bathrobe, sit down at my new desk with a cup of hot chocolate, and start trading.”\n\nStone, Oliver | 730\n\nStoraro, Vittorio | 545-547, 561, 592, 603\n\nStorch, Larry | 56\n\n“La Strada” | 593\n\nStrasberg, Lee | 36, 37, 48, 49, 133, 176, 182, 431-433, 833\n\nStrasberg, Susan | 20, 30, 37\n\nStreep, Meryl | 586\n\n“A Streetcar Named Desire” | 813\n\nThe Streisand Effect | 906-907\n\n“Let me say this loud and clear. Contrary to the explanation on Wikipedia, I did not attempt to “suppress” a photograph of my house. My issue was never with the photo … it was only about the use of my name attached to the photo. To cut a long story short, when a wealthy businessman took it upon himself to photograph thousands of homes along the California coast and create a web- site in 2002, all the homes were identified only by longitude and latitude and not by the owners’ names . . . except for five celebrities, including me. Suddenly there was a photo on the internet with my house, my name, and the exact co- ordinates where I lived. That put the safety of my family and myself at risk. We had already experienced several incidents with intruders over the years. So I hope you can understand my concern.\n\nAnd this is what every description of the “Streisand effect” gets wrong. I wasn’t trying to remove the photo. All I asked was that this man please just treat me like everyone else and remove my name, for security reasons. But he refused.”\n\nStreisand, Emmanuel | 8, 9, 14, 31, 98, 171, 242, 290, 405, 461-462, 513-516, 521, 544-545, 565, 568, 573, 576, 577, 589, 594, 716, 744, 759-760, 763, 791, 802-803, 805, 834, 851, 875, 891-892, 930, 931, 933, 961, 962, 964-965\n\n“The Streisand method” | 615\n\nStreisand, Sheldon | 513-516, 594, 795, 825, 883\n\nStritch, Billy | 778\n\n“Stromboli” | 730\n\nStuart, Gilbert | 769\n\nStudent Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) | 284, 3"
