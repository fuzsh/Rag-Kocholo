        "text": "The West Wing (1999–2006) is an American serial political drama television series created by Aaron Sorkin that was originally broadcast on NBC. The series is set primarily in the West Wing of the White House, where the Oval Office and offices of presidential senior personnel are located, during the fictitious Democratic administration of President Josiah Bartlet.\n\nSeason 1 Season 2 Season 3 Season 4 Season 5 Season 6 Season 7 Pilot In the Shadow of Two Gunmen (1) Isaac and Ishmael 20 Hours in America (1) 7A WF 83429 NSF Thurmont The Ticket Post Hoc, Ergo Propter Hoc In the Shadow of Two Gunmen (2) Manchester (1) 20 Hours in America (2) The Dogs of War The Birnam Wood The Mommy Problem A Proportional Response The Midterms Manchester (2) College Kids Jefferson Lives Third-Day Story Message of the Week Five Votes Down In this White House Ways and Means The Red Mass Han Liftoff Mr. Frost The Crackpots & These Women And It's Surely To Their Credit On the Day Before Debate Camp Constituency of One The Hubbert Peak Here Today Mr. Willis of Ohio The Lame Duck Congress War Crimes Game On Disaster Relief The Dover Test The Al Smith Dinner The State Dinner The Portland Trip Gone Quiet Election Night Separation of Powers A Change is Gonna Come The Debate Enemies Shibboleth The Indians in the Lobby Process Stories Shutdown In the Room Undecideds The Short List Galileo The Women of Qumar Swiss Diplomacy Abu el Banat Impact Winter The Wedding In Excelsis Deo Noël Bartlet for America Arctic Radar The Stormy Present Faith Based Initiative Running Mates Lord John Marbury The Leadership Breakfast H.

Came off the line ten months ago. Carries a Sim-5 transponder tracking system. And you're telling me I can still flummox this thing with something I bought at Radio Shack?\n\nLeo: [on the phone with the New York Times] 17 across. Yes, 17 across is wrong... You're spelling his name wrong... What's my name? My name doesn't matter. I am just an ordinary citizen who relies on the Times crossword for stimulation. And I'm telling you that I met the man twice. And I recommended a pre-emptive Exocet missile strike against his air force, so I think I know how...\n\nC.J.: Leo.\n\nLeo: They hang up on me every time.\n\nC.J.: That's almost hard to believe.\n\nSam: Ms. O'Brien, I understand your feelings, but please believe me when I tell you that I'm a nice guy having a bad day. I just found out the Times is publishing a poll that says a considerable portion of Americans feel the White House has lost energy and focus. A perception that's not likely to be altered by the video footage of the President riding his bicycle into a tree. As we speak, the Coast Guard is fishing Cubans out of the Atlantic Ocean while the Governor of Florida wants to blockade the Port of Miami. A good friend of mine's about to get fired for going on television and making sense, and it turns out I accidentally slept with a prostitute last night. Now would you please, in the name of compassion, tell me which one of those kids is my boss's daughter?\n\nMallory: That would be me.\n\nSam: You.\n\nMallory: Yes.\n\nSam: Leo's daughter's fourth-grade class.\n\nMallory: Yes.\n\nSam: Well, this is bad on so many levels.\n\nJohn Van Dyke: The First Commandment says \"Honor thy father.\"\n\nToby: No, it doesn't!\n\nJosh Lyman: Toby—\n\nToby: It doesn't! [C.J. tries to stop him] No! If I'm gonna make you sit through this preposterous exercise, we're gonna get the names of the damn Commandments right!\n\nMary Marsh: Okay, here we go.\n\nToby: \"Honor thy father\" is the Third Commandment!\n\nVan Dyke: Then what's the First Commandment?\n\nBartlet: \"I am the Lord your God; thou shalt worship no other god before me.\" [enters the room, walking with a cane] Boy, those were the days, huh?\n\nVan Dyke: If our children can buy pornography on any street corner for five dollars, isn't that too high a price to pay for free speech?\n\nBartlet: No.\n\nVan Dyke: Really?\n\nBartlet: On the other hand, I do think that five dollars is too high a price to pay for pornography.\n\nC.J.: Why don’t we all sit down?\n\nBartlet: No. Let’s not, C.J. These people won’t be staying that long. May I have some coffee, Mr. Lewis? Al, how many times have I asked you to denounce the practices of a fringe group that calls itself The Lambs of God?\n\nCaldwell: Sir, it’s not up to me to—\n\nBartlet: Crap. It is up to you, Al. You know, my wife, Abbey, she never wants me to do anything while I’m upset. [a staffer hands him coffee] Thank you, Mr. Lewis. Twenty-eight years ago, I come home from a very bad day at the State House. I tell Abbey I’m going out for a drive. I get in the station wagon and put it in reverse and pull out of the garage full speed. [Leo and Sam appear in the doorway and quietly enter into the room.] Except I forgot to open the garage door. Abbey told me to not drive while I was upset, and she was right. She was right yesterday when she told me not to get on that damn bicycle while I was upset, but I did it anyway, and I guess I was just about as angry as I’ve ever been in my life. It seems my granddaughter, Annie, had given an interview in one of the teen magazines. And somewhere between movie stars and makeup tips, she talked about her feelings on a woman’s right to choose. Now Annie, all of 12, has always been precocious, but she’s got a good head on her shoulders, and I like it when she uses it. So, I couldn’t understand it when her mother called me in tears yesterday. I said, \"Elizabeth, what’s wrong?\" She said, \"It’s Annie.\" Now, I love my family, and I’ve read my Bible from cover to cover. So, I want you to tell me from what part of the Holy Scripture do you suppose the Lambs of God drew their Divine inspiration when they sent my 12-year-old granddaughter a Raggedy Ann doll with a knife stuck through its throat? [pause] You’ll denounce these people, Al. You’ll do it publicly. And until you do, you can all get your fat asses out of my White House. C.J., show these people out.\n\nMary Marsh: I believe we can find the door.\n\nBartlet: Find it now.\n\nLloyd Russell: [referring to his Presidential run, speaking to Mandy, who just drove her car onto a curb] It wasn't going to happen.\n\nMandy: You know what the worst part about this is?\n\nLloyd Russell: Well, I think you dinged up your suspension pretty good.\n\nMandy: No, Lloyd, it's the party they're having, right now, in the West Wing, at my expense.\n\nLloyd Russell: They're not having a party in the West Wing.\n\nMandy: I worked with these people for two and a half years. They like to win and they like to gloat.\n\nLloyd Russell: I'm sure you're wrong.\n\nMandy: I'm sure I'm not.\n\nLloyd Russell: There are very serious people working at the White House. A blow was struck for party unity today, there's no cause to gloat.\n\n[cut to the White House]\n\nJosh: Victory is mine, victory is mine. Great day in the morning, people, victory is mine.\n\nDonna: Morning Josh.\n\nJosh: I drink from the keg of glory, Donna. Bring me the finest muffins and bagels in all the land. [pumps his fists]\n\nDonna: It's going to be an unbearable day.\n\nToby: Mrs. Landingham, does the President have free time this morning?\n\nMrs. Landingham: The President has nothing but free time, Toby. Right now he's in the residence eating Cheerios and enjoying Regis and Kathie Lee. Should I get him for you?\n\nToby: Sarcasm's a disturbing thing coming from a woman of your age, Mrs. Landingham.\n\nMrs. Landingham: What age would that be, Toby?\n\nToby: ...Late twenties?\n\nMrs. Landingham: Atta boy.\n\nToby: Can I have a cookie?\n\nMrs. Landingham: No.\n\n[Sam walks in]\n\nMrs. Landingham: Good morning, Sam.\n\nSam: Good morning.\n\nMrs. Landingham: Have a cookie, Sam.\n\nC.J.: Sir, this may be a good time to talk about your sense of humor.\n\nBartlet: I've got an intelligence briefing, a security briefing, and a 90-minute budget meeting all scheduled for the same 45 minutes. You sure this is a good time to talk about my sense of humor?\n\nC.J.: No.\n\nBartlet: Me neither.\n\nC.J.: It's just that it's not the first time that it's happened.\n\nBartlet: I know.\n\nToby: We're talking about Texas, sir.\n\nBartlet: I know.\n\nC.J.: USA Today asks you why you don't spend more time campaigning in Texas and you say it's because you don't look good in funny hats.\n\nSam: It was big hats.\n\nC.J.: What difference does it make?\n\nBartlet: It makes a difference.\n\nC.J.: The point is we got whomped in Texas.\n\nJosh: We got whomped in Texas twice.\n\nC.J.: We got whomped in the primary and we got whomped in November.\n\nBartlet: I think I was there.\n\nC.J.: And it was avoidable. Sir.\n\nBartlet: C.J., on your tombstone it's gonna read 'Post hoc ergo propter hoc.'\n\nCJ: Okay, but none of my visitors are going to be able to understand my tombstone.\n\nBartlet: Twenty-seven lawyers in the room, anybody know 'post hoc, ergo propter hoc'? Josh?\n\nJosh: Ah, post, after hoc, ergo, therefore... After hoc, therefore something else hoc.\n\nBartlet: Thank you. Next? Leo.\n\nLeo: 'After it, therefore because of it'.\n\nBartlet: 'After it, therefore because of it'. It means one thing follows the other, therefore it was caused by the other. But it's not always true. In fact, it's hardly ever true. We did not lose Texas because of the hat joke. Do you know when we lost Texas?\n\nC.J.: When you learned to speak Latin?\n\nBartlet: Go figure.\n\nBartlet: What is that?\n\nMorris: It's a flu shot.\n\nBartlet: I don't need a flu shot.\n\nMorris: You do need a flu shot.\n\nBartlet: How do I know this isn't the start of a military coup?\n\nMorris: Sir?\n\nBartlet: I want the Secret Service in here right away.\n\nMorris: In the event of a military coup, sir, what makes you think the Secret Service is gonna be on your side?\n\nBartlet: Now that's a thought that's gonna fester.\n\nSam: About a week ago I accidentally slept with a prostitute.\n\nToby: Really?\n\nSam: Yes.\n\nToby: You accidentally slept with a prostitute.\n\nSam: Call girl.\n\nToby: Accidentally.\n\nSam: Yes.\n\nToby: I don't understand. Did you trip over something?\n\nJosh: A couple of things for you to bear in mind. First of all, he didn't know she was a call girl when he slept with her. He did not pay her money. He didn't participate in, have knowledge of, or witness anything illegal. Or for that matter, unethical, immoral, or suspect.\n\nC.J.: Okay. A couple things for you to bear in mind. None of that matters on Hard Copy!\n\nJosh: You're overreacting.\n\nC.J.: Am I?\n\nJosh: Yes.\n\nC.J.: As women are prone to do.\n\nJosh: That's not what I meant.\n\nC.J.: That's always what you mean.\n\nJosh: You know what, C.J., I really think I'm the best judge of what I mean, you paranoid Berkeley shiksa feminista! ...Whoa, that was way too far.\n\nC.J.: No, no. Well, I've got a staff meeting to go to and so do you, you elitist Harvard fascist missed-the-dean's-list-two-semesters-in-a-row Yankee jackass!\n\nJosh: Feel better getting that off your chest there, C.J.?\n\nC.J.: I'm a whole new woman.\n\nJosh: You look like a million bucks, by the way.\n\nC.J.: Don't try to make up with me.\n\nSam: [reading a newspaper article, quoting a congressman] \"Folks down here are patriotic, fiercely patriotic. The President better not be planning on making any visits to this base. If he does, he may not get out alive.\"\n\nToby: He said that? Sitting there with military officers?\n\nJosh: Don't take the bait.\n\nToby: Josh.\n\nJosh: Don't take the bait!\n\nToby: You'd better believe I'm going to take the bait.\n\nLeo: There ought to be a law against it.\n\nJosh: Why'd you get him started?\n\n[Leo shrugs]\n\nToby: There is a law against it! How about threatening the life of the President? He was talking to other people: how about conspiracy? They were military officers, how about treason? That was a member of our own party, Leo. That was a Democrat who said that!\n\nLeo: It's bad, I know.\n\nToby: That's it?\n\nLeo: What are you going to do?\n\nToby: Have the Justice Department bring him in pending felony charges.\n\nJosh: Toby's right. What's the good of being in power if you're not going to haul your enemies in for questioning?\n\nToby: We're really not gonna do anything about this?\n\nLeo: Yeah, cause what we really need to do is arrest people for being mean to the President.\n\nToby: There is no law. There is no decency.\n\nJosh: He’s just getting that now.\n\nBartlet: What's the virtue of the proportional response?\n\nAdmiral Fitzwallace: I'm sorry?\n\nBartlet: What is the virtue of a proportional response? Why's it good? They hit an airplane, so we hit a transmitter, right? That's a proportional response.\n\nAdmiral Fitzwallace: Sir, in the case of Pericles 1 --\n\nBartlet: [talking over him] They hit a barracks, so we hit two transmitters.\n\nAdmiral Fitzwallace: That's roughly it, yes, sir.\n\nBartlet: This is what we do. I mean, this is what we do.\n\nLeo: Yes, sir, it's what we do. It's what we've always done.\n\nBartlet: Well, if it's what we do, if it's what we've always done, don't they know we're going to do it?\n\nLeo: Sir, if you'd turn your attention to Pericles 1 --\n\nBartlet: I have turned my attention to Pericles 1. It's two ammo dumps, an abandoned railroad bridge and a Syrian intelligence agency.\n\nAdmiral Fitzwallace: Those are four highly-rated targets, sir.\n\nBartlet: But they know we're gonna do that. They know we're gonna do that! Those areas have been abandoned for three days now. We know that from the satellite, right? We have the intelligence. [over Leo's attempt to speak up] They did that, so we did this. It's the cost of doing business. It's been factored in, right?\n\nLeo: Mr. President --\n\nBartlet: Am I right, or am I missing something here?\n\nAdmiral Fitzwallace: No, sir. You're right, sir.\n\nBartlet: Then I ask again, what is the virtue of a proportional response?\n\nAdmiral Fitzwallace: It isn't virtuous, Mr. President. It's all there is, sir.\n\nBartlet: It is not all there is.\n\nLeo: Sir, Admiral Fitzwallace --\n\nAdmiral Fitzwallace: Excuse me, Leo...pardon me, Mr. President, just what else is there?\n\nBartlet: The disproportional response. Let the word ring forth, from this time and this place, gentlemen, you kill an American, any American, we don't come back with a proportional response. We come back with total disaster! [He bangs the table]\n\nGeneral: Are you suggesting that we carpet-bomb Damascus?\n\nBartlet: I am suggesting, General, that you, and Admiral Fitzwallace, and Secretary Hutchinson, and the rest of the National Security Team take the next sixty minutes and put together an American response scenario that doesn't make me think we're just docking somebody's damn allowance!\n\nBartlet: What do you need, Leo?\n\nLeo: Well, you've gone through everyone who works for you and everyone who's married to you. I didn't know who else you could get mad at, so I was afraid the American people might be next. Oh, by the way, when we're done here you're sending Abby some flowers.\n\nBartlet: [nods] Did you know that two thousand years ago a Roman citizen could walk across the face of the known world free of the fear of molestation? He could walk across the Earth unharmed, cloaked only in the protection of the words civis Romanus -- I am a Roman citizen. So great was the retribution of Rome, universally understood as certain, should any harm befall even one of its citizens. Where was Morris's protection, or anybody else on that airplane? Where was the retribution for the families, and where is the warning to the rest of the world that Americans shall walk this Earth unharmed, lest the clenched fist of the most mighty military force in the history of mankind comes crashing down on your house?! In other words, Leo, what the hell are we doing here?!\n\nLeo: We are behaving the way a superpower ought to behave.\n\nBartlet: Well, our behavior has produced some crappy results; in fact, I'm not a hundred per cent sure it hasn't induced it.\n\nLeo: What are you talking about?\n\nBartlet: I'm talking about two hundred and eighty-six American marines in Beirut, I'm talking about Somalia, I'm talking about Nairobi-\n\nLeo: And you think ratcheting up the body count's gonna act as a deterrent?\n\nBartlet: You're damn right I-\n\nLeo: Oh, then you are just as stupid as these guys who think capital punishment is going to be a deterrent for drug kingpins. As if drug kingpins didn't live their day to day lives under the possibility of execution, and their executions are a lot less dainty than ours and tend to take place without the bother and expense of due process. So, my friend, if you want to start using American military strength as the arm of the Lord, you can do that. We're the only superpower left. You can conquer the world, like Charlemagne! But you better be prepared to kill everyone. And you better start with me, because I will raise up an army against you and I will beat you!\n\nBartlet: [pause] He had a ten-day old baby at home.\n\nLeo: I know.\n\nBartlet: We are doing nothing.\n\nLeo: We are not doing nothing.\n\nBartlet: We're destroying-\n\nLeo: Four high-rated military targets!\n\nBartlet And this is good?\n\nLeo: Of course it's not good. There is no good. It's what there is! It's how you behave if you're the most powerful nation in the world. It's proportional, it's reasonable, it's responsible, it's merciful! It's not nothing. Four high-rated military targets.\n\nBartlet: Which they'll rebuild again in six months.\n\nLeo: Then we'll blow 'em up again in six months! We're getting really good at it. [pause] It's what our fathers taught us.\n\nBartlet: [nods] Why didn't you say so? [pause, sitting down] Oh, man, Leo...when I think of all the work you put in to get me to run, when I think of all the work you did to get me elected...I could pummel your ass with a baseball bat.\n\n[Leo and Bartlet laugh]\n\nJosh: This was just, I think, a bad day. I have to tell you, he's ordinarily an extremely kind man, placing a very high premium on civility. Today...it's just been a very difficult few days for him.\n\nCharlie: I think I should probably go.\n\n[Bartlet comes in]\n\nBartlet: Excuse me, Charlie? Can I see you inside, please? Come on, it's okay.\n\n[Charlie walks toward him hesitantly and Bartlet sticks out his hand]\n\nBartlet: I'm Jed Bartlet.\n\nCharlie: I'm Charles Young, sir.\n\nBartlet: But you prefer Charlie, right? Listen, Leo McGarry filled me in on the situation with your mother. I'm so very sorry. I hope you don't mind, but I took the liberty of calling Tom Connolly, the FBI Director, and we had the computer spit out some quick information. Your mother was killed by a Western .38 revolver firing KTWs, or what are known as cop-killer bullets. Now, we have not had a whole lot of success yet in banning that weapon and those bullets off the streets, but we're planning on taking a big whack at it when Congress comes back from recess. So, what do you say? You want to come help us out?\n\nCharlie: [smiling] Yes, sir, I do.\n\nBartlet: Thank you, Charlie. [shakes his hand]\n\n...\n\nCharlie: I've never felt like this before.\n\nJosh: It doesn't go away.\n\nJosh: Forgive my bluntness, and I say this with all due respect, Congressman, but vote yes, or you're not even going to be on the ballot two years from now.\n\nKatzenmoyer: How do you figure?\n\nJosh: You're going to lose in the primary.\n\nKatzenmoyer: There's no Democrat running against me.\n\nJosh: Sure there is.\n\nKatzenmoyer: Who?\n\nJosh: Whomever we pick.\n\nKatzenmoyer: You're bluffing.\n\nJosh: Okay.\n\nKatzenmoyer: I'm in your own party!\n\nJosh: Doesn't seem to be doing us much good now, does it?\n\nKatzenmoyer: Against an incumbent Democrat. You'll go to the press and endorse a challenger?\n\nJosh: No sir. We're going to do it in person. See, you won with fifty-two percent, but the President took your district with fifty-nine. And I think it's high time we come back and say thanks. Do you have any idea how much noise Air Force One makes when it lands in Eau Claire, Wisconsin? We're going to have a party, Congressman. You should come, it's gonna be great. And when the watermelon's done, right in town square, right in the band gazebo... You guys got a band gazebo?\n\nKatzenmoyer: Josh...\n\nJosh: Doesn't matter, we'll build one. Right in the band gazebo, that's where the President is going to drape his arm around the shoulder of some assistant DA we like. And you should have your camera with you. You should get a picture of that. 'Cause that's gonna be the moment you're finished in Democratic politics. President Bartlet's a good man. He's got a good heart. He doesn't hold a grudge. That's what he pays me for.\n\nReporter: I'm curious about the President's farm in Manchester. The property value increased $750,000. What's that due to?\n\nC.J.: Secret Service improvements.\n\nReporter: Can you go into detail, please?\n\nC.J.: The property now includes a helipad and the ability to run a global war from the sun porch.\n\nJosh: You know, I realize that as an adult not everyone shares my view of the world, and with an issue as hot as gun control I'm prepared to accept a lot of different points of view as being perfectly valid, but we can all get together on the grenade launcher, right?\n\nToby: There's literally no one in the world that I don't hate right now.\n\nBartlet: [on pain medication] Hey!\n\nLeo: Mr. President. I thought you were staying in bed.\n\nBartlet: Oh, I feel fine.\n\nLeo: Uh... Maybe you should get back to the residence.\n\nBartlet: Hmm?\n\nLeo: I said, maybe you should get back to the residence. Maybe you should lie down.\n\nBartlet: Absolutely no need. I'm fine. What's going on here?\n\nSam: Nothing you need to concern yourself with, Mr. President. Merely a perception issue regarding Toby and the financial disclosure.\n\nBartlet: Well, I like to roll up my sleeves and, you know ... get involved.\n\nC.J.: Mr. President. Did you by any chance take your back pills?\n\nBartlet: I don't mind telling you C.J. I was in a little pain there.\n\nLeo: Which did you take, sir, the Vicodin or the Percocet?\n\nBartlet: I wasn't supposed to take 'em both?\n\nC.J.: Okay, Mr. President, we're going to have someone take you back to bed.\n\nBartlet: No, no, no. Sit, sit, sit. One of you's got a problem, and I'm here to help. You guys are like family. You've always been there for me. You've always been loyal, honest, hard-working good people, and I love you all very much, and I don't say that often enough. [to Sam] So, tell me what the problem is, Toby.\n\nSam: I'm Sam, sir.\n\nBartlet: Sam, of course you are.\n\nToby: Sir, the situation basically is this. I arranged for a friend to testify to Commerce on Internet stocks, while simultaneously, but unrelated to that, bought a technology issue which, partly due to my friend's testimony, shot through the roof.\n\nBartlet: Toby. Toby, Toby, Toby. Toby's a nice name, don't you think?\n\nToby: Can we possibly do this meeting at another time?\n\nBartlet: No, no, no, I know my body. I know my muscles aren't, you know, but my mind is sharp. I can focus. I'm focused. You all know that about me. Here's what I think we ought to do. [beat] Was I just saying something?\n\nToby: [while playing basketball] It's not so much that you cheat sir, it's how brazenly bad you are at it.\n\nBartlet: I beg your pardon! When have I ever cheated?\n\nToby: How about in Florida, playing mixed doubles with me and C.J., you tried to tell us your partner worked at the American Consulate in Vienna.\n\nBartlet: She did.\n\nToby: It was Steffi Graf, sir!\n\nBartlet: I'll admit the woman bore a striking resemblance to her.\n\nToby: You crazy lunatic! You think I'm not going to recognize Steffi Graf when she's serving a tennis ball at me?!\n\n...\n\nToby: Not so fast.\n\nBartlet: What's the problem?\n\nToby: Mr. Grant, your name sounds awfully familiar... Before you joined up with the President's Council on Physical Fitness, a council, I might add, the President would\n\ndo well to avail himself of... Is it possible, that you played some organized ball?\n\nGrant: Yeah, I used to play a little with my friends.\n\nToby: And where was that?\n\nGrant: I'm sorry?\n\nToby: Where would that be?\n\nGrant: Duke.\n\n[Toby and Josh laugh out loud]\n\nToby: This guy was in the Final Four!\n\nLeo: Andrew Jackson, in the main foyer of his White House had a big block of cheese.\n\nToby: Huh.\n\nLeo: I am making a mental list of those who are snickering, and even as I speak, I am preparing appropriate retribution. The block of cheese was huge - over two tons. And it was there for any and all who might be hungry.\n\nToby: Leo, wouldn't this time be better spent plotting a war against a country that can't possibly defend itself against us?\n\nLeo: We can do that later, Toby. Right now, I'm talking about President Andrew Jackson.\n\nSam Actually, right now, you're talking about a big block of cheese.\n\nLeo: And Sam goes on my list!\n\nSam: What about Toby?\n\nLeo: I'm unpredictable. Jackson wanted the White House to belong to the people, so from time to time, he opened his doors to those who wished an audience.\n\nMandy: And then he locked the doors behind them and made them eat two tons of cheese.\n\nLeo: It is in that spirit...\n\nSam: Hang on. Mandy doesn't go on the list?\n\nLeo: Mandy's new.\n\nSam: So it's just me... on the list?\n\nLeo: Yes. It is in the spirit of Andrew Jackson that I, from time to time, ask senior staff to have face-to-face meetings with those people representing organizations who have a difficult time getting our attention. I know the more jaded among you, see this as something rather beneath you. But I assure you that listening to the voices of passionate Americans is beneath no one, and surely not the peoples' servants.\n\nJosh: [walks in with C.J.] Sorry, we're late. Is it \"Total Crackpot Day\" again?\n\nLeo: Yes, it is.\n\nSam: And let us please note that Josh does not go on the list.\n\nBartlet: Hey, everybody, listen up - Zoey's down from Hanover and I'm making chili for everyone tonight!\n\n[Everyone looks horrified]\n\nJosh: Oh God...\n\nVarious: [With a noticeable lack of enthusiasm] Great! Great!\n\nBartlet: [Put out] Okay, you know what? Let's do this. Everybody look down at the big seal in the middle of my carpet. [Everyone looks down at the Presidential seal] Now look back up at me. [They do so] Zoey's down from Hanover and I'm making chili for everyone tonight!\n\nEveryone: [With more convincing forced enthusiasm] That's great! I love chili! Terrific!\n\nBartlet: There! You see how benevolent I can be when everybody just does what I tell them to do?\n\n[Josh is in his office, with Schubert's \"Ave Maria\" playing on his boombox]\n\nJosh: C.J., an NSC staffer gave me a card with instructions on it for what I'm supposed to do in the event of a nuclear attack. They want me up in the plane or down in a bunker. They don't want you... or Sam, or Toby, for that matter. I didn't want to be friends with you and have you not know.\n\nC.J.: [surprised] Josh, have you been upset about this?\n\nJosh: Yes.\n\nC.J.: You're very sweet sometimes. You really are.\n\nJosh: C.J...\n\nC.J.: Of course they don't want me, Josh! I'm a press secretary. I don't think they're going to be issuing a whole lot of releases. Sam and Toby are communications and my guess is that speech writing won't be a priority either. Come, have some fun. [starts to leave]\n\nJosh: [points at his boombox] This is a beautiful piece of music. Do you know this?\n\nC.J.: ...I'm Catholic.\n\nJosh: Hang on. Listen. Listen. [turns up his boombox at the words \"O Jungfrau, sieh der Jungfrau Sorgen\"] There, right there. It's... miraculous. [beat] Schubert was crazy, you know.\n\nC.J.: [nods] Yes.\n\nJosh: Do you think you have to be crazy to create something powerful?\n\nC.J.: Josh, the Cold War is over. There's not going to be a nuclear–\n\nJosh: God, C.J. It's not going to be like that. It's not gonna be the red phone and nuclear bombs.\n\nC.J.: What's it going to be?\n\nJosh: It's going to be this! It's going to be something like this. Smallpox has been gone for fifty years. No one has an acquired immunity. Flies through the air. You get it, you carry a ten-foot cloud around with you. One in three people die. If 100 people in New York City got it, you'd have to encircle them with 100 million vaccinated people to contain it. Do you know how many doses of smallpox vaccines exist in the country? Seven! If 100 people in New York City get it, there's gonna be a global medical emergency that's gonna make HIV look like cold and flu season. That's how it's gonna be, a little test tube with a... a rubber cap that's deteriorating... a guy steps out of Times Square station, [imitates a smashing noise]. smashes it on the sidewalk... there is a world war right there.\n\nC.J.: We'll make more vaccine.\n\nJosh: You better hurry, 'cause I'm the only one with one of these cards.\n\nBartlet: I understand that today was another one of Leo's 'big block of cheese' days! You all start out so cynical, but it never fails. By the end of the day, there's always one or two converts, right? And today was no exception. C.J. Cregg is gonna be up all night writing a position paper for the interior department on the necessity of wildlife protection. [C.J. laughs] C.J., I don't mind the cost of this wolves-only highway. It's the segregation. The ACLU is gonna file a petition on behalf of some reindeer and then we're all screwed. [Everyone laughs] Sam Seaborn had a guy who spotted a UFO today, am I right? Sam laughed him out of his office, but you've been thinking about it ever since. But you can rest assured, Sam. It was not a spaceship from another planet, just another time -- a long since abandoned Soviet satellite. One of its booster rockets didn't fire and it couldn't escape Earth's orbit. A sad reminder of the time when two powerful nations challenged each other and then boldly raced into outer space. What will be the next thing that challenges us, Toby? That makes us go farther and work harder? You know that when smallpox was eradicated, it was considered the single greatest humanitarian achievement of this century? Surely, we can do it again, as we did in the time when our eyes looked towards the heavens, and with outstretched fingers we touched the face of God. Here's to absent friends and the ones that are here now. Cheers.\n\nSam: C.J., we've been working on this commerce bill for three weeks, I hear you talk about the census all the time.\n\nC.J.: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nSam: Well... I don't understand. How could you-\n\nC.J.: I've been faking it.\n\nSam: You've been faking it?\n\nC.J.: I've been playing it fast and loose there's no doubt about it, but sitting in on some of the meetings we've been having, and reading the briefing book last night, I have to say that the census is starting to sound to me like it's, well, important.\n\nSam: Ah-hah.\n\nC.J.: And, I've come to the realization that if I'm gonna be talking about it all week, it's probably best that I understand what I'm saying.\n\nSam: When?\n\nC.J.: When what?\n\nSam: When did you come to this realization?\n\nC.J.: About an hour ago.\n\nSam: Okay. Let's... I tell you what, let's forget the fact that you're coming a little late to the party and embrace the fact that you showed up at all.\n\nC.J.: That's what I say.\n\nJosh: Sam, I'm taking Charlie for a beer tonight before the vote. Zoey and Mallory are coming.\n\nSam: Sounds good.\n\nC.J.: I like beer.\n\nJosh: If you want to come, I guess that'd be okay.\n\nC.J.: Why, Josh, you've swept me off my feet.\n\nCharlie: [at a Georgetown bar] Is everything all right, Zoey?\n\nGuy 2: Hey. He just called her Zoey.\n\nCharlie: Come on, let's go back to the table.\n\nGuy 1: Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. What's up Sammy?\n\nCharlie: Zoey?\n\n[Zoey moves towards Charlie and the guys block her]\n\nGuy 1: Excuse me. Excuse me. We're just trying to buy the girl a drink, man.\n\nCharlie: She's 19 years old man. You'd have to take her to Maryland.\n\nGuy 3: Check out Super Fly.\n\nZoey: Hey!\n\nCharlie: Let's go.\n\nGuy 1: No. Why don't you go? Alright?\n\nCharlie: Look guys. You don't know who this is. You don't want any trouble. Just be cool, alright?\n\nGuy 1: Be cool.\n\nCharlie: Yeah. I'm just saying, I'm looking out for you.\n\nGuy 1 : I understand what you're saying. You just want me to be cool, alright?\n\nCharlie: Can I buy you guys a round?\n\nGuy 3: Like LL Cool J man, like Ice-T.\n\nGuy 2: Ice cube, Ice tray man.\n\n...\n\nGuy 1: Why don't you do some of that hip-hop for us G-Funk?\n\nGuy 2: Dr. Huffy Puffy dread man, Dr Dolittle Man?\n\nCharlie: Would you let us by please?\n\nGuy 1: No. What are you doing here with this girl? Huh? Huh? Cause you know what, to me you look to be Dr. Faggot!\n\nSam: [coming up from behind] Hey! What the hell is going on around here?\n\nGuy 1: Who the hell are you?\n\nSam: Kiss my ass. Zoey?\n\nZoey: I'm fine.\n\nGuy 1: Kiss your what, Fairy Poppins?\n\nSam: Charlie?\n\nCharlie: Everything's fine.\n\nGuy 1: Hey, you want to go?\n\nSam: What?\n\nGuy 1: You want to go? Let's do it. Right now. Come on.\n\nJosh: [coming up from behind Charlie] How's everybody doin'?\n\nGuy 1: Oh good, more fairy boys.\n\nJosh: Excuse me?\n\nGuy 1: I said, more fairy boys.\n\nJosh: Oh, this is too good to be true.\n\n[Mallory and C.J. come up behind Josh and Sam]\n\nGuy 2: [indicating Josh] Hey, I recognize this guy. [indicating Zoey] And she looks familiar too.\n\nJosh: [Pressing Zoey's panic button] Yeah. You guys don't realize it, but you're having a pretty bad night.\n\nGuy 1: [Sarcastic and aggressive] Oh really - and who's gonna give it to us, huh?\n\n[The door slams open and Secret Service agents burst in]\n\nAgent: Federal agents!\n\n[Josh and Sam raise their arms and point at the three guys]\n\nSam and Josh: Right here!\n\n[The agents grab the startled and protesting guys and force them head-first onto the bar whilst one grabs Zoey and guides her out protectively]\n\nAgent: Shut up! I swear to God I'll blow your head off. Everybody stand back.\n\nGuy 1: [to Charlie] Hey, I ain't done with you, Sammy.\n\nCharlie: My name is Charlie Young, jackass. And if that bulge in your pocket's an 8-ball of blow, you'll be spending Spring Break in a federal prison. [to Josh] Now I'm having a good time.\n\nBartlet: The Secret Service...\n\nZoey: The Secret Service should worry about you getting shot!\n\nBartlet: They are worried about me getting shot. I'm worried about me getting shot! But that is nothing compared to how terrified we are of you. You scare the hell out of the Secret Service, Zoey, and you scare the hell out of me, too. My getting killed would be bad enough, but that is not the nightmare scenario. The nightmare scenario, sweetheart, is you getting kidnapped. You go out to a bar or a party in some club and you get up to go to the restroom. Somebody comes up from behind, puts their hand across your mouth and whisks you out the back door. You're so petrified you don't even notice the bodies of two Secret Service agents lying on the ground with bullet holes in their heads. Then you're whisked away in a car. It's a big party with lots of noise and lots of people coming and going and it's a half hour before someone says, \"Hey, where's Zoey?\" Another fifteen minutes before the first phone call. It's another hour and a half before anyone even thinks to shut down all the airports! And now we're off to the races! You're tied to a chair in a cargo shack somewhere in the middle of Uganda and I am told that I have seventy-two hours to get Israel to free four hundred and sixty terrorist prisoners. So I'm on the phone, pleading with Binyamin and he's saying \"I'm sorry Mr. President, but Israel simply does not negotiate with terrorists, period! It's the only way we can survive.\" So now we got a new problem, because this country no longer has a commander-in-chief but has a father who's out of his mind because his little girl is in a shack somewhere in Uganda with a gun to her head! Do you get it?!\n\n[In response to Josh's earlier speech to Donna about why the government does not issue refund checks for each person's portion of the budget surplus.]\n\nJosh: Donna? How much were the sandwiches?\n\nDonna: $12.95\n\nJosh: I gave you a twenty.\n\nDonna: Yes, as it turns out, actually, you gave me more money than I needed to buy what you asked for. However, knowing you, as I do, I'm afraid I can't trust you to spend the change wisely. I've decided to invest it for you.\n\nJosh: That was nice. That was a little parable.\n\nDonna: I want my money back.\n\nDonna: I’m not wild about this whole Indonesian thing.\n\nJosh: What’s the problem?\n\nDonna: I’ve been doing some reading on my own.\n\nJosh: I wish you wouldn’t do that.\n\nDonna: Why?\n\nJosh: Because you tend to cull some bizarre factoid from a less than reputable source and then you blow it all out of proportion.\n\nDonna: I do not.\n\nJosh: Donna...\n\nDonna: I just thought you might like to know that in certain parts of Indonesia, they summarily execute people they suspect of being sorcerers.\n\nJosh: What?\n\nDonna: I read it.\n\nJosh: They... summarily execute people they suspect of being sorcerers?\n\nDonna: They behead them.\n\nJosh: Sorcerers.\n\nDonna: Gangs of roving people. Beheading those they suspect of being sorcerers. You know with... what’s that thing that Death carries?\n\nJosh: A scythe.\n\nDonna: They’re doing it with a scythe.\n\nJosh: Well, thanks for the head’s up.\n\nDonna: I thought you might like to know who’s coming over for dinner.\n\nJosh: You bet.\n\nHarry: Mr. President?\n\nC.J.: No questions right now, Harry.\n\nHarry: A short one.\n\nBartlet: She’s not worried about the length of your question, she’s worried about the length of my response.\n\nMandy: It really bugs you that the President listens to me sometimes.\n\nJosh: Yes, but you shouldn’t take it personally. It bugs me when the President listens to anyone who isn’t me.\n\nMandy: What about a negotiator?\n\nMilitary officer: Negotiate what?\n\nMandy: A peaceful settlement.\n\nJosh: This is a standoff with federal officers. A peaceful settlement is \"put your guns down, you’re under arrest.\"\n\nMandy: I think it would be wise if we demonstrated that we exhausted every possible peaceful solution before we got all Ramboed up.\n\nJosh: I don’t think it’s unreasonably macho for the White House to be aggressive in preserving democracy.\n\nMandy: Let me tell you something. Ultimately, it is not the nuts that are the greatest threat to democracy, as history has shown us over and over and over again, the greatest threat to democracy is the unbridled power of the state over its citizens. Which, by the way, that power is always unleashed in the name of preservation.\n\nJosh: This isn’t abstract, Mandy. This isn’t a theoretical problem. The FBI says come out with your hands up, you come out with your hands up. At which point, you’re free to avail yourself of the entire justice system.\n\nMandy: Do you really believe that? Or are you just pissed off because I got into the game?\n\nBartlet: Time’s up.\n\nLittle: Actually, if I may, Mr. President. I didn’t get my full five minutes.\n\nBartlet: Yes, I know. But I got tired of listening to you. Now you listen to me. I have a Nobel Prize in Economics and I’m here to tell you that none of you know what the hell you’re talking about. At 12:01 am, I’m using my executive power to nationalize the trucking industry.\n\nLittle: You can’t do that, Mr. President...\n\nBartlet: Fourteen White House lawyers disagree. Truman did it in ‘52 with the coal mines.\n\nLittle: And it was struck down by the Supreme Court.\n\nBartlet: In 50 years. There’s a new bench and I’ll take my chances. As for Labor, I am calling Congress into Emergency Session to grant me the authority to draft the truckers into military service. [Russo and the Truckers Union delegates look dumbfounded] You’re going to love our food. Nice talking to you folks. If this isn’t settled in 47 minutes, don’t worry. We know where to find you.\n\nBartlet: Yellowstone, established by an act signed by Ulysses S. Grant was the nation's first national park - March 1, 1872.\n\nJosh: [stands] It's getting late, sir. I was wondering, are we through for the evening?\n\nBartlet: [smiling] Well, we're through with work, Josh, but this part's fun.\n\nJosh: What part, sir?\n\nBartlet: The part where I get you to sit down, and teach you a little something.\n\nJosh: [sits] Ah.\n\nBartlet: Yeah.\n\nJosh: You're not tired, sir?\n\nBartlet: No.\n\nJosh: Perhaps, if you get into bed and...\n\nBartlet: I'm a national park buff. I bet you didn't know that about me.\n\nJosh: Well, I didn't know that about you, sir, but I'm certainly not surprised.\n\nBartlet: Why is that?\n\nJosh: You're... quite a nerd, Mr. President.\n\nBartlet: Really?\n\nJosh: Yes, sir.\n\nBartlet: I assume that was said with all due respect.\n\nJosh: Yes, sir.\n\nBartlet: Is it nerd-like to know that Everglades National Park is the largest remaining subtropical wilderness in the continental United States, and has extensive mangrove forests?\n\nJosh: Just a little bit. Yes, sir.\n\nBartlet: There are 54 national parks in the country, Josh.\n\nJosh: Please tell me you haven't been to all of them.\n\nBartlet: I have been to all of them. I should show you my slide collection.\n\nJosh: Oh, would you?\n\nBartlet: [counting on his fingers] Grand Canyon, Bryce Canyon, Badlands, Capitol Reef, Acadia, which is so often overlooked...\n\nJosh: You should certainly feel free to keep talking, but I need to go home so I could be back in my office in... four hours.\n\nBartlet: Dry Tortugas...\n\nJosh: See, the thing is, I can't leave without your permission.\n\nBartlet: Petrified Forest, North Cascades, Joshua Tree, Shenandoah National Park, right here in Virginia! [bangs hand on couch] We should organize a staff field-trip to Shenandoah. I could even act as the guide. What do you think?\n\nJosh: [Under his breath] Good a place as any to dump your body.\n\nBartlet: What was that?\n\nJosh: ...Did I say that out loud?\n\nBartlet: See, and I was gonna let you go home.\n\nJosh: [Sinking feeling] ...But instead?\n\nBartlet: We're gonna talk about Yosemite.\n\nBartlet: Actually, I find these Cabinet meetings to be a fairly mind-numbing experience, but Leo assures me they are Constitutionally required, so let's get it over with.\n\nToby: All right... It couldn't have gone far, right?\n\nSam: No.\n\nToby: Somewhere in this building... is our talent.\n\nSam: Yes.\n\nSam: You're asking me out on a date.\n\nMallory: No, I'm asking you to accompany me to see an internationally renowned opera company perform a work indigenous to its culture.\n\nSam: Right, and in what way will it distinguish itself from a date?\n\nMallory: There will be, under no circumstances, sex for you at the end of the evening.\n\nSam: [shrugs] Okay.\n\nMallory: So what do you say?\n\nSam: Well, like most people I'm an absolute nut for Chinese opera. The Chinese being known the world over for their soaring and romantic melodies, and what with your guarantee that there won’t be sex, I don’t see how I could say no.\n\nHoynes: What did I ever do to you? Where, in our past, what did I do to make you treat me this way?\n\nBartlet: John...\n\nHoynes: What did I ever do except deliver the South?\n\nBartlet: Really?\n\nHoynes: Yeah.\n\nBartlet: You shouldn't have made me beg, John. I was asking you to be Vice President.\n\nHoynes: Due respect, Mr. President, you had just kicked my ass in the primary. I'm 15 years younger than you are and I have my career to think of.\n\nBartlet: Then don’t stand there and ask the question, John. It weakened me right out of the gate. You shouldn’t have made me beg.\n\nLeo: One in three?\n\nC.J.: Yes.\n\nLeo: He said one in three White House staffers are on drugs?\n\nC.J.: Yes.\n\nLeo: Where does he get these stats?\n\nC.J.: Leo-\n\nLeo: I mean where does he pull them from?\n\nC.J.: Out of the clear blue sky, but that doesn’t matter!\n\nLeo: [to Margaret] Is somebody bringing me a tape of this?\n\nMargaret: They're getting it. [leaves]\n\nMandy: This isn’t happening to me.\n\nLeo: Nothing’s happening. Stay cool.\n\nSam: [walks in] Is it possible for Peter Lillianfield to be a bigger jackass? You think if he tried hard, there’s room for him to be a slightly bigger horse's ass than he’s being right now?\n\nC.J.: At some point you hit your head on the ceiling, don’t you?\n\nSam: I think there’s unexplored potential.\n\nJosh: [enters] ‘Sup.\n\nMandy: Josh.\n\nJosh: Five White House staffers in the room. I would like to say to the 1.6 of you who are stoned right now that it’s time to share.\n\nSam: In 1787, there was a sizable block of delegates who were initially opposed to the Bill of Rights. This is what a member of the Georgia delegation had to say by way of opposition; 'If we list a set of rights, some fools in the future are going to claim that people are entitled only to those rights enumerated and no others.' So the Framers knew–\n\nHarrison: Were you just calling me a fool, Mr. Seaborn?\n\nSam: I wasn't calling you a fool, sir. The brand new state of Georgia was.\n\nSam: It's not just about abortion, it's about the next 20 years. Twenties and Thirties it was the role of government, Fifties and Sixties it was civil rights. The next two decades it's gonna be privacy. I'm talking about the Internet. I'm talking about cell phones. I'm talking about health records and who's gay and who's not. And moreover, in a country born on the will to be free, what could be more fundamental than this?\n\nBartlet: Did you have a drink yesterday?\n\nLeo: No, sir.\n\nBartlet: Do you plan to have a drink today?\n\nLeo: No, sir.\n\nBartlet: That's all you ever have to say to me.\n\nLeo: You know it's gonna make things very hard for a while.\n\nBartlet: You fought in a war, got me elected, and you run the country. I think we all owe you one, don't you?\n\nBartlet: Would it surprise you to know that for the last few months you have been on a short list of candidates for the bench?\n\nMendoza: Yes, it would.\n\nBartlet: Well then this is gonna knock your socks off. Tomorrow evening at 5 o’clock, I am naming you as my nominee to be the next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court. You were not the first choice, but you are the last one, and the right one. Will you accept the nomination?\n\nMendoza: With honor.\n\nBartlet: Good.\n\n[Everyone stands.]\n\nBartlet: Thank you. Sam and Toby will be in charge of your confirmation.\n\nSam: Congratulations, Judge.\n\nMendoza: Thank you. [shakes hands]\n\nToby: It's gonna be an excruciating battle, Mr. Justice, one I have no intention of losing.\n\nBartlet: What do you say, Leo? You up for a good fight?\n\nLeo: I believe I have one in me, yes sir.\n\nBartlet: Good. Let the good fight begin.\n\nC.J.: What's your secret service code name?\n\nSam: They just changed them.\n\nC.J.: I know. What's yours?\n\nSam: Princeton.\n\nC.J.: Mine's Flamingo.\n\nSam: It's nice.\n\nC.J.: No. It's not nice.\n\nSam: Flamingo is a nice looking bird.\n\nC.J.: The flamingo is a ridiculous looking bird.\n\nSam: You're not ridiculous looking.\n\nC.J.: I know I'm not ridiculous looking.\n\nSam: Any way for me to get out of this conversation?\n\nC.J.: I'm gonna go talk to someone.\n\nSam: Excellent.\n\nCharlie: This place looks great doesn't it?\n\nMrs. Landingham: Yeah.\n\nCharlie: I've never seen a Christmas look like this, the trees, and the lights, and everybody singing.\n\nMrs. Landingham: Yeah.\n\nCharlie: The presents...\n\nMrs. Landingham: Yeah.\n\nCharlie: I brought it up because, I don't know, you seem a little down this week.\n\nMrs. Landingham: Yeah, I know Charlie. I tend to get a little down during he holidays.\n\nCharlie: You don't like Christmas?\n\nMrs. Landingham: I miss my boys.\n\nCharlie: I never knew you had kids.\n\nMrs. Landingham: Twins. Andrew and Simon. I tried not, you know, I dressed them differently, but they still did everything together. They went off to medical school together, and then they finished their second year at the same time, and of course their lottery number came up at the same time.\n\nCharlie: For the draft?\n\nMrs. Landingham: Yeah.\n\nCharlie: Well, I would have thought they could get a deferment to finish med school.\n\nMrs. Landingham: They didn't want one. Their father and I begged them, but they wanted to go where people needed doctors. Their father and I begged them, but you can't tell kids anything. So they joined up as medics and four months later they were pinned down during a fight in Da Nang and were killed by enemy fire. That was Christmas Eve 1970. [beat] You know, they were so young, Charlie, they were your age. It's hard when that happens so far away, you know because, with the noises and the shooting, they had to be so scared. It's hard not to think that right then they needed their mother... Anyway, I miss my boys.\n\nJosh: An hour with you in a rare book store. Couldn't you just drop me off the top of the Washington Monument instead?\n\nBartlet: It's Christmas, Josh! No reason we can't do both.\n\nLeo: You went and did it?\n\nJosh: What?\n\nLeo: Exactly what I asked you not to do.\n\nJosh: Leo.\n\nLeo: You went and saw Sam's friend?\n\nSam: How'd you know?\n\nLeo: I had you tailed.\n\nJosh: You had us tailed?\n\nLeo: Yes.\n\nSam: Why did you have us tailed?\n\nLeo: On the off chance that you're as stupid as you look. Whose idea was this?\n\nJosh: It was mine. Sam was a reluctant accomplice. You had us tailed?\n\nLeo: Get over it.\n\nSam: She didn't give us anything.\n\nLeo: I should hope not.\n\nJosh: Leo.\n\nLeo: It's not what we do, Josh.\n\nSam: That may be true, but still...\n\nLeo: It's not what we do.\n\nSam: Yes, sir.\n\nLeo: You should apologize to that girl for even asking.\n\nSam: I did.\n\nLeo: Then apologize again.\n\nSam: Yes, sir.\n\nLeo: Like I'm not gonna have enough problems without the Keystone Cops.\n\nJosh: We meant well.\n\nLeo: Is that supposed to mean something to me?\n\nJosh: No.\n\nLeo: [beat] Well, it does.\n\nJosh: I'm glad.\n\nLeo: Go back to work.\n\nSam: It's Christmas Eve.\n\nLeo: What, the country isn't open Christmas Eve?\n\nSam: Fair point.\n\nBartlet: Apparently, I’ve arranged for an honor guard for somebody.\n\nToby: Yes, sir. I’m sorry.\n\nBartlet: No no. Just tell me, is there anything else I’ve arranged for? We’re still in NATO right?\n\nToby: Yes, sir.\n\nBartlet: What’s going on?\n\nToby: A homeless man died last night; a Korean War veteran, who was wearing a coat that I gave to the Goodwill. It had my card in it.\n\nBartlet: Toby, you’re not responsible for …\n\nToby: An hour and twenty minutes for the ambulance to get there. A Lance Corporal, United States Marine Corps, Second of the Seventh. The guy got better treatment at Panmunjom.\n\nBartlet: Toby, if we start pulling strings like this, you don’t think every homeless veteran would come out of the woodwork?\n\nToby: I can only hope, sir.\n\nBartlet: There's an India expert I want to bring in.\n\nLeo: Who?\n\n[Bartlet looks at him pointedly.]\n\nLeo: No.\n\nBartlet: You guys are gonna love him.\n\nLeo: He's a lunatic!\n\nBartlet: He's colorful.\n\nLeo: He's certifiable!\n\nSam: Who?\n\nBartlet: Lord John Marbury, former ambassador to New Delhi from the Court of Saint James.\n\nSam: Where do we find him?\n\nLeo: A psychiatric institution.\n\nBartlet: He's colorful, Leo.\n\nLeo: You're really gonna let him loose in the White House, where there's liquor and women?\n\nBartlet: We can hide the women. But the man deserves a drink.\n\nToby: I was warned that coming to talk to you might be insulting to your professionalism.\n\nC.J.: Well, you wouldn't want to do that.\n\nToby: I wasn't ready for the press yet.\n\nC.J.: Could've told me that before sending me in there.\n\nToby: C.J.\n\nC.J.: I flatly denied it. I said I was in the Oval Office ten minutes ago and nothing's going on.\n\nToby: They don't think you lied to them.\n\nC.J.: I know that. They think you lied to me, which is what happened. They don't know me. I'm from nowhere. I was just starting to get credible. I was just starting to get their respect. You know how long it's going to take me to get it back?\n\nToby: There's a concern.\n\nC.J.: Don't ask C.J.; she doesn't know anything.\n\nToby: There is a concern that you're too friendly with the press.\n\nC.J.: Really.\n\nToby: We know it's important that you have a friendly relationship with them...\n\nC.J.: It's important for all of us.\n\nToby: I don't disagree.\n\nC.J.: Does this have to do with Danny Concannon?\n\nToby: People see you with Danny.\n\nC.J.: This is outrageous.\n\nToby: This is one time, and if we erred, it's on the side of trying to...\n\nC.J.: You sent me in there uninformed so that I'd lie to the press.\n\nToby: We sent you in there uninformed because we thought there was a chance you couldn't.\n\nCharlie: Mr. President, I was wondering if I could ask you a question.\n\nBartlet: Sure.\n\nCharlie: I was wondering how you would feel about my going out on a date with Zoey.\n\nBartlet: I'm sorry?\n\nCharlie: Well, Zoey was talking to me before, and she mentioned that if I had a free night...\n\nBartlet: My daughter asked you out?\n\nCharlie: Yes, sir.\n\nBartlet: I should've locked her in the dungeon.\n\nCharlie: I don't think you've got one, sir.\n\nBartlet: I could've built one.\n\nBartlet: Thank you for coming. How was your flight?\n\nMarbury: Intoxicating.\n\nLeo: So I see.\n\nMarbury: [to Leo] Allow me to present myself...Lord John Marbury, I was summoned by your President.\n\nLeo: Yes. We've met, 10 or 12 times. I'm Leo McGarry.\n\nMarbury: I thought you were the butler.\n\nLeo: No, I'm the White House Chief of Staff.\n\nMarbury: Nonetheless, would you have something with which to light my cigarette?\n\nLeo: No, I'm afraid we don't allow smoking in this part of the world.\n\nMarbury: Really?\n\nLeo: Yes, sir.\n\nMarbury: In this part over here, we encourage it.\n\nLeo: Sir.\n\nMarbury: It's 'Your Lordship,' as a matter of fact, but it couldn't possibly make the least difference. So, tell me, how can I be of service to you? If it's within my power to give, you shall have it.\n\nBartlet: We need your take on the situation, John.\n\nMarbury: What is your 'take' on the situation?\n\nBartlet: The world is coming apart at the seams.\n\nMarbury: Well, then... [hands his coat to Leo] ...thank God you sent for me!\n\nBartlet: Say, listen. My hesitation about your going out with Zoey before, you know, it's not 'cause you're black.\n\nCharlie: I didn't think it was.\n\nBartlet: It's not.\n\nCharlie: I thought it was 'cause I'm a guy.\n\nBartlet: It is.\n\nCharlie: I understand.\n\nBartlet: Still, I want you to go out with her if that's what you both want to do.\n\nCharlie: I'd like to.\n\nBartlet: That's fine.\n\nCharlie: Thank you, sir.\n\nBartlet: Just remember these two things: She's nineteen years old, and the 82nd Airborne works for me.\n\nCharlie: Yes sir.\n\nBartlet: [practicing the State of the Union speech] I came to this hallowed chamber one year ago on a mission, to restore the American dream for all our people as we gaze at the vast horizon of possibilities open to us... in the 321st century. Wow, that was ambitious of me, wasn't it?\n\nSam: Leo.\n\nLeo: Let's take a break.\n\nBartlet: We meant 'stronger' here, right?\n\nSam: What does it say?\n\nBartlet: I'm proud to report our country's stranger than it was a year ago?\n\nSam: That's a typo.\n\nBartlet: Could go either way.\n\nBartlet: Abbey phoned me up and told me about your conversation. I was diagnosed about seven years ago. My life expectancy is normal. My particular course of MS is relapsing remitting, which means I should experience total recovery after attacks. Abbey gives me injections of something called Betaseron, and that reduces the frequency. Fever and stress tend to be two things that induces attacks.\n\nLeo: Well, you're the President of the United States, you're delivering the State of the Union tomorrow night, India and Pakistan are pointing nuclear weapons at each other, and you have a 102-degree fever. So I guess we're out of the woods, hmm?\n\nBartlet: 101.9.\n\nLeo: Jed, of all the things you could've kept from me...\n\nBartlet: You haven't called me 'Jed' since I was elected.\n\nLeo: [sits] Why didn't you tell me?\n\nBartlet: 'Cause I wanted to be the President.\n\nLeo: That wouldn't have stopped me from getting you here. And I could've been a friend.\n\nBartlet: You've been a friend.\n\nLeo: But when it was time to really...\n\nBartlet: I know.\n\nBartlet: What have you got for me, John?\n\nLord John Marbury: Well, um, after speaking at length this past week with your secretaries of state and defense, as well as your joint chiefs and various embassy officials, I believe this. Buy them off.\n\nBartlet: Buy them?\n\nLord John Marbury: Yes, sir.\n\nBartlet: How?\n\nLord John Marbury: Mr. President, for several centuries, my kingdom has ruled India with a stick and carrot. When we had a particular problem with someone, one solution we would try is to make him a maharaja. That's kind of a regional king. We would pay him off with an annual tribute, and in return, he would be loyal to the crown.\n\nLeo: Lord Marbury, under our Constitution, our President is not empowered to create maharajas.\n\nLord John Marbury: Yes. Thank you for clearing that up, Leo. Having been educated at Cambridge and the Sorbonne, I am, as you know, exceedingly stupid.\n\nBartlet: John, please.\n\nLord John Marbury: You've been paying the world off since the industrial age. Foreign aid, during the Cold War was you paying dictators to be on your side. To this very day, you pay Korea not to develop nuclear weapons.\n\nBartlet: What does India want?\n\nLord John Marbury: A computer industry, and for that, they require an infrastructure, and that is what you can give them.\n\nLeo: Why?\n\nLord John Marbury: It's the price you pay.\n\nLeo: For avoiding a war halfway around the world?\n\nLord John Marbury: For being rich, free and alive all at the same time, and for the criminally negligent behavior of your Congress in not checking the proliferation of nuclear devices.\n\nBartlet: [while sick in bed] I was watching a television program before, with a kind of roving moderator who spoke to a seated panel of young women who were having some sort of problem with their boyfriends - apparently, because the boyfriends had all slept with the girlfriends' mothers. And they brought the boyfriends out, and they fought, right there on television. Toby, tell me: these people don't vote, do they?\n\nToby: I wouldn't think so. No sir.\n\nJosh: [pokes his head in] Excuse me, Mr. President.\n\nBartlet: What do you need, Josh?\n\nToby: I asked Josh to join me here, sir\n\nBartlet: What's on your mind?\n\nToby: \"The era of big government is over.\"\n\nBartlet: You want to cut the line?\n\nToby: I want to change the sentiment. [pause] We're running away from ourselves and I know we can score points that way, I was a principal architect of that campaign strategy right along with you, Josh. But we're here now, tomorrow night we do an immense thing; we have to say what we feel, that government, no matter what its failures in the past and in times to come for that matter, government can be a place where people come together and where no one gets left behind. No one...gets left behind. An instrument of good. [pause] I have no trouble understanding why the line tested well, Josh, but I don't think that means we should say it. I think that means we should... change it.\n\nBartlet: [slowly nods] I think so, too. [beat] What do you think, Josh?\n\nJosh: I make it a point never to disagree with Toby when he's right, Mr. President.\n\n[with the Secretary of Agriculture, Roger Tribbey, the Designated survivor staying behind during the State of the Union address]\n\nBartlet: OK, Roger. If anything happened, you know what to do, right?\n\nRoger Tribbey: I honestly hadn't thought about it, sir.\n\nBartlet: First thing always is national security. Get your commanders together. Appoint Joint Chiefs, appoint a chairman. Take us to DEFCON 4. Have the governors send emergency delegates to Washington. The assistant Attorney General is going to be the Acting A.G. If he tells you he wants to bring out the National Guard, do what he tells you. [pause] You got a best friend?\n\nRoger Tribbey: Yes, sir.\n\nBartlet: Is he smarter than you?\n\nRoger Tribbey: [chuckles] Yes, sir.\n\nBartlet: Would you trust him with your life?\n\nRoger Tribbey: Yes, sir.\n\nBartlet: That's your chief of staff.\n\nJosh: We've got a bit of a sticky wicket.\n\nC.J.: Please don't tell me I'm staying here and working late tonight.\n\nJosh: I need you to read a report.\n\nC.J.: I'm a woman in her prime, Josh, I'm a prime woman.\n\nJosh: There's no doubt about it, but I need you to read this anyway.\n\nC.J.: What is it?\n\nJosh: We want Congress to sign off on funds for a hundred thousand new teachers. They say, fine, but you gotta stipulate that in Sex Ed classes....\n\nC.J.: Abstinence only?\n\nJosh: Yes.\n\nC.J.: I would have no trouble passing such a class.\n\nJosh: We commissioned a report about a year ago on Sex Education in public schools, and, well, this is it.\n\nC.J.: What's it say?\n\nJosh: It's not good.\n\nC.J.: How's it not good?\n\nJosh: It says basically that teaching 'abstinence only' doesn't work—that people are going to be prone to have sex whether they're cautioned against it or not.\n\nC.J.: Well, what are they recommending?\n\nJosh: Something called \"abstinence plus\".\n\nC.J.: Abstinence plus?\n\nJosh: Yes.\n\nC.J.: What's that mean?\n\nJosh: Well, Sam's renamed it 'everything but'.\n\nC.J.: Everything but?\n\nJosh: Yes.\n\nC.J.: Ah.\n\nJosh: Yes.\n\nC.J.: They want teachers to teach...\n\nJosh: Yes.\n\nC.J.: And so the sticky wicket joke was..?\n\nJosh: A regrettable pun. Should I order you some food?\n\nC.J.: Y'know, I can't remember the last time I got home before midnight.\n\nJosh: By the way, pages 27 to 33? A couple of things every girl should know.\n\nC.J.: Get me a salad.\n\nHamlin: [on why the government should cut funding to PBS] Product licensing for this merchandise brings in over $20 million a year, none of which goes to PBS, all of which goes to the show's producer, the Children's Television Workshop. Now this is a company whose chief executive earns high six-figures in salary and benefits per year. Yet Sesame Street is subsidized by taxpayer dollars.\n\nToby: It's a perfectly reasonable complaint.\n\nSondra: And?\n\nToby: I don't care.\n\nHamlin: Toby...\n\nToby: We're gonna see to all those things. In the meantime, at a time when the public is rightly concerned about the impact of sex and violence on TV this administration is gonna protect the Muppets, we're gonna protect Wall Street Week, we're gonna protect Live From Lincoln Center and by God, we are going to protect Julia Child.\n\nC.J.: If you call Mr. and Mrs. Lydell in St. Paul and ask them why...\n\nDanny: Don't.\n\nC.J.: Look...\n\nDanny: Don't leak me a story.\n\nC.J.: I wasn't.\n\nDanny: I've seen this look on the face of four other press secretaries before you. You've got a story in the trash this week that's a story, you want it out there and someone said, \"No.\"\n\nC.J.: They're all stories this week.\n\nDanny: That happens sometimes.\n\nC.J.: Four other press secretaries and you never took a free lead?\n\nDanny: I always took a free lead.\n\nC.J.: Then...\n\nDanny: Not from you.\n\nC.J.: Why?\n\nDanny: Cause twenty minutes from now, you're gonna remember you're a professional and you're not gonna like me anymore.\n\nC.J.: What makes you think I like you now?\n\nDanny: I don't know. But, as long as you keep grabbing me and kissing me, what the hell do I care?\n\nC.J.: Good point.\n\nDanny: If there's a story, I'll find it.\n\nC.J.: No, you won't.\n\nDanny: How do you know?\n\nC.J.: Cause we've gotten very good at this.\n\nDanny: Yes, you have.\n\nC.J. Yes, we have.\n\nBartlet: Mrs. Landingham.\n\nMrs. Landingham: Yes sir?\n\nBartlet: You're not going to believe this but I think I'd actually like a banana.\n\nMrs. Landingham: I'm afraid not sir, no.\n\nBartlet: Why not?\n\nMrs. Landingham: You were offered one earlier, sir, and you were snippy.\n\nBartlet: I wasn't snippy!\n\nMrs. Landingham: I'm afraid you were, Mr. President. [looks toward the oval office] C.J.'s waiting, sir.\n\nBartlet: Thank you, Mrs. Landingham. [To C.J. as he enters the Oval Office] She withholds food from me.\n\nMr. Lydell: The hate crimes bill is fine. Who gives a damn? It's fine, I don't care. If you ask me, we shouldn't be making laws against what's in a person's head but I don't give a damn, it's fine. I don't understand how this president, who I voted for, I don't understand how he can take such a completely weak ass position on gay rights. Gays in the military, same sex marriage, gay adoption, boards of education. Where the hell is he? I want to know what quality necessary to being a parent the president feels my son lacked. I want to know from this president who has served not one day in uniform - I had two terms in Vietnam - I want to know what quality necessary to being a soldier this president feels my son lacked. Lady I'm not embarrassed that my son is gay, my government is.\n\nSam: The U.S. is one of five countries on earth that puts to death people who're under the age of 18 when they committed a crime.\n\nCharlie: Nigeria.\n\nSam: Pakistan.\n\nCharlie: Saudi Arabia and Iran?\n\nSam: Yeah. So, that's a list we definitely want to be on.\n\nToby: The Torah doesn't prohibit capital punishment.\n\nRabbi Glassman: No.\n\nToby: It says, 'An eye for an eye'.\n\nRabbi Glassman: You know what it also says? It says a rebellious child can be brought to the city gates and stoned to death. It says homosexuality is an abomination and punishable by death. It says men can be polygamous and slavery is acceptable. For all I know, that thinking reflected the best wisdom of its time, but it's just plain wrong by any modern standard. Society has a right to protect itself, but it doesn't have a right to be vengeful. It has a right to punish, but it doesn't have a right to kill.\n\nToby: You want me to walk into the Oval Office and say, \"Vengeance is not Jewish?\"\n\nRabbi Glassman: Why not?\n\nToby: Well, for one thing, neither is the President!\n\nRabbi Glassman: Say what you will about the Catholic Church, but their position on life is unimpeachable: no abortion, no death penalty.\n\nToby: I spent yesterday...\n\nRabbi Glassman: You spent yesterday hoping the President wouldn't call the Pope.\n\nToby: You're damn right I did.\n\nRabbi Glassman: If he had done it, after doing so, the fear of every non-Catholic who voted for him would be realized.\n\nToby: Congratulations Rabbi Glassman, you may now join the White House communications staff!\n\nBartlet: Charlie, I'm going to ask you a question. And this is one of those times that it's OK to tell me I've stepped over the line, and I should shut my mouth, okay?\n\nCharlie: Okay.\n\nBartlet: What happened to the guy who shot your mother?\n\nCharlie: They haven't found him yet, sir.\n\nBartlet: If they did, would you want to see him executed? Killing a police officer is a capital crime. I figured you must have thought about it.\n\nCharlie: Yes, sir.\n\nBartlet: And?\n\nCharlie: I wouldn't want to see him executed, Mr. President. [pause] I'd want to do it myself.\n\nBartlet: [looks thoughtful] Yeah.\n\nBartlet: I want you to know that I had a number of people on my staff search for a reason the public would find palatable to commute the sentence. Technicality. Any evidence of racism.\n\nFather Cavanaugh: So your staff spent the weekend looking for a way out.\n\nBartlet: Yeah.\n\nFather Cavanaugh: Like the kid in right field who doesn't want the ball to get hit to him.\n\nBartlet: I'm the leader of a democracy, Tom. 71% of the people support capital punishment. The people have spoken. The courts have spoken.\n\nFather Cavanaugh: Did you call the Pope?\n\nBartlet: Yeah.\n\nFather Cavanaugh: And how do you do that?\n\nBartlet: Oh, for crying out loud, Tom. I open my mouth and say, \"Somebody get me the Pope.\"\n\nFather Cavanaugh: [raising a finger to emphasize his point] Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. President, but I was thinking... [pause] You're just this kid from my parish, and now you're calling the Pope.\n\nBartlet: Anyway...I looked for a way out, I really did.\n\nFather Cavanaugh: \"Vengeance is mine,\" sayeth the Lord. You know what that means? God is the only one who gets to kill people.\n\nBartlet: I know.\n\nFather Cavanaugh: That was your way out.\n\nBartlet: I know.\n\nFather Cavanaugh: Did you pray?\n\nBartlet: I did, Tom. I know it's hard to believe, but I prayed for wisdom.\n\nFather Cavanaugh: And none came?\n\nBartlet: It never has. And I'm a little pissed off about that. [glances at his watch as it hits midnight] I'm not kidding.\n\nFather Cavanaugh: You know, you remind me of the man that lived by the river. He heard a radio report that the river was going to rush up and flood the town. And that all the residents should evacuate their homes. But the man said, \"I’m religious. I pray. God loves me. God will save me.\"\n\nThe waters rose up. A guy in a row boat came along and he shouted, \"Hey, hey you! You in there. The town is flooding. Let me take you to safety.\" But the man shouted back, \"I’m religious. I pray. God loves me. God will save me.\"\n\nA helicopter was hovering overhead. And a guy with a megaphone shouted, \"Hey you, you down there. The town is flooding. Let me drop this ladder and I’ll take you to safety.\" But the man shouted back that he was religious, that he prayed, that God loved him and that God will take him to safety.\n\nWell... the man drowned. And standing at the gates of St. Peter, he demanded an audience with God. \"Lord,\" he said, \"I’m a religious man, I pray. I thought you loved me. Why did this happen?\" God said, \"I sent you a radio report, a helicopter, and a guy in a rowboat. What the hell are you doing here?\" [pause] He sent you a priest, a rabbi, and a Quaker, Mr. President. Not to mention his son, Jesus Christ. What do you want from him?\n\n[C.J. knocks on the door and enters]\n\nC.J.: Excuse me. [she hands the President a note, then leaves; Bartlet stands, and leans on his desk in silence for a moment]\n\nFather Cavanaugh: Jed...would you like me to hear your confession?\n\nBartlet: Yes, please. [takes up his rosary and kneels next to Cavanaugh, crossing himself] Bless me, Father, for I have sinned...\n\nC.J.: [knocks on Josh's door] Josh...\n\nJosh: [looks up] What the hell happened?\n\nC.J.: I had woot canal.\n\nJosh: What happened to your cheeks?\n\nC.J.: I had woot canal!\n\nJosh: Why are you talking like that?\n\nC.J.: I had woot canal!\n\nJosh: Yeah, I heard you the first time, I was just amusing myself.\n\nC.J.: I can suggesht some ovva fings you can do wif yourshelf!\n\nJosh: Are you in pain?\n\nC.J.: I HAD WOOT CANAL!\n\nJosh: You're gonna need to stop saying that, 'cause you just look and sound so ridiculous.\n\nJosh: First, I'm happy to tell you that the incident involving Secretary O'Leary and Congressman Wooden has been dispensed with... though not really, and I'll get to that at the end. Sam asked C.J. to move the briefing to two o'clock so that we could fold in the teachers. C.J. had emergency root canal surgery at noon and so was unable to brief.\n\nBartlet: Who did?\n\nJosh: I did.\n\nBartlet: Oh, God.\n\nJosh: You're going to be reading a bit today about your secret plan to fight inflation.\n\nBartlet: I have a secret plan to fight inflation?\n\nJosh: No.\n\nBartlet: Why am I going to be reading that I do?\n\nJosh: It was suggested in the press room that you do.\n\nBartlet: By who?\n\nJosh: By me.\n\nBartlet: You told the press I have a secret plan to fight inflation?\n\nJosh: No, I did not. Let me be absolutely clear, I did not do that. Except, yes, I did that.\n\nBartlet: Josh, I'm a little confused.\n\nJosh: Sir, there was this idiotic round robin. It was sarcastic. There was no way they didn't know that. They were just mad at me for imposing discipline and calling them stupid.\n\nBartlet: Okay, before we go on: C.J., if blood is gushing from a head wound you just received from a herd of stampeding bison, you'll do the press briefings.\n\nC.J.: Yes sir.\n\nJosh: I denied it for half an hour, they wouldn't take no for an answer!\n\nBartlet: You were clear?\n\nJosh: I was crystal clear! They said, \"Do you think that if the President has a plan to fight inflation, it's right that he keep it a secret?\" I said, of course not!\n\nBartlet: Are you telling me that not only did you invent a secret plan to fight inflation, but now you don't support it?\n\nLeo: [about Judge Mendoza] He’s driving from Nova Scotia to Washington?\n\nSam: Yeah.\n\nLeo: How’s a person do that?\n\nSam: Oh, my guess is, he’ll take the Trans-Canada Highway to New Brunswick, then maybe catch the 1 and take the scenic route along the coast of Maine. 95 through New Hampshire to the Mass Pike, and then cut over to the Merritt Parkway 'round Milford.\n\nToby: Something really kinda freakish about you, you know that?\n\nMendoza: You pull all the strings you want, Toby, but not for me. Come Monday, I'm gonna avail myself of the criminal justice system for which I have worked my entire adult life.\n\nToby: Judge, due respect. Get your things and let's go.\n\nMendoza: [angrily] My kid was in the car, Toby. They patted me down and they handcuffed me in front of my nine-year-old boy. Then he and his mother got to see them put me in the squad car and drive away.\n\nToby: He's also seen you wearing a robe with a gavel in your hand.\n\nMendoza: He doesn't understand that. He doesn't know what that is. He understands what the police are because he watches television. That's what he's gonna remember, his father being handcuffed. So America just got another pissed-off guy with dark skin.\n\nCharlie: [on Air Force 1] How you doing?\n\nZoey: Hi.\n\nCharlie: Listen, uh, I don't know if I'm going to be able to be as attentive on this trip as you would like.\n\nZoey: That's okay. You're working.\n\nCharlie: Well, I've been trying to listen to some of the many lessons you've been giving me on how to be a better boyfriend and I know that attentiveness--\n\nZoey: No, this is one of the times when it's okay.\n\nCharlie: Okay. It's hard to tell the difference between those times and the other times.\n\nZoey: I know. Doesn't that suck for you?\n\nCharlie: A little bit, yeah.\n\nBartlet: Okay. Zoey's 19 and she wants to be a teenager. She wants a college experience, and I can't blame her. I loved college. So did my other daughters. I want Zoey to be comfortable with her protection, I don't want her to try and give you the slip. It's not your job to tell me she wants to cut English Lit, it's not your job to tell me if she's dying her hair blue, or going to a strip club, or whatever it is she's doing with her friends. You know what your job is.\n\nGina: Yes, sir.\n\nBartlet: Thank you.\n\nGina: [gets up and shakes his hand] Thank you, Mr. President.\n\nBartlet: Gina?\n\nGina: Yes, sir?\n\nBartlet: If she's cutting English Lit, I want to know about it.\n\nGina: No deal, Mr. President.\n\nBartlet: Okay. [smiles]\n\nBartlet: We'll see you there.\n\nToby: What, I'm not coming in the car?\n\nBartlet: No, and you know why? Because you made fun of the guacamole.\n\nToby: I didn't!\n\nBartlet: I could tell you were thinking it.\n\nToby: ...Fair enough.\n\nAl Kiefer: Mr. President, do you want to sew up reelection right now? Do you want a lock on your second term right here, right now in this room?\n\nBartlet: What do you got?\n\nJosh: Why do you encourage him?\n\nBartlet: What do you got, Al?\n\nAl Kiefer: A truckload of voters, Mr. President, about 47%, overwhelmingly white men, pool and patio types, who voted against you by 20 plus points. They share an affinity towards authority, a President. And they see you as smart and having vision, so why didn't they vote for you? Because they also see you as a wimp. Two-thirds of them on a thermometer place you as some degree of weak.\n\nJosh: We've heard these numbers before.\n\nBartlet: Yeah, but I never get tired of hearing them, you know. Especially in front of my daughter.\n\nAl Kiefer: Look, I get that this is not the most popular idea in the room. But I got numbers, and I know numbers, and I trust numbers. And the reason you're all looking a little pale right now is so do you. This is not theoretical. The flag burning amendment made it through the House with 20 votes over the required two-thirds. It hasn't made it through the Senate yet, but that day will come, that day will come, that day will come soon. Laws against flag burning are favored overwhelmingly in the polls, and a constitutional amendment won't be subject to a Presidential veto, or overturning by the Supreme Court.\n\nToby: Look...\n\nAl Kiefer: This all adds up to one thing, Mr. President. It's over! The game's been played and won. But because of guys like me, you get the results before anyone else does, so you get to pick which side you're on. And not only do we get to be on the winning team, we get to lead the winning team.\n\n[Josh's phone rings. He walks away from the table.]\n\nJosh: Excuse me.\n\nAl Kiefer: Toby, you're smiling.\n\nToby: I just figured out who you were.\n\nAl Kiefer: He's going to say Satan.\n\nToby: No. You're the guy that runs into 7-Eleven to get Satan a pack of cigarettes.\n\nLeo: John, I know we've had our ups and downs, but let me be your guy here for a second. You can't be thinking about being the first vice president in history to break a tie going the other way.\n\nHoynes: I'm not looking to make history.\n\nLeo: Then what are you looking for, John? You're going to get ink either way.\n\nHoynes: Leo.\n\nLeo: I know that it eats at you that there is friction between you and my staff. You think they don't respect you. And they do. They just don't trust you. And frankly, neither does the President.\n\nHoynes: Well...\n\nLeo: I mean I know that's tough. But God, John, I'm the one that convinced him to put you on the ticket. And I'm going to be the one standing here when you make history, whether you're going to or not.\n\nHoynes: Leo, one of these days you're going to have to allow for the possibility that my motives might not always be sinister. You and your staff are remarkably smug, and frankly so is the President. And the fact that you think I give a damn that there is some friction between me and your staff is certainly proof enough of that.\n\nLeo: John, you will not be able to set foot in the West Wing. You will not be on the ticket in three years.\n\nHoynes: Leo, I think you guys set me up.\n\nLeo: You think the President of the United States can arrange for a 50-50 tie in the Senate?\n\nHoynes: I think the President of the United States can do pretty much whatever he wants.\n\nLeo: You're wrong.\n\nJosh: We're gonna do 'good cop, bad cop.'\n\nToby: No, we're really not.\n\nJosh: Why not?\n\nToby: 'Cause this isn't an episode of Hawaii Five-O. How about you be the good cop and I be the cop that doesn't go to the meeting?\n\nToby: You're concerned about American labor and manufacturing?\n\nCongressman: Yeah.\n\nToby: What kind of car do you drive?\n\nCongressman: Toyota.\n\nToby: Then shut up.\n\n...\n\nJosh: [in the hall] This, right here, this is the reason why you have a reputation as a pain in the ass.\n\nToby: I've cultivated that reputation.\n\n...\n\nJosh: What would you have done if he had said he drove an American car?\n\nToby: Found some other way of humiliating him.\n\nJosh: You like winning, don't you?\n\nToby: Saves you from having to say the word please.\n\nDanny: [sitting outside the Oval Office] How you doing. Mrs. Landingham?\n\nMrs. Landingham: [smiles] Fine. Thank you, Danny.\n\nDanny: [smiles] You keep glancing over like you're afraid I'm gonna steal something.\n\nMrs. Landingham: No, I'm not used to having members of the print media in here.\n\nDanny: I'll try not to get ink on the furniture.\n\nMrs. Landingham: Aw, Danny, and I was just about to offer you a cookie.\n\nDanny: And now?\n\nMrs. Landingham: No.\n\nDanny: I saw you guys are going to the opening on Friday.\n\nCharlie: No.\n\nDanny: No?\n\nCharlie: Security.\n\nDanny: Is Zoey bothered?\n\nCharlie: You know, Danny, I don't mind talking, but I say it here and 10 million people read about tomorrow.\n\nDanny: Thanks for the boost in my circulation but I'm actually off the record up here.\n\nCharlie: [looks down] It's not going to work.\n\nDanny: What's not going to work?\n\nCharlie: You know what I'm talking about.\n\nDanny: You and Zoey?\n\nCharlie: Yeah.\n\nDanny: Why?\n\nCharlie: [angry] Look, I do what I do...I go where I go. If it's a problem for the Secret Service that I'm black...\n\nDanny: Whoa....\n\nCharlie: ...then that's the way it is. But she shouldn't expect candy and flowers, you know what I mean?\n\nDanny: I know what you're saying. But I don't think the problem is you're black. I think the problem is you're stupid.\n\nCharlie: Well, thanks, Danny. You picked me right up.\n\nDanny: You bet. Listen, the Hardy Boys in the letters they're talking about, they may be heavily armed but I wouldn't put a lot of money on their marksmanship. One of these days they're gonna miss her and hit me. Two thousand marriage proposals, 2,000 death threats, a dozen bodyguards. Everyone wants to get close. Everyone wants a thing. Plus, and I say this standing fifteen feet from the Oval Office, life with father couldn't have been a real company picnic, you know. If it was me, just for now, I'd make sure I was the one guy in her life who was hassle free. That's just me.\n\nAbbey: Okay. So just ease up on the high ground.\n\nBartlet: On that point I concede the high ground.\n\nAbbey: And I concede I was wrong about the thing.\n\nBartlet: Good.\n\nAbbey: However...\n\nBartlet: No. No \"however\". Just be wrong. Just stand there in your wrongness and be wrong and get used to it.\n\nJeff Breckenridge: You got a dollar?\n\nJosh: Yeah.\n\nJeff Breckenridge: Take it out. Look at the back. The seal, the pyramid, it's unfinished, with the eye of God looking over it, and the words annuit coeptis - he, God, favors our undertaking. The seal is meant to be unfinished, because this country's meant to be unfinished. We're meant to keep doing better. We're meant to keep discussing and debating. And we're meant to read books by great historical scholars and then talk about them...\n\nSam: Mallory, everything that you're saying makes sense. I just think that the state of urban schools is such that if you can save even one kid...\n\nMallory: [stands] You can save more than one kid...\n\nSam: Tell me how.\n\nMallory: By asking Congress to approve, not just a little, but a lot more money for public education.\n\n[Sam laughs]\n\nMallory: What?\n\nSam: [stands] Public education has been a public policy disaster for 40 years. Having spent around four trillion dollars on public schools since 1965, the result has been a steady and inexorable decline in every measurable standard of student performance, to say nothing of health and safety. But don't worry about it, because the U.S. House of Representatives is on the case. I feel better already.\n\nMallory:[beat] Wow.\n\nSam: What?\n\nMallory: For a guy who's trying to date me, that was pretty snotty.\n\nSam: Well, hang on. These are office hours. If I'd known I was working on that I would have had a whole different attitude.\n\nMallory: He's in favor of school vouchers, Dad.\n\nLeo: No, Mallory. He's really not.\n\nMallory: Yes, he is.\n\nLeo: No, he's not.\n\nMallory: I read the position paper.\n\nLeo: It's opposition prep.\n\nMallory: Opposition prep?\n\nLeo: When we're gearing up for a debate, we have the smart guys take the other side.\n\nMallory: [to Sam] You stood there and argued with me.\n\nSam: Yes.\n\nMallory: Why?\n\nSam: You made an appointment.\n\nMallory: Sam...\n\nLeo: Would the two of you take it outside?\n\nSam: I thought you were trying to drive a wedge between us.\n\nLeo: Yeah, but now you're just boring the crap out of me.\n\nMallory: Hey...\n\nSam: Mallory, education is the silver bullet. Education is everything. We don't need little changes. We need gigantic revolutionary changes. Schools should be palaces. Competition for the best teachers should be fierce. They should be getting six-figure salaries. Schools should be incredibly expensive for government and absolutely free of charge for its citizens, just like national defense. That is my position. I just haven't figured out how to do it yet.\n\nToby: I feel like I've lost 180 pounds. I am smiling, I am laughing, I am enjoying the people I work with - I gotta snap outta this. What's on your mind?\n\nMandy: I want you to help me get the Chinese to give us a new panda bear to replace LumLum.\n\n[Very long pause]\n\nToby: Well that did the trick.\n\n[The office staff watches the Senate start to vote on Mendoza's confirmation to the Supreme Court and begin celebrating. Bonnie starts handing around a bottle of champagne]\n\nToby: Put it down! Put it down!\n\nBonnie: Toby!\n\nToby: No champagne.\n\nBonnie: We're just getting--\n\nToby: Put it down. Everyone in this room, let me have your attention! Please. The law of our land mandates that Presidential appointees be confirmed by a majority of the Senate, a majority being a total of half plus one for a total of what, Ginger?\n\nGinger: Fifty-one.\n\nToby: Fifty-one 'yea' votes is what we see on these screens before a drop of wine is swallowed! Because there's a little thing called what, Bonnie?\n\nBonnie: \"Tempting fate\"?\n\nToby: \"Tempting fate\" is what it's called. In the three months that this man has been on my radar screen, I have aged forty-eight years. This is my day of jubilee, I will not have it screwed up by what, Bonnie?\n\nBonnie: By tempting fate.\n\nToby: By tempting fate! These things take patience. These things take skill. These things take luck. In the fifteen months we've been in office, what kind of luck have we had? Ginger?\n\nGinger: Bad luck.\n\nToby: [clears his throat and raises his eyebrows] What kind of luck?\n\nGinger: Very bad luck.\n\nToby: We've had very bad luck.\n\nC.J.: The theme of the Egg Hunt is \"learning is delightful and delicious\" - as, by the way, am I.\n\nBartlet: Can we get this god-forsaken event over with so I can get back to presiding over a civilization gone to hell in a hand cart?\n\nMrs. Landingham: Nice talk for a president.\n\nBartlet: Leave me alone.\n\nMrs. Landingham: You know what this is, don't you, sir?\n\nBartlet: What what is?\n\nMrs. Landingham: Your mood, sir.\n\nBartlet: Nothing wrong with my mood.\n\nMrs. Landingham: It's your diet.\n\nBartlet: Will you get off me with that?\n\nMrs. Landingham: You're not getting enough roughage in your diet. You know I'm right about that.\n\nBartlet: I know I'd like to beat you senseless with a head of cabbage, I know that for damn sure.\n\nMrs. Landingham: Once again you display an immaturity about vegetables that I think is not at all presidential.\n\nMajor Tate: Sir, we're not prejudiced toward homosexuals.\n\nAdmiral Fitzwallace: You just don't want to see them serving in the Armed Forces?\n\nMajor Tate: No, sir, I don't.\n\nAdmiral Fitzwallace: 'Cause they impose a threat to unit discipline and cohesion.\n\nMajor Tate: Yes, sir.\n\nAdmiral Fitzwallace: That's what I think, too. I also think the military wasn't designed to be an instrument of social change.\n\nMajor Tate: Yes, sir.\n\nAdmiral Fitzwallace: The problem with that is, that's what they were saying about me fifty years ago. \"Blacks shouldn't serve with whites. It would disrupt the unit.\" You know what? It did disrupt the unit. The unit got over it. The unit changed. I'm an admiral in the U.S. Navy and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff... Beat that with a stick.\n\nBartlet: Leo, if I ever told you to get aggressive about campaign finance or gays in the military, you would tell me, 'Don't run too fast or go too far.'\n\nLeo: If you ever told me to get aggressive about anything, I'd say I serve at the pleasure of the President. [pause] But we'll never know, sir, because I don't think you're ever gonna say it.\n\nBartlet: I have said it, and nothing's ever happened!\n\nLeo: You want to see me orchestrate this right now? You want to see me mobilize these people? These people who would walk into fire if you told them to. These people who showed up to lead. These people who showed up to fight. [points at Charlie] That guy gets death threats because he’s black and he dates your daughter! He was warned: “Do not show up to this place. Your life will be in danger.” He said, “To hell with that, I’m going anyway.” You said, “No.” Prudent or not prudent, this 21-year-old at 600 dollars a week says, “I’m going where I want to, because a man stands up!” [pause] Everyone's waiting for you. I don't know how much longer.\n\nBartlet: I don't want to feel like this anymore.\n\nLeo: You don't have to.\n\nBartlet: I don't want to go to sleep like this.\n\nLeo: You don't have to.\n\nBartlet: I want to speak.\n\nLeo: Say it out loud. Say it to me.\n\nBartlet: This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.\n\nLeo: Say it again.\n\nBartlet: This is more important than reelection. I want to speak now.\n\nLeo: Now we're in business!\n\nLeo: Listen up. Our ground game isn't working; we're gonna put the ball in the air. If we're gonna walk into walls, I want us running into them full speed.\n\nJosh: What are you saying?\n\nLeo: Well, you can start by telling the Hill the President's named his nominees to the FEC. And we're gonna lose some of these battles. And we might even lose the White House. But we're not going to be threatened by issues: we're going to put 'em front and center. We're gonna raise the level of public debate in this country, and let that be our legacy. That sound alright to you Josh?\n\nJosh: I serve at the pleasure of the President of the United States.\n\nLeo: Yeah?\n\nC.J.: I serve at the pleasure of the President.\n\nSam: I serve at the pleasure of President Bartlet.\n\nLeo: Toby?\n\nToby: I serve at the pleasure of the President.\n\nBonnie: [after Josh told the Senate Majority Leader to \"shove his legislative agenda up [his] ass\"] Rambo!\n\nJosh: You talking to me?\n\nBonnie: Nice phone call.\n\nJosh: That's how we do things in New England, my friends.\n\nBonnie: In Indiana, we're not allowed to talk like that.\n\nGinger: In New Jersey, we encourage it.\n\nSam: mandatory minimums are racist.\n\nToby: I understand that.\n\nSam: They're a red herring.\n\nToby: I understand that, too.\n\nSam: It's a way of looking like you're tough on crime, without assuming the burden of being tough on crime.\n\nToby: Everything you've said I understand.\n\nSam: I'm saying...\n\nToby: We do things one thing at a time.\n\nSam: But I'm saying we don't have time to do things one thing at a time.\n\nToby: We're talking about treatment.\n\nSam: I'm talking about treatment and I'm talking about mandatory minimums and I'm saying it's a red herring and I'm saying it's racist.\n\nToby: When you talk to the President, I want you talking about treatment. I want you talking about treatment vs. enforcement and I don't want you to stray from that!\n\nSam: Toby, is this what you meant when you said, \"Sam, you're completely in charge of this\"?\n\nToby: Yes, I meant, you're completely in charge of this, in the sense that you're subordinate to me in every way.\n\nToby: [to Andy] I have to get back to work. And you, being a Congresswoman... I'm sure you need to be back out there... you know, screwing the people.\n\nJosh: Take it easy.\n\nSam: I won’t take it easy! Give me the phone. I'm gonna call the Senator and I'm gonna tell him that he can shove his legislative agenda up his ass!\n\nJosh: I've already done that.\n\nSam: I'll do it again.\n\nJosh: You know what this is like? This is like The Godfather. When Pacino tells James Caan that he's gonna kill the cop. It's a lot like that scene, only not really.\n\n...\n\nJosh: It is like that scene. I'm James Caan. [to Sam] You're...you're Al Pacino.\n\nToby: Let's go.\n\nJosh: Toby, you're the guy who shows Pacino how to make tomato sauce.\n\nToby: Mr. President.\n\nBartlet: We were almost done.\n\nToby: I... met with Congresswoman Wyatt today.\n\nBartlet: When you were married to her, did you call her Congresswoman Wyatt?\n\nToby: No, sir.\n\nBartlet: Sometimes I call my wife Dr. Bartlet.\n\nToby: I call her Andy or uh... Andrea.\n\nBartlet: Okay.\n\nToby: Mandatory minimums.\n\nBartlet: You're whupped, my friend.\n\nToby: Sir.\n\nBartlet: No, she's been talking to you for a year about mandatory minimums. You've been saying no. Looks like we know who wears the pants in the Ziegler family.\n\nToby: You call your wife “Dr. Bartlet”?\n\nBartlet: Just for the turn-on.\n\nBartlet: We agree on nothing, Max.\n\nSenator Lobell: Yes, sir.\n\nBartlet: Education, guns, drugs, school prayer, gays, defense spending, taxes - you name it, we disagree.\n\nSenator Lobell: You know why?\n\nBartlet: Because I'm a lily-livered, bleeding-heart, liberal, egghead communist.\n\nSenator Lobell: Yes, sir. And I'm a gun-toting, redneck son-of-a-bitch.\n\nBartlet: Yes, you are.\n\nSenator Lobell: We agree about that.\n\nToby: Since when are you an expert on language?\n\nC.J.: In polling models?\n\nToby: Okay.\n\nC.J.: 1993. Since when are you an uptight pain in the ass?\n\nToby: Since long before that.\n\nBartlet: What do we do with him?\n\nSam: Make him the Ambassador to Paraguay.\n\nBartlet: What do we do with the Ambassador to Paraguay?\n\nSam: Make him Ambassador to Bulgaria.\n\nBartlet: I like this. Because, if everybody keeps moving up one, I can go home.\n\nBartlet: Toby, are you in here sticking up for Sam?\n\nToby: I know it's strange, sir. But I'm feeling a... a certain... big brotherly connection right now. You know, obviously, I'd like that feeling to go away as soon as possible, but for the moment I think there's no danger in the White House standing by Sam and aggressively going after the people who set him up.\n\nAmbassador Cochran: I'm sorry to do this, but I'd like to speak to your supervisor.\n\nCharlie: Well, I'm Personal Aide to the President, so my supervisor's a little busy right now trying to find a back door to this place to shove you out of, but I'll let him know you'd like to lodge a complaint.\n\nBartlet: Here’s another one. Two politicians are having an argument. One of them stands up and says, \"You’re lying!\" The other one answers, \"Yes, I am, but hear me out.\" [audience laughs]\n\nModerator: Mr. President, do you have time for one more question?\n\nBartlet: I don’t think I answered the last one. Suzanne’s got me telling jokes. Here’s an answer to your question that I don’t think you’re going to like: the current crop of 18–25-year-olds is the most politically apathetic generation in American history. In 1972, half of that age group voted. In the last election, 32%. Your generation is considerably less likely than any previous one to write or call public officials, attend rallies, or work on political campaigns. A man once said this, \"decisions are made by those who show up.\" So are we failing you, or are you failing us? It's a little of both.\n\nJosh: [while jogging] There was a reckless deregulation of the S&L industry by a Democratic Congress, it was flooded with S&L donations. A disaster which nearly collapsed the banking industry and cost the taxpayers 500 billion dollars.\n\nHoynes: What's your point?\n\nJosh: We're no better with the money than they are.\n\nHoynes: Tell me about it.\n\nJosh: Three-quarters of all soft money coming to the Democratic party isn't coming from labor unions, it's coming from corporations.\n\nHoynes: Yes, I know.\n\nJosh: Over a hundred businesses gave both parties in excess of $125,000 in the last election.\n\nHoynes: I know.\n\nJosh: They gave it to both parties! This isn't free speech or political values, Mr. Vice President. I don't know how we've done it, but we've legalized bribery.\n\nHoynes: Yup.\n\nJosh: So, now what we've got is two corporate parties - one pro-life, one pro-choice.\n\nHoynes: Josh, like I said, what's your point? I mean, what's your point?\n\nJosh: We've noticed the sudden increase in racquetball and late-night poker games with democratic opponents of campaign finance reform.\n\nHoynes: Come on, Josh, this is Washington, DC. You can't swing a dead cat without hitting a Democratic opponent of campaign finance reform.\n\nJosh: Can we stop running for a second? [They stop running] You're backing the wrong horse. You read the same polls I do. President's gone up nine points in three weeks. 51% job approval - big deal. But he's going on national television tonight, that's going to be another 5 that's 56%, a 14-point bump in a month.\n\nHoynes: Look, Josh...\n\nJosh: Hang on. If we bring this pilot back home alive, that's another 10 points. And then we're off to the races with a job approval rating in the high 60s. Now every Democratic congressman in a tight race is looking to get his picture taken with the president, and you're looking around the racquetball court, saying, \"Where did everybody go?\" You've had some experience battling Jed Bartlet when he's right, and you've had some experience battling him when he's popular. Why in the world would you want to try it when he's both at the same time?\n\nHoynes: You know something, Josh, sometimes I wonder if I'd listened to you two years ago, would I be President right now? Do you ever wonder that?\n\nJosh: No sir, I know it for sure.\n\nC.J.: Danny, I don't even want to hear it. I did exactly the right thing. Your nose is bent out of joint, and I don't give a damn.\n\nDanny: You looked at me point-blank and told me you were looking at a diplomatic...\n\nC.J.: Danny...\n\nDanny: You looked at me and told me...\n\nC.J.: What did you think I was going to do, Danny? Give you longitude and latitude? Did you think I was going to fork over the radio frequency that we're transmitting on?\n\nDanny: You didn't have to answer the question.\n\nC.J.: I did!\n\nDanny: You could have said, \"Danny, we're not ruling anything in or out, and I'm not going to let you take me down that path\" and we would have been done with it.\n\nC.J.: Danny, if by standing up and lying, I misdirected Iraqi intelligence for even half a beat, then it was absolutely worth it. That's a no-brainer. And if I didn't, it was certainly worth trying. There were only 50 people in the world who can't understand why I lied this morning, and they all work in the White House pressroom. I'm sleeping fine tonight.\n\nDanny: You didn't have to call on me. Every hand shot up, everybody's hand shot up, everybody was going to ask the same question, you knew what your answer was going to be, and you called on me.\n\nC.J.: Well, yes, I did.\n\nDanny: And you wouldn't have rather done that to a journalist that's been less supportive of this administration than I have?\n\nC.J.: No, I chose you.\n\nDanny: C.J., I'm not staying in the penalty box forever. I have covered the White House for eight years and I've done it with the New York Times, the Washington Post, Time Magazine, and the Dallas Morning News! And I'm telling you you can't mess me around like this!\n\nC.J.: Danny, I just gotta tell you, that was - seriously - that was a turn-on when you said that, though I don't know why you decided to be your most haughty on the Dallas Morning News in that sentence.\n\nBartlet: You're not going to spoil my good time for me.\n\nMrs. Landingham: Oh, sir, I think we both know from experience that's not true.\n\nBartlet: Yeah.\n\nMrs. Landingham: You need to be in the car ten minutes ago, Mr. President.\n\nBartlet: Do you see me walking out the door?\n\nMrs. Landingham: No, I see you standing and arguing with a senior citizen.\n\nBartlet: They’re telling me that we’re out of time. I just want to mention that at several points during the evening, I was referred to as both a liberal and a populist, and a fellow fourth from the back called me a socialist, which is nice, I haven’t heard that for a while. Actually, I’m an economics professor. My great-grandfather’s great-grandfather was Dr. Josiah Bartlett, who was "
