        "text": "Major Margaret “Hot Lips” Houlihan (Objecting to a wounded North Korean soldier in the O.R.): That man is a prisoner of war, doctor!\n\nCaptain “Trapper” John McIntyre: So are you, sweetheart, but you don’t know it.\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nAfter you’ve read enough books about movies and interviews with people who make or star in them and seen enough “making of” home-video documentaries, certain essential truisms become manifest, and make sorting things out a little easier. One lesson I’ve learned is that nothing Dustin Hoffman has ever said about a movie is to be believed. (I’m not saying he’s a liar. I’m sure he believes every word he says.) Another is that Orson Welles, like Truman Capote, liked a good story better than reality. And yet another is that nearly everything Robert Altman had to say about MASH bears about as much relationship to reality as the contents of the Warren Report.*\n\nOne example, at random: Sally Kellerman’s famous shower scene. Gary Burghoff, who played “Radar” O’Reilly in the movie as well as the subsequent television series, has always said that to make her feel less self-conscious he jokingly proposed that everyone on the camera side in her line of sight strip too. Kellerman later said that when the tent flap raised up she saw Burghoff standing naked next to the camera, which the actor confirmed. But to hear Altman tell it on the MASH DVD commentary, it was his idea, and both he and Burghoff were nude. It’s a minor incident, I know, but after hearing Altman claim for two hours that everything that worked in MASH was his and everything he felt did not was due to someone else it was a blessed relief to go directly to The Godfather commentary track and hear Francis Ford Coppola giving credit to his cinematographer, his actors, his assistants and anyone else who contributed a line or a bit of business or made a suggestion that enriched his movie. Altman also never missed an opportunity to run down the Richard Hooker novel on which his movie was based, which he called bad and racist, or (especially) the subsequent television series… which he called bad and racist…\n\nOne can well understand Altman’s bitterness. He was paid only $75,000 for directing a movie that, made for less than $4 million reaped $40 million at the box office at the time of its release (back, as they say, when $40 million was real money) and eventually became, through the teevee show, a cash-cow that is still being milked. Further, not only did 20th Century-Fox not exhibit the integrity and basic decency required to reward Altman with even a nominal bonus for having made their biggest-grossing picture of the year and the third highest-grossing movie released in 1970 but his teenage son eventually racked up some $2 million for writing the lyrics to that movie’s theme song. Although Altman liked to claim the movie gave him something more than money — his career — from his consistent, sour comments on it, the financial deprivations of MASH clearly bugged him for the remainder of his life.\n\nAbout the book and the show, however, Robert Altman was full of shit.\n\nSince first picking up, at the age of 13, the novel attributed to Richard Hooker (the nom de plume of the physician Richard Hornberger, Jr. in collaboration with the journalist W.C. Heinz, who polished the manuscript) I have read MASH more times than any other book, and always with undiminished pleasure. It is true that Hornberger was a social conservative, although his novel does not necessarily reflect that. It is also the case that, having been drafted and sent to Korea in 1952 he missed the period, roughly 1950 — 1951, during which the M.A.S.H (Mobile Army Surgical Hospital) units were at their most mobile, so there is no “bug-out” in the book as there often were before he arrived, and which later memorably occurred in the television series. I will further attest that, yes, Hornberger’s novel (like the eventual movie and, for a single season, the show) contains a black doctor called Oliver Wendell Jones and nicknamed “Spearchucker” during his college years as a javelin thrower. But since he is as much a part of “The Swamp” as Hawkeye Pierce, “Trapper John” McIntyre or Duke Forrest, the Southerner with whom he reaches a mutually respectful accommodation, and is a superior surgeon in no way stereotyped or subservient, I have never felt any racial animus toward this character on the part of the author. Indeed, Dr. Jones is such a part of the fraternity of the Swamp he’s also in the two subsequent novels Hornberger wrote in the 1970s.† (Although the author is, I admit, rather freer in MASH with the ugly epithet “gook,” still in use in the Vietnam era, as well as, at least once, “Chink.”) As for the series, which the rock-ribbed Maine Republican Hornberger despised for its liberal attitudes, the charge by Altman of racism is even more absurd. The last thing Larry Gelbart, who developed the show for television, would have wanted to be associated with was a racist series; while I have yet to meet anyone who (aside from myself) remembers watching it, Gelbart parlayed his “M*A*S*H” success into a second, short-lived comedy series called “Roll Out!” in 1973 and which centered on the black supply drivers in World War II France, and that at a time when there were no other series on the American air featuring a majority-black cast. (Even that superliberal Norman Lear didn’t have one until 1974 when “Good Times” premiered.) At least Hornberger ascribes to the Korean locals the wider variety of jobs they performed in the camps, which the series largely ignored… as did, for all his talk of other people’s racism, Altman’s movie.\n\nAside from the foregoing, the content of the “M*A*S*H” series speaks for itself, as it did for 11 seasons on CBS. The television “M*A*S*H” can be criticized on a number of levels, not least of which was its increasing preachiness and concessions to the vanity of its stars — Loretta Swit’s terrible 1980s hairdos, for example, and the softening of her character to the point where she barely had a reason to exist. But to deem the show as Altman frequently (and reflexively?) did “racist,” is risible.\n\nExactly why the novel MASH appeals to me to the degree that I’ve re-read it repeatedly since 1974 is a bit of a mystery, one I’m not sure I can fully explain. In addition to my deep fondness for the characters Hornberger created and who have become beloved of, by now, generations of readers, movie audiences and television (and home video) viewers across the globe, I suppose I like the dryness of his prose style and the matter-of-fact tone even when he’s describing outrages both comic and dramatic, as well as the genuinely witty manner with which the Swampmen communicate and the sharp playfulness of their verbal acrobatics, a trait they share in a more self-conscious, deliberately humorous manner with the characters in Catch-22 whose burlesque of language is of course representative of Joseph Heller’s satirical use of vaudeville humor. I admire the oddball characters in the book, seldom as self-righteous as their cinematic and television counterparts. I like its episodic structure — Ring Lardner, Jr., who adapted it for the movies, quite rightly observed that it was less a novel than a collection of short stories featuring the same characters — and the way it, like the movie, begins with Hawkeye and Duke arriving in Korea and ends with their leaving. I appreciate the seriousness with which the operating theatre is treated because Hornberger, like Lardner and Altman and Gelbart, never loses sight of why these men are in Korea. And, frankly, the book simply makes me laugh, a lot. I do think the series bested Hornberger and Altman in one respect: Making explicit what Gelbart considered the material’s perfect existential conundrum, young surgeons patching up even younger soldiers to be sent to the hospitals of Seoul and Tokyo where they will be given fuller treatment and rehabilitation and, all too often, returned to active duty to be shot (or in any case, shot at) and bombed again.\n\nI suppose that, taken together, these novelistic factors simply exert a pull on my literary imagination that is irresistible. And that’s not to mention a few items not even the movie, for all its irreverence, dared to depict. I’m thinking partly of the way the Swampmen torment a staggeringly insensitive Protestant chaplain, partly of the way the “Painless Pole”‘s bout of impotence is resolved by dint of a blue ribbon tied around his prodigious appendage before he’s resurrected (Painless doesn’t know whether he went to Heaven or to Hell but wherever he was, he declares happily, “I won First Prize”) and mostly of the way Hawkeye and Duke raise the necessary tuition, room, board and travel expenses for their young houseboy Ho-Jon‡ to attend Pierce’s alma mater after he’s been drafted by the ROK Armed Forces, wounded in battle and fixed up by the Swampmen: By convincing Trapper John to grow out his beard and his locks, be photographed as Jesus, autograph hundreds of the subsequent snaps for sale as souvenirs and, kept perpetually drunk, be tied to a cross and dangled from a helicopter for personal appearances. It would undoubtedly have made a hilariously irreligious addition to the picture but even the sardonic atheist Lardner, whose only novel (The Ecstasy of Owen Muir) was an anti-clerical satire, wasn’t brave enough to include it in his screenplay and I doubt the lapsed-Catholic Altman could have gotten away with it on a studio picture in 1969 even if he’d tried.\n\nWhat Robert Altman did get away with in MASH was almost everything else, and which helped make the movie a cultural touchstone and a box-office phenomenon. Although thwarted in his attempt to make explicit that the picture was set in Vietnam (20th Century-Fox insisted on a “dedication scroll” making clear it was actually Korea) those who saw MASH when it was new and the increasingly hated war in Vietnam was raging fruitlessly and murderously on, especially its core youthful audience, had no difficulty drawing the inference.§ They understood that war is an obscenity beside which sexual pranks, irreligious commentary and four-letter words are as a few skinned knees to a holocaust. The things Altman, and Ingo Preminger, the movie’s producer, fought for, such as the bloody, sometimes painful and occasionally excruciating operating room scenes, were the things that mattered, and what MASH was about. (Gelbart and Gene Reynolds, the producer of the television series, had similar problems, at least in the early days of the show, with the suits at CBS.) The stark juxtaposition of humor with genuine horror, common now, was unique at the time. It’s intrinsic to the novel but, even for the late 1960s — the picture was filmed in 1969 but released in early 1970 — strikingly different from the then-current tone of movie comedy.\n\nMASH didn’t sound like other American movies of the time either; Altman placed small mobile microphones on many of his actors, enabling him to catch what was necessary of the overlapping dialogue in the group scenes, such as in the mess hall when Duke and Hawkeye arrive in camp. Then there were screwball bits like the Japanese recordings of popular American songs of the early ’50s from Radio Tokyo and the inane announcements on the camp P.A. system, an effect arrived at during editing, was carried through the picture and which reaches a dazzling apogee at the end, when the announcer nonchalantly informs us that, “Tonight’s movie has been… MASH” and introduces the actors over fast clips from their performances. (Please refrain when describing this to your friends from using the hack-word “meta.”) And while Altman did not write, nor reap the rewards of, the lyrics to the cleverly titled “Suicide is Painless,” the phrase was his, as were the song’s poker metaphors; the Painless Pole (John Schuck) runs a 24-hour poker game in his tent. The look of MASH was different too: Not merely Altman’s use of zooms or the pointed way he and Danford B. Greene edited the picture but the rich, grainy diffusion of the widescreen Panavision images arrived at by the director and his gifted cinematographer Harold E. Stine; the only comparably shot (and edited) contemporary American movie comedy I can think of is The Graduate of 1967. Stine had to be flexible, as when on the day of filming the “farewell dinner” for Painless his director got the idea to shoot it as a parody of Da Vinci’s Last Supper, complete unto Elliott Gould crooking his finger at John Schuck à la Judas Iscariot. Hornberger calls the stag party The Last Supper in his novel, and Lardner repeats the line in his screenplay, so the idea was there from the beginning. It just took Altman’s perverse visual genius to make it explicit.\n\nLardner, whose credit (and subsequent Oscar) as the picture’s screenwriter was pretty much the last nail in the coffin of Red Scare-era blacklisting, rightly objected to the needless slapstick at the beginning of the movie, when a supply sergeant gets into a physical altercation with a pair of MPs after Hawkeye drives off in one of his jeeps and wrongly to the football game, which he felt was too long and lent the wrong tone, as well as to Hawkeye (Donald Sutherland) and Duke (Tom Skerritt) taunting Frank Burns (Robert Duvall) by leading a group-sing of “Onward, Christian Soldiers.” (The pair sing it in his script, but others in the camp don’t pick up on it as they do in the movie.) As to the game, Hornberger spends an equivalent amount of time on it in his novel, and its antic spirit is a needed corrective to the alternative deluges of blood and boredom the surgeons are faced with, both in the book and in the movie. The scenarist was understandably upset when he finally saw a screening of the picture. I doubt he’d ever encountered anything like it, and the shock of seeing and hearing Altman’s revolutionary approach to the scenes and the dialogue must have been profound for a man who got his start writing movie scripts in the early 1940s. Lardner reevaluated MASH over time (his Academy Award surely helped there) and so presumably recognized that Altman did not alter the script so much as he and his cast enhanced and enlivened it. Despite his own narcissism, even Altman freely and repeatedly gave his screenwriter credit for the movie’s shape and form, and its success. Lardner cleverly fused the religious nut in Duke and Hawkeye’s tent in the book with Burns, for example, and the basic structure of the movie is his. Altman credited his writer as well with concocting the vicious but very funny sequence in which the Swampmen wire Hot Lips’ tent for sound and broadcast her assignation with Frank over the P.A. system. (Father Mulcahy: “Is this The Bickersons? I love them.”) On the other hand, I don’t know whether it was Altman or the actors who came up with the notion of Hawkeye and Trapper camping it up the morning after Frank and Hot Lips’ thwarted liaison, but it hasn’t aged well.\n\nThat isn’t the only example of dated “fag” humor in the picture. One area in which I fault Altman’s approach is the manner in which Painless reacts to his bout of temporary impotence in, respectively, the novel, the screenplay and the completed movie. Hornberger merely has Painless, a periodic depressive, listening to his prodigious appendage with Hawkeye’s stethoscope and announcing, “I think it’s dead.” Lardner has him assume that after an incident with a nurse in which he couldn’t achieve an erection he’s become “homosexual.” Altman and the movie’s Painless, John Schuck, up that ante (“Well… I’m a fairy”) which to their credit Hawkeye and the other doctors ridicule him for declaring on no evidence other than not being able to get it up a single time. This, in now-typical fashion, leads to current online ignoramuses writing that Painless “comes out as gay” to Hawkeye. Jesus, who breeds these idiots? And why?\n\nAside: Painless — or in any case, Schuck — is responsible in MASH for the first use of the word “fuck” in an American studio picture. Altman had instructed the actor to taunt his opponent on the football field and in a rehearsal ad lib Shuck barked, “All right, bub, your fuckin’ head is comin’ right off!” He had no idea Altman would use the take. Joan Tewkesbury, in the forward to her published Nashville screenplay, recalled the young 1970 audience exploding into cheers and applause when they heard that.¶\n\nThose who come to MASH only after years of watching the television series can quickly grow bemused or even confused that characters they knew during the show’s long lifetime (and even lengthier afterlife) are so different in the movie. As played by Alan Alda and initially written by Gelbart, Hawkeye Pierce in particular is warmer and less snide than in Donald Sutherland’s original performance. (Alda’s Hawkeye is also a bachelor.) Duke of course never made it to teevee, and Spearchucker lasted less than a season. Radar started out on the series more or less as he was in the picture — Gary Burghoff considered him “a sardonic little guy,” far from the naïve innocent he quickly evolved into on the show. And Lt. Colonel Henry Blake is vastly different from book and movie to series. Hornberger’s (and Lardner and Altman’s) Blake (Roger Bowen) is Regular Army, not a civilian doctor drafted into command as McLean Stevenson’s Henry was on television. While as sweet in his own confused way as his series doppelgänger (the gentle William Christopher) Father Mulcahy (René Auberjonois) is more bumbling in the movie where, with his ginger Irish hair he’s known as “Dago Red.” The character in the picture who is furthest from his teevee counterpart is Frank Burns; Duvall’s Burns is as sour, incompetent and self-righteous as Larry Linville’s on the show but not nearly as much of a ninny. And while Linville is a brilliant comic technician and, occasionally, less than despicable, there’s a deeply unpleasant quality to Duvall’s performance, and to the character as Lardner (and, earlier, Hornberger) envisioned him. Although, despite his loathsomeness and hypocrisy, Frank’s exit from the 4077th, strapped into a straight-jacket and escorted by MPs is, I would argue, not presented by Altman as intentionally humorous — Duvall, photographed behind the rising heat waves of a trash-barrel fire, appears utterly depressed and defeated and even Sutherland’s Hawkeye looks away — viewers whose responses to Burns are trained by years of Linville’s portrayal roar with laughter at the sight; it’s happened every time I’ve seen MASH with an audience, and I would very much like to know if moviegoers in 1970, well before the series took hold of the popular imagination, reacted the same way. Young audiences were so reflexively anti-establishment then that it’s certainly possible even if their current, older selves rush to defend lying hack politicians and government institutions and demand censorship when it doesn’t appear quickly enough to satisfy their well-honed sense of self-loathing. They’ve become Frank Burns.\n\nI don’t mean to suggest by my comments above that Sutherland is in any way a liability to the picture. In spite of his and his co-star’s discontent with Altman and attempts to get him replaced — for which Gould later apologized — the role of Hawkeye Pierce turned out to be a career-maker for Sutherland, who until then had been floating on the periphery of American movies. His persona as an actor tends to be dry and understated if not phlegmatic, entirely unlike Alan Alda’s, which sometimes makes him a bit of a chilly presence. Well, the Hawkeye Pierce of the novel isn’t the most ebullient character in the world either. Sutherland’s cool makes for a nice contrast with the warmer, scruffier appeal of Elliott Gould’s Trapper John and the half-cynical, half-perplexed Southern charm of Tom Skerritt’s Duke Forrest. Skerritt was even more of an unknown than Sutherland. (Gould was Ted in the 1969 Bob and Carol and Ted and Alice and had received an Academy Award nomination for his assured comic performance.) Tom Skerritt’s immense likability redeems a character who could have been a boor, especially in the early scenes where he is erotically aggressive to the exclusion of almost any other emotion and, later, a conventional Georgia bigot. Sally Kellerman’s Margaret Houlihan (called, curiously, “O’Houlihan” by both Roger Bowen and G. Wood’s General Hammond, but by no one else) is rigid and foolish but not silly, a complaint one could lodge against the TV version of her, at least in the early years, even as one was laughing at what Loretta Swit said and did. The movie’s “Hot Lips” becomes a bit silly, once her hard shell is softened, as when she leads cheers at the football match and seems utterly bewildered by the rules of the game. (Hot Lips: A red flag! We got a red flag! / Henry: It’s a penalty, you blithering idiots!)\n\nKellerman’s performance has very interesting curlicues, as when Trapper John is made Chief Surgeon and calls for sex, Lt. “Scorch” (Dawne Damon) is offered up to him and he points to Houlihan shouting, “No, no, no, that one — the sultry bitch with the fire in her eyes! Take her clothes off and bring her to me!” In Lardner’s script, “her eyes [are] blazing with indignation” but in the movie Kellerman’s flash with defiance… accompanied by a smirk of erotic interest. Kellerman’s Hot Lips takes the journey in under two hours that it took the producers of the TV “M*A*S*H” five seasons to achieve. By the end of the movie she’s not only relaxed, perhaps more than could reasonably have been expected, she’s succumbed to Duke’s charms; the look of panic she expresses with only her eyes at the news that he’s being discharged from the Army is remarkable, and gives the character a sudden and unexpected aura of emotional vulnerability. Her best scene, of course, is just after the shower revelation, when she demands that Henry court-martial the Swampmen (“This isn’t a hospital, it’s an insane asylum…”) Altman cannily had Kellerman do the scene directly after she’d gone through the shower sequence, when the actress’s emotions were still on edge and it’s among the pictures’ most indelible moments. I suspect it was this hysterical monologue, and the look of utter disbelief on her face when Henry dismisses her, that got Kellerman her Academy Award nomination.\n\nThe company Altman assembled for MASH in 1969 may well have been the best ensemble cast seen in an American comedy in three decades, or since His Girl Friday in 1940, and even there the range of characters was much smaller. I don’t think there have ever been as many “Introducing” credits in a movie before or since, and many of those actors went on to decades of success in movies, television and (in the case of René Auberjonois) theatre. Roger Bowen’s Henry Blake is not the lovable klutz played so memorably by McLean Stevenson; he’s Regular Army yet easily manipulated by the Swampmen and almost pathetically eager to speechify (“Ever since the dark days before Pearl Harbor I have proudly worn this uniform…”) Auberjonois’ Mulcahy is as well-meaning as William Christopher’s eventual teevee iteration but more tenuously connected to the world; he stumbles around in a gentle daze, equally fearful of giving offense to man and God. In the instantly infamous group revelation of Hot Lips Houlihan’s true hair color his first response is to shield Ho-Jon’s eyes, and he’s terrified of giving absolution to the would-be suicide Painless, even though he knows, as Painless doesn’t, that the whole thing is a charade. It was Auberjonois who discovered the blessing for a chariot and suggested he speak it over Duke and Hawkeye’s jeep at the end, sure that Altman would love it. (He did.)\n\nDavid Arkin is very funny as Blake’s ineffectual aid Vollmer, the unexpected hero of the football game, whom no one in camp respects or heeds and who is heard (along with Marvin Miller and, supposedly, Ted Knight) throughout the picture reading the absurdly gung-ho war-movie come-ons and administrative announcements over the P.A. system, some of which Altman altered from actual memos at Fox. For the series, Gelbart and Reynolds essentially conflated Vollmer and Radar and made him less officious, as Arkin is, than un-worldly. My only complaint about Altman’s otherwise nearly perfect casting has to do with Carl Gottlieb as the anesthesiologist “Ugly John.” This has nothing to do with Gottlieb’s performance but with what seems an almost deliberate misunderstanding of the character’s name. As Hornberger makes clear in the novel, “Ugly John” got his name from being the handsomest man at the 4077th. (At least Gottlieb is, while heavy, reasonably attractive. The casting of the undeniably homely John Orchard, who played the role during the first season of the television series, almost seems cruel by comparison.) Especially notable among the supporting ensemble are the charming Jo Ann Pflug as Lt. “Dish”; the strikingly beautiful Indus Arthur as Henry’s bed-mate Leslie; Ken Prymus singing “Suicide is Painless” during The Last Supper and grinning with the pleasure of performance even as the words he’s vocalizing are wholly to do with death; Fred Williamson, remarkably assured in his movie debut; the understated Michael Murphy as “Me Lay” Marston; Bud Cort as the gullible Private Boone; Dale Ishimoto, splendid as the doctor examining Ho-Jon at the Korean induction center; and the songwriter Bobby Troup as the beleaguered sergeant whose response to the golf-happy Hawkeye and Trapper John is to repeat the concise phrase, “Goddamn army.”\n\nI have written elsewhere that, while I am a militant anti-auteurist, at least as regards non-writer/directors, Robert Altman tends to be the exception to every one of my rules. I was disgusted the other day to stumble across one of those ridiculous internet polls on movies, this one listing Altman as “the 34th greatest director of all time.” I was too dispirited by this to look any further, but I’d be willing to bet that Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese both placed in the top ten, if not the top five. I’m not claiming that Altman deserves the ultimate slot — I don’t know who does, nor do I care especially — but if it isn’t John Ford or Orson Welles or Francis Coppola or Robert Altman, I also don’t know what greatness means any longer. Of all American sound film directors, only these four it seems to me were genuine poets, and seeing their best work not only alters the way one views movies, it alters the viewer.**\n\nNot that there is a great deal of poetry on display in MASH; its tone is too antic, and subversive. There’s nothing in it that rivals the image of Warren Beatty dying in the snow or Julie Christie’s faraway opium gaze at the end of McCabe and Mrs. Miller, or the women listening to Keith Carradine singing “I’m Easy” in Nashville, or the dreamlike imagery of 3 Women, or the haunting juxtaposition of the funeral rites that begin Vincent and Theo with, on the soundtrack, the multi-million dollar auction of Van Gogh’s “Sunflowers” with its privileged fiscal obscenity, the figures rising ever higher as Vincent’s body is placed in a pauper’s grave. But if ever a filmmaker’s identifiable, idiosyncratic touch is evident from the opening frames of a movie, it’s here. Audiences in 1970 couldn’t have known of course that Robert Altman’s highly individualistic aural and visual aesthetic was, essentially, being unveiled in MASH, but two or three pictures later those elements were obvious and recurrent enough to be considered a personal style. Altman was amused at having become an adjective, and bemused by how often the term “Altmanesque” concerned externals only. But this is the way of such things. What people generally mean by that neologism is items like overlapping dialogue, slow camera zooms, an improvisatory approach (which does not mean letting actors improvise during a take) and ensemble acting. What isn’t considered as often is tone, and the filmmaker’s humanist concerns.\n\nGelbart always credited Altman with the look of the TV “M*A*S*H,” naturally achieved in miniature, and the series opening is essentially a paraphrase of the movie’s credit sequence, helicopters flying the wounded into the 4077th and the personnel on the ground scrambling to get these damaged bodies to Pre-Op. And if the hills and even the camp itself look uncannily like those of the movie it’s because the series was shot on the picture’s standing sets, and in the hills of what was then the Fox location ranch and is now the Malibu Creek State Park. (The exterior of the Swamp is clearly the same, right down to the Moorish hex symbol painted on the door, but Hawkeye’s gin still is original to the series.) Set designs aside, Altman’s sensibilities are all over MASH, mostly to the good. The innovative use of sound was a key part of his technical approach and I’ve always been taken with the way during Duke and Hawkeye’s discussion with Henry Blake about getting in a chest surgeon the filmmaker cuts to the men on duty in a very busy (and very bloody) Pre-Op while the dialogue continues on the soundtrack, the Swampmen’s point about being understaffed made explicit by the vivid juxtaposition of word and image. Or take the way during the eavesdropping on Frank Burns and Hot Lips the P.A. system attains a disturbing, echoey sound that matches the would-be lovers’ panic. Or how, when the generator fails and plunges the O.R. into blackness and nurses appear with flashlight torches, the doctors begin singing “When the Lights Go On Again (All Over the World.)” Altman’s Operating Room is not only bloodier than the O.R. of the television series, it’s noisier. When Hawkeye is amputating a leg, we hear the sound of the saw cutting through bone. When suction is applied by a nurse, that is heard as well.\n\nAltman was light on his feet throughout the filming, adapting to take advantage of happy accidents, such as the crashed helicopter in the background during the scene in which the doctors question whether Major Houlihan is a natural blonde. (A Fox pilot had crashed the ‘copter; he was unhurt.) In this Altman resembles Orson Welles, as indeed does his concern with sound. When Hawkeye and Trapper John return from golfing in Tokyo wearing plus fours and are immediately engulfed in wounded patients, the director films them at floor level from the calves up amid scrap buckets, blood and gore. (He claimed he wasn’t interested in filming the Tokyo sequence until he saw that image. Yet another load, if you’ll forgive me, of patented Altman bullshit. Why were they wearing those duds if they hadn’t gone golfing in Japan?) Occasionally an attempt at indirection is strained, as when Lt. Dish leaves for home, seemingly in a fury at having been conned by Hawkeye into sleeping with the well-endowed Painless Pole after his “suicide” until, airborne in a helicopter, she looks directly into the lens and grins delightedly.\n\nA much more effective feint is Duke’s homecoming fantasy when Hawkeye announces their orders have come through. It was, in imitation of the novel, in Lardner’s screenplay, but as a realistic scene. Making it purely imaginary is a marvelous touch, as is the improvement on Hornberger in the mess scene in which Hawkeye tells off Major Houlihan and she asks, to the world at large, “I wonder how a degenerated person like that could have reached a position of responsibility in the Army Medical Corps?” In the book, and in Lardner’s screenplay, the question is addressed to Hawkeye who replies, “Sister, if I knew the answer to that, I sure as hell wouldn’t be here.” How much richer, funnier and more satisfying, in the movie, is Father Mulcahy’s simple declaration, “He was drafted.” Curiously, it was not Lardner who gave Kellerman the line that forever connects Margaret Houlihan to her nickname (“Oh, Frank, my lips are hot! Kiss my hot lips!”) He did, however, go further in his script than Altman as far as vulgarity is concerned when, speculating on the color of Hot Lips’ pubic hair Duke opines that he prefers “blonde pussy.” But had there been heard in any movie before MASH the sound of women leading a cheer for a numbered football player (Tim Brown in this case) with the words, “69 is divine!”?\n\nMy cavils about the way Altman put MASH together are so few it almost feels churlish to mention them. The O.R. scene where Trapper John gives Houlihan a backhanded compliment (“Hot Lips, you may be a pain in the ass but you’re a damn good nurse”) and she murmurs, “Thanks, Trapper” precedes the shower scene but the change in her character feels like something that should occur much later in the movie, before the football game. That’s a continuity flaw; my other complaints concern content. When “Dago Red” asks how he enjoyed his visit to Tokyo Trapper’s response (“I screwed a Kabuki dancer”) is appalling. Mulcahy isn’t Frank Burns. Why insult the poor man that way? Similarly, there’s a terrible moment of Hawkeye and Trapper babbling in mock-Japanese on their arrival in Tokyo which, judging from the way what Sutherland and Gould say in voice-over in no way matches what the actors are speaking on film, was a deliberate after-thought by Altman. This from the man who constantly accused Richard Hornberger and Larry Gelbart of racism?\n\nAs an example of Robert Altman’s perversity, nothing concerning MASH exceeds the germination of what may be its most recognized element: Johnny Mandel’s theme, replicated in hundreds of television episodes and far and away the melody for which its versatile composer is best known. When he conceived the need for a song to send Painless off, Altman very cannily selected the theme (death), the central metaphor (poker) and a title that brought together the name of Schuck’s character with the notion of suicide. Yet he insisted that it ought to be “the stupidest song ever written,” for which his “idiot son” should write the lyrics. Mandel later said he had to get drunk to set Mike Altman’s lyrics which, even if do they revolve around an assonant near-rhyme (“Suicide is painless/It brings on many changes…”) are strikingly mature to have come from the mind and imagination of a 14-year old. Yet his father clearly wanted a deliberately bad song, with “stupid” music. Would anyone still be humming Mandel’s melody if Altman had gotten what he asked for?\n\nTo the director’s credit, he was impressed enough by the song to have it recorded for the main title sequence, where “Suicide is Painless” benefited enormously from the superb orchestrations by Herbert W. Spencer. Think of how softly it begins, with strummed acoustic guitar chords in B minor interspersed with finger cymbal chimes and eventual strings and percussion, wrapped around a Brian Wilson-style vocal. The song, and that particular arrangement of it, are so good it is astonishing to see what other movie songs in 1970 got the Oscar nomination Mandel and Mike Altman didn’t. I have no quarrel with “For All We Know” from Lovers and Other Strangers, the eventual winner, nor with the magnificent Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer song “Whistling Away the Dark” from Darling Lili, nor for that matter with Leslie Bricusse’s sardonic “Thank You Very Much” from Scrooge. But can anyone tell me why two numbers no one remembers (“Till Love Touches Your Life” from something called Madron, and “Pieces of Dreams,” from, as they used to say, the film of the same name) were doing on the list even if the latter was by Michel Legrand and Alan Bergman and Marilyn Bergman?\n\nMandel, one of the most original voices of his era, was not only a superb craftsman who could with equal invention assay pictures as disparate as The Americanization of Emily, The Sandpiper (for which he and Paul Francis Webster won Best Song for “The Shadow of Your Smile”), Harper, The Russians Are Coming The Russians Are Coming, Point Blank, Escape to Witch Mountain, The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea, Agatha and The Verdict; he was also an accomplished jazz performer and composed one of the few true jazz (as opposed to jazzy or jazz-inspired) movie scores, for I Want to Live! Although his MASH score is brief it includes the most felicitous of several military marches he composed for movies (it takes off neatly from Alfred Newman’s 20th Century-Fox fanfare), a hilariously sanctified accompaniment for Lt. Dish’s unveiling of the Painless Pole’s stupendous accoutrement, deliberately melodramatic underscore for the scene in Tokyo where Hawkeye and Trapper confront the MPs with a mock-serious invocation of spy movie clichés, and an amusing gallop for the football game, complete with slide-whistle. Good comedy scores that do not attempt to be humorous through lugubrious mickeymousing are rare. Genuinely witty ones are the unicorns of cinematic euphony.\n\nRather shockingly, while MASH received five Academy Award nominations including Picture and Director, it was not nominated for its highly distinctive — and, for its time, revolutionary — sound. And speaking of such things: I was astounded several years ago while leafing through the MusicHound soundtrack guide to note that the MASH soundtrack album was given the lowest rating (a “Woof!”) while the author of the brief review claimed that the LP was pointless and that one might listen to it once but not twice. I grant you that when I got my copy in 1974 and listened to the record incessantly I was a MASH-crazy 13-year-old (and home-video in the form of cassettes or laserdiscs did not yet exist for most Americans.) But as a keepsake of the movie, I don’t see how the Columbia producer Thomas Z. Shepard’s calculatedly messy album could be bettered. Shepard, who for years afterward was Sondheim’s indispensable cast album producer, understood instinctively what Altman had wrought, and replicated it as a listening experience. The dialogue excerpts were not only well chosen, they were edited brilliantly, even dazzlingly, into the whole, creating a small masterpiece of comedic collage. If nothing else Shepard isolated some key lines in the football sequence in a way I wish Altman had — so they can actually be heard.\n\nText copyright 2002 by Scott Ross\n\n*The picture, like the book on which it was based, was called MASH, not M*A*S*H.

Hornberger was infuriated when the movie took off because he’d sold his rights for a mere few thousand dollars — in that he certainly resembled Robert Altman — so in addition to the millions of Pocket Books paperback reissue copies that continued to sell well into the ’80s these “sequel” novels, even if he didn’t write a word of them, were a good means to fast cash for him as the copyright holder.\n\n‡Ho-Jon’s arrival at the 4077th as a war casualty was part of a subplot cut from MASH before its release. Supposedly his dead body was originally removed during the football game sequence, and while one appreciates the filmmakers’ juxtaposition of high-powered leisure activity with grim reality, the moment would surely have destroyed the comedy of the ball game and brought down the entire picture. (Lardner’s screenplay contains a sad, ambiguous moment when a recurrence of his wound is deemed inoperable, but not the boy’s subsequent death.) Interestingly, the North Korean soldier on the operating table is not Kim Atwood, but Atwood is clearly who is subsequently being operated on. It seems obvious that Altman and his editors were forced to splice two separate sequences together for the sake of continuity, but considering the director’s wanton attributions of racism to Hooker, Gelbart and everyone else, there is a whiff of “they all look alike” in the confusion of the North Korean and the former Swamp houseboy. Parenthetically, “Ho-Jon” is allegedly not a Korean name.\n\n§The hats worn by what the U.S. military is pleased to call “indigenous personnel” during the Seoul sequence are deliberately incorrect, as Altman insisted they be Vietnamese and not Korean, even though Hawkeye jokingly says the boy should go to the head of the line because he’s one of Korean president Syngman Rhee’s sons and all radio news stories heard on the soundtrack are datelined Korea. So much, once again, for Robert Altman’s claims. That scroll, which includes one of Dwight D. Eisenhower’s more famous election pledges, reminds me of something Gore Vidal once said of him: “Eisenhower always read his campaign speeches with a real sense of discovery. ‘And if elected… I will go to Korea?!?‘”\n\n¶Being too young to have seen MASH in a theater I had to make do with the autumn 1974 “CBS Friday Night Movies” airing of it which was of course heavily censored. Given the soundtrack album for Christmas, when I heard Schuck say that line the top of my 13-going-on-14-year old’s head nearly came off. I finally got to see the picture on a big screen a year or so later and was bitterly disappointed that it had been re-cut for a “PG” rating, the word “fuckin'” dropped out on the soundtrack (and the Hot Lips shower scene truncated, as well as some of the OR gore). It wasn’t that I had a prurient interest in hearing “fuck” in a movie — this was the ’70s after all and the “R”-rated American pictures I was getting in to see then were becoming routinely more profane, as was the popular fiction I was then reading — but I did want to see my movies, if I was experiencing them in a theater rather than on a TV set, unadulterated. I saw the picture subsequently several times in this bowdlerized fashion, in theaters and on cable, before Fox finally released the original, un-tampered-with MASH on home video. Similarly, when the picture was re-released in 1973 (along with the reissue of the 1970 soundtrack LP I was given in ’74) someone removed the “Suicide is Painless” vocal from the main title of both movie and record and replaced it with Ahmad Jamal’s funky (and identically-timed) instrumental. Fortunately, the vocal was eventually reinstated in the picture. An eventual CD release of the soundtrack includes both.\n\n**Note that I said both “sound” and “American.” The poets of silent film range from D.W. Griffith and King Vidor to Buster Keaton and his collaborators, and there is no shortage of great, poetic filmmakers, sound and silent, in world cinema.\n\nPost-Script, January 2023\n\nAnent my comments above, in the footnote section, on the M*A*S*H Goes to… novels of the 1970s attributed to William E. Butterworth and Richard Hooker: I attempted over the holidays to re-read them for the first time since the age of 14 or 15, and had to give it up as a bad job after two and a half titles, leaving nine-and-a-half unread. If Hooker wrote any of the material in them, the only trace of his style (and medical expertise) I can find in the books are the occasional passages involving surgical procedure. What Butterworth, their apparent actual author, is chiefly concerned with is depicting convoluted and determinedly “wacky” scenarios involving versions of Hawkeye, Trapper John and “Hot Lips” Houlihan that bear little relation to their previous literary counterparts (and none at all to their television versions) with a growing, and increasingly annoying, supporting cast including an obnoxious Russian-American opera singer, two bumbling New Orleans-based reporters, a sexually suspect diplomat, a gaggle of alcoholic (and extremely unfunny) Cajuns and — God help us — a largely benign, German-inflected, Yiddish-prone American Secretary of State who can only be a comic rendition of that Teutonic psychopath Henry Kissinger. Even worse (if such can be imaged) the social and “comedic” attitudes exhibited by Butterworth, a genuine hack who under the pen-name W.E.B. Griffin published nearly 60 military-themed thrillers, are stuck in some weird, reactionary world where women are either brainless sex-pots, alternately cooing and screeching, or suspicious sitcom-like hausfraus, militant man-hating “libbers” and/or “radical” lefties, while gay men are “exquisitely mannered,” wispy little queens or sex-mad, prissy faggots. Butterworth’s moving of the action in these books to the 1970s also makes hay of the characters’ original ages; “Hot Lips,” for example, is described by Hooker/Hornberger in MASH as being “fortyish,” making her, if you care to extrapolate, “sixtyish” in the books although still depicted as a hot, stacked number lusted after by many. At the beginning of the second book (M*A*S*H Goes to Paris) Hawkeye and his wife Mary are expecting another child, although both would be, in Hooker’s chronology, in their 50s. One almost gets the idea, reading these novels, that time has in some weird way frozen since 1951, although Henry Blake shows up periodically as a Major-General. Based on the first three titles, the series is about as ugly a betrayal of the affections of M*A*S*H aficionados as can be imagined. Butterworth even renames Walter “Radar” O’Reilly “Robespierre,” and Hooker lets him get away with it. Robespierre O’Reilly?!?\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nSee also: Part One\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/03/03/the-magic-factory-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-an-annotated-list-part-one-actors-and-animation/\n\nPart Two\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/06/the-magic-factory-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-an-annotated-list-part-two-criticism-and-filmmakers/\n\nPart Four\n\nhttps://scottross79.wordpress.com/2022/04/16/the-magic-factory-part-four-an-annotated-list-of-a-few-essential-books-about-the-movies-individual-films-and-miscellaneous-titles/\n\nNote the First: I do not by any means claim that this list, which I am posting in installments, is either exhaustive or definitive. It’s merely obsessive. And highly personal. This is my list, based on my experience, my likes and prejudices and my reading, Your list will differ wildly. I merely mean to recommend a few books that influenced me and that you might also enjoy.\n\nNote the Second: Although the list, when it’s finished, is meant to add up to 100, I am going to fiddle outrageously with the numbers. When within a particular category a writer has a number of titles, or a series of books, or I mention a volume by someone else on the same topic, I will count them all as one entry. It’s my party, and I’ll cheat if I want to.\n\nV. Screenwriters and Screenwriting\n\nWhen I refer to myself as an anti-auteurist I realize I may be creating some confusion, since it should be obvious to the casual reader of these pages that I also honor a number of favored filmmakers. Most of these, however, are or were either writer-directors (Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Preston Sturges, John Huston, Orson Welles, Billy Wilder, Samuel Fuller, Blake Edwards, Paul Mazursky, Robert Benton, Oliver Stone); directors who could have taken screenwriter credit on almost any movie they made, and sometimes did (David Lean, Peter Bogdanovich, Sidney Lumet); almost never did (Alfred Hitchcock); never did (Leo McCarey, Howard Hawks); or who habitually worked closely with screenwriters to develop the movies they directed (Ford, Cukor, William Wyler, Martin Ritt, John Schlesinger). Perhaps it’s a limitation in me, but I have never been able to fathom how so many movie critics could embrace the misrepresentation of the French theory — which was far more selective and referred only to certain filmmakers — and warp it, as Andrew Sarris did, to suggest that every movie director is the “author” of any picture he or she makes. And my mystification is centered on one simple fact: That critics are writers too. Why are they so hot to strip the credit from others?\n\nAs a result of this madness, any hack or beginner can slap a possessive credit on a movie, even if the script he’s shooting is the seventeenth draft of a screenplay that’s been re-written by a dozen different writers, only two or three of whom will likely be credited. Look up any movie title on any online search engine and when it pops up the first entry will read, “A film by…” Nearly as bad, even as great a home video producer as Criterion reflexively places either that or an apostrophe and an “s” on the cover of every disc, even when to do so is patently absurd, as in its release of the 1952 The Importance of Being Earnest which it describes as “Anthony Asquith’s.” Surely the possessive attribution is due to Oscar Wilde? After all, even the New Testament admits that in the beginning was the word. But then the Word was God’s, and for an auteurist that can only mean a director.\n\n48. Adventures in the Screen Trade: A Personal View of Hollywood and Screenwriting William Goldman (1983)\n\nIt is entirely appropriate that the first volume on this list be Goldman’s, because no other screenwriter had or has ever written a book which became, and so quickly, immortal, at least in Hollywood. Goldman had already bequeathed to the world an epigraph — “Follow the money” — that is now so much a part of the common language it is routinely cited in reference to corruption by people who have no idea what its provenance is. (And it was Goldman, not “Deep Throat,” who came up with the phrase, in his screenplay for All the President’s Men.) To this he added a new one, which caught on so quickly it’s employed by the very sort of smug people its author was talking about when he first wrote it: In coining the dictum “Nobody knows anything,” Goldman was asserting that, essentially, all movies that become hits, unless they are sequels to other hits, are what is dismissively referred to as a “non-recurring phenomenon.” No one ever knows what will succeed, or fail, and those who think they do are in for some nasty surprises. Goldman also wrote a tertiary epigraph which is much less often quoted, but which should be tattooed on the inner eyelids of every screenwriter: “Screenplays are structure.” But they are not, as so many ignoramuses aver, “blueprints.” Change a blueprint while you’re building and see how well the construction stands.\n\nYou may agree or disagree with Goldman’s other observations (I for instance love the movie the writer/director Philip Kaufman made from Tom Wolfe’s The Right Stuff, and would not have wanted to see the flag-waving version Goldman wrote) or see him as a facile, talented smart-ass. I don’t know how his novels, which I began to devour at age 15, might read for a younger audience, but I like his writing, both for print and movies, too much to find fault with much of it, although I do admit to being one of the few people I know who isn’t gaga over the movie of The Princess Bride, perhaps because I cherish the novel. In any case, it’s a safe bet no screenwriter will ever create, with a book, the stir Goldman did with this one.\n\n49. Backstory 1: Interviews with Screenwriters of Hollywood’s Golden Age / Backstory 2: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1940s and 1950s / Backstory 3: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 60s and Backstory 4: Interviewers with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s Edited by Patrick McGilligan (1988 – 2006)\n\nOne of our finest biographers of moviemakers, McGilligan also conducted (or edited those conducted by others) dozens of interviews with American screenwriters and published these in five volumes over 21 years. The Backstory series includes discussions with Niven Busch, Alan Scott (author or co-writer of many of the witty scripts for the Astaire-Rogers pictures), Donald Ogden Stewart, Philip Dunne, Julius J. Epstein, Richard Maibaum, Leigh Brackett, Betty Comden and Adolph Green, Garson Kanin, Arthur Laurents, the blacklisted Ben Maddow, Stewart Stern, the ubiquitous blacklistee front Philip Yordan, Jay Presson Allen, George Axelrod, Walter Bernstein, Hitchcock’s great 1950s screenwriter John Michael Hayes, Ring Lardner Jr., Richard Matheson, Wendell Mayes, Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank Jr., Sterling Silliphant, Terry Southern, Robert Benton, Blake Edwards, Walter Hill, Ruth Prawer Jhabvala, Elmore Leonard, Paul Mazursky, Frederic Raphael, Alvin Sargent and Donald E. Westlake. That’s practically the entire history of the talkies to the turn of the century.\n\nI have not read McGilligan’s 2009 volume (Backstory 5: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1990s) largely because I have so little interest in movies of the 1990s. Once, in real time, was more than sufficient.\n\n50. Talking Pictures: Screenwriters in the American Cinema Richard Corliss (1975)\n\nUnique in its time, and even to today, Corliss’ second book on movie writers is a perceptive series of essays grouping together scenarists and their representative scripts — a sort of critical bestiary of screenwriters. Amid Corliss’ piquant observations: Anent the 1970 movie of MASH for which the blacklisted Ring Lardner, Jr. won an Oscar, that the much-loved Hawkeye and Trapper John often behave like fraternity bullyboys, no better than their adversaries and in some ways worse. Among his discoveries: That letters form such a strong narrative thread in the movies written or co-authored by Howard Koch (such as Casablanca) they are almost a personal signature.\n\nSee also: The Hollywood Screenwriters (A Film Comment Book) Richard Corliss (1972) The first of Corliss’ books on screenwriting is a collection of essays and interviews which, in Dr. Roseanne Welch’s apt words, “was a seminal work… in terms of bringing the screenwriter out from under the director’s shadow following a decade of auteurist criticism run rampant.” Frustratingly, in a 1990s issue of Film Comment Corliss repudiated his own 1970s defense of screenwriters. Oh, well; he also around that time began using the teenage neologism “way” in place of the perfectly acceptable and grammatically effective “much,” “far” and “more” which had sufficed for centuries. As, alas, did every other adult in America.\n\n51. The Hollywood Writers’ Wars Nancy Lynn Schwartz; Completed by Sheila Schwartz (1982)\n\nIf there is an essential volume of screenwriting history, the Schwartzes’ book is it. A wide-ranging account of the oft-thwarted attempt of a majority of scenarists to set up a union, the vicious opposition of the studios — which set up Screen Playwrights, their own, reactionary union, one most writers, quite properly, disdained or chafed under the yoke of — and the ultimate triumph of the Screen Writers Guild. The only sad thing about The Hollywood Writers’ Wars is that its author did not live to complete it, dying in agony of a brain tumor at an obscenely young age.\n\n52. Laughing Matters: On Writing M*A*S*H, Tootsie, Oh, God! and a Few Other Funny Things Larry Gelbart (1998)\n\nWith the possible exceptions of Ben Hecht and Billy Wilder, I don’t know of a wittier American writer of screenplays than Larry Gelbart, or a more verbally elegant one. (As a playwright and librettist he was scarcely less impressive, writing with Burt Shevelove the achingly funny book for A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, and, solo, the hilarious one for the Cy Coleman musical City of Angels, the great Iran-Contra satire Mastergate, the funny and terrifying Power Failure and the Volpone-inspired Sly Fox, the single funniest playscript I’ve ever read.) Although his range was great his comic work is marked by two related attributes: His general literacy, and his gift for malaprop, usually in the service of overturning a verbal cliché. Recently, while watching a DVD of sketches from “Caesar’s Hour” I heard a line that I would be willing to bet money was Gelbart’s: Caesar, playing a vaudeville hoofer, avers that he’s a great dancer because “I’ve got ten toes in my heart.” Although he seldom received solo credit as a screenwriter — Oh, God! was a notable exception — Gelbart’s writing infused the projects on which he worked with sparkling wit and a seriousness of purpose that is at the root of all great comedy. His memoir is an unalloyed delight.\n\nSee also: Original Story By: A Memoir of Broadway and Hollywood Arthur Laurents (2000) Laurents virtually defined the word “prickly,” his later dogmatism sometimes destroying decades-long friendships. He was also, as a playwright, librettist and screenwriter, seldom as great as one hoped he would be. On the other hand, he was associated with three musical classics (West Side Story, Anyone Can Whistle and, especially, Gypsy) and wrote two exceptional screenplays whose subsequent movies their respective directors fucked up through insecurity and compromise: The Turning Point and The Way We Were. Whatever his flaws as a human being, Laurents’ memoir is an eye-opener, fascinating, articulate and compelling.\n\n53. Mad as Hell: The Life and Work of Paddy Chayefsky Shaun Considine (1994)\n\nOf all American playwrights and screenwriters, few were as drunk on words as Paddy Chayefsky. In the 1970s, going to see a movie written by Chayefsky (who was without a doubt the auteur of those pictures) was an exhilarating experience, the writers’ mordant wit and “outrageous” point of view, wedded to his dazzling verbosity, combining to give viewers almost an entirely new genre, something we might call rhetorical slapstick. Although Pauline Kael for one accused Chayefsky of being a reactionary, I don’t think she quite understood his position as a satirist. (Although certainly he behaved like a reactionary the night Vanessa Redgrave made her … is “ill-considered” the correct word?… acceptance speech at the Academy Awards.) Initially celebrated as the poet of kitchen-sink drama for television plays like “Marty” and “The Mother,” Chayefsky gradually began to explore larger ideas, and social comedy, and his dialogue became more expansive, less realistic and far more memorable. So memorable, in fact, that even when a broad audience embraced his expression, it didn’t always understand what he had in mind; in 1976, “I’m as mad as hell, and I’m not going to take this anymore!” became the watch-cry of Americans who were fed up with… well, just about everything. What the people who repeated the phrase didn’t quite understand was that the aphorism was uttered in Network by an unbalanced schizophrenic. Considine does an admirable job of research and writing, capturing a nonpareil in all his nettlesome genius.\n\n54. The Craft of the Screenwriter: Interviews with Six Celebrated Screenwriters John Brady (1982)\n\nBrady’s splendid book consists of long and free-ranging interviews with five of the great screenwriters of the era and one interloper whose scant worth to movie history has, I think, been proven over time…and I am not referring to Paddy Chayefsky, William Goldman, Ernest Lehman, Neil Simon or Robert Towne. Interestingly, the most informative chapter for me as a young playwright was the Simon interview, which I hadn’t expected to enjoy as much as did, or to find so useful in a practical sense. (The book was published long before the emergence of the mature Simon of Lost in Yonkers, remember.) I only regret that Brady didn’t know, as no one did until fairly recently, that Edward Taylor co-authored every script Robert Towne took solo credit for. I haven’t pulled The Craft of the Screenwriter down from the shelf in years, so it will be interesting to re-read that interview in light of what Sam Wasson dug up on the matter for his book on Chinatown.\n\n55. What Happens Next: A History of American Screenwriting Marc Norman (2008)\n\nAn engaging, unusually intelligent history of screenwriting by a screenwriter, which may be a first. Norman, who wrote the vastly entertaining novel (and subsequent movie) Oklahoma Crude and later won an Oscar for a romantic comedy about Shakespeare I haven’t seen due to what I consider an impossible imbecility at its core (Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate’s Daughter indeed!) not only provides a rich, spirited novelistic history of the screenwriter in Hollywood but, as his title suggests, the contours of his craft: The what-happens-next? of celluloid storytelling.\n\nSee also: Some Time in the Sun: The Hollywood Years of F. Scott Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Nathaniel West, Aldous Huxley and James Agee Tom Dardis (1976) Dardis’ book is especially useful for its debunking of the legend that surrounds Fitzgerald’s late Hollywood period, written as a refutation of Aaron Latham’s myth-reinforcing book Crazy Sundays.\n\nVI. Screenplays\n\nIn the 1970s, when “film studies” was everywhere, screenplays got published at a dizzying rate. Some now make one scratch one’s head in bemusement (Cisco Pike? Little Fauss and Big Halsey? Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid? Two-Lane Blacktop???) Others, like Easy Rider, were cutting continuity scripts, difficult to read… if you wanted to read the screenplay of Easy Rider, and I can’t imagine who would. The most enjoyable, like Goldman’s Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, were written to be read and are less concerned with outlining elaborate tracking shots (which anyway the director is going to ignore when he comes to shoot the thing) than with establishing and prolonging humor, mood and suspense. The best, such as those in the University of Wisconsin Warner Brothers series, contained long, informative histories of the pictures themselves and many frame blow-ups. But there were those who felt the practice of putting screenplays into print was a dubious idea at best; Larry McMurtry, himself a screenwriter, disdained them as “non-books.” He may have had a point.\n\nI admit I read them less often now than I did when I was an adolescent and becoming besotted with movies, needing movie books the way a dope-fiend needs a fix. But the best of them are pleasant keepsakes of movies that meant, and mean, something to me.\n\n56. The Annotated Godfather: The Complete Screenplay with Commentary on Every Scene, Interviews, and Little-Known Facts Jenny Jones, ed. (Screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo) 2007\n\nI wish Jones would repeat this for The Godfather Part II, without doubt the finest sequel ever made to an already magnificent American movie. Otherwise, I have no complaints. It’s interesting, in light of so many auteurist directors taking the possessive line, that The Godfather pictures have all borne the credit “Mario Puzo’s.” Coppola, and Paramount, knew, at least in 1972, that Puzo’s was the name (other than Brando’s) the millions of readers of the novel were looking for in those posters and advertisements.\n\n57. Best American Screenplays 2 Sam Thomas, ed. (1991) Thomas edited three omnibus screenplay collections covering a wide range of genres. The second volume is the finest by a hair and includes My Man Godfrey, Citizen Kane, The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, Some Like it Hot, Terms of Endearment, The Lion in Winter, Julia and The Sting. Best American Screenplays (1985), the first volume includes of The Graduate, Sounder, Arthur and The Candidate and Best American Screenplays 3 1995 brings together The Godfather, The Godfather Part II, Sunset Boulevard, Tender Mercies, Double Indemnity, Harold and Maude and Unforgiven. Although some of these classics have since been published separately most have not, so this trio constitutes a vest-pocket library of great American scenarios.\n\n58. Billy Wilder’s Some Like it Hot – The funniest film ever made: The complete book Alison Castle, ed; Interviews by Dan Aulier (Screenplay by Billy Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond) (2002)\n\nWhen I was 15 I found a copy of the old Signet paperback edition of the Some Like it Hot screenplay in a second-hand bookshop. Reading it that afternoon, I quite literally fell off the family sofa. I had never read a funnier script before, and have only read one since that was as funny (Larry Gelbart’s play Sly Fox). Some Like it Hot was the favorite movie I’d never seen for years before I finally caught it at a university screening in the 1980s. It has since become my favorite movie, period. So you can imagine with what trembling anticipation I learned of this Taschen book, and how nearly orgasmic my pleasure on receiving it. The ne plus ultra of books devoted to a specific movie, this is a glorious package supplemented by interviews and limned by wonderful photographs and other graphics, with that great Wilder/Diamond screenplay at its center.\n\n59. The Big Brass Ring: An Original Screenplay Orson Welles and Oja Kodar (1987)\n\nIn the years before his death, Welles was shopping this incisive political thriller around Hollywood, hoping to snare one of the then-biggest male stars (Robert Redford, Jack Nicholson, Warren Beatty) to take the leading role of William Blake Pellarin, a gubernatorial candidate treading dangerous lines of intrigue and obsessed by the young beauty with whom he once had an incandescent affair. While interested, none of the actors he sought would bite, using the excuse that they couldn’t afford to cut their price for a single movie (not even one to be directed by Orson Goddamned Welles!) when one suspects the thing that really unnerved them was the presence in the scenario of Kim Minnaker, the politico’s mentor, an ageing gay man fighting his own, unrequited desire for his old student. That would have been, and should have been, the Welles role, as the girl would have been his companion and collaborator Oja Kodar’s. Frustratingly, it was never to be; Welles died without a deal… which in Hollywood I suppose means you’re really dead. But his and Kodar’s screenplay is marvelous: Witty, erudite, intelligent and, in the sequence in which Minniker, riding a Ferris wheel outside Blake’s hotel, is stopped just outside the window where, in agony, he watches the younger man having sex with his beloved, incendiary. It’s a shocking moment and one can only imagine, with regret, what Welles would have done with it, both as director and as actor. If you’ll pardon my quoting from my own centenary essay on Welles, “In a moment as sexually charged as anything in American movies, Pellarin becomes aware of this scrutiny, and his eyes lock with Minnaker’s. The description of this emotionally naked encounter, in the published script, is among the most breathtaking I’ve ever encountered in dramatic literature; it should have burned holes in the screen.”\n\n60. The Bonnie & Clyde Book David Newman & Robert Benton (1972)\n\nNo movie of the late-1960s aside from Midnight Cowboy (and, peripherally, The Wild Bunch, which wasn’t nearly as popular) had more of an impact on the American popular culture than Bonnie & Clyde, even if many Americans were unaware of them as the changes were happening. There was outrage at the form the picture took, seeming to be a comedy and abruptly exploding into bloody violence at mid-point, with considerably more to follow before the astonishing finale. The director, Arthur Penn, got much of the credit (and the blame) for the style, and certainly he and Dede Allen, the editor, were responsible for the movie’s electrifying kineticism. But so was Warren Beatty, who produced Bonnie and Clyde, starred as Clyde Barrow and hired everyone else involved, including Penn. (On the debit side, Beatty was also responsible for indications of Barrow’s homosexuality being removed from the picture.) But Bonnie & Clyde was a writer’s picture, or a writers’ picture, since it was entirely the product of two young men. Newman and Benton had been making a name for themselves as clever young Esquire magazine art directors and copywriters when they collaborated on the B & C screenplay and tried to get it made by François Truffaut. Beatty and Penn had enormous input into the original authors’ revisions to their script, and of course Penn was rightly praised for how he shot and, with Allen, edited the material. But Bonnie & Clyde is prima facie evidence against the idiotic American concept of all-movies-belong-solely-to-directors auteurism. Everyone contributed to the success of B & C, not only at the box office (when Beatty pressured Jack Warner to re-release it after a disappointing early run and it caught on the second time around) but in fashion, the honing of opinion among younger critics, the depiction of screen violence and the opening up of what was permitted generally in the most influential of the popular arts.\n\nSee also: Two for the Road Frederic Raphael (1967) Stanley Donen also got credit for the shattered temporal structure of this alternatively dark and charming romantic comedy, but the script was written that way from its inception. Raphael makes this abundantly clear in his introduction, and refutes with evidence the notion that Donen was in any way the progenitor of what, apart from the lovely starring performances by Audrey Hepburn and Albert Finney (and the nifty Henry Mancini score) made the picture so memorable. Herein lies a lesson for every TV-commercial wizard who slaps a possessive credit on his first, usually rotten, movie.\n\n61. Casablanca: Script and Legend Howard Koch (and Julius & Philip Epstein) 1973 (Expanded edition, 1995) Although Koch was one of three credited scenarists on Casablanca, it was he who wrapped the published screenplay within his own reminiscence of its complex creation, filming, initial success and enduring popular repute. (Three years earlier he had done a similar job on The Panic Broadcast, a book reprinting his script, heavily doctored and improved by Orson Welles, for the phenomenal 1938 “War of the Worlds” broadcast, a publishing event about which Welles was none too happy.) The most important aspect of the Casablanca book, of course, is the Casablanca script, which despite its romantic excesses — courtesy of the un-credited Casey Robinson — remains one of the wittiest and most quotable screenplays ever written for an American classic.\n\nSee also: Casablanca: The 50th Anniversary Edition (1992) The Koch and Epstein screenplay sans Koch’s memoir.\n\n62. The Citizen Kane Book Orson Welles and Herman L. Mankiewicz; Pauline Kael (1971)\n\nFew essays on the popular arts were more widely read, and fewer created more unnecessary controversy, than Pauline Kael’s “Rising Kane” in The New Yorker, which she later made the centerpiece of her book publishing the original screenplay by Orson Welles and Herman J, Mankiewicz along with the cutting continuity of what was then being routinely called “the greatest movie ever made.” It’s a typically witty, informative Kael essay but filled with inaccuracies, particularly about Welles’s contributions to the script. (Among her sources was John Houseman, Welles’ one-time producer and later deadly enemy, who must have relished the opportunity to deny Welles writing credit for his most well-regarded picture.) Kael’s essay was so persuasive it even fooled the redoubtable Kenneth Tynan, up to then a lifetime Welles acolyte. What was curious about “The Kane Mutiny,” as Peter Bogdanovich wittily dubbed it in Esquire, is that Kael was also a strong public admirer of Welles’ work as a filmmaker, particularly at a time when most of the press was ignoring him entirely. It must have galled him that the screenplay he and Mankiewicz wrote was forever wedded to an essay hot to prove he didn’t deserve much credit for the writing. Kael’s piece is still worth reading, provided you know how to refute it, and that screenplay still well worth studying, in whatever format. The advantage of having the shooting script yoked to the continuity is that this allows you to confirm at a glance which lines and sequences were dropped, or altered by Welles and his Mercury Theatre actors, during the filming.\n\n63. Greed: A Film by Erich von Stroheim (1979)\n\nOne of the great, mutilated masterworks, Greed was famously (or infamously) chopped down by MGM to 140 minutes from an 8-hour first cut by its writer/director, the genuinely visionary Erich von Stroheim. That Stroheim was extravagant is an understatement, but he was not foolish enough to believe a major Hollywood movie studio would release a picture of that length, although he (like Robert Altman later with his unrealized movie of E.L. Doctorow’s Ragtime and Claude Lanzmann with his overrated and exhausting 9-hour Shoah) wanted a two-part movie audiences would have to see in separate screenings. A 1999 Turner Entertainment “reconstruction,” which runs 239 minutes is, like the 1984 A Star is Born restoration, filled out with stills and is based on Herbert G. Weinberg’s coffee table book The Complete Greed, now quite rare. The Lorimer text, cited here, is a less profligately illustrated but more affordable means of judging what Stroheim had in mind. At least you should have an easier time getting your hands on a copy than you will finding the Turner Greed, for which, startlingly, there has never been a DVD release.\n\n64. JFK: The Book of the Film – The Documented Screenplay Oliver Stone and Zachary Sklar (1992)\n\nPrior to JFK, Stone was a media darling for the 1986 Platoon in spite of the fact that nearly all American newspapers and magazines pushed the Vietnam war until it became fashionable to condemn it, and the 1987 Wall Street, because everyone but a fiscal vulture can feel virtuous critiquing rapacious capitalism. Born on the Fourth of July didn’t hurt his media reputation either. But challenging the Warren Report? How very dare he? An early draft of the screenplay was leaked to the press while the picture was shooting, and the battle was on. Despite the nearly constant barrage of negative press, broadside reviews and colloquies by the usual talking heads condemning Stone, and his film, the picture took off into the stratosphere to such a degree that Congress passed The President John F. Kennedy Assassination Records Collection Act of 1992 as a result. (Not that this has led to much of anything.) As a result of the false, hysterical claims against JFK, when they came to publish their screenplay Stone and his collaborator Zachary Sklar prepared a fully annotated edition which refuted many of the lies and much of the mythology the CIA-infiltrated American media still pushes on an increasingly credulous population concerning the very public murder of an American president.\n\n65. The Magnificent Ambersons: A Reconstruction Orson Welles; Robert L. Carringer, ed. (1993)\n\nWhenever I consider the violence done to what on the evidence was almost certainly Orson Welles’ masterpiece as a writer/director, I get physically ill. Not only because what still exists of Ambersons is so brilliant, or even because its mutilation savaged Agnes Moorehead’s still-astonishing performance, but because of the damage it did to its maker. “They destroyed it,” he once said, “and it destroyed me.” “They” is of course RKO, which used Welles’ being in South America at government request as an excuse to first disfigure his movie by removing more than 40 minutes from it and, later, after he’d been ousted from the studio, to obliterate the negative and even the preview print, leaving us an hour and 20 minutes of tattered glory beyond the means of rescue. Carringer’s book reconstructs the picture in verbal and visual terms (by the use of production stills) so that we can at least read what Welles intended. Much of the cut material appeared in script and still form in the earlier book This is Orson Welles but Carringer’s volume puts the whole thing together.\n\n66. More About All About Eve Joseph L. Mankiewicz; Gary Carey (1972)\n\nAll About Eve is (or used to be) everyone’s favorite theatre fable, one of the wittiest and most quotable of American movies. Joseph Mankiewicz’s exceptionally literate screenplay was a natural for publication, and Random House brought out an edition of it in 1950. Two decades later Bantam reprinted it, supplemented by a long interview with Mankiewicz by Gary Carey. The script still shimmers, but Mankiewicz revised his interview responses to such a degree he removed all the air from his remarks, replacing spontaneity with fussy ponderousness. It’s a tendency he also had as screenwriter, cluttering things up with verbiage, and the reason I suspect he did not direct an original movie of his own after 1967; he had become what Orson Welles once called “a loquacious bore.”\n\n67. The Ninth Configuration William Peter Blatty with Mark Kermode commentary (1999)\n\nAnother witty and endlessly quotable masterpiece, although far less well known than All About Eve. Blatty’s alternately hilarious and harrowing adaptation and revision of his novel Twinkle, Twinkle, “Killer” Kane is a nonpareil, filled with verbal slapstick and marvelous oddballs in its cast of characters. For the published screenplay, Mark Kermode leads the author on a journey through the picture, their commentary appearing alongside the text. Even if Blatty ends the picture by handing us yet another facile “proof” of life-after-death, the ride is so uniquely entertaining we can even forgive him for the sermon.\n\nSee also: William Peter Blatty on The Exorcist: From Novel to Screen (1974) Blatty was nothing if not sincere about his somewhat trying missionary zeal, and in this Bantam paperback he explicates that mission, along with the shooting script for his most popular movie. “William Friedkin’s The Exorcist,” my ass.\n\n68. Nixon Oliver Stone and Stephen J. Rivele & Christopher Wilkinson (1995)\n\nHaving been burned by the corporate media on JFK, Oliver Stone was taking no chances with Nixon. He and his co-scenarists thoroughly annotated their published screenplay, including transcripts from the White House tapes and essays by some of the participants. The script, lavishly illustrated with stills from the picture, would be satisfying enough; the added weight of the documentary evidence makes the book a necessary volume in the expanding Nixon/Watergate libraries. I can never quite decide which Stone picture is my favorite, although I vacillate between JFK and Nixon, as I do between City Lights and Modern Times for Chaplin… and this is probably the first time the names of those two filmmakers have ever been yoked together.\n\n69. Screenplays Volume II, The (The Collected Works of Paddy Chayefsky): The Hospital, Network, Altered States Paddy Chayefsky (2000)\n\nApplause Books issued three Chayefsky collections in 2000: One for his stage plays and two for his screenplays. The second volume of movie scripts contained his best and most representative work, including the two on which his modern reputation rests. Although The Hospital is still a wonderful movie, I think a new Chayefsky may be required to, as Paddy did with the state of the medical monolith ca. 1970, satirize the way insurance and Big Pharma manipulate, rule over and generally destroy the lives and health not only of Americans but of nearly everyone on the planet. But while the contours of the news business have changed since 1976, Network retains its sting. Chayefsky was so prescient about televised news he was nearly an oracle; nearly everything he “predicted” in Network has come true in the decades since what MGM, hedging its bets, marketed as “a perfectly outrageous motion picture” was unleashed to the theaters.\n\nSee also: The Collected Works of Paddy Chayefsky: The Screenplays (Volume 1): Marty, The Goddess, The Americanization of Emily Paddy Chayefsky (2000)\n\n70. Star Wars: The Annotated Screenplays (Star Wars, The Empire Strikes Back, The Return of the Jedi) Laurent Bouzereau (Screenplays by George Lucas, Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan) 1997\n\nOnly a fool or an overstimulated fanboy would refer to the screenplays of the original Star Wars trilogy as great literature, or even great pop literature. But if you’re fond of the movies made from them, they’re great fun to read, and the annotations provided in this nifty volume are fascinating. As a maker of exceptionally thorough behind-the-scenes documentaries Bouzereau’s name has been nearly ubiquitous on DVDs and Blu-rays of many popular movies. He applies the same rigor and besotted intelligence here.\n\n71. Hud, Norma Rae and The Long, Hot Summer: Three Screenplays by Irving Ravetch and Harriet Frank, Jr. Edited and with an Introduction by Michael Frank (1988)\n\nBeginning with the Faulkner-inspired The Long, Hot Summer, Ravetch and Frank embarked on a career-long collaboration with the director Martin Ritt, resulting in eight pictures including the remarkably intelligent Paul Newman Western Hombre and Conrack, their adaptation of Pat Conroy’s despairing memoir of teaching shockingly impoverished Gullah children in South Carolina. Hud, of course, was one of Newman’s most identifiable roles (and the first Larry McMurtry novel adapted for the screen) while Norma Rae, based on the life and union activism of the late Crystal Lee Sutton, showed the moviegoing world that Sally Field was a major talent with a range far beyond what her earlier work (excepting the television “Sybil”) had led anyone to expect from her. The Norma Rae screenplay is perhaps the Ravetches’ most representative, filled with compassion, intelligence, humor, what used to be called “social consciousness” but which while passionate does not hector the viewer, and an impeccable sense of the dramatic. Who, having seen the picture, can forget the image of Norma Rae Webster standing defiantly atop the factory table with a hastily scrawled “Union” placard in her hands? And as a writer I treasure this exchange by the screenwriters between Norma and the textiles union organizer Reuben Warshawsky, portrayed by the wonderful Ron Liebman:\n\nReuben: You’re the fish I wanted to hook.\n\nNorma: Well, you got me. So what the hell are you gonna do with me?\n\nReuben: Make a mensch outta you, kid.\n\nNorma: You are?\n\nReuben: Mm-hm.\n\nNorma: (After a pause) What is that?\n\nReuben: Somebody who goes to the old folks’ home on Saturday morning instead of playing golf. Somebody who puts a dollar in a blind man’s cup for a pencil.\n\nNorma: I’d do that.\n\nReuben: Uh-huh. But would you take the pencil?\n\nNorma: Of course. I paid for it.\n\nReuben: Somewhere between logic and charity, there falls a shadow.\n\nThat, not boilerplate Democrat pieties dressed up in “dazzling” verbiage by self-righteous liberal dramatists, is what great screenwriting is all about.\n\nSee also: Three Screenplays by Horton Foote: To Kill a Mockingbird, Tender Mercies and The Trip to Bountiful (1994) Harper Lee remarked of Foote’s beautiful adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird that he had “distilled the essence” of her novel. This is the most that can be expected of a writer transliterating the nearly perfect work of another, and the best that can ever be hoped. Foote was also, of course, a considerable playwright and screenwriter, and this collection brings together, along with Mockingbird, two of his own finest screenplays. And (not that this automatically confers honor upon them) all three of these scripts won Foote Academy Awards.\n\n72. To Have and Have Not Jules Furthman & William Faulkner (1987)\n\nAs an adolescent I fell in love with the dialogue (and Bogart’s and Bacall’s performances) in this most entertaining of war-time escapist pictures long before I ever saw the movie, listening late at night in my bed to a local radio station’s airing of the 1946 “Lux Radio Theatre” broadcast, with an earplug (singular; this was the mid-’70s) but without, alas, Walter Brennan. Even though some of the repartee between Harry “Steve” Morgan and “Slim” Marie (“You know how to whistle, don’t you, Steve…?”) that so delighted me at 13 or 14 I later discovered was written by Howard Hawks, the picture’s director, the rest of what I was hearing was sharper and more intelligent than the 1940s norm. And although I have always loved Casablanca, I don’t love it as I do To Have and Have Not. There’s almost no fealty in it to the bitter, downbeat Hemingway novel, but that was the point; Hawks wanted to show how Marie and Harry might have met. The University of Wisconsin edition of the screenplay includes a splendid long introduction by the editor, Bruce F. Kawin, that delves deeply into the development of the script: The first pass was by the gifted but unpleasant Furthman, the second by Faulkner, and the polish by Hawks who, as so often his pictures, could have taken a screenwriting credit and didn’t. The running gag of Brennan’s Eddie asking everyone he meets if they “was ever bit by a dead bee” sounds like something Hawks might have devised, but it was Furthman who had the wit to come up with it.\n\nHonorable Mention:\n\nThe 400 Blows François Truffaut and Marcel Moussy (1969) The Grove Press edition, packed with photos.\n\nAbraham Polonksy’s Force of Evil: The Critical Edition Abraham Polonsky and Ira Wolfert (1996)\n\nAmerican Graffiti George Lucas and Gloria Katz & William Hyuck (1975) Another terrific Grove Press edition, later reprinted by Ballantine Books.\n\nThe Apartment and The Fortune Cookie: Two Screenplays Billy Wilder and I.A.L.

Perhaps too many screenplays were published in the ’70s, but almost none that aren’t owned by Disney are getting into print today.\n\nText copyright 2022 by Scott Ross\n\nBy Scott Ross\n\nThe Way We Were was so popular in its day, and is so warmly remembered by those who saw it when it was new, that the glow of memory has transmuted it into something it isn’t, and never was. Far from a great romantic drama, it is a potentially great romantic drama effectively sabotaged, mostly by the usual spineless obduracy of its director, Sydney Pollack.\n\nOnce upon a Hollywood time the producer Ray Stark wooed the playwright and screenwriter Arthur Laurents to concoct a project for Barbra Streisand. Laurents based his original treatment on a firebrand Jewish coed he’d known at college in the 1930s. Because he’d been impressed with the 1969 They Shoot Horses, Don’t They? the scenarist, to his everlasting regret, insisted that Pollack be their director. Pollack in turn wanted the lead male role for his pal Robert Redford. And thereby, as is said, hangs a tale.\n\nAs is plainly evident from the compelling novel Laurents published in 1972 based on his own original script, The Way We Were is Katie Morosky’s story. Hubbell Gardner, her goyische obsession (and eventual husband) is a supporting actor merely. Indeed, his charming emptiness is part of the point; their romance is doomed because Katie sacrifices her ideals for a beautiful, bright man who is, while politically astute, a passive, empty, uncommitted vessel into which she pours her romantic/erotic desires. And Katie’s political engagement is in the novel front and center, even when, as a Hollywood wife, she’s neglecting it.\n\nThe story works in the book in a way it never gets a chance to on-screen, where Redford’s involvement overbalances the narrative and Pollack, after a disastrous preview, panicked and cut nearly every political moment of importance, even shredding the climactic motivation for the dissolution of the Gardners’ marriage, as the pregnant Katie realizes her past has become a danger to her screenwriter husband’s present and offers to permit a divorce if they can just stay together long enough for her to deliver their child — a thing she couldn’t imagine doing in any other circumstance. By deliberately trimming these lines, and only these lines, of Katie’s, Pollack subverted the picture, and Streisand’s performance. But then, Pollack became well-known in Hollywood (perhaps as a result of The Way We Were) as a consummate writer-fucker.\n\nPollack, who when he appeared on the other side of the camera was a fine actor, as a director was little but a gifted hack who, early on, made a couple of good pictures (They Shoot Horses… and The Scalphunters) and later a few more (Three Days of the Condor, Tootsie and Absence of Malice) but whose work in the main is a catalog of mediocrity with a certain pictorial prettiness. He was not, to be charitable, what one could without laughing call a deep thinker. Unlike that other Sidney, the late and much lamented Lumet (himself once an actor) Pollack seemed not to have an analytical bone in his body, and very little narrative logic. I remember, in 1986, howling with laughter to hear him praising the Motion Picture Academy for its “courage” in decreeing his expensive Hallmark Valentine Out of Africa Best Picture of its year, as if the movie was some radical departure from the accepted norm instead of exactly and precisely the sort of big, swoony romantic pap upon which in those days the Academy habitually bestowed its imprimatur. Some well-respected filmmakers (Chaplin, Keaton, Welles, Lumet, Laurence Olivier, Elia Kazan, Martin Ritt, Blake Edwards, Carl Reiner, Mike Nichols, Roman Polanski, Elaine May, Sidney Poitier, Clint Eastwood, Gene Wilder, Warren Beatty, Kenneth Branagh and even Redford himself) were or are actors,* and the really good ones have a feeling for how to present other actors to their best advantage. Certainly these men (and women, if we include Streisand herself) are not known for sabotaging their stars’ performances as Pollack did to Streisand, not once but twice. The second instance was a sequence he cut in which Katie, driving on the UCLA campus, sees a passionate young girl agitating against the actions of the House Committee on Un-American Activities who both reminds her of her youthful self and stands as a living upbraid to her own increasing complacency.\n\nLaurents knew he was in trouble when Pollack gushed that he had come up with the best romantic screenplay anyone had written in years, “and you’re a homosexual!” Due to his commitment to Redford, Pollack insisted that Hubbell be given equal weight with Katie thus (in my admittedly minority opinion) fatally compromising the project. When Laurents eventually walked away from his own film — directors who moan about having to do this should talk to a few of the writers they habitually drive to that extreme — Pollack ultimately brought on no fewer than 11 additional writers including some very fine ones like Alvin Sargent, Paddy Chayefsky, and Herb Gardner, only the first of whom would seem to have had any natural affinity for the material. Along the way someone (Sargent?), trying to resurrect the shreds of a character (poor Bradford Dillman’s) who, while peripheral in the book, at least has a presence there but who is nearly translucent in the finished picture, shoehorned in the movie’s most annoying wheeze: Hubbell and J.J. challenging each other to come up with “best”s. (“Best whiskey,” “Best year.”) As a recurrent motif it’s even more irritating than the sight of Streisand pushing Redford’s bangs across his forehead as if he was a little boy about to have his portrait photo taken, and equally as true to life.\n\nAlthough it was probably cold comfort, considering the damage Pollack would ultimately do to his screenplay, once the director’s team of re-writers got through ruining the very script Pollack had raved about, Laurents was prevailed upon to return to the project, and was in a position to charge Stark & Co. through the nose for his continued participation. I like to think Laurents wrote Katie’s splendid rejoinder to Hubbell late in the movie, in the sequence at Union Station where supporters of the Hollywood Ten are attacked by shrieking McCarthyite conformists. The exchange highlights both the limits of Hubbell’s thinking, and the essential soundness, even if it sometimes lacks humor, of Katie’s:\n\nHubbell: I’m telling you that people — people— are more important than any goddamn witch hunt. You and me! Not causes. Not principles.\n\nKate (Exasperated): Hubbell, people are their principles!\n\nOr their lack of them.\n\nWatching the Union Station sequence in 2020, the terrified mass in the movie that physically assaults the defenders of free speech (including, of course, the freedom of the attackers to oppose free speech…) is eerily and unsettling close to the equally ill-informed and frightened of today shouting into the faces of their fellow citizens for the unpardonable sin of not blindly obeying the edicts of governors, mayors and un-elected officials threatening them with arrest should they balk at slapping 95% ineffective pieces of cloth over their faces, whatever their reasons for failing to submit might be, including ill health, psychic distress or simple good sense. Plus ça change…\n\nHowever butchered it was in the making, and bearing Pollack’s less-than inspired staging of most of its scenes, the picture still looks handsome, thanks to the sharp imagery, beautifully balanced color and unerring eye of its cinematographer Harry Stradling Jr., the splendid period production design by Stephen B. Grimes and set decoration of William Kiernan — there’s an especially nice touch at the beginning when Larry Parks’ name rather pointedly appears on a theatre marquee — and Dorothy Jeakins’ and Moss Mabry’s subtle costume designs which perfectly re-create the sartorial look of the late ’30s, mid-to-late 1940s and early 1950s. The Oscar-winning score by Marvin Hamlisch struck me as bloodless in 1973 and seems even thinner now, particularly when I reflect that one of the composer’s direct competitors for the award was Jerry Goldsmith’s superb score for Papillon, and that among the non-nominated scores that year were Enter the Dragon (Lalo Schifrin), Scorpio (Jerry Fielding), The Thief Who Came to Dinner and Oklahoma Crude (both by Henry Mancini), Theatre of Blood (Michael J, Lewis), Cahill, United States Marshal (Elmer Bernstein), George Martin’s distinctly non-John Barryesque James Bond Live and Let Die and my own personal favorite of that year, Michel Legrand’s marvelous score for The Three Musketeers. The brief song Hamlisch composed with the lyricists Marilyn and Alan Bergman (and which soon became annoyingly ubiquitous) is, on the other hand, strongly and exceptionally plangent, although I have a quarrel with one of its essential lines:\n\n“Memories may be beautiful and yet\n\nWhat’s too painful to remember\n\nWe simply choose to forget\n\nSo it’s the laughter\n\nWe will remember…”\n\n(©COLGEMS-EMI Music)\n\nThis, in my experience, is wholly incorrect. The memory of laughter fades; it’s the pain you can’t forget.\n\nLaurents’ published novel (and, one presumes, the screenplay on which he based it) fleshes out all the characters. The movie flattens them. And as with the fabled night in Tootsie which Larry Gelbart said “would have to last a hundred hours,” Pollack’s sense of time is so imprecise that the movie Hubbell is hired to adapt from his own first novel seems to be taking years to write. Aside, to a degree, from Patrick O’Neal as Hubbell’s director, Herb Edelman as Katie’s New York radio producer and Viveca Lindfors as a character very like Salka Viertel (in whose literary salon most writerly emigres of the period congregated) no one else in the picture has a chance to land a performance, or even to make us aware of their existence.
