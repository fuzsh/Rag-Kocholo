        "text": "In a surprising turn of events, NewsNet, the Farmington Hills-based 24-hour news outlet owned by the creator of 5-hour Energy, has abruptly ceased operations after just two years on the air.\n\nMetro Detroit businessman Manoj Bhargava, the owner of the popular 5-Hour Energy, was at the helm of the 24-hour news channel available through traditional broadcasting networks and on streaming services 2 years ago. The premise was a unique approach to delivering unbiased, fact-based news, hoping to be a breath of fresh air in the often tumultuous world of media.\n\nAccording to Crain's Detroit, Bhargava states pulling the plug in Michigan is due to a lack of a dedicated audience.\n\n“We believed people would want to watch a clean, non-bias news network, but we were wrong,” Bhargava, owner of parent company Bridge Media, said in a statement sent to Crain’s. “Without a large audience, we just couldn’t continue to lose money. We hired the best people and talent, and we appreciate their hard work and effort. But we just couldn’t continue.”\n\nBoth the news sector and the sports television news network the company owns will cease operations.\n\nWord quickly spread on Friday through social media that the announcement came without notice to some 80 employees. The majority of the 'breaking news' came from the blindsided employees including on-air anchors.\n\n\"Happy Friday! I lost my job today. Actually, everyone at NEWSnet lost their job today. Pretty wild...Despite my short time working there, I'm really thankful I had the opportunity to be part of this team\", Jay Plyburn said.\n\n\"Life has ups & downs. Today is a down…Woke up this morning to be told that Newsnet is no longer on the air and that I’m out of a job\", posted Meteorologist John Gross.\n\n\"I’m sure most of you have heard the news. NEWSnet is shut down, leaving about 80+ people out of work, including me. My heart hurts for my colleagues. They are a resilient group of amazing individuals- I am angry for them. They did not deserve this\", Ruby Shane shared.\n\nThe news outlet was also home to two of the Flint area's former broadcasters. Both the legendary Bill Harris and sports icon Ryan Slocum. The duo shared the screen during their days in Mid-Michigan as part of the WJTV ABC-12 family. Harris shared a picture of the two back in April after joining the NEWSNet team.\n\nGet our free mobile app\n\nAccording to Crain's, Bhargava is right in the middle of multiple lawsuits tied to his attempts to acquire the majority stake in the parent company of Sports Illustrated. There's no word on whether the sudden 'fade to black' for NEWSNet has anything to do with that.\n\nLOOK: Do you know these iconic quotes from '70s TV shows\n\nStacker looked through the vast array of groundbreaking 1970s television and identified 25 of its most iconic (and most memorable) quotes.\n\nGallery Credit: Sofia Voss\n\nFlint + Saginaw's Most-Popular TV Anchors - Where Are They Now?\n\nA lot of highly talented people have sat behind the anchor desks at the area's TV stations.\n\nWe're taking a look at some of the area's most popular news, weather, and sports anchors who have visited our homes electronically and then moved on.\n\nGallery Credit: George McIntyre\n\nThe 10 Worst TV Game Shows of All Time\n\nFrom boring to overcomplicated to just plain offensive, we've plumbed the depths of the last few decades of reality game show television to bring you the worst of the worst.\n\nGallery Credit: Emma Stefansky\n\nMore From Cars 108"
