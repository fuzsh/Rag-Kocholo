        "text": "Monday M*A*S*H Discussions offers fans the opportunity to offer their opinions on a wide variety of topics relating to M*A*S*H. Please share your thoughts and ideas in the comments section. My hope is these discussion posts will continue to elicit comments in the weeks and months after they’re initially published. Have a suggestion about something you think might be worth discussing? Let me know and maybe it will become my next Monday M*A*S*H Discussion topic.\n\npenguinphysics suggested today’s topic: Have you seen any movies starring M*A*S*H cast members?\n\nMovie Tonight?\n\nI’ll let penguinphysics explain the genesis of this discussion topic:\n\nWhat brought this idea on was a movie with Jamie Farr called something like Return of The Rebels (which was so awful that it was painful to watch). I only watched this film because of Farr’s participation (I think it was a made-for-TV film) but the story is just so horrifically bad that I have to wonder how it would have ever gotten made without his inclusion.\n\nPersonally, I’ve never watched a movie simply because it had a member of the M*A*S*H cast in it. Most of the time, I watch movies because the trailers or TV commercials look interesting, or because they’re part of a franchise I’m a fan of (like Star Trek, Marvel, James Bond). In the past, when I had access to the wonderful cable channel Turner Classic Movies, I watched almost any movie with Cary Grant, Ginger Rogers, or Jimmy Stewart, among others. More recently, I’ve watched a number of movies on Netflix that I otherwise wouldn’t be interested in because they starred Kate Beckinsale.\n\nThat doesn’t mean I haven’t seen any movies starring, co-starring, or featuring a member of the M*A*S*H cast. I took a quick look through the Internet Movie Database and came up with the following list:\n\n-Alan Alda: Flash of Genius (2008)\n\n-Harry Morgan: High Noon (1952), Strategic Air Command (1955)\n\n-Gary Burghoff: Behind the Waterfall (1995)\n\n-David Ogden Stiers: Beauty and the Beast (1991), Jungle 2 Jungle (1997), Krippendorf’s Tribe (1998)\n\nI think this is a complete list. It’s possible I’ve seen some of Harry Morgan’s other movies from the 1940s or 1950s.\n\nLet’s Discuss\n\nHave you seen any movies with Alan Alda, Harry Morgan, David Ogden Stiers, or other members of the M*A*S*H cast? Have you gone out of your way to watch a movie specifically because it featured a member of the M*A*S*H cast?\n\nHit the comments with your thoughts."
