        "text": "Stony Brook’s Alan Alda Center for Communicating Science and the Stony Brook Film Festival are offering a five-film festival of classics personally selected by the acclaimed actor, author and activist Alan Alda.\n\nThe films, which will be available to stream May 20 through May 23, include Same Time, Next Year, The Four Seasons, Sweet Liberty, Crimes and Misdemeanors and The Aviator. Alan Alda will introduce the films and recount stories and memories from the different movie sets.\n\nPurchase your Festival Pass\n\n“It’s a treat to be working with the Stony Brook Film Festival and the Center for Communicating Science on this project,” said Alda. “I had a lot of fun making these films. It’s wonderful to be able to share them and some of the stories behind them in support of science communication, which is something that we need now more than ever.”\n\nThe films showcase a portion of Alda’s 60-year career as an actor and his versatility as a storyteller. In addition to playing major roles in each of the films included in the Festival, Alda also wrote and directed Sweet Liberty and The Four Seasons.\n\n“It’s always an honor to work with the great Alan Alda,” said Alan Inkles, director of the Staller Center and Stony Brook Film Festival. “I’m always inspired by his career and work ethic and I was thrilled to be asked to participate in this Festival.”\n\nThe films are offered chronologically based on their release dates to showcase the natural progression of Alan’s acting, writing and directing skills throughout the decades of his illustrious career.\n\nProceeds from the festival will support the Alda Center for Communicating Science, which offers professional development and graduate programs to researchers to help them learn to effectively share their work and engage with others. In collaboration with the Stony Brook School of Communication and Journalism, Alda co-founded the Center in 2009. The Center has worked with more than 15,000 scientists and researchers around the country and internationally."
