        "text": "Lillian Gish's fame is rooted in drama and tragedy, but, for her 104th film, the legendary actress has chosen a comedy.\n\nIn ''Sweet Liberty,'' Alan Alda's genial spoof of movie making, she portrays, all too briefly, the hero's cantankerous but beguiling mother, who has slept in her living room for 11 years ''because the devil is in the bedroom.'' The hero (Mr. Alda), asked how long his mother has been crazy, replies, ''All my life.''\n\nMiss Gish said she was at first reluctant to portray such a quirky character but agreed to do so during a talk with Mr. Alda because he is such ''a beautiful, charming man.'' Your face, she said, mirrors your soul.\n\n''Sweet Liberty,'' which Mr. Alda also wrote and directed, centers on a professor who is plunged into a summer of madness when a film company comes to his campus to make a movie of his book about the American Revolution. The comedy, co-starring Michelle Pfeiffer, Michael Caine and Lise Hilboldt, opens Wednesday.\n\nMiss Gish, who is 86, said her uneasiness over making a comedy faded quickly because of Mr. Alda's ''thoughtful, gracious direction.'' ''My scenes were all amusing, and I had great fun playing the off-center woman,'' she remarked. ''The film was easier to make than most because it was shot in beautiful summer weather and nearby, around Sag Harbor, Long Island.''\n\n''Making the movie reminded me of D. W. Griffith back in 1912,'' she recalled. ''There was no place we could go that was as happy as when we were shooting, and this film was just like that.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
