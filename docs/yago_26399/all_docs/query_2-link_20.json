        "text": "After watching The Fall Guy tonight I fancied another film-within-a-film. Sweet Liberty is one I fondly remember from childhood, renting it from the video shop and watching it on TV whenever it appeared in the schedules, which it did well into the 90s. But weirdly it seems rather forgotten now. It hasn't troubled television in a long time, nor has it been released to Blu-ray either.\n\nWriter/director Alan Alda stars as Michael Burgess, an academic and expert in the American Revolution whose scholarly tome Sweet Liberty has been snapped up by Hollywood, with filming set to begin in his hometown that summer. Unfortunately for Michael, when Hollywood arrives - in the shape of leading man Elliot James (Michael Caine), leading lady Faith Healy (Michelle Pfeiffer), screenwriter Stanley Gould (Bob Hoskins) and director Bo Hodges (Saul Rubinek) - it becomes clear to him that they want to make a bawdy teen comedy of his book. And if that wasn't enough of a headache for him, there's also the fact that his aged mother (Lillian Gish) is going round the bend, and that his relationship with his girlfriend Gretchen (Lise Hilboldt) is at breaking point.\n\nA gentle farce on small-town naivety and the Hollywood machine, Sweet Liberty has a great bunch of characters, especially those associated with the movie, and Alda elicits great performances from them. Caine is brilliant as Elliot James, the dashing Errol Flynn like swordsman (in every sense of the word) who enlivens his privileged but otherwise boring life on set engaging in dangerous stunts and cavorting with any passing female, whilst Hoskins convinces (with a great American accent) as a manic, junk food eating hack who believes his ambitions for literary greatness can be achieved through Michael. The luminescent Michelle Pfeiffer shines as Faith but, watching it now as an adult, I can see that it's a rather unenviable role she's given, as Michael, who had fallen in love with the historical figure of Mary Slocumb whilst researching his book, now finds himself falling for Faith, the actress hired to play Mary.\n\nThis obsessional romance which blurs the lines of reality is an interesting premise for a film - even in a light comedy such as this - but Alda never commits to it, preferring instead to ultimately write it all off as a summer holiday fling. Alda is determined to paint Michael as an honest hero, despite all his attitudes pointing to the contrary. He cheats on Gretchen with Faith, and then has the audacity to play the victim when he discovers that Faith has been sleeping with Elliot. It seems that Michael is the kind of guy who obviously thinks he has the monopoly on cheating! And what does he say when he learns of Faith's 'infidelity'? He remarks in shock and dismay that she wasn't Mary after all. Um, it's not her fault she's not your impossible, long dead dream woman, mate. Whilst it's clear that, in reality, Michael needs to go and work on his fucked up attitudes towards the opposite sex, Alda gives him a happy ending, reuniting him with Gretchen.\n\nOn reflection then, Sweet Liberty is not a perfect movie. Alda's charms as an actor aren't enough to make Michael easier to swallow, whilst Alda the writer gets bogged down with too many subplots that go nowhere and good actors left with little to do (Lois Chiles, Linda Thorson) or remain stuck in thankless roles (Pfeiffer, Hilboldt). Lillian Gish is adorable as his dotty mother and gets a few of the movie's laughs that haven't been carved up by Caine and Hoskins, but her scenes feel like they belong in a different film altogether and distract us from the film-within-a-film premise. Even here, with such a ripe subject for his movie, Alda fails. Refusing to bite the hand that feeds him, he pulls his satirical punches every time. For example, we never see enough of Rubinek and Hoskins' original vision for the movie that so appals Alda, which is strange because that's surely where the easy laughs for this kind of comedy would be found. In the end Sweet Liberty is a story about a passing madness for all concerned. Pleasant enough, and with a dose of personal nostalgia, but it really could have been much more.\n\nBruce Broughton gives a synthy, upbeat and driven collegiate-style score, whilst Patti LaBelle lends the film its single, the wonderfully 80s Something Special (Is Gonna Happen Tonight).\n\nThere isn't even a motorbike in this movie."
