        "text": "Lillian Gish, the last of the great silent film stars, who performed for more than 85 years in movies, theater and television, died in her sleep on Saturday evening at her home in Manhattan. She was 99 years old.\n\nHer personal manager, James E. Frasher, said the cause was heart failure.\n\n\"She was the same age as film,\" Mr. Frasher said. \"They both came into the world in 1893.\"\n\nMiss Gish was still performing as recently as the late 1980's. In 1986, she appeared as Alan Alda's hilariously addled mother in \"Sweet Liberty,\" and in 1987 she was widely praised for her sensitive portrayal of an indomitable old woman in \"The Whales of August,\" which co-starred another movie legend, Bette Davis. Advocate of an Early Start\n\n\"To become an actress, one cannot begin too soon,\" said Miss Gish, and she meant it, for she had made her acting debut at the age of 5.\n\nUnder the guidance of the director D. W. Griffith, Miss Gish became the pre-eminent actress in silent films, appearing in classics like \"The Birth of a Nation,\" \"Intolerance,\" \"Broken Blossoms\" and \"Way Down East.\"\n\nAfter performing in dozens of one- and two-reel silent movies (with running times of 10 or 20 minutes) and then in the longer Griffith epics, Miss Gish made a successful transition to the \"talkies,\" and later into television.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
