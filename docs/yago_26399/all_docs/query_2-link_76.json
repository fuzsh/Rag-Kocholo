        "text": "A Hollywood film crew invades the small town of history professor and author Michael Burgess (Alan Alda, who also wrote and directed), whose Revolutionary War novel they're adapting into a movie. But as his book is being slowly turned into a racy teen comedy, Burgess has his hands full romancing the production's lead actress (Michelle Pfeiffer). Michael Caine, Bob Hoskins, and Lillian Gish co-star in this lively satire. 106 min. Widescreen; Soundtrack: English; Subtitles: English; audio commentary; theatrical trailer."
