        "text": "If there is one thing that Hollywood loves to make, it is stories about Hollywood. The system is one that has made even the most beloved and iconic creative figures throw up their hands in bewilderment. As painful and perplexing as the experiences may be, they have often been able to be channeled into a positive by turning them into art. For his sophomore feature directorial effort, Alan Alda (M*A*S*H, The Four Seasons) decided to do just this following an encounter with an aspiring performer while visiting his dying father in the hospital. Sweet Liberty from 1986 has never been at the top of anyone’s filmography, but those who have seen it have been treated to a humorous exploration of trying to maintain artistic integrity in a land where capitalism is king. With the level of talent on board for this journey, it is great to see that audiences will once again be able to evaluate it through a modern lens.\n\nIn addition to directing, Alda plays Michael Burgess, a college history professor who wrote an acclaimed book on the American Revolution that has been optioned to be adapted into a big Hollywood feature. The whole town of Sag Harbor, New York is thrilled to be the shooting location for such an undertaking, but Michael is concerned that he has not been as involved in the development in the script as he would have liked. His fears seem to be justified after meeting with the scriptwriter, Stanley (Bob Hoskins, Who Framed Roger Rabbit?), who loves the source material but has been forced to transform the text into a steamy, sex-filled mess riddled with historical inaccuracies directed by an insensitive filmmaker (Saul Rubinek). As Michael tries to insert himself into the twisted knot of on-set politics, he finds himself in increasingly strange and unexpected situations.\n\nThe script from Alda does not excoriate the Hollywood system as harshly as some might want, but it hits an enjoyable balance of absurd and heartfelt that is grounded by its impressive ensemble. Alda is a man who has always seemed comfortable in the midst of chaos, which is exactly what a Hollywood set can be. Even when he is not dealing with that world, he has a lovely relationship with his girlfriend Gretchen (Lise Hilboldt) that seems as complicated as the Hollywood dealings at times. Matters are further confused upon the introduction of the gorgeous young actress, Faith Healy (Michelle Pfeiffer), who has a soft spot for the historical authenticity Michael can bring to the project. The fact that the Method performer is like a character from his book brought to life brings about a whole can of worms for all involved. Pfeiffer is nothing short of incredible in this role that has a bit more nuance than might appear on the surface. A normal movie might turn this into a standard love triangle, but Alda takes things a bit further to even the score a bit more.\n\nThe star of the film-within-the-film and a highlight of Sweet Liberty is the incomparable Michael Caine as egotistical lady’s man Elliott James. It is difficult to say whether Caine or Hoskins is having more fun in their roles, but Caine nails the lovable eccentricity of the character. While Michael is making eyes at Faith, Gretchen does not just sit on the sidelines as she makes a connection with Elliott, which does not go over the best with his wife (Linda Thorson). The layered relationship drama is a lot of fun to wade through, but the biggest laughs come from the struggles within the production itself. It is not just Michael who is concerned about accuracy, but the townspeople who pride themselves in being an important part of history. The inevitable clash between Hollywood versus local interest goes to some unexpectedly funny places. Be sure to keep an eye out for John C. McGinley (Scrubs) as one of the impassioned residents. Sweet Liberty can be outlandish at times, but it keeps the laugh flowing and has its heart in the right place. Any fans of the performers in the film owe it themselves to check this out as an enjoyable romp.\n\nVideo Quality\n\nSweet Liberty makes its Blu-Ray debut courtesy of Kino Classics with a digital AVC encoded 1080p transfer in 1.85:1 that appears to be derived from a really solid older master that is in good shape. Instances of print damage such as nicks and scratches occasionally pop up, but overall clarity and detail is quite strong. The presentation is enjoyable throughout most of the runtime with image stability and delineation being admirable. This transfer maintains the natural film grain of the presentation with only minor instances of some digital tinkering. The picture can run a bit soft in long shots, but colors are well saturated with the bright hues of nature coming through. Skin tones are mostly natural and consistent with facial features easily noticeable in closeup. Black levels hold up well with very little in the way of crush. This presentation is a really nice effort that should please fans.\n\nAudio Quality\n\nThis new Blu-Ray comes with a lossless DTS-HD 2.0 Master Audio mix that features all of the sounds of the film quite well. This is a film that utilizes music well, including an emotionally rousing score from Bruce Broughton. This and all of the other music is presented with great clarity and a pleasing fidelity as they come through the room. The dialogue holds up wonderfully, coming through clearly without being stepped on by the music or sound effects. The environmental effects are delineated nicely from the hustles and bustle of film set to the quieter moments walking through the fields. The track avoids most instances of age related wear and tear or distortion. This is a track that represents the film in a solid manner. Optional English subtitles are provided on this disc.\n\nSpecial Features\n\nAudio Commentary: Film Historian/Filmmaker Daniel Kremer and Film Historian/Biographer Nat Segaloff provide a very conversational commentary track which delves into their personal affection for the film, the satirical nature of the story, the place of this film in the careers of the key participants, the historical facts woven into the narrative and much more that makes your appreciation for the work grow even more.\n\nTrailers: The minute-long trailer for Sweet Liberty is provided here. There are also trailers provided for Betsy’s Wedding, Blame It On Rio, Married to the Mob and The Last Married Couple In America.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nSweet Liberty is a humorous satire of the Hollywood movie-making machine that maintains its universal appeal through an approachable script. Alan Alda capably leads this production both in front of and behind the camera alongside a bevy of talented performers who tackle the material with gusto. Kino Classics has given this forgotten comedy a Blu-Ray release that features a strong A/V presentation and a worthwhile commentary track. If you are a fan of the talent involved, this one might prove to be an enjoyable discovery. Recommended\n\nSweet Liberty is currently available to purchase on Blu-Ray.\n\nNote: Images presented in this review are not reflective of the image quality of the Blu-Ray.\n\nDisclaimer: Kino Classics has supplied a copy of this disc free of charge for review purposes.
