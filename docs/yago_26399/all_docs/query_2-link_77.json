        "text": "...an erratically-paced comedy that grows less and less interesting as it progresses...\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2/4 | May 5, 2022\n\nMature audiences looking for decent mainstream entertainment should have a good time watching the consequences of this classic Hollywood standoff.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 6/10 | Oct 27, 2021\n\nWhile the film suffers from a shoehorned relationship plot that tries to mirror the historical \"romance\" at the center of his book being filmed, the film excels when Michael confronts the film crew.\n\nFull Review | Jul 6, 2021\n\nIf you want a ruthless picture about moviemaking, go with Sunset Boulevard, S.O.B. or The Player. But if you want a toothless picture about moviemaking, then Sweet Liberty should hit the sweet spot.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | May 8, 2021\n\nOK light comedy, directed by and starring Alan Alda, about filming of movie in small town.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 3/5 | Feb 22, 2008\n\nA sweet, funny comedy about the perils of being a writer and making a movie. An underrated charmer.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 4/5 | Dec 15, 2003\n\nThe movie wants to juggle a lot of characters all at once, but it keeps dropping the most interesting ones.\n\nFull Review | Original Score: 2.5/4 | Jan 1, 2000"
