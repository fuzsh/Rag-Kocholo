It lifts all boats.”\n\nRead more…\n\nFNP Podcast\n\nElizabeth Lucas, Producing Artistic Director at New Spire Arts’, is working to create the cohesive tissue that connects Frederick’s art community. Lucas spoke with host Colin McGuire and News-Post features reporter Imade Borha discuss the art organization’s progress. Renovation plans are under way for New Spire Arts’ two buildings, and there is a full schedule of youth and adult workshops this summer.\n\nListen…\n\nNew spot opens in downtown Frederick for performing artists to hone craft\n\nBy Mallory Panuska, Jun 27, 2017\n\nFrom adult dance classes to independent film screenings, a new performing arts venue on East Church Street has many possibilities.\n\nRead…\n\nBack-to-school arts workshops aim to prepare kids for audition season\n\nBy Imade Borha, Aug 23, 2017\n\n“Whether it’s two minutes or whether it’s 16 bars, you have to tell a story,” Lucas said of musical theater auditions. “It’s about understanding your character … and letting the meaning of the music shine through.”\n\nRead…\n\nElizabeth Lucas is a director, producer, and serial creative entrepreneur currently launching the new company Free Range Humans, producing story-driven immersive entertainment, from site specific theatre to virtual reality.\n\nShe most recently served as the Producing Artistic Director of New Spire Arts, a new performing arts venue and education facility in downtown Frederick, MD. She launched the organization from the ground up, including vision, branding, contracts, legal structures, PR, marketing, and programs.\n\nElizabeth made her feature directing debut with three genre movies about New York City past, present and future: her rock musical movie, CLEAR BLUE TUESDAY, her slasher flick, RED HOOK (produced by Red Sand Media, distributed by Phase Four Entertainment ), and her Sci-fi FADE TO WHITE, all of which garnered award recognition and have gone on to distribution. She’s also made several shorts, including the multi-award-winning ISABELLA RICO, which appeared in 33 festivals worldwide and won Best Director and Special Achievement awards.\n\nElizabeth has been warmly reviewed by the New York Times for her musical theatre directing and original narratives, working with Tony-winning talent and Broadway writers from NYC to Alaska. She has most enjoyed directing new musicals and loves helping emerging writers and artists find their voice. Elizabeth directed a critically acclaimed production of her own new narrative for Adam Guettel’s MYTHS AND HYMNS for Prospect Theater in New York. She directed the world premiere of Mark Hollman’s BIGFOOT AND OTHER LOST SOULS for Perseverance Theatre in Juneau, Alaska, then again in Anchorage, Alaska. Elizabeth has developed new musicals for the theatre from countless readings to full productions, including several New York Musical Theatre Festival premieres: ZAPATA, THE CURE (a rock &amp; roll vampire fable), WILD ABOUT HARRY (a dance piece about Leona Helmsley), THE LAST STARFIGHTER (based on the film), THE VIEW FROM HERE, CAPTAIN GRAVY’S WAVY NAVY (developing for television), and MOST LIKELY TO DIE (reading). Her Midwest premiere of HELLO AGAIN won two After Dark Awards and was recommended for a Jefferson Award. Her productions of FOOTLOOSE and JEKYLL &amp; HYDE garnered rave reviews at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City. Favorite stage directing credits include NINE, KISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN and the Marta Kauffman/David Crane/Michael Skloff-written RAPUNZEL.\n\nElizabeth has assistant directed over 30 musicals, plays and operas with Tony-Winning director Walter Bobbie, international opera director Rhoda Levine, multi-award winning author, actor and director Simon Callow, Paper Mill Playhouse Artistic Director Mark Hoebee, and many others, at theatres such as Glimmerglass Opera, Paper Mill Playhouse, City Center Encores!, Lyric Opera of Chicago, Chicago Opera Theatre, Marriott’s Lincolnshire Theatre, and the Chicago Humanities Festival.\n\nAs a producer, Elizabeth is one of the founders of the New York Music Theatre Festival, for which she spearheaded the Movie Musical Screening Series. She also founded the Door County Opera and the Chicago Directors’ Forum and assistant produced the concert musical Galas for two seasons of the Chicago Humanities Festival. She was a producer on two of her three feature films and all of her short films.\n\nElizabeth is a member of the League of Professional Theatre Women, NY Women in Film &amp; Television, 2004 Berlin Film Festival Talent Campus, the 2004 Commercial Theatre Institute 14-Week Program, the League of American Theatres Producer Development Program and the 1998 Lincoln Center Theatre Directors Lab, all exclusive industry programs for producers &amp; directors. She has been a featured writer for SPUNK Magazine, GREAT LAKES STAGES and STAGE DIRECTIONS magazines. She received her Bachelor of Music in Lyric Theatre from Northwestern University and a Film Certificate from New York University.\n\nThe Gallup Strengths Finder and Entrepreneur Profile says Elizabeth is a self-assured strategic activator interested in ideas and the future with a talent for knowledge, delegation and disruption. The Pottermore Sorting Hat tells her she belongs in Gryffindor. Both are true.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFor Free Range Humans\n\nImmersive Jekyll & Hyde, set in a church, where the audience follows the actors through the environment.\n\n“Free Range Humans is bringing you a deliciously devious rendering of Jekyll & Hyde, unlike you’ve ever seen, felt, heard, or experienced it before. Remarkably transcendent, this highly immersive production of Jekyll & Hyde explores the essential narrative with an overwhelming emotional through-line while flinging audiences into the throng of the show’s heartbeat as it races and explodes from start to finish.”\n\n35MM: A Musical Exhibition\n\nStriking 12\n\nAlways…Patsy Cline\n\n“This evening was a delightful, sentimental, and thrilling treat to experience the amazing music of the incomparable Patsy Cline…Having the gift of experiencing an intimate yet comprehensive journey through the life and music of one of the most tragic losses of a generation is priceless.”\n\nMurder Ballad\n\n“Risqué, engaging, and full of magnetic life that draws you inexplicably down the darkened path of these characters, Murder Ballad is a thrilling musical shocker that sets a high bar for Free Range Humans as its first production.”\n\nMusical Premieres\n\nMyths & Hymns by Adam Guettel with narrative by Elizabeth Lucas (narrative premiere) for Prospect Theatre featuring Linda Balgord, Ally Bonino, Matthew Farcher,Donell Foreman, Anika Larsen, Bob Stillman, Lucas Steele with music, dance and designs by Ann Bartek, Emily DeAngelis, Herrick Goldman, Rob Meffe, Wendy Seyb, Katya Stanislavskaya\n\nBigfoot by Mark Hollman & Adrien Royce (world premiere) for Perseverance Theatre, Juneau\n\nBigfoot by Mark Hollman & Adrien Royce for Perseverance Theatre, Anchorage\n\nZapata!

The musical film, which was conceived, directed, and partially written by Elizabeth Lucas…examines the tragedy itself only obliquely. It focuses instead on the long-lasting effects of that violation of national and personal security on 11 New Yorkers, and through them you come to understand the day’s loss—and potential gains—in ways you couldn’t even if you were surrounded by CGI explosions. That’s no small feat for any dramatic presentation, let alone a low-budget film…Yet it is accomplished, with impressive clarity, seriousness, and even humor…”\n\n– Matthew Murray, BroadwayStars.com\n\nRED HOOK\n\nFEATURE HORROR FLICK\n\n“…having a female director behind the camera really gave the picture a tone of originality that many of today’s indie slasher films are missing.”\n\n“It’s quite refreshing to see such character development in an indie film, a slasher of all things.”\n\n“…this movie is so good at giving us cool and interesting characters, a bright and fast-paced atmosphere for them to thrive in, and builds the intrigue and suspense of the scavenger hunt plot so well…”\n\n– horrormoviesandstuff.com\n\nIN MY BLOOD\n\nNEW YORK MUSICAL THEATRE FESTIVAL\n\nIN MY BLOOD has “invigorating staging from director Elizabeth Lucas that unites the Goth-concert culture with Broadway practicalities more seamlessly than conventional wisdom has traditionally considered possible.”\n\n– Matthew Murray, Talkin Broadway\n\n“Elizabeth Lucas’s direction is riveting”\n\n– Suzanna Bowling, The Examiner\n\nRAGTIME\n\nCAPE REP, CAPE COD, MA\n\n“the Cape Rep Theatre production, under the masterful direction of Elizabeth Lucas, beautifully captures the spirit and essence of the show…Lucas works magic with this ensemble production.\n\nLucas moves her cast with great skill as time, place and focus fluidly change from New Rochelle to the Lower East Side, from train station to dock, from Harlem to Union Square, from Atlantic City to J.P. Morgan’s library. The ensemble work is excellent.”\n\n– Debbie Forman, Cape Cod Times\n\n“Lucas then takes a cast of 25 characters played by 19 actors with over 30 musical numbers, and creates an intense yet intimate show. Bring a tissue.”\n\n– Amy Tagliaferri, Cape Cod Chronicle\n\nPLAISIR D’AMOUR\n\nSUMMER SHORTS 2008 (SERIES B)\n\n“Elizabeth Lucas’ fluid direction allows the action to unfold gracefully.”\n\n– David Barbour, Lighting & Sound America\n\n“Of course, the real reason to see either series is for…Terrance McNally and Skip Kennon’s mini-musical, Plaisir D’Amour (Series B)…It’s the most polished of the eight plays, with outstanding performances from Stephanie D’Abruzzo and Jonathan C. Kaplan as they chronicle a relationship from the desperate single life to the troubled married life and eventually, with their own children now married, to the comfortable afterglow of a once passionate life. Far too many one-acts, even decent ones, come across as ultimately empty etudes, but this musically simplistic piece does for a transient comedy what Prelude & Liebestod did for drama.”\n\n– Aaron Riccio, Theater Talk\n\nTHE VIEW FROM HERE\n\nNEW YORK MUSICAL THEATRE FESTIVAL\n\n“This one-man musical plays like a fresh variation on Wonderful Town propelled by stunning music and a tremendously appealing solo performance by Shonn Wiley.\n\n“Under Elizabeth Lucas’ evocative direction, Huang’s script, written in collaboration with Lucas, ties the numbers together adroitly…”\n\n– Ron Cohen, Backstage\n\n“Elizabeth Lucas’ direction was nothing short of fantastic-it’s rare one person onstage can not only hold my attention, but keep me enthralled for over an hour. ”\n\n– All That Chat on Talkin’ Broadway\n\nJEKYLL & HYDE\n\nTRUMP PLAZA, ATLANTIC CITY\n\n“Director Elizabeth Lucas deftly guides her actors through a psychological drama turned musical, bringing the characters to life… a straight-ahead exceptional dramatic musical that, according to more than one theatergoer, compares favorably to the Broadway production.”\n\n– Steve Angelucci, Atlantic City Weekly\n\n“If top-shelf staging, stellar ensemble performances and a dynamic and compelling lead turn are more your speed, then don’t miss Jekyll & Hyde…”\n\n– Chuck Darrow, Courier Post\n\nKISS OF THE SPIDER WOMAN (the musical)\n\nGALLERY PLAYERS\n\n“…the novelty, invention, surprise and theatricality of the use of these musical elements to tell this story is quite remarkable…if all of the above is due to director Elizabeth A. Lucas, then let us just praise her, for her selections, and what she accomplished on stage. From small emotional moments to large stage pictures, she created a seamless, fluid, kinetic telling of the tale that made comprehension both clear and effortless. Very nice… it is a rich and spicy stew, something to be savored, and, in this production, a quite wonderfully realized expression of theatrical abilities.”\n\n-Clark Gesner, Brooklyn Heights Press\n\n“…the credit for this successful and entertaining staging can be shared by the skilled director Elizabeth A. Lucas and her talented cast…the biggest tribute goes to director Lucas, who manages to keep the action flowing smoothly as the actors move from drama to dance, from comedy to cruelty.”\n\n– Paulanne Simmons, The Brooklyn Papers\n\nVICTOR/VICTORIA\n\nSURFLIGHT THEATRE\n\n“…It is director Elizabeth Lucas who is the true star of this production…Lucas makes sure her cast works every nuance of Edwards’ script, and the result is that even the most minor characters come to life and create a world with a reality and depth not usually seen on local stages.”\n\n– Steven V. Cronin, Atlantic City Press\n\n“The Surflight has brought newcomer Elizabeth A. Lucas in to direct this wonderful production…the execution in this fast-paced comedy is almost flawless…It is a first-rate production…”\n\n– Kevin Adair, Beachcomber\n\nRAPUNZEL\n\nMARRIOTT’S LINCOLNSHIRE THEATRE\n\n“…director Elizabeth A. Lucas keeps the rollicking fun and games and wham-bang special effects coming pell mell.”\n\n– Nancy Maes, Chicago Tribune\n\n“as envisioned by director Elizabeth A. Lucas, it’s thoroughly entertaining. Love triumphs in this whimsical free-wheeling little show.”\n\n– Bruce Ingram, Pioneer Press\n\nFOOTLOOSE\n\nTRUMP PLAZA, ATLANTIC CITY\n\n“FLEET FEET NEVER MISS A BEAT IN ‘FOOTLOOSE”\n\n…a brisk, feel-good show…\n\n…the actors infuse the familiar story with urgency… ”\n\n– Kevin Clapp, The Press of Atlantic City\n\nMY FAIR LADY\n\nSURFLIGHT THEATRE\n\n“…musicals flourish under [Lucas’] touch.”\n\n“This is a great big, ear-to-ear smile-and-laugh-out-loud pleasure.”\n\n– Bre Golden, The Islander\n\nTHE OLD MAID & THE THIEF /\n\nTHE BUS TO BUENOS AIRES (premiere)\n\nDOOR COUNTY OPERA\n\n“WORLD PREMIERE OF OPERA A SUCCESS”\n\n“The ensemble was remarkably tight and to the point, Elizabeth A. Lucas’ direction missing no detail in bringing this tipsy entertainment to life.”\n\n– Erik Eriksson, Door County Advocate"
