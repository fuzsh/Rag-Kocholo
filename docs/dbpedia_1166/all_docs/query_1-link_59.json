        "text": "Ten autumns ago Robert ' Schnitzer and Marcella Cisney arrived in Ann Arbor in 1961 at the invitation of President Harían Hatcher to créate a pioneering pilot project in academie sponsorship of professional theatre at the University. They flew from Trinidad where they had waved off an all-star company headed by Helen Hay es, June Havoc and Leif Erickson on a tour of Latin America, administered by Schnitzer, and staged by Miss Cisney for the State Department. As executive director of the International Cultural Exchange Program, Schnitzer had sent over 3,000 U.S. performing artists to 125 nations as cultural ambassadors. Miss Cisney had staged operas for New York City Opera Company, directed network televisión for CBS, set up the American performing arts program at the Brussels Fair and directed regional and Off Broadway theatres. During the decade since their Michigan advent, the Schnitzers (they are husband and wife) have established the innovative and successful Professional Theatre Program which has made Ann Arbor \"one of the leading regional theatre centers in the country,\" according to the New York Times. Tuesday's dedication of the Power Center for the Performing Arts on the U-M campus will climax ten seasons of accomplishment. The Power Center is being launched by the Schnitzers' premiere of a new musical, \"The Grass Harp,\" based on the Truman Capote novel, starring Celeste Holm, Barbara Cook, Ruth Ford and Carol Brice, staged by. Ellis Rabb prior to Broadway. Book and lyrics are by Kenwood Elmslie, with music by i Claibe Richardson, sets and lighting are designed by James Tilton, and dances by I Rhoda Levine. I Exactly 125 professional I productions of classic and I contemporary works of scope I and excellence have been I presented since 1961 for the I academie, community and reI gional audience bringing to I the campus a roster of leading I actors, directors and design ers. __ Directors Ellis Rabb, William Ball, John Houseman, I Jean Gascón, Allen Fletcher, I John Hirsch, Alan Schneider, Stephen Porter, Edward I son Cali, David Wheeler and I Arthur Storch, working with I designers Jo Mielziner, Ed Wittstein, Jules Fisher, Jane I Greenwood, Peter Wexler, I Robin Wagner, Eldon Eider, I James Tilton, Nancy Potts, I and Ruben Ter-arutunian, and I with such players as Helen I Hayes, James Stewart, Brian I Bedford, Tammy Grimes, Will I \"Geer, Ruby Dee, Moses Gunn.l Abbey Lincoln, Victor Buono, Cathleen Nesbitt, James Whit-I more, Cathy Burns, Rose-I mary Harris, Eva Le Gal-I lienne, William Hutt, Douglasl Rain, Kate Reid, Shepherdl Strudwick, Keene Curtis, Ju-I dith Anderson, Michael O'Sul-l 1 i v a n , Donald Moffat and I H u r d Hatfield, have par-I ticipated in productions pre-l s e n t e d under Professional I Theatre Programs aegis. Five major companies have I been invited to Michigan, 1 cluding the APA for eight 1 sons, the ACT, the Phoenix I Theatre, the Actors Company, I and the Stratford Canada Shakespeare Festival. \"The Grass Harp\" will 'be the 20th production to proceed from Ann Arbor to New York, including such hits as \"Harvey,\" \"War & Peace,\" \"You Can't Take It With You,\" \"An Evening's Frost,\" \"Pantagleize,\" \"School for Wives\" and \"Private Lives.\" Over 50 per cent of the program's audiences are made up of students. Thousands of high school students have attended program performances at nominal admission; tens of thousands of university students have had their performing arts horizons widened via substantial subscription discounts; theatregoers have been drawn from three states and from Canada. On Tuesday, when the lights blaze in the festive glass walled foyer of the new Power Center, Schnitzer and Miss Cisney will experience the sense of having made a creative contribution to the history of A m e ri can regional theatre. Theirs was one of the first such projeets in the U.S. Today, there are over a 100 I colleges and universities with I professional drama programs, I Schnitzer is a leader of this I movement as executive 1 tor of the University Resident I Theatre Association."
