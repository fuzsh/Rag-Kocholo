        "text": "On Snow Leopard\n\nHarper's most impressive achievement is that he's found a way to divorce rock opera from song form, to make vernacular music continuous without falling into the staticness of Ashley or Glass.\n\nKyle Gann, Village Voice\n\nHarper has the singular ability to be able to write long - seemingly unending - legato musical lines of extraordinary beauty, and to be able to compose for the human voice as well. In this sense his writing reminds me of that of Bellini. Bravo for this premiere!\n\nPatrick Smith, Opera News\n\nHarper's sensual, electronic score adds resonances and nuances that confound the literal and specific. Instead of the expected local color - Oriental Idioms - he uses American pop: gospel, rock and rap recitations. Rather than a series of stop and go numbers, the music flows organically and dramatically from one idiom to another, highlighted and supported by the inventive electronic instrumentation.\n\nMichael Anthony, Minneapolis Star Tribune\n\nA seamless blend of choral music, dialogue, and strong visual imagery, Snow Leopard presents a dark night of the soul that succeeds not only as music but as theater. This is terrific to look at and to listen to.\n\nRobert Collins, Twin Cities Reader\n\nOn Peyote Roadkill\n\nIf there can be such a thing as a Chicago style of serious music theater, Harper embodies it.\n\nKyle Gann, Chicago Reader\n\nPeyote Roadkill is one of the most elaborate displays of theatrical spectacle I've seen in Chicago (and that includes Cats ). Some of the visual effects are weirdly beautiful, like a Chicago Imagist canvas come to life.\n\nAlbert Williams, Chicago Reader\n\nThe most innovative work on Chicago's burgeoning entertainment sceneit captures a surreal, otherworldly quality that makes this production a must seeEveryone should experience a unique work like Peyote Roadkill just once in their lives.\n\nFred Nuccio, Lerner Newspaper\n\nWilliam Harper the composer is richly inventive and resourcefuland has a fine ear for music and deep insights into the power of sound.\n\nHedy Weiss, Chicago Tribune"
