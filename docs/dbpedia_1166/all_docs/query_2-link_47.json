        "text": "At what age did you start composing? Who or what circumstance inspired you to compose?\n\nI was seven or eight. I had been making up music before that to play on my recorder, but writing out with note letter names and no system of denoting rhythm, as I had no notation skills. My Auntie Betty taught me some basics and helped me write a song, a setting of ‘The Owl and the Pussy-Cat’, which I immediately expanded into a piano suite, embellishing the story with a capture by pirates, a typhoon and then a divorce, on grounds of incompatibility.\n\nIs there a particular composer with whom you feel a special affinity?\n\nI’m a music nerd, so I have lists of them. For my work, I feel close to Monteverdi, Berlioz, Janáček, Stravinsky, Ravel, Weill, Ligeti and Morton Feldman. I have a special nostalgic place for what I call my ‘pet’ composers, Mussorgsky, Rimsky-Korsakov, much French opera, Verdi. I could go on!\n\nDo you prefer to compose for singers or instrumentalists? Was it a new challenge to write for period instruments?\n\nI love variety, but it is more challenging for me to write a piece without words. I get so much from the rhythm and energy of words and convert those attributes into musical material. I do love working with singers, and molding a piece around the special attributes of an individual voice. I also relish concocting unexpected colors with instruments. Yes, writing for period instruments was a real venture into the unknown for me, and I’m almost apprehensive to hear realized what I have conceived in my mind’s ear. I hope I’ve got it right! I love the quality of sound, the difference in bowing style, the disparity of timbre, it sounds more sinewy, compact to me, somehow.\n\nHow did you come to choose a children’s book in verse Three Ladies Beside the Sea by Rhoda Levine for Sarasa’s commission?\n\nRhoda is a very distinguished opera director who started her career as a dancer on Broadway, got into the orbit of Spoleto, Barber, Menotti and it was Luchino Visconti, no less, who suggested she should be a director. We met in an elevator in Banff, Canada, in 1986, and she dragged me off to a drama improvisation class. She had a sideline in writing children’s books, dating mainly from the 1960’s; and when she became godmother to my daughters, she gave us signed copies. We always regretted never having worked together in the theatre, so in setting this children’s book, finally our names appear on the bill side by side.\n\nWe understand you have lived in China, Japan and Hong Kong, and learned to play Yang Qin — the Butterfly Harp. What is this instrument, and did your musical experiences with it have an effect on the layers of rhythmic and harmonic language you pursue in your compositions?\n\nAfter a year of living in Beijing, and progressing very slowly at learning Chinese, I decided to give it up and my family bought me, for a birthday present, a Yang Qin. This is a large dulcimer that you hit with beaters, and is, in fact, a sort of continuo instrument for a Chinese opera band. It is strung from top to bottom, and there are sets of strings side by side, so it takes an eternity to master a simple scale! Eventually I wrote a small piece for it. Certain aspects of Asian music really chimed with me; the linear thinking, a simple musical line embellished, the horizontal aspect of music, the harmonic support being more incidental. I did purchase instruments in Central Asia and Mongolia when I travelled there, and I found the mix of the musics, a touch of the middle East and India included, incredibly absorbing.\n\nWhat piece of music would you take to your desert island? Which book?\n\nOnly one?? Well today it might be Monteverdi’s ‘Possente spirto’ form ‘Orfeo’, or maybe Yaroslavna’s lament from Borodin’s ‘Prince Igor’. Tomorrow will, doubtless, be different. I get a real workout from reading Shakespeare’s plays, but I might take Tove Jansson’s Moomin books instead - or maybe a thriller by Wilkie Collins.\n\nIt is the Chinese New Year of the Pig— What was the most unexpected food you tasted in Asia?\n\nI tried a real ‘Thousand Year Egg’ (Pídàn) once. The egg is buried in a mix of clay, ash, salt and more for weeks or months, the yolk turns dark green, sombre red or grey, and the white becomes a brownish-black jelly. Very salty. It’s a real delicacy. Once was enough.\n\nAbout Rhoda Levine:\n\nPrimarily known as a pioneering opera director and choreographer, Rhoda Levine has also written several children’s books, including Three Ladies Beside the Sea, which Julian Grant has chosen for his commissioned new work with Sarasa. The late Edward Gorey illustrated this book back in 1963, and it was re-issued by the New York Review of Books in 2010. It’s a gem! www.nyrb.com/products/three-ladies-beside-the-sea?variant=1094934797\n\nA documentary film is currently being made about Rhoda Levine, and you can have a sneak preview of the trailer for the film here: IFP page for DIRECTING RHODA: THE ARTS OF LIVING\n\nIn memory of Sanford Sylan"
