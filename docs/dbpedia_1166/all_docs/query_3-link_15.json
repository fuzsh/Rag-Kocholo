        "text": "An opera written in secret by inmates of a concentration camp during the second world war will be given its American debut in San Francisco on Thursday. Written by the Czech composer Viktor Ullmann and librettist Peter Kien while they were in the Theresienstadt camp in Czechoslovakia, The Emperor of Atlantis has been hailed abroad as a powerful discovery and will be performed by San Francisco's Spring Opera Theatre.\n\nUllmann and Kien were moved to Auschwitz and died there. The manuscript surfaced after the war in bits and pieces, apparently passed on from inmate to inmate during the war years. Four years ago, it came into the hands of Kerry Woodward, a young Welsh conductor. \"It intrigued me,\" he said. \"I so loved the music I just worked on it until something came of it.\"\n\nRhoda Levine, director of the Spring Opera Theatre, said that in the work: \"Death takes a holiday. People cannot die. But the problem is that without death, the Kaiser of Atlantis loses his power, because without death, people lose their fear.\"\n\nClearly, she says, the Kaiser is Hitler. \"Peter Kien never said that, but there are too many provocative things in the opera. There's one perceptive detail about the Kaiser: he never speaks to anyone. He only speaks to telephones, loudspeakers and code machines. He can't communicate to anyone except machines.\"\n\nKerry Woodward said the manuscript apparently was written over a long period of time. \"There's one fairly thick sheaf of paper of the same type, then after that the original is in all different sizes, bits and scraps of very thin paper,\" he said. \"I spent a great deal of time with a magnifying glass trying to read ink that had run through.\"\n\nThe camp at Theresienstadt consisted of a small garrison village in which 70,000 people were confined and was a stopping off station for Auschwitz.\n\n\"There were enough professional musicians, I imagine, because it was a camp set aside for the intelligentsia, and they had interned so many artists from the Prague Opera and Symphony.\"\n\nMiss Levine said the inmates were permitted some cultural activities, but Ullmann needed a cover story to write and rehearse The Emperor of Atlantis. \"The story is that they were doing Don Giovanni, and Ullmann asked if he could write an opera,\" Miss Levine said. \"The Germans approved of that. As a matter of fact, they typed the libretto.\"\n\nThe typed libretto was one of two, and was a gruesome reminder of the opera's circumstance â€“ it was written on the back of entrance forms. The reverse sides had been filled out by people coming into the camp.\n\nThe Emperor of Atlantis was first seen in Amsterdam in 1975. It was originally written in German, and has been translated to English for the San Francisco performance."
