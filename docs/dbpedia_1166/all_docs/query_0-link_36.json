In addition to working for major opera houses in the United States and Europe, she has choreographed shows in New York and in London's West End.\n\nLevine has taught acting and improvisation at the Yale School of Drama, the Curtis Institute of Music, and Northwestern University, and is currently on the faculty of the Manhattan School of Music and the Mannes College of Music. She lives in New York, where she is the artistic director of the city's only improvisational opera company, Play It by Ear.\n\nAlastair Reid is a poet, a prose chronicler, a translator, and a traveler. Born in Scotland, he came to the United States in the early 1950s, began publishing his poems in The New Yorker in 1951, and for the next fifty-odd years was a traveling correspondent for that magazine. He has published more than forty books. The substance of one of the books, Supposing…, he gleaned from the many children who have influenced him, to all of whom he owes and dedicates the text. He lives in New York City.\n\nFulvio Testa is one of Italy's most distinguished artists and illustrators and has had many exhibitions in the United States and Europe. In addition to his own prize-winning titles, he has illustrated books by authors such as Anthony Burgess and Gianni Rodari. He divides his time between New York City and Italy."
