The Tiffanyâs house.\n\nSynopsis: The pretentious New Yorker Mrs. Tiffany has illusions of social grandeur and surrounds herself with culture, has an all-French staff, and entertains anyone she believes has aristocratic connections. Mrs. Tiffany insists that her daughter Seraphina wed the Count di Jolimaitre even though she does not love him. Mr. Tiffany prefers more down-to-earth society and is often seen with Adam Trueman, a businessman with some sketchy legal episodes in his past. When the calculating Mr. Snobson get hold of damaging information, he tries to blackmail Trueman and aims to marry Seraphina himself. A long-lost granddaughter of Truemanâs helps him save his reputation, and she also exposes the count as nothing more than a French chef named Gustave Treadmill. Mr. Tiffany puts his foot down and sends his wife and daughter to stay in the simple rustic country home of Trueman to learn less refined values.
