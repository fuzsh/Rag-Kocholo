        "text": "I attended the University of California, Berkeley, in the early 1960's, where my teachers included Seymour Shifrin, Andrew Imbrie, and David Lewin. I was also deeply influenced by my fellow students Douglas Leedy and John Patrick Thomas. Another important aspect of my education was my work in the music department of KPFA, the first listener-supported radio station in the country. I served under three KPFA music directors, all of them composers: Glenn Glasow, Will Ogden, and Charles Shere. I then moved to the East Coast and earned an MFA at Princeton University, working with Milton Babbitt and Edward T. Cone. But the teacher who influenced me most profoundly - my true mentor - was Earl Kim. His exquisite music and goal of \"reducing everything to its maximum\" inspires me to this day.\n\nIt was while I was studying at Princeton in the mid-1960's that I was fatally seduced by the music of the Beatles and Motown, and began a life-long creative and scholarly involvement with popular music. While living in New York City briefly in 1966-67, I wrote rock music criticism for Cheetah magazine and did some arranging and musical direction for Definition, the first (and only) album by an extraordinary band, Chrysalis.\n\nThe commercial music industry felt scary to me, though, and I decided that I would be more comfortable in a university environment. Thanks to Earl Kim's recommendation, I was elected a Junior Fellow at the Harvard University Society of Fellows, where I spent three years composing (mostly my Humoresque, a mammoth 40-minute long piano piece), investigating the history of American popular music, and starting a family with my wife, Judy (now Judy Eda) - my daughter Maria was born in early 1969, and my son Paul was born in 1970.\n\nI went from Harvard to a teaching position at Stony Brook University, where I taught for 42 years. I was incredibly lucky to get in on the ground floor of a music department which has grown into an internationally respected institution - and one where my quirky proclivities were not only tolerated but encouraged. For many years I taught a course in Rock music to classes of up to 500 students.\n\nDuring my first seven years at Stony Brook I worked on a large-scale Symphony which was premiered at the grand opening ceremonies of Stony Brook's Fine Arts Center (now the Staller Center), conducted by my old friend David Lawton. The last movement of the Symphony, composed at the MacDowell Colony in 1978, was a turning point for me: it was unabashedly tonal, and ended with a lilting Caribbean melody. I have also composed a number of occasional pieces for Stony Brook, including its Alma Mater.\n\nIn the early 1980's I took a break from writing concert music, and turned to musical theater. I served an apprenticeship of sorts at Theatre Three in Port Jefferson, N.Y., writing music for several cabaret shows, one of which, Professionally Speaking, went on to an Off-Broadway run in New York city and several productions by regional theaters. \"Tamara, Queen of the Nile,\" from this show (lyrics by Ernst Muller), has become a staple in the cabaret repertories of William Bolcom and Joan Morris, and, through them, of several other cabaret acts. I've continued to write \"show\" music, much of it with my dear friend, Winston Clark, who was the conductor of the Connecticut Gay Men's Chorus. Our magnum opus was Out! (1997), a full-length musical based on the actual experiences of guys in the chorus."
