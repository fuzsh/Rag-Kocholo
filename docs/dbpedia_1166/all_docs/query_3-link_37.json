        "text": "Among the things Laura Levine wanted people to know about her were that she believed “a good friend is priceless” and that she “adored firemen and policemen simply because they choose to be in a profession that is so selfless.” Laura, who died unexpectedly from unknown causes at her home in Stafford, Virginia, on November 9, was a priceless friend to many and often anonymously attended the funerals of fire and police personnel to honor their sacrifice.\n\nOf all her accomplishments, Laura was most proud of her work as an emergency medical technician. Even when she was off-duty, she would stop at accident scenes to offer her assistance to attending paramedics and police.\n\nFrom the time she was a young adult, Laura faced serious medical challenges, but her resilience, optimism, and love of life shone through.\n\nLaura will be lovingly remembered by her parents, Alice and Judah Levine; her sister, Amy Levine; her grandmother, Ina Cohen; aunts and uncles Beatrice and Berthold Lippel, George and Susan Cohen, Aaron and Rhoda Levine; and many cousins, their spouses, and children. She will be sorely missed by dear family friends, including Evi and Bruce Bassoff, Lynn and Al Malkinson, Gretchen Stein, Miriam Gilbert, Jeanie Fugate-Jones, and their children and families. We will all cherish the memory of Laura’s great smile, loving nature, and the joy she brought to our lives.\n\nThe Levines are profoundly grateful to everyone in our extended Boulder “family” and elsewhere for tender support and loving-kindness.\n\nA remembrance of Laura will be held on Sunday, December 12, at 5 p.m. at the Chautauqua Community House in Chautauqua Park, 900 Baseline Road, Boulder.\n\nIn lieu of flowers, please consider a donation in Laura’s name to the Wounded Warrior Project www.woundedwarriorproject.org"
