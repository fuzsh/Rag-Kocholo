        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger is a decorated name not just in one or two but multiple fields. Spending most of his life in front of the public eyes, Schwarzenegger‘s life has been an open book. Today we bring to you all that you’d want to know about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s family.\n\nHere is all you need to know about the famous Arnold Schwarzenegger’s parents\n\nThe famous bodybuilder and Hollywood actor, Arnold Schwarzenegger was born to Gustav Schwarzenegger and Aurelia Jadrny on 30th July 1947. Before Arnold Schwarzenegger’s birth, his father had been a part of the German army until 1945. Though he was also revealed to be a member of the Nazi party, no evidence has been found about him ever being involved in a war crime. After the end of Nazi rule in 1947, Gustav took a post as a police chief in Austria. He served in that position until he died in 1972. Gustav Schwarzenegger was buried in Weiz Cemetery, in Steiermark, Austria after his death on 13th December 1972.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nArticle continues below this ad\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s mother, on the other hand, was a homemaker. Growing up, Arnie was close to his mother, and it remained the same until she passed away. Aurelia Jadrny Schwarzenegger suffered a heart attack while visiting her husband’s grave in Weiz, Austria. After his mother’s death, Schwarzenegger confessed that his “world has fallen apart.” On 2nd August 1998, Arnold Schwarzenegger lost not just his mother but his “first love” and the foundation of his success too.\n\nA brief about Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver’s marriage life\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver first met through a mutual friend after Robert F. Kennedy’s pro-celebrity tennis tournament in 1977. They began dating soon after. Schwarzenegger had reportedly proposed to Shriver twice before she said ‘Yes’ on the third attempt in 1985. Ultimately, after eight years of dating, the duo tied the knot in 1986. They stayed together for 25 years and parted ways in 2011. However, it took another 10 years for their divorce to be finalized. On 28 December 2021, their martial status was legally declared single.\n\nRead More: “Look at His Pants!”: Arnold Schwarzenegger Was Left Publicly “Embarrassed” by Ex-Wife Maria Shriver and Her Cousins Once\n\nThe reason behind Schwarzenegger and Shriver’s public divorce\n\nDuring their 25 years of marriage, Arnold Schwarzenegger’s alleged extramarital affair rumors had made rounds on countless occasions. However, Maria Shriver always turned a blind eye to it “publicly.” However, the news of Schwarzenegger’s affair with a house help was when Shriver finally snapped. While the previous rumors were with Arnold’s co-stars, this time it involved some who closely worked with Shriver in their house. Moreover, the affair with the house help, Mildred Baena, cannot be overlooked as a rumor as Schwarzenegger had fathered a child during the fling.\n\nAdditionally, the child had a striking resemblance to the star. Soon after the news broke out in 2011, Maria Shriver left the house she lived in with Arnold Schwarzenegger and filed for a divorce.\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s relationship with Mildered Baena\n\nIn 1996, the Terminator actor got involved in a sexual relationship with his housekeeper, Mildred Patricia Baena. The first encounter reportedly happened when Schwarzenegger’s family was on a vacation but he had to stay back for a shoot. However, it wasn’t a one-time thing and did not end after the family returned. On the contrary, the affair allegedly went on for a year right under Shriver’s nose in her own house. Mildred Baena worked for the Schwarzenegger family for nearly 20 years until she “retired” on good terms with severance pay in 2011.\n\nAll the five children of Arnold Schwarzenegger\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger is a father of five, 2 daughters and 3 sons, four of which he shares with now ex-wife Maria Shriver. His eldest daughter, Katherine Schwarzenegger was born on 13 December 1989. She has grown up to be an author. Schwarzenegger’s second child, his younger daughter Christina was born on 23rd July 1991. Following in her father’s footsteps, Christina took up acting as her profession.\n\nSchwarzenegger’s third born, his eldest son Patrick was born on 18th September 1993. Just like his father, Patrick too is an actor, investor, and entrepreneur. Schwarzenegger’s youngest son with Maria Shriver, Christopher Schwarzenegger was born on 27th September 1997. Unlike the rest of his family, Christopher prefers staying away from the limelight. Hence not much is known about him.\n\nWatch This Story: Living Legend Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Daughter Katherine Reveals Her Dad Has Pony At Home For Her Daughters\n\nArnold Schwarzenegger’s youngest child, Joseph Baena was born less than a week later, on 2nd October 1997. Joseph Baena has more in common with his father than just his face. Baena has taken up bodybuilding and is now gearing up for good acting roles in Hollywood too.\n\nThe relationship between Arnold Schwarzengger and his son Joseph Baena\n\nThough Arnold Schwarzenegger had an affair with Mildred Baena and the kid was born not long after, Arnold Schwarzenegger for the longest time believed that Mildred’s husband was the child’s father. It took eight years for Arnie to realize that the child was his. The realization occurred when little Joseph started resembling his biological father. However, even then Arnold kept the news to himself. Only after the media attention in 2011, did Arnold Schwarzenegger take responsibility for his youngest son.\n\nKnow why Joseph Baena does not use his father’s surname\n\nEven after discovering who his real father is, Joseph Baena prefers to continue with his original surname. In an interview with Men’s Health, Baena revealed why he won’t take up the Schwarzenegger title. Joseph Baena says, though he has an influential father, he wants to make a name for himself. Baena claimed he is too “prideful” to use his dad’s name and contact to move ahead in life. While by now everyone knows whose son he is, Joseph Baena wants his achievements in the future to be credited in his name. But this will never happen if he adds Schwarzenegger to his name. Joseph Baena wants to work hard to get what he wants instead of relying on “handouts.”\n\nHow are Hollywood superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger and Chris Pratt related?\n\nBy now Schwarzenegger’s family is a star-studded family with most of its members being public figures. Coincidently, the addition to the family is also a popular actor. Arnold Schwarzenegger is also related to the Guardians of the Galaxy actor, Chris Pratt, through his eldest daughter Katherine. Katherine Schwarzenegger married Chris Pratt in 2019. As of now, with Christina Schwarzenegger enjoying her spinster days, Chris Pratt is Arnold Schwarzenegger’s only son-in-law.\n\nRead More: “He Didn’t Try and Pick Me”: Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Daughter Recalls First-Meeting With Husband Chris Pratt\n\nSome of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s adorable family moments\n\nWith the knowledge we’ve gained about the family, it’s time to look at some of the most adorable they have shared over the years.
