        "text": "Fans of Patrick Schwarzenegger apparently ask if he has “any relation to Arnold,” said the ‘Gen V’ actor\n\nPeople are still shocked to learn Patrick Schwarzenegger is the son of Arnold Schwarzenegger.\n\n“It’s really funny to me when people ask if I have any relation to Arnold when they see my last name,” said the 30-year-old son of the Terminator actor in a June 27 post on X.\n\nPatrick, who plays superhuman Golden Boy on The Boys’ spinoff Gen V, was posting in reaction to an X user's epiphany that the two Schwarzeneggers are in fact father and son. “How am I just finding out that Golden Boy from Gen V is Arnold Schwarzenegger’s son,” wrote the viewer.\n\nRelated: Chris Pratt Jokes He Has Finally Learned How to Spell Schwarzenegger: 'It's a Long Name'\n\nAs Patrick pointed out in his response, it’s unlikely two people with such a moniker wouldn’t be related. Schwarzenegger is “really not a common last name,” he joked.\n\nThe actor and model is one of Arnold’s five kids. The former governor of California also shares daughters Katherine, 34, and Christina, 31, and son Christopher, 26, with ex-wife Maria Shriver, plus son Joseph Baena, 26, with Mildred Patricia Baena.\n\nRelated: Maria Shriver Says Being on Shark Tank Was Son Patrick Schwarzenegger's 'Bucket List' Item: 'Dream Come True' (Exclusive)\n\nNever miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nPatrick, who in addition to Gev V has appeared in episodes of The Staircase and The Terminal List, will next star in season 3 of The White Lotus.\n\n“I can’t wait to visit you on set,\" wrote Shriver, 68, on Instagram when her son's casting on one of her \"favorite shows of all time\" was announced in January.\n\n“I fell in love with going to set with my dad,” Patrick told Teen Vogue magazine in 2015. “The best thing about acting is portraying a character that has a different life than yours.”\n\nRelated: Arnold Schwarzenegger Learned About Football Through His Kids: 'They Would Explain to Me the Rules' (Exclusive)\n\nArnold, meanwhile, also continues to garner screen credits. Following the 2023 docuseries about his life as a bodybuilder, actor and politician, he has starred in the series FUBAR and in State Farm commercials. A movie reuniting him with Twins and Junior costar Danny DeVito is also reportedly in the works.\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!"
