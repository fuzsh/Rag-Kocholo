        "text": "Arnold Schwarzenegger is a proud dad to five children.\n\nThe Terminator star and former Governor of California shares four kids with ex-wife Maria Shriver: daughters Katherine, 34, and Christina, 31, and sons Patrick, 30, and Christopher, 26.\n\nIn 2011, the actor publicly revealed that he had fathered another child, son Joseph Baena, 26, with his longtime housekeeper Mildred Patricia Baena. Shriver filed for divorce in May 2011 after 25 years of marriage.\n\n\"We are continuing to parent our four children together. They are the light and center of both of our lives,\" Shriver and Schwarzenegger said in a joint statement at the time of their split.\n\nDuring an appearance on The Howard Stern Show in 2015, the former bodybuilder addressed the scandal, calling it \"a very tough situation for my kids, very tough situation for my family. It was tough for everybody. But it has happened and now we have to figure it out, right?\"\n\nHe added that his relationship with his kids was \"fantastic, including my fifth child with Mildred.\" The actor called Joseph \"terrific,\" saying that \"he totally understands the situation. So, it all has worked out.\"\n\nIn addition to fatherhood, Schwarzenegger is now a grandfather of two: daughter Katherine welcomed daughters of her own, Lyla Maria in 2020 and Eloise Christina. \"It's the easiest thing to be a grandfather,\" he told Jimmy Kimmel earlier this year.\n\n\"They come over to the house, you play with Lyla for around an hour or two, put her on the horse, put her with the dog. And after two hours, they leave,\" he joked, adding, \"It's fantastic! I have a great time when they come over to the house.\"\n\nHere's everything to know about Arnold Schwarzenegger's five children.\n\nKatherine Eunice Schwarzenegger Pratt, 34\n\nKatherine Schwarzenegger is the oldest child of Schwarzenegger and Shriver. Born on Dec. 13, 1989, in Los Angeles, her middle name honors her maternal grandmother, Eunice Kennedy — younger sister of President John F. Kennedy.\n\nDespite being born into a political family, Katherine has long maintained that she has no interest in that field. \"Absolutely not, politics is not my thing,\" she told PEOPLE in 2016. \"I think if you grow up in it, you either love it or you're like, 'No thank you!' \"\n\nIn 2010, she became a New York Times best-selling author at 21 years old after publishing her first book, Rock What You've Got: Secrets to Loving Your Inner and Outer Beauty from Someone Who's Been There and Back.\n\nTwo years later, Katherine graduated from the University of Southern California and published another self-help book, I Just Graduated . . . Now What? to help fellow recent grads navigate life in the \"real world.\"\n\nShe also wrote Maverick and Me, a children's book about her rescue dog, in 2017 and The Gift of Forgiveness in 2020. The author is a longtime animal rights advocate and ambassador for Best Friends Animal Society and the ASPCA.\n\n\"I love my daughter Katherine,\" Schwarzenegger said during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in February 2022. \"[She] is so wonderful and I'm so proud of her.\"\n\nHe's also a fan of Katherine's husband, Chris Pratt, calling him \"a fantastic guy\" and \"great son-in-law.\"\n\nKatherine began dating the Jurassic World star in 2018 after meeting at church. The two got engaged the following January and tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in June 2019. In 2020, the pair welcomed their first child together, daughter Lyla; two years later, they welcomed another daughter, Eloise.\n\nKatherine spoke about being a working mom and the benefits of asking for help while attending DSW's \"Best Foot Forward\" panel luncheon event in March 2023.\n\n\"I feel like on Instagram we see all these moms that are like, 'I'm doing it all, I'm doing it all, I'm doing it all on my own,' blah-blah and I'm like, 'I don't want to do it all on my own,' \" the mom-of-two said.\n\nShe explained that asking for help can be \"a big struggle for women in general,\" adding, \"I think especially if you're balancing multiple roles, is saying, 'I need help today,' and that's okay.\"\n\nSchwarzenegger spoke about watching his daughter become a mother while attending the May 2023 premiere of his Netflix series Fubar along with Pratt, Katherine and Christina.\n\n“It's nice to see your kids having kids themselves and to watch this new dimension,” Schwarzenegger told PEOPLE. “You see them growing up and you see them going to school and getting smart and getting their degrees, getting their jobs and all this, but now seeing them be a parent? It's fantastic. It's really great.”\n\nHe also praised Katherine's parenting skills. \"It's really fun to watch and hang out with her now and to see the way she'll react to the kids because she is so great with them,” the actor said.\n\nKatherine returned the love by posting on Instagram for Father's Day 2023. She included a snap of Pratt and Schwarzenegger smiling as they each held a cigar. \"Happy fathers to day to these guys!\" she wrote in the caption. \"We love you a big one!\"\n\nKatherine celebrated her dad again when he turned 76 in July 2023. She shared a throwback photo of the father-daughter duo hugging along with the caption: \"Happy birthday daddy @schwarzenegger ♥️ we love you!\"\n\nChristina Maria Aurelia Schwarzenegger, 31\n\nSchwarzenegger's second daughter with Shriver, Christina Schwarzenegger, was born in Los Angeles on July 23, 1991.\n\nFollowing in her mother's footsteps, she graduated from Georgetown University (Shriver's alma mater) in 2013 with a bachelor's degree in English. She later studied interior architecture at Parsons School of Design and worked as an editor at Gwyneth Paltrow's lifestyle brand Goop for three years, where she covered all things health and wellness.\n\nChristina is also a founding member of the Special Olympics Founder's Council. \"I love shining a light on those who feel outside the margins and bringing their experiences to light. The result is that we all feel validated and, ultimately, see that our differences are in fact, our superpowers,\" Christina said, according to the Special Olympics' website.\n\nShe and Shriver co-executive produced Netflix's 2018 documentary Take Your Pills, which explored Christina's experiences with Adderall addiction and how societal pressures contribute to abusing the controlled substance.\n\nTo celebrate his younger daughter's 30th birthday in 2021, Schwarzenegger shared a heartfelt post on social media, which included photos of the father-daughter duo.\n\n\"Happy birthday, my little sweetheart (schpatzl)!\" he wrote, revealing his nickname for her. \"I can't believe you're 30! I am so proud of you, from your unbelievable work on enlightening documentaries to giving back by helping Special Olympics to your fantastic artwork that blows mine out of the water. I enjoy nothing more than hanging out with you, whether we are training together or traveling the world. You will always be my little Leo and I love you!\"\n\nPatrick Arnold Shriver Schwarzenegger, 30\n\nPatrick Schwarzenegger was born on Sept. 18, 1993, in Los Angeles, and is the third child between Schwarzenegger and Shriver.\n\nAn actor and model, he is currently pursuing a career in Hollywood. Patrick made his big screen debut with a brief cameo in 2006's Benchwarmers and has since added movies like Netflix's Moxie in 2021 and HBO Max's true crime series The Staircase in 2022 to his résumé.\n\n\"Both my parents are proud of me,\" Patrick told Today in 2020 about following in his dad's acting footsteps. \"It's pretty surreal 'cause I remember growing up and going to set with [my dad] and it was like my favorite activity.\"\n\n\"He's really proud of me and they're so supportive,\" Patrick added. \"I couldn't ask for a better parent duo.\"\n\nIn a birthday tribute to Patrick on his 28th birthday in 2021, Arnold shared adorable throwback shots of the pair and told his eldest son: \"I love you, I'm proud of you, and watching you grow every day in every way is one of my greatest joys. Your business is booming, your acting career is taking off, but most importantly, you never forget to reach out and help others.\"\n\nIn December 2023, the USC Marshall School of Business graduate announced his engagement to longtime girlfriend Abby Champion in a joint Instagram post that showed their beach proposal (and her new ring).\n\n\"💍❤️FOREVER AND EVER ❤️💍,\" said the caption.\n\nThe pair had been dating since September 2015, following his split from Miley Cyrus.\n\nChristopher Sargent Shriver Schwarzenegger, 26\n\nChristopher Schwarzenegger was born on Sept. 27, 1997, in Los Angeles.\n\nThe youngest child of Shriver and Schwarzenegger has stayed largely out of the spotlight. In 2020, he graduated from the University of Michigan — but due to restrictions from the coronavirus pandemic, he graduated online. Schwarzenegger took the opportunity to celebrate his son on Instagram, photoshopping an image of Christopher in a cap and gown in front of the University of Michigan emblem.\n\n\"Christopher, you are a champion and I love you,\" the proud dad captioned the photo. \"I know your graduation from Michigan wasn't the big celebration you dreamed about for years, but walking across a stage isn't what makes me so proud of you: it's your compassion, your hard work, your vision, your critical thinking, and your selflessness that make me burst with pride. I can't wait to watch you keep climbing and succeeding.\"\n\nTo celebrate Christopher's 24th birthday in 2021, Schwarzenegger shared a trio of sweet photos of the pair and revealed that Christopher has a handful of active hobbies. \"Between your boxing classes, your weightlifting classes, your stretching classes, your cycling classes, and on and on, I can't even keep up with you!\" he wrote. \"I love you and I'm proud of you every day!\"\n\nJoseph Baena, 26\n\nJoseph Baena is the son of Schwarzenegger and his longtime housekeeper, Mildred Patricia Baena. He was born on Oct. 2, 1997. His mother kept his identity a secret for the first seven or eight years of his life until his resemblance to his father became apparent.\n\nSchwarzenegger detailed his affair with Mildred in his Netflix docuseries, Arnold, which premiered in June 2023. And while he called his infidelity a \"major failure,\" the Kindergarten Cop actor made it clear that he's proud to call Joseph his son.\n\n\"It was wrong what I did. But I don’t want to make Joseph feel that he is not welcomed in this world — because he is very much welcomed in this world,\" Schwarzenegger said. \"I love him and he has turned out to be an extraordinary young man.\"\n\nThe two grew closer later in life, Joseph revealed during an appearance on Sophia and Sistine Stallone's Unwaxed podcast in January 2022. \"I also have to point out that with my relationship with my dad it took a little while for me and him to get really close and just [feel] like I can joke around with him and talk about anything,\" he said.\n\nThese days, the father-son duo can frequently be seen hitting the gym together: Joseph has followed suit as a bodybuilder and calls his dad the \"best training partner in the world.\" The 2019 Pepperdine University graduate has recreated several of his dad's famous muscle man poses on Instagram.\n\nTo celebrate Joseph's 24th birthday in 2021, Schwarzenegger shared a trio of photos on Twitter of the pair spending quality time together. \"Happy birthday Joseph! I am so proud of you and I love you! You are crushing it in the gym, in your real estate career, and in acting,\" the actor wrote alongside the shots of the pair drinking, biking and hanging out together. \"I know this will be another fantastic year.\"\n\nIn addition to bodybuilding, Joseph is a budding actor: He worked on his first movie, Bully High, in 2021. He is also a real estate agent with California-based agency ARIA Properties.\n\nJoseph also competed on season 31 of Dancing With the Stars with pro dancer Daniella Karagach.\n\nDuring an interview for the show, he was asked if Schwarzenegger might consider lacing up his dance shoes for a future season.\n\n\"This show? No, no,\" he said, adding that his dad might make an exception if Dani was his partner.\n\nJoseph went on to say that his dad is \"so happy\" and \"so proud\" of him — and his dancing.\n\n\"I love my father. He's the smartest, best man I can think of,\" the fitness model said. \"So, you know, to be compared to him, to be in the same character, Hercules — you know he played Hercules in New York. It's amazing, you know? It's awesome. And who doesn't want to be like their father, right? So, it's great.\"\n\nDuring the \"Prom Night\" episode of DWTS, Joseph and Karagach were eliminated, despite earning their highest score of the season.\n\n\"It's hard not to be shocked when you really put your heart out on the ballroom floor,\" Joseph told PEOPLE. \"To say goodbye, it's a bummer and it's a shock but I'm just really happy that I had this experience in the first place.\""
