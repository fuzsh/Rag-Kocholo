        "text": "Austrian-born Arnold Schwarzenegger is mostly known for his body building, staring in the Terminator films and standing as the governor of California.\n\nWhat is less known is that in the 1960s the world famous body builder spent some time living and training in Portsmouth.\n\nSchwarzenegger began lifting weights at the age of 15 and went on to win the Mr Universe title at age 20 in 1967.\n\nHe would then become Mr Olympia at aged 23 making him the youngest person to ever win the title.\n\nIt was during this time that Schwarzenegger also lived and trained in Portsmouth, and the city would prove vital in his success as an athlete.\n\nIn the 1960s, Schwarzenegger moved to England to further his body building career as he sought to win titles such as Mr Universe and Mr Olympia.\n\nHe trained with former competitive amateur bodybuilder Gordon Allen, who established Ed's Gym in Southsea.\n\nThe gym on Albert Road is one of two where Schwarzenegger would train. Rumours suggest that Schwarzenegger would often pay his gym membership with pints of milk when he was short of funds.\n\nThe Hollywood star also has connections to the Lougars Gym on Hellyer Road, which was originally owned by Bob Woolger.\n\nWoolger was a pioneer of bodybuilding in the 1930s and formed a close friendship with Schwarzenegger in the 1960s.\n\nHe encouraged the young Austrian and invited him to Portsmouth - his training would later lead on to many body building titles for Schwarzenegger.\n\nHis friendship with Schwarzenegger lasted years and the Austrian would return to London to organise his 80th birthday party.\n\nAfter retiring from bodybuilding, Schwarzenegger gained worldwide fame as a Hollywood action film star.\n\nIn 2003, he was elected as the Governor of California, a position he would hold until 2011.\n\nEven though Schwarzenegger has not made a return to Portsmouth, it's undeniable that his success as a body builder is a credit to the city and its gyms."
