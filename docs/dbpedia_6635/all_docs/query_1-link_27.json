        "text": "Job: chairman/CEO, Saban Capital Group\n\nAge: 60\n\nIndustry: broadcasting\n\nAnnual revenue: £3bn\n\nNet worth: $1.7bn\n\n2003 ranking: new entry\n\nWhen reference is made to foreign entrepreneurs snapping up UK media assets, the figure at the forefront of most people's minds is invariably Israeli billionaire media mogul Haim Saban.\n\nMr Saban, who made his fortune with the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, is intent on building up his media empire in Europe. Constantly talked up as the \"next big thing\", he is in danger of being portrayed as the \"nearly man\" after he missed out in the running for the Telegraph Group and, last year, the auction of the Jim Henson Group.\n\nBut the door remains open for Mr Saban thanks to last year's Communications Act - which threw open some of the UK's biggest media assets to foreign ownership - and he has already indicated his interest in launching a takeover bid for ITV.\n\nA further sign of his expansionist intent came with his hiring of two UK media heavyweights - former BBC director general Greg Dyke and ex-BSkyB chief executive Tony Ball. The pair serve on the supervisory board of Germany's largest TV company, ProSiebenSat.1, which Mr Saban bought with a group of other investors for £915m last year.\n\nMr Saban, who is based in Hollywood, made his abortive attempt to buy Telegraph parent Hollinger International with German newspaper group Axel Springer. The group was eventually bought by the Barclay brothers.\n\nHis empire began to take shape in the 1980s, when he repackaged Power Rangers for American TV audiences. It grew into a huge global franchise and was later merged with Fox Kids Network to form Fox Family Worldwide. The company was sold to Disney for $5.3bn three years ago, with Saban walking away with a cool $1.5bn."
