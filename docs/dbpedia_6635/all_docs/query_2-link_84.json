        "text": "Haim Saban, best known to us as the founder of Saban Entertainment and Saban Brands will soon be receiving his star in Hollywood.\n\nYesterday the Walk of Fame Selection Committee of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce announced their list of who would be receiving stars in 2017 in various entertainment categories.\n\nHaim Saban is most well known for his vast entertainment empire that began with his career as a musician in the 1960s. That later moved into producing and managing, and composing music for television with his business partner Shuki Levy. That eventually moved into his deals with Fox Kids which moved to Power Rangers, Digimon, and many other shows and continues with various franchises to this day (not to mention owning more things than I could list easily.)\n\nHis specific star is for what he did in the television industry.\n\nHere is the full list for 2017.\n\nIn the category of MOTION PICTURES:\n\nAmy Adams, Jason Bateman, Goldie Hawn, Dwayne Johnson, Chris Pratt, Brett Ratner, Ryan Reynolds, George A. Romero, Mark Ruffalo and Rita Wilson\n\nIn the category of TELEVISION:\n\nTyra Banks, Andre Braugher, Ken Corday, Lee Daniels, Hugh Laurie, Eva Longoria, Wolfgang Puck, Keri Russell, Haim Saban, George Segal, Sarah Silverman and Jeffrey Tambor\n\nIn the category of RECORDING:\n\nClarence Avant, Jerry Goldsmith (posthumous), Hall & Oates, Ice Cube, John Legend, *NSYNC, New Edition and Selena Quintanilla (posthumous)\n\nIn the category of RADIO:\n\nElvis Duran\n\nIn the category of LIVE THEATRE/LIVE PERFORMANCE:\n\nCriss Angel, Jeff Dunham and Gustavo Dudamel\n\nRecipients have two years to schedule their ceremonies.\n\nI know many people see him as a controversial figure for many reasons, please try and keep comments civil.\n\nThanks to our good friends at The Digimon Rewatch for this info and for AVClub and the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce for more detailed information.\n\nSome people forget how much he has done for Saturday morning entertainment. Some people also overstate how much he has done for Saturday morning entertainment. Is this star deserved? Sure there are more people who deserve one and there are those who deserve it less. But in the end he is just another guy who changed the world a little bit in more ways than any of us can ever imagine."
