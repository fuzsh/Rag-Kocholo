        "text": "A major donor to President Joe Biden's reelection campaign has criticized his handling of the weapons shipments to Israel, calling it a \"Bad, bad, bad, decision, on all levels\" in a text published online on Thursday.\n\nHaim Saban is an Israeli-American billionaire and long-time supporter of Israel and Jewish political causes and has been a consistent donor to the Democratic party since the 1990s.\n\nSaban criticized Biden's threat to halt arms shipments to Israel. He asked Biden whether his actions were consistent with the belief that Hamas should be defeated and whether this sent the best message to other US allies in the region.\n\n\"This sends a terrible message to our allies in the region, and beyond that, [that] we can flip from doing the right t[h]ing to bending to political pressure.\"\n\nHe then reminded Biden that \"There are more Jewish voters who care about Israel than Muslim voters that care about Hamas.\"\n\nBiden threatened to halt arms shipments to Israel due to Israel's push to invade Rafah, telling CNN, \"If they [Israel] go into Rafah… I’m not supplying the weapons that have historically been used to.\"\n\nOne shipment has already been stopped due to the US administration's concern over the invasion of Rafah, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told a Senate committee.\n\nWho is Haim Saban?\n\nSaban was born in Egypt and made aliyah with his family in 1956. He fought in both the Six-Day War and the Yom Kippur War.\n\nFrom here, Saban began playing in a band, finding mild success. His rise in the business world came when he and his production company created several iconic 80s children's TV show theme songs, including He-Man, She-Ra, and Inspector Gadget.\n\nStay updated with the latest news!\n\nSubscribe to The Jerusalem Post Newsletter\n\nHis company, Saban Entertainment, grew and would go on to produce more iconic TV shows such as Ninja Turtles and Power Rangers, the company would later merge and form fox Kids Worldwide.\n\nSaban has been a major supporter of pro-Israel causes in the US for decades, having donated to major Democratic campaigns like the 2000 Presidential Election when he was the largest donor to the Democratic National Committee in the 2001-2002 cycle."
