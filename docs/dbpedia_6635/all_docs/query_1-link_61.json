The partnership marks the return of the global franchise to its original developer, Haim Saban, who developed and produced the original “Mighty Morphin Power Rangers” series in 1993. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.\n\n“We are truly excited to be partners with Haim Saban and his team,” said Cyma Zarghami, President, Nickelodeon/MTVN Kids and Family Group. “As one of the original leaders in kids’ television he helped to create powerful brand equity for Power Rangers and with partnerships like this Nickelodeon will be able to build a broader audience, superserve multiple demos, especially boys, and expand our programming offerings.”\n\n“We are delighted to be partnering with Nickelodeon to bring the ever-popular Power Rangers to a whole new generation of viewers,” said Haim Saban, the original developer of Power Rangers. “With Nickelodeon’s reach we are at the beginning of a new era for one of the world’s leading children’s entertainment properties.”\n\n“The Saban Brands team is looking forward to collaborating with the experts at Nick to re-launch and propel the new Power Rangers like never before,” said Elie Dekel, President of Saban Brands.\n\nThe deal brings the forthcoming 18th season (20 new episodes) of Power Rangers to Nickelodeon and Nicktoons in 2011, with the catalog of 700 episodes launching on Nicktoons later this year.\n\nProduced by SCG Power Rangers LLC, Power Rangers will commence production in summer 2010 with original Executive Producer Jonathan Tzachor back at the helm and a new cast, look and theme for the show.
