        "text": "Haim Saban, music producer and chairman and CEO of the multi-billion dollar media company Saban Capital Group, discusses the origins of the superhero franchise Power Rangers and the media empire he built following its success.\n\nOn producing Power Rangers: “I just fell in love with it. Don’t ask me why, I have no idea…I created a pilot and schlepped it for eight years. Everybody told me I’m crazy… I said, ‘Yeah, I agree with all that, but I believe it will be a success.’”"
