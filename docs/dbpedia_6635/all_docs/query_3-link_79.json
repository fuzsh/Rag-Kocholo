        "text": "Saban Entertainment (or just \"Saban\"), was an independent television production company formed in 1983. The company was initially founded as \"Saban Records\" by soundtrack pioneers Haim Saban and Shuki Levy, who were behind many classic and enduring theme songs from 1980s animation (the largest contributions being for DIC). Upon corporate expansion a few years later, they changed their name to \"Saban Productions\" and sowed the seeds for what later become \"Saban International\", which would distribute original and imported television programming.\n\nSaban would become best known in the 1990s for taking a well known Japanese superhero series and making it not just something that stood on its own, but a worldwide phenomenon that endures to this day since August 28, 1993: Power Rangers.\n\nNear the end of its run, the company turned its attention to the demand for new Transformers episodes in the aftermath of Beast Machines' conclusion, and it imported and dubbed Robots in Disguise in 2001. Saban was absorbed into The Walt Disney Company in the same year, and Disney's Buena Vista branch obtained all of its programming.\n\nHaim Saban's second company, Saban Brands, ran The CW's Vortexx block, on which repeats of Prime's first season aired in edited form.\n\nNotes\n\nSaban Brands would eventually reacquire the rights to several Saban Entertainment properties from Disney, including the Power Rangers franchise, in 2010. Hasbro in turn would later go on to purchase the rights to all of Saban Brands' IP on May 1, 2018 after a deal was struck where Hasbro was announced as the master licensee to create Power Rangers toys in 2019 after parting ways with Bandai.[1] The deal was finalized on June 12, 2018, making Power Rangers a wholly owned property of Hasbro.[2] However, Robots in Disguise does not appear to have been among the shows Saban re-obtained back in 2010, and as such, it remains the sole English-language Transformers series for which Hasbro does not retain full ownership.\n\nReferences"
