        "text": "The media investor Haim Saban is moving into brand management and licensing. The Saban Capital Group will plow $500 million into Saban Brands, a new company dedicated to acquiring entertainment and consumer brands and exploiting them through retail, television and film channels.\n\n“As media and consumer options become increasingly fragmented and proliferated, our underlying thesis is that properties that resonate with consumers today will only become more meaningful over time,” said Mr. Saban, who made most of his fortune in children’s entertainment and now owns a big stake in Univision."
