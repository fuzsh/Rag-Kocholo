In his 20s, he was a musician and later became a music producer.\n\nWhen he moved to the United States in 1988, he founded Saban Entertainment and began producing children's shows.\n\nPower Rangers[]\n\nDuring a business trip to Japan, he was fascinated by the idea of Super Sentai. He pitched a pilot based on Choudenshi Bioman to several television companies, but they all rejected it. In 1992, Fox Kids liked the idea, and helped Saban begin the franchise starting with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n\nIn 2001, he sold the franchise to Disney for $5.3 billion, which they produced Power Rangers Wild Force. After the end of Power Rangers RPM, Saban bought back the rights to the franchise and helmed Power Rangers Samurai."
