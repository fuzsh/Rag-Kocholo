The two sides are still haggling over the price, but it is broadly in the vicinity of about $100 million, according to the sources. EM.TV paid $680 million for Henson in February 2000. Jim Henson produces movies, such as \"Muppets in Space,\" and its world-famous creature shop makes well-known puppets such as Miss Piggy and the Cookie Monster, and creates special effects. It won an Oscar for the special effects in the film \"Babe.\" Saban, impresario of the popular and successful children's characters \"Mighty Morphin Power Rangers,\" landed a $1.4 billion windfall last year when he and his partners sold cable station Fox Family Worldwide--which had been also 49.5%-owned by Rupert Murdoch News Corp. (nyse: NWS - news - people )--to Disney (nyse: DIS - news - people ). Saban is also bidding for insolvent German media group KirchMedia, Leo Kirch's eponymous--and insolvent--German media empire.\"\n\n[Hmmmm I guess henceforth they'll be called \"Haim Saban's Muppets\"...\n\nOriginally posted by Sogturtle\n\nHaim Saban in talks to buy Muppets.\n\nHmmmm I guess henceforth they'll be called \"Haim Saban's Muppets\"...\n\nNah. The Henson Family, who still owns a minority share of the company, would raise hellfire and brimstone if that happens. They're not called EM.TV's Muppets, so what makes you think that Mr. Saban would do something so vulgar?\n\nLike him or not, Saban's a good business man. He started out as a musician, created an empire out of acquiring Japanese franchises for American audiences, and made a killing by selling that company for billions. Shrewd, but brilliant. Now he's basically starting over by acquiring one of the best brand names in family entertainment, the Jim Henson Company. If anything, he'll reignite the popularity of the Muppets for a whole new audience without sullying the name and prestige the brand deserves. I certainly hope Saban's ego is not out of control to put his name all over the Muppet franchise."
