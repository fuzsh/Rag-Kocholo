        "text": "Saban Entertainment, Inc. (along with Saban International, which operated outside the United States; current legal name is BVS Entertainment, Inc.) was a worldwide-served independent American-Israeli television production company formed in 1980 by music and television producers Haim Saban and Shuki Levy as \"Saban Productions\".\n\nThe company imported, dubbed, and adapted several Japanese series such as Maple Town, Noozles, Funky Fables, Samurai Pizza Cats, and the first three Digimon series to North America and international markets for syndication, including both animation and live action shows. Saban also adapted various tokusatsu shows from Toei Company, including Power Rangers (based on the Super Sentai series), Big Bad Beetleborgs (based on Juukou B-Fighter), VR Troopers (featuring elements of Metal Hero series like Space Sheriff Shaider, Jikuu Senshi Spielban and Choujinki Metalder), and Masked Rider (an original interpretation using scenes from the Japanese Kamen Rider Black RX).\n\nSaban was involved in the co-production of French/American animated shows created by Jean Chalopin for DIC Entertainment. Some of these early 1980s co-productions were Camp Candy, Ulysses 31, Jayce and the Wheeled Warriors, and The Mysterious Cities of Gold (the third of which was a Japanese co-production).\n\nSaban has also distributed and provided music for TV programs produced by other companies, such as The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!, Inspector Gadget and the first 2 dub seasons of Dragon Ball Z.\n\nSaban International Paris\n\nMain article: SIP Animation\n\nSaban International Paris, later SIP Animation, was a television production company based in France that operated from 1977 to 2009.\n\nSaban International Paris was founded in France by Haim Saban and Jacqueline Tordjman in 1977 as a record company. In 1989, Saban International Paris moved into the animation field. The studio would go on to produce many animated series for Fox Kids Europe in the 1990s and 2000s. Haim Saban departed the company in 2001 with the purchase of Fox Family Worldwide, which was followed by The Walt Disney Company taking a stake in the company and a name change to SIP Animation on October 1, 2002. SIP continued to co-produce animated series with Jetix Europe (previously Fox Kids Europe) during the 2000s. SIP Animation was closed in 2009.\n\nList of television series and films\n\nAnimated TV series\n\nSaban Entertainment\n\nKidd Video (1984–1985) (co-production with DIC Enterprises)\n\nLazer Tag Academy (1986–1987)\n\nMy Favorite Fairy Tales (1986) (co-production with Toei Animation)\n\nALF: The Animated Series (1987–1989) (co-production with DIC Enterprises for Alien Productions)\n\nThe New Archies (1987) (co-production with DIC Enterprises)\n\nKissyfur (1988) (season 2 only; co-production with DIC Enterprises for NBC Productions)\n\nALF Tales (1988–1989) (co-production with DIC Enterprises for Alien Productions)\n\nThe Karate Kid (1989) (co-production with DIC Enterprises for Columbia Pictures Television)\n\nCamp Candy (1989–1992) (seasons 1 & 2 co-produced with DIC Enterprises)\n\nKid 'n Play (1990–1991)\n\nVideo Power (1990–1992)\n\nLittle Shop (1991)\n\nX-Men (1992–1997) (co-production with Graz Entertainment, Marvel Entertainment Group and in Association with Genesis Entertainment)\n\nJin Jin and the Panda Patrol (1994)\n\nBattleTech: The Animated Series (1994) (co-production with Worldwide Sports and Entertainment)\n\nCreepy Crawlers (1994–1996) (co-production with Abrams/Gentile Entertainment)\n\nTenko and the Guardians of the Magic (1995–1996)\n\nLittle Mouse on the Prairie (1996)\n\nBureau of Alien Detectors (1996–1997)\n\nThe Mouse and the Monster (1996–1997)\n\nSilver Surfer (1998) (co-production with Marvel Studios)\n\nBad Dog (1998–1999) (co-production with CinéGroupe)\n\nMonster Farm (1998–1999)\n\nThe Secret Files of the Spy Dogs (1998–1999)\n\nMad Jack the Pirate (1998–1999)\n\nThe Avengers: United They Stand (1999–2000) (co-production with Marvel Studios)\n\nThe Kids from Room 402 (1999–2000) (co-production with CinéGroupe)\n\nXyber 9: New Dawn (1999–2000)\n\nNASCAR Racers (1999–2001)\n\nSpider-Man Unlimited (1999–2001) (co-production with Marvel Studios)\n\nAction Man (2000–2002)\n\nPigs Next Door (2000)\n\nWhat's with Andy? season 1 (2001–2002) (co-production with CinéGroupe)\n\nTiteuf season 1 (2001–2002)\n\nBarbapapa (co-production with RTL Television)\n\nSaban International Paris\n\nFor shows produced after SIP became independent in 2002, see SIP Animation.\n\nSome of the shows featured the \"Saban's\" corporate bug in their title.

However, from the late 1990s on, almost all Saban Entertainment-owned entities were only released as Australian and New Zealand Region 4 VHSes. And also, according to current North American rights holders, Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment had (and still has) no plans to release these titles to DVD and Blu-ray, and as such, some of them instead aired on their sibling television channel, Disney XD and originally was on Toon Disney and ABC Family before the retirement of the Jetix branding in the United States. In most European countries, Fox Kids Europe (later Jetix Europe) had a sister channel called Fox Kids Play (later Jetix Play) which aired various Saban Entertainment programs and shows owned by Fox Kids Europe/Jetix Europe. Some shows were also released on DVD and VHS by various independent distributors, such as Maximum Entertainment in the United Kingdom.\n\nDigimon\n\nIn Australia, Digimon: Digital Monsters seasons one and two was re-released by Madman Entertainment on August 17, 2011.\n\nIn addition, the first five series was released on DVD in North America through New Video.\n\nPower Rangers\n\nIn Germany they have released complete season box sets to every Power Rangers series, with the English Versions included up until season 6 due to problems with Disney. The series is available in the German Amazon.\n\nThe first 17 seasons of Power Rangers have been licensed for DVD releases by Shout! Factory, which has released the first 17 seasons to DVD in Region 1.\n\nSaban and Lions Gate Entertainment produced a live-action reboot movie of Mighty Morphin Power Rangers.\n\nOthers\n\nOn March 13, 2012, Shout! Factory announced a home video distribution deal with Saban, which includes VR Troopers, the two seasons of Beetleborgs and Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation.\n\nSaban's library\n\nThe Fox Kids/Saban Entertainment library today is mostly owned by The Walt Disney Company, with a few exceptions:\n\nThe Power Rangers franchise and other PR-related shows (VR Troopers, Masked Rider, Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation, Big Bad Beetleborgs and Mystic Knights of Tir Na Nog), which were purchased back by Haim Saban from Disney for $43 million on May 12, 2010. The Digimon franchise in the United States was also purchased back by Saban in September 2012. All of the Power Rangers franchise and the PR-related shows are now owned by Hasbro through Allspark/eOne, which acquired the assets of Saban Brands in 2018, while Digimon has reverted to Toei Animation.\n\nPigs Next Door was a co-production with Fox Kids, EM.TV and Wavery B.V. Studio 100, which acquired EM.TV's children's library in 2008, owns the US digital rights and some international rights to the series (Europe, China, Australia, New Zealand and Quebec).\n\nSplash Entertainment owns the distribution rights to Bobby's World, under license from series creator Howie Mandel.\n\nThe international distribution rights to the pre-1990 DIC Entertainment library reverted to DIC in the 2000s. This library is now owned by WildBrain through Cookie Jar Entertainment.\n\nGoosebumps is owned by Scholastic Entertainment, with distribution handled by 9 Story Media Group.\n\nMany of Saban's anime licenses, such as Macron 1, Noozles, Flint the Time Detective, The Littl' Bits and Saban's The Adventures of Pinocchio expired in the 2000s.\n\nCinéGroupe owns the series that it co-produced with Saban and SIP, including What's with Andy? and The Kids from Room 402. These series are distributed through partner company HG Distribution.\n\nSee also"
