        "meta_description": "R.Carlos Coelho, Campo de Ourique, Lisbon, Portugal\n\t\n\tBIOGRAPHY [FERNANDO PESSOA] (1888 - 1935)\n\t\n\tFernando António Nogueira Pessoa (Portuguese: [fɨɾˈnɐ̃du pɨˈsoɐ]; 13 June 1888 – 30 November 1935) was a Portuguese poet, writer, literary critic, translator, publisher and philosopher, described as one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest poets in the Portuguese language. He also wrote in and translated from English and French.\n\t\n\tPessoa was a prolific writer, and not only under his own name, for he created approximately seventy-five others. He did not call them all pseudonyms because he felt that some did not capture their true independent intellectual life and instead called them heteronyms. These imaginary figures sometimes held unpopular or extreme views.\n\t\n\tPessoa's birthplace: a large flat at São Carlos Square, just in front of Lisbon's opera.\n\tPessoa was born in Lisbon on 13 June 1888. \n\t\n\tWhen Pessoa was five, his father, Joaquim de Seabra Pessôa, died of tuberculosis and the following year, on 2 January, his younger brother Jorge, aged one, also died.\n\t\n\tAfter the second marriage of his mother, Maria Magdalena Pinheiro Nogueira, proxy wedding to João Miguel dos Santos Rosa, Fernando sailed with his mother for South Africa at the beginning of 1896, to join his stepfather, a military officer appointed Portuguese consul in Durban, capital of the former British Colony of Natal. Later on, in 1918, Pessoa wrote a letter in which refers:\n\t\n\t\n\tLAST YEAR IN LISBON BEFORE MOVING TO DURBAN, 1894, AGED 6.\n\t\n\tThere is only one event in the past which has both the definiteness and the importance required for rectification by direction; this is my father's death, which took place on 13 July 1893. My mother's second marriage (which took place on 30 December 1895) is another date which I can give with preciseness and it is important for me, not in itself, but in one of its results – the circumstance that, my stepfather becoming Portuguese Consul in Durban (Natal), I was educated there, this English education being a factor of supreme importance in my life, and, whatever my fate be, indubitably shaping it.\n\t\n\tThe dates of the voyages related to the above event are (as nearly as possible):\n\t\n\t1st. voyage to Africa – left Lisbon beginning January 1896.\n\t\n\tReturn – left Durban in the afternoon of 1st. August 1901.\n\t\n\t2nd. voyage to Africa – left Lisbon about 20th. September 1902.\n\t\n\tReturn – left Durban about 20th. August 1905.\n\t\n\tThe young Pessoa received his early education at St. Joseph Convent School, a Roman Catholic grammar school run by Irish and French nuns. He moved to the Durban High School in April 1899, becoming fluent in English and developing an appreciation for English literature. \n\t\n\tDuring the Matriculation Examination, held at the time by the University of the Cape of Good Hope (forerunner of the University of Cape Town), in November 1903, he was awarded the recently created Queen Victoria Memorial Prize for best paper in English. While preparing to enter university, he also attended the Durban Commercial High School during one year, taking night classes.\n\t\n\t\n\tPESSOA IN DURBAN, 1898, AGED 10.\n\t\n\tMeanwhile, Pessoa started writing short stories in English, some under the name of David Merrick, many of which he left unfinished.\n\t\n\t At the age of sixteen, The Natal Mercury (edition of 6 July 1904) published his poem &quot;Hillier did first usurp the realms of rhyme...&quot;, under the name of C. R. Anon (anonymous), along with a brief introductory text: &quot;I read with great amusement...&quot;. In December, The Durban High School Magazine published his essay &quot;Macaulay&quot;.\n\t\n\t From February to June 1905, in the section &quot;The Man in the Moon&quot;, The Natal Mercury also published at least four sonnets by Fernando Pessoa: &quot;Joseph Chamberlain&quot;, &quot;To England I&quot;, &quot;To England II&quot; and &quot;Liberty&quot;.\n\t\n\tHis poems often carried humorous versions of Anon as the author's name. Pessoa started using pen names quite young. The first one, still in his childhood, was Chevalier de Pas, supposedly a French noble. \n\t\n\tIn addition to Charles Robert Anon and David Merrick, the young writer also signed up, among other pen names, as Horace James Faber, Alexander Search, and other mean names.\n\t\n\tIn the preface to The Book of Disquiet, Pessoa wrote about himself:\n\t\n\tNothing had ever obliged him to do anything. He had spent his childhood alone. He never joined any group. He never pursued a course of study. He never belonged to a crowd. The circumstances of his life were marked by that strange but rather common phenomenon – perhaps, in fact, it’s true for all lives – of being tailored to the image and likeness of his instincts, which tended towards inertia and withdrawal.\n\t\n\t\n\tPESSOA IN 1901, AGED 13.\n\t\n\tThe young Pessoa was described by a schoolfellow as follows:\n\t\n\tI cannot tell you exactly how long I knew him, but the period during which I received most of my impressions of him was the whole of the year 1904 when we were at school together. How old he was at this time I don’t know, but judge him to have 15 or 16. [...]\n\t\n\tHe was pale and thin and appeared physically to be very imperfectly developed. He had a narrow and contracted chest and was inclined to stoop. He had a peculiar walk and some defect in his eyesight gave to his eyes also a peculiar appearance, the lids seemed to drop over the eyes. [...]\n\t\n\tHe was regarded as a brilliant clever boy as, in spite of the fact that he had not spoken English in his early years, he had learned it so rapidly and so well that he had a splendid style in that language. Although younger than his schoolfellows of the same class he appeared to have no difficulty in keeping up with and surpassing them in work. For one of his age, he thought much and deeply and in a letter to me once complained of &quot;spiritual and material encumbrances of most especial adverseness&quot;. [...]\n\t\n\tHe took no part in athletic sports of any kind and I think his spare time was spent on reading. We generally considered that he worked far too much and that he would ruin his health by so doing.\n\t\n\tTen years after his arrival, he sailed for Lisbon via the Suez Canal on board the &quot;Herzog&quot;, leaving Durban for good at the age of seventeen. This journey inspired the poems &quot;Opiário&quot; (dedicated to his friend, the poet and writer Mário de Sá-Carneiro) published in March 1915, in Orpheu nr.1 and &quot;Ode Marítima&quot; (dedicated to the futurist painter Santa-Rita) published in June 1915, in Orpheu nr.2 by his heteronym Álvaro de Campos.\n\t\n\tLISBON REVISITED\n\t\n\t&quot;Ibis Enterprise&quot;, the first firm established by Pessoa, in 1909.\n\tWhile his family remained in South Africa, Pessoa returned to Lisbon in 1905 to study diplomacy. \n\t\n\tAfter a period of illness, and two years of poor results, a student strike against the dictatorship of Prime Minister João Franco put an end to his formal studies. \n\t\n\tPessoa became an autodidact, a devoted reader who spent a lot of time at the library. In August 1907, he started working as a practitioner at R.G. Dun &amp; Company, an American mercantile information agency (currently D&amp;B, Dun &amp; Bradstreet). \n\t\n\tHis grandmother died in September and left him a small inheritance, which he spent on setting up his own publishing house, the &quot;Empreza Ibis&quot;. \n\t\n\tThe venture was not successful and closed down in 1910, but the name ibis, the sacred bird of Ancient Egypt and inventor of the alphabet in Greek mythology, would remain an important symbolic reference for him.\n\t\n\tPessoa returned to his uncompleted formal studies, complementing his British education with the self-directed study of Portuguese culture. The pre-revolutionary atmosphere surrounding the assassination of King Charles I and Crown Prince Luís Filipe in 1908, and the patriotic outburst resulting from the successful republican revolution in 1910, influenced the development of the budding writer; as did his step-uncle, Henrique dos Santos Rosa, a poet and retired soldier, who introduced the young Pessoa to Portuguese poetry, notably the romantics and symbolists of the 19th century.\n\t\n\t In 1912, Fernando Pessoa entered the literary world with a critical essay, published in the cultural journal A Águia, which triggered one of the most important literary debates in the Portuguese intellectual world of the 20th century: the polemic regarding a super-Camões. In 1915 a group of artists and poets, including Fernando Pessoa, Mário de Sá-Carneiro and Almada Negreiros, created the literary magazine Orpheu, which introduced modernist literature to Portugal. \n\t\n\tOnly two issues were published (Jan–Feb–Mar and Apr–May–Jun 1915), the third failed to appear due to funding difficulties. Lost for many years, this issue was finally recovered and published in 1984.\n\t\n\tAmong other writers and poets, Orpheu published Pessoa, orthonym, and the modernist heteronym, Álvaro de Campos.\n\t\n\t\n\tPessoa's last home, from 1920 till his death, in 1935, CURRENTLY THE FERNANDO PESSOA MUSEUM\n\t\n\tAlong with the artist Ruy Vaz, Pessoa also founded the art journal Athena (1924–25), in which he published verses under the heteronyms Alberto Caeiro and Ricardo Reis. \n\t\n\tAlong with his profession, as free-lance commercial translator, Fernando Pessoa undertook intense activity as a writer, literary critic and political analyst, contributing to the journals and newspapers A Águia (1912–13), A República (1913), Theatro (1913), A Renascença (1914), O Raio (1914), A Galera (1915), Orpheu (1915), O Jornal (1915), Eh Real! (1915), Exílio (1916), Centauro (1916), A Ideia Nacional (1916), Terra Nossa (1916), O Heraldo (1917), Portugal Futurista (1917), Acção (1919–20), Ressurreição (1920), Contemporânea (1922–26), Athena (1924–25), Diário de Lisboa (1924–35), Revista de Comércio e Contabilidade (1926), Sol (1926), O Imparcial (1927), Presença (1927–34), Revista Solução Editora (1929–1931), Notícias Ilustrado (1928–30), Girassol (1930), Revolução (1932), Descobrimento (1932), Fama (1932–33), Fradique (1934) and Sudoeste (1935).\n\t\n\tPESSOA THE FLÂNEUR\n\t\n\tPessoa, a flâneur in the streets of Lisbon.\n\t\n\tAfter his return to Portugal, when he was seventeen, Pessoa barely left his beloved city of Lisbon, which inspired the poems &quot;Lisbon Revisited&quot; (1923 and 1926), under the heteronym Álvaro de Campos.\n\t\n\t From 1905 to 1920, when his family returned from Pretoria after the death of his stepfather, he lived in fifteen different locations in the city, moving from one rented room to another depending on his fluctuating finances and personal troubles.\n\t\n\tPessoa adopted the detached perspective of the flâneur Bernardo Soares, another of his heteronyms.\n\t\n\t This character was supposedly an accountant, working for Vasques, the boss of an office located in Douradores Street. Soares also supposedly lived in the same downtown street, a world that Pessoa knew quite well due to his long career as freelance correspondence translator. Indeed, from 1907 until his death in 1935, Pessoa worked in twenty-one firms located in Lisbon's downtown, sometimes in two or three of them simultaneously.\n\t\n\t In The Book of Disquiet, Bernardo Soares describes some of those typical places and its &quot;atmosphere&quot;. In his daydream soliloquy, he also wrote about Lisbon in the first half of the 20th century. Soares describes crowds in the streets, buildings, shops, traffic, river Tagus, the weather, and even its author, Fernando Pessoa:\n\t\n\tCoffee house &quot;A Brasileira&quot;, established in 1905, the year Pessoa returned to Lisbon.\n\tFairly tall and thin, he must have been about thirty years old. He hunched over terribly when sitting down but less so standing up, and he dressed with a carelessness that wasn’t entirely careless. In his pale, uninteresting face there was a look of suffering that didn’t add any interest, and it was difficult to say just what kind of suffering this look suggested. It seemed to suggest various kinds: hardships, anxieties, and the suffering born of the indifference that comes from having already suffered a lot.\n\t\n\tA statue of Pessoa sitting at a table (below) can be seen outside A Brasileira, one of the preferred places of young writers and artists of Orpheu's group during the 1910s. \n\t\n\tThis coffeehouse, in the aristocratic district of Chiado, is quite close to Pessoa's birthplace: 4, São Carlos Square (in front of the Opera House, where stands another statue of the writer), one of the most elegant neighbourhoods of Lisbon. Later on, Pessoa was a frequent customer at Martinho da Arcada, a centennial coffeehouse in Comercio Square, surrounded by ministries, almost an &quot;office&quot; for his private business and literary concerns, where he used to meet friends in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\t\n\tIn 1925, Pessoa wrote in English a GUIDEBOOK TO LISBON BUT it remained unpublished until 1992.\n\t\n\tLITERATURE AND OCCULTISM\n\t\n\tPessoa translated a number of Portuguese books into English and into Portuguese The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, and the short stories &quot;The Theory and the Hound&quot;, &quot;The Roads We Take&quot; and &quot;Georgia's Ruling&quot; by O. Henry.\n\t\n\t Pessoa also translated into Portuguese the poetry &quot;Godiva&quot; by Alfred Tennyson, &quot;Lucy&quot; by William Wordsworth, &quot;Barbara Frietchie&quot; by John Greenleaf Whittier, &quot;Catarina to Camoens&quot; by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and &quot;The Raven&quot;, &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; and &quot;Ulalume&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe who, along with Walt Whitman, strongly influenced him.\n\t\n\tAS A TRANSLATOR, PESSOA HAD HIS OWN METHOD:\n\t\n\t\n\tPessoa's alleged mediumship: \n\tAutomatic writing sample.\n\tA poem is an intellectualized impression, an idea made emotion, communicated by others by means of rhythm. \n\t\n\tThis rhythm is double in one, like the concave and convex aspects of the same arc: it is made up of a verbal or musical rhythm and of a visual or image rhythm which concurs inwardly with it. The translation of a poem should, therefore, confirm absolutely:\n\t\n\t (1) to the idea or emotion which constitutes the poem;\n\t\n\t (2) to the verbal rhythm in which that idea or emotion is expressed; it should conform relatively to the inner or visual rhythm, keeping to the images themselves when it can, but keeping always to the type of image. It was on this criterion that I based my translation into Portuguese of Poe’s &quot;Annabel Lee&quot; and &quot;Ulalume&quot;, which I translated, not because of their great intrinsic worth, but because they were a standing challenge to translators.\n\t\n\tIn addition, Pessoa translated into Portuguese some books by the leading theosophists Helena Blavatsky, Charles Webster Leadbeater, Annie Besant, and Mabel Collins.\n\t\n\tIn 1912–14, while living with his aunt &quot;Anica&quot; and cousins, Pessoa took part in &quot;semi-spiritualist sessions&quot; that were carried out at home, but he was considered a &quot;delaying element&quot; by the other members of the sessions. \n\t\n\tPessoa's interest in spiritualism was truly awakened in the second half of 1915 while translating theosophist books.\n\t\n\t This was further deepened at the end of March 1916, when he suddenly started having experiences where he believed he became a medium, having experimented with automatic writing.[citation needed].\n\t\n\t On 24 June, Pessoa wrote an impressive letter to his aunt and godmother, then living in Switzerland with her daughter and son in law, in which he describes this &quot;mystery case&quot; that surprised him.[citation needed]\n\t\n\tBesides automatic writing, Pessoa stated also that he had &quot;astral&quot; or &quot;ethereal visions&quot; and was able to see &quot;magnetic auras&quot; similar to radiographic images. He felt &quot;more curiosity than fear&quot;, but was respectful towards this phenomenon and asked secrecy, because &quot;there is no advantage, but many disadvantages&quot; in speaking about this. Mediumship exerted a strong influence in Pessoa's writings, who felt &quot;sometimes suddenly being owned by something else&quot; or having a &quot;very curious sensation&quot; in the right arm, which was &quot;lifted into the air&quot; without his will. Looking in the mirror, Pessoa saw several times what appeared to be the heteronyms: his &quot;face fading out&quot; and being replaced by the one of &quot;a bearded man&quot;, or another one, four men in total.\n\t\n\tPessoa also developed a strong interest in astrology, becoming a competent astrologist. He elaborated more than 1,500 astrological charts, including well-known people like William Shakespeare, Lord Byron, Oscar Wilde, Chopin, Robespierre, Napoleon I, Benito Mussolini, Wilhelm II, Leopold II of Belgium, Victor Emmanuel III, Alfonso XIII, or the Kings Sebastian and Charles of Portugal, and Salazar.\n\t\n\tIn 1915, he created the heteronym Raphael Baldaya, an astrologist who planned to write &quot;System of Astrology&quot; and &quot;Introduction to the Study of Occultism&quot;. Pessoa established the pricing of his astrological services from 500 to 5,000 réis and made horoscopes of customers, friends and also himself and, astonishingly, of the heteronyms and also of journals as Orpheu.\n\t\n\tBorn on 13 June, Pessoa was native of Gemini and had Scorpio as the rising sign. \n\t\n\tThe characters of the main heteronyms were inspired by the four astral elements: air, fire, water and earth. It means that Pessoa and his heteronyms altogether comprised the full principles of ancient knowledge. Those heteronyms were designed according to their horoscopes, all including Mercury, the planet of literature.\n\t\n\t Astrology was part of his everyday life and Pessoa kept that interest until his death, which he was able to predict with some accuracy.[32]\n\t\n\t\n\tPESSOA'S LAST WRITING: 29-11-1935 \n\t\n\t&quot;I KNOW NOT WHAT TOMORROW WILL BRING&quot;. \n\t\n\tHe died the next day, 30 November 1935.\n\t\n\tAs a mysticist, Pessoa was an enthusiast of esotericism, occultism, hermeticism, numerology and alchemy. Along with spiritualism and astrology, he also paid attention to neopaganism, theosophy, Rosicrucianism and freemasonry, which strongly influenced his literary work.\n\t\n\t He has declared himself a Pagan, in the sense of an &quot;intellectual mystic of the sad race of the Neoplatonists from Alexandria&quot; and a believer in &quot;the Gods, their agency and their real and materially superior existence&quot;.\n\t\n\t His interest in occultism led Pessoa to correspond with Aleister Crowley and later helped him to elaborate a fake suicide when Crowley visited Portugal in 1930.\n\t\n\t Pessoa translated Crowley's poem &quot;Hymn To Pan&quot; into Portuguese, and the catalogue of Pessoa's library shows that he possessed Crowley's books Magick in Theory and Practice and Confessions. \n\t\n\tPessoa also wrote on Crowley's doctrine of Thelema in several fragments, including Moral.\n\t\n\tPESSOA'S DECLARED ABOUT SECRET SOCIETIES:\n\t\n\tI am also very interested in knowing whether a second edition is short to be expected of Arthur Edward Waite’s The Secret Tradition in Freemasonry. I see that in a note on page 14 of his Emblematic Freemasonry, published by you in 1925, he says, in respect of the earlier work: &quot;A new and revised edition is in the forefront of my literary schemes.&quot; For all I know, you may already have issued such an edition; if so, I have missed the reference in The Times Literary Supplement.\n\t\n\t Since I am writing on these subjects, I should like to put a question which perhaps you can reply to; but please do not do so if the reply involves any inconvenience.\n\t\n\t I believe The Occult Review was, or is, issued by yourselves; I have not seen any number for a long time. My question is in what issue of that publication – it was certainly a long while ago – an article was printed relating to the Roman Catholic Church as a Secret Society, or, alternatively, to a Secret Society within the Roman Catholic Church.\n\t\n\tLiterary critic Martin Lüdke described Pessoa's philosophy as a kind of pandeism, especially those writings under the heteronym Alberto Caeiro\n\t\n\tWRITING A LIFETIME\n\t\n\tIn his early years, Pessoa was influenced by major English classic poets such as Shakespeare, Milton and Pope, or romantics like Shelley, Byron, Keats, Wordsworth, Coleridge and Tennyson.\n\t\n\t After his return to Lisbon in 1905, Pessoa was influenced by French symbolists and decadentists Charles Baudelaire, Maurice Rollinat, Stéphane Mallarmé; mainly by Portuguese poets as Antero de Quental, Gomes Leal, Cesário Verde, António Nobre, Camilo Pessanha or Teixeira de Pascoaes. \n\t\n\tLater on, he was also influenced by modernists as W. B. Yeats, James Joyce, Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, among many other writers.\n\t\n\tDuring World War I, Pessoa wrote to a number of British publishers, namely Constable &amp; Co. Ltd. (currently Constable &amp; Robinson), in order to print his collection of English verse The Mad Fiddler (unpublished during his lifetime), but it was refused. \n\t\n\tHowever, in 1920, the prestigious literary journal Athenaeum included one of those poems.\n\t\n\tSince the British publication failed, in 1918 Pessoa published in Lisbon two slim volumes of English verse: Antinous and 35 Sonnets, received by the British literary press without enthusiasm.\n\t\n\t Along with some friends, he founded another publishing house – OLISIPO – which published in 1921 a further two English poetry volumes: English Poems I–II and English Poems III by Fernando Pessoa. \n\t\n\tIn his publishing house, Pessoa issued also some books by his friends: A INVENÇÃO DO DIA CLARO (The invention of the clear day) by José de Almada Negreiros, CANÇÕES (Songs) by António Botto, and Sodoma Divinizada (Divinized Sodom) by Raul Leal (Henoch).\n\t\n\t Olisipo closed down in 1923, following the scandal known as &quot;Literatura de Sodoma&quot; (Literature of Sodom), which Pessoa started with his paper &quot;António Botto e o Ideal Estético em Portugal&quot; (António Botto and the aesthetical ideal in Portugal), published in the journal Contemporanea.\n\t\n\tPOLITICALLY, PESSOA DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS &quot;A British-style CONSERVATIVE, that is to say, liberal within conservatism and absolutely anti-reactionary,&quot; and adhered closely to the Spencerian individualism of his upbringing.\n\t\n\t HE DESCRIBED HIS BRAND OF NATIONALISM AS &quot;MYSTIC, COSMOPOLITAN, LIBERAL, AND ANTI-CATHOLIC.&quot;\n\t\n\t HE WAS AN OUTSPOKEN ELITIST AND ALIGNED HIMSELF AGAINST COMMUNISM, SOCIALISM, FASCISM AND CATHOLICISM.\n\t\n\t He initially rallied to the First Portuguese Republic but the ensuing instability caused him to reluctantly support the military coups of 1917 and 1926 as a means of restoring order and preparing the transition to a new constitutional normality.\n\t\n\t He wrote a pamphlet in 1928 supportive of the military dictatorship but after the establishment of the New State, in 1933, Pessoa became disenchanted with the regime and wrote critically of Salazar and fascism in general, maintaining a hostile stance towards its corporatist program, illiberalism, and censorship.\n\t\n\t At the beginning of 1935, Pessoa was banned by the Salazar regime, after he wrote in defence of Freemasonry.\n\t\n\tTHE REGIME ALSO SUPPRESSED TWO ARTICLES PESSOA WROTE IN WHICH HE CONDEMNED MUSSOLINI'S INVASION OF ABYSSINIA AND FASCISM AS A THREAT TO HUMAN LIBERTY EVERYWHERE.\n\t\n\tOn 29 November 1935, Pessoa was taken to the Hospital de São Luís, suffering from abdominal pain and a high fever; there he wrote, in English, his last words: &quot;I know not what tomorrow will bring.&quot;\n\t\n\t He died the next day, 30 November 1935, around 8 pm, aged 47. His cause of death is commonly given as cirrhosis of the liver, due to alcoholism, though this is disputed: others attribute his death to pancreatitis (again from alcoholism), or other ailments.\n\t\n\tIn his lifetime, he published four books in English and one alone in Portuguese: Mensagem (Message). However, he left a lifetime of unpublished, unfinished or just sketchy work in a domed, wooden trunk manuscript and typed pages which have been housed in the Portuguese National Library since 1988). The heavy burden of editing this huge work is still in progress. In 1985 (fifty years after his death), Pessoa's remains were moved to the Hieronymites Monastery, in Lisbon, where Vasco da Gama, Luís de Camões, and Alexandre Herculano are also buried.\n\t\n\tPessoa's portrait was on the 100-escudo banknote.\n\t\n\tTHE TRIUMPHANT DAY\n\t\n\t[…] on 8 March 1914 – I found myself standing before a tall chest of drawers, took up a piece of paper, began to write, remaining upright all the while since I always stand when I can. I wrote thirty-some poems in a row, all in a kind of ecstasy, the nature of which I shall never fathom. It was the triumphant day of my life, and I shall never have another like it. I began with a title, The Keeper of Sheep. And what followed was the appearance of someone within me to whom I promptly assigned the name of Alberto Caeiro. Please excuse the absurdity of what I am about to say, but there had appeared within me, then and there, my own master. It was my immediate sensation. So much so that, with those thirty-odd poems written, I immediately took up another sheet of paper and wrote as well, in a row, the six poems that make up &quot;Oblique Rain&quot; by Fernando Pessoa. Immediately and totally... It was the return from Fernando Pessoa/Alberto Caeiro to Fernando Pessoa alone. Or better still, it was Fernando Pessoa’s reaction to his own inexistence as Alberto Caeiro\n\t\n\tAs the fake heteronym Coelho Pacheco, over a long period Pessoa's &quot;triumphant day&quot; was taken as real, however, it has been proved that this event was one more fiction created by Pessoa.\n\t\n\tPessoa's earliest heteronym, at the age of six, was Chevalier de Pas. Other childhood heteronyms included Dr Pancrácio and David Merrick, followed by Charles Robert Anon, an English young man that became Pessoa's alter ego. In 1905/7, when Pessoa was a student at the University of Lisbon, Alexander Search took the place of Anon. The main reason for this was that, although Search is English, he was born in Lisbon as his author. But Search represents a transition heteronym that Pessoa used while searching to adapt to the Portuguese cultural reality. After the republican revolution, in 1910, and consequent patriotic atmosphere, Pessoa created another alter ego, Álvaro de Campos, supposedly a Portuguese naval engineer, born in Tavira and graduated in Glasgow. Translator Richard Zenith notes that Pessoa eventually established at least seventy-two heteronyms.[64] According to Pessoa himself, there were three main heteronyms: Alberto Caeiro, Álvaro de Campos and Ricardo Reis. \n\t\n\tThe heteronyms possess distinct biographies, temperaments, philosophies, appearances, writing styles and even signatures.\n\t\n\tHow do I write in the name of these three? Caeiro, through sheer and unexpected inspiration, without knowing or even suspecting that I’m going to write in his name. Ricardo Reis, after an abstract meditation, which suddenly takes concrete shape in an ode. Campos, when I feel a sudden impulse to write and don’t know what. (My semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares, who in many ways resembles Álvaro de Campos, always appears when I'm sleepy or drowsy so that my qualities of inhibition and rational thought are suspended; his prose is an endless reverie. He’s a semi-heteronym because his personality, although not my own, doesn’t differ from my own but is a mere mutilation of it. He’s me without my rationalism and emotions. His prose is the same as mine, except for certain formal restraint that reason imposes on my own writing, and his Portuguese is exactly the same – whereas Caeiro writes bad Portuguese, Campos writes it reasonably well but with mistakes such as &quot;me myself&quot; instead of &quot;I myself&quot;, etc.., and Reis writes better than I, but with a purism I find excessive...).\n\t\n\tPESSOA'S HETERONYMS\n\t\n\tWhat this means, and what makes Caeiro such an original poet is the way he apprehends existence. He does not question anything whatsoever; he calmly accepts the world as it is. The recurrent themes to be found in nearly all of Caeiro's poems are wide-eyed childlike wonder at the infinite variety of nature, as noted by a critic. He is free of metaphysical entanglements. Central to his world-view is the idea that in the world around us, all is surface: things are precisely what they seem, there is no hidden meaning anywhere.\n\t\n\tHe manages thus to free himself from the anxieties that batter his peers; for Caeiro, things simply exist and we have no right to credit them with more than that. Caeiro attains happiness by not questioning, and by thus avoiding doubts and uncertainties. He apprehends reality solely through his eyes, through his senses. Octavio Paz called him the innocent poet. Paz made a shrewd remark on the heteronyms: In each are particles of negation or unreality. Reis believes in form, Campos in sensation, Pessoa in symbols. Caeiro doesn't believe in anything. He exists.[68]\n\t\n\tPoetry before Caeiro was essentially interpretative; what poets did was to offer an interpretation of their perceived surroundings; Caeiro does not do this. Instead, he attempts to communicate his senses, and his feelings, without any interpretation whatsoever.\n\t\n\tCaeiro attempts to approach Nature from a qualitatively different mode of apprehension; that of simply perceiving (an approach akin to phenomenological approaches to philosophy). Poets before him would make use of intricate metaphors to describe what was before them; not so Caeiro: his self-appointed task is to bring these objects to the reader's attention, as directly and simply as possible. Caeiro sought the direct experience of the objects before him.\n\t\n\tAs such it is not surprising to find that Caeiro has been called an anti-intellectual, anti-Romantic, anti-subjectivist, anti-metaphysical...an anti-poet, by critics; Caeiro simply—is. He is in this sense very unlike his creator Fernando Pessoa: Pessoa was besieged by metaphysical uncertainties; these were, to a large extent, the cause of his unhappiness; not so Caeiro: his attitude is anti-metaphysical; he avoided uncertainties by adamantly clinging to a certainty: his belief that there is no meaning behind things. Things, for him, simply—are.\n\t\n\tCaeiro represents a primal vision of reality, of things. He is the pagan incarnate. Indeed, Caeiro was not simply a pagan but paganism itself.[69]\n\t\n\tThe critic Jane M. Sheets sees the insurgence of Caeiro—who was Pessoa's first major heteronym—as essential in founding the later poetic personas: By means of this artless yet affirmative anti-poet, Caeiro, a short-lived but vital member of his coterie, Pessoa acquired the base of an experienced and universal poetic vision. After Caeiro's tenets had been established, the avowedly poetic voices of Campos, Reis and Pessoa himself spoke with greater assurance.[70]\n\t\n\tRICARDO REIS\n\t\n\tAthena — Art Journal (5 issues edited by Pessoa and Ruy Vaz in 1924-1925), published poetry by Pessoa, Ricardo Reis, and Alberto Caeiro, as well as essays by Álvaro de Campos.\n\tIn a letter to William Bentley, Pessoa wrote that &quot;a knowledge of the language would be indispensable, for instance, to appraise the 'Odes' of Ricardo Reis, whose Portuguese would draw upon him the blessing of António Vieira, as his style and diction that of Horace (he has been called, admirably I believe, 'a Greek Horace who writes in Portuguese')&quot;.\n\t\n\tReis, both a character and a heteronym of Fernando Pessoa himself,  sums up his philosophy of life in his own words, admonishing, &quot;see life from a distance. Never question it. There's nothing it can tell you.&quot; Like Caeiro, whom he admires, Reis defers from questioning life. He is a modern pagan who urges one to seize the day and accept fate with tranquillity. &quot;Wise is the one who does not seek. The seeker will find in all things the abyss, and doubt in himself.&quot;[citation needed] In this sense, Reis shares essential affinities with Caeiro.\n\t\n\tBelieving in the Greek gods, yet living in a Christian Europe, Reis feels that his spiritual life is limited and true happiness cannot be attained. This, added to his belief in Fate as a driving force for all that exists, as such disregarding freedom, leads to his epicureanism philosophy, which entails the avoidance of pain, defending that man should seek tranquillity and calm above all else, avoiding emotional extremes.\n\t\n\tWhere Caeiro wrote freely and spontaneously, with joviality, of his basic, meaningless connection to the world, Reis writes in an austere, cerebral manner, with premeditated rhythm and structure and particular attention to the correct use of the language when approaching his subjects of, as characterized by Richard Zenith, &quot;the brevity of life, the vanity of wealth and struggle, the joy of simple pleasures, patience in time of trouble, and avoidance of extremes&quot;.\n\t\n\tIn his detached, intellectual approach, he is closer to Fernando Pessoa's constant rationalization, as such representing the orthonym's wish for measure and sobriety and a world free of troubles and respite, in stark contrast to Caeiro's spirit and style. As such, where Caeiro's predominant attitude is that of joviality, his sadness being accepted as natural (&quot;My sadness is comfort for it is natural and right.&quot;), Reis is marked by melancholy, saddened by the impermanence of all things.\n\t\n\tRicardo Reis is the main character of José Saramago's 1986 novel The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis.\n\t\n\tÁLVARO DE CAMPOS\n\t\n\tMain article: Álvaro de Campos\n\t\n\tPortugal Futurista, the art journal that published Campos' &quot;Ultimatum&quot; in 1917.\n\tÁlvaro de Campos manifests, in a way, as a hyperbolic version of Pessoa himself. Of the three heteronyms, he is the one who feels most strongly, his motto being 'to feel everything in every way.' 'The best way to travel,' he wrote, 'is to feel.' As such, his poetry is the most emotionally intense and varied, constantly juggling two fundamental impulses: on the one hand a feverish desire to be and feel everything and everyone, declaring that 'in every corner of my soul stands an altar to a different god' (alluding to Walt Whitman's desire to 'contain multitudes'), on the other, a wish for a state of isolation and a sense of nothingness.\n\t\n\tAs a result, his mood and principles varied between violent, dynamic exultation, as he fervently wishes to experience the entirety of the universe in himself, in all manners possible (a particularly distinctive trait in this state being his futuristic leanings, including the expression of great enthusiasm as to the meaning of city life and its components) and a state of nostalgic melancholy, where life is viewed as, essentially, empty.\n\t\n\tOne of the poet's constant preoccupations, as part of his dichotomous character, is that of identity: he does not know who he is, or rather, fails at achieving an ideal identity. Wanting to be everything, and inevitably failing, he despairs. Unlike Caeiro, who asks nothing of life, he asks too much. In his poetic meditation 'Tobacco Shop' he asks:\n\t\n\tHow should I know what I'll be, I who don't know what I am?\n\tTo be what I think? But I think of being so many things!\n\t\n\tSUMMARIES OF SELECTED WORKS\n\t\n\tMESSAGE\n\t\n\tMensagem, first edition, 1934.\n\t\n\tMensagem, written in Portuguese, is a symbolist epic made up of 44 short poems organized in three parts or Cycles:\n\t\n\tThe first, called &quot;Brasão&quot; (Coat-of-Arms), relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields and charges in the Portuguese coat of arms. The first two poems (&quot;The castles&quot; and &quot;The escutcheons&quot;) draw inspiration from the material and spiritual natures of Portugal. Each of the remaining poems associates to each charge a historical personality. Ultimately they all lead to the Golden Age of Discovery.\n\t\n\tThe second part, called &quot;Mar Português&quot; (Portuguese Sea), references the country's Age of Portuguese Exploration and to its seaborne Empire that ended with the death of King Sebastian at El-Ksar el Kebir (Alcácer-Quibir in Portuguese) in 1578. Pessoa brings the reader to the present as if he had woken up from a dream of the past, to fall in a dream of the future: he sees King Sebastian returning and still bent on accomplishing a Universal Empire.\n\t\n\tThe third Cycle, called &quot;O Encoberto&quot; (&quot;The Hidden One&quot;), refers to Pessoa's vision of a future world of peace and the Fifth Empire (which, according to Pessoa, is spiritual and not material, because if it were material England would already have achieved it). After the Age of Force, (Vis), and Taedium (Otium) will come to Science (understanding) through a reawakening of &quot;The Hidden One&quot;, or &quot;King Sebastian&quot;. The Hidden One represents the fulfilment of the destiny of mankind, designed by God since before Time, and the accomplishment of Portugal.\n\t\n\tKing Sebastian is very important, indeed he appears in all three parts of Mensagem. He represents the capacity of dreaming and believing that it's possible to achieve dreams.\n\t\n\tOne of the most famous quotes from Mensagem is the first line from O Infante (belonging to the Second Part), which is Deus quer, o HOMEM SONHA, A OBRA NASCE (which translates roughly to &quot;GOD WISHES, MAN DREAMS, THE WORK IS BORN&quot;). \n\t\n\tAnother well-known quote from Mensagem is the first line from Ulysses, &quot;O MITO É O NADA QUE É TUDO&quot; (a possible translation is &quot;THE MYTH IS THE NOTHING THAT IS ALL&quot;). This poem refers to Ulysses, king of Ithaca, as Lisbon's founder (recalling an ancient Greek myth).\n\t\n\tLITERARY ESSAYS\n\t\n\tIn 1912, Fernando Pessoa wrote a set of essays (later collected as The New Portuguese Poetry) for the cultural journal A Águia (The Eagle), founded in Oporto, in December 1910, and run by the republican association Renascença Portuguesa. In the first years of the Portuguese Republic, this cultural association was started by republican intellectuals led by the writer and poet Teixeira de Pascoaes, philosopher Leonardo Coimbra and historian Jaime Cortesão, aiming for the renewal of Portuguese culture through the aesthetic movement called SAUDOSISMO. Pessoa contributed to the journal A Águia with a series of papers: 'The new Portuguese Poetry Sociologically Considered' (nr. 4), 'Relapsing...' (nr. 5) and 'The Psychological Aspect of the new Portuguese Poetry' (nr. 9,11 and 12). \n\t\n\tThese writings were strongly encomiastic to saudosist literature, namely the poetry of Teixeira de Pascoaes and Mário Beirão. The articles disclose Pessoa as a connoisseur of modern European literature and an expert of recent literary trends. \n\t\n\tOn the other hand, he does not care much for a methodology of analysis or problems in the history of ideas. He states his confidence that Portugal would soon produce a great poet – a super-Camões – pledged to make an important contribution for European culture, and indeed, for humanity.\n\t\n\tPHILOSOPHICAL ESSAYS\n\t\n\tThe philosophical notes of the young Pessoa, mostly written between 1905 and 1912, illustrate his debt to the history of Philosophy more through commentators than through a first-hand protracted reading of the Classics, ancient or modern. The issues he engages with pertaining to every philosophical discipline and concern a large profusion of concepts, creating a vast semantic spectrum in texts whose length varies between half a dozen lines and half a dozen pages and whose density of analysis is extremely variable; simple paraphrasis, expression of assumptions and original speculation.\n\t\n\tPessoa sorted the philosophical systems thus:\n\t\n\tA passage from his famous poem &quot;Mar Português&quot; from Message, in the city of Lagos, Portugal.\n\t\n\tRelative Spiritualism and relative Materialism privilege &quot;Spirit&quot; or &quot;Matter&quot; as the main pole that organizes data around Experience.\n\tAbsolute Spiritualist and Absolute Materialist &quot;deny all objective reality to one of the elements of Experience&quot;.\n\t\n\tThe materialistic Pantheism of Spinoza and the spiritualizing Pantheism of Malebranche, &quot;admit that experience is a double manifestation of anything that in its essence has no matter neither spirit&quot;.\n\t\n\tConsidering both elements as an &quot;illusory manifestation&quot;, of a transcendent and true and alone reality, there is Transcendentalism, inclined into the matter with Schopenhauer, or into the spirit, a position where Bergson could be emplaced.\n\t\n\tA terminal system &quot;the limited and summit of metaphysics&quot; would not radicalize – as poles of experience – one of the single categories: matter, relative, absolute, real, illusory, spirit. Instead, matching all categories, it takes contradiction as &quot;the essence of the universe&quot; and defends that &quot;an affirmation is so more true insofar the more contradiction involves&quot;. The transcendent must be conceived beyond categories. There is one only and eternal example of it. It is that cathedral of thought -the philosophy of Hegel.\n\t\n\tSuch pantheist transcendentalism is used by Pessoa to define the project that &quot;encompasses and exceeds all systems&quot;; to characterize the new poetry of Saudosismo where the &quot;typical contradiction of this system&quot; occurs; to inquire of the particular social and political results of its adoption as the leading cultural paradigm; and, at last, he hints that metaphysics and religiosity strive &quot;to find in everything a beyond&quot;.\n\t\n\tWORKS\n\t\n\tHistórias de um Raciocinador e o ensaio &quot;História Policial&quot; (Tales of a Reasoner and the essay &quot;Detective Story&quot;) bilingual edition, translated from the original writings in English, Ana Maria Freitas, edit &amp; transl, Lisbon, Portugal: Assírio &amp; Alvim, 2012, ISBN 978-972-0-79312-6, archived from the original on 14 January 2013\n\tForever Someone Else – selected poems – 2nd edition (enlarged), Richard Zenith, transl, Lisbon, Portugal: Assírio &amp; Alvim, 2010 [2008], ISBN 978-972-37-1379-4, archived from the original on 14 January 2013\n\tCollected Poems of Álvaro de Campos, Chris Daniels, transl, Exeter, UK: Shearsman Books, 2009 [1928–35], ISBN 978-1-905700-25-7, archived from the original on 18 December 2010, retrieved 28 July 2010\n\tLisbon: What the Tourist Should See, Exeter, UK: Shearsman Books, 2008, ISBN 978-1-905700-25-7, archived from the original on 2 April 2011, retrieved 28 July 2010\n\tThe Collected Poems of Alberto Caeiro, Chris Daniels, transl, Exeter, UK: Shearsman Books, 2007, ISBN 978-1-905700-24-0, archived from the original on 4 April 2011, retrieved 28 July 2010\n\tSelected English Poems, Exeter, UK: Shearsman Books, 2007, ISBN 978-1-905700-26-4, archived from the original on 2 April 2011, retrieved 28 July 2010\n\tThe message, Jonathan Griffin, transl, Exeter, UK: Shearsman Books, 2007, ISBN 978-1-905700-27-1, archived from the original on 2 April 2011, retrieved 28 July 2010\n\tSelected English Poems, ed.

        "text": "R.Carlos Coelho, Campo de Ourique, Lisbon, Portugal\n\nBIOGRAPHY [FERNANDO PESSOA] (1888 - 1935)\n\nFernando António Nogueira Pessoa (Portuguese: [fɨɾˈnɐ̃du pɨˈsoɐ]; 13 June 1888 – 30 November 1935) was a Portuguese poet, writer, literary critic, translator, publisher and philosopher, described as one of the most significant literary figures of the 20th century and one of the greatest poets in the Portuguese language. He also wrote in and translated from English and French.\n\nPessoa was a prolific writer, and not only under his own name, for he created approximately seventy-five others. He did not call them all pseudonyms because he felt that some did not capture their true independent intellectual life and instead called them heteronyms. These imaginary figures sometimes held unpopular or extreme views.\n\nPessoa's birthplace: a large flat at São Carlos Square, just in front of Lisbon's opera.\n\nPessoa was born in Lisbon on 13 June 1888.\n\nWhen Pessoa was five, his father, Joaquim de Seabra Pessôa, died of tuberculosis and the following year, on 2 January, his younger brother Jorge, aged one, also died.\n\nAfter the second marriage of his mother, Maria Magdalena Pinheiro Nogueira, proxy wedding to João Miguel dos Santos Rosa, Fernando sailed with his mother for South Africa at the beginning of 1896, to join his stepfather, a military officer appointed Portuguese consul in Durban, capital of the former British Colony of Natal. Later on, in 1918, Pessoa wrote a letter in which refers:\n\nLAST YEAR IN LISBON BEFORE MOVING TO DURBAN, 1894, AGED 6.\n\nThere is only one event in the past which has both the definiteness and the importance required for rectification by direction; this is my father's death, which took place on 13 July 1893. My mother's second marriage (which took place on 30 December 1895) is another date which I can give with preciseness and it is important for me, not in itself, but in one of its results – the circumstance that, my stepfather becoming Portuguese Consul in Durban (Natal), I was educated there, this English education being a factor of supreme importance in my life, and, whatever my fate be, indubitably shaping it.\n\nThe dates of the voyages related to the above event are (as nearly as possible):\n\n1st. voyage to Africa – left Lisbon beginning January 1896.\n\nReturn – left Durban in the afternoon of 1st. August 1901.\n\n2nd. voyage to Africa – left Lisbon about 20th. September 1902.\n\nReturn – left Durban about 20th. August 1905.\n\nThe young Pessoa received his early education at St. Joseph Convent School, a Roman Catholic grammar school run by Irish and French nuns. He moved to the Durban High School in April 1899, becoming fluent in English and developing an appreciation for English literature.\n\nDuring the Matriculation Examination, held at the time by the University of the Cape of Good Hope (forerunner of the University of Cape Town), in November 1903, he was awarded the recently created Queen Victoria Memorial Prize for best paper in English. While preparing to enter university, he also attended the Durban Commercial High School during one year, taking night classes.\n\nPESSOA IN DURBAN, 1898, AGED 10.\n\nMeanwhile, Pessoa started writing short stories in English, some under the name of David Merrick, many of which he left unfinished.\n\nAt the age of sixteen, The Natal Mercury (edition of 6 July 1904) published his poem \"Hillier did first usurp the realms of rhyme...\", under the name of C. R. Anon (anonymous), along with a brief introductory text: \"I read with great amusement...\". In December, The Durban High School Magazine published his essay \"Macaulay\".\n\nFrom February to June 1905, in the section \"The Man in the Moon\", The Natal Mercury also published at least four sonnets by Fernando Pessoa: \"Joseph Chamberlain\", \"To England I\", \"To England II\" and \"Liberty\".\n\nHis poems often carried humorous versions of Anon as the author's name. Pessoa started using pen names quite young. The first one, still in his childhood, was Chevalier de Pas, supposedly a French noble.\n\nIn addition to Charles Robert Anon and David Merrick, the young writer also signed up, among other pen names, as Horace James Faber, Alexander Search, and other mean names.\n\nIn the preface to The Book of Disquiet, Pessoa wrote about himself:\n\nNothing had ever obliged him to do anything. He had spent his childhood alone. He never joined any group. He never pursued a course of study. He never belonged to a crowd. The circumstances of his life were marked by that strange but rather common phenomenon – perhaps, in fact, it’s true for all lives – of being tailored to the image and likeness of his instincts, which tended towards inertia and withdrawal.\n\nPESSOA IN 1901, AGED 13.\n\nThe young Pessoa was described by a schoolfellow as follows:\n\nI cannot tell you exactly how long I knew him, but the period during which I received most of my impressions of him was the whole of the year 1904 when we were at school together. How old he was at this time I don’t know, but judge him to have 15 or 16. [...]\n\nHe was pale and thin and appeared physically to be very imperfectly developed. He had a narrow and contracted chest and was inclined to stoop. He had a peculiar walk and some defect in his eyesight gave to his eyes also a peculiar appearance, the lids seemed to drop over the eyes. [...]\n\nHe was regarded as a brilliant clever boy as, in spite of the fact that he had not spoken English in his early years, he had learned it so rapidly and so well that he had a splendid style in that language. Although younger than his schoolfellows of the same class he appeared to have no difficulty in keeping up with and surpassing them in work. For one of his age, he thought much and deeply and in a letter to me once complained of \"spiritual and material encumbrances of most especial adverseness\". [...]\n\nHe took no part in athletic sports of any kind and I think his spare time was spent on reading. We generally considered that he worked far too much and that he would ruin his health by so doing.\n\nTen years after his arrival, he sailed for Lisbon via the Suez Canal on board the \"Herzog\", leaving Durban for good at the age of seventeen. This journey inspired the poems \"Opiário\" (dedicated to his friend, the poet and writer Mário de Sá-Carneiro) published in March 1915, in Orpheu nr.1 and \"Ode Marítima\" (dedicated to the futurist painter Santa-Rita) published in June 1915, in Orpheu nr.2 by his heteronym Álvaro de Campos.\n\nLISBON REVISITED\n\n\"Ibis Enterprise\", the first firm established by Pessoa, in 1909.\n\nWhile his family remained in South Africa, Pessoa returned to Lisbon in 1905 to study diplomacy.\n\nAfter a period of illness, and two years of poor results, a student strike against the dictatorship of Prime Minister João Franco put an end to his formal studies.\n\nPessoa became an autodidact, a devoted reader who spent a lot of time at the library. In August 1907, he started working as a practitioner at R.G. Dun & Company, an American mercantile information agency (currently D&B, Dun & Bradstreet).\n\nHis grandmother died in September and left him a small inheritance, which he spent on setting up his own publishing house, the \"Empreza Ibis\".\n\nThe venture was not successful and closed down in 1910, but the name ibis, the sacred bird of Ancient Egypt and inventor of the alphabet in Greek mythology, would remain an important symbolic reference for him.\n\nPessoa returned to his uncompleted formal studies, complementing his British education with the self-directed study of Portuguese culture. The pre-revolutionary atmosphere surrounding the assassination of King Charles I and Crown Prince Luís Filipe in 1908, and the patriotic outburst resulting from the successful republican revolution in 1910, influenced the development of the budding writer; as did his step-uncle, Henrique dos Santos Rosa, a poet and retired soldier, who introduced the young Pessoa to Portuguese poetry, notably the romantics and symbolists of the 19th century.\n\nIn 1912, Fernando Pessoa entered the literary world with a critical essay, published in the cultural journal A Águia, which triggered one of the most important literary debates in the Portuguese intellectual world of the 20th century: the polemic regarding a super-Camões. In 1915 a group of artists and poets, including Fernando Pessoa, Mário de Sá-Carneiro and Almada Negreiros, created the literary magazine Orpheu, which introduced modernist literature to Portugal.\n\nOnly two issues were published (Jan–Feb–Mar and Apr–May–Jun 1915), the third failed to appear due to funding difficulties. Lost for many years, this issue was finally recovered and published in 1984.\n\nAmong other writers and poets, Orpheu published Pessoa, orthonym, and the modernist heteronym, Álvaro de Campos.\n\nPessoa's last home, from 1920 till his death, in 1935, CURRENTLY THE FERNANDO PESSOA MUSEUM\n\nAlong with the artist Ruy Vaz, Pessoa also founded the art journal Athena (1924–25), in which he published verses under the heteronyms Alberto Caeiro and Ricardo Reis.\n\nAlong with his profession, as free-lance commercial translator, Fernando Pessoa undertook intense activity as a writer, literary critic and political analyst, contributing to the journals and newspapers A Águia (1912–13), A República (1913), Theatro (1913), A Renascença (1914), O Raio (1914), A Galera (1915), Orpheu (1915), O Jornal (1915), Eh Real! (1915), Exílio (1916), Centauro (1916), A Ideia Nacional (1916), Terra Nossa (1916), O Heraldo (1917), Portugal Futurista (1917), Acção (1919–20), Ressurreição (1920), Contemporânea (1922–26), Athena (1924–25), Diário de Lisboa (1924–35), Revista de Comércio e Contabilidade (1926), Sol (1926), O Imparcial (1927), Presença (1927–34), Revista Solução Editora (1929–1931), Notícias Ilustrado (1928–30), Girassol (1930), Revolução (1932), Descobrimento (1932), Fama (1932–33), Fradique (1934) and Sudoeste (1935).\n\nPESSOA THE FLÂNEUR\n\nPessoa, a flâneur in the streets of Lisbon.\n\nAfter his return to Portugal, when he was seventeen, Pessoa barely left his beloved city of Lisbon, which inspired the poems \"Lisbon Revisited\" (1923 and 1926), under the heteronym Álvaro de Campos.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1920, when his family returned from Pretoria after the death of his stepfather, he lived in fifteen different locations in the city, moving from one rented room to another depending on his fluctuating finances and personal troubles.\n\nPessoa adopted the detached perspective of the flâneur Bernardo Soares, another of his heteronyms.\n\nThis character was supposedly an accountant, working for Vasques, the boss of an office located in Douradores Street. Soares also supposedly lived in the same downtown street, a world that Pessoa knew quite well due to his long career as freelance correspondence translator. Indeed, from 1907 until his death in 1935, Pessoa worked in twenty-one firms located in Lisbon's downtown, sometimes in two or three of them simultaneously.\n\nIn The Book of Disquiet, Bernardo Soares describes some of those typical places and its \"atmosphere\". In his daydream soliloquy, he also wrote about Lisbon in the first half of the 20th century. Soares describes crowds in the streets, buildings, shops, traffic, river Tagus, the weather, and even its author, Fernando Pessoa:\n\nCoffee house \"A Brasileira\", established in 1905, the year Pessoa returned to Lisbon.\n\nFairly tall and thin, he must have been about thirty years old. He hunched over terribly when sitting down but less so standing up, and he dressed with a carelessness that wasn’t entirely careless. In his pale, uninteresting face there was a look of suffering that didn’t add any interest, and it was difficult to say just what kind of suffering this look suggested. It seemed to suggest various kinds: hardships, anxieties, and the suffering born of the indifference that comes from having already suffered a lot.\n\nA statue of Pessoa sitting at a table (below) can be seen outside A Brasileira, one of the preferred places of young writers and artists of Orpheu's group during the 1910s.\n\nThis coffeehouse, in the aristocratic district of Chiado, is quite close to Pessoa's birthplace: 4, São Carlos Square (in front of the Opera House, where stands another statue of the writer), one of the most elegant neighbourhoods of Lisbon. Later on, Pessoa was a frequent customer at Martinho da Arcada, a centennial coffeehouse in Comercio Square, surrounded by ministries, almost an \"office\" for his private business and literary concerns, where he used to meet friends in the 1920s and 1930s.\n\nIn 1925, Pessoa wrote in English a GUIDEBOOK TO LISBON BUT it remained unpublished until 1992.\n\nLITERATURE AND OCCULTISM\n\nPessoa translated a number of Portuguese books into English and into Portuguese The Scarlet Letter by Nathaniel Hawthorne, and the short stories \"The Theory and the Hound\", \"The Roads We Take\" and \"Georgia's Ruling\" by O. Henry.\n\nPessoa also translated into Portuguese the poetry \"Godiva\" by Alfred Tennyson, \"Lucy\" by William Wordsworth, \"Barbara Frietchie\" by John Greenleaf Whittier, \"Catarina to Camoens\" by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and \"The Raven\", \"Annabel Lee\" and \"Ulalume\" by Edgar Allan Poe who, along with Walt Whitman, strongly influenced him.\n\nAS A TRANSLATOR, PESSOA HAD HIS OWN METHOD:\n\nPessoa's alleged mediumship:\n\nAutomatic writing sample.\n\nA poem is an intellectualized impression, an idea made emotion, communicated by others by means of rhythm.\n\nThis rhythm is double in one, like the concave and convex aspects of the same arc: it is made up of a verbal or musical rhythm and of a visual or image rhythm which concurs inwardly with it. The translation of a poem should, therefore, confirm absolutely:\n\n(1) to the idea or emotion which constitutes the poem;\n\n(2) to the verbal rhythm in which that idea or emotion is expressed; it should conform relatively to the inner or visual rhythm, keeping to the images themselves when it can, but keeping always to the type of image. It was on this criterion that I based my translation into Portuguese of Poe’s \"Annabel Lee\" and \"Ulalume\", which I translated, not because of their great intrinsic worth, but because they were a standing challenge to translators.\n\nIn addition, Pessoa translated into Portuguese some books by the leading theosophists Helena Blavatsky, Charles Webster Leadbeater, Annie Besant, and Mabel Collins.\n\nIn 1912–14, while living with his aunt \"Anica\" and cousins, Pessoa took part in \"semi-spiritualist sessions\" that were carried out at home, but he was considered a \"delaying element\" by the other members of the sessions.\n\nPessoa's interest in spiritualism was truly awakened in the second half of 1915 while translating theosophist books.\n\nThis was further deepened at the end of March 1916, when he suddenly started having experiences where he believed he became a medium, having experimented with automatic writing.[citation needed].\n\nOn 24 June, Pessoa wrote an impressive letter to his aunt and godmother, then living in Switzerland with her daughter and son in law, in which he describes this \"mystery case\" that surprised him.[citation needed]\n\nBesides automatic writing, Pessoa stated also that he had \"astral\" or \"ethereal visions\" and was able to see \"magnetic auras\" similar to radiographic images. He felt \"more curiosity than fear\", but was respectful towards this phenomenon and asked secrecy, because \"there is no advantage, but many disadvantages\" in speaking about this. Mediumship exerted a strong influence in Pessoa's writings, who felt \"sometimes suddenly being owned by something else\" or having a \"very curious sensation\" in the right arm, which was \"lifted into the air\" without his will. Looking in the mirror, Pessoa saw several times what appeared to be the heteronyms: his \"face fading out\" and being replaced by the one of \"a bearded man\", or another one, four men in total.\n\nPessoa also developed a strong interest in astrology, becoming a competent astrologist. He elaborated more than 1,500 astrological charts, including well-known people like William Shakespeare, Lord Byron, Oscar Wilde, Chopin, Robespierre, Napoleon I, Benito Mussolini, Wilhelm II, Leopold II of Belgium, Victor Emmanuel III, Alfonso XIII, or the Kings Sebastian and Charles of Portugal, and Salazar.\n\nIn 1915, he created the heteronym Raphael Baldaya, an astrologist who planned to write \"System of Astrology\" and \"Introduction to the Study of Occultism\". Pessoa established the pricing of his astrological services from 500 to 5,000 réis and made horoscopes of customers, friends and also himself and, astonishingly, of the heteronyms and also of journals as Orpheu.\n\nBorn on 13 June, Pessoa was native of Gemini and had Scorpio as the rising sign.\n\nThe characters of the main heteronyms were inspired by the four astral elements: air, fire, water and earth. It means that Pessoa and his heteronyms altogether comprised the full principles of ancient knowledge. Those heteronyms were designed according to their horoscopes, all including Mercury, the planet of literature.\n\nAstrology was part of his everyday life and Pessoa kept that interest until his death, which he was able to predict with some accuracy.[32]\n\nPESSOA'S LAST WRITING: 29-11-1935\n\n\"I KNOW NOT WHAT TOMORROW WILL BRING\".\n\nHe died the next day, 30 November 1935.\n\nAs a mysticist, Pessoa was an enthusiast of esotericism, occultism, hermeticism, numerology and alchemy. Along with spiritualism and astrology, he also paid attention to neopaganism, theosophy, Rosicrucianism and freemasonry, which strongly influenced his literary work.\n\nHe has declared himself a Pagan, in the sense of an \"intellectual mystic of the sad race of the Neoplatonists from Alexandria\" and a believer in \"the Gods, their agency and their real and materially superior existence\".\n\nHis interest in occultism led Pessoa to correspond with Aleister Crowley and later helped him to elaborate a fake suicide when Crowley visited Portugal in 1930.\n\nPessoa translated Crowley's poem \"Hymn To Pan\" into Portuguese, and the catalogue of Pessoa's library shows that he possessed Crowley's books Magick in Theory and Practice and Confessions.\n\nPessoa also wrote on Crowley's doctrine of Thelema in several fragments, including Moral.\n\nPESSOA'S DECLARED ABOUT SECRET SOCIETIES:\n\nI am also very interested in knowing whether a second edition is short to be expected of Arthur Edward Waite’s The Secret Tradition in Freemasonry. I see that in a note on page 14 of his Emblematic Freemasonry, published by you in 1925, he says, in respect of the earlier work: \"A new and revised edition is in the forefront of my literary schemes.\" For all I know, you may already have issued such an edition; if so, I have missed the reference in The Times Literary Supplement.\n\nSince I am writing on these subjects, I should like to put a question which perhaps you can reply to; but please do not do so if the reply involves any inconvenience.\n\nI believe The Occult Review was, or is, issued by yourselves; I have not seen any number for a long time. My question is in what issue of that publication – it was certainly a long while ago – an article was printed relating to the Roman Catholic Church as a Secret Society, or, alternatively, to a Secret Society within the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nLiterary critic Martin Lüdke described Pessoa's philosophy as a kind of pandeism, especially those writings under the heteronym Alberto Caeiro\n\nWRITING A LIFETIME\n\nIn his early years, Pessoa was influenced by major English classic poets such as Shakespeare, Milton and Pope, or romantics like Shelley, Byron, Keats, Wordsworth, Coleridge and Tennyson.\n\nAfter his return to Lisbon in 1905, Pessoa was influenced by French symbolists and decadentists Charles Baudelaire, Maurice Rollinat, Stéphane Mallarmé; mainly by Portuguese poets as Antero de Quental, Gomes Leal, Cesário Verde, António Nobre, Camilo Pessanha or Teixeira de Pascoaes.\n\nLater on, he was also influenced by modernists as W. B. Yeats, James Joyce, Ezra Pound and T. S. Eliot, among many other writers.\n\nDuring World War I, Pessoa wrote to a number of British publishers, namely Constable & Co. Ltd. (currently Constable & Robinson), in order to print his collection of English verse The Mad Fiddler (unpublished during his lifetime), but it was refused.\n\nHowever, in 1920, the prestigious literary journal Athenaeum included one of those poems.\n\nSince the British publication failed, in 1918 Pessoa published in Lisbon two slim volumes of English verse: Antinous and 35 Sonnets, received by the British literary press without enthusiasm.\n\nAlong with some friends, he founded another publishing house – OLISIPO – which published in 1921 a further two English poetry volumes: English Poems I–II and English Poems III by Fernando Pessoa.\n\nIn his publishing house, Pessoa issued also some books by his friends: A INVENÇÃO DO DIA CLARO (The invention of the clear day) by José de Almada Negreiros, CANÇÕES (Songs) by António Botto, and Sodoma Divinizada (Divinized Sodom) by Raul Leal (Henoch).\n\nOlisipo closed down in 1923, following the scandal known as \"Literatura de Sodoma\" (Literature of Sodom), which Pessoa started with his paper \"António Botto e o Ideal Estético em Portugal\" (António Botto and the aesthetical ideal in Portugal), published in the journal Contemporanea.\n\nPOLITICALLY, PESSOA DESCRIBED HIMSELF AS \"A British-style CONSERVATIVE, that is to say, liberal within conservatism and absolutely anti-reactionary,\" and adhered closely to the Spencerian individualism of his upbringing.\n\nHE DESCRIBED HIS BRAND OF NATIONALISM AS \"MYSTIC, COSMOPOLITAN, LIBERAL, AND ANTI-CATHOLIC.\"\n\nHE WAS AN OUTSPOKEN ELITIST AND ALIGNED HIMSELF AGAINST COMMUNISM, SOCIALISM, FASCISM AND CATHOLICISM.\n\nHe initially rallied to the First Portuguese Republic but the ensuing instability caused him to reluctantly support the military coups of 1917 and 1926 as a means of restoring order and preparing the transition to a new constitutional normality.\n\nHe wrote a pamphlet in 1928 supportive of the military dictatorship but after the establishment of the New State, in 1933, Pessoa became disenchanted with the regime and wrote critically of Salazar and fascism in general, maintaining a hostile stance towards its corporatist program, illiberalism, and censorship.\n\nAt the beginning of 1935, Pessoa was banned by the Salazar regime, after he wrote in defence of Freemasonry.\n\nTHE REGIME ALSO SUPPRESSED TWO ARTICLES PESSOA WROTE IN WHICH HE CONDEMNED MUSSOLINI'S INVASION OF ABYSSINIA AND FASCISM AS A THREAT TO HUMAN LIBERTY EVERYWHERE.\n\nOn 29 November 1935, Pessoa was taken to the Hospital de São Luís, suffering from abdominal pain and a high fever; there he wrote, in English, his last words: \"I know not what tomorrow will bring.\"\n\nHe died the next day, 30 November 1935, around 8 pm, aged 47. His cause of death is commonly given as cirrhosis of the liver, due to alcoholism, though this is disputed: others attribute his death to pancreatitis (again from alcoholism), or other ailments.\n\nIn his lifetime, he published four books in English and one alone in Portuguese: Mensagem (Message). However, he left a lifetime of unpublished, unfinished or just sketchy work in a domed, wooden trunk manuscript and typed pages which have been housed in the Portuguese National Library since 1988). The heavy burden of editing this huge work is still in progress. In 1985 (fifty years after his death), Pessoa's remains were moved to the Hieronymites Monastery, in Lisbon, where Vasco da Gama, Luís de Camões, and Alexandre Herculano are also buried.\n\nPessoa's portrait was on the 100-escudo banknote.\n\nTHE TRIUMPHANT DAY\n\n[…] on 8 March 1914 – I found myself standing before a tall chest of drawers, took up a piece of paper, began to write, remaining upright all the while since I always stand when I can. I wrote thirty-some poems in a row, all in a kind of ecstasy, the nature of which I shall never fathom. It was the triumphant day of my life, and I shall never have another like it. I began with a title, The Keeper of Sheep. And what followed was the appearance of someone within me to whom I promptly assigned the name of Alberto Caeiro. Please excuse the absurdity of what I am about to say, but there had appeared within me, then and there, my own master. It was my immediate sensation. So much so that, with those thirty-odd poems written, I immediately took up another sheet of paper and wrote as well, in a row, the six poems that make up \"Oblique Rain\" by Fernando Pessoa. Immediately and totally... It was the return from Fernando Pessoa/Alberto Caeiro to Fernando Pessoa alone. Or better still, it was Fernando Pessoa’s reaction to his own inexistence as Alberto Caeiro\n\nAs the fake heteronym Coelho Pacheco, over a long period Pessoa's \"triumphant day\" was taken as real, however, it has been proved that this event was one more fiction created by Pessoa.\n\nPessoa's earliest heteronym, at the age of six, was Chevalier de Pas. Other childhood heteronyms included Dr Pancrácio and David Merrick, followed by Charles Robert Anon, an English young man that became Pessoa's alter ego. In 1905/7, when Pessoa was a student at the University of Lisbon, Alexander Search took the place of Anon. The main reason for this was that, although Search is English, he was born in Lisbon as his author. But Search represents a transition heteronym that Pessoa used while searching to adapt to the Portuguese cultural reality. After the republican revolution, in 1910, and consequent patriotic atmosphere, Pessoa created another alter ego, Álvaro de Campos, supposedly a Portuguese naval engineer, born in Tavira and graduated in Glasgow. Translator Richard Zenith notes that Pessoa eventually established at least seventy-two heteronyms.[64] According to Pessoa himself, there were three main heteronyms: Alberto Caeiro, Álvaro de Campos and Ricardo Reis.\n\nThe heteronyms possess distinct biographies, temperaments, philosophies, appearances, writing styles and even signatures.\n\nHow do I write in the name of these three? Caeiro, through sheer and unexpected inspiration, without knowing or even suspecting that I’m going to write in his name. Ricardo Reis, after an abstract meditation, which suddenly takes concrete shape in an ode. Campos, when I feel a sudden impulse to write and don’t know what. (My semi-heteronym Bernardo Soares, who in many ways resembles Álvaro de Campos, always appears when I'm sleepy or drowsy so that my qualities of inhibition and rational thought are suspended; his prose is an endless reverie. He’s a semi-heteronym because his personality, although not my own, doesn’t differ from my own but is a mere mutilation of it. He’s me without my rationalism and emotions. His prose is the same as mine, except for certain formal restraint that reason imposes on my own writing, and his Portuguese is exactly the same – whereas Caeiro writes bad Portuguese, Campos writes it reasonably well but with mistakes such as \"me myself\" instead of \"I myself\", etc.., and Reis writes better than I, but with a purism I find excessive...).\n\nPESSOA'S HETERONYMS\n\nWhat this means, and what makes Caeiro such an original poet is the way he apprehends existence. He does not question anything whatsoever; he calmly accepts the world as it is. The recurrent themes to be found in nearly all of Caeiro's poems are wide-eyed childlike wonder at the infinite variety of nature, as noted by a critic. He is free of metaphysical entanglements. Central to his world-view is the idea that in the world around us, all is surface: things are precisely what they seem, there is no hidden meaning anywhere.\n\nHe manages thus to free himself from the anxieties that batter his peers; for Caeiro, things simply exist and we have no right to credit them with more than that. Caeiro attains happiness by not questioning, and by thus avoiding doubts and uncertainties. He apprehends reality solely through his eyes, through his senses. Octavio Paz called him the innocent poet. Paz made a shrewd remark on the heteronyms: In each are particles of negation or unreality. Reis believes in form, Campos in sensation, Pessoa in symbols. Caeiro doesn't believe in anything. He exists.[68]\n\nPoetry before Caeiro was essentially interpretative; what poets did was to offer an interpretation of their perceived surroundings; Caeiro does not do this. Instead, he attempts to communicate his senses, and his feelings, without any interpretation whatsoever.\n\nCaeiro attempts to approach Nature from a qualitatively different mode of apprehension; that of simply perceiving (an approach akin to phenomenological approaches to philosophy). Poets before him would make use of intricate metaphors to describe what was before them; not so Caeiro: his self-appointed task is to bring these objects to the reader's attention, as directly and simply as possible. Caeiro sought the direct experience of the objects before him.\n\nAs such it is not surprising to find that Caeiro has been called an anti-intellectual, anti-Romantic, anti-subjectivist, anti-metaphysical...an anti-poet, by critics; Caeiro simply—is. He is in this sense very unlike his creator Fernando Pessoa: Pessoa was besieged by metaphysical uncertainties; these were, to a large extent, the cause of his unhappiness; not so Caeiro: his attitude is anti-metaphysical; he avoided uncertainties by adamantly clinging to a certainty: his belief that there is no meaning behind things. Things, for him, simply—are.\n\nCaeiro represents a primal vision of reality, of things. He is the pagan incarnate. Indeed, Caeiro was not simply a pagan but paganism itself.[69]\n\nThe critic Jane M. Sheets sees the insurgence of Caeiro—who was Pessoa's first major heteronym—as essential in founding the later poetic personas: By means of this artless yet affirmative anti-poet, Caeiro, a short-lived but vital member of his coterie, Pessoa acquired the base of an experienced and universal poetic vision. After Caeiro's tenets had been established, the avowedly poetic voices of Campos, Reis and Pessoa himself spoke with greater assurance.[70]\n\nRICARDO REIS\n\nAthena — Art Journal (5 issues edited by Pessoa and Ruy Vaz in 1924-1925), published poetry by Pessoa, Ricardo Reis, and Alberto Caeiro, as well as essays by Álvaro de Campos.\n\nIn a letter to William Bentley, Pessoa wrote that \"a knowledge of the language would be indispensable, for instance, to appraise the 'Odes' of Ricardo Reis, whose Portuguese would draw upon him the blessing of António Vieira, as his style and diction that of Horace (he has been called, admirably I believe, 'a Greek Horace who writes in Portuguese')\".\n\nReis, both a character and a heteronym of Fernando Pessoa himself, sums up his philosophy of life in his own words, admonishing, \"see life from a distance. Never question it. There's nothing it can tell you.\" Like Caeiro, whom he admires, Reis defers from questioning life. He is a modern pagan who urges one to seize the day and accept fate with tranquillity. \"Wise is the one who does not seek. The seeker will find in all things the abyss, and doubt in himself.\"[citation needed] In this sense, Reis shares essential affinities with Caeiro.\n\nBelieving in the Greek gods, yet living in a Christian Europe, Reis feels that his spiritual life is limited and true happiness cannot be attained. This, added to his belief in Fate as a driving force for all that exists, as such disregarding freedom, leads to his epicureanism philosophy, which entails the avoidance of pain, defending that man should seek tranquillity and calm above all else, avoiding emotional extremes.\n\nWhere Caeiro wrote freely and spontaneously, with joviality, of his basic, meaningless connection to the world, Reis writes in an austere, cerebral manner, with premeditated rhythm and structure and particular attention to the correct use of the language when approaching his subjects of, as characterized by Richard Zenith, \"the brevity of life, the vanity of wealth and struggle, the joy of simple pleasures, patience in time of trouble, and avoidance of extremes\".\n\nIn his detached, intellectual approach, he is closer to Fernando Pessoa's constant rationalization, as such representing the orthonym's wish for measure and sobriety and a world free of troubles and respite, in stark contrast to Caeiro's spirit and style. As such, where Caeiro's predominant attitude is that of joviality, his sadness being accepted as natural (\"My sadness is comfort for it is natural and right.\"), Reis is marked by melancholy, saddened by the impermanence of all things.\n\nRicardo Reis is the main character of José Saramago's 1986 novel The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis.\n\nÁLVARO DE CAMPOS\n\nMain article: Álvaro de Campos\n\nPortugal Futurista, the art journal that published Campos' \"Ultimatum\" in 1917.\n\nÁlvaro de Campos manifests, in a way, as a hyperbolic version of Pessoa himself. Of the three heteronyms, he is the one who feels most strongly, his motto being 'to feel everything in every way.' 'The best way to travel,' he wrote, 'is to feel.' As such, his poetry is the most emotionally intense and varied, constantly juggling two fundamental impulses: on the one hand a feverish desire to be and feel everything and everyone, declaring that 'in every corner of my soul stands an altar to a different god' (alluding to Walt Whitman's desire to 'contain multitudes'), on the other, a wish for a state of isolation and a sense of nothingness.\n\nAs a result, his mood and principles varied between violent, dynamic exultation, as he fervently wishes to experience the entirety of the universe in himself, in all manners possible (a particularly distinctive trait in this state being his futuristic leanings, including the expression of great enthusiasm as to the meaning of city life and its components) and a state of nostalgic melancholy, where life is viewed as, essentially, empty.\n\nOne of the poet's constant preoccupations, as part of his dichotomous character, is that of identity: he does not know who he is, or rather, fails at achieving an ideal identity. Wanting to be everything, and inevitably failing, he despairs. Unlike Caeiro, who asks nothing of life, he asks too much. In his poetic meditation 'Tobacco Shop' he asks:\n\nHow should I know what I'll be, I who don't know what I am?\n\nTo be what I think? But I think of being so many things!\n\nSUMMARIES OF SELECTED WORKS\n\nMESSAGE\n\nMensagem, first edition, 1934.\n\nMensagem, written in Portuguese, is a symbolist epic made up of 44 short poems organized in three parts or Cycles:\n\nThe first, called \"Brasão\" (Coat-of-Arms), relates Portuguese historical protagonists to each of the fields and charges in the Portuguese coat of arms. The first two poems (\"The castles\" and \"The escutcheons\") draw inspiration from the material and spiritual natures of Portugal. Each of the remaining poems associates to each charge a historical personality. Ultimately they all lead to the Golden Age of Discovery.\n\nThe second part, called \"Mar Português\" (Portuguese Sea), references the country's Age of Portuguese Exploration and to its seaborne Empire that ended with the death of King Sebastian at El-Ksar el Kebir (Alcácer-Quibir in Portuguese) in 1578. Pessoa brings the reader to the present as if he had woken up from a dream of the past, to fall in a dream of the future: he sees King Sebastian returning and still bent on accomplishing a Universal Empire.\n\nThe third Cycle, called \"O Encoberto\" (\"The Hidden One\"), refers to Pessoa's vision of a future world of peace and the Fifth Empire (which, according to Pessoa, is spiritual and not material, because if it were material England would already have achieved it). After the Age of Force, (Vis), and Taedium (Otium) will come to Science (understanding) through a reawakening of \"The Hidden One\", or \"King Sebastian\". The Hidden One represents the fulfilment of the destiny of mankind, designed by God since before Time, and the accomplishment of Portugal.\n\nKing Sebastian is very important, indeed he appears in all three parts of Mensagem. He represents the capacity of dreaming and believing that it's possible to achieve dreams.\n\nOne of the most famous quotes from Mensagem is the first line from O Infante (belonging to the Second Part), which is Deus quer, o HOMEM SONHA, A OBRA NASCE (which translates roughly to \"GOD WISHES, MAN DREAMS, THE WORK IS BORN\").\n\nAnother well-known quote from Mensagem is the first line from Ulysses, \"O MITO É O NADA QUE É TUDO\" (a possible translation is \"THE MYTH IS THE NOTHING THAT IS ALL\"). This poem refers to Ulysses, king of Ithaca, as Lisbon's founder (recalling an ancient Greek myth).\n\nLITERARY ESSAYS\n\nIn 1912, Fernando Pessoa wrote a set of essays (later collected as The New Portuguese Poetry) for the cultural journal A Águia (The Eagle), founded in Oporto, in December 1910, and run by the republican association Renascença Portuguesa. In the first years of the Portuguese Republic, this cultural association was started by republican intellectuals led by the writer and poet Teixeira de Pascoaes, philosopher Leonardo Coimbra and historian Jaime Cortesão, aiming for the renewal of Portuguese culture through the aesthetic movement called SAUDOSISMO. Pessoa contributed to the journal A Águia with a series of papers: 'The new Portuguese Poetry Sociologically Considered' (nr. 4), 'Relapsing...' (nr. 5) and 'The Psychological Aspect of the new Portuguese Poetry' (nr. 9,11 and 12).\n\nThese writings were strongly encomiastic to saudosist literature, namely the poetry of Teixeira de Pascoaes and Mário Beirão. The articles disclose Pessoa as a connoisseur of modern European literature and an expert of recent literary trends.\n\nOn the other hand, he does not care much for a methodology of analysis or problems in the history of ideas. He states his confidence that Portugal would soon produce a great poet – a super-Camões – pledged to make an important contribution for European culture, and indeed, for humanity.\n\nPHILOSOPHICAL ESSAYS\n\nThe philosophical notes of the young Pessoa, mostly written between 1905 and 1912, illustrate his debt to the history of Philosophy more through commentators than through a first-hand protracted reading of the Classics, ancient or modern. The issues he engages with pertaining to every philosophical discipline and concern a large profusion of concepts, creating a vast semantic spectrum in texts whose length varies between half a dozen lines and half a dozen pages and whose density of analysis is extremely variable; simple paraphrasis, expression of assumptions and original speculation.\n\nPessoa sorted the philosophical systems thus:\n\nA passage from his famous poem \"Mar Português\" from Message, in the city of Lagos, Portugal.\n\nRelative Spiritualism and relative Materialism privilege \"Spirit\" or \"Matter\" as the main pole that organizes data around Experience.\n\nAbsolute Spiritualist and Absolute Materialist \"deny all objective reality to one of the elements of Experience\".\n\nThe materialistic Pantheism of Spinoza and the spiritualizing Pantheism of Malebranche, \"admit that experience is a double manifestation of anything that in its essence has no matter neither spirit\".\n\nConsidering both elements as an \"illusory manifestation\", of a transcendent and true and alone reality, there is Transcendentalism, inclined into the matter with Schopenhauer, or into the spirit, a position where Bergson could be emplaced.\n\nA terminal system \"the limited and summit of metaphysics\" would not radicalize – as poles of experience – one of the single categories: matter, relative, absolute, real, illusory, spirit. Instead, matching all categories, it takes contradiction as \"the essence of the universe\" and defends that \"an affirmation is so more true insofar the more contradiction involves\". The transcendent must be conceived beyond categories. There is one only and eternal example of it. It is that cathedral of thought -the philosophy of Hegel.\n\nSuch pantheist transcendentalism is used by Pessoa to define the project that \"encompasses and exceeds all systems\"; to characterize the new poetry of Saudosismo where the \"typical contradiction of this system\" occurs; to inquire of the particular social and political results of its adoption as the leading cultural paradigm; and, at last, he hints that metaphysics and religiosity strive \"to find in everything a beyond\".\n\nWORKS\n\nHistórias de um Raciocinador e o ensaio \"História Policial\" (Tales of a Reasoner and the essay \"Detective Story\") bilingual edition, translated from the original writings in English, Ana Maria Freitas, edit & transl, Lisbon, Portugal: Assírio & Alvim, 2012, ISBN 978-972-0-79312-6, archived from the original on 14 January 2013\n\nForever Someone Else – selected poems – 2nd edition (enlarged), Richard Zenith, transl, Lisbon, Portugal: Assírio & Alvim, 2010 [2008], ISBN 978-972-37-1379-4, archived from the original on 14 January 2013\n\nCollected Poems of Álvaro de Campos, Chris Daniels, transl, Exeter, UK: Shearsman Books, 2009 [1928–35], ISBN 978-1-905700-25-7, archived from the original on 18 December 2010, retrieved 28 July 2010\n\nLisbon: What the Tourist Should See, Exeter, UK: Shearsman Books, 2008, ISBN 978-1-905700-25-7, archived from the original on 2 April 2011, retrieved 28 July 2010\n\nThe Collected Poems of Alberto Caeiro, Chris Daniels, transl, Exeter, UK: Shearsman Books, 2007, ISBN 978-1-905700-24-0, archived from the original on 4 April 2011, retrieved 28 July 2010\n\nSelected English Poems, Exeter, UK: Shearsman Books, 2007, ISBN 978-1-905700-26-4, archived from the original on 2 April 2011, retrieved 28 July 2010\n\nThe message, Jonathan Griffin, transl, Exeter, UK: Shearsman Books, 2007, ISBN 978-1-905700-27-1, archived from the original on 2 April 2011, retrieved 28 July 2010\n\nSelected English Poems, ed.
