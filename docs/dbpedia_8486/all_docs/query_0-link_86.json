Fernando Pessoa was a Portuguese poet and writer born in 1888 in Lisbon. He is considered one of the most significant poets of the 20th century. Pessoa created several heteronyms, or alternate identities and personas, that authored many of his works. His most prominent heteronyms included Alberto Caeiro, Ricardo Reis, and √Ålvaro de Campos, each with their own unique styles and philosophies. Pessoa lived most of his life in Lisbon and died there in 1935, leaving behind a vast collection of unpublished works that are still being studied today.",
