        "text": "This pioneering volume explores the extraordinary Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa (1888–1935) and his relationship to philosophy. On the one hand, this book reveals Pessoa’s serious knowledge of philosophy and playful philosophical explorations and how he has the gift of synthesizing, appropriating, and subverting complex ideas into his art; and, on the other hand, the chapters shed new light on central aspects and problems of philosophy through the prism of Pessoa’s diverse writings. The volume includes sixteen new essays from an international group of scholars, analyzing Pessoa’s multifaceted poetic work alongside philosophical themes and movements, from conceptions of time, ancient and modern aesthetics, philosophy of language, transcendentalism, immanence, and nihilism; to Islamic philosophy, Indian philosophy, Daoism, neo-paganism, and the philosophy of the self. The breadth of his work provides a springboard for new thinking on the aesthetic and the spiritual, the logic of value and capitalist modernity, and ecological thought and postmodernism. The volume also includes the most complete English translation of Pessoa's text (written by his heteronym Álvaro de Campos) called \"Notes for the Memory of my Master Caeiro.\"\n\nFernando Pessoa has several fictional characters who are claimed to be the authors of various collections of poetry gathered under his name. In the criticism, these are often seen as figures substituted for himself, while the poems which are not attributed to any of these fictional characters are treated as his own direct speech actions without subterfuge. This is in line with the conventions that have been dominant in discussions of literature, either to start from the author or from what Edward Said calls the ‘social and economic outside facts’. With attention turned elsewhere, the literary work itself tends to figure as an instrument in the hands of the author for use in pursuing some purpose. In this paper, we are going to bring back the works into focus. Discourse analysis is helpful in doing this. It is also applied in this paper to help sharpen focus on the characters of discourse, their identities as discourse agents and the objects which exercise them, in order to achieve interpretation of the poems as discourse events.\n\nANDERSON, Scott Edward, \"My Pessoa: Uncovering 'the others in me'\" (2020).

RESUMO Após apresentar duas traduções e três poemas da sua autoria, o autor, um poeta e um escritor de memórias, recorre a Pessoa em busca de pistas para entender a forma distintamente portuguesa de criação de identidade, tal como é exibida na literatura portuguesa, bem como a experiência de imigrante/emigrante, compreendendo finalmente a sua própria relação com a identidade portuguesa açoriana.

This paper analyzes how Fernando Pessoa wrote and theorized widely on the subject, established and practiced different poetics. His poetics and theories may be synthesized in the pair \"feeling/ thinking,\" which the poem \"Autopsychography\" develops, pointing to a concept of art as \"pretending.\" How ever, in a kaleidoscope work, this pair of concepts is focused and analyzed from different perspectives; it assumes multiple variations, meanings, and degrees, according to the different \"authors\" created by the poet. As he said, he built a \"drama in people, instead of acts,\" \"a novel without a plot,\" or as Teresa Rita Lopes summarizes, a \"novel-drama-in-people.\" Pessoa created the characters and became the scene where these vari ations confront and interact, where his authors, theorists, and critics act, all \"a non-existent coterie\" created by a single author. Indeed, he became \"nobody,\" and as Bernardo Soares, he confesses, \"I'm the naked stage where various actors act out various plays.\" That is, Fernando Pessoa's work is The Theater of the Mind.\n\nThis article is an essay to apply the notion of volume of being to Fernando Pessoa. The volume of being refers to a human being. It is a container with its edge and a content made up of various components corresponding to the major themes of the human and social sciences: action, gesture, emotion, a thought, idea, memory, character, temperament, social or cultural markers. The article is presented as an exercise in anthropology, not literary criticism. It is based on fragments from The Book of Disquiet. Pessoa becomes a volume of being structured by a character or temperament, his memory, his feelings, his modes of consciousness. Rather than focusing on heteronymic multiplicity, the author insists on the intrastructuration of these elements within “the Volume-Pessoa” writing, inventing, remembering and comparing.\n\nPiette, Albert, \"Pessoa, this volume of being: An anthropological experiment\" (2023).

The volume of being refers to a human being.

RESUMO Este artigo é uma tentativa de aplicar a noção de volume de ser a Fernando Pessoa. O volume de ser designa um ser humano. É um recipiente com o seu bordo e um conteúdo constituído por vários componentes que correspondem aos grandes temas das ciências humanas e sociais: acção, gesto, emoção, um pensamento, ideia, memória, carácter, temperamento, marcadores sociais ou culturais. O artigo é apresentado como um exercício de antropologia e não de crítica literária. Baseia-se em fragmentos do Livro do Desassossego. Pessoa torna-se um volume de ser estruturado por um carácter ou temperamento, a sua memória, os seus sentimentos, os seus modos de consciência. Em vez de privilegiar a multiplicidade heteronímica, o autor insiste na intra-estruturação destes elementos no “Volume-Pessoa” que escreve, inventa, recorda e compara.

London: Penguin books, pp. VII-XXVI.\n\nThere are several documents in Fernando Pessoa's legacy which may give us an insight as to the place the mystic and esoteric matters occupy in Pessoa's poetry. Pessoa acknowledged the occultist influence in the literature of his time, and in his own, and made an effort to explain his particular path, which followed, as he insisted, the mystic and not the symbolist tradition – poetry of thought and not poetry of imagination. Palavras-­‐‑ chave Misticismo, esoterismo, modernismo, poesia, Fernando Pessoa. Resumo Existem vários documentos, no legado de Fernando Pessoa, que podem ajudar a compreender o lugar que os conteúdos de índole mística e esotérica ocupam na poesia pessoana. Pessoa recebeu a influência ocultista na literatura do seu tempo, e na sua própria obra, e esforçou-­‐‑ se por explicar o seu caminho particular direccionado para a tradição mística, mas não para a simbolista, como o próprio autor reiterou – poesia do pensamento em vez de poesia da imaginação.\n\nPessoa ... person ... persona ... personne ... Despite his iconic status in Portugal and constant re-readings of his writings, the Portuguese poet Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935) remains an enigma. This twentieth century philosophical poet of nothingness is an example par excellence of life as literature and of a literary plurality that allows us to hear a cacophony of voices and read a diversity of manifestos and perspectives. His famous invention of the ‘heteronym’ (Greek for “other name”) in literature liberates his ink bottle and takes him down a plethora of pathways and exploring various visions. His self-descriptions and descriptions of his unique art and personas include “Opening nothings”, “Prince of the Great Exile”, “Fictions of our own consciousness”, “The King of Gaps”, “The Argonaut of true sensations”, “Lost in God’s labyrinths”, “The interpreter of crisscrossing subjectivities”, “To pretend is to know ourselves”, “all life is a metaphysics in the darkness”, “a navigator engaged in unknowing myself”, “the vast colony of our being”, “the helpless slave of his multiplied self”, and a “soul” that “is a secret orchestra”. Fernando Pessoa is, as the late, great Eduardo Lourenço puts it, the “incomparable interpreter [...] of his own work” (Louren o 2010, 56). In the twenty-first century and the age of the internet, we are perhaps now finally catching up with Pessoa as we shift from experiences of divided selves to those of plural selves and non-selves."
