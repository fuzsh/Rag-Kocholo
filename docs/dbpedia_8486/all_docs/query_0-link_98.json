        "text": "CHAPTER FIVE\n\nIndia through the Looking Glass\n\nThe Narrative Heritage of the West and Antonio Tabucchi’s Notturno indiano\n\nNo poet, no artist of any art, has his complete meaning alone.… What happens when a new work of art is created is something that happens simultaneously to all the works of art which preceded it.\n\nT.S. ELIOT, “TRADITION AND THE INDIVIDUAL TALENT”\n\nThe word “precursor” is indispensable in the vocabulary of criticism, but one should not try to purify it from every connotation of polemic or rivalry. The fact is that each writer creates his precursors. His work modifies our conception of the past, as it will modify the future.\n\nJORGE LUIS BORGES, “KAFKA AND HIS PRECURSORS”\n\nLike all of Tabucchi’s fiction, Notturno indiano redefines the notion of originality by rejecting all pretensions of uniqueness and creative independence and embracing the agoraic domain of intertextual exchanges and self-referential mises en abyme.1 From his sustained dialogue with the much-admired Fernando Pessoa and his many doppelgängers, to his explicit indebtedness to Pirandello’s and Borges’s metafictional ironies, Tabucchi shares what Philippe Lejeune and Gérard Genette defined as the “palimpsestuous” and self-reflective nature of much postmodern narrative. Notturno indiano is indeed a “text in the second degree,” a text, that is, that adapts “previously constituted models of generic competence” by involving them in a transformative process (Genette, Palimpsests 5). Specifically, Notturno indiano mirrors some of the narrative paradigms with which the West gave imaginative form to India, yet it repeats these paradigms ironically. Tabucchi subverts the models of the grand imperial epics and Universal Histories that from Europe “returned” to India to discover humankind’s origins by combining them with the popular genres of the detective and mystery novels. If the narrator’s journey to the “cradle of the world” reveals no collective sense of selfhood, his detective search for an elusive individual compounds rather than resolves the mystery. Progressively, in fact, the narrator’s quest is flipped upside down, and pursuer and pursued become shifting mirror images, paradoxically and simultaneously chasing and fleeing each other.2\n\nThe Nietzschean narrative scene of Notturno indiano thus both evokes and challenges our assumptions of “causality and temporal homogeneity, linearity, and continuity” and problematizes our beliefs in “origins and ends, unity and totalization, logic and reason, consciousness and human nature, progress and fate, representation and truth” (Hutcheon, A Poetics of Postmodernism 87). Having destabilized traditional notions of unified and stable identities, and having subjected conventional modes of emplotment to the other logic of paradigmatic recurrences and uncanny doublings, Tabucchi’s novella raises fundamental questions about the cognitive status of narrative understanding as a culturally determined and ideologically constructed process. Rather than providing univocal answers, the hermeneutical encounters so assiduously sought in Notturno indiano retain all the power and display all the limitations of “a certain avowed provisionality” (Hutcheon, A Poetics of Postmodernism 90) in the awareness that India is not an empirical object that can be discovered and represented ex novo. As both intertextual and extratextual reality, India can only be revisited “with irony, non innocently” (Eco, Postscript 67)—adapted, that is, through the filter of the varied scripts and experiences that allow us to engage in the process (rather than reaching the goal) of knowing ourselves and the world in which we live.\n\nAn introductory note in Notturno indiano separates, in an interesting game of mirrors, the identity (and therefore the voice) of the writer (signed “A. T.”) from the identity of the character who traveled to India: “As well as being an insomnia, this book is also a journey. The insomnia belongs to the writer of the book, the journey to the person who did the travelling” (Tabucchi, Indian Nocturne [hereafter IN] vi).3 Though the use of a first-person narrator apparently mends this split identity, numerous ambiguities persist throughout the story. The narrator’s estranging and incongruous itineraries in a nocturnal land are inspired by the written word—letters sent and received, ancient colonial manuscripts examined or waiting to be discovered in libraries that are “almost unknown in the West” (IN 59).4 Trips to the book-lined quarters of the Theosophical Society in Madras and the library of the Jesuit Fathers in Goa demonstrate that the narrator’s India exists as a catalogue of European texts as much as a firsthand experience of places and people met during a series of enigmatic pilgrimages. The narrator’s quest is a search for ancient colonial chronicles, for a writer-friend who is the author of novels that have been destroyed, and for a narrative inspiration that mixes the actual trip with its narrative, life with fiction, and the self with an enigmatic and elusive stranger.5 Similarly, the insomniac writer (alert, rational) who bases his journey on the factual and syntagmatic accuracy of the popular Lonely Planet guide entitled India, a Travel Survival Kit, is both separated from and blended with the protagonist, Rouxinol/Nightingale, whose very name evokes the nocturnal and Keatsian dimension of oneiric journeys and paradigmatic narrative structures.\n\nTabucchi’s Counterquest between Epic and Detective Novel\n\nI have argued elsewhere that one of the hypertexts for Notturno indiano is Guido Gozzano’s collection of prose works entitled Verso la cuna del mondo: Lettere dall’India (Toward the Cradle of the World: Letters from India).6 Both narratives are first-person accounts of a trip to India. Both provide explicit connections between the protagonist of the journey and the historical author, with the aim of subverting rather than resolving the apparent transitivity between referential and textual spaces. Neither Gozzano nor Tabucchi is really after the discovery of a mysterious and remote continent. They rather explore the narrative paradigms that have allowed the West to represent India, thus drawing attention to the cultural and ideological presuppositions and “prejudgments” that brought India into the “hermeneutical consciousness” of the West (Gadamer, Truth 456). Finally, both Gozzano and Tabucchi see the trip to India as an existential quest, as well as an assessment of the power and the limitations of narrative as a way to build personal and collective identities.\n\nBesides these obvious thematic similarities, Gozzano’s Toward the Cradle of the World engaged Tabucchi’s interest because of its mixed and unresolved epistemologies. The title Toward the Cradle of the World exhumes the centurylong quest for the origins of humanity that supplied foundations to nations and cultures through the creation of the collective genealogical myths that inspired the Universal Histories’ monumental narratives. Surprisingly, after evoking it, Gozzano shattered the historical resilience of this foundational myth with a statement of epistemological and ontological alienation: “The Westerner who returns to India,” he wrote in a piece entitled “The Dance of a Devadasi,” “does not recognize his cradle any longer.”7 The Westerner’s shocked inability to discover an original Indo-European “sameness” does not involve any conversation with Asian difference in Gozzano. Rather, it involves the melancholy degradation of one of the founding codes of Western imperialism, that of the epic.\n\nIn the “letter” that Tabucchi evokes more closely, “Goa: ‘La dourada,’” Gozzano exploits, and sadly subverts, one of the epic’s fundamental themes, that of the quest. To the colossal pursuits of epic heroes (sapientia mundi and immortality, salus et amor, virtute e canoscenza), Gozzano opposes his own degraded personal quest. Leaving his friends in Bombay, he travels alone to Goa, just like Tabucchi’s protagonist, and engages in a solipsistic and inexplicable search for “the unknown brother of a forgotten friend,” a Franciscan missionary by the name of Vico Verani.8 Gozzano’s wanderings in the nightmarish city reveal that all that appears familiar to his European eyes is only a hollow surface, pervaded by sinister sadness. Of the great Portuguese churches and palaces all that is left is ruins: “everything has tumbled down.”9 Like any fragmented and polyvalent object, the ruin demands semiotic interpretation, as it points in two opposite directions: it both indicates a former totality and exposes this totality’s absence, thus defining the Asian present as emptiness filled with half-erased European traces.\n\nFor Gozzano, depleting the present of epic possibilities means also negating the temporal model on which the epic plot is traditionally organized. Once in the cradle of the world, Gozzano fails to decipher the code revealing the origins of all that is to come. In a world where the first Word is absent or incomprehensible, history cannot follow a progressive order. The only Word that permeates this repetitive history states the disquieting, because rationally undecipherable, presence of an absence: “Nobody knows Vico Verani.… The solitude seems more complete, … now that I know that I have been following the trail of a dead man in a dead city.”10 Gozzano’s futile yet stubborn quest for Vico Verani in the baroque Inferno of Goa yields only one revelation: the collapse of the ideological and aesthetic templates on which, for centuries, the West had fed its imperial dreams and drafted its colonizing projects.\n\nTabucchi’s Notturno indiano combines Gozzano’s theme of the failed quest with suggestions coming from popular forms such as detective and mystery novels. The first-person narrator of Notturno indiano is summoned to India by a letter. The sender is the girlfriend of a Portuguese man named Xavier Janata Pinto, who has mysteriously disappeared in India. The plot of Notturno indiano reveals that the narrator’s quest for Xavier—which, like Gozzano’s, culminates in Goa—is indeed a quest for his own identity. Gozzano’s existential unease becomes Tabucchi’s analysis of the values and limitations of what Gadamer optimistically called the “universality of understanding,” as the shared human ability of interpreting the self and the world, and effectively communicating this knowledge to others (Gadamer, Truth xxxvii).\n\nWith a parodic process comparable to Gozzano’s, Tabucchi lowers the theme of the quest from the classical heights of the epic to the popular level of the detective and mystery novels. If Gozzano’s allegedly personal “letters” became allegorical narratives of the triumph and downfall of Western imperialism, the narrator’s quest in Notturno indiano is an intensely personal adventure, a “pilgrimage, … but not in the religious sense of the word …, a private journey” (IN 28).11 Granting that Universal Histories and grand epic narratives belong to the past that preceded modernity’s nostalgic subversions, Tabucchi suggests that postmodernism inherited modernity’s desecrating attitudes but drastically limited their scope. Once the sense of nostalgia for consoling and universalizing master narratives is overcome, the postmodern author severs his individual history from all universalizing associations. He is emulated, at most, by those who share with him the passion for his “unlikely itineraries” (IN iii)12 across discontinuous and fragmentary territories: “It is very difficult to have a totalizing and unitary vision on a reality that is so mixed and complex and I would say full of holes like ours.… In this world that has become absolutely relative writing also becomes relative, as does the representation of reality.”13\n\nIt is not surprising that once the paradigm of the quest is modified, the formulas of the detective and mystery novels also undergo significant changes. All quests depend on a teleological narrative. The plot progresses toward a goal that in the case of the traditional mystery and detective stories coincides with the solution of the enigma, and in the classical quest allows for a metaphysical and/or existential epiphany. As Poe’s narrative prototypes show, mystery and detective novels impose the order of the intellect on ambiguous and gothic settings. The detective’s mind exploits inductive and deductive reasoning and conducts acts of selection, ordering, and interpretation that allow him to compose the disjecta membra of the real into unitary and organic shapes, filling the gaps of a world that is no longer irrational and illegible. In its often mechanical and stylized codification the plot of a conventional detective story is an extraordinarily closed structure: the authority of the writer over his narrative materials mirrors the detective’s mastery of the case he is unraveling.\n\nIn Notturno indiano the relationship between subject and reality, and therefore, between the first-person narrator and his récit, complicates this formula. Initially, the protagonist is part of a world that exploits all the clichés of the mystery and the detective novel: “India is mysterious by definition” (IN 33),14 the narrator declares, summoning up all the stereotypes of an undecipherable continent, dangerous and alien from his luminous Mediterranean world. With Sam Spade’s trained nonchalance, the protagonist thwarts the tricks of a sinister taxi driver and does not become intimidated by the squalor of the Cage District in Bombay or by the two gangster-types who control the equivocal hotel in which he has reserved a room. Exploiting the lingua franca of money, he manages to contact Vimala, the prostitute with whom Xavier lived before disappearing, and forces her to undergo the typical interrogation: “‘How come [Xavier] ended up in this place?’ I asked. ‘What was he doing here? Where is he now?’” (IN 9).15 From the variety of information that the narrator obtains from Vimala, he separates those bits that are potentially useful from those that are extraneous or unessential.16 Xavier’s illness, his correspondence with the Theosophical Society in Madras, and his enigmatic business in Goa are the clues upon which the narrator concentrates. It is therefore logical that the plot should proceed with his visit to the Breach Candy Hospital in Bombay, the Theosophical Society in Madras, and the city of Goa.\n\nAs is the case with the conventional detective story, in the attempt to solve the mystery of his vanished friend, the narrator-detective tests his hermeneutical abilities. Absurd, incongruous, and unexplainable facts haunt the detective novel in order to highlight the detective’s analytical skills. It is not surprising that in Tabucchi’s nocturnal India names rarely correspond to things, signifiers to signifieds, and gestures to their conventional meanings: “From far away came a slow monotonous voice, a prayer perhaps, or a solitary, hopeless lament.… I found it impossible to make out any words. India was this too: a universe of flat sounds, undifferentiated, indistinguishable” (IN 26).17 What is surprising is that, in a perverse gioco del rovescio, in Notturno indiano what is perceived by the Western observer as the ambiguous plurality and lack of logic of the Indian environment ends up “contaminating” the detective himself.\n\nRather than being the detached spectator able to decipher a reality that eventually becomes univocal and unequivocal, the narrator becomes part of a changing universe of fictions. His unitary and rational identity is progressively fragmented into multiple and shifting surfaces. “[I had] the perfect sensation of being just two eyes watching while I myself was elsewhere, without knowing where” (IN 25),18 the narrator confesses just before boarding the boat that should take him to Elephanta island at the end of chapter 3. In the following chapter all references to Elephanta are abandoned. In a narrative ellipsis, the counterpart of an abrupt cinematic cut, we find the protagonist in one of the Railway Retiring Rooms of Victoria Station in Bombay, waiting for the train to Madras.19 During another stop in the narrator’s journey, this time during the bus trip toward Mangalore, a Jain “prophet” provides him with this disconcerting revelation:\n\n“You are someone else.”\n\n“Oh really,” I said, “who am I?”\n\n… “It doesn’t matter,” … “that’s only maya.”\n\n“And what is maya?”\n\n“It’s the outward appearance of the world, … but it’s only illusion, what counts is the atma.”…\n\n“And what is the atma?”\n\n… “The Soul,” he said, “the individual soul.” …\n\n“Well then, if I’m another person, I’d like to know where my atma is, where it is now.” …\n\n“You are on a boat.” (IN 51–53)20\n\nAs in Gozzano’s case, references to a simplified and popular Hinduism destabilize the ontological certainties of the West. In Notturno indiano these references question the very structure of the narrative with the suspicion that we have been following the quest of the “wrong” protagonist, the “correct” one having gone to Elephanta without us. Rather than generating a clear hermeneutical path, the text is as unreliable and hybrid as its narrator. The proliferation of tangential paths creates detours and gaps in the logical process of detection and gives a sense of displacement, of “things not meshing” (Spiegel 172). Superfluous and irrelevant data take the upper hand in a narrative that, following Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, we can define as rhizomatic.21 The plot of Notturno indiano, it turns out, has little to share with the rational economy of the detective novel or the linear progress of the quest—yet it repeats both, while subverting them at the same time.\n\nIndeed, Tabucchi often juxtaposes the paradigms of the detective novel and the quest in Notturno indiano. At the Breach Candy Hospital of Bombay, for example, the narrator abandons the role of the detective to play that of the pilgrim. He entrusts himself to a guide, a medical doctor who paradoxically shares his name with Ganesh, the merry Hindu God of knowledge, and asks his help to find Xavier in a crumbling hell of meaningless suffering. If the physician encourages the narrator to leave his European prejudgments aside and stop looking for concrete answers in the patients’ archives, his melancholy conversation does not offer alternative hermeneutical tools, only negative revelations: “He plunged his arms … amongst the pieces of paper. ‘So many people,’ he said.… ‘Dust’” (IN 15).22 In turn, the narrator explains to the doctor that in spite of the homonymy with Saint Francis Xavier, his friend Xavier was not in India to export metaphysical “truths” but to follow ancestral traces: “I think that one of his ancestors was from Goa” (IN 12).23 The solipsistic search for Xavier’s origins translates itself into its parodic and humorous opposite: “[Xavier] is Portuguese, but he didn’t come as a missionary; he’s a Portuguese who lost his way in India” (IN 12).24 Simultaneously, the narrator’s quest loses its objective connotations to reveal uncanny reflections, as when the doctor asks him whether he has a photograph of Xavier: “It was a simple, practical question, but I hesitated over the answer, for I too felt the weight of memory, and at the same time, I sensed its inadequacy. What does one remember of a face in the end? No, I didn’t have a photograph, I only had my memory: and my memory was mine alone, it wasn’t describable, it was the look I remembered on Xavier’s face. I made an effort and said: ‘He’s the same height as I am, thin, with straight hair; he’s about my age’” (IN 14).25\n\nMemory is one of the greatest allies of the detective’s investigative processes. Stefano Tani points out that “the traditional detective novel presents a reconstruction of the past and ends when this reconstruction has been fulfilled.… The detective ‘wins’ the past, unravels it” (45). By giving up the ambition to “know” the past in an objective manner, Tabucchi’s narrator produces idiosyncratic memories that create a disenchanted infraction of the rules of detection and discovery. When Ganesh asks him whether he should convey Xavier a message, should he find him, the narrator surprisingly replies: “No thanks, … don’t say anything’” (IN 20).26\n\nIn Notturno indiano the only “knowable” past belongs to the nocturnal territories between involuntary memory and dreams. The Jesuit library in Goa is a monument to the religious and imperial certainties of a defunct world, and it is here that the protagonist dreams about having a conversation with a theatrical and prescient Alfonso de Albuquerque. Albuquerque unmasks the real reason for the narrator’s trip to India. This reason is not only his academic commitment to archival research but also his quest for Xavier:\n\n“And who is Xavier?” …\n\n“Xavier is my brother,” I lied.\n\n“… Xavier doesn’t exist,” he said. “He’s nothing but a ghost.” He made a gesture that took in the whole room. “We are all dead, haven’t you realized that yet? I am dead. And this city is dead, and the battles, the sweat, the blood, the glory and my power, all dead, all utterly in vain.”\n\n“No,” I said, “there is always something [that] survives.”\n\n“What?” he demanded. “His memory? Your memory? These books?”\n\nHe took a step toward me and … with his boot he kicked a little bundle that lay at his feet, and I saw it was a dead mouse. He shifted the creature across the floor and grunted with derision: “Or this mouse?” He laughed again and his laughter froze my blood. “I am the Pied Piper of Hamelin!” he cried. Then his voice became friendly, called me professor. (IN 60)27\n\nExistential as well as academic—it is here that he is called professor for the first time—the narrator’s quest reaches a turning point in Goa. Tabucchi reiterates Gozzano’s point that Goa’s colonial vestiges display the cultural failure of Western civilization and that the hermeneutical quest among these ruins is both useless and sterile. However, unlike in Gozzano’s “Goa: ‘La dourada,’” in Notturno indiano the explicit condemnation of Western civilization does not end up in nihilistic renunciations but rather triggers another memory for the narrator and, with it, another form of interpretive engagement. Oneiric and theatrical, this Proustian memory offers the greatest revelation in the novel:\n\nThe room was impressive.… The windows opened onto the Arabian Sea.… The heavy curtains of green velvet ran sweetly softly as a theatre curtain; I drew them across the scene and the room was reduced to half-light and silence. The lazy, comforting hum of the big fan lulled me … when suddenly I found myself at an old chapel on a Mediterranean hillside.… [I was] seeing that distant scene.… I remembered … the nicknames we gave each other, Xavier’s guitar and Magda’s shrill voice announcing in mock serious tones, like a fairground showman: “Ladies and gentlemen, your attention please, we have among us The Italian Nightingale!” And I would play along with her and launch into old Neapolitan songs, mimicking the out-dated warbling of singers in the old days.… Amongst ourselves, and I was resigned to it, I was “Roux,” short for Rouxinol, Portuguese for nightingale. (IN 23)28\n\nThis scene initiates a detection process based on the analogical clues that orient the narrator in the labyrinth of a prelogical and dreamlike India.29 If, in one of Xavier’s letters to the director of the Theosophical Society, the narrator had read the cryptic sentence “I’ve become a night bird” (IN 71),30 in Goa he has a momentous intuition: “The moon rose. It had a yellow halo and was full and blood-coloured. I thought, red moon, and instinctively I started whistling an old song. The idea came like a short circuit. I thought of a name, Roux, and then immediately of those words of Xavier’s: ‘I have become a night bird’; and then everything seemed so obvious” (IN 71).31\n\nIn spite of all accessory and irrelevant elements, deceiving clues, and incongruous patterns, the resolution of the mystery becomes possible because the detective combines logical and analogical strategies. One can only think about the “double” M. Dupin, whom Poe introduces in “The Murders in the Rue Morgue”: “Observing him … I often dwelt meditatively upon the old philosophy of the Bi-Part Soul, and amused myself with the fancy of a double Dupin,—the creative and the resolvent” (144). But, if the search for “Mr. Nightingale” successfully ends in Goa,32 as we will see, the question about who Mr. Nightingale really is remains open, in a context that confounds the relationship between self and other, subject and object of the quest: Rouxinol and Nightingale. By disintegrating the oppositional logic on which the concept of identity is built, Notturno indiano creates plural and deterritorialized identities—fictitious and discontinuous subjects that join and separate, and mirror and reverse, the “I” and “Thou” subject positions at each step of their nocturnal journey.33\n\nIf between Roux and Mr. Nightingale we see the specters of Poe’s doppelgängers, the connection with Poe also suggests a metaliterary reading of the protagonist’s quest. In the theatrical scenario of the Hotel Oberoi in Goa, Roux meets Christine and, reversing the roles of the initial conversation between the narrator and Vimala, here it is Christine who plays the role of the investigator and interrogates Roux:\n\n“So what do you do?” …\n\n“Well, let’s suppose I’m writing a book, for example.”\n\n“What kind of book?”\n\n“A book.”\n\n“A novel?” asked Christine with a sly look.\n\n“Something like that.”\n\n“So you’re a novelist,” she said with a certain logic.\n\n“Oh no,” I said, “it’s just an experiment, my job is something else, I look for dead mice.”\n\n“Come again?”\n\n“I was joking,” I said. “I scour through old archives, I hunt for old chronicles, things time has swallowed up. It’s my job, I call it dead mice.”…\n\n“Tell me about your novel, come on,” she said.…\n\n“But it’s not a novel,” I protested, “it’s a bit here and a bit there, there’s not even a real story, just fragments of a story.” (IN 79–80)34\n\nThe protagonist, whom we have known as an academic (among other things), introduces himself as an artist here. More Gozzano than Proust, he vaguely describes a fictional universe made of fragments and small things rather than grand narratives. Christine, however, is not satisfied with the narrator’s evasive answers and wants to know “the substance” and “the concept” of his novel:\n\n“In the book I would be someone who has lost his way in India,” I said quickly, “That’s the concept.”\n\n“Oh no,” said Christine, “that’s not enough, you can’t get off so lightly, there must be more to it than that.”\n\n“The central idea is that in this book I am someone who has lost his way in India,” I repeated. “Let’s put it like that. There is someone else who is looking for me, but I have no intention of letting him find me. I saw him arrive and I followed him day by day, we could say. I know his likes and his dislikes, his enthusiasms and his hesitations, his generosity and his fears. I keep him more or less under control. He, on the contrary, knows almost nothing about me. He has a few vague clues: a letter, a few witnesses, confused or reticent, a note that doesn’t say much at all: signs, fragments which he laboriously tries to piece together.”\n\n“But who are you?” asked Christine. “In the book I mean.”\n\n“That’s not revealed,” I answered. “I am someone who doesn’t want to be found, so it’s not part of the game to say who.”\n\n“And the person looking for you … why is he looking for you with such determination?”\n\n“Who knows?” I said. “It’s hard to tell, I don’t even know that and I’m writing the book. Perhaps he’s looking for a past, an answer to something. Perhaps he would like to grasp something that escaped him in the past. In a way, he is looking for himself, looking for me: that often happens in books, it’s literature.” (IN 82–83)35\n\nWith ironic self-consciousness the narrator reveals that the novel he is summarizing is nothing other than the story that we are reading. In his synopsis, however, Roux turns into Mr. Nightingale—the narrator into his mysterious alter ego. Not only are identities fluid and interchangeable, but so are the two characters’ functions (in Propp’s sense of the term): the detective and the runaway, the novelist and the academic, and, to follow Poe’s terminology, the creative and the resolvent individual. In their reciprocal substitutions (Roux who becomes Mr. Nightingale and vice versa) one can recognize the “double” Poe, the author of The Raven and of “The Philosophy of Composition,” and, of course, also Tabucchi the novelist and Tabucchi the academic. If, according to Poe, the successful dynamic of the detective novel depends on the organic interaction, in the detective’s mind, of creative and resolvent elements (the “double” Mr. Dupin), for Tabucchi the novel is not born of organic fusion but of hybrid paradoxes.\n\nResisting the Sense of an Ending: The Quest as Process\n\nIdentical yet different, reversible yet discrete, analogous yet opposite, Mr. Nightingale and Roux intercept and recognize each other during the novella’s climactic looking-glass scene at the magnificently theatrical restaurant of the Hotel Oberoi, yet they decide not to communicate. If in the logic of the detective novel this choice is absurd, in that of the quest it is perhaps less bizarre. In Tabucchi’s postmodern universe, the creative and the resolvent functions do not combine in abstract unities but create shifting and transient relationships; reflect fragmentary, nomadic, and schizoid identities; and tell anticlimactic and open-ended narratives. But it is exactly through these broken relationships and unfinished quests that it is possible to create “fragments” of stories: in these territories the heterogeneous space of the postmodern novel is born.\n\nIn Goa Tabucchi’s allegory of the artistic creation both repeats and subverts Gozzano’s elegiac renunciations by coming to terms with the ethical responsibilities of art. Christine (another mirror image) in the novel is both author and interpreter of a volume of photographs entitled South Africa: Méfiez-vous des morceaux choisis (“South Africa: Beware of Selected Bits”). Christine explains that her book starts with what she considers her best photograph:\n\nIt was a blow-up of a detail: the photo showed a young negro, just his head and shoulders, a sports singlet with a sales slogan, an athletic body, and expression of great effort on his face, his arms raised as in victory; obviously he’s breasting the tape, in the hundred meters, for example. (IN 81)36\n\nThe next picture presents a full shot of the same man and reveals more details:\n\nOn the left there’s a policeman dressed like a Martian, a plexiglass helmet over his face, high boots, a rifle tucked into his shoulder, his eyes fierce under his fierce visor. He’s shooting at the negro. And the negro is running away with his arms up, but he is already dead. (IN 81)37\n\nChristine’s volume shows that relativistic visions of fragmentary details and multiple perspectives have replaced the master narratives of the past with their ambition to capture the whole of history. The volume also suggests that, if the formulas that allow us to give shape to the world in which we live turn out to be ambiguous, and if the classical analogy between truth and beauty becomes untenable, we are not to isolate ourselves in a world of solipsistic renunciation, incommunicability, and silence. An artist’s responsibility consists in foregrounding the compositional structures (aesthetic paradigms, interpretative choices, and ideological trajectories) that give aesthetic shape to historical reality. These compositional structures both repeat and modify the familiar forms that define the hypertexts of a shared aesthetic tradition. In migrating through time and space, these forms adapt to changing cultural contexts and are refunctioned to respond to the differing ideological concerns of changing and inquisitive audiences.\n\nIn its self-reflective and intertextual itinerary Tabucchi’s narrative does not offer univocal answers, nor does it provide the consolation of teleological closure. In a cinematic analogy it has been argued that Notturno indiano ends with a dissolve on the “terrain vague” that evokes more queries than certainties, more hypotheses than “strong evaluations.”38 By giving up the opportunity of experiencing the concrete encounter that nurtured his quest, the protagonist of Nocturne indien neither renounces hermeneutical contact nor accepts the belief that “the feature of contemporary narrative … is to reflect a lack of understanding.”39 On the contrary, Tabucchi claims that life is only comprehensible in terms of narrative.40 However, Notturno indiano tests and questions the validity of conventional criteria of narrative understanding based solely on causal progression and teleological becoming.41 Notturno indiano carves a narrative space where what Tabucchi calls the rectilinear flow of “Aristotelian-Cartesian thought” is blocked by “marshes, unknown offshoots [forks, branches] and disquieting criteria to interpret the relationship with oneself and with others.”42 This is a domain peopled by Nietzschean doubles: an inbetween where self and other, assertion and negation, presence and absence come together in hybrid and complex interactions.43"
