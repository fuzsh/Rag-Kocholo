        "text": "Antonio Tabucchi\n\nPisa, 24 September 1943 - Lisbon, 25 March 2012\n\nStoryteller, theatre writer, essayist, Professor of Portoguese Literature, translator. Tabucchi has won numerous prizes and awards both in Italy and abroad, where his books have been translated in more than forty languages. Other than being one of the most significant Italian writers of the second half of the 20th century, Tabucchi was the Italian editor of Pessoa’s works, whom he contributed to make known in Italy by devoting much of his research activity to him. Over the years, Tabucchi collaborated with the most important newspapers, both Italian and foreign (e.g., \"Corriere della Sera\", \"la Repubblica\", \"L'Unità'\", \"Il Manifesto\", \"Il Fatto Quotidiano\", \"Le Monde\", \"El País\", \"Diário de Notícias\", \"La Jornada\", \"Allgemeine Zeitung\"), as well as literary journals (e.g., \"La Nouvelle Revue Française\", \"Lettre Internationale\"...) and news magazines (e.g. “MicroMega”).\n\nChronology\n\n1943\n\nAntonio Tabucchi was born in Pisa on a Sunday, on September the 24th (even though the documents report him as born on the 23rd) , during the first American bombings of the city. He was the only child of Tina Pardella, a midwife, and Adamo Tabucchi, a trader/storekeeper/merchant. Tabucchi spent his childhood at his grandparents’ home, of maternal side, in Vecchiano, a suburb nearby the Tuscan city of Pisa.\n\n1949-57\n\nTabucchi attended both elementary and middle school in Vecchiano.\n\nEver since he was a child, he started developing his passion for the arts (in several interviews he remembers of the trips to Florence with his maternal uncle who used to bring him along to the Museum of San Marco to see the Renaissance art).\n\nAmong the favorite books of his childhood there are Pinocchio by Collodi, Gulliver’s travels by Swift, and Don Quixote by Cervantes. However, a true passion for reading came to him in his teen years, precisely when he was fourteen years old: due to an incident, he was forced to stay in bed with his leg in a cast. He got through the tedious period of convalescence thanks to the adventure stories of Jack London, followed by the reading of Stevenson’s works, among which he especially loved Treasure Island.\n\n1858-63\n\nTabucchi attended high school in Pisa.\n\n1964\n\nTabucchi spends a year in Paris, where, as an auditor, he occasionally attended the philosophy classes at the Sorbonne, especially those taught by Vladimir Jankélévitch. On his way back to Italy , nearby the Gare de Lyon, he found on a bookstall Bureau de tabac by Álvaro de Campos (Tabacaria, in the French translation by Pierre Hourcade). Álvaro de Campos was one of the heteronyms of Fernando Pessoa (1888-1935). This is how Tabucchi became interested in that Portuguese poet as well as in the country of Portugal, along with its culture and literature.\n\nIn Italy, that fall, Tabucchi enrolled in the University of Pisa (Facoltà di Lettere), declaring as major Romance Philology. He ended up directing his studies towards the Portuguese literature, taking a class taught by Luciana Stegagno Picchio.\n\n1965\n\nAboard his car, a Fiat Cincquecento, Tabucchi sets off on his first journey to Portugal, he crossed the French Riviera, Spain (stopping in Madrid), and finally reached Lisbon. Other than meeting the lady who will be his life mate, Maria José de Lancastre – he introduced himself to her with the question “Aimez-vous la littérature?” – he met important Portuguese writers and intellectuals (among which José Cardoso Pires), at the time victims of political persecution during Salazar’s regime, and he’s mostly in contact with surrealist poets, about whom he will write his final dissertation.\n\n1969\n\nTabucchi graduates (Laurea in Lettere Moderne) under the supervision of Silvio Guarnieri and Luciana Stegagno Picchio, with a dissertation on Surrealism in Portugal.\n\n1970-73\n\nHe attended the Scuola Normale Superiore of Pisa where he studied the baroque poets, among which especially Luís de Camões.\n\n1970\n\nOn January the 10th, Tabucchi married Maria José de Lancastre; they have two children: Michele, born in 1970, and Teresa, born in 1973.\n\n1971\n\nExpanding and elaborating on his dissertation, Tabucchi published a study on the Surrealist Portuguese poets: La parola interdetta (Einaudi).\n\nOver the years, he crucially contributed to make the Portuguese literature known in Italy, especially Fernando Pessoa, by editing his works in Italian, in collaboration with his wife Maria José de Lancastre (she was also Professor of Portuguese Literature at the University of Pisa).\n\n1972-73\n\nTabucchi teaches Portuguese Language and Literature at the University of Bologna.\n\n1975\n\nTabucchi’s first novel, Piazza d’Italia (Bompiani), written in 1973, is published; thanks to this novel, he wins the award “L’inedito”.
