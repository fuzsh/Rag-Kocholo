        "text": "Editorial Review\n\nProduct Description\n\nFernando Pessoa (1888-1935) - a poet who lived most his life in Lisbon, Portugal, and who died in obscurity there - has in recent years gained international recognition as one of the greatest writers of the twentieth century. Now Richard Zenith has collected in a single volume all the major poetry of \"one of the most extraordinary poetic talents the century has produced\" (Microsoft Network's Reading Forum). Fernando Pessoa was as much a creator of personas as he was of poetry, prose, and criticism. He wrote under numerous \"heteronyms,\" literary alter egos with fully fleshed identities and writing styles, who supported and criticized each other's work in the margins of his drafts and in the literary journals of the time. From spare minimalism to a revolutionary exuberance that recalls Leaves of Grass, Pessoa's oeuvre was radically new and anticipated contemporary literary concerns to an unnerving degree. The first comprehensive edition of Pessoa's poetry in the English language, Fernando Pessoa & Co. is a work of extraordinary depth and poetic precision. \"Zenith's selection of Pessoa is a beautiful one-volume course in the soul of the twentieth century.\" -- Booklist ... Read more\n\nCustomer Reviews (13)\n\n\"...all this exceeds the logic imposed on things by reason...\"\n\nPessoa, like all of us, had strong emotions. What we would call moods--restlessness, sensuality, fearfulness, anger, expansiveness--he would call \"heteronyms\". His heteronyms were moods that had become embodied and endowed with a persona. This is unusual enough. He also invented complex biographies for each personality--they had names, histories, accomplishments, tastes, and definite capacities and limitations. Where this goes beyond unusual and enters into the extraordinary is where these personalities each reveal a remarkable gift for poetry. That the poetry can reflect the individual nature of each heteronym, while retaining a universal appeal, is an unparalleled feat. There is really nothing else like this.\n\nRichard Zenith has written a very good 30 page introduction to the poems in an effort to prepare the reader for the depth and breadth of the work that follows. A biographical sketch is provided, the major heteronyms are identified and characterized, and a philosophic assessment of Pessoa, both his influences and his impact, is attempted. But nothing will prepare you for reading a poem like The Tobacco Shop. Written by the alter ego Alvaro de Compos, it is brutally honest, wistful, bleak, and redemptive by turns. Compos, whose mission was \"to feel all things in all ways\",has fulfilled his ambition in this poem. He takes a blunt look at the emotional wreckage of his existence--life slams up against Fate, success slides into failure, genius leaks away into dream, fullness is revealed as emptiness and thus becomes fullness of an entirely different sort. It is this rare, magical, tentative, and all-inclusive human fullness that is Pessoa's gift. The gift is given repeatedly in this volume, and not just through the extravagant Compos.\n\nHighly recommended for poets, students of human nature, and those readers who have a deep interest in international literature.\n\nVISIONAIRE\n\n\" The poet is a faker\n\nWho's so good at his act\n\nHe even fakes the pain\n\nOf pain he feels in fact \"\n\nAs a Portuguese native I am, I must say that Fernando Pessoa was not only a writer, but is to this day a myth, be it in Portugal or abroad. One that thinks that Pessoa \"has more name than merit\" (as someone said some reviews before) isn't to blame, since he's not Portuguese and so he cannot even imagine what is to read and UNDERSTAND Pessoa's thoughts and poems in Portuguese. To read Pessoa in English or other non-portuguese language would be something like reading Walt Whitman in Portuguese (which would be, in fact, MUCH SIMPLER TO TRANSLATE, since there's no english word that cannot be translated into any other language, unlike Portuguese who has several): the essential (that is : THE SPIRIT AND MANERISM OF THE ORIGINAL LANGUAGE) would be lost.\n\nI strongly advise anyone into poetry and visionarism or out of time characters to check out Pessoa. It will be a life long discovery, that's for sure.\n\nAlberto Caeiro.....\n\nNote: This is part of a critical essay I wrote, which is to be found online at: idol.2ya.com\n\nI have no ambitions and no desires.\n\nTo be a poet is not my ambition,\n\nIt's my way of being alone.\n\n--Alberto Caeiro: 'The Keeper of Sheep'\n\nAlberto Caeiro is Pessoa's first great heteronym. Caeiro is perhaps my favorite heteronym of the three; although, it is true, I recognize Alvaro de Campos poetic achievement as superior-- Caeiro is nonetheless the most endearing.\n\nThe best summarization of Caeiro is given by Pessoa himself: \"He sees things with the eyes only, not with the mind. He does not let any thoughts arise when he looks at a flower...the only thing a stone tells him is that it has nothing at all to tell him...this way of looking at a stone may be described as the totally unpoetic way of looking at it. The stupendous fact about Caeiro is that out of this sentiment, or rather, absense of sentiment, he makes poetry.\"\n\nIn a letter written to his friend Adolfo Casais Monteiro, Pessoa described the birth of this heteronym: \"[It] was March 8th 1914--I approached a high chest of drawers, and, taking a sheet of paper, I began to write, standing up, as I always write whenever I can. And I wrote thirty or so poems at a stroke in a kind of ecstatic trance, the nature of which I will not be able to define to you. It was the day of triumph in my life and I shall never succeed in living another like that. I opened with the title 'The Keeper of the Flock' ('O Guardador de Rebanhos'); and what followed was that someone emerged from within me, and whom I christened that very moment Alberto Caeiro. Forgive me for the absurdity of the following sentence: my master emerged from within me.\"\n\nWhat makes Caeiro such an original poet is the manner he apprehends reality. He does not question anything whatsoever; he calmly accepts the world as it is. Caeiro is indeed a child of sorts: the recurrent themes, as a critic notes, to be found in nearly all Caeiro's poems are wide-eyed child-like wonder at the infinite variety of nature. He is free of metaphysical entanglements (as Campos and Pessoa himself are). Central to his world-view is the idea that in the world around us, all is surface: things are precisely what they seem, there is no hidden meaning anywhere.\n\nHe manages thus to free himself from the anxieties that batter his peers; for Caeiro ''things simply exist and we have no right to credit them with more than that.'' Our unhappiness, he tells us, springs from our unwillingness to limit our horizons. Caeiro in this sense is wise: he attains happiness by not questioning, and by thus avoiding doubts and uncertainties.\n\nFor Caeiro apprehended reality solely through his eyes, through his senses. What he teaches us is that if we want to be happy we ought to do the same. Octavio Paz called him 'the innocent poet'; true, he is innocent by our standards, and yet: does not his wisdom--experience-- consist precisely in his 'innocence'? Paz made a shrewd remark on the heteronyms: \"In each are particles of negation or unreality. Reis believes in form, Campos in sensation, Pessoa in symbols. Caeiro doesn't believe in anything. He exists.\"\n\nCaeiro is a wonderful invention; is there a poet before him who thinks, or rather, sees as he does? Poetry before Caeiro was essentially interpretative; what poets did was to offer us an interpretation of their perceived surroundings; Caeiro does not do this: instead, he attempts to communicate his senses, his feelings to us, without any interpretation whatsoever.\n\nCaeiro teaches us to apprehend Nature differently; he asks of us, simply, to see what is before us. Poets before him would have made use of intricate metaphors to describe what was before them; not so Caeiro: his self-appointed task is to bring these objects to the reader's attention, as directly and simply as possible. Caeiro sought a direct experience of the objects before him.\n\nIt does not surprise us that Caeiro has been called an anti-intellectual, anti-Romantic, anti-subjectivist, anti-metaphysical...an anti-poet, by critics; Caeiro simply--is. He is in this sense very unlike his creator Fernando Pessoa: Pessoa was besieged by metaphysical uncertainties; these were, to a large extent, the cause of his unhappiness; not so Caeiro: his attitude is decidedly anti-metaphysical; he avoided uncertainties precisely by clinging single-mindedly to a certainty: his belief that there is no meaning behind things. Things simply--are.\n\nCaeiro represents a primal vision of reality, of things. He is the pagan incarnate. Indeed Caeiro, Richard Zenith tells us, was not simply a pagan but 'paganism itself'.\n\nThe critic Jane M. Sheets, sees the insurgence of Caeiro--who was Pessoa's first heteronym-- as essential in founding the later poetic personas: \"By means of this artless yet affirmative anti-poet, Caeiro, a short-lived but vital member of his coterie, Pessoa acquired the base of an experienced and universal poetic vision. After Caeiro's tenets had been established, the avowedly poetic voices of Campos, Reis and Pessoa himself spoke with greater assurance.\"\n\nFrom a Portuguease reader\n\nI've read many of Pessoa's works and studied him at school. I remenber that after studying some very weel-know poets we reached Pessoa. I also remenber and i'll possibly never forget that after reading some of his poems i just exclaimed out loud \"Ei, este gajo e um genio\"-\"ohh, this guy's a genious\".\n\nI write poetry for some years now and i'm always very critic about it. But Pessoa just seems to be ahead of our own critic, sometimes wondering in our own mind, How does he do that !?\n\nSomeone hear in Amazon was surprised by the reviews posted here and asked \"Is he really that good, or is the translation not so good\" Then he just asked if some portuguease reader could clarify it. Well i am portuguease and i tell you he is really that good or even better.\n\nI try the best i can to be objective in my reviews but when we talk about Pessoa we talk about emotions and feelings. After all who can be indifferent to the work that some call the most beatifull writing in the world (Jean-Pierre Thibaudat) and others remember it as the most inspiring author of our time! If i have to be objective i shall say his poems gives me a shiver in my spine...his prose: a moment of silence with my innerself.\n\nAbout coloquial language, at least the portuguese original texts are not, mostly if you compare them with other famous portuguese poets like Camoes or Bocage.\n\nAs to Caeiro`s poetry and other others heteronyms, it is simply his need to see things in a different perpective.\n\nThis is a man that recognized himself to have sacrificed his live, his soul, his hapinnes and his mental health to be remenbered, just so that someone, even if only a single person, would remember him. And here he is now...and here we are with him.\n\nPessoa is that kind of author that doesn?t carries his heart at his mouth and his cause at his pen, this is a very mental experience, a reflexion on basic feelings and senses, such a deep vision on subjectivism that just a man that baunces between the thin line of genious and madness would achieve.\n\nIt astonishes...\n\nShoddy translation\n\nI don't speak Portuguese, but I've read Pessoa in Italian translation, and I consider his poetry remarkably powerful.I would think that, based on linguistic similarities, Italian translations in general would be more faithful to the original Portuguese than English would be.\n\nI bought this edition of Pessoa, translated by Richard Zenith, and was so terribly disappointed by the shoddiness of the translation that I was forced to write this review to defend Pessoa.Zenith fails miserably in conveying the sheer haunting power of Pessoa.Zenith's English is too colloquial for the task.Portuguese is not like Russian or Arabic:one would have to work fairly hard to make a translation this bad; or be awfully enamored of one's own poetical abilities, instead of being a faithful conduit of the original language.\n\nYou ought to read Pessoa, but find a better translation. ... Read more\n\nEditorial Review\n\nProduct Description\n\nFernando Pessoa was many writers in one. The Portuguese author attributed his work to literary alter egos that he called \"heteronyms,\" each of which had a fully developed identity. When Pessoa died, he left behind a trunk filled with disorderly scraps of unpublished poems and unfinished works, among which was The Book of Disquiet. Published for the first time some fifty years after his death, this unique collection of short, aphoristic paragraphs comprises the \"autobiography\" of Bernardo Soares, one of Pessoa's alternate selves. Part intimate diary, part prose poetry, part descriptive narrative, captivatingly translated by Richard Zenith, The Book of Disquiet is one of the greatest works of the twentieth century.\n\nEdited and Translated with an Introduction by Richard Zenith ... Read more\n\nCustomer Reviews (18)\n\nA beautiful oppression\n\nI wouldn't advise dipping into this book if you're feeling happy---it's sure to knock you off your cloud. I would also advise against reading it if you're feeling melancholy---it will plunge you into the pits of despair. Only if you're feeling a nameless oppression and to wish to see your existential condition examined from a beautifully written literary perspective, would I suggest these musings of Bernardo Soares.\n\nYou can safely approach this work if you do so with the curious equanimity of an anthropologist visiting the country called Inertia for the first time---the dreariness is so extreme that it's fascinating as a field study, but fortunately for you, you can pack up and leave at any time. Poor Fernando Pessoa couldn't leave, and had to invent the remarkable persona of Bernardo Soares to express the anguished monotony of his days.Bernardo is an accountant, a loner, and bored out of his mind. Nothing happens in his external life, but his internal universe is complex, rich, and full of extraordinary insight. He is a \"...a prose writer who poeticizes, a dreamer who thinks, a mystic who doesn't believe...\" according to Richard Zenith, the competent translator. When you sit with Bernardo in stunned exhaustion as he labors long and uselessly to express his thousand forms of angst, you realize: nowhere else will you find the torment and tediousness of mundane existence so tenderly articulated. Bernardo goes about this with the determined insistence of a somnambulist. Pessoa has said that Bernardo was the heteronym that he used where he was drowsy, and Bernardo is indeed given to uninhibited and endless reverie.\n\nAt 450 pages of small print, it is a unique form of self-punishment to read more than twenty pages at one sitting. It can also be some of the most rewarding reading you will ever do. The journal-like entries are numbered, so it's easy to pick up where you left off if you want to read in increments. It's also good to read this in conjunction with one of Pessoa's volumes of poetry, where the other heteronyms offer rational and emotional relief, rounding out the work of this astonishing and little-known genius.\n\nFernando Pessoa, literary masterpiece!\n\nFernando Pessoa should be mandatory reading for World Literature classes.\n\nThru his writings he courageously, poetically and beautifully expresses what most of us feel uncomfortable with, let alone ponder or rip apart - the deep recesses of our minds and the not so pleasant frailties of the human soul.Carving from within and expressing his deepest feelings with outstanding poetic beauty, Pessoa loved life enough to leave us this (and other) outstanding literary legacies.Thru them, forever, he remains eternal, stunning us with the uniqueness of his soul.\n\nFernando...thank you for your brilliant mind, heart and for passionately living, writing and loving the city you and I shared from birth, the \"muse\" that forever inspired us both = beautiful Lisbon!\n\nFernando Pessoa was an exquisite hard to find gem, and totally Portuguese,to this day he still shyies away from the spotlight, yet deserving the notoriety of a MAJOR writer.This is mandatory reading for the masses....\n\nA great book\n\nI bought this item and was not displeased. The condition of the book was great and it arrived within the stated arrival time.\n\nThe book itself is incredible. I would recommend it to anyone who likes creative writing or philosophy, especially Dostoyevsky.\n\nNot so hard to put down\n\nOkay, so I've read only 50 pages or so, and I'm finding the book very easy to put down, and I'm still waiting for him to turn a corner (as another reviewer puts it) and totally change his miserable attitude. As far as I can tell so far, this is just Pessoa scribbling all his depressing thoughts in a journal--no plot OR poetry so far that I can detect, and I'm a lover of modern poetry. I am going to finish it though, just to see if it will change my life, as so many claim it will, but why do I have a sneaking suspicion that it's going to be one big wallow through all 500 pages?\n\nPhilosophy as Poetry for the Mind ...\n\nConsidering my great love of philosophy, it's no wonder a friend recommended this book to me. Pessoa takes all the passionate techniques of fiction and poetry writing and paints, in vivid detail, a journey into the deepest depth of alienation.\n\nWritten in journal style, here we have the distillation of every single emotion possible. While admitting to a very deliberate non-life, Pessoa, a self-proclaimed prisoner of tedium, somehow captures all of the subtle and extraordinarily painful nuances of living -- detached, self-deprecating, opinionated, at times pompous and pretentious, yet we can feel Pessoa as he deconstructs his own soul and in reflection deconstructs humanity.\n\nVivid imagery, poetic prose, and a dire and lamentable viewpoint, this book stirs every emotion, stirs every thought to the logical and illogical at the same time. His musings address a wide variety of topics from love, politics, language, and writing to the day-to-day drudgery of a job, world travel, insomnia, self-doubt, and dreamy landscapes. Truth. What this book expresses is truth -- fitful, sleepless, a waling nightmare -- this is the truth of life exposed to its most intimate layers of grief and suffering. The writing, lucid contemplation at one turn and stream of consciousness at the next, is poetic in its rhythm yet cruel and villainous in its bite.\n\nThis book is Existentialism at is finest.\n\n... Read more\n\nEditorial Review\n\nProduct Description\n\nThe Washington Post Book World has written that Fernando Pessoa was \"Portugal's greatest writer of the twentieth century [though] some critics would even leave off that last qualifying phrase\" and \"one of the most appealing European modernists, equal in command and range to his contemporaries Rilke and Mandelstam.\" The Selected Prose of Fernando Pessoa, a Los Angeles Times Best Book of 2001, spans playful philosophical inquiry, Platonic dialogue, and bitter intellectual scrapping between Pessoa and his many literary alter egos (\"heteronyms\"). The heteronyms launch movements and write manifestos, and one of them attempts to break up Pessoa's only known romantic relationship. Also included is a generous selection from Pessoa's masterpiece, The Book of Disquiet, freshly translated by Richard Zenith from newly discovered materials. The Selected Prose of Fernando Pessoa is an important record of a crucial part of the literary canon. \"Zenith's selection is beautifully translated, compact while appropriately diverse.\" -- Benjamin Kunkel, Los Angeles Times \"[Pessoa] is one of those writers as addictive, and endearing, as Borges and Calvino.\" -- Michael Dirda, The Washington Post Book World ...

A Maria José even appears, in a letter \"From A Hunchbacked Girl To A Metalworker\" (a heartbreaking letter, I may add). Pessoa's possibly affected eccentricities is in full evidence here: witness the \"Riddle Of The Stars,\" a kind of proto-\"Changing Light At Sandover,\" wherein Pessoa receives otherworldly communiqués via automatic writing and the spirits exhort him repeatedly to lose his virginity. Other kicks: his \"static drama\" \"O Marinhero\" and Alvaro de Campos' \"Ultimatum,\" where he personally attacks everyone responsible for World War I (and I mean, _everyone_).\n\nZenith's notes are indispensable (though he peculiarly abandons his \"Disquietude\" for \"Disquiet,\" and chooses American English as his idiom). All in all, a welcome addition to the Pessoan archive in English, and a breathtaking array of further complications. ... Read more\n\nEditorial Review\n\nProduct Description\n\nFiction. Autobiography. Translated from the Portuguesewith an introduction and translator's notes by Alfred Mac Adam. Theseshort, aphoristic paragraphs, ranging in size from a few sentences toa few pages, comprise the \"autobiography\" of Bernardo Soares, one ofFernando Pessoa's many devastatingly captivating literary alteregos. Pessoa (1888-1935) was a multitude of writers in one: his workswere composed by what he named \"heteronyms,\" alter egos with distinctbiographies, ideologies, influences, horoscopes. THE BOOK OF DISQUIETwas found after Pessoa's death, on disordered scraps of paper in atrunk, and was finally published nearly 50 years later. \"A fracturedassemblage of quasi-symbolist reveries, cynical epigrams, musings onquotidian torpor, and gorgeously wrought depressive fits, the book isprobably as close as Pessoa could ever come to writing anautobiography.\" (--VOICE LITERARY SUPPLEMENT) \"I was a genius morethan in my dreams and less than in life. This is my tragedy. I was therunner who fell almost at the tape, and when I was almost there, I wasthe first.\" If genius consists of complicated and heartfelt musings,delightful and incisive use of language (not to mention magnificenttranslation), and brilliance of mind and expression, then certainlythis book is an act (or perpetration?) of genius. ...

Indeed if you try to read The Book of Disquiet from cover to cover, it is almost oppressively melancholic. Nothing much happens, and what we have is a collection of reveries and thoughts - almost a diary, but not quite - of existential musings about life, loneliness and the human condition. It's so introspective that after a while the monotony of the writer's mundane existence starts to wear on the reader. But I would urge you not to read this book like that. Rather, dip into it at random and you will find a work of undeniable genius.\n\nThe Book of Disquiet is written by one of Pessoa's heteronyms, Bernardo Soares, an assistant bookkeeper in a textile company in Lisbon. Indeed we even get an introduction from Pessoa about when he `met' this person.\n\nSure enough at times Soares/Pessoa comes over as being a bit like Hamlet's more indecisive twin, but the use of language is often profound and frequently mesmerising. It's certainly on the heavy side of the reading scale, but it positively soars in its contemplation of life. \"It's like having a cold in the soul\" he says. How beautiful is that?\n\nSome of the pieces are simply a single line, others a little longer but few more than a couple of pages. The ideas are often deep, but the language is far from impenetrable.\n\nTo give you another example, have you ever had trouble sleeping? How about this then: \"Anyone wanting to make a catalogue of monsters would need only to photograph the things the night brings to somnolent souls who cannot sleep\".\n\nI could go on picking these superb musings at random. The book is full of them. It's unlike anything else you will have read, and a book that I know that I will dip into frequently.It's a mystery why his work isn't more widely known.\n\nIf you are of a contemplative disposition, then this may well be one of those books that truly changes how you see things. It's stunning. I'll leave the last word to Pessoa, which sums up my feelings on this book: \"I stare out from the window of my room at the multitudes of stars; at multitudes of stars and nothing, but oh so many stars...\"\n\nKierkegaard, Pessoa- how many of them are us?\n\nThe life - project of Pessoa in his making of multiple poetic alter egos, reminds of the life - project of Kierkegaard who explored various aspects of the religious life through use of alter egos often representing different faculties, approaches and moods of life. But if Kierkegaard's aim is to bring the reader to realization of what it might be to be in true connection with God, Pessoa's seems to be more to dissipate the notion of unique identity completely out of existence. Thus the fragments he shores around his own ruin and attributes to alter ego , heteronym Bernard Soares have within them a strong nihilistic self- and - world denying element.\n\nYet and here is the contradiction and the deeper truth they also reveal a kind of beauty both in perception and in the varied motion of the mental life itself. Lonely solitary lost fragmented Pessoa knows no human sacrifice like that of Kierkegaard with Regina, knows no dedication to his father's task of doing God's duty in the most ultimate way. He instead seems to reveal hidden realities as he conceals that beyond them all may well lie an eternal nothing. Kierkegaard is the many- selved servant of God, and Pessoa the many - selved servant of nothing more holy than human poetry.\n\nPesoa's Kaleidoscope\n\nFernando Pesoa's genius lies within who Pesoa was as nil and not.He wasn't anyone. Only somene who continually writes in \"disquiet\" his persona's variable exegesis.The writing is in the book but the author who wrote it, Fernando Pesoa does not \"feel himself\" as actually being who he is. So, maybe he's actually a different author, with a different name who begins to write a different book. There's all of the writing there, its genius evident in the mystery of the writing itself. All the writing invested with absolute revelation ofnuminous absence. The absence is that of the author's presence.Magic?Truly.The author is not there.But he must be \"there\" because he has no choice but to write.What's the answer for the author who is finds himself as absent?He must undertake the creation of the abent author's presence.How?By literally creating a utterly unique form of literature. A literature whose grammar is of being literal by making it possible to write of the absence of an author to himself into a presence to be known as the once absent identity.Writing through a textual hermeticism capable of transmutation through written words of the emanation of an author as \"logos,\" or the Word. \"In the beginning there was the Word.\" Through the Word as logos, all identity is created in the appearance, ex nilho, of the writer mediated solely through himself in this the new logos of writing itself.Pesoa is not himself. He's a man who achieves glimpses of a unmanifest self-referential identity only through his books. In the work of writing these books, this identity is made manifest as the author's anamnesis.Seemingly he finds out (remembers) he is, and always was, a certain author he now \"remembers\" as himself as a manifested presence. An absolute genius manifested as the author himself being (repeatedly) annihilated through radical self-doubt.Only later remembering who he was as absolute presence never to be lost again. Until this is accomplished all of the laborious, literal negotiations must of necessity begin anew, and are written as literature whose search arises from absence's discontent becomes the new discourse as the art and improvisation of real identity forged in the alchemy of narrative.This peculiar narative reaveals itself as a lived experience of self-discovery.One man of many parts dismembered in his own identity become self-inflicted and religious. Pesoa's own holy inquisition seeking and finding the indentity he is spurious, a phantasm of derealized personality perpetually guilty of having a persona found lacking,Wriiten out in texts as being found guilty of the \"heresy\" of having an identity.Never before Pesoa has an identity crisis of infinite magnitude been witnessed in Pesoa absence made real presence in some of the 2OTH century's finest writing and poetry. of the 20TH century in The writing of a man named Fernando Pesoa. A man lost to himself, in search of the \"person\" underneath the name. Personality and identity as reality grounded in a mystery only to be known by itself: self found through words that are the artifacts of the self discovered. A genius lost to himself and calling his absent identity into gradual existence by a person's absence fading into a personality that's presented in multiple, shifting Heteronyms, or cases of terminal identity lost and regained.\n\nThe beauty of this novel\n\nPoetry often speaks to us; we see something in it, something recognizable, and it's like we are shown a piece of ourselves that had been hidden for a lifetime before. Finding Pessoa's *Book of Disquiet* was like finding a piece of myself. In the pages of this poetic novel you will find honesty, often self-disparaging, and you will find beauty in the smallest observation. However, be forewarned, this is not a book that should be picked up with the idea of light reading in mind. In fact, you may find that you have to put it down, repeatedly, to get away from it, to think, but you will always, always come back to it. Keep it close to hand.\n\nThinking is absurd\n\n\"If i think, it all seems absurd to me; if i feel, it all seems strange; if i desire, he who desires is something inside of me.\"\n\nSums up the book perfectly. Pessoa explores one of his many personalities. \"The Book of Disquiet\" explains, in complete depth and faith, the beauty of a lonely, existential, moment by moment life. He explains the beauty that people forget. He explains the world, his perception, as if every moment were the last.\n\n\"The book of disquiet\" is one of the most insightful books a person can read, but only if one has imagination and an ability to let go. Bernardo Soars, Pessoa's personality who wrote the book, is extreme and eccentric. It isn't easy reading, and it won't affect you if you can't overlook the fact that life doesn't go on like Soars'; that there is more in thinking, dreaming, and desiring than Soars admits. What makes the book so special is how Soars can forget everything but the thought and the moment, and how he can analyze and critique and put into words something that most of us forget to remember. \"The book of disquiet\" reminds me, at least, of how to appreciate my own mind. It is the only philosophy-like book that i enjoy (as yet) because it is the real thing and encompasses a forgotten part of real life. ... Read more"
