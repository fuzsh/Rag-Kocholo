        "text": "Antonio Tabucchi, a distinguished Italian novelist whose work, with its almost palpable sympathy for the oppressed, became a standard held aloft by opponents of the right-wing government of former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, died on March 25 in Lisbon. He was 68.\n\nThe cause was cancer, his French translator, Bernard Comment, told Agence France-Presse. Mr. Tabucchi (pronounced ta-BOO-kee), who was also a scholar of Portuguese literature, divided his time between Lisbon and Tuscany.\n\nTranslated into many languages, including English, Mr. Tabucchi’s work engendered wide critical praise, an international following and several screen adaptations. His best-known works include the novel “Pereira Declares: A Testimony,” the novella “Indian Nocturne” and many short stories.\n\n“He’s the most important prose writer in Italy since the death of Italo Calvino in 1985,” Charles Klopp, a professor of Italian at Ohio State University who has written on Mr. Tabucchi, said in a telephone interview. “He is interested — and this makes him unique on the scene of Italian literature, and maybe European literature as well — in betrayal, remorse and forgiveness. That is to say, what used to be called ‘sin.’ ”\n\nRuminative, elegiac and mordantly funny, Mr. Tabucchi’s prose conjures a state between waking and dreaming. Its hallmarks include discontinuous chronology, in which fragments of narrative glint like shards of memory; the mutable identities of people and places; and the eminently reasonable presence of ghosts. (In the Tabucchi universe the dead rise, speak and go out to dinner.) His narrative approach can recall Calvino and Jorge Luis Borges, to both of whom he was often likened.\n\nThroughout his work Mr. Tabucchi was interested in the collision of anonymous, often downtrodden individual lives with the large-scale machinations of fate. This propensity made his work at least allegorically political, and — with its abiding concern with civil rights, anti-Fascism and freedom of information — often overtly so.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
