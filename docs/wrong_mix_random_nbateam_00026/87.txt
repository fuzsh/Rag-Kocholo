âCrimson & Silver Award : Rhaia Davey â23

The Crimson and Silver Award, the highest honor awarded to a Dunham senior, was presented to Rhaia Davey â23 by Head of School Steve Eagleton.

The recipient of the Crimson and Silver Award is chosen by the faculty as the senior who has consistently exemplified the love of Christ with both peers and faculty and whose life has clearly reflected a desire to honor God and acknowledge Him in all his/her ways.

Rhaia has demonstrated what it means to be a servant of Jesus Christ. Her kind heart and servant-like attitude have been evident to the Dunham student body, faculty, and the many guests who visit the campus. Her concern for others and her service to set a standard of excellence that will not soon be overshadowed.

Servantâs Heart Award: Braden Augustus â23

Fostering an attitude of service to others is an important part of educating the mind and the heart, taking our Lord Jesus Christ as the ultimate role model, âwho did not come to be served, but to serve.â

The Servantâs Heart Award honors that senior whose high school career has clearly displayed an attitude of serving othersâat school, at church, and in the community. Like Paulâs helper, Timothy, Braden possesses a willing hand and a servantâs heart, and has performed numerous selfless acts of willing and cheerful service, not for self but for the greater glory of God.

âKatherine O. Dunham Citizenship Award: Jake Rizzo â23

The Dunham School Honor Code forms the basis for all conduct policies and is the primary building block of the school community. We believe that each student should have a strong sense of personal honor and integrity and that these character qualities will be vital assets throughout life.

In recognition of the important role that the Honor Code plays in the life of our school and that of our students, this award is given to the senior whose conduct and character exemplify The Dunham School Honor Code.

Hall of Fame Award: Jordyn Minor â23

Chosen by the faculty, the Hall of Fame Award is presented each year to the senior who has brought the greatest positive community recognition to The Dunham School during the course of his or her high school career. John Walker McDonald, the 2022 Hall of Fame Award recipient, presented the award to Jordyn.

While at Dunham, Jordyn maintained a 4.15 grade point average while serving as Connections Prefect and competing for the Lady Tigers track team, where she twice qualified for the state meet in three events; she is the reigning 100m 2A Indoor State Champion and the current two-time 2A Outdoor State Champion in the 100m. She holds three school records and is the most decorated female track athlete in school history.

In 2022, Jordyn was selected as a 225 Magazine Rising Star for overcoming adversity and having a positive impact on her school and community. Â An incredible athlete who has overcome childhood cancer, she has been an inspiration with her constant belief in success, determination and hard work. Running has been her platform to honor God.

Jordyn will continue her academic and track career with a full scholarship to Loyola University in New Orleans, where she plans to major in exercise science and physical therapy in hopes of helping others through difficult times and recovery.
