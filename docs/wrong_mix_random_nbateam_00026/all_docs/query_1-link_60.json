        "text": "I was born and raised in Fairbanks then my family moved to Valdez where I discovered my passion for outdoor adventures and animals. I started running sled dogs when I was about 16 and ran my first race when I was 18, the Denali Dash 120 with only five dogs. I moved to Willow where I worked for the Fiedlers and Alaska Heli-mush who mentored and taught me the best dog care and successful training techniques. In 2011 I moved to Bend, Oregon where I completed a degree in Fish and Wildlife Management with OSU. I had a small team of dogs and would enter every race I could get to from the Bachelor Butte to Wyoming Stage Stop. I moved to Montana while running my sled-dog tour business, Evermore Adventures, in 2018. This just drove my passion for mushing even more. In 2019 I became the first woman to finish the Rocky Mountain Triple Crown, taking 2nd place. In 2020 I set a course record in the Eagle Cap Extreme 200, and took 2nd place in Race to the Sky 300. Today I have 26 wonderful Alaskan huskies that love to go on adventures. We’re all looking forward to running down the Iditarod trail.\n\nI would also like to take this moment to thank everyone who has helped me along the way. You’re too numerous to name on here but you know who you are! The Evermore dogs and I are eternally grateful for your support.\n\nSPONSORS:"
