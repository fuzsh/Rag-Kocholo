        "text": "The comedy categories in this year's prime time Emmy Awards are packed with major talent. From Lena Dunham to Bob Newhart, there are major stars vying for the top honors this year. Check out who might take home the Emmy - do you agree?\n\nLena Dunham, Girls\n\nLena Dunham may very well take home an Emmy Award as Lead Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on HBO's hit show, \"Girls\" following her Golden Globes win earlier this year. The second season of the series featured Dunham's character in some seriously dramatic situations, but she also her acted her way through many light-hearted comedic moments as her character Hannah coped with obsessive-compulsive disorder. It's become clear that Dunham's early success was no fluke.\n\nJason Bateman, Arrested Development\n\nThe Lead Actor in a Comedy Series category is full of audience favorites like \"30 Rock's\" Alec Baldwin and \"The Big Bang Theory's\" Jim Parsons. Still, our pick to take home the prize is \"Arrested Development's\" Jason Bateman. Bateman is that rare find in Hollywood - a seemingly well-adjusted former child star. He seems to be well-liked by his peers, and he has worked steadily over the past few years to build an adult career out of smart, funny roles in ensemble films. \"Arrested Development\" also has a rabid fan base, all of whom were ecstatic to see the show return this year on Netflix after a hiatus of several years. Matt LeBlanc is also hysterical, playing a surreal version of himself on \"Episodes,\" but many voters may not have seen that series.\n\nBob Newhart, The Big Bang Theory\n\nAnyone who watched Bob Newhart's guest appearance on \"The Big Bang Theory\" would gladly hand the veteran actor the Emmy for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series. Newhart's classic timing upstaged everyone on the show, and all the actors were clearly loving the challenge of keeping up with the visiting icon. His character, Arthur Jeffries, was a former children's television star whom all of the show's uber-geeks idolized in their youth, and it didn't appear to be an acting stretch for the younger cast to fawn over Newhart's talent.\n\nTina Fey and Alec Baldwin, 30 Rock\n\nThis was 30 Rock's final season on the air, and Emmy voters may want to celebrate the end of this well-loved series. Both Tina Fey and Alec Baldwin have driven the show to a long, successful run, and Fey has plenty of fans from her work on \"Saturday Night Live\" and in films like \"Mean Girls.\" Fey last won for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series back in 2008, Dunham along with long time gal pal Amy Poehler could be her stiffest competition. Baldwin also won in 2008 for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series and again in 2009.\n\nJane Lynch, Glee\n\nJane Lynch is a solid, reliably funny comedienne, whether in her supporting role as Sue Sylvester on \"Glee\" or improvising up a storm in the Christopher Guest films. She has been making the rounds of the entertainment industry as well, starring in \"Annie\" on Broadway and hosting a game show on television. The woman doesn't seem to believe in down time, and her hard work may pay off on Emmy night. Of course, there is also a nostalgic wave of support for \"Glee\" in the aftermath of star Cory Monteith's untimely death, and this would be a way to honor his time on the show."
