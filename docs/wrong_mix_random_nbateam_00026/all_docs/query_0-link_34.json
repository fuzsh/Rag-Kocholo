        "text": "James Adams\n\nSchreck Rose Dapello Adams Berlin & Dunham\n\nCornell Law School\n\nAdams says the launch of his client Natasha Lyonne’s Peacock series Poker Face put the streaming service “on a different level” of original programming. Meanwhile, John Krasinski produced, wrote and stars in If for Paramount, Joy Bryant stars in the Spiderwick Chronicles reboot and Annaleigh Ashford returns to Broadway in Sweeney Todd. Adams’ roster also includes Kathryn Hahn and Kevin Hart.\n\nAn industry rule made to be broken “Precedent. Let the creatives be creatives.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Perseverance and treating each other with respect.”\n\nMichael Auerbach\n\nJackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner & Klein\n\nNYU School of Law\n\nSeveral of Auerbach’s clients had a scary-good year: Actor turned filmmaker Zach Cregger found himself in multiple bidding wars after Barbarian; Mia Goth’s work in X and Pearl made her a horror queen, signing a third entry in Ti West’s series; and director Rob Savage made thriller The Boogeyman. “It was a horror business I didn’t anticipate,” says the father of four young sons. Jonathan Majors saw two years of chess piece-placing deals pay off with a trajectory that began with Loki and Devotion and would continue into this year with Magazine Dreams, Ant-Man 3 and Creed. Elsewhere, client Ben Platt returned to Broadway, Leslie Odom Jr. nabbed the lead in The Exorcist reboot, Corey Hawkins joined The Color Purple movie, and Eiza González signed on to star in Netflix’s high-priced Three Body Problem. Auerbach says he focuses on “building a business architecture that represents the clients’ interests and letting the art lead.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Craig T. Nelson. I’m 39 going on 70, and I was influenced by Coach. Him or Brendan Gleeson.”\n\nI admire “My partners Kim Jaime, Ryan LeVine, Peter Sample and Jeff Hynick. We have been together the entirety of my career at Jackoway. They have always been champions of mine and I of theirs. I wouldn’t have been able to achieve what I have without their support from day one.”\n\nKarl Austen\n\nJackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner & Klein\n\nHarvard Law School\n\nA master at growing actors over the long haul, Austen renegotiated Finn Wolfhard’s deal for Stranger Things season five and Norman Reedus’ for The Walking Dead spinoff — each at around $1 million per episode. (Wolfhard started out making $35,000 per episode and Reedus made $8,500 for what was initially a guest appearance.) He also made massive deals for Matt Reeves’ The Batman sequel and Fede Álvarez’s upcoming Alien installment and inked multiple projects for Dave Bautista, including Dune: Part Two, Knock at the Cabin and Glass Onion. Austen, who has been his firm’s managing partner for the past three years, is focused on keeping the firm relevant for the future in very uncertain times. “There will always be cycles,” he says. “You just have to ride through them.”\n\nI admire “Alan Wertheimer because he loves his job, has passion for clients, and he hired me 30 years ago this month.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Hard work, passionate advocacy and luck.”\n\nJohn Berlinski\n\nBird Marella Boxer Wolpert Nessim Drooks Lincenberg & Rhow\n\nUniversity of Michigan Law School\n\nBerlinski, who resolved client Katie O’Connell Marsh’s Narcos profits suit on the eve of trial and reps Chuck Norris in his Walker, Texas Ranger fight, says the industry is still feeling “aftershocks” from the rise of wholly owned streaming platforms. “We continue to see disputes about how these rights should be valued for purposes of accounting to profit participants and the guilds,” says the attorney, who last year made the move to Bird Marella after nine years at Kasowitz Benson Torres.\n\nHow I start my workday “Greens 4 cold-pressed juice.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “George Clooney, since we share the same hair color. (The rest is aspirational).”\n\nJeff Bernstein\n\nJackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner & Klein\n\nHarvard Law School\n\nThree of Bernstein’s powerhouse clients landed Golden Globe noms this year: Carey Mulligan, Hilary Swank and Margot Robbie, the latter set to produce and star in the Oceans prequel and has two upcoming Amazon films under her LuckyChap banner. And Tessa Thompson has first-looks in the works for her production company, Viva Maude, as well as actor-producer deals for the limited series His & Hers with Fifth Season and a Hedda Gabler film with Plan B. Elsewhere, Bernstein says more clients, like Judi Dench and John Leguizamo, are landing book deals.\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Working hard and having integrity — and a little luck never hurts.”\n\nI admire “Margot Robbie because she is kind to everyone.”\n\nGordon Bobb\n\nDel Shaw Moonves Tanaka Finkelstein Lezcano Bobb & Dang\n\nColumbia Law School\n\nBobb’s roster is a who’s who of A-list talent both in front of and behind the camera. Director Justin Simien has Haunted Mansion out later this year, Amandla Stenberg joins the Star Wars universe in Disney+ series The Acolyte, and the Lena Waithe-produced doc Being Mary Tyler Moore opened to rave reviews at SXSW. Bobb also celebrated a career milestone in 2022 — being elevated to name partner in his longtime firm, along with colleague Loan Dang.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Sterling K. Brown”\n\nAn industry rule that’s made to be broken “Series sales bonuses and development fees.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Adapting to innovation.”\n\nLeigh Brecheen\n\nBrecheen Feldman Breimer Silver & Thompson\n\nSandra Day O’Connor College of Law\n\nA go-to adviser for some of the biggest names in comedy, including John Oliver, Rob Delaney and Iliza Shlesinger, Brecheen worked on the $150 million sale of Conan O’Brien’s Team Coco to SiriusXM — which also saw a five-year talent deal for O’Brien — as well as the sale of 60 percent of Brad Pitt’s Plan B Entertainment to Mediawan. She also closed a new five-year contract renewal for Kevin Beggs as chairman of Lionsgate TV.\n\nHow I start my workday “Cappuccino, workout, NPR News.”\n\nI admire “Conan O’Brien: Brilliant, likable, exceptionally generous with credit and money, principled, and has a remarkable ability to be ahead of the curve in adapting to changing times.”\n\nAn industry rule that’s made to be broken “’We only gives series bonuses, not real backends’” needs to be OVER.”\n\nAndrew Brettler\n\nBerk Brettler\n\nBrooklyn Law School\n\nThere’s been no slowdown for Brettler since making the “life-changing move” to launch a firm with criminal law powerhouse Blair Berk — just less sleep. In the past year, he’s helped Lindsay Lohan resolve her crypto trouble with the SEC; defended Sydney Sweeney in a dispute with LA Collective over a failed swimwear deal and led the charge in Chelsea Handler’s suit against ThirdLove for backing out of an ad campaign, while also advising Armie Hammer, Tiffany Haddish and writer Elisabeth Finch.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Jeremy Allen White”\n\nI admire “My partner Blair Berk because she fights so hard for her clients every day.”\n\nAn industry rule made to be broken “You don’t necessarily have to break rules, but all rules should be tested. My clients rely upon original thinking to best protect their rights and reputations.”\n\nChad Christopher\n\nGoodman Genow Schenkman Smelkinson & Christopher\n\nUSC Gould School of Law\n\nChristopher helped Miles Teller reteam with Top Gun studio Skydance in Apple TV+’s The Gorge and negotiated Shang-Chi director Destin Daniel Cretton’s return to the MCU with the Avengers movie The Kang Dynasty. The best part of his job, he says, is helping clients overcome obstacles. “There is no greater feeling than helping a client overcome an impediment, economic or otherwise, that has prevented or limited such client from achieving their artistic goals.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Endurance.”\n\nAn industry rule that’s made to be broken “’It’s called showbusiness, not show friends.’ I disagree. I’ve worked with the majority of my partners for close to twenty years and consider them some of my closest friends.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Watching a great series or film with my wife, and a large glass of wine.”\n\nStephen Clark\n\nLichter Grossman Nichols Adler Feldman & Clark\n\nUC College of the Law, San Francisco\n\nClark advised George Clooney and Grant Heslov on a new TV overall with 101 Studios and feature overall with Warners, with the pair in production on the Clooney starrer Wolves for Apple TV+. Meanwhile, Ti West came off the back-to-back acclaim of A24’s X and Pearl by setting up MaXXXine, set to shoot this spring. Rian Johnson and Ram Bergman continued their Knives Out mystery with Glass Onion, and Clark says John Wick 4’s Shay Hatten has been “on a run like I’ve never seen before for a young writer.” His most challenging deals, however, have been in TV development. “They should be easy but they are tricky and have been unduly time-consuming,” says Clark. “It could be volume, or maybe it’s a time of contraction, but it feels like what once was easier to do via a handshake, it’s reverted to a labored process.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Damian Lewis”\n\nAn industry rule that’s made to be broken “‘Don’t take no for an answer.’ While I admire those who pursue their dreams over every apparent obstacle, sometimes a closed door can redirect you to an open one you might otherwise not have found.”\n\nJeff Cohen\n\nCohen Gardner\n\nUCLA School of Law\n\nTo get to Data, you have to go through Chunk. Ke Huy Quan’s Goonies co-star is his lawyer, working out the actor’s deal for Everything Everywhere All at Once. Cohen also reps Michelle Yeoh — “Next year we’re aiming for 75 percent [of Oscar-winning actors as clients],” he quips — and has negotiated all of the pair’s subsequent gigs, which include Loki (for Quan), Wicked (for Yeoh) and American Born Chinese (for both). Asked whether Quan’s success has him dreaming of his own on-camera comeback, Cohen’s replies: “Absolutely not! I’ll stay in my legal dungeon where I belong. I don’t have to audition and I still get to go to the parties.”\n\nI admire “Richard Donner because he taught me about the most important things in life and the biz.”\n\nHow I start my workday “Quiet weeping.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Also, quiet weeping.”\n\nRobert Darwell\n\nSheppard Mullin\n\nGeorgetown Law\n\nDarwell represents Amazon Studios in some of its biggest deals, including the $8.5 billion MGM acquisition and a rights deal to the Parker crime novels by Richard Stark that will see Robert Downey Jr. and Shane Black adapting the IP for the studio. The lawyer also works with the likes of Disney, Nickelodeon, Wondery and Meta.\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Be smart, work hard and be open to fateful opportunities.”\n\nHow I start my workday “A Diet Coke and emails.”\n\nHow I end my workday “A Grey Goose and emails.”\n\nWarren Dern\n\nSloane Offer Weber & Dern\n\nSouthwestern Law School\n\nClient Zack Snyder’s space opera Rebel Moon hits Netflix in December, and he’s working on Rebel Moon Part 2. Todd Phillips has wrapped Joker: Folie à Deux, while Paul Feig is filming the action-comedy Grand Death Lotto, starring Awkwafina, Simu Liu and John Cena, for Amazon. On the acting side, Rebel Wilson is serving up the tennis comedy Double Fault for Paramount. Other longtime clients include Amy Poehler and J.A. Bayona.\n\nAn industry rule made to be broken “I suppose, ‘Do not take no for an answer.’ ”\n\nI admire “Anyone who, in addition to their primary job, gives back to their community.”\n\nAndré Des Rochers\n\nGranderson Des Rochers\n\nHoward University School of Law\n\nZendaya — for whom Des Rochers handled a groundbreaking deal for Euphoria’s next season — is poised to have a bigger year than ever, with Luca Guadagnino’s Challengers and the second Dune film. The attorney also reps indie visionaries with a pas- sion for underrepresented voices like Everything Everywhere All at Once producer Jonathan Wang, Moonlight and Aftersun production outfit Pastel, and Nanny filmmaker Nikyatu Jusu, now working on an untitled horror film for Monkeypaw and Universal. “The people I work with are reflections of the diversity of my natural experience,” Des Rochers says.\n\nI admire “Nina Shaw because we all stand on her shoulders as black lawyers. She’s poised, elegant and a charmed dealmaker. There are a lot of ways that my generation of non-white lawyers benefit from the work that she did.”\n\nHow I start my workday “I wake my 19-month-old daughter up, give her a snuggle and change her, then I work out. I try not to check my phone first thing. I look, but I try not to respond.”\n\nKen Deutsch\n\nLatham & Watkins\n\nHarvard Law School\n\nIf you want to invest, raise capital or explore tricky deals, Deutsch is your man. A go-to expert for financial players, studios, streamers and indies like Content Partners, Participant Media and Anonymous Content, he also advises Jon Favreau and his companies and recently helped Charles D. King’s Macro raise $90 million to broaden its ambitions. Says Deutsch, “I love advising clients like Macro throughout their life cycle, from original capitalization through a variety of strategic deals and financings, and eventually to an IPO, sale or other successful exit in the future.”\n\nHow I start my workday “A 20- to 30-minute meditation.”\n\nI admire “My client Jon Favreau because he is insatiably curious.”\n\nIsaac Dunham\n\nSchreck Rose Dapello Adams Berlin & Dunham\n\nColumbia Law School\n\nThis year, Dunham, who represents such talent as Awkwafina, Kumail Nanjiani and John Mulaney, saw his client Nick Kroll co-create, executive produce and star in the Hulu series History of the World: Part II alongside original creator Mel Brooks. Meanwhile, last year Amy Schumer premiered a comedy on Hulu, Life & Beth, and Rachel Brosnahan is wrapping up the final season of Amazon’s The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Brad Pitt, of course.”\n\nI admire “Our client Amy Schumer because she is principled, fearless and hilarious.”\n\nAn industry rule that’s made to be broken “You have to conform to a model that’s worked before.”\n\nDavid Eisman\n\nSkadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom\n\nUCLA School of Law\n\nThere was no shortage of Lord of the Rings deals in 2022. For his part, Eisman represented the Swedish gaming conglomerate Embracer in its major acquisition of the global IP rights to both J.R.R. Tolkien’s trilogy and The Hobbit across film, games, merch, theme parks and stage productions. Outside of Middle-earth, Eisman repped UTA in its acquisition of the Curtis Brown Group and in the sale of a stake to EQT, now the largest outside shareholder in UTA.\n\nHow I start my workday “Putting on an 80’s-style track suit on work-at-home days.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Watching the L.A. Kings or Dodgers.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “John Cusack”\n\nCraig Emanuel\n\nPaul Hastings\n\nMonash University Law\n\nFor longtime client Ryan Murphy, Emanuel negotiated two new Netflix shows: Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story and The Watcher. And he handled Tom Hanks’ deal to star in A Man Called Otto. He notes, “This shows that the theatrical release of adult dramas still has an audience and there is no role that Tom cannot play.” Emanuel also worked with The Bourne Legacy director Tony Gilroy as he created the Andor series to reconfigure the Rogue One franchise.\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Remembering you’re not always the smartest person in the room.”\n\nI admire “Sidney Poitier, because at a time of great prejudice in our country the roles he played changed the views and minds of a large number of people.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “John Turturro”\n\nJeff Endlich\n\nYorn Levine Barnes Krintzman Rubenstein Kohner Endlich & Gellman\n\nCardozo School of Law\n\nThe massive commercial and critical achievements of Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert for their film Everything Everywhere All at Once” is a highlight of his year, says Endlich, who represents three of Hollywood’s most lauded filmmakers: the aforementioned Daniels, who won Academy Awards for best director and best picture, and fellow Oscar winner Taika Waititi (Jojo Rabbit). Endlich’s roster also includes top TV talent like Liz Feldman (Dead to Me) and Raphael Bob-Waksberg (BoJack Horseman).\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Taika Waititi”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “I think it’s absolutely key to be surrounded by people who support you and share your goals. I’ve been at my firm for over 20 years, and I am beyond grateful to have the support of my brilliant partners who are truly the best in the business.”\n\nAlan Epstein\n\nWillkie Farr & Gallagher\n\nUCLA School of Law\n\nA longtime adviser to Ryan Reynolds, Epstein most recently worked on his $1.35 billion sale of Mint Mobile to T-Mobile after having previously advised on the $610 million sale of Reynolds’ Aviation Gin brand. When it comes to these types of deals, Epstein says George Clooney’s billion-dollar Casamigos sale “is probably the only other one in that same stratosphere.” Epstein, who also represented Brad Pitt’s Plan B in its stake sale to Mediawan, says premium creators “are still in high demand,” whether that’s onscreen or in the boardroom.\n\nHow I start my workday “Early.”\n\nHow I end my workday “With a deep sigh and an Aviation gin and tonic.”\n\nJamie Feldman\n\nLichter Grossman Nichols Adler Feldman & Clark\n\nHarvard Law School\n\n“What the deals are and who the buyers are change every few years,” says Feldman of the increasingly fast-paced Hollywood turnover. “It’s a source of frustration but also challenging in a good sense. We get to reinvent the wheel.” Feldman, who counts Viola Davis, Barry Jenkins and Ted Lasso breakout Juno Temple as clients, is helping both newcomer and veteran talent navigate the prestige TV landscape, like Lily-Rose Depp, set for her breakout in HBO’s The Idol, and Kiefer Sutherland in the Paramount+ thriller Rabbit Hole.\n\nDavid Fox\n\nMyman Greenspan Fox Rosenberg Mobasser Younger & Light\n\nWestern State College of Law\n\nFox was behind one of the biggest deals of the year, the merger between Jason Blum’s Blumhouse and client James Wan’s Atomic Monster. “This is a bet on horror programming at a time when distributor appetite for the economics of genre content is at an all-time high,” he says. He also structured a unique deal between client Sugar23 and Anheuser-Busch, with the former to make branded content without the brand in the content. Elsewhere, David Robert Mitchell landed his next project with a green light at Warners and set up a sequel to his horror breakout, It Follows; Lauren Schmidt is expanding the Witcher universe at Netflix; and Christopher McQuarrie got two Oscar nominations for Top Gun: Maverick.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Pete Davidson, without the game, but my wife would say Harrison Ford.”\n\nI admire “Writers because they are in my opinion the most critical and least celebrated part of the process.”\n\nAn industry rule that’s made to be broken “‘Never trust anyone.’ I think that’s bullshit and exactly the opposite of reality. We could not do what we do on behalf of our clients if we weren’t able to be candid and thoughtful about the things we are seeking for our clients. Full-time combat mode is usually counterproductive.”\n\nMelissa Fox\n\nHansen Jacobson Teller Hoberman Newman Warren Richman Rush Kaller Gellman Meigs & Fox\n\nPenn Law\n\nFox cornered the Daily Show market after Trevor Noah’s surprise departure, negotiating guest-hosting stints for three of her clients, with Leslie Jones, Hasan Minhaj and Jordan Klepper each taking turns at the iconic desk. She also secured a new deal for Maya Erskine to create and star alongside Nicole Kidman in HBO’s The Perfect Nanny, handled a bidding war for Tim Robinson to create and star in The Chair Company for HBO, and closed a deal for Kate McKinnon to star in the Searchlight feature In the Blink of an Eye.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Sarah Silverman”\n\nAn industry rule that’s made to be broken “Studio policy.”\n\nJeff Frankel\n\nMcKuin Frankel Whitehead\n\nUCLA School of Law\n\nFrankel extended Ryan Condal’s overall with HBO, where he serves as showrunner of House of the Dragon; negotiated a pact for A-list TV star Milo Ventimiglia to executive produce and star in ABC’s The Company You Keep; brokered a deal for Sam Esmail’s latest, Metropolis, for Apple TV+ under his deal with UCP; teamed with partner Allen Vainshtein to negotiate an overall deal at FX for The Bear co-showrunner and executive producer Joanna Calo; handled an eight-figure extension of Lauren Iungerich’s overall pact at Netflix, where she created On My Block, Freeridge, and Boo, Bitch; and inked Matt Fogel’s deals to write Minions: The Rise of Gru and The Super Mario Bros. Movie under his overall at Illumination, the latter of which set the box office on fire and broke numerous records when it opened in early April.\n\nHow I start my workday “Excited.”\n\nHow I end my workday “More excited.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Optimism and hard work.”\n\nMatt Galsor\n\nGreenberg Glusker Fields Claman & Machtinger\n\nColumbia Law School\n\nGalsor describes his past year as “spectacular.” Two of his clients had movies break 10 figures globally: first Tom Cruise with Top Gun: Maverick ($1.49 billion) then James Cameron with Avatar: The Way of Water ($2.3 billion). “The reports of the death of theatrical have been greatly exaggerated,” quips Galsor, who also counts the Russo brothers (Citadel), Chris Hemsworth (Thor: Love and Thunder) and the Tolkien Estate (The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power) as clients.\n\nHow I start my workday “Plan innovative ways to relieve studios of their money.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … ” Like anywhere else – always protect your partners, to paraphrase Johnny Ola.”\n\nJonathan Gardner\n\nCohen Gardner\n\nUniversity of Virginia School of Law\n\nIn addition to homegrown clients like Ryan Coogler (whose Proximity Media produced Creed III, Stephen Curry: Underrated and the upcoming Ironheart) and Boots Riley (I’m a Virgo), Gardner also has developed a roster of international filmmakers, including Bong Joon Ho (Mickey 17) and Asghar Farhadi, for whom he negotiated his upcoming first English-language feature with Anonymous Content. Says Gardner, “To some extent, most of my clients are coming from the outside trying to figure out this beast called Hollywood.”\n\nHow I start my workday “Illy Coffee.”\n\nHow I end my workday “A glass of Austin Hope pinot noir.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Ray Liotta”\n\nBruce Gellman\n\nHansen Jacobson Teller Hoberman Newman Warren Richman Rush Kaller Gellman Meigs & Fox\n\nBerkeley Law\n\nAfter representing the creator of NBC’s This Is Us, Dan Fogelman, for 20-plus years, Gellman found it rewarding to watch the series finale end where it began: delivering “truly original and moving stories.” The attorney, who also represented writer Dave Andron (Snowfall) and Fleishman Is in Trouble EP Carl Beverly in their overall deals, says he’s seen an increase in short-term writer engagements, which creates a challenge to ensure “writers receive fair compensation for their work and flexibility to pursue their own development or other projects.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Know your stuff and be decent to everyone.”\n\nI admire “Assistants because their job is tough and often thankless. My assistant, Susan Burns, has worked with me for over 18 years and I could not do this without her.”\n\nHow I end my workday “A walk around the block with my wife and dogs.”\n\nGregg Gellman\n\nYorn Levine Barnes Krintzman Rubenstein Kohner Endlich & Gellman\n\nLoyola Law School\n\n“It’s always rewarding to see when cli- ents achieve thresholds of success,” says Gellman, whose writer client Akela Cooper hit the mark with her meme-inspiring horror hit M3GAN. Other successful clients on Gellman’s roster include Squid Game creators Hwang Dong-hyuk and Kim Ji-yeon; Kenya Barris; filmmaker Lulu Wang (The Farewell); She-Hulk: Attorney at Law writer Jessica Gao; and Emmy- nominated writer Gordon Smith (Better Call Saul).\n\nAn industry rule made to be broken “Streamers need to be more transparent. In streaming, there’s often a lack of transparency and little residual. At the end of the day, the talent and studio are effectively supposed to be partners, so there needs to be genuine transparency regarding the actual level of success of the applicable project. What’s more — there needs to be a true backend structure that reflects that actual level of success.”\n\nHow I start my workday “Prior to the pandemic, it would generally begin when I got to the office. Now, it seems to begin almost immediately from the moment I open my eyes in the morning.”\n\nRick Genow\n\nGoodman Genow Schenkman Smelkinson & Christopher\n\nHarvard Law School\n\n“Overnight, people’s lives change,” says Genow of the streamers’ expedited star-making ability. “To me, that has been the brightest spot in the past year.” Genow has seen this firsthand with clients like Chase Stokes and Drew Starkey (Outer Banks), Jacob Elordi (Euphoria) and Lukas Gage (The White Lotus, You). Another likely highlight is his work for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and their Archewell banner — while he won’t comment on the outfit, they had a big hit with their Netflix docuseries.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Harrison Ford — the way he plays his character in Shrinking.”\n\nAn industry rule that’s made to be broken “Television exclusivity, in all of its heinous forms.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Remember to laugh.”\n\nLev Ginsburg\n\nGinsburg Daniels Kallis\n\nUCLA School of Law\n\nAmong Ginsburg’s recent highlights are a “super busy” spell for client LaKeith Stanfield, who followed up an Oscar nom with top studio deals for Disney’s Haunted Mansion, as the title character in Legendary’s Book of Clarence for Sony, and appearing in the Apple TV+ series The Changeling, which he also executive produced. Client Timothée Chalamet wrapped the musical epic Wonka and the hotly anticipated Dune: Part Two from Denis Villeneuve while making a viral splash with a “Call Me” campaign for tech giant Apple TV+. He also reps Sara Hess, an executive producer of HBO’s big-budget House of the Dragon, who inked a landmark new overall deal there to shepherd the show and to develop her own projects.\n\nHow I start my workday “With an open mind.”\n\nHow I end my workday “With a run in the hills.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Dame Helen Mirren”\n\nOne industry rule that’s meant to be broken “It’s not really a rule, but most, ‘Can we get a call on the books?’ scheduling requests can be more quickly resolved by just … calling someone! Try it!”\n\nTamerlin Godley\n\nPaul Hastings\n\nUSC Gould School of Law\n\n“It’s very satisfying when I’m the first call,” says Godley, who specializes in sensitive investigations and significant business disputes. Some of her recent public work includes representing former business partners of the late Zappos CEO Tony Hsieh in disputes with his estate and advocating on behalf of NBCUniversal and Bravo Media in a discrimination lawsuit filed by NeNe Leakes, which the former Real Housewives of Atlanta star dropped in August. Otherwise, she notes, “I think a lot of the stuff I do is super interesting, if I could talk about it.”\n\nI admire “Ava DuVernay because she is a badass and uses her power for good. And, she is a fellow Bruin!”\n\nHow I start my workday “Prayer and Mediation.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Recording my time for the day! Gotta love the billable hour!”\n\nCarlos Goodman\n\nGoodman Genow Schenkman Smelkinson & Christopher\n\nUCLA School of Law\n\nQuentin Tarantino has announced his next and final film, The Movie Critic, while other A-list directors repped by Goodman have films waiting in the wings, including Steve McQueen (Blitz, Apple), Alex Garland (Civil War, A24) and Luca Guadagnino (Challengers, MGM). Goodman’s other clients include Christian Bale, Jake Gyllenhaal, The Last of Us creator Neil Druckmann, and Darren Aronofsky, whose The Whale served up a best actor Oscar win for star Brendan Fraser. Longtime client Gyllenhaal is shooting Presumed Innocent for Apple, and Bale had two films last year: Amsterdam and The Pale Blue Eye.\n\nHow I end my workday “I am compulsive about making sure I return all my calls for the day.”\n\nAn industry rule made to be broken “That precedents are not supposed to be broken.”\n\nMarissa Román Griffith\n\nAkin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld\n\nStanford Law School\n\nBringing together creatives and financial institutions is Griffith’s wheelhouse. She helped MRC with its Sundance sale of Fair Play to Netflix and set up Rian Johnson’s Peacock series Poker Face. “I really admire the creativity of Rian Johnson and have been fortunate to play a small part in several of his projects,” says Griffith, who also advised JPMorgan Chase on a credit facility for Amblin Partners that provided capital for Steven Spielberg’s The Fabelmans.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “J.Lo (a fellow Boricua).”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Take your work, but not yourself, seriously.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Snuggling my dogs.”\n\nDavid Grossman\n\nLoeb & Loeb\n\nUCLA School of Law\n\nGrossman’s docket reads like a streaming queue, with matters involving Stranger Things, Shahs of Sunset and Breakfast at Tiffany’s. High- profile clients include Paramount, NBCUniversal, Netflix, Lionsgate and Morgan Creek Productions — as well as Vanessa Bryant and the Bryant estate. As to recent trends, Grossman says the rise in arbitration and mediation following pandemic court delays has led to higher-caliber mediators and arbitrators who have a keen understanding of his clients’ issues.\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Longevity and trust. The longer you are here, the smaller this city becomes.”\n\nHow I end my workday “On my best days I’m home in time to see the sunset and have dinner with my hilarious teenage kids.”\n\nHarris Hartman\n\nSloane Offer Weber & Dern\n\nUniversity of Michigan Law School\n\nHartman is happiest when he sees clients’ long-gestating work finally make it to the screen: “That sort of meaningful personal connection is an unexpected thrill, not something I think many of my law school friends are lucky enough to find.” The lawyer advises clients like Jennifer Garner and Julia Garner on everything from new projects to long-running pro- motional and fashion partnerships. He negotiated Euphoria star Hunter Schafer’s Hunger Games prequel turn and Richard Madden’s return to prestige TV with Amazon’s Citadel.\n\nHow I start my workday “Go through all my overnight emails, check my calls for the day, check my to-do list, debate flaking on lunch.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Oh gosh, I think I get Stephen Colbert a lot?”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “I am hoping to figure this one out, but I believe it’s a perfect mixture of empathy and honesty.”\n\nMichael Hill\n\nCovington & Burling\n\nFordham University School of Law\n\nThere was a flurry of sports media deals over the past year, and Hill was at the center of all of them. From the NFL’s deal to bring NFL Sunday Ticket to YouTube (he repped the NFL), to Apple’s landmark agreement to become the global streaming home of Major League Soccer (he repped MLS), the nature of sports rights is changing. Notes Hill: “These deals may wind up being fairly precedential as other sports leagues and properties negotiate their media rights renewals over the coming years.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “I would trust only Cate Blanchett.”\n\nI admire “My colleagues in Covington’s entertainment and media practice because our culture of collaboration means there is always a subject matter expert ready and willing to help me navigate the most complex legal issues.”\n\nShawn Holley\n\nKinsella Weitzman Iser Kump Holley\n\nSouthwestern Law School\n\nMuch of Holley’s work in the past year was behind closed doors in an arbitration with MLB for client pitcher Trevor Bauer, who was suspended amid domestic violence and sexual assault allegations that ended in his reinstatement. Her work for Bauer continues with defamation suits, and she also is defending Shia LaBeouf in a civil sexual assault case brought by FKA Twigs and gearing up for Danny Masterson’s criminal retrial.\n\nHow I start my workday “Working out — either on my home Soulcycle bike or doing yoga with my husband on our living room floor.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Listening to a sleep story on the Calm app to distract my mind from ruminating on all the things I need to do on my cases.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Either Reese Witherspoon (I know it sounds crazy, but even her son saw the resemblance) or Emayatzy Corinealdi, the amazing actress who plays Jax, the character loosely based on me in the Hulu show Reasonable Doubt.”\n\nAndrew Hurwitz\n\nFrankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz\n\nGeorgetown Law\n\nJames Gunn’s ascension to co-head of DC Studios was perhaps the most surprising executive deal of the year — after all, how many studio heads are also A-list filmmakers who will be writing and directing for the studio they run? “We negotiated a pretty bespoke deal. I can say there isn’t a James Gunn-type deal floating around Warner Bros. for any prior exec,” says Hurwitz, who also negotiated for Andrew Millstein and Rob Baird to launch Annapurna Animation and for Baird to write animated films.\n\nHow I start my workday “If I’m not playing tennis, I walk the dog and do calls with New York and London.”\n\nAn industry rule that’s made to be broken “The industry has historically worked on the basis of precedence. When I started 20 years ago it was all about, ‘This is how you do it at Warner Bros.’ Now it’s, ‘This is the way we did it in 2022.’ In 2023 it can be completely different.”\n\nJeff Hynick\n\nJackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner & Klein\n\nSouthwestern Law School\n\nHynick guides one of Hollywood’s most in-demand young actors, Scream and Wednesday star Jenna Ortega, and most in-demand new filmmakers, Smile’s Parker Finn. After Smile earned $217 million at the box office on a $17 million budget, Hynick was in prime position to negotiate Finn’s first-look deal with Paramount. (Initially, Smile was going to be a streaming only movie, which would have made its value harder to gauge.) “When you have box office numbers, they are public and the number speak for themselves,” says Hynick, who also reps All Quiet on the Western Front filmmaker Edward Berger and is one of Nicole Kidman’s advisers.\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Knowing when and how to use leverage.”\n\nHow I start my workday “By making sure I’ve responded to all emails, calls, texts, and WhatsApp messages.”\n\nMatthew Johnson\n\nJohnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole\n\nNYU School of Law\n\n“The landscape is changing rapidly in terms of what the [streaming] platforms want to produce and are willing to spend on projects,” says Johnson, who recently secured Tyler Perry four-picture and two-picture deals at Amazon and Netflix, respectively. He also negotiated Oscar winner Jamie Foxx’s pact to headline Netflix’s Back in Action, Idris Elba’s return to Luther on Netflix and director Matthew Vaughn’s spy film Argylle for Apple.\n\nI admire “Jeffrey Katzenberg. He is relentless in his pursuit of growing his business and is equally committed to making the world a better place.”\n\nHow I start my workday “Reading The New York Times, Washington Post and the trades.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Organizing my priorities for the following day.”\n\nAdam Kaller\n\nHansen Jacobson Teller Hoberman Newman Warren Richman Rush Kaller Gellman Meigs & Fox\n\nWhittier Law School\n\nKaller continued his podcasting hot streak in 2022, representing clients like Emma Chamberlain in her multi-year exclusive deal with Spotify, and Crooked Media in its major ad sales and sponsorship deal with SiriusXM. Other clients include Steven Yeun, who’s playing a still-under-wraps character in Marvel Studios’ Thunderbolts, and How I Met Your Father showrunners Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger, who landed a seven-figure writing and producing deal with Amazon.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Tom Cruise”\n\nHow I end my workday “Ideally, I am off my screens an hour before bed, listening to a podcast or a book and preparing for optimal sleep (which I prioritized this year as much as exercise and diet).”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Unyielding determination, unbridled optimism and a point of view.”\n\nKelly Klaus\n\nMunger Tolles & Olsen\n\nStanford Law School\n\nKlaus is defending Disney in sprawling litigation accusing the company of illegally using VFX technology called MOVA Contour that is threatening profits from several of its blockbusters. He’s convinced the judge that profits from Guardians of the Galaxy and Deadpool are off-limits; they can’t be tied back to use of the tech, and secured dismissal of a related suit involving the Avengers films.\n\nHow I start my workday “Working out on my Peloton tread.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Peloton meditation.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Being able to bring a story to life.”\n\nDeborah Klein\n\nJackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner & Klein\n\nUSC Gould School of Law\n\nA-list dealmaker Klein works with some of the funniest people in Hollywood. Last year, she saw several deals closed for heavy-hitter clients such as Jim Carrey in Sonic the Hedgehog 3, Paul Rudd in the Ghostbusters sequel, Will Ferrell in You’re Cordially Invited and Vince Vaughn in Bad Monkey, while Samuel L. Jackson has Marvel’s upcoming Secret Invasion and his ongoing Capital One pact.\n\nA rule that’s made to be broken “The studio saying, ‘We do not ever give this.’ ”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is… “Not sure, but I will ask ChatGPT.”\n\nAlex Kohner\n\nYorn Levine Barnes Krintzman Rubenstein Kohner Endlich & Gellman\n\nLoyola Law School\n\nIn addition to representing the Duffer brothers and negotiating their deal to make a London stage play based on Stranger Things, his broad client base includes the literary trust of the late author David Foster Wallace and Goosebumps creator R.L Stine as well as NASCAR and the L.A. Lakers in their entertainment ventures.\n\nHow I end my workday “I try to follow my father’s advice and return every call and email by the end of each day.”\n\nI admire “Pete ‘Maverick’ Mitchell for simultaneously saving the world and the theatrical business.”\n\nTara Kole\n\nJohnson Shapiro Slewett & Kole\n\nHarvard Law School\n\n“There’s chaos, but that’s an opportunity for creativity and invention,” says Kole of the evolving entertainment landscape. She also says theatrical is bouncing back, and her clients made two of March’s biggest movies: Scream VI (Radio Silence, Melissa Barrera) and John Wick: Chapter 4 (Chad Stahelski). Elsewhere, she inked three deals for Zac Efron (The Iron Claw, A Family Affair and Ricky Stanicky) and Rolin Jones’ rebooted Interview With a Vampire for AMC.\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Hard work.”\n\nHow I start my workday “Emails.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Emails.”\n\nMichael Kump\n\nKinsella Weitzman Iser Kump Holley\n\nUniversity of Michigan Law School\n\nKump knows his way around free speech and says he’s seen an “increased attack on First Amendment rights” for public figures. On his docket: representing Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a defamation suit filed by her estranged half-sister (he recently won dismissal, but it’s likely not over) and defending Evan Rachel Wood in a defamation suit filed by Marilyn Manson.\n\nI admire “Ari Emanuel because throughout his career he has overcome all obstacles to create innovative companies that make our industry better.”\n\nHow I start my workday “I run in the dark.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Watching old rock videos on YouTube.”\n\nSusan Kay Leader\n\nWilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati\n\nUniversity of Virginia School of Law\n\nLeader successfully represented WME in its dispute with Virgin Fest 2020, convincing a judge that WME isn’t liable for its clients and that artists like Lizzo and Ellie Goulding shouldn’t have to return millions in deposits after the event was canceled because of COVID-19. She’s now rep- resenting Zuffa in a class action over UFC Fight Pass user data.\n\nHow I start my workday “Walking my dog while listening to a podcast. True crime is my favorite.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Binge-watching Netflix while clearing my inbox.”\n\nI admire “Jennifer Coolidge because she reminds me of a modern day Lucille Ball, pioneering a new trajectory for women in Hollywood.”\n\nMolly Lens\n\nO’Melveny & Myers\n\nUniversity of Michigan Law School\n\nBeing hired to defend Paramount in the Top Gun: Maverick copyright case has been a career highlight for Lens, who’s also on the front lines of high- profile copyright termination disputes involving several iconic Marvel characters. She notes, “Litigation in this space is complicated and will have implications far beyond those [termination] notices, as the case law is really developing in this space.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Ellen Pompeo. She exudes confidence and has a take-charge persona, plus we have similar eyes.”\n\nAn industry rule that’s made to be broken “‘Pay your dues.’ While it’s important to take time to learn and perfect your craft, it’s also vital to dream big and stretch yourself beyond others’ perceived limits of your current abilities.”\n\nAdam Levin\n\nMitchell Silberberg & Knupp\n\nUniversity of San Diego School of Law\n\nA go-to for entertainment labor and employment disputes, Levin in 2020 helped Fox and the producers of The Simpsons resolve a discrimination lawsuit brought by composer Alf Clausen, and advocated on behalf of Warner Bros. in a Big Bang Theory employment discrimination case that was dismissed in federal and state courts. He’s also representing The Voice’s production company in a suit brought by the American Federation of Musicians union.\n\nHow I start my workday “Smothered by my three little boys.”\n\nHow I end my workday “In a yoga class.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Jeff Goldblum”\n\nBianca Levin\n\nGang Tyre Ramer Brown & Passman\n\nYale Law School\n\nIn addition to negotiating for tried- and-true players (Dwayne Johnson starring in and producing Amazon’s Red One) and keeping clients in dependable franchises (Martin Lawrence’s deal for Bad Boys 4), Levin also helped Bella Ramsey hammer out a deal for HBO’s The Last of Us, which has earned acclaim and higher ratings than even House of the Dragon.\n\nHow I start my workday “Reviewing my to do list.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Reviewing my to do list.”\n\nJared Levine\n\nYorn Levine Barnes Krintzman Rubenstein Kohner Endlich & Gellman\n\nHarvard Law School\n\nIt’s fitting that Levine represents Bill Lawrence and his production company, Doozer, as Levine’s brother- in-law was one of the therapists who loosely inspired Harrison Ford’s character on Lawrence’s Apple TV+ series Shrinking. His roster of high-profile clients also includes Jordan Peele (and his Monkeypaw Productions), who inked a five-year exclusivity pact with Universal. He also signed Squid Game helmer Hwang Dong-hyuk and the hit show’s production company.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “George Clooney”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Having confidence in one’s point of view, being able to take criticism, and developing the ability to balance both.”\n\nJamie Mandelbaum\n\nJackoway Austen Tyerman Wertheimer Mandelbaum Morris Bernstein Trattner & Klein\n\nNYU School of Law\n\nFor Mandelbaum, the sweetest part of the job is exceeding client expectations. “There’s more to get than they can even imagine,” he says. His client list includes Succession’s Brian Cox and Nicholas Braun, The Last of Us executive producer Carolyn Strauss, actor Nick Offerman and Marvel star Danai Gurira. Amid industry concern that the studios’ appetite for overalls may be waning, Mandelbaum notes, “When they need you, they continue to make the big deals.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Live your best life and don’t compare yourself to others.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Stanley Tucci”\n\nStacy Marcus\n\nReed Smith\n\nSt. John’s University School of Law\n\nAdvertisers and ad agencies who work on SAG-AFTRA-affiliated projects have Marcus to thank for keeping labor peace last year when she again served as chief negotiator for the industry on the union’s\n\n$3 billion commercials pact. “We were able in 2022 to do really transformative things to the contract,” including implementing a new category for streaming use, says Marcus. “We were able to get this giant cargo ship pointed in the right direction.”\n\nA rule that’s made to be broken “All of them. The industry thrives by adding seats to the table and eliminating the scarcity complex. There is no single ‘right’ way, and someone else’s victory is not always your defeat.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Anna Kendrick”\n\nSteven Marenberg\n\nPaul Hastings\n\nUniversity of Chicago School of Law\n\nWhen COVID-19 safety protocols sparked lawsuits over exemption refusals and terminations, Disney turned to Marenberg to oversee all the litigation involving constitutional and employment law claims. He secured dismissal in November of some claims in a vaccine refusal discrimination suit filed by former 9-1-1 actor Rockmond Dunbar. He also rep- resents Pixar in a breach-of-contract case relating to Onward that raised novel issues concerning copyright preemption defenses.\n\nI admire “Bob Iger because of his consistently successful leadership of Disney throughout times of dislocation in the entertainment industry.”\n\nHow I start my workday “Responding to emails that came in overnight.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Responding to emails that came in throughout the day.”\n\nKevin Masuda\n\nGibson Dunn & Crutcher\n\nHarvard Law School\n\nSports and media stars alike have Masuda on speed dial. He has quarterbacked the NFL in creating joint-venture production studio Skydance Sports, helped agency Klutch Sports score a sale to UTA, cheered Rachel Maddow on in establishing her production company and coached FM Media in the purchase of a stake in the Russo brothers’ AGBO. Plus, he has teamed with LeBron James on various transactions.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Ke Huy Quan! Actually, I don’t need an Academy Award winner playing me, but I’m thrilled that Asian actors are being recognized in the industry.”\n\nHow I start my workday “Taking the dogs out so that they can do their ‘business.'”\n\nHow I end my workday “After a long day of dealing with my clients’ ‘business,’ I wind down with the same dogs, who help keep me grounded.”\n\nDavid Matlof\n\nHirsch Wallerstein Hayum Matlof & Fishman\n\nBerkeley Law\n\nAs filmmaker Joseph Kosinski’s Top Gun: Maverick was making history at the box office, Matlof helped strike a deal for Apple to acquire Kosinski’s untitled Formula One project starring Brad Pitt.

We try to eat dinner together as often as possible.”\n\nJoel McKuin\n\nMcKuin Frankel Whitehead\n\nHarvard Law School\n\nWith a client roster that includes Kristen Stewart, Stranger Things star Gaten Matarazzo and Fargo showrunner Noah Hawley, McKuin has a very full plate. He recently extended Stewart’s deal as spokesperson for Chanel after her Oscar nomination for Spencer.

When client Lala Kent took to Instagram and directed that all legal documents be sent to her lawyer, “Send it to Darrell” spread like wildfire. “I don’t think I could have paid for better marketing,” quips the lawyer, who also represents Moses Ingram, Taylor Tomlinson and Ludacris. Ahead of potential labor union strikes across the industry, his game plan is to accelerate the ability to do work (“Take everything we can!”) before deals come to a halt.\n\nI admire “Sidney Poitier because of his story, his struggle, his path. We lost a giant.”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Courtney B. Vance”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Longevity.

Nevertheless, it is public that Oncidi serves as the Grammy organization’s lead counsel for employment issues and recently helped conclude a dis- crimination and harassment case for NBCUniversal and Fandango Media.\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Not to take yourself too seriously and show some humanity! I’ve been listening to The Mike Wallace Interview on SiriusXM. It’s spectacular. The show was originally televised between 1957-60 and hasn’t been seen or heard again since then until now.

(And he makes even the most flawed characters compelling).”\n\nMarvin Putnam\n\nLatham & Watkins\n\nGeorgetown Law School\n\nThe work Putnam is most proud of is done quietly, but some cases do make headlines. Most recently, he signed on to defend Tom Brady, Gisele Bündchen and Larry David in the lawsuit over their endorsements of the crypto exchange FTX. It’s part of a larger story about the new publicity-related challenges famous people face in a digital age. Says Putnam, “There’s a need to reassess and relook at what it means to have publicity rights in this age of social media, and how do you protect them?”\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Quentin Tarantino because he looks like me, or I look like him.”\n\nI admire “My wife Keri Putnam.

Gidget goes to law school!’ The nickname stuck for most of my first year of law school, so I’ve always felt a certain affinity for her.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “There’s no substitute for hard work. There isn’t one ‘key’ that will guarantee success — a lot of people who work very hard may not achieve their goals — but when I look around at the people who have been successful, the one trait that virtually all of them share is that they work hard and strive to do their best work every time, whatever their particular job may be.”\n\nNeema Sahni\n\nCovington & Burling\n\nHarvard Law School\n\nSahni’s team notched a big win for the NFL and 31 of its member clubs, defeating a lawsuit over the Chargers’ relocation from San Diego to Los Angeles.

It not only makes for a more fulfilling professional experience, but it also pays dividends in an industry that can be relationship-driven.”\n\nMichael Schenkman\n\nGoodman Genow Schenkman Smelkinson & Christopher\n\nBerkeley Law\n\nSchenkman’s year was marked by striking a balance between his practice and giving back. He handled Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy’s Amazon overall, Oppenheimer deals for Christopher Nolan and Emma Thomas, Javier Bardem’s deal for Dune: Part Two and Michael Waldron’s new overall at Disney/ Marvel — while also hitting $10 million raised for the GOFARR Fund at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles.\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Not taking yourself too seriously.”\n\nHow I start my workday “Peloton.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Pickleball.”\n\nP.J.

Clients Regé-Jean Page and Glen Powell will team up to produce and star in the Butch & Sundance series for Amazon, and Michael B. Jordan bought an owner- ship stake in Premier League team AFC Bournemouth. Slewett says it’s fun having ambitious entrepreneurial clients because they throw you deals “outside your strike zone.”\n\nA rule that’s made to be broken “Never work on a vacation.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Staying positive.”\n\nJason Sloane\n\nSloane Offer Weber & Dern\n\nUCLA School of Law\n\nSloane thought his days of negotiating deals for Hugh Jackman to play Wolverine ended with Logan, but “it was a nice surprise” to make one more as the actor reprises his role in Deadpool 3. The lawyer, who in 2022 celebrated his 35th year of practicing and his firm’s 20th anniversary, also enjoyed building out the Terminal List universe for executive producer Chris Pratt, with deals for season two of the original series and a spinoff.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Harry Styles”\n\nMitch Smelkinson\n\nGoodman Genow Schenkman Smelkinson & Christopher\n\nLoyola Law School\n\nSeveral of Smelkinson’s clients are prioritizing projects based on quality material that’s earning them acclaim instead of chasing a big blockbuster payday. Client Hong Chau was nominated for an Oscar for best supporting actress for The Whale a year after fellow client Sian Heder’s CODA won the Oscar for best picture and Anthony Hopkins won best actor for The Father. Jesse Tyler Ferguson took a break from TV to star in Broadway’s Take Me Out, for which he won a Tony, and Oscar Isaac earned an Emmy nomination for HBO’s Scenes From a Marriage.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “Is in need of new representation.”\n\nHow I end my workday “Wishing my teenage daughters good night to their annoyance while I interrupt their precious FaceTiming with friends.”\n\nCheryl Snow\n\nGang Tyre Ramer Brown & Passman\n\nUCLA School of Law\n\nClient Kerry Condon’s Oscar nod for The Banshees of Inisherin was the cherry on top of Snow’s past year. The lawyer, whose roster includes Melissa Rauch (Night Court), Busy Philipps (Girls5Eva), Daniel Dae Kim (Butterfly) and Robert Zemeckis (Here), also was busy with negotiations for Ben Stiller, who landed two major commercial deals (Pepsi and PlayStation) along with his directing gig for Apple TV+’s Severance.\n\nA rule that’s made to be broken “1 p.m. lunches; a 12:30 seating is underrated.”\n\nHow I start my workday “Aspirationally, meditating; realistically, answering emails from bed.”\n\nOrin Snyder\n\nGibson Dunn & Crutcher\n\nPenn Law\n\nSnyder continues to defend AMC Network in long-running litigation over profits from The Walking Dead.

He also advises Jeremy Renner, Greta Gerwig and Orlando Bloom.\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Developing and maintaining strong relationships. The entertainment industry is not a one-transaction town. We’re constantly working across the table from people. It’s important that the relationship with the person on the other end is strong.”\n\nI admire “My father, Ken Suddleson, a longtime entertainment attorney. He set an incredible example for me growing up of the importance of maintaining your integrity.”\n\nMatthew Thompson\n\nSidley Austin\n\nUC College of the Law, San Francisco\n\nComedy became serious business for Thompson when Conan O’Brien’s Team Coco podcast company sold to SiriusXM for $150 million in May. The lawyer also advised Mark Burnett in his dealings with MGM after its $8.45 billion sale to Amazon, and Ben Affleck and Matt Damon in their joint venture with Redbird to launch Artists Equity ahead of their movie Air launching on Amazon Prime Video.

The insight of a specialist in complex and strategic transactions focused around technology. Traxler worked with Abry Partners on its $100 million investment in Hartbeat and Cosm on its NBA immersive viewing partner- ship. On the music side, Traxler supported MNRK on the Death Row Records sale to Snoop, Blackstone on its deal with Hipgnosis and the latter’s deals for the two Justins’ catalogs.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “I would have thought Zach Galifianakis, but my wife says Bradley Cooper.”\n\nHow I start my workday “Meditating.”\n\nSteve Warren\n\nHansen Jacobson Teller Hoberman Newman Warren Richman Rush Kaller Gellman Meigs & Fox\n\nHarvard Law School\n\nThe highly anticipated Killers of the Flower Moon, which will premiere at Cannes, is led and directed by Warren’s clients Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese. Meanwhile, Millie Bobby Brown just wrapped big- ticket Netflix film The Electric State, while Jessica Chastain is performing on Broadway in A Doll’s House and will lead the Apple TV+ limited series The Savant. The success of The Drew Barrymore Show is another highlight for Warren, who says, “Drew has taken that format and is breathing new life into it.” After winning two Emmys for We’re Here, Warren and his partner Johnnie Ingram are about to launch their second show: An HBO Max rom-doc called Swiping America, which premieres in June.\n\nThe actor who’d play me “My client Rupert Friend, who does an amazingly accurate and hilarious impression of me.”\n\nDavid Weber\n\nSloane Offer Weber & Dern\n\nUSC Gould School of Law\n\nRyan Reynolds will begin shooting Deadpool 3 in the next two months, while Weber also sealed a deal for Joaquin Phoenix to return to DC in Joker: Folie à Deux. He has five clients in Christopher Nolan’s Oppenheimer — Cillian Murphy, Emily Blunt, Rami Malek, Josh Hartnett and Dane DeHaan — while Andrew Garfield is eyeing Guillermo del Toro’s Frankenstein. Weber also signed Austin Butler just before Elvis bowed at last year’s Cannes. Says Weber, “He was obviously a hotly contested client to try to sign, so it is very exciting.” And James Gray has just closed a deal to direct the Depression-era ghost story Ezekiel Moss for Focus Features.\n\nHow I start my workday “With the prayer that nothing bad happened overnight and a glass of water … Then I check my iPhone.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “To trust yourself to understand your role in the job at hand and to consciously try to deal respectfully with everyone without sacrificing your position or principles.”\n\nMichael Weinsten\n\nLavely & Singer\n\nGW Law\n\nWhen Paris Hilton was sued for copyright infringement over posting a photo of herself online, Weinsten took the offensive.

He represents the two biggest female franchise stars of all time, Zoe Saldaña and Scarlett Johansson, with the former signing a 10-figure overall deal with Skydance while the latter is a star-slash-producer on Apple’s big-budget space race movie Project Artemis. Yorn’s roster also includes Jason Sudeikis, Jonah Hill and Squid Game creator Hwang Dong-hyuk. The attorney, who has his finger on the pulse of Gen Z thanks to his daughter Sammi Yorn, who works at Vogue, also inked deals for TikTok stars Charli D’Amelio and Alix Earle. Yorn oversaw his firm’s move into a new office space that has generated buzz for being boldly forward-looking but also, along with his colleagues, mourned the loss of fellow partner Ashley Nissenberg.\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “Listening deeply to others.

He also continues to advise top firm clients including Dick Wolf and Ed Harris.\n\nI admire “Arnold Schwarzenegger. I think he might be arguably the most successful person in modern history. What I mean by that is: I defy you to find somebody who has reached the absolute pinnacle in three completely competitive careers: The greatest bodybuilder of all time, arguably the biggest action movie star of all time, and then the Governor of California. Any one of those three things is a lifetime of achievement for any normal human being. And most people never come anywhere close to the pinnacle of any of those three disciplines.”\n\nThe key to success in Hollywood is … “I think everyone needs to have core competency. You have to be smart, organized, and you have to be motivated. But I think what differentiates people and gives some people a real leg-up is a fantastic personality.”\n\nSusan Zuckerman Williams\n\nPaul Hastings\n\nUSC Gould School of Law\n\nZuckerman Williams is a go-to when you need a creative problem-solver for an especially complex capital transaction.
