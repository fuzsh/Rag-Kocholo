        "text": "The NBA announced the finalists for its seven season-long individual awards Sunday, featuring Nikola Jokić nominated for his third MVP trophy in four seasons.\n\nThe league also announced the finalists in the Rookie of the Year, Defensive Player of the Year, Sixth Man of the Year, Most Improved Player, Coach of the Year and Clutch Player of the Year races.\n\nJokić won consecutive MVP awards in 2021 and 2022 before a second-place finish to Joel Embiid last season. He ended the 2022-23 season instead with his first NBA championship and Finals MVP. Now he's the favorite to win his third MVP trophy, which would further cement his legacy among the game's all-time greats.\n\nIf he prevails, Jokić would become the ninth player in league history to secure three or more MVP awards, joining Bill Russell, Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Moses Malone, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan and LeBron James.\n\nThe awards this season will be the first under a new set of rules requiring players to play a minimum of 65 games to be eligible, meaning Embiid (39 games) was ruled out for his second MVP long before the season was over.\n\nSan Antonio Spurs center Victor Wembanyama is a finalist for two awards — Rookie of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nOklahoma City Thunder guard Shai Gilgeous-Alexander was also nominated for two awards as a finalist for MVP and Clutch Player of the Year.\n\nMVP finalists\n\nNikola Jokić, center, Denver Nuggets\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander, guard, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nLuka Dončić, guard, Dallas Mavericks\n\nRookie of the Year\n\nVictor Wembanyama, center, San Antonio Spurs\n\nChet Holmgren, center, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nBrandon Miller, forward, Charlotte Hornets\n\nDefensive Player of the Year\n\nRudy Gobert, center, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nVictor Wembanyama, center, San Antonio Spurs\n\nBam Adebayo, center, Miami Heat\n\nSixth Man of the Year\n\nMalik Monk, guard, Sacramento Kings\n\nNaz Reid, center, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nBobby Portis, forward, Milwaukee Bucks\n\nMost Improved Player\n\nTyrese Maxey, guard, Philadelphia 76ers\n\nAlperen Şengün, center, Houston Rockets\n\nCoby White, guard, Chicago Bulls\n\nCoach of the Year\n\nMark Daigneault, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\nChris Finch, Minnesota Timberwolves\n\nJamahl Mosley, Orlando Magic\n\nClutch Player of the Year"
