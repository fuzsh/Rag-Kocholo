        "text": "The Ticket’s Dunham and Miller have been morning drive sports talk staples in Dallas-Fort Worth since October 1995. That’s almost 16 years.\n\nIn the radio business, that’s a couple of lifetimes. Their show actually debuted in the 2-5 p.m. time slot when the station went on the air in January 1994 but was shuffled to the more prestigious morning drive that had been the haunt of the ratings-challenged Skip Bayless.\n\nWhen the March radio ratings are released next week, their show, which also features the talents of Gordon Keith, should, as usual, have the largest audience in all of sports talk.\n\nGeorge Dunham and Craig Miller met as freshmen on the first day of the 1983 fall semester at the University of North Texas and have been linked ever since.\n\nTwice, they have been nominated for the prestigious Marconi Award, presented annually to national major market radio personalities.\n\nAs they celebrate another anniversary of their joint graduation from UNT, we thought it would be a good time to catch up with “The Gentle Musers” in separate interviews.\n\nIn the interest of equal time, Hot Air decided to allow Miller to answer questions first. Here are Miller and Dunham on the Hot Seat.\n\nDo you recall the moment you first laid eyes on each other?\n\nCM: It was in an English class freshman year at North Texas. It was a Monday morning. I remember the teacher looked like the composer Paul Williams, except she was a she.\n\nGD: It was an 8 a.m. class on the first day of school. He was on the other side of the room cracking jokes. On the second day the class met, I moved across the room and said, “I want to sit here. I think it will be more fun.”\n\nWhat was the most annoying thing your partner did the three years you lived together in college?\n\nCM: It’s probably the same thing he would say about me. He contributed excessive gas after Mexican food dinners.\n\nGD: There was a definite lack of sleep, because we would spend so much time listening to the radio late at night. We spent much too much time goofing off. I blame Craig for all of it.\n\nWhy Dunham and Miller, not Miller and Dunham?\n\nCM: He was very insistent his name come first. When he pulled out a gun, I gave in.\n\nGD: We had a psychology class together, and the professor always took the roll alphabetically except when it got to me. For some reason he’d go Dunham? Miller? I guess it just stuck in our minds.\n\nWhere did the \"Gentle Musers\" nickname come from?\n\nCM: There is a guy who calls himself “Rick the King of All P1s.” When we first started at the Ticket, The Hardline was on from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and we followed them. Rick would fax The Hardline all the time and mention our show sounded like gentle musing after them. At some point, Mike Rhyner began ending The Hardline reminding listeners to “Stay hard and stay tuned for the gentle musings of Dunham and Miller.”\n\nGD: Credit Rhyner’s ability to coin a phrase.\n\nWhat's the one thing people would be most surprised to learn about your partner?\n\nCM: I think it would be that George has a sweet 18-foot jump shot.\n\nGD: Craig is a real giving person. He is one of the more generous people I know. He does so much for charity with his time and money without looking for any attention.\n\nWhat has been the most memorable moment in the show's history?\n\nCM: It was the first or second year and we were playing in the Colonial Media Tournament while the show was on the air. We were live on the sixteenth tee box when we almost got killed by a giant bolt of lightning. I guess that means the show peaked early in its run.\n\nGD: It has to be Sept. 11. We were on the air and didn’t know what to do. How should we steer the show? I think we were talking to Jerry Jones at the time. It was two days after the Cowboys opened the 2001 season losing to Tampa Bay, and Quincy Carter had been awful. We were talking to Jerry about his quarterback when we decided to cut him short and talk about the real world.\n\nAnd the worst day in show history?\n\nCM: The day we got moved to the morning shift. We realized we might never get a good night’s sleep again.\n\nGD: Any of the times we’ve lost focus and argued over something trivial. There have been a few of those, and that makes us both always feel awful.\n\nIf an edict came down saying you had to work with a different Ticket partner for one year, whom would you choose?\n\nCM: I probably could work with any of the guys and really enjoy it. But I’d have to say Rick Arnett, because it has always been my dream to do a golf show.\n\nGD: I could work with any of my Ticket brothers, but I would say Bob Sturm. Bob is a sports genius and funnier than he thinks.\n\nWhat is the most important thing your partner brings to the show?\n\nCM: George is very funny and can do a lot of great voices, but he also has a big personality that you need on the air.\n\nGD: Craig is very organized and has the ability to smoothly translate his thoughts on the air. We kind of co-drive the show, but he is kind of the captain.\n\nWhen was the last time you and your wives went out to dinner as a foursome?\n\nCM: We were pretty good about going out every holiday season. We missed it last Christmas. I guess we have to go out twice this year.\n\nGD: The one thing that has changed most over the years is the time we spend together. We’ve probably spent more quality time with each other than we have with our wives. We’re on 4 1/2 hours a day. Now, just about all the time we spend together is what everybody hears on the air.\n\nMavericks talk\n\nLocal television ratings rose steadily during the four-game sweep of the Lakers. Meanwhile in Los Angeles, ratings plummeted as the series wore on.\n\nSunday’s series-ending blowout earned a 16.9 rating (430,882 homes) for WFAA (Channel 8). That followed the 16.6 (423,234) for Friday’s Game 3 on ESPN. The series opened with an 11.1 (283,006) and climbed for Game 2 to 15.0 (382,440). In Los Angeles, the series peaked at 15.1 for Game 2 and dropped to 11.1 for Sunday’s finale. Overall, the series averaged a 14.9 rating in Dallas-Fort Worth and 13.3 in LA.\n\nThe Western Conference finals belong to ESPN. That means Mike Breen, Mark Jackson and Jeff Van Gundy courtside, with Stuart Scott, Michael Wilbon, Jon Barry and Magic Johnson in the studio. TNT owns the rights to the Heat-Bulls Eastern Conference finals, with Marv Albert, Steve Kerr and Reggie Miller courtside. Ernie Johnson, Kenny Smith and Charles Barkley will be in the studio, with guest appearances from Kevin McHale and Chris Webber.\n\nAround the Horn\n\nThe frenetic Gus Johnson has left CBS, where he called NFL and NCAA Tournament games, and has landed at Fox, where he will be the voice of the network’s expanded college football coverage. Johnson should have plenty of Big 12 games on his schedule. He’ll be paired with analyst Charles Davis. … Fox is moving its Saturday baseball game of the week to prime time for the next three weeks. It could be a precursor to an eventual permanent move. It opens Saturday with the Boston Red Sox-New York Yankees as its lead game. Shocking? I think not. … Mike Tirico, Brent Musburger, Bob Uecker and Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe will be inducted in the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Hall of Fame on Monday in Salisbury, N.C. … NFL Network is counting down the Top 100 players currently on NFL rosters. The Packers have the most players with seven. Tied for second with six are the Baltimore Ravens, the Indianapolis Colts and, yup, the Cowboys. I can’t figure it either."
