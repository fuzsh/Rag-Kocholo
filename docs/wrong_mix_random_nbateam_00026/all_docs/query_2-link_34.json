        "text": "FilmNation Entertainment and Bleecker Street will partner on Treasure, the new drama from German director Julia von Heinz (And Tomorrow the Entire World) starring Lena Dunham and Stephen Fry as father and daughter. The two companies will co-distribute the film together in the U.S. and jointly handle worldwide sales.\n\nSet in the 1990s, Treasure is adapted from Lily Brett’s best-selling autobiographical novel Too Many Men. Dunham plays Ruth, a neurotic businesswoman who takes her father Edek (Fry), a charmingly stubborn Holocaust survivor, on a road trip through Poland to make sense of her family’s past. Zbigniew Zamachowski (Three Colors franchise) co-stars. Treasure will have its world premiere as a Berlinale Special screening at the Berlin Film Festival next month and FilmNation and Bleecker will kick off sales talk with international buyers at Berlin’s European Film Market.\n\nVon Heinz is best known for her political drama And Tomorrow the Entire World, which screened in Toronto and Venice in 2020 and was Germany’s official Oscar contender. She adapted Brett’s novel for the screen together with her And Tomorrow the Entire World co-writer John Quester.\n\nFilmNation and Bleecker Street most recently partnered on Diane Paulus and Brett Sullivan’s Waitress: The Musical, but Treasure will be the first film they will jointly release in the U.S..\n\nThe film is produced by Fabian Gasmia and Von Heinz under their Seven Elephants banner, and Dunham under her Good Things Going banner. FilmNation’s Glen Basner and Ben Browning and Bleecker Street’s Andrew Karpen and Kent Sanderson are executive producers, together with Good Thing Going’s Michael Cohen.\n\nDunham is represented by CAA, ID Public Relations, and Hansen, Jacobson, Teller, Hoberman, Newman, Warren, Richman, Rush, Kaller, Gellman, Meigs & Fox. Fry is represented by CAA in the US and Hamilton Hodell in the UK. von Heinz is represented by CAA in the US and Players Agentur Management in Germany."
