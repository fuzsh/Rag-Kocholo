        "text": "Biography\n\nSteve Dunham is a veterinary graduate with over 20 years research experience on virus diseases in animal hosts. His postdoctoral research initially concentrated on the development of lentiviral vaccines in the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) model, working with DNA and prime-boost vaccines. Steve was appointed as Lecturer in Veterinary Virology at Glasgow University 2003, subsequently taking an Associate Professor post at Nottingham University Veterinary School in 2008. His research interests centre largely around viruses and their interaction with hosts, with a particular focus on avian influenza viruses. Current research aims to unpick the molecular mechanisms that underpin the differing responses between susceptible and resistant avian hosts. Steve also works on a number of other projects within the University of Nottinghamâ€™s One Virology research group, including the use of pseudotype viruses for disease surveillance and plant expression for the development of vaccines and diagnostic assays."
