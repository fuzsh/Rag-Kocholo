        "text": "Mike Vaccaro has been the lead sports columnist for the New York Post since November 2002. In that time he has written about every important sporting event and sports figure in New York City and covered 18 Super Bowls, 12 World Series, 10 Final Fours and 10 BCS Championship Games. He has been recognized three times as New York Sportswriter of the Year by the National Sports Media Association and was recognized in 2017 by the New York Press Club for his deadline work. A 1989 graduate of St. Bonaventure University, Vaccaro previously worked at newspapers in Newark, Kansas City, Middletown, N.Y., Fayetteville, Ark., and Olean, N.Y. He is the author of three books: “Emperors and Idiots,” about the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry; “1941: the Greatest Year in Sports;” and “The First Fall Classic,” about the 1912 World Series. He also makes frequent television and radio appearances. A native of West Hempstead, N.Y., Vaccaro now makes his home in Hillsdale, N.J. with his wife, Leigh, and two rambunctious terriers: a 12-pound Westy named Fiona and Desmond, a 12,000-pound (or so it seems) Airedale. He is a terrible golfer and undefeated in all games involving “Godfather” trivia."
