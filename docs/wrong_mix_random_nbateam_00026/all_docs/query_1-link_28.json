        "text": "STOCKTON — Tim Dunham has accomplished much as a basketball player, coach and pastor of the church he currently runs. But many area sports fans remember Dunham for one thing.\n\nOn December 23, 1982 in Honolulu, Dunham, a graduate of Stagg High, was a member of the Chaminade University men’s basketball team that upset previously top-ranked Virginia in a game that is considered one of the biggest upsets in NCAA history.\n\n“For something that happened way back (in 1982), that’s the one thing that people bring up,” said Dunham, who will be inducted into the Stockton Athletic Hall of Fame today at its 54th annual banquet at the Stockton Memorial Civic Auditorium. “But I’m excited and blessed, and I thank God for this opportunity.”\n\nDoors open at 5 p.m. with a social hour, and the banquet begins at 6:30 p.m. Tickets are $45 and available at the door.\n\nDunham and six other individuals will be inducted into the hall – David Lozano (football/basketball/baseball), Patrick Matthews (football/wrestling/distance running), Prentice McCray Jr. (football/basketball/baseball/track and field), Chuck Swimley (baseball/football), Steve Towne (football player/coach), and the late Jesus “Sue” Valverde (football/basketball/baseball), who will receive the 2018 memorial award.\n\nThe teams being honored are the 2011-2014 Bella Bocce team and the 1967-1968 Edison High boys basketball team.\n\nAt Stagg, Dunham averaged 18.8 points per game in league and 18.5 points for the season as the 1978-79 Delta Kings went 22-8. Dunham was a first-team all-league in the San Joaquin Athletic Association that season.\n\nVirginia, with star Ralph Sampson, was ranked No. 1 in the country and Chaminade was unranked. Dunham played an intregal part in the 77-72 win, and one highlight was a dunk over the towering Sampson.\n\nAfter Chaminade, Dunham was drafted by the Portland Trail Blazers in 1985, but played in the Continental Basketball Association for three seasons, then played in Turkey.\n\nIn 1988, he returned to Stagg as its varsity boys coach and was there until 1994, guiding the Delta Kings to two SJAA championships. Dunham later coached at Brookside Christian from 2004-2007, leading the Knights to two league titles during his tenure. Currently, Dunham is the pastor at God’s Throne Baptist Church in Stockton.\n\nDavid Lozano\n\nLozano is one of seven brothers and sisters who were inducted as the Frank and Ramona Lozano family into the Stockton Athletic Hall of Fame in 1990 and into the St. Mary’s High Hall of Fame in 1999. The Lozanos are also in the Stockton Mexican Sports Hall of Fame.\n\nDavid Lozano was a letterman in football, basketball and baseball at St. Mary’s, and as a senior quarterback in 1972, he led the Rams to a 9-0 unbeaten record. In basketball, he was an all-league and all-city selection, and was the Valley Oak League’s player of the year in baseball as a senior. Lozano went on to play in the minors with the New York Mets organization for six seasons.\n\nLozano later coached baseball in Little League, Babe Ruth, and the Karl Ross Post 16 American Legion team. In 2011, Lozano was inducted as an individual into the Stockton Mexican Sports Hall of Fame and St. Mary’s High Hall of Fame.\n\nPatrick Matthews\n\nMatthews was a varsity letterman in football at Lincoln High, and also wrestled and participated in track. He also played football and wrestled at Delta College, then played wide receiver at the University of the Pacific, and was drafted in 1971 by the NFL’s Green Bay Packers.\n\nLater, Matthews took up running, participating in the Modesto Marathon and also qualified for the Boston Marathon. He also is an accomplished triathlete.\n\nPrentice McCray Jr.\n\nMcCray was a four-sport athlete at Edison High, graduating in 1996 and attended Arizona State on a football scholarship. He was drafted twice by the New York Yankees organization, but decided to pursue a pro football career.\n\nMcCray was an eighth-round draft pick in 1973 by the Detroit Lions. McCray ultimately signed with the New England Patriots in 1974. In 1976, McCray intercepted New York Jets quarterback Joe Namath twice in a game and returned them both for touchdowns. McCray played for New England until 1980, but re-signed with Detroit.\n\nMcCray was inducted in the African American Athletes Hall of Fame of Stockton in 1988.\n\nChuck Swimley\n\nSwimley, a 1960 Stagg High graduate, coached the Delta Kings in baseball from 1973 to 1978, where his teams won the SJAA and Sac-Joaquin Championships in 1976, and the SJAA title in 1978. Swimley was SJAA coach of the year in 1977 and 1978, and also coached the Northern California State All-Star team.\n\nSwimley was also the varsity football coach at Stagg, where the Delta Kings won the SJAA title with an 83 record in 1978. The Delta Kings also won the SJAA in 1979 under Swimley, who was SJAA coach of the year in 1978 and co-coach of the year in 1979.\n\nSteve Towne\n\nTowne, who grew up in Long Beach, came to Pacific in 1973 and played quarterback. In 1973 he came off the bench to lead Pacific to victory in the Tigers’ last four games. In 1974, he started all games and finished with a 10-4 record.\n\nTowne coached at Cal State Fullerton briefly then returned to Pacific as its quarterbacks and running backs coach until 1988, when he became head coach at St. Mary’s High. He led the Rams to three SJAA league championships and led St. Mary’s to the Sac-Joaquin Section playoffs eight times. Towne also coached track and field at St. Mary’s.\n\nJesus “Sue” Valverde\n\nValverde, who passed away at age 48 in 1959, was an 11-varsity letterman from 1926 to 1930 at St. Mary’s High, and was considered one of the top 10 athletes in his era at St. Mary’s. He played football, basketball and baseball at St. Mary’s, and his basketball team played for the national championship in Chicago.\n\nValverde signed a pro baseball contract with the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League, but later went to work to support his family. He did play recreational softball, and was a youth coach.\n\n2011-2014 Bella Bocce: The local all-women’s team, representing the Italian Athletic Club of Stockton, competed in the U.S. National Bocce Championships in Livermore in 2011, and won the open A championship in a field that included men's A teams. It also won the USBF’s national women’s Punto Raffa Volo championship in Illinois in 2012, and also took part in the World Games in China in 2014 and the North American championship in Windsor, Canada.\n\n1967-68 Edison High boys basketball team: This team was called by some “Stockton’s greatest high school basketball team” at that time. Under first-year coach John Nichols, the Vikings won their second consecutive Central California Conference championship with a 19-1 record.\n\nContact reporter Tony Acosta at (209) 546-8292 or tacosta@recordnet.com"
