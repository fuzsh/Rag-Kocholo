        "text": "Commencement Awards Recognize Outstanding 2022 Graduates\n\nEach year, during the Commencement Ceremony, four special awards recognize graduating seniors who have not only demonstrated excellence in academics, athletics and the arts, but have done so in a way that exemplifies the mission of The Dunham School.\n\nCongratulations to these outstanding Â graduates of the Class of 2022: Caroline Latuso, â22, Crimson and Silver Award; Hailey Malik â22, Servant's Heart Award; Kennedy Morgan â22, Katharine O. Dunham Award; and John Walker McDonald â22, Hall of Fame Award.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nCrimson & Silver Award: Caroline Latuso â22\n\nThe 2022 Crimson and Silver Award, the highest honor awarded to a Dunham senior, was presented to Caroline Latuso â22 by Head of School Steve Eagleton.\n\nThe recipient of the Crimson and Silver Award is chosen by the faculty as the senior who has consistently exemplified the love of Christ with both peers and faculty and whose life has clearly reflected a desire to honor God and acknowledge Him in all his/her ways.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nServantâs Heart Award: Hailey Malik â22\n\nFostering an attitude of service to others is a very important part of educating the mind and the heart, taking our Lord Jesus Christ as the ultimate role model, who did not come to be served, but to serve.â\n\nThe Servantâs Heart Award honors that senior whose high school career has clearly displayed an attitude of serving othersâat school, at church, and in the community. The recipient possesses a willing hand and a servantâs heart, and has performed numerous selfless acts of willing and cheerful service, not for self but for the greater glory of God.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nKatherine O. Dunham Award for Citizenship: Kennedy Morgan â22\n\nThe Dunham School Honor Code forms the basis for all conduct policies and is the primary building block of the school community. We believe that each student should have a strong sense of personal honor and integrity and that these character qualities will be vital assets throughout life.\n\nIn recognition of the important role that the Honor Code plays in the life of our school and that of our students, this award is given to the senior whose conduct and character exemplify The Dunham School Honor Code.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\nâHall of Fame Award: John Walker McDonald â22\n\nChosen by the faculty, the Hall of Fame Award is presented each year to the senior who has brought the greatest positive community recognition to The Dunham School during the course of his or her high school career.\n\nWhile pursuing his passion for track and field and serving the school as Service Prefect, John Walker maintained a 4.11 grade point average. Competing in cross country, indoor track and outdoor track, he has earned 11 varsity letters and won 8 state titles. This year, John Walker and cross country teammates made Dunham history by winning the schoolâs first Cross Country State Team Championship.\n\nRecently, John Walker was a double 2A individual State Champion, winning the 1600m and 3200m titles. He has earned All Metro, All State and All Academic honors, served as team captain, was named team MVP multiple times during his high school career. Â This fall, this talented student will continue his academic and athletic pursuits at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette.\n\nThis graduate is an incredible athlete, yet his true character is shown through the compassion he has for his family, friends and teammates. Running has been his platform to honor God, something he will continue to do as he competes on the college level.\n\nâ\n\nâ\n\n(2022 photos by Eye Wander Photo)"
