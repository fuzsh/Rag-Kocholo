        "text": "Lena Dunham has exited the Polly Pocket movie.\n\nThe Girls alum revealed in a new interview that she is no longer working on the movie script for the film based on the Mattel toy.\n\nI’m going to tell you something here that I haven’t told anyone:\n\n“I’m not going to make the Polly Pocket movie,” she said in an interview with The New Yorker. “I wrote a script, and I was working on it for three years. But I remember someone once said to me about Nancy Meyers: the thing that’s the most amazing about her is that the movie she makes or the movie she would be making with or without a studio, with or without notes—that somehow her taste manages to intersect perfectly with what the world wants.”\n\nShe continued, “What a f***ing gift that is. And Nora Ephron, too, who was such a mentor to me, but always said, ‘Go be weird. Don’t kowtow to anyone.”’And I think Greta [Gerwig] managed this incredible feat [with Barbie], which was to make this thing that was literally candy to so many different kinds of people and was perfectly and divinely Greta.”\n\n“I felt like, unless I can do it that way, I’m not going to do it. I don’t think I have that in me,” she explained. “I feel like the next movie I make needs to feel like a movie that I absolutely have to make. No one but me could make it. And I did think other people could make Polly Pocket.”"
