        "text": "By Sean McNamara, Times West Virginian, for the West Virginia Sports Writers Assication\n\nFAIRMONT, W.Va. — For the better part of the last decade, basketball fans around West Virginia have heard the name Horton a lot in connection with Fairmont Senior High School.\n\nIt started with Travon Horton, a member of the Class AA All-Tournament team in 2013. Two years later, Tavon “Butters” Horton received the same honor for the Polar Bears in 2015. During the same period, Tyaira Horton was a defensive stopper and overall leader of coach Corey Hines’ Lady Polar Bears.\n\nNow, a fourth Horton has done something none of his siblings have.\n\nTaevon Horton, the latest member of his family to star for the Polar Bears, has been selected as the winner of this year’s Bill Evans Award, given annually to the top boys’ high school basketball player in West Virginia as selected by the West Virginia Sports Writers Association.\n\nThe award is named in honor of former Fairmont Times publisher Bill Evans, and Horton is the first Friendly City recipient of the honor since Jared Prickett won in 1992.\n\nThis season for the Class AA runner-up Polar Bears, Horton averaged 19.9 points, 6.7 rebounds and 2.3 steals per game while shooting better than 50 percent from the floor. As much as his offensive production was a key factor in FSHS’s 25-1 season, Horton’s defense was a difference-maker for the Polar Bears as he was frequently tasked with defending the opponent’s top offensive threat.\n\nHis love for and dedication to basketball that led to him receiving the top honor a high school player can in West Virginia all started years ago, and are rooted in his tight family ties.\n\n“Without any of my siblings — Travon, Butters or Tyaira — I wouldn’t have played sports,” Horton said. “To be honest, Travon started all of it. Butters played because of Travon and Tyaira played because of Butters.\n\n“I played because of Butters, but Travon started it all.”\n\nAs the youngest sibling, playing against his older and more talented brothers wasn’t easy, but the lessons learned were ones that would stick with him forever.\n\n“Of course it was rough. They were always ahead of me strength-wise and speed-wise,” Horton said. “I watched what they did and how they scored on me and I learned from it. It was a big brother-little brother thing, and I also learned from my sister, and I’ve never played against her.\n\nWhen his turn to put on the Fairmont Senior blue and white came along, Horton had the skills and lessons he learned from playing with his brothers, but he wasn’t yet the person he needed to be just yet.\n\n“My mindset now and then was totally different,” Horton said. “I thought everything was going to be handed to me just because of my brothers.\n\n“But it’s not like that. It’s real.”\n\nPrior to his freshman season, Horton played with the Polar Bears during the three-week period, immediately trying to impress and be the best player on the floor by taking ill-advised shots and trying to do too much.\n\nRetton didn’t like what he saw, and knew that the next Horton to come through the program still had a lot to learn.\n\n“I got on him and said, ‘we’ve got some other guys on this team. Pass the ball,’” Retton said. “He figured it out.”\n\nHe did figure it out, but it didn’t happen over night, or even over the course of the next year.\n\nHe entered his freshman season with high expectations, but due to academic factors Horton was unable to finish the season, and his career was put on hold.\n\nAs a sophomore, the high-flying Horton began to open a lot of eyes through his talent and athleticism, but academics once again were an issue, and his season was over prematurely once again.\n\nThis time, however, something was different, thanks to the presence of a new mentor.\n\n“My mom yelled at me in front of everybody because I got kicked off the team,” Horton recalled. “He came along and said, ‘My name is R.J. I’ll mentor him and tutor him.’”\n\nR.J. was Robert John Soltys, who Horton credits for being an incredibly positive influence on him who helped turned his life around, starting that 10th-grade year.\n\n“Ever since that day I’ve been a better person off the court.”\n\nDuring that sophomore season, Horton sat behind the bench every game while his Polar Bears went on to win a state title.\n\n“To me, that shows a lot of humility,” Retton said. “That shows that he wanted to be a part of it, but he had to do it in a different way. I don’t think a lot of kids would have done that.”\n\nRetton saw this maturity, and knew that when Horton got his chance to suit up once again, he would be a different person both on and off the court.\n\nOnce that opportunity came as a junior, Horton was ready and played a vital role on the Polar Bears’ second-consecutive state title team.\n\nComing into this past season, Horton was already a state champion and returning first-team All-State member, and he was ready to write the next chapter in his career.\n\n“I just tried to be better than what I was last year,” Horton said. “I know what I did last year, and I just tried to come back and improve in my senior year.”\n\nThrough 25 games, Horton’s improvement was clear as day, as not only did he shine as the team’s leading rebounder and scorer, but the Polar Bears hadn’t lost a game, and were headed back to the state championship.\n\nA second-straight title for Horton and a third-straight for the Polar Bears, however, eluded him, as Chapmanville got the better of Fairmont Senior in the title game, ending Horton’s career with a loss.\n\nEven so, Horton knows that his basketball journey, which culminates with the Evans Award, had made him a better person and has prepared him for whatever comes next.\n\n“I’m very satisfied with the high school career that I had,” Horton said. “I’m satisfied with even getting kicked off the first two years, because it made me the person I am. I’m even satisfied with (the championship game).\n\n“I’m just thankful. I thank God for everything — the good and the bad, because everything is for a reason.”\n\nBy Chris Johnson for the West Virginia Sports Writers Association\n\nCHARLESTON, W.Va. – Sometimes the stars align perfectly.\n\nWhile that notion is usually reserved for the constellations in the sky, it works on the basketball court too.\n\nMake no mistake about it, Buckhannon-Upshur’s Hanna McClung and Wyoming East’s Gabby Lupardus are stars in every sense of the word.\n\nA pair of stellar point guards with uncanny similarities, it’s difficult to think of one without the other.\n\nOn Sunday, the duo adds one more thing they will forever have in common as they have been selected as the co-winners of the Mary Ostrowski Award for high school girls basketball player of the year by the West Virginia Sports Writers Association.\n\nThey will each be presented with their award at the annual Victory Awards Dinner, which will be May 6 at the Embassy Suites in Charleston.\n\nMcClung and Lupardus not only finished with the same amount of player of the year votes – more than triple the amount of the next closest vote getter – they received the same amount of all-state votes in Class AAA and AA, respectively.\n\nEach was named first-team captain of their all-state teams earlier this past week.\n\n“I’m really excited, it is extremely humbling and a complete blessing,” McClung said. “I’m honored to share it with Gabby because of the type of player she is and the type of person she is. An award like this isn’t the focus throughout the season but it’s something that I think is in the back of every player’s mind. With everything wrapped up, it’s definitely exciting to achieve that.”\n\nLupardus agreed with those sentiments.\n\n“It’s an honor for sure to share this with Hanna,” Lupardus said. “She’s such a great player and even better person. Being named player of the year is a goal that you put in the back of your mind, you put the bigger goal of team success in front but it is always a goal as a player.”\n\nThe statistics speak for themselves. McClung’s per game averages were 21 points, four rebounds, four assists and five steals. For Lupardus it was 11 points, six rebounds, nine assists and three steals per game.\n\nBoth finalized their collegiate plans before the season started, McClung signing with Lenior-Rhyne and Lupardus with Youngstown State. Both were the best players on teams that advanced to state championship games after playing equally brutal regular-season schedules.\n\nHowever, numbers only begin to scratch the surface of what each meant to their team.\n\nCoaches, teammates and opponents will tell you what stands out about both is they are exactly what you want out of a point guard and leader. Their basketball IQ, passion for the game, competitive nature and desire to improve every player around them are qualities that don’t necessarily show up on the stat sheet but are the reasons why Buckhannon-Upshur and Wyoming East have been so successful.\n\nPrior to the start of their senior seasons, McClung and Lupardus had the opportunity to be teammates on the West Virginia Thunder AAU team. This is where mutual respect from different corners of the state turned into a bond of friendship.\n\n“I had heard a lot about Hanna but our paths didn’t cross until last summer,” Lupardus said. “We got really close in the summer. It’s obvious when you watch Hanna play, the passion she has for the game. I hope when I play, my passion is obvious too. It was easy to connect with Hanna and play the game with her. She is such a great shooter, the dedication she has to her teammates, the way she composes herself on the court, she’s always happy to just be playing the game and it’s fun to be out there with her.”\n\nMcClung agrees that playing as teammates is what caused their mutual respect to reach a new level.\n\n“This summer was an unforgettable experience being on the Thunder,” McClung said. “To be on a team with a player like Gabby and play to each other’s strengths it was easy to get into a rhythm on the court with her. It was free flowing and the pressure was off for both of us in a sense. Whoever got the ball ran the point and the system just operated from there.\n\n“Gabby is phenomenal in a lot of aspects. Even before I got to know her, just watching her I knew she was one of the smartest players I had ever seen. She has great court awareness and ability to find her teammates. She can score whenever she needs to. But her basketball IQ is what stood out predominately.”\n\nGirls basketball in West Virginia is in somewhat of a golden age when it comes to point guards. Going back as far as players like Miki Glenn and Mychal Johnson or Taryn McCutchen and Olivia Seggie or more recent players like Gracey Lamm, Aaliyah Dunham and Dena Jarrells, point guards have been at the forefront in this state. McClung and Lupardus have not only cemented themselves as elite players this year, but will go down as two of the best point guards ever in West Virginia.\n\n“When you look at a lot of those players, they all have been active in the summer with AAU ball, a lot of them have played for the Thunder,” Lupardus said. “I think there are so many more opportunities for girls now to play at an elite level in the summer. I know I owe a lot of my accomplishments to developing in that program, and once you get out of West Virginia and play against other girls you see what you have to do.”\n\nFor McClung it’s also a testament to their work ethic to be part of that legacy.\n\n“It’s an honor to be discussed with great players like that,” McClung said. “I think I can speak for Gabby on this. We are both competitors and we have seen what has already come through, so why wouldn’t you try to be as good as them, why wouldn’t you try to be the very best you can be? Why wouldn’t you want to put in the work and try to be one of the best. If you are going to do it, why not try to be one of the greatest to ever do it?”\n\nIt seems to be rubbing off on the next potential group of all-star players in the state. Home games this year for both Buckhannon-Upshur and Wyoming East ended with younger kids lining up to get a picture or an autograph or just a handshake and a smile from either McClung or Lupardus.\n\n“It’s one of the best feeling you can have,” Lupardus said. “It kind of shows what you are doing this for and that it’s all worth it and you are doing things the right way. I’ve had so many little girls come up to me and ask for a picture, even after I was hurt. I had Moms message me after I got hurt and tell me their little girl cried for me. That means so much to me. I want to reach out to every one of those little girls and let them know to keep working hard and doing what they are doing. It means the world to me.”\n\nSkills can be taught and improved upon. Love of the game is something that has to come naturally. For Lupardus, she says the moment was around fourth grade during the time her Dad started taking her to the gym anytime she wanted (something he still does to this day). For McClung, it was the summer before sixth grade when she started working out with Jarrod West, who she credits as being a major influence in her game as well as her life.\n\nThere is shared adversity too. McClung suffered a torn ACL her freshman season at B-U, right before her team made its first of four straight appearances at the state tournament. Lupardus had a scary ankle injury early in her sophomore season and then missed the majority of her junior year with an ACL injury of her own. Lupardus then re-injured the same knee in the first quarter of Wyoming East’s quarterfinal game against Lincoln two weeks ago.\n\nLupardus elected to stay with her teammates through the rest of the tournament before having surgery in Cincinnati the following Tuesday. Late in the AA title game against North Marion, when it became clear the Huskies were going to defeat Wyoming East for the championship, both coaches agreed to let Lupardus enter the game so she could end her high school career on the court without risk of making the injury worse. She received a standing ovation, cheers from even the North Marion student section and made a pair of free throws on one leg.\n\n“It was phenomenal,” Lupardus said. “That was the highlight of my high school career. Those last few moments with my teammates on the Civic Center floor, I will never forget. Definitely the highlight of my career.\n\nGreat statistics, love of the game, desire to make teammates better, competitive nature, inspiration to community, same knee injury … with all those things in common, it begs the question, “No media, no coaches, no teammates, no fans, just Gabby Lupardus and Hanna McClung going one on one in a gym somewhere, who wins?”\n\nNaturally, they both came to the same conclusion.\n\n“The game would never end,” McClung said. “It would just be a continuous game where we probably both pass out in exhaustion with the score tied.”"
