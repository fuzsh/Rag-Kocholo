        "text": "Student Opportunities\n\nChemistry Clubs and Organizations\n\nAmerican Chemical Society\n\nThe American Chemical Society is the student affiliate of the national society. The organization is responsible for arranging both guest and student lectures on campus, providing weekly peer tutoring, and organizing visits to local chemical industries in the surrounding region. Strong involvement with the local Lehigh Valley ACS section is encouraged to aid undergraduates in networking and other professional skills.\n\nEnvironmental Coalition (ECO)\n\nThe Environmental Coalition recognizes that \"sustainability\" is multifaceted-- it means living in a way that protects and enriches the environment and your community and also contributes to a stable economy. ECO seeks to make students aware of the most pressing sustainability issues and through programming empower them to make the change.\n\nPre-Health Professions Club\n\nThe Pre-Health Professions Club informs those students interested in pursuing a career in the health professions with the following information: timeline for their applications, choosing a health professions school or graduate program, financial assistance, careers in the health professions and other related topics. Furthermore, students in the club actively participate in community service events both on the campus and in the community.\n\nThe Moravian Chemistry Department also sponsors an American Chemical Society student affiliate chapter that is active in sponsoring guest lectures, receptions and field trips to local industrial and government laboratories.\n\nScholarships and Prizes\n\nThe Alumni Prize for Outstanding Achievement in Natural Sciences\n\nThe American Chemical Society Award\n\nUpon a recommendation of the chemistry faculty, to a senior chemistry major with an outstanding academic record and promise of an academic or research career in chemistry or a related discipline.\n\nThe American Institute of Chemists Award\n\nUpon a recommendation of the chemistry faculty, to a senior chemistry major with an outstanding academic record and promise of a professional research career in chemistry or a related discipline.\n\nThe Biochemistry Prize\n\nTo a student who, in the judgment of the biochemistry faculty, has demonstrated outstanding achievement in biochemistry and shows potential for significant future contributions to biochemistry or related fields.\n\nThe Stuart S. Kulp Scholarship (restricted to chemistry majors)\n\nTo a chemistry major who, in the judgment of the chemistry faculty, deserves recognition for superior academic achievement and demonstrates the potential to contribute to the field of chemistry.\n\nThe Louis and Esther Bader Memorial Scholarship Prize in Chemistry\n\nTo a junior or senior chemistry major who, in the judgment of the Department of Chemistry, exhibits outstanding professional and academic qualifications in preparation for a career in science.\n\nThe General Chemistry Award\n\nThe Analytical Chemistry Prize (sponsored by the analytical chemistry division of the American Chemical Society)\n\nThe Undergraduate Award for Achievement in Organic Chemistry (sponsored by the American Chemical Society Joint Polymer Education Committee)\n\n2024 Chemistry/Biochemistry Honorees\n\nThe American Chemical Society Award and the Analytical Chemistry Prize - Christina Awwad\n\nChristina pictured with Dr. Alison Holliday\n\nThe American Institute of Chemists Award - Kassandra Alicea\n\nKassy pictured with Dr. Stephen Dunham\n\nThe Biochemistry Prize - Jacob Freeh\n\nJacob pictured with Dr. Shari Dunham\n\nThe Stuart S. Kulp Scholarship - Tegan Haley\n\nTegan pictured with Dr. Stephen Dunham\n\nThe General Chemistry Award - Andrew Unangst and Johanna Zimmerli\n\nJohanna and Andrew pictured with Dr. Shari Dunham\n\nThe Undergraduate Award for Achievement in Organic Chemistry - Emmanuel Bulted\n\nEmmanuel pictured with Dr. Godfred Fianu\n\nThe Louis and Esther Bader Memorial Scholarship Prize in Chemistry - Ryan Kulp\n\n2024 American Chemical Society Club Honorees\n\nActive members of the ACS club awarded with decorative cords\n\n2024 Honorees Pictured (L to R) Liz Miskovsky (ACS Club President), Sophia Shienvold, Savannah Labukas, Riley Masten , Lauren Latchford, Kassandra Aliciea, Helaena Holjes, Emily Burke, Ebony Saccento, Brynne Loudenslager (ACS Club Secretary)\n\nAlso awarded cords, but not pictured: Gwen Kester, Victoria Donovan, Megan O'Brien, and James Crawford"
