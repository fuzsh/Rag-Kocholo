        "text": "The distracted players department\n\nKim Clijsters, the reigning champion of the ladies invitational doubles alongside Martina Hingis, showed up to defend her title and admitted she has missed some of the big moments of the tournament so far. “I went to Taylor Swift in Amsterdam this weekend,” she says, “so I’ve had distractions.” It turns out that the former world No 1 and three-time US Open champion is less of a Swiftie than she is a Very Good Bestie – she got the tickets for her closest friend and surprised her with them. “I love her lyrics,” says Clijsters, “but I was more overwhelmed by the impact that she has on everybody. She’s a great entertainer.” Clijsters knows plenty about entertaining –at the 2017 invitational doubles she invited a fan on to the pitch to have a hit, and even dressed him in one of her skorts.\n\nIt’s slippery on the grass tour\n\nEven a covered roof is no guarantee against a slippery surface, as seen in a number of falls on the show courts this tournament. Some think the problem is the high humidity, causing condensation to collect on the court, but Greg Rusedski thinks it’s something else. “Look at the baseline and the side posts, they’re totally ripped up,” he says. “And look where the net is – there’s nobody going there. It’s a totally different way of playing. So the back of the baseline is getting more beat up because the style of tennis nowadays, you don’t have the serve and volley, that variety.” Clijsters says shoes used to have larger nubs for gripping than are allowed now – should Wimbledon or the tour be addressing the problem? No, says Rusedski. “It’s called grass. You’re supposed to slip.”\n\nHandy water music\n\nThe mood on another miserably wet morning was greatly lifted by the presence of the Wandsworth Philharmonic Orchestra. They drew a large, cagouled crowd in front of the food court, where they were largely sheltered from conditions, although one helper did have to stand over a double bassist holding an umbrella. The musicians, all students at the local academy, couldn’t have arrived with a more suitable set list, from the wryly popular Singin’ in the Rain to the equally watery Hawaii Five-O theme. Later this month they’re off on tour to Salamanca in Spain, where their conductor, Daniel White, hopes for somewhat drier conditions.\n\nSpot the star\n\nYour only chance of a musical interlude from Sir Cliff Richard on Tuesday was if you happened to be in the royal box and caught him humming over the buffet. The star quotient has begun to ramp up into the second week, with Stephen Fry bringing Lena Dunham as his guest, and Sienna Miller accompanied by her partner and fellow actor Oli Green."
