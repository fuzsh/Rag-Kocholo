        "text": "FilmNation Entertainment and Bleecker Street will partner on the worldwide release of Treasure (fka Iron Box), a road trip pic starring Lena Dunham (Girls) and Stephen Fry (The Sandman) that’s set to world premiere as a special gala presentation at this year’s Berlin Film Festival.\n\nAn adaptation of Lily Brett’s bestselling autobiographical novel Too Many Men from director Julia von Heinz (And Tomorrow the Entire World), the film will be the first to be co-distributed globally by the two companies, which have previously collaborated on Waitress: The Musical, as well as Sebastián Lelio’s Disobedience. It’s the third part of Von Heinz’s “Aftermath Trilogy,” examining the legacy of Germany’s Nazi past, on the heels of 2013’s Hanna’s Journey and Germany’s official 2020 Oscar entry, And Tomorrow the Entire World.\n\nThe story takes place in 1990s Poland and follows Ruth (Dunham), an American music journalist, and her father, Edek (Fry), a charmingly stubborn Holocaust survivor, on a journey to his homeland. While Ruth is eager to make sense of her family’s past, Edek embarks on the trip with his own agenda. This emotional, funny culture clash of two New Yorkers exploring post-socialist Poland serves as an example of how reconnecting with family and the past can be an unexpected treasure.\n\nWritten by Von Heinz and John Quester, Treasure also stars Zbigniew Zamachowski (Three Colors franchise). Fabian Gasmia and Von Heinz produced for Seven Elephants, alongside Dunham for Good Things Going. Exec producers include Glen Basner and Ben Browning of FilmNation Entertainment, Bleecker Street’s Andrew Karpen and Kent Sanderson, and Good Thing Going’s Michael Cohen. FilmNation is also handling international sales.\n\nMost recently releasing John Carney’s acclaimed musical drama Flora and Son and Christos Nikou’s first English-language feature Fingernails through Apple Original Films, FilmNation’s upcoming slate includes Sean Baker’s Anora and Pamela Adlon’s Babes, which will be released by Neon in North America and the U.S., respectively, and Academy Award winner Edward Berger’s Conclave with Focus."
