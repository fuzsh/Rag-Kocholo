        "text": "USC Trojans freshman guard Bronny James, the son of Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James, is reportedly expected to stay in the 2024 NBA Draft after being medically cleared to do so, sources with knowledge of the situation confirmed to the Athletic's Shams Charania on Monday (May 13).\n\nJames, 19, previously announced his decision to enter the NBA Draft while maintaining college eligibility and simultaneously entering the NCAA transfer portal in a post shared on his Instagram account on April 5.\n\n\"Sources: Bronny James is expected to stay in the 2024 NBA Draft. The USC freshman has been fully cleared to play in the league as part of Fitness to Play panel and will participate in all pre-draft activities starting with the Draft Combine this week,\" Charania wrote on his X account Monday.\n\nJames averaged 4.8 points, 2.8 rebounds and 2.1 assists during his freshman collegiate season, which was delayed after he suffered cardiac arrest in January. The 19-year-old rated as a five-star prospect and ranks as the No. 5 combo guard, No. 4 player from the state of California and No. 22 overall prospect for the 2023 national recruiting cycle, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings.\n\nJames is also the top-earning amateur athlete with an NIL valuation estimated at $4.9 million, according to On3.com. The Ohio native chose USC over offers from numerous schools including Duke, Kansas, Memphis and Ohio State.\n\nBronny's decision to enter the 2024 NBA Draft coincides with his father's potential free agency this offseason. Brian Windhorst, who covered LeBron James' high school career at St. Vincent-St. Mary Catholic, as well as a beat writer during his stints with the Cleveland Cavaliers and Miami Heat, said he expects James, 39, to opt out of his $51.4 million player option for the 2024-25 season last month.\n\n“I do think LeBron intends to opt out of his contract and become a free agent for the first time since 2018,” Windhorst said during an appearance on Get Up hours after the Lakers were eliminated by the defending champion Denver Nuggets during the first-round of the Western Conference playoffs. “I think that will apply a little bit of pressure to the Lakers.”\n\nJames, the NBA's all-time leading scorer, has publicly expressed interest in playing with his son."
