Sixty-four All-Star Games have been held since 1947, with at least one player chosen to represent the Rangers in each year. The All-Star Game has not been held in various years: 1979 and 1987 due to the 1979 Challenge Cup and Rendez-vous '87 series between the NHL and the Soviet national team, respectively; 1995, 2005 and 2013 as a result of labor stoppages; 2006, 2010 and 2014 due to the Winter Olympic Games; and 2021 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.[29] The Rangers have hosted two of the games. The 26th and 45th took place at Madison Square Garden.\n\n† Selected by fan vote[30]\n\n# Selected as one of four \"last men in\" by fan vote\n\n↑ All-Star Game Most Valuable Player[31]\n\nNew York Rangers players and coaches selected to the All-Star Game[32] Game Year Name Position References 1st 1947 Center [33] Left Wing Right Wing 2nd 1948 Center [34] Center Left Wing 3rd 1949 Defense [35] Center Left Wing Center Goaltender 4th 1950 Center [36] Left Wing Goaltender 5th 1951 Defense [37] Center Goaltender Right Wing Left Wing 6th 1952 Defense [38] Goaltender Defense 7th 1953 Right Wing [39] Defense Center 8th 1954 Defense [40] Center Center 9th 1955 Left Wing [41] 10th 1956 Center [42] Defense Center 11th 1957 Right Wing [43] Defense Left Wing 12th 1958 Right Wing [44] Defense Center Center 13th 1959 Right Wing [45] Defense Center 14th 1960 Right Wing [46] Defense Right Wing Center 15th 1961 Right Wing [47] Defense Left Wing Goaltender 16th 1962 Right Wing [48] Defense Goaltender 17th 1963 Right Wing [49] Center Defense 18th 1964 Right Wing [50] Center Defense 19th 1965 Right Wing [51] Left Wing Defense 20th 1967 Goaltender [52] Right Wing Defense Defense Right Wing 21st 1968 Goaltender [53] Defense Left Wing 22nd 1969 Goaltender [54] Right Wing Right Wing 23rd 1970 Goaltender [55] Right Wing Defense Center Center 24th 1971 Left Wing [56] Goaltender Defense Defense Center Goaltender 25th 1972 Right Wing [57] Left Wing Defense Center Defense Goaltender 26th 1973 Goaltender [58] Defense Center Goaltender 27th 1974 Defense [59] 28th 1975 Right Wing [60] Defense Left Wing 29th 1976 Defense [61] Left Wing 30th 1977 Center [62] Right Wing Right Wing 31st 1978 Center [63] Defense 32nd 1980 Center [64] Defense 33rd 1981 Right Wing [65] 34th 1982 Defense [66] Center 35th 1983 Left Wing [67] 36th 1984 Center [68] ↑ Left Wing 37th 1985 Right Wing [69] 38th 1986 Defense [70] 39th 1988 Right Wing [71] 40th 1989 Left Wing [72] 41st 1990 Defense [73] 42nd 1991 Defense [74] Center 43rd 1992 Defense [75] Center Goaltender 44th 1993 ↑ Right Wing [76] Defense † (Did not play) Defense (Did not play) Center 45th 1994 Left Wing [77] † Defense Center ↑ Goaltender 46th 1996 Defense [78] Center Right Wing 47th 1997 † Center [79] † Defense Center 48th 1998 Center [80] † Defense 49th 1999 ↑ Center [81] 50th 2000 Goaltender [82] 51st 2001 † Right Wing [83] Defense 52nd 2002 Defense [84] (Did not play) Center Left Wing 53rd 2003 † (Did not play) Defense [85] Defense 54th 2004 Right Wing [86] Center 55th 2007 Left Wing [87] 56th 2008 Center [88] 57th 2009 Goaltender [89] 58th 2011 Goaltender [90] Defense 59th 2012 ↑ Right Wing [91] Defense Goaltender Co-coach 60th 2015 Left Wing [92] 61st 2016 Defense [93] 62nd 2017 Defense [94] 63rd 2018 Goaltender [95] 64th 2019 Goaltender [96] 65th 2020 (replaced Panarin) Left Wing [97][98] (Did not play) Left Wing 66th 2022 (Did not play) Defense [99] Left Wing # (Did not play) Center 67th 2023 † Defense [100][101] † Left Wing Goaltender 68th 2024 Coach [102][103][104] Goaltender (replaced Jack Eichel) Center\n\nPrior to the institution of the National Hockey League All-Star Game the league held three different benefit games featuring teams of all-stars. The first was the Ace Bailey Benefit Game, held in 1934, after a violent collision with Eddie Shore of the Boston Bruins left Ace Bailey of the Toronto Maple Leafs hospitalized and unable to continue his playing career.[105] In 1937 the Howie Morenz Memorial Game was held to raise money for the family of Howie Morenz of the Montreal Canadiens who died from complications after being admitted to the hospital for a broken leg.[106] The Babe Siebert Memorial Game was held in 1939 to raise funds for the family of the Canadiens' Babe Siebert who drowned shortly after he retired from playing.[107]\n\nNew York Rangers players and coaches selected to All-Star benefit games Game Year Name Position References Ace Bailey Benefit Game 1934 Right Wing [105] Defense Coach Howie Morenz Memorial Game 1937 Center [106] Right Wing Babe Siebert Memorial Game 1939 Center [107] Defense\n\nNew York Rangers players and coaches selected to All-Star Game replacement events[32] Event Year Name Position References Challenge Cup 1979 (Did not play) Defense [108] Right Wing Center Rendez-vous '87 1987 Right Wing [109]\n\nThe following is a list of New York Rangers who have been enshrined in the Hockey Hall of Fame.[110][111]\n\nNew York Rangers inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame[110][111] Individual Category Year inducted Years with Rangers in category References Player 2008 1994 [112] Player 1978 1952–1964 [113] Player 1964 1953–1954 [114] Player 1966 1953–1954 [115] Player 1958 1926–1938, 1943–1944 [116] Player 1976 1953–1954 [117] Builder 2006 1981–1985 [118] Player 2012 2002–2003 [119] Player 1967 1935–1942, 1945–1949 [120] Player 1952 1926–1937 [121] Player 1995 1926–1936 [122] Player 1974 1936–1942 [123] Player 1992 1987–1989 [124] Player 2006 1964 [125] Player 1984 1975–1981 [126] Builder 1982 1965–1975 [127] Player 1970 1954–1961 [128] Player 2001 1990–1994 [129] Player 1972 1966–1968 [130] Player 1987 1965–1975 [131] Player 1982 1960–1978 [132] Player 1999 1996–1999 [133] Player 1973 1961–1964 [134] Player 1969 1937–1944, 1945–1948 [135] Player 1977 1970–1971 [136] Player 1979 1952–1969 [137] Builder 1975 1961–1981 [138] Player 1958 1926–1937 [139] Builder 1960 1934–1960 [140] Player 2001 1996 [141] Player 1988 1988–1989 [142] Player 2003 1997–1998 [143] Player 1993 1945–1955 [144] Player 2009 1987–2004 [145] Player 2020 1992–1996 [146] Player 1980 1944 [147] Player 2016 2001–2004 [148] Player 2023 2005–2020 [149] Player 2007 1991–1997, 2000–2004 [150] Player 1945 1936 [151] Player 2019 1982–1983 [152] Builder 2002 1989–1993 [153] Player 1988 1947–1951 [154] Player 1988 1968–1975 [155] Builder 2001 1980–1986 [156] Player 1945 1927–1928 [157] Player 1980 1934–1943, 1945–1946 [158] Player 1978 1963–1965 [159] Player 1966 1935–1942 [160] Player 1985 1960–1975 [161] Player 1973 1945–1953 [162] Player 2009 1995–1997 [163] Builder 1997 2000–2024 [164] Player 1971 1969–1970 [165] Player 1963 1931–1936 [166] Player 2013 2006–2008 [167] Builder 2013 1978–1980 [168] Player 1961 1932–1933 [169] Player 1991 1937–1943 [170] Player 2018 2014–2015 [171] Player 1981 1948–1954 [172] Player 1980 1952–1953, 1954–1963 [173] Player 2019 1992–1995 [152]\n\nThree members of the Rangers organization have been honored with the Foster Hewitt Memorial Award.
