        "text": "(JTA) — American-Israeli basketball coach David Blatt reportedly is set to sign a deal with a Turkish team.\n\nThe former Cleveland Cavaliers coach, who had tried to stay in the NBA after being fired midway through the 2015-16 season, will sign with Istanbul-based Darussafaka, the Europe-based basketball reporter David Pick reported Tuesday.\n\nBlatt’s deal is worth close to $2 million a year for an unspecified number of years, according to Pick.\n\nBlatt had interviewed for open head coach positions with the Sacramento Kings and New York Knicks in the past two months. He was also being considered for the Los Angeles Lakers coaching job.\n\nCleveland.com reported Saturday that current Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue called Blatt’s firing “f—ed up” at the time. Before his firing, Blatt had led the team to a 30-11 record, the best in the Eastern Conference, following an NBA Finals appearance the previous season.\n\nThe Cavaliers have again advanced to the NBA Finals, which begin Thursday.\n\nDarussafaka plays in the Turkish Basketball Super League."
