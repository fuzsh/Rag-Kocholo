In London, Jessica meets and falls in love with a musician named Felix, who is described in the official description as “a walking series of red flags.”\n\nAmanda Edwards / Getty Images\n\nBecause the show’s description closely mirrors Dunham's experience of moving to the UK and meeting her husband, she was expected to take the lead role, just as she did in \"Girls.\" However, it was announced in December that Megan Stalter would star as Jessica alongside Will Sharpe, who will play Felix.\n\nJim Spellman / WireImage\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, speaking to the New Yorker for a new profile, Dunham explained that she was reluctant to star in the show after previous experiences with body-shaming.\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer / Getty Images\n\nInterestingly, Dunham — who’s talked openly about body image struggles — recalled it was difficult to “admit” that she wouldn’t feel comfortable in the lead role. However, she said casting Stalter was the perfect alternative, comparing her star to “a little Meryl Streep.”\n\nStephane Cardinale - Corbis / Corbis via Getty Images\n\nNotably, Dunham also talked about the importance of “protecting yourself and doing what you need to do to keep making work.”\n\nVince Bucci / Getty Images for Friendly House\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYou can find Lena’s full interview with the New Yorker here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom Our Partner"
