        "text": "Lonesome Me\n\nLonesome Me was just a foal when Rex Logan found him in a mud hole, so that's what he was named - Mud Hole. In 1984 Rex Logan consigned him at a bucking horse sale in Hobemma, the Calgary Stampede bought him, renamed him Lonesome Me, and started bucking him.\n\nBill Boyd was at that same bucking horse sale. 'Rex told him there was a horse he wanted Bill to get on. and Bill recognized the horse right away. It was one Rex told him two weeks earlier he wouldn't be able to ride. Well, Rex was right -- Lonesome Me bucked and Bill was on the ground.\n\nLonesome Me was a CFR and NFR selection from 1984 right up to 1997. In that time, he won numerous other distinctions. He was Canadian and world champion four times, CFR champion four times, and NFR champion once.\n\nHe started out as a bareback horse and ended his career as a saddle bronc horse. One event was not necessarily better than the other for the bay gelding, though; his four world championships were split between the two events.\n\n\"That's the fourth world buckle for him,” Calgary Stampede manager Winston Bruce said back in 1994. \"He's won two as a saddle bronc and now two as a bareback horse. I have to think that record will stand for a long, long time.\n\nLonesome Me made a career bucking for 16 years, and was retired in 2000.\n\nDick Nash\n\nWhile growing up in Saskatchewan, Dick had many jobs, many of which were of the agricultural nature. One of these jobs was as pasture manager for Fritz Paton, the man who raised many of the countries premiere bucking horses of his era. This is where Dick developed his interest in rodeo.\n\nDick left home at 16 years old and started rodeo as a bareback rider.\n\nHe rode in all the major events until he broke his tailbone, then he had to give up bareback riding. He turned pro in the early 1950s, and competed in four major events:\n\nSaddle Bronc, Bull Riding, Steer Wrestling and occasionally Calf Roping.\n\nIn 1956 he became the first Saskatchewan born cowboy to win the Canadian Bull Riding and All-Around championships. That same year he was runner-up in the Saddle Bronc and he won the Calgary Stampede. In 1960, Dick broke his back and was sidelined from competition for the rest of the year. It was then he decided to judge rodeos, so he could remain involved in the sport.\n\nDick was married to Joanne Powellin 1956 and they took up residence in Turner Valley, AB. Together they had five children, three of which continued on with the rodeo and western lifestyle. Dick was killed in a rodeo accident on June 10, 1961. He was kicked and stepped on by a bronc named Wagon Wheel, breaking his ribs, and severing an artery. He left behind a legacy that has been followed by his family and accomplishments that rodeo followers are proud of.\n\nWilfred\n\nWhen Verne Franklin was driving to a bucking horse sale at Innisfail, he already had his mind made up that he was going to buy a certain little black angus bull. Wilfred, who was about four years old at the time, was being sold by Dale Rose, and didn't buck at first. All of a sudden he started turning back, and word was out that he was a rank bull.\n\nShane Franklin said Wilfred didn't look like he could amount to much at first, but that's just what he did. When he matured, that little black angus reached between 1,600 - 1,700 lbs.\n\nWilfred had a bit of a reputation for being one ornery bull in the chutes. He would turn back right in the gate, and turn right as sharp and as tight as he could. Every ride was a replicate of the last time he bucked. It was like watching an instant replay every time, but he was one tough bull to stay on.\n\nHe was bucked a lot, but when he wasn't being bucked he was quiet. Shane said the secret to Wilfred's success was that he didn't care who or what was around him. He was just as content as an animal could be, laying in his pen and minding his own business, so he never got tired.\n\nWilfred was bucked for twelve years, which is phenomenal for a bull, The average career for a good bull is about seven years. Wilfred was eventual1y retired in 1983."
