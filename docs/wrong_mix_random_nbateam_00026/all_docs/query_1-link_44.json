        "meta_description": "The Calgary Stampede handed out it’s prestigious Pioneers of Rodeo Awards July 10, 2023. The class of 2023 included former Chuckwagon Driver/Outrider Kelly Sutherland, Media Personality Jack MacDonald, and Bareback Riders Robin Burwash and Steve Dunham. Over his 50 year career, Kelly Sutherland would re-write the record book of the Rangeland Derby. His accomplishments are not only staggering, but almost unparalleled in the entire sporting world. Between 1972 and 2011, Kelly Sutherland would win the Calgary Stampede Rangeland Derby once as an outrider and a record 12-times as a chuckwagon driver. Six-times he would be the Calgary Stampede Aggregate winner and would make a remarkable 21 appearances in the Rangeland Derby’s Championship Final Heat. In 2011 he hosted the royal couple during their visit to the Calgary Stampede, and at the Calgary Stampede’s centennial celebration in 2012, Tervita Corp bought Kelly’s tarp for $300,000 – a record high price at the Calgary Stampede Canvas Auction. Also in 2012, and in an emotional presentation, Kelly was honored with the Calgary Stampede’s prestigious Guy Weadick Award.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { if($(document).width()<900) { s = googletag.defineSlot('/50748803/oko-all-bigbox', [300, 250], 'div-gpt-1642787068267-bbm1'); s.setTargeting('URL', [window.location.pathname]); s.setTargeting('position', [1642787068267]) s.addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().refresh([s], {changeCorrelator: false}); } });  Kelly Sutherland ran his final race at the Calgary Stampede in dramatic fashion in 2017, and the acclaimed career of Kelly Sutherland officially ended at the conclusion of the 2017 WPCA Race Season. He’s been known as Killer, The King, The feather, or just simply Kelly, but no matter the moniker, the name Kelly Sutherland has become synonymous with chuckwagon racing. His extraordinary ability as a chuckwagon driver and as a horseman combined with his unequivocal charisma made Kelly Sutherland to chuckwagon racing what Muhammad Ali was to boxing. His records might fall some day, but what never can be displaced is the role Kelly Sutherland played in building chuckwagon racing into a sport for the masses. Jack MacDonald’s parents were volunteers with the Calgary Stampede, and his father worked for the Kenway Saddle & Leather Co., so as a kid growing up Jack travelled with his father to many small town rodeos and fairs where he became a fan of rodeo and chuckwagon racing, idolizing the likes of Marty Wood, Winston Bruce and Dale Flett.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { if($(document).width()<900) { s = googletag.defineSlot('/50748803/oko-all-bigbox', [300, 250], 'div-gpt-1642787068267-bbm2'); s.setTargeting('URL', [window.location.pathname]); s.setTargeting('position', [1642787068267]) s.addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().refresh([s], {changeCorrelator: false}); } });  While working as the news director at CKRD Radio and Television in Red Deer, Jack formally covered the Calgary Stampede for the first time in 1973. Although the Calgary Stampede was always a presence in Jack’s life growing up, actually working for the Stampede never crossed his mind until his friend Dave Paulsen called him up in 1975 to see if Jack was interested in working with himself and Bill Kehler as part of the Stampede’s PR department. Jack agreed and began working for the Calgary Stampede on Parade Day 1975. Starting in 1980, Jack became host and co-produced the Stampede rodeo/chuckwagon television coverage on CFAC Television for 18 years during which time the show enjoyed top ratings, then covered the Stampede Rodeo and Chuckwagon Races for SHAW TV. In the mid 1990’s Jack helped out with Doug Nelson’s documentary on chuckwagon racing called “Hotcakes to High Stakes,” and suggested the Northern Professional Chuckwagon Association change its name to the Canadian Professional Chuckwagon Association which ultimately happened in 1995.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { if($(document).width()<900) { s = googletag.defineSlot('/50748803/oko-all-bigbox', [300, 250], 'div-gpt-1642787068267-bbm3'); s.setTargeting('URL', [window.location.pathname]); s.setTargeting('position', [1642787068267]) s.addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().refresh([s], {changeCorrelator: false}); } });  In 2000, at the request of legendary track announcer Joe Carbury, Jack moved up into the Eye in the Sky as the colour man for the Rangeland Derby. After Joe Carbury’s retirement in 2008, Jack continued in that role with current track announcer Les McIntyre until 2019. Jack even spent 1 season as the host of the Chuckwagon Radio Network’s coverage of the WPCA Pro Tour in 2011 and was the longtime host and master of ceremonies of the Calgary Stampede’s Annual Pioneers of Rodeo Luncheon. Jack MacDonald has dedicated a lifetime promoting and protecting the integrity of Rodeo, Chuckwagon Racing, and the Calgary Stampede in general, and you might say that the Stampede has been Jack Mac’s Hotel California – he’s tried to check out, but he never left. Steve Dunham competed for the first time at the Calgary Stampede in the Boys Steer Riding event in 1971, and after turning professional in 1976, Steve was working both ends of the arena in both Tie Down Roping and Bareback Riding Events. And over the next 20 years Steve Dunham would become one of the most successful rodeo athletes at the Calgary Stampede.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { if($(document).width()<900) { s = googletag.defineSlot('/50748803/oko-all-bigbox', [300, 250], 'div-gpt-1642787068267-bbm4'); s.setTargeting('URL', [window.location.pathname]); s.setTargeting('position', [1642787068267]) s.addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().refresh([s], {changeCorrelator: false}); } });  He was honored with the Calgary Stampede’s prestigious Guy Weadick Award in 1982, and in 1983 Steve made his first of what would be four consecutive trips to the Calgary Stampede’s $50,000.00 showdown round in Bareback Riding. He would win the North American Bareback Riding Championship and the $50,000.00 bonus at the Calgary Stampede for the first time in 1984, and nearly won again in 1985. Steve’s fifth and final trip to the Calgary Stampede’s $50,000.00 showdown round in Bareback Riding would come in 1990, he rode his last Stampede bareback horse in 1995, and would compete for the final time at the Calgary Stampede in Tie Down Roping in 1997. Robin Burwash made history in 1977 when he became the Calgary Stampede’s first Novice Bareback riding champion. It would be the start of an incredible legacy that Robin Burwash would create at the Calgary Stampede.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { if($(document).width()<900) { s = googletag.defineSlot('/50748803/oko-all-bigbox', [300, 250], 'div-gpt-1642787068267-bbm5'); s.setTargeting('URL', [window.location.pathname]); s.setTargeting('position', [1642787068267]) s.addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().refresh([s], {changeCorrelator: false}); } });  Robin competed in the North American Bareback Riding Championship at the Calgary Stampede in 1981, and by 1983 Robin made his first of five trips to the Calgary Stampede’s $50,000.00 showdown round. Steve Dunham and Robin Burwash were involved in one of the most iconic occurrences the Calgary Stampede and the Sport of Rodeo would ever see in 1986. After two rides on Championship Sunday, Robin and his travelling partner Steve Dunham were tied for first place. A ride off was required to determine the Calgary Stampede Champion, and the two tied again after the first ride off. A second ride off was held and again the two were tied. After enduring the mental and physical stress of 4 horses on Championship Sunday at the Calgary Stampede, the two combatants, with the blessing of Stampede officials, opted to share the North American Bareback Riding Championship and the $50,000.00 bonus, in one of the most memorable occurrences in the history of the Calgary Stampede.  googletag.cmd.push(function() { if($(document).width()<900) { s = googletag.defineSlot('/50748803/oko-all-bigbox', [300, 250], 'div-gpt-1642787068267-bbm6'); s.setTargeting('URL', [window.location.pathname]); s.setTargeting('position', [1642787068267]) s.addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().refresh([s], {changeCorrelator: false}); } });  Robin would return to the Calgary Stampede’s $50,000.00 showdown round the following year in 1987 where he ended up as the reserve champion but was honored with the Calgary Stampede’s prestigious Guy Weadick Award. He would win his second North American Bareback Riding Championship at the Calgary Stampede in 1989, made his final trip to the Calgary Stampede’s $50,000.00 showdown round in 1991, and competed in his final Calgary Stampede in 1994. And from 2002 until 2006, Robin acted as the Rodeo//Ranch Manager of the Calgary Stampede. Congratulations to all three recipients for this well earned honor.   *Story supplied by Billy Melville",
