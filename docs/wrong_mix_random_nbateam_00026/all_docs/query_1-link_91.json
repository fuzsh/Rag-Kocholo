        "text": "Sunday saw the Dunham Forest Trophy team play our third round match at home against Chorley.\n\nFor those of you unfamiliar with this competition it is the scratch team and the pro playing singles matchplay against the opposing team.\n\nChorley had a team full of lower handicappers with every player in the team receiving shots. Due to a shortage of available players Andy Slater, Matt Spiller and Hansel Allen all had to play off a 6 handicap despite their indices being higher.\n\nAndy narrowly lost on the last despite being 6 down at the turn, Matt managed to win and Hansel narrowly lost. This meant we needed to win three of the last four matches. Simon McSweeney produced another win, this time 5 and 4. Ed Lawton lost on the 19th before Vice Captain Harry Sexton won 3 and 2 and I won 4 and 2 to claim a 4-3 victory for AEGC.\n\nWe are now into the last 16, the furthest we have progressed in this competition in my 12 years here. A great achievement for a club of our size!\n\nWe have drawn Denton GC in the next round away from home. The date to be confirmed."
