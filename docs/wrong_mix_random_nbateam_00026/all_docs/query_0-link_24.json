        "text": "Fox 11 News and KCAL tied for top honors at the 54th annual Los Angeles Area Emmy Awards, taking home six trophies each.\n\nCabler Fox Sports Net followed close behind with five wins while Univision flagship KMEX and NBC4 bagged four Emmys apiece.\n\nKudos, presented by the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences, were held at the Acad’s Leonard H. Goldenson Theater and were hosted by comedian Paul Rodriguez.\n\nFox 11 went into the night with the most noms, 18, and came away with wins for news writer, education, arts and culture/history, entertainment program, hard news reporting (Aidan Pickering, who tied with CBS’ Joel Grover) and live coverage of an unscheduled news event for the “Good Day LA” report “The Bridge and the Bomb,” which trumped the channel’s Sept. 11 coverage.\n\nKCAL took top honors in multi-part light news story, L.A. local color, non-news editor, news editor, short promo and videographer (single camera).\n\nPopular on Variety\n\nRodriguez began the evening with a nod to current headlines by leading the aud in reciting the pledge of allegiance.\n\nNight’s obvious peak arrived when former L.A. Laker Stu Lantz presented one of two Governors’ Awards to sportscasting legend Chick Hearn. Several winners paid tribute to Hearn in their own speeches throughout the night. Late local legend Jerry Dunphy also received several tributes, including the performance of a song he penned: “From the Desert to the Sea.”\n\nPete Noyes, credited as “the father of investigative journalism in local television,” picked up the other Governors’ Award. Newscast winners were KMEX’s “Primera Edicion 6 a.m.” (regularly scheduled daytime), KTLA’s “First Edition” (regularly scheduled 0-35 minutes) and “CBS 2 News at 5 p.m.” (regularly scheduled over 35 minutes).\n\nOther presenters included Martin Landau, C.C.H. Pounder, Susanna Thompson and JoBeth Williams. A one-hour highlights show will air on KCBS in August.\n\nAnd the winners are…\n\nL.A.
