        "text": "HYBE America’s comedic short film “Summons” from writer, producer and director Ken Cheng has been selected for the Los Angeles Shorts International Film Festival.\n\nAlexandra Shipp (“Barbie,” “Anyone But You”) and Jimmy O. Yang (“Interior Chinatown,” “Love Hard”) star in the romantic comedy set in “The Twilight Zone,” which looks to explore the essential relationship question: “Is the process of courtship and marriage, as we know it, inherently dumb and broken?”\n\n“Summons” offers a playful and innovative spin on the classic “how we met” story and also stars Jamie Chung (“Lovecraft Country,” “Sucker Punch”) and Nichelle Hines (“A Good Person,” “Junction”). The short film includes appearances by Donald Faison (“Scrubs,” “Extended Family”), Timothy Simons (“Veep,” “Don’t Worry Darling”) and Rob Huebel (“Children’s Hospital,” “I Love You, Man”).\n\nCheng previously wrote and executive produced the Jo Koy-led comedy “Easter Sunday” from Amblin Partners, Rideback and Universal Pictures. Cheng is next set to direct “Princes,” a comedy feature based on his original screenplay, for Amblin Partners. He is also writing an animated feature for Sony Pictures Animation. Cheng is the co-founder of the production company and creative incubator Crab Club, Inc., alongside Yang and writer-producer Jessica Gao.\n\n“When we first talked with Ken about the concept of Summons, the team at HYBE America wanted to partner and bring this unique idea to the screen,” HYBE America’s president of film and television James Shin said. “The cast led by Alexandra and Jimmy give incredible, nuanced performances and we’re excited by the potential of ‘Summons.’”\n\nThe Los Angeles Shorts International Film Festival starts July 17 and serves as a qualifier for the Academy Awards and BAFTA. “Summons” will premiere on July 20 at Regal Live in Downtown L.A. during the 5:30 pm schedule block for the fest.\n\nCheng and James Shin are producing, and Yang will executive produce along with Gao, Arvin Chen and Kyle Vinuya. “Summons” is a HYBE America, Pogi Studios and Crab Club, Inc. production.\n\nShipp is repped by CAA, Neon Kite and Goodman, Genow, Schenkman, Smelkinson & Christopher. Yang is repped by CAA, Artists First and Schreck, Rose, Dapello, Adams, Berlin & Dunham. Chung is repped by Gersh, 3 Arts Entertainment and Yorn, Levine, Barnes, Krintzman, Rubenstein, Kohner, Endlich, Goodell & Gellman. Hines is repped by TalentWorks and Animal Federation. Simons is repped by UTA and Myman, Greenspan, Fox, Rosenberg, Mobasser, Younger & Light. Huebel is repped by UTA, and Haven Entertainment. Faison is repped by UTA and Fuller Law."
