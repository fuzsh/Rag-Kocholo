        "text": "Priyanka Chopra was one of countless celebrities who paid tribute to the late NBA star Kobe Bryant on Sunday night.\n\nHours before the Grammy Awards 2020, news broke that Bryant and his 13-year-old daughter Gianna had passed away along with seven others in a helicopter crash in Calabasas, California.\n\nAhead of the music ceremony, which took place at the Staples Center in Los Angeles where Bryant had played for the LA Lakers for 20 years, Chopra took a moment to pay her respects to the athlete.\n\nWhile others, including Gigi Hadid, Anne Hathaway and Julia Roberts, paid tribute to the Bryants on social media, the Indian actress had the basketball player’s jersey number ‘24’ designed on the nail of her index finger.\n\n‘RIP Mamba,’ the actress captioned a photograph of her artistic nails in honour of Bryant.\n\nDuring the night, Chopra was seen walking the red carpet with her husband, Nick Jonas, wearing a custom Ralph & Russo white dress with a plunging neckline.\n\nNick and his brothers Joe and Kevin also honoured Bryant by wearing matching purple ribbons on their jacket lapels.\n\nFollowing an opening performance from Lizzo at the ceremony, the show’s host Alicia Keys addressed Bryant’s death and the impact he had on the world on the world and the building where they all stood.\n\n‘We're all feeling crazy sadness right now because earlier today, Los Angeles, America, and the whole wide world lost a hero,’ Keys told the audience. ‘And we're literally standing here heartbroken in the house that Kobe Bryant built.\n\n‘Right now, Kobe and his daughter Gianna and all of those that have been tragically lost today are in our spirit, in our hearts, in our prayers, they're in this building and I would like to ask everybody to take a moment and just hold them inside of you and share our strength and our support with their families.’\n\nKeys then took to the microphone with Boyz II Men to perform a capella rendition of the song ‘It’s So Hard to Say Goodbye’ as the camera panned to a shot of Bryant’s jerseys which hand in the rafters of the Staples Center.\n\nBryant was a five-time NBA champion before he retired in 2016."
