        "text": "MARTINSBURG — The Jefferson County 8-10 Little League all-stars shoved South Berkeley into a Mason Jar Tuesday night in the loser’s bracket final of the District 6, Area 1 tournament.\n\nPitcher Beckett Mason then sealed the jar.\n\nThe left-handed pitcher who turned 9 a day earlier overcame early jitters and limited South Berkeley to just three first-inning runs as Jefferson won 11-3 at Jay Gall Field at Oatesdale Park.\n\nThe first three batters for South Berkeley all scored, but after that, Mason allowed just one more hit and a walk the rest of the game.\n\nHe retired 16 hitters in a row, courtesy of a caught stealing in the fourth inning, and 18 of the final 19 batters he faced.\n\nMason’s only strikeout came to end the game and send Jefferson into the district tournament that starts June 26 at Gall Field.\n\nJefferson will face Mineral County in an elimination game, and Hedgesville and Moorefield will face in the winners’ bracket.\n\nThe three runs South Berkeley scored gave the Green-Red-and-White a 3-2 lead.\n\nJefferson tied the score in the second inning and took control offensively with a three-run fourth inning and five-run fifth.\n\nIn the opening inning, Dayton Thomas and Connor Craze each were hit by pitches with two outs for Jefferson, and Blake Price delivered a two-run single.\n\nSouth Berkeley started its turn in the first with a walk to Kolton Nichols, a double by Blake Benjamin, a run-scoring single by Jake Couturiau, an error that put Cason Fisher on base and drove in a run, and a Thomas Hilton groundout that plated the third run.\n\nThen Mason took control on the mound, allowing just a third-inning single to Benjamin, who was thrown out by Jefferson catcher Henry Solich, and a sixth-inning walk to Landon Petry.\n\nVery impressively, Mason won the game by throwing only 55 pitches, 20 under the limit.\n\nJefferson tied the game as Mason singled down the third-base line to start the second inning. Cam Anders’ infield single drove in Mason.\n\nJefferson went ahead in the fourth, taking advantage of singles by Paxton Thomas and Mason and three errors.\n\nIn the fifth, the first three batters for Jefferson walked to load the bases. An error on Jaxson Busch’s grounder plated the first run. Then Solich singled, and when the ball got past the left fielder, everybody who had been on base scored. Connor Craze singled to drive in the game’s final run.\n\nThen South Berkeley’s third pitcher, Bo Burkhart retired the next three runners and kept Jefferson off the board in the sixth inning.\n\nBut, with the way Mason was throwing, South Berkeley was left with little hopes and saw its season end.\n\nCHARLES TOWN — Gabby Bibb represents the ideal leadoff hitter.\n\nA left-handed-swinging slap hitter, she reached base almost half the time when she came to bat, setting up the offense for Washington right off the bat.\n\nIt’s like she was made to lead off.\n\nBibb batted .484 and scored 45 runs on 59 hits. this season as Washington finished as the state Class AAA runner-up.\n\nAll and all, the season was an absolute delight for Bibb, who has been selected as The Journal’s Softball Player of the Year.\n\n“It was really fun,” Bibb said of the season. “It was incredible. To be a part of that was unforgettable.”\n\nThe best part for the junior wasn’t what happened on the field, however. While the wins — 25 out of 33 games — were important, Bibb looked deeper into the season’s meaning and the camaraderie that accompanied it.\n\n“For me,” Bibb said, “the best part of (the state tournament) was the bus ride there and all my teammates and to experience it. “\n\nShe said that even the bat checks the night before the tournament were significant.\n\n“We all bonded,” Bibb said. “Just being able to experience it with teammates.”\n\nShe loved every moment of it, including the winner-take-all championship game against University.\n\n“Definitely, everything about it was incredible,” Bibb said. “We had so much support from the school and county. When we came back, we heard every classroom was watching.\n\n“It’s amazing to be the first (softball) team to bring back a plaque to Washington.”\n\nIndeed, while Washington has had some very talented teams play in the state final four in the past, none of them had finished first or second. The 2024 squad made school history.\n\nAnd Bibb enjoyed some personal history as a member of the first-team all-state squad.\n\n“For me, that’s an amazing honor because I haven’t even gotten honorable mention for my first two years,” she said. “It was insane for me.\n\n“It shows hard work really does pay off.”\n\nBibb particularly benefitted from a change in her hitting style when she was about 12.\n\n“Actually, I’m really a righty,” she said. “Around 12, one of my coaches introduced me to slapping because I had speed and didn’t have much power.”\n\nStill, Bibb hit a pair of doubles and two triples this season.\n\nShe is so attuned to hitting from the left-handed batter’s box that she doesn’t think she could return to hitting right-handed.\n\n“It would probably not go very well,” she said.\n\nShe’s not even tempted to switch hit.\n\n“I’m definitely not one of them,” Bibb said.\n\nHowever, she is a speedy outfielder, the prototypical centerfielder who can range in both directions to help out her left and rightfielders.\n\n“I do like playing center field,” she said. “I like it because I can see the whole field, or I get to direct a lot of the girls on the field where to go.\n\n“My speed really helps me in center field, and I like to use that to my advantage.”\n\nShe’s had to adjust a bit for her summer league team based in Frederick, Maryland.\n\nInstead of center field and leading off, she’s typically playing in right field, every now and then left field and batting second.\n\nIt’s not a big deal to Bibb.\n\nShe’s adaptable.\n\n“I’m usually the No. 1 or No. 2 hitter or down at ninth to bring the top back up, to get on base for them,” Bibb said.\n\nToday, The Journal has decided that she No. 1, period.\n\nMARTINSBURG — Nolan Burmeister could well have changed his last name to “Bur-mizer” after his performance Monday night in the District 6, Area 1 8-10-year-old baseball tournament.\n\nThe South Berkeley centerfielder was that stingy.\n\nThe 9-year-old made three highlight-reel catches to take away hits in South Berkeley’s 11-6 win over Martinsburg in an elimination game at Jay Gall Field at Oatedale Park.\n\nThe victory sent South Berkeley into tonight’s final elimination game against Jefferson County. The winner advances into the loser’s bracket of the District 6 tournament that begins June 26 at Martinsgburg.\n\nBurmeister made diving catches for outs in both the fourth and fifth inning, and then raced to the wall two batters after his second diving play to make an over-the-shoulder catch to take away an extra-basehit off the bat of Jace Brown.\n\nHis aggressiveness in the field is simple:\n\n“So, I can win,” Burmeister said. “I love diving for catches. I like the crowd going wild whenever I get the catch.”\n\nHe certainly was a crowd-pleaser in Monday’s win that started off with Martinsburg taking a 3-0 lead in the top of the first inning, only to see South Berkeley score six runs during its half of the first.\n\nSouth Berkeley never trailed after the first inning.\n\nIn the top of the first, Camden Catlett, Brown, Hudson Mann and Karsyn Reyes all singled for the first run. A walk to Landon Allen forced in the second run, and Dezmond Neizer grounded into a fielder’s choice for the third run.\n\nEleven of 12 batters came to the plate in South Berkeley’s six-run first.\n\nA pair of walks started the inning, and Jake Couturieux’s infield single that was thrown away at first base produced a run and put Couturieux at second and Blake Benjamin at third, where he scored on Caysen Fisher’s flyout to centerfield.\n\nMartinsburg’s Judson Roberts made a diving catch on Fisher’s fly ball, kind of setting a tone for the position.\n\nWinning pitcher Colton Hayes singled home the third run and then scored, along with Thomas Hilton, as Grant Boyce beat the throw for an infield single and the throw sailed over first base. Boyce scored the sixth run on an error.\n\nMartinsburg cut its deficit to 6-4 as Oakley Spry and Easton Dearing combined singles with an error.\n\nSouth Berkeley expanded its lead by a run in the third inning as Fisher, Haynes and Hilton all singled.\n\nAllen scored Martinsburg’s fourth run in the fourth inning after blooping a single, stealing second and scoring on an error.\n\nSouth Berkeley answered with a four-run fourth. Clint Martin and Kolton Nichols each had singles, with Nichols driving in a run on his single past shortstop. An error produced the first run of the inning, Benjamin had a sacrifice fly and Couturieux grounded out to shortstop to knock in South Berkeley’s final run.\n\nIn the fifth, Martinsburg’s No. 12 hitter Kellen Mackenzie tripled down the right-field line and came home on Catlett’s groundout.\n\nThe groundout to shortstop came in between Burmeister’s marvelous catches.\n\nMackenzie and Spy were each 2 for 2, and Martinsburg’s Brown went 2 for 3.\n\nHayes two hits led South Berkeley.\n\nIn earlier action in the tournament, Hedgesville claimed the winner’s bracket title after down Jefferson County 16-10 on Sunday. Hedgesville opened its play with a 9-5 win over South Berkeley.\n\nJefferson blanked Morgan County 11 and then gained a 7-6 win over Martinsburg. South Berkeley eliminated Morgan 18-0.\n\nEditor’s note: Please note that all announcements are published in the order received.

They first fell 4-3 but rallied to win the second game 12-11.\n\nMartinsburg now holds a 2-3 record on the season.\n\nThe scoreboard remained empty until the top of the third inning, as both teams got off to a slow start. Post 64 was the first to find success after pushing their third base runner home just before the conclusion of the half inning to take a 1-0 lead.\n\nThe Blue Sox struck back with vengeance in the bottom of the fourth by driving in three runs to establish a two-run lead. All three runs were scored in consecutive plays.\n\nKamien Gonzalez was the first Martinsburg player to score, doing so by sprinting home from third base following a ground ball delivered by Braylon Conner. Gonzalez was followed by Alex Bromwell, who scored in the exact same fashion. Kyle Lore then hit a double to advance Conner home from second base.\n\nPost 64 chipped away at their point deficit in the top of the fifth inning by adding another run to their total.\n\nChase Davis landed himself on first base before stealing second, then making his way home.\n\nRegardless, the Blue Sox still led by one run.\n\nCam Gill pitched the first six innings for Martinsburg. He surrendered six hits, struck out three and gave up two runs.\n\nThe game became tied in the top of the seventh inning after Davis scored yet again. Post 64 was awarded a walk with the bases loaded shortly after, pushing their third base runner home and allowing the team to get ahead.\n\nThe Blue Sox were unable to answer in the bottom of the seventh.\n\nMartinsburg was hungry for a win in the second game, and they received just that. They underwent a constant back-and-forth battle with Potomac Valley for five and a half innings before sneaking in one final run to seal their victory.\n\nThe Blue Sox strode ahead early, taking a 3-0 lead after the bottom of the first inning. Conner was the first to cross home plate, doing so off of a hit by Reilly Bubb. Bubb then scored off of a double delivered by Chase Herndon, and Herndon scored on an error.\n\nThe score remained 3-0 until the Blue Sox doubled their run total in the bottom of the third. Lore scored on a throw to get Martinsburg back in motion and tally their fourth run.\n\nMicah Sloane then hit a massive home run over the left-field fence, bringing Herndon in from second base alongside him to account for Martinsburg’s fifth and sixth runs.\n\nStill scoreless and down by six going into the top of the fourth inning, Potomac Valley did the unthinkable by driving in eight runs.\n\nPost 64’s first two runs were scored on a wild pitch followed by a passed ball. Its third run came from a walk with the bases loaded, and the fourth run was scored on an error.\n\nRuns five and six were scored in the same play, as Post 64’s second and third base runners were able to cross home plate off of a fly ball.\n\nRun seven came from a third base runner who was able to sprint home while the Blue Sox were occupied collecting a groundout. The eighth and final run came from a steal of home plate.\n\nThe Blue Sox were able to quickly reclaim their lead in the bottom of the fourth.\n\nNate Whyte scored on a wild pitch to bring the game back to a one-run difference. Conner followed with another run shortly after during a fielder’s choice scramble.\n\nMartinsburg’s ninth run was scored on an error.\n\nGonzalez scored the Blue Sox’s 10th run by running home from third base, and Blake Hartman collected the 11th running in from second base.\n\nPotomac Valley rallied yet again in the top of the fifth inning to tie the game once more at 11-11.\n\nIn the bottom of the inning, Herndon scored the game-winning run off a double from Gonzalez.\n\nHerndon was a standout at bat and running throughout the game. He collected three hits, three runs and two RBI.\n\nThe Blue Sox stood strong to hold Potomac Valley at bay for the remaining two innings.\n\nMartinsburg had four different pitchers man the mound throughout the second game. DJ Triggs, D Cramer, Austin Moberly and Herndon combined for nine strikeouts. The group also limited Potomac Valley to five hits.\n\nOnly eight of Potomac Valley’s 11 runs were earned.\n\nJefferson’s Hannah Phillips has once again proven her unmatched prowess, earning The Journal’s Girls Track Runner of the Year for the second consecutive year. Dominating distance events with incredible speed and endurance, she continues to set the bar high for any race she competes in.\n\nPhillips also helped the Cougars clutch back-to-back wins at the WVSSAC Track and Field State Championship.\n\nIn what felt like deja vu, both years of the competition came down to her anchor leg of the 4×400 relay with Morgantown. In 2023 and 2024 alike, Phillips had to make up ground to overtake Morgantown’s anchor runner to secure the state title.\n\nIn either year, if Morgantown had won the 4×400 they would have been named the Class AAA girls team state championships. Phillips made sure that did not happen and claimed the title for her own team.\n\n“I was just thinking ‘Let’s do the same thing as last year. I’ve done it before, I can do it again. You know, I just want this for my team, I want my team to be happy and win again,’” Phillips said.\n\nPhillips also secured two first place finishes at the meet.\n\nShe first won the 1,600 with an impressive personal-best time of 5:06.53, then followed with another win in the 800 with a time of 2:16.18.\n\nAdditionally, Phillips ended her season undefeated in the 800.\n\n“I’ve put so much hard work in, so it really paid off in the end,” Phillips said reflecting on her victories.\n\nPhillips is an extremely self-motivated athlete who sets high goals for herself and strives to continue improving every day.\n\n“My biggest motivators are honestly myself and how far I want to push myself in the sport and just getting to my overall goal, which is to getting to the best college I can and getting the scholarship I want and getting to be able to run at the highest level,” she said\n\nPhillips is currently uncommitted to a particular college going into her senior year this fall, as she is keeping her options open.\n\n“Obviously, other big things pushing me are like, ‘I was running the same speed as that girl this year, what is she running?’ and ‘Can I still keep up with her?’, ‘Can I beat her?’, stuff like that and seeing other girls in the country running stuff like a 2:03 in the 800. That’s really pushing me,” Phillips added.\n\nPhillips also recently competed at RunningLane, which is one of the most prestigious national track meets in the United States.\n\nAt the meet she was placed in the second-to-fastest heat for the girls 800. In the heat she ran alongside other runners that could match her speed, which was an infrequent experience for her during the high school season. Regardless, she came out on top and won the race with a personal-record time of 2:11.\n\n“I ended up placing, which I didn’t know was possible,” she said.\n\nPhillip’s efforts earned her the status of RunningLane All-American, as well as a new medal to add to her collection.\n\nShe also competed in the 800 at the New Balance Nationals in Philadelphia.\n\n“I’m not trying to jinx anything but my ultimate goal this weekend is to PR by even more, hopefully under 2:10, because 2:11 just felt way too easy for me,” Phillips concluded.\n\nResults of her race in Philadelphia were unavailable."
