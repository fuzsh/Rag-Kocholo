        "text": "Scams are a scary thing, so you should know these new scams that are trending. It’s easy to think that you could never fall for a scam, but the truth is that scammers are getting better and better and what they’re doing, so it’s getting more difficult to stay safe.\n\nNew Scams That Are Trending\n\nBefore we get into the new scams that are trending, it’s worth reminding ourselves of some age-old scams. Some scam artists just keep doing the same thing, and they keep getting successful results. The IRS has some good information out about tax-related scams and how to avoid them. On the agency’s official website, they warn that seniors are often targeted in scams. This was true years ago and is still true. On their site, they warn taxpayers not to fall for scams targeting older adults. “Scammers pretending to be government officials, aim to steal sensitive personal information and money,” they state. “By posing as representatives from agencies such as the IRS, or other government agencies, these fraudsters use fear and deceit to exploit their victims.”\n\nAnother big scam that’s been around forever is scammers claiming their services are needed to settle with the IRS and “that their debts can be settled for ‘pennies-on-the-dollar’ or that there is a limited window of time to resolve tax debts through the Offer in Compromise (OIC) program.” The IRS says “these promoters are often referred to as ‘OIC Mills.'” In a release, the IRS adds that an Offer in Compromise “mill” will “usually make outlandish claims, frequently in radio and TV ads, about how they can settle a person’s tax debt for cheap. In reality, the promoter fees are often excessive, and taxpayers pay the OIC mill to get the same deal they could have received on their own by working directly with the IRS. This takes unnecessary money out of the taxpayer’s wallet.”\n\n“Too often, we see some unscrupulous promoters mislead taxpayers into thinking they can magically get rid of a tax debt,” IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel said in a statement. “This is a legitimate IRS program, but there are specific requirements for people to qualify. People desperate for help can make a costly mistake if they clearly don’t qualify for the program. Before using an aggressive promoter, we encourage people to review readily available IRS resources to help resolve a tax debt on their own without facing hefty fees.”\n\nNow, let’s move onto the new scams to avoid."
