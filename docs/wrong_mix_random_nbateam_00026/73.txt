UPDATED with complete list of winners: Billie Eilish swept the marquee Record, Album, Song and New Artist categories Sunday at the 62nd annual Grammy Awards, with the 18-year old dominating the ceremony dubbed music’s biggest night.

The live ceremony at Staples Center in Los Angeles was hosted by Alicia Keys the same day as Los Angeles Lakers icon Kobe Bryant, along with his daughter and seven others, were killed in a helicopter crash. He was memorialized throughout the night at the downtown arena where he plied his trade for the Lakers for two decades, including via in a tribute by Keys and Boyz II Men in the opening segment of the show.

Eilish, who had six total noms going in, beat loaded fields for Record of the Year, Album of the Year, Song of the Year and Best New Artist during the primetime telecast. She had won earlier in the day for Best Pop Vocal Album.

Lizzo had a leading eight noms going in and won Best Traditional R&B Performance and Best Urban Contemporary Album honors in the early awards. She led off the CBS telecast tonight winning Best Pop Solo Performance for “Truth Hurts.”

She also opened the show with a live performance that began with a shout-out to Bryant, whose jersey not only hung in the Staples rafters but also found its way into performances throughout the from the likes of Lil Nas X (a multi-winner tonight) and Run D.M.C., which performed with Aerosmith.

Bryant also was noted during another L.A.-centric tribute, to slain rapper Nipsey Hussle, who won a posthumous Grammy earlier in the day for Best Rap Performance for “Racks in the Middle” featuring Roddy Ricch & Hit-Boy. The tribute featured DJ Khaled, Hussle and John Legend’s Higher — the very song later in the night won for Best Rap/Sung Performance.

Among other performances on the show, Usher did a medley tribute to Prince, and Demi Lovato (who got a standing ovation) returned to the Grammy spotlight. Eilish and Lil Nas X also took the stage, as did Camila Cabello, The Voice duo Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani, and H.E.R. Tyler, the Creator also hit the stage for a typically one-of-a-kind performance; a much more subdued Tyler came back to the stage later when he won Best Rap Album for Igor.

Several artists including Cabello, Gary Clark Jr, Ben Platt, Common, Cyndi Lauper and ballet dancer Misty Copeland near the end of the show performed “I Sing the Body Electric” in tribute to longtime Grammy show producer Ken Ehrlich, who was overseeing his final ceremony.

With a total of 84 categories in the mix, organizer the Recording Academy started nice and early with the three-hour-plus non-televised Premiere ceremony. There, Clark won three Grammys in the Blues and Rock categories for This Land and then shredded performing the single during the main telecast.

Film and TV winners in the preshow include a pair of Grammys for last year’s Best Picture nominee A Star Is Born, for Best Compilation Soundtrack for Visual Media and Best Song Written For Visual Media for “I’ll Never Love Again”; the other hit on that soundtrack, “Shallow,” won the Oscar. Also, Hildur Gudnadottir followed her Emmy score victory with a Best Score Soundtrack for Visual Media Grammy win for HBO’s Chernobyl.

Netflix’s music documentary feature Homecoming, spotlighting Beyoncé both behind the scenes and performing at her epic Coachella turn in 2018, won the Best Music Film prize. Former First Lady Michelle Obama also won today, taking the Spoken Word category for her audio book Becoming, while tonight Dave Chappelle won Best Comedy Album for his Sticks and Stones.

Composer John Williams won his 25th Grammy for his “Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge” symphonic suite; he is also up this year for his sixth Oscar, for the Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker score after nabbing his 52nd Academy Award nomination earlier this month.
