Hrvatska radiotelevizija (HRT) is a Croatian public broadcasting company operating several radio and television channels over domestic transmitter & satellite networks. In 2014, more than 85% of HRT's revenue came from television licencing fees with each household required to pay 79 HRK (~€10) per month for a single television set, with the remainder being made up from advertising which is limited by law. HRT is divided into three joint companies - Hrvatski radio, Hrvatska televizija and Glazbena proizvodnja.
