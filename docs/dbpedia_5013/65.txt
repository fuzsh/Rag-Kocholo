The Croatian public broadcaster Hrvatska radiotelevizija (HRT) has launched a new OTT service.

Available free of charge on mobiles, laptops and tablets, it gives users access to four TV channels and 12 radio stations operated by HRT, as well as a video library providing on demand content.

The service, which is current operating in beta, is produced jointly with the national transmission company OiV, along with Verso and More screens.

HRT believes it will be of particular use to viewers who currently have difficulties in receiving its DVB-T services due to interference from Italian TV.

It also says that the service will be available both in Croatia and outside its birders, in accordance with HRTâ€™s copyright and contractual obligations with its partners.
