        "text": "Croatia’s public broadcaster HRT (Hrvatska radiotelevizija), has equipped its headquarters, regional centres and global reporting teams, with Dejero solutions provided by Dejero’s local partner and systems integrator, CS Computer Systems. Supporting the broadcaster’s live news, sports and events coverage, Dejero ensures resilient, high-bandwidth wireless connectivity in the field, as well as simplified content sharing amongst stations.\n\n“The Dejero gear is an essential part of our outside broadcast live reporting where live video is sent to HRT headquarters,” explains Petra Drai, technical team lead for news production at HRT.\n\nDejero EnGo mobile transmitters are relied upon daily by field crews at the broadcaster’s headquarters in Zagreb and regional stations in akovec, Osijek, Vukovar, Rijeka, Pula, Zadar, Šibenik, Split, and more. HRT crews also carry the EnGo transmitters with them when they travel internationally to cover major sporting events, high profile elections and global news events.\n\n“As a national television broadcaster, HRT's task is to inform the public about news from all parts of Croatia and the world — and for such tasks Dejero EnGo has proven to be a critical tool to achieve this because of its robustness, transmission quality and stability — even in locations with limited cellular reception,” says Drai.\n\n“The EnGo provides a fast, secure and portable way to achieve stable connectivity, giving our production crews peace of mind when it comes to delivering live camera feeds from any location, especially for prime time productions.”\n\nHRT uses a combination of Dejero’s EnGo mobile transmitters, PathWay encoders and the MultiPoint content distribution service in its outside broadcast workflow to support on-site reporting at any given location.\n\nThe EnGo mobile transmitters are used by HRT field crews to send live camera footage to a WayPoint receiver installed at HRT’s headquarters. Using multiple Dejero PathWay EC encoders with six integrated modems for 3G/4G/LTE cellular connectivity and the ability to record up to 32 hours of HD (85 GB of storage), the broadcaster can collect feeds to package and enhance the live coverage of events for news, sports and current affairs programmes.\n\nA Dejero MultiPoint cloud-based service simplifies the sharing of high-quality, low-latency, real-time content, enabling feeds from different cameras to be shared simultaneously with HRT’s regional centres that are also equipped with a Dejero WayPoint receiver.\n\nHRT uses the Dejero Control cloud-based management system to centrally manage all of its Dejero equipment from a web browser. Transmitters anywhere in the world can be controlled remotely. Control also simplifies the routing and sharing of live video feeds, recorded clips and file transfers from the field transmitters.\n\n“Because of the on-the-fly configuration through Dejero Control, everything can be checked, set up and done easily and fast by in-house personnel so that our field crews can focus on getting the shot,” Drai added.\n\nHRT Radio also relies on a Dejero GateWay network aggregation device to deliver resilient wireless internet connectivity for the transmission of its daily live radio shows from the field to HRT headquarters.\n\n“It is because of partners like Dejero that we can supply the best-in-class solutions to our customers,” said Ivan Dobranovic, head of Professional AV Solutions and Services at CS Computer Systems. “Their Smart Blending Technology has equipped HRT production teams with truly resilient connectivity, providing the reliability, flexibility and ease-of-use they need in order to focus on their overall mission; to bring high-quality live content from any location to their audiences as the events happen.”\n\nBoth the EnGo and GateWay devices feature Dejero’s Smart Blending Technology which simultaneously combines cellular connections from multiple providers, as well as other wired or wireless IP connections if they are available, to form a virtual Dejero ‘network of networks’. The result is reliable, high-bandwidth internet connectivity for broadcast-quality live video and radio transmission from anywhere.\n\nwww.dejero.com\n\nwww.cs.hr/home"
