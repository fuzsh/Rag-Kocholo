        "text": "The massive military operation, launched to restore Croatian control over 10,400 square kilometres of territory, representing more than eighteen per cent of its total territory, was launched on August 4th, 1995.\n\nJandroković said that the display of the Croatian flag on the Knin Fortress on August 5th, 1995, opened a new chapter in Croatian history.\n\n\"Our triumph in the military and police Operation Storm rightfully resonated far and wide, showing the world the full extent of our defence transformation and confirming the dedication of Croatian defenders and their tactical readiness for the most complex tasks. This new strength of ours, as well as the maturity of the political leadership under President Franjo Tuđman, also enabled the peaceful reintegration of our Danube region,\" he said.\n\n\"Having defeated the Serbian aggressor in an imposed war and regained full control of our own territory, our Homeland could embark on new peacetime successes. Since then, with the exceptional commitment of the Croatian people and state institutions, we have made Croatia politically more stable, geopolitically more relevant and economically stronger,\" added the speaker.\n\nJandroković went on to say that post-war Croatia had fulfilled its goals of joining NATO and the European Union, entering the Schengen area and adopting the euro single currency.\n\nDecisions to acquire multi-purpose fighter aircraft, helicopters, armoured fighting vehicles and anti-aircraft missile systems, have since strengthened the country's national security, he said.\n\nJandroković emphasised the importance of being aware that all these achievements were based on the victory in the Homeland War.\n\n\"Our collective task, therefore, is to constantly cherish the memory of the magnificent victory in Operation Storm and to protect the dignity of the Homeland War against all malicious attacks. We do this by commemorating our great holiday throughout Croatia every year on August 5th, with undiminished pride, patriotic fervour and in the spirit of unity,\" said the Speaker of Parliament in his message."
