        "text": "Some great recognition for Croatian radio host Ljudevit Grgurić, who has won a special finalist award at the prestigious 53rd New York Festivals: World’s Best Radio Programs Awards last night in America…\n\nGrgurić won the special recognition award in the Best Regularly Scheduled Talk Program category for his radio show titled ‘Hungry Ears: Amira Medunjanin, Music and Tears’, which is broadcast on HRT – Croatian Radiotelevision.\n\nThe award-winning radio show was a life-story feature on Bosnian singer Amira Medunjanin. Medunjanin was a guest on the long-running program and sung traditional Bosnian songs whilst taking about her life in war-torn Sarajevo to reaching success on the world stage. Grgurić was the only finalist in the category outside of English-speaking countries, with nice candidates from the USA, Canada, UK, and New Zealand. It is the first time that a Croatian program has been at the prestigious awards.\n\nNYF’s International Radio Program Awards for The World’s Best Radio Programs honors radio programming and promotions in all lengths and formats from radio stations, networks and independent producers from around the globe.\n\n(main photo credit: NYF’s International Radio Program Awards)"
