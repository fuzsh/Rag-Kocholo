        "text": "Description\n\nThe Croatian public broadcasting company Hrvatska radiotelevizija (HRT) will make redundant 200 workers between January and April 2018. HRT has seven regional radio stations and five regional TV centres. Further, it has three national and seven regional radio channels, two terrestrial TV channels and one satellite TV channel broadcasting in Croatian.\n\nAlthough the public broadcasting service provides the main source of news and information, HRT has steadily lost its audience. For that reason, at the end of 2017 HRT's management offered employees severance payment if they volunteered to leave. The procedure is in line with the stipulation of the Labour Act.\n\nAbout two hundred workers showed interest to leave and they are entitled to a severance payment anywhere between HRK 100 to 160 thousand (â‚¬ 13,333 to 21,333), depending on the duration of their work with HRT. Eligible are all employees with at least five years working experience with HRT, provided they are more than one year removed from retirement.\n\nSources"
