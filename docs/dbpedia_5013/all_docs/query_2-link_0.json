        "text": "Croatian radio television company\n\nHrvatska radiotelevizija (abbr. HRT), or Croatian Radiotelevision, is Croatia's public broadcasting company. It operates several radio and television channels, over a domestic transmitter network as well as satellite. HRT is divided into three joint companies – Croatian Radio (Hrvatski radio), Croatian Television (Hrvatska televizija) and Music Production (Glazbena proizvodnja), which includes three orchestras (Symphony, Jazz, and Tamburitza) and a choir.\n\nThe founder of HRT is the Republic of Croatia which exercises its founder's rights through the Croatian Government. Croatian Radio (then Radio Zagreb) was founded on 15 May 1926. This date is considered the date on which HRT was founded. Television Zagreb (today Croatian Television) began broadcasting on 7 September 1956. By the law enacted by the Croatian Parliament on 29 June 1990, Radio Television Zagreb was renamed to Croatian Radiotelevision.\n\nHRT operates as a provider of public broadcasting services, and Croatia provides independent funding by the Croatian Broadcasting Company Law and the State Aid Rules for Public Broadcasting Services. In carrying out its activities, HRT is independent of any political influence and commercial interest.\n\nOn 25 May 2012, HRT's archive of the television and radio program and its collection of musical production was given the status of Croatian cultural heritage.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nCroatian Radiotelevision is the direct successor of Radio Station Zagreb (Radio stanica Zagreb) that started broadcasting on 15 May 1926, the first radio station to broadcast in the Balkans.[3] The station was initially a private company, before Radio Zagreb was nationalized on 1 May 1940. During the Independent State of Croatia, the station was known as Hrvatski krugoval. After World War II, it began to operate as a state-owned radio station.\n\nAt the end of the first year of operation, Radio Zagreb company had a little over four thousand subscribers.\n\nOn the 30th anniversary of the establishment of Zagreb Radio Station, on 15 May 1956, the first television programme was broadcast from the transmitter built at Sljeme. Television Zagreb's first live broadcast aired on 7 September 1956.[4] For the next two years this was the only television broadcasting service in the southeast European area. This was the first TV station in Yugoslavia and would later become a color station in 1972. In 1970s, Radio Zagreb Correspondence Center and to a lesser extent Zagreb TV were the main coordinators of cooperation with other units of the Yugoslav Radio Television in production of media content for numerous Yugoslav citizens abroad.[5] The program was aired by Radio Cologne, Frankfurt, Free Berlin, Zurich, Vienna, Paris, Liege, Luxembourg, Hilversum and Stockholm while the second program of the German public television aired Zagreb made \"Good Morning Yugoslavia\" show.[5]\n\nIn May 1990, following Franjo Tuđman's election victory, he and his ruling Croatian Democratic Union party began a takeover of radio and television stations. In June 1990, the Croatian Parliament renamed the company from Radio Television Zagreb (Croatian: Radiotelevizija Zagreb) to Croatian Radiotelevision (Croatian: Hrvatska radiotelevizija). The HDZ-majority Croatian Parliament soon appointed party loyalists to top managerial and editorial positions on the broadcaster.\n\nThe film director Antun Vrdoljak, a Tuđman appointee who was tasked with overseeing the changes, pledged to make HRT into the \"cathedral of the Croatian spirit\". On 16 September 1991, 300 employees at HRT were fired for \"security reasons\". According to Miljenko Jergović, formerly of the Croatian independent Feral Tribune, there were three waves of purges at HRT at this time: removal of Serb journalists; removal of \"independent-minded, respected and thus dangerous\" journalists; and slowly, the removal of those who did not support ultranationalism any longer.\n\nOn 1 January 1993, HRT was admitted as a full active member of the European Broadcasting Union (EBU).[2]\n\nThe television channels were aired under the name Croatian Television (Croatian: Hrvatska televizija) between 1990 and 1993. Since then, the current name has been used. The radio broadcast unit is referred to as Croatian Radio (Croatian: Hrvatski radio).\n\nFollowing Tuđman's death and the 2000 election in Croatia which brought Stjepan Mesić to power, attempts at reforming HRT into a more open media were made.\n\nFunding\n\n[edit]\n\nIn 2014, more than 85%[1] of HRT's revenue came from broadcast user fees with each household in Croatia required to pay 79 HRK (~€10) per month for a single television set, with the remainder being made up from limited advertising.[9]\n\nTelevision\n\n[edit]\n\nChannels\n\n[edit]\n\nHRT 1 (or Prvi program): HRT's first TV channel, previously known as TVZ 1. This is a general channel with daily news around the world, documentaries, religious programmes, series and movies.\n\nHRT 2 (or Drugi program): HRT's second channel, previously known as TVZ 2. It is primarily used for sports broadcasts and entertainment programmes. The channel is known for its extensive footage of vintage films. It also broadcasts educational programmes.\n\nHRT 3 (or Treći program): HRT's third channel, primarily used for culture, films and documentaries. It launched in September 2012.[10]\n\nHRT 4 (or Četvrti program): HRT's fourth channel, broadcasting news programmes, started airing in December 2012.[11]\n\nHRT International, formerly HRT 5 (or Peti program): HRT's fifth and international channel, broadcasting a wide range of programmes from its domestic channels for the Croatian diasporas in Europe, North America, South America, Australia and New Zealand.[12]\n\nIn the 1980s, there was a third channel called Z3 and later HTV Z3. It was taken off-air on 16 September 1991 when its main transmitter, the Sljeme TV tower, was damaged in an air raid. On 7 November 1994, the channel came back on the air, this time called HRT 3. The channel was later shut down with its frequency de-nationalized and put up for lease in a public tender in 2004 and it has been used by RTL Televizija ever since.\n\nRegional TV channels\n\n[edit]\n\nHRT Čakovec-Varaždin (HRT regionalni centar Čakovec-Varaždin)\n\nHRT Osijek (HRT regionalni centar Osijek)\n\nHRT Rijeka-Pula (HRT regionalni centar Rijeka-Pula)\n\nHRT Split-Dubrovnik (HRT regionalni centar Split-Dubrovnik)\n\nHRT Zadar-Šibenik-Knin (HRT regionalni centar Zadar-Šibenik-Knin)\n\nProgramming\n\n[edit]\n\nDnevnik HRT (\"Daily News\"), popular midday, evening and midnight news program\n\nDobro jutro, Hrvatska (\"Good Morning, Croatia\"), mosaic morning show from 7:00 to 9:00 am\n\nDobar dan, Hrvatska (\"Good Afternoon, Croatia\"), mosaic afternoon show\n\nNedjeljom u dva (\"Sundays at Two O'Clock\"), weekly talk show\n\nTransfer (\"Transfer\"), show about the alternative culture and arts (visual arts, music and web culture)\n\nTV kalendar (\"TV Calendar\"), long-running daily historical documentary television series, narrating about historical events, birth/death of people or their discoveries on the same date\n\nTko želi biti milijunaš?
