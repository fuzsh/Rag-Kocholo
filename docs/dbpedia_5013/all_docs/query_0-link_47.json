As a result, Croatian culture was able to develop in continuity with the Western heritage of which it has long been a part and to which it has contributed for the last thousand years.

Typical dishes are cabbage leaves stuffed with minced meat, ćevapčići (rolls of seasoned grilled meat), dumplings, and pickles. Along the coast, fish is served with blitva, a dish of Swiss chard mixed with potatoes and crushed garlic in olive oil. There are also local delicacies, such as cheese from the island of Pag and wine from any number of good-quality small producers, particularly in Dalmatia.\n\nLiz David-Barrett\n\nThe arts\n\nCroatians take pride in their literary tradition, which dates to about 1100, with the dedication of the Baška Tablet (Bašćanska Ploča), a stone monument inscribed with Glagolitic script that was found in the 19th century on the island of Krk. The first printed book in the Croatian language was Hrvoje’s Missal, a liturgical text printed in 1483. Among the 20th-century giants in Croatian literature are the much-translated novelist, poet, essayist, dramatist, polemicist, and critic Miroslav Krleža (1893–1981) and the lyric poet, essayist, and translator Tin Ujević (1891–1955), both of whom treated psychological and sociopolitical struggles at individual and universal levels.\n\nThe monumental sculptures of the Croatian-born American artist Ivan Meštrović (1883–1962), whom the French sculptor Auguste Rodin once called “the biggest phenomenon among sculptors,” synthesize a particularly Croatian national romanticism with the entire European tradition. His works include many religious reliefs and figures carved in walnut. Meštrović designed his own house in Split, now used as a museum for his works.\n\nCroatian visual artists also have been active in several other genres. Hundreds of painters and photographers are represented in galleries throughout the country, and traditional Croatian arts, including fine textile and lacework, can still be seen. Croatian naive painting, through a simple depiction of the timeless concerns of men and women, struck a universal chord in the mid- to late 20th century and brought worldwide fame to its main exponents, Ivan Generalić, Ivan Rabuzin, and Ivan Lacković-Croata.\n\nFilm enjoys a particularly important place in contemporary Croatian culture. The Zagreb school of film animation has acquired world renown and recognition, including an Academy Award in 1961 for Dušan Vukotić’s animated film The Substitute. Since 1972, Zagreb has periodically hosted an international animated film festival. Acclaimed Croatian filmmakers of the late 20th and early 21st centuries include Dejan Šorak, Krsto Papić, and Zrinko Ogresta.\n\nCroatians enjoy music of many varieties, ranging from folk to opera, jazz, and rock. In Croatia and among the Croatian diaspora, traditional music featuring the tamburitza, a stringed instrument similar to a mandolin (see also tanbur), has a fervid following. In addition, the traditional kolo dance is still performed at weddings and festivals. Zagreb, Split, and Dubrovnik teem with nightclubs that showcase local musical talent. Tereza Kesovija, arguably Croatia’s most famous singer, first received acclaim in the 1960s as a singer of French chansons. In the late 20th and early 21st centuries Sandra Nasić sang and wrote lyrics for Guano Apes, one of Germany’s most popular rock groups."
