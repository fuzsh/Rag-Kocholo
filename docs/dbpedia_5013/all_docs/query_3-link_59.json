        "text": "After Mostar, Croatian Radiotelevision (in Croatian: Hrvatska Radiotelevizija – HRT) yesterday opened its correspondence in Sarajevo. HRT in this way wants to improve informing of the audience about the events in the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH).\n\nThe correspondence in Sarajevo Street of Kralj Tvrtko was opened by the director of HRT, Kazimir Bacic, with the presence of renowned guests from public, political and cultural life, and also representatives of BiH media.\n\n“Today’s opening of the HRT correspondence in Sarajevo is extremely important, primarily for informing on events in the capital of the neighbouring country. It is also very important to point out that this is crucial for Croats living here, for information that need to go in all directions, and for the better informing, “ Bacic said.\n\nHRT director explained that the correspondence in Sarajevo will cover the capital of BiH, the Croatian settlements in central Bosnia and, to a large extent, the smaller BiH entity, Republika Srpska (RS).\n\n“This is ultimately our contribution to BiH’s path towards the European Union (EU),” Bacic emphasized.\n\nThe official opening of the correspondence of the HRT was also attended by a member of the presidency of BiH from the rank of the Croatian people and HDZ party leader, Dragan Covic. He has pointed out, as usual, that Croats in BiH still do not have a public media service program in their native language, and that is why the presence of HRT will provide the Croatian people the right to be informed.\n\nTo recall, the HRT opened its correspondence in BiH for the first time, under war conditions on July 27th 1992 in Siroki Brijeg. Then in 2007, the correspondence from Siroki Brijeg was moved to Mostar, where it was located until December 31st 2014. By the decision of former leadership of the HRT, the correspondences in Sarajevo and Mostar were abolished, and the territory of BiH was covered by only two video reporters for the programs of the HRT. 35 employees and volounteers have been a part of HRT correspondences in BiH so far.\n\n(Source: klix.ba/Photo: hdz.org)"
