        "text": "The programme council of Croatia’s public broadcaster HRT has given its approval to a new subscription model.\n\nQuoted by Poslovni, HRT’s DG Robert Sveb said that the current system of collecting licence fees linked to receivers is outdated and has great limitations and negative PR. There are fewer and fewer households in Croatia and the percentage of people who do not pay the tax is increasing.\n\nSveb added that the priority is to restore the relevance of HRT, which is now not followed by even a quarter of Croatians. He also pointed out that the strategy is being proposed “in the midst of a whirlwind in the media world”, with audience habits changing and production costs rising. Moreover, the media market is now dominated by global platforms “that have enormous strategic advantages in finance and access to information”.\n\nSveb concluded by saying that a new model of financing HRT will now be proposed to the legislator."
