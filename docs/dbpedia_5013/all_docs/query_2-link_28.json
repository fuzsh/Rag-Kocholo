        "text": "Croatian TV channels like Sportska Televizija, HRT, and RTL offer some great shows. However, due to licensing agreements, some Croatian TV channels are only available within the country. They check your IP address to determine your location.\n\nA VPN can give you a secure and private Croatian IP address, letting you watch local TV from anywhere with no buffering. After our team tested dozens of VPNs, I’ve created this list of the best premium VPNs with Croatian servers that work reliably with your favorite TV platforms.\n\nOverall, ExpressVPN is the best option for streaming Croatian TV in HD from anywhere. It offers fast speeds and military-level security features to protect your data while you stream Croatian TV online. Plus, it offers a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try it out without any risk. Editor's Note: Transparency is one of our core values at vpnMentor, so you should know we are in the same ownership group as ExpressVPN. However, this does not affect our review process.\n\nStream in HD With ExpressVPN >>\n\nEditor’s note: The VPN services we recommend below have strict no-logging policies that prevent them from tracking (or seeing) what you do online. This means you're responsible for how you choose to use a VPN, so please be sure to follow all applicable rules and regulations. My colleagues and I do not condone copyright infringement.\n\nBest VPNs to Watch Croatian TV From Anywhere in 2024\n\n1&period; ExpressVPN — Fastest Speeds for Watching Croatian TV Without Buffering\n\nEditor's Note: Transparency is one of our core values at vpnMentor, so you should know we are in the same ownership group as ExpressVPN. However, this does not affect our review process.\n\nExpressVPN's fast speeds are ideal for enjoying Croatian TV in HD from anywhere. We tested its Croatian servers, and the speed drops were an average of only 7%. This meant we could watch Sportska Televizija live for several hours without any buffering.\n\nExpressVPN also works on most of the popular devices, so you can enjoy Croatian TV securely on your gadgets. It can also be set up on your router, which allows you to use it on devices that don't directly support VPN apps (like some older smart TVs). During testing, we configured it on a router, and we were able to safely stream Croatian shows on an LG Smart TV without issues.\n\nFor how advanced ExpressVPN’s features are, it’s still super easy to use. Most of its features work automatically in the background, like obfuscation, which kicks in to help you overcome tough firewalls. For instance, this allows you to safely watch Croatian TV from a café that limits data-intensive activities like streaming.\n\nThe only drawback is that it’s pricy, starting at $6.67/month. However, ExpressVPN frequently offers discounts on its site to help you save some money. Plus, all plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try out ExpressVPN without risk. I tested this claim by requesting my money back using the 24/7 live chat feature and got my money back in 2 days.\n\nUseful Features\n\nSplit tunneling. This allows you to route some traffic through the VPN while the rest uses your regular unencrypted internet connection. It lets you free up some bandwidth so you can get even better speeds for streaming Croatian TV in HD.\n\nShortcuts. ExpressVPN has a handy Shortcuts feature that allows you to add your favorite Croatian websites to the VPN’s main screen. This way, you can secure your connection and start streaming from anywhere securely with just a click.\n\nSimultaneous connections. You can connect up to 8 devices simultaneously, meaning you can share the VPN subscription with other members of your household, making ExpressVPN a great value for money.\n\nExpressVPN Offer August 2024: For a limited time only, you can ! Don't miss out!\n\n2&period; CyberGhost — Easy-to-Use Apps Let You Stream Croatian TV Online Effortlessly\n\nEditor's Note: Transparency is one of our core values at vpnMentor, so you should know we are in the same ownership group as CyberGhost VPN. However, this does not affect our review process.\n\nCyberGhost’s apps are easy to navigate, so you can watch Croatian TV in HD from anywhere without hassle. I also like that apps across devices look practically the same, so you won’t have trouble using the VPN on any of your devices. Even if you’ve never used a VPN before, you can connect to a server and start streaming securely in less than 5 minutes.\n\nIt also has 50+ servers in Croatia. Having dozens of servers to choose from reduces the chances of overcrowding, which could cause noticeable slowdowns. This also makes it easier to find one close to your location for optimum speeds. We were able to connect to a Croatian server and stream RTL Kockica and RTL Televizija in flawless HD.\n\nCyberGhost’s Smart rules feature lets you create personalized connection settings. For instance, it’s possible to set up a rule to connect to a server in Croatia whenever the Netflix app is launched. You can even set triggers for it to launch when you connect to a new Wi-Fi network, open a particular website, and more.\n\nThe only downside is that its short-term plans are pretty pricey and come with only a 14-day money-back guarantee. But CyberGhost’s long-term plans are affordable starting at $2.19/month and offer a generous 45-day money-back guarantee.\n\nUseful Features\n\nWi-Fi protection. This feature protects your connection against potential risks when streaming Croatian TV on public Wi-Fi. This will help you stay safe while you enjoy shows at cafes or airports.\n\n24/7 customer support. You’ll get quick assistance if you face issues watching Croatian TV with the VPN.\n\nAugust 2024 Deal: CyberGhost is currently offering 83% off its most popular plan! on your CyberGhost subscription.\n\n3&period; Private Internet Access (PIA) — Stream Croatian TV on an Unlimited Number of Devices\n\nEditor's Note: Transparency is one of our core values at vpnMentor, so you should know we are in the same ownership group as Private Internet Access. However, this does not affect our review process.\n\nPIA lets you connect an unlimited number of devices at once. We tested it by connecting a Windows laptop, 2 smartphones, and an Android TV at the same time, and we didn’t notice any difference in performance. This makes it a great option if you have several members in your household who wish to use the VPN — you can share without getting interrupted from watching Croatian TV.\n\nI also appreciate that it has adjustable encryption, which is useful for achieving better speeds. PIA offers both 256-bit and 128-bit encryption options — the lower level is slightly less secure but is ideal for not-so-serious activities like streaming. Lowering encryption helps minimize speed loss, making it perfect for enjoying Croatian TV without buffering.\n\nMy only worry is that PIA’s customization options may seem complicated for beginners. However, the apps come pre-configured, so you don’t need to change anything if you don’t want to. Simply select your chosen server from the list and click on the power button to securely watch Croatian TV from anywhere.\n\nAll PIA plans come with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try it for free. To test the refund policy, I requested a refund through the 24/7 chat support and got my money back in my PayPal account 5 days later.\n\nUseful Features\n\nMACE. This feature keeps away unwanted pop-up ads, trackers, and malware, making your Croatian TV streaming experience smoother and more enjoyable. But it won't remove the ads that are already part of the show or movie you're viewing — only the pop-ups and banners.\n\nQuick Connect. PIA offers a widget on its Windows app that shows you the last 6 server locations you’ve used. This makes it quick and easy to continue where you left off.\n\nAugust 2024 Update: PIA doesn't usually have deals or discounts (it's already so affordable), but right now you can !\n\nEditor's Note: We value our relationship with our readers, and we strive to earn your trust through transparency and integrity. We are in the same ownership group as some of the industry-leading products reviewed on this site: Intego, Cyberghost, ExpressVPN, and Private Internet Access. However, this does not affect our review process, as we adhere to a strict testing methodology.\n\nWhere Can I Watch Croatian TV Online?\n\nMost Croatian TV is only licensed to stream in Croatia. These platforms will determine your location by checking your IP address. If you don’t have a Croatian IP address, or your device provides conflicting location data, you’ll see an error message, like this one on Sportska Televizija:\n\n“Nalazite se izvan granica RH ili imamo tehničkih poteškoća”\n\nYou can sometimes find Croatian content abroad on streaming platforms like Sling TV and KrowdTV. However, the choice is quite limited.\n\nHow to Watch Croatian TV on Any Device Safely With a VPN\n\nYou can safely watch Croatian channels such as Nova TV and HRT in HD from anywhere by downloading a VPN to your device or configuring it on your router. I recommend using ExpressVPN because it’s fast, has military-level security features, and is compatible with tons of devices.\n\nOn Mobile (iOS/Android), PC, macOS, and Fire Stick\n\nThis method works for these devices and others that natively support VPNs, like Fire Stick and Android TVs.\n\nSign up for a VPN. Go to the VPN’s official website, choose a plan, and follow the prompts to sign up.\n\nDownload the VPN. Once you’ve signed up, you can download the VPN app for your device either from the VPN’s website or your device's official app store.\n\nInstall the VPN. Follow your device’s prompts for installation. For Linux: if you can’t install the VPN directly with the GUI, you can manually do so using the command line (most VPNs provide instructions for specific devices on their website).\n\nConnect to a server. After installing the app, connect to a server closest to your actual location for the best speeds.\n\nStart watching Croatian TV. Open your favorite streaming platforms, like Doma TV, and start streaming safely in HD.\n\nOn Smart TVs and Roku\n\nMany older smart TVs and streaming devices like Roku don't support native VPN apps. So you’ll need to install the VPN on your router. While the setup is a bit more technical, most VPNs have detailed guides on how to do it. All the VPNs on my list are compatible with popular routers and come with setup guides.\n\nCheck your router. Some routers don't work with VPNs, so first, find out your router's brand.\n\nSign up for a VPN. Pick one that's compatible with your router. For Asus, Linksys, or Netgear routers, ExpressVPN is a good choice. It has a custom router firmware and a router app that makes connecting easier.\n\nConfigure the VPN on your router. Find the setup guide specific to your VPN and router and follow it. After setup, all devices on that router will be protected by the VPN.\n\nConnect to a server. Choose the one nearest to you for the best speeds possible.\n\nStart watching Croatian TV. You're now set to stream Croatian content on any device, including your smart TV and Roku.\n\nFAQs on Watching Croatian TV Online With a VPN\n\nIs it possible to watch Croatian TV for free?\n\nYes, some Croatian TV channels, like RTL Televizija, Nova TV, and HRT 1, offer free online streams. However, the most reliable VPNs for streaming Croatian TV in HD from anywhere require a paid subscription. Fortunately, each of my recommended VPNs offers a reliable money-back guarantee, so you can get a refund if you’re not satisfied.\n\nHow do I watch Croatian TV online in the USA, Canada, and Australia?\n\nSome platforms, like Sling TV and KrowdTV, offer Croatian content outside the country. A VPN can help protect your connection and safely watch Croatian TV in HD from anywhere. Those that are listed in this article worked reliably during our testing.\n\nIs it legal to watch Croatian TV channels in the USA with a VPN?\n\nYes, because it’s legal to use VPNs in the USA. Some US streaming services, like Sling TV and KrowdTV, carry Croatian content. In addition, a tried-and-tested VPN makes it possible to access Croatian TV in HD from anywhere.\n\nCan I watch Croatian channels through US streaming platforms or IPTV?\n\nYes, there are a few Croatian channels offered on US platforms. For instance, Sling TV and KlowdTV offer a selection of Croatian content, but the variety is limited. You won’t get as broad of a range of Croatian TV channels as you’ll get from within Croatia.\n\nIs it possible to watch Croatian soccer live abroad?\n\nYou can watch Croatian sports from anywhere in HD using a VPN. You’ll need to use a premium VPN with secure Croatian servers, as this will let you stay up to date with the big game without risking your data.\n\nCan I use a free VPN to watch Croatian TV online?\n\nYes, but I don’t recommend free VPNs, as they’re often unreliable and can even be dangerous. Free VPNs limit server networks to save money, meaning you might not be able to even find one with a Croatian server. A premium VPN with a trustworthy money-back guarantee is a more reliable option for getting fast speeds, unlimited data, and a selection of Croatian servers. That way, you can watch Croatian TV from anywhere safely in HD.\n\nFree VPNs often restrict your bandwidth and streaming speeds, leading to slow, interrupted streams that can spoil your viewing experience. They can also compromise your privacy by logging and selling your data to advertisers or other third parties. There are also instances where free VPNs have been found to contain harmful malware, posing a risk to your device and data.\n\nWatch Croatian TV in Minutes\n\nThere is tons of Croatian content available online, and some of it you can even watch for free. While most of it is only licensed for broadcast in Croatia, there are some channels that offer Croatian content outside the country. A VPN can keep you safe and let you watch Croatian TV from anywhere in the best available quality.\n\nI recommend ExpressVPN for watching Croatian TV. It has fast speeds and reliable servers in Croatia, so you can connect easily and watch shows in HD. Plus, ExpressVPN comes with a 30-day money-back guarantee, so you can try it out without worrying about losing money.\n\nTo summarize, these are the best VPNs for watching Croatian TV from anywhere…\n\nEditor's Note: We value our relationship with our readers, and we strive to earn your trust through transparency and integrity.
