Data are comparable to those from previous years, except for those on persons in employment. Since the data are used solely for statistical purposes, they are not published individually – by name of the institution, which makes them confidential.\n\nThe Republic of Croatia is divided into nine digital coverage areas (called D1 – D9), which consist of two or more counties or parts thereof. In addition, there are also six smaller urban areas (D41, D51, D52, D71, D72 and D81).\n\nAnalogue transmitters in all digital coverage areas that transmitted programmes of national TV broadcasters have been turned off, that is, the process of transition to digital transmission ended on 5 October 2010.\n\nDefinitions and explanations\n\nRadio stations and TV broadcasters are institutions that broadcast programme for the public via radio and TV transmitters and TV converters.\n\nAccording to the territorial coverage, radio stations and TV broadcasters can cover the whole country, that is, the programme can be received on the whole territory of the Republic of Croatia, in a particular region or in a particular narrow area.\n\nAccording to status, radio stations and TV broadcasters can be public, non-profit and independent, while television channels can be public and independent.\n\nIn-house broadcasted radio programme includes programmes made either in own production or in co-production with other radio stations or those produced by other radio stations.\n\nThe origin of the in-house broadcasted programme can be own production, production of other domestic producers and foreign production. Satellite programme is an in-house broadcasted programme.\n\nEffective radiated power is a parameter that defines the power of the radio station and television. It indirectly includes their transmission area, which, apart from the power, also depends on the altitude of the antenna system and the relief.\n\nPersons in employment presented in tables 1.2. and 2.3. also include permanent staff working for both Hrvatski radio and Hrvatska televizija due to the fact that Hrvatska radiotelevizija is, according to its Statute (NN, No. 14/13), organised as a single institution.\n\nContractual agreement, author’s contract or performance agreement is a civil law contract (agreement) by which the performer undertakes to perform a particular work, perform a physical or mental work and the like, and the client undertakes to pay a fee for the work performed. The contractual agreement is not concluded for a limited period of time, but for the production of a work or work results.\n\nTerritorial constitution\n\nData by counties are presented on the basis of the Act on Territories of Counties, Towns and Municipalities in the Republic of Croatia (NN, No. 86/06) with the situation as on 31 December 2022.\n\nAbbreviations NN Narodne novine, official gazette of the Republic of Croatia TV television Symbols - no occurrence\n\nPublished by the Croatian Bureau of Statistics, Zagreb, Ilica 3, P.
