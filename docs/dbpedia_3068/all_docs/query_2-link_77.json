Grosset published mostly reprints, but not this one. There was a 1919, abridged version in All-Story Magazine titled The Curse of Capistrano, followed by an expansion of the story (McCulley, Eugene Miller and Douglas Fairbanks using his pen name, Elton Thomas) for the 1920 U. A. film and for our 1924 novel, but reports of a 1920 book edition are a hoax.\n\nMore Photos\n\nTHE MARK OF ZORRO\n\nby McCulley, Johnston\n\nUsed\n\nfirst\n\nShow Details\n\nDescription:\n\nTHE MARK OF ZORRO, Grosset & Dunlap, 1924, first edition, spine extremities a bit lightened, age toning to the t.p.e.'s, else a bright, tight vg+ copy in an apparent first issue vg dust-wrapper with an equally bright pictorial front dust-wrapper panel with some chipping to the dust-wrapper spine extremities of the tanned dust-wrapper spine.

Fine in the 1st printing dustjacket without the Grosset and Dunlap logo (\"G&D\") on the spine, and with Dec. 1924 ads on the verso. The dustjacket has small chips to the corners else it's near fine, and 1st editions of Zorro in the correct jacket are plenty scarce (despite us having 2 of them), and most copies in jacket are in the reprint jacket, and those few that are correct, usually look like they've been tortured by Torquemada and then shot by the Death Star. And copies without a jacket are just a submission to hasty expediency.\n\nPrivacy & Security\n\nWebsite Accessibility\n\nTerms & Conditions\n\nSite Map\n\nCopyright© 2024 Biblio, Inc.
