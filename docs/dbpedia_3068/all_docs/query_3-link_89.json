        "text": "will mark the 10th anniversary of the publication of author Isabel Allende’s “Zorro,” which she said she was reluctant at first to write. This reporter was able to speak to her about the novel which is the only Zorro novel to provide details to his early years.\n\nBased upon the 1919 work of Johnston McCulley, Zorro is loosely formed from the chronicles of Early California life. With its Spanish colonial influence mixed in with the native cultures and a pioneer backdrop, the adventures of Zorro went from that initial “The Curse of Capistrano” to more than 60 stories. McCulley was able to create not only a series but a unique mythic legend.\n\nOver the decades the basic premise of the Zorro figure went from daring adventure to romantic comedy to even a bit of horror where he meets up with Dracula. Yet even with some of the genre going far afield, Allende said, “I was lucky that there was material there for me to work with. But, I had to stick to what was firmly established within what McCulley had set forth.”\n\nAllende admitted she was not interested in writing a Zorro novel when the owners of the copyright approached her. Zorro Productions, Inc. which now owns the McCulley material thought Allende would be an appropriate choice to write a novel about Zorro because of her previous novels about Early California such as “Daughter of Fortune” and “Portrait in Sepia.”\n\n“We see out the most talented and skilled people for our projects,” said John Gertz of Zorro Productions, Inc. “Yes, we did knock on Isabel’s door, he said, actually we were introduced by a mutual friend and so I was enthusiastic about meeting Isabel and presenting the idea of a Zorro novel to her.”\n\nHer knowledge of Latin America and her Spanish background was a good foundation on which to create a novel about Zorro set in California. Gertz was pleased and honored that Allende agreed to go forward with writing the novel. And as she explained, “I remember my stepfather used to watch the TV series ‘Zorro’ when he wanted to relax from his work as ambassador to Argentina.” “So, it did have a bit of nostalgia for me from that point of view.”\n\nZorro by Isabel Allende is a work of fiction that pays homage to Early California thru the enduring story of Zorro.\n\nYet as Allende began to immerse herself in Zorro, she did not like all of the various movies and TV shows. “Some I liked more than others, but as a writer I needed to build something that had not been done before. The question of how did Don Diego de La Vega become Zorro? That was not there. I wanted to know not only how did he become Zorro (a name which means ‘The Fox’ in Spanish), but what about his birth, where did he actually come from? And, even something from before that.”\n\nGertz mentioned that while as owners of the Zorro copyright, “we allow writers and artists some leeway, so to experiment a bit with the ideas they have about the Zorro character and storyline.”\n\nWhile the basic outline of Zorro was set. McCulley, was inconsistent with some of the details. With the production company’s encouragement, Allende said she had lots of creative freedom. Naturally, this makes for easy fodder for an active imagination. Yet as Allende noted, “the most enjoyable aspect to the project was the historical research.”\n\nAs someone who is well-versed in history, especially Spanish-American and Early California history, Allende was able to find the proper fit for Zorro’s birth and mixed origins. That swashbuckling side was already a given with the Spanish Colonial connections. But what about the earthy, naturally alluring California?\n\nFor the European-Spanish side of Zorro in the person of de la Vega there was plenty going on during the 18th and 19th Century. “But there really wasn’t much going on in California at that time, except for the Europeans landing and causing disruption to the native people.”\n\nAllende found the answer to her question of Zorro’s birth in a character called Toypurina. “She was a real person in history had all the qualities and circumstances needed to give Zorro a birth mother. Toypurina was a young native woman who helped lead a revolt against the Spanish at the Mission of San Gabriel. She was caught, brought to trial and yet was able to escape execution by converting to Christianity and marrying a Spanish solider-officer.”\n\nAllende said that once she looked to Toypurina just about everything about that side of the Zorro character fell into place. The other thing she did not like about the Zorro storyline was the side-kick character of Bernardo. “I did not like the way Bernardo was depicted. He was always presented as just a sidekick and portrayed as a servant. I thought that was awful.”\n\nGertz agreed with Allende and was pleased with her insights and the need to change the character of Bernardo.\n\nAllende made mention that just about every hero has at least one person to help them; someone who knows them and keeps their secret. “Instead of Bernardo being a servant, I changed his role. I describe him as a ‘milk-brother’ ‘hermano de leche’ in Spanish that means very close, like brothers.”\n\n“I totally agree with Isabel’s changes to the Bernardo character; she did a very good job on that,” said Gertz. It is important to make the character and story line believable and relevant to the times.\n\nAllende went on to say that while Zorro carries the Spanish influence and flair, the European aspect, Bernardo maintains the native tribe values and qualities. He reminds Zorro of the people, the poor, his native side and the importance of his quest for justice. He helps Zorro to not get too carried away, to stay focused. “Bernardo is more nature-minded, reflective, close to the tribes; he is the contrast. But with his help Zorro and he work together as a team.”\n\nMax Byrd in his 2005 review for The New York Times said that “the story falls apart. Unanchored in legend or history…” Yet Byrd in his review overlooked the fact that McCulley had all the sweeping characters and adventures in his serials, which Allende continued in her novel. When I talked with her, Allende reassured that she did plenty of historical research to give the story life.\n\nShe included pirates; the French influence via the Caribbean and New Orleans because as she said, “Pirates were not only part of the time period. But it is through them that Zorro experiences the importance of a democracy.” “Many people don’t know that while on board ship, pirates were very democratic with one another. Yes, the Captain of the ship ruled, but only by vote.” “And, she said, pirates when united really had way of looking out for each other.”\n\nThis adds to Zorro’s appreciation of justice and society. The ideas emerging during the 18th and 19th Century were revolutionary. Gertz also agreed with Allende’s choice in including the pirate influence upon the shaping of Zorro’s ideas. “Pirates were very egalitarian for their times, ” I can understand why Isabel would choose pirates.”\n\nAllende said that one of the reason’s Zorro has endured for so many years is because “he was in a sense the very first super-hero.” (as a masked avenger, Zorro pre-dates Batman by at least 20 years). “What makes him appealing is his humanity. He has no special powers like superman who is from another planet. Zorro is firmly set upon this earth,” she said.\n\nGertz agreed and he points out that another reason why Zorro endures is because, “he is an ‘everyman’ just about anyone and everyone can relate and aspire to his quest for justice.” “No radioactive spider’s bite, or crash-landing from a different planet. Zorro’s powers are his wit, humor, physical strength and ability to endure.”\n\nAnd, just as Allende noted, “Zorro did not use violence to go after the villains. He almost never kills anyone. He only humbles and puts villains in their place; often with humor,” said Gertz.\n\nSince taking over the Zorro copyright in 1977, Gertz and his company have overseen four major feature films, 11 series, lots of comic books (of course) and over 65 stage productions. “The range of stage productions are an unbelievable variety, said Gertz, from musicals to ballet, from comedies to melodrama, to stunt and horse shows.”"
