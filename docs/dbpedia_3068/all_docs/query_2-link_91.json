        "text": "Post by Hiram on\n\nWritten in 1919 by Johnston McCulley, this five-part serial was published in All-Story Weekly, and was filmed as The Mark of Zorro, produced by and starring Douglas Fairbanks in 1920.\n\nAfter the success of the film, McCulley published the original story in novella form under the new title, The Mark of Zorro. Additional stories were written by McCulley and patterned more closely to Fairbanks' interpretation than the original character introduced in Capistrano. Those interested in reading the novella can do so here. goo.gl/0NjZX\n\nI watched The Mark of Zorro the other evening and began to wonder if there was a masked hero with an alter ego that was created prior to McCulley's story. If not, there are a lot of writers that are indebted to Johnston McCulley for creating a genre that began in magazines and pulp novels, then moved to film, comic books, and later on, graphic novels.\n\nPost by sloanrodgers on\n\nI watched The Mark of Zorro the other evening and began to wonder if there was a masked hero with an alter ego that was created prior to McCulley's story.

Coincidentally, this month's History Magazine ponders and answers some of these questions in a nice article on Zorro. The writer and others have posited\n\nthat McCulley borrowed from two older literary characters (Robin Hood & The Scarlet Pimpernel) and noted Mexican hero/ bandits that roamed California after annexation. The alter-\n\nego is a rather old literary device, but Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde is the earliest example that I can think of right now. Zorro is probably the first masked American hero with a cape and\n\nthus the likely inspiration for all the masked/ caped crusaders that followed. 8 )\n\nWho Was That Masked Man? The Legend of Zorro.\n\nwww.history-magazine.com/"
