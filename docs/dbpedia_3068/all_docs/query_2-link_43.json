        "text": "I recently finished reading the 1919 novel The Curse Of Capistrano, which is the first story about the fictional hero Zorro, and this book was just sheer fun from start to finish. It was written by Johnston McCulley, a crime reporter and amateur historian who took up writing stories for pulp magazines. The Curse of Capistrano was one of these, originally published as a five part serial in All-Story Weekly. McCully wrote many other stories about many other characters- under a variety of pseudonyms- but although popular reads in the pulp magazines, none of them really caught on the way the character of Zorro did. The year following the publication of The Curse of Capistrano, the silent film The Mark of Zorro was released, starring Douglas Fairbanks in the titular role. This film was a smash hit, so much so that when McCulley's tale was rereleased in novel form, it was given the same title as the movie: The Mark of Zorro. Today it can be found under both names. As a result of this success, McCulley wrote a number of follow-up Zorro stories as well. And of course, there have been numerous film and television adaptations over the years.\n\nThe Mark of Zorro, 1920\n\nThe Curse of Capistrano takes place in California before it was annexed by America, in the San Juan Capistrano region on the Pacific Coast. The \"Curse of Capistrano\" as he is called by the Mexican soldiers is a masked bandit who rides about the region, robbing representatives of the corrupt governor and punishing soldiers who abuse the native population and steal from the friars at the Spanish missions. The bandit calls himself Senor Zorro ('Zorro' is Spanish for 'fox'â€‹) and is known to be an excellent swordsman and fighter who frequently cuts a \"Z\" into the cheek of vanquished foes, leaving his mark.\n\nThe identity of Zorro is a much debated topic- especially among his victims- and there is a large bounty on his head, dead or alive. *Spoiler Alert* (although, since the work is over 100 years old, one shouldn't be necessary) Zorro is actually Don Diego Vega, 25 year old son of the very wealthy and influential Don Alejandro Vega. He is- by design- perceived to be a poor-spirited weakling, in a country that prizes machismo. He is low energy and complains of fatigue whenever he has to ride horseback anywhere, preferring to be ferried about in a carriage. He dislikes violence or exertion and refrains from the fighting and duelling so common among the young men of his class. My grandmother used to refer to anyone who didn't like to work as having been \"born tired\" and that pretty well describes Don Diego. This is, obviously, a smokescreen to prevent people from knowing that Diego is a skilled rider and brilliant swordsman, and putting two and two together. Indeed, Don Diego even maintains a friendship of sorts with the coarse and corrupt Sergeant Gonzales, professing to like his bragging tales of triumph over his enemies... as long as the stories aren't too violent in nature: too much talk of gratuitous violence makes Don Diego feel unwell. Gonzales in turn can't figure out how Zorro always seems to know where he and his men will be- or not, as the case may be.\n\nDon Diego also doesn't engage in that other popular pass time of rich young men: pursuing women- it requires too much time and energy. His father Don Alejandro, who has no clue about his son's extracurricular activities, is dismayed by Diego's lack of spirit. Why can't Diego be running about the countryside, fighting and womanizing like the other young caballeros? Or rebelling against the government like that scalawag Zorro? He figures that the best thing to do is get Diego married off and have a few kids; hopefully the next generation will have a little more get-up-and-go. With this in mind, he starts pressuring his son to find a bride. In a move which raises some eyebrows, Diego decides to court Lolita Pulido, the 18 year old daughter of Don Carlos Pulido and his wife Dona Catalina. This is seen as somewhat surprising because, although Lolita is very pretty, her father fell afoul of the governor who retaliated by seizing most of his wealth and destroying his influence. Though of good birth, the Pulido's can't bring money, land, or political power to the table- all things which are considered important when a Don is considering marriage. Of course, Don Diego is so wealthy that this is not an issue, and no one thinks that Diego has any interest in politics. Carlos and Catalina are excited when Diego comes calling, hopeful that an alliance with the Vega family will repair their personal fortunes. However, they also love their daughter and want her to be happy, so are dismayed by the unromantic way in which Don Diego approaches courting. He baldly states that his father is pushing him to marry and he's a good catch, so how about it? Also, can they lend him their carriage for the trip home- he rode horseback to their hacienda and is too fatigued to ride back again. Understandably Lolita is left cold by this lacklustre proposal, though she is anxious to be a good daughter. She flounces off and her dismayed parents, attempting to help things along, tentatively suggest to Diego that he might try being a little more romantic- maybe serenade Lolita under her window, like a proper caballero. Diego thinks that this sounds very tedious, but he does offer to send a servant who has a good voice over with a guitar to stand under the window and sing, if they think it will help. They don't. Don Carlos and Catalina don't lose hope, however, promising Diego that they will work to convince Lolita of his attractions as a husband... obviously he is going to be no help in that regard.\n\nLater, while Lolita is out in the garden brooding about her unexciting courtship, she is startled by the sudden appearance of a masked man whom she quickly realizes is the infamous bandit Zorro. He tells her that he is merely taking a quick rest before being on his way, but lingers to talk- and flirt- with her. He kisses her hand when bidding her farewell, leaving Lolita to contrast the pallid attentions of Don Diego with those of Senor Zorro.\n\nSoon though, Don Diego has even more competition for Lolita's hand. Captain Ramon, the new barracks commander at Reina de Los Angeles, sees Lolita and becomes enamoured of her though she thinks he's a creep. He's also determined to catch Zorro, especially after the bandit defeats him in a swordfight, making him appear a fool in front of Lolita and her parents. Later, while the Pulido's are staying at Don Diego's home, while Lolita is there alone one evening (Diego is away and her parents have gone to a friend's house for dinner) Ramon barges into the house, ignoring the pleas of the servants, and attempts to seduce her with more force than charm. As she struggles to escape him, Zorro appears and puts a beating Ramon which is as satisfying as it is deserved. After literally booting the captain out the door, Zorro and Lolita share a tender scene, ending with her vowing to marry no one but him. This further complicates the Diego/Zorro & Lolita romance, and also causes Ramon's infatuation to turn to bitter hatred. He's now obsessed with killing Zorro, and also plots to falsely incriminate Don Carlos with working against the governor, to take revenge on the whole Pulido family for his humiliation.\n\nWill Lolita realize that Zorro is actually Diego? Will anyone else? And will the combined forces of Captain Ramon, Sergeant Gonzales, and their men manage to take down Senor Zorro, the Curse of Capistrano? If you don't know, you should probably read the book. Heck, even if you do know, you should read the book- it's all kinds of fun.\n\n(To Be Continued)\n\nRelated Posts:"
