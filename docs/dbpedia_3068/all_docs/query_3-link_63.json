Literature. HTML:\n\n1820s California, in a bygone era of sprawling haciendas and haughty caballeros, suffers beneath the whip of oppression. Missions are pillaged, native peasants are abused, and innocent men and women are persecuted by the corrupt governor and his army. But a champion of freedom rides the highways. His identity hidden behind a mask, the laughing outlaw Zorro defies the tyrant's might. A deadly marksman and a demon swordsman, his flashing blade strikes down those who exploit the poor and oppressed.\n\nFirst published in 1919, The Mark of Zorro remains a paradigm of swashbuckling adventure and a popular novel to this day.\n\n.\n\n▾Library descriptions\n\nNo library descriptions found.\n\n▾LibraryThing members' description\n\nHaiku summary\n\nCurrent Discussions\n\nNone\n\nPopular covers\n\nQuick Links\n\nRating\n\nAverage: (3.69)\n\n0.51 11.52 62.5 23 283.5 54 404.5 35 16\n\nIs this you?\n\nBecome a LibraryThing Author."
