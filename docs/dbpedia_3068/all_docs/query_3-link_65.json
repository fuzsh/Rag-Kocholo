        "text": "\"Every Hero Has A Story.\" My Blogging From A to Z theme bridges the summer library reading programs throughout the U.S. with storytelling opportunities, ideas, and activities.\n\nWho wouldn't want to wear a cape, black mask, and handle the coolest, sharpest sword in the world - one that he easily carves his trademark Z into any surface? Zorro is the village of Los Angeles' Robin Hood - steals from the rich and gives to the poor. The setting of Johnston McCulley's story of Zorro is in old California where oppression rules. Native peasants are abused and innocent bystanders are persecuted by corrupt rulers and their army. Diego Vega has no choice but to disguise himself as Zorro by night to be the champion of freedom for those in need of his services.\n\nWhy not inspire others to be champions - whether it be to stand up and ask questions, help out someone in need, work as a team to create something great for others, or to build confidence to make a new friend. Read a few of these tales or tell your version of Zorro and have the kids make their marks!\n\nThe Mark of Zorro by Johnston McCulley\n\nYoung Zorro: The Iron Brand by Diego Vega\n\nMinnie and Moo and the Musk of Zorro by Denys Cazet\n\nIt's been a fantastic month of theme blogging. I'd like to thank all of you who have visited my posts and those that left comments. It's always such a boost to read what you have to say! Please pass my blog on to teachers, librarians, families who would benefit from stories of bravery. We're all heroes - tell your tales!"
