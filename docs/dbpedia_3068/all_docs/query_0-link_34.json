        "text": "Johnston McCulley's colonial setting for his Zorro novels was only semi-historical. Early 18th Century California was in rapid transition from Spanish to Mexican rule, and from a mission-based culture to a feudalistic giant ranch culture. The two co-existed for only about a decade, hence the time period for my campaign. The Franciscans established their chain of coastal missions in good faith, genuinely wanting to help the Indians even if their methods were coercive to modern eyes. Spanish/Mexican military leaders and settlers, however, viewed the missions as a convenient step to creating cities using Indian labor, ousted the friars and deprived the converts of their land. The ranch lords, however, quickly found themselves in the same boat once the United States won ownership of California during the 1846 Mexican-American War.\n\nBroader North American context -- Lewis and Clark were exploring the Louisiana Purchase and the U.S. was battling the British in the War of 1812 while the Franciscans were still establishing missions in California. Zorro thwarted evil military commanders in the Spanish/Mexican colonies while folks in the U.S. were building canals and railroads, establishing new states, relocating the Cherokee and other tribes to what became Oklahoma, and arguing over slavery.\n\nMeanwhile, in Europe Beethoven was writing symphonies and Napoleon was doing a pretty good job of taking over everything.\n\nIt is true that Zorro is definitely pulp material. In terms of combat, he outclasses everyone except the story arc's Big Bad, who doesn't get to confront him until the climactic duel. The soldiers and other opponents are mooks, low skills and low hit points. The problem in BRP is that a better combatant can still get nailed by a group of inferiors -- which is exactly the situation in the books and especially the films. Zorro routinely dodges volleys of rifle shot, duels five troopers at once, etc. The BRP rules wouldn't let him get away with it for long unless he is very lucky and/or very cautious (which, of course, he is). Still, if you're a lone guy trying to escape from 20 or more people shooting at you, one of 'em is bound to get lucky sometime. In fiction, Zorro, Batman, the Shadow, and James Bond get away with battling hordes of goons all the time. But RPG characters don't have plot immunity.\n\nYeah. In the films, tv shows, etc. Zorro rarely gets injured, and when he does it is rarely very serious. But with the way BRP works, anyone who fights as much as he does will eventually get clipped jut from the laws of probabilities. And when that happens the injury has a very good chance of disabling the big Z.\n\nIt's not a question of relative skill and stat ratings. It's simply the inherent style of the game system. In BRP even someone with a skill score of 05% can get lucky and take down a better skilled opponent with one hit. It is what keeps the fights tense and dangerous, and is a big factor in the game and one that really differentiates it from RPGs like D&D, where level is so dominant. Normally amor mitgates this effect, but the lack of armor makes swashbuckling characters more vulnerable than those in a high fantasy setting.\n\nThe BRP method goes against the swashbuckling genre. Awhile back someone wanted to do something like this with Pendragon, and ran into the same problem - namely that in Pendragon much of the characters ability to continue fighting is due to his armor soaking up damage, thus turning serious blows into minor nicks or stopping them completely.\n\nHere's a rough, unofficial Zorro chronology based on novels and movies:\n\nThe Life and Times of Zorro\n\n1795 -- Diego de la Vega, son of Alejandro and Regina de la Vega, is born in California.\n\n1804 -- In the United States, William Clarke and Merriweather Lewis begin their exploration of the recently purchased Louisiana Purchase. At least part of this land is claimed by New Spain.\n\n1810 -- Mexican Revolution. Father Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla's revolt against the Spanish is crushed within a few months. Hidalgo is captured and executed in 1817.\n\n1812-1815 -- War of 1812 between United States and Great Britain\n\n1815 -- Finishing his university studies in Barcelona, Spain, 20-year-old Diego de la Vega returns to New Spain to find all is not well at the hacienda (Curse of Capistrano, Mark of Zorro). By 1819 he invents El Zorro to defeat the evil military officer oppressing the countryside and to restore his family’s fortunes.\n\n1821 -- Agustin de Iturbide leads a second, successful revolt against Spain. He then becomes emperor of the newly independent country but is deposed by rivals within 10 months. Mexico is plagued by political instability for the next 40 years.\n\n1834 -- Secularization of the missions begins in California. Church lands are taken over by private ranchers over a three-year period by order of the Governor.\n\n1836 -- Homesteaders from the United States revolt in the province of Texas. Texas wins its independence from Mexico.\n\ncirca 1842 -- An aging Diego de la Vega trains bandit Alejandro Murrietta as the next Zorro. Murrietta marries de la Vega’s daughter, Elena (Mask of Zorro).\n\n1845 -- Texas becomes one of the United States.\n\n1846-48 -- Mexican-American War. Mexico loses about one-third of its territory to the United States.\n\n1849 -- Maya Rebellion. Maya Indians living in the isolated Yucatan Peninsula murder criollos (Mexicans of European descent) and mestizos (Mexicans of mixed descent). The rebellion is put down by 1852 but Yucatan state remains in turmoil for decades.\n\n1850 -- California becomes one of the United States. Zorro successor Alejandro Murrietta (now using his mentor’s surname) struggles to keep his family intact while unraveling a terrorist plot (Legend of Zorro).\n\n1861 -- Benito Juarez become president of Mexico. The Civil War fractures the United States.\n\ncirca 1861 -- Cesar de la Vega, son of Diego, is sent to Spain for his education as his father was. Falsely accused of murder by a romantic rival, the Archduke Maximilian of Austria, he becomes the masked avenger Don Q to prove his innocence (Don Q, Son of Zorro).\n\ncirca 1862 -- Yaqui Indians revolt in California, inspired by the pronouncements of a living idol, Don del Oro. Zorro takes charge of a people’s militia to defeat the Indians and the gang of traitors behind the false god (Zorro's Fighting Legion).\n\n1863 -- French invasion. Archduke Maximilian of Austria attempts to become emperor of Mexico.\n\n1865 -- U.S. Civil War ends.\n\n1867 -- Juarez defeats the French and returns to power. Maximilian is executed.\n\ncirca 1869 -- In the United States, Vega descendant Jeff Stewart returns home from the Civil War to find Box County in the control of corrupt politicians. He dons the mask of Zorro to put things right (Son of Zorro). Perhaps inspired by Stewart's example, cowboy Ken Mason, no family connection, also becomes Zorro to battle bad guys (Ghost of Zorro). It isn’t clear whether it was Stewart, Mason, or a direct member of the Vega family who occasionally teamed up with the Lone Ranger (Tarzan/Lone Ranger/Zorro Adventure Hour).\n\n1877 -- Porfirio Diaz rules Mexico as dictator until 1911.\n\ncirca 1889 -- After her brother is murdered, Idaho Territory farm girl Barbara Meredith battles crooked businessmen opposed to statehood as The Black Whip, using a costume and methods apparently borrowed from Stewart and Mason (Zorro's Black Whip).\n\n1890 -- Idaho becomes one of the United States.\n\n1910 -- When President Diaz jails a political rival right before an election, a national revolt breaks out. Diaz flees the country. Rival generals battle for power until 1920.\n\n1919 -- Pulp author Johnston McCulley spills the Vega family secret in his popular magazine serial, The Curse of Capistrano. Johnston ultimately writes 65 novels about the bold caballero. The last, The Mask of Zorro, is published in 1959.\n\n1920 -- Having murdered all his rivals, Alvaro Obregon becomes president of Mexico. To prevent further chaos, he organizes the Institutional Revolutionary party (the PRI), which controls Mexico to this day.\n\n1937 -- James Vega adopts his great-grandfather's adventuring persona to battle the Marsden syndicate, which is trying to seize the California-Yucatan Railroad (Zorro Rides Again). Despite the fact that McCulley is still publishing his novels, the Marsden gang doesn't catch on. Vega's well-publicized exploits in New York City possibly influence young Bruce Wayne, who launches his career as a costumed avenger two years later.\n\n2015 -- International motocross champion Diego de la Vega, 17, rushes home from Barcelona after learning that his father has been kidnapped only to discover that Pueblo Grande city officials have seized the family's assorted enterprises as well as the de la Vega estate. Sneaking into the mansion, he stumbles upon a secret room containing five glass cases displaying Zorro costumes as well as journals written by their wearers. De la Vega determines to become a sixth Zorro in order to rescue his father and expose the corrupt politicians responsible for his disappearance (Zorro: Generation Z).\n\nHolidays Zorro Might Have Celebrated\n\nJanuary 6, The Three Wise Men -- Instead of exchanging gifts on Christmas Day, Mexicans wait until January 6, when they remember the arrival of the three Wise Men at Joseph and Mary’s home to give gifts to Jesus, who was then a toddler. In addition to gifts, Mexicans share a circular cake called Rosca de los Reyes (The Ring of the Wise Men). The lucky family member gets the piece with a tiny porcelain doll, representing baby Jesus, baked inside.\n\nJanuary 17, Day of Saint Anthony the Abbott -- The saint loved animals and children. On this day, Mexican children clean, groom, and even dress up their pets, then line up at the church so the priest can bless their animals. No pet, goldfish to burro, is too small or too large to be prayed for.\n\nEaster -- Mexicans don’t exchange eggs or chocolate candy for Easter. Instead, they dance and hold feasts. Traditionally, Judas Iscariot is burned in effigy, but so are hated politicians. This may have been a problem for Zorro foes such as Captain Monastario and Luis Quintero.\n\nSeptember 16, Independence Day -- Celebrating Mexico’s 1821 separation from Spain. Since Mexico has had multiple revolutions, there are multiple holidays celebrating them. Diego de la Vega would not have celebrated Cinco de Mayo, which commemorates Benito Juarez’s 1862 victory over the French invaders, but Cesar and James Vega might have.\n\nNovember 1 and 2, Day of the Dead -- Instead of celebrating Halloween, Mexicans hold picnics at the graveyard to honor their ancestors and remember their deceased loved ones. Alejandro de la Vega, a staunch Spanish Catholic, and the friars of the San Gabriel Mission would have discouraged this vestige of pagan ancestor worship, but Zorro’s mother and grandmother, both Shoshone Indians, may have quietly observed such remembrances when no one was looking.\n\nDecember 12, Day of Our Lady of Guadalupe -- This is the biggest Mexican holiday of the year. Shortly after the Spanish conquest, an Indian covert to Christianity saw a vision of the Virgin Mary near the city of Guadalupe. Mexicans flock to her shrine in Mexico City during the day, then celebrate with dazzling fireworks that night.\n\nDecember 16-25, Christmas -- In Mexico, the Christmas celebration lasts a whole week and features daily nativity plays, called posada. After each play, children attempt to break a candy-filled pinata.\n\nMexican Racial Mix\n\nCriollos\n\nMexicans of pure Spanish (or other European) descent. A tiny minority, they are the most wealthy and powerful members of the community, both in Zorro’s day and in the 21st Century. They tend to be politicians, landowners of huge tracts, the masters of large businesses.\n\nMestizos\n\nPeople of mixed Spanish and Indian heritage. They make up the vast majority of the population, 70 percent or more. They range in class from the poor to middle class, but don’t enjoy the aristocratic prestige of the Criollos.\n\nMulattos\n\nDescendants of African slaves imported from the Caribbean to work the plantations. They intermarried freely with the general population. Another small minority.\n\nIndios\n\nNative Americans representing 50 culture groups.\n\nThe Paseo\n\nEach Sunday evening, unmarried men and women age 15 and older gather in the plaza in the center of the village. The girls walk in a large circle clockwise while the boys walk counter-clockwise. If a boy wants to get to know a girl better, he asks her to walk with him. If a couple holds hands, they are officially notifying the village that they are in love.\n\nTurning 15 is a big deal for Mexican girls. At that age, they officially become senoritas (aka as quinceaneras), or young women, and are granted more privileges and privacy. A girl’s 15th birthday may be heralded by musicians serenading her outside her window.\n\nPraying for rain\n\nRainy season May to September; maize requires lots of water. If farmers don’t get sufficient moisture by June or July, they bring statues of Roman Catholic saints out into the fields and pray for rain. Some indios may pray to Tlaloc, Aztec god of rain and fertility. If they don’t get rain, search souls to see what may have done to deserve such punishment."
