        "text": "Decades of filmmaking have leached out the aristocracy and filtered in more populism. Livingston's Zorro describes himself as \"a gentleman pauper.\" Banderas' Zorro is a career bandit. Although Zorro is the least complex of the Western heroes, he fulfills the essence of all of them, as described by the critic Robert Warshow, who wrote, \"[The Westerner] is on the side of justice and order, and of course it can be said that he fights for such things. ... What he defends, at bottom, is the purity of his own image--his honor. ... He is there to remind us of the possibility of style in an age which has put upon itself the burden of pretending that style has no meaning.\"\n\nThe style of Zorro is a man out for a good time. His smile is as much a part of his personality as his mask. Movie heroes with their dark sides have become terrible pulp clichés lately. And Zorro wears his shadow on the outside. In devilish livery, Zorro has an angel's élan.\n\nThe Mask of Zorro (PG-13; 136 min.), directed by Martin Campbell, written by John Eskow, Ted Elliott and Terry Rossio, photographed by Phil Meheux and starring Antonio Banderas, Anthony Hopkins and Stuart Wilson, plays at selected theaters valleywide.\n\nThe Mark of Zorro (1940; unrated; 93 min.), directed by Rouben Mamoulian and starring Tyrone Power, plays July 23-24 with If I Were King at the Stanford Theater in Palo Alto.\n\n[ San Jose | Metroactive Central | Archives ]"
