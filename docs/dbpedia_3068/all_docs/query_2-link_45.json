There was a 1919, abridged version in All–Story Magazine titled The Curse of Capistrano, followed by an expansion of the story (McCulley, Eugene Miller and Douglas Fairbanks using his pen name, Elton Thomas) for the 1920 U. A. film and for our 1924 novel, but reports of a 1920 book edition are a hoax."
