        "text": "\"Where there is Love, there is hope, senorita\"-- Z\n\nThis was an excellent listen. The story was riveting, full of swashbuckling action and passionate romance, exotic mystery and idealism. The writing was excellent, poetic, original, and it never lapsed into cliche. Armando Duran's Spanish scented accent added tremendously to the narrative, making this audio experience far better than a static reading experience. Although 100 years old, listening to this original Zorro story, i could not help but see Zorro as a pioneering figure in the emergence of 20th-century superheros like superman, batman, and wonder woman. I am hoping there is a part two.\n\nGreat fun!\n\nI loved this more than the movies! It was actually an advantage to already know who the \"real\" man behind Zorro is when reading this story, for it allowed me to delight in every trick the man played right from the beginning. This was a true romantic, swashbuckling type adventure ride and a new favorite in my library!\n\nAlso, the part of me that likes history loved hearing some of the original names of cities in the territory, and looking up some of the local history tied to the story. Except when doing that, I was itching to get back to the story every time I had to stop listening for awhile.\n\nNote on the performance: I chose a different version first based on the audio samples, but, though that narrator had great expression and voice, his pronunciation of Spanish names and his Spanish accent grated on me so much that I gave up and bought this one. I'm SO GLAD I did! In additiion to well-pronounced Spanish names and believable Spanish accents for the characters that use them, this narrator gave a much more entertaining performance than I expected and made good choices for each of the characters' voices. He does an admirable job here all around, and I have ZERO complaints!\n\nCharming!\n\nI have enjoyed several previous versions of the Zorro story, but this has to be one of--if not the best. This is, I think, the original version, and has not been surpassed. Also, the reader was perfect. In this story there is excitement, romance, villainy, heroism, irony, farce, humor, drama; and it made me laugh out loud. I don't think it gets better than that.\n\nGreat story, mediocre reading.\n\nWhat didn’t you like about Armando Durán’s performance?\n\nThe story is fantastic, but the reading is somewhat lacking, in my opinion. Overall it's OK, but it's the voice of Don Diego that's lacking. The character is supposed to be lazy and disinterred, not whiny and weak. There's a difference. Unfortunately the reading of the character comes across as the latter, and it's the wrong sentiment for him. Other than that it was fine, but it's significant enough that I would recommend looking for another narrator if available.\n\nIt's okay, if....\n\nIf you've never seen a Zorro movie, then this is a good book. It may seem a bit slow, but the narrator does a fine job. If you *have* seen a Zorro movie....any Zorro movie.....this book moves from 'a bit slow' to plodding. I'm struggling to finish it."
