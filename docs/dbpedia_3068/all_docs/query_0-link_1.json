        "text": "Johnston McCulley almost single-handedly created the costumed hero all by himself! Although many of his characters wore strange costumes: The Man In Purple, The Crimson Clown, The Green Ghost (early series), Thunderbolt, etc., The Mongoose, his most famous creation was that of Zorro, the masked avenger who rode the west righting wrongs and punishing evildoers. Wearing all black, he was an expert with both whip and sword.\n\n“The Curse of Capistrano” was a 5 part serial, running in ALL-STORY WEEKLY from August 9th, 1919 through September 6th, 1919. Other titles soon followed: “The Further Adventures of Zorro,” a six part serial, “Zorro Rides Again,” a 4 part serial, “The Sign of Zorro,” a five part serial, and a two part serial, “Mysterious Don Miguel.” But most of the adventures were various length short stories, which appeared in WEST from 1944 through 1951.\n\nAt least half a dozen Saturday Matinee serials were produced for the theaters, from Clayton Moore’s “Ghost of Zorro,” to Linda Stirling’s portrayal of a female Zorro in “Zorro’s Black Whip,” my all time favorite. In all of the matinees, Zorro was dressed in the familiar black regalia, complete with whip and guns, some times a flashing sword for excitement. In addition, several top-notch, movies were released. Television produced two excellent Zorro series, which remained true to the character, and were highly popular during their time.\n\nAs the movies proved, Zorro was a visual success, more so than the printed text of the short stories and serials from ARGOSY. Comic book publishers loved the character, as Zorro was the ideal hero for the comic reader. Let’s face it, without Zorro there would not have been a Lash LaRue or Durango Kid. To take this a step further, The Lone Ranger, the Green Hornet, and all of the masked rider cowboys of the silver screen owe their influence to Johnston McCulley’s famous hero.\n\nBut if Zorro was an influence to one media, he was an influence to all. The pulps, called such because of the cheap wood pulp the magazines were printed on, was preparing for the Roaring Twenties when Zorro appeared in 1919. In the 1920s, the pulps were publishing a lot of crime fiction and adventure stories, so the costumed hero had to wait until the 1930s for their heyday. In fact, there was only one new Zorro in the 1920s, and that was the six-part serial in 1922.\n\nAfter the Wall Street crash of ’29, the readers were looking for new heroes. They were tired of the criminal element in their life and the media. Johnston McCulley, under his own name, and a number of house names, gave the reader the heroes they needed. Characters started appearing with names like the Green Ghost, The Mongoose, The Crimson Clown, The Man in Purple, and others, all by Zorro creator, Johnston McCulley. Another early series, The Bat, as written by (house name) C.K.M. Scanlon, was a costumed hero that researchers say was probably McCulley, as well. And I agree. With the beginning of the costumed hero, other greats began to appear: The Shadow, The Spider, The Phantom Detective, The Ghost! Green Ghost (later series), Masked Detective, the Crimson Mask, The Scar, and many others. All owe their success to Zorro creator, McCulley.\n\nIt’s the same with my character of The Black Ghost, though The Shadow was my inspiration. However, I brought my costumed crime fighter into the present, dealing with more modern criminals, although criminals are basically the same, no matter what period they exist. Following is a 4-Cup Review from Coffee Time Romance, so please keep in mind this was the highest rating possible for a non-romance title to receive.\n\nTom\n\nReviews for Guns of The Black Ghost"
