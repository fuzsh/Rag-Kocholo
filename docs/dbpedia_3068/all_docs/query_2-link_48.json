        "text": "The Mark of Zorro (1924) is a novel by Johnston McCulley. Originally published as The Curse of Capistrano (1919), McCulley's novel was rereleased to capitalize on the success of the 1920 silent film of the same name starring Douglas Fairbanks. Beloved by generations of readers and moviegoers alike, Zorro is recognized as a symbol of justice and rebellion throughout the world. \"Outside the wind shrieked and the rain dashed against the ground in a solid sheet. It was a typical February storm for southern California. At the missions the frailes had cared for the stock and had closed the buildings for the night. At every great hacienda big fires were burning in the houses. The timid natives kept to their little adobe huts, glad for shelter.\" While the rich live in comfort, warm and safe from the wind and driving rain, the poor Californian people hide in their makeshift homes, fearful not just of the weather, but of the governor and his vicious soldiers. Oppressed for so long, they have nearly given up hope when a masked man arrives, a swordsman by the name of Zorro. As news of his actions spreads, revealing his knack for stealing from the rich in order to give the poor their due, the governor sends his most ruthless officer to put a stop to the vigilante, once and for all. This edition of Johnston McCulley's The Mark of Zorro is a classic of American pulp fiction reimagined for modern readers.\n\nSince our inception in 2020, Mint Editions has kept sustainability and innovation at the forefront of our mission.
