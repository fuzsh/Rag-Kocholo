        "text": "The original messages this entry is based on were from the old blog in 2005. I have an interest in many literary characters and themes. Some of those can be found throughout this and other sites.\n\nOne of these is Zorro. As one of the origins of the sort of un-powered superhero such as Batman, Zorro has had a certain fascination for me.\n\n(from 2005) I’m currently reading the novel Zorro, by Isabel Allende. I was reluctant to read this book when it first came out, since the thought of a mainstream author taking on a pulp character seemed risky to me, and honestly I can be pretty picky about details and continuity.\n\nOne of the things about the Zorro legend since the character’s first appearance in 1919 “The Curse of Capistrano”, by Johnston McCulley, is that the details have evolved throughout the various stories, movies and television series. For instance, the horse was not given a name until the 1950s TV series with Guy Williams where he was called “Tornado”. In the 1980s Duncan Regehr series, the horse is named “Toranado”. Things like that. Allende manages to maintain much of these continuity details, an still brings them together into an enjoyable novel; honoring the various earlier versions, and still managing to bring her own take to the character and the events. You don’t need to have read the earlier versions to enjoy this one, but if you have it’s still quite good.\n\nExcellent book. I think it might even be enjoyable to people who aren’t all that interested in the character as has been presented over the past century, but are just looking for a good story.\n\nPartial list of
