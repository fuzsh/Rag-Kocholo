        "text": "Long before Superman, Batman or Spider-Man burst into pop culture, a sword-wielding caped crusader roamed the byways of rural California, battling corruption and standing up for all that was just, decent and good.\n\nWho in Orange County knew that the masked man Zorro, clad in black, was Orange County’s own original superhero, cultivated in San Juan Capistrano?\n\nThat is the premise for “The Curse of Capistrano,” an outdoor drama that Camino Real Playhouse is presenting this weekend and next at Historic Town Center Park in San Juan.\n\nThe play, adapted from a serialized story written in 1919 as “The Curse of Capistrano,” is a lively escape complete with swordfights, cracking of whips, humor and intrigue. The original story by Johnston McCulley introduced the caped character known as Zorro – a Spanish term meaning, in this case, sly fox – nearly two decades before Superman and Batman were born as comic book superheroes.\n\nFrom the silent era to modern times there have been dozens of Zorro movies made in the U.S., Mexico and Europe. The tale of Zorro spawned a 1950s Disney television series that led to a succession of TV and movie re-enactments. The story harks back to colonial Alta California, when Spain ruled what one day would become the domain of Fantasyland, the Festival of Arts and Surf City.\n\n“The Curse of Capistrano” opened with three performances July 15-17. “We had a good crowd and it was lots of laughs, applause, everything,” said Tom Scott, president of Camino Real Playhouse and co-producer of the play.\n\nIt’s not hard to guess that, in the end, Zorro gets the girl, but there is a twist.\n\nThe plot involves an underwhelming aristocrat named Don Diego, families that jockey for favor, unwanted courtships, a meddling governor, snide Spanish soldiers and the elusive, mysterious folk hero Zorro.\n\nThe story is family-friendly. Half an hour before the show, the producers invite parents to send their children up on stage for a round of harmless, good-natured lessons on how to manipulate a flexible foam sword like Zorro would. Camino Real provides kid-sized Zorro masks.\n\nTo conclude the “training,” boys and girls learn to make the trademark swoosh-swoosh-swoosh sign of Zorro.\n\nFor fans of all ages, instructors James and Leslie Leone demonstrate sword technique, show how Zorro might disarm someone with a whip and explain where the Spanish period fits within California history.\n\nDuring the past 20 years, Camino Real Playhouse has ventured outdoors to do summer productions of Shakespeare. In 2015, while preparing to present “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” in Historic Town Center Park, director Dan Blackley asked why the playhouse doesn’t do “The Curse of Capistrano.”\n\n“What?” came the reply from Scott and Beverly Blake, co-founders of Camino Real. They were intrigued.\n\nThe story line and the outdoor setting in a park barely a block from the church bells of historic Mission San Juan Capistrano seemed irresistible. So Blackley and Kyle Seitz set out to craft a script from McCulley’s original words. Walter Molina, on Spanish guitar, flavors the scenes with live music.\n\nThough silver-screen portrayals of Zorro have tended to place the story around the Pueblo of Los Angeles, Scott said that, during the Spanish era, the vast domain of Los Angeles covered what is now Orange County and San Juan’s landmark mission.\n\nThe actor who portrays Zorro, who won’t be named here to preserve the plot, said that eight weeks of endurance training and fight choreography to prepare for the role were challenging. “I found out how out of shape I was,” he said. He gained muscle mass and lost nearly 10 pounds.\n\nLearning to swordfight and use the whip were fun, he said, and the swordfights are choreographed so well that what might seem dangerous is actually a well-rehearsed art form.\n\n“It’s like a dance,” he said, “except instead of stepping on each others’ toes, we could stab each other. It requires a lot of practice.”\n\nThe swords used are not as sharp as a normal one, but they still could cut, the actor said. “We remain connected throughout the entire performance,” he said. “And then (it’s) hours upon hours upon hours of practice.”"
