        "text": "So, if the greenery scenes above weren't filmed at the actual cave, where were they filmed? Maybe they were filmed at the Disney studio, and indeed this link...\n\nThe Mark of Zorro Johnston McCulley Forge Books @ Books and knowledge\n\n... contains the following message from a certail Jamail:\n\n\"One of the highlights of my life was an employee tour of the Walt Disney Studio when I got to walk up to a bushy outgrowth on the perimeter of the studio property, which turned out to be the area where Zorro was filmed emerging from the cave on Toronado.\"\n\nI tried contacting her for more details, but so far I have been unable to do so. Maybe someone else will know something about these employee tours.\n\nThe first question regarding 1x02 has already been answered, and it that case it has been determined that those scenes were all shot in the real cave. Anyway, I succeeded in contacting Jamil last month, and what she told me helped me understand the truth about the exterior of the cave shown in episode 1x08. These are her words:\n\nNot every day that one gets a message from El Zorro. I first visited the studio in 1986; it was a perk that Disneyland employees could take advantage of. We could have an all day visit to the valley which encompassed visiting the original studio, WED Enterprises (now Imagineering), MAPO (where the animatronic figures were actually built), and the old animation facility (before the current facility was built across from the original studio lot). The \"cave exit\" location was actually along the interior studio perimeter on the north side of the property bordering Alameda. There was a lot of ivy and other landscaping there. For all I know, the groundsmen may have added a landscaped rigging in order to make room for the horse and rider - for a giggle, across the grass from this spot was a fence and the facades of backs of houses that were built for the film \"Down and Out in Beverly Hills,\" used for backyard exteriors (including the structure used as a home minaret for the neighbor who regularly performed the Muslim call to prayer). There's been a huge parking structure in the cave exit spot since the early 90s, and I believe the area where the BH houses were is now the plaza in front of the Team Disney Burbank building. We had a company employee from Cast Activities who took us around to all four locations and explained their significance. I was really bummed because we missed out on the exterior Zorro sets - the facades making up the whole of El Pueblo de Los Angeles had been torn down the previous year. That entire section was filled with portables (along with the fountain from Splash). Looking at a satellite photo of the lot, it appears that the entire backlot is now gone - in addition to the Zorro sets, there had been a Western portion of the backlot, as well as a sort of suburban anytown area - only the suburban portion was left, including a large gazebo bandstand, in 86. I worked for the company for 14 years, from 1984 forward, and made several visits to the studio lot, but that first visit was the only time I got to see the area where Zorro rode out. BTW, if you ever get the chance, the Walt Disney Family Museum in San Francisco has Guy William's black and silver saddle on display in a corridor which is faced by a glass wall which allows you to see the Golden Gate Bridge. I was really happy to see it, along with some blow-ups of Guy on Toronado, representing the series. For more info, I would suggest billcotter.com - he's written some Zorro and Disney related books, and Guy William's son Steve does visual effects now with his company zorrofx.com.\n\nMego Madness! My favorite heroes!\n\nSpeaking of Zorro toys...\n\nHere's an old Disney era Zorro action figure... only 7K$ - http://www.ebay.com/itm/Palitoy-Meg...nFigures_ActionFigures_JN&hash=item27ece57712\n\nAt first I thought $700.00 that's crazy Who would pay for that!! but it's actually 7,000.00 WTF$\n\nCool Box Art!\n\nWow, thanks for the link. I just bought it with my lunch money, ....Just kidding t:\n\nNow go play with the 7k figure through the dirt, pull his arms to see how far before they snap, put the sword in fire to see if it melts, and cut up the box to make his fort!\n\nProbably why this thing is apparently so valuable now. Back then who the heck saved/protected a toy and kept the freakin box.\n\nI think these Palitoy were English licensing Mego...\n\nApparently Disney expanded on and kept the Zorro license going a lot longer in Europe than in the US. Don't know if it was even more popular there, with it's own life [like the Phantom]or it just went on longer?\n\nI think the above one is English. And there a French/Spanish/Italian/latin American versions too.\n\nI was surprised to see this in the style of Mego's secret Identity Bruce Wayne.\n\nFor Disney Zorro they did a secret identity Don Diego.\n\nStraight from the Guy Williams version, even with guitar.\n\n...\n\nFound this pi on the net....there was no info with it.\n\nYeah he came up earlier: links above,\n\nThat's a great vintage Mego/Palitoy figure and love the box art.\n\nIt was part of Mego / Palitoy (British (European market)subsidiary) 8\" line. - Mego Figures in the United Kingdom I Palitoy I Denys Fisher I Fist Fighters\n\nAccording to the site \"There are less than ten boxed Zorro figures known to exist in the world\"\n\nProbably (plus being officially licensed Disneyana merch) why authentic ones tend to fetch such exorbitant prices.\n\nAlways wish they'd released an official Tornado figure to go with him, Mego did have several color horses compatible with their 8\" line, but never (as far as I know) one officially branded as Tornado!\n\nI'm glad you mentioned that movie thread....I thought I had seen pics of it in this thread but couldn't find it in here. Here's a link to the other thread The All Encompassing Zorro thread\n\nLOL That's great, Wasn't that the Zorro movie reboot thread? Did you just change the title of It ?\n\nThe title always bugged me as it started about the the potential movie based on the Allende novel. Which wouldn't really have been so much a reboot, it (the Novel) was an origin tale, for the Diego De La Vega character not the Alejandro (Banderas) character. It actually allowed for and designed to acknowledge De La Vega through Fairbanks, Powers, Guy Williams , as the same character without much conflict, and eventually lead right into the Anthony Hopkins version as still the same De La Vega . So it wasn't so much a reboot , as just an extended origin for the same. .\n\nThen the thread got conflated with the potential sequel movie, of a future post apocalyptic Zorro, passing the mantle to a young women. (I'm actually glad that was canned). .\n\nIt being titled a more general Zorro movie discussion thread now, seems more appropriate.\n\nAs it also included discussion on Fairbanks, the movie Serials, Powers, etc.... The new \"All Encompassing\" title makes more sense!\n\nWhat other secret powers do you have?\n\nCan you fix all my sadly broken image links throughout that thread and this one?\n\nWilmer Valderrama to Star in “Telenovela Style” ‘Zorro’ Update for Disney – The Hollywood Reporter\n\nAfter over 60 years, Zorro franchise (their first masked hero) finally back at Disney.\n\n\" \"\n\nValderrama wouldn't have been my first choice, but I can see it, he's got a bit of Armando Catalano spark.\n\nPlus if they are going full telenovela, this isn't a grim dark , but more charming fun take, he could be right for it.\n\nIf anyone watched the Telumundo Zorro Telenovela, it was actually pretty fun. Had elements from the original McCulley pulps, referenced the Disney version as well as (if the licence rights are coming through Gertz Zorro prod.) include the rights to the Allende Novel, which expands on his origin, so we might finally get the first in universe filmed flashbacks to the origins of Zorro.\n\nHe's the product of a powerful clash of two distinct worlds and cultures, by way of his mother native American channeling his spirit animal the fox, and by way of his father the Spanish sword, come together in his new identity.\n\nStarted a new thread for it- Zorro back at Disney starring Valderrama\n\nYet seeing as it's Disney Zorro again, this still might be the official thread for it? Don't know what's better?\n\nIf nothing else, being Disney's original masked action hero, I do hope they come full circle and Zorro again has a presence through the Disneyland parks! I'd go just to see them reintroduce Zorro's fight and stunt show ....\n\nWith all the heroes and adventures Disney has since acquired, Star Wars, Marvel, etc. while things always \"evolve\", get fantastic new suits, coat of paint and ever grander effects, it is interesting how little actually \"changes\".\n\nThe more things change...\n\n1950s\n\n2020s\n\nMeet your Hero;\n\n1950s\n\n2020s\n\nHeroes in training ;\n\n1950s Training Little Zorritos\n\nTraining little Jedi padwans\n\nTraining little Avengers:\n\nSwing down into action! Stunt show:\n\n1950s Frontier Land\n\n2000s\n\nSpectacular sword fight!\n\n1950s Frontier/Adventure Land...\n\n2000s Galaxy's Edge... Avengers Campus...\n\nThe more things stay the same."
