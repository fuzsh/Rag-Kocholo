        "text": "1987 film by James L. Brooks\n\nBroadcast NewsDirected byJames L. BrooksWritten byJames L. BrooksProduced byJames L. BrooksStarringCinematographyMichael BallhausEdited byRichard MarksMusic byBill Conti\n\nProduction\n\ncompany\n\nDistributed by20th Century Fox\n\nRelease date\n\nRunning time\n\n133 minutesCountryUnited StatesLanguageEnglishBudget$15 million[1]Box office$67.3 million\n\nBroadcast News is a 1987 American romantic comedy-drama film written, produced and directed by James L. Brooks. The film concerns a virtuoso television news producer (Holly Hunter) who has daily emotional breakdowns, a brilliant yet prickly reporter (Albert Brooks), and the latter's charismatic but far less seasoned rival (William Hurt). It also stars Robert Prosky, Lois Chiles, Joan Cusack, and Jack Nicholson.\n\nThe film was acclaimed by critics and at the 60th Academy Awards received seven nominations, including Best Picture. In 2018, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"[2][3][4]\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nJane Craig is a talented, intense news producer who is passionate about reporting and abhors the trend towards soft news in broadcasts. Her best friend and collaborator, Aaron Altman, is a gifted writer and reporter lacking in social skills. The two work in the Washington, D.C. bureau of a national TV network. The bureau hires Tom Grunick, a local news anchor who is handsome, likable, and telegenic but lacks news experience and isn't especially bright.\n\nAaron and Jane go to Nicaragua to report on the Sandinista rebels and get caught up in a shooting battle between them and the contras, bringing home footage that wins the approval of their national anchor. At an office party, news arrives of a Libyan plane having bombed a U.S. military base in Italy. The network chief decides to air a special report, with Tom as anchor and Jane as executive producer. Aaron is devastated at Tom's selection. Watching from his home, he calls Jane with pertinent information, which she feeds to Tom through his earpiece. With the combination of Tom's on-camera poise and Jane's hard-news skills, the report is a great success. Their teamwork also intensifies their mutual attraction.\n\nWanting to complete a story without outside assistance, Tom creates a piece on date rape that includes an interview with a rape victim, where Tom is shown tearing up in reaction. In the face of potential layoffs, Aaron receives an opportunity to anchor the weekend news due to most of his colleagues going to the White House Correspondents' Dinner. He seeks advice from Tom, who encourages Aaron to be more salesman-like in his approach. Aaron takes Tom's advice but during the broadcast begins sweating uncontrollably, resulting in a disastrous broadcast. Meanwhile, Jane and Tom progress romantically at the White House Correspondents' Dinner. But before things get more involved, Jane leaves to console Aaron. The two have a heated argument, where Aaron tells Jane that Tom represents everything she hates about the direction of news media. He also tells Jane that he is in love with her.\n\nThe layoffs hit the network, resulting in many colleagues losing their jobs. Tom is moved to the London office, indicating that he is being groomed for a national anchor position; Jane is promoted to bureau chief. Tom and Jane agree to take a romantic getaway together before starting their new jobs. Aaron tells Jane he plans to take a job at a television station in Portland, Oregon. Before he leaves, he tells Jane that Tom's tears during his date-rape piece were staged; reviewing the footage, Jane realizes that he is correct. She angrily confronts Tom at the airport, saying that his actions were a breach of journalistic ethics and that she cannot in good conscience become involved with him. Tom argues with her but relents, leaving Jane behind.\n\nThe three meet again seven years later. Tom has taken over as national anchor, Aaron has a wife and child, and Jane has a new boyfriend. Jane plans to take a managing editor role for the network in New York, working with Tom again. Tom leaves after Jane declines a dinner invitation with him and his fiancée, while she and Aaron catch up on their respective lives.\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nProduction\n\n[edit]\n\nThe score was by Bill Conti. Emmy Award-winning composers Glen Roven and Marc Shaiman make cameo appearances as a dorky musician team who have composed a theme for the news program in the film.\n\nThe character of Jane Craig was based on journalist and news producer Susan Zirinsky. She served as associate producer and technical advisor for the film.[5] The female lead was originally written for Debra Winger, who worked with James L. Brooks in Terms of Endearment. However, Winger became pregnant and was replaced by Holly Hunter just two days before filming began. Sigourney Weaver, Dianne Wiest, Jessica Lange, Elizabeth Perkins, and Mary Beth Hurt were also considered for the role.[6] Brooks originally wrote the role of Aaron Altman specifically for his longtime friend Albert Brooks in mind. Principal photography began in Washington, D.C. on February 2, 1987, officially wrapping in April 1987 after filming several scenes in Florida.[7]\n\nReception\n\n[edit]\n\nBox office\n\n[edit]\n\nBroadcast News was given a limited release on December 16, 1987, in seven theaters and managed to gross USD $197,542 on its opening weekend.[8] It went into wide release in the United States on December 25, 1987, in 677 theaters, grossing $5.5 million on its opening weekend. The film went on to make $51.3 million in North America and $16.1 million in the rest of the world for a worldwide total of $67.3 million.[9]\n\nCritical response\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm critic Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film four out of four stars and praised the film for being as \"knowledgeable about the TV news-gathering process as any movie ever made, but it also has insights into the more personal matter of how people use high-pressure jobs as a way of avoiding time alone with themselves\".[10] In his review for The New York Times, Vincent Canby wrote, \"As the fast-talking Aaron, Albert Brooks comes very close to stealing Broadcast News. Mr. Brooks ... is more or less the conscience of Broadcast News\".[11] Jonathan Rosenbaum, in his review for the Chicago Reader, praised Holly Hunter's performance as \"something of a revelation: her short, feisty, socially gauche, aggressive-compulsive character may be the most intricately layered portrait of a career woman that contemporary Hollywood has given us\".[12]\n\nHal Hinson, in his review for The Washington Post, wrote, \"[James] Brooks is excellent at taking us inside the world of television, but not terribly good at analyzing it. He has a facile, too-pat approach to dealing with issues; there's still too much of the sitcom mentality at work\".[13] In his review for Time, Richard Corliss praised William Hurt's performance: \"Hurt is neat too, never standing safely outside his character, always allowing Tom to find the humor in his too-rapid success, locating a dimness behind his eyes when Tom is asked a tough question -- and for Tom, poor soulless sensation-to-be, all questions are tough ones\".[14] The magazine also ranked Broadcast News as one of the best films of the year.[15] The film garnered a 98% rating at Rotten Tomatoes from 52 critics. The site's consensus states: \"Blockbuster dramatist James L. Brooks delivers with Broadcast News, fully entertaining with deft, deep characterization.\"[16] The film has an 84% average score at Metacritic, based on 16 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".[17]\n\nBroadcast News was placed on 61 \"ten-best\" lists, making it the most acclaimed film of 1987.[18]\n\nAccolades\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Category Nominee(s) Result Academy Awards[19] Best Picture James L.
