It was written by Robert Stone, based on his 1967 novel A Hall of Mirrors. The story involves a radio station in New Orleans with the eponymous call sign that is apparently involved in a right-wing conspiracy. It culminates with a riot and stampede at a patriotic pep rally when an assassin on a catwalk opens fire.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nA drifter named Rheinhardt arrives in New Orleans. Seeing a familiar name on a shelter, he goes inside and sees that his old acquaintance Farley is running a scam as a preacher. Farley owes Rheinhardt money and pays some of it. Rheinhardt goes to a bar, where he sees a woman named Geraldine threatened by a pimp who thinks that she is trying to turn tricks on his turf.\n\nRheinhardt and Geraldine move in together, living in cheap housing surrounded by hippies. He gets a job at a conservative talk radio station called WUSA. The owner, Bingamon, is a white supremacist. He uses the station to spread propaganda, with the constant refrain that something is wrong in the country and that things were better in the past.\n\nRheinhardt reads the station's reactionary editorials while he socializes with hippies who detest it. One of his neighbors is an earnest man named Rainey, whose job is to survey welfare recipients. Rainey relies on a wealthy man named Clotho to guide him to beneficiaries. Clotho introduces Rainey to several people who are scamming the welfare system.\n\nRainey eventually discovers that Clotho is working for Bingamon, making sure that Rainey's survey find rampant fraud. WUSA will then use that fraud as content for their editorials. The more that Rainey learns about Bingamon's machinations, the more horrified he becomes. When Bingamon hosts a hate rally, Rainey tries to assassinate him. During the ensuing chaos, Rainey attempts to flee with his gun, but the crowd beats him to death.\n\nRheinhardt is ordered to the lectern to calm the crowd, but he makes a speech that only adds to the din. As Geraldine flees the rally, she is arrested and found with marijuana. Threatened with years in jail for felony possession, she hangs herself in a cell. Rheinhardt visits her grave before leaving town as cynical as he was when he arrived.[1]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nPaul Newman as Rheinhardt\n\nJoanne Woodward as Geraldine\n\nAnthony Perkins as Morgan Rainey\n\nLaurence Harvey as Farley\n\nPat Hingle as Matthew Bingamon\n\nDon Gordon as Bogdanovich\n\nMichael Anderson, Jr. as Marvin\n\nLeigh French as Girl\n\nBruce Cabot as King Wolyoe\n\nCloris Leachman as Philomene\n\nMoses Gunn as Clotho\n\nWayne Rogers as Minter\n\nRobert Quarry as Jack Noonan\n\nSkip Young as Representative Jimmy Snipe\n\nB.J.

I suspect Stone wins out, for WUSA feels more like poor theater than poor moviemaking—so, that it continually suggests a failed version of The Balcony, even though it strives to fall short of The Manchurian Candidate...Despite its obsession with collecting evidence, and its handy school of pseudo-documentary, WUSA fights unreal battles with an unseen enemy. Lacking either the grace of art or the vitality of guerrilla theater, it can offer only the coarsest nourishment—and only to the elaborately self-deceived.\"[3]\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]"
