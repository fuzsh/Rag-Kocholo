        "text": "We critics tend to focus a lot on directors and actors, but Twentieth Century Fox’s remarkably consistent product during the studio era was defined just as much by its ace cinematographers, particularly its black-and-white master Arthur Miller and his color counterpart, Leon Shamroy (seen here with Roddy McDowell on the set of the original “Planet of the Apes”).\n\nShamroy received 18 Oscar nominations for his gorgeous cinematography, all but three of them for his exemplary color work (which was a separate category from b/w during his most active years). As it happens, two of Shamroy’s four Oscar winners (1945’s “Leave Her to Heaven” and 1963’s “Cleopatra”) are newly arrived on Blu-ray, and both are worth owning just to study Shamroy’s skill with creating mood, character and a vivid sense of time and place through flawless lighting and camera placement.\n\nTwilight Time, the invaluable boutique label that has already put out stunning upgrades for two Shamroy-shot titles, “The Egyptian” and “Beloved Infidel,” is behind the release of “Leave Her to Heaven.” You might wonder why Fox — which recently put out a Blu-ray of the very creaky early talkie western “In Old Arizona” (1929) — would be licensing out its top box-officer grosser of the 1940s, and indeed the most popular of all the films we now call noir at the time of its original release, for a limited edition of 3,000 copies. But don’t look a Technicolor gift horse in the mouth — just grab a copy of this exemplary transfer before it goes out of print, as sometimes happens with Twilight Time.\n\nI’ve written lots about this particular title, a personal favorite that premiered on Christmas Day 1945 at Manhattan’s long-gone Roxy Theatre. Let’s just say that Gene Tierney gives the performance of her career (it was her only Oscar nomination) as a woman so obsessed with her new husband (Cornel Wilde) that she tries to focus his attention on her by drowning his crippled brother (Darryl Hickman), throws herself down a flight of stars to induce an abortion — and them frames her husband for her death-by-poison after suspecting poor Cornel is more interested in her sister (Jeanne Crain). The prosecuting attorney is Gene’s ex-fiance, played by an understated Vincent Price with one of the best Maine accents I’ve ever heard.\n\nShamroy and the underrated director, melodrama master John M. Stahl (his “Imitation of Life” and “Magnicent Obsession” were remade in the 1950s by Douglas Sirk) stage these events for maximum, censor-baiting chilling impact without ever going over the top. Fox’s old Studio Classics DVD of this title was one of their best from the three-strip Technicolor era — only the transfer of “The Black Swan” (Shamroy’s first Oscar winner) surpassed it. But this new\n\nBlu-ray of “Heaven” positively takes your breath away, especially during the closeups of Tierney (seen here in a frame grab from DVD Beaver) one of the great photographic subjects of Hollywood’s Golden Era. (Joseph LaShelle won an Oscar for shooting her in black-and-white in 1944’s “Laura,” and there were nominations for two other Fox cinematographers during the same decade, Edward Cronjager photographing Tierney in three-strip for “Heaven Can Wait” — which cries out for a Blu-ray upgrade from Criterion — and Charles Lang for 1947’s “The Ghost and Mrs. Muir,” which was in black-and-white).\n\nYou could actually watch “Leave Her to Heaven” with the sound off — or better still, with Twilight Time’s trademark optional isolated soundtrack of Alfred Newman’s memorable score — just to savor the Oscar-nominated production design and sets. I’ve said before this is the only movie I’ve ever seen that I wish I could live in, and the high-def transfer brings textures (like the flocking on the wallpaper in the Bar Harbor house) alive in both the interiors and exteriors scenes of a movie that, unusually for the era, employs practically no trick photography that I could make out. It’s a treat. The special features, ported over from the DVD, include a commentary track with Hickman and film historian Richard Schickel.\n\nFox itself, meanwhile, has given royal treatment to “Cleopatra,” which is being released on Blu-ray in the U.S. for the first time today just ahead of the 50th anniversary of its premiere next month. Shamroy won his fourth and last Oscar for shooting in DeLuxe Color and 70mm Todd AO — a grueling job given the film’s troubled production history and a leading lady (Elizabeth Taylor) whose weight and health wildly fluctuated during an 18-month shoot. She rarely looked better on screen.\n\nSuch was Shamroy’s reputation that director Joseph L. Mankiewicz and producer Walter Wanger took him seriously when Shamroy demanded that shooting of Cleopatra’s entrance into Rome — which had been all set up to go — had to be postponed for six months (at great cost) until the light in the real Rome (where the film was mostly shot at Cinecetta) was exactly right.\n\nA much finer and more entertaining film than its reputation as a megaflop would suggest, “Cleopatra” holds up much better than many of the era’s other historical epics thanks to Mankiewicz’ writing and Rex Harrison’s witty performance as Caesar, which dominates the film’s first half. After intermission, it’s the Liz and Richard Burton’s randy Marc Antony with combustible chemistry. The transfer is excellent, highlighting Shamroy’s trademark high-key lighting and perhaps the best color rendition of a film shot in the notoriously fading-prone Deluxe that I’ve seen.\n\nThe film is spread over two Blu-ray discs, with an extensive suite of features carried over from DVD. They include an excellent feature-length documentary commissioned by AMC in 2001 that includes outtakes from the film’s false start in England, when Jack Hilyard was the cinematographer for the original director, Rouben Mamoulian.\n\nMany of Shamroy’s Fox titles have been turning up at his former employer’s 11-month-old manuacture-on-demand program the Fox Cinema Archives. He’d probably be even more aggravated than classic film collections and the extremely variable quality of the off-the-shelf transfers being offered for sale, some of which fall far below the high bar set by Fox’s DVD titles at retail. They go all the way back to his black-and-white debut “The Story of Alexander Graham Bell” (1939), which looks fine, and “Little Old New York” (1940), which looks like something you might have caught on WNEW on the 1960s (minus the commercials). While it’s great that Fox has been making lots of deep catalogue titles available, the program really cries out for more rigorous quality control if it’s going to become as popular as the Warner Archive Collection (which also had problems during its first few months).\n\nShamroy would definitely be apoplectic if he could see the FCA versions of Michael Curtiz’ musical bio-pic “The Best Things in Life Are Free” (1956) and Henry King’s F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “Tender is the Night” (1961), which destroy his CinemaScope compositions with ancient pan-and-scan transfers showcasing images so murky they’ve virtually unwatchable. At least Fox is promising letterboxed versions of two early Cinemascope vehicles for Tyrone Power, “King of the Khyber Rifles” (1953) and “Untamed” (1955) for next week.\n\nLess violence has been done to Shamroy’s pre-scope work, though as I reported recently, the colors in the FCA transfer of King’s bio-pic “Wilson” (for which Shamroy won an Oscar a year before “Leave Her to Heaven”) are slightly faded. They’re brighter in another FCA title I’ve reviewed, the musical “Where Do We Go From Here?” if still notably less sharp than in Fox’s retail releases.\n\nI also checked a pair of dramatic Technicolor vehicles for the comic actor David Wayne shot by Shamroy. King’s “Wait ‘Till the Sun Shines Nellie” (1952) is ironically (given the title) the darkest-looking Technicolor title I’ve seen from this program; even with the brightness control on my TV turned up, it was hard to see what Wayne’s small-town barber was up, though i didn’t stick it out for the half-century the film covers. Considerably brighter, but still a bit on the murky side, was Mitchell Leisen’s “Tonight We Sing” (1953), a hodgepodge of classic musical numbers starring a hilariously miscast Wayne (with the worst Russian accent I’ve ever heard) as impresario Sol Hurok (and Anne Bancroft as Mrs. H).\n\nAmong the best-looking titles in the FCA catalogue are Betty Grable musicals, some of which were apparently prepared for an abortive second box set devoted to the star that was rumored to be in the works before Fox abandoned retail DVD releases of catalogue titles. Two were shot by Shamroy. George Seaton’s “The Shocking Miss Pilgrim” with Gershwin tunes has a couple of overly dark scenes, but at least it overall looks like what you’d expect from a Fox Technicolor musical of this era.\n\nConsistently better is the transfer for “That Lady in Ermine” (1948) — Grable never looked more ravishing than in her (very unlikely) dual role as an 18th-century Italian princess and the ancestor who inspires her to save her kingdom from a handsome Hungarian invader (Douglas Fairbanks Jr). This much-filmed fantasy operetta — outfitted with new songs by Friedrich Hollander and Leo Robin — started shooting under Ernst Lubitsch, who died eight days into production. It was completed by Otto Preminger, who didn’t take a directorial credit for this minor but enjoyable effort, shot in Leon Shamroy’s inimitable style.\n\nSpeaking of Lubitsch, a remastered version The Master’s penultimate musical, “The Merry Widow” (1934) starring Maurice Cheavalier and Jeanette MacDonald, make its DVD bow today at the Warner Archive Collection, along with William K. Howard’s “The Cat and the Fiddle” from that same year with MacDonald and Ramon Navarro, and Jack Conway’s “Let Freedom Ring” (1939) with Nelson Eddy and Virginia Bruce. They had previously been available exclusively at TCM’s e-tailing site.\n\nAlso new from WAC today are a pair of previously announced Lana Turner vehicles (“A Life of Her Own” and “Diane”) plus a raft of reissues of out-of-print titles: Robert Wise’s “Executive Suite” (1954) with an all-star cast headed by William Holden, Barbara Stanwyck and Frederic March; Victor Saville’s notorious Biblical epic “The Silver Chalice” (1954) with Virginia Mayo, Jack Palance, Pier Angeli and a debuting Paul Newman (who for years took out newspaper ads warning people not to watch it on TV), William Friedkin’s even more notorious “Cruising” (1980) starring Al Pacino and Fielder Cook’s “Big Hand for the Little Lady” (1966) with Henry Fonda, Joanne Woodward and Jason Robards.\n\nOn the Blu-ray front, Olive Films has announced the May 30 Blu-ray debuts (along with remastered DVDs) of James Edward Grant’s “The Angel and the Badman” (1947) starring John Wayne and Gail Russell; Budd Boetticher’s “Bullfighter and the Lady” (1951) with Robert Stack and Joy Page; Otto Preminger’s “The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell” (1955) with Gary Cooper and Charles Bickford; the self-directed “Cry Vengeance” (1954) starring Mark Stevens; and Delbert Mann’s “That Touch of Mink” (1962) with Cary Grant and Doris Day. A week earlier, Olive will offer Blu-ray upgrades for several Paramount titles it previously released only on DVD, including “Harlow,” “Summer and Smoke,” “WUSA” and “Once is Not Enough.”"
