        "text": "BY LEE PFEIFFER\n\nKino Lober is releasing a number of value-priced Blu-ray double features with similarly-themed films. Among them is the combo of \"Betsy's Wedding\" and \"Holy Matrimony\". The first movie is a 1990 release starring and directed by Alan Alda, who had directed three previous feature films. Anyone who has been involved in planning a wedding knows that the old adage \"The more the merrier!\" rings hollow. In fact, the logistics of planning a wedding can become increasingly complicated and frustrating in direct correlation with the number of well-meaning people who decide to involve themselves. There's always the risk that the betrothed couple will be overwhelmed by logistics and that the wedding plans are catered to please everyone but them. Such is the case in \"Betsy's Wedding\". Alda is cast as Eddie Hopper, a successful real estate speculator who invests money in building homes that he hopes to sell for a quick profit. Lately, however, his instincts have been troublesome and his latest venture is proving to be a white elephant that is draining his savings. At the same time, his youngest daughter Betsy (Molly Ringwald) and her boyfriend Jake (Dylan Walsh) announce they intend to get married. Both are left-wing progressives who are also social activists who disdain blatant displays of wealth. They want a low-key civil ceremony with only a handful of guests. However, Eddie and his wife Lola (Madeline Kahn) argue that a much grander, traditional wedding is called for so as not to offend family members. Their resistance worn down, Betsy and Jake reluctant concede, which opens a Pandora's Box of bad luck for all involved. Eddie can't afford to put on the wedding he has lobbied for so he turns to his brother-in-law Oscar (Joe Pesci), a slimy business \"tycoon\" who, in reality, is also short of cash. Since he can't find the money to lend Eddie for the wedding, he introduces him to a local mob boss, Georgie (Burt Young), who puts up the funds but then integrates himself into Eddie's life and plans for the wedding. A parallel story line centers on Eddie and Lola's other daughter Connie (Ally Sheedy), a New York City police officer who is stuck in a perpetual mode of depression, shying away from people and bruised by the fact that her younger sister will marry before she does. She is elevated from the blues by Georgie's bodyguard Stevie Dee (Anthony Lapaglia), a slick mobster who sounds like Rocky Balboa on steroids but who curiously speaks to everyone with excessive politeness. Has is obsessed with Connie and slowly but surely succeeds in wooing her into coming out of her shell. As the wedding date nears, the pressure mounts on everyone. Eddie's business dealings with George almost get him assassinated in an attempted mob hit, Betsy and Jake are barely on speaking terms and on the wedding day and a torrential rain storm threatens to collapse the large tent structure the reception is being held in. Eddie receives solace from imaginary conversations with his dear, departed father (Joey Bishop).\n\n\"Besty's Wedding\" was not well-received by critics or audiences back in the day and proved to be the final feature film to date directed by Alan Alda. Yet, I found it to be consistently funny and Alda excels as both actor and director, milking maximum laughs from an inspired cast. The scene-stealer is Lapaglia, one of the few cast members to receive kudos from reviewers. His sensitive tough guy routine is both amusing and endearing. The film isn't hilarious at any point but it's never less than entertaining, as you might imagine any movie that teams Joe Pesci and Burt Young would be.\n\n\"Holy Matrimony\" was unceremoniously dumped by Disney into a handful of theaters in 1994 before being relegated to home video. It's total theatrical gross in North America was about $700,000. As with \"Betsy's Wedding\", it was directed by a popular actor, in this case Leonard Nimoy. Ironically, just as \"Betsy's Wedding\" represented Alda's last direction (to date) of a feature film, so too did \"Holy Matrimony\" mark Nimoy's last directorial effort on the big screen. The premise is hardly original, centering on a protagonist who seeks shelter in a religious community to evade pursuers. This plot device dates back to the 1940s with John Wayne in \"Angel and the Badman\" and its unacknowledged 1984 remake \"Witness\". Here we find Patricia Arquette as Havana, a sultry young woman from the other side of the tracks who is fed up with being exploited by performing provocative routines at a carnival tent located in a fairgrounds. She is paid a miserly wage by the owner who she comes to resent. She and her equally impoverished boyfriend Peter (Tate Donovan) rob the owner and flee in their car, but not before being identified. With the police searching for them, they cross into Canada and take refuge in an Amish-like religious colony where Peter was raised before leaving for the outside world. They pretend to want to immerse themselves in the rustic lifestyle but Havana's coarse nature and foul mouth make the elders suspicious of their motives. Peter hides the cache of stolen loot but before he can divulge its location to Havana, he is killed in an automobile accident. The colony elders view this as a way to get rid of Havana by informing her that customs dictate that she must marry Peter's brother, in this case twelve year-old Ezekiel (Joseph Gordon-Levitt). However, Havana- who needs to stay until she can locate the stash of hidden money- agrees to the arrangement, much to the shock of all involved- especially young Ezekiel who is appalled at having to be married at such a young age. The film deftly handles the possible distasteful elements of this reverse \"Lolita\" situation by making it clear that both husband and wife sleep in separate rooms. The one funny sex gag involves Ezekiel trying to impress his friends that he is satisfying his new wife only to have the scenario backfire much to his embarrassment when it is revealed he is actually in the bedroom alone.\n\nMuch of what follows is predictable. As with all movie plots in which the male and female protagonists start off hating each other, there is no doubt that Havana and Ezekiel will grow to respect and like each other, with Havana acting more like a big sister than a wife. Once the money is located, Havana is told to accompany Ezekiel back to the States to return the loot to its rightful owner. What follows is a road trip in which the two share plenty of personal thoughts and have to avoid a corrupt FBI agent (John Schuck), who is hot on their trail, determined to steal the money for himself. The story climaxes back at the state fair where Havana originally worked. She's now determined to return the stolen money, all the while trying to evade the police and the FBI guy who are hot on her trail. Director Nimoy capably blends both sentiment and comedy during the course of the film, though the movie's main attributes are the performances by Arquette and especially young Gordon-Levitt who shows star power even at this early stage of his career. There is also a very fine performance by Armin-Mueller Stahl as the elder of the religious community. Refreshingly, the film doesn't mock or humiliate the members of the religious colony. Rather, it is \"fish-out-of-water\" Havana who bears the brunt of most of the humor. While \"Holy Matrimony\" is nothing very special, it does seem to have suffered an undeserved fate by being released to only a small number of theaters. It is certainly on par with most mid-range comedies but apparently Disney felt it had very little boxoffice appeal.\n\nThe Kino Lorber Blu-ray combo features very fine transfers of both films and includes their original trailers.

Yet, that didn't stop studios from beating a dead horse in an attempt to squeeze some more juice out of the tried-and-true formula of gathering an all-star cast, then figuring out ways to drown, bury or incinerate the characters portrayed on screen. One of the more obscure attempts to keep the disaster film cycle relevant was \"Avalanche\", a movie produced by Roger Corman and directed and scripted by one of his proteges, Corey Allen, who would go on to establish a respectable career as a director of major television shows. When you approach a Corman production, you tend to give some special dispensation for certain cinematic sins that you wouldn't accord more mainstream productions. Corman, who happily embraces his legendary status as a man who made major profits from films with minor budgets, knew how to stretch the soup in the cinematic sense. Rarely armed with ample production funds, Corman cut corners whenever possible but still managed to retain a certain elegance to his productions. In 1978, he jumped on the fading disaster movie bandwagon with \"Avalanche\". He hired Rock Hudson as the leading man because Hudson, at this point in his career, realized that he was no longer a hot commodity as a boxoffice draw in feature films (although he did successfully transition to a popular presence on television.) Corman also cast Mia Farrow and respected supporting actor Robert Forster for additional name recognition. He secured permission to film at a major ski resort in Durango, Colorado and out-sourced the special effects work to a company called Excelsior!\n\nThe film follows the general formula of the disaster film genre in that the victims-to-be are gathered for a major social occasion, unaware that nature is working overtime to thwart their fun. Rock Hudson plays David Shelby, an arrogant developer who has invested his life savings to build a vacation paradise in the Rocky Mountains. He has disdain for local environmentalists who have warned him that his destruction of an an abundance of trees on his massive property has removed a natural barrier to the inevitable avalanches that will occur. Shelby is preoccupied with his grand opening festivities and is simultaneously trying to woo back his ex-wife Caroline (Mia Farrow), who is attending as his guest. He's also busy trying to entertain his sassy, wise-cracking mother, Florence (Jeanette Nolan), who is being shepherded around the resort by David's major domo Henry McDade (Steve Franken in a rare dramatic role.) Meanwhile, local environmental activist and nature photographer Nick Thorne (Robert Forster) becomes increasingly concerned about the massive buildup of snow on the mountain peaks that are directly in line with the resort. He attempts to alleviate some of the danger by strategically using a snow cannon to set off controlled mini avalanches. Intermingled with all of this are the expected subplots involving minor characters who are set up to be inevitable victims. Barry Primus is a TV sports announcer who is broadcasting from the grand opening and who must contend with the fact that his estranged wife Tina (Cathey Paine) is on premises and rubbing his nose in it by blatantly carrying on an affair with egotistical super star skier Bruce Scott (Rick Moses). Scott, in turn, is rubbing Tina's nose in it by blatantly sleeping with another woman, thus causing Tina to go ballistic and consider suicide. Meanwhile, David Shelby finds time to unwind by spending some quality time in a hot tub with with his naked secretary (thus allowing Roger Corman to slip in a bit of T&A). Although the story seems set up to have the disastrous avalanche occur during the opening night festivities, screenwriter Allen throws the audience a curve ball by avoiding that cliche and saving the action for the following afternoon when, amid a particularly vicious snow mobile race, a small plane piloted by one of Shelby's employees encounters bad weather and slams into a nearby mountain, thus triggering the avalanche. This is where the movie progresses beyond cliches and becomes unexpectedly enjoyable. All of the standard disaster movie shtick is present, as both lovable and loathsome characters meet predictable fates, but the film's limited production resources somehow work in its favor. We're well aware that we're watching a Corman production but somehow the inventiveness that is required to carry it all off is quite admirable. Certain plot points are introduced and inexplicably abandoned including an insinuation that Shelby has bribed local political officials to overlook his clear violation of environmental protection rules in order to build his resort. This was one of Rock Hudson's final films as an \"above the title\" leading man. He's grayer and a bit paunchier than we'd seen him during his heyday, but he still had star power to spare and made for a dashing leading man, whether its skinny dipping in the hot tub or personally leading rescue parties in acts of derring doo to extricate victims of the tragedy. The film's showpiece sequence is a climactic scene in which Shelby must rescue Caroline, who is dangling from wrecked bridge above a ravine. It's well-directed and genuinely suspenseful.\n\nIt' easy to pick apart a film like \"Avalanche\", as it squarely fits into the \"guilty pleasure\" category. However, the film does a lot with very little as opposed to other misfires in this genre that did very little with a lot (aka \"The Swarm\"). The Kino Lorber Blu-ray edition features the original trailer and a \"making of\" featurette in which Roger Corman extols the virtues of the film. He admits the effects were rather shoddy and recalls his outrage when he discovered the SFX company had added \"red snow\". Corman hit the roof and it was changed to a bluish substance that he admits still looks pretty phony. Robert Forster recalls that the \"snow\" was actually little pieces of plastic that were strewn by the hundreds of thousands over the scenic landscape. He remembers his dismay at the realization that none of these bits were biodegradable and many must still be contaminating the landscape of the Durango ski resort where the movie was filmed. Corman makes the claim that the film was actually a major financial success. He says his budget was only $1.7 million and that a TV sale for $2 million netted him an immediate $300,000 profit. The tale sounds a bit fanciful because it seems hard to believe that even in 1978 you could make a movie like this with three relatively big names for only $1.7 million. (Other sources give unsubstantiated estimates of the budget at around $6 million, which seems more plausible.) \"Avalanche\" is not near the top of the heap of disaster movies but it certainly doesn't rank at the bottom of the pack, either. The Kino Lorber release has an impressive transfer and the inclusion of those bonus extras make this title highly recommended for fans of this genre.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER FROM AMAZON\n\nâ€œ\n\n\"ALTMANâ€™S DOWNTON UPSTAIRS ABBEY DOWNSTAIRSâ€\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nThe magnificent Robert Altman whodunnit (or, as Altman and team called it, â€œwho cares whodunnit?â€), Gosford Park, has received a top-class Blu-ray restoration and re-issue from Arrow Academy, and it is a gem.\n\nOriginally released in 2001, Gosford Park took its cue from the immensely popular BBC television series, Upstairs, Downstairsâ€”about the dramas that exist in a stately British manor between the â€œupstairsâ€ folkâ€”the wealthy upper-class family that owns the property, and the â€œdownstairsâ€ peopleâ€”the servants and staff who run the household. Throw in a dash of Agatha Christie, and a heaping helping of Robert Altmanâ€™s ensemble improvisatory magic, and you have the directorâ€™s only full-fledged British production. Interestingly, the screenwriter, Julian Fellowes (who won the Oscar for Original Screenplay) went on to create and write the next immensely popular BBC television series, Downton Abbey, which resembles Gosford Park in many ways.\n\nFilm historians will certainly recognize the homage Altman makes in his direction of the piece to Jean Renoirâ€™s 1939 masterpiece, The Rules of the Game, a similar masters/servants ensemble work that Altman was known to admire. The tone and broad canvas with many characters and their subtle ribald and clandestine liaisons was surely a blueprint on how to do Gosford.\n\nThe work began when actor/writer/producer Bob Balaban suggested a collaboration on a film, and the idea to do an Agatha Christie-style murder mystery became the desired goal (Balaban co-produced the picture and has a prominent role as one of two Americans in the nearly all-British cast). And while the murder mystery is at the core of the film, itâ€™s really not that important. After all, this is an Altman film. Itâ€™s more about the characters, the relationships, and the exploration of what the British class system was like in the early 1930s when the U.K. was holding on to centuries-old mores and values that would soon slip away.\n\nThe story concerns wealthy businessman Sir William (Michael Gambon), who is married to younger Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas), whose sisters are married to men struggling to stay in or begin business with Sir William. One weekend, all the relations and a few guests are invited to have a â€œhunting partyâ€ (much like in The Rules of the Game), so the house if full of people and the servants are very busy. But nobody likes Sir William. After all, he has a history of impregnating servant girls and forcing them to either give up their babies to orphanages or leave their employment. (The picture has an added layer of meaning in todayâ€™s #MeToo climate!) So, when heâ€™s found deadâ€”apparently stabbed with a kitchen knifeâ€”no one is very surprised. In the last act of the story, we learn the secrets and lies of several characters, and how these all played into the scheme.\n\nThe cast is impressive. Maggie Smith (as a wickedly opinionated older relation who depends on an allowance from Sir William) was nominated for Supporting Actress, as was Helen Mirren (who plays the head housekeeper). Also on hand are Alan Bates, Emily Watson, Charles Dance, Clive Owen, Tom Hollander, Ryan Phillippe, Eileen Atkins, Derek Jacobi, Richard E. Grant, and many other familiar faces of British TV and film. Jeremy Northam portrays the real silent-film actor Ivor Novello, and Stephen Fry appears as a bumbling police inspector.\n\nThe brilliant cast and wonderful script aside, Gosford Park is assuredly Altmanâ€™s film. His style of overlapping dialogue, moving cameras throughout the house and picking up bits of business and dialogue here and there, and presenting a tapestry of words and images in which the viewer must piece together, is in full force. It works beautifully. In fact, Gosford was Altmanâ€™s second-highest grossing picture (after M*A*S*H), and it was nominated for the Oscar Best Picture and Director.\n\nArrowâ€™s brand new 2K restoration from a 4K scan, approved by director of photography Andrew Dunn, looks marvelous. There are three audio commentariesâ€”one with Altman, production designer Stephen Altman, and producer David Levy, and a second one with writer Fellowes. A third one is new to the release, featuring critics Geoff Andrew and David Thompson. Supplements include a new introduction to the film by Geoff Andrew, brand new cast and crew interviews, and port-overs from the previous DVD release: featurettes on the making of the film, deleted scenes with Altman commentary, and more. The package comes with a reversible sleeve containing the original poster art backed with new artwork by Matthew Griffin. In the first pressing of the product only, a collectorâ€™s booklet featuring new writing on the film by critic Sheila Oâ€™Malley and an archival interview with Altman is included.\n\nGosford Park was perhaps Altmanâ€™s last great picture, one that stands proudly alongside his other classics like M*A*S*H, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, Nashville, The Player, and Short Cuts.

He is a screenwriter, script consultant, and senior writer and columnist for Script magazine.

The other was, of course, â€œStar Wars.â€\n\nAs the masterwork of Douglas Trumbull, Richard Yuricich, and their great team of visual effects magicians at Future General.\n\nAs one of the most intense and honest depictions ever filmed of obsession and of the rewards and costs of pursuing a dream.\n\nAs one of the most authentic, non-idealized, and non-stereotypical depictions of American suburban life ever shown on screen.\n\nCinema Retro:Can you recall your reaction to the first time you saw â€œClose Encountersâ€?\n\nMorton:I can absolutely recall the first time I saw â€œClose Encountersâ€â€”it was the most significant movie-going experience of my life. I saw it in December 1977 at the Ridgeway Theater in Stamford, Connecticutâ€”on a school night with my sisters Kathy and Nancy.I loved the movie as a movieâ€”it was intriguing, thrilling, frightening, funny, awe-inspiring, thought-provoking, and ultimately extremely moving. But the effect â€œClose Encountersâ€ had on me went well beyond the simple enjoyment of a very good film. By the time â€œCE3Kâ€ opened, I had already been a film fan for a few years, but â€œClose Encountersâ€ is the movie that awakened me to the true power of cinema. Until that night, if you had asked the very young me what the most important ingredients in a movie were, I would have said dialogue and performance. Those things are certainly present in â€œCE3K,â€ but they are secondary. The storytelling in â€œClose Encountersâ€â€”especially in its final thirty minutesâ€”is accomplished primarily through the manipulation of the core elements of cinema: imagery, sound effects, and music. Watching the film for the first time, I found myself having a profound emotional response to Spielbergâ€™s masterful orchestration of light and soundâ€”I was filled with feelings of awe, wonder, and joy so intense they were almost spiritual. When the movie ended, I just sat staring at the screen, enraptured and unable to move as I processed the overwhelming intensity of what I had just experienced. I sat there so long that my sisters finally lost patience with me. â€œWake up!â€ my sister Nancy snapped. â€œThe movieâ€™s over!â€ That brought me back to the world, but I still hadnâ€™t come back to Earth.I realized then and there the powerful effect that movies could have on an audience â€” that in the right hands they could transcend mere storytelling and impact viewers on a much deeper and more profound level. Driving home that night (in a heavy fog that filtered the headlights of oncoming cars in ways that mimicked much of the imagery in the movie we had just seen), I knew I wanted to do something more than just watch moviesâ€”that I wanted to make a life in the cinema as well.\n\nCinema Retro: Is there any significance to â€œClose Encountersâ€?\n\nMorton:Well, itâ€™s one of the best sci-fi movies ever made, both creatively and from a production stand-point. And, as I mentioned earlier, itâ€™s one of the films that made sci-fi into a respectable genre.\n\nBeyond those two points, however, it was the first major sci-fi film to depict first contact as a potentially positive experienceâ€”that a meeting between mankind and beings from another world could be a joyous, peaceful, uplifting eventâ€”something that could be good for usâ€”rather than an occasion of invasion and horror. In the years following â€œCE3Kâ€ and especially â€œE.T.â€ that became a commonplace idea, but in 1977 it was pretty revolutionary.\n\nCinema Retro: Which edition of â€œClose Encountersâ€ do you like best?\n\nMorton:I prefer the 1977 theatrical cut, in part because itâ€™s the first version of the movie I saw and the one that made such a strong impression on me. But I also prefer it because itâ€™s the most subtle version of the film. As an example, in the scene in which Roy has his initial close encounter at the railroad crossing, as he drives off in pursuit of the UFO, the 1977 version cuts to a long shot of Royâ€™s truck driving across the landscape and in the sky above you see a little point of light moving along. Is it a UFO? Or is it just an airplane or a satellite? Weâ€™re not 100% sure and that adds some mystery and intrigue to the pictureâ€”was what we just saw happen real or did Roy perhaps imagine it? Weâ€™re not sure and neither is Roy until the three UFOs come flying around the corner in the Crescendo Summit scene a few minutes later. In the Special Edition and the 1997 Directorâ€™s Edition, that shot is replaced by the shadow of an impossibly large UFO zooming across the landscapeâ€”all of the ambiguity is gone and the point is hit right on the head that what we saw was real and that UFOs are real before they are revealed to us at Crescendo Summit. It takes a little bit of the magic out of it for me.\n\nAs technically wonderful as it is, I feel the Cotapoxi scene has similar problems. The jeeps leaping over the sand dunes in 1-2-3 formation and the helicopters zooming low across the desert feel like they belong in a slightly broader, slightly less real film than the theatrical cut is. One of the things I like so much about â€œCE3Kâ€ is that the fantastic events occur in a very real settingâ€”Royâ€™s world and Jillianâ€™s world all feel very authentic and real to meâ€”but when people are zooming around like they are in an action movie, some of that reality gets lost for me. And, as cool as seeing the ship in the desert is, the scene is really just a repeat of the opening sequence in which the airplanes are discovered, so itâ€™s a bit repetitious. I do like some of the family strife material that was put back in for the Special Edition and the Directorâ€™s Edition and some of the editing in the second act is tighter and less raggedy. But I still prefer the 1977 version. Following that I would choose the 1997 cut and then the Special Edition. (I think going inside the Mothership was always a mistake.)\n\nCinema Retro: Where do you think â€œClose Encountersâ€ ranks among Steven Spielbergâ€™s body of work?\n\nMorton:Near the top, along with â€œJaws,â€ â€œE.T.,â€ â€œRaiders,â€ â€œSchindlerâ€™s List,â€ and â€œEmpire of the Sun.â€ It has always struck me as being one of his most personal movies.\n\nBY TODD GARBARINI\n\nThe 1970â€™s were a time of much spookiness and speculation in this country. Unidentified Flying Objects (UFOâ€™s), a publicity-shy Plesiosaur called Nessie steaking out the Scottish Highlands, Sasquatch â€œsightingsâ€, ghosts, satanic cults, witchcraft, and the threat of nuclear catastrophe highlighted the newspapers when Vietnam, Richard Nixon and Watergate werenâ€™t. Between 1977 and 1982, Leonard Nimoyâ€™s narration provided the basis for nearly 150 speculative and generally outright creepy episodes of In Search Ofâ€¦Similarly-themed television specials were even categorized by TV Guide as â€œspeculationâ€ in their genre listings. I even recall a scenario in 1979 that was reported in a local newspaper concerning the discovery of ribcages and bowls of blood at a nearby campground. Yikes!\n\nMay 1970 saw the release of Hal Lindsey and Carole C. Carlsonâ€™s book The Late Great Planet Earth, a grimly-titled caveat in eschatological terms detailing the end of the world and destruction to humankind as we know it (it was followed up in 1972 with Satan Is Alive and Well on Planet Earth and in 1982 with The 1980s: Countdown to Armageddon). The genesis of this line of thinking has its roots in the Holy Bible, specifically the Book of Revelation which is the final book of the New Testament. What better way to get the word out than in a major motion picture? The book was optioned for a film in 1976 by Pacific International Enterprises, known as PIE for short, which was both a film production and distribution company founded two years earlier by Arthur R. Debs (it folded in 2001) for the purpose of releasing â€œfamily filmsâ€. How they came to the subject of Armageddon is anyoneâ€™s guess. Between 1976 and 1978, interviews were conducted with renowned thinkers, scientists and religious folks to get their views and interpretations of the Bible and the promise of pestilence.\n\nThe film sports the same title as the book and was released in a good number of neighborhood theatres on Wednesday, January 17, 1979. It opens with a sequence involving a group of men chasing a Gandalf wannabe up a mountain (in reality, Vaszquez Rocks in California where Captain James T. Kirk fought the Gorn in the Star Trek episode â€œArenaâ€ in 1966) and pushing him to his death. These are actors, of course, and they look like they might have tried out to be the apostles in Martin Scorseseâ€™s first attempt to bring The Last Temptation of Christ to the screen via Paramount Pictures on a minimal budget. Orson Welles appears with a skull meant to represent the fallen man from thousands of years earlier and sets the filmâ€™s tone by explaining how the ancient Hebrews believed that a prophet was Godâ€™s Man and spoke the Words of God, foretelling, many centuries before, of events to come. The prophet was killed because he wasnâ€™t accurate one hundred percent of the time and therefore was deemed a fraud.\n\nThe film talks of the Anti-Christ entering the world of politics â€“ shades of Omen III: The Final Conflict (1983)? There are many predictions made using stock footage to enunciate impending doom. However interesting or frightening the claims, the oratorâ€™s guessing of the timeline is vague at best. Something that was correctly predicted at the time of the filmâ€™s shooting was the estimate of the world population 40 years hence to be roughly 8 billion people. It is closer to 7.5 billion, but not a bad estimate.\n\nEarthquakes, world famine, floods, killer bees (I recall this threat in 1979 and wondered how they came about. The film provides the not-so-surprising explanation) were the stuff of disaster movies in the 1970s. Iâ€™m not sure if Planet Earth is a statement of veracity or pure bollocks, but itâ€™s an interesting examination of prophesies, nonetheless.\n\nThe film has been recently released on Blu-ray by Kino Lorber/Scorpion and the transfer is exceptional. There are two bonus features. The first is a making-of featurette that runs fourteen minutes and is comprised of interviews with nearly ten people behind-the-scenes. Roger Riddell is the filmâ€™s producer who discusses how the movie came into being. Alan Belkin, President of American Cinema, a division of American Communications Industries, shares his memories of the film. The rough cut was two hours; the filmâ€™s running time is 86 minutes. Composer Dana Kaproff provides an exceptional score that is one of the filmâ€™s strongpoints (it deserves a soundtrack album release) and he explains his role as a composer. Tom Doddington, head of Sound and Production, explains how Orson Welles was a consummate professional, going so far as to record his voiceover at his house. Thomas Nicely, one of the actors running in the opening sequence, also weighs in. Lynn McCallon and Anne Goursaud were editors on the film. Jean Higgins, Head of Production for American Cinema, and David Miller, Head of Distribution, discuss the filmâ€™s marketing.\n\nBonus features consist of a selection of trailers: theatrical trailer and TV spot for The Late Great Planet Earth (1979); Go Tell the Spartans (1978) theatrical trailer, Charlie Chan and the Curse of the Dragon Queen TV spot; The Apple (1980) theatrical trailer; and The Salamander (1981) theatrical trailer.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER FROM AMAZON\n\nBY TODD GARBARINI\n\nIf youâ€™re one of the many moviegoers who are unfamiliar with the Jacques Lacerte thriller Love Me Deadly, youâ€™re not alone. A product of early 1970s low-budget motion picture production, this film is the sole title directed by Mr. Lacerte who passed away in 1988. Lensed in 1971 and released in San Francisco right around the same time as Gerard Damianoâ€™s wildly popular and controversial couples-flick Deep Throat in June 1972 just before the Watergate burglary, the film played in roughly ten markets, including rained-out drive-ins, before it nearly disappeared from view. However, there are subsequent movie posters for the film that have the audacity to mention William Friedkinâ€™s The Exorcist (1973) and give the impression that spiritual possession is somehow to blame for the unsavory goings-on. Itâ€™s not.\n\nLove Me Deadly was originally titled Kiss Me Deadly, however Mickey Spillane had the rights to that title, hence the name change. What is billed as a story of demonic diabolical deeds is rather a heartbreakingly tragic tale of a young woman who cannot seem to connect with menâ€¦who are alive. The film never really seems to get a grip on how it wants to play out the subject matter at hand but you get the feeling that the director is attempting to pass the film off as some sort of dissertation on necrophilia which, in my humble opinion, is one of the most incomprehensible, disgusting, and desperate of all sexual proclivities and one that I can only hope is relegated to the cinema. I interpreted the film from a much different perspective, so each viewer might see something differently due to the filmâ€™s inability to construct a single tone.\n\nThe opening credits play over images of a happy young girl, Lindsay Finch, playing with her father who dotes on her, pushes her on a swing, and comforts her when she falls. As an adult, Lindsay (Mary Charlotte Wilcox) is a looker who tries her best to make friends with attractive men. She leads on Wade Farrow (the late Christopher Stone of 1981â€™s The Howling and 1983â€™s Cujo, sans his trademark â€˜stache) only to rebuff him when he makes sexual advances. Like Harold and his pal Maude, Lindsay looks through the newspapers and attends afternoon wakes of complete strangers although her reasons for doing so are far more disturbing: she attempts amorous contact with the recently deceased. While about town, she hones in on men who bear a resemblance to her father whom we can safely assume has passed. Meanwhile Fred (Timothy Scott), a funeral director of Morningside Mortuary (the name anticipates 1979â€™s Phantasm), catches her and persuades her to join him after hours in necrophilic activities with similarly afflicted gonzos who don black mass-like capes in a ritual prior to becoming intimate with corpses, the victims of Fredâ€™s nocturnal cruisings along the Sunset Strip in search of johns and prostitutes.\n\nLindsay takes a liking to Alex Martin (Lyle Waggoner) whom she sees as a father figure. They court and marry soon afterwards, although their bedroom habits suffer greatly as sheâ€™s unable to allow Alex to make love to her. Heâ€™s patient and even sleeps in another room yet becomes suspicious of his wifeâ€™s behavior when he follows her to the funeral parlor and sees her enter the premises. When he asks her about it later on, she denies going there at all. A brief conversation with the housekeeper who practically raised her leads Alex to the cemetery in the filmâ€™s most heartbreaking scene wherein Lindsay is dressed in pigtails, playing around her fatherâ€™s grave like a child. Anyone who has seen enough horror films knows how the film will end so while itâ€™s not a shocker, itâ€™s actually tragically sad given how her father died and the guilt that Lindsay feels. This is the biggest issue that I have with the film. While the ads promise one thing, what you get is something much different. The biggest evidence of this is in the inclusion of elegiac songs sung by Kit Fuller that play over the kinderscene that opens the film and the romantic silliness between she and Alex. This is, a sequence that seems to have been borrowed from the overlong romantic interlude that plagues Clint Eastwoodâ€™s otherwise crackerjack Play Misty for Me (1971), with Roberta Flack crooning on that filmâ€™s soundtrack for nearly five minutes. The original movie poster even claims that Lindsay is 18, however sheâ€™s clearly in her early to mid-twenties.\n\nBY JOHN M. WHALEN\n\nHow youâ€™ll feel about MGMâ€™s â€œThe Last Huntâ€ (1956), a grim depiction of the decimation of the buffalo herds out west in the 1880s, depends on how you feel about actually seeing buffalo shot down before your eyes while the cameras rolled. Writer/director Richard Brooks wanted the film to be a searing indictment of the men who ravaged the western frontier, especially those who made their living hunting bison. For the sake of authenticity, he and producer Dore Schary went out on location to Custer National Park, South Dakota, where they still have a small herd of buffalo. They got some spectacular footage of the buffalo stampeding over the Black Hills and had government permission to film during the annual â€œthinning of the herd,â€ when sharpshooters are invited to kill a limited number of buffs to keep them from overpopulating. As a result. there are scenes in â€œThe Last Huntâ€ in which we see buffalo hunters Charlie Gilson (Robert Taylor) and Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger) shooting down a dozen or more of the majestic beasts as they sit peacefully unaware by a watering hole. It is isnâ€™t a reenactment. Itâ€™s real and itâ€™s disturbing to watch.\n\nBut that was Brooksâ€™ intent. He wanted to show how greed and hatred of the Indian brought the buffalo to near extinction. Buffalo hides not only brought the hunters a good price but in their minds a dead buffalo meant less meat for the Indians. Brooks personifies these attitudes most vividly in the psychopathic Charlie Gilson. He is a man who hates everything, especially buffalo and Indians. He gets a real kick out of killing, too. He says it makes him feel alive. Taylor is convincing as a truly bad man, although his performance is somewhat one-dimensional. In most of the scenes, heâ€™s either drunk and surly or just plain mean and surly.\n\nOn the other hand, McKenzie is a gentler soul who only agrees to go on the hunt when his small herd of cattle is wiped out by a buffalo stampede. He has no animosity against Native Americans and keeps telling Charlie he needs to chill out. Granger gives a good performance as a nice guy, but heâ€™s almost too nice to be believable. Also in the hunting party are Lloyd Nolan as Woodfoot, a skinner with a peg leg and Russ Tamblyn as Jimmy, a redheaded half-breed, whom Charlie can barely tolerate. Woodfoot could have been an Ahab-type character with a grudge against buffalo for losing his leg, but heâ€™s more philosophical than that. Heâ€™s seen a lot. He explains Charlieâ€™s hatred for Indians to Jimmy by showing how much alike they are. He says Charlie eats without a fork, just like an Indian, heâ€™s free with his women just like an Indian, he even blows his nose in his fingers like an Indian. â€œBut you see, Charlie donâ€™t like himself very much,â€ Woodfoot says, â€œso itâ€™s only natural heâ€™d hate Indians.â€\n\nThe four men manage an uneasy coexistence until their pack mules are stolen one night by a small band of roving Indians. Sandy and Woodfoot are willing to let it go, but Charlie rides off after them with blood in his eye. He tracks them down, kills them and wounds an Indian Girl (Debra Paget) traveling with a small boy. He brings the girl and boy back to camp and beds down with her, much to Sandyâ€™s dislike. Charlie gets drunk and mistreats the girl, while Sandy seethes, but remains silent. Sandy and the Indian girl begin to get closer, however, when Charlieâ€™s not around or just passed out and tension slowly builds.\n\nThings come to a head when Sandy hesitates to shoot a white buffalo because he knows it has religious significance to the Indians. Charlie has no such qualms. He knows the hide will bring a price of $2,000. He kills it and now both the Indian girl and the white buffalo hide become the sources of conflict that eventually leads to a violent and chilling climax.\n\nâ€œThe Last Huntâ€ is an interesting film made by an interesting director. Like some of Richard Brooksâ€™ other films, such as â€œIn Cold Bloodâ€ and â€œBite the Bullet,â€ itâ€™s hard-hitting, almost merciless, in its portrayal of the darkness that lies just below the thin veneer of civilization. It could have been a classic, but it has become a victim of the era in which it was made. Itâ€™s not likely that any major studio today would release a film showing the deliberate killing of live animals, no matter what the reason. For one thing PETA would make life miserable for the film makers, and todayâ€™s audiences would most likely condemn it as well. The casting of Debra Paget as the unnamed â€œIndian Girlâ€ is another strike against it. The casting was not Richard Brooksâ€™ fault. Movie studios in 1956 never cast Native Americans in major roles. Indian characters were usually played by Mexican actors like Delores Del Rio or Gilbert Roland. Paget does a great job, but itâ€™s a false note in a film that tries so hard to be authentic.\n\nBut the biggest problems with â€œThe Last Huntâ€ is its slow pace. The film focuses too much on the five main characters bogged down in their own personal conflicts. It takes forever for McKenzie to finally have his fill of Charlieâ€™s constant bullying and mean-tempered treatment of the woman and the half-breed. Heâ€™s too mild-mannered and when the final showdown does happen itâ€™s a long, drawn out affair that lacks suspense.\n\nâ€œYOUNG REBEL WITH A MOVIE CAMERAâ€\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nArrow has released an interesting time capsule of a boxed set that features early work by director Brian De Palma and starring a very young Robert De Niro before either of them were significant names in the motion picture industry. The films are The Wedding Party (made in 1963, released in 1969), Greetings (1968), and Hi, Mom! (1970).\n\nDe Palma had embarked on a film career in the very early 1960s when he was a student at various institutions. While at Sarah Lawrence College in New York, he collaborated with then-theatre-professor Wilford Leach (who went on to become a major stage director, designer, and writer) and Cynthia Munroe (who provided much of the script and funding) to make a feature entitled The Wedding Party. Most accounts (including IMDb) state that the movie was made in 1963; however, an essay by Brad Stevens in the accompanying Blu-ray booklet claims that the film was shot in 1964-65. It was eventually copyrighted in 1966, but wasnâ€™t released until 1969, after the moderate success of De Palmaâ€™s first mainstream (of sorts) picture, Greetings (released a year earlier in â€˜68).\n\nThe most interesting thing going for The Wedding Party is that it also sports the movie debut of De Niro, as well as Jill Clayburgh, William Finley, and Jennifer Salt (although De Niroâ€™s name is misspelled in the credits as â€œDeneroâ€â€”go figure). Itâ€™s one odd little movie, very low-budget, shot in black and white, and in a style reminiscent of early silent comedies (although it has sound). In a supplemental featurette, critic and filmmaker Howard S. Berger cites Richard Lesterâ€™s The Running, Jumping, and Standing Still Film (1959) as an influence, and one can see that. There is speeded-up footage in which characters run around, jump, fall, and drive cars in a comic, Keystone Cops fashion. There is also a French New Wave feel in that the picture is full of radical jump cuts. De Niroâ€™s character, Cecil, is really a supporting role/groomsman to protagonist Charlie (Charles Pfluger), the groom of the titular event, and Josephine (Clayburgh), the bride. William Finley, who went on to star in other De Palma pictures, particularly Phantom of the Paradise, is another groomsman. The Wedding Party is a black comedy about the hypocritical rites of a wedding and the familial events leading up to it. Thereâ€™s a laugh or two.\n\nGreetings was another black comedy made in collaboration with co-writer/producer Charles Hirsch as the kind of pseudo-underground, low-budget, counterculture art film that budding filmmakers were creating to appeal to the college crowd in the late 60s (movies like Bob Rafelsonâ€™s Head or some of Roger Cormanâ€™s hippie-biker pictures come to mind). De Niro shares protagonist status with Gerrit Graham and Jonathan Warden as Jon, Lloyd, and Paul, respectively. Each young man is rebelling against society in some way. Paul wants to avoid the draft (so his pals help him be â€œgayâ€); Lloyd is obsessed with the Kennedy assassination and seeks to uncover its secrets; and Jon wants to be a pornographer. The picture is shot in a similar vein as was Wedding Party, albeit in color this time, with even more uncompromising editing. This time itâ€™s got the whole late-60s pop thing going for itâ€”shock-value subject matter, political commentary, drugs, violence, and sex. In fact, the latter component earned Greetings the distinction of being the first American mainstream movie to be officially given the â€œXâ€ rating by the newly-established MPAA (it has since been re-rated â€œRâ€).\n\nAccording to Hirsch, Greetings got mixed reviews but did good business, especially in New York, where it played well at art houses. It was decided that a sequel was in order, originally called Son of Greetings, but the title was eventually changed to Hi, Mom! Released in 1970, Mom almost received an â€œXâ€ rating, but De Palma deleted part of a scene to get an â€œR.â€\n\nHi, Mom! is yet another black comedy, and this oneâ€™s particularly subversive. It focuses solely on De Niroâ€™s character, Jon, who has returned to New York after serving in Vietnam. Now heâ€™s radicalized and wants to make a statement to the world. Hirsch calls the character â€œTaxi Driver Light,â€ and one can see a glimpse of Travis Bickle here in De Niroâ€™s Jon. This time, Jon continues his venture into smut-making (with the help of pornographer Allen Garfield, continuing a role he started in Greetings) by filming across the street into peopleâ€™s apartment windows, Rear Window-style. He falls for one of the victims of his voyeurism, Judy (Jennifer Salt). Most notable in the picture is a disturbing black and white sequence in which an off-off-Broadway troupe of black actors perform a show entitled â€œBaby, Be Black,â€ in which white audience members are forced to participate in the show, put on blackface, eat soul food, and then be terrorized by the actors (who are painted in whiteface). Not sure how this sequence would play for a modern audience! Look for early appearances by Charles Durning (credited as Charles Durnham) and Paul Bartel.\n\nArrow has done a top-notch job with these cinematic oddities. The High Definition Blu-ray (1080p) presentations with original English mono audio (uncompressed LPCM) look and sound surprisingly good. There are optional English subtitles. Supplements are plentiful. Thereâ€™s a new audio commentary on Greetings by Glenn Kenny, author of Robert De Niro: Anatomy of an Actor; a new appreciation of De Palmaâ€™s and De Niroâ€™s collaborations by critic and filmmaker Howard S. Berger; new interviews with Charles Hirsch; the pressbook for Greetings; the theatrical trailer for Hi, Mom!; reversible sleeves on the two jewel cases with commissioned artwork by Matthew Griffin; and booklets featuring pieces on the films by Brad Stevens, Chris Dumas, and Christina Newland, and an archival interview with De Palma and Hirsch.\n\nAll three films are curiosities, certainly fare for film historians and serious enthusiasts of De Palma and De Niro. For others, the trio will be considered very strange pieces of cinema that merely reflect the times in which they were made.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER FROM AMAZON\n\nBY TIM MCGLYNN\n\nThe Warner Archive has just released the 1951 RKO science-fiction classic The Thing From Another World on Blu-ray and it is a definite improvement over the current DVD edition.\n\nHoward Hawks produced this tight 87-minute thriller from a script by Charles Lederer and the original story Who Goes There? by John W. Campbell. Lederer removed the shape shifter aspects of the alien visitor and dialed back the paranoia that John Carpenter explored in his graphic 1982 remake. Here, the scientists who discovered the crashed remains of a flying saucer under the ice near the North Pole are shocked to find the remains of an extra-terrestrial. After returning to the base camp with their frozen visitor, an accident allows the creature to thaw and wreak havoc upon the researchers and the Air Force team sent to assist.\n\nThe creature, played by James Arness, needs blood to survive and reproduce, and two members of the crew are found hung upside down with their throats slit. Kenneth Tobey leads the team of soldiers and scientists, now isolated due to a storm, in a desperate battle to subdue the alien before they are all killed.\n\nThe strong supporting cast includes Robert Cornthwaite, Margaret Sheridan, Dewey Martin, Douglas Spencer and in a rare on-screen appearance, voiceover master Paul Frees. The pace is fast and furious with not a scene or line of dialogue wasted in this chilling story of do-or-die survival against a seemingly undefeatable foe. The monster, compared by the scientists to a form of plant-life, is unaffected by bullets and demonstrates it has the ability to reproduce itself after a sled dog attack severs its arm. A spectacular sequence features an attempt to incinerate the creature by dousing it with kerosene and setting it ablaze. What follows is a thrilling action set that critic Roger Ebert admitted scared him to death as a youth. Director James Cameron, in the sci-fi documentary Watch the Skies, noted it as the first full body burn in a Hollywood movie and marveled that â€œthe entire scene was lit by the guy on fire.â€\n\nControversy followed the completion of The Thing as to who actually helmed the film. Direction is credited to Christian Nyby, but many critics claim that the film is very close to producer Hawks in style and execution. Subsequent interviews with several cast members reveal that even the actors werenâ€™t sure who was in charge.\n\nHawks and Nyby were clever in never showing an extended close up of Arness as the Thing, thus keeping him more mysterious and anonymous. Later interviews revealed that Hawks was never satisfied with the look of the creature and actor Arness was somewhat embarrassed by the costume and make-up effects. The story comes to an electrifying conclusion that asks the world, in the midst of numerous real-life UFO sightings across the country, to â€œwatch the skies.â€\n\nThe technicians at Warner Archive have done a masterful job at rescuing this favorite classic from the ravages of time. The new disc was created from a 1080p high-definition master in 1.37 preserving Russell Harlanâ€™s claustrophobic framing and his beautiful black and white photography. All scratches, dirt, pops and instances of flicker have been removed. The contrast is sharp and the blacks are rich with fantastic detail now revealed in every scene. What might have been stock footage of the Air Force plane landing at the North Pole is crisp and appears to be second-unit work specifically for this film. Several sequences that were inserted back into the original print, such as the â€œclose the doorâ€ scene with General Fogarty, are nearly as clear as the rest of the film. Watch for the scene where we first meet Dr. Carrington and notice that the elements on the periodic table above his head may be clearly read.\n\nThe mono sound is very crisp and makes it easier to follow the rapid-fire dialogue, which was a hallmark of Hawksâ€™ productions. The humorous romantic exchanges between Tobey and Sheridan are especially helped by this sonic enhancement. The re-mastered soundtrack also allows us to fully appreciate the growling brass and eerie theremin tonalities from Dimitri Tiomkinâ€™s score. The opening credits might remind you of Tiomkinâ€™s themes during the graveyard scene in Itâ€™s a Wonderful Life, which was made at RKO six year prior to this film.\n\nThe Warner Archive Blu-ray release of The Thing from Another World is an occasion where it is definitely worth the cost of upgrading from the DVD, although the only bonus extras are a couple of trailers. This is a film that John Carpenter, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas and James Cameron all cite as a major inspiration for their own works. This new print shimmers and would make a worthy addition to your home library.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER FROM AMAZON\n\nâ€œA STOLEN MASTERPIECEâ€\n\nBy Raymond Benson\n\nIn a fascinating interview supplement contained on this amazing new release by The Criterion Collection, film historian Joseph McBride calls The Magnificent Ambersons one of the great Hollywood tragedies in that the film we got from writer/director Orson Welles was not the one he intended. It is widely known that RKO Radio, the studio behind the production, deleted forty-three minutes from Wellesâ€™ final cut, reshot the ending, and released the film their wayâ€”all against Wellesâ€™ wishesâ€”and then promptly destroyed the cut footage so that the movie could never be reconstructed.\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons is a stolen masterpiece.\n\nThat said, the film is still a great movie. In fact, it earned Oscar nominations for Best Picture, Best Supporting Actress (Agnes Moorehead), Best Cinematography (Black & White, by Stanley Cortez), and Best Art/Interior Set Decoration (Black & White).\n\nAmbersons, based on Booth Tarkingtonâ€™s 1918 novel (Welles claims that Tarkington was a â€œfriendâ€ of his fatherâ€™s), the picture was the directorâ€™s follow-up to Citizen Kane. Once again featuring some of the Mercury Players (Joseph Cotten, Ray Collins, and Moorehead) and new casting choices (Dolores Costello, Tim Holt, Anne Baxter), the production of Ambersons went well, with the picture going only a little over budget. Welles delivered a 148-minute cutâ€”and then Pearl Harbor happened. Welles was appointed by Nelson Rockefeller to be a goodwill ambassador to Latin America so that he could attempt to persuade South American countries from entering the war on the Axis side.\n\nWelles dutifully went to Brazil and started shooting a film (Itâ€™s All True, another picture sabotaged by RKO) and was essentially unavailable to receive notes and requests from RKO regarding Ambersons. RKO, unhappy with the film, then took it upon themselves to change it to suit their needs, and there was nothing Welles could do about it. The picture released in July 1942 was 88-minutes in length.\n\nWould a Magnificent Ambersons that is an hour longer be a better film than it already is? We can only assume. For one thing, the ending was drastically different. Wellesâ€™ version was cynical, dark, and ironic. Given the wartime climate, RKO wanted a more upbeat endingâ€”never mind that it really doesnâ€™t make sense that the characters suddenly change entire attitudes they have held throughout the film. Never mind that the final half-hour of the movie feels choppy, rushed, and out-of-rhythm from the first hour. The 88-minute version is what we have and must live with.\n\nIt should be stated againâ€”The Magnificent Ambersons is still a great picture.\n\nThe story concerns the wealthy Amberson family in the early 1900s Indianapolis. Beautiful Isabel Amberson (Costello) marries Wilbur Minafer (Don Dillaway) instead of Eugene Morgan (Cotten), but she regrets itâ€¦ and she and Morgan carry torches for each other for the remainder of their days. Enter Isabel and Wilburâ€™s bratty son, George (Holt), who terrorizes the town with his bad manners, arrogance, and boorishness. Things get complicated when he begins to woo Morganâ€™s daughter Lucy (Baxter) and at the same time insult and humiliate her father. All the while, Wilburâ€™s sister Fanny (Moorehead) also carries unrequited love for Morgan and inserts herself into the already-touchy situation.\n\nUltimately, Ambersons is about the downfall of a respected and wealthy family to that thing called Progressâ€”namely, the invention and proliferation of the automobile and other industrial evolutions. Welles makes an ecological statement with the picture (back in 1942!) which is something else RKO was unhappy with, seeing that American industries had to ramp up to support the war effort.\n\nCriterionâ€™s new 4K digital restoration looks marvelous, and it contains two separate audio commentaries with scholars Robert L. Carringer and James Naremore, and critic Jonathan Rosenbaum.\n\nThe packaging is first-rate. The numerous and excellent supplements alone make the product a 5-star purchase. Especially interesting and informative are the new interviews with (previously mentioned) McBride and one with film historian Simon Callow. Both men relate different insights into the history of the production and the editing debacle. Director Welles appears on a 1970 segment of The Dick Cavett Show (along with second guest Jack Lemmon) for an often-hilarious and always-entertaining half-hour discussion. New video essays on the cinematography and Bernard Herrmannâ€™s uncredited score (that was also chopped up with RKOâ€™s editing), by Francois Thomas and Christopher Husted, respectively, are a welcome addition.\n\nAlso included is the silent version of Ambersons, originally called Pampered Youth (1925), and re-edited for the U.K. as Two to One (1927). If that wasnâ€™t enough, we get two Mercury Theatre radio plays: the 1939 adaptation by Welles of Ambersons (with Welles playing the role of George), and a 1938 adaptation of Seventeen, another Booth Tarkington creation. Thereâ€™s more, such as audio interviews with Welles by Peter Bogdanovich and at an AFI symposium, and the theatrical trailer. The booklet comes in a stapled â€œmanuscriptâ€ that resembles a typed screenplay. It contains essays by authors and critics (Molly Haskell, Luc Sante, Geoffrey Oâ€™Brien, Farran Smith Nehme, and Jonathan Lethem), and excerpts from a Welles memoir.\n\nThe Magnificent Ambersons, even in its sadly truncated form, further illustrates the genius that was Orson Welles. This Criterion release is a must-have.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER FROM AMAZON\n\nBY LEE PFEIFFER\n\n\"The Shakiest Gun in the West\" was one of the feature film Don Knotts starred in for Universal after leaving his role as Deputy Barney Fife on \"The Andy Griffith Show\"- a role that saw him win multiple Emmy awards. Released in 1968, the comedy is as plain vanilla as all of Knotts's Universal flicks, as it's family friendly throughout. There is one unusual aspect to this production, however, in that it is a remake of the 1948 Bob Hope comedy hit \"The Paleface\". Directed by Alan Rafkin, who helmed Knotts's first film for Universal, \"The Ghost and Mr. Chicken\", \"Shakiest\" follows the formula that Knotts knew his fans wanted to see. He always played essentially the same character- a likable nerd with a lack of self-esteem who blunders into becoming a local hero only to be discredited and shamed. The conclusion of every Knotts film finds him performing some act of extraordinary courage that results in him becoming a legitimate hero and winning the girl, as well. Oh, yes, there's usually a scene in which Knotts's character ends up getting very drunk, thus allowing Knotts to slip and slobber, much to the delight of his audience. Although the original film was written for Bob Hope, a few tweaks by long-time \"Andy Griffith Show\" screenwriters Jim Fritzell and Everett Greenbaum easily convert the story into a suitable vehicle for Knott's signature nervous guy persona. Both Hope and Knotts excelled at playing cowards. Hope would respond to dangerous situations with a string of quips delivered with the rapidity of a machine gun. Knotts, however, would fall physically and mentally into a virtual nervous breakdown. The result was always amusing and Knotts lived by the adage \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\". Audiences- especially in rural areas- made his modestly-budgeted feature films very profitable.\n\n\"Shakiest\" opens in Philadelphia in 1870. Knotts plays Jesse Heywood, a dental student who must complete an examination on a patient in order to get his degree in dentistry. Unfortunately, the patient is a woman who refuses to open her mouth. Jesse tries to cajole her with childlike sweet talk but when she still refuses, the situation turns into a physical battle royal with both of them engaging in a knock-down wrestling match that starts the film off on a very funny note. Jesse then decides to follow the advice of Horace Greeley and \"Go West, young man.\" Presuming there is a dearth of available dentists in the newly-settled territories, the meek city slicker joins a wagon train (after being bilked by used-wagon salesman Carl Ballantine). A simultaneous plot line revolves around Penelope Cushings (Barbara Rhoades), a vivacious redhead who also happens to be a notorious bandit. When federal agents catch up to her, she is offered a deal: she can avoid a jail sentence if she acts as an undercover agent for the government and joins the wagon train to find out who among the passengers are intending to smuggle a cache of rifles to the Indians. At the last minute, the agent who was to pose as her husband is shot dead, leaving her with a dilemma: no single woman can be unaccompanied on the wagon train. Desperate, she uses Jesse as a pawn, fawning over the incredulous newly-minted dentist who can hardly believe his good fortune. Within hours they end up getting married but the minute the ink is dry on the license, Penelope gives a cold shoulder to her new husband. (The only sexually suggestive aspect to the film revolves around a running gag of Jesse being increasingly frustrated by his wife's stalling techniques when it comes to consummating their marriage.)\n\nOnce the wagon train is on the move, Penelope snoops around for the gun smugglers, who turn out to be a phony preacher (Donald Barry) and his partner (Jackie Coogan) who are secreting the weapons inside cases marked as containing bibles. Along the way, Jesse allows his wagon to fall behind the others and it is attacked by Indians. In mounting a seemingly futile defense, he is shocked to find that he has killed a dozen of his attackers, not realizing that the deadly shots were actually fired by Penelope. When word gets out of his achievement, Jesse is hailed and feted as a hero. The legend is reinforced when he is challenged by a notorious outlaw, Arnold the Kid (Robert Yuro), who is also slain in a gundown with Penelope secretly firing the fatal shot. (Shades of \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\"!) Ultimately, Jesse learns the truth and courageously admits to his fellow travelers that he really isn't a hero. He is rewarded for his honesty by being shunned and mocked. His misfortune continues with the admission by Penelope that she was only using him as part of her cover operation. The dejected Jesse is at a low point in his life when Penelope is kidnapped by the gun smugglers and brought to the Indian camp. Determined to save her, Jesse manages to locate the camp and infiltrate it while dressed as an Indian maiden(!). Needless to say, he finds his inner strength and in acts of courage saves the day and redeems his reputation.\n\nVirgil Films has released the remarkable documentary \"The Coolest Guy Movie Ever\", a unique look at the 1963 WWII classic \"The Great Escape\". The film cemented Steve McQueen as a newly-minted superstar of the big screen and featured one of the all-time great casts: James Garner, Richard Attenborough, Charles Bronson, James Coburn, David McCallum, Donald Pleasence, James Donald among them. United Artists originally intended the movie to be shot in Hollywood but director John Sturges argued that it would only be convincing if shot on location in Germany. \"The Coolest Guy Movie Ever\" visits those locations and presents how they look today. In some cases, the iconic locations have changed considerably while others remain instantly recognizable. The documentary was conceived, directed, photographed and edited by Christophe Espenan, a devoted fan of the film. Espenan and a team of dedicated assistants and enthusiasts of the movie painstakingly tracked down even the most minor locations. The documentary details the challenges this presented in Germany's ever-changing landscape. Most vitally, he also tracked down people whose families interacted with the film crew. Most interesting is the small hotel where key members of the cast, including Steve McQueen, stayed during production. The son of the couple who ran the hotel at the time (and who still operates it today) gives first-hand memories of what it was like to have legendary celebrities staying in the cozy venue and how polite everyone was to the family. The documentary is chock full of such wonderful anecdotes and is enhanced by ample film clips from the movie and very rare production photos.\n\nWe spoke to Joe Amodei, the President and CEO of Virgil Films, which has released the film as a region-free DVD. Here, Amodei shares his thoughts about the production.\n\nWhen did you first learn of the existence of â€œThe Coolest Guy Movie Everâ€ documentary?\n\nSomewhere around three years ago Steven Jay Rubin introduced me to Chris Espenan who was directing the doc. I had previously released Steveâ€™s documentary â€œEast LA Marineâ€ about WWII hero Guy Gabaldon. Steve knew I was a â€œGreat Escapeâ€ fan and told me about the movie. I immediately said â€œTally Ho, I am in.â€\n\nWhat attracted you in terms of agreeing to distribute the film through Virgil?\n\nâ€The Great Escapeâ€ was the film that did it for me as a kid going to the movies in Northeast Philadelphia. In those days I could walk to the theatre so I went three or four times a week. I learned the meaning of â€œcoolâ€ while watching the film. Steve McQueen was the definition of that word. We are always on the lookout for film- related docs and this one really came close to home. I also knew it was something I might be able to get my friend Michael Meister involved in. He is a fellow â€œGreat Escapeâ€ lover who ended up coming in with finishing funds that allowed us to screen the film in the market at Cannes. BTW Michael LOVES Cinema Retro!\n\nWhere did the rare production photos seen in the documentary originate?\n\nA lot of them came from Walter Rimiâ€™s son Christian who graciously allowed us the use of his fatherâ€™s photos. Walter was second unit director of photography. Christian is in the film and gives a very emotional talk about freedom and how important it s.\n\nWhat was WWII historian Steve Rubinâ€™s role in making the documentary a reality?\n\nHe is the Producer of the film. Our very own Big X. My Dad and I had the pleasure of seeing the film at Graumanâ€™s Theatre (I still call it that) in Hollywood a few years back during the Turner Classic Movies Film Fest. Was very cool seeing it on the big screen with my father sitting next to me. Itâ€™s not something I will ever forget.\n\nWhat are your personal memories of â€œThe Great Escapeâ€? When did you first see it?\n\nThe summer of 1963. The Merben Movie Theatre. Philadelphia PA. I remember building a ramp for my bicycle to jump over. I was lucky if I got the bike a foot or two off the ground. But it felt unbelievably cool!!!!\n\nWhat qualities about the movie do you feel resonate most after so many years?\n\nThe POWâ€™s never give up. They try to escape from the minute they get into the camp. They never give up. It is this heroism that the real Stalag Luft 3 inhabitants had when they made the real escape in March of 1944. John Surges and crew made sure that courage was on display throughout the film.\n\nWho is your favorite character in the film?\n\nSimply put Virgil Hilts. But I do have a love for Charles Bronsonâ€™s portrayal of â€œTunnel Kingâ€ Danny as well.\n\nâ€¦your favorite scene?\n\nNothing like that motorcycle jump over the fence to get me going. There is also a scene where McQueen takes down a German soldier about to shoot his friend, â€œThe Moleâ€ Ives. He doesnâ€™t get to save him but the gymnastic leap off the ground of McQueenâ€™s body into the German added to the coolness of the character. No one had done this in movies before. We had cool actors like William Holden in â€œStalag 17â€ or James Dean in â€œRebel Without a Cause.â€ But no one was cool like McQueen. No one.\n\nAny reflections on Elmer Bernsteinâ€™s score?\n\nIn the top two or three of all time. It is the ringer on my phone. I got the chance to thank him at a screening of â€œSweet Smell of Successâ€ a while back. He was a nice and gracious man.\n\nYour thoughts on John Sturges as a director and other films of his that have impressed you.\n\nSturges never gets the credit he deserves because a lot of his films were big time audience favorites but not necessarily critical favorites. This guy not only made â€œThe Great Escapeâ€ but he also brought us â€œThe Magnificent Seven\", â€œBad Day at Black Rock,â€ â€œThe Old Man and the Seaâ€ and â€œGunfight at the OK Corral.â€ Those are some heavyweights!!\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER FROM AMAZON\n\nBY TODD GARBARINI\n\nCarl Kolchak (Darren McGavin) returns in The Night Strangler (1973), a follow-up TV-movie to the previous yearâ€™s unexpectedly successful The Night Stalker. Kolchak has been booted out of Las Vegas and settles in Seattle and teams up with his old boss Tony Vincenzo (Simon Oakland) just as a string of suspicious murders begin to plague the metropolis. It comes to his attention that the victims, young female exotic dancers, are turning up dead after having had their necks crushed, drained of a small amount of blood, and most disturbingly all had instances of rotting flesh on their necks. The murders occur over a period of 18 days.\n\nThrough a researcher, Carl learns that a nearly identical series of killings took place in 1952 (21 years earlier) for the same duration, and then 21 years prior to that, all the way back to at least 1889 (this notion was exploited to horrific effect in Stephen Kingâ€™s masterful 1986 novel, It, wherein a malevolent creature appears every 27 years under the guise of Pennywise the Dancing Clown and goes on a murder spree to remain alive). The police want Kolchak to cease his own investigation and temporarily arrest him so that he wonâ€™t print anything that will alarm the public.\n\nCarl later uncovers information that leads him to a surgeon who was stationed on the Union Army side of the Civil War and the â€œUnderground Cityâ€ of Seattle figures into this surprising revelation of the identity of the man who is attempting to remain immortal over the millennia. Itâ€™s a really cool idea in theory, although in practice the sequence drags on a bit longer than it should.\n\nThe Night Strangler, shot in July of 1972 and aired on January 16, 1973, follows Kolchak and his aggravated boss as they bicker, yell, and disagree on what the facts are. The producers of the original film figured that if the public liked the original so much, they may as well give them something similar the second time around, and thatâ€™s just what they got. Robert Cobert returns to provide a spooky and playful score and Richard Matheson is on board again helming the teleplay. Sitting in the directorâ€™s chair this time around is Dan Curtis, the creator of Dark Shadows, the long-running TV horror series as well as its two theatrical films from the early 1970s. He went on to direct what is widely considered to be one of the scariest TV movies of all-time, Trilogy of Terror (1975), and the theatrical film of Robert Marascoâ€™s Burnt Offerings (1976), an equally frightening thriller. He does a fine job building suspense and keeping the streets of Seattle lit like a film noir, although the film suffers a bit from its extended running time with sequences wherein Kolchak enlists the help of a lady friend (JoAnne Pflug) walking the streets in the middle of the night to entrap the killer, or later when he roams the streets of the â€œUnderground Cityâ€ searching for the killer. Why is it that whenever women start being killed off, others feel the need to walk home alone on deserted streets?\n\nKino Lorber has released the film in a 4K restoration and the film looks like it was just shot. In addition to this, there are some great new extras:\n\nAudio commentary with Tim Lucas â€“ Mr. Lucas provided the wonderful commentary on this filmâ€™s predecessor and he does the same here. He has been writing about movies for well over 35 years. I first read his articles in Video Times Magazine in the mid-1980â€™s and published Video Watchdog magazine from 1990 to 2018. He has done some terrific commentaries in the past for Mario Bavaâ€™s work among many others, and he does the same here. One thing viewers will notice is that this second Kolchak outing runs 90 minutes as opposed to the first filmâ€™s 74 minutes. This is due to the fact that the original TV version, which also ran 74 minutes, is considered lost, and this 90-minute cut is actually the theatrical version that was released in Europe, something that was also done with Steven Spielbergâ€™s 1971 TV-movie Duel. That telecast also received a theatrical release here in the States in April 1983 and itâ€™s the 90-minute cut of that film that audiences know today.\n\nThere is also a high definition, ten-minute 2018 interview with music composer Robert Cobert who is an absolute delight to listen to. This is the same interview that appears on the Blu-ray of The Night Stalker. At nearly 94 years of age he describes how he comes up with music as he watches the rough cut and also discusses the stressful deadlines he was handed to compose and conduct the score simply because he was the last person brought in on the project. I have loved his music since I saw Burnt Offerings on television in 1981 and he has a signature sound. If you can find it, this CD has some of his best work.\n\nThere is a standard definition interview with producer Dan Curtis that was shot around 2003/2004 (he passed away in 2006) that runs seven and-a-half minutes wherein he talks about how wonderful and fun it was to make these films, and I really got a sense from him that he meant what he said when he reminisced about the good old days.\n\nThere is also a trailer for Burnt Offerings (1976); a limited edition booklet essay by film critic and author Simon Abrams; and beautiful new artwork by artist Sean Phillips.\n\nItâ€™s also nice to have subtitles for a change and Iâ€™m happy to report that Kino Lorber has provided those on this release, too. Letâ€™s hope that they continue this practice I with their future releases.\n\nCLICK HERE TO ORDER FROM AMAZON\n\n\"THE NIGHT OF THE IGUANA: CLOSE ENCOUNTERS IN THE JUNGLE\"\n\nBY EVE GOLDBERG\n\nThe Night of the Iguana, Tennessee Williamsâ€™s last great play, was turned into a 1964 movie which, in its day, was as famous for its behind-the-scenes spectacle as for what actually appeared on screen.\n\nToday, Iguana is rarely mentioned alongside the other classic Tennessee Williams film adaptations: Streetcar Named Desire, Cat on a Hot Tin Roof, and Suddenly, Last Summer. Despite a tremendously talented cast, compelling characters, and a canâ€™t-look-away examination of our anguished, redeemable humanity, Iguana is often neglected.\n\nSo, itâ€™s high time for a fresh look at this movie â€” with a focus on its journey from stage to screen.\n\nThe Play\n\n\"Shannon!\" shouts Maxine Faulk from the veranda of her run-down hotel on the coast of Mexico. Thus opens Tennessee Williamsâ€™ 1961 play. The setting is 1940. Recently widowed Maxine greets her old friend, Reverend Shannon, a disgraced minister who has been reduced to leading low-rent bus tours. He is currently shepherding a group of middle-aged Baptist women through Mexico. Shannon is in crisis. He has become sexually involved with Charlotte, a 17-year-old girl on the tour, whose jealous, closeted chaperone, Miss Fellows, is determined to get him fired. Already locked out of his church for having an affair with a young Sunday School teacher, Shannon is at the end of his rope. In a desperate attempt to stop Miss Fellows from phoning the States and exposing him, he pockets the ignition key and strands his charges at Maxineâ€™s secluded hotel.\n\nVacationing at the hotel is a pro-Nazi German family who stay glued to the radio throughout the play, gleefully reporting on Hitlerâ€™s progress. Soon, another unexpected visitor arrives: the beautiful spinster artist, Hannah Jelkes, escorting her 97-year-old grandfather, â€œthe worldâ€™s oldest practicing poet.â€ To eek out a living, Hannah sketches and her grandfather recites poetry as they wander the globe. Right now they are broke. Shannon convinces Maxine to let the pair spend the night at her hotel.\n\nEarthy, sensual Maxine wants Shannon to stay on at the hotel and fill her late husbandâ€™s shoes. Persistent Charlotte wants to seduce him. Vengeful Miss Fellows wants to get him fired. Shannon wants some peace of mind. As he fights against his own desires for both Charlotte and alcohol, he becomes increasingly distraught and emotionally unstable. He finally falls to pieces after the bus driver wrests the ignition key away from him and leaves with the women to continue their tour. To prevent Shannon from running down to the beach to take that â€œlong swim to China,â€ Maxine ties him up in a hammock on the verandah. During a stormy night of soul-searching (while strapped to the hammock), Shannon connects deeply with the serene and understanding Hannah. He admits to his â€œspooks,â€ she to her â€œblue devils.â€ Hannah, who has never had sexual relations, describes to Shannon what she calls her â€œlove experienceâ€ with an underwear salesman. When Shannon asks whether she was disgusted by the manâ€™s request to hold a piece of her clothing, Hannah replies with the most famous line of the play: â€œNothing human disgusts me, unless itâ€™s unkind, violent.â€\n\nAs a result of the profound communication and connection Shannon experiences with Hannah, his torment subsides. He frees himself from the hammock. Then, at Hannahâ€™s request, he cuts loose the iguana which is being held captive under the verandah by Maxineâ€™s houseboys. At the end of the play, Hannahâ€™s grandfather finishes his final poem and dies; Hannah leaves to travel alone; and Shannon reluctantly agrees to stay on with Maxine and help her run the hotel.\n\nNight of the Iguana opened on Broadway with legendary Bette Davis in the role of Maxine. The play was well-received, and ran for 361 performances. It won the New York Drama Criticâ€™s Circle award for Best Play, and was nominated for a Tony for Best Play. However, unhappy with the production and her role, Davis left the show after a few months. According to the actress, â€œThere was no camaraderie, no sense of kinship, no attitude of pulling together to make the play work.â€ According to Tennessee Williams, â€œIf she had ever truly had a command of her talent on the stage, she had lost it by that time.â€ Davis was replaced by Shelley Winters. Still, Davis hoped to play Maxine on screen. It was not to be.\n\nThe Stars\n\nWhen producer Ray Stark brought a screenplay for Night of the Iguana to John Huston, the director was immediately interested in making the movie. â€œI was a great admirer of Tennessee Williams,â€ said Huston. â€œI had seen the play and liked it, with reservations.â€\n\nAt that time, Huston was at the peak of a long and illustrious career. His prior films included such popular and critical hits as The Maltese Falcon, The African Queen, The Treasure of Sierra Madre, and The Asphalt Jungle. In the sexist vernacular of the day, Huston was known as a â€œmanâ€™s manâ€ â€” he was a former boxer, unrepentant boozer, and lover of women, danger, and adventure â€” who enjoyed making his films in exotic, challenging locations. He was also one of the most literate of American filmmakers. He had been a contract writer at Warner Brothers, penning adaptations of great novels including Moby Dick and Red Badge of Courage. In Iguana, he saw an opportunity to explore Tennessee Williamsâ€™s meaty theme of â€œloose, random souls trying to account for themselves and finally being able to do so through love.â€\n\nHuston hoped to cast his movie with big-time stars: Richard Burton, Ava Gardner, Deborah Kerr, and Sue Lyon.\n\nRichard Burton was just coming off mega-movie Cleopatra, where he met, co-starred, and began a torrid affair with Elizabeth Taylor. The stunningly beautiful Taylor was the top female box office attraction in the world. Burton, an acclaimed Shakespearean actor, had become a screen sensation with starring roles in Look Back In Anger and Becket. Both Burton and Taylor were married to others when they began their affair â€” Taylor to crooner Eddie Fisher whom she infamously â€œstoleâ€ from girl-next-door actress Debbie Reynolds. At a time in American culture when divorce, much less extra-marital affairs, was still semi-taboo, the public couldn't get enough of \"Liz and Dick.\" Their scandalous relationship and glamorous lifestyle captivated millions. Their photos and personal lives were constant fan mag fodder â€” solid gold for the Hollywood publicity machine.\n\nIf anybody could rival Liz Taylor in both the beauty and scandal departments it was Ava Gardner. Brought to Hollywood more for her looks and legs than her acting ability â€” which, according to the actress herself, was close to zilch â€” Gardner signed a contract with MGM at age 19. She then progressed from pin-up girl, to small roles in B movies, to femme fatale icon. She exuded a magnetic, sultry sex appeal. And she was gorgeous. According to Humphrey Bogart, \"Whatever it is, whether you're born with it, or catch it from a public drinking cup, she's got it.\"\n\nGardner gained additional fame for three high-profile marriages to three high-profile celebrities: actor Mickey Rooney, band leader Artie Shaw, and no-introduction-needed Frank Sinatra. The tumultuous Frank-and-Ava marriage was chronicled in the press as avidly as the Liz-and-Dick affair. After six years of a passionately volatile relationship, Gardner and Sinatra divorced in 1957. By the time Iguana came around, Ava Gardner was 44 years old and living in Spain where she hung out with Ernest Hemingway and a bevy of bullfighters. Huston decided that her unique blend of beauty, maturity, and lusty sensuality made her ideally suited for the role of hotel owner Maxine.\n\nAs for Bette Davis, who openly coveted the role she had pioneered on Broadway, Huston decided she wasnâ€™t right for the part. He felt she came across as â€œtoo threateningâ€ for the kind of Maxine he had in mind.\n\nWhen 18-year-old Sue Lyon was cast in Iguana as seductive teenager Charlotte, she had exactly one film credit to her name: the title role in Lolita. 'Nuf said.\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum, Deborah Kerr already had 42 films under her belt. She had played a troubled nun in Black Narcissus; a neglected military wife in From Here to Eternity (iconic beach make-out scene with Burt Lancaster!); a widowed school teacher in The King and I; and the tragically romantic heroine in An Affair to Remember. She had been nominated for an Academy Award as Best Actress six times. On screen and off, Kerr had gained a reputation as a class act. Huston thought she'd be perfect as the chaste painter Hannah.\n\n\"We went to see them, one after another\" Huston wrote in his memoir, Open Book. \"Richard, in Switzerland, promptly accepted; likewise Deborah in London. That took us to Madrid and Ava Gardner.\" According to Huston, Gardner was unsure whether she had the ability to do the part. However, after the requisite wooing, she agreed to be in the film.\n\nNow the stars were set. The press closed in. The fun was about to begin.\n\nThe Production\n\n\"We've got more reporters up here than iguanas.\" -- producer Ray Stark.\n\nIn 1964, when Iguana's cast and crew descended upon it, Puerto Vallarta was still a small fishing town with a few hotels; 24-hour electrical service had only recently arrived. Eight miles up the coast, accessible only by boat, was an isolated rain forest peninsula called Mismaloya. High atop the cliff at this lush, mosquito-infested spot is where Huston decided to film Night of the Iguana. A strong believer in location shooting, he thought the wild, sweaty atmosphere of Mismaloya would visually reflect the inner tumult of the movie's characters. He also hoped that the challenging environment would force the actors out of their comfort zones and enhance their performances.\n\nUp on this jungle mountaintop, a construction crew built the movie's weathered hotel set. They also erected 40 bungalows to house the 125 cast and crew members who would live there for the entire 72-day shoot. In addition to living quarters, the crew built an editing room; a large kitchen, bar and restaurant; water tanks and an electrical plant; plus various paths and roads. All materials and supplies had to be carried up 134 earthen steps from the beach to the cliff-top location. It took 280 men and 80 burros to complete the task.\n\nAs construction of the miniature city proceeded, Huston and his co-writer, Anthony Veiller, worked on the script.\n\nFinally, Iguana's cast arrived in Puerto Vallarta. As did more than 100 members of the press and paparazzi. Fascinated by the high-wattage gathering of filmdom glitterati, reporters expected plenty of behind-the-scenes fireworks. Especially because Burton was accompanied by his lover, Elizabeth Taylor. With sexy co-stars Ava Gardner and Sue Lyon roaming the set, the press assumed that Taylor wanted to keep an eye on Burton. \"I trust Richard completely,\" she told reporters. \"It's just that I don't trust Fate. After all, Fate threw us together on Cleopatra.\"\n\nAnd there was plenty more to feed the gossip-hungry public: Burton brought along his publicist, Michael Wilding, who had been Liz Taylor's second husband. Teenager Sue Lyon was visited on location by her 25-year-old fiancÃ©, actor Hampton Fancher III. And Ava Gardner took up with several hunky beach boys. Director Huston, married at the time, was accompanied by his mistress, Zoe Sallis. Deborah Kerr brought along her husband, writer Peter Viertel, who had once been Ava Gardner's lover. Viertel was the author of White Hunter, Black Heart â€” a novel based on the making of The African Queen â€” which featured an unflattering portrait of a Huston-like movie director.\n\nBefore filming began, Huston assembled his stars, plus Taylor and Stark, and presented each one with a velvet-lined box. Inside the box was a derringer pistol and five gold-plated bullets. Each bullet was engraved with the name of one of the others. A photo from that moment shows the assembled group examining their pistols and sharing a hearty laugh. The atmosphere was loose and fun â€” regardless of what the press hoped for.\n\nWhile most of the cast and crew lived at the Mismaloya mini-city for the duration of the shoot, top stars Burton, Kerr, Gardner, and Lyon stayed in Puerto Vallarta.\n\nWrote Kerr about their accommodations in town: \"Never have there been such raucous donkeys, such snuffling and screeching pigs, such shrill and insistent roosters and babbling turkeys. Top this off with a thick sauce of mariachi music, plus phonographs and radios at full blast, season with firecrackers and rockets at all hours of the night, and you have a fairly tasty idea of what the sleeping conditions are like in this tropical paradise.\"\n\nEarly each morning, the stars boarded motor boats to make the 25-minute ride to Mismaloya. Documentary footage shows Deborah Kerr being carried by a crew member, who is waist-deep in the surf, and being placed in a waiting boat.\n\nLines were drawn on the first day of shooting when Kerr and Lyon announced that they expected the set to be \"dry.\" Burton, a devout alcoholic, said this was \"preposterous.\" He ordered a bar to be set up at each end of the crude staircase which connected beach to cliff-top. Huston and Gardner, both committed drinkers, did not object. Thus, beer and tequila flowed freely during the shoot. Burton took his first drink early each morning before the cameras rolled. Gardner had a personal icebox stocked with her favorite Mexican beer. For her part, Elizabeth Taylor ordered gourmet hamburgers imported daily from the U.S. and brought up to the set.\n\nDespite prodigious alcohol consumption, filming progressed fairly smoothly. While the press anticipated juicy sex scandal and interpersonal catastrophe, the most serious mishap of the production was actually due to the sub-standard materials used to construct the housing at Mismaloya. One night, assistant director Tom Shaw was standing on his balcony when it collapsed. Shaw broke his back and had to be flown back to the U.S. for surgery. Fortunately, his injuries healed and he would work with Huston again."
