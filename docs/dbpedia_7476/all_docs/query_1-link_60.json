This cycle of innovation and compassion drives us to redefine the future of medicine.\n\nIdeals & Action\n\nWe're making strides on campus and in health-care professions to build a culture that is diverse, inclusive and equitable. Here you'll find an array of resources and opportunities that support our meaningful commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\n\nViews & Voices\n\nI have never met a more inspiring, compassionate, and welcoming group of people. This authentic, close-knit community is something that I can’t imagine I would experience to this same magnitude anywhere else.\n\nThe faculty here are extremely approachable and excited to serve as mentors to students in any capacity. The school cares a great deal about its students. And our administration and faculty leads are extremely receptive to feedback and take quick action to make changes that are intended to improve the experience of all students here.\n\n—Jennifer Fourth-year medical student Read more\n\nDiscovery & Impact\n\n“If you only study Alzheimer’s in white people, you only learn about Alzheimer’s in white people,” says neurologist John C.
