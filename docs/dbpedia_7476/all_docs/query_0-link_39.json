The experience wasn't anything like I had imagined. I'm an introvert by nature, so the very idea of appearing on television was daunting. But the events of that day added an extra layer of challenge. Driving to the studio, I managed to get utterly lost. The pressure of knowing I was on a tight schedule turned each wrong turn into a minor crisis. My anxiety and stress were elevated as I navigated through unfamiliar streets, watching the minutes slip away. When I finally made it to the studio, I was a bundle of nerves. I was hurried onto the set with just minutes to spare. There I was, about to go live, my heart racing, and completely unprepared for what was next. It was a real test of my ability to stay composed under pressure and adapt on the fly. This was an example of me pushing myself out of my comfort zone to do what was good for my business‚Äîgetting my thought leadership out into the public in a huge way. I never in my wildest dreams thought I'd be on TV. The experience ended up being so amazing that I wish we had more time. When it ended, I was disappointed as I was riding on a high with my rapport with the interviewer and just experiencing myself in a new way! This leap of faith opened the doors to many other media and speaking opportunities and gave me greater credibility as a thought leader in my field as an image expert. I got an opportunity to critique an election debate with President Obama and Mitt Romney on WUSA 9 about a year later. Here's why I'm sharing this story: it's about using our platforms, perspectives, and privileges to further our purpose. And guess what? When we speak up, stand out and show up, that's how we impact lives, elevate our influence, and increase our income so we can do even more! If you‚Äôre seeking to transform lives, communities, or industries, playing small will not get you the results you want. But being vocal, vulnerable, and visible can! Allow me to show you how. Reach out for more. #visibility #media #TVinterview #impact Below is the video of my critique of the election debate between then President Obama and Mitt Romney üòâ\n\nKey messages are pass√©? Gah. This is a pretty painful read for media trainers specifically and PR practitioners more broadly. The premise, for those of you who hit the NYT paywall, is that authenticity is the thing that everyone is seeking right now, at least for celebrities, and that media training and key messages are - by implied definition - at odds with that. To me, the whole piece betrays a lack of understanding about what the point of media training and key messages are for - to support the interview subject in prioritizing the points that are most important to him/her/them. The disconnect happens when someone else decides what the key messages are, and foists them on the spokeperson to deliver without consultation. If you are the interview subject, take an active part in determining the key messages, and use the language that you would use to deliver them. For most of you, doing media is part of your job; there is no value in winging it, unless you want to get famous for being famous.\n\nWhy you need to post at the same time on LinkedIn? (This post is strategically delayed to teach a lesson!) Do you know the fact why we love TV Shows? - They always give a sense of consistency - They always got aired at the same time - They always waste our time, lol And, For these reasons, we always get beaten by our Momsüò≠üòÇ To \"STOP\" watching them at the same time every day! But They also teach us, why you need to post at the same time! ‚Üí Show up to make them feel guilty ‚Üí Show up otherwise they'll forget you ‚Üí Show up to help someone behind you ‚Üí Show up to make them feel jealous of taking actions ‚Üí Show up to maintain posting streak, not cheap streaks on Snap ‚Üí Show up to make them wake up and hit the post ‚Üí Show up to make yourself feel proud ‚Üí Show up to become the better self ‚Üí Show up to get loyal clients I can fill the character limit, but leaving that for you üòé P.S. Did you post at the same time today or delay it like me? P.P.S. Are you with me on this posting streak?\n\nFear is a powerful engine to improve our careers. You just have to use it the right away. 1. If you fear you could get fired, create a side hustle to always have a backup plan. 2. If you fear others can take your position, use that feeling to stay up to date and improve your skills. 3. If you fear you won‚Äôt be booked for the next show, become the best at networking so you are always top of mind. 4. If you fear your age is against you, take care of your body and your mind to remain as sharp as possible. 5. If you fear you are not good enough, go out there and prove yourself wrong. Put fear to work for you instead of against you. - - - - - üö®Join pros from Fox, CBS, Telemundo, Globo, Univision, NBC, CBS, Astro, and Sky that are subscribed to ‚ÄúThe Ministry of Broadcasting‚Äù.

Around 2019-2020, I decided it was time to leave. The process of doing so was hard, stressful and full of unknowns... and it took more than a year. I'm now in a fantastic career that's far better for my mental and emotional health, and better for my family. But I could not have gotten here alone. SEVERAL other former newsies advised and guided me on everything from determining what I wanted to do outside of TV, constructing my resume, preparing me for what the interview process was like, and level-setting with me on what the speed of work would be in another industry (so slow!). In less than two years out of TV news, I've now advised several others who were trying to make the move. But I want to do more. So, I started this simple Facebook group and have already brought together more than 20 other former newsies who are now succeeding in new industries. They are all willing to help others currently on or considering starting that same journey. If you are one of those former newsies who wants to share some wisdom, please join. If you are current newsie trying to get out (or thinking about it), please join and ask your questions. If you know someone who fits either of those categories, please share the group link with them. Maybe this won't really help anyone. Maybe it will. But I figured I would try. #tvnews #journalism #networking #greatresignation #careeradvice #jobhunt #makingachange\n\nPenny wise and pound foolish! Where did CNN find such \"geniuses\" to manage its website? I was reading the news on the CNN app when I got interrupted by a pop-up that said I'd already read my limit of stories for the day. I could either create an account and sign in or come back tomorrow. I suspect they figured if I logged in they could track me all over the Internet and charge more for the ads being targeted at me. But just how much are they going to profit when I simply close the app and look at Apple News or ABC or CBS or NBC's news? And I won't get to see the commercials they run before any videoed stories? Doesn't it make more sense to get paid less for the ads I do see than to get nothing for the ads I don't? (Oh, BTW, I can also go to their website on my desktop and read more news there.)
