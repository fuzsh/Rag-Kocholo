        "text": "In my senior year as a math major, I scored second from the top of my class in the theoretical aspects of advanced analysis (calculus squared, as it were) and fifth from the bottom in the practical applications of the same material.\n\nThe head of the department, Dr. Arnold Ross (born Chaimovitch)—a man who profoundly influenced me in numerous ways—took me aside and said, “You want to be a philosopher, not a mathematician.”\n\nHe wasn’t wrong, though I ultimately became neither. But my philosophical disposition has revealed itself in both my reading and writing.\n\nAlthough we speak often and at length on the importance of making sure our readers feel something, I personally cannot commend a novel that does not also make me, in the words of Dr. Ross, “think deeply about simple things.”\n\nSome of you may remember a post I wrote for Writer Unboxed a year and a half ago titled, “Writing Our Country.” It sought to apply some of the ideas of the American neo-pragmatist Richard Rorty to writing fiction in today’s literary environment.\n\nSpecifically, the post addressed Rorty’s belief that the novel served a uniquely valuable role in expanding not just the perimeters of our understanding but the range of our empathy for others whose backgrounds, cultures, and daily experiences vary widely from our own.\n\nThe goal of this expansion was to broaden the range of solidarity of human beings seeking a more just, prosperous, and peaceful world.\n\nThe Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy puts it this way:\n\nThe key imperative in Rorty’s ethico-political agenda is the deepening and widening of solidarity … [He] distinguishes between “us” and “them,” arguing that thinking of more and diverse people as “one of us” is the hallmark of social progress. Solidarity is brought about by gradual and contingent expansions of the scope of “we;” it is created through the hard work of training our sympathies … by exposing ourselves to forms of suffering we had previously overlooked. Thus, the task of the intellectual, with respect to social progress, is not to provide refinements of social theory, but to sensitize us to the suffering of others, and refine, deepen and expand our ability to identify with others, to think of others as like ourselves in morally relevant ways.\n\nAs self-proclaimed “postmodernist bourgeois liberal”:\n\n[Rorty] is skeptical of political thought purporting to uncover hidden, systematic causes for injustice and exploitation, and on that basis proposing sweeping changes to set things right. Rather … [he] follows Judith Shklar in identifying liberals by their belief that “cruelty is the worst thing we do,” and contends it is our ability to imagine the ways we can be cruel to others, and how we could be different, that enables us to gradually expand the community with which we feel solidarity.\n\nFor Rorty, the novel plays a uniquely valuable role in this effort:\n\nNovelists, like Vladimir Nabokov, George Orwell, Charles Dickens, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Radclyffe Hall, offer new descriptions that draw our attention to the suffering of previously overlooked people and groups. They contribute to social progress by pointing out “concrete cases of particular people ignoring the suffering of other particular people.” Because reading novels is one of the best ways to sensitize ourselves to the suffering experienced by others – to see that they have “the same tendency to bleed when pricked” – Rorty thinks a liberal arts education is key to maintaining liberal democracy, and for strengthening a global human rights culture.\n\nTo be clear, Rorty’s positions on such matters were hardly universally acclaimed. In his essay “Trotsky and the Wild Orchids,” he wrote, “If there is anything to the idea that the best intellectual position is one which is attacked with equal vigor from the political right and the political left, then I am in good shape.”\n\nIn particular, at much the same time as Rorty was addressing such matters, another element of postmodernist philosophy was gaining the upper hand, one which called into question the ability of any of us to genuinely understand someone else’s “lived experience,” and challenged the idea that it was useful or even possible to identify with others.\n\nIronically, this notion became especially prevalent in the humanities and has made serious inroads in publishing, undermining the idea that novels can help us, especially those of us who’ve benefited the most from colonialist patriarchal Western culture, to gain any understanding or empathy at all for members of marginalized communities.\n\nI say “ironically” because the majority of publishers, editors, and readers of books written by members of marginalized communities are educated whites. What is the point of publishing such books, let alone translating them into English when necessary, if they cannot help us better understand the “lived experience” the writers are depicting?\n\nTo be sure, none of this has arisen out of malevolent motives. As the American philosopher Susan Neiman has pointed out, in the wake of the Holocaust, moral thinking, in its attempt to adapt our understanding of justice in the face of such previously unimaginable horrors, focused on the suffering of victims of authoritarian violence, torture, and genocide.\n\nWhat began as a refocusing on the experiences of injustice’s victims, however, became a preoccupation on victimhood, to the point that victimization became emblematic of elevated moral status.\n\nEven those whose work proved fundamental to the postmodern understanding of justice and morality came to see their ideas highjacked by an increasingly rigid academia focused on identity.\n\nOne example: Edward Said, whose Orientalism is one of the most influential texts critiquing western misrepresentations of Middle Eastern and Asian cultures. As noted in Yascha Mounk’s The Identity Trap:\n\n[B]efore his premature death of leukemia, in 2003, Edward Said became very critical of the way in which the identity synthesis was starting to transform intellectual life in the United States. Identity, he said at one point, is “as boring a subject as one can imagine.” Though some leftists had seemingly started to believe that people who belong to a group that has historically been victimized have some form of privileged access to moral virtue, “victimhood, alas, does not guarantee or necessarily enable an enhanced sense of humanity.” … The idea that it would serve progress for members of different ethnic and cultural groups to be more defined by their differences than by their commonalities struck Said as particularly perverse. … a kind of “apartheid pedagogy.” In the end, Said therefore embraced a form of universalism that stood in direct conflict with some of the core tenets of the identity synthesis: “Marginality and homelessness are not, in my opinion, to be gloried in; they are to be brought to an end, so that more, and not fewer, people can enjoy the benefits of what has for centuries been denied the victims of race, class, or gender.”\n\nThe internet has become a major tool for alienating, mobbing, shaming, and delegitimizing those who fail to abide by the current orthodoxy, especially in terms of standpoint theory and intersectionality, which combine to create the idea that only one’s own lived experience has moral authority, and attempts by members of different ethnic, cultural, or religious groups to communicate with each other should be treated with extreme skepticism—or worse.\n\nCultural warriors from the opposite end of the political spectrum have seized on these excesses to paint their opponents as Stalinist scolds seeking to stifle free speech and strictly enforce a code of thought and behavior at odds with traditional American values. The result has been book banning, curriculum cleansing, and attacks on academia with particular focus on racial or ethnic minorities, the LGTBQ+ community, and their allies. [Note: This is not a blanket statement about conservatism, but rather a statement concerning what are known as Nationalist Conservatives. Two other schools of conservative thought, Fusionism and Humanist Conservatism, are far less exclusionary in their thinking on cultural issues.]\n\nAll of which presents a particular problem for writers of fiction: how do we, in such a heatedly polarized environment, write authoritatively on issues touching on politics without committing professional suicide?\n\nI intend to address that question in my next few posts here at Writer Unboxed. Specifically, I’ll explore:\n\nHow politics is rooted in character, with discussion of how to “write about politics without writing about politics.”\n\nHow the core metaphors or concepts informing political dispositions create opportunities to address politics without moralizing, consciously or unconsciously.\n\nHow to step outside one’s own political convictions and write authentically about those whose political identity differs starkly from one’s own.\n\nHow to write about politics in terms of group identity—and the perils of defying the group’s norms.\n\nHow polarization seemingly invites fictionalization due to its ability to enhance conflict—but not without serious risks for writers."
