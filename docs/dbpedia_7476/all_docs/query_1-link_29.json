        "text": "Sharon Hulce Possibly the Most important thing you'll read this Year... The following is the philosophy of Charles Schulz, the creator of the 'Peanuts' comic strip. You don't have to actually answer the questions. Just ponder on them. Just read it straight through, and you'll get the point. 1. Name the five wealthiest people in the world. 2. Name the last five Heisman trophy winners. 3. Name the last five winners of the Miss America pageant. 4. Name ten people who have won the Nobel or Pulitzer Prize. 5. Name the last half dozen Academy Award winners for best actor and actress. 6. Name the last decade's worth of World Series winners. How did you do? The point is, none of us remember the headliners of yesterday. These are no second-rate achievers. They are the best in their fields. But the applause dies. Awards tarnish ... Achievements are forgotten. Accolades and certificates are buried with their owners. Here's another quiz. See how you do on this one: 1. List a few teachers who aided your journey through school. 2. Name three friends who have helped you through a difficult time. 3. Name five people who have taught you something worthwhile. 4. Think of a few people who have made you feel appreciated and special. 5. Think of five people you enjoy spending time with. Easier? The lesson: The people who make a difference in your life are not the ones with the most credentials, the most money ... or the most awards. They simply are the ones who care the most.\n\n#politics As the world teeters on the edge of escalation of two wars for civilization in Eurasia into an abyss, which could potentially engulf the world for a third time in a hundred years and for a second time by use of nuclear weapons in demonstration of mass hate by genocidal crime beyond any measure of insanity, proving that humanity has never been civilized in all of its history, the classic Hollywood film The Silence of the Lambs with British theater actor Anthony Hopkins starring as the brilliant psychiatrist Hannibal the Cannibal Lecter profiling a serial killer Buffalo Bill to Clarice Starling, a young Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agent played by Jodie Foster, in a Maryland penitentiary for the criminally insane comes to mind. The film is made based on the novel by the same name by journalist Thomas Harris who covered crime for sometime in his reporting. The attached clip from YouTube is the scene from the film where Lecter profiles Bill to Agent Starling. The novel and the movie are thought provoking in the category of literature and not mere popular fiction because they invoke affinity among the audience for Lecter, albeit a criminally insane cannibal, whom one would normally consider an embodiment of absolute evil. Buffalo Bill, the serial killer, whom we can understand as humanity serially killing fertile young women to transform itself from the ugly caterpillar to a beautiful butterfly, is in reality humanity born in innocence at Genesis as the beautiful monarch butterfly in flight flippantly feeding on the flowers in happiness but which hates its own beauty in shame and transforms itself into the ugly caterpillar, perpetually creeping and crawling, feeding on the green leaf. Lecter, the cannibal, being locked up in the high security basement prison in Maryland for the criminally insane represents humanity locking itself up in its historical condition, which it sees, in delusion, as being inescapable. The human condition is neither a strait jacket for the criminally insane nor is it inescapable in perpetuity. In the end, as usually all’s well that ends well, Lecter escapes and Bill is killed by Starling, a woman, illustrating that the restoration of humanity to its nativity is feasible, the lambs in Clarice’s head silenced https://lnkd.in/eW8c4Yyw.\n\nIn a recent Chinese New Year film exploring the YOLO theme by 贾玲, she took the audience on a journey of empowerment and profound self-discovery. While some may label it as merely a weight loss narrative, I see it as a profound exploration of the human spirit. It speaks to the resilience within us all, showcasing that no matter how deep our flaws or how frequent our stumbles are, there's always a glimmer of hope to cling onto. It's a reminder that even in our darkest moments, if we can latch onto even the tiniest spark of passion or purpose, and relentlessly pursue it with unwavering determination, miracles can unfold. This film is a testament to the power of perseverance, illustrating that against all odds, victory is not just a possibility, but an inevitability, even if it graces us just once in a lifetime. Now and then, I do follow the comedic side of Jia Ling on YouTube, finding her to be a genuinely hilarious entertainer. Recently, her foray into production has sparked a myriad of discussions across social media platforms, which comes as no surprise. As I peruse the diverse array of comments from netizens, I can't help but reflect on the reception of my recent production, \"Rising With Charlene.\" Amidst the positive feedback, there's also a fair share of criticism. Yet, much like Jia Ling, my aim remains steadfast: to cultivate a space where individuals can find solace, embrace love, and nurture self-kindness through creation in their lives. Admittedly, negative comments can weigh heavily on my spirit at times too, stalling my momentum. If you find resonance in this struggle, show your support and stay tuned for our upcoming guest next Monday premiere. In the meantime, feel free to catch the first full run here with Joanne: https://bit.ly/RWC-S1 photo credit: weibo\n\nVisits from Krish https://lnkd.in/d-2QVcGa Mountain vary poor issues in scorching star. A really imaginative black comedy of a scientist who brings a corpse again to life utilizing a child&#039;s mind… it&#039;s alternately unusual and good… the creativeness is superb and Emma Stone is certain to win an Oscar… Ruffalo and Dafoe are additionally superb, particularly the primary one is hilarious… though there may be lots of graphic nudity… okay value watching simply because it&#039;s very authentic content material and nothing you&#039;ve seen earlier than compares to it. However it&#039;s not a film that everybody will essentially like. ************************************************** *************** Consider Animal It’s a very intriguing movie. I utterly agree that it has some excesses and overly indulgent scenes, however at its core it’s fairly fascinating. I can most likely record the scenes that had been like WTF, however they&#039;re equally fascinating in equal measure. There’s some factor of God the Father, some factor of different English movies, and so forth., however it’s a very authentic work as Vanga most likely adapts it fairly properly.<!--more--> A number of the scenes are excellent just like the celebration scene, the ultimate scene between the 2, the scene between Rashmika and Ranbir after her infidelity, the scene the place she goes to Punjab and even the bare stroll was one way or the other comprehensible to that character. Equally, there are very indulgent scenes like a number of the early discuss intercourse and alpha stuff, some underwear discuss, Rashmika stripping and even the motion scene main as much as the interval isn’t very properly thought out along with her cousins singing within the background whereas he will get harm, and so forth. However no matter how good or dangerous you see the film, it&#039;s one thing you possibly can&#039;t ignore. It&#039;s not like different hits of the 12 months that will not be remembered, however I believe this one might be mentioned, rightly or wrongly. There is no such thing as a doubt that Ranbir was superb in an author-backed function, however I believe Rashmika was superb at holding her personal in some essential scenes.Normally, it’s troublesome to know what Vanga needed to convey. It may be stated that she meant to intentionally shock the viewers with this daring try or maybe she merely misplaced management by going excessive in these scenes. Both approach, I believe Vanga is a vital director and I’ll absolutely try what he does subsequent. I can even say that such movies don&#039;t occur even in Telugu cinema, so this isn’t a case like Salaar, the place a director is pushing the southern type of him right here. The filmmaking may be very polished right here and the message straddles the tremendous line of being a genius or utterly insane."
