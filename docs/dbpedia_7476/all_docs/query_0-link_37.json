He talks about dropping his bid for reelection; his support of the Harris-Walz ticket; and what he sees as the threat posed to democracy if former President Donald Trump is successful in regaining the White House.\n\n12:01\n\nPost Malone on success, acceptance, and his new country album\n\nHe's one of the biggest pop stars in the world, yet Post Malone's new album, \"F-1 Trillion,\" features his duets with some of the biggest names in country, including Luke Combs, Blake Shelton, Morgan Wallen and Dolly Parton. Correspondent Anthony Mason visits Malone in Nashville to talk about his acceptance among country music fans; how he dealt with being called a \"one-hit wonder\" following his debut with the 2015 hip hop smash \"White Iverson\"; and how he recovered from a downward spiral that he experienced in the midst of his success.\n\n07:49\n\nCrocheting magical gifts for special patients\n\nHolly Christensen, a former oncology nurse, saw how much joy could be brought to young cancer patients and their families when she made a Rapunzel wig out of soft yarn for a friend's daughter undergoing chemotherapy. What began in 2015 as a thoughtful gift has since spun into a national non-profit, the Magic Yarn Project. Volunteers at 10 chapters nationwide transform yarn into character wigs for kids with cancer (or any child dealing with medical hair loss). Correspondent Serena Altschul reports.\n\n05:02\n\nSutton Foster & Carol Burnett: Musical comedy royalty\n\nIn 1959 an unknown named Carol Burnett burst onto the New York stage in the musical comedy \"Once Upon a Mattress.\" Now, two-time Tony-winning star Sutton Foster is recreating the role of Princess Winnifred, a princess in search of a suitable mate, in the new Broadway revival. Correspondent Tracy Smith talks with Burnett and Foster about the power of fairy tales – from the theatrical kind to real life.\n\n07:32\n\nZoë Kravitz on \"Blink Twice\" and directing fiancé Channing Tatum\n\nZoë Kravitz has been an actress, producer, executive producer, and now, for the first time, a writer-director. She talks with correspondent Michelle Miller about coming from a family of celebrity performers; about her new film, the psychological thriller \"Blink Twice,\" in which she directs her now-fiancé Channing Tatum; and about her attraction to stories of strong women.\n\n06:43\n\nHorseshoe crabs: Ancient creatures who are a medical marvel\n\nCorrespondent Conor Knighton visits New Jersey beaches along the Delaware Bay to learn about horseshoe crabs – mysterious creatures that predate dinosaurs – whose very blood has proved vital to keeping humans healthy by helping detect bacterial endotoxins. He talks with environmentalists about the decline in the horseshoe crab population, and with researchers who are pushing the pharmaceutical industry to switch its use of horseshoe crab blood with a synthetic alternative used in medical testing.\n\n07:04\n\nJames Baldwin at 100\n\nA century after his birth in Harlem, the writer and activist James Baldwin is being celebrated for his visionary work, and for the many facets of his personality – Black, gay, playwright, essayist, New Yorker, expatriate – that transformed him into an iconic figure in the civil rights movement, even beyond his death in 1987 at age 63. \"Sunday Morning\" contributor Kelefa Sanneh looks back at the author of such noted works as \"Notes of a Native Son,\" \"The Fire Next Time,\" and \"Giovanni's Room.\"\n\n05:15\n\nJim Gaffigan's green thumb fails\n\nThe comedian has had a long interest in growing his own corn, and he's not letting a little thing like lack of knowledge about gardening (or the ready availability of canned corn) get in his way.\n\n02:29\n\nPhilippe Petit commemorates his legendary Twin Towers walk\n\nFifty years after Philippe Petit walked high above New York City between the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center, the French high-wire walker marked the anniversary this week with another walk, high in the nave of New York's St. John the Divine Cathedral.\n\n00:28\n\nHarry and Meghan on the dangers of online harm\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex's Archewell Foundation is launching a new initiative, The Parents Network, to support parents whose children have been victimized by online bullying. \"Sunday Morning\" anchor Jane Pauley talks with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle about the dangers of social media and suicide ideation; and with parents in the foundation's pilot program, who open up about how it has helped in their healing process after their child took their own life. [If you or someone you know is in emotional distress or a suicidal crisis, you can reach the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline by calling or texting 988. You can also chat with the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline here.]\n\n09:14\n\nNancy Pelosi on Harris, Trump, and \"The Art of Power\"\n\nThere is no denying the impact that Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, the 19-term Democrat from California, has had on Congress and the country, as she details in her new book, \"The Art of Power.\" Pelosi talks with \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Lesley Stahl about her role in President Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the presidential race; the near-fatal attack on her husband by an assailant at their San Francisco home (she was the intended target); the violence of the January 6 Insurrection at the Capitol; her advice for Vice President Kamala Harris as she runs against former President Donald Trump; and how she considers Trump's pick for running mate, Ohio Senator JD Vance.\n\n09:23\n\nPhilippe Petit on his Twin Towers walk, 50 years later\n\nOn August 7, 1974, French highwire artist Philippe Petit walked a VERY high wire illicitly strung between the Twin Towers of New York City's World Trade Center. He talks with correspondent Martha Teichner about the feat that captured the imagination of the world, and about his passion for wire-walking which, he says, has never changed.\n\n05:55\n\nThe journey of rapper-turned-country singer Jelly Roll\n\nThe artist known as Jelly Roll is a 39-year-old former rapper whose songs tell of the troubled life he used to lead. He's now one of the biggest names in country music, with two Grammy nominations this year. With correspondent Kelefa Sanneh, we go with Jelly Roll to one of the jail cells he lived in, where he wrote songs and hatched his plans to make it in music—eventually finding himself on the \"holy ground\" of Nashville's Grand Ole Opry. (This story was originally broadcast on January 7, 2024.)\n\n08:33\n\nPresident Biden on the stakes of this election\n\nIn his first interview since withdrawing from the race, the president reflects on his decision to end his bid for reelection; and what he says is the importance of defeating Trump to protect democracy.\n\nJames Baldwin at 100\n\nA century after his birth in Harlem, the writer and activist is being celebrated for his visionary work, and for the many facets of his personality – Black, gay, New Yorker, expatriate – that transformed him into an iconic figure in the civil rights movement.\n\nCarol Burnett & Sutton Foster: \"Once [again] Upon a Mattress\"\n\nIn 1959 Carol Burnett burst onto the New York stage in the musical comedy \"Once Upon a Mattress.\" In the new Broadway revival, two-time Tony-winner Sutton Foster recreates the role of Winnifred, a princess in search of a suitable mate.\n\nJim Gaffigan's green thumb fails\n\nThe comedian has had a long interest in growing his own corn, and he's not letting a little thing like lack of knowledge about gardening (or the ready availability of canned corn) get in his way.\n\nWill this be Kamala Harris' moment to make history?\n\nIn a week's time, the vice president has all but locked in her party's nomination, racked up an impressive list of endorsements, and hauled in a mountain of cash. Constituencies who had tuned out of the 2024 campaign are tuning back in.\n\nThe journey of rapper-turned-country singer Jelly Roll\n\nThe artist known as Jelly Roll is a 39-year-old former rapper whose songs tell of the troubled life he used to lead. He's now one of the biggest names in country music, with two Grammy nominations this year.
