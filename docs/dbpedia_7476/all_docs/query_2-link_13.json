Rheinhardt is content to parrot WUSA's reactionary editorial stance on the air, even if he doesn't agree with it. Rheinhardt finds his cynical detachment challenged by a lady friend, Geraldine, and by Rainey, a neighbour and troubled idealist who becomes aware of WUSA's sinister, hidden purpose. And when events start spinning out of control, even Rheinhardt finds he must take a stand.",

        "text": "In a world without shame or empathy, those who feel are deemed either foolish or mad. Success is judged in degrees of power and wealth, and those who seek them do so without a thought for the ones under their feet, or left by the wayside. They exist only to manipulate (to use, to fuck, to shatter), as grist for the mill of personal progress.\n\nThere is neither truth nor sincerity, only lies and cynicism; all that attracts power (bodies, wealth, obedience) is preached and clung to. Only fools believe, willfully climbing aboard the conveyor belt that carries them to slaughter.\n\nThose who understand the horror which surrounds them have precious few options: join, fight, or die. Trying to stay…\n\nCynical drifter Rheinhardt (Paul Newman) lands a job at a right-wing radio station with a sinister true agenda, in this drama co-starring Joanne Woodward, Anthony Perkins and Laurence Harvey.\n\nIt’s a very odd film, and seems confused about what it wants to be, as the dialogue-heavy scenes seem like a social issue movie, while the plot developments seem to make it a melodrama, yet there are also thriller elements that remain undeveloped. I think the film is trying to do too many things at once, and so doesn’t really end up being any of them.\n\nIt was a flop at the time, and I can definitely see why; the story, whilst starting out promisingly, doesn’t really go anywhere, resulting in…\n\nIn the ubiquitously inquisitive and insightful 2022 documentary “The Last Movie Stars,” its director Ethan Hawke and cast of talking heads do not fold and become one-hundred percent all-of-the-time sycophants. Instead, they blast off on what a stinkeroo WUSA was, a 1970 political-charged pet project. The clips used in Hawke’s documentary make it appear heavy-handed and incendiary. Actually watching the movie, well, it’s more heavy-handed and unfocused. Paul Newman is a radio deejay for an extreme right-wing station in New Orleans, and the movie doesn’t even show him at his damn job until the 32-minute mark. Joanne Woodward is just some kind of loafer in the city. I thought Anthony Perkins was some kind of photojournalist at first, but instead,…\n\nDisillusionment In Sun-Drenched 1970s American New Wave Cinema: A Watching Brief\n\nYep, diving back into this project yet again and seeing if I might actually be able to finish it this year!*\n\nNot the most interesting film to get back into it with though. Paul Newman claimed at one point this was the most significant and the best film he ever made. Well, it perhaps could have been the former (if it was good, which it wasn't) but it absolutely was not the latter.\n\nWUSA is a meandering and ultimately completely aimless social and political drama with two separate story strands that connect together late on but never really feed into each other in a particularly convincing way. Stuart Rosenberg…\n\nMy oh my, what a mess.\n\nWUSA has great credentials; a talented and beautiful cast including Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Anthony Perkins and Laurence Harvey star in a genre that interests me, that of the political conspiracy thriller. But it fails to sustain interest on any level and swiftly sinks into a meandering, pretentious mess that thinks its deeper and more profound than it actually is.\n\nPaul Newman stars as an itinerant drifter or, as he claims 'a communicator', called Reinhardt who arrives in New Orleans looking for work and ways to spend his time. He comes across both in the shape of Joanne Woodward's call girl and an offer to be a DJ for the right leaning local radio…\n\nLet me start by saying that this film is a mess . It’s absolutely all over the place and is as grim and depressing as you could ever wish for in a movie but it’s not without its interesting moments and they are the comparisons of 1969 USA and Trumps , 2019 USA .\n\nRheinhardt has failed in his marriage and career, and has become a cynical alcoholic. When he gets a job reading the news at right-wing radio station WUSA, he goes through the motions because it pays well, though he disagrees with the station's viewpoint. After a shy activist named Rainey starts inquiring about a political conspiracy centered at the station, Rheinhardt becomes troubled by what he discovers…\n\nI wanted to like this film more but I felt like something was missing (maybe humanity?).\n\nPaul Newman is an alcoholic DJ who stumbles into New Orleans and takes a job for a radical ultra conservative politician working at their radio station (WUSA) - so he can get money to stay drunk and stoned. Why WUSA would want someone like Newman baffles me.\n\nAlong the way he runs into Joanne Woodward, doing whatever she can to not starve. She is the only sympathetic person in the film and I give her 5 stars for her performance. She is stunning. I love that her explanations about her facial scar change every time someone asks what happened.\n\nCue in Anthony Perkins, a…"
