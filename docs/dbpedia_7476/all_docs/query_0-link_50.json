        "text": "New! This update adds a preview of centralized AI assistance, called Copilot in Windows. This makes Windows 11 the first PC platform to add centralized AI assistance to help you get things done. This first preview focuses on the integrated UI.\n\nTo start, select the Copilot in Windows button on the taskbar (or press WIN + C). Copilot in Windows uses the same Microsoft account (MSA) or Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account you used to sign in to Windows. Note that Azure AD will change to Microsoft Entra ID.\n\nCopilot in Windows appears as a side bar on the right of your screen. It will not overlap with desktop content or block open app windows.\n\nYou can ask questions or take actions, such as:\n\nCopilot in Windows with Bing Chat generates responses that are contextual and improves your experience in Windows.\n\nTo learn what Bing does with your data, go to Microsoft Privacy Statement. To learn how Microsoft develops AI technology responsibly, see Microsoft’s commitment to responsible AI.\n\nNote The update to Windows 11, version 22H2 coming on September 26, 2023, will be broadly available to Windows customers around the world. Copilot in Windows will start to release in preview to a select set of global markets. It is our intention to continue to broaden availability over time.\n\nNew! In the coming weeks, you might see a new ranking of the most recently used files in the Recommended section of the Start menu. This ranking considers when you last used the file, the file extension, and more. This means that you might not see the files in a purely reverse chronological order of when you last used them.\n\nNew! This update adds an enhanced volume mixer to Quick Settings. Using it, you can customize audio for each app separately. You can also swap audio devices whenever you want. The new keyboard shortcut (WIN + CTRL + V) gets you to the volume mixer fast.\n\nIt is also easier to turn on the Windows Spatial Audio experience. A new quick access list shows you all the spatial audio technology installed on your device. To find more spatial sound technology, such as Dolby and DTS, go to the Microsoft Store.\n\nNew! A new details pane in File Explorer (ALT + Shift + P) helps you access related content, stay up to date with file activity, and collaborate without opening a file. When you select a file in File Explorer and turn on the pane, the pane displays contextual information about the file. This includes a file thumbnail, its sharing status and button, emails, and more. To turn it on, select the View menu and choose Details pane. Then use the button located on the right side of the command bar to turn on the pane.\n\nNew! In Microsoft Excel, Narrator gives a more succinct and efficient reading experience. It prioritizes announcements based on what you need to skim a workbook. You can use keyboard shortcuts to customize them. To learn more, see the Enhanced Narrator support in Excel documentation. This new experience is available from the Microsoft Store. So, it might take a few minutes to be available on your device.\n\nNew! This update adds commands to correct words that voice access fails to recognize. You can say “correct [text]” to correct specific text. Use “correct that” to correct text you last dictated. The correction window appears with a list of words labelled with numbers. You can say “click [number]” to select any word from the list. If you choose a word from the window, that word replaces the text you want to correct. You can also say “spell that” or “spell out” to dictate the correct spelling of text. You get suggestions as you spell out the text. All the words and phrases that you spell are added to the Windows dictionary. They will appear as suggestions when you try to spell the text again.\n\nNew! Voice access now works right when you start your PC. You can turn on voice access from the accessibility flyout box on the Lock screen. To turn it on automatically, go to Settings > Accessibility > Speech. Choose the setting to “Start voice access before you sign in to your PC.” Then you can use voice access to sign in to your PC and access other areas on the Lock screen.\n\nFollow the instructions on the voice access bar to get your focus on the password field. Use your voice to dictate your password or PIN. You can say “show keyboard” to bring up the touch keyboard with number labels on it. Say the number on the key to enter the letter associated with it. This will mask the password you enter from being heard by anyone in your vicinity. You can also use other commands, such as “show numbers” or “click [element name]” to access other elements on the touch keyboard.\n\nNew! Passkeys are a simple and more secure replacement for passwords when you sign in to a website or application that supports them. You can now go to any app or website that supports passkeys to create a passkey that uses Windows Hello. Once you create a passkey, you can use Windows Hello (face, fingerprint, or PIN) to sign in. In addition, you can use your phone or tablet to sign in.\n\nNew! This update adds Enhanced Phishing Protection in Microsoft Defender SmartScreen. It helps to protect school and work passwords from phishing and unsafe use on websites and in apps. This works if you have turned on the warning options for Windows Security. Go to App & browser control > Reputation-based protection > Phishing protection. When it is on, a dialog appears that warns you about using a password in a way that is not safe. For example, reusing a password is not safe.\n\nNew! Enterprise customers can now set theEnablePasswordlessExperience policy. Once you set the policy, it hides passwords for some Windows authentication scenarios. This is true for signing in to a device and for in-session authentication scenarios. These include web browser password managers, “Run as” admin, and User Account Control (UAC). This policy applies to machines that are joined to AAD. Users can recover their passwords using a Windows Hello for Business PIN reset or by signing in on the web. They can do this without help from the IT helpdesk.\n\nNew! You can turn on Auto Color Management (ACM) on your Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) display. ACM makes all the colors on all your Windows apps appear accurately and consistently on every supported display. This is true even if the apps are not color managed. To turn ACM on, go to Settings > Display > Advanced display. Choose theSDR display and turn on Automatically manage color for apps. See the requirements to use ACM in the table below.\n\nThere are no hard requirements for the display or connection. ACM can provide benefits even on 8-bit sRGB panels. However, we strongly recommend ACM devices to have panels with a wider-than-sRGB gamut. Ten-bits (10-bits) per color channel or greater is also advised as an option.\n\nNew! This update adds a new Settings home page. It has interactive cards that represent devices and account related settings. As you use your device, the page and cards adjust to give you the most relevant and useful information. In this release, there are up to seven cards (see below). More are coming soon.\n\nRecommended settings: It gives you options that help save you time.\n\nCloud storage: This shows your cloud storage use and lets you know when you are nearing capacity.\n\nAccount recovery: It helps you add more recovery information. This stops you from being locked out of your account.\n\nPersonalization: With just one click, you can change your background theme or color mode.\n\nMicrosoft 365: View a quick glimpse of your subscription status and benefits. Here, you can also perform some key actions instead of going to the web.\n\nXbox: Here, you can view your subscription status and manage the subscription.\n\nBluetooth Devices: You can quickly access and connect to your favorite Bluetooth devices.\n\nNote This experience is only available on Windows 11 Home and Pro editions. It is not on devices that companies manage.\n\nNew! Dev Drive is a new form of storage volume. It gives developers what they need to host source code, working folders, and package caches. Dev Drive is built on Resilient File System (ReFS) technology. Dev Drive also has Performance mode. It is a new Microsoft Defender Antivirus capability. Performance mode minimizes the impact on developer workloads. You can create a Dev Drive using free space on an existing drive or create a VHD/VHDX. Go to the Settings app within System > System > For developers. You can also set it up using the command-line. A Dev Drive must be at least 50 GB or higher in size. We recommend that you have 8 GB or higher of RAM on your device. To learn more, see Set up a Dev Drive on Windows 11 (Public Preview).\n\nNew! The update adds Adaptive Dimming. This works for PCs that have presence sensors that support attention detection. Now your device can dim your screen when you look away and undim it when you look back. To turn it on, go to Settings > Privacy & security > Presence sensing. You can also turn on Presence Sensing when you are setting up a new device. It is an option for your privacy settings."
