        "text": "Hey folks! You’re welcome to the review of “My Dream 2”, written by Evangelist Gloria Bamiloye and directed by Evangelist Richard Omidiwura. I remember the pleasant atmosphere generated by the first part and I’m pleased to say that this sequel is even more so. With Mama Tunde and Tunde now on the Lord’s side, we get to see Christ at work more in this film, but the conflict arises naturally from a situation that predates the original film.\n\n“My Dream 2” touches as many aspects as “My Dream”, and Mr Ishola’s is very pertinent, as it addresses some feedback I got from the resolution of the latter: What does he as a child of God do with two wives? The consequences and ripple effect of, as well as the way forward and possibilities of God’s peace in that situation are portrayed in this movie.\n\nMama Tunde’s subplot, if I may call it that, looks into how she manages her relationship with her parents who had been the ones fueling the fire of ungodliness and evil in her life. Since they can no longer sin together with her, they inevitably sin against her, and we know what happens to the enemies of God’s people.\n\nTunde also has returning demons to deal with; thankfully, he now has a godly mother who lets him in on the efficacy of God’s word. The scenes involving him and her showed me how indeed, we as God’s children literally need God’s word like oxygen to truly be alive. Tunde’s choice not only changed him but one of his girlfriends from “My Dream”, which signifies how our decisions have the potential for positive impact on others.\n\nWith cameos from music minister Lawrence Oyor, and veteran drama minister, Evangelist Shola Mike-Agboola reprising his role as Teacher, “My Dream 2” is a heartfelt, pleasing viewing.\n\nAlright, we’ve come to the end of this review. You can share the lessons you got from it in the description below.\n\nThe link to the movie is https://youtu.be/_SG0zMTAyW0\n\nTill the next article, stay blessed!\n\nHey folks! You’re welcome to the review of “Surrender”, a feature film from One Goal Academy. It was written and directed by Dupe Olorunjo.\n\n“Surrender” is a truly remarkable movie. The first thing that struck me about it is the fact that it is a sequel, to a short movie “12 Years and a Day”, an adaptation of a Biblical story. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a short film having a feature-length second part before, at least, as far as gospel film production is concerned. So, that got me really interested. The first movie itself was a blessing to me: a creative retelling with realistic dialogue, effective delivery of lines and credible acting. This was replicated in “Surrender”, along with its skillful optimization of numerable cast.\n\nJust when I was beginning to think that I might have seen it all this year in terms of top quality gospel movies, “Surrender” has come on the scene with a production in which the power and presence of God are palpable. First off, it gives you a story you can relate to, and I can’t stress how important it is for gospel movies to do this. The medium called film is one that should be intrinsically engaging; hence, no Christian film ought to be boring, more so in this Computer Age. We’re not talking about merely making the audience laugh; it’s about immersing them in a production through careful storytelling. “Surrender” goes further to give virtually every character an arc that would touch you in one way or another.\n\nThe best faith-based movies I’ve seen this year have either moved me to amazement, godly introspection, faith, prayer or action; this one moved me to tears, a renewed consciousness of God’s presence and a yearning for the kind of relationship God wants with His children, and many more. “Surrender” is itself an adaptation, and it’s amazing how the writer has linked up the two stories in the franchise, so far.\n\nConclusively, “Surrender”, along with “12 Years and a Day”, is a movie I would recommend that you watch 200%.\n\nAlright, we’ve come to the end of this review. Have you seen “Surrrender”? What did you think about it? Please let me know your thoughts in the comments section below. The links to both movies are below:\n\n12 Years and a Day https://youtu.be/d13J0wkSjG4\n\nSurrender https://youtu.be/F1DnN02TaY4\n\nTill the next article, stay blessed!\n\nAffliction Permitted 2 shares a similar thematic preoccupation with its original movie, which, in my own words, is the importance of being in alignment with God’s will for our lives. It shows that a different positioning could spell doom even in the lives of God’s people if not quickly redirected. And this is true: we cannot claim to be genuine children of God if we do not obey Him. That would only mean that we worship Him with our lips, while our hearts are far from Him.\n\nThis film’s plot, I would say, is rather harsh on its characters. A new persona, Faith, has her marital life begin Affliction Permitted 2: Despite God revealing His marital “choices” to her, they inexplicably end up getting married to other ladies. Her epiphany dictates that she has been spiritually lethargic, and within the first third of the movie, this conflict is resolved. What this sequel tells the audience contradicts what it shows us about Faith: I feel that if nothing else, she exhibits unwavering trust in God after years of marital disappointment. That God would reveal His will to her and then keep mute about a supposed lack of fervency is utterly unlikely. Making the matter direr, this subplot is completely inconsequential to the main plot and thus, should not have been included in the first place.\n\nIn the lives of the protagonists, Benedict and Loveth, Affliction Permitted 2 seemed to have forgotten where its original movie ended, thus causing ambiguity in its initial temporal settings. In retrospect, it was probably done in order to set up its villain’s motivation, which from the get-go I’d perceived to be a forced and cheap justification for such a core part of the movie’s conflict. It therefore bothers me that after all the crisis and resolution in Affliction Permitted, Benedict and Loveth experience more losses in this second movie, and the manner of it confounds me.\n\n1Corinthians 10:13 tells us that God would not test us beyond our ability and would always make a way out. Furthermore, James 1:13 enlightens us that God does not tempt us with evil. How then could one of the God-representations in this movie say “Mission accomplished” after the greatest tragedy the couple had ever known befalls them? How could a person Jesus died for be compared to Job who didn’t have God’s promises in the covenant sealed with the precious blood of the Lamb? How would God lead Benedict to leave his ailing son to minister healing to another sick child whose diabolical father’s monetary gift would cause that son’s death, even after God had promised healing for him? I find these scenarios to be inconsistent with the scriptures.\n\nTechnically speaking, the sound design for movies could involve original soundtracks, non-copyright tunes and a skilful use of silence across different scenes; extended and repeated use of the same instrumentals is monotonic. Also, movies with God-characters need to get His costume, and grammaticality of His dialogue spot-on. On a general note as well, original films that point to a God-given assignment for the protagonist need to put in more effort to show the expanse of such tasks in their second parts.\n\nIt is my prayer that for subsequent productions, the story will be critically looked into, so that all nations will see God as He truly is – One in whom there is no darkness (1John 1:5).\n\nThe link to the movie is https://youtu.be/4UgfJ44Jves\n\nTill the next article, stay blessed!\n\nFilm Credits\n\nAffliction Permitted (2022)\n\nGCDM Film Productions\n\n99 minutes\n\nCast\n\nMuyiwa Omotara as Benedict\n\nElizabeth Ozohu as Loveth\n\nGrace Banigbe as Ruth\n\nOluwadamilola Abiodun as Faith\n\nBoluwatife Omotara as Jane\n\nGodwin Oluwasegun as Accuser\n\nDirector\n\nFemi Adebile\n\nWriter\n\nMuyiwa Omotara ‘Chosen’\n\nCinematographer\n\nFashikun Francis\n\nEditor\n\nAyomide Balogun\n\nBattle of the Gates presents an expansive story about Anthony, a young man with the world at his fingertips, until he realizes how empty his life is without God. This discovery takes him down the route of salvation which presents challenges he’s not willing to face.\n\nI’d love to point out that the publicity for this movie is one of the best I’ve seen in years. It had different poster pictures, two teasers and a countdown to its release. Adding a trailer or two to this set would make a perfect advertising combination in my opinion.\n\nThe feature does well to go the extra mile to establish a number of its characters. In a sense therefore, Battle of the Gates has the soul of a series. Its leisurely pace sufficiently shows us the world of our protagonist, whose life is further complicated when he is unfortunately deceived into thinking a Christian lifestyle endorses sinful living. When his friend in iniquity comes to the knowledge of Christ, and confronts demons Anthony has avoided, the tables turn and he becomes vengeful, wanting to prove that a holy Christian life isn’t possible. The conflict is set up nicely for its second part, which it works through to resolve.\n\nBattle of the Gates outlines the paths available to every human in the world and admonishes us to go for that less-trod but eternally profitable way.\n\nThe links to the movie: https://youtu.be/X1R7hSqelsU https://youtu.be/hZptfk6UEwM\n\nFilm Credits\n\nBattle of the Gates (2022)\n\nImpact Global Ministries\n\n174 minutes\n\nCast\n\nFiyinfolu CP Okedare as Anthony\n\nIsaac Femi-Akintunde as Mr Kuti\n\nFeyi Adeopoju as Mrs Kuti\n\nJohn Oguntuase as Femi\n\nSeun Adejumobi as Corporate\n\nEsan Oluwatomi as Nike\n\nTobi Olumuyiwa as Pascal\n\nDirector\n\nDamilola Fasesan\n\nWriter\n\nDamilola Fasesan\n\nCinematographer\n\nSesan Afolayan\n\nEditor\n\nDistinct Creative Media\n\nIma & God was released on October 14, 2022 by Zionhome Drama Outreach Ministry. It narrows in on the importance of our actions in correlation to God’s instructions to us.\n\nThis is a title that I really like, and coupled with its impressive poster design, I eagerly expected a story that would resonate at a personal level. The matter of “God said…” in potential courtships is an age-long phenomenon that has been severally applied and received by different people. Ima & God tries to illustrate how a child of God backed by God’s word could make a hash of the whole thing. Many that have experienced this will find some wisdom in this movie, in their subsequent dealings with the Holy Spirit.\n\nIn the film’s pursuit of dynamism, Ima & God in my opinion, sadly becomes rather too clever for its own good. The entire opening sequence of three scenes was immaterial in the long run. It ambitiously ties viable knots of conflict but gets so tangled in them itself that the resolution was predictably precipitate. Furthermore, its cuts to new scenes were sometimes confusing. Also, the story seems to be more about Richard than the eponymous Ima; she could have done with the development given to Ajim, who really could have just been a random bad guy. Lastly, portraying God as being so detailed to Ima and Denilson at the outset, only to become reticent for no stated or implied factor at the most crucial point could be misrepresenting.\n\nIn conclusion, Ima & God is a caution for Christians not to take a word from God and make a paragraph out of it. It is vital that while we follow God’s past leadings, we learn to be patient to know what He has for us at every point in time.\n\nThe link to the movie is https://youtu.be/3f9wbqVipy0\n\nTill the next article, stay blessed!\n\nFilm Credits\n\nIma & God (2022)\n\nZionhome Drama Outreach Ministry\n\n67 minutes\n\nCast\n\nBamike Are as Ima\n\nAyo Afolabi as Richard\n\nSegun Oyeyemi as Denilson\n\nTemitayo Idowu as Omolola\n\nChosen-Mic Adeniran as Ajim\n\nDirector\n\nTolulope Ibasanmi\n\nWriter\n\nFemi Fakayode\n\nCinematographer\n\nTolulope Ibasanmi\n\nEditor\n\nTolulope Ibasanmi\n\nApostle Ben is a riveting motion picture that centres on life in the marketplace or workplace and what is expected of children of God there. Ushered in by cool jazz music, its opening scenes set the mood for an interesting watch. It was quite refreshing to see a movie whose key setting and tone were official. Hearing a lot of shoptalk in specific fields isn’t a common experience in watching faith-based movies; so, I really enjoyed this one.\n\nApostle Ben has something that I’ve sorely missed in many Christian films this year – a good story. It’s quite obvious that the concept for the movie was born from a burden, and it was well executed. I love how it initially leads us to Cossy before taking us to Mr Oluremi. That way, its major characters receive the sufficient development its runtime allows. The twist felt organic to the plot and the editing brilliantly navigates a lengthy all-important narration by creating an illusion of oscillation in time passage.\n\nThis is not to say that the movie couldn’t have done better in, for example, occasional overacting by a few characters, glaring dialogue replacement, flash-timed reaction shots and B-rolls, unnecessary discrepancies between dialogue and subtitles, and unimportant snapshots at the end – all of which were a bit distracting for me. However, the overall quality and content of Apostle Ben far outweigh any of its shortcomings in my opinion.\n\nAnother thing I have to give Apostle Ben credit for is that this is one movie that knows where to insert and commence the right kind of music at different points in time. It furthermore does this justice by including every song and tune used in it at the end credits for easy reference. More impressively, they were composed and performed fully or in part by the producers. The end credits surprisingly came after an epilogue that contained a powerful charge for Christians to reflect Christ in their workplaces and for anyone serving Him to be confident that God never fails His own. They were accompanied by a catchy end credits song intro that has become my new favourite. I recommend this film for your viewing pleasure and blessedness.\n\nThe link to the movie is https://youtu.be/r9loYbvIvQA\n\nTill the next article, stay blessed!\n\nFilm Credits\n\nApostle Ben (2022)\n\nA MASS TV production\n\n57 minutes\n\nCast\n\nKayode Babalola as Apostle Ben\n\nDeborah Olorunnisola as Elizabeth\n\nAramide Oloko as Cossy\n\nSegun Adelaja as Archbishop Julius Abaado\n\nSamuel Daniel as Yemi\n\nDirector\n\nTolulope Toluwase\n\nStory\n\nShobowale Ebenezer\n\nCinematographer\n\nOlayinka Bolade Emmanuel\n\nEditor\n\nTolulope Toluwase\n\nHey folks! You’re welcome to the review of My Dream, written and produced by Evangelist Gloria Bamiloye and directed by Evangelist Richard Omidiwura. It was premiered on YouTube on September 17, 2022 before being made public a week later.\n\nI consider My Dream’s approach to creating protagonists a bit unique, in the sense that it’s tough to pin it down to one individual’s journey. It felt like four intertwined stories of almost equal measure, all a blessing to me. On first impressions, the story seems to be about Deolu, whose dreams of greatness are tested when he’s faced with a decision that might change the course of his life. Subsequently though, I observed the film also follows Mama Tunde, giving us a bit of her backstory, motivations and desires. Mr Ishola and Mama Deolu also have a bit of screen time for us to learn submission to God. So, as much as I’m a proponent for that one compelling protagonist, I enjoyed having different stories to follow that were able to achieve balance at the end of the day.\n\nAll characters played their roles well and it was like music to my ears, as Evangelist Shola Mike-Agboola’s soothing voice and fluid delivery of lines breezed over the Jay-Mikee-led sound department’s film scores in a good number of scenes, as Teacher. Also, Deolu’s friends, played by Tomisin Fasola and Sewedo Wusa, took their exchanges of dialogue very well.\n\nThe peaceful atmosphere in My Dream registered to my senses that, in the final analysis, everything would be okay. For every child of His, God has inspired a dream; we have to note though, that there’s always a process and a passage of time. Between ‘little’ and ‘large’ is usually a journey of challenges, as in the cases of Joseph and David in the Bible. Each obstacle has to be a stepping stone to the next level. It is required at such times for us to get more intimate with God in prayer and Bible study, remain on the side of righteousness, maintain a positive attitude while confessing God’s word, count your blessings, and never get discouraged, even if at times, you’d be the one to encourage yourself in God. In all, just keep moving forward.\n\nIf you’ve seen My Dream, please share your thoughts about it with me, so we can be blessed together. If you thought this article was valuable, please like and share it. Thank you very much!\n\nThe link to the movie is https://youtu.be/cpzR5flVeps\n\nTill the next article, stay blessed!\n\nHey folks! You’re welcome to the review of BEYOND I DO 3 and 4. The movie more or less proceeds from where the first sequel ends.\n\nBefore I go any further, I would say that Beyond I Do currently has a need for identity definition – it has shown itself to be either a franchise of sequels or a series of episodes. The first movie was fine and the second was better, only that it ended with no resolution. Now, almost a year after, it seems it has evolved into a series. Hence, it has produced two episodes of about forty minutes each, with cliffhangers for subsequent episodes this year. If that’s what it is now to be, the recaps of previous episodes and previews of following episodes need to be more concisely and stylishly done.\n\nThe string of conflicts in Jide’s and Sharon’s marriage continues, and we can all learn as children of God that though unprecedented and shameful situations might occur, opening up to your spouse is a covering for you. Solutions come in the midst of openness and Christians can only thrive under the light of Christ.\n\nJide and Sharon strangely choose darkness when its symbol in Jide’s mother makes her move. They conveniently forget their pastor and his wife whom they’ve always confided in. The result puts Sharon especially, in a pitiful state. On another end, Jide’s friend, Mike, succeeds in getting him dismissed from work, while he himself receives an unpleasant visit from old allies. Subsequent episodes will reveal what will become of Beyond I Do series’ plot and subplots.\n\nTill the next article, stay blessed!"
