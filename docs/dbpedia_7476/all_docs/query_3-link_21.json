        "text": "Robert Stone, who wrote ambitious, award-winning novels about errant Americans in dangerous circumstances or on existential quests — or both — as commentary on an unruly, wayward nation in the Vietnam era and beyond, died on Saturday at his home in Key West, Fla. He was 77.\n\nHis wife, Janice, said the cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Mr. Stone was previously given a diagnosis of emphysema — “my punishment for chain smoking,” he said in a 2010 interview with The San Francisco Chronicle — although he quit smoking in 1982.\n\nA seagoing Navy man who later spent beatnik years in New York that evanesced into hippiedom in California, Mr. Stone led an adventuresome early life that was crucial in the development of his work. He participated fully in the drug-fueled 1960s, when he spent time with the novelist Ken Kesey and his friends, known as the Merry Pranksters, whose notoriety was spread by Tom Wolfe in “The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test”; and he briefly spent time as a Vietnam War correspondent.\n\nThe author of eight novels, a pair of story collections and a memoir, “Prime Green: Remembering the Sixties” (2007), Mr. Stone may not have been especially prolific, but his novels were big and serious, commanding attention as literary events and often seized upon by critics as an opportunity to write about the novelistic traditions he was either perpetuating, stretching, satirizing or defying.\n\nThey include “Dog Soldiers,” set in Vietnam and California, the tale of a heroin-smuggling deal gone horribly wrong that won the National Book Award in 1975; “A Flag for Sunrise” (1981), a Pulitzer Prize finalist about an American professor and others drawn into the ominous pre-revolution politics of a Central American nation reminiscent of Nicaragua on the eve of the Sandinista coup; “Outerbridge Reach” (1992), about the crises, both spiritual and real, of a solo sailor attempting to circumnavigate the globe and win a race; and “Damascus Gate” (1998), a thriller set in Jerusalem and Gaza involving gun-smuggling, drugs and the intifada. Collectively and individually, they earned Mr. Stone comparisons to a wide range of literary lions, from Beckett to Hemingway to Graham Greene.\n\n“There has always been a strain of American fiction that seems to grow directly from Melville and Conrad,” the novelist Mona Simpson wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1992. “The foremost voice of this sensibility in our time is Robert Stone.”\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
