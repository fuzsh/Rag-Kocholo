Using life experiences to fuel his passion and words, he was also influenced by reading other books and so crafted a story, but things didn’t go as planned.\n\nHe wrote 75 pages of his first book Money, Sex and Murder, a story of two young men from S.E. D.C. who are deeply rooted into the world of the “streets,” before beating his case. Returning home, he planned on finishing the book in his spare time, but other interests took priority.\n\nHe was back in prison six weeks later after being shot in the leg and his close friend killed. This time he moved forward, publishing his book through a print on-demand company while still in jail, however the book didn’t do as well as he’d hoped.\n\nWhen Live returned home he established his own company Top Echelon, a film, music, and publishing firm and published Money, Sex and Murder again. This time there was a complete turn around. Real Live’s brilliant move of incorporating his music into his book when the characters listened to his songs was a winner.\n\nThe connection that he has with his fans has opened many doors. Live said he uses his books as a ‘stepping stone’ for his music. “I had a plan from day one, I love to write books and I’m good at it! People like it, and not just people who like me. When I was in jail, a lot of prisoners from different states liked it.\"\n\nLive believes his books will help him expand the audience for his music. “It will be that much easier to start to release music, and I already have amassed a small fan base already.”\n\nMeanwhile Live believes it is easier to make money from his book at the moment than from music. “A book is something you buy, it’s not like a mix-tape, like a give-away.\"\n\nSeeming to be a jack-of-all-trades he’s still a master of one, being a businessman! “I want to make and break deals and be in control of whatever product I throw into a market,” he said.\n\nLives books can be found on the top l0 list of TLJ books store located in Forestville Md or on Amazon straight to your Kindle for just $5.99. He can also be contacted through Twitter @Livest_1 or FACEBOOK RealLiveScoop."
