        "text": "Keb’ Mo’: Bluesman Is Keeping It Real\n\nGary Tischler •\n\nMusically, the guy known as Keb’ Mo’ (a street variation on his given name of Kevin Moore) can do a lot of things. Whether it’s smooth or fast-paced rhythm and blues, funk, jazz, folk and even a little bit of country, here and there, he loves to collaborate with other musicians, notably jazz players or country legend Vince Gill and the great Bonnie Raitt.\n\nBut when you get down to it—and he can get down to it—Keb’ Mo’ is a blues man, pure but probably not so simple.\n\nIn a way, he’s keeping the tradition alive. The blues (and southern gospel) are the wellspring of rock-and-roll and American pop, rock and all that jazz as well as the songs and poetry of southern African Americans. He is a link to the Delta Blues of Lightning Hopkins, Robert Johnson, the Reverend Blind Gary Davis, Sonny Terry and others, but he’s also a blues man in the contemporary vein.\n\n“I tried to do something different every now and then,” said the Los Angeles-born star in a phone interview. “But you know, people know you for who you are, and they don’t want you to stray too far.”\n\nWhile he has a string of hit albums—his latest, coming out this month. “BLUESamericana” features songs and music played to good effect in the juicy stews of live performance. To that end, Keb’ Mo’ is playing again at the Music Center at Strathmore at 8:30 p.m., April 3. Perhaps not the hotbed of down and low, low down blues, but there it is.\n\n“People—everybody—respond to the songs,” he says. “It’s about real life. It’s modern blues, but it’s like the old blues, been-down-so -ong songs, people getting love, or sex, or love, losing it, trying to survive, get down with some joy in the music. Today, life is a little different, and I write my songs to be about today. The music, that comes from everywhere, from all the greats, but the songs, they’re mine.”\n\nHis voice is direct and smooth. Accessible, it speaks right to the heart and soul, and feet, as the blues are wont to do.\n\n“Yeah, sure, I like to play with other people,” he said. “That Bonnie Raitt, man, she can play. She is one bad-ass player. I can hardly keep up with her.” That’s not exactly true, although Raitt has a high-power way about her on stage, and her playing is what he says it is. “And country music, it’s like regular blues. It’s about drinking, lying, cheating, love, heartache, that kind of thing—you got those guys that could really sing that.”\n\n“Oh, yeah, I had some thoughts about being a rock star, you know that kind of life,” he said. He comes from Compton, Calif., a city in Los Angeles County. “That kind of thing … you know it took me a while to get everything straight, and forget about that. “ One of his musical mentors was a guy named Papa John Creach, who played with Jefferson Airplane, one of the premier rock bands from the San Francisco Bay area.\n\nThe really personal and original stuff in his music comes from his own life. He has even written songs for a children’s album, called “Big Wide Grin.” He appeared in 2001, on Sesame Street with the whole gang—Kermit the Frog, Grover, Elmo— all singing “Everybody Be Yo’self.”\n\nKeb’ Mo’ no longer lives in L.A. He and his wife moved to Franklin, Tenn., where they’re raising a six-year-old son named Carter. “That kid is a trip, let me tell you,” he said. “It’s an experience, you know, to be with a little kid. Everything’s new. They got all that energy.”\n\nThis is a blues man decidedly in the real world, doing his part: he’s part of the No Nukes group, for which he recorded his own version of the Buffalo Springfield song, “For What It’s Worth.”\n\nHe says “BLUESamericana” is a new phase for him. It’s different from his last album, which included India Arie, Vince Gill and Marcus Miller. If the last album, “The Reflection,” sounds personal, it is with a personality touched by the blues, for all the things that matter: “Do It Right,” “For Better or Worse”, “The Worst Is Yet To Come”, “Somebody Hurt You, “The Old Me Better”, and “I’m Gonna Be Your Man.”\n\nHe remains a traveling man. His tour stops at New York City; Victoria, Canada; Evanston, Ill.; Middletown, Ohio; Grants Pass, Oreg., Saratoga, N.Y.; Minneapolis, Minn., among many other places.\n\nBut home is in the back of his mind and where he came from, as he sings in a song about his bringing up in L.A. — “There’s More Than One Way Home”: “Daddy came around every once in a while/but momma, she was there all the time/and summertime in Compton was not like TV/but we were right there where we needed to be.”\n\nHe says he was influenced by Taj Mahal from the 1970s: “He was doing things his way and that’s what you do”—but he, too, has found that there is more than one way home. “My audience, it’s a little bit of everybody—older people, blues people, black and white, young people. Sometimes, I think I’m the oldest guy in the building.”\n\nMaybe yes; maybe no. Keb’ Mo’ sure doesn’t play or sing like the oldest anything when it the blues.\n\nPotomac’s Present & future\n\nGeorgetowner •\n\nWe live near it, skim its surface, appreciate its natural beauty — and taste it every day. It is the powerful Potomac River. It is our lifeline. It is our future.\n\nThe river and its water, which we drink, are in the news of late with discussions about D.C. Water’s plans for sewerage overflow at Georgetown Waterfront Park and other work in the District, improvements to the Washington Aqueduct and the issue of fracking far upstream of the Potomac watershed.\n\nWith April as Earth month and Earth Day April 22, this spring looks to the Potomac, even as we get ready to go boating on it. One of its greatest defenders is Stephanie Flack, who spoke recently at meetings with the Citizens Association of Georgetown and at Christ Church. “75 percent of people not on well water are not aware of where their water comes from,” she says. “They have no clue where their water comes from …yet one of the top concerns people have is the quality of their drinking water.” Flack is the Potomac River Project Director for the Nature Conservancy’s Maryland-D.C. Chapter. She speaks with the assurance of a scientist and the passion of a mother as she explains some complex natural actions in a simpler way. With the Nature Conservancy behind her, Flack gets to work close to her home in her backyard, as she says, “the Potomac.”\n\nThe Nature Conservancy was founded in 1951 and now has more than one million members. It works in all 50 states and more than 35 nations, it reports, and has “protected 119 million acres of land and thousands of miles of rivers worldwide — and we operate more than 100 marine conservation projects globally.” Its headquarters is in Arlington, and its CEO Mark Tercek lives in Georgetown.\n\nAlso at the March 18 CAG meeting were Thomas Jacobus, general manager of the Washington Aqueduct, and Peggy Fleming, who, with Sean Furmage, directed and wrote the 2012 documentary “Potomac: The River Runs Through Us,” which runs 30 minutes. It was shown to a packed room at the Long & Foster Georgetown office and is highly recommended viewing.\n\nAs for the Washington Aqueduct, it was built in 1863 under the direction of Gen. Montgomery Meigs, became fully operational in 1864 and is celebrating its 150th anniversary. While we can celebrate that built infrastructure, Flack says, “We need to think about the natural infrastructure — the forests, the wetlands — that contribute to our water supply…and quality of our water as natural filters.” We can appreciate such engineering feats, she says, but we also “have to think out to the next 150 years and what’s going to happen to the watershed that provides our water…and restoring the area as well.” “It’s a balancing,” she says of maintaining D.C. Water’s structures and pipes. “You can’t make up for nature.\n\n“The 14,000-square-mile watershed of the Potomac River is the primary source of drinking water for more than four million people in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan region,” Flack says. “This is the water that Members of Congress use to brew their coffee, and President Obama uses to wash his hands.”\n\nFlack grew up in Florida. Her father was a developer. She smiles at the irony. Flack earned science degrees from Princeton and Yale and was inspired by her professor, Alison Jolly, who died in February. One of her studies was about the Catskills and New York City drinking water. She worked for the World Bank in West Africa and saw how people directly depend on their environment. “Some people think that world history can be told through the history of the environment,” she says.\n\n“What’s happening in the Potomac watershed is a long-term issue,” Flack says. “We have a lot of population growth and a lot of land-use change and development. My mission is to try to help people understand that and to help motivate people to make long-term perspective investments in protecting and restoring the places where our water comes from.” She is keen to note that the single largest cultivated land crop in the Chesapeake watershed is turf grass. “Pesticide and fertilizer on lawns ends up in the water and has an effect,” she says. For our fight to protect the environment, Flack was worked 18 years at the Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit which says it “is rooted in good science — aided by our hundreds of staff scientists. We pursue non-confrontational, pragmatic solutions to conservation challenges.” Its CEO Mark Tercek wrote “Nature’s Fortune: How Business and Society Thrive by Investing in Nature.” The former Goldman Sachs executive argues that the commercial benefits of environmental protection go beyond paying for themselves.\n\nAs far as talks with local groups go, Flack says, “I think there is an appetite for this. There is a need to engage people and have these discussions about local issues…. Who doesn’t care about their water? I would really like to make this a front-of-mind issue for people because it is so tied up with our quality of life and ability to live.”\n\nGREEN FACT VS MYTHS\n\nBy Nicole Cusick\n\nLeaving something plugged in even when it is off can increase your energy bill.\n\nFACT: According to a study by the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, up to 5 percent of your energy bill could be standby power. That is about $4 billion per year of consumer spending.\n\nReplacing light bulbs with energy-efficient bulbs makes a difference.\n\nFACT: According to Energy Star, energy-efficient light bulbs use 75 percent less energy and last 10 to 25 times longer than traditional light bulbs. Even better, an energy-efficient bulb can save $40 to $135 over its lifetime.\n\nNever leave lights on when leaving a room.\n\nMYTH: With the CFL bulbs, it actually takes more energy to turn them off and on again when leaving the room for only a few minutes. The Department of Energy recommends leaving them on if you’ll be back in the room in less than 15 minutes.\n\nNatural cleansers aren’t strong enough to clean thoroughly.\n\nMYTH: There are many natural products you can use to clean your home efficiently, such as vinegar, while still avoiding harmful chemicals.\n\nHouseplants have health benefits.\n\nFACT: Houseplants can purify your air, reduce stress and put more moisture in the air, making you and your home healthier.\n\nWashing your clothes in cold water won’t clean them properly\n\nMYTH: It is true that detergent is not meant to be used in cold water, but many companies have come out with a cold detergent, making cold washes an option.\n\nOrganic food is always healthier.\n\nMYTH: A Stanford University study concluded that there is little evidence that organic food is significantly better for you. Still, it may lower your exposure to pesticides.\n\nInsulating your home can save energy and money.\n\nFACT: Making sure no air is escaping your home is one of the best ways to save\n\nenergy, according to Energy Star. Holes can lead to heat leaking out in the winter, which keeps the heater running longer. The same happens with an air conditioner\n\nin the summer.\n\nHybrid cars save you money.\n\nMYTH: In most cases, it will take up to 10 years for the extra money spent on the green capabilities of the car to accrue to the buyer, as reported by the New\n\nYork Times.\n\n“Food miles” contribute to a much larger carbon footprint in food production.\n\nMYTH: A recent study published by Environmental Science & Technology states that 83 percent of a food’s footprint actually comes from the production of the food itself.\n\nCoffee grounds can be used in the garden.\n\nFACT: Coffee grounds are full of nutrients for acidic plants, making it a nice mulch. They can also be saved from the garbage dump by throwing them in the compost bin.\n\nApril Earth Day Events\n\nEarth Day is April 22, but there are ways to celebrate all month long in D.C.

As I write this, I am still reviewing the mayor’s proposal, but I will discuss a few key items I have already seen.\n\nFirst, the mayor’s budget proposal includes much that I agree is important. For example, the mayor is committed to fully funding 4,000 sworn police officers, a critical item on which I introduced legislation several years ago. I also support many of the mayor’s transportation initiatives and full funding of the Housing Production Trust Fund at $100 million. Overshadowing many of these good ideas, however, is the list of things that are not in the budget. In each year of the economic recovery, the mayor and the Council have created a contingency list – known as the “wish list” – of items we want to fund but have not been able to put in the budget. Then, as revised revenue projections show more income, we have moved some of them from the list to the budget.\n\nRelating to tax policy, our Tax Revision Commission identified several areas of potential reform that are on the wish list rather than in the budget. My top priority is to recouple the District’s estate-tax level to the federal level, which adjusts with inflation every year. This change is particularly important for our seniors, many of whom cross the District’s threshold simply by owning a home here. Several other items of particular importance to me are additions to the Earned Income Tax Credit, which helps working families, and business tax relief, which helps encourage businesses to locate in our city, expanding our tax base. I also hoped the mayor would fund expansions to the personal exemption and standard deduction.\n\nOn the positive side, the mayor has funded a new tax bracket of 7.5 percent for individual income between $40,000 and $60,000. Though the change targets middle-income earners, it actually will reduce taxes for anyone making over $40,000 (because of the incremental way that state income taxes are calculated). The budget also includes a proposal to lower the business franchise tax rate from 9.975 percent to 9.4 percent.\n\nFinally, the budget includes allocations for projects of importance to Ward 2, such as $38 million for Garrison Elementary School.\n\nAlso in need of our attention is enhanced funding for the arts. Last year, I established a dedicated funding mechanism for the arts, tied to the sales tax. Due to our balanced budget requirements, it will not become fully effective until fiscal year 2018. This year, the mayor has proposed an operating budget of $16 million for the arts, along with $10 million on the wish list. I support this funding level, but believe the extra $10 million should be included in the fully funded budget to ensure that our arts community continues to benefit the District both educationally and economically.\n\nThis is a crucial time in the financial life of our city, particularly in light of the recent transition to a new chief financial officer. I will continue to review the budget proposal in the coming weeks. Please share your views with me and with my colleagues."
