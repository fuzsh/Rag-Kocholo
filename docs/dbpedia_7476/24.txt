Over the span of his career, Travilla designed some of the most well know actors and actresses in Hollywood. Over the next few weeks, we will give you a glimpse of Travilla’s sketch work to show you that he was more than just “The Man Who Dressed Marilyn Monroe”.

Here’s a behind the sketch look at Paul Newman, in the 1970’s film WUSA.

WUSA is a 1970 drama film, directed by Stuart Rosenberg. It was written by Robert Stone, based on his novel A Hall of Mirrors. The story involves a radio station in New Orleans with the eponymous call sign which is apparently involved in a so-called “right-wing conspiracy”. It culminates with a riot and stampede at a patriotic pep-rally when an assassin on a catwalk opens fire. The cast included Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Anthony Perkins, Laurence Harvey, Cloris Leachman and Wayne Rogers.
