This is Newman's #1 personal favorite of all his own films - a career spanning over 80 features. It's a cynical affair - deliberately paced by the director, politically charged and, in the final tally, highly interesting if leaning to the pretentious edges of 'Righty' exposing obviousness. Olive Films is handling WUSA's first move to DVD as they have with many other Paramount releases like My Favorite Spy , Where Love Has Gone, Knock on Wood and Harlow. I was impressed with the three Noir films they released - Appointment With Danger, William Dieterle's Dark City and Rudolph Mate's Union Station as well as the enjoyable Hammer-esque sci-fi Crack in the World from the mid 60`s.

This is a typical Olive Films release - dual-layered, progressive, anamorphic and looking impressive for the SD format. It is bare bones with no extras nor subtitles offered. This is competently transferred and supports the film well with a damage-free, very consistent presentation with no unsightly boosting. Detail, contrast and colors are all solid. WUSA looks better than I was expecting.

The mono sound is audible and clean. The film is hard to describe but I'd say does have definite merit. It can come across as a bit odd - but I may have found that part of WUSA's appeal. Newman is his usual magnetic-self and his wife and Perkins are excellent although none of the characters are geared to being compelling or likeable. It is this frankness and lack of sentimentality that reminded me of Altman a bit. Although I had seen this before - many years ago - I enjoyed this viewing much more. It's a film I will revisit as I continue to accept that it has more than meets the eye - under its surface. Olive continue to offer their disc at a high price if you take in to account the lack of supplements but, with Newman my all-time favorite actor, this is a film I am glad to own.
