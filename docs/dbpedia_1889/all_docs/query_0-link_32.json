To all who shall see or hear these presents read, be it known:\n\nWhereas the Directors of the Zeeland Chamber of the Chartered West India Company have now for many years past endeavoured by all conceivable means and ways, both by the re-sources of the Chamber itself, as well as by contracting with private persons, to increase, not only its trade and commerce from this country to the mainland coasts and islands situated under the Charter, but have also and especially made it their aim to further colonization and agriculture in the aforesaid countries, and yet without such success, results, and fruits as they had indeed hoped:\n\nTherefore, they, having by careful observation and long experience found that not only the islands lying within their province, but also the mainland coasts, and especially the Wild Coast extending from the River Amazon to.... degrees northwards, are of such situation and soil that everything can be cultivated, sown, planted, and raised there that can be cultivated and raised in the famous regions of Brazil, yet that, for the further increase of population and agricul-ture, there are required not only persons of reasonable means, industry, and experience, but also all other of lesser condition and ability, would, with the knowledge and approval of their their High Mightinesses the States-General of the United Netherlands and the General Chartered West India Company, agree, and do hereby agree, to offer and to submit the following Articles for the encouragement of one and all: -\n\nFirstly, that, under the sovereignty of the States-General and the authority of the Char-tered West India Company every one shall be at liberty to go from this country in his own, in hired, or in the Company's ships to the aforesaid Wild Coast, in order to choose there and take into possession such stretches of land as they shall have need of for their purpose and cultivation, to administer, populate, till, and plant the same on condition that they provide themselves with proper shoulder and side-arms, with their appurtenances.\n\nSecondly, when, by God's help, the population on the aforesaid Wild Coast shall have grown to 200 families or more, the colonists themselves shall provisionally, and with the approval of the Zeeland Chamber, elect three, five, or seven Councillors from their own number of the most honest, able, and wealthy, born in the seven United Provinces, or having lived for ten years under this Government, who shall under the Chamber administer justice according to the law of the Province of Zeeland, and shall decide all matters touching their condition and circumstances there, to which end the Zeeland Chamber will provide them with the proper commission from the States-General, and with authorization and instruction from the General Company, to which they shall be required to take the oath.\n\nThirdly, each one of the colonists shall have free possession, and use, in any manner he pleases, of the land and strand occupied by him, having and retaining free hunting, fishing, and fowling without paying any tax, tithe, or other poll-taxes for the space of five years, beginning with the year of making their choice and taking possession; but at the end of the five years the colonists shall be dealt with in all fairness, in any case not more exorbitantly than the inhabitants of the other islands, paying yearly for poll-tax 100 lbs. of tobacco - other commodities, such as sugar, indigo, cotton, and other products being reckoned an equivalent according to their value - unless at the time it should be deemed better to pay the tax of the tithes. In case, however, they leave the lands of which they have taken possession, these shall, after two years, again revert to the Company.\n\nFourthly, if any one of the colonists, through himself, his family, or his servant, discovers any minerals, crystals, stones, marble, of whatever sort, he shall be at liberty to take possession thereof, possess them, and use them for his own profit, for the term of five years; and after the five years the possessor shall be required only to pay a tithe to the Company.\n\nFifthly, the colonists shall be at liberty to carry on trade, and to transport their products and wares in their own or in the Company's ships (being required only to return to the place whence they sailed) free of all dues, as well for merchandise and agricultural implements which they desire to transport thither, as for products which they desire to export from there, only pay-ing tonnage, as other Caribbean traders navigating under the rules.\n\nSixthly, the aforesaid colonists shall also be at liberty to go to the coast of Africa and fetch as many negroes as they shall have need of or may desire to offer for sale, being subject like others to the Regulations made therefor or to be made.\n\nSeventhly, the colonists when any ships of the Company sails from here to the aforesaid coast, or when they find on the islands a ship of the Company destined thither, shall have free passage in that ship (only having to provide themselves with their own food and sustenance), to-gether with their agricultural implements, so far as the ship shall be able conveniently to hold then.\n\nEighthly, in order that everything may proceed with complete knowledge, all prospective planters going from here thither, whether in their own ship, or, where there is opportunity, in a ship of the Company, shall be required to ask for passports from the Zeeland Chamber; or if they journey thither from the islands, they shall, upon arriving there, give their names to the Commander of Essequibo, or his deputy, in order thus to have them registered with the Chamber here.\n\nThe Company reserves for itself only the trade and the gathering of the annatto dye, which nobody shall be at liberty to trade in, gather, or transport, on penalty of his life, and of the confiscation of all his goods; and also the interpretation of any obscurities which may occur in these [provisions], and moreover the right to change the mode of government after the space of five years, in case they find that circumstances there demand this, granting in the meantime to the colonists and lesser planters the liberty to appoint and maintain at their expense for the ser-vice of the Councillors, a sheriff, police officer, and secretary, together with a preacher, school-master, and Scripture Reader, subject only to the approval of the Zeeland Chamber.\n\nThis Chamber shall endeavour and shall do its utmost, either by contracting therefor, or through other means and opportunities, to order negroes for the aforesaid coast, and to send them for a reasonable price, to be paid from the products or otherwise, in such way as shall be best agreed upon together.\n\nThus done and provisionally drafted in our meeting of the 12th October, 1656.\n\nAcceptance of Above Conditions by Garret van Vyanen.\n\nThis done provisionally in our meeting, and thereafter a contract made with Gerret van Vyanen, and signed, both for himself and in the name of his constituents, in pursuance of the Resolution taken the 4th January, 1657.

NOTE RECORDING THE APPROVAL OF THE PROVISIONAL CONTRACT OF THE CITIES OF MIDDELBURG, FLUSHING ANF VERE\n\n[21 January 1658]\n\nThe provisional contract between the cities of Middelburg, Flushing (Vlissengen), and Vere and the Directors having been submitted for approval, it was thus approved and signed by the respective members of the Committee, and entered upon these Minutes under date of the 21st January, 1658, following hereafter.\n\nThere was read a letter from Cornelis Goliat, offering his services for honest employment on the mainland Wild Coast, whereupon, after full deliberation and in consideration of his being well versed in the art of fortification, of war, and of surveying, and also in cyphering and book-keeping,\n\nIt was resolved that he shall be employed as Commissary in charge of the stores at the aforesaid place; also as Commander of the twenty-five soldiers to be sent; moreover as engineer, to apportion the lands, make the maps, and erect certain strong places or forts for the protection of the Colony; and that he shall be assigned a salary of 60 florins per month, notification whereof was sent to him by letter, and by him so agreed to.\n\n103. PROCEEDINGS OF THE COMMITTEE GOVERNING FOR THE THREE WALCHEREN CITIES THE COLONY OF NOVA ZEELANDIA\n\n[February-August 1658]\n\nJanuary 24, 1658.\n\nThere were read the drafted instructions for Aert Adriaensen, as Director, and Cornelis Goliat, as Commissary on the mainland Wild Coast.\n\nFebruary 18, 1658.\n\nThe Committee of Crews reports that on the 2nd day of this current month of February the ship \",Joannes\" set sail from Flushing to Nova Zeelandia, and that all on board had been mustered and the passports registered.\n\nAugust 19, 1658.\n\nThere was read a letter from Aerts Adriaensen and Cornelis Goliat, dated from Nova Zeelandia on the 18th June, 1658, which is now provisionally placed with the other documents until the next meeting.\n\nThere was read a short description by Cornelis Goliat of the Rivers Demerara, Essequibo, Pomeroon, and Moruca, situated on the coast of Guiana, otherwise called the Wild Coast, and now Nova Zeelandia, which it was resolved to have copied and transmitted to each member of the Committee.\n\n104. PROCEEDINGS OF THE WEST INDIA COMPANY (ZEELAND CHAMBER)\n\n[5 September 1658]\n\nIt was put to the vote whether it would not be expedient to offer for hire to the Commit-tee of the Wild Coast our ship, \"Prins Willem\" in order to carry folk over to Essequibo, and at the same time to come home with folk from the islands, bringing along the annatto dye, letter-wood, and whatever else might have been acquired by trade.\n\n105. PROCEEDINGS OF THE WEST INDIA COMPANY (ZEELAND CHAMBER)\n\n[23 September 1658]\n\nThere was read a letter from Mr. Jacob de Hase, from the Hague, under date of the 17th instant, from which it was learned that certain private individuals had addressed themselves to the Amsterdam Chamber, asking to erect a Colony on the mainland Wild Coast without authority or commission from this Chamber.\n\nAfter discussion and long deliberation thereupon, it was decided and resolved to instruct the Deputies going to the Hague to bring forward there and maintain on behalf of this Chamber that the mainland Wild Coast was given to this Chamber as its share, just as Curacao, Cape Verde, &c., to that of Amsterdam, and that therefore, and also in imitation of the example of that of Amsterdam, all private persons who should be minded to establish any Colonies on the mainland Wild Coast would have to apply for their commissions to this Chamber, and to make an agreement with it thereupon. Yet, in order that all this may be maintained with good grounds and solid reasons, the Deputies going to the Hague were requested and instructed to look up and examine all the Minutes and documents both those of the Board of Nineteen and of this Chamber here, dealing with this matter, and before their departure to submit a Report to this Chamber, in order to receive thereupon yet more peremptory instructions.\n\n106.

MINUTES OF THE WEST INDIA COMPANY\n\n[4 November 1658]\n\nRead, a letter from the Amsterdam Chamber, under date of the 24th October, being the answer to ours sent on the 18th October, concerning. . ., thirdly, our claim to authority over the entire Wild Coast. . .\n\nOn the third point they say that, they cannot conceive what grounds we can have for ar-rogating to ourselves the whole Wild Coast, it being from one to ten degrees more than 200 [Dutch] miles; and that, though it cannot possibly, as they deem, be colonized by our Chamber alone, we yet claim to do it. . .\n\nIn reply to which [letter of the Amsterdam Chamber] it was resolved as follows: . . . as to the third [point], concerning the Wild Coast, it was resolved that there be drawn up by Mr. Mortamer an explanatory letter to the Amsterdam Chamber, wherein our right to that coast shall be set forth to them.\n\n108. MINUTES OF THE WEST INDIA COMPANY\n\n[2 January 1659]\n\nThere was read a letter from the Commander Aert Adriaansz. Groenwegen and the Commissary Goliat, dated from New Middelburg, the 15th September, 1658, whereby they re-quest that he Commissary be instructed to report concerning the rivers there, and the condition of Nova Zeelandia.\n\n(Original: Dutch)\n\n109. REPORT ON THE COLONY OF POMEROON\n\n[1 October 1661]\n\nHigh and Mighty Lords the States-General of the United Netherlands:\n\nThe Directors of the Zeeland Chamber of the Chartered West India Company most humbly make known that in the year 1657 they entered into a certain contract with the Commis-sioners at the towns of Middelburg, Flushing, and Veere for the furtherance of trade, coloniza-tion, and cultivation upon a certain portion of the mainland Wild Coast situated in America within the limits of their Charter, all by virtue of and in conformity with the liberties and exemp-tions granted by the Assembly of Nineteen, and approved by your High Mightinesses, in which matter and circumstances such progress has been made that a great portion of the aforesaid land there has been occupied and taken possession of both upon the Rivers Demerary and upon the Boumorome, and that, indeed, divers plantations and a fair number of Dutchmen have already been made and established, so that in time a good success is to be expected with regard to the aforesaid aim, and whereas the chief place, named Nieuw Middelburg, lying in the district called by us Nova Zeelandia, has for the present need of nought else than a qualified head or Com-mander for the direction of good policy, the administration of justice, and the command of the militia, they (the petitioners) have therefore chosen for that purpose a certain Francois de Fyn, experienced in those countries, and having faithfully served as Captain both in Brazil and An-gola, from whose engagement they entertain good hopes, and the same requiring for that purpose a proper commission from the State, they very dutifully beg that your High Mightinesses may be pleased to grant them a State commission in forma for the said Francois de Fyn.\n\nWhich doing, &c.\n\nSubmitted 1st October, 1661.\n\n110. DON PEDRO DE VIEDMA TO THE KING OF SPAIN\n\n[20 March 1662]\n\nSire,\n\nIn five duplicates I have given your Majesty an account of the miserable state of this Government, and how harassed it is by the foreign nations, Dutch and English, which are settled on this coast of Terra Firma in different places and sites which they have chosen for their greater convenience, the nearest called Vauruma (Pomeroon) and Moruga, being distant from this River Orinoco 25 leagues. Of this I have already informed your Majesty, and of the people in this first-named settlement, to the number of 600 men, between Dutch and Indians, and 1,000 negroes. And today, from the inquiries I have made, I find the number to be more than 1,000 men, with 400 Indians and a greater number of negroes, founding a new Brazil. These are protected by the forces of Esquivo and Berbis, whose Governor is Adrian Arnoto, a Dutchman.\n\nAnd, in like manner, I find there are on the said coast thirty-six settlements, with a great number of English, which extend a distance of 200 leagues to windward in different places with a great number of negroes.\n\nThese are composed of companies, and many of them with permission of the States of Holland, and from the way they divide these lands, they appear to be theirs. To this is to be added the Windward Islands that are settled by these nations, who with their traffic and trade infest these coasts every day causing this poor Government a thousand difficulties and misfortunes, being kept the whole year under arms, and leaving their families and farms without being able to assist them.\n\nAnd although the Dutch of Esquivo and Berbis have Treaties of Peace or truces with your Loyal Crown, they neither keep nor observe them as they should. Indeed, quite the contrary, for they have arrived in schooners in the Island of Trinidad, and by fraud they have frequently carried off a number of natives commissioned to be sold in the Windward Islands, as happened this present year in the month of January. So that, matters being thus, Sir, I have already conquered the Island of Trinidad, and pacified the natives under many difficulties, reducing some by kindness and the rebellious by force of arms, which none of my predecessors has been able to accomplish.\n\nI do not, on this occasion, transmit the proofs thereof, as I am absent from the said island in this city of Guayana.\n\nThese foreign nations hold at their disposal all the Indian natives of these Windward coasts so that they cause me the greater anxieties in fearing a [complete] ruin, for this Govern-ment has such a very small number of people that in this city and the Island of Trinidad they do not reach 140 residents, between old and young, and 100 capable of bearing arms.\n\nThe greatest misfortune is not to be able to fulfil my obligation as a loyal subject of your Royal Majesty. What I shall do will be to die in the discharge thereof as my obligation demands.\n\nSir, this Government is the least thing, the greatest is the injury that must be caused to your Majesty's Royal arms if these foreigners should take possession of this River Orinoco, for, in being masters thereof, they will also be masters of the New Kingdom of Granada, of Barinas, of the Province of Venezuela, and of that of Cuman√°, for by land they can make their expeditions without encountering any one to trouble them. And above all, that in a country where for so much time your Majesty has laboured at great expense in sowing the Holy Gospel, or at least the bad seed of the 'heretics should creep in, that they should leave such a multitude of nations of the natives to live in their barbarous customs, a great unhappiness with which I am burdened, and as to what may result therefrom I represent to your Majesty what is herein contained, as your humble servant and subject, with zeal and thought only for your Majesty's service, in order that you may be pleased to command the same to be examined, and to resolve upon the best course, and if it should be that of the permanency of these two places to provide a remedy therein before they are totally lost, for concerning the impossibility of being able to defend them, I have already on many occasions represented to your Majesty, as I now do, and thus your Majesty may regard this with your customary merciful consideration by affording help in men, munitions, fire-arms, and the necessary supplies.\n\nI also profit, by the occasion to give your Majesty an account how in August of the past year, 1660, I was informed by a despatch from Sergeant-Major Lucas Brabo de Leon and Don Geronimo de Vibero, the Ordinary Alcaldes (for on the death of Sergeant-Major Pedro de Padilla, who at the time was the one in office whilst the said Lucas Brabo was the Ordinary Al-calde, I granted the latter the said title of Sergeant-Major), who at the time were governing this city of Santo Thomas de Guayana in my absence, in which they report to me to the Island of Trinidad, distant by sea from this city more than 100 leagues, how there had arrived at this port in the River Orinoco a ship, captain and owner John Hooft, of the Dutch nation, representing that he was in want of stores. When I saw this I sent express orders by the same vessel which the Or-dinary Alcaldes sent me, that they should not admit nor allow the said ship in the said city and its port, nor trade with the crew in any way whatever, under pain of death, and [being declared] traitors to your Royal Majesty. And concerning the orders I transmitted, there again rose new troubles in this said city, as well on the part of the residents as on that of the soldiers, in that by forming public meetings at the request of the Procurator-General they agreed in their Junta that it would be well that the said ship should be received, thus setting aside my orders which had al-ready been given upon the case, and making for this purpose a new dispatch to the Island of Trinidad, appointing another Procurator, as they did in the said open meeting; both the residents and soldiers, in whose name he presented himself before my Tribunal in the said Island of Trini-dad, stating that this city entreated me to set aside the before-mentioned orders on account of their all being so poor, and it being more than thirty years since a ship fran Spain had entered that port, so that they had not wherewith to clothe themselves, nor any knives, hatchets, cutlasses, and other necessary articles of barter for the use of their tillage, and to give the Indians, who for want thereof render them but indifferent service, so that they suffer great necessities, and that if this were not done they requested permission to go and serve your Majesty in some other part.\n\nNotwithstanding, in fulfilment of your .Majesty's orders, I did not admit these allega-tions, but issuing a new Decree, I commanded that the said ship should not be admitted, but that your Majesty's orders should be duly observed, offering to remedy part of their necessities with my own salary, and telling them I would send Don Juan Pacheco, a resident merchant of the Is-land of Trinidad, who happened at the time to have some merchandise from Castile.\n\nThis was not accepted by the said Procurator, as is all proved by the acts which I have decreed in this matter, and with these orders the aforesaid Procurator was dispatched for this city.\n\nAnd not having received any news more than three mouths, I endeavoured to pacify, and make an expedition to the native Indians of that Island of Trinidad, who were in rebellion, and did not wish to serve the Spaniards. I carried it out with the few Spaniards of that island and some friendly Indians, and while receiving those, who, warned by the punishment I inflicted on the bad ones who were in my power, came and submitted peacefully, and promised to give ser-vice to the Spaniards, and compelling them for their subjection and instruction to settle on the outskirts of the town, and those part which appeared most convenient, in the month of April of the past year 1661, I learned from a passing traveller who went from this city to the Island of Trinidad, that my orders had not been complied with. This obliged me to come in person to this city of Guayana where on my arrival I began punishing the disobedient. I therefore seized the said ship as well as the merchandise on board. By judicial process and inventories, I condemned her, adjudicating all to your royal Majesty, which I carried out, and she was sold by public sale. Owing to the great volume of these \"autos,\" and the hurry of this journey, I have not been able to draw them up, but will transmit them on another occasion.\n\nThese goods, Sir, were sold to Marcos Madronero, a resident of the city of San Miguel del Castello; and on account of' there not being, as there really are not, any rich sureties in this city for the amount, he gave as sure Captain Miguel de Ochagania, a resident of the city of Bari-nas, a rich man, furthermore leaving the said merchandise hypothecated and intact, and deposited with two persons of this city of Guayana, where they are at present in the same form, with my authority and that of your Royal officer, granting a term of five months for the purpose of bringing the money to which the said sale amounted.\n\nIt happened that while I was in the Island of Trinidad recovering from a grave attack of fever which I had contracted in this city of Guayana that I was obliged to leave it. Whilst some vessels from this said city were going to that of Barinas by the river, the Carib Indians of the Caura, servants appropriated to residents of this city, Guaiqueries, Mapoies, and other nations, revolted in general, killed all the people that were among them, more than thirty persons, includ-ing residents of the city and strangers. The cause of this rebellion and havoc was the incitement which the Dutch of these new settlements have produced, through the secret communication they hold with them. I having had information of what happened in the Island of Trinidad, came to this city, where I am taking the necessary measures for the punishment of these Indians. For which object I have sent to request help in men from the Governors of Venezuela, Cuman√° and Barinas, besides what I brought from the Island of Trinidad, in order not to leave this place with-out men at a time when so many enemies surround me, both Indians of numerous tribes, and the Dutch who incite them, without having any other friends than the Indians of the village of San Pedro.\n\nFrom this your Majesty may gather the miserable state of this Government, so that being pleased to regard it with the eyes of your accustomed clemency, you may command the remedy to be applied which necessity demands, and the resolution to be taken which may be most advan-tageous to your Royal service in what regards the preservation of this Government. For, from what I see, it is, otherwise, an impossibility that this city can last in the midst of so many difficul-ties which combat and threaten it, and it is in such a state that those who live in it are compelled to do so, because I do not grant them the licences they desire, and today more so by the rising of these Indians, who, after all, served them somewhat, though badly, for there is no one to make them bread, bring them a pail of water, and cultivate their plantations. It must necessarily be abandoned, if some remedy does not come to them within a year, for they are in despair of it. For, although I may deny them the permission, they will fly to some other part, where, at least, they may have something to eat, and they will leave me alone, as it cannot be prevented.\n\nI encourage them, so that it may not be entirely abandoned, solely in the hope I promise myself of a remedy suitable to the powerful and Royal hand of your Majesty, whose Catholic and Royal person may God preserve, as Christendom and we your subjects need.\n\nPEDRO DE VIEDMA\n\n(Seal)\n\nGuayana, March 20, 1662\n\n(Archivo General de Indias, Seville)\n\n111. REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF WAR TO THE KING RESPECTING THE STATE OF GUAYANA\n\n[10 May 1662]\n\nThe President of the Council. Don Antonio Iasasi. Don Pedro de Aragon. The Baron de Ansi. The Marquis de Trocifal. Don Matheo de Villamarin. Don Pedro de Barreda. Don Alonso Ramirez. The Marquis de Montealegre.\n\nSire,\n\nOn the 18th January of the past year, 1657, the Junta made a \"Consulta\" to your Majesty concealing the fortifications, aid, missionaries, and other matters touching the Provinces of Trinidad and Guayana, on the receipt of a command, which your Majesty was pleased to transmit on the 6th October of the preceding year, together with some letters which the Bishop-Inquisitor had received: one from Christopher de Vera, Governor of the city of Santo Thom√© de la Guayana; another from the municipality thereof; and another from Dionisius Mesland, a French subject, a Father of the Society of Jesus, and missionary, who described himself as being of the congregation \"de propaganda fide.\" And in view of it, the Junta was of opinion that the Govern-ment of those provinces, which belongs to the district of the Audiencia of Santo Domingo, should be united to that of the New Kingdom [of Granada], on account of the facility with which it could be helped from there, and also owing to its being at a distance of 800 leagues from Santo Domingo by sea, and of very difficult navigation, seeing that the Island of Trinidad is to windward of that island, as may be seen on the maps, and full of dangers owing to the many settlements of English and French existing in the Windward Islands. And that if the enemy should take possession of that Government, so as to make himself with greater facility master of the River Orinoco, which is close to Santo Thom√© de la Guayana, and that if he should attempt this, it would be nearly im-possible to hinder him by means of any help sent from the Island Hispaniola, and that there was no information to show that it had ever received on any occasion any help therefrom. And there-fore on this account, as also because the Province of Guayana is bordered on the rear by the terri-tory of the New Kingdom, and that the Island of Trinidad, which is the head of that Government, is very near Guayana, and that on the occasions when it has been invaded by the enemy the President of Santa F√© has rendered it help in people and armaments, and that he can do so more promptly and easily than the President of Santo Domingo, on account of being so much nearer, and it being a country extruding continuously to the New Kingdom. For all these reasons the Junta considered it well that the Provinces of Trinidad and Guayana should he annexed to that kingdom in all matters that might relate to the administration of justice, revenue, and military and political government, by your Majesty so declaring it, and advising the Presidents of Santo Domingo and the New Kingdom, in order that the latter should look after its defence and preservation, on account of the immense difficulty there would be in rendering it help from these kingdoms, and it not being possible to do so from Santo Domingo.\n\nAnd the Junta did not then proceed to treat of the fortifications of the city of Santo Thom√© de la Guayana and Island of Trinidad until such time as the Report was received that had to be made by the Governor whom your Majesty then appointed; but suggested as desirable that the said Governor should take with him a certain quantity of arms and munitions, and your Maj-esty was pleased to reply to this \"Consulta\" in the following manner:\n\n\"Although the reports and papers that have arrived, and have been examined in the Junta, point out how desirable it is to separate the Government of the Island of Trinidad from the Audiencia of Santo Domingo and unite it to that of Santa F√©, it does not appear from the account that was sent me that the Audiencias of Santo Domingo and Santa F√© have recently reported upon the inconveniences or conveniences of changing the form which up to now has existed in that Government, nor whether any search has been made to see if any papers exist as to what is said, that in the year 1615 it happened that a Governor was appointed to this island and that of Guayana. And as, in the demarcation that was made when the Governments were indicated that were to belong to each Audiencia, it was necessary to consider what is now said concerning the distance between the Island of Trinidad and that of Santo Domingo, and nevertheless it was placed under its government, and has thus continued for so many years. And the Junta does not find this inconvenience in matters which relate to spiritual affairs, for it is said that the Government thereof in that respect, may be given to the Bishop of Puerto Rico.\n\n\"I suspend the taking of a resolution on this point until I am informed whether there are reports from the Audiencias, Bishop, and Royal officers, which are those that usually precede whenever such separations are treated of, and if they have been seen with the rest of the papers referred to here, so that with the information thereof I may command what may be suitable.\n\n\"I have also been notified that without any greater inquiry they (that is, the members of the Junta) have passed over what is said in regard to the passage to that part of Dionisius Miland, with privileges (as it is said) granted by his Holiness and the Universal Inquisition of Rome, this being one of the things of which they have tried hardest to prevent the introduction; and they have tried to give opportunity for any Father to enter the country with such letters of permission for the teaching and instruction of the Indians, and therefore examining the precedents that in cases of this nature have taken place, and the commands that may have been issued concerning it the Council will again examine this point, and report to me their opinion.\n\n\"And in what refers to the munitions, it shall be done as suggested. And in regard to the rest proposed to me, when I have received the Report on the points which I am now considering, I will give a resolution.\"\n\nAll is more particularly contained in the Consulta sent in reply, of which the original is placed here within your Majesty's Royal hands, together with the Report that was then made by a Secretary (and it was sent with the same Consulta on the state of the Provinces of Trinidad and Guayana).\n\n[And] now Don Juan de Ibarreta, Knight of the Order of Alcantara, and Treasurer of the Island of Margarita, by virtue of the power which he holds from the city of Guayana, has pre-sented a Memorial in the Junta, with sundry testimonies and letters, as well from the Governor of the Island of Trinidad as of that of the city of Santo Thom√© of the Most Blessed Sacrament of Guayana and of Trinidad, under dates of September and October of the year 1659.\n\nAnd what the Governor, Pedro de Viedma, states in his letter of the 20th October of the same year, reduces itself to announcing his arrival in that Government in August 1658, and hav-ing taken possession thereof; and that he found it divided into two jurisdictions, for that of the Island of Trinidad was governed provisionally by Matheo Sotelo de Quiros, by appointment from the' Audiencia of Santo Domingo; and that of Santo Thom√© de la Guayana and its provinces by Maestro de Campo, Christoval de Vera, appointed by the Audiencia of Santa F√©; and that this proceeded from assigning the Island of Trinidad to the Government of Santo Domingo, and that of Santa Thom√© to the New Kingdom.\n\nIn like manner he reports having found that Government in the necessity of being forti-fied, and the forts strengthened.\n\nHe refers to the small number of people residing in the Island of Trinidad, which does not exceed sixty-six men, old and sick together, and that of these not more than forty, between Spaniards, half-breeds and mulattoes, can serve for the defence of the country, and many of them without arms, and that there were only eighty or ninety Indians, and other natives withdrawn to freedom.\n\nThat in the city of Santa Thom√© there was a French Father of the Society of Jesus, occu-pied in the instruction of the Indians, for whom his predecessor, Don Martin de Mendoza, sent, having learned that he had a settlement, with a companion and some other Frenchmen, in the River Guarapiche, which is on the coast of Terra Firma between Guayana and Cuman√°; and he came with four other Frenchmen (which caused some uneasiness among the residents); and their declarations having been taken they were sent to the Audiencia of Santa F√©, from which resulted that the President thereof sent a force of eighty infantry soldiers to Don Martin de Mendoza, for the defence of his Government; and when they arrived he was already dead, and they were delivered to his lieutenant. And as there was no help given to these men they fled and abandoned the place, for the said Governor did not find there more than sixteen men on his arrival in that province, and the French Father instructing the natives (for want of priests), who requested permission to go to the Dutch or English nation, which was refused, and he remarks that if he pressed the matter more he would send him to the New Kingdom.\n\nIn like manner he says that he had sent a person to reconnoitre the settlements and towns which the foreigners have there, who found that on the coast of Terra Firma (jurisdiction of his Government 20 leagues to windward of the River Orinoco), there are two settlements: one of 150 Dutch, and another of 280, and to these are added 200 wealthy Indians, of those expelled from Brazil, and that in both towns they have introduced 1,500 negro slaves for their plantations. And that besides these, there is the fort of Esquivo, which has been founded more than thirty years, and is distant 12 leagues from the new settlements. There is a Governor there, and the fort has a battery of twelve pieces of artillery, and soldiers; and that the person who was sent to reconnoitre was told by the Dutch that they were expecting more people for the purpose of completing the settlement of those rivers, and two ship loads of negroes. And that on his return journey he had encountered a small vessel with two men, who spoke to him in Spanish, and they appeared to be of the conservancy of the Indians of the said settlements; and one born in Madrid gave him to understand that he had been an Augustinian Priest, and had gone to Amsterdam in company with an Indian woman, where he allowed himself to be circumcised, and on that account he was sent to the Inquisition of Carthagena.\n\nBesides the settlements above referred to, the English continue to found others on the coast of Terra Firma with more than 1,500 men, and many negroes, and sugar plantations.\n\nAnd he represented the inconveniences of those settlements, and the importance of those fortified places, on account of being contiguous to his Government, and to the New Kingdom of Granada, Merida and Barinas, which communicate with the River Orinoco, and by land with the Government of Venezuela and Cuman√°, and the rest of those ports.\n\nThe cities of Santo Thom√© of the Most Blessed Sacrament of Guayana, and that of Trinidad in letters addressed to your Majesty stated the same points as those mentioned by the Governor, particularly that of the settlements of foreigners, and that both for this reason and on account of the residents being few, they are exposed to an invasion.\n\nIn consideration of what the Governor and the cities represent in the letters referred to, the said Don Juan de Ibarreta requests your Majesty be pleased to help those residents with men, arms, and munitions, which may be conveyed there, without any considerable expense to the Royal Treasury, in the register ship, requested by the Province of Cuman√°, or in that in which the munitions will be sent for that fortress and its fort of Araya, which in its name and as its Procura-tor he has petitioned for. For the said vessel has to pass by the said Island of Trinidad, and it can call there, for the purpose of consoling and helping those poor residents, who on account of their extreme poverty have not been visited for many years by any ship from these kingdoms, even one touching there so that they might provide themselves with clothing.\n\nAnd let the President of the New Kingdom be commanded to correspond with the said Governor and help him with the necessary assistance, in view of what may result from the set-tlements which the enemy have in the Island of Tobago, distant 10 leagues from that of Trinidad, and the new settlement they are founding on Terra Firma, 20 leagues on the east side of the said Guayana, [that] which runs for more than 100 leagues of coast that they occupy, in which there are more then 600 English and French, with more than 1,500 negro slaves, and they have very great numbers of the Indian natives of that country subject to them, on account of the merchan-dise they give them in barter. For the said assistance accrues to the defence of the New Kingdom and of the Province of Barinas, to which parts the enemy have an entrance through the mouths of the River Orinoco if they become masters of the said coast. And here he refers to what the Gov-ernor writes, and entreats that orders may be given to observe the Cedula of the 27th October, 1627, which prohibits that Governors be sent provisionally to the said province, through the death of the proprietaries, but let it be governed by the Chief Alcaldes until a successor be sent. Because in not observing it irreparable injuries follow therefrom to those residents, as that Gov-ernment is divided in its jurisdiction between two Audiencias: the part of Trinidad to that of Santo Domingo, and that of Guayana to Santa F√©, as already stated, so that when vacancies occur each President sends a Provisional Governor, from which result the inconvenience that may be supposed from having two Heads in a Government, subject to different Tribunals, and the ex-pense of another Governor's salary is added to the Royal Treasury, because each of them draws the full salary of 1,500 ducats. And on that account, and the inconveniences which result from the fact of one Government being subject to two Audiencias, he entreats your Majesty that the said Island of Trinidad (which is only 12 leagues distant from Guayana) be united the Audiencia of Santa F√©. For today with the proximity of the new settlements the Governor necessarily re-quires to join hands with the President of his district. And the President of Santo Domingo, be-sides being very far away beyond the sea, and always requiring the use of ships, cannot render him any assistance whatever, even if no such inconveniences intervened. Because Santo Do-mingo is a port and fortified place which needs for itself all that come there, and may be sent to it. And therefore it will be a great service to your Majesty that this union be made in all respects to the Audiencia of Santa F√©, which is nearer, and possesses access by land.\n\nEverything having been examined in the Junta with the attention and care proper to an affair of so much importance, and considering what your Majesty was pleased to reply to the Consulta of the 18th January, 1657 (the reply to which is inserted above), and having in like manner studied the papers and representations which since then have come to the Junta, and all others that have been brought together relating to this affair, they have considered it as their im-perative obligation to again represent to your Majesty that they deem it for the greatest advantage that that Government in what relates to temporal affairs be united to that of the Audiencia of Santa F√© and its President (for in what relates to spiritual matters the Council State to your Majesty what they consider advisable in the Consulta of this date, since it is a point which belongs to it), in view of the inconveniences which are considered to arise from that province not being able to be assisted and helped by that of Santo Domingo (to which Government it is at present united), not only on account of the dangers of the navigation and great distance, but also owing to the small means the Island of Santo Domingo has for the purpose. And, on the contrary, from Santa F√©, where the facilities are altogether greater, the necessary assistance can be rendered to Guayana and the other villages of its jurisdiction quickly and substantially. And at the same time, the end may be attained that there may be only one Provisional Governor, and not two as heretofore, causing thereby so many disputes and inconveniences as are set forth in the papers of which a report has been made.\n\nAnd that Don Diego de Egues, actual President of Santa F√©, be granted very ample power to assist those residents. And that if he could go in person to visit the island, let him do so, and if not, let him apply whatever means he may consider necessary for its greater assistance. And that with this object he should examine what men, arms, and munitions may be necessary for maintaining some towns in a state of defence, and raise and forward the same, as also the arms and munitions; and let him insure the help and assistance of the people, whilst endeavouring in all to spare the Royal Treasury as much as possible.\n\nAnd to maintain this force and encourage the rest that there might be in the towns of that Government, the Junta consider it well that the tributes which may have been imposed in that province may be stopped and remitted, for besides what is aforesaid, this advantage will attract attention, so that those towns may increase by more people coming to inhabit them.\n\nIn like manner the Junta consider it advisable that permission be accorded to a ship, of such tonnage as the Casa de la Contratacion may think fit, to carry for the time that shall be nec-essary the products which that province requires, together with some licence for negroes, so that the necessities and misery from which those residents now suffer may be alleviated, upon which subject a Report shall be requested from the Casa, should your Majesty be pleased to agree to the same.\n\nFurther, they consider it desirable that Don Diego de Egues be instructed, in case he should go himself to Guayana to take with him the Lieutenant of the Chief Engineer of Cartha-gena, Don Juan Betin, and that if he should not go, he should send him with the person whom he shall commission in his own place, provided he shall be of the necessary qualification and ex-perience, for the purpose of surveying the territory of the Island of Trinidad and Guayana, and drawing up a map thereof, and of the fortifications he shall consider necessary and suitable, hav-ing regard to the men and means available for defending it, and to transmit a particular Report of all to the Council with the said map.\n\nThey are also of opinion that orders should be given to Don Diego de Egues, so that he may be able to have at hand the Father of the Society [of Jesus] who went to Trinidad and Guayana, and that the bulls and documents he may have brought be taken from him, and all be forwarded to these Kingdoms with the necessary safeguard, and in like manner the other circum-cised Augustinian Father, of whom an account has been given in this Consulta.\n\nYour Majesty will command in all whatever may be your Royal pleasure.\n\n(There are five seals of the members of the Junta.)\n\nMadrid, May 10, 1662.\n\n*\n\nDOCKET\n\nCouncil of War of the Indies.

RENEWAL OF THE CHARTER OF THE YEAR 1621 GRANTED TO THE DIRECTORS OF THE WEST INDIA COMPANY, IN THE MATTER OF NEW NETHERLAND\n\n[23 January, 1664]\n\nThe States-General of the United Netherlands:\n\nTo all who shall see or hear these presents read, Greeting:\n\nKnow ye that whereas we, in the year 1621, for many and weighty reasons, did decide to establish and form in our province a Company, named the West India Company, in order that by it alone, and with the exclusion of all others, may be carried on the navigation and trade with the coasts and lands of Africa from the Tropic of Cancer to the Cape of Good Hope; With the lands of America or West Indies, beginning at the south end of Newfoundland (and passing) through the Straits of Magellan and Le Maire or other passages and straits situated thereabout to the Straits of Anjan, as well in the North as South Sea; With the islands on the one and the other side, and situated between the two; Extending over the Australian or southern lands, and lying between the two meridians touching in the east the Cape of Good Hope and in the west the east end of New Guinea, inclusive, granting, by the second Article of the Charter of the 3rd June, 1621, under our Great Seal conferred upon them, further and expressly that it (the Company), in our name and authority, within the aforewritten limits, should have power to make contracts, en-gagements, and alliances with the Princes and natives of the lands therein included;\n\nLikewise there to build any fortresses and strongholds, to appoint, transfer, and dismiss Governors, military men, and Officers of Justice, and others necessary for the preservation of the places, support of good order, administration, and justice, as well as for the development of trade, and to substitute others again in their places as they shall find to be required according to the circumstances, and specially that it (the Company) should have power to develop the popula-tion of fruitful and uninhabited quarters.\n\nAnd the aforewritten Company, by virtue of the aforewritten Charter, in conformity with our sincere intention, have from the commencement continued their populating and bepeopling on the coast of America, in the country named New Netherland; and this, notwithstanding that some persons evilly disposed towards our State and to the aforewritten Company, try to misstate our sincere and good meaning contained in the aforewritten Charter, alleging forsooth that we had chartered the aforewritten Company only to carry on business within the aforesaid limits, and not to make population and settlements of people, and the lands in possession to take, disputing with the aforewritten Company their rights in these respects.\n\nNow, therefore, we, being hereby desirous of assuring all and sundry whom it may in any way concern, of our intention in the aforewritten Charter, do declare our meaning to have been expressly, and still to be, that the aforementioned Company, in conformity with the afore-written Charter, was empowered, and still is empowered, to establish Colonies and settlements of people on lands which are not occupied by others, to extend themselves so far as the limits here-inbefore related, and especially since the same is necessary for preservation of the right which is due to them, by virtue of the aforewritten Charter, by discovery and occupation on the fresh river, and other places situated more easterly in New Netherland, up to Cape Cod, and from Cape Hinloopen, and 15 miles southerly, both along the coast, provisionally, and pending further agreement, respecting the limits to be made between the King of Great Britain anal ourselves, as, moreover, by virtue of the Charter granted, their limits, in conformity with the provisional de-limitation fixed in America between the Governments of both sides in the year 1650, and ap-proved and ratified by us the 22nd February, 1656, shall he fixed on the east side of New Netherland as follows, to wit: -\n\nAt the continent on the west side of Grenwits (Greenwich) Bay, being about 4 miles from Stanfort, and thus running inland on a northerly line, 20 miles, saving that it shall not come upon 10 miles near to the North River, and further on Long Island off from the western part of the Oyster Bay, also in a direct line due south as far as to the sea.\n\nProvisionally and in conformity with the foregoing the eastern portion of the aforesaid island remaining for the English, and the western for the previously-intentioned West India Company and the inhabitants of the Netherlands.\n\nWherefore we request all Emperors, Kings, Republics, Princes, and Potentates, friends and allies of this country, or preserving neutrality therewith, to allow the said West India Com-pany to enjoy and possess peaceably and quietly the aforewritten limits, which we shall very willingly reciprocate to them as opportunity occurs.\n\nWe further order and decree expressly and rigorously all and each individual belonging to and living in our service and under our dominion, and especially the inhabitants within the limits aforesaid, to govern themselves according to the purport of this our deed punctually and strictly without making opposition to the contrary, under pain of incurring our high indignation and disfavour, and in consequence thereof of being punished as contumacious to our orders, as may be found to be proper according to the requirements of the case.\n\nGiven under our Great Seal, flourish, and the signature of our Secretary on the 23rd January, 1664.\n\n114. PETITION OF JAN DOENSON AND OTHERS FOR THE REGISTRY OF THEIR PROPERTY, PREPARATORY TO THE ERECTION OF A SUGAR-MILL IN ESSEQUIBO\n\n[3 July 1664]\n\nTo the Directors of the Zeeland Chamber of the Chartered West India Company.\n\nJan Doensen, skipper, of the ship \"Zeelandia,\" respectfully makes known that by virtue of, and in accordance with, the liberties and exemptions offered and granted to all the world, he, with several qualified associates, has chosen and taken possession of a piece of land and region situated in the River Essequibo at Brouwershoek, upon which he has placed an agent one Hui-brecht Vinon, a Frenchman provided with several negroes and other agricultural implements for the establishment of a regular sugar-mill there, and of the further plantation needed therefor; and being desirous to go on therewith, and, with God's help, to carry everything into operation, ac-cording to the intention and to the advantage of the Company, to which end the aforesaid liber-ties and exemptions were granted, it will be impossible to bring about without still further very expense for animals, copper utensils, and other thing needed thereto; and it being only just that for their zeal, labour, trouble, and great expense, they for all time should peacefully enjoy an ab-solute and free ownership for themselves and their descendants, always, however, under the pro-tection and the regulations of the Company; and inasmuch as there in that country they have or can find no opportunity for having the ownership of their aforesaid plantation recorded and registered; therefore he (the petitioner) hereby requests in writing that he and his associates, as owners, be thus entered here at home in the books and made known as such, at least, provisionally, until further registration yonder shall have been ordered, and also an explicit statement of year and day when Your Honours mean the liberty granted the petitioners to take its beginning, in order that they may regulate themselves accordingly, and thereafter pay to the Company their proper dues and other moneys.\n\nDone at Middelburg, July 3, 1664.\n\nJ. DOENS\n\n115. DECLARATION BY CLEMENTE GUNTER\n\n[18 March 1665]\n\n(Extract)\n\nAsked in what part the said settlement of Bauruma is situated, he said at 8 degrees or rather more, on a flat spot, 80 leagues distant from the chief mouth of the river called Amacuro, and that the said settlement will have 150 paid soldiers, and as many as 400 residents, and about 2,000 negro slaves; and its products are sugar.\n\nAsked what is the population of Essequibo, of the same nation, and how far distant it is from Bauruma, he said it is 10 or 12 leagues from it to windward, on the same mainland coast, and is governed by a Lieutenant, and that he did not know what number of residents it had, but knows that it has a fortress with a garrison of soldiers.\n\nAsked if he knows what the population and number of residents may be in that of the River Belbis [Berbice] and how far distant it is from that of Essequibo, he said that it appeared to him to be 40 leagues to windward from that of Essequibo, but that he does not know the number of residents and soldiers as he had not been there, but he knows that the said settlement belongs to his nation.\n\nAsked concerning the Island of Tavaco [Tobago], what nations occupy it, he said that Curlanders and Dutch have divided it into two parts, but that he does not know the number of people of either nation.\n\n116. DECLARATION OF PEDRO PEDRO BONOSTRE\n\n[19 March 1665]\n\nIn the city of Santo Thom√© del Santissimo Sacramento de Guayana, on the 19th day of the month of March, of the year 1665, his Honour Senor Don Joseph de Axpe y Cuniga, Gover-nor and Captain-General of this city and its province for His Majesty, and Judge in this cause, ordered to appear before him Pedro Pedro Bonostre, who said, he is thus called, and is a native of the Island of San Atasio, close to that of San Cristoval; and his Honour, having asked if he were an Apostolic Roman Catholic, he said yes; wherefore oath was taken from him in due form by means of Felipe Dros, a citizen of this city, who served as intepreter, and he took it and promised to tell the truth, and was interrogated as follows: -\n\nHe was asked by the said interpreter how long he has been with the said Captain Clemente Gunter, to which he replied that he has been with the aforesaid for nine months; and he was asked how the said time was occupied. He said in communicating with the natives in differ-ent ports, and that he bought from then two moderate-sized pirogues, and gave in payment mon-keys and hammocks and other products of the Indies and natives.\n\nHe was asked if he knows the whereabouts of the frigate of Jerman, a Hamburger by na-tion. He said that it is in aisle of the creeks of this River Orinoco, and that about ten days ago the said Captain Clemente went in a pirogue to the frigate of the said Captain Jerman, to ask him for a man to help in rowing.\n\nHe was asked what garrison of troops Baoruma may have. He said that as many as 400 paid men, with 300 residents and fourteen families of Indians, and that the negroes are many, but he does not know their number, and that what he has stated is the truth under obligation of his oath, and that he is twenty years of age, and did not sign because he did not know how to do so and his Honour the said Governor and Captain-General signed.\n\nDON JOSEPH DE AXPE Y CUNIGA.\n\nBefore me:\n\nDON JUAN DE NOBOA,\n\nNotary Public and of the Corporation.\n\n117. DECLARATION OF CLEMENTE GUNTER\n\n[7 March 1666]\n\nIn the city of Cartaxena, on the said day, 7th March, of the said year 1666, the Senor Maestre de Campo Don Benito de Figueroa y Barrantes, Knight of the Order of Alcantara, Gov-ernor and Captain-General of it and of its province, caused a man to appear before him, namely, the one whom the Lords of the Royal Audiencia of Santa F√© sent to him, and who is at present a prisoner in the Royal prison of this city; and having him in his presence, he interrogated and ex-amined him as follows:\n\nHe was asked what his name is, of what place he is a citizen and native, and if he is a Christian, and of what nation he is and what is his position and age. He said that he is called Clemente Gunter, and that he is an Apostolic Roman Christian; and when his Lordship perceived that he said he was an Apostolic Roman Christian, he took his oath in legal form, by God and a Cross, that he would tell the truth of what he might know and be asked; and having taken it fully, he declared, under the said oath, that, as he has stated, he is called Captain Clemente Gunter, and that he is of the German nation, a native of the city of Hamburg, a subject of the Prince of Orange, and that he is married to Maria Marnfelt, whom he has left at present in the city and port of Bauroma, where a brother of the declarant is Governor, and that he is about thirty-five years of age.\n\nAsked how long it is since he left his country, and whence he came, and when he entered these Indies, and for what purpose he came to them, he said that he started from the said city of Bauroma, where his said brother is Governor, by appointment of the said Prince of Orange, on the 3rd June of the year 1664, with advices for Pedro de Biedma, Governor of Guayana, to whom his said brother, who is called Francisco Delphin Gunter, wrote, informing him that the Eng-lishman was on the point of going to plunder that island; and as his said brother was acquainted with the said Pedro de Biedma, he sent him this message to warn him, telling him that if he needed munitions of war he would give them to him; and when he reached Guayana to give him this message, this declarant found the village plundered by the said Englishman and the people destitute: and the said Pedro de Biedma did not see him there then because he was in Trinidad; and the said residents begged him for the love of God to send to Bauroma to his brother, that he might send them a small quantity of clothing to cover them, as they were going quite bare, and the women naked; whereupon the declarant sent the vessel in which he had come, namely, a pirogue, to the said Governor, his brother, to ask him to send a consignment of clothing, serge and Dutch linens, to sell and distribute among those people, which was duly sent to him, and this declarant distributed among all those residents as much as from 4,000 to 6,000 pesos worth of goods, as will appear by the books and papers of the agreement which was taken from him by the present Governor of Guayana, Don Joseph de Aspid y Zuniga.. And he also gave then munitions of war such as powder and shot, and gave them credit for the said clothing for eight months. And then he went to Bauroma, and at the end of eight or ten months came back to col-lect the money for the said clothing, and the said Governor Pedro de Biedma, who was then there, told him to wait for two months until the people could get a small quantity of hides, and he did so, and at this time the said Governor, Don Joseph de Aspid y Zuniga, arrived, being newly-appointed, and put this declarant into prison, accusing him of having entered there with merchandise, and took from him the books and papers in which he had entered what he had sold, thinking that the said Governor Pedro de Biedma had admitted him with the said clothing, whereas he did not admit him because, as already stated, when the said clothing came he was in the city, and because he saw the people destitute and naked he was moved with compassion, and gave them his assistance; and also the said Governor, Don Joseph de Aspid, banished him, telling him in his sentence that he banished him from the River Orinoco, which is the River of Guayana by which vessels enter; and he sent him prisoner to Santa F√©, with one of his brothers named Don Tiburzio de Aspid. All of which appears in the account in a Memorial which he gave to Senor Don Matheo Ibanez de Ribera, who acts as President in the Royal Audiencia of Santa F√©.\n\n(Archivo General de Indias, Seville)\n\n118.

Scott himself did not join in the attack and slipped away alone in a boat on which he flew a flag of truce offering to surrender.\n\nThe examination of George Graham, steward to Captain Scott, was taken upon oath on the 4th day January, 1667. He said that Captain Scott on or about the 4th October, 1664 [1665?] upon landing near Fort Moruca, marched at the head of his troops until they came within gun-shot of the Fort, and then he deserted them, running into a house, and did not re-appear until Fort was captured. Notwithstanding this, he insisted he was the Commander of the expedition, and he organised eight small boats to patrol the coast to look for enemy boats. He sent out four of these boats and then he himself followed with four others. The first four met with eight enemy boats, and Scott, in the other four, sailed away and refused to go to their assistance.\n\nGEORGE GRAHAM.\n\n*\n\nWalter Forster, a soldier, under the command of Captain Scott, when he was on the mainland of South America on the expedition to attack the Dutch, having heard the above Depo-sition read unto him, declared under oath that the said deposition was true.\n\nThe Marks of W. F. (WALTER FOSTER).\n\n*\n\nThe examination of Capt. John Bell was taken under oath, on the same day. He said that Capt. Scott, during their landing near Fort Moruca, marched at the head of the troops, but when they came within gun-shot of the Fort, he cowardly deserted left them by running into a house and not re-appearing until the Fort was taken. Notwithstanding all this, he insisted he was the Chief Commander of the expedition.\n\nJOHN BELL.\n\n*\n\nIt is further stated that in Essequibo Major Scott surprised one group of men (of which the examined was one) who were responsible for keeping some provisions in a house. He abused the men, took away their arms, and gave them to the Dutchmen, who were originally his prison-ers. These men then became the prisoners of the Dutch.\n\nThe Marks of W. F.
