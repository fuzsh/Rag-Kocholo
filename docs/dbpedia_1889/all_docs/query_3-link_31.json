See help Use Mode\n\nBack to top Content | Map |\n\nUse Mode\n\nBefore selecting the mode of use:\n\n1) Select a point in the map, can set this centre by search on a given address and can drag the yellow bulb in the map to adjust where you want (for instance in your garden to later show sun or shadows directions).\n\nTo find in the map, the coordinates (latitude, longitude), read the guide How to use the tool map.\n\n2) Choose a date & time for your calculation.\n\n3) Choose your local time zone, caution: Mind to select the correct time (summer time vs winter) according to your chosen date.\n\n4) Click execute button. You can view several sun charts, according to the option modes you select.\n\nIf you want to save or change your favorites points go to the link (after the login) then you can select them directly from the map.\n\nSun path\n\nwill display a yellow croissant with 3 important circles; the inner most is the path of the sun on 21th Jun(longest day light duration of the year), while the outermost is the sun's path on 21th Dec(shortest day light duration of the year) in the north hemisphere, while they are invert in the south hemisphere, the mid circle is the sun's path on your chosen date.The outer blue circle as for centre your chosen location and show the angular coordinates around which the sun revolves. If you find the display sun chart too small or too big, simply zoom in or out and hit again EXECUTE, it will then re-generate a chart according to the new zoom factor.\n\nSun path + rays\n\nas its name suggest superimpose sun path + sun rays\n\nPoint\n\nby left clicking on the map appears a marker that contain the latitude, longitude and street address information, each click creates a new marker.\n\nDistance\n\nby left clicking on the map appears a marker and a line from the default marker to new marker, the next click remove the old marker and creates a new. On the top text field you can visualize the distance value between the two points, measured in Km, mile (mi) or for short distance meters (m), foot (ft).\n\nPolyline\n\nby left clicking on the map appears a marker and a segment from the previous marker to new marker, all marker are linked with segment from the default. On the top text field you can visualize the distance value from default to the last point, measured in Km, mile (mi) or for short distance meters (m), foot (ft). This is very useful to calculate the distance of a path of trekking, mountain bike, sport, free time ...\n\nArea\n\nMeasure the area enclosed in the polyline, the perimeter of the area and highlighted the direction of the last segment. Allows you to draw a rectangle or a polygonal area on the map\n\nSun rays\n\nView the map the height and direction of sun rays (hourly sun rays), the segments represent the normalized elevation (when change the zoom, hit again EXECUTE button to re-generate the segments according to the new zoom factor).\n\nShadow\n\nView on map the normalized shadow length (when change the zoom, hit again EXECUTE button to re-generate the segments according to the new zoom factor) and the direction of the shadow produced by an obstacle ( 180° opposite of sun rays), the formula is: shadow object lenght = object height/tan(sun elevation degree). Use this tool to calculate the lenght.\n\nUnits of measurement\n\nkm - kilometers, m - meters, mi - miles, ft - foot, nmi - nautical miles.\n\nBack to top Content | Map |\n\nMeasuring a bearing (direction) in a map\n\nA bearing is a measurement of direction between two points in the earth. There are two formats for the Bearings, an azimuth bearing or a quadrant bearing.\n\nAn azimuth bearing indicate direction in degree, north as 0°, east 90°, south 180°, and west 270° (the compass is numbered clockwise from 0° to 360°).\n\nFor quadrant bearings the compass is divided into four sections, each containing 90°. Quadrant bearings are given in the format of N 42°E (northeast), S 13°W (southwest), ...\n\nTo determine the bearing from two point (from point A to point B) in a map, is to carry a protractor with you when you’re in the field. If you have a protractor with you, place it on the map so it is oriented parallel to a north-south gridline, with the center of the protractor on point A (or on a line drawn between points A and B). Once you have done this, you can simply read the bearing you need to go off of the protractor.\n\nIf you have a computer connected to the internet you can use the tool of this web page, using the mode distance or polyline, save the point A where you want to measure the bearing (orientation), then with another click on the map appears a second marker, high in the field text value will be displayed the value, for example, | dir: 352.58° |.\n\nBack to top Content | Map |\n\nCalculate Distance Area and Perimeter in a Map\n\nDistance mode, polyline and aera, for each click on the map will show the total length of the segments joining the starting point to final, in addition is computed direction between the last two points of the polyline.\n\nMode area for each click adds a vertex and a polygon is drawn on the map at any time you can move the vertices by dragging the map, the value of the area is updated automatically.\n\nIn the top field displays the extent of the area highlighted, and the length of the perimeter of the polygon.\n\nThe calculation of a surface directly on an online map, is useful for a quick assessment of the available area for a photovoltaic system, and therefore the maximum power installed.\n\nValue of bering used to determine what the azimuth of a roof or ground to assess the performance of a photovoltaic or solar thermal.\n\nBack to top Content | Map |\n\nAccuracy map\n\nThe mathematical model used approximates the earth to a sphere with a radius of 6378137 meters, so the calculation of distance might have an error of 0.3%, particularly in the polar extremes, and for long distances through various parallel.\n\nThe spherical model also affects the calculation of the bearing or direction (the error increases with distance). If we take the extreme case, consider two diametrically opposite points on the equator the shortest path does not pass through the equator but to the pole, then the bearing will not be 90° or 270° (depending on the direction of travel) but 0° or 180°, for all other cases we will have intermediate values.\n\nIf the measure of direction was made a map a plane we will have the same problem.\n\nFor short distances the error becomes irrelevant.\n\nBack to top Content | Map |\n\nAccuracy\n\nLatitude and Longitude have the maximum error in the equator, because the earth' radius is maximum.\n\nThe Earth is not a sphere, but an irregular shape approximating an ellipsoid. The accuracy of the longitude increases the further from the equator you get. The accuracy of the latitude remains almost unchanged.\n\nThe earth's radius at the equator is: 6378.160 km than the circumference is: (2*π*r) 40075.1612 km, each degree is: (40075.1612/360) 111.319 km.\n\nPrecision choice is of 5 decimal place is accurate to 1.11 meter (+/- 55.5 cm) at the equator.\n\nplacesdecimal deg.degreesdistance 01.01°0’0\"111.319 km 10.10°6’0\"11.132 km 20.010°0’36\"1.113 km 30.0010°0’3.6\"111.3 m 40.00010°0’0.36\"11.13 m 50.000010°0’0.036\"1.11 m 60.0000010°0’0.0036\"11.1 cm 70.00000010°0’0.00036\"1.11 cm\n\nBack to top Content | Map |\n\nComment\n\nIf you detect a bug or other inaccuracy, want to suggest a new feature or simply want to express an opinion about the site, feel free to do in the \"Comment\" section that follows (or directly with an email).
