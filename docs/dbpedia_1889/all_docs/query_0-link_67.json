These hazards can cause loss of life, injury and various health problems, damage to property, social and economic disruption, or environmental degradation. The impacts of natural hazards on human health are of particular concern. From heat stroke to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including psychological and social impacts, the health impacts of natural hazards can be serious and depend on complex processes involving individual, social, economic, and environmental factors. Canada has seen many examples of severe impacts from these hazards on the health and safety of the population in the last few years (e.g., heatwave and drought in British Columbia, Fort McMurray fires in Alberta, heatwaves and floods of 2018 in Ontario and Quebec, storms in the Maritime provinces). As climate change accelerates, these impacts on populations will increase unless effective adaptation measures are implemented to reduce them and to protect populations most at risk of being affected. Examples of these adaptation measures specific to each hazard already exist, and should be vigorously implemented by civil society, municipalities, health authorities, provinces, and the federal government.\n\nKey Messages\n\nMany extreme weather events, and their health impacts on Canadians, are expected to increase in the coming decades, driven by the widespread warming. For example, extreme heat will become more frequent and more intense. This will increase the severity of heatwaves, and contribute to increased drought and wildfire risks. For most of Canada, precipitation is projected to increase, on average, although summer rainfall may decrease in some areas. Urban flood risks will increase due to more intense rainfalls (Canada’s Changing Climate Report, 2019).\n\nDeaths in Canada are projected to increase significantly by the end of the century due to the effects of rising temperatures (and extreme heat) if greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions continue to rise at the same rate seen over the past 30 years. Added to this are potential health effects of the changing pattern of some extreme weather events (e. g., wildfires, droughts, heatwaves, extreme precipitation) such as an increase in accidental injuries, anxiety and depression, water-borne diseases, cardiovascular problems, and respiratory illnesses. Workers directly exposed to those extreme events are already experiencing an increased burden of illness and injuries.\n\nCoastal regions face a multitude of increased risks to communities. Coastal flooding is expected to increase in many areas of Canada due to local sea level rise. The loss of sea ice in the Arctic, Eastern Quebec, and Atlantic Canada further increases the risk of damage to coastal infrastructure and ecosystems as a result of larger storm surges and waves (Canada’s Changing Climate Report, 2019).\n\nSome populations in urban and rural areas have limited access to the financial, social, health, and human resources needed to adapt to natural hazards influenced by climate change. Many First Nations, Inuit, and Métis communities experience a greater existing burden of health inequities and related determinants of poor health. This, combined with their close reliance on the environment for their sustenance, livelihoods, and cultural practices means they are uniquely sensitive to the impacts of climate change, including from natural hazards.\n\nSeniors are particularly at risk of suffering from the health impacts of climate change related events, such as heatwaves, cold snaps, drought, wildfire smoke, and floods. Age and chronic diseases are the main factors of vulnerability, and the fact that our society is aging rapidly will increase this risk in the next few decades. Seniors’ vulnerability can be compounded by loss of community cohesion, socio-economic inequality, and unhealthy behaviours.\n\nProvinces, municipalities, civil society, health authorities, and the federal government all have a key role to play in adapting to climate change. Despite progress on many efforts, adaptation measures are still lacking, especially for droughts, storms, and heavy precipitation. Moreover, populations at increased risk, and the preventable conditions that increase those risks, are often neglected by stakeholders when implementing adaptation measures.\n\nMany solutions that can reduce human exposure and vulnerability to natural hazards influenced by climate change are already known and should be better promoted. Those solutions include greening living environments, identifying at-risk areas, using early warning systems, improving access to resources, practicing integrated land-use planning, updating infrastructure, and raising public awareness.\n\nThe pace, nature, and extent of adaptation measures must increase rapidly and substantially to reduce the current and future health impacts in Canada, including climate-related evacuations and forced displacement.\n\n3.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nShare\n\nClimate change is projected to increase the frequency, intensity, and overall consequences of many extreme weather conditions in Canada, even under a low emissions scenario (Bush & Lemmen, 2019). In this chapter, these conditions are referred to as natural hazards, although they are not entirely natural since they are influenced by several human factors, including greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A natural hazard is a phenomenon — often an extreme meteorological or hydrometeorological condition (e.g., heavy precipitation or extreme temperatures) — that is likely to cause loss of life, injury, property damage, social and economic disruption, or environmental degradation (Morin, 2008). Thus, natural hazards involve impacts on humans or on infrastructure communities rely on.\n\nThe impacts of natural hazards on human health are of particular concern. From heat strokes to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, and psychological and social impacts, the health impacts of natural hazards are numerous and depend on complex processes involving individual, social, economic, and environmental factors. With growing recognition of these impacts, a significant number of research studies on such impacts have been carried out in Canada and abroad.\n\nThis chapter describes the state of knowledge on past and projected climate change on natural hazards, the links between those hazards and population health in Canada or similar countries (by demography, gross domestic product [GDP], climate), and key health vulnerabilities or risks. It also examines possible adaptation measures to these hazards to reduce their impact on the health of the population, based on published scientific studies. This chapter is therefore neither a descriptive nor exhaustive picture of the impacts experienced by communities in Canada, of the programs available to adapt, or of the measures put in place by decision makers. Only natural hazards influenced by climate change have been considered in this analysis.\n\n3.2\n\nMethods and Approach\n\nShare\n\nA review of scientific literature, published between 2008 and 2019, was conducted on knowledge related to natural hazards, health, and adaptation in developed countries with a temperate or polar climate, such as in Canada. To be included, a study had to demonstrate the relationships between health and a natural hazard influenced by climate change, for example, address vulnerability to a natural hazard or the effect of adaptation measures on these hazards and their potential to directly or indirectly minimize impacts on health.\n\nThe information in this chapter provides an update to previous Health Canada assessments from 2008 and 2014. Information on Canada’s changing climate and its changes in average conditions as well as changes in extremes (referred here as natural hazards) were obtained from the relevant chapters of Canada’s Changing Climate Report published by the Government of Canada (Bush & Lemmen, 2019). Other relevant studies were identified after the literature search phase and were included in the literature review. Grey literature was used to supplement existing scientific literature or to highlight relevant case studies. Studies conducted in Canada have been given priority, and studies from other similar countries (e.g., the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development [OECD]) were used when information specific to the Canadian context was lacking. Some were used for comparison with the Canadian context. Uncertainty in current data (e.g., unknown or little-known data) is taken into consideration by highlighting gaps in the scientific literature, limitations of some studies, or conflicting results. Research gaps and uncertainty in scientific evidence were also highlighted.\n\n3.3\n\nGeneral Trends in the Intensity and Frequency of Natural Hazards Influenced by Climate Change, and Links to Health\n\nShare\n\nAs concluded in Canada’s Changing Climate Report (Bush & Lemmen, 2019), warming of the Earth during the Industrial Era is unequivocal, and it is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), have been the main cause of this warming since the middle of the 20th century. This global-scale warming has also been accompanied by increases in extreme heat and decreases in cold extremes, increases in atmospheric water vapour, warming of the ocean, and decreases in snow and ice cover. Global mean sea level has risen due to the expansion of ocean water caused by warming and by the addition of meltwater previously stored in glaciers and ice sheets on land. These global changes driven by warming of the climate system affect Canada (Figure 3.1).\n\nThis widespread warming drives changes to, including increases in, many natural hazards: extreme heat, extreme precipitation and storms, drought, wildfires, flood risk, landslides, avalanches, and permafrost melt. These changes alter many ecosystems that then affect different populations. The climate and climatic events are determinants of health in many ways. They can affect the health of individuals directly (for example, through extreme heat or cold) or indirectly (by altering ecosystems which, in turn, lead to the emergence of new diseases), or by influencing other determinants including social determinants of health (e.g., loss of income during an extreme event) (Bélanger et al., 2019).\n\nHowever, individuals and social groups do not have the same ability to adapt to climate change (Bélanger et al., 2019) and some populations are at greater risk of the direct, indirect or social effects. This risk is a concept built around three variables: the occurrence of a natural hazard, the actual exposure of populations, and pre-existing vulnerability, which includes sensitivity to impacts and the adaptive capacity of individuals, populations and communities. To address public health challenges related to climate change, research and response must focus on these three parameters: understanding and delineating future hazards, identifying at-risk groups, and understanding their adaptive capacity. The following sections provide information on the impact of these past and projected changes on the health and safety. Public health officials can use this information to develop or update needed policies and programs with partners to protect Canadians.\n\n3.4\n\nAverage Warming and Extreme Heat Events\n\nShare\n\n3.4.1\n\nImpacts of Climate Change on Heat — Trends and Projections\n\nShare\n\n3.4.1.1 Annual Average Temperatures\n\nThe consequences of climate change are essentially the result of an increase in global average temperatures. Canada is no exception, having experienced an increase in average temperatures of 1.7°C between 1948 and 2016 (Figure 3.1), about twice the average warming observed globally (Zhang et al., 2019). Canada’s Northern regions (Northern Canada) are particularly affected, with an average increase of 2.3°C — about three times the global rate of warming (Zhang et al., 2019). Average temperatures for Canada as a whole are projected to rise by 1.8°C, under a low emissions scenario, and by 6.3°C, under a high emissions scenario, for the end of century (2081–2100) compared to 1986–2005. As a result, average summer temperatures will rise across Canada, albeit with large variations depending on region and climate scenario (Jeong et al., 2016). Under a high emissions scenario (RCP 8.5), southern cities such as Fredericton, Quebec City, Calgary, and Victoria could see their average summer temperatures rise by 4°C to 5°C for the 2051–2080 period, compared to observed temperatures between 1976 and 2005 (Prairie Climate Centre, 2019). In all cases, Northern Canada will continue to warm faster than Southern Canada, particularly in winter (Figure 3.2).\n\n3.4.1.2 Extreme Heat Events\n\nThere is no universal definition for extreme heat events (also sometimes referred to as heatwaves), and there is no consensus on terminology to describe hot weather (Gachon et al., 2016). The average increase in temperature also increases the frequency and duration of extreme heat events. Hot days with a maximum temperature above 30°C are rarely observed in regions north of 60° north latitude (Zhang et al., 2019). In Southern Canada, the number of hot days above 30°C increased annually by about one to three days over the period 1948–2016 at some stations, and is expected to increase there by up to 50 days annually by the late century under RCP8.5 (Zhang et al., 2019). Under this scenario, the annual median number of hot days is expected to vary from about 3 to 38 across Canada for the 2081–2100 period, with the Prairies and Ontario regions being more affected. As extreme hot temperatures will become more frequent and intense, it will increase the severity of extreme heat events (Zhang et al., 2019). The number of extreme heat events of at least three days above 32°C is likely to increase in regions of Southern Canada, where most Canadians live (Jeong et al., 2016). Some regions, such as the St. Lawrence Lowlands (in Quebec) and the Prairies, may experience two to three additional events per summer for the 2049–2070 period, compared to the 1970–1999 period (Jeong et al., 2016). The intensity and duration of these extreme heat events are also projected to increase (Sillmann et al., 2013).\n\n3.4.2\n\nEffects of Heat on Health\n\nShare\n\nIn Canada, the natural hazards with the best-documented health consequences are extreme heat events. Around the world, extreme heat is associated with increased all-cause mortality (Gasparrini et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016) and an increased risk of hospitalization for cardiovascular and pulmonary disease (Basu et al., 2012; Turner et al., 2012b; Lavigne et al., 2014; Moghadamnia et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018). The following subsections describe the observed or projected health impacts of extreme heat (Figure 3.3).\n\n3.4.2.1 All–Cause Mortality During Extreme Heat Events\n\nBetween 1986 and 2010, the average percentage of all-cause mortality attributed to extreme heat events in Canada was 0.53% (varying between 0.18% and 0.72% depending on the region) (Gasparrini et al., 2015). In 26 Canadian cities for which risk has been assessed, an extreme heat event appears to increase the risk of mortality by an average ranging from 2% to 13% (Guo et al., 2018). Another meta-analysis also found that the risk of mortality related to extreme heat events increases between 3% and 16%, depending on the definition of extreme heat event or heatwave used (Xu et al., 2016).\n\nIn British Columbia, 815 deaths could be attributed to extreme heat between 1986 and 2010. These deaths represent a 4% to 19% increase in the mortality rate the day after the event and a 2% to 19% increase within a week of the event (Henderson et al., 2013), depending on the city. An extreme heat event of nearly five days in Quebec in 2010 increased daily mortality by 33% in Greater Montréal and the rate of emergency department visits by 4% compared to similar periods (Bustinza et al., 2013). A very similar event at the end of the same summer had no measurable impact, which seems to indicate a physical and behavioural acclimatization to heat. Such impacts were also not detected during subsequent extreme heat events in Quebec from 2011 to 2015, except in the Montréal region (Lebel et al., 2017). It is essential to take into account night temperatures and the local environment to understand the impacts of heat on health. In British Columbia, a 5% increase in mortality was associated with forecast daytime temperatures of 29°C to 35°C and overnight temperatures of 14°C to 18°C, depending on the region (McLean et al., 2018). Humidity may have a significant effect on the relationship between heat and mortality, but the evidence is inconsistent in the literature (Barnett et al., 2010; Barreca, 2012; Xu et al., 2012; Parsons, 2014; Ho et al., 2016; Zeng et al., 2017).\n\n3.4.2.2 Characterization of the Relationship Between Mortality and Heat\n\nIn general, mortality associated with an extreme heat event increases as intensity and duration increases, with intensity having a greater effect (Xu et al., 2016). For example, an extreme heat event in Quebec in the summer of 2018 caused 86 deaths, while 291 excess deaths were recorded during the 2010 extreme heat event (Lebel et al., 2019). Although the two events were similar in scope, duration, and timing, the 2010 extreme heat event was more intense. Worldwide, heat-related mortality tends to decrease with warming global temperatures independently of the level of air conditioning use, indicating that people can become less susceptible to heat as a result of physical acclimatization, behavioural changes, and the implementation of structural adaptation measures (Arbuthnott et al., 2016) (see Chapter 10: Adaptation and Health System Resilience).\n\n3.4.2.3 Mortality Related to Climate Projections\n\nAs noted above, as climate warming continues, in addition to increases in average annual and seasonal temperatures, the intensity and frequency of extreme heat events will increase, as well as their impact on mortality in the absence of further adaptations. Compared to 1971–2020, mean excess mortality in 2031–2080 related to extreme heat events across Canada is expected to increase from 155% to 390%, depending on the GHG emission scenario (RCP2.6 for the lowest estimate and RCP8.5 for the highest). With high population growth in the future, these percentages range from 188% to 455% (Guo et al., 2018).\n\n3.4.2.4 All-Cause and Cardiovascular Disease Hospitalizations\n\nIn Ontario, the hottest days (99th percentile) between 1986 and 2013 showed a 6% increase in hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease compared to optimal temperatures, which showed the lowest mortality rate (Bai et al., 2017). For this period, an estimated 1.2% of overall hospitalizations for cardiovascular disease can be attributed to heat, with the majority of these admissions being related to moderate rather than extreme heat. In Toronto specifically, the number of heat-related ambulance calls was 12.3% higher during extreme heat events in 2005, 2006, and 2010 than during the week before and after (Graham et al., 2016). Increases in potentially heat-related hospitalizations and emergency department visits were also observed during regional heatwaves in some Quebec regions between 2010 and 2015 (Lebel et al., 2017). The 2018 extreme heat event in Quebec increased the number of ambulance trips in all affected regions by 11% to 23%, with some also seeing an increase in emergency department visits and hospitalizations (Lebel et al., 2019). Physiological acclimatization to heat appears to play a role: between 1989 and 2006, Quebec hospitalizations for ischemic heart disease were higher among seniors in early summer and decreased as the season progressed (Bayentin et al., 2010).\n\n3.4.2.5 Cardiovascular and Other Diseases\n\nAs described above, extreme heat events increase the risk of cardiovascular-related hospitalizations and excess deaths. In Ontario, for example, each 5°C increase in temperature during the summer from 1996 to 2010 was associated with a 2.5% increase in deaths, especially those related to cardiovascular disease (Chen et al., 2016). On the other hand, the duration of an extreme heat event also seems to play a role in the impact on cardiovascular disease. The association between cardiovascular disease and point days (one day) of extreme heat is more ambiguous than that associated with extreme heat events (Phung et al., 2016). In addition, various cardiovascular diseases do not appear to be similarly affected by heat (Phung et al., 2016). The effects of individual extreme-heat point days (one or two days) on cardiovascular mortality can generally persist to a week after the event, but not all studies agree (Huang et al., 2011; Martin et al., 2012; Ye et al., 2012; Huynen & Martens, 2015). In addition to these effects, extreme heat aggravates diabetes- and kidney-related complications (Hajat et al., 2017; Lim et al., 2018) as well as increases the risk of unintentional injury (accidents) (Kampe et al., 2016), renal colic (Ordon et al., 2016), retinal detachment (Auger et al., 2017f), and cocaine overdose (Auger et al., 2017a). In an Ontario study, however, heat did not appear to affect hospitalizations for high blood pressure or heart arrhythmia (Bai et al., 2016).\n\n3.4.2.6 Perinatal Effects\n\nSeveral perinatal complications are also associated with heat, such as premature birth and early delivery during exposure in the third trimester (Auger et al., 2014), miscarriage (Auger et al., 2017d), and congenital complications, such as heart or neural tube defects, from exposure in the first trimester (Auger et al., 2017b; Auger et al., 2017c).\n\n3.4.2.7 Indirect Impacts from Lower Water and Air Quality\n\nHeat also has indirect impacts on water and air quality (see Chapter 5: Air Quality and Chapter 7: Water Quality, Quantity, and Security). Among these impacts, it increases the risk of water-borne diseases in the population by promoting the proliferation of bacteria and cyanobacteria in freshwater sources (Funari et al., 2012; Sterk et al., 2013; Herrador et al., 2015; Chapra et al., 2017; Mayer-Jouanjean & Bleau, 2018). Increased temperatures also increase recreational water activities (e.g., swimming, kayaking, sailing, surfing), increasing the risk of skin (e.g., dermatitis) or gastrointestinal symptoms (Lévesque et al., 2014; Boyer et al., 2017; Askew & Bowker, 2018). A full review of health impacts related to the degradation of water quality or quantity in Canada is provided in Chapter 7: Water Quality, Quantity, and Security.\n\nIn terms of air quality, heat promotes the formation of air pollutants such as ozone, which are known to increase lung and cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality (World Health Organization, 2013a; Beelen et al., 2014). A comprehensive review of health impacts related to the degradation of air quality due to climate change in Canada is available in Chapter 5: Air Quality.\n\n3.4.2.8 Psychosocial Health\n\nHot temperatures also affect psychological and social health. Among their effects, high temperatures increase stress and people’s propensity for aggressive behaviour, as reflected in increased crime and violent crime rates observed in certain U.S. cities, particularly in deprived neighbourhoods; in 20% of these neighbourhoods, half of the increase in crime during specific periods has been attributed to high temperatures (Mares, 2013; Ranson, 2014). Extreme heat can also lead to isolation at home by discouraging outdoor activities such as sports and recreation (Zivin & Neidell, 2014), which can in turn reduce social interaction and physical activity. Isolation can also endanger the health of individuals who depend on their social network to cope with hazards, particularly seniors, minority groups, or low-income individuals (Bolitho & Miller, 2017; Williams et al., 2017).\n\nExtreme heat also contributes to the development of psychological and behavioural problems. In Toronto, for example, the highest temperatures (99th percentile) between 2002 and 2010 corresponded with a 29% increase in emergency department visits for schizophrenia, mood disorders, and neurotic disorders over a seven-day period compared to visits during average temperatures (Wang et al., 2014). A similar trend was seen in the southern region of Quebec (Vida et al., 2012), where in addition to heat, high humidity was associated with emergency department visits for mental health problems among those under 65 years of age.\n\nIn about 15 studies, high ambient temperatures were positively correlated with an increase in the suicide rate, with relative risk increasing by 1% to 37% on average for every 1°C increase in annual average temperature (Thompson et al., 2018). A meta-analysis covering 341 cities in 12 countries estimated that the highest risk of suicide was observed at an average temperature of 27°C (93rd percentile), but that each country was unique (Kim et al., 2019). In Canada, this maximum risk was observed at an average temperature 24°C, the 99th annual temperature percentile (Kim et al., 2019). The authors note that these analyses have limitations, and that further studies are needed. The exact cause of the increase in suicides on hot days is unknown.\n\nThe increased demand for social services and care in health care facilities due to the effects of heat increases the burden on these institutions, which may be challenged to meet these demands (Curtis et al., 2017). Increases in the health care demand related to heat also result in additional stress on social service and health care workers by increasing their workload (more clients); this stress can also increase the risk of reduced quality of care (Curtis et al., 2017). See also Chapter 4: Mental Health and Well-Being for an assessment of the impacts of climate change on mental health in Canada.\n\n3.4.2.9 Beneficial Impacts\n\nThe increase in temperatures, apart from extreme events, may have some positive impacts. Extending the summer season and increasing the number of days conducive to outdoor activity could encourage people to be more physically active or participate in more social events (Baert et al., 2011; Witham et al., 2014; Remmers et al., 2017). However, this effect will be partially or fully offset by the deterrent effect of extreme heat; time spent on outdoor activities plateaus and decreases when temperatures exceed 30°C (Zivin & Neidell, 2014).\n\n3.4.3\n\nPopulations at Increased Risk to Heat\n\nShare\n\n3.4.3.1 Seniors\n\nSeniors (generally 65 years and over) are at higher risk of the health effects of heat compared to younger adults because of their diminished ability to adapt physically, the fact that they adopt fewer preventive behaviours, and their higher level of social isolation and dependence (Bélanger et al., 2015; Laverdière et al., 2015; Laverdière et al., 2016; Valois et al., 2017b). Pre-existing chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes, which are more prevalent in seniors, are also risk factors for heat-related impacts on seniors (Laverdière et al., 2015; Laverdière et al., 2016; Hajat et al., 2017). In addition, people aged 70 and older do not always see themselves as vulnerable, which may make them less predisposed to engage in preventive behaviours (Boeckmann & Rohn, 2014; Valois, et al., 2020b). As the population ages in Canada, it is expected that the extent of heat-related health impacts will increase, in the absence of further adaptations.\n\nRisk factors, such as low socio-economic status, pre-existing conditions, use of medications, living in an urban heat island, social isolation, and loss of autonomy, can increase impacts from extreme heat. For example, seniors in southern Quebec (south of 49 degrees north latitude) with six or more of the above risk factors are eight times more likely to be admitted to emergency and seven times more likely to die or be hospitalized during extreme heat compared to those with no risk factors or only one (Laverdière et al., 2016).\n\nThe health risks for seniors also seem to be modulated by increasing temperatures or temperature variations between night and day. From 2006 to 2010, Quebec seniors were admitted to emergency departments and hospitalized 1.7 and 2.7 times more often on hot days, respectively, compared to normal summer days (Laverdière et al., 2016). According to meta-analyses, every one-degree increase in temperature increases all-cause mortality rates by 2% to 5%, cardiovascular illness rates by 3.4%, respiratory illness rates by 3.6%, and stroke rates by 1.4% on average among seniors, in addition to increasing the risk of diabetic, genito-urinary and infectious complications (Yu et al., 2012; Bunker et al., 2016). Variations in daytime temperatures also affect senior mortality, in part because of their decreased ability to adapt physically. A study examining impacts of heat on health in Montréal between 1984 and 2007 showed that a temperature change of 6°C to 11°C over 30 days increased daily mortality by 5% among seniors, and this increase reached 11% for a change of 11°C to 17.5°C (Vutcovici et al., 2014).\n\nThe majority of available studies do not compare seniors with other age groups; as a result, it is difficult to state with certainty that seniors are more affected. According to a meta-analysis comparing seniors to younger groups (15 to 64 years), the risk of heat-related death is only 2% higher for seniors (Benmarhnia et al., 2015). Other research indicates that people under 65 years of age are sometimes the most affected, as they spend more time outdoors (Alberini et al., 2011; Song et al., 2017). As a result, although older adults’ sensitivity to heat tends to increase with age, exposure may decrease. In Vancouver, for example, persons aged 65 to 74 had a higher risk of death than those aged 85 and over during the hottest week of 2009; the risk was highest for persons not living in institutions (senior residences, hospitals, clinics, etc.) (Kosatsky et al., 2012). Other vulnerability co-factors (e.g., chronic diseases) sometimes associated with seniors are discussed in the following sections.\n\n3.4.3.2 Children\n\nChildren are at an increased risk of extreme heat impacts due to their limited ability to acclimatize physically and to respond appropriately to stress. For example, the rate of temperature-related physical trauma visits and fractures is higher in children than in adults (Ali & Willett, 2015). Also, the incidence of kidney problems, fever, electrolyte imbalance, and respiratory diseases (e.g., asthma) in children increases significantly during extreme heat events (Xu et al., 2014b).\n\nIn regard to mortality, a systematic review of extreme heat events found that the existing literature is inconclusive about the relationships between child mortality and extreme heat events (Xu et al., 2014b). Although infant mortality associated with extreme heat events is low overall, it increases as age decreases, with children under the age of one being the most vulnerable, compared to children aged up to four years and aged five to 14 years (Xu et al., 2012). In Quebec, temperatures above 29°C were associated with almost three times the risk of sudden infant death (Auger et al., 2015). Finally, children living in urban areas are at increased risk of extreme heat event impacts, owing to increased exposure in urban heat islands and higher concentrations of air pollutants in cities (Vanos, 2015).\n\n3.4.3.3 Sex and Gender\n\nMen appear to be more at risk from the impacts of heat, but the causes are not well characterized. Quebec men aged 45 to 64 had a higher risk of hospitalization due to ischemic heart disease during extreme heat events from 1989 to 2006 (Bayentin et al., 2010). In addition, men between the ages of 40 and 69 also appear to be at greater risk of developing renal colic in extreme heat (Ordon et al., 2016). The current proposed hypothesis is that men are more likely to be employed in occupations with higher risks of exposure. In heat, there is an increased risk of placental abruption in full-term pregnancies, which can be fatal to both the mother and fetus (He et al., 2018).\n\n3.4.3.4 Chronic Diseases\n\nPeople with certain pre-existing diseases or reduced mobility are another population group vulnerable to the effects of heat. For example, in Fredericton, Winnipeg, Windsor, Regina, and Sarnia, people with cardiovascular or lung disease reported feeling ill more often during the previous extreme heat event (Alberini et al., 2011). In a study in Toronto, diabetes increased the likelihood of going to the emergency department or being admitted for a cardiovascular problem during heat events: other factors (high blood pressure, kidney problems, cancers, etc.) were also correlated, but were not significant (Lavigne et al., 2014). Respiratory diseases, and pre-existing cancer, have also been identified as comorbidity factors associated with going to or being admitted to emergency for a cardiovascular problem during heat events (Lavigne et al., 2014). Age can also influence the relationship between heat and comorbidity. In Quebec, people aged 65 and under in the most deprived neighbourhoods with at least two chronic diseases reported 4.2 times more heat-related health problems (Bélanger et al., 2014). Reporting of health problems was 5.6 times higher for people aged 65 and over. Between 2006 and 2010, seniors in Southern Quebec with significant disabilities (who require assistance to carry out daily activities) were 2.5 times more likely to be admitted to emergency and 2.7 times more likely to be physically affected by heat (Laverdière et al., 2016).\n\n3.4.3.5 Medication Use or Substance Misuse\n\nMedication can increase an individual’s risk of extreme heat impacts by accelerating dehydration and body heat production. Certain medications affecting the central nervous system (anticonvulsants, antidepressants, anticholinergics, and psychotropic drugs in general), diuretics, immunosuppressants, interferons, and some anticoagulants may increase the risk of hyperthermia (Health Canada, 2011; Bélanger et al., 2015).\n\nExcessive drug or alcohol use can also make individuals more sensitive to the effects of heat. In England, people with substance misuse problems were at higher risk of dying at temperatures above the 93rd percentile of annual temperature distribution (Page et al., 2012). Similarly, increased risk of mortality was associated with cocaine use during extreme heat events in Montréal (Auger et al., 2017a).\n\n3.4.3.6 Occupational Exposure\n\nOutdoor workers in construction, agriculture, forestry, and similar work environments have higher exposure to heat and its health risks, although some indoor workplaces, such as industrial settings and restaurants, may also be conducive to hyperthermia. The risk of injury and illness or disease at work increases during extreme heat, while worker productivity decreases (Adam-Poupart et al., 2014; Acharya et al., 2018; Levi et al., 2018; Adam-Poupart et al., 2021). In Ontario, from 2004 to 2010, every degree above 22°C increased the median number of hospitalizations for heat-related occupational illnesses and diseases by 75% (Fortune et al., 2014). In the provinces of Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, and Alberta from 2001 to 2016, each 1°C increase in the maximum daily summer temperature increased the number of daily heat-related illness claims (e.g. edema, syncope, exhaustion, sunstroke/heatstroke) from occupational health and safety compensation agencies by 28% to 51%, depending on the province and the meteorological heat indicator (Adam-Poupart et al., 2021). The claims for traumatic injuries (e.g., fractures, cuts, burns) also increase by 0.2% to 0.6% for each 1°C increase in summer temperature – where a 0.2% increase represents 64 additional traumatic injury claims by summer in Quebec, for example (Adam-Poupart et al., 2021). This risk of injuries is not influenced by the type of task (manual vs. non-manual tasks) (Adam-Poupart et al., 2015), but heat-related injuries are more frequent for men and younger workers (Adam-Poupart et al., 2021). Jobs requiring work outdoors, or in environments conducive to heat accumulation, place workers at higher risk of heat-related injuries (Adam-Poupart et al., 2015; Acharya et al., 2018; Varghese et al., 2018; Adam-Poupart et al., 2021).\n\n3.4.3.7 Urban Heat Islands\n\nUrban heat islands represent the observed temperature difference between urban and surrounding rural areas, as well as between areas of a given city — for example, between a park and an adjacent parking lot (intra-urban islands). These intra-urban heat islands are formed as a result of impervious surfaces and low albedo (solar reflectivity level) of urban spaces, combined with a low level of vegetation (Beaudoin & Gosselin, 2016). Albedo in cities like Toronto and Montreal hover around 0.2 on a scale of 1, indicating that the materials and colours used, such as dark roofs and asphalt, absorb a lot of heat during the day and release it at night (Touchaei & Akbari, 2015; Graham et al., 2016). These characteristics, combined with heat produced by motor vehicles, industry, appliances and air conditioning, raise the ambient temperature.\n\nThis results in higher rates of heat-related mortality in urban areas than in rural areas (Tan et al., 2010; Gabriel & Endlicher, 2011; Wouters et al., 2017). Although heat exposure is higher in urban centres, heat sensitivity in rural and remote communities may be higher (Liang & Kosatsky, 2020). Health consequences of heat exposure are therefore closely associated with the intensity gradient of intra-urban heat islands. In Montréal, for example, the mortality rate for respiratory diseases from 1990 to 2003 was higher in high-intensity heat islands than in cooler locations (difference of 6°C to 8°C), with rates being 1.4 to 14 times higher, depending on the intensity of the island as well as on ground-level ozone concentrations (Smargiassi et al., 2009). In addition, home property value was negatively associated with mortality: a higher value was generally representative of higher housing quality and better insulation, greater ventilation and air conditioning and possibly better health and, therefore, lower vulnerability. Urban heat islands also exacerbate health inequities. Individuals with low socio-economic status tend to live in neighbourhoods with high-intensity heat islands where the prevalence of greenspace is low, increasing their risk of heat exposure (Bélanger et al., 2014; Ngom et al., 2016).\n\n3.4.3.8 Indigenous Populations\n\nFirst Nations, Inuit, and Métis are particularly sensitive to the impacts of climate change, including the indirect impacts of rising temperatures on the environment and the direct and indirect impacts of extreme heat (see Chapter 2: Climate Change and Indigenous Peoples’ Health in Canada). Indigenous Peoples have close ties to the land, sea, animals, and natural resources that are being disrupted by climate change, particularly in Northern regions where many communities are located.\n\nDespite the lack of extreme heat in Northern Canada, Arctic and sub-Arctic Indigenous Peoples are being affected by warming temperatures. Reduced and weakened sea ice, permafrost, and ground snow cover, for example, have a wide range of impacts such as increased risk of injury and an increase in the number of search-and-rescue operations, and impacts on transportation, hunting, the ability to access traditional/country foods, and loss of Indigenous knowledge (Durkalec et al., 2014; Clark et al., 2016a; Clark et al., 2016b) (see Chapter 2: Climate Change and Indigenous Peoples’ Health in Canada). Warmer temperatures could also increase the incidence of food-borne illnesses by promoting bacterial growth and toxin formation in food storage sites (Hedlund et al., 2014; Bruce et al., 2016) (see Chapter 8: Food Safety and Security). Inuit populations, who use natural conservation methods and consume raw meats, are primarily at risk. These consequences could lead to a decrease in traditional food consumption among Inuit, Métis, and First Nations peoples. Traditional food is generally more nutritious and utilized more for spiritual traditions, compared to store-bought or processed foods. Inuit are already experiencing impacts of warming on traditional foods which is affecting food security in many communities. Nearly half of the First Nations populations in Canada experience severe or moderate food insecurity (First Nations Information Governance Centre, 2018). As a result of warming temperatures, First Nations peoples may reduce the quantity or quality of consumed food.\n\n3.4.3.9 Maternal and Social Deprivation\n\nIn addition to having more pre-existing illnesses, low-income individuals more often live in housing that is poorly insulated, poorly ventilated, and lacking air conditioning (Kosatsky et al., 2009; Bélanger et al., 2014; Bélanger et al., 2016). In Vancouver, the mortality rate in neighbourhoods with over 20% of residents living below the poverty line was 23% higher than other neighbourhoods during the 2009 extreme heat event (Kosatsky et al., 2012). However, a meta-analysis has indicated that the risk of heat-related death is not different between people living in areas considered deprived and those living in areas considered privileged (Benmarhnia et al., 2015). This finding was also observed in Quebec when comparing deprived to very deprived distribution areas and other distribution areas for the 2010 and 2011 extreme heat events (Lebel et al., 2015). While the impact of socio-economic status on deaths during hot periods is less established, the impact on medical or hospital visits is more obvious. In Quebec, people in the lowest income quintile were 20% more likely to see a doctor during extreme heat events because they were more affected by the health consequences of such events (Bélanger et al., 2014). From 2006 to 2010, seniors in southern Quebec with a household income under $20,000 were almost three times more likely to go to the emergency department, be hospitalized, or die from heat when temperatures exceeded 30°C (Laverdière et al., 2016).\n\n3.4.3.10 People Experiencing Homelessness\n\nPeople experiencing homelessness are more affected by extreme heat, which exacerbates existing health problems or causes new ones (Ramin & Svoboda, 2009; Cusack et al., 2013; Pendrey et al., 2014). A large proportion of the people experiencing homelessness experience mental health and substance misuse issues, ranging from 23% to 67% by city (CICH, 2007). They also have a higher prevalence of chronic diseases. However, this population’s health conditions remain poorly documented in Canada (Mental Health Commission of Canada, 2014). Between 136,000 and 156,000 Canadians use emergency shelters each year (Advisory Committee on Homelessness, 2018).\n\n3.4.3.11 Ethnicity and Race\n\nThe effects of heat on the health of racialized populations have not been studied in depth in Canada; relevant studies have mainly been conducted in the United States. For example, Black people were at a higher risk of being hospitalized during extreme heat events between 2001 and 2010 in the United States (Schmeltz et al., 2015). In most of 175 largest U.S. cities, racialized people have an average urban heat island exposure greater than non-Hispanic White people and people below the poverty line (in half of the cities), suggesting widespread inequalities in heat exposure by racialized people may not be well explained by differences in income alone (Hsu et al., 2021). However, the relationship between heat and mortality among racialized populations is rather complex, according to current literature, which indicates decreased, increased, or no effects across different groups (Gronlund, 2014).\n\nFor Indigenous Peoples, heat may cause significant health problems because of a number of compounding factors. Existing health inequality and inequities related to determinants of health among First Nations, Inuit, and Métis peoples increase their sensitivity to the health impacts of extreme heat. Indigenous populations generally have a higher prevalence of certain diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes (Chu et al., 2019; Hu et al., 2019), low income, and substandard housing, and all of these factors are associated with exacerbated effects of significant heat (Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, 2016). A disproportionate share of people experiencing homelessness in Canadian cities are Indigenous (Patrick, 2014) and, as highlighted above, homelessness is associated with higher risk of heat impacts on health.\n\n3.4.4\n\nHeat Adaptation Measures\n\nShare\n\n3.4.4.1 Individual Adaptation Measures\n\nAir Conditioning\n\nAir conditioning is often cited as a heat adaptation measure that should be prioritized. In buildings without air conditioning, indoor temperatures can reach 1.5 times the outside temperature (Lundgren Kownacki et al., 2019). In the United States, the risk of heat-related death is affected by temperature and the use of air conditioning (Nordio et al., 2015). The risk of heat stroke hospitalizations is also lower in counties with a higher prevalence of central air conditioning during an extreme heat event (Wang et al., 2016b). In the most deprived neighbourhoods of the largest Quebec cities, fewer people with indoor air conditioning reported experiencing adverse effects during extreme heat (Bélanger et al., 2015). Nevertheless, current literature in Canada and the United States also appears to indicate insignificant effects or no correlation between air conditioning and self-reported impacts of heat on health (Alberini et al., 2011; Bobb et al., 2014; Bélanger et al., 2015; Arbuthnott et al., 2016).\n\nWidespread use of air conditioning can also increase outdoor temperature due to increased electricity demand and the release of hot air outside the home. Simulations in Paris and Houston showed that widespread air conditioning could lead to a 2°C increase in outdoor temperatures in dense urban environments (de Munck et al., 2013; Salamanca et al., 2014). For low-income individuals, prolonged use of air conditioning in the home can significantly increase their electricity bills, meaning they have to choose between paying electricity or other expenses like rent (Ng et al., 2015). Thus, access to or the use of air-conditioned or cooling-off areas (public swimming pools, water play areas, parks) may be preferable for this type of population. Last, moderate use of air conditioning combined with other measures (structural modifications to roofs and windows, use of reflective materials, greening of the home or neighbourhood) may limit the negative effects of air conditioning (Mavrogianni et al., 2012; Fisk, 2015; Raji et al., 2015). The effect on GHG emissions, based on the electricity source used, must also be considered, given the effects on climate change and air pollution, which could significantly increase in Canada (Berardi & Jafarpur, 2020).\n\nFans\n\nSome studies report that fans are ineffective in reducing heat health impacts when temperatures are too high or when humidity is high. In Canada, however, using fans may be beneficial for individuals who are well hydrated given that observed temperature levels are often lower during extreme heat events than elsewhere in the world (around 31°C to 33°C) (Gupta et al., 2012; Jay et al., 2015; Ravanelli et al., 2015; Gagnon et al., 2016).\n\nBehaviours and Lifestyle\n\nSeveral other preventive measures can be adopted by individuals to reduce risks related to extreme heat, such as decreasing the use of certain electrical appliances (computer, dryer, oven, etc.), taking additional showers or baths, drinking more water, going out to cool places, and decreasing physical activity (Valois et al., 2017b). In Quebec, a heat adaptation index was developed with 18 adaptation measures associated with various variables, such as income, age, sex, and perception, to monitor these behaviours over time (Valois et al., 2017b). Perceptions of risk, control and personal vulnerability also influence individuals’ predisposition to adopt heat-prevention measures (Valois et al., 2020b). Whether people adopt preventive behaviours could explain the complex relationship between the risk of cardiovascular disease and occasional short-term exposure to extreme heat (Phung et al., 2016).\n\n3.4.4.2 Public Health Adaptation Measures\n\nHeat Warning Systems and Action Plans\n\nFollowing deadly extreme heat events in recent decades, several governments around the world have developed heat (or extreme heat event) health action plans, usually coupled with weather and health watch and warning systems. Heat action plans and warning systems should be based on pre-determined weather thresholds at which severe health risks increase, to ensure optimal implementation. Various guides are available in Canada on this topic, including a guide on determining warning thresholds for extreme heat events that was developed to help health authorities, municipalities, and all other stakeholders implement warning systems (Gachon et al., 2016); a guide on best practices for implementing a warning system and an extreme heat response plan (Health Canada, 2012); and a set of guidelines on medications, risk factors, and symptoms related to extreme heat stress to help health care professionals respond appropriately to extreme heat (Health Canada, 2011).\n\nIn Quebec, a semi-real-time weather and health monitoring and early warning system called SUPREME has been implemented since 2010. This may partially explain the significant decrease in mortality observed between the 2010 and 2018 extreme heat events, in addition to action plans implemented since then (Toutant et al., 2011; Canuel et al., 2019; Lebel et al., 2019).\n\nPublic health alerts issued through a variety of media and mechanisms (e.g., smartphones, radio, television, social media, community associations) activated when the outside temperature reaches a certain threshold and indicating preventive measures to be taken before and during extreme heat, are a way to quickly reach and inform people at higher risk. Research suggests that this type of system can decrease mortality and the number of people transported by ambulance to health centres for care (Toloo et al., 2013; Boeckmann & Rohn, 2014). However, the challenge for these warning systems is reaching the most vulnerable people, such as those who are isolated and experiencing homelessness, or those without electronic or telephone communication methods. In the Montérégie region of Quebec, this type of system was designed for seniors or those with certain pre-existing conditions. It increased people’s intention to go to cool locations during an extreme heat event, or to stay inside among participants, who adopted measures to keep cool at home (Mehiriz & Gosselin, 2017; Mehiriz et al., 2018). Women participating in a study on the system consulted a health care provider half as often as those in a control group.\n\nAction plans should also include provisions to support the most socially isolated individuals. For example, in Rome, the proportional increase in all-cause mortality among people aged 75 and above was 50% lower in neighbourhoods where a social outreach program had been implemented to improve social support for isolated and sick individuals (Liotta et al., 2018).\n\nOccupational Health and Safety\n\nThe decrease in the number of claims during extreme heat events in Australia, Europe and the USA seems to indicate that adaptation measures that are mandatory at a certain threshold (e.g., longer rest periods, more worker turnover, and better monitoring of worker hydration or level of physical effort) are effective in decreasing the effects of heat on workers (Xiang et al., 2014; Varghese et al., 2018).\n\n3.4.4.3 Infrastructural Adaptation Measures\n\nGreening Neighbourhoods\n\nGreening is an adaptation measure that can reduce the urban heat island effect (Giguère, 2012; Health Canada, 2020b). During extreme heat events in Toronto, the number of heat-related ambulance calls was five times higher in neighbourhoods with a tree canopy less than 5% compared to other neighbourhoods (Graham et al., 2016). This difference is 18 times higher compared to neighbourhoods with a tree canopy of over 70%. According to a simulation, a 10% increase in vegetation in the City of Toronto could cool daytime summer temperatures by 0.5°C to 0.8°C (Wang et al., 2015).\n\nThe benefits of vegetation can lead to a reduced mortality rate for people who live near greening projects and parks in general. A cohort study conducted over 11 years in 30 Canadian cities, with adjustments made for confounding variables found that increasing vegetation by one quartile in an area less than 500 metres from a residence decreased all-cause mortality related to diabetes and cardiovascular or respiratory systems by 8% to 12% (Crouse et al., 2017).\n\nMaterial Reflectivity (Albedo)\n\nIncreasing cities’ ability to cool down in hot weather is optimized when greening urban environments is combined with installing coatings and using high-albedo materials (Health Canada, 2020b). In general, a 0.1 increase in albedo (solar reflectivity) can reduce ambient temperatures by approximately 1°C during extreme heat (Santamouris, 2014). In a simulation, increasing ground albedo by 0.2 to 0.4, roof albedo by 0.3 to 0.7, and increasing vegetation in the City of Toronto by 10% could decrease perceived summer daytime temperatures by 3.6°C to 4.6°C (Wang et al., 2015). In Montréal, increasing albedo from 0.2 to 0.65 would decrease annual temperatures by 0.2°C and reduce temperatures on hot days up to 4°C (Touchaei & Akbari, 2015). This impact on ambient temperature has a direct effect on health. In three U.S. metropolitan areas (Atlanta, Philadelphia, and Phoenix), substantial greening (at least 50% of urban area) or a significant increase in albedo (above 0.45) could reduce projected increases in heat-related mortality by 40% to 99% by 2050 (Stone et al., 2014). In California, widespread installation of reflective roofs could reduce the increase in heat exposure from climate change by 51% to 100% by 2050, depending on the emission scenario (Vahmani et al., 2019).\n\nBuilt Environment, Urbanization, and Community Infrastructure\n\nUrban design can also influence the health effects of extreme heat (Health Canada, 2020b). In Vancouver, the risk of death in dense areas (≥1,000 people per square kilometre) is 43% higher than in less dense areas (Kosatsky et al., 2012). This effect is mainly explained by the low prevalence of residential air conditioning and the higher deprivation level of these neighbourhoods. In contrast, in Massachusetts, the heat-related mortality risk between 1990 and 2008 was not associated with urbanization measures (Hattis et al., 2012). Although population density is associated with the urban heat island phenomenon, urban sprawl increases the area with less reflective surfaces (e.g., roads, sidewalks, rooftops) and decreases in overall vegetated areas. For example, U.S. cities with greater sprawl experienced a larger increase in extreme heat events between 1956 and 2005 (Stone et al., 2010). To reduce the potential for heat storage in communities and associated mortality, urban densification should be combined with measures involving greening as well as increasing shade cover and solar reflectivity (Stone et al., 2014).\n\nThe quality of housing can also affect risks to health from heat. Using reflective materials (e.g., white-roof membrane), improving the insulation and ventilation in housing (active or passive), particularly in dilapidated housing in deprived neighbourhoods, and adding solar protection to windows (shutters, curtains, etc.) can substantially reduce residents’ heat exposure In addition, these measures are cost-effective in the medium and long term in terms of energy consumption (Mavrogianni et al., 2012; Porritt et al., 2012; Bélanger et al., 2014; Ngom et al., 2016).\n\n3.5\n\nExposure to Ultraviolet Radiation\n\nShare\n\n3.5.1\n\nImpacts of Climate Change on Ultraviolet Light — Trends and Projections\n\nShare\n\nThe level and intensity of ultraviolet radiation that is reaching the surface of the earth in a particular location is influenced by numerous factors, such as the time of the day, the season, ozone layer thickness, type of cloud cover, snow reflection, altitude, and latitude. Therefore, projections of ultraviolet radiation in future climate scenarios come with several uncertainties. The Montréal Protocol ozone-depleting substances international agreement was effective in protecting the stratospheric ozone layer and preventing global-scale increases in solar ultraviolet radiation (Neale et al., 2021). However, in “the Arctic, springtime episodes of stratospheric ozone depletion, identified first in the early 2010s, continue to occur. The last episode in the spring of 2020 led to the largest ozone loss measured to date and resulted in UV indices that were twice as high as typical at several Arctic locations,” such as in Northern Canada (Neale et al., 2021, p. 3). Outside the Arctic region, small changes in UV radiation trends over the last 20 years were mainly influenced by clouds, aerosols, and surface reflectivity (Neale et al., 2021).\n\nThe potential impacts of climate change on stratospheric ozone levels are complex and uncertain. With climate change, changes in stratospheric ozone and cloud cover could lead to a decrease in ambient ultraviolet (UV) radiation, particularly at Northern latitudes. Cloud cover is projected to increase north of 50 degrees north latitude and consequently decrease UV radiation reaching the Earth’s surface (Bais et al., 2015). Solar reflectance at ground level and concentrations of aerosols and nitrogen oxides also affect UV radiation reaching humans. In Northern Canada, warming temperatures will decrease solar reflectance at ground level and UV radiation by reducing snow and ice cover (Bais et al., 2015; Bais et al., 2018).\n\nSouth of 50 degrees north latitude, which is where the vast majority of Canadians live, cloud cover is expected to decrease, mainly resulting from an increase in GHG concentrations (Neale et al., 2021). In addition, at mid-latitudes (Southern Canada), increased GHG emissions are expected to stimulate ozone formation in the mid- and upper stratosphere (Bais et al., 2015), decreasing lower-atmosphere UV rays. The projected reduction in anthropogenic concentrations of certain air pollutants and aerosols could, by contrast, increase the intensity of UV rays, given that they are currently partially blocked by these pollutants. In addition, risky behaviours related to sun exposure, such as increased time spent outdoors and wearing clothing with little sun protection, tend to increase as temperatures rise (Zivin & Neidell, 2014; Pinault & Fioletov, 2017). The net effect of all these factors on the intensity and level of future UV exposure, and resulting health risks to Canadians, is therefore difficult to determine.\n\n3.5.2\n\nEffects of Ultraviolet Radiation on Health\n\nShare\n\n3.5.2.1 Skin Cancer\n\nOverexposure to UV radiation is the leading cause of skin cancer. The World Health Organization has classified UV radiation as a Group 1 carcinogen — sufficient scientific evidence of cancer in humans (International Agency for Research on Cancer, 1992). The risk of developing malignant melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, has been associated with exposure to ambient UV radiation in several countries including Canada (Watson et al., 2016; Pinault et al., 2017). Sunburns in children may increase the risk of melanoma later in life (Benedetti, 2019). UV exposure and the incidence of skin cancers are worsening as temperatures increase (Freedman et al., 2015; Kimeswenger et al., 2016; Kaffenberger et al., 2017). For example, a 2°C increase was estimated to increase the number of skin cancers by 10% annually (van der Leun et al., 2008; Kaffenberger et al., 2017). Although the incidence of melanoma in the last decade (2005–2015) has increased in many countries including Canada, a model indicates that if the Montréal Protocol would be fully implemented, about 430 million cases of keratinocyte cancer and 11 million cases of melanoma would be prevented just in the U.S., for people born between 1890 and 2100 (Neale et al., 2021).\n\n3.5.2.2 Cataracts and Eye Tumours\n\nUVA radiation can lead to premature aging of the eye, in turn contributing to the development of cataracts (Yam & Kwok, 2014; Delic et al., 2017; Bais et al., 2018; Ivanov et al., 2018). Repeated exposure can also lead to the development of skin cancer cells around the eye, precancerous sclera growth, conjunctival cancer, and intraocular melanoma (Yam & Kwok, 2014; Bais et al., 2018; Ivanov et al., 2018).\n\n3.5.2.3 Immunosuppression\n\nExcessive UV exposure can promote immunosuppression, both in the skin and throughout the body. A weakened immune system limits the body’s ability to defend itself against bacteria, viruses, and serious diseases such as cancer (Hart & Norval, 2018). That said, immunomodulation by solar UV radiation may also be beneficial to certain individuals: it can reduce the incidence of autoimmune disease, such as multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, chronic inflammatory bowel disease (e.g., Crohn’s disease), arthritis, and allergies (Sloka et al., 2008; Gorman et al., 2010; Lucas, 2010; Holmes et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2015; Lucas et al., 2015; Bais et al., 2018; Simpson et al., 2018).\n\n3.5.2.4 Vitamin D and Blood Pressure\n\nDespite its harmful effects, UV exposure from the sun is the most significant source of vitamin D in humans. Considerable scientific literature has documented the benefits of vitamin D in reducing bone problems such as rickets, osteomalacia, and osteoporosis (Ross et al., 2011; Wintermeyer et al., 2016). In 2009, 10% of the Canadian population had vitamin D deficiency, and 32% had sub-optimal blood levels for bone health, with these percentages increasing significantly during the winter months. (Vieth et al., 2001; Rucker et al., 2002; Janz & Pearson, 2013). Vitamin D may also promote cardiovascular health, and heart disease is the leading cause of death in Canada. Among its effects, exposure to solar UV rays releases nitric oxide into the skin, reducing blood pressure (Juzeniene & Moan, 2012; Halliday & Byrne, 2014; Liu et al., 2014). Assessments have suggested that 30-minute exposure to sunlight reduces blood pressure by 5 to 7 mm Hg and could therefore decrease the risk of heart attack by 34% (Cabrera et al., 2016; Weller, 2017). Other suggested benefits of an adequate blood vitamin D concentration include reducing the incidence of type 2 diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndromes, and cancers, although the causal process remains to be determined (Mitchell, 2011; Pludowski et al., 2013; Shore-Lorenti et al., 2014; Gorman et al., 2017; Bais et al., 2018).\n\n3.5.3\n\nPopulations at Increased Risk to Ultraviolet Radiation\n\nShare\n\nSome subpopulations tend to be more exposed to UV rays or are less likely to protect themselves from the sun, while others may be under-exposed. In Canada, sunburns occurred more frequently from 2005 to 2014 among men, younger age groups, people who were not members of visible minority groups, people living in higher-income households, and employed individuals (Haider et al., 2007; Pinault & Fioletov, 2017). Outdoor workers often exceed recommended levels of UV exposure and are therefore at higher risk of developing skin cancer (Schmitt et al., 2011; Fartasch et al., 2012; Peters et al., 2012; Modenese et al., 2018).\n\nGroups that may experience increased UV exposure are those with fair skin (e.g., Caucasian/White, with blond or red hair); conversely, individuals with dark skin who live in areas with low UV exposure are more likely to have a vitamin D deficiency (Jablonski & Chaplin, 2012; Correia et al., 2014). Travel to tropical climates, certain medications that make skin more sensitive, and the male sex were also factors for increased risk of UV exposure (Pinault & Fioletov, 2017; Pinault et al., 2017). The more fragile skin of young people was also a factor, especially when they play a lot outdoors without protection (The Ontario Sun Safety Working Group, 2010; Joshua, 2012). In addition, people who use certain medications or products that make skin sensitive to UV rays (such as antidepressants, antibiotics, diabetes medications, oral contraceptives, immunosuppressants, and some cosmetics) are more susceptible to photoallergic or phototoxic reactions (Monteiro et al., 2016).\n\n3.5.4\n\nUltraviolet Adaptation Measures\n\nShare\n\n3.5.4.1 Individual Adaptation Measures\n\nBehaviours and Lifestyle\n\nApplying sunscreen is known to be effective in protecting the skin from UV radiation, and wearing sunglasses is effective in protecting the eyes. The shade provided by a hat, long clothing, and infrastructure would be more effective than sunscreen in preventing sunburn and reducing UV exposure (Linos et al., 2012). Several factors can influence the adoption of protective behaviours to reduce exposure to the sun. One of the main barriers is a lack of general knowledge about the risks of solar UV exposure and the appropriate application of sunscreen (Weinstein et al., 2001; Dadlani & Orlow, 2008; Bränström et al., 2010). Other barriers include the thermal discomfort associated with wearing sun-protective (long and thick) clothing in hot temperatures, a positive attitude towards tanning for esthetic reasons, the belief that sun protection results in vitamin D deficiency, the cost of purchasing sun screen, and the perceived ineffectiveness or toxicity of sunscreen (Saraiya et al., 2004; Dadlani & Orlow, 2008; Youl et al., 2009; Bränström et al., 2010; Burnett & Wang, 2011). In practice, most people do not apply enough sunscreen, or apply it unevenly or only to certain parts of their exposed body.\n\n3.5.4.2 Public Adaptation Measures\n\nAwareness\n\nAwareness campaigns have been somewhat effective in encouraging sun protection behaviours, especially when they are widespread and accompanied by more structural changes, such as building shady areas, reducing outdoor time at schools, or distributing sunscreen (Sandhu et al., 2016). This combination of large-scale interventions is associated with a median 11% increase in sunscreen use (Sandhu et al., 2016). A number of governmental and private organizations in Canada promote this type of intervention (Health Canada, 2018). For example, the Sun Safety at Work Canada project aims to support the implementation of sun protection programs in the workplace in collaboration with employers and decision makers (Kramer et al., 2015).\n\nEnvironmental Monitoring\n\nIn terms of monitoring, Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC) created the UV Index as a tool to inform Canadians of the harmful potential of UV radiation (Fioletov et al., 2010). In 2018, ECCC began developing a new UV Index forecasting system that would provide hourly and longer-term (four days or more) forecasts, as well as regional and continental maps of UV radiation levels (Tereszchuk et al., 2018). Melanoma monitoring is also conducted by several organizations in Canada, such as the Canadian Cancer Society and the Public Health Agency of Canada (Canadian Cancer Society, 2019; Government of Canada, 2020).\n\n3.5.4.3 Infrastructural Adaptation Measures\n\nSeveral physical factors can also affect the level of solar UV exposure, such as artificial (e.g., buildings) or natural (e.g., large trees) structures that provide shady areas. Sun protection, in combination with thermal comfort, should be considered in urban planning. Green spaces, for example, can both reduce UV exposure through the shade they provide and increase it by encouraging people nearby to spend more time outdoors (Astell-Burt et al., 2014; Na et al., 2014; Porcherie et al., 2018). The City of Toronto is the first jurisdiction in Canada to include a shade policy in its planning (Kapelos & Patterson, 2014; Holman et al., 2018). Structures that provide shade can also result in reduced vitamin D production by limiting UV exposure. The vitamin D blood levels of individuals living in very dense areas with tall buildings may be up to four times lower than those of people living in an unshaded area (McKinley et al., 2011; Wai et al., 2015).\n\n3.6\n\nAverage Cold and Extreme Cold Events\n\nShare\n\n3.6.1\n\nImpacts of Climate Change on Cold — Trends and Projections\n\nShare\n\nOver the past 70 to 100 years, the average winter temperature has increased and there have been fewer extreme cold days, a trend that will continue in the future (Zhang et al., 2019). Warmer temperatures will reduce the length of the cold season across Canada and the intensity and frequency of extreme cold (Zhang et al., 2019). Compared to 1976–2000, most projected decreases in the annual number of frost days (<0°C) under a moderate climate warming scenario (RCP4.5) fall between 25 and 40 days for 2051–2080 and may reach 50 days along the Pacific coast (Prairie Climate Centre, 2019). Under a high-emission scenario (RCP8.5), these reductions are more than 45 days per year in most cases. The reductions tend to be smaller in the Prairies region and more intense in British Columbia and the Maritime provinces.\n\nContinuing the comparison between the 2051–2080 time horizon and the 1976–2000 period, simulations project a decrease in the number of extreme cold days (<−30°C) with climate change. While regions such as Southern Ontario, the Atlantic provinces, and the Pacific coast no longer reach those temperature levels, the Northern Prairies, Northern Ontario, and Northern Quebec are expected to see the number of extreme cold days reduced by 15 to 35 days per year under a high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) (Prairie Climate Centre, 2019). The number of cold days would be virtually reduced to zero in the St. Lawrence Valley and the Southern Prairies (Prairie Climate Centre, 2019). For example, extreme cold days are projected to drop from 52 to 14 in the Northwest (e.g., Yellowknife) and from 13 to two days in the Prairies (e.g., Saskatoon). Even if the reduction was less significant under less severe climate warming, few differences would be observed in Southern Canada.\n\nProjections for the duration of cold spells also vary widely across Canada. Under a moderate emission scenario (RCP4.5), projections for the reduction in the total duration of cold spells range from a single day in Quebec to approximately five fewer days in Northern British Columbia and the Yukon for 2081–2100 (Sillmann et al., 2013). The results under the high emissions scenario (RCP8.5) are similar; the difference between the two scenarios is less than one day for most Canadian regions.\n\n3.6.2\n\nEffects of Cold Weather on Health\n\nShare\n\nCold temperatures — whether they are extreme or not — are known to increase the risk of cardiovascular, respiratory, and stroke-related illness and mortality (Turner et al., 2012b; Gill et al., 2013; Phung et al., 2016; Ryti et al., 2016; Moghadamnia et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018) as well as general mortality (Gasparrini et al., 2015; Liddell et al., 2016; Hajat, 2017; Song et al., 2017). The duration of individual cold exposure that lead to these health effects is not well known (Ryti et al., 2016); some effects can be seen up to two weeks following extreme cold, and some take even longer (Kinney et al., 2015; Liddell et al., 2016; Phung et al., 2016; Ryti et al., 2016). Humidity can also influence the effects of cold on health, as both extremes (low and high humidity) appear to exacerbate cold-related mortality and morbidity (Mäkinen et al., 2009; Barreca, 2012; Davis et al., 2016).\n\n3.6.2.1 Mortality\n\nAccording to a study conducted of 15 Canadian cities, the mortality risk associated with the minimum temperature in Vancouver, Ottawa, Edmonton, and Montréal for the time period 1981 to 2000 was between 19% and 72% higher than the optimal mortality temperature (Martin et al., 2012). In Ontario, each 5°C reduction in winter temperatures corresponded to an average 2.5% increase in fatalities from 1996 to 2010 (Chen et al., 2016). However, another study, using a 30-day lag period, found no relationship between cold temperatures and mortality in Montréal (Goldberg et al., 2011). In Quebec, all-cause mortality is not associated with average temperatures below 18°C, when seasonality and influenza are taken into account (Doyon et al., 2008). The percentage of all-cause deaths due to cold was calculated for 21 Canadian cities and ranged by city from 1.96% to 5.53% between 1986 and 2012 (Gasparrini et al., 2015).\n\n3.6.2.2 Infections\n\nIndividuals also change their behaviour during extreme cold events, notably by increasing their time indoors. Cold temperatures thus coincide with the maximum incidence of influenza and respiratory infections such as pneumonia and bronchitis because they seem to promote the spread of such diseases (Mäkinen et al., 2009; World Health Organization, 2013b; Xu et al., 2014a; Bunker et al., 2016) (see Chapter 6: Infectious Diseases). Other infectious diseases can also be more easily transmitted in this way, although cold is also associated with a decrease in the spread of water-borne diseases, as observed in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions (Hedlund et al., 2014; Herrador et al., 2015; Bruce et al., 2016).\n\n3.6.2.3 Hospitalizations and Emergency Department Visits\n\nIn a systematic review, the risk of hospitalization was found to increase on average by 2.8% for each degree the temperature decreased below optimal conditions (Phung et al., 2016). In Quebec, the coldest temperatures between 1989 and 2006 were associated with a maximum 12% increase in excess hospital visits for ischemic diseases in winter (Bayentin et al., 2010). There are also more emergency department visits for ischemic heart disease in Quebec in the early winter, and these decrease as the season progresses, indicating a physical and social acclimatization effect (Bayentin et al., 2010). However, cold does not appear to have any particular effect on kidney problems and mental health disorders (Wang et al., 2014; Lim et al., 2018). Furthermore, no relationship was found between extreme cold (first percentile) and emergency department visits for psychological or behavioural problems in Toronto (Wang et al., 2014).\n\n3.6.2.4 Overall Impact on Health\n\nClimate change is expected to have a net effect of mitigating some of the adverse health effects of the cold in Canada. Projections under an average global warming scenario for 15 Canadian cities indicated that the annual rate of deaths due to cold could decrease from three to 19 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants by 2079, compared to current rates, depending on the city (Martin et al., 2012). In addition, warmer winter temperatures encourage individuals to spend more time participating in outdoor activities, which promotes physical activity and social connections. This increased time spent outdoors could also reduce the risk of spreading infectious diseases such as colds, influenza, and lung infections (Mäkinen et al., 2009; Bunker et al., 2016). However, warmer winter temperatures may increase the number of fractures, given that temperatures near freezing and rainfall followed by a significant drop in temperature have been associated with a higher risk of falling, according to a study in Montréal (Morency et al., 2012). Since winter is often associated with increased smog and concentrations of fine particulate matter, this increase could also increase exposure to air pollutants (Jerrett et al., 2005).\n\n3.6.3\n\nAnnual Cold and Heat Mortality Comparison\n\nShare\n\nBoth globally and in Canada, deaths from cold winter temperatures currently outnumber deaths from heat in summer (Martin et al., 2012; Gasparrini et al., 2015). From 1985 to 2012, 4.5% of all-cause deaths in Canada could be attributed to cold, compared to only 0.5% attributed to heat (Gasparrini et al., 2015). For Canada as a whole, this increases to 6.2% (for cold) and 0.7% (for heat) for the 2010–2019 period (Gasparrini et al., 2017), partly due to the aging of the population. This effect was also observed in Ontario, where, during summer, every 5°C increase was associated with four excess daily deaths; during the winter, every 5°C decrease was associated with seven additional daily deaths (Chen et al., 2016). The effect of cold or heat is often calculated based on the percentiles of average temperatures in a year (fifth percentile and under or first percentile for cold; 95th percentile and over or 99th percentile for heat) to estimate the effect of extreme temperatures.\n\n3.6.3.1 Geography\n\nUnlike heat, which affects cities more because of the presence of urban heat islands, cold appears to have a greater impact in rural areas (Bayentin et al., 2010; Conlon et al., 2011). The effects of cold on health can be felt for weeks after an extreme cold event, while the same can be said for only a week after an extreme heat event (Turner et al., 2012b; Bunker et al., 2016; Ryti et al., 2016; Moghadamnia et al., 2017; Sun et al., 2018). For both heat and cold, daily, weekly, or monthly temperature changes coincide with increased mortality and events, especially cardiac and respiratory events (Lim et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2014; Vutcovici et al., 2014; Vanasse et al., 2016b).\n\n3.6.3.2 Mortality Projections Up to 2100\n\nA few studies have examined the projected net effect of climate change in Canada on mortality associated with ambient temperatures. These studies suggest that the increase in heat-related mortality is expected to outpace the reduction in cold-related mortality in most, if not all regions. In Quebec, a net increase of 3% in annual mortality was projected for 2080 compared to 1981–1999 (Doyon et al., 2006; Doyon et al., 2008). Conversely, a study of 15 Canadian cities estimated that only four would see a net increase in mortality: London, Hamilton, Regina, and Montréal (Martin et al., 2012). Thus, the net impacts of temperature on excess mortality appear to vary across geographic regions. Temperature-related excess mortality between 2090 and 2099 in Canada is expected to increase compared to the 2010–2019 period under climate change scenarios RCP4.5, RCP6.0, and RCP8.5 (Gasparrini et al., 2017; Lavigne, 2020). Figure 3.4 shows the projected net mortality change across Canada for RCP8.5. Although in simulations some regions show improvements in mortality, the vast majority of health regions, both urban and rural, are expected to experience a net negative impact on health (Gasparrini et al., 2017; Lavigne, 2020). In these two studies, the percentage of all-cause deaths due to heat is lower than those due to cold, regardless of the scenario used.\n\n3.6.4\n\nPopulations at Increased Risk to Cold\n\nShare\n\n3.6.4.1 Age, Sex, and Gender\n\nOverall, seniors are at a higher risk of experiencing the effects of the cold (Ryti et al., 2016). A meta-analysis calculated that cardiovascular and respiratory mortality in people aged 65 and older increases by 1.7% and 2.9%, respectively, with a reduction of 1°C below optimal temperature (Bunker et al., 2016). On the other hand, some results in Canada indicate that people under 65 are more at risk than seniors. A study in Ontario found that each 5°C decrease in temperature between 1996 and 2010 increased the risk of dying from cardiovascular disease by 8% for those aged 65 and younger, and by 3% for those aged 65 years and older (Chen et al., 2016). Few studies have examined the effects of the cold on children’s health (Xu et al., 2012; Song et al., 2017).\n\nA Quebec study corroborated these results and estimated that men under age 65, particularly those aged 45 to 64, are at higher risk than those aged 65 and older and were more likely to have or die from ischemic heart disease during periods of intense cold between 1989 and 2006 (Bayentin et al., 2010). This could be explained by the fact that men generally spend more time outdoors for work or snow removal. This increases their exposure to adverse weather conditions and requires increased cardiovascular effort (Ali & Willett, 2015; Auger et al., 2017e). In Ontario, each 1°C reduction below 0°C between 2004 and 2010 led to a median 15% increase in the median number of visits to the emergency department related to outdoor work (frostbite or hypothermia) (Fortune et al., 2014).\n\nPregnancy and perinatal periods are critical windows of exposure to cold negative impacts to health. Cold appears to increase the likelihood of adverse effects at birth or during pregnancy, such as eclampsia, low birth weight, and premature birth (Strand et al., 2011; Poursafa et al., 2015).\n\n3.6.4.2 Chronic Diseases\n\nSome pre-existing diseases may also make people more susceptible to the effects of the cold. In Quebec, one study suggested that regions with higher smoking rates among those 45 to 64 years old have higher rates of hospitalization for ischemic heart disease in winter (Bayentin et al., 2010). This increase was also observed among smokers and alcohol drinkers in the United Kingdom (Sartini et al., 2016). In Toronto, people with pre-existing kidney or cardiac conditions had a higher probability of being admitted to the emergency department for cardiovascular reasons in extreme cold compared to those without this type of problem (Lavigne et al., 2014). This was observed in China among those with pre-existing respiratory diseases (Wang et al., 2016a). The impact of pre-existing morbidity on susceptibility to cold is also age-dependent.\n\n3.6.4.3 Material and Social Deprivation\n\nThe impacts of cold on individuals with low socio-economic status has not been studied extensively. In Quebec, the effects of cold on emergency department visits for ischemic heart disease are most significant in areas of low socio-economic status (Bayentin et al., 2010). In Portugal, low socio-economic status has been associated with winter mortality, with the relative risk being 1.75 times higher among those with low socio-economic status compared to those with high socio-economic status (Almendra et al., 2017). Winter heating costs can lead low-income and even middle-class individuals to turn down the heat to meet other needs (rent, food, etc.), forcing them to live in a cold home (Liddell & Morris, 2010; Howden-Chapman et al., 2012; Rezaei, 2017). A cold home increases the risk of exposure to outdoor cold and affects the perceived mental well-being and emotional resilience of residents (Marmot Review Team, 2011). Children appear to have a higher risk of developing respiratory problems, eating fewer calories, and spending more time indoors when the home is cold, which jeopardizes their physical and cognitive development (Liddell & Morris, 2010; Marmot Review Team, 2011). Energy insecurity in Canada averaged 8% in 2015, with peaks in the Maritimes and Saskatchewan (Canada Energy Regulator, 2017). This rate is three to four times higher than that in Scandinavian countries, but comparable to the European average (Thomson et al., 2017).\n\n3.6.4.4 People Experiencing Homelessness\n\nPeople experiencing homelessness are also very exposed to cold. A study in Paris, France, estimated that people experiencing homelessness accounted for 62% of those admitted to emergency departments for hypothermia or frostbite in winter from 2005 to 2009 (Rouquette et al., 2011). Many Indigenous peoples live in inadequate housing that require minor to major repairs (Statistics Canada, 2020), and may not be protective of cold temperatures. Indigenous peoples account for 10% to 90% of people experiencing homelessness in 18 Canadian cities, from Halifax to Vancouver (Patrick, 2014). They are therefore disproportionately affected by the effects of cold.\n\n3.6.5\n\nCold Adaptation Measures\n\nShare\n\n3.6.5.1 Public Warning System\n\nWarning systems should consider wind chill and the temperature felt when setting thresholds, since these variables are associated with the cardiovascular effects of cold on health (Lin et al., 2018). It is difficult, however, to make cold thresholds operational for preventive warning systems, given that wind and humidity forecasts have limited accuracy (Laaidi et al., 2013). Forecasting models do exist, nevertheless. In Quebec, depending on the climate region and based on the 1994–2015 period, health thresholds for a 2-day forecast based upon 25% excess mortality were set at between −15°C and −23°C during the day and −20°C and −29°C at night (Yan et al., 2020). In addition, thresholds based upon a 7% excess hospitalization, were identified as between −13°C and −23°C during the day, and between −17°C and −30°C at night. The thresholds used should also consider the climatic and anthropogenic characteristics of different regions. In Ontario, for example, the temperature threshold below which emergency department visits increase is lower in the North than in the South (VanStone et al., 2017). Health authorities should also consider that intense cold periods can affect the volume of emergency department visits for at least one week and should adjust their capabilities accordingly (Ryti et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2018). In Canada, schools can also close in extreme cold as part of efforts to keep students safe.\n\n3.6.5.2 Housing Insulation\n\nThe most common cold adaptation measures for individuals include wearing warm clothing and increasing time spent indoors, but people with cold homes will still be affected by staying indoors. Housing insulation reduces energy costs and makes it easier to maintain optimal indoor temperatures. Individuals who have benefited from a housing insulation program report better overall health and mental well-being after these renovations (Liddell & Morris, 2010; Howden-Chapman et al., 2012). For example, in New Zealand people aged 65 and over who had previously been hospitalized for cardiovascular or respiratory reasons were at a lower risk of death as a result of improved insulation in their homes, compared to a control group (Preval et al., 2017).\n\n3.6.5.3 Occupational Health and Safety\n\nThe Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety sets acceptable working temperature thresholds based on weather variables and the type of work (Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, 2017). All provinces and territories have adopted these measures as legal limits or guidelines. In addition, several international standards for best practices in cold weather risk assessment and prevention are available (ISO 11079, ISO 15743, etc.) (Holmer, 2009; Mäkinen et al., 2009).\n\n3.7\n\nDrought\n\nShare\n\n3.7.1\n\nImpacts of Climate Change on Drought — Trends and Projections\n\nShare\n\nPast observations do not indicate an increasing trend in the occurrence and severity of droughts in Canada (Bonsal et al., 2019). Climate change may change this trend, however. Although annual rainfall amounts will continue to increase (mainly due to the increase in rain outside the summer months), summer precipitation is projected to decrease in Southern Canada in the late century, under the high emissions scenario (Zhang et al., 2019; see also section 3.9 Precipitation and Storms). As a result, precipitation quantities will be reduced during the season when plants and agriculture need it most, particularly in the Prairie provinces (Prairie Climate Centre, 2019). Figure 3.5 shows projected average annual precipitation for Canada for 2021-2050. In addition, warming temperatures will increase water evaporation. As a result, the impact of climate change on drought in Canada will depend on the net effect of changes in the frequency, duration, and intensity of these conflicting drivers and is therefore difficult to estimate (Bonsal et al., 2019). Still, the Southern Prairies and interior regions of British Columbia are expected to experience an increase in droughts and water shortages in the summer through the end of this century (Bonsal et al., 2019). A similar projected has been made for Southern Quebec, where the maximum number of consecutive days without precipitation is expected to increase in summer and the annual number of unusual humidity events is expected to increase (Ouranos, 2015). Environments that rely on melting snow or ice for their water supply during dry seasons are also more likely to experience an increase in the number and intensity of droughts due to decreased overall snow and ice cover (including glacier loss), and change in streamflow seasonality due to increased winter flows, earlier snow melt, and reduced summer streamflow (Bonsal et al., 2019) (see Chapter 7: Water Quality, Quantity, and Security).\n\n3.7.2\n\nEffects of Drought on Health\n\nShare\n\n3.7.2.1 Indirect Health Impacts from Lower Air Quality\n\nDrought increases the amount of dust (PM2.5 and PM10) in the air, as particles are more mobile when not weighed down by moisture (see Chapter 5: Air Quality). In the United States, overall PM2.5 concentrations are projected to increase by 16% in 2100 compared to 2000, simply due to the increased number of droughts (Wang et al., 2017). Because fine particulate matter increases the risk of mortality from respiratory and cardiovascular diseases (Kim et al., 2015), the increased frequency and intensity of droughts could increase overall mortality. For example, it has been estimated that the increase in fine dust concentrations in the air in the Southwestern United States could increase mortality from 24% to 130% from 2076–2095, compared to 1996–2015 (Achakulwisut et al., 2018). This trend was observed in the United States, where periods of worsening drought conditions increased the mortality rate by 1.55% between 2000 and 2013 compared to other periods (Berman et al., 2017). Droughts also indirectly affect air pollutant concentrations by increasing wildfires (see Chapter 5: Air Quality).\n\n3.7.2.2 Infectious Diseases\n\nWinds, combined with dry weather, can also facilitate the transport of pollens, mould, fungi, bacteria, and other organic matter (Stanke et al., 2013). Droughts can cause and exacerbate allergic and respiratory symptoms and promote the spread of infectious diseases. Related respiratory diseases include bronchitis, sinusitis, pneumonia, and asthma (Yusa et al., 2015; Doede & Davis, 2018). Some evidence points to an increase in cases of vector-borne diseases such as West Nile virus and encephalitis, during droughts, although a decrease is observed for other diseases, such as Lyme disease (Yusa et al., 2015) (see Chapter 6: Infectious Diseases).\n\n3.7.2.3 Water-Borne Diseases\n\nDroughts can increase pathogen concentrations in water and facilitate the transport of organic matter to water bodies during subsequent rainfall (Funari et al., 2012; Cann et al., 2013). As a result, they may increase the risk of water-borne diseases through surface water, although few studies have evaluated the effects of droughts in this regard (Levy et al., 2016) (see Chapter 7: Water Quality, Quantity, and Security). In some rural Quebec municipalities, the risk of gastrointestinal disease was at least twice as high within four weeks of very low precipitation events (Febriani et al., 2010). In Greater Vancouver, the number of Cryptosporidium and Giardia cases increased significantly up to six weeks after a heavy rainfall day following a severe drought (Chhetri et al., 2017).\n\n3.7.2.4 Food Security\n\nDroughts weaken crops, predisposing them to mycotoxin contamination (toxins produced by certain moulds) and making them vulnerable to insect attacks (van der Kamp, 2016; Medina et al., 2017). Declining agricultural yields can increase consumer prices and affect people experiencing food insecurity due to social disparities (see Chapter 8: Food Safety and Security).\n\nAreas such as the Southern Prairies and Prince Edward Island, where agriculture is a significant part of their economy and identity, are more vulnerable to droughts. For example, droughts in 1980 and 2001–2002 each cost Canadians an estimated $5.8 billion, excluding health costs (Wheaton et al., 2008; Diaz et al., 2016). Droughts reduce agricultural productivity, increase personal debt for farmers, devalue land, and reduce employment opportunities in rural areas (Guiney, 2012). By reducing the economic viability of rural areas, droughts can result in rural exodus and perpetuate a vicious cycle of vulnerability (Vins et al., 2015). This loss of viability in rural areas can ultimately affect the mental and social health of the people living there.\n\n3.7.3\n\nPopulations at Increased Risk to Drought\n\nShare\n\n3.7.3.1 Rural Living\n\nRural populations are at increased risk to impacts of droughts compared to urban populations because they are generally more dependent on agricultural activities for their economic well-being and because their proximity to natural environments means that the deterioration of the environment affects them more directly. The resulting financial, social, and emotional stress can negatively affect the psychosocial well-being of rural populations. However, these effects have not been studied extensively in a Canadian context; most studies on the subject have been conducted in Australia and may not be representative of Canada (see Chapter 4: Mental Health and Well-Being).\n\n3.7.3.2 Psychosocial Health\n\nAustralian farmers who report that droughts have significantly reduced their agricultural productivity have more mental health problems and a lower level of psychological well-being compared to unaffected farmers (Edwards et al., 2015). Rural children and adolescents affected by Australian droughts report higher-than-normal levels of emotional and relationship distress (Dean & Stain, 2010; Carnie et al., 2011).\n\nDrought duration and intensity are determining factors of the impact a drought can have on the psychological distress of affected populations. In Australia, a drought of more than one year increased the incidence of psychological distress among rural residents by 6% (OBrien et al., 2014). In extreme cases, droughts may also increase the suicide rate in some population subgroups (Gunn et al., 2012; Hanigan et al., 2012). For example, rural men aged 10 to 49 had a higher risk of suicide during intense droughts (up to 15%) (Hanigan et al., 2012). On the other hand, available data are somewhat contradictory for women and seniors, who, in some cases, were at a lower risk of suffering from psychological problems or committing suicide (Hanigan et al., 2012; Powers et al., 2015; Crnek-Georgeson et al., 2017). For urban populations, mental health risks do not appear to be affected by droughts regardless of their duration or intensity (Gunn et al., 2012; Hanigan et al., 2012; OBrien et al., 2014).\n\n3.7.3.3 Food Insecurity and Malnutrition\n\nDrought-related stress and financial insecurity can also have a negative impact on food quality, as demonstrated by studies in Australia (see also Chapter 8: Food Safety and Security). Rural populations affected by a particularly long and intense drought between 2001 and 2008 ate more high-sugar and high-fat foods compared to those who were not affected or for whom the drought was shorter (Friel et al., 2014). Children are particularly at risk because the quality of their diet is critical to their physiological and cognitive development (Martinez Garcia & Sheehan, 2016). In addition to the agricultural sector, the economic viability of the forest industry and its workers may also be compromised by droughts, as they fuel wildfires (Bonsal et al., 2011).\n\n3.7.3.4 Age, Sex, and Gender\n\nPeople vulnerable to the effects of droughts are also vulnerable because of associated increases in pollutant concentrations in the air and water. In children, droughts can increase the risk of developing and exacerbating respiratory problems. In California, the number of emergency department visits for childhood asthma doubled in the years of severe drought from 2012 to 2016 compared to previous years, with children close to farmland at greater risk (Doede & Davis, 2018). Seniors, people with chronic diseases, fetuses during pregnancy, low-income individuals, and outdoor workers are also more exposed or sensitive to air pollutants, which can be amplified during droughts (see Chapter 5: Air Quality). In addition, children, seniors, and immunocompromised people are at higher risk of contracting waterborne diseases (Funari et al., 2012; Cann et al., 2013).\n\n3.7.4\n\nDrought Adaptation Measures\n\nShare\n\n3.7.4.1 Awareness of Psychosocial Impacts\n\nRural populations are more reluctant to seek help when they need it (Berry et al., 2011; Gunn et al., 2012). In particular, the stigma attached to mental health problems decreases the likelihood of people seeking help for these types of problems. Promoting mental health literacy, organizing social events in times of drought, establishing a telephone support line, as well as creating psychosocial programs, can promote social acceptance of mental health problems and of seeking help, if necessary (Hart et al., 2011).\n\n3.7.4.2 Financial Support Programs and Monitoring and Warning Systems\n\nSeveral rural Canadian communities have implemented drought adaptation measures. Provinces such as Saskatchewan and Alberta have implemented drought monitoring systems, emergency plans for extended dry conditions, and programs to improve environmental management infrastructure (irrigation, reservoir, etc.) (Hurlbert & Gupta, 2016). A drought monitoring and reporting tool is also available across Canada (Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, 2021). Low-labour agriculture, crop diversification and rotation, as well as the use of species more resistant to dry conditions, are other options to reduce the vulnerability of crops and people working in agriculture. These measures were used during droughts in the Prairies in 2001 and 2003, where they reduced losses (Abbasi, 2014; Diaz et al., 2016). Nevertheless, infrastructures and strategies are often implemented on the basis of past climate data and are therefore not adapted to the increasing frequency and intensity of drought (Mcmartin et al., 2018). In California, it was estimated that a water management policy using past data would not meet water demands in future droughts. It would underestimate water supply needs by up to 58% compared to an adaptive policy that takes account of future climate conditions (Georgakakos et al., 2012). Vodden & Cunsolo (2021) identify adaptation options to better prepare for future drought impacts and reduce financial stress they cause. Such options include winter water storage to feed summer irrigation, agroclimatic atlas to support the development of drought-adapted crop varieties and improved infrastructure such as dams or intake pipes (Warren & Lulham, 2021).\n\n3.7.4.3 Monitoring the Indirect Impacts of Drought on Air and Water Quality\n\nMonitoring air quality and water-borne dise"
