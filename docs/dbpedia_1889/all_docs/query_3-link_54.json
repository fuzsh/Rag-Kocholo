        "text": "Introduction/Motivation\n\nHow we know where we are? (Possible answers: Because we can see that we are in the school, we have maps, use a compass, or we just know.) However, that does not tell you where you are. In a classroom, there are many ways to feel comfortable just by knowing where you are in relation to the other places that you already know — this is called landmark navigation.\n\nWhat if you were in the middle of the ocean? All you can see is water all the way to the horizon in every direction! How do you know where you are now? (Possible answers: Maps? Perhaps a savvy student suggests: Stars!)\n\n(Draw a box on the chalkboard and put a few waves in it.) Would this this map be helpful to you? (Answer: No) Is there anything around you that you can see and recognize? (If no student has mentioned it yet, suggest stars to help determine where they are.) Refer to the associated activity Nidy-Gridy: Using Grids and Coordinates for students to learn the importance of making maps that all can understand!\n\n(Draw another box on the chalkboard and put a few stars in it.) How helpful is this type of map? (Listen to student suggestions.) Even if you recognize patterns in the stars, there is another problem: almost all of the stars move throughout the night. Only the North Star is fixed.\n\nUsing the North Star is a good start to determining your location because you can always find the direction north. However, you can see the North Star from anywhere in the Northern Hemisphere, so you have actually only narrowed your location down to one half of the Earth! Before modern technology, people did navigate using the stars, but it was not easy.\n\nIn this unit on navigation, you will learn more about navigating with the stars. Today, you will start by learning to navigate in your own clssroom.\n\nLesson Background and Concepts for Teachers\n\nThe following topics will be discussed: latitude and longitude; degrees, minutes and seconds; compass and maps; measuring latitude and longitude, the Earth's magnetic field (how a compass works); and global positioning system (GPS). Refer to the associated activity Northward Ho! Create and Use Simple Compasses for students to learn how important magnetic directions are for maps. They also make a basic compass to determine the direction north in the classroom.\n\nThe measurement that tells you how far you are north or south is called latitude. On a globe, latitude lines appear as parallel rings that wrap the Earth (see Figure 1).\n\nIn the Figure 2 map , the surface of the Earth has been flattened and stretched at the top and bottom so that it is rectangular. Here, latitude is shown as horizontal red (or bold) lines, and the equator is shown as a thicker red (or bold) line. All points on any one latitude line are the same distance from the equator. Latitude lines are also called parallels because on a globe, latitude lines never touch each other — they are parallel to one another.\n\nThe measurement that tells you how far you are east or west of the Prime Meridian (the thick line that passes through Greenwich, England, and part of Africa) is called longitude. On a globe, longitude lines appear as vertical bands that meet each other at the North and South Poles. They are not parallels (like latitude lines), since they actually all touch each other on the north and south ends of the Earth.\n\nIn the Figure 2 map, longitude is shown as vertical lines, and the prime meridian is a shown as a thicker red (bold) line. Longitude measures how far east or west along the equator something is located.\n\nPutting the latitude and longitude together, we now have a grid that allows us to identify any point on the Earth.\n\nMeasuring Latitude and Longitude\n\nLongitude: Just like a circle, any longitude line (or ring) on the Earth is separated into 360 degrees. It is easiest to visualize along the equator. Looking at the longitude map (Figure 3), there are 24 sections (divided by the red lines), 12 each for the west and east sides. Taking 360 degrees and dividing by 24, we know that each section is 15 degrees across. The reference point (or zero degrees) is from prime meridian, which is located at Greenwich, England. From here you can measure 180 degrees to the west, 0 to –180 degrees. You can also measure 180 degrees to the east, 0 to 180 degrees. Western degrees are always negative, and eastern degrees are always positive. As an example, Boulder, CO, is at –105 degrees longitude.\n\nLatitude: Starting from the equator, you can measure 90 degrees northward and 90 degrees southward. As an example, Boulder, CO, is at 40 degrees N (north). The South Pole is at 90 degrees S (south), and the North Pole is at 90 degrees N. The distance covered by a single degree is too large for practical use, so the system of minutes and seconds was developed. A degree is divided into 60 minutes. For even more detailed use, a minute is divided into 60 seconds. One second of latitude corresponds to about 30 meters on the surface of the Earth.\n\n1 degree = 60 minutes\n\n1 minute = 60 seconds\n\n1 degree = 3600 seconds (60 minutes x 60 seconds)\n\nCompasses and the Earth's Magnetic Field\n\nThe Earth has a magnetic field that flows from the geomagnetic South Pole to the geomagnetic North Pole. It is this field that causes the alignment of a compass needle, which is magnetized. Luckily, the geomagnetic poles are close to the geographic poles. Therefore, when a compass needle points in the direction of the magnetic field (pointing towards the geomagnetic North Pole) it is pointing pretty close to the geographic North Pole (or, true north).\n\nThe slight deviation from the geomagnetic pole and the geographic pole is called the declination. On any good map, the declination for that area will be shown. This way you can calibrate your compass, which is pointing to geomagnetic north, to point at the geographic north, or True North. For younger students, refer to the associated activity Find Your Own Direction where students get the chance to create their own simple compass using thread, needle and water in a bowl — and learn how it works.\n\nThe origin of the magnetic field is still a question that has not been fully resolved, but many geophysicists believe it is generated as the rotation of the Earth causes slow movements in the liquid outer core. The magnetic lines of force resemble those that would be formed if there were an imaginary bar magnet extending through the Earth's interior. At the present time, the geomagnetic pole is located 11 degrees of latitude from the geographic pole.\n\nGlobal Positioning System\n\nThe global positioning system (GPS) is a publicly available system that can be used to find a position anywhere on our planet. To use it, you need a device called a GPS receiver. More than 24 satellites continually circle the Earth and broadcast radio signals. A GPS receiver accepts these signals and uses them to determine its, or your, position. GPS receivers are relatively inexpensive, user friendly and accurate. A \"no-frills\" receiver costs around $100. To determine your position using a GPS receiver, all you have to do is turn it on, wait a few minutes, and the receiver reveals your latitude and longitude. A-top-of-the-line receiver is accurate within approximately 20 ft. of your actual location. Besides all the commercial/industrial uses, they are very popular for personal recreational activities. The GPS tells you where you are, and can keep track of where you have been and help you return there. This is helpful if you are hiking in mountainous areas — on or off trails, boating, or skiing, among other activities. GPS will be covered in more depth in later lessons."
