Some analysts and observers suggest it should provide tested risk management measures including technologies to those that are in dire need for support due to increasing climate-related risk, while others suggest compensation is to be considered. Other voices consider the debate to largely be of symbolic character emphasising the need to avoid dangerous climate change by heavy mitigation. Many insiders have been wondering whether these perspectives can be disentangled and even reconciled. We suggest that there is potential for doing so and assert that the space for the Loss and Damage mechanism overall can be defined to encompass \"transformative measures for avoiding and managing intolerable risks as well as curative measures for dealing with unavoided and unavoidable impacts.\"\n\nThe suggestions build on three lines of analysis, which have been fundamental for the debate on Loss and Damage. The first is a broad view towards jointly considering climate change and climate variability, thus providing a link to expertise around disaster risk management for managing today's adaptation deficits. The other building block is a consideration for risk preference, which in this context is framed as risk acceptance, tolerance, and intolerance in order to consider any limits to adaptation. Finally, we suggest a balance between distributive and compensatory justice as essential. This implies taking a distributive justice perspective, referring to sharing burdens in a demand-driven mode among agents without a need for causal climate attribution (the set-up in the DRM space currently), while compensatory justice, referring to the unequal levels of historical and current emissions produced, is to be upheld as well as a key principle motivating additional support and funding for managing climate-related risk. Overall, our discussion provides a principled framework for aligning perspectives and discussing policy options, incl. financing, climate-related insurance, comprehensive disaster risk management and a climate displacement facility, which are all options that are under discussion as the climate negotiations are going forward. The talk presents the rationale and some first quantification of the cost of supporting the implementation of the options discussed.\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nDue to the decisions on the adoption of the Paris agreement, it has become very unlikely that measures to deal with climate loss and damage can be handled within the intuitively most plausible framings; liability and compensatory justice. From an ethical perspective, this paper argues that even in light of decision 1/CP.21 liability and compensation will have an important role to play for realizing Article 8 of the agreement. The paper shows how liability and compensation conceptually can be teared apart and why this separation is justified on ethical grounds. This opens up the space for a new way of thinking about compensatory entitlements and the distribution of liabilities. Compensatory entitlements concern the measures needed to make whole again the victims of climate loss or damage. Liability, by contrast, concerns the differentiated duties of all parties to the UNFCCC according to their varying capacities but irrespective of their contribution to climate change.\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nSea level rise and the increased frequency and intensity of coastal storms are imposing time limits - albeit of unknown duration - on the use of coastal property. As coastal hazards escalate, the value of coastal property will fall. However, it will not fall to zero. There will still be demand for the use of coastal land until it is fully claimed by the sea. Under climate change, freehold coastal property is essentially converting into a leasehold interest, where the term of the lease becomes the period of safe occupancy.\n\nUnabated economic development at the coasts suggests that the risk climate change poses to the world’s coastal capital stock is currently under-priced. This presentation proposes a model for calculating the value of coastal property under climate change using a term-structure-of-lease-rates methodology. The difference between the leasehold value and the freehold value quantifies, in today’s dollars, the loss induced by climate change on coastal property. The model demonstrates how the value of the lease falls as escalating hazards increase the cost of occupying coastal property through: increased insurance premiums and excesses; higher loan to value ratios on mortgages; private cost sharing to support the maintenance of public infrastructure; and private property repair, accommodation and defence. The model explores thresholds that influence the lease term including insurance retreat, mortgage retreat, infrastructure retreat and catastrophic events.\n\nBy deploying valuation methods already well established in the real estate industry, this model may provide a defensible method for quantifying potential compensation for economic loss imposed on coastal communities and nations under each of the IPCC’s four Representative Concentration Pathways. This model may also be applicable to other resource degradation risks caused by climate change including escalating hazards from riparian flooding, land lost to desertification, and water scarcity caused by permanent snowpack loss.\n\nCo-author: Elisa Lanzi\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nThe need for integrated analysis of climate change and air pollution policies is widely acknowledged, often referred to as co-benefits. Much less is known, however, about how damages from climate change and damages from air pollution affect regional economies in the coming decades.\n\nThis paper focuses on the economic consequences of both climate change and outdoor air pollution until 2060. We build a dynamic CGE model with a common methodology for evaluating the joint economic consequences of climate change and air pollution. We use a production function approach that specifies sectoral and regional climate and air pollution impacts on specific inputs into the economy.\n\nThe modelling results highlight that despite significant climate forcing from various air pollutants, the net interaction effects through emission feedbacks are limited. Furthermore, the effect of climate damages on air pollution emissions and thus air pollution impacts, and the effect of air pollution damages on GHG emissions and thus climate damages are relatively small in comparison to the uncertainties surrounding the damage estimates.\n\nAlthough the effects of climate change play out over a longer time horizon than those of air pollution, the coming decades are projected to have significant economic repercussions from both. For both cases, the majority of damages are located in relatively fragile economies in Asia and Africa. The largest percentage losses are observed in agriculture, where both climate change and air pollution have significant adverse effects. Furthermore, in the most affected regions and sectors there is a small but positive interaction effect: the damages from both types of impacts together is smaller than the sum of individual damages.\n\nWe finally quantify the non-market damages on premature deaths from heat stress and air pollution. These are not integrated in the modelling exercise, but their sheer size warrants that they are considered.\n\nCo-authors: Francisco Estrada, Wouter Botzen\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nCLIMRISK is an economic integrated assessment model for supporting decision-making at the global, national and subnational scales. This model is composed of simplified emulators of much more complex models of climate and the economy that allows for a finer spatial resolution, to include impact dynamics and to produce risk measures. Climate hazards and exposure are not uniformly distributed across and within regions and countries. As such, CLIMRISK uses a 0.5ºx0.5º spatial resolution for climate and socioeconomic variables. The climate module emulates 20 general circulation models and produces probabilistic regional projections using a range of climate sensitivity values (high, medium and low). The GDP and population projections share the same spatial resolution as the climate projections and combine information from the SSP/SRES datasets produced by a variety of leading integrated assessment modelling groups. The CLIMRISK model currently has two sets of contrasting damage functions to provide a representation of the uncertainty in the economic impact projections. The conservative set of damage functions is based on the RICE model but it was modified to be driven by changes in temperature at the gird scale, instead of at the global scale. The second set of damage functions incorporates the temporal dynamics of climate impacts and, for large changes in climate, can produce damages that are consistent in magnitude with those that can be obtained from some of the highly nonlinear functions that have been proposed in the literature. Recognizing that the estimates of economic impacts alone would hardly provide an adequate representation of the risks of climate change, CLIMRISK integrates a variety of climate, socioeconomic and damage projections to produce uni- and multivariate, dynamic risk measures that are defined by the user. The model focuses on offering decision-makers tailor-made information that can help evaluating climate policy options and developing dynamic risk-management planning.\n\nAggregation of biophysical climate impacts with multi-sector economic models\n\nHermann Lotze-Campen (Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Germany)\n\nOver the last years, the understanding and wealth of scenario data on biophysical climate impacts in different sectors has constantly grown. ISIMIP is one prominent example, where climate impacts are now compared in a multi-model setting and a systematic scenario design, to create a clearer picture of the comprehensive future changes to be expected in many sectors in a changing climate. However, so far there have been only limited attempts to assess the consequences of climate change for the overall economy and social welfare. Multi-sector economy models are appropriate tools to use a multitude of sector-specific exogenous shocks, in order to assess the interactions across sectors and generate net effects on overall economic output and welfare. Multi-sector models, especially computable general equilibrium (CGE) models, are available at sub-national, national and global scale. However, a number of challenges have to be overcome to assess the true economic costs of climate change. CGE models are usually formulated in economic value terms, and it is not always straightforward to provide the direct linkages to key biophysical processes, e.g. with respect to water and land use. The spatial aggregation in administrative units may be inappropriate for picking up climate impacts at more disaggregated spatial scales. Many multi-sector economic models are used in a comparative static mode, not explicitly capturing key economic dynamics over time. Especially the long-term effects on economic growth are difficult to capture, while at the same time maintaining sufficient sector-specific detail. Capturing effects on income distribution and inequality remains another important challenge. Some of these aspects may be covered by partial-equilibrium sector models with a stronger biophysical base, e.g. in agriculture, while the more aggregate economic dynamics is the domain of specific growth models. The complementarity of these modelling approaches should be better explored.\n\nEconomic impacts from natural disasters in a changing climate\n\nWouter Botzen (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands)\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nEconomic losses from natural disasters have been increasing during the last decades. This observed trend has been mainly attributed to socio-economic developments, like population and economic growth in disaster-prone areas. Future impacts from natural disasters are expected to rise in many regions around the world due to a continued increase in economic exposure and climate change. This highlights the need for policy makers to design policies that can mitigate the consequences of these disasters on the economy and society. A rapidly expanding literature has estimated the direct (e.g., property damage) and indirect economic impacts (e.g., GDP growth, regional development, trade) of natural disasters and how these may change under climate change. This talk as panelist discusses this emerging literature on both direct and indirect economic impacts of natural disasters to synthesize the main empirical and computational methods used and key findings to date. The latter include results of both economic impacts of different kinds of natural disasters and observed factors that mitigate disaster impacts. The discussed insights draw from macroeconomic models used to simulate impacts from natural disasters, including input-output models, computable general equilibrium models, and economic integrated assessment models. Moreover, main insights from the empirical literature are discussed such as main findings per disaster type and mitigating factors. The talk aims at drawing lessons for policy makers and outlining an agenda for future research in this field.\n\nIntegrated Assessment of Climate Change Impacts Using Economic Models: Recent Trends, Neglected Areas and Research Opportunities\n\nIan Sue Wing (Boston University, United States)\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nThe burgeoning literature on economic modeling of the impacts of climate change considers multiple categories of impacts spanning a range of sectors. Drawing on the framework in Sue Wing and Lanzi (2014), this presentation will outline developments in sectoral and geographic scope, and the character of impact endpoints, assessed by recent economic simulation studies. Five major categories of impacts that have thus far been lacking in integrated assessment studies will then be addressed: extreme weather events that are geographically localized and of relatively short duration, inter- and intra-national migration, sub-clinical health effects and labor productivity, and non-market goods such as climate or landscape amenities and ecosystem services. For each category, the presentation will consider the spatial scale of analysis, the range of meteorological precursors and the ability of earth system models to resolve them, the empirical basis for translating impacts on biogeophysical variables into shocks into economic activities, and the promise and pitfalls of different options for connecting these shocks to models’ stylized representations of producer and consumer behavior.\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nWe intend to assess the linkage between past, current and future levels of (cumulative) greenhouse gas emissions and current and anticipated damages to coastal Bangladesh as a vulnerable delta region which undergoes the adverse effect of climate change in the form of fast onsets (flood, storm, tropical cyclones) and slow onsets (drought, sea level rise, hydro-morphological change, salinity intrusion) events. Estimation shows that during 1992 to 2012 overall 242 extreme events assault Bangladesh with total losses of USD 1833 million. In 2009, cyclone Sidr alone claimed 4,234 lives, damaged 186892 hectares crops and caused US$1.67 billion worth of economic loss in the coastal areas. The historical warming of 1°C across Bangladesh is associated with 10% productivity loss in farming, indicates 4 million tons of food grain loss in Bangladesh, amounting to about USD 2.5 billion which is about 2% of current countries GDP. Here we apply a Regional Climate Model (RCM) to project future impacts under 2°C of global warming based on present-day management. In such a scenario salinity levels are expected to increase in most of the river basin of coastal Bangladesh and the period of salinity level above 1PPT is expected to double in Atharobanki, Baleswar and Madumati Rivers. Further, we adopted marginal productivity method to estimate the costs of adaptation measures to avoid these damages. They are estimated to reach USD 3663, 232, 831, and 3663 respectively for Saline Resistant Rice Variety, Rice-Prawn Farming, Short Duration Rice, and Land Management. Here, the share of adaptation cost on total production expenditure is estimated 4%, 10.43%, 1% and 18% for such measures. In order to reduce the loss and damages and increase the community resilience under 2°C global warming emphasize should be given on adaptation finance and innovation for the vulnerable group.\n\nCo-authors: Gabriele Dono, Raffaele Cortignani, Dell'Unto Davide, Paola Deligios, Luca Doro, Nicola Lacetera, Laura Mula, Andrea Vitali, Pier Paolo Roggero\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nWe present a crop and a livestock model for the Mediterranean region as a tool to 1) separate the effects of climate variability from the effects of variations in human management across the historical period and 2) estimate productive responses and economic costs to climate change in the near term 2020-2030.\n\nTo this end we demonstrate the ability of the models to reproduce the effects of inter-annual climate variability in a diversified farming district that represents a wide range of rainfed and irrigated agricultural systems. The effects of near-term climate change on productivity are estimated based on calibrated climate scenarios for the period 2000-2010 and 2020-2030. The research focusses impacts of gradual climate change, leaving aside the role of extreme weather events which destroy the production cycles, rather than altering them.\n\nBased on the projected changes in productivity a discrete stochastic programming (DSP) model also allows for estimating the economic impact of climate change on net income. The DSP model is structured into blocks each of which represents one of the farm types that operate in the study area. Each type has specific resources endowments, decision-making constraints and, therefore, specific economic responses to simulated climatic conditions. The adopted modelling strategy also takes into account the possibility and costs of adaptation and remaining changes in productivity after such measures are taken.\n\nA crucial element of differentiation was water availability, since only irrigated C3 crops took full advantage from the fertilization effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration. Rainfed crop production is projected to be depressed by the expected reduction of spring rainfall associated to the higher temperatures. So, a dualism emerges between the smaller impact on crop production in the irrigated plain sub-zone, equipped with collective water networks and abundant irrigation resources, and the major negative impact in the hilly area, where these facilities and resources are absent. Intensive dairy farming is also expected to be negatively affected in terms of milk production and quality, and cattle mortality because of the increasing summer temperatures. We exemplarily estimate the economic effect of a positive anomaly of about 1°C on annual average and monthly mean peaks well above that threshold in summer.\n\nThe interdisciplinary modeling approach adopted for this study allows for the integrated assessment of the expected impacts of climate change over a wide range of farming systems under Mediterranean conditions.\n\nCo-authors: Wojciech Szewczyk, Luc Feyen, other JRC and HELIX colleagues\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nThe HELIX project has explored the biophysical and economic implications of climate change at the global scale for high-end emission scenarios. In particular, a set of climate futures consistent with the RCP8.5 have been studied with a series of climate impact models. High resolution bottom-up models (covering impacts such as river floods, agriculture, coastal areas, energy and transport infrastructure) have been run to derive biophysical impacts. An economic framework based on the computable general equilibrium methodology has been employed to integrate the various impacts under a consistent setting.\n\nThe presentation will discuss the main methodological aspects and results from the two phases in the economic analysis of the project. Particular attention will be paid to the differences between the bottom-up approach and the alternative statistical, top-down approach. Regarding the study results, firstly, the ISI-MIP fast track climate impacts (covering agriculture and river floods) will be presented. In a second part, the HELIX climate scenarios have been used to explore the implications in agriculture, river floods, coasts, energy, transport and human health.\n\nThe presentation will conclude with a series of possible research priorities in the economic analysis of climate impacts. Aspects like the difficulty in the economic modelling of adaptation, the sensitivity of the results to key CGE model assumptions and how to model non-market impacts will be considered.\n\nCo-authors: Michael Greenstone, Solomon Hsiang, Amir Jina, Robert Kopp, Ishan Nath, James Rising, Ashwin Rode, Samuel Seo, Arvid Viaene, Jiacan Yuan, Alice Zhang\n\nEmpirically-based and plausibly causal estimates of the damages of climate change are greatly needed to inform rapidly developing global and local climate policies. To accurately reflect the costs of climate change, it is essential to estimate how much populations will adapt to a changing climate, yet adaptation remains one of the least understood aspects of social responses to climate. In this paper, we develop and implement a novel methodology to estimate climate damages globally which paves the way for the first data-driven, global social cost of carbon in which adaptation and its costs are empirically identified. We apply this method to mortality --- likely to be one of the largest losses associated with climate change. We assemble comprehensive sub-national panel data on mortality in 41countries that account for 56% of the world's population, and combine them with high resolution daily climate data to flexibly estimate the causal effect of temperature on mortality. Consistent with previous studies, we find the impacts of temperature on mortality have a U-shaped response; both hot days and cold days cause excess mortality. However, this average response obscures substantial heterogeneity, as populations are differentially adapted to extreme temperatures. We derive spatio-temporally heterogeneous mortality-temperature response functions to build a high-resolution model of adaptation in which incomes and average climate determine the sensitivity of mortality rates to changes in the climate. This model allows us to extrapolate response functions across the entire globe, as well as across time, using a range of economic, population, and climate change scenarios. Importantly, we develop and apply a revealed preference methodology to capture not only the benefits of adaptation, but also its costs. We combine these innovations to produce the first causal, micro-founded, global, empirically-derived climate damage function for human health. We project that by 2100, business-as-usual climate change is likely to incur mortality-only costs that amount to approximately 5% of global GDP for 5°C degrees of warming above pre-industrial levels. On average across model runs, we estimate that the upper bound on adaptation costs amounts to 55% of the total damages, a value that has never been estimated in the existing literature.\n\nCo-authors: T.

A rich body of studies on climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability (CCIAV) quantifies these sensitivities for selected scenarios in sectoral and in some cases also cross-sectoral studies. Some attempts have also been made to quantify future changes of climate probabilistically and, more rarely, of socio-economic variables, but these have seldom been used in impact assessments. Here, we use a synthetic and scenario-neutral approach, impact response surfaces (IRSs), with a number of CCIAV models that illustrate a range of sectors, to address the questions: 1) What sectors and regions in Europe are most sensitive to future climate and socio-economic change and 2) how large are the risks of crossing critical impact thresholds?\n\nA suite of nine global and regional CCIAV models has been employed to simulate the impacts of climate change on selected sectors (health, agriculture, biodiversity, forestry, hydrology and coastal flooding) in Europe. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for these models to assess changes in key climate and socio-economic variables such that two variables were modified at a time. The changes also included those implied by high-end scenarios that may lie outside the conventional application of many models. The variables modified were temperature and precipitation, sea-level rise, population, GDP, technological change and land use. Impact results were aggregated to eight European sub-regions and plotted as IRSs that depict the simulated behaviour of an impact variable in response to changes in two key explanatory variables. For selected impact variables and regions, these were overlaid with probabilistic projections of climate and population changes that enabled a quantified risk assessment.\n\nResults clearly indicate substantial increases or decreases for different parts of each IRS. A key benefit of the IRS approach is its systematic way of analysing the sensitivities of modelled impacts. It also provides an opportunity to test model performance across a wide range of conditions, including those found at the high-end of projected changes. Examples are shown for estimating impact risks by combining the IRSs with probabilistic climate change and population projections.\n\nCo-authors: Parkinson Simon, Burek Peter, Satoh Yusuke, Langan Simon, Wada Yoshihide\n\nGlobal water withdrawals for beneficial purposes have been increasing substantially in the last century, driven by the growth in population and income. The ensuing damages have been building up rapidly during recent years, with many basins around the world undergoing pervasive water scarcity conditions. Moreover, impacts of future climatic and socio-economic changes are projected to further exacerbate supply deficit in those basins. Therefore, the design of adaptation strategies to address future water challenges is needed. This task requires quantitative tools for planning and policy evaluation that integrate various metrics, reflecting decision-making objectives and processes. This study presents a global hydro-economic modeling framework newly developed at IIASA that represents water resource systems, management options and associated economic values in an integrated manner. The model incorporates an optimization procedure aimed at balancing demand and supply of water at the level of large-scale river basins worldwide. The model uses information on water demand and availability provided by existing global integrated assessment models and global hydrological models. In this study, the model is used to evaluate the effects of reduced water availability under future climate change scenarios. The model is applied to basins in Africa which provides a challenging case study. However, the modeling framework is designed to be adaptable for any basin elsewhere. Model results show the economic and environmental tradeoffs among the different adaptation policy choices and the hurdles facing these policies. Specifically, our results suggest that addressing the challenge of adaptation to growing water scarcity in Africa will require major investments in more efficient water use technologies and unconventional freshwater supply options, such as wastewater recycling and desalination, with potential consequences on water supply costs, energy use and carbon emissions.\n\nCo-authors: Jun’ya Takakura, Tomoko Hasegawa, Kiyoshi Takahashi, Yasuaki Hijioka\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nThe Paris Agreement defines a long-term temperature goal for international climate policy: “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels”. Yet, still short-term policy known as NDC (Nationally Determined Contribution) is insufficient to achieve 2°C and long-term policy implementation is uncertain (e.g. US secession from Paris Agreement) and it is still highly important to understand climate change impact when the mitigation stagnates or fails. Accordingly, we launched a project named MiLAi (http://s-14.iis.u-tokyo.ac.jp/eng/) aiming at projecting an aggregated economic impact by using individual sectors estimates. In order to do that, we incorporate physical models and an economic model (AIM/CGE; Asian-Pacific Integrated Model /Computable General Equilibrium). We have quantified the impacts of 5 out of 9 sectors, so far and we did it by using five climate models provided by ISIMIP. The aggregated impact is -3.6% of GDP in 2100 under SSP2 (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway) / RCP8.5(Representative Concentration Pathways). The largest contributor is labor productivity loss which accounts for -2.6%. In contrast, the GDP change becomes -0.67% under RCP2.6. This impact depends strongly on socioeconomic assumptions and under RCP8.5, the impact has a range from -2.8 to -7.3% of GDP which are represented by SSP1 and SSP3. Compared with mitigation cost (about 2-4%), climate change impact cost is equivalent and it indicates that taking mitigation action is reasonable. Moreover, socioeconomic development is fundamental to the climate change cost and considering the risk of failing the climate mitigation, socioeconomic transition toward SSP1 like the world is desired.\n\nCo-authors: Carl-Friedrich Schleussner, Reik V.

Although each conflict is the result of an individual context-specific mixture of interconnected factors, ethnicity appears to play a prominent and almost ubiquitous role in many of them. This overall state of affairs is likely to be exacerbated by anthropogenic climate change and in particular climate-related natural disasters. Ethnic divides might serve as predetermined conflict lines in case of rapidly emerging societal tensions arising from disruptive events like natural disasters. Here, we hypothesize that climate-related disaster occurrence enhances armed-conflict outbreak risk in ethnically fractionalized countries. Using event coincidence analysis, we test this hypothesis based on data on armed-conflict outbreaks and climate-related natural disasters for the period 1980–2010. Globally, we find a coincidence rate of 9% regarding armed-conflict outbreak and disaster occurrence such as heat waves or droughts. Our analysis also reveals that, during the period in question, about 23% of conflict outbreaks in ethnically highly fractionalized countries robustly coincide with climatic calamities. Although we do not report evidence that climate-related disasters act as direct triggers of armed conflicts, the disruptive nature of these events seems to play out in ethnically fractionalized societies in a particularly tragic way. This observation has important implications for future security policies as several of the world’s most conflict-prone regions, including North and Central Africa as well as Central Asia, are both exceptionally vulnerable to anthropogenic climate change and characterized by deep ethnic divides.\n\nCo-authors: Uris Baldos, Frances Moore\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nThe climate impacts literature has emphasized the importance role of geography to climate impacts. Pattern scaling of the consequences of global warming for regional temperature and precipitation suggests that yield effects of a given level of global average warming are larger in places that are already hot, and continental interior and higher latitudes where local warming is larger. In addition, net importing and net exporting regions are expected to experience very different welfare consequences from higher food prices. However, this literature has not come to grips with the true geography of international agricultural trade, which is characterized by surprisingly rigid bilateral trade relationships stemming from proximity, transport costs, colonial relationships, common language and other geopolitical considerations. In this paper, we utilize the meta-analysis function recently published by Moore et al. (2017) to characterize global gridded climate impacts for corn, soybeans, wheat and rice in the presence of a 2 degrees C temperature increase. Yield impacts are incorporated into the GTAP model of global trade in order to evaluate the welfare impacts on 140 countries/regions. Impacts are decomposed into five components: direct, allocative efficiency, world price, export, and import-specific effects. The first three have been well-covered in the literature, but abstract from bilateral trade relationships. The latter two effects reflect the correlations between a country’s trading partners and the pattern of climate impacts. Countries which rely on imports from those regions adversely affected by climate change experience greater than average welfare losses, whereas countries exporting to these hard-hit regions benefit from increased market access. Our results characterize the interplay between geographically differentiated climate impacts on agriculture and the bilateral pattern of agricultural trade that ultimately determines the welfare effects of climate change.\n\nCo-authors: Justin S. Baker, Petr Havlík, Robert Beach, David Leclère, Erwin Schmid, Hugo Valin\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nPrevious climate change impact assessments of the domestic agricultural sector have relied in part on domestic partial equilibrium models of the agriculture and other land use sectors. While such models often provide substantial detail on domestic production systems needed for climate impact assessments, these tools typically hold agricultural supply functions fixed in the rest of the world. Thus, even with endogenous trade flows, domestic partial equilibrium models ignore potential systemic productivity changes globally under assumed climate change scenarios. Country-scale assessments that do not explicitly account for global market interactions or adjust future productivity assumptions in the rest of the world to account for climate change can result in biased projections of domestic climate change impacts. These studies also explicitly focus on the adaptation issue rather from the producers than consumers perspective.\n\nTo evaluate the potential limitation of country-scale climate impact assessments, this study applies a global model of agriculture and forestry to evaluate climate change impacts on U.S. agriculture with and without accounting for climate change impacts in the rest of the world. To this team’s knowledge, this is the first attempt to quantify the relative difference in U.S. agricultural sector climate change impacts with and without directly accounting for climate change in the rest of the world. This is accomplished through a unique scenario design that first isolates several climate change scenarios and exogenous crop yield impacts to the U.S. only, followed by scenarios that extend the climate impacts to the rest of the world. Then, additional sensitivity analysis is conducted in which global agricultural trade is more rapidly liberalized, which provides a buffer against domestic productivity shocks brought on by climate change. This manuscript focuses on U.S. results to illustrate the potential importance of accounting for global climate impacts when projecting domestic impacts.\n\nCo-authors: Matt Gidden, Petr Havlik, Volker Krey, Simon Langan, Simon Parkinson, Keywan Riahi, Joeri Rogelj, Yoshi Wada\n\nThe Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) provide a framework and projections for assessing scenarios of socioeconomic change alongside climate impacts and options for mitigation and adaptation. The development of spatial socioeconomic datasets now facilitates impacts and vulnerability assessment from climate impact models. We calculate a set of climate impact indicators covering water, energy and land sectors (e.g. changes in runoff, discharge and water scarcity, cropland change and biodiversity, energy demand change and heatwave frequency) from an ensemble of global and climate and hydrological impact models (ISIMIP). These are combined with novel spatial socioeconomic datasets of population, urbanization, income distribution and wealth projections, to investigate multiple climate impacts on the world’s poorest populations. Using policy relevant scenarios of 1.5°C, 2.0°C and 3.0°C and the 5 SSPs, we identify hotspots of vulnerable populations to climate impacts. This combination of scenarios enables us to decompose the differences between the socioeconomic and climate projections to understand the dominant drivers of vulnerability to multiple climate impacts. Threshold approaches and use of spatial data allows for novel presentation of critical hotspots and how the severity and spatial extents change with time. We then aggregate these results at relevant decision-making scales, such as country- and river basin-level, whilst the multi-model approach enables measures of model uncertainty to be incorporated into the analysis. In the near term, we find that for the majority of locations the difference between 1.5°C and 2.0°C is small and equivalent to (and sometimes outweighed) by uncertainty between different socioeconomic projections. Climate impacts at 3°C are spatially extensive and more severe, impacting larger populations and subsequently more sensitive to socioeconomic projections. The combination of these approaches to identify multi-impact vulnerabilities and multi-sector vulnerabilities not only allows crucial identification of the most critical areas, but paves the way towards joint and cost-effective adaptation across sectors.\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nHydrologic extremes are among the world’s most dangerous and costly natural hazards. Over recent decades, flood losses resulted globally in more than $1 trillion damages whilst making at least 220,000 fatalities. Droughts, on the other hand, can lead to widespread food and water crises. The recent Somalian drought led to more than 700,000 drought related displacements and put over 6.2 million people in need of humanitarian assistance.\n\nEfforts to reduce the risks of such hydrologic extremes are essential and are key for today’s global policy agenda. Compound events - when the combination of two or more hazardous events or climate variables lead to an extreme impact - do not align neatly with traditional categories of extremes or methodologies to assess risk, are have been therefore often overlooked in global policy making. Compound events can have a multiplier effect on the risk to society, the environment and built infrastructure, though. Hence, preparedness to compound events is critical and has been identified as an important challenge by the World Climate Research Programme Grand Challenge on Extremes.\n\nIn this contribution we highlight the importance of compound events in water-related risk assessments, using recent real-world examples. Moreover, we discuss the challenges that lie ahead to improve the understanding, the ability to simulate and attribute, and the preparedness for these high impact events.\n\nCo-authors: Gen Sakurai, Shinichiro Fujimori, Kiyoshi Takahashi, Yasuaki Hijioka, Toshihiko Masui\n\nFuture climate variability is a concern for food security. Although the uncertainty of food security under the mean climate state has been quantified in numerous studies, variability has rarely been considered. Here, we show how projections of the risk of hunger are affected by potential changes in crop yields under climate variability and other major uncertainties expected to occur by the middle of this century. The results suggest that the magnitude of uncertainty increases over time regardless of socioeconomic developments. In 2050, under a once-per-100-year extreme case under the most severe climate change pathway, an additional 0.07–0.32 billion people will face a risk of hunger, which accounts for 70-80% of the number under the mean climate state. The results also suggest that current global total food storage is quantitatively sufficient, but poorly distributed geographically. For example, a once-per-100-year extreme case under the most severe climate change scenario (RCP8.5) requires 2.2–2.3 EJ of food energy to keep the same consumption level as would be without extreme climates, which is equivalent to one-fourth of the current global cereal storage. However, the current food storage locations do not match the locations where food is needed under the extreme case. To fill this gap, a food aid system among countries or the promotion of food storage in affected regions is needed so that they can tolerate the worst case.\n\nCo-author: Luigi Nisini\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nOperational crop forecasts are gaining importance in a global climate characterized by increasingly variable weather and with commodity markets that are more interconnected. Forecasting crop yield can help anticipating fluctuations in expected production levels. We assess the quality and intra-seasonal development of common wheat yield forecasts during extreme impacts for 25 European Union (EU) Member States (MS) since 1993 performed by EC-JRC-MARS, evaluating 2450 intra-seasonal forecasts for 362 wheat forecast years. Median yielding years were forecasted accurately and forecast errors were below ~2% by July, while low and high-yielding years were respectively over (~10%) and underestimated (~8%). Forecast accuracy of high yielding years improved during the season as gradual processes beneficial for crop-growth were captured by the system. Four-fifths of the years with the lowest yield at MS level had a drought driver, while a third had a wet driver. In water-limited countries (e.g. Spain, Hungary), low yields due to drought were anticipated with significant lead times (~2 months), but still underestimated. Extreme events affecting yield during the later growing stages remain difficult to forecast. Synoptic weather patterns affecting multiple-countries in 2003, ’06, ’07, ’11 and 12’, led to wheat losses of up to 8.1 Mt. In these years, single events (e.g. drought in Latvia, Lithuania, Poland in 2006), contrasting successive in-season (e.g. dry and wet in Denmark, Estonia, Sweden, in 2011), as well as spatially distant dry and wet (dry in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and wet in Belgium, Netherlands, France, in 2007) extremes, contributed >40% to total EU losses. June and end-of-campaign production forecasts in these years underestimated losses respectively by 10.4 to 78.4 and 4.2 to 47.9%.\n\nCo-authors: Mike Rivingon, Keith Matthew, Mike Young, Geoff Squire\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nThe aim of this paper is to show how a barley yield forecast tool for Scotland is being built. We also highlight the challenge of gathering the input data and the availability of farmers’ data for further calibration/evaluation of the tool. Its planned use will span from a crop yield forecast, to an adaptation and mitigation tool to evaluate the impact of climate change in Scotland. This tool will be further expanded at global level for studying the impact of climate change on global barley production. To identify the barley growing areas the Land Capability Map for Agriculture was used and overlayed with the Scottish Soils Knowledge and Information Base in order to extract only the relevant soil types. The soil database has more than 1,000 soils for the whole Scotland. The soils that occur in the barley growing areas were 333, and these soils were described, for each soil depth to a maximum of 100 cm. Gridded daily weather data were obtained from the United Kingdom Meteorological Office, using the UKCP09: Gridded observation dataset. The Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) v 4.6 was utilised for modelling spring barley growth across Scotland. The model was calibrated for matching phenology (anthesis and maturity), and grain yield using barley variety trials information. The evaluation of the model was done using observed data from experimental farms, from published results of agronomic trials, from the Scottish Government National Statistics data, and by gathering detailed data from more than 100 farms from a North-South transect.\n\nCo-authors: Peter Hoffmann, Katja Frieler\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nThe economy of Morocco is highly dependent on fluctuations in wheat yield. Since very little of the Moroccan wheat harvest is irrigated, this leaves the annual wheat yield dependent on precipitation fluctuations and large scale weather patterns over the north Atlantic. Here we suggest two predictor systems of the annual change in Moroccan wheat yield based on these relationships. The first, pre-planting indicator relies on the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies of the north Atlantic in October through November and is reinforced by two mid-season predictors based on the weighted precipitation from October through February and March, respectively. Partial least squares regression is used to determine the three most relevant patterns of Atlantic SST which offer an early indication of the upcoming wheat yield. The prediction is challenged and enhanced by the inclusion of the cumulative monthly precipitation weighted by the wheat cultivation areas, from October through the wheat harvest. It is not surprising that the total precipitation in Morocco influences the annual wheat yield, however it is remarkable the degree to which SST and early season precipitation sums are able to forecast the national wheat yield.\n\nCo-authors: Wu Bingfang, Zeng Hongwei, Zhang Miao\n\nCrop aboveground biomass (AGB) is an essential parameter for crop yield estimation in the global agriculture remote sensing community. The reliable estimation of crop aboveground biomass (AGB) during the growing season would improve planning, managing grain production, handling the grain, and marketing. Previous research has mainly focused on various vegetation indices (Vis) to estimate crop AGB for large spatial and temporal applications, and these Vis include the normalized difference VI (NDVI), wide dynamic range VI (WDRVI), transformed soil-adjusted VI (TSAVI), enhanced VI (EVI), and SAVI, which rely on multi-band reflectance values with limited angle information. However, multi-angle remote sensing can provide three-dimensional geometric structure information about crops, which is directly related to crop AGB. The surface and volume scattering components of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) shape constitute one of the main multi-angle information sources. Based on its physical definition, the BRDF is thought to be sensitive to dynamic crop geometric structure during all growing stages. Thus, the relationship between new multi-angle-based indices from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MCD43 BRDF parameter data from different bands and the various field crop AGB was determined at various field sites using highly periodical field observations. The aim was to acquire different geometric factors for correlation with the field crop AGB to find out the appropriate band, crop type and parameter combination manner to estimate crop AGB at a global level. The proposed method will provide new solutions for estimating crop AGB via multi-angle remote sensing and are expected to have potential applications for crop yield monitoring and forecasting. Finally, a preliminary crop yield estimation result based on Biomass-Harvest Index Model will also be provided.\n\nCo-author: Tamara Ben-Ari\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nThe principle of weather index crop insurance is to pay an indemnity to farmers as a function of some weather index. A pre-selected weather index (I) is used as a proxy for yield loss, and a payout is triggered when the value of I is lower that an index threshold, i.e. the strike (S). The choice of S is critical because its value influences the performance of the insurance system. The use of an inappropriate strike level may lead to a payout in the absence of yield loss, or to an absence of payout in case of yield loss. The first type of error (false positive) increases costs for the insurance company, while the second type of error (false negative) increases the basis risk of farmers. A difficulty is that the optimal value of S may depend both on the chosen weather index and on local characteristics (e.g., soil type, farmers practices). The optimal S value may also vary across time under the influence of climate change. There is thus a need for an operational method able to optimize the strike levels. Here, we describe a statistical method for optimizing the weather index threshold S from yield time series. The principle is to fit a statistical model relating the weather index I to a variable reflecting occurrences/non occurrences of yield loss. The fitted model is then used to compute the probabilities of true positive (payout in case of yield loss) and of true negative (no payout in case of absence of yield loss) across space and time. We show how the computed true positive and negative probabilities can be used to determine optimal values of S. The proposed method is illustrated in several examples involving different type of indices and different crops.\n\nCo-authors: Julien Boé, Philippe Ciais, Rémi Lecerf, Marijin Van Der Velde, David Makowski\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nIn 2016, French wheat production suffered its most extreme loss in over half a century. In many counties of the French breadbasket, these losses exceeded 50%. France is the first wheat producer in Europe - despite limited agricultural space: the region affected by severe loss in 2016 usually produces as much wheat as Ukraine or Australia.This event, combined with other severe losses in neighboring countries (e.g., Belgium, the UK), thus had repercussions in the European Union and the Mediterranean basin.\n\nEarly warning systems failed to anticipate the spread or the magnitude of this event. Yet, there has not been any quantitative study characterizing the precise climatic conditions that led to this extreme yield loss or developing an understanding of why yield forecasts failed by such a large amount in 2016. Our study is dedicated to the understanding of the causes and implications of this extreme yield loss.\n\nDuring the 2015-2016 growing season, climate was exceptional but it was not a ‘usual’ drought and heat wave known to reduce yields. Rather, 2015-2016 is a unique compound extreme with both very warm conditions in the late fall and record high precipitation in the spring. A statistical model that accounts for these two variables is capable of estimating high risk of yield loss in 2016 together with increased probability of yield losses for other key loss events since 1959. Based on climate projections, we show that the bivariate conditions that led to the 2016 wheat yield loss will become more frequent in the future.\n\nThe increased likelihood of such compound event poses a challenge not only for current yields forecasting systems but also for wheat production adaptation pathways in temperate regions.\n\nCo-authors: Laura M.

Because semi-arid desert regions experience the widest range in ambient temperature (-2 to 42°C), intra- and inter-annual variations in temperature provides a cost effective means to assess thermal response of multiple cereal grain crops simultaneously. To refine our understanding and assess Genotype by Environment by Management (GxExM) interactions, we staggered our planting dates, from the normal cropping season in December, to be in closer intervals during the April-June time frame. We used day-neutral cultivars without any vernalization requirement to negate any photoperiod effects and ensure floral induction regardless of planting date. Our objectives were: (1) determine cereal grain crop responses to a wide range of air temperature; (2) quantify crop growth; (3) evaluate and refine thermal response on crop growth and development; (4) validate crop growth models with regard to thermal dependent processes believed to be mediated through canopy energy balance. Our materials of study included: Wheat (Tritium aestivum L.); Durum Wheat (T. durum L.); Barley (Hordeum vulgare L.); and Triticale (xTriticumSecale) WheatxRye. These four crops were planted, in four replicates, over five and eight dates (April to June) during 2016 and 2017, respectively. Hence, differently treated crop responses were assessed across a wide range in air temperature. Preliminary results will be discussed in the context of how they will impact our understanding of global climate uncertainty and how to develop adaptation and mitigation strategies that ensure global food security.\n\nCo-author: Brenda Mwalukanga\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nAfrican cities and towns are growing fast with large proportions of urban populations categorised as poor living and working informally. Urbanisation process in Africa has been occurring without a corresponding industrialisation and infrastructural development. There is urbanisation of poverty and concentration of climate related disaster risks. Further, in African cities, municipal decision making and urban management systems are weak and are based on non-robust climate information and scientific evidence. Thus, many people who work and live informally in African cities are more vulnerable to climate change shocks which in Lusaka typically include floods and droughts. New climate knowledge production methodologies are needed to bridge the gap between climate science and local government policy officials and systems to ensure climate science guides decisions for protecting vulnerable urban residents in African cities. In Lusaka, climate scientists, urban development researchers, decision makers and city residents are collaborating in a transdisciplinary project to ensure increased uptake of climate information in decision making at the city-region scale. The project is called Future Resilience of African Cities and Lands (FRACTAL) where innovative research and learning initiatives are being implemented to ensure a water secure future for all in Lusaka. In this research project, stakeholders have identified water insecurity (urban flooding and water rationing) as a climate change ‘burning issue’ affecting over 60% of residents in Lusaka who live and work in slums. This paper uses discourse analysis to examine how knowledge production innovations in the Fractal project are bridging the gap between climate scientists and development policy actors in the City of Lusaka to ensure development decisions are climate sensitive and inclusive for the next 10-40 years. The paper explores how the project actors are pioneering integrated climate research to ensure Lusaka City Council engages in decision-making processes that safeguard livelihoods and health of vulnerable City residents from climate related shocks in the water sector.\n\nCo-authors: Harald A.

The resulting alterations affect daily lives and routines as well as future plans of the local population. Nevertheless, the agency of local stakeholders in decisions on how to adapt to climate-related environmental changes has been largely underappreciated in the climate change sciences as well as in policy decisions. We, therefore, conducted a survey study in three representative PSIS (Tuvalu, Samoa, and Tonga), asking specifically how residents perceive their situation regarding climate-related challenges, what adaptation strategies they have devised and implemented, and what they expect of governmental and nongovernmental organizations in these efforts. In contrast to the common perception that PSIS are primarily threatened by rising sea levels, residents’ perceptions indicate that drought, cyclones and other flood-related problems pose a fare more imminent danger. Consequently, current coping strategies of private households involve mainly water management, planting, repairing and preparing houses and private property, waste management, and improving one’s own financial situation. In addition to that, future plans of those affected by flooding and erosion include moving inland and finding land to resettle. People’s expectations of the government and NGOs relate predominantly to funding, technical assistance, supply of materials, raising awareness, the enforcement of policies, as well as providing spiritual and practical support. The results of the study will be discussed in the context of non-economic loss and damage with a specific emphasis on communal sites and meaningful places, ecosystem services, health (including mental health), as well as potential implications for local identity, values, future development, and sustainability. Our findings suggest that further research on the perceived environmental changes as well as resulting local adaptation strategies is advisable to provide reliable data for scientific models and policy decisions.\n\nCo-authors: Jing Liu-Helmersson, Mikkel Quam, Åke Brännström\n\nAedes aegypti has become a major public health concern. It is the vector to transmit many viral infectious diseases including dengue fever, yellow fever, chikungunya and zika. Climate change and globalization in travel and trade have made positive impact on the spread of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes to new areas where people have no immunity. It is important for us to know where this vector can establish itself once being introduced. So far, we have limited understanding on the effect of climate on establishment potential of Aedes aegypti for non-tropical areas. This study aims to estimate establishment potential in Europe.\n\nTherefore, we suggest that efforts should be enhanced to reduce the risk of introduction of the vector during the spring and summer seasons.\n\nMethods: Mathematical modelling was used to estimate potential for the vector establishment – growth rate r once they are introduced in a non infected area in Europe. A three-stage compartment model were developed to model the mosquito’s lifecycle - Eggs, Larva, Pupa and Female Adults in relation to variability and trends in meteorological conditions. Vector parameters include influences from rainfall and temperature. Climate change projections were established using the ISIMIP database.\n\nResults: Currently the risk for establishment is limited in Europe - only certain southern European cities and Madeira experience weather conditions that Aedes aegypti can proliferate in already today. With climate change, particularly for high emission scenarios at the end of the 21th century the risk for establishment of the Aedes aegypti increased substantially.\n\nConclusion: If climate change is not controlled, and as travel and globalization becomes more frequent channels for dengue vector and virus introduction, Europe may face the reality of more frequent dengue outbreaks in areas already at risk and invasion of Aedes aegypti in the south of Europe causing risks of outbreaks of epidemic proportions.\n\nCo-authors: Pham Thi Thanh Nga, Vu Duoc\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nThe research utilizes geospatial data and applies the WADI approach developed by Dickin et al. (2013) to map change of vulnerability to dengue for 13 provinces in the Mekong delta region (MDR) of Vietnam from 2002 to 2014. A range of datasets for climate variables, land cover, demographics and socio-economics were standardized and integrated into indicators of exposure and susceptibility based on the WADI approach’s existing framework and thresholds. Annual land cover and monthly precipitation were extracted from the MODIS global land cover product and GSMaP data respectively. The Pearson correlation was used to evaluate the associations between dengue rates and vulnerability values aggregated at the province level. Significant linear associations with correlation coefficient greater than 0.5 were found in most of the provinces. The produced maps help in analyzing spatial-temporal dynamic patterns of vulnerability to dengue in the region. From 2002, the vulnerability increased and reached a peak in 2008 with high and very high values observed for all provinces. Nine provinces, where the Mekong River flows through, are more vulnerable to dengue than other provinces.\n\nFor the first time in the MDR dynamic maps of vulnerability to dengue are shown to be an effective means of geospatial technology utilization to support local and regional public health authorities in disease control and intervention. The study suggests that changes in environmental, social and climate factors contribute to vulnerability to dengue in the MDR.

The causal toxins, the CTXs, bio-accumulate through the food chain from small herbivorous fish feeding on the coral reefs into larger-sized carnivorous fish that prey upon them. Humans get infected by consuming these contaminated fish, with symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tingling, and muscle pain, lasting from several hours to several months.\n\nThough once endemic only to small islands in tropical and subtropical areas, ciguatera has increasingly become a global human health issue. Climate change as well as its related events have been commonly hypothesized to lead to a wider presence of harmful algal blooms, hence higher risk of the disease.\n\nExisting studies assessing the relationship between climate change and CFP are very limited. Most of them have failed to control for external factors affecting CFP incidences, such as tourism and international trade. French Polynesia is the most ideal for being selected as a case study because, (1) ciguatera is highly endemic to French Polynesia, with an average incidence rate of 16.5/10,000 people in the last decade, and despite being underreported universally, CFP cases in French Polynesia are more likely to be reported and diagnosed; (2) People consume fish caught locally. This can exclude most external factors mentioned above.\n\nUtilizing the epidemiological data from 2007 to 2016, and climate data obtained from Climate Data Library, we performed a time-series analysis to assess the relationships between the monthly CFP incidence and climate-related indicators including sea surface temperature (SST), precipitation, cyclones, water salinity and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events in French Polynesia. Results reveal the significant time-lagged associations between climate variables including SST anomalies, maximum SST, precipitation anomalies and ENSO indices, and the monthly CFP incidence. If this data is confirmed, this delay will allow health authorities and the general public to take appropriate actions, to avoid/limit an epidemic risk, especially on high-risk climate scenarios.\n\nHowever, the public health impact of CFP is underestimated due to under-reporting, under-diagnosis, and lack of public awareness of the disease. With the burden of climate change, CFP is projected to pose significant threats to more and more previously non-endemic communities. Efforts should be concentrated on monitoring and control at national and international levels, raising awareness about public health implications of CFP, and implementation of food safety risk assessments in affected regions. Moreover, additional long-term prospective studies, relying on complementary disciplines, are needed in order to confirm and complete our findings. They would require a detailed follow-up of meteorological, epidemiological, ecological and sociological data at a global scale.\n\nCo-authors: Luís Costa, Carsten Walther, Boris F.

Kropp\n\nAssessing the onset of excess mortality from heat is of particular interest for climate impact studies because it allows to infer the temperature above which the capacity of a city’s population to cope with heat is exhausted. Such threshold temperatures for excess mortality are given only sporadically, mostly for cities, on case study basis and usually for present-day climate conditions. This way, it is not feasible to deduce general statements from this location-specific information and it remains unclear at what city-specific temperatures future excess mortality will set in under conditions of climate change. To address these issues we elaborate a statistical model to estimate threshold temperatures for most geographic locations for the present and future climate. Estimated present-day threshold temperatures for more than 600 major European cities cover a range between 11 °C to 30 °C. When applying our model to the future (2051—2080), threshold temperatures are expected to increase in most cities, especially when using climate scenario RCP 8.5. The results for this scenario show extended \"hotspot\" areas in Southern and Southeastern Europe. For RCP 2.6 in comparison, which complies with the 2°C marker, these hotspot areas are smaller in number and size. Methodologically, our work is based on a meta-analysis of threshold temperatures given by epidemiological studies on heat-related mortality. Multivariate non-linear regression was used to identify relevant independent variables explaining the sample of threshold temperatures. Our work provides a novel and alternative method to derive threshold temperatures for excess mortality that does not require epidemiological records. This method can be applied to present and future climate data.\n\nCo-author: Francesco Sera\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nIn addition to other indirect pathways, climate change is expected to affect health by varying the exposure to non-optimal outdoor temperatures. However, the empirical quantification of this direct impact involves several methodological issues, which have not been systematically discussed in the literature. Here we provide a critical overview, illustrating practical steps and related methodological problems.\n\nProjections of temperature-related health burdens involve a series of steps. First, researchers need reliable estimates of location-specific exposure-response relationships, commonly obtained from observed data. These relationships are characterized by complex non-linear and delayed patterns, and alternative models can be applied, from simple linear-threshold to complex distributed lag non-linear parameterizations. Alongside, future temperature series must be projected by running climate models under various climate change scenarios. These modelled data must be calibrated with the observed series, and several bias-correction methods are available for this purpose, although little is known on their comparative performance. The health impact can then be projected, although this involves extrapolating the exposure-responses in temperature regions never observed, and separating heat/cold contributions. The associated uncertainty, arising from both exposure-response estimation and climate projections, must be quantified. Projections into the future can also account for adaptation, whose mechanisms are little known, together with demographic trends and other changes. Finally, several summary measures, such as total, heat/cold and net contributions can be defined, and the counterfactual comparisons and related interpretation are not always straightforward.\n\nAll these methodological problems, together with assumptions and limitations of alternative approaches, will be illustrated and discussed through explanatory examples of single and multi-city analyses, using data from London and from other locations in different regions of the world, respectively.\n\nThis overview will contribute to the definition of a structured methodological framework for projecting temperature-related health impacts under climate change, also clarifying limitations and future research directions.\n\nCo-authors: David M. Hondula, Aditi Bunker, Dolores Ibarreta, Junguo Liu, Xinxin Zhang, Rainer Sauerborn\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nPast climate change impact studies for temperature-related mortality have employed different methods to model statistically the potential for populations to adapt to a warming climate. The application of different methods makes it difficult to compare projections across studies because vastly different underlying assumptions are made about adaptation in each respective study. Here we address the longstanding requirement for a comprehensive and systematic comparison of the sensitivity of impacts to each adaptation modelling method. Furthermore, we quantify the relative sensitivity of heat-related mortality impacts to three key sources of uncertainty: climate model uncertainty, emissions uncertainty and “adaptation uncertainty” (i.e. the inclusion/exclusion of adaptation modelling). We compare the effect of employing six different statistical adaptation modelling methods on projected impacts in 2070-2099, for 14 European cities. The methods compared include shifting the threshold temperature, reducing the gradient of the exposure-response function, a combination of the previous two, and the analogue city method. Heat-related mortality impacts are estimated with climate projections from five climate models, run under two emissions scenarios to explore the relative effects of climate modelling and emissions uncertainty. An important finding that contextualises the results from previous studies, particularly those that have not considered adaptation, is that adaptation can be a greater source of uncertainty than emissions and climate modelling uncertainty. Moreover, the inclusion/exclusion of modelling adaptation significantly affects the impact estimates. The range of the difference (%) in impacts between including and excluding adaptation, irrespective of climate modelling and emissions uncertainty, can be as low as 28% with one method and up to 103% with another (mean across 14 cities). Thus we recommend that future assessments account for adaptation uncertainty in their approach. Furthermore, more evidence should be generated on the costs and effectiveness of the array of practical adaptation mechanisms that underlie the modelling assumptions we applied.\n\nCo-authors: Kayo Ueda, Yasushi Honda\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nThe impact of heat on mortality has been well documented, particularly in temperate and subtropical areas, which were observed to manifest acutely. Further evidence have shown that these acute heat effects were also evident in tropical areas. However, there is little understanding of the future consequences of heat effects, with reference to a no-adaptation scenario, particularly in tropical low and middle-income countries. This study intends to 1) estimate the baseline risk coefficient, and further 2) estimate the excess mortality and life year lost due to heat. Daily mortality and meteorological data (both from 2006-2011), as well as the baseline mortality, population projection (2030 and 2045), were collected from the respective Philippine agencies. We used a two-stage analysis to estimate the baseline risk coefficient: city-level risk-estimates were analyzed using a distributed lag non-linear model, and the risks estimated from the first stage was then pooled via meta-analytical techniques. Excess mortality as well as life years lost were calculated based on a no-adaptation assumption, subject to different increments in the annual average temperature with reference to the baseline risk, and the baseline threshold. Heat risk coefficient from the pooled analysis was estimated to be at 0.1457 per 1℃ increase. While excess mortality under non-adaptation, with 2℃ increase in annual average temperature resulted to 132,378 and 150,077 excess deaths in 2030 and 2045, respectively. Years life lost were also magnified at 47,964,647 life years lost and 54,377,511 life years lost, in both 2030 and 2045, respectively. Non-adaptation to the increasing temperature, particularly in a tropical setting, exposes the population to greater risks, which thereby strengthens the need to evaluate the possible current and future means of adaptation in order to address the future risk gaps.\n\nCo-authors: Ana M.

The 2003 heat wave caused an estimated 7% increase in all-cause mortality. Consequently, the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health developed an information campaign to raise public awareness on heat threats and health authorities in some Swiss Cantons developed additional heat warning systems (HWS).\n\nTo explore the effectiveness in reducing temperature-related impacts of the public health measures in Switzerland, we assessed a) the variation of heat effect on daily mortality for the time periods 1995-2002 and 2004-2013, and b) the excess mortality during summer 2015 which was the second warmest summer for 150 years after 2003.\n\nWe firstly performed conditional quasi-Poisson regression with non-linear distributed lag models to estimate temperature-mortality associations in the two periods. Daily age group-, gender- and region-specific all-cause excess mortality during summer (June–August) 2015 was estimated based on predictions derived from quasi-Poisson regression models fitted to the daily mortality data for the 10 previous years.\n\nRelative mortality risk at 32°C compared to 21°C dropped from 1.13 (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-1.25) in the time period 1995-2002 to 1.09 (1.00-1.18) in the more recent time period. For summer 2015, 804 excess deaths (5.4%, 95% CI 3.0-7.9%) were estimated. Temperature-adjusted analyses showed that in French speaking Cantons with HWS the excess mortality tended to be lower than expected.\n\nAlthough we observed a non-significant reduction in the effect of high temperatures on mortality in the time period after 2003, estimates of excess mortality for 2015 were only a little lower compared to those of summer 2003. Cantons with HWS could reduce heat-related mortality, but high temperatures continue to be a considerable risk factor for human health in Switzerland.\n\nCo-authors: Mark Rosegrant, Daniel Mason-D’Croz, Timothy B.

These include increased consumption of sugar, fats, and oils; growing demand for fruits and vegetables; and rapid growth in meat consumption and associated demand for livestock feeds. Sustainable food production growth also faces challenges from climate change as well as constraints on land and water resources and weakness in value chains.\n\nTogether with colleagues from across the CGIAR, we recently analyzed a broad range of scenarios to explore the impacts of alternative agricultural and rural investments to meet these challenges in the coming decades. Results provide a quantitative assessment of the impacts of alternative investment options on Sustainable Development Goals relating to poverty, food and nutrition security, and natural resources and ecosystem services, in the context of changes in population, income, technology, and climate to 2030 and 2050.\n\nWe find that scenarios which increase investment in agricultural research to enhance productivity generally offer moderate improvements in income, agricultural supply, and food security, with little impact on environmental improvement by 2030, but larger improvements by 2050, at relatively low cost. A scenario combining irrigation expansion and increased water use efficiency offers reductions in water use and small improvements in income, supply, and food security. Improved market access through investment in infrastructure to reduce marketing costs increases income, supply, and food security, but at the cost of increased conversion of forestland and greenhouse gas emissions. By contrast, a mixed portfolio of investments that combines productivity enhancement with improved resource management and market access achieves significant improvements in all outcome areas, particularly in 2050, but comes at a significantly higher cost.\n\nThese tradeoffs highlight the importance of integrated multidisciplinary analysis of the multiple goals and constraints facing decision makers at various scales. An ongoing process of dialogue with those decision makers will be essential to improve both the analysis and its value in informing policy to achieve the SDGs.\n\nCo-authors: Jessica Bogard, Keith Lividini, Joanne Arsenault, Malcolm Riley, Timothy Sulser, Daniel Mason-D’Croz, Brendan Power, David Gustafson, Mario Herrero, Keith Wiebe, Karen Cooper, Roseline Remans, Mark Rosegrant\n\nResearch to quantify the challenges of feeding the world has focused almost exclusively on dietary energy; much less on nutrition security, especially from a whole diet perspective. Using modeling that compares effects of socioeconomic and climate change futures on nutrient availability, affordability, adequacy and diversity to 2050, this presentation includes results from a two-year research project that compares the effects of climate change and income growth on nutrient security. Results for all principal macro- and micronutrients are included.\n\nKey messages from the research are:\n\nFirst, the benefits of widely shared economic growth are much stronger than the modelled negative effects of climate change; policies that support economic growth with more even income distribution are essential now while preparing for the coming consequences of climate change.\n\nSecond, average macronutrient availability is more than adequate now and to 2050, but low availability of some micronutrients is widespread and some nutrients with negative health effects are likely to become more available. Agricultural research priorities and agricultural policy should put increased emphasis on addressing micronutrient shortages and reducing the availability of nutrients with negative health consequences.\n\nFinally, climate change alters availability of some nutrients in some regions more than others. Efforts to increase affordability and availability of micronutrient-rich foods must be tailored to regional conditions.\n\nCo-authors: Christofer Åström, Camilla Andersson, Tanel Tamm, Kristie Ebi, Bertil Forsberg\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nOzone is a highly oxidative pollutant, associated with increased mortality. All else (e.g. ozone precursors) being equal, summertime ground-level ozone will increase as temperatures increase with climate change. As a part of the ACCEPTED project we used greenhouse gas and ozone precursor emission scenarios, global and regional climate and chemistry-transport models, epidemiological data and population projections to assess ozone- and heat-related health risks under a changing climate.\n\nEuropean ozone concentrations were modelled at a grid size of 50x50 km using MATCH. Climate projections from the regional climate model RCA4 were used. For the surface ozone and temperatures, the global climate model EC-EARTH was used as input for the regional climate model, forced by the greenhouse gas emission scenario RCP4.5. Two periods were compared: the current climate as 1991-2000 and future climate as 2046–2055. The impacts on long- and short-term mortality due to ozone exposure and heat related premature deaths in Europe were calculated.\n\nCurrently long-term exposure to ozone causes annually around 55,000 premature deaths in Europe, of which around 26,000 deaths are expected due to short-term effects. When only taking into account the impact of changing climate on surface ozone, up to 11% increase in ozone-associated mortality is expected in some countries in Central- and Southern-Europe. However, projected decrease in ozone precursor emissions will cause much larger decrease in surface ozone (29.5% as EU average). Due to aging and increasing susceptible populations, the decrease in 2050 would be actually smaller, up to 24.2%. During summer months, ozone risks will combine with increasing temperatures, especially during hottest periods and in densely populated urban areas. While the heat burden is currently of the same order of magnitude as ozone, due to increasing temperatures and decreasing ozone precursor emission, the difference will be twice as large in 2050.\n\nClimate and emission changes will substantially affect ozone and temperature related mortality and the ratio between them in the middle of this century in Europe.\n\nCo-authors: Toon Vandyck, Bert Saveyn, Mike Holland, Joseph Spadaro, Kimon Keramidas, Alban Kitous\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nThe objective to \"prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system\" (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, 1992) has been pivotal in the international debate on climate change over the past decades. Where climate policies are implemented by nations for universal benefit, the co-benefits in terms of local improvements in air quality, that are sometimes overlooked, can provide a convincing complementary rationale for ambitious climate action – in particular in rapidly urbanising and industrialising regions where air quality may be severely compromised.\n\nHere we show that the transformation of the energy system implied by individual national emission reduction pledges made in the context of the Paris Agreement on climate change (the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions or INDCs) contribute significantly to lower concentration levels of local air pollutants across the globe. We evaluate the co-benefits of climate action under 3 scenarios for air quality control: (1) emission control measures frozen at the level of 2010; (2) continued implementation of currently programmed air quality legislation; (3) implementation of maximal technically feasible measures.\n\nAs such, the INDCs could reduce the number of air-pollution induced premature deaths by 130'000 – 267'000 in 2030, compared to a reference scenario without additional climate action. Further strengthening the ambition of climate change mitigation policies to limit global warming to 2°C by the end of the century raises the avoided mortality estimate to 1.5 – 4.3 million in 2050. Moreover, accounting for the benefits of improved air quality on health and agriculture substantially reduces the cost of climate change mitigation policies. These results illustrate that discussions on climate change policy risk being framed from too narrow a perspective if co-benefits for air quality are neglected.\n\nCo-authors: Shinichiro Fujimori, Kiyoshi Takahashi, Tokuta Yokohata, Toshihiko Masui\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nThis study quantified the impacts of climate change on human health through undernourishment using two economic measures. First, changes in morbidity and mortality due to nine diseases caused by being underweight as a child were analyzed using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with changes in the labor force, population, and demands for healthcare taken into consideration. Second, changes in mortality were taken from the CGE simulation and assessed economically by the value of lives lost and willingness to pay to reduce the risk. Model uncertainties in future crop yields, climate conditions, and socioeconomic conditions were considered using future projections from six global crop models and five global climate models and assuming multiple socioeconomic conditions. We found that the economic valuation of healthy lives lost due to undernourishment under climate change was equivalent to -0.4% to 0.0% of global gross domestic product (GDP) and was regionally heterogeneous, ranging from -4.0% to 0.0% of regional GDP in 2100. In contrast, the actual economic losses associated with the effects of additional health expenditure and the decrease in the labor force due to undernourishment resulting from climate change corresponded to a -0.1% to 0.0% change in GDP and a -0.2% to 0.0% change in household consumption, respectively, at the global level. These impacts can be avoided by achieving the stringent mitigation in the context of the Paris Agreement.\n\nCo-authors: Yuming Guo, Francesco Sera, Veronika Huber, Clare Heaviside, Dann Mitchell, Andy Haines, Ben Armstrong, Kristie Ebi, Antonio Gasparrini; on behalf of the MCC Collaborative Research Network\n\nBackground/Aim: The recent international agreement reached in Paris aims at keeping the increase in global mean temperature (GMT) below 2°C, and it pursues efforts to limit it below 1.5°C. Here we provide evidence on temperature-related direct mortality impacts under these and more extreme climate change scenarios, using a worldwide multi-country dataset.\n\nMethods: Two-stage time series analysis using distributed lag non-linear models and multivariate meta-analysis to estimate temperature-mortality relationships for 451 locations within 23 countries in 1985-2012. Future impacts, quantified as attributable risks for non-optimal temperature and for cold and heat separately, were computed under scenarios consistent with 1.5°C, 2°C, 3°C, and 4°C increase in GMT, defined by corresponding 20-year windows identified in temperature series projected along the 21st century using four global climate models.\n\nResults: Across different regions of the world, a rise from 1.5°C to 2°C in GMT would generate 0.20%-1.38% increases in heat-related and 0.30%-0.73% decreases in cold-related mortality. Mild temperate areas such as North Europe, East Asia and Australia would experience a small net decrease (0.29%, 0.31% and 0.47%, respectively), while hotter places such as South Europe and South-East Asia would face a larger significant net increase (0.69% and 0.72%). Changes are close to null in areas characterized by diverse climatic conditions, such North America and Central Europe. More extreme scenarios with GMT rising to 3°C-4°C would present more dramatic heat-related impacts, especially in hotter places, with net increases up to 7.07% in some tropical areas.\n\nConclusions: This large worldwide assessment provides evidence of potential health benefits of enforcing mitigation strategies to reduce global warming. Compliance with the limits set by the Paris Agreement (2°C) would prevent dramatic increases in mortality projected in many regions, while more ambitious targets (1.5°C) would be beneficial for hotter tropical areas where a large proportion of world population lives.\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nBackground/Aim: Significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions beyond the Nationally Determined Commitments coming out of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement are required to avoid warming of 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures. Ancillary health benefits represent selected near term, positive consequences of climate policies that can offset mitigation costs in the short term, before the benefits of those policies on the magnitude of climate change are evident.\n\nMethods: We evaluated the range of methods and choices in modeling the health co-benefits of climate mitigation to identify opportunities for increased consistency and collaboration to better inform policy-making. We reviewed 40 studies quantifying the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation: (1) reducing the concentrations of ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and secondary pollutants such as ozone; (2) increasing active transport; and (3) sustainable dietary changes, published since the 2009 Lancet Commission “Managing the health effects of climate change”. We documented approaches, methods chosen, scenarios, health-related exposures and health outcomes\n\nResults: Air quality, transportation, and diet scenarios ranged from specific policy proposals to hypothetical scenarios, and from global recommendations to stakeholder-informed local guidance. Geographic and temporal scope as well as validity of scenarios determines policy relevance. More recent studies tended to have more sophisticated methods to address complexity in the relevant policy system.\n\nConclusions: Mitigation could improve health in the shorter term even as reduced emissions decrease the risks of climate change later in the century. Health co-benefits from mitigation policies in other areas are likely, with further exploration warranted to better estimate the full range of possible benefits for a basket of mitigation policies and technologies.\n\nCo-authors: Helena Ting, Tim Swanson\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nIn countries where rainfed agriculture constitutes a significant portion of household livelihood, increased weather variability represents a source of vulnerability to stable consumption, food security and household well-being. Weather induced income changes affect household\n\nconsumption and saving decisions. We evaluate saving and consumption responses to weather variation in South Africa, leveraging a newly available panel of nationally representative households covering the period from 2008 to 2014 and long term climate data. We test our data\n\nagainst predictions of the standard rational consumption model and some of its main extensions (i.e., precautionary saving and myopic consumption). Furthermore, we evaluate the impact of saving on household life satisfaction and health behavior. In accordance with previous literature, we find that households save in response to both transitory and permanent income change, although the proportion saved from transitory income is significantly higher. We find signs of precautionary saving driven by non-agriculture households, while we find stronger evidences of myopic consumption for agriculture households. In addition, we show that a one-unit increase in log-saving from transitory income increases the odds of a unit increase in self-reported life satisfaction of the household head by 14%, and a one unit increase in log-saving from permanent\n\nincome leads to a 6% increase in hazard ratio of having taken an HIV test. This latter result may indicate that preventative health behavior such as HIV testing requires a stronger inducement than a transitory injection of income. Further research is needed to identify the mechanisms by which saving affect life satisfaction and health seeking behavior in developing countries\n\nCo-author: Ian S.

Furthermore, in order to determine the future impact of climate change on influenza mortality, we provide bias corrected projections under RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios for two time epochs of the 21st century (2026-2045 and 2081-2100). The climatic data comes from the GLDAS (Rodell et al., 2004), while weekly influenza mortality data was taken from the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report of the CDC. We utilize generalized additive and include location (city) and time (year and week) fixed effects to control for unobserved heterogeneity, thus we are measuring the excess mortality above the all-city long-run average rate for each week. For the projections, we use data from three GCMs; GISS-ER-2 3, CNRM-CM5, and NorESM1-M. We find robust non-linear effects of both temperature and specific humidity on influenza mortality rates in the U.S. We find that the risk of influenza mortality is positive between −30℃ and 5℃ but the risk becomes negative between temperature range of 5℃ and 25℃, and the effect of humidity is highest between specific humidity levels of 4 g/kg and 12 g/kg (equivalent to Relative Humidity of 20% and 35%). Our projection results suggest that the West, Midwest, and Southeastern US are at high risk of increase in per capita influenza mortality due to climate change - up to 3% by the end of the 21st century.\n\nCo-authors: Stefan Fronzek, Kirsi Mäkinen, Reija Ruuhela, Emma Terämä\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nIn Finland there has been less research into impacts of climate change on human health than in many other parts of Europe. However, changes in climate, combined with societal trends such as aging, urbanisation and lifestyle changes, are expected to have impacts there as well. Some impacts are likely to be positive, including a reduced burden of mortality and morbidity with less severe winters. However, there are also potential risks, including: high summer temperatures, microbial water contamination, altered air quality due to pollutants and allergenic pollen, tick-borne diseases, and moisture damage and indoor air problems in buildings.\n\nHere, we illustrate ongoing work to assess climate-related risks to human health in Finland. We also outline the institutional and policy context in which climate change impacts and adaptation are being addressed. The two aspects are inextricably linked and both face significant challenges.\n\nWe focus on three related methodological challenges for assessing impacts and risks:\n\n• Examining alternative approaches for modelling heat-related mortality in Finland\n\n• Development of national scenarios for health and well-being within the RCP-SSP framework\n\n• Risk mapping of exposure, social vulnerability and climate-related hazards, building on earlier work presented at Impacts World 2013.\n\nInstitutionally, barriers to progress in preparing for climate change include lack of awareness and complacency among some decision makers and unclear responsibilities. There has also been an absence of systematic and authoritative research, including economic assessment, to analyse and prioritise the potential risks or to identify adaptation measures. This calls for active and co-ordinated participation of all the major public health institutions along with researchers from other disciplines and including the private sector. Currently, funding is devoted to other pressing research priorities, notably a major re-structuring of national health services. Although health forms a component of Finland’s National Climate Change Adaptation Plan 2022, there is little indication that adaptation has yet been accounted for in this re-structuring.\n\nCo-author: Paul Watkiss\n\nDownload presentation slides\n\nHealth impacts of climate change have – to date – been estimated primarily at global and national scales, with little analysis undertaken at the scale most resonant for individual organisations. However, as the rationale for impact analysis extends beyond awareness-raising and towards a necessary input into adaptation decision-making, the need to tailor analysis to individual organisations is increasingly recognised. This paper provides a demonstration as to how an organisation – in this case, a public health provider in the UK - might wish to consider climate change impacts and their effect on its operations.\n\nWe analyse the climate change health risks that are likely to be material to the Bristol Health Partnership (BHP). BHP is interested in climate change health risks for two broad but related reasons: health risks to the general public and the subsequent impact on the demand for treatment from BHP health provision services, and risks to those services including to buildings and its workforce. Primary risks considered are those from increased frequency of flooding and extreme heat events. We quantify these risks and express these risks in monetary terms. We generate our estimates using a bottom-up method that adopts down-scaled climate scenarios, (UKCP09), projected city-level demographic data, epidemiological data derived from historical analogues, and monetary values using appropriate transfer methods. Climate risk costs are disaggregated BY cost of treatment, cost of lost productivity and pain and suffering – the latter estimated using survey data. We use ranges to capture uncertainties.\n\nTotal annual costs of flooding and heat are projected to increase by 40% (central estimate) by 2040. Approximately 50% of these costs are attributed to the financial components, the other 50% to pain and suffering. The results highlight the potential scale of resource implications for the BHP, which is consequently up-dating its risk register and developing an adaptation plan.\n\nCo-authors: Nick Watts & the Lancet Count Down Team\n\nThe Lancet Countdown 2030: tracking progress on health and climate change is an international, multidisciplinary research collaboration between academic institutions and practitioners across the world. It follows on from the work of the 2015 Lancet Commission, which concluded that the response to climate change could be “the greatest global health opportunity of the 21st century”. The Lancet Countdown aims to track the health impacts of climate hazards; health resilience and adaptation; health co-benefits of climate change mitigation; economics and finance; and political and broader engagement. These focus areas form the five thematic working groups of the Lancet Countdown and represent different aspects of the complex association between health and climate change. These thematic groups provide indicators for a global overview of health and climate change; national case studies highlighting countries leading the way or going against the trend; and engagement with a range of stakeholders. The Lancet Countdown ultimately aims to continue its annual reports across these five working groups. This paper outlines the scope of indicators and indicator domains being or to be tracked by the collaboration. The 2017 Lancet Count Down report will be published in the fall 2017. The current indicator domains require further refinement, and mark the beginning of an ongoing consultation process to develop these domains, identify key areas not currently covered, and change indicators where necessary. This collaboration will actively seek to engage with existing monitoring processes, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals and WHO's climate and health country profiles. The indicators will also evolve over time through ongoing collaboration with experts and a range of stakeholders, and be dependent on the emergence of new evidence and knowledge. During the course of its work, the Lancet Countdown will adopt a colla"
