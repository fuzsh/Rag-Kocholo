In Ibarreta, the chance of a wet day over the course of March is gradually decreasing, starting the month at 36% and ending it at 34%.\n\nFor reference, the year's highest daily chance of a wet day is 40% on November 30, and its lowest chance is 9% on August 8.\n\nRainfall\n\nTo show variation within the month and not just the monthly total, we show the rainfall accumulated over a sliding 31-day period centered around each day.\n\nThe average sliding 31-day rainfall during March in Ibarreta is gradually increasing, starting the month at 5.3 inches, when it rarely exceeds 9.0 inches or falls below 2.0 inches, and ending the month at 5.6 inches, when it rarely exceeds 9.3 inches or falls below 2.0 inches.\n\nThe highest average 31-day accumulation is 5.7 inches on March 25.\n\nSun\n\nOver the course of March in Ibarreta, the length of the day is decreasing. From the start to the end of the month, the length of the day decreases by 45 minutes, implying an average daily decrease of 1 minute, 29 seconds, and weekly decrease of 10 minutes, 24 seconds.\n\nThe shortest day of the month is March 31, with 11 hours, 50 minutes of daylight and the longest day is March 1, with 12 hours, 35 minutes of daylight.\n\nThe earliest sunrise of the month in Ibarreta is 6:54 AM on March 1 and the latest sunrise is 14 minutes later at 7:08 AM on March 31.\n\nThe latest sunset is 7:28 PM on March 1 and the earliest sunset is 30 minutes earlier at 6:58 PM on March 31.\n\nDaylight saving time is not observed in Ibarreta during 2024.\n\nFor reference, on December 21, the longest day of the year, the Sun rises at 6:06 AM and sets 13 hours, 43 minutes later, at 7:49 PM, while on June 20, the shortest day of the year, it rises at 7:44 AM and sets 10 hours, 34 minutes later, at 6:18 PM.\n\nThe figure below presents a compact representation of the sun's elevation (the angle of the sun above the horizon) and azimuth (its compass bearing) for every hour of every day in the reporting period. The horizontal axis is the day of the year and the vertical axis is the hour of the day. For a given day and hour of that day, the background color indicates the azimuth of the sun at that moment.

Lower dew points feel drier and higher dew points feel more humid. Unlike temperature, which typically varies significantly between night and day, dew point tends to change more slowly, so while the temperature may drop at night, a muggy day is typically followed by a muggy night.\n\nThe chance that a given day will be muggy in Ibarreta is rapidly decreasing during March, falling from 76% to 64% over the course of the month.\n\nFor reference, on January 26, the muggiest day of the year, there are muggy conditions 78% of the time, while on August 1, the least muggy day of the year, there are muggy conditions 2% of the time.\n\nWind\n\nThis section discusses the wide-area hourly average wind vector (speed and direction) at 10 meters above the ground. The wind experienced at any given location is highly dependent on local topography and other factors, and instantaneous wind speed and direction vary more widely than hourly averages.\n\nThe average hourly wind speed in Ibarreta is essentially constant during March, remaining within 0.1 miles per hour of 6.5 miles per hour throughout.\n\nFor reference, on September 7, the windiest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 8.4 miles per hour, while on March 18, the calmest day of the year, the daily average wind speed is 6.4 miles per hour.\n\nThe lowest daily average wind speed during March is 6.4 miles per hour on March 18.\n\nThe hourly average wind direction in Ibarreta throughout March is predominantly from the east, with a peak proportion of 42% on March 18.\n\nGrowing Season\n\nDefinitions of the growing season vary throughout the world, but for the purposes of this report, we define it as the longest continuous period of non-freezing temperatures (≥ 32Â°F) in the year (the calendar year in the Northern Hemisphere, or from July 1 until June 30 in the Southern Hemisphere).\n\nTemperatures in Ibarreta are sufficiently warm year round that it is not entirely meaningful to discuss the growing season in these terms. We nevertheless include the chart below as an illustration of the distribution of temperatures experienced throughout the year.\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Ibarreta\n\nTime Spent in Various Temperature Bands and the Growing Season in March in Ibarretagrowing seasonMar11223344556677889910101111121213131414151516161717181819192020212122222323242425252626272728282929303031310%100%10%90%20%80%30%70%40%60%50%50%60%40%70%30%80%20%90%10%100%0%FebApr100%Mar 16100%Mar 16coolcomfortablewarmhotswelteringcold\n\nfrigid 15Â°F freezing 32Â°F very cold 45Â°F cold 55Â°F cool 65Â°F comfortable 75Â°F warm 85Â°F hot 95Â°F sweltering\n\nGrowing degree days are a measure of yearly heat accumulation used to predict plant and animal development, and defined as the integral of warmth above a base temperature, discarding any excess above a maximum temperature. In this report, we use a base of 50Â°F and a cap of 86Â°F.\n\nThe average accumulated growing degree days in Ibarreta are rapidly increasing during March, increasing by 835Â°F, from 5,976Â°F to 6,811Â°F, over the course of the month.\n\nSolar Energy\n\nThis section discusses the total daily incident shortwave solar energy reaching the surface of the ground over a wide area, taking full account of seasonal variations in the length of the day, the elevation of the Sun above the horizon, and absorption by clouds and other atmospheric constituents. Shortwave radiation includes visible light and ultraviolet radiation.\n\nThe average daily incident shortwave solar energy in Ibarreta is gradually decreasing during March, falling by 0.8 kWh, from 6.4 kWh to 5.6 kWh, over the course of the month.\n\nTopography\n\nFor the purposes of this report, the geographical coordinates of Ibarreta are -25.214 deg latitude, -59.859 deg longitude, and 351 ft elevation.\n\nThe topography within 2 miles of Ibarreta is essentially flat, with a maximum elevation change of 36 feet and an average elevation above sea level of 357 feet. Within 10 miles is also essentially flat (79 feet). Within 50 miles is essentially flat (220 feet).\n\nThe area within 2 miles of Ibarreta is covered by shrubs (51%), trees (24%), cropland (14%), and grassland (10%), within 10 miles by trees (69%) and shrubs (22%), and within 50 miles by trees (86%).\n\nData Sources\n\nThis report illustrates the typical weather in Ibarreta, based on a statistical analysis of historical hourly weather reports and model reconstructions from January 1, 1980 to December 31, 2016.\n\nTemperature and Dew Point\n\nThere are 2 weather stations near enough to contribute to our estimation of the temperature and dew point in Ibarreta.\n\nFor each station, the records are corrected for the elevation difference between that station and Ibarreta according to the International Standard Atmosphere , and by the relative change present in the MERRA-2 satellite-era reanalysis between the two locations.\n\nThe estimated value at Ibarreta is computed as the weighted average of the individual contributions from each station, in addition to a contribution from the MERRA-2 reconstruction, corrected for the difference between the reference elevation of the MERRA-2 grid cell and the elevation of Ibarreta.\n\nThe station weights are proportional to the inverse of the distance between Ibarreta and a given station.\n\nThe weight assigned to the MERRA-2 value depends on the distance from Ibarreta to the nearest station, increasing from 0% at 150 kilometers to 100% at 200 kilometers. In this case, the MERRA-2 weight is 40%.\n\nThe stations contributing to this reconstruction are:\n\nPresidencia Roque SÃ¡enz PeÃ±a Airport (SARS, 32%, 114 mi, south, -46 ft elevation change)\n\nFormosa Aerodrome (SARF, 28%, 123 mi, southeast, -157 ft elevation change)\n\nTo get a sense of how much these sources agree with each other, you can view a comparison of Ibarreta and the stations that contribute to our estimates of its temperature history and climate. Please note that each source's contribution is adjusted for elevation and the relative change present in the MERRA-2 data.\n\nOther Data\n\nAll data relating to the Sun's position (e.g., sunrise and sunset) are computed using astronomical formulas from the book, Astronomical Algorithms 2nd Edition , by Jean Meeus.\n\nAll other weather data, including cloud cover, precipitation, wind speed and direction, and solar flux, come from NASA's MERRA-2 Modern-Era Retrospective Analysis . This reanalysis combines a variety of wide-area measurements in a state-of-the-art global meteorological model to reconstruct the hourly history of weather throughout the world on a 50-kilometer grid.\n\nLand Use data comes from the Global Land Cover SHARE database , published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.\n\nElevation data comes from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) , published by NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\n\nNames, locations, and time zones of places and some airports come from the GeoNames Geographical Database .\n\nTime zones for airports and weather stations are provided by AskGeo.com .\n\nMaps are © OpenStreetMap contributors.\n\nDisclaimer\n\nThe information on this site is provided as is, without any assurances as to its accuracy or suitability for any purpose. Weather data is prone to errors, outages, and other defects. We assume no responsibility for any decisions made on the basis of the content presented on this site.\n\nWe draw particular cautious attention to our reliance on the MERRA-2 model-based reconstructions for a number of important data series. While having the tremendous advantages of temporal and spatial completeness, these reconstructions: (1) are based on computer models that may have model-based errors, (2) are coarsely sampled on a 50 km grid and are therefore unable to reconstruct the local variations of many microclimates, and (3) have particular difficulty with the weather in some coastal areas, especially small islands.\n\nWe further caution that our travel scores are only as good as the data that underpin them, that weather conditions at any given location and time are unpredictable and variable, and that the definition of the scores reflects a particular set of preferences that may not agree with those of any particular reader.\n\nPlease review our full terms contained on our Terms of Service page."
