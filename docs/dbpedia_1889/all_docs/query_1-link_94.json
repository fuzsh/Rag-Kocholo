        "text": "Deforestation of Chacoan native forests and reorientation of land use are transforming the region into agricultural use. The main purpose of this work was to evaluate the impact of different land uses on soil quality in the semi-arid Chaco (Argentina). We assessed the behaviour of soil parameters over four years of experimental conditions: 1) Exclosure pasture (EP) used as reference level, 2) Grazed pasture (GP), 3) Grazed pasture transformed to agriculture with Zero tillage (ZT) and 4) Grazed pasture transformed to agriculture under Conventional tillage (CT). Soil organic carbon, particulate and heavy organic carbon (C), total nitrogen (N), C:N ratio, pH, electric conductivity and soil respiration were measured. Soil samples were taken yearly at 0-5, 5-20 and 20-40 cm of soil depth. Differences among treatments across time were assessed by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) with time (years) as covariate factor, treatments as group factor and individual scores from Principal Component...\n\nResumen El suelo es un recurso indispensable para la vida que permite el desarrollo de las plantas, los animales y el hombre. Sin embargo, aún no se reconocen todas las funciones que realiza, por lo que el concepto general de suelo fértil se refiere más bien a sus propiedades químicas, específicamente a la disponibilidad de los macroelementos primarios (nitrógeno, fósforo y potasio). En los últimos años se han propuesto nuevas defini-ciones que integran las propiedades físicas, químicas y biológicas de los suelos, así como su capacidad de ser sostenibles, producir alimentos sanos y mitigar la polución medioambiental. No obstante, aún no existen criterios universales para evaluar los cambios en la calidad del suelo, y para ello se utilizan indicadores que son atributos edáficos sensibles al manejo y a las condiciones edafoclimáticas, entre otras características, que permiten valorar su estado. En este artículo se pretende, de forma general, contribuir al conocimiento de la nueva concepción de la calidad del suelo, a partir de sus funciones; definir los indicadores biológicos, físicos y químicos y la relación entre ellos; así como describir algunos estudios que se han realizado en Cuba sobre el tema de los indicadores de la calidad, como una herramienta para la toma de decisiones en el manejo. Abstract Soil is an essential resource for life, which allows the development of plants, animals and men. However, all the functions it performs are not acknowledged yet, for which the general concept of fertile soil rather refers to its chemical properties, specifically to the availability of primary macroelements (nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium). In recent years new definitions have been proposed integrating the physical, chemical and biological properties of soils, as well as their capacity of being sustainable, producing healthy food and mitigating environmental pollution. However, there are no universal criteria yet to evaluate the changes in soil quality, and for such purpose indicators are used, sensitive to management and the edaphoclimatic conditions, among other characteristics, which allow appraising its status. This paper intends, in general, to contribute to the knowledge of the new conception of soil quality, from its functions; define the biological, physical and chemical indicators and the relation among them; as well as to describe some studies which have been conducted in Cuba about the topic of quality indicators, as a tool for decision-making in management.\n\nThe objective of this work was to assess soil quality indicators obtained with different datasets to compare soil management systems in the Brazilian Cerrado. Three criteria were used to select soil physical, chemical, and biological indicators: the full set of indicators obtained, with 36 parameters, for which all the physical, chemical, and biological soil properties were determined; a subset of indicators selected by principal component analysis (20 parameters); and a subset of indicators with some frequency of use in the literature (16 parameters). These indicators were obtained from the following management systems: no-tillage, conventional tillage, and native cerrado vegetation. Soil samples were collected at 0.0-0.1-m soil depth, and soil quality indicators were subjected to analysis of variance and their means were compared. The incorporation of soil native cerrado into agriculture decreased soil quality. The most commonly used indicators in the scientific literature are sen...\n\nIn Chile, 49.1% of the national territory is affected by soil degradation (including erosion and loss of soil organic matter), whereby of the 51.7 Mha that have been historically associated with agricultural-livestock and forestry activities, only 35.5 Mha are being used at the present. Consequently, soil degradation has resulted in the release of about 11.8 Gg yr−1 of carbon (C) equivalent (CO2eq) to the atmosphere. Silvopastoral systems (SPS), however, can increase soil organic C (SOC) through sequestration (C→SOC), improve ecosystem services, and have been internationally recommended for sustainable land use. Therefore, it was proposed to determine the effects of SPS on soils, over five years, in degraded sites that were located in the Ranchillo Alto (SPS-RA) (37°04′52″ S, 71°39′14″ W), Ñuble region. The sites were rated according to previous canopy disturbance levels (+) as follows: open (Op)+++, semi open (SOp)++, and semi closed (SC)+. The analysis was performed on different p..."
