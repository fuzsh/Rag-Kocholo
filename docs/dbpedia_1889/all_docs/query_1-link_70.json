        "text": "The outdoor thermal comfort index termed ‘Universal Thermal Climate Index’ or ‘UTCI’ was launched in 2009 as successful output of interdisciplinary work performed by a group of experts that composed the European COST Action 730, Commission 6, within the framework of the International Society of Biometeorology (ISB). COST Action 730 was centered on the development of a physiological assessment model of the thermal environment in order to significantly enhance applications related to health and well-being in the fields of public weather service, public health systems, precautionary planning and climate impact research. After a full decade from the finalization and official launch of the UTCI, it is timely relevant to check on the progress and current applications of the index so far. UTCI is to be included in the revision of one of the guidelines of the Association of German Engineers (Verein Deutscher Ingenieure ‘VDI’), VDI Guideline 3787-2, which is aimed at providing “evaluation methods of human biometeorology as a standard for taking into account climate and air quality (bioclimate) in relation to man in overall physical planning”. The chapter describes motivations that lead to the organization and writing of the book, putting this in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic."
