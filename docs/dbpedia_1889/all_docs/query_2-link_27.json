The document discusses factors that affect climate such as latitude, altitude, proximity to large bodies of water, ocean currents, and wind systems. \n2. Latitude affects climate because places near the equator experience more direct sunlight and have a warmer climate while places farther from the equator receive sunlight at an angle and have cooler climates.  \n3. Altitude also influences climate, with temperature generally decreasing as elevation increases, so mountainous areas tend to have cooler temperatures.",
