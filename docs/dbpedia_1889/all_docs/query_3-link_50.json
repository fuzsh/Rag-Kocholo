        "text": "You can estimate approximate compass directions using the positions of the hour hand and the sun as a guide. Keep in mind that these determinations are approximate as discrepancies can arise at different latitudes and in different seasons.\n\n1.Check that the watch is showing the correct time and then lay the watch horizontally and align the hour hand of the watch with the direction of the sun.\n\nThe point approximately mid-way between the 12 o’clock position on the dial and the direction of the hour hand when it is aligned with the sun indicates south. Morning is on the left side of the dial, and afternoon is on the right side facing south.\n\n2.Rotating bezel with a compass\n\nTurning the rotating bezel so that the “S” points south will allow you to read other approximate compass directions.\n\nWatches with a compass and non-rotating bezel\n\nTurning the watch body so that the “S” faces south will allow you to read other approximate compass directions.\n\n* In the southern hemisphere, the point approximately mid-way between the 12 o’clock position and the direction of the hour hand when it is aligned with the sun indicates north."
