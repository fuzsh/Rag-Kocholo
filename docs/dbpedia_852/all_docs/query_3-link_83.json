        "text": "This paper discusses Scandinavian gold foil figures from the early part of the Late Iron Age (AD 550–1050). The author presents two major points of interest that have been neglected in previous research. The first highlights how the manipulations the figures have undergone must be taken into consideration, which is accomplished with the help of theatre theory, semiotics and anthropology. The second places an emphasis on how the context from which the figures have been retrieved must be analysed. Consequently, from the example of a ceremonial building at Uppåkra, Sweden, it is contended that the figures were made by artisans/smiths that, apart from expertly making the figures, also acted as ritual specialists when the structure was built or inaugurated. As such, they were responsible for depositing specific figures in particular, designated and pivotal places that needed protection or other ritual treatment. The gold foil figures further highlight the intertwinement between subject and object, human and nonhuman, as well as between the divine and the mundane. Therefore they contributesignificantly to discussions on materiality.\n\nThis paper outlines a methodology for approaching mythology in earlier cultural environments for which written sources are limited or completely lacking. This methodology here specifically targets how to relate that mythology to evidence in the material record. This is illustrated through the case of the so-called clay paw rite of Viking Age Åland. Åland presents an interesting example owing to its position between linguistic-cultural areas on the one hand while the language and intangible culture of Åland remains otherwise unknown. The clay paw rite is a distinctively Ålandic phenomenon of the late Iron Age that is customarily interpreted as related either to a cult of the bear or a cult of the beaver. This rite is also interesting because it was apparently carried by Ålanders along the Eastern Route where it became established deep in a Finno-Ugric cultural area. The methodology outlined here includes a theoretical framework for approaching 'mythology' in terms of systems of symbols, relating these to narratives, magic and ritual practices. All of the systems of symbols within a cultural environment (which may include both e.g. Christian and vernacular systems, vernacular Germanic and Finnic systems, etc.) are together approached as a 'symbolic matrix' within which there can be different perspectives. The different perspectives are discussed in relation to different genres of performative practices and different institutions or social roles of ritual specialist, from ritual lamenters to Christian priests. The local and regional developments of mythology that are historical outcomes of both external contacts and internal change are viewed as producing 'dialects' of mythology. The long history of contacts and interactions in the Baltic Sea region are viewed as forming the equivalent of a language-dialect continuum for (at least certain areas of) mythologies cross-culturally. Åland is situated on this continuum between North Germanic and North Finnic cultures. This situation on the continuum enables certain reasonable inferences about the mythology current in the Viking Age irrespective of whether Åland was a Scandinavian- or Finnic-speaking area. The inferences that this approach enables are then applied to the case of the clay paw rite, the evidence of which is considered material outcomes of a mythologically informed symbolic practice.\n\nThis paper presents four western Norwegian Iron-Age courtyard sites, of which three have been investigated during the last ten years. By comparing functional and contextual aspects of these sites it is argued that they represent central assembly sites in local communities. The coherent similarity of such complex physical structures across time is seen as an expression of strong social and ideological continuity in Iron-Age society from the Roman period until the process of territorial unification under kings with national ambitions that started in the late 9th century. With reference to the Icelandic analogy and the historical connection between Iceland and Western Norway in the Viking period it is also argued for the courtyard sites as an important institution (þing) in the pre-state judicial and political system."
