        "text": "by Malin Tengström 30 Jun 07:23 PDT\n\nGotland Runt 2024 © Daniel Stenholm\n\nThe world's largest annual offshore race commenced at 14:00 on Sunday, with over 200 boats departing from Sandhamn to begin their journey around Gotland. This year's race promises to be unpredictable, with unstable weather conditions and challenging winds expected to make for an exciting competition all the way to the finish line.\n\nThe harbor was bustling with anticipation early in the morning, as eager crews and thoughtful navigators studied rapidly changing forecasts. The unstable weather has been a hot topic on the docks, though it pales in comparison to last year's race, which saw only 23 boats cross the finish line.\n\nThis year marks a significant milestone as the race starts from Sandhamn for the first time in 14 years, although this is a temporary move. This change has attracted larger boats and numerous international teams. Notably, three records have been broken just by reviewing the entry list: the largest boat, the highest proportion of international crews, and the highest number of female participants ever.\n\nThe race begins at Gråskärsfjärden outside Sandhamn, with boats sailing up to Svenska Högarna before setting their course towards Gotland. The majority of the field is expected to finish on Tuesday and Wednesday. Follow the race at gotlandrunt.se and via live broadcasts on KSSS's YouTube channel every morning and evening."
