Coles\n\nPREFACES From the Swedish Edition\n\nMy interest in Beowulf goes back a long way, but it was only with advancing years that I really got to grips with the subject. It has now kept me occupied for a good many years, albeit alongside a host of other things. The only deadline I have had is the one which nature, uninvited, sets before us. The list of colleagues and friends I have pestered with questions and requests to review manuscripts at various stages of incompleteness, and who have generously shared constructive criticism, information, ideas, suggestions for further reading, helpful advice, general assistance, and encouragement, is a long one: Magnus Alkarp, Anders Andrén, Birgit Arrhenius, Ylva Bäckström, Stefan Brink, Göran Burenhult, Bryony Coles, François-Xavier Dillmann, Rune Edberg, Torsten Edgren, Kristina Ekero Eriksson, Lennart Elmevik, Johan Engström, Lotta Fernstål, Per Frölund, Hans Göthberg, Anne-Sofie Gräslund, Elisabeth Gräslund Berg, Pekka Hakamies, Hans Helander, Frands Herschend, Helena Hulth, Peter Jackson, Magnus Källström, Lars-Gunnar Larsson, Thomas Lindkvist, Jonathan Lindström, John Ljungkvist, Tomas Matsson, Lotta Mejsholm, Jan Mispelaere, Håkan Möller, Agneta Ney, Jenny Nygren, Neil Price, Thure Stenström, Anneli Sundkvist, Olle Sundqvist, Gustav Svedjemo, Rolf Torstendahl, Gustaf Trotzig, Lisa Wahlbom, Per Widerström, Per-Axel Wiktorsson, Jonas Wikborg, Henrik Williams, Torun Zachrisson, and Arne Zettersten. Should any names unfortunately have been omitted, I reserve my warmest thanks for the individuals concerned. An academic lone wolf like myself is no more than a sheep in wolf’s clothing. Without the support of the rest of the flock, ewes as well as rams, I would never have made it to my destination. The fact that, for want of good sense, I have not always followed your advice does not detract in any way from your contribution. Special and heartfelt thanks go to Lennart Elmevik. Without his generous and patient help and guidance in the final phase of the work, I would never have escaped the claws of Germanic ablaut and been able to knock Chapter 7 and Appendix 2 into some sort of shape. The fixed base for my work has been the Department of Archaeology and Ancient History at Uppsala University, along with Uppsala University Library and its Karin Boye branch, all in the most pleasant symbiosis with the Fågelsången Café. My sincere thanks to them all, management and staff alike. I am also very grateful to Maj Reinhammar for her patient editing of this book and to John Wilkinson for taking care of the technical aspects of its production. The Berit Wallenberg Foundation, the Royal Gustavus Adolphus Academy for Swedish Folk Culture and the Viking Phenomenon research project have generously assisted with funding for publication, and the Gustavus Adolphus Academy also with travel funds on two occasions. My warmest thanks to them for this. Finally, I wish to thank Neil Price and Lars-Erik Edlund, who accepted my work for joint publication by the Department of Archaeology and the Royal Gustavus Adolphus Academy. Uppsala, March 2018 Bo Gräslund\n\nx\n\nPrefaces\n\nPreface to the Present Edition Apart from the fact that a large part of Chapter 1, which was mainly intended for Swedish readers unfamiliar with Beowulf, as well as the three appendices on folk-names have been omitted, only minor corrections and additions have been made for the English translation. I would like to extend a warm thank you to Martin Naylor for his patient work in translating the book and for his many valuable remarks in this connection. I would also like to extend a special thanks to Robert Bjork for his kindness in recommending the book for publication and for his generous help with the manuscript. Grants for the translation of this book have been provided by Torsten Söderbergs Stiftelse, Kungl. Gustav Adolfs Akademien för Svensk Folkkultur, Konung Gustav VI Adolfs Fond för Svensk Kultur, Magnus Bergvalls Stiftelse, and Sällskapet De Badande Wännernas Stiftelse. Grants for the publication of this book have also been provided by the Kungl. Vitterhets Historie och Antikvitets Akademien. For all this generous support, I would like to express my sincere thanks.\n\nChapter 1\n\nINTRODUCTION My aim in writing this book has been to try to answer the question of the provenance\n\nof Beowulf, that is to say, where and when the poem was originally composed. Such an undertaking may seem superfluous, given that there is not the slightest disagreement on this point and that the poem has been the subject of two hundred years of intensive research. In the end, though, a view that has no basis in either a thorough primary investigation or a recurring discussion of the subject is a challenge that is impossible to resist. The one existing manuscript of Beowulf very narrowly escaped the devastating fire that ravaged the Cotton Library at Ashburnham House in Westminster, London, on 23 October 1731, apparently by being thrown out of a window at the last minute. As the wall behind the bookcase in which the manuscript was kept had started to burn, most of its leaves are badly scorched along their outer edges. The manuscript has been very fragile ever since, and has been restored on several occasions since the middle of the nineteenth century, one of them very recent (Harrison 2009). After the fire it was transferred to the British Museum, but it has now belonged for many years to the British Library. The precarious history of the only preserved manuscript of the poem gives us cause for reflection: If the Beowulf manuscript had been destroyed […] no one could guess that a poem of such a quality had once existed. There could be no compelling reason to believe that any Germanic people had developed the art of secular heroic poetry to epic proportions, or if it had, that such an epic would deviate so sharply from the classical tradition as well as from most current aesthetic norms. (Niles 1983a, 249)\n\nToday, Beowulf may seem to be one of a kind, but in the world in which it was once created, it might perhaps have been no more unique than a star in the heavens. The metre of the poem corresponds to an archaic, common Germanic fornyrðislag. Roughly the same metre is found in the Heliand and the Hildebrandslied and in early eddic poetry, and can be made out in some Scandinavian runic inscriptions from the Migration Period. The basic story of the poem is well known. It consists of three main parts, the first of which is linked to the second, which is in turn linked to the third. Beowulf, the nephew of King Hygelac of the Geats, has heard that a monster is terrorizing the Danish king Hrothgar’s hall of Heorot (meaning “hart, stag”), probably so named after the antlers adorning the outside, or possibly the inside, of its end walls. The hall is expressly referred to as a “horned” building, hornreċed.1 Beowulf fits out a ship and travels with thirteen companions across the sea to offer Hrothgar help, which the king gratefully accepts. 1 704.\n\n2\n\nChapter 1\n\nOn their very first night at Heorot, the monster Grendel bursts in, seizes one of Beowulf’s men, and devours him on the spot. Beowulf grabs hold of the monster’s arm which, after a fierce struggle, is torn off at the shoulder. Mortally wounded, Grendel flees into the night, back to his watery dwelling. The next day, everyone celebrates Beowulf’s victory and he is richly rewarded by King Hrothgar. But the very same evening the hall is attacked again, this time by Grendel’s mother, intent on avenging her son. She seizes Æschere, Hrothgar’s confidant, and carries him off into the night. The following day an entire troop marches to the fen where the monsters have their lair. Beowulf dives in in full battle gear, engages in a terrible fight with Grendel’s mother in an enclosed space under the water and, after a great struggle, manages to kill her. Finally, he decapitates Grendel, who is lying there dying. Beowulf and his men then return to Heorot in triumph, carrying Grendel’s enormous head between them. Once again, Beowulf is richly rewarded by Hrothgar. The next morning, he and his men journey home with all their gifts and are received at the royal seat of King Hygelac, where Beowulf tells the assembled company of his adventures. In the next part of the poem we are at the end of Beowulf’s life, when he has been king of the Geats for many years. An enormous, murderous serpent has taken up residence in an old cairn full of magnificent treasure, from which the fire-breathing creature makes violent sorties, burning down the settlements of the Geats far around, including Beowulf’s hall. Once again, Beowulf takes responsibility and sets out with eleven thanes against the beast. Once he arrives, though, he realizes he will have to carry out his mission alone. The Serpent is a terrible adversary, against whom Beowulf’s ancestral sword is to no avail. At the eleventh hour his young kinsman Wiglaf comes to his aid, and between them they slay the Serpent. But Beowulf is badly wounded, and he dies shortly afterwards. The poem ends with Beowulf being ceremoniously cremated with sumptuous weapons and armor, and buried in a magnificent barrow that can be seen far out at sea. The third and shortest main theme of the poem concerns battles between the Geats and the Swedes.2 In connection with Beowulf’s fight with the Serpent and before his funeral, recollections are shared of several wars between these peoples, which ultimately resulted in the subjugation of the Geats. Twisting tendril-like throughout the poem are several other subsidiary accounts of earlier events linked to the families of Hygelac, Beowulf, and Hrothgar and to the history of the Danes. These include the passages on Hygelac and Beowulf’s military expedition to the mouth of the Rhine in the Frankish kingdom, and on a fateful battle at Finnsburg in southern Jutland. There are also brief references to figures from continental Germanic folk tradition, such as Sigemund/Sigurd the dragon-slayer; Modthryth, whose real name, however, appears to be Fremu (Kock 1920, 103; Fulk 2004), and her husband Offa, a king of the Anglians before they emigrated to England. 2 That is, the Svear. To avoid awkward constructions in English, the tribe spoken of in Beowulf as Swēon (Old Norse Svíar, Old Swedish Swēar, Latin Suiones) will in general be referred to here as the Swedes, with Swedish as the corresponding adjective. Their homeland (Beowulf’s Swīorīċe), however, will be referred to as Svealand, the name Sweden being reserved for a wider area corresponding in general to the territory of the modern-day country.\n\nIntroduction\n\n3\n\nOver the past century, the poem has received little attention as a source for early Scandinavian history. From an early date, a strict school of source criticism branded old Scandinavian historical sources as so unreliable that many scholars have taken care not to be caught in such dubious company. Beowulf is very much a case in point, having generally been viewed as a largely free literary creation. Rigid disciplinary boundaries within academia, meanwhile, have discouraged any engagement with the kind of cross-disciplinary research challenges which the poem presents. As an archaeologist myself, I lack philological training, and many a linguistically-schooled Beowulf expert has similar limitations when it comes to the real world in which the poem is set. The question is whether any Beowulf scholar has ever acquired the multidisciplinary skill set that the subject would benefit from. But when our academic world is so dysfunctionally organized, and we know from experience that interdisciplinary collaboration can rarely do more than scratch the surface of such shortcomings, the research community has no choice but to try to handle the dilemma of individual scholars working in a pluralist disciplinary perspective as constructively as possible. Otherwise, the ripe fruit of Beowulfiana would soon be reduced to a sadly shrivelled state. To avoid having to hear it from someone else, I would metaphorically describe myself here as an old mongrel picking up the scents of all the other dogs in the neighbourhood before retiring to the safety of its basket to pronounce its unabashed verdict. Regarding the meaning of the text, it is not possible to rely on individual translations, however excellent they may be, or even a handful of them. In my work on this book, I have made use of some forty different renderings, primarily into modern English, Swedish, Danish, German, and a few other languages. It is always necessary, though, to consult the original Old English text. Where there has been the slightest doubt, I have myself—with the help of grammars, dictionaries and glossaries—analysed the original text as presented in the fourth edition of Frederick Klaeber’s Beowulf and the Fight at Finnsburg, edited by Robert D. Fulk, Robert E. Bjork, and John D. Niles (Fulk et al. 2009), but with the occasional side glance at the text editions of Jack (1994), Wrenn and Bolton (1996) and Alexander (2005). The original Old English text of Beowulf contains much that is unclear, owing to damage to the manuscript or to misunderstandings, losses, omissions, or additions in connection with the oral or written transmission of the poem in centuries past. The fact that the manuscript is largely devoid of punctuation can also make for ambiguity. In modernday editions, more than 5 percent of all the words in the poem are usually emended in some way—albeit often credibly—with reference to such circumstances. In Beowulf: A Glossed Text, Michael Alexander presents an explanatory list of all such changes in his own version of the text (Alexander 2005, xix f., 219–29). In addition to all this, there are gaps in our understanding of the cultural and ideological frames of reference of the time and in our knowledge of the Old English language. Yet another problem is that the poem is known from only one manuscript. All these things combined mean that creating a modern-language version of the Old English text involves a significant element of interpretation. No translation, however good, can ever be regarded as definitive. Some remarks on terminology. Owing to the negative connotations frequently associated with words like “pagan” or “heathen” in early Christian texts, the term “pre-\n\n4\n\nChapter 1\n\nChristian” is now often used. But as there is nothing pejorative about the scholarly term “pagan,” and as a suggested alternative such as “Norse polytheism” (Sturtevant 2012) does not come with a manageable adjective, I will follow the tradition in Beowulf scholarship of not regarding this as a problem and will use “pagan” and “pre-Christian” as synonyms. I must also confess to my unhistorical use of the term “Scandinavian” as a synonym of “Norse” or “Nordic.” On the other hand, this has had official sanction since as early as 1946, when a certain Nordic airline was established, and it is also widely used internationally. The term “Anno Domini” (ad) is now often replaced with the religiously neutral “Common Era” (ce). But as this innovation seems to me to be completely lacking in semantic logic, I stubbornly persist in using the traditional terminology. The expression “Middle Iron Age” is used here to bracket together what Scandinavian archaeologists refer to as the Roman Iron Age (ad 1–375) and the Migration Period (375–550), while the “Late Iron Age” covers the Merovingian/Vendel (550–750) and Viking periods (750–1050). References to the original text are given in footnotes in the form of line numbers based on the edition of Fulk et al. (2009). I use the expression “the Christian voice” to refer, not to some imagined Christian author of the poem, but to what I regard as the end result of a Christian reworking of the Beowulf tradition. Nor is the phrase to be confused with Stanley Greenfield’s broader concept of “the authenticating voice” (Greenfield 1976). The results of this study are presented as a three-stage argument, based on a qualitative assessment of the source material in relation to the purpose of the work, which is to try to assess where, when, and how Beowulf was created as a poem. The crucial step in that process is to date the historical, archaeological, and linguistic content of the poem and to characterize its material world (Chapters 3–6). As a second stage in my primary analysis, I investigate the ideological, geographical, and topographical setting of the story, the family relations between its protagonists, the composition of the narrative, and more besides (Chapters 7–12). Based on the results of this primary examination, I go on to undertake a wide-ranging analysis of its implications, which, in places, but not throughout, is more hypothetical in character (Chapters 13–22). The conclusion about the origins of the poem that is drawn from the primary analysis, it should be noted, is entirely independent of the subsequent consideration of the implications of that analysis.\n\nChapter 2\n\nTHE ORIGINS OF THE POEM Research into other early European epic poetry, such as the Iliad, the Odyssey, and the Nibelungenlied, was long marked by a controversy between “Unitarians,” who primarily regarded these works as composed by great poets, and “Analysts,” who viewed them chiefly as the result of a long oral poetic tradition. In the case of Beowulf, that controversy was relatively short-lived. While Thorkelí�n (1815) and Ettmüller (1840) took it virtually for granted that the poem was a direct translation into Old English from ancient Norse oral tradition, as early a writer as Grundtvig believed it to be the work of an Old English poet (Grundtvig 1820). One of the last scholars to argue, chiefly on linguistic grounds, that the poem essentially reflected a Scandinavian oral tradition was Gregor Sarrazin (1888, 1897). For a long time, then, Beowulf has generally been considered to have been composed in writing by an Old English Christian poet, working on the basis of Scandinavian narrative traditions he had come into contact with in some unknown way (Chadwick 1912; Chambers 1932; Magoun 1953; Farrell 1972; Bruce-Mitford 1974, 1975, 1986; Sorrel 1992; Newton 1993; Hill 2002; North 2007; Fulk et al. 2009, clxxxi–clxxxiii). This premise is generally considered so self-evident, however, that it is rarely put into words. An evaluative survey of two hundred years of Beowulf scholarship (Fulk et al. 2009) reports no modern-day research expressing a fundamentally different opinion. The same view prevails in Scandinavia. The Swedish Nationalencyklopedin is in no doubt at all: “The poem was composed by an unknown Old English poet” (Frykman 1990). Opinions on the subject are not entirely uniform, however: It is likely that the poem’s composition had more than one oral stage and more than one written stage. The poem has a decided unity, but the argument from design does not prove the existence of a single designer. Although it is by no means required that we renounce the idea of a single author, to talk of “the Beowulf-poet” is to oversimplify […] much of the poem may have been available in oral verse tradition before a monk dipped his quill in ink. (Alexander 2005, xi)\n\nAs one of several possibilities, Kenneth Sisam has suggested that the poem was originally composed orally in England and recited orally for a time, before being written down (Sisam 1965, 67). John D. Niles, for his part, speaks of a complex background of oral poetry and various scenarios for the poem’s preservation in writing (Niles 1997). With the exception of Edward B. Irving (1989), however, few more recent scholars appear to regard Beowulf as essentially an oral tradition that has been written down. And whatever hybrid oral/written background is assumed, it is difficult to find any Beowulf scholar who argues that the poem represents what from the outset was a coherent Scandinavian oral tradition. Some Scandinavian archaeologists though, such as Gad Rausing (1985) and Lotte Hedeager (2011, 182), seem—based on the way the poem clearly reflects Migration Period Scandinavia—to tacitly assume an underlying Scandinavian oral tradition.\n\n6\n\nChapter 2\n\nA good many scholars have identified East Anglia during the Sutton Hoo period in the early seventh century, or later, as a likely point of entry for the Scandinavian traditions that must in some way be behind the poem. The basic reason why Beowulf is considered to have been written by an Old English poet is of course that it has been preserved in Old English in a manuscript in England, and that it contains a number of clear Christian elements and sentiments. That might seem reason enough. But no proposition is so compelling as to be exempt from the need for closer examination, something which in this case has hardly been attempted since the days of Raymond Chambers (Chambers 1932). Since then, many a seagull has circled over the waves of the North Sea. Once the idea that the poem had been composed by an Old English poet had taken hold in the late nineteenth century, it soon became an axiom. We search in vain in modern times for any coherent scholarly reasoning in favour of the proposition. When, once in a while, a factual argument is actually put forward, it is usually done in passing, as part of a survey of earlier research. Apart from the fact that the poem is preserved in Old English and contains certain Christian elements, the only arguments of any weight seem to be along the lines of “the style and sentiments of Scandinavian verse are very far from those of Beowulf,” or the extant Scandinavian material is so much later, its most ancient ingredients, if truly ancient, so fragmentary, that no valid view can be formed of the nature of Scandinavian, presumably East Norse heroic poetry of the eighth, ninth or tenth centuries. (Stanley 1994, 13)\n\nThe comparison should not, though, primarily be with late Old Norse poetry, but with Scandinavian tradition with roots in the Middle Iron Age, such as certain legendary sagas (fornaldarsǫgur) and early eddic poems, which if anything have greater similarities to Beowulf than to late Old Norse poetry. And as for that argument, there is no early Old English work of poetry with an Anglo-Saxon storyline that is the least bit comparable to Beowulf.\n\nThe Legacy of Tolkien\n\nThe fact that, despite certain Christian elements, the poem reflects what is clearly a pagan world was long considered embarrassing to the theory of a Christian poet composing for Christian readers and audiences. One critical school also laid a good many factual contradictions and other literary “weaknesses” at the door of the poem’s author. But after J. R. R. Tolkien had given his famous lecture on Beowulf to the British Academy on 25 November 1936, everything changed. Tolkien argued that the poem was a carefully considered and well-balanced work of poetry by a great author and thinker, which should primarily be assessed as a poem and not subjected to antiquarian, philological, and mythological dissection with a view to elucidating its origins. The fact that the story unfolds in a past age in a remote, pagan Scandinavia was thus not a contradiction, but could be seen as a deliberate device, used by a great author to achieve an effective poetic dynamic (Tolkien 1936).\n\nThe Origins of the Poem\n\n7\n\nBeowulf is full of contradictory features large and small, which often used to be held against the poet as evidence of poor authorship, but which, following Tolkien, are now frequently viewed as carefully thought-out literary devices. Not until Beowulf scholarship had recovered from the Second World War did the reaction come, but when it did, it came with a vengeance. Although Tolkien did not hide the fact that his view sprang mostly from an artistic feeling, his contribution was welcomed as cutting the Gordian knot that had long fettered the theory of an Old English Christian author. The effect was dramatic. Rarely has the expression “paradigm shift” been more apt. At a single elegant stroke, Tolkien had consigned the whole question of critical scrutiny of the poem’s origins to the academic scrapheap. There it cowers to this day, discarded and despised: Tolkien’s achievement was to salvage Beowulf from the hand of critics who were blind to the factor that made the poem great. It is hard to imagine, but Beowulf was once studied either as Scandinavian history, a repository of artefacts for archaeologists or as an archive of Old English linguistic features and grammatical forms. In his own day Tolkien helped to rescue the poem for posterity. (Tolley 2007, 48)\n\nAnd yet, since that time, Tolkien’s thesis has not been backed up with scholarly evidence any more than he himself did, which is to say, basically not at all. Tolkien did not assess Beowulf primarily as an expert in the Old English language, but as the empathetic writer, mythologist, and mystic he is also remembered as. In Tolkien’s footsteps, a significant branch of Beowulf scholarship has developed a sophisticated psychology of literature that interprets practically everything in the poem as evidence of the assumed author’s literary and ideological intentions and cultural background. If we add together everything that has been attributed to that author, we end up with a literary genius unique in the Germanic world of his (or her) day. In 1953 Francis Magoun Jr. threw a fistful of grit in the wheels with his analysis of the formulaic language of the poem, based on Milman Parry and Albert Lord’s interpretations of Homeric and late South Slavic oral epic. Magoun claimed that the poem had emerged as a result of several different oral traditions about the figure of Beowulf being woven together secondarily into a larger work of poetry (Magoun 1953; cf. 1959 and 1963), an analysis which Albert Lord himself found convincing: The formulaic character of the Old English Beowulf has been proved beyond any doubt by a series of analyses beginning with my own in 1949 […], which Professor Magoun improved and elaborated in 1953 […] and which Professor Creed has carried to its ultimate detailed conclusion. […] The documentation is complete, thorough, and accurate. This exhaustive analysis is in itself sufficient to prove that Beowulf was composed orally. (Lord 1960, 198)\n\nMagoun did not say so in so many words, but reading between the lines of several of his works we get the impression that he believed the story to be chiefly Scandinavian in origin. His analysis certainly rocked the boat, but with its somewhat uncritical application of Lord and Parry’s interpretive model, it did not have a lasting impact on the general view that the poem had been composed independently and in writing by an Old English poet.\n\n8\n\nChapter 2\n\nIn these end times, however, Tolkien’s proposition about the poem having a carefully considered literary structure has once again begun to be questioned. Tom Shippey, for instance, after noting certain Scandinavian features in the names occurring in the poem, has highlighted a number of compositional deficiencies that seem incompatible with the idea of an Old English author, while also cautiously resuscitating the question of a possible oral background to the poem (Shippey 2014). Nevertheless, by far the dominant interpretation has long been that Beowulf is an independent and uniform work of poetry, written by a learned, Christian Old English poet on the basis of scattered remnants of Scandinavian and broader Germanic traditions: Beowulf is the work of a great artist, a work carefully planned and organized, excellent in form and structure, and composed with a sense of style unique in the poet’s age […] I regard the work as composed in writing, and the author as trained in the art of the scop and educated as a clerk. In him the best of pagan antiquity and of the Christian culture of his time had fused; and we have in his work an achievement unequaled in English poetry before Chaucer. (Brodeur 1959, viii) The poet composed, I believe, at court; he surely was well educated, sophisticated and aristocratic. He knew the old heroic legends and traditions; he was a man of the world as well as of the court; he was a Christian. (Brady 1983, 202)\n\nIf he was a monk or other professional religious—which is a reasonable hypothesis—he obviously had a great affection for the things and values of the secular world […] If he was a chieftain or court poet or itinerant singer wandering, like the fictional bard Widsith, from court to court—another possible hypothesis, though possibly a less likely one—he certainly had a deep vein of spirituality. (Ringler 2007, xcvii)\n\nDespite being on the international scholarly wanted list for two hundred years, this supposed poet remains so shadowy and elusive that Homer seems almost of flesh and blood by comparison. That the author of a major opus such as Beowulf should have remained anonymous, while lesser poets such as Cædmon and Cynewulf are known to posterity by name, may of course be due to the indiscriminate gnawing of the tooth of time. But the fact that most other Old English and early Germanic literary works are equally anonymous does nonetheless raise the question whether what we are looking for is indeed an author in the proper sense of that word. Naturally, a narrative tradition is stripped of all historical credibility as it passes through the literary peristalsis of a creative mind. And the axiom of an Old English poet has certainly robbed Beowulf of any legitimacy as a historical document (see for example Gahrn 1986; Søby Christensen 2005; DickHarrison 2009)—so much so that in Scandinavia it is scarcely considered meaningful even to subject it to source-critical scrutiny. The legacy of Tolkien weighs heavily on the poem. A very long time ago, Bernhard ten Brink claimed that the striking “grace” (Behagen), “clarity” (Klarheit), “gentleness” (Milde), and “refinement” (Verfeinung) of Beowulf ruled out the possibility of any other Germanic setting for its origins than Anglo-Saxon England (ten Brink 1888, 181). But few today would probably subscribe to such an idyllization of the work. On the other hand, it is sometimes pointed out that it deviates so much in style and spirit from later Scandinavian poetry that an early Norse original is out of the question. But then we also need to ask ourselves why the poem differs so\n\nThe Origins of the Poem\n\n9\n\nmuch from all other known Old English poetry, and why there is no comparable Old English heroic epic on an Old English theme. And anyway, it shows significant similarities to some of the Norse legendary sagas and eddic poems that reflect events from the same Migration Period as Beowulf. The Old English of the manuscript is the southern English dialect known as Late West Saxon. At the same time, though, the text is full of traces of older Anglian dialects from eastern and central England. This contradictory picture points us now in one, now in another direction, in a way which for a long time made agreement on when, how, and where Beowulf was composed impossible. It has consequently been suggested that, to create the right archaic mood, the author may have deliberately garnished the poem with outdated linguistic features from different dialect areas. But such a notion of an erudite philologist gone astray is something most scholars seem to recoil from. Usually, they are more inclined to believe that the author deliberately made use of a common, archaic poetic language, a kind of Old English koine (as outlined in Fulk et al. 2009, clxv– clxvii), an idea that has also come in for criticism, however (Megginson 1992).\n\nAim and Starting Point of the Study\n\nAfter two hundred years of research, one might imagine that there would be little left to say about Beowulf. The reason I nonetheless attempt a more comprehensive study here of the question of the poem’s origins, however, is that this particular field has long lain fallow. Critical light has not been shed on it for a very long time, if indeed it ever has. My aim is to see whether it is not after all possible to arrive at a more evidence-based assessment of a question that has to be considered crucial to any interpretation of the poem. Only after this problem has been more fully investigated will there be a basis for an in-depth literary analysis of the meaning, aims and background of Beowulf. The Scandinavian “analogues” or “parallels” to the poem that have often been highlighted (Chambers 1932, 129–95, 451–85, 491–503; Garmondsway et al. 1980; Theodore Andersson 1997, 129–34, 146–48; Fulk et al. 2009, 294–307, 313–15) are of course of interest to Beowulfian scholarship. But after a very long period of transmission, they are so watered down and full of contradictions that they tend to obscure rather than illuminate the central question of the poem’s origins. In this work, therefore, they will only be taken into account in exceptional cases and secondarily. But it is a crucial fact that such traditions are preserved only in Scandinavia. Nor can consideration be given to parallels in Celtic, classical, or other literary traditions, which have sometimes been held up as sources of inspiration for the Beowulf poet. Such parallels only become relevant if it can be established that the poem was indeed composed independently by an Old English poet. The question of its origins should thus primarily be assessed in the light of the poem’s own testimony and other reasonably contemporary and relevant linguistic, historical, and archaeological sources. The language of Beowulf is Old English and the poem contains certain Christian elements. And yet there is not a trace of Anglo-Saxon tradition in the narrative. The geographical and historical context is purely Scandinavian and the society depicted is fundamentally pagan. Although such a contradiction virtually cries out for attention,\n\n10\n\nChapter 2\n\nit is one of the least discussed of all the problems surrounding the poem. It is as if the question is considered to have been settled once and for all. In fact, it has never been thoroughly investigated. Ever since the idea that Beowulf was composed by an Old English poet took root in the late nineteenth century, it has persisted undisturbed, with no detailed argument put forward either for or against it. Any appreciable discussion of what elements in the poem could draw on Scandinavian tradition and what aspects of its content, apart from its Christian features, could reflect the mindset of an Old English poet is equally hard to find. The time is now ripe to turn the question round the other way and ask: Is there any source material that offers scholarly support for the view that Beowulf was composed in England?\n\nChapter 3\n\nSOME UNPROVEN PREMISES After a lifetime’s work on the poem, the leading light of Beowulf research, Frederick Klaeber, took the view that its basic themes were drawn entirely from Scandinavian tradition: That the themes of the main story, i.e. the contest with the Grendel race and the fight with the dragon, are of direct Scandinavian provenience, may be regarded as practically certain. The same origin is to be assigned to the distinctly historical episodes of the SwedishGeatish wars of which no other traces can be found in England. (Klaeber 1950, cxiv and cf. cxv)\n\nAs these themes provide a good summary of the main storyline of the poem, Klaeber clearly believed that the Old English author had not contributed anything at all to the basic elements of the narrative. The reason no one, to my knowledge, has argued against Klaeber’s view, or even commented on it, could of course be that it is a hot potato. But it would seem, rather, that the question has simply gone stone-cold, and Klaeber himself never pursued it any further. Nearly a dozen of the rulers and princes of the Danes and Swedes who appear in the poem also figure in various Scandinavian sources, and the Geatish king Hygelac turns up in continental sources. Most of these individuals can thus be regarded with reasonable confidence as historical figures of the late fifth and the first half of the sixth century, the end of the Migration Period. In parallel with this, the poem reads almost as a handbook on the material and ideological world of Scandinavia at that time. Beowulf represents a clearly demarcated historical and archaeological framework of considerable credibility. The question that then has to be asked, but hardly ever is, is this: how did an Old English author get hold of this information about historical, material, and other conditions in Scandinavia? I will leave aside here the possibility of the pious monk who is usually identified as the author of Beowulf having made a study trip to the pagans of eastern Scandinavia to collect traditional material for his epic. Nor, to my knowledge, has such a highly improbable scenario ever been suggested. And the only option that then remains is to assume that it was in England that the imagined poet learned of Scandinavian oral traditions about events and settings in eastern Scandinavia in the first half of the sixth century. Very rarely, though, do we see this premise expressed in so many words. The problem is that there is very little trace of such traditions in other AngloSaxon writings—including early Anglo-Saxon literature in Latin—which after all, taken together, are almost ten times more extensive than Beowulf.1 1 Here I disregard the short, independent Finnsburg Fragment, which deals with the same theme as the Finn Episode in Beowulf. It does not touch on the main theme of the poem, and the two texts also clearly reflect independent traditions concerning the same event (Amodio 2014, 323–26).\n\n12\n\nChapter 3\n\nThe surviving Old English poem Widsith consists mainly of unsorted lists of European peoples and rulers which Widsith, “the widely travelled one,” claims to have visited, despite a time span of several hundred years. Widsith boasts of his acquaintance with famous princes from very different periods all over Europe. As with most other Old English poetry, the language of Widsith is Late West Saxon, with older remnants of Anglian dialect, and the manuscript is from the tenth century. Orthography, choice of words and word forms, however, suggest that Widsith as a text was shaped comparatively early, no later than the eighth century (Malone 1962; Neidorf 2014c). What is more, many of the names Widsith recites, which are quite unknown to us today, are hardly tribal names in the real sense, but eponymous designations given after well-known princes, rather like the Helmings, Hrethlings, and Wægmundings of Beowulf, designations that were far too short-lived to have left any trace in other extant written sources. Widsith has a clear northwest continental and southern Scandinavian centre of gravity, consistent with Widsith’s claim to belong to the people of the Myrgings, who lived somewhere in northwestern Germany. Mention is also made here of the Danish kings Hrothgar and Hrothulf, the Danes’ great hall of Heorot, the Swedish kings Ongentheow (Egil) and Eadgils (Adils), and peoples such as the Swedes, Geats, Danes, and Heathoreams, all of them spoken of in Beowulf. But just as in Beowulf, there is nothing Anglo-Saxon in Widsith. When the Angles are mentioned, it is under the legendary Offa, long before their emigration to England. All the indications are that Widsith is a northwest continental and southern Scandinavian chronicle that was transferred to England and memorized fairly mechanically there before being committed to writing. One report in Widsith, though, can be linked to Beowulf, namely the account of how Hrothulf and Hrothgar long kept peace together, uncle and nephew, after they had driven away the race of Vikings and smashed to pieces the Heathobard army of Ingeld at Heorot. But while Widsith talks here about a victory for the Danes, in Beowulf it is claimed that the Heathobards burned down Heorot. It would seem that Widsith records a Myrging tradition about the Heathobards suffering a defeat, and Beowulf a Scandinavian tradition about them burning down Heorot. One does not rule out the other. Apart from this, Widsith contains no information about the various historical contexts that fill Beowulf, other than the fact that Ongentheow led the Swedes and Helm the Wulfings. Just like Beowulf, the historical content of Widsith ends in the transition between the Middle and the Late Scandinavian Iron Age. Nothing in Widsith can be referred to a later period than the middle of the sixth century, the time of the great famine disaster in northern Europe and the beginning of the dark transition from late antiquity to the Early Middle Ages in Europe. There is thus significant agreement between Beowulf and Widsith in terms of their chronology and geography, and the tribes and rulers referred to. In the case of Widsith, too, it is meaningless to speak of an author in the ordinary sense of the word. Widsith is primarily a continental, northwest Germanic oral chronicle of the thula type that was transferred to England and there continued to be transmitted orally in Old English, with limited reworking, before it was written down.\n\nSome Unproven Premises\n\n13\n\nKemp Malone assumes that the tradition behind Widsith arose in the northwest corner of continental Europe. The first of its three thulas, he argues, could have come into being on Funen (Fyn) in Denmark and later been transferred to England via Angles in northwestern Germany (Malone 1962). Lotte Hedeager takes the view that the entire traditional core of Widsith could originate from Gudme on Funen (Hedeager 2011), which is a perfectly reasonable idea. In my opinion, it cannot even be ruled out that the tradition behind Widsith may have reached England along similar routes to those outlined here for Beowulf, possibly even through the same tradition bearers, and been transferred into Old English and given its slight Christian colouring in a similar way. An Old English author, then, could not possibly have composed Beowulf on the basis of Widsith or any other Old English text. In Hrólfs saga kraka, Grettis Saga, Harðarsaga, Gullþóris saga, Þiðrekssaga af Bern, and the work of Saxo Grammaticus, on the other hand, there are figures and events that tie in with Beowulf, including what are generally regarded as possible reflexes of Beowulf himself. The fact that such material has only been preserved in Scandinavia, with its late literate culture, and not at all in England, with its much older literate tradition, is in itself a clear indication that the poem was composed in Scandinavia and not in England. It is surprising how rarely the questions raised by the premise of Scandinavian traditional material in England are actually asked. How and when did this material reach England and how extensive was it? Did the poet come into contact with it in Old English or an early form of Norse, and in a spoken or written form? One of the few scholars in modern times who have taken the problem of the traditional background to the poem seriously is Sam Newton. But when he claims, in his very readable book The Origins of Beowulf and the Pre-Viking Kingdom of East Anglia, that it is only in England that the Old English poet can have learnt of people and events in the poem that are not mentioned in Scandinavian sources (Newton 1993, 20–26), his argument is undermined by the fact that there are no traces of those individuals and occurrences in Anglo-Saxon sources either, and also by the fact that it is based on what was to be proved, namely that the poem was composed in England. No scholarly argument can be stronger than its weakest link. But when it comes to the assumption that Beowulf was written by an Old English poet who had access to Scandinavian traditions, there are no links at all.\n\nAn English Material Setting\n\nIt is perhaps an awareness of this deficiency that has sometimes prompted scholars to assume that the poet used his own Anglo-Saxon world as a pattern for the material world of the poem. But as the following chapters will show, that is not possible. Major elements of the material and hence also the ideological setting of the poem were simply not accessible to a poet in England during the Anglo-Saxon period (see Chapters 3–5).\n\n14\n\nChapter 3\n\nComposed in Writing From the first line to the last, Beowulf is packed full of features typical of oral literature in verse form (see Chapter 11). Much has been said about the relationship between oral and written culture in Anglo-Saxon times generally, but I have been unable to track down any study showing that Beowulf cannot have been composed orally but must have come into being in writing. Had such a study been carried out, there would have been countless references to it. At best, this sharp contradiction could be attributed to the poet having written the work making systematic use of the entire arsenal of literary devices at the disposal of oral epic. And when the “narrator” of the poem several times speaks as if to an audience, this is attributed to the poet deliberately using the literary device of expressing himself as if addressing an audience or expecting his work to be read aloud to one. Quite clearly, though, other explanations are conceivable. It seems extremely improbable that a writer during the period in question, which is dated on philological grounds to around ad 685–725, could have pulled off so advanced a literary project so consistently and on such a large scale. I am not aware of any other major contemporary work of Germanic poetry that can be said for certain to have been composed in writing in the manner assumed for Beowulf. And as far as other Old English literature is concerned, little, if any, can be said with certainty to be the result of a process of written composition. As long as the law of gravity prevails and up is up and down is down, it makes no sense to regard an abundance of traces of oral literature as a manifestation of written composition. It seems far more reasonable to me to conclude that, in all essentials, the Beowulf tradition was originally composed and transmitted orally, and only secondarily shaped into a written work.\n\nA Christian Composition\n\nWhen the pagan content of the poem is considered in relation to its Christian elements, as is attempted here (see Chapter 9), the latter strike us not only as superficial, but also as having been added secondarily, and in a contradictory manner, to what is clearly a pagan core.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe assumption that Beowulf was composed independently by an Old English poet presupposes that the poet had access to a not insignificant supply of relevant oral Scandinavian traditions. That premise fails because there are no traces of such traditions in the rest of the rich body of writings in Old English. The idea that the markedly oral character of the poem reflects a process of written composition lacks support in any comparable literary sources. As will be seen in the following, moreover, an Old English poet cannot have depicted the material culture of the poem on the basis of the world in which he himself lived and moved.\n\nSome Unproven Premises\n\n15\n\nThese three premises, which are completely crucial to the theory of an Old English author, thus seem to be no more than assumptions. The fourth premise, that Beowulf is a Christian composition, can only be upheld by ignoring the clear pagan core of the poem. It has to be asked, therefore, how the proposition that Beowulf was composed in writing by a Christian poet in England could become so firmly established. Why is it not assumed that the poem was composed orally in a secular Anglo-Saxon setting, based on Scandinavian pagan traditions, and that the Christian elements were added secondarily in the course of oral transmission or when the poem was written down or copied? One answer could be that the idea would then inevitably suggest itself that the Scandinavian tradition behind the poem in fact consisted of a coherent oral Scandinavian poem that was secondarily transferred into Old English. So, if one wishes to avoid that conclusion, it has to be assumed that the poem was composed in writing. And since, in early Anglo-Saxon times, fluency in writing was almost exclusively confined to Christian settings, there is nothing for it but to claim that the poem was composed by a Christian poet. One thing implies the other.\n\nChapter 4\n\nDATING OF THE POEM The question of Beowulf’s origins is usually addressed in a comparative philological and literary perspective, and only rarely from a historical and archaeological point of view. But as a comparative literary study presupposes what first has to be proved, namely that the poem was written by an Old English author, such an approach cannot be considered before the problem of the origins of the work has been thoroughly investigated. Our next step, then, must be to consider what the linguistic, historical, and archaeological source material relating to the poem has to tell us. Manuscript\n\nThe only preserved manuscript, written in Anglo-Saxon minuscule, is generally—and chiefly on palaeographic grounds—considered to have been produced by two scribes, some time around 1000–1010 (Fulk et al. 2009, xxv ff.). There have been countless discussions about possible earlier manuscripts. For a long time, there has been significant agreement that the surviving manuscript was preceded by at least one older one. A view now embraced by many scholars, based on lexical, orthographic, palaeographic, and other criteria, is that the preserved text shows traces of at least one earlier manuscript from the period just before or after ad 700 (Neidorf 2014a).\n\nLinguistic Dating\n\nGiven the premise that Beowulf was written by an Old English poet, efforts to date it have quite naturally focused on philological evidence. The language of the poem is primarily Late West Saxon, the southern English dialect that was the leading literary language of England from the later part of the ninth century onwards. As has been mentioned, though, there are also archaic dialectal features that point back in time to the Anglian areas of Northumbria, Mercia, and East Anglia. A long-standing consensus that the poem was created in the eighth century, or just before or after that, evaporated at a conference in Toronto in 1980 (Chase 1981), marking the start of a long period in which many scholars, not least on literary grounds, advocated a later dating, often placing the poem in the late Viking Age (Davis 2006; North 2007; Frank 2007; Damico 2015). Beowulf has thus been dated to anything from 600 to 1100 (Drout et al. 2014). Mention should also be made of an agnostic school, now almost extinct, which took a pessimistic view of ever being able to date the poem: I readily confess that I should be at a loss to tell when, where, by whom, and under what circumstances, this greatest of all early-Germanic epics was composed. (Renoir 1986, 68)\n\n18\n\nChapter 4\n\nI now consider it axiomatic that the problem of the poem’s date is insoluble. (Earl 1994, 16–17) The embarrassment, even the scandal of Old English scholarship is not merely that we have no accepted date for Beowulf but that we cannot even agree on a century. (Howe 1997, 216) Until new facts surface, all we can say with assurance when asked when, by whom and for whom the poem was composed is that we are not sure. (Bjork and Obermeier 1997, 33)\n\nmost problems, from the existence of God to the dating of Beowulf, are just too hard for us, involving propositions that we can neither prove nor refute. (Frank 2007, 863)\n\nAs already noted, however, the pendulum has now swung back—with a vengeance—to an earlier dating. The shift began with Robert D. Fulk’s authoritative A History of Old English Meter (Fulk 1992), which highlighted a number of archaic linguistic and poetic features in Beowulf, especially its strict metrical use of vowel endings in accordance with “Kaluza’s law” (Kaluza 1909; cf. Neidorf and Pasqual 2014). Fulk drew the conclusion that the poem could not have been composed later than 825 if it was Northumbrian in origin, and not later than 725 if Mercian in origin, which in his view was the likelier alternative. In recent years, based on an overall assessment of various features of the poem, Fulk himself (2014) and scholars such as Leonard Neidorf (2013a, 2013b, 2014b, 2014c, 2015), Tom Shippey (2014), Megan Hartman (2014), Thomas Bredehoft (2014), George Clark (2014), and Aaron Ecay and Susan Pintzuk (2016) have concluded that it was circulating in England no later than some time between 685 and 725. Crucially, this conclusion, unlike many earlier ones, is not based on individual elements, but on an overall appraisal of a great many archaic metrical, lexical, semantic, syntactic, onomastic,1 orthographic, and palaeographic features, in other words, on a whole series of mutually largely independent factors, whose cumulative testimony seems difficult to ignore. For the first time in two hundred years, the dating of the text of Beowulf appears to stand on comparatively firm ground, cut free from a tangle of contradictory arguments based on individual factors and intuitive impressions. It is understandable, therefore, if Leonard Neidorf (2015) bristles when such weighty documentation is brushed aside in favour of loose allegories of socio-political conditions in England that allegedly place the poem after 1040 (Damico 2015). Here, though, an important point must be added. The conclusion that can be drawn from this is not that the story of Beowulf was composed in the late seventh or early eighth century, only that it was circulating in England at that time. This is because, given the lack of early Old English texts for comparison, it would be impossible to trace the poem further back in time using linguistic evidence, even if the story were older. In such circumstances, there is nothing for it but to go back to square one—and the neglected business of assessing the historical and archaeological content of the poem.\n\n1 More specifically, misspelt personal names.\n\nHistorical Dating\n\nDating of the Poem\n\n19\n\nThe only textual points of reference for a more precise historical dating of the events of Beowulf, noted by as early a scholar as Grundtvig (1820), are two Frankish sources, the Libri historiarum decem and the Liber historiae Francorum, which tie in with the poem’s account of King Hygelac’s death in Frisia. At the end of the poem, as Beowulf looks back on his life, there are several references to how, after some initial successes on a raid against Frisia, Hygelac was killed, how Beowulf himself slew the man who killed Hygelac, and how he finally managed to make his way home across the sea.2 The Libri historiarum decem (ed. Krusch and Levison 1951; Gregory of Tours, ed. Buchner 1956) was the work of Gregory of Tours, who lived from 539 to 594. The section of interest here (book 3, chap. 3), probably written in 573–575 (Gregory of Tours, ed. Buchner 1956, xxi), reads: His ita gestis, Dani cum rege suo nomen Chlochilaichum evectu navale per mare Gallias appetunt. Egressique ad terras, pagum unum de regno Theudorici devastant atque captivant, oneratisque navibus tam de captivis quam de reliquis spoliis, reverti ad patriam cupiunt; sed rex eorum in litus resedebat, donec navis alto mare conprae- henderent, ipse deinceps secuturus. Quod cum Theudorico nuntiatum fuisset, quod scilicet regio eius fuerit ab extraneis devastata, Theudobertum, filium suum, in illis partibus cum valido exercitu ac magnum armorum apparatu direxit. Qui, interfectu rege, hostibus navali proelio superatis oppraemit omnemque rapinam terrae restituit. (ed. Krusch and Levison 1951, 99)\n\nAfter these events, the Danes with their king Chlochilaich sailed with a fleet across the sea to Gaul. After they had landed, they plundered part of Theuderic’s kingdom and took prisoners. When they had loaded their ships with prisoners and other spoils, they prepared to return to their native land. But their king remained on the shore while waiting for the ships to reach deep water, intending then to follow them. When Theuderic heard that his country had been ravaged by foreigners, he sent his son Theudebert with a large, well-equipped army. He killed the king and subsequently beat the enemies, defeating them in a naval battle and returning all the booty to the land. The Liber historiae Francorum is an anonymous text from around 727, written in halting Latin and, as far as the section in question (19) is concerned, based mainly on Gregory, though with minor additions: In illo tempore Dani cum rege suo Chochilaico cum navale hoste per alto mare Gallias appetent, Theuderico paygo Attoarios vel alios devastantes atque captivantes, plenas naves de captivis alto mare intrantens rex eorum ad litus maris resednes. Quod cum Theuderico nuntiatum fuisset Theudobertum, ilium suum, cum magno exercitu in illis partibus dirigens. Qui consequens eos, pugnavit cum eis caede magna atque prostravit, regem eorem interficit, preda tullit et in terra sua restituit. (ed. Krusch 1888)\n\nAt that time, the Danes, with their king Chochilaic, came with a large hostile fleet across the sea to Gaul, where they laid waste and took prisoners in the land of the Attoarii and other parts of Theuderic’s kingdom. After they had filled their ships with prisoners and plunder they headed out onto the open sea, while their king remained on the shore. When this was reported to Theuderic, he sent his son Theudebert to the area with a\n\n2 2355–69, 2500–10, 2910–22.\n\n20\n\nChapter 4\n\nlarge army. Having pursued them, he fought with them in a great and bloody battle and overwhelmed them, killed their king, took back all the booty and returned it to the land where it belonged.\n\nA point to be noted here is that the tribe of the Attoarii referred to in the passage, who lived just upstream of the mouth of the Rhine, would appear to correspond to the Hetware mentioned in Beowulf in connection with Hygelac’s death.3 This is consistent with the chronicles’ accounts of the event taking place in the Austrasian part of the Frankish realm where Theuderic was king. It should also be mentioned that Dæghrefn, the name of the man who, according to the poem4, takes Hygelac’s life and is then himself killed by Beowulf, is a typically Frankish and not an Old English name, a fact which, according to Klaeber, lends a note of authenticity to the poem’s account of Hygelac’s raid on the Hetware (Klaeber 1950, 215). Beowulf also refers several times to the Frisians as Hygelac’s enemies.5 Remains of a number of defensive works along the coasts of northwestern Gaul and southern England from the first half of the first millennium (Higham and Ryan 2013, 34–36) suggest that Hygelac’s raid was not the first seaborne plundering expedition by a North Germanic tribe in this area. According to the poem, after Beowulf’s death the Geats can expect enmity from mere wīo ingasmilts, an expression that is usually transcribed as merewīonges(as)6 and generally interpreted as “the Merovingian/ Merovingians.” Linguistically, that conclusion is perhaps not entirely compelling (Stanley 1997, 201), but it is consistent with the chronicles’ references to Hygelac doing battle with Theudebert, who was of the Merovingian dynasty, and with the tribal name Hūgas in the poem,7 which can scarcely refer to anyone other than the Franks (Goffart, Walter 1981. Hetware and Hugas; Datable anachronisms in Beowulf. In: Chase 1981, pp. 83–100; Fulk et al. 2009, 310). According to the Liber monstrorum de diversis generibus (book 1, chap. 2) from around 700 or at any rate 650–750 (Lapidge 1982), which is extant in several ninth- and tenth-century manuscripts, the gigantic skeleton of a king Higlac[us] of the tribe of the “Getae,” who had died in a raid in the area, is preserved at the mouth of the Rhine: De Hyglaco Getorum rege. Et fiunt (monstra) mirae magnitudinis, ut rex Higlacus, qui imperavit Getis et a Francis occisus est, quem equus a duodecimo aetatis anno portare non potuit; cuius ossa in Rheni fluminis insula, ubi in Oceanum prorumpit, reservata sunt et de longinquo venientibus pro miraculo ostenduntur. (Lapidge 1982, 176–77)\n\nOf Hygelac, King of the Geats. And there are [monsters] of enormous size, such as King Hygelac who ruled over the Geats and who was killed by the Franks, and whom, when he was twelve years old, no horse had the strength to carry. His bones are preserved on an island at the mouth of the river Rhine, where they are shown as a wonder to visitors from afar. 3 2363, 2916\n\n4 2501.\n\n5 1207, 2912, 2915. 6 2921.\n\n7 2502, 2914.\n\nDating of the Poem\n\n21\n\nThere seems to be a consensus that, for linguistic, geographical, and other reasons, the expression Higlacus, qui imperavit Getis cannot refer to the Getae, a people of the lower Danube just to the west of the Black Sea, but—as indicated in the translation above—to the Geats. Another point of agreement between the Liber monstrorum and Beowulf is that both sources state that many Geats were killed in these battles and that Hygelac’s body remained in the country of the Franks. Gregory’s reference to Hygelac as the king of the Danes is only seemingly problematic. Hygelac could scarcely have embarked on a plundering expedition against Frisia without collaboration with, and perhaps even some involvement on the part of, the Danes. Presumably, moreover, both the Frisians and the Franks had past experience of Danes as uninvited guests along their coasts. When Hygelac is referred to in the Liber monstrorum as king of the “Getae,” the reference, as noted, is very probably to the Geats. The assumption made by Magoun (1954b) and Lapidge (1982), that the account in the Liber monstrorum was influenced to some extent by the Old English Beowulf tradition, has been dismissed by Augustine Thompson, who firmly puts the case for an influence from Frisian tradition (Thompson 2001). His argument is supported by Timothy Burbery’s conclusion that the enormous bones which according to the Liber monstrorum were the long-preserved remains of Hygelac, shown to visitors as a remarkable curiosity, were in all likelihood bones of a woolly mammoth from the last ice age, which have been found in large quantities in the area in question. Certain parts of a mammoth’s skeleton are also surprisingly similar to human bones (Burbery 2015). Nothing is said in the poem or in Frankish sources about Hygelac having been a particularly large man. The striking links between Beowulf and the Frankish chronicles, and the lack of any evidence of mutual dependence between these sources, mean that there are few sceptical voices regarding their credibility on the subject of Hygelac’s military expeditions. One scholar with a more critical view, however, is the historian Arne Søby Christensen. He argues that the spelling of the name Chlochilaicus varies so widely that it is debatable whether it has anything to do with Hygelac/Hugleikr (Søby Christensen 2005). According to philologists, though, the variation is within reasonable bounds: Chlochilaicus, Chlochilaico, Chlochilaicho, Chochilaico, Chochilaco, Chrochilaico and Hrodolaicum in Gregory of Tours, and Chochilaico, Chochelaico, Chochilago, Hlodilago, Chodilaico, Chrodilaico, Chlochilaico and Chodilaico in the Liber historiae Francorum (Fulk et al. 2009, 310). As Klaeber observes, spellings such as Chlochilaicus and Chochilaicus differ only insignificantly “from the true form which we should expect *Chogilaicus” (Klaeber 1950, xli n1). Phonologically, in other words, Chochilaich is generally considered to correspond to Old Norse (ON) Hugleikr and the poem’s Old English (OE) form Hyġelāc. Even if it cannot be considered proven that Chlochilaicus and Chochilaicus are the same person as the Hygelac of the poem, it is highly likely that they are. Little weight should be attached, moreover, to the argument that information in the Liber historiae Francorum that is not found in Gregory, such as the reference to the Attoarii, must have been invented, as there are no other sources to confirm it (Søby Christensen 2005). Such information could of course go back to both written and oral traditions that have not been preserved.\n\n22\n\nChapter 4\n\nAnother of Søby Christensen’s arguments is that we cannot give credence to Beowulf’s story of Hygelac in Frisia, since the rest of the poem is full of fantastical and supernatural elements. One objection that can be raised to that view is that the stories of Grendel, Grendel’s mother, and the Serpent neither relate to the historical content of the poem nor “rub off” on its description of material and ideological settings. What is more, as I will show later, these “mythical” elements are probably not all that mythical, but can be traced to a use of metaphor typical of the time, which in the course of transmission came to be understood as intended literally. In the same way, the obscure accounts of Beowulf’s return from Frisia, swimming with the armor of thirty men over his arm, may be assumed to have originally reflected a real-life sea crossing in an oared ship (see Chapter 20). Based on the narrative sequence in Gregory, Hygelac’s death was previously dated to the years 510–515, but is now usually considered to have occurred in 521–526 (Storms 1970; Farrell 1982, 189–90, 210; Fulk et al. 2009, 311). After carefully weighing the sources, however, as early a writer as Chambers concluded that Hygelac may have died closer to 530 (Chambers 1932, 381–87). The same view is made clear by the title of Francis Magoun’s article “The Geography of Hygelac’s Raid on the Lands of the West Frisians and the Haettware, ca 530 a.d.,” although Magoun does not set out the arguments for it in his text (Magoun 1954a). Søby Christensen, too, has proposed a date in the late 520s, with a preference for 530. He refers for example to the fact that, judging from Gregory, Theuderic (who reigned from 511 to 534) does not appear to have entrusted his son Theudebert with any other missions as a military commander until the later part of his reign (Søby Christensen 2005, 65). I can find only one other such reference in Gregory, which notes that Theudebert was put in charge of waging war against the Visigoths in Spain around 532 (Gregory, book 3, chap. 21). Little is known about the years of birth of these Merovingians. Theudebert is often considered to have been born some time around 505, sometimes as late as 512. His mother Eustere tends to be assigned birth dates between 488 and 496. Only the earliest of these dates is compatible with as early a year of birth for Theudebert as 505. That he may have been born later is also suggested by the fact that he was only engaged (to Wisigard) and became a father in 530 and that he was not married (to Deuteria) until 533 (Gregory of Tours, book 3, chaps. 20 and 22). Even if the precocious Frankish kingsto-be of the time may have been given formal responsibility for wars at a young age, it is probably safe to assume that their voices would at least have broken before they were personally put in command of large armies. The little we know about Theudebert’s early life, then, gives us good reason to assume that Hygelac’s death in Frisia did not occur until around 530, plus or minus a couple of years. In Chapter 22 I argue that the main events of the poem take place within twenty to twenty-five years of Hygelac’s death. Alongside Hygelac (Hugleik(r)), the Danish kings Healfdene (Hálfdan(r)), Halga (Helgi/Helghe), Hrothgar (Hróarr/Ro), and Hrothulf (Hrólfr/Rolf), and the Swedish kings Ongentheo(w) (Angantýr/Egil), Ohthere (Ó� ttarr/Ottar), Onela (Á� li/Ale), and Eadgils (Aðils/Adils) can also reasonably confidently be regarded, based on other his-\n\nDating of the Poem\n\n23\n\ntorical sources, as historical figures from the late Migration Period (Klaeber 1950, xxx– xlv; Chadwick and Chadwick 1932, 135ff.; Malone 1962, 126–216). The fact that Eadgils may have been a king of the Swedes some years into the early Vendel Period is immaterial in this context, as Beowulf only follows him up to the time he comes to power. The information in the poem about two parallel royal dynasties among the Danes (the Scyldings, or Skjǫldungs) and the Swedes (the Scilfings/Scylfings, or Skilfings)8 during the second half of the Migration Period seems quite plausible in historical terms. The name-giving practices found in Beowulf for the royal dynasties of the Geats, Danes, and Swedes are based on alliteration and variation of the same kind as we come across in many other Germanic ruling families of the Migration Period (Nerman 1913, 1931; Flom 1917; Wessén 1927b, 14–64; Woolf 1939). As this practice also occurs during the Late Iron Age, it cannot be used for dating purposes in this context, but is nevertheless perfectly compatible with a dating of the events of the poem to the Migration Period. This is further supported by the fact that several personal names, such as Ongentheow, Wealhtheow, Ecgtheow, Eadgils, Onela, and Hrothulf, point back to the time before the Germanic Sound Shift.\n\nArchaeological Dating\n\nEarly on, Knut Stjerna drew attention to a group of archaeologically identifiable elements in the poem—such as swords, especially ring swords, helmets, in particular those with boar crests, shirts of mail, funeral rites, and notions of death—as typical of the late Migration and early Merovingian/Vendel periods in Scandinavia (Stjerna 1903, 1905, 1912). The archaeological picture has since been added to by scholars such as Birger Nerman (1948), Sune Lindqvist (1948a, 1948b), Rosemary Cramp (1957), Rupert Bruce-Mitford (1974, 1975), Hilda Ellis Davidson (1980), Catherine Hills (1997), and Leslie Webster (1998). It should be noted, however, that all of these scholars have primarily emphasized elements in the poem for which there is archaeological evidence in Scandinavia or England from the time in which Beowulf is considered to have originated, but failed to note what has not been found from different periods in these areas. In the late Roman Iron Age and the Migration Period, we find an unparalleled wealth of gold in Scandinavia, resulting from large Roman tribute payments, plunder, and payments of soldiers’ wages in late Roman times and the early part of the Migration Period (Herschend 1980; Fischer 2005). With the fall of the Roman Empire, however, the influx of this precious metal largely petered out. As the Scandinavians deposited large quantities of gold in the ground during the late Migration Period, the ensuing Merovingian/ Vendel Period is marked, in archaeological terms, by a relative paucity of it. From that period there are virtually no finds of solid gold artefacts anywhere in the Nordic region.\n\n8 The variant spellings of these (and other) names will be used interchangeably, depending on whether the context is primarily English or Scandinavian.\n\n24\n\nChapter 4\n\nThe poem also uses expressions directly suggesting solid gold, such as bēagas ond brād gold,9 “rings and thick gold,” wundnan golde,10 “twisted gold,” and bēahwriðan,11 expressions that can scarcely refer to anything other than rings of solid gold. A similar argument can be advanced regarding rings as such. Neck and arm rings occur in large numbers in Scandinavian finds from late Roman times and the Migration Period (Lund Hansen 2001), but, it should be noted, they are exclusively of gold. By the early Merovingian/Vendel Period that followed, neck and arm rings, of any metal, have as good as vanished from the archaeological record throughout the Nordic region. This is in complete contrast to the Migration Period. I myself know of only one neck ring of bronze from the late Vendel Period, from House 08 at Eketorp on Ö� land. Should any other isolated examples to the contrary have escaped my notice, they remain exceptions that prove the rule. A small number of linked amulet rings of iron from the later Vendel Period (Hållans Stenholm 2011) represent something different altogether. As a recurring theme throughout the poem, there is talk of rings—bēag, bēah, and compounds of these words,12 and hrinġ13—and of princes generously dispensing them. In several cases, there are express references to neck rings.14 This makes it abundantly clear that the main events described take place in the period before about 550. All the talk in Beowulf about gold in abundance—especially in the form of rings, generally of gold and often of solid gold—places the material setting of the poem firmly in that period. King Hrothgar’s hall, Heorot, is referred to in the text as goldfāh,15 “sparkling with gold.” Its ceiling is said to be golde fāhne,16 “shining with gold,” and the mead benches, medubenċ moniġ, are golde ġereġnad, “adorned with gold.”17 Four times, Heorot is spoken of as a goldsele, “gold hall,”18 although this could also possibly—but only possibly— refer to the fact that gold was dispensed there. It certainly does not go without saying that this is a matter of poetic convention, poetic exaggeration, or mythical understanding. In halls from this period at Gudme on Funen, Borg in the Lofoten Islands, Slöinge in Halland, Helgö in Lake Mälaren, and other sites, melted gold has been found in postholes, which has been taken to mean that the posts of the buildings were adorned in some way with gold (Petersen 1994, 6; Herschend 1995, 222ff.; Herschend 1998, 49; Holmqvist 1979, 56ff., 64–65; Arrhenius 2011; Lundqvist 2000). Finds of gold-foil fig9 3105.\n\n10 1382.\n\n11 2018.\n\n12 35, 80, 352, 523, 894, 921, 1102, 1163, 1177, 1195; 1211, 1216, 1487, 1657, 1719, 1750, 2018, 2041, 2172, 2176, 2284, 2370, 2635, 2763, 2812, 2826, 2995, 3009, 3014, 3105, 3163, 105. 13 1091, 1195, 1202, 1507, 1970, 2010, 2245, 2345, 2809, 3017, 3034, 3053. 14 1195, 2172, 2809, 3017. 15 308. 16 927.\n\n17 776–77.\n\n18 715, 1253, 1639, 2083.\n\nDating of the Poem\n\n25\n\nures in the cultic building at Uppåkra have been interpreted in the same way (Larsson and Lenntorp 2004, 42; Larsson 2006). These archaeological observations provide a real-world background to the poem’s description of Heorot as goldsele gumena ġearwost wisse fǣttum fāhne,19 “the warriors’ gold hall with glistening plates.” Gold-foil figures have also been found in several other halls in Scandinavia from the Middle Iron Age, such as those at Slöinge and Helgö. When the Swedish king Ongentheow/Egil is attacked by the Geats, he retreats to what is referred to as a fæsten,20 an expression which in another context21 is compared to an eorðweard. This can only really be understood to mean that he sought refuge in what would today be called a hill fort. If my interpretation of the hrēosna beorh in the land of the Geats is correct, that expression too refers to such a fortification. The use of hill forts in Iron Age Sweden coincides to a large extent with the deposition of solid gold. Forts were established, extended, and in general use in the middle and second half of the Roman Iron Age and during the Migration Period. There are no known examples from the early Vendel Period. Traces of existing hill forts being used during that period are also extremely rare (Olausson 2011a, 2011b, 2011c, 2011d). A similar situation appears to have existed in central Norway, for example (Ystgard 2014, 175–214). It is difficult not to link this state of affairs to the fact that the early Merovingian/Vendel Period—the phase immediately following the disaster years of 536–550 (Gräslund 2007; Gräslund and Price 2012; Price and Gräslund 2014; see also Chapter 20)—was primarily a time of peaceful economic, social, and demographic recovery, with conditions conducive to an internal re-expansion of human settlement. Another example of a detail in the poem that could be regarded as fanciful, but more likely reflects a prehistoric reality, is the description of Heorot as innan ond ūtan īrenbendum,22 “[bound] inside and out with iron bands,” and īrenbendum fæst,23 “secured with iron bands.” This is usually taken to mean that the building was held together with iron bands. But such a building technique was neither necessary nor practically feasible, nor is there any archaeological evidence of it. As Fulk et al. (2009, 162) have pointed out, the wording Duru sōna onarn fӯrbendum fæst24 concerning the door of Heorot, which Grendel tears open, suggests that it was adorned with iron mounts in the same way as medieval Scandinavian church doors. The phrase can best be translated as meaning that Grendel “opened the door that was fitted with forged bands.” This interpretation is confirmed by finds of a large number of flat iron bars forming spirals and other shapes that once adorned the wide double doors of the palatial hall on the Kungsgården (“Royal Manor”) plateau at Old Uppsala, built in the early Vendel Period and only a little more recent than Heorot (Hedlund 1993; Karlsson 2011; Ljung19 715–16.\n\n20 2950.\n\n21 2334–35. 22 774. 23 998.\n\n24 721–22.\n\n26\n\nChapter 4\n\nkvist and Frölund 2015). The words innan ond ūtan in the poem also become comprehensible in the light of the iron mounts for an interior door that have been found in the same hall building (John Ljungkvist, personal communication October 2017). Expressions such as “bound” and “secured” should be understood metaphorically in this context, the magical, fire-forged iron “binding” in the sense of securing the house and offering protection to its occupants.\n\nConclusions\n\nSurviving textual sources clearly show that the main narrative of Beowulf plays out over the course of a few decades leading up to the middle of the sixth century, that is, the closing decades of the Migration Period. An appreciable number of the members of Danish and Swedish royal dynasties mentioned in the poem can be regarded, on the evidence of other sources, as reasonably well-attested historical figures from this time. A few objects of definite types spoken of in the poem, such as ring swords, boarcrested helmets and mail shirts, can be associated with both the Migration and the early Merovingian/Vendel Period. Crucially, though, there are no references in the poem to archaeological artefacts unknown from the Migration Period or to objects known only from Merovingian/Vendel times. This, combined with the considerable focus on rings and, to some extent, solid gold, firmly links the main events and material settings of the poem to the time before 550, that is, to the late Migration Period. The archaeological dating of the material settings of Beowulf, in other words, tallies well with the historical dating of its events. It should also be noted in this connection that archaeological chronology is independent of historical dating based on written sources. The historical and archaeological sources relied on here are completely independent of each other. Taken together, the historical and archaeological evidence places the main events and the material culture of the poem firmly in the late Migration Period, in the decades leading up to 550. Such a narrow archaeological demarcation of a Scandinavian historical tradition of this age, preserved in writing, is something quite unique. It seems extremely improbable that a lettered Old English Christian poet could have composed this distinct and credible historical and archaeological picture of a world so remote from him in time, geography, and culture.\n\nChapter 5\n\nARCHAEOLOGICAL DELIMINATION This chapter will\n\nto some extent repeat what has been said before, but as its aim is different and the question is crucial to our interpretation of the poem, this is unavoidable. The archaeological references in Beowulf are often described in fairly general terms, and almost always for purposes other than my present one. A clearer archaeological picture will emerge if we note not only what specific material culture the poem represents, but also what elements are not known from Scandinavia and England during the period in which its events unfold.\n\nNeck and Arm Rings\n\nAs we have already noted, a thread running through Beowulf is all the talk of rings and of princes who generously distribute them, or at least ought to do so. Rings are spoken of no fewer than forty-four times, in most cases as bēag or bēah,1 but also as hrinġ.2 In four cases at least, there are explicit references to neck rings.3 Hilda Ellis Davidson has suggested that healsbēaga mǣst,4 “the greatest of neck rings,” which Queen Wealhtheow presents to Beowulf, is a reference to the brēostġewǣde mentioned a little later in the text,5 which in that case should be interpreted as a chest adornment rather than a mail shirt. Davidson is reminded of the large Swedish gold collars from the Migration Period, from Möne, Å� lleberg, and Färjestad, made up of seven, five, and three gold rings respectively, covered with filigree (Pesch 2015a), and serving as large chest ornaments (Davidson 1980, 358). The suggestion is interesting, but the connection made is hardly incontrovertible. Neck and arm rings occur in large numbers in Scandinavian finds from the late Roman and Migration periods. Significantly, they are only ever made from gold. Similarly, Beowulf makes no mention of any other metal than gold being used for rings. Equally noteworthy is the fact that there is not a single definite find anywhere in the Nordic region of a true neck or arm ring of gold from the early Migration/Vendel Period that followed, and hardly any of such rings made from any other metal either.6 1 35, 80, 352, 523, 894, 921, 1102, 1163, 1177, 1195, 1211, 1216, 1487, 1657, 1719, 1750, 2018, 2041, 2172, 2176, 2284, 2370, 2635, 2763, 2812, 2826, 2995, 3009, 3014, 3105, 3163, 105. 2 1091, 1195, 1202, 1507, 1970, 2010, 2245, 2345, 2809, 3017, 3034, 3053. 3 1195, 2172, 2809, 3017. 4 1195. 5 1210.\n\n6 I disregard here a number of simple spiral arm rings of flat bronze band, of the type found in a building from the Vendel Period (House Ö� ) at Eketorp fort on Ö� land (Iversen and Näsman\n\n28\n\nChapter 5\n\nWhat, then, of the gold collars just mentioned? From the West Mound at Old Uppsala there is a small face mask of gold filigree that is almost identical to those on the collar from Möne in Västergötland (Pesch 2015b, 263, 283). This mound was admittedly constructed in the late sixth or early seventh century (Ljungkvist 2005), but in elite circles at Old Uppsala, Valsgärde, and Vendel old luxury objects were often used as grave goods. The West Mound contained late Roman ivory gaming pieces and cameos that were a couple of hundred years old when they were placed in the grave. There are good arguments for dating the Möne collar to no later than the mid-sixth century (Pesch 2015c, 511–15). So, if the small filigree figure from the West Mound belonged to a gold collar, it does not mean that such objects were being made or were in general circulation in the early Vendel Period. And since collars, like neck rings, are unknown as grave goods, it equally cannot be ruled out that the small face mask belonged to some other type of artefact of earlier origin. As already noted, Scandinavia in the late Roman Iron Age and the Migration Period exhibits an unparalleled wealth of gold, ultimately arising from direct and indirect influxes from the Roman Empire via central and eastern Europe, influxes that declined with the fall of the empire, but continued to some extent through dealings with Byzantium and the Huns (Herschend 1980; Fischer 2005; Kent Andersson 2011, 90–92). Towards the end of the Migration Period, the Scandinavians appear to have deposited large quantities of gold in the ground, with the result that the following period seems to be marked by a relative paucity of the metal. To make the best possible use of what remained, craftsmen perfected a technique of mounting cut precious stones in a thin gold frame, with a background of thin gold sheet, a method which still gave the impression of sumptuous, gleaming luxury. Through such technical thrift, the working of precious metals was renewed across much of the Germanic world in the early Merovingian Period, resulting in an incomparable mastery of the art. In elite settings in Scandinavia during the Migration Period, the concept of a ring seems to be synonymous with gold. Expressions in Beowulf such as bēahwriðan7 and wundnan golde8, “twisted gold,” in other words, can scarcely refer to anything other than solid gold in the form of twisted neck or arm rings. In Old Norse literature, the word baugr in the sense of “ring” also appears to refer specifically to gold rings (Nerman 1960). The expression brād gold, “thick gold,” used in connection with a ring, suggests the same conclusion.9 In the phrase bēagas ond brād gold,10 the latter may reasonably be assumed to refer to solid gold, perhaps in the form of ingots of the kind included in the unique hoards from Tureholm in Södermanland and Timboholm in Västergötland, comprising 12 kg and 7 kg of pure gold, respectively (Kent Andersson 2011, 80–84).\n\n1978). A neck ring of unknown date was found in House 08, Eketorp (Frands Herschend, personal communication). 7 2018.\n\n8 1382. 9 3105.\n\n10 3105.\n\nArchaeological Delimination\n\n29\n\nAndreas Haarder translates the expression as “barrer” (“bars, ingots”), while Collinder opts for “råguld” (“raw gold”) and Alexander “thick gold.” An interpretation of brād here as “broad” is inconsistent with the fact that particularly broad gold objects are not known from the Migration Period. The poem rarely mentions what all these rings are made of, but when it does they are always described as being of gold. In my view, this silence only makes sense if the Beowulf tradition arose in an elite Migration Period setting in Scandinavia, where everyone knew that rings were always made of gold. The magical aura surrounding the concept of rings must have been beyond the grasp of an Old English poet. Solid neck and arm rings, of whatever metal, are completely absent from England from the end of Roman times to at least the beginning of the Viking Age, i.e., much of the Anglo-Saxon period. The only known examples of rings seem to be a gold finger ring from Norwich in Norfolk, a few hollow crescent-shaped rings of other materials found in children’s graves, a simple neck ring made from a brass bar from West Hesterton in Yorkshire (Pollington et al. 2010, 298–300), and half a dozen simple finger rings with twisted ends, of silver and copper (Høilund Nielsen 2013). Magnificent princely burials, like those at Sutton Hoo in East Anglia, Prittlewell in Essex, and Taplow in Buckinghamshire, do not deviate from this pattern. The absence of neck and arm rings in the rich Staffordshire hoard, with its profusion of high-status gold objects (Leahy and Bland 2014), could admittedly be due to its very special composition (Gareth Williams 2014), but other hoards also lack rings. Occasional finds of ring swords of a common-Germanic type do not change the picture. This absence of solid gold rings and paucity of solid gold generally in England coincides with a very limited influx of gold solidi after the Romans had left the country around ad 410. The overall picture would not be appreciably altered by isolated finds there of large gold rings. The poem’s many references to rings fit in all the better, though, with conditions in Scandinavia at the time of its events, the end of the Migration Period. The almost manic fixation on rings as a manifestation of princely power and social prestige that characterizes Beowulf, then, cannot possibly reflect royal settings in early Anglo-Saxon England. Words such as bēag and hrinġ do figure in certain other early Old English texts as well, but only in a few instances and mostly in passing and in contexts reflecting continental European rather than Anglo-Saxon traditions, as in Waldere (I: 29) and Widsith (65, 73, 74, 90). The examples, moreover, are vanishingly few in comparison with Beowulf, even though the latter represents only a tenth of all Old English literature. Certain references to rings in late texts such as Maldon, The Exeter Maxim 5, and The Seafarer can be attributed to their having come into existence in the late Viking Age, when old Germanic ring traditions had to some extent been revived in England as a result of close contact with Scandinavians.\n\nMail Shirts\n\nShirts of mail were the bullet-proof vests of their time. The almost magical power ascribed to them is illustrated in the poem by the scene in which Grendel’s mother\n\n30\n\nChapter 5\n\nattempts to stab Beowulf to death with a large knife, but is prevented from doing so by his mail shirt.11 Throughout the poem, shirts of iron mail, or “byrnies,” appear in the same prestigious contexts as helmets. This is not surprising. Only the highest social elite could afford a tailor-made protective garment composed of twenty to thirty thousand small iron rings skilfully joined together with copper or iron rivets. It would cost a man a small fortune to acquire one. Appearing in public wearing a mail shirt and helmet, brandishing a sword and shield glistening with gold and garnets, and surrounded by a well-armed band of retainers could be compared, in modern-day terms, to cruising along in a Rolls Royce Silver Cloud with a liveried chauffeur and an escort of police motorcycle outriders. Using various words and combinations of words, the poem mentions mail shirts as many as seventy-seven times at a liberal estimate, and thirty-nine at a conservative one (Scheman 1882, 25–27).12 The commonest word is byrne, followed by syrċe/serċe and hrinġ, these last-mentioned alternatives, on their own or in compounds, often as kennings for byrne. In addition, there are occasional examples of net and hræġl (Brady 1979, 110–28; Morini 2013). There is archaeological evidence of mail shirts from Sweden, Denmark, and Norway from the whole of the Middle and Late Iron Age, i.e., the Roman Iron Age, Migration Period, Merovingian/Vendel Period and Viking Age, and from both inhumation and cremation burials (Fredman 1992). In many grave finds, there are too few iron rings for a shirt of mail, and they may have been part of the neck guard of a helmet. Mail shirts from Scandinavia during the Roman Iron Age were presumably of Roman manufacture, but domestic production is assumed to have begun in the Migration and Merovingian/ Vendel periods (Arwidsson 1939; Fredman 1992). A good example of a byrnie is the 8 kg mass of rings from Vendel Grave XI in Uppland, from the early Vendel Period. Images of such garments are also found from late Migration and early Vendel times, on figured helmet foils of a Scandinavian type from Vendel Grave XIV, and in a bronze die from Björnhovda in Torslunda, Ö� land, used to make foils of that type. All the evidence suggests, then, that mail shirts were part of the parade dress of a warrior in princely circles in the Swīorīċe of the poem. Apart from the large ship burial at Sutton Hoo in East Anglia, from around 625, there is not a single known find of a shirt of mail in England from the whole of the period 400–1000 (Morini 2006, 2013; Pollington 2008, 42; Owen-Crocker 2011, 226). Nor are such garments depicted in the silver-gilt decorative frieze, probably for a helmet, found in the magnificent Staffordshire hoard (Pitts 2015). As the example in the Sutton Hoo burial was placed there together with a helmet and a shield that are generally considered to have been made in eastern Sweden, or possibly in East Anglia by eastern Swedish craftsmen or under some other influence from that part of Sweden, the mail shirt too 11 1541–56.\n\n12 All depending on how we interpret expressions that could also represent the whole of a person’s battle gear, but which in most cases probably refer to mail shirts: fyrd-searo (232, 2618), gūð-searo (8215, 328), gūð-gewǣde (227, 2617, 2623, 2730, 2851, 2871), heaðo-rēaf (401), heaðowǣd (39), here-wǣd (1897) and hilde-ġeatwe (674, 2362).\n\nArchaeological Delimination\n\n31\n\nhas often been viewed as being of probable Scandinavian origin (Bruce-Mitford 1974, 1978; Morini 2006, 2013). This seems particularly likely, given that helmet, shield, and mail shirt represent a known combination of protective equipment for a Scandinavian prince of this period. There is good reason to assume that the shirt of mail at Sutton Hoo came to East Anglia from Scandinavia. The absence of mail shirts in early Anglo-Saxon England cannot be due to a lack of technical capacity, as the mail neck guards of the helmets from Benty Grange (BruceMitford and Luscombe 1974) and Coppergate in York (Tweddle 1984) make clear, although both are admittedly from the eighth century. Nor is it likely to be a result of special burial practices in England. If mail shirts had been worn by the Anglo-Saxon elite, this should have emerged clearly from the huge number of excavated cremation burials from the fifth and sixth centuries and inhumation burials down to the middle of the seventh. Their absence can hardly be attributed, either, to the fact that only certain men were buried with weapons and only some of these with a mail shirt. That was the case in Scandinavia, too. The many weapon burials from the early Anglo-Saxon period tell us a very different story. As Leslie Alcock has argued, it seems that the Anglo-Saxons quite simply pre"
