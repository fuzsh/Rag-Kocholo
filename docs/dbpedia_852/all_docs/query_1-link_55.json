        "text": "All nordic countries are using flags depicting the Nordic cross, a christian symbol. These include Iceland, the Faroe Islands, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Åland and Finland. The Nordic cross is shifted towards the hoist on all Nordic flags. This was done to allow a better identification of the flag on vessels at sea by compensating the smaller appearance of the external part of the flag when fluttering in the wind. Yet, the amount of shifting is not identical on all the Nordic flags.\n\nThe two regional powers in the history of the Baltic sea have been Denmark, symbolised by the red colour, and Sweden, symbolised by the blue colour. Both countries have a similar legend of a cross descending on earth during a battle and ensuring victory. The red and blue parts of the Norwegian, Icelandic, Faroe and Åland flags are reminiscent of the domination of Sweden and Denmark, in turn, in their history. Only Finland does not include a red pattern in its flag.\n\nLink: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_Cross_flag\n\nRatio: 28:37 (1.321)\n\nDimensions: H 3:1:4.5 to 5.25, V 3:1:3. Note that the length of the last red part is not fixed in law beyond being between 4.5 and 5.25. However, 5.25 is commonly used.\n\nColour: the red is not defined, but Pantone 186c is generally used.\n\nBoth flags can be used as yatch flag.\n\nLink: https://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/ax.html#use\n\nRatio: 8:11 (1.375)\n\nDimensions: H 6:1:2:1:12, V 6:1:2:1:6\n\nColours: dark blue and intense red, not further defined\n\nRed and blue were chosen in reference with past union with Demark (red) and Sweden (blue), as well as blue, white and red in reference to the French flag as a symbol of freedom\n\nThe current norwegian flag was designed in 1821 and adopted. However, as Norway was in union with Sweden, the flag was approved by the king for civiluse, but military and king flags remained. It is only in 1905 when Norway quitted the union with Sweden that the current flag got official recognition.\n\nA Nowegian flag is never allowed t touch the ground.\n\nThe legend says that King Eric IX saw a golden cross in the skyas he landed in Finalnd during the first Swedish crusade in 1157 and he adopted the golden cross on a bluebackground as his banner. The cross may have been white originally...\n\nThe flag was originally in darker blue than today. The colour was changed in 1906.\n\nSame as for the two other Baltic states, the flag was adopted in 1918 and resinstated in 1991. There are variation in the interpretation of the colours. The blue represents the sky and concepts of feredom and truth. The black represents the soil, the home land and the \"dark\" fate of Estonian people over the centuries, and the white, purity and commitment as well as a bright future.\n\nThe flag was initially used for merchant ships. It became the flag of the Tsardom of Russia in 1696 until the 1917 revolution. It was reestablished after the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 to become the flag of the Russian Federation.\n\nThe colour scheme is reported to be derived from the Dutch flag as Peter the Great had ordered a Dutch-built frigate from Amsterdam that was delivered with a Dutch ensign. Peter decided to just change the order of the colours for the Russian navy."
