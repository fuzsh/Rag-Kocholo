        "text": "Back in January, Liv Tyler informed the world that she was pregnant again with a swoon-worthy Instagram photo of her smiling and holding her growing belly on a beach. It’s no surprise, then, that she followed up the adorable announcement with a similarly gushing social media snap of the bundle of joy: her third child, Lula Rose Gardner, born Friday night. This is her second baby with fiancé David Gardner, who is shown holding their new little girl in Tyler’s Instagram image. As Tyler mentioned in the caption, it seems as if the couple’s hearts are currently “exploding with love.” And why wouldn’t they be? Tyler and Gardner’s family keeps on growing—they have a son together, 17-month-old Sailor Gene, while Tyler has an 11-year-old son, Milo, and Gardner has a son named Gray, both from previous relationships.\n\nCongrats to the overjoyed brood, and here’s hoping that Tyler shares the first family portrait with the world very soon.\n\nAnd from the Vogue archives, some nursery decor ideas:"
