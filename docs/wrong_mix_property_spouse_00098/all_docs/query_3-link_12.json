        "text": "Campus\n\nArcturus celebrates its 56th year\n\nArcturus, Highline College’s renowned publication, launched its much-anticipated 56th issue.\n\nTo celebrate the June 5 release, attendees shared food, refreshments, and a free copy of the latest Arcturus issue. The diverse array of contributors shared their works and the inspirations and processes behind them, even opening up time towards the end of the event for an open mic, allowing everyone to take part in the creativity.\n\nThis issue’s theme “After Image” explores the concept of the image that remains even after the original is no longer visible. It is the lingering picture when one looks away after exposure to a bright image. Contributors have captured this effect through prose, poetry, and visual art, probing into the lasting echoes of both big and small incidents.\n\nUncertainty: The joy of not knowing\n\nIf you’re like most college students, the weight of academic stress might be overwhelmingly all too familiar. When stress and anxiety begin to form due to the nagging need to meet both school and personal expectations, self-control and precision might be something you immediately fall back on.\n\nMaybe you’re in the midst of figuring out how to pay for school, filling out internship applications, or simply feeling the anticipation of finals. It’s only natural to resort to a routine that ensures your ability to get things done. And, although this can combat the daunting feelings that arise from uncertainty, it can also add onto initial worry or stress.\n\nQ Center’s Pink Prom is an appropriately glittery occasion\n\nThe Pink Prom hosted by the LGBTQIA+ Task Force, Q Center, Center for Cultural and Inclusive Excellence, and the Office of Equity, Diversity, and Transformation consisted of a live DJ, pizza, cake, an assortment of flashing party favors, and performances by drag queens and kings.\n\nHeld in the student union in Building 8 on May 24, tables were set out with bright flowers serving as the centerpieces. The majority of the bottom floor was set aside for a lively dance floor, with DJ Mike Baskett playing classic hits from artists like Madonna or remixes of the most popular songs of the 2020s.\n\nThe event had all the makings of a classic high school prom, something many of the attendees did not receive given the COVID-19 pandemic taking place during many people’s last years of high school.\n\nIn honor of Memorial Day flags fly on Highline’s campus, albeit shortly\n\nAs Highline students made their way around campus this past week, many may have noticed the scores of American flags placed on the grass next to Building 8, each meticulously lined up in neat rows in order to honor Memorial Day.\n\nMemorial Day is a landmark American holiday meant to remind us of those who died while serving their country in the U.S. military. It wasn’t until 1971 that the last Monday in May became a federal holiday, after congress passed the Uniform Monday Holiday Act in 1968.\n\nThis federal holiday includes observation for the longest war the U.S. has been involved in from 2001 to 2021. This day is not just for having a day off from school or work. It’s for commemorating the veterans that did not get to come back home and hang up their uniform.\n\nAAPI Avenue: Vendors from all across Asia\n\nTo celebrate Asian American and Pacific Islander month, Highline College hosted “AAPI Avenue,” an event held in the Student Union where many different Asian vendors sold their crafts. One of the many ways to honor Asian culture is to support small Asian owned businesses.\n\nAAPI month was officially established in 1992 under the George H. W. Bush administration with the passing of Public Law 102-450. Asian/Pacific American Heritage Month was renamed as AAPI Heritage Month in 2009, according to History.com.\n\nThe month of May was chosen to honor the first immigration of Japanese people to the United States on May 7 of 1843.\n\nFOMO, how this slang term encapsulates the young adult experience\n\nThe familiarly used term FOMO is an acronym that stands for: fear of missing out. Popularized as a widely known term in 2004, FOMO is perhaps the best description for the ever tiring pursuit of a fulfilling life. As Generation Z, individuals born between the years 1997 and 2012 enter college and the workforce, FOMO can be both a motivator as well as a debilitating factor.\n\nThe slanginess of the term FOMO makes it difficult to take seriously in introspective or philosophical conversations, but it’s an effective description for the pressure young adults have to live up to their potential.\n\nGlobal Fest 2024: A vibrant showcase of cultures at Highline College\n\nHighline College’s annual Global Fest, a cornerstone of the college’s 27th Annual Unity Through Diversity Series was a vibrant tapestry of cultures, showcasing the rich diversity of our world.\n\nHosted by the dynamic trio of Global Student Ambassadors, Muna Ali, Barok Yohannes Hailegiorgis, and Laiza Lim, the May 14 event attracted a large and enthusiastic crowd.\n\nThe stage came alive with an electrifying lineup of performances that captivated the audience. The powerful rhythms of Taiko drums set the tone, followed by the mesmerizing Oaxacan dances by Grupo Cultural Donaji. Eva Engelhard and Garvaundo Hamilton’s soulful singing\n\nThe growing crisis of college tuition and student loans\n\nRising college tuition and student loans are causing financial problems and economic risks. It’s a growing crisis that we must address for the sake of individuals, communities, and our economy as a whole.\n\nThe government has a key role to play. It should regulate colleges to ensure tuition hikes are justified by improvements in education quality. And crucially, it must take action to decrease student loan interest rates to alleviate the burden on students. This is especially important given that total student loan debt now exceeds $1.7 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe role of music in student life\n\nFrom the moment students wake up to the time they go to bed, music often plays a crucial role in their daily lives. Whether it’s the perfect playlist to help focus during a study session or a comforting song to heal a broken heart, music has the power to influence moods, productivity, and overall well-being.\n\nNatalie Kim, a Highline College student, told the Thunderword about the role of music as a crucial part of her study routine.\n\nCommunity\n\nIllegally Blonde: Former President Trump convicted on 34 felony counts\n\nAfter a near 12-hour deliberation over the course of two days, jurors made U.S. history last week by finding former President Donald J. Trump guilty on all 34 felony charges of falsifying business records. The verdict has been the center of stark debate across the nation, highlighting the divide between voters of the Republican and Democratic parties.\n\nImmediately after leaving the Manhattan courtroom, Trump decried a “rigged trial”, and made multiple comments on the dangers inflicting the United States, should he be convicted. These comments echoed his intentions to exercise revenge-laden control of the country if he wins a second term as president.\n\nJustice Department finally comes down on sleeping giant Live Nation\n\nThe Live Nation-Ticketmaster conglomerate is now under the scrutiny of the Department of Justice for maintaining an illegal monopoly. Whether it’s a concert at Lumen Field, a Mariners game at T-Mobile Stadium, or an event on Capitol Hill, the big live event giant handing out your tickets has now been thrust into its own spotlight after years of skirting the dark side of the stage.\n\nThe entertainment industry is a curtained machine of artist management, venue operations, concert promotion, and ticket sales. After a 2010 merger of Live Nation and Ticketmaster, the one company now owns and controls every single one of these aspects. The lawsuit, set forth by the DOJ against Live Nation, says they “control around 60% of concert promotion at major concert venues across the country.”\n\nBoeing locks out firefighters and EMS staff across Washington facilities\n\nOver 100 firefighters and EMS staff working at Boeing facilities in Washington are locked out in an attempt by Boeing to force a contract agreement for low wages and longer progression periods.\n\nAt midnight on May 4, Boeing deactivated all security and parking passes of its on-site EMS and firefighters at its six Washington facilities around Seattle.\n\nThe lockout began at 12:01 a.m., as the current contract between Boeing and the International Association of Firefighters union expired at midnight, and a new contract had not been agreed upon. The lockout comes after months of failed contract negotiations on wages between the company and the union representing the workers.\n\n“Run for Hope for Burma” fundraiser continues to inspire after 20 years\n\nEach year, the Karen Community Church of Greater Seattle hosts “Run for Hope for Burma”, a fundraising race to raise money for humanitarian aid in South Eastern Asian country Burma, which is currently known as Myanmar.\n\nThis year, the 5K race was held at Chambers Creek Regional Park in Pierce County on Saturday, May 25. Although it was cold and windy, the racers weren’t deterred as they empathized with refugees and internally displaced people who’ve faced worse conditions while in civil war, as a lot of the racers were previously refugees themselves.\n\nCamped out on the Quad: Pro-Palestine students against Boeing\n\nOn the morning of April 29, students from University of Washington Seattle campus pitched tents on the Quad, establishing the Popular University for Gaza Liberated Zone. Situated in between the Raitt and Miller buildings, the encampment tripled in size within the first 24 hours. The most contentious demand is for the school to cut ties with Boeing, a long-time partner.\n\nThe encampment includes organizations from the UW Progressive Student Union as well as the UW United Front For Palestine Liberation and the UW Student Muslim Association.\n\nNature's celestial ballet in unexpected places\n\nWhile the Arctic regions are renowned for their unparalleled views of the Northern Lights, this celestial phenomenon made a rare, breathtaking appearance in the skies above the Pacific Northwest this past weekend. From the shores of Puget Sound to the peaks of the Cascade Range, the dancing lights graced our region with their ethereal presence during a period of particularly intense solar activity.\n\nThis past weekend, stargazers across the United States were treated to an extraordinary display of the aurora borealis, thanks to an “extreme” geomagnetic storm classified as a G5 – the highest level. According to the Space Weather Prediction Center, this was the first G5 storm to hit our planet since 2003, resulting in power grid irregularities and communication disruptions.\n\nUniversities across the nation have erupted “Solidarity Zones” in protest of the Israeli attack on Gaza\n\nOver the past several months, 2,600 students have been arrested at protests across the country as encampments crop up on quads and in squares. The main call for these protests have been to end US involvement in the war, bringing it to their school administrators demanding divestment from Israel-supporting companies.\n\nFor context, on October 7, 2023, Hamas, a Palestinian militant force who has had control over the Palestinian population for the past 18 years, launched an attack into southern Israel, resulting in the death of 1,400 and the capture of about 250 people, including women and children.\n\nBonsaiFest! recap (photo story)\n\nOn a beautiful, sunny weekend the Pacific Bonsai Museum in Federal Way, the Pacific Bonsai Museum hosted its fourth BonsaiFEST! to celebrate World Bonsai Day. During the May 11-12 event there were many exhibitions, hundreds of bonsai’s displayed, art activities, food trucks, and more.\n\nThis photo story, highlights some of the bonsais to learn more about the culture, history, and art of these miniature trees.\n\nParanormal Cirque II: The R-rated circus coming to a city near you\n\nThe touring circus Paranormal Cirque II began its western Washington leg at the Puyallup fairgrounds on Friday, May 10. Featuring an eclectic cast of tightrope walkers, sword swallowers, jugglers and burlesque dancers, this circus appeals to an older audience with a taste for the macabre.\n\nTaking place under an ominous black tent and headed by the neon red sign displaying the name, Paranormal Cirque II feels as though the carnival from Ray Bradbury’s “Something Wicked This Way Comes” has come to life.\n\nJack3d walked so Panera Bread’s charged lemonade could run\n\nWith Panera Bread dropping its Charged Lemonade in response to multiple wrongful death lawsuits, it may be time for a stroll down memory lane back to 2013, when an enraptured gym culture felt the side-effects of another nearly unregulated stimulant, Jack3d.\n\nJack3d (pronounced ‘jacked’) is a caffeinated pre-workout supplement that was banned in the U.S. in 2013 because of the illegal substance, dimethylamylamine (DMAA), though its updated formula sits on store shelves to this day.\n\nSports\n\nThunderbirds ready for new soccer season under new Head Coach Skyler Roehr\n\nAs the Highline Thunderbirds gear up for the upcoming soccer season, the team is buzzing with anticipation under the leadership of newly appointed Head Coach Skyler Roehr. Roehr, who served as the assistant coach last year, steps into his new role with high expectations and a deep-rooted passion for Highline soccer, having played his final season with the Thunderbirds in 2018.\n\nLast season, Highline came heartbreakingly close to capturing the NWAC Men’s Soccer Championship. The Thunderbirds finished as runners-up after a dramatic penalty shootout loss to Peninsula College. The match ended 2-2 after regulation and overtime, and the ensuing shootout extended to 11 rounds before Peninsula secured the title with an 11-10 victory.\n\nAmérica secure back-to-back Liga MX titles with win over Cruz Azul\n\nClub América won consecutive championships and extended its record of Liga MX titles to 15 after defeating rival Cruz Azul 2-1 on aggregate in the Clausura 2024 final.\n\nThursday’s first leg ended with a 1-1 draw at Cruz Azul’s Ciudad de los Deportes Stadium. Sunday’s second leg at Club América’s Estadio Azteca ended with a score of 1-0 in favor of the team.\n\nHighline College men's golf season highlights: David Sibbett shines with top four finish at championships\n\nThe Highline College men’s golf team concluded a commendable season with a notable performance at the NWAC Golf Championship, held at the scenic Apple Tree Golf Course in Yakima, Wash. Despite the tough competition, Highline standout player David Sibbett achieved a remarkable fourth place individually, underlining his skill and knowledge of the game.\n\nThis season, the Highline College golf team competed fiercely in several tournaments, building momentum and showcasing their talents. The culmination of Sibbett’s efforts was evident in the championship, where his performance was a testament to his consistency and ability to excel under pressure.\n\nHighline tennis team shines bright in 2024\n\nThe 2024 season ends in a second-place finish for the Highline women’s tennis team, as they fell to a Spokane Community College with a 6-3 loss in the championship final. The season proved a rollercoaster of victories and setbacks, culminating in an exciting journey to the NWAC Championship.\n\nLed by coach Laura Rosa, the season saw the team face tough opponents and made the six players truly prove their mettle on the court.\n\nThe season began with a dominant performance against Bellevue College, securing a solid 7-0 victory. Highline continued its winning streak with a convincing 7-2 victory over Spokane Community College. However, they faced tough losses against American River College and Menlo College, highlighting the challenges that awaited them.\n\nArts\n\n“The Strangers” saga\n\nThe 2008 horror thriller “The Strangers” was for many years considered a cult classic, with eerie dialogue and morbidly fascinating character design keeping the film relevant throughout the years. As with anything, its continued popularity spurred several more movies.\n\n“The Strangers”, loosely based on a few true stories of home invasions, follows a young couple as they are terrorized by a group of three masked strangers during a stay at an isolated cabin.\n\nStarring Liv Tyler (“Lord of the Rings”, “Empire Records”) and Scott Speedman (“Underworld”) as a couple on the brink of a potential break-up, the movie is distinctive in that a fractured relationship must be put aside in order to survive together.\n\n“Ten Acrobats in an Amazing Leap of Faith” at Centerstage Theatre\n\nCenterstage Theatre closes its 2023-2024 season with “Ten Acrobats in an Amazing Leap of Faith”, a poignant family drama which follows the chaos that unfolds in an immigrant, Muslim-Egyptian family where the children of the family, all young adults in their own right, start to diverge and wrestle with the family values they’d been raised with.\n\nThe whole cast is stellar – bringing charisma, passion, and earnestness to their roles. The show itself is captivating and thought provoking, tackling powerful and heavy subject matter, mostly regarding religion, and the way those beliefs can become heavily intertwined with family dynamics, and an attempt to detangle the two and understand each other.\n\nBlock-buster: \"Minecraft\" builds 15 years of success\n\nMinecraft, the block game beloved by many and old enough to be a part of many childhoods, has reached its 15th anniversary. The game has gone through many changes throughout the years and is still being updated regularly.\n\nMinecraft has been able to consistently stay relevant even after 15 years. There are multiple factors that play into its relevance. The game is still actively being developed to this day. There are many creations generated by its user base. The game has plenty of media coverage through the various content creators.\n\nMinecraft is a sandbox game where you can do anything as long as you put your mind to it. The game features many mechanics that enable you to play any way you want. You can build, fight, or innovate.\n\nAmazon’s “Fallout”: Welcome to the apocalypse\n\nIf you’ve played video games or at least have friends who do so, chances are you’ve heard about “Fallout”, the games series originally created by Interplay Productions/Entertainment, Black Isle Studios, and later by Bethesda. Set in a retro futuristic post-apocalyptic America after a devastating nuclear holocaust, “Fallout” is an RPG with a unique style known as dieselpunk.\n\nDespite their games’ success, Interplay struggled financially for years, and eventually “Fallout” was sold to its current owners, Bethesda. Fast forward to today, and Bethesda has released multiple successful Fallout titles, which has led to the creation of Amazon’s Fallout series. ***Be warned, there are massive spoilers ahead.***\n\nHighly anticipated “Wuthering Waves” splashes onto the market\n\nThe game “Wuthering Waves” was released this month. According to the creators it’s a “story-rich open-world action RPG.” You start as the amnesiac character Rover, and you explore the world ahead of you.\n\nThe game had more than 30 million pre-registrations and the reveal stream has over 400k views. The game server opened around one and a half hours earlier than scheduled, leading many to be unprepared for the grand opening. Within the first ten minutes of the servers opening, over 100k accounts had been created already as signified by the user ID number.\n\n“I Saw the TV Glow”: When science fiction gives way to queer reality\n\n“I Saw the TV Glow” is a captivating, heart wrenching film that perfectly encapsulates the lonely feeling of growing up queer in suburbia, and the confusion that comes when one doesn’t have the words to express it.\n\nThe film follows Owen, through middle school and high school all the way into adulthood, and his elusive friendship with a girl named Maddy.\n\nThey first meet when Owen is in seventh grade and Maddy is in ninth, and he strikes up a conversation with her about the book she’s reading: an episode guide to the fictional show, “The Pink Opaque”.\n\n\"Baldur’s Gate 3\": A dice roll\n\nHave you ever wanted to play a game that lets you unleash torrents of magical destruction? Or do you simply wish to have conversations with dogs and skeletons alike? If that calls to you, consider playing “Baldur’s Gate 3”. “Baldur’s Gate 3” is a computer role-playing game (or CRPG for short), that allows you to adventure in the land known as the Forgotten Realms.\n\nTo those who may be unfamiliar with the genre, CRPGs are RPGs made originally for PCs and home computers. They’re designed a certain way with emphasis on intricate storylines and a simple yet effective gameplay style.\n\n“Baby Reindeer”: The mortifying ordeal of being known\n\nNetflix’s limited series “Baby Reindeer”, written by and starring Richard Gadd is a version of his own real-life experience with a crazed serial stalker. While stalking is the core element of the show, the deeper and more poignant theme is the human need to be known and the consequences of the perceptions of strangers.\n\nGadd portrays a fictionalized version of himself, Donny Dunn, opposite Jessica Gunning as his stalker ‘Martha’. The series is based on Gadd’s one-man stage play of the same name and with both presentations narrated by Gadd himself.\n\n“Challengers”: A new angle on the love triangle\n\n“Challengers” is director Luca Guadagnino’s latest film, which follows the turbulent relationships between its three main characters through the lens of their tennis careers. Unlike most love triangle romances, where one character is being chased by two others, this story gives each pairing equal attention, and showcases the ways the three get so deeply intertwined with each other over the years.\n\nThe movie itself is about tennis. Tennis is what connects Tashi Duncan, Art Donaldson, and Patrick Zweig. Art and Patrick had been best friends since boarding school, but once they meet Tashi at the start of their college tennis careers, a wrench is thrown in their friendship – they both like her, and she likes both of them, and they’re both sort of into each other, but none of them quite know how to make any of it work.\n\nOpinion\n\nThe death of genuine hype: You want a side of trailer with your trailer?\n\nComing soon to a heater near you: Trailers that either tell you the entire plot of the movie or absolutely nothing at all. No doubt this is a familiar sentiment that has only grown in the last few years. At some point, trailers took a nosedive in quality, and now all we have left are trailers that spoil everything about a movie or series, or ones that are beyond vague.\n\nThink back to the last trailer that gave you an idea of what the movie was about without showcasing all the twists and turns and ruining what makes them so impactful before you even see the thing it’s advertising.\n\nAnime’s deeply rooted sexism and fanservice services no one\n\nMany anime fans can find it awkward talking about the genre due to some of its more toxic fans. Places like the main anime subreddit, r/Anime, often shows droves of users ranting about censorship of sexual content at every turn, even if it’s merely reducing the visibility of a female character’s undergarments.\n\nOften it’s difficult for a more relaxed or “casual” fan to speak about it with others because of the large amount of overtly inappropriate content that somehow permeates almost every anime out there.\n\nOpinion: A response to the recent visit from anti-abortion advocates\n\nDisclaimer: Please consider where you are mentally and emotionally right now. The following article addresses and elaborates on the subject of abortion, sexual assault, and death.\n\nOur campus received a visit from a group of men this past week. They brought with them enlarged photos of fetuses in an attempt to spread their belief that abortion is wrong, and nobody should have access to safe reproductive healthcare.\n\nIt is clear to me that they did not come to fight for a woman’s right to choose to see her pregnancy to term. Women already have that right, and nobody has tried to take it away. Instead, they came here to prevent women from ever having that choice.\n\nOpinion: “Madame Web” is great actually\n\nDakota Johnson stars as the subtly-named Cassandra Webb in Sony’s newest attempt at money laundering: “Madame Web”. Boasting a 3.8 out of 10 stars on IMDb, a 13% critic rating, and 55% audience rating on Rotten Tomatoes, “Madame Web” is, in my opinion, actually not a bad movie – but perhaps the greatest Pepsi commercial ever made.\n\nWhile product placement is a common aspect in film, especially modern film, “Madame Web” seems to hint at Spiderman characters as side plots to a larger, expanded “Pepsi Cinematic Universe” (PCU), which I personally find inspiring.\n\nEven the climax of “Madame Web” is atop a giant Pepsi sign, wherein one of the letters falls off and crushes the villain, almost suggesting that the hero all along was Pepsi Cola, with some assistance from strong independent women.\n\nIt’s Taylor Swift’s world, we’re all just living in it\n\nTaylor Swift is the talk of the town these days. Which town? Well, all of them really. The music icon continues to dazzle and delight while on the top of the world. Although she’s seen almost two decades of success and a plethora of awards, she may have just concluded one of the best weeks imaginable.\n\nBetween the previous Sunday (the Grammys) and last Sunday (the Superbowl), the “Fearless” singer won a record-breaking fourth Album of the Year Grammy, announced the release of her 11th album, completed an international leg of her iconic Eras Tour to a sold-out crowd in Japan, oh, and she made it back to Las Vegas in time to watch her famous, arguably the best-there’s-ever-been tight-end boyfriend win the Super Bowl. It doesn’t get much better than that.\n\nAffectionate cats can change your life for the better\n\nThe long-fought war between dog and cat lovers is still ongoing. Dog people claim dogs as “man’s best friend”, while cat lovers claim loving cats requires a certain appreciation for individual autonomy. While these paradigms are a couple ways to look at the issue, there is also the extroverted dog versus introverted cat debate. Regardless, all animal lovers can agree that animals improve our lives.\n\nAccording to Forbes, 66% of households own pets, and of those 66%, 46.5 million households have cats. While dogs beat them out for the majority, 46.5 million is no small number."
