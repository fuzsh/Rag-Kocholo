        "text": "Fifteen years after starring in The Incredible Hulk, Liv Tyler is making her return to Marvel Studios, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.\n\nTyler has joined the cast of Captain America 4, currently titled Captain America: New World Order. She will reprise the role of scientist Betty Ross. Ross is the daughter of General Thaddeus \"Thunderbolt\" Ross, who was played by the late William Hurt in several films and will now be portrayed by Harrison Ford in the new installment.\n\nLiv Tyler Returns to Marvel for ‘Captain America 4’\n\nAnthony Mackie is toplining the Marvel Studios feature as hero Sam Wilson, taking up the mantle of Captain America for the first time on the big screen.\n\nNice... So those Hulk were canon? I mean the general was already in other Marvel movie so I think i just answered my own question.\n\nWith Liv Tyler coming back, are there any other huge characters that haven't been seen in a long time? For a while it was Portman and Liv, but the MCU has done a heck of a job getting people to come back around.\n\nNice... So those Hulk were canon? I mean the general was already in other Marvel movie so I think i just answered my own question.\n\nYeah, Thunderbolt Ross was in Civil War, Infinity War, and Engame, and Abomination was in She-Hulk. Samuel Sterns will also be in New World Order.\n\nNice... So those Hulk were canon? I mean the general was already in other Marvel movie so I think i just answered my own question.\n\nWell yeah - Abomination, General Ross and The Leader all returned after debuting in that movie.\n\nPretty much guaranteed this is a Cap-Hulk team up movie like Thor Ragnarok then yeah?\n\nWe haven't heard any indication that Ruffalo is in it, but I would be shocked if he isn't considering Hulk's entire supporting cast is in the movie now.\n\nNice... So those Hulk were canon? I mean the general was already in other Marvel movie so I think i just answered my own question.\n\nHulk movies are weird, for instance The Incredible Hulk still acknowledged parts of Ang Lee's Hulk and was this pseudo sequel.\n\nNice... So those Hulk were canon? I mean the general was already in other Marvel movie so I think i just answered my own question.\n\nThe Incredible Hulk was always canon.\n\nHulk movies are weird, for instance The Incredible Hulk still acknowledged parts of Ang Lee's Hulk and was this pseudo sequel.\n\nNo it wasn't.\n\nRoss must be getting axed relatively quickly. Ford is already 80 and doesn't seem like the type that would be making too many appearances.\n\nHe's confirmed to be in New World Order and Thunderbolts at the very least. But yeah, can't see him sticking around for too long.\n\nI'm gonna guess throwing The Leader, Ross and Betty into this movie together indicates some type of World War Hulks adaptation\n\nHe's confirmed to be in New World Order and Thunderbolts at the very least. But yeah, can't see him sticking around for too long.\n\nYeah I imagine Thunderbolts will be his final appearance and the team will take his name to honor him\n\nWe got Liv, Natalie, and Rachel back after what's been forever, is there any other actresses we haven't seen in a hot min. (I don't count Gwyneth)\n\nWas gonna say, it's all but certain that we're getting Rulk, but would it be too soon to have Betty Hulk out too?\n\nNow I just need to know what hydra is going to do with the fucking pym particles\n\nIs that from Agents of Shield? Because that doesn't count.\n\nThis movie is going to basically be a sequel to the Incredible Hulk, isn't it?\n\nWe're getting Thunderbolt Ross, The Leader and Betty. All we're missing is Doc Samson.\n\nIs that from Agents of Shield? Because that doesn't count.\n\nThat's from the first Ant-Man film. Darren Cross sell Pym Particles to a Hydra agent.\n\nIs that from Agents of Shield? Because that doesn't count.\n\nNope, in ant-man 1, a hydra agent gets away with a briefcase full of pym particles\n\nMitchell Carson\n\nWe shouldn't let him leave the building.\"\"You've already lied to him, now you want to go to war with him?\"\"Yes! Our scientists haven't come close to replicating his work.Mitchell Carson and Peggy Carter Mitchell Carson is a HYDRA operative who worked undercover for S.H.I.E.L.D. as the Head of...\n\nThis movie is going to be fucking bonkers if it pans out like it's rumored to.\n\nThe whole \"aimless\" crowd will have a tough time spinning Phase 4 not setting up anything"
