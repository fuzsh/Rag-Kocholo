        "text": "Tyler is the daughter of Steven Tyler, the lead singer of Aerosmith, and Bebe Buell, a model and singer. Having grown up with the understanding that rock star Todd Rundgren was her biological father, she only found out the truth about her parentage at age 11, after noticing that Steven Tyler's daughter Mia Tyler looked like her twin. She then changed her name from Liv Rundgren to Liv Tyler. Regarding her first name, she is named after actress Liv Ullmann.\n\nAfter starting a career as a model, she quickly changed into acting. Having been cast almost simultaneously for Silent Fall and Heavy, the filming of Heavy was delayed until she became available. By the age of 20, she had already starred in several successful movies, including Stealing Beauty, That Thing You Do! and Inventing the Abbotts.\n\nAlthough it was her blockbuster appearance in Armageddon (which was released on her 21st birthday) that made her known to a very wide public, she has proven herself in more sophisticated acting challenges such as Onegin (based on the 19th century Russian novel Eugene Onegin by Alexander Pushkin), where she convincingly portrayed the character of Tatyana Larina, and two movies directed by Robert Altman: Cookies Fortune and Dr. T & the Women.\n\nOn March 25, 2003, she married British musician Royston Langdon of the band Spacehog. On December 14, 2004, she gave birth to a son, Milo William Langdon, in a New York hospital.\n\nHer paternal grandfather was Italian. Her other ancestry includes Russian, Native American, and Norwegian."
