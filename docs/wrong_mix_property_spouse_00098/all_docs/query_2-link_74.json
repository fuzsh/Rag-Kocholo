        "text": "On Wednesday, multiple sources confirmed to Golfweek that a private meeting with golf media members took place to outline plans for a new Saudi Arabia-backed golf series with Greg Norman as the expected commissioner.\n\nThe five people spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the series were not to be officially announced until next week. However, on Friday morning news officially dropped that organizers are moving forward with plans.\n\nESPN’s Bob Harig and others reported on Friday that Norman, 66, announced his association with LIV Golf Enterprises, backed by the Public Investment Fund, which operates on behalf of the government of Saudi Arabia. Norman will be chief operating officer of the enterprise, as well as commissioner of the new league.\n\nThe new series hopes to debut in the spring of 2022.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Tim Schmitt\n\nThe PGA Tour has denied its members permission to play in the Saudi-funded golf tournament in London next month. The denials were sent to players who had sought permission late Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIt had been expected that the PGA Tour would grant waivers for the LIV Golf Invitational event near London because of a precedent allowing players limited releases for overseas events. (All members are required to seek a conflicting event release to compete in non-Tour events.)\n\nHowever, it is thought the decision is based on a belief that the event in the U.K. is effectively part of a rival series. LIV Golf, which is funded by the Saudi Arabian regime, has announced a schedule of eight tournaments — the second of which is due to be played July 1-3 in Portland, Oregon — with plans for more to come.\n\nA PGA Tour spokesperson declined to confirm any details regarding what was communicated to members on the releases, but Golfweek obtained the letter sent to PGA Tour members via email regarding the decision on release requests.\n\n“We have notified those who have applied that their request has been declined in accordance with the PGA Tour Tournament Regulations. As such, Tour members are not authorized to participate in the Saudi Golf League’s London event under our Regulations,” said the letter signed by PGA Tour Executive Vice President Tyler Dennis. “As a membership organization, we believe this decision is in the best interest of the PGA Tour and its players.”\n\n“Sadly, the PGA Tour seems intent on denying professional golfers their right to play golf, unless it’s exclusively in a PGA Tour tournament. This is particularly disappointing in light of the Tour’s non-profit status, where its mission is purportedly ‘to promote the common interests of professional tournament golfers,’” said LIV Golf CEO Greg Norman via a statement. “Instead, the Tour is intent on perpetuating its illegal monopoly of what should be a free and open market. The Tour’s action is anti-golfer, anti-fan, and anti-competitive. But no matter what obstacles the PGA Tour puts in our way, we will not be stopped. We will continue to give players options that promote the great game of golf globally.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Eamon Lynch\n\nAfter a slight delay, we finally learned who is heading to London for the LIV Golf Series opener on June 9–11 at the Centurion Golf Club.\n\nAmong those in the field for the debut event for the outfit fronted by Greg Norman and backed by the Saudis is Dustin Johnson, a former No. 1 player in the world who has a pair of majors under his belt. LIV officials had previously insisted the field would be announced last Friday — which is also the day each week the PGA Tour announces fields — but the news wasn’t released until Tuesday night.\n\nOthers listed in the field include Sergio Garcia, Louis Oosthuizen, Ian Poulter and Talor Gooch. Kevin Na and Lee Westwood, long rumored to be on the roster, were also announced as part of the group.\n\nPhil Mickelson was not in the field. but there is still a chance he’s added before the event begins. Also, a number of players will be added after an International Series event this week being played in London.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Tim Schmitt\n\nPhil Mickelson’s name wasn’t on the initial list of players for this week’s LIV Golf Invitational Series opener in London, but did you really think Lefty would miss out?\n\nOn Monday, hours after announcing its plans to stream the inaugural event at Centurion Club outside London, June 9-11, it was also announced that Mickelson would be ending his self-imposed hiatus and teeing it up alongside Dustin Johnson, Kevin Na and the rest of the LIV Golf field.\n\nMickelson released a statement on Twitter where he started by apologizing to people he offended with his comments and praised his “humbling” time away.\n\n“I realize I still have a long way to go but I’m embracing the work ahead. I’m ready to come back to play the game I love but after 32 years, this new path is a fresh start, one that is exciting for me at this stage of my career and is clearly transformative, not just for myself, but ideally for the game and my peers,” wrote Mickelson. “I also love the progressive format and I think it will be exciting for fans. Just as importantly, it will provide balance, allowing me to focus on a healthier approach to life and on and off the course. I am incredibly grateful for what this game and the PGA Tour has given me. I would like to think that I have given back as well but now I’m excited about this new opportunity. I’m thrilled to begin with LIV Golf and I appreciate everyone involved.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Adam Woodard\n\nIn a memo sent to members of the PGA Tour on Thursday, commissioner Jay Monahan was true to his word toward players who opt to play in the LIV Golf Invitational Series.\n\nYou are no longer welcome on the PGA Tour.\n\n“We have followed the Tournament Regulations from start to finish in responding to those players who have decided to turn their backs on the PGA Tour by willfully violating a regulation,” Monahan wrote in the memo obtained by Golfweek. “Simultaneous to you receiving this memo, the players are being notified that they are suspended or otherwise no longer eligible to participate in PGA Tour tournament play, including the Presidents Cup.\n\n“This also applies to all tours sanctioned by the PGA Tour: the Korn Ferry Tour, PGA Tour Champions, PGA Tour Canada and PGA Tour Latinoamérica.”\n\nThe memo was sent shortly after the first tee shots were hit in London in the first LIV Golf Invitational Series events.\n\nAmong those suspended were Phil Mickelson, Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Matt Jones. Also suspended were players who have resigned their membership, including Sergio Garcia, Dustin Johnson, Martin Kaymer, Graeme McDowell, Kevin Na, Louis Oosthuizen and Charl Schwartzel.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Steve DiMeglio\n\nTiger Woods is headed to the BMW Championship this week but not to play golf. He’s going instead to meet with a group of PGA Tour players to discuss the continued encroachment of the LIV Golf Invitational Series.\n\nAccording to reports by the Fire Pit Collective and ESPN’s Mark Schlabach, Woods will be at Wilmington Country Club on Tuesday to meet with a good number of the top-20 ranked players in the world, two days before the first round of the second FedEx Cup Playoffs tournament.\n\nOne player who was invited told ESPN the meeting will include “influential PGA Tour members who haven’t defected to LIV Golf.”\n\nThere is also a PGA Tour Players Advisory Committee meeting on Tuesday. Woods’ meeting, according to ESPN, will take place after that. PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan has a meeting with Tour players Wednesday.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Todd Kelly\n\nThe PGA Tour made some changes and picked up some momentum in its battle with LIV Golf, but the new series will feature some new players at its next event.\n\nOn Tuesday, the upstart circuit led by Greg Norman and backed by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia announced six golfers would be taking their talents to the new series: Cameron Smith, Joaquin Niemann, Marc Leishman, Harold Varner III, Cameron Tringale and Anirban Lahiri.\n\nThe new additions mean LIV Golf now has six of the top 30 players on the Official World Golf Ranking (as of Aug. 21) as it prepares to host its fourth event at the International, Sept. 2-4, near Boston.\n\nWhen asked about his reported interest in LIV Golf after his Open Championship victory, Cameron Smith said, “I don’t know, mate. My team around me worries about all that stuff. I’m here to win golf tournaments.”\n\nReports then broke the week of the FedEx St. Jude Championship at TPC Southwind that he was taking his talents to LIV Golf, but Smith didn’t confirm or deny the news.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Adam Woodard\n\nPhil Mickelson addressed the ongoing battle between the PGA Tour and LIV Golf, saying “the best solution is for us to come together.”\n\nAfter PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan’s recent interview with ESPN, Lefty better not hold his breath. Monahan addressed everything from the Presidents Cup to Tiger Woods’ leadership amid the Tour’s struggles against the upstart circuit led by Greg Norman and backed by the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia. Most importantly, he flat-out said LIV Golf and the PGA Tour cannot work together or coexist.\n\n“I think it’s impractical when you look at the fact that certain players have sued the PGA Tour, their employer has sued the PGA Tour,” said Monahan. “It’s not in the cards. It hasn’t been in the cards and it’s not in the cards. I think we’ve been pretty consistent on that front.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Adam Woodard\n\nNot so fast, LIV Golf, says the Official World Golf Ranking.\n\nIn its quest to earn world ranking points in its events, LIV Golf officials announced a ‘strategic alliance’ with the MENA Tour (Middle East and North Africa). The goal was for LIV’s events to be sanctioned by the Dubai-based developmental tour, which is recognized by the OWGR.\n\nOn Thursday, officials from the OWGR released a statement of their own, announcing that LIV Golf members wouldn’t be receiving OWGR points for its next two events, this week in Bangkok and next week in Jeddah.\n\nThe OWGR said it received communication detailing significant changes to the MENA Tour’s membership structure along with an outline of the initial series of tournaments in the 2022-23 MENA Tour season on Wednesday, and those changes included the first two tournaments of the series, and only on the schedule thus far, were the next two LIV Golf events.\n\n“A review of the changes to the MENA Tour is now underway by the OWGR,” the release said. “Notice of these changes given by the MENA Tour is insufficient to allow OWGR to conduct the customary necessary review ahead of the LIV Golf Invitational Bangkok (Oct. 7-9) and LIV Golf Invitational Jeddah (Oct. 14-16).\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Cameron Jourdan\n\nThe 151st Open Championship is in 264 days. We’re a long way from the opening tee shot at Royal Liverpool, a venue last visited in 2014 where now world No. 1 Rory McIlroy captured his Claret Jug.\n\nHowever, we won’t have to wait that long to hear the R&A’s plans for LIV Golf members.\n\nBack in July, R&A chief executive Martin Slumbers said they had no plans to ban LIV players saying: “Let me be very clear. That’s not on our agenda.”\n\nFast forward three months and his message remains the same.\n\n“We’ll go public in January/February with what we are going to do with regard to LIV golfers. But if you want a guide, go back to what I said in July. We’re not banning anyone. We are not going to betray 150 years of history and have the Open not be open,” Slumbers told Golf Digest this week at the Asia-Pacific Amateur Championship hosted by the R&A, the Asia-Pacific Golf Federation and the Masters.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Riley Hamel\n\nFour teams were left standing for Sunday’s final round of the LIV Golf Team Championship and it was Dustin Johnson’s 4Aces GC who came out on top.\n\nLouis Oosthuizen’s Stinger GC were out of the picture for the majority of the day, leaving the battle for the top three to the 4Aces, Cameron Smith’s Punch GC and Brooks Koepka’s Smash GC. The latter fell off later in the round, leaving a two-way race to the finish.\n\nThe 4Aces led by one stroke with one hole to play before Punch’s Marc Leishman tied the 4Aces at 6 under with a late birdie, just his second of the day. Patrick Reed then delivered a birdie on his final hole to reclaim the lead at 7 under and eventually earn the win after his teammate Johnson made par on the last.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Adam Woodard\n\nAfter winning the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup in August for the third time in his career, Rory McIlroy is in Dubai for the DP World Tour Championship for a chance to sweep the season-long titles on both pro tours.\n\nDespite being winless on the European circuit, McIlroy leads the DP World Tour Rankings thanks to three straight top fives after his win in Atlanta. Over 10 starts, McIlroy has seven top-five finishes with his worst performance coming in January at the Abu Dhabi HSBC Championship (T-12).\n\nJust a ridiculous year.\n\nOn top of his success on the course in 2022, McIlroy has been the loudest voice when it’s come to the PGA Tour vs. LIV Golf battle. However, his tone has changed over the last few months as he’s waiting for the two leagues to sit down, settle the dispute and come to an arrangement for the betterment of the game.\n\nOn Tuesday, he laid out a plan for that to happen.\n\n“Greg (Norman) needs to go. He needs to exit stage left,” McIlroy said. “He’s made his mark but I think now is the right time to say you’ve got this thing off the ground but no one’s going to talk unless there’s an adult in the room that can actually try to mend fences.”\n\nOn Nov. 10, The Telegraph reported LIV was looking to replace Norman with former TaylorMade CEO Mark King. LIV quickly denied the report.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Riley Hamel\n\nTiger Woods addressed the media ahead of his 2022 Hero World Challenge – where he withdrew due to plantar fasciitis – and was naturally peppered with questions regarding Greg Norman, LIV Golf and the future of professional golf itself.\n\nThe 15-time major champion didn’t hold back.\n\n“I think (Greg Norman) has to go, first of all,” said Woods on Tuesday from Albany in the Bahamas, “and then obviously the litigation against us and then our countersuit against them. Those would then have to be at a stay as well, then we can talk, we can all talk freely.\n\n“Right now as it is, not right now, not with their leadership, not with Greg there and his animosity towards the tour itself. I don’t see that happening,” said Woods of LIV and the PGA Tour coexisting. “But why would you change anything if you’ve got a lawsuit against you? They sued us first.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Adam Woodard\n\nAtul Khosla, LIV Golf’s Chief Operating Officer, has stepped down from his post, according to The New York Times, leaving the Saudi-backed circuit without one of its most experienced sports executives.\n\nDespite the ever-looming presence of Greg Norman as the league’s face and voice, Khosla was believed to be the man to lead the breakaway organization toward legitimacy in the sports world.\n\nBefore he served as LIV’s COO, Khosla was the chief corporate development and brand officer for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\n“I look forward to being a part of the LIV Golf Investments team to help bring this vision to life and transform the game into an international sport,” Khosla said in a release after his hiring.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Riley Hamel\n\nEarly this week, rumors began to swirl that LIV Golf was finally in agreement to come to a TV near you. David Feherty, who joined the Saudi-backed league last year, hinted at the upcoming deal during a show in Florida.\n\nNow, the news becomes official.\n\nThe CW Network and LIV have agreed on a multi-year broadcast deal. The CW will air all 14 events throughout next season as well as offer a streaming option through its app.\n\n“This is a momentous day for LIV Golf as this partnership is about more than just media rights. The CW will provide accessibility for our fans and maximum exposure for our athletes and partners as their reach includes more than 120 million households across the United States,” said Greg Norman, CEO of LIV Golf, in a release. “We’re very proud to note how consequential it is that a league that has only existed for one year has secured a full broadcast deal in its debut full league season.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Riley Hamel\n\nThe PGA Tour board on Tuesday night ratified a radical new approach for the 2024 schedule that will see reduced fields in the new designated events and the removal of the 36-hole cut.\n\nFields in designated events will be reduced to between 70 and 78 players with no halfway cut. The changes will not apply to all of the elevated events— the majors, the Players Championship and the FedEx Cup playoff tournaments will be unaffected.\n\nTwo sources familiar with the details confirmed the changes to Golfweek.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Eamon Lynch\n\nSergio Garcia, Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and Richard Bland have officially resigned from the DP World Tour, according to a news release from the European circuit.\n\nThe players “were sanctioned for serious breaches of the Tour’s Conflicting Tournament Regulation committed last June,” according to the release.\n\n“The DP World Tour would like to take this opportunity to thank the four players for the contribution they have made to the Tour and in particular to Sergio, Ian and Lee for the significant part they have played in Europe’s success in the Ryder Cup over many years.\n\n“Their resignations, however, along with the sanctions imposed upon them, are a consequence of their own choices.\n\n“As we have consistently maintained throughout the past year, the Tour has a responsibility to its entire membership to administer the member regulations which each player signs up to. These regulations are in place to protect the collective interests of all DP World Tour members.”\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Riley Hamel and Cameron Jourdan\n\nThe United States Department of Justice is ramping up its investigation into how former President Donald Trump has handled classified documents since his time in office ended. But what does that have to do with golf?\n\nAccording to a New York Times report, amid the larger investigation the DOJ has subpoenaed the Trump Organization for records regarding LIV Golf and President Trump’s ties to the upstart circuit financially backed by Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund.\n\nIn LIV Golf’s inaugural season last year, Trump National Bedminster and Trump National Doral both hosted events. The pair of properties will do so again in 2023, as will his resort in Potomac Falls, Virginia, outside of Washington, D.C.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Adam Woodard\n\nPhil Mickelson is one of a handful of players who have been interviewed with regard to the United States Department of Justice’s antitrust investigation of the PGA Tour.\n\nAccording to a New York Times report, Mickelson and fellow LIV Golf League players Bryson DeChambeau and Sergio Garcia have all been interviewed. The Justice Department reportedly met with PGA Tour lawyers earlier this week in Washington, D.C., but the timeline for the review remains unclear.\n\nLast July news broke that the Department of Justice was investigating whether the Tour engaged in anticompetitive behavior against Greg Norman-led and Saudi Arabia-funded LIV Golf. The upstart circuit has long been criticized as another way for the Saudi government to sportswash its human rights record via its Public Investment Fund.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Adam Woodard\n\nLIV Golf picked up a rare win in its antitrust lawsuit against the PGA Tour.\n\nLast month Judge Beth Labson Freeman ruled in the U.S. Northern District of California court that Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund – the Kingdom’s sovereign wealth fund – as well as its governor Yasir Al-Rumayyan were both subject to discovery and depositions in the United States, a major blow to LIV’s legal team.\n\nLIV’s lawyers then appealed the decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in order to further delay the discovery process. On Wednesday, Judge Freeman granted the PIF and Al-Rumayyan’s motion for a stay of discovery pending the appeal, a decision that could take 1-2 years according to Jodi Balsam, a professor at Brooklyn Law School and former counsel for the NFL.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nWritten by Adam Woodard"
