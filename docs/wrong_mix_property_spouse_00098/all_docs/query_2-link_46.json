No, it's just that *every* time Liv Tyler is mentioned,\n\n> Steve \"Sperm Doner\" Tyler is mentioned, where Todd *could* be mentioned.\n\n> Steve Tyler doen't need the publicity, where Todd does.\n\nI share the sentiment but I wonder if, perhaps, a more accurate statement\n\nwould be \"Todd's fans (i.e. us) would rather see him get the publicity\n\nthan some deadbeat dad musician of questionable talent, even if the\n\ndeadbeat dad is the lead singer of an extremely popular group.\"\n\nThe issue of Todd's relative fame, or lack of it, has been a frequent\n\ntopic of discussion among his fans. I hear songs off of every project that\n\nI think should be smash hits, but never are. We've all heard \"Todd who?\"\n\nso often we're likely to scream if we hear it again. I think what those of\n\nus who sometimes would like Todd's music to be more popular have to\n\nremember is that, to a large extent, how popular his music is depends\n\nlargely on him. I don't know him and would never presume to speak for him\n\nbut I have to think that he prefers things as they are. S/A was a\n\ncommercial success. As I understand it, it still sells amazingly well for\n\nan album thats over 20 years old. What was his response -- AWATS, an\n\namazing album in a lot of ways but certainly not put together with radio\n\nairplay in mind. HOMH probably sold fairly well as it contained \"Can We\n\nStill Be Friends\". It was followed by Healing. TEPTAE contained \"Bang the\n\nDrum\". It was followed up by A Cappella. That pattern of following up\n\n\"radio friendly\" with more personal, even experiemental projects probably\n\ndrove the record company executives to drink. It's very difficult to\n\nmarket what you can't package.\n\nI think I saw someone else here state that they admired Todd's ability to\n\nreinvent himself with every album. I guess I look at it a little bit\n\ndifferently. I look at each album as part of an on-going experiment in\n\nfinding new musical styles and techniques for the presentation of ideas\n\nthat really haven't changed that much over the years. At the core of those\n\nideas is the message: Care about other people and the world around you but\n\nfind, choose, and walk your own road; regardless of what others know (or\n\ndon't know), think (or don't think), or feel (or don't feel) about who you\n\nare and what you do.\n\nChris Brown\n\nclb...@mail.idt.net\n\nI wrote:\n\n>>Chris Williams wrote:\n\n>>>\n\n>>> I, for one, am getting quite tired of reading about Liv \"Tyler\"\n\n>>> and her \"famous rock star father Steve Tyler of Areosmith\".\n\n>>> The truth is, Bebe Buell had an affair (closer to a one night stand)\n\n>>> with Steve Tyler.

Thanks for the information, he said,\n\ncorrecting himself.\n\nwww.papermag.com/magazine/tyler/\n\nTyler recalls an idyllic childhood of \"cookouts, inner-tubing and\n\nswimming in the lake\" in\n\nMaine, where she lived in \"a big, beautiful house\" with her mother,\n\nformer model and\n\nnotorious backstage diva Bebe Buell, and numerous maternal relatives.\n\nShe was raised\n\nbelieving that rocker Todd Rundgren was her father, although she says\n\nshe didn't live\n\nwith him or see him everyday. I ask about the first time she remembers\n\nmeeting her real\n\ndad. \"I fell completely head over heels in love with him,\" she says, a\n\nsmile stretching\n\nacross her face. \"I met him when I was around nine. We spent the whole\n\nnight together\n\nsinging and playing. When I left, we were both so sad and we hugged\n\nand hugged. I\n\nwent home and put his poster on my wall. He started sending me Easter\n\nand Christmas\n\npresents. I had these big red lips he gave me and all these stuffed\n\nanimals that I slept\n\nwith. They were so sacred to me.\" Had Liv figured out yet that this\n\ngenerous and\n\naffectionate family \"friend\" was in fact her father? \"Not then. I just\n\nloved him so much\n\nand I didn't know why.\"\n\nWhen Tyler was 11, she accompanied her mother to see Aerosmith in\n\nconcert. \"Guns\n\nN' Roses was on, and there was this girl standing to the left of the\n\nstage who looked\n\nexactly like me, except she was a little chubbier, a little shorter\n\nand a little younger. We\n\nboth had on spandex, T-shirts and sneakers, with really long, permed\n\nhair. I looked at\n\nher and then I looked over at my mom. She had tears in her eyes. We\n\nwent off to a\n\nbench in the woods and she told me everything.\" Tyler pulls a nubbie\n\noff her red\n\ncardigan and releases a humming sigh. \"That was quite a night for\n\neverybody - my\n\nmother, my father, my father's wife.\""
