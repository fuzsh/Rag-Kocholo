It is probably a rare example of how meeting someone at a frat party actually turned out well. A week later, he took her out on their first date to go mini-golfing. Joey was so nervous, he accidentally left the lights on in his car, and later they had to ask around to get a jump- very memorable! The rest is history, and they fell happily in love with one another.\n\nIn October of 2015, Shelby's dad was diagnosed with Stage 4 brain cancer, and was given until Christmas to live. Shelby remembers the night, she found out after one of her classes as she was walking back to her house. It’s all sort of a blur for her, but Joey was there within minutes, and held her all night as she cried to him. Over the next few months, Shelby made countless trips to and from Orange County every weekend to help her mom take care of her dad, and spend time with her dad in his last few months. Whether it was driving Shelby to the airport, or coming to Colorado to help, Joey was there literally every step of the way. It was during this time that it became apparent to Shelby that he was her forever. In March of 2016, Shelby's dad passed away, and to no one’s surprise, Joey was there- a steady source of love and comfort through the greatest pain in her life.

Piyush says it was love at first sight, but he'll leave the cheese for the fondue. They started talking about their favorite things and found so much in common right off the bat. From loving the same music, learning they're both dancers, to even how they both liked our coffee in the morning.

Luckily, there was a fraternity event the upcoming weekend and Piyush had some charm up my sleeve.\n\nThe next weekend, Piyush devised an entire plan including, and not limited to, a party limousine, ice luges, and their favorite chai/coffee.

They officially started dating in the end of 2013 and have been together even since.\n\nIn 2017, a year after they graduated from Chapman, Piyush moved back home to grow his family's business in India. And here began the toughest part of the relationship, 'long-distance'. To be honest, it tested both of them to the best of their abilities and they still loved each other enough to stay up at night and go to work late in the morning just so they could make the most of our \"FaceTime Dates\". They ended up meeting each other for vacations in Thailand, just so they could meet halfway and explore the world together. This lasted one and a half years until...\n\nIn 2019, Piyush moved to LA to pursue another college degree at FIDM, and he moved in with Shantae. Happiest decision he ever made. They made up for all the time lost by travelling the United States and finally being together. By the end of 2019, Piyush asked Shantae to marry him, and she said \"YES!\". In December of the same year, Shantae decided to move back to India with Piyush so they could plan their big, fat, Indian wedding. Happiest decision she ever made.\n\nIn 2020, the year of the pandemic, they had an engagement party in February, got locked up in their house with the rest of the world, got married on paper in July, and FINALLY had their Indian wedding on December 11th, 2020 (Almost 7 years after they started dating).
