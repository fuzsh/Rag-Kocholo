        "text": "‘I have used Latham’s Sports practices in an extensive and ongoing manner and continue to be thrilled with the work output, emotional intelligence and industry knowledge across the team. Latham’s sports team is an undisputed industry leader given its unique combination of commercial knowledge of the industry, shrewd and pragmatic legal advice, and exceptional interpersonal ability. Latham consistently finds ways to solve problems and demonstrates a desire to make deals happen in the face of challenges by deciphering cutting-edge structuring tactics rather than shying away due to a challenge.’\n\n‘The Latham team continually distinguish themselves from other leading firms through their impeccable and timely work product, valuable industry knowledge, strong emotional intelligence and deep tenure in the space. The Latham team provide accurate, creative, intelligent work, and they’re a ton of fun to work alongside.’\n\n‘Amongst the talented attorneys at Latham, Frank Saviano, Adam Rosenthal, and Rachel Klein stand out because they work extremely hard to consistently produce terrific work while fostering a collaborative, fun and contagious culture. Their unique combination of IQ and EQ will continue to set them far apart in the industry and I plan to use Latham largely exclusively going forward. I would be delighted to discuss further.’\n\n‘The team has great expertise and is very international, allowing us to obtain seasoned expertise almost everywhere in the world.’\n\n‘The team is highly experienced, knowledgeable and responsive.’\n\n‘Adam Sullins is the lead partner- he bring great experience, is thorough, most responsive, a balanced negotiator and overall very good at managing process and people which is sometimes the most important part since almost all attorneys leading law firms/departments of this stature would have sound legal acumen.’\n\n‘The Paul Weiss sports practice is the go-to-choice for me and many big-name sports clients who need help with their toughest matters. I routinely turned to Chris Boehning and the team and cannot say enough good things about them. If you’re in the sports industry, you want Paul, Weiss on your side. They see the big picture in any matter and understand how everything in the sports world connects – from owners to leagues to marketing to regulations – and they give you advice that works across the board. They have a bunch of incredible lawyers who are extremely talented and super responsive which is what you want as a client. The unparalleled knowledge and expertise the team has regarding the international and domestic sports world gives them the ability to deliver unmatched results.’\n\n‘Chris Boehning is one of the stand-out partners and is a driving force behind Paul, Weiss’s Sports Practice. Engaging with Chris on various sports law matters over the years has shown me the meaning of premier counsel. As an executive in the industry navigating high-pressure situations daily, I greatly appreciate working with someone who grasps the unique ecosystem and moves rapidly yet judiciously like Chris. I have called Chris for his industry knowledge, and he was able to connect with me leading sports lawyers in another jurisdiction. He is truly outstanding.’\n\n‘The team was first class from top to bottom. Always responsive, informative and very, very knowledgeable and always patient in explaining details to “laypeople”. Could not be in better hands than working with this team of smart and caring people.’\n\n‘David Lender was an incredible lead on our case from start to finish. Both he and his team were outstanding in every way. Zach Schreiber was a standout for his communication skills, knowledge, and genuine caring about clients was evident right from the start and never changed. An incredible effort and calm, thoughtful approach to all aspects of our case made a huge difference.’"
