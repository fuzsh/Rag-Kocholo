How do you see your participation in the Bonner Program relating to them?\n\nMy educational journey at W&L University is driven by a profound desire to utilize technology as a catalyst for positive change, particularly in the realms of LGBTQ+ rights and social equity. My long-term aspiration is to contribute my skills and knowledge within the United Nations' Office of Information and Communications Technology, where I envision leveraging my engineering background to advance initiatives that promote equality for gender diverse individuals and empower marginalized communities worldwide.\n\nMy participation in the Bonner Program serves as a pivotal platform for me to translate my academic pursuits into tangible actions within my local Lexington community. I am particularly inspired by the Program's emphasis on civic engagement and service, which aligns seamlessly with the values upheld by UN.\n\nIn essence, my involvement in the Bonner Program represents a strategic investment in my overarching educational and career goals, providing me with the hands-on experience, skills, and perspective necessary to make meaningful differences in local and global communities worldwide."
