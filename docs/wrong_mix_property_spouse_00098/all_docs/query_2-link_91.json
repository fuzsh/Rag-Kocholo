This manhunt was spearheaded by her dad, Thaddeus Ross, who will also be a part of Captain America 4. Thaddeus Ross has seen more appearances than his daughter, appearing in Captain America: Civil War and the two Avengers films of Phase 3, all portrayed by the late William Hurt. For this upcoming Captain America film, he will be portrayed by Harrison Ford.\n\nRELATED:\n\nFeatured\n\nHeadlining the cast is Anthony Mackie, whose character of Sam Wilson took up the mantle of Captain America during The Falcon and the Winter Soldier series on Disney+. Returning from that series is Carl Lumbly as Isaiah Bradley and Danny Ramirez as Joaquin Torres. Returning from The Incredible Hulk is Tim Blake Nelson as Samuel Sterns. Newcomer to the MCU Shira Haas will also be part of the cast as a character labelled Sabra.\n\nDirected by Julius Onah, Captain America: New World Order is currently shooting in Atlanta. A May 3, 2024 date has been set for the film’s theatrical release.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\nFeatured\n\nSource: The Hollywood Reporter\n\nJoin The Team\n\nLatest News\n\nFeatured\n\nFeatured"
