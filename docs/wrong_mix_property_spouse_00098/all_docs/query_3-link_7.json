        "text": "amnada renee fugate contact\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. (d/b/a WWE) is an American publicly traded, privately controlled entertainment company that deals primarily in professional wrestling, with major revenue sources also coming from film, music, product licensing, and direct product sales. WWE also refers to the professional wrestling promotion itself, founded by Jess McMahon and Toots Mondt in 1953 as Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd. As of 2014, it is the largest wrestling promotion in the world, holding over 300 events a year, and broadcasting to about 36 million viewers in more than 150 countries.[8] The company's headquarters are located in Stamford, Connecticut, with offices in major cities across the world.[9][10] The company promotes under two main roster brands: Raw[11] and SmackDown,[12] and a developmental brand NXT.[13][14]\n\nAs in other professional wrestling promotions, WWE shows are not legitimate contests, but purely entertainment-based, featuring storyline-driven, scripted, and choreographed matches, though they often include moves that can put performers at risk of injury if not performed correctly. This was first publicly acknowledged by WWE's owner Vince McMahon in 1989 to avoid taxes from athletic commissions. Since the 1980s, WWE publicly has branded their product as sports entertainment, which is considered to acknowledge the product's roots in competitive sport and dramatic theater.\n\nThe company's majority owner is its chairman and CEO, Vince McMahon. Along with his wife Linda, children Shane and Stephanie, and son-in-law Paul Levesque (known professionally as Triple H), the McMahon family holds approximately 70% of WWE's equity and 96% of the voting power. As of August 2014, due to ongoing problems with the company, Eminence Capital, a New York-based hedge fund, acquired 9.6% stake of WWE while the McMahon family retains 90.4% interest.[15]\n\nThe current entity, incorporated on February 21, 1980, was previously known as Titan Sports, Inc., founded in 1979 in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts. It acquired Capitol Wrestling Corporation (the holding company for the World Wrestling Federation, WWF) in 1982. Titan was renamed World Wrestling Federation, Inc. in 1998, then World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. in 1999, and finally World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc. in 2002. Since 2011, the company has officially branded itself solely as WWE though the company's legal name was not changed.[16][17]\n\nCompany history[]\n\nPrior to Titan Sports[]\n\nWWE's origins can be traced back to January 7, 1953 when Roderick James \"Jess\" McMahon and Toots Mondt created the Capitol Wrestling Corporation Ltd. (CWC), which joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) that same year. McMahon, who was a successful boxing promoter, began working with Tex Rickard in 1926. With the help of Rickard, he began promoting boxing at the third Madison Square Garden. It was not the first time he had promoted wrestling cards, as he had already done so during the 1910s.\n\nIn November 1954, McMahon died and Ray Fabiani, one of Mondt's associates, brought in McMahon's son Vincent James.[18] The younger McMahon and Mondt were very successful and soon controlled approximately 70% of the NWA's booking, largely due to their dominance in the heavily populated Northeast region. In 1963, McMahon and Mondt had a dispute with the NWA over \"Nature Boy\" Buddy Rogers being booked to hold the NWA World Heavyweight Championship.[19] Both men left the company in protest and formed the WWWF in the process, awarding Rogers the new WWWF World Heavyweight Championship in April of that year. He lost the championship to Bruno Sammartino a month later on May 17, 1963, after suffering a heart attack a week before the match.\n\nCapitol operated the WWWF in a conservative manner compared to other pro wrestling territories:[20] it ran its major arenas monthly rather than weekly or bi-weekly, usually featuring a babyface champion wrestling various heels in programs that consisted of one to three matches.[21] After gaining a television program deal and hiring Lou Albano as a manager for Sammartino's heel opponents, the WWWF was doing sellout business by 1970.\n\nMondt left Capitol in the late sixties and although the WWWF had withdrawn from the NWA, Vince McMahon, Sr. quietly re-joined in 1971. Capitol renamed the World Wide Wrestling Federation to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in 1979.[22]\n\nTitan Sports, Inc.[]\n\nGolden Age[]\n\nVincent J. McMahon's son, Vincent K. McMahon, and his wife Linda, established Titan Sports, Inc., in 1979 in South Yarmouth, Massachusetts.[23][24] The company was incorporated on February 21, 1980, in the Cape Cod Coliseum offices. The younger McMahon bought Capitol from his father in 1982, effectively seizing control of the company. Seeking to make the WWF the premier wrestling promotion in the country, and eventually, the world, he began an expansion process that fundamentally changed the wrestling business.[25]\n\nAt the annual meeting of the NWA in 1983, the McMahons and Capitol employee Jim Barnett all withdrew from the organization.[19] McMahon also worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States. This angered other promoters and disrupted the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions, eventually ending the territory system, which was in use since the founding of the NWA in the 1940s. In addition, the company used income generated by advertising, television deals, and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters.\n\nMcMahon gained significant traction when he hired AWA talent Hulk Hogan, who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling, notably for his appearance in the film Rocky III.[26] McMahon signed Roddy Piper as Hogan's rival, and then shortly afterward Jesse Ventura as an announcer. Other wrestlers joined the roster, such as Jimmy Snuka, Don Muraco, The Iron Sheik, Nikolai Volkoff, Junkyard Dog, Paul Orndorff, Greg Valentine, and Ricky Steamboat. Many of the wrestlers who would join later were former AWA or NWA talent.\n\nThe WWF would tour nationally in a venture that would require a huge capital investment, one that placed the WWF on the verge of financial collapse. The future of McMahon's experiment came down to the success or failure of McMahon's groundbreaking concept, WrestleMania. WrestleMania was a major success, and was (and still is) marketed as the Super Bowl of professional wrestling. The concept of a wrestling supercard was nothing new in North America; the NWA had begun running Starrcade a few years prior. In McMahon's eyes, however, what separated WrestleMania from other supercards was that it was intended to be accessible to those who did not watch wrestling. He invited celebrities such as Mr. T, Muhammad Ali, and Cyndi Lauper to participate in the event, as well as securing a deal with MTV to provide coverage. The event and hype surrounding it led to the term Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection, due to the cross-promotion of pop-culture and professional wrestling.\n\nThe WWF business expanded significantly on the shoulders of McMahon and his babyface hero Hulk Hogan for the next several years. The introduction of Saturday Night's Main Event on NBC in 1985 marked the first time that professional wrestling had been broadcast on network television since the 1950s, when the now-defunct DuMont Television Network broadcast matches of Vince McMahon Sr.'s Capitol Wrestling Corporation. The 1980s \"Wrestling Boom\" peaked with the WrestleMania III pay-per-view at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1987, which set an attendance record of 93,173, a record that stood for 29 years until WrestleMania 32.[27] A rematch of the WrestleMania III main event between WWF champion Hulk Hogan and André the Giant took place on The Main Event in 1988 and was seen by 33 million people, the most-watched wrestling match in North American television history.[28]\n\nIn 1985, Titan moved its offices to Stamford, Connecticut, before the present building was built nearby in 1991. Subsequently, a new Titan Sports, Inc. (originally WWF, Inc.) was established in Delaware in 1987 and was consolidated with the Massachusetts entity in February 1988.[29]\n\nNew Generation (1993–1997)[]\n\nThe WWF was hit with allegations of steroid abuse and distribution in 1992 and was followed by allegations of sexual harassment by WWF employees the following year.[30] McMahon was eventually exonerated, but it brought bad public relations for the WWF, and overall bad reputation. The steroid trial cost the company an estimated $5 million at a time of record low revenues. This helped drive many WWF wrestlers over to rival promotion World Championship Wrestling (WCW), including 1980s babyface hero Hulk Hogan. During this period, the WWF promoted wrestlers of a younger age comprising \"The New Generation\", featuring Shawn Michaels, Diesel, Razor Ramon, Bret Hart, and The Undertaker, in an effort to promote new talent into the spotlight.\n\nIn January 1993, the WWF debuted its flagship cable program Monday Night Raw. WCW countered in September 1995 with its own Monday night program, Monday Nitro, which aired in the same time slot as Raw.[31] The two programs would trade wins in the ensuing ratings competition (known as the \"Monday Night Wars\") until mid-1996. At that point, Nitro began a nearly two-year ratings domination that was largely fueled by the introduction of the New World Order (nWo), a stable led by former WWF performers Hulk Hogan, Scott Hall (the former Razor Ramon), and Kevin Nash (the former Diesel).[32]\n\nThe Attitude Era (1997–2001)[]\n\nAs the Monday Night Wars continued between Raw Is War and WCW's Nitro, the WWF would transform itself from a family-friendly product into a more adult oriented product, known as the Attitude Era. The era was spearheaded by WWF VP Shane McMahon (son of owner Vince McMahon) and head writer Vince Russo.\n\n1997 ended with McMahon facing real-life controversy following Bret Hart's controversial departure from the company, dubbed as the Montreal Screwjob.[33] This proved to be one of several founding factors in the launch of the Attitude Era as well as the creation of McMahon's on-screen character, \"Mr. McMahon\".\n\nPrior to the Montreal Screwjob, which took place at the 1997 Survivor Series, former WCW talent were being hired by the WWF, including Stone Cold Steve Austin, Mankind, and Vader. Austin was slowly brought in as the new face of the company despite being promoted as an antihero, starting with his \"Austin 3:16\" speech shortly after defeating Jake Roberts in the tournament finals at the King of the Ring pay-per-view in 1996.[34]\n\nWorld Wrestling Federation, Inc./World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc.[]\n\nOn May 6, 1998, Titan Sports, Inc. was renamed World Wrestling Federation, Inc. It was renamed World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. a year later.\n\nOn April 29, 1999, the WWF made its return to terrestrial television, airing a special program known as SmackDown! on the fledgling UPN network. The Thursday night show became a weekly series on August 26, 1999—competing directly with WCW's Thursday night program Thunder on TBS. In 2000, the WWF, in collaboration with television network NBC, announced the creation of the XFL, a new professional football league that debuted in 2001.[35] The league had high ratings for the first few weeks, but initial interest waned and its ratings plunged to dismally low levels (one of its games was the lowest-rated prime-time show in the history of American television). NBC walked out on the venture after only one season, but McMahon intended to continue alone. However, after being unable to reach a deal with UPN, McMahon shut down the XFL.[36]\n\nOn October 19, 1999, World Wrestling Federation, Inc. launched an initial public offering as a publicly traded company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the issuance of stock then valued at $172.5 million.[37] The company has traded on the NYSE since its launch under ticker symbol WWE.[38]\n\nAcquisition of WCW and ECW[]\n\nBy the fall of 1999, the Attitude Era had turned the tide of the Monday Night Wars into WWF's favor. After Time Warner merged with AOL, Ted Turner's control over WCW was considerably reduced, and the newly merged company announced a complete lack of interest in professional wrestling as a whole, and decided to sell WCW in its entirety. Although Eric Bischoff, whom Time Warner fired as WCW president in October 1999, was nearing a deal to purchase the company, in March 2001 McMahon acquired the rights to WCW's trademarks, tape library, contracts, and other properties from AOL Time Warner for a number reported to be around $7 million.[39] Shortly after WrestleMania X-Seven, the WWF launched the Invasion storyline integrating the incoming talent roster from WCW and Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW). With this purchase, WWF now became by far the largest wrestling promotion in the world. The assets of ECW, which had folded after filing for bankruptcy protection in April 2001, were purchased by WWE in mid-2003.[40]\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment, Inc./WWE[]\n\nOn May 5, 2002, World Wrestling Federation Entertainment announced it was changing both its company name and the name of its wrestling promotion to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Although mainly caused by an unfavorable ruling in its dispute with the World Wide Fund for Nature regarding the \"WWF\" initialism, the company noted it provided an opportunity to emphasize its focus on entertainment.[41]\n\nOn April 7, 2011, WWE corporate announced that the company was ceasing use of the full name World Wrestling Entertainment and would henceforth refer to itself solely as WWE, making the latter an orphan initialism. This was said to reflect WWE's global entertainment expansion away from the ring with the ultimate goal of acquiring entertainment companies and putting a focus on television, live events, and film production. WWE noted that their new company model was put into effect with the relaunch of Tough Enough, being a non–scripted program (contrary to the scripted nature of professional wrestling) and with the launch of the WWE Network (at the time scheduled to launch in 2012; later pushed back to 2014). However, the legal name of the company remains as World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc.[17]\n\nBrand extension[]\n\nMain article: WWE brand extension\n\nIn March 2002, WWE decided to create two separate rosters, each appearing on one of their main programs, Raw and SmackDown!, due to the overabundance of talent left over from the Invasion storyline. This was dubbed as the \"Brand Extension\". Despite much of the originally drafted talent departing by 2004, WWE continued to separate the shows, taking on younger talent, and holding a draft lottery every year. On May 26, 2006, WWE announced the relaunch of ECW as a WWE brand. The new ECW program aired until February 16, 2010.[42]\n\nBeginning with the August 29, 2011 episode of Raw, it was announced that Raw would feature talent from both Raw and SmackDown, and would be known as Raw Supershow (the \"Supershow\" suffix would be dropped on July 23, 2012). Championships previously exclusive to one show or the other were available for wrestlers from any show to compete for; the \"Supershow\" format would mark the end of the brand extension, as all programming and live events since the initial announcement was made have featured the full WWE roster.[43]\n\nIn 2013, the company built a sports medicine and training center in east Orange County, Florida in partnership with Full Sail University in Winter Park, Florida. The training facility is targeted at career development for wrestlers and athletic development.[44]\n\nOn May 25, 2016, WWE announced the re-launch of the brand extension. Dubbed the \"New Era\", Raw and SmackDown will each feature their own unique rosters with a draft to determine rosters. SmackDown will also move from Thursdays to Tuesday nights beginning July 19, and will air live instead of the previous pre-recorded format.[45]\n\nWWE Network[]\n\nMain article: WWE Network\n\nOn February 24, 2014, WWE launched a 24/7 streaming network. The network includes past and present WWE shows, pay-per-views, and shows from the WWE Library.[46] The network reached 1,000,000 subscribers on January 27, 2015 under one year of its launch, with WWE claiming that it was thus \"the fastest-growing digital subscription service ever\".[47]\n\nTerminology[]\n\nWWE uses a variety of special terms in defining their product, such as describing the wrestling industry as sports entertainment. The fan base is referred to as \"the WWE Universe\". A wrestler is known as a \"WWE Superstar\", while retired wrestlers are known as \"WWE Legends\".[48]\n\nWWE stock and corporate governance[]\n\nOn October 19, 1999, WWF, which had been owned previously by parent company Titan Sports, launched an initial public offering as a publicly traded company, trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) with the issuance of stock then valued at $172.5 million.[37] The company has traded on the NYSE since its launch under ticker symbol WWE.[38]\n\nThe company has actively marketed itself as a publicly traded company through presentations at investor conferences and other investor relations initiatives.[49] In June 2003, the company began paying a dividend on its shares of $0.04 per share.[50] In June 2011, the company cut its dividend from $0.36 to $0.12.[51] In 2014, concerns about the company's viability caused wide fluctuations in its share price.[52]\n\nAs of 2015, the company's Board of Directors has eight members: Vince McMahon, the company's Chairman of the Board and CEO; Stuart U. Goldfarb, President of Fullbridge, Inc.; Patricia A. Gottesman, former President and CEO of Crimson Hexagon; David Kenen, the former Executive Vice President of the Hallmark Channel; Joseph H. Perkins, former President of Communications Consultants; Frank A. Riddick, III, CEO of Shale-Inland Group, Inc.; Jeffrey R. Speed, former Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Six Flags; Laureen Ong, former President of Travel Channel; Stephanie McMahon, Chief Brand Officer of WWE; Paul \"Triple H\" Levesque, Executive Vice-president, Talent, live events, and creative.[53]\n\nContracts[]\n\nWWE signs most of their talent to exclusive contracts, meaning talent can appear or perform only on WWE programming and events. They are not permitted to appear or perform for another promotion, unless special arrangements are made beforehand. WWE keeps all wrestlers' salary, employment length, benefits, and all other contract details strictly private.[54]\n\nWWE classifies its professional wrestlers as independent contractors and not as employees. A study by the University of Louisville Law Review found that after applying the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) 20-factor test, 16 factors \"clearly indicate that wrestlers are employees\". However, as a result of WWE terming them as independent contractors, \"the wrestlers are denied countless benefits to which they would otherwise be entitled\".[55]\n\nWellness Program[]\n\nThe World Wrestling Federation had a drug-testing policy in place as early as 1987, initially run by an in-house administrator. In 1991, wrestlers were subjected to independent testings for anabolic steroids for the first time.[56] The independent testing was ceased in 1996.[57]\n\nThe Talent Wellness Program is a comprehensive drug, alcohol, and cardiac screening program initiated in February 2006, shortly after the sudden death of one of their highest profile talents, 38-year-old Eddie Guerrero.[58] The policy tests for recreational drug use and abuse of prescription medication, including anabolic steroids.[58] Under the guidelines of the policy, talent is also tested annually for pre-existing or developing cardiac issues. The drug testing is handled by Aegis Sciences Corporation; the cardiac evaluations are handled by New York Cardiology Associates P.C.[58] The Wellness Policy requires that all talent \"under contract to WWE who regularly perform in-ring services as a professional sports entertainer\" undergo testing; however, part-timers are exempt from testing.[59]\n\nAfter the double-murder and suicide committed by one of its performers, Chris Benoit, with a possible link to steroid abuse encouraged by WWE, the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform requested that WWE turn over any material regarding its talent wellness policy.[60]\n\nIn August 2007, WWE and its employees defended the program in the wake of several busts of illegal pharmacy that linked WWE performers to steroid purchases even after the policy was put into place. Ten professional wrestlers were suspended for violating the Wellness Policy after reports emerged they were all customers of Signature Pharmacy in Orlando, Florida. According to a statement attributed to WWE attorney Jerry McDevitt, an eleventh wrestler was later added to the suspension list.[61][62][63]\n\nBecause of the Wellness Policy, physicians were able to diagnose one of its performers with a heart ailment that would otherwise likely have gone unnoticed until it was too late. In August 2007, then-reigning United States Champion Montel Vontavious Porter (real name Hassan Assad) was diagnosed with Wolff–Parkinson–White syndrome,[64] which can be potentially fatal if gone undiagnosed. The ailment was discovered while Assad was going through a routine Wellness Policy checkup.\n\nOn September 13, 2010, WWE updated their list of banned substances to include muscle relaxers.[65]\n\nLegal disputes[]\n\nWWF name dispute[]\n\nIn 1994, Titan Sports had entered into an agreement with the World Wide Fund for Nature (also trademarked WWF), an environmental organization, regarding Titan's use of the \"WWF\" acronym, which both organizations had been using since at least March 1979. Under the agreement, Titan had agreed to cease using the written acronym \"WWF\" in connection with its wrestling promotion, and to minimize (though not eliminate) spoken uses of \"WWF\" on its broadcasts, particularly in scripted comments. In exchange, the environmental group (and its national affiliates) agreed to drop any pending litigation against Titan, and furthermore agreed not to challenge Titan's use of the full \"World Wrestling Federation\" name or the promotion's then-current logo.[66]\n\nIn 2000, the World Wide Fund for Nature sued World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc. in the United Kingdom, alleging various violations of the 1994 agreement.[67] The Court of Appeal agreed that the promotion company had violated the 1994 agreement, particularly in regards to merchandising. The last televised event to market the WWF logo was the UK-based pay-per-view Insurrextion 2002. On May 5, 2002, the company launched its \"Get The F Out\" marketing campaign and changed all references on its website from \"WWF\" to \"WWE\", while switching the URL from WWF.com to WWE.com.[41] The next day, a press release announced the official name change from World Wrestling Federation Entertainment, Inc. to World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc., or WWE, and the change was publicized later that day during a telecast of Monday Night Raw, which was broadcast from the Hartford Civic Center in Hartford, Connecticut.\n\nFollowing the name change, the use of the WWF \"scratch\" logo became prohibited on all WWE properties. Additionally, past references to the WWF trademark and initials in 'specified circumstances' became censored.[68] Despite the litigation, WWE was still permitted use of the original WWF logo, which was used from 1979 through 1994 and had been explicitly exempted under the 1994 agreement, as well as the similar \"New WWF Generation\" logo, which was used from 1994 through 1998. Furthermore, the company could still make use of the full \"World Wrestling Federation\" and \"World Wrestling Federation Entertainment\" names without consequence. In 2003, WWE won a limited decision to continue marketing certain classic video games from THQ and Jakks Pacific that contained the WWF \"scratch\" logo.[69] However, the packaging on those games had all WWF references replaced with WWE.\n\nStarting with the 1,000th episode of Raw in July 2012, the WWF \"scratch\" logo is no longer censored in archival footage due to WWE reaching a new settlement with the World Wide Fund for Nature.[70] In addition, the WWF initials are no longer censored when spoken or when written in plain text in archival footage. Since then, full-length matches and other segments featuring the WWF initials and \"scratch\" logo have been added to the WWE website and the WWE Classics on Demand service. This also includes WWE Home Video releases since October 2012, starting with the re-release of Brock Lesnar: Here Comes The Pain.[71] In exchange, WWE is no longer permitted to use the WWF initials or logo in any new, original footage, packaging, or advertising, with any old-school logos for retro-themed programming now using the original WWF logo, but modified without the F.[72]\n\nHarry Slash and the Slashstones[]\n\nHarry \"Slash\" Grivas and Roderick Kohn filed a lawsuit against WWE in June 2003 due to the music being used for its programming and DVDs without consent or payment. It also asserted violation of the rights to original music used by ECW that WWE had been using during the Invasion storyline of 2001. The case was resolved on both sides with a settlement that saw WWE purchase the catalogue outright in January 2005.[73]\n\nExpansion beyond wrestling[]\n\nIn addition to licensing wrestling and performers' likenesses to companies such as Acclaim, THQ/2K Sports, and Mattel to produce video games and action figures, WWE has branched out into other areas of interest in order to market their product.\n\nSubsidiaries[]\n\nActive[]\n\nWWE Libraries: a collection of professional wrestling videos and copyrights for other promotions.\n\nWCW Inc.: created in 2001 – owns the rights to the video library and intellectual property for World Championship Wrestling.\n\nWWE Studios: created in 2002 to create and develop feature film properties.

It was closed in 1992.\n\nXFL: folded in 2001, was a partially owned subsidiary of WWF launched in 2000 which comprised eight league-owned professional football teams. The league included television broadcasts on NBC (the other co-owners of the league), UPN, and TNN.\n\nThe World Entertainment: a subsidiary of World Wrestling Federation Entertainment that operated a restaurant, night club, and memorabilia shop in New York City. It opened as \"WWF New York\" in 1999, was renamed as \"The World\", and closed in 2003. Hard Rock Cafe took over the location in 2005.\n\nWWE Kids: a website and comic set aimed at the children's end of the wrestling market, comics were produced bi-monthly. It was launched on April 15, 2008 and discontinued in 2014, the same year WWE Magazine discontinued.\n\nWWE Niagara Falls: a retail and entertainment establishment that was located in Niagara Falls, Ontario and owned by WWE. It was open from August 2002 through March 2011.\n\nCharities[]\n\nWWE has had a partnership with the Make-A-Wish Foundation that spans three decades.[74] Multi-time WWE champion John Cena has granted more wishes than any other celebrity in history, having completed his 500th wish in August 2015.[75]\n\nSince 2012, WWE has partnered with Susan G. Komen for the Cure to raise awareness of breast cancer during the month of October. Their partnership includes offering special charity-related wrestler merchandise, as well as adding a pink color scheme to the sets and ring ropes; 20% of all October purchases of WWE merchandise go to the organization.[76]\n\nIn June 2014, Connor's Cure[77] – a non-profit charitable organization – was established by Triple H and Stephanie McMahon, who have personally funded it through the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh Foundation. It is named in honor of Pittsburgh native Connor Mason Michalek (October 17, 2005 – April 25, 2014) who had died two months earlier from medulloblastoma, a rare tumor that affects the brain and spinal cord. Beginning in 2015, WWE began recognizing September as Pediatric Cancer Awareness Month, adding a gold color scheme to the sets and ring ropes, and offering special Connor's Cure merchandise, with the proceeds going to charity.[78][79]\n\nWWE has sponsored the Special Olympics since 2014.\n\nTapout[]\n\nIn March 2015, WWE announced a partnership with Authentic Brands Group to relaunch Tapout, formerly a major MMA-related clothing line, as a more general \"lifestyle fitness\" brand. The apparel, for men and women, was first released in spring of 2016. WWE markets the brand through various products, including beverages, supplements, and gyms.[80] WWE will hold a 50% stake in the brand, and so will advertise it regularly across all its platforms, hoping to give it one billion impressions a month, and take some of the fitness market from Under Armour. WWE wrestlers and staff have been shown wearing various Tapout gear since the venture began.[81]\n\nRoster[]\n\nApollo Crews\n\nAlexa Bliss\n\nAlicia Fox\n\nBig Cass\n\nBig Show\n\nBo Dallas\n\nBob Backlund\n\nBraun Strowman\n\nBray Wyatt\n\nBrock Lesnar\n\nCurt Hawkins\n\nCurtis Axel\n\nDana Brooke\n\nDarren Young\n\nDash Wilder\n\nDean Ambrose\n\nFinn Bálor\n\nHeath Slater\n\nJason Jordan\n\nJeff Hardy\n\nKurt Angle\n\nKarl Anderson\n\nLuke Gallows\n\nMark Henry\n\nMickie James\n\nNia Jax\n\nPaul Heyman\n\nSamoa Joe\n\nScott Dawson\n\nSeth Rollins\n\nSasha Banks\n\nSummer Rae\n\nTriple H\n\nTitus O'Neil\n\nAiden English\n\nBaron Corbin\n\nBecky Lynch\n\nBig E\n\nBobby Roode\n\nChad Gable\n\nCharlotte Flair\n\nChris Jericho\n\nDolph Ziggler\n\nDaniel Bryan\n\nEpico Colón\n\nErick Rowan\n\nJames Ellsworth\n\nJey Uso\n\nJimmy Uso\n\nJinder Mahal\n\nJohn Cena\n\nKevin Owens\n\nKofi Kingston\n\nLuke Harper\n\nMojo Rawley\n\nMike Kanellis\n\nMaria Kanellis\n\nNikki Bella\n\nPrimo Colón\n\nRandy Orton\n\nSami Zayn\n\nSamir Singh\n\nShelton Benjamin\n\nShinsuke Nakamura\n\nSin Cara\n\nSunil Singh\n\nTye Dillinger\n\nTyler Breeze\n\nXavier Woods\n\nZack Ryder\n\nAleister Black\n\nAlexander Wolfe\n\nAndrade \"Cien\" Almas\n\nAngelo Dawkins\n\nBillie Kay\n\nBuddy Murphy\n\nDrew McIntyre\n\nEric Young\n\nEmber Moon\n\nHideo Itami\n\nJohnny Gargano\n\nKassius Ohno\n\nKillian Dain\n\nLiv Morgan\n\nMandy Rose\n\nNick Miller\n\nNikki Cross\n\nNo Way Jose\n\nOney Lorcan\n\nOtis Dozovic\n\nPaul Ellering\n\nPeyton Royce\n\nRoderick Strong\n\nRuby Riot\n\nSawyer Fulton\n\nShane Thorne\n\nTommaso Ciampa\n\nTucker Knight\n\nWesley Blake\n\nWilliam Regal\n\nAkira Tozawa\n\nAriya Daivari\n\nThe Brian Kendrick\n\nCedric Alexander\n\nDrew Gulak\n\nEnzo Amore\n\nGran Metalik\n\nJack Gallagher\n\nLince Dorado\n\nMustafa Ali\n\nNoam Dar\n\nRich Swann\n\nTony Nese\n\nMark Andrews\n\nPete Dunne\n\nTrent Seven\n\nTyler Bate\n\nChampionships and accomplishments[]\n\nRaw[]\n\nMain article: WWE Raw\n\nChampionship Current champion(s) Reign Date won Days\n\nheld Location Notes WWE Universal Championship Brock Lesnar 1 April 2, 2017 2669+ Orlando, Florida Defeated Goldberg at Wrestlemania 33 WWE Intercontinental Championship The Miz 7 June 4, 2017 2606+ Baltimore, Maryland Defeated Dean Ambrose atExtreme Rules WWE Raw Women's Championship Alexa Bliss 2 August 29, 2017 2520+ Memphis, Tennesee Defeated Sasha Banks on Raw WWE Cruiserweight Championship Enzo Amore 1 September 24, 2017 2494+ Los Angeles, California Defeated Neville at No Mercy WWE Raw Tag Team Championship Dean Ambrose and Seth Rollins 1\n\n(1, 2) August 20, 2017 2529+ Brooklyn, New York Defeated Cesaro and Sheamus at SummerSlam\n\nSmackDown[]\n\nMain article: WWE Smackdown\n\nChampionship Current champion(s) Reign Date won Days\n\nheld Location Notes WWE Championship Jinder Mahal 1 May 21, 2017 2620+ Chicago, Illinois Defeated Randy Orton at Backlash WWE United States Championship AJ Styles 2 July 25, 2017 2555+ Richmond, Virginia Defeated Chris Jericho and previous champion Kevin Owens in a triple threat match on SmackDown Live WWE SmackDown Women's Championship Natalya 1 August 20, 2017 2529+ Brooklyn, New York Defeated Naomi at SummerSlam.
