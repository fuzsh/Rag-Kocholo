        "text": "Liv Tyler has opted out of season two of Fox’s 911: Lone Star.\n\nThe actress, who had a multiple-year deal for the Fox procedural, will not return to the Tim Minear drama amid issues related to the novel coronavirus pandemic. Tyler had previously commuted from London to Los Angeles, where the Austin-set series is filmed.\n\n“What a thrill it was having a movie star of Liv Tyler’s stature to help us launch the first season of 911: Lone Star,” co-creator/showrunner Minear said in a statement. “We loved working with Liv and will be forever indebted to her for her haunting, powerful portrayal of Michelle Blake. While we were able to tell a complete chapter in Michelle’s story, as with Connie Britton on our mothership, we also feel like there are more stories to be told. The door here will always be open for a return.”\n\nTyler’s role, as Minear noted, will not be recast, though producers did not plan for her exit. Instead, Tyler’s absence will be absorbed by new series regular Gina Torres (Suits). The actress, who previously worked with Minear on beloved fan-favorite Firefly, was cast as a series regular in September. She’ll star opposite Rob Lowe and play a paramedic captain who reenters the workplace after her family is impacted by financial issues stemming from the pandemic.\n\nAs filming across the industry gets back underway after the studios and guilds reached new safety protocols for filming, Tyler may be the most high-profile actress to opt out of a series thus far. Tyler, the daughter of Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler, has two young children with her partner in London.\n\nNew episodes of 911: Lone Star are expected to debut in 2021.\n\nDeadline was first to report the news."
