        "text": "Liv Tylers life is interesting on its own. As the daughter of Aerosmith-singer Steven Tyler and model Bebe Buell, she was a public person quite early. She began modeling at the age of 14, but soon focused on acting and is famous for films like “Stealing Beauty”; “Armageddon”, “The Incredible Hulk” or the “Lord of the Rings” trilogy. She didn’t always know that Steven Tyler is her father. Until the age of eight, she thought it was rock musician Todd Rundgren. In 1991 she changed her name into Tyler.\n\nOn Sunday not only the last of the two episodes we did research for is broadcast. It is also the last episode in this season of “Who Do You Think You Are?”. We look forward to see, which stars will explore their family histories in hopefully many seasons to come."
