They remain good friends and devoted parents to their son Milo and are requesting that their family’s privacy be respected at this time,” said the statement released to People.com.\n\nThe rumour-mill went into overdrive earlier this week when Tyler, 30, a star of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, attended at the Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute Gala without wearing her wedding ring.\n\nThe couple wed in a private ceremony at a Caribbean villa in 2003.\n\nLangdon, 36, was a singer with rock band Spacehog when the pair met, and now fronts new group Arckid.\n\nThe musician was born and brought up in Leeds, and Tyler enthusiastically embraced Yorkshire life when the couple married.\n\nLocals were amazed to spot her drinking in the local working men’s club in the suburb of Headingley and shopping in Safeway.\n\nThe daughter of Aerosmith’s Steve Tyler and model Bebe Buell made her name in Bernardo Bertolucci film Stealing Beauty, and went on to star in Armageddon and One Night at McCool’s before landing the role of the elf princess, Arwen, in The Lord of the Rings."
