        "text": "Tuesday\n\nJuly 23, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3623\n\nolympics...are you watching?\n\nBrian Preller sent me an e-mail I thought was worth pondering as the Olympics get to set to begin this Friday in Paris.\n\nIf you've watched NBC or any of its affiliates within the last month, you've seen plenty of promotional commercials for the 2024 Summer Olympic games. They're begging for you to watch.\n\nWill you?\n\nBrian's e-mail: \"Hey Drew, I'm curious what you think about the Olympics in Paris. I'm sure you'll be following the golf portion but what about all the other events? Do any of them stand out? How much do you think you'll watch? I'd be interested to see what other Morning Dish readers think about the Olympics and if they'll be watching. Thanks, Drew.\"\n\nFor some reason, when I was growing up I was always more interested in the winter games than the summer games. I guess it's because the winter games always took (take) place in February and we were usually bundled up and inside during those months, as opposed to the July/August summer games when we have plenty of other activities going on.\n\nMake sense?\n\nI'm still of that mindset, but it's not as if I find the Summer games unenjoyable. I'm quite fond of them.\n\nBut will I watch? That's Brian's question. And that's one NBC would ask, too, since they're selling me (and you) to the advertisers, hoping they draw millions of viewers between July 26 and August 11.\n\nI will definitely watch the swimming. I'm a \"10\" when it comes to watching men's and women's swimming. If I can't see it live I'll make it a point to record it on the DVR.\n\nI'll try and keep with up men's and women's diving as well, but I'm probably more like a \"6\" there.\n\nAnd, of course, I'll be glued into the golf competition once they get that going. The Olympic golf field is loaded with extraordinary talent. It's essentially a major championship from a quality standpoint.\n\nOther than that, I'm not all that interested. Basketball? Eh, not really my thing. I'm sure I'll get caught up in women's soccer, but it won't be appointment viewing for me.\n\nTrack and field doesn't really interest me that much.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I'm fairly certain the Olympics will be on my TV at some point every night, but there's a definite chance it's more white noise than anything else. It just depends on the night and the sport.\n\nAnd we'll be providing some coverage here at #DMD as well. Our own Greg Trehane will follow along and provide updates via both general content and Breakfast Bytes every morning. As the situation warrants, you'll find Olympics commentary here for the next three weeks.\n\nHow about you? What are you interested in watching?\n\nMaybe nothing is as it once was, but I just don't feet the same level of excitement for the Olympics as I did 30 or 40 years ago.\n\nWill you be tuning in?\n\nGolfweek writer Eamon Lynch brought up an interesting topic in the aftermath of so many of golf's top players missing the cut at last week's British Open.\n\nI doubt he penned the headline of the story, but here it is nonetheless: The Open exposes the risk in building golf around superstars who don’t show up\n\nAs is almost always the case with Lynch, he hits a home run with the column.\n\nThe concept is simple. Golf spends a lot of time promoting the young guns and the major champions and they sell the possibilities to NBC, CBS, ESPN, The Golf Channel and others. And then, last weekend, for example, you have a British Open without guys like McIlroy, DeChambeau, Aberg, Hovland, Fleetwood and the ultimate-needle-mover -- yes, still -- Tiger Woods.\n\nNow, Schauffele and Scheffler aren't chopped liver.\n\nAnd the British Open is the British Open, whether someone named Daniel Brown or Thriston Lawrence is vying for the lead or Justin Rose and Shane Lowry are battling it out.\n\nBut unlike almost any other sport, golf is about the characters and the stories that accompany them. And, as Lynch points out in his column, it's a slippery slope when Brown and Lawrence have you scurrying to Wikipedia while McIlroy and DeChambeau are scurrying to the airport on Friday evening.\n\nLynch surmises that in basketball, if you go to a Lakers game to see LeBron, he's almost always going to be the featured attraction and will likely shine on any given night. It's rare you see James scuffle through an 8-point night, in other words.\n\nIn golf, you get tickets for Saturday at the British Open expecting to see Rory and Bryson and then they both flatline over the first two days and they're not on the property when you arrive on Saturday morning.\n\nYou can blame Tiger for some of this, in all fairness.\n\nAt his zenith, Woods almost always delivered. Like, almost always.\n\nHe went from 1997 through 2006 without missing a cut at a major championship. And if he wasn't winning a major in that span, he was likely always hanging around just long enough to keep even \"moderate\" golf fans glued to their TV sets over the weekend.\n\nIf you're a Rory McIlroy devotee, you didn't have a dog in the hunt this weekend. The same if you're a supporter of DeChambeau or Aberg.\n\nThis isn't to say that golf's in a bad spot, particularly if we're on the verge of a juicy Scheff vs. Schauff rivalry for the next few years. Those two might just trade off major after major until the next college hotshot comes along and unseats them.\n\nBut, as Lynch points out in his column, the sport that boasts \"anyone can win, at anytime\" sometimes falls victim to that philosophy when we have weekends like we just saw at Troon, where two guys no one has ever heard of -- like, even golf crazies like me -- are getting airtime on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nWe thought we'd be seeing McIlroy and DeChambeau dueling it out again.\n\nInstead, they were home watching Daniel Brown and Thriston Lawrence like the rest of us.\n\nAnd with no disrespect at all to those two guys...we wanted to see Rory and Bryson.\n\nHeck, the sport of golf needed to see them, even.\n\nAnother silly episode happened last night in Major League Baseball, this time in Kansas City, where Royals star Bobby Witt Jr. was hit by a pitch while he was on the verge of completing the cycle.\n\nPredictably, everyone lost their mind.\n\nAn inning after Witt Jr. was hit by Arizona's Humberto Castellanos, K.C.'s John Schreiber beaned Gabriel Moreno. That's when the benches cleared and adults started acting like 12 year olds who were just told they can't play Valorant because they need to clean up their room first.\n\nBaseball is the weirdest sport there is. What a bunch of nerds.\n\nWitt Jr. needed a single in the 6th inning for the first Royals cycle in 34 years. Castellanos hit him with the first pitch, drawing loud boos from the crowd and forcing K.C. catcher Salvador Perez to get involved, as he rose to the top step of the dugout and gave the Arizona pitcher an earful.\n\n\"I don't like the way it looks, honest to you guys,\" Perez told reporters after K.C.'s 10-4 win. \"Three-for-three, trying to get a hit for the cycle.\"\n\nI had no idea whatsoever that Major League Baseball players -- you know, so called \"professionals\" -- were that in tune with who is hitting for a cycle and what impact it has on their legacy.\n\nMaybe I'm wrong. But is Castellanos really getting ribbed by the guys at the hotel this morning if he gives up a single to Witt Jr. in the 6th inning of a game in late July?\n\nBut worse than Castellanos hitting him and worse than Perez getting riled up about it is what happened in the next inning, when the Royals then hit Moreno with a pitch. The benches emptied on that one, of course, and Arizona's manager was ejected after getting into it with Perez near home plate.\n\nThere is very little doubt that Schreiber intentionally hit Moreno.\n\n#clownshoes stuff\n\nIt all unfolded as a result of the Royals assuming Witt Jr. was hit on purpose because he needed a single for the cycle.\n\nFor what it's worth, here's what Arizona's manager said about that situation. And don't look now, but it makes sense to me.\n\n\"If you think in your right mind that I was going to ask our team to hit the future of Major League Baseball, one of the best players in Major League Baseball, you're crazy,\" Torey Lovullo said.\n\nWe saw this in high definition here in Baltimore recently, and in New York earlier this year, where both the Yankees and O's routinely hit opposing batters and everyone just assumed each occasion was intentional.\n\nAnd because of that assumption, that means baseball's secret code has to get invoked. And then an inning or three later, someone is hit intentionally. It's a comedy routine.\n\nThe Orioles and Yankees have embarrassed themselves time and time again this year with these silly beanball episodes. But last night's display in Kansas City was the cake topper.\n\nWho cares if someone hits for the cycle? I mean, is that really an accomplishment that warrants hitting a dude?\n\nHere's a thought: Don't let him hit a triple. Or a double. Or a home run. Take care of that and he won't need a single.\n\nThe summary is this: Not every pitch that hits a batter is intentionally thrown at said batter. But baseball players seem to think that's the way it works.\n\nIt's a bad look for a great sport.\n\nMonday\n\nJuly 22, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3622\n\nit's the summer of schauffele\n\nIt only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades, I know, but, man, someone was pretty darn close to a single season grand slam in the world of professional golf.\n\nHis name is Xander Schauffele.\n\nHe entered the 2024 season without a major victory and there was doubt from those in the golf world about his ability to close.\n\nThose doubts have now been erased. Gone. As in, totally erased.\n\nSchauffele captured his second major of the season yesterday at Royal Troon with a stirring back nine finish that earned him the coveted Claret Jug, symbolic, as the Brits say, of \"the champion golfer of the year\".\n\nAnd with any luck at all he could have made golfing history this year.\n\nSchauffele entered the Masters as one of the pre tournament favorites but didn't have his best stuff there, settling for an 8th place finish after rounds of 72-72-70-73. Still, a top 10 finish at the first major of the year is nothing to sneeze at.\n\nHe then won the PGA Championship in May, completing the victory with a nifty up-and-down at the par 5 closing hole to nip Bryson DeChambeau by a shot for his first major title. That \"best player without a major\" label was now on someone else's back, finally.\n\nAt Pinehurst in June, he piddled his way around the course for the first three days, always in the distance but never threatening the leaders. He completed 72 holes there at 1-under par for a T7 finish (70-69-72-68).\n\nAnd then, yesterday, he did something only 7 other players have done since 1994. He won two majors in the same season. It's a career achievement to win one major, period. It's really extraordinary to win two in the same year.\n\n\"X\" joined some lofty company yesterday: Nick Price (1994), Mark O'Meara (1998), Tiger Woods (4 times, 2000, 2002, 2005, 2006), Padraig Harrington (2008), Rory McIlroy (2014), Jordan Spieth (2015) and Brooks Koepka (2018). Those are the other 7. That Tiger did it four times is unreal, but then again, that's how you pile up 15 majors in your career.\n\nYesterday's final round 65 will be remembered for a long time. Schauffele was always in the background throughout the first 54 holes, but some steady play during Saturday's difficult round moved him to 3-under par and gave him a puncher's chance heading into the final day.\n\nHe didn't do much on the front nine yesterday, either, but everyone else on the leaderboard was keeping him in the game with the occasional bogey on the difficult Royal Troon layout.\n\nThe back nine was something special. He made 4 birdies coming in and shoulda, coulda, woulda birdied 17 and 18, but birdie putts on those two holes just missed going in.\n\nSchauffele's final round 65 also earned him a distinction that not even Tiger Woods can lay claim to. Only one other player, ever, shot 65 in the final round of two major championship victories; Jack Nicklaus did it to win the 1967 U.S. Open and the 1986 Masters. Schauffele did it in the same year, 2024. That's a pretty cool stat to tell your grandkids someday.\n\nJustin Rose and Billy Horschel finished 2nd yesterday at 7-under par. Both players fought gamely but simply couldn't match Schauffele's putting over the course of the final round. Horschel's flat stick heated up on the final three holes when he finished with a trio of birdies, but the event got away from the third round leader at the turn and he was never able to get back in it.\n\nRose, the 2013 U.S. Open champion, won't have many more opportunities to win the Claret Jug. Now at age 42, he was the crowd favorite once Shane Lowry imploded on Saturday, but Rose's putter wasn't cooperative enough on Sunday.\n\nThe tied for second place finish, though, continues an impressive streak for the (vastly) underrated Englishman: He has finished in the top 10 of a major in 11 of the last 13 years and has two top 10 finishes in the same year on 5 occasions since 2012.\n\nThe \"other biggest story\" on Sunday -- and really, throughout the weekend -- was the putting disaster authored by Scottie Scheffler. He, once again, was the tournament leader in shots gained (approach) and finished in the Top 20 in virtually every other ball striking category.\n\nBut he once again putted worse than Jose Feliciano, finishing next to last among those who made the cut.\n\nA stat nerd posted this on Twitter last night and it's an amazing revelation about Scottie's 2024 season. If he would have putted as well as the 32nd ranked player (putting wise) at the U.S. Open and the 29th ranked player at Troon, he would have won both events by two shots.\n\nInstead he ranked almost dead last (70th or so) at both events and failed to win.\n\nSchauffele's victory on Sunday now creates quite a race for the PGA Tour's Player of the Year award.\n\nYou have Scheffler with a Masters win and five other victories, so far, and all five of them were \"Signature Events\" that featured the biggest purses and best fields on the PGA Tour.\n\nBut you have Schauffele with two majors, four top 10's in majors, and a pair of closing 65's to win the PGA and British Open.\n\nThe good news? There's more golf on the horizon to help settle the dispute. First, there's the Olympics in Paris, where Scheffler and Schauffele are expected to contend for the gold medal. And then there's the FedEx Cup, which starts in a few weeks.\n\nIf the Orioles somehow squander the A.L. East later this year and lose the division by one game, they have Andrew Heaney of the Texas Rangers to thank.\n\nHeaney, who pretty much stinks this season, made it 2-for-2 against the O's in 2024, allowing just 2 hits in five innings and picking up the win in Sunday's series finale, a 3-2 Rangers victory.\n\nIt's hard to explain.\n\nOn Saturday, the O's bashed future Hall of Famer Max Scherzer like he was Sidney Ponson. On Sunday, they made Heaney look like Clayton Kershaw. Again.\n\nHeaney, you might remember, baffled the Birds in Baltimore a month ago during that 11-2 Sunday night national TV embarrassment.\n\nAs Gene Hackman said repeatedly in the final scene of the great movie, \"The Birdcage\": I don't understand.\n\nHow can a guy be so bad against everyone else and so good against a formidable lineup like the O's in 2024? Now, granted, the bottom four guys in yesterday's lineup (Hays, Cowser, Mateo, McCann) aren't going to the \"Hall of Good\" anytime soon, but, still. Heaney was again able to squelch the best hitters and help Texas avoid a sweep at the hands of the A.L. East leaders.\n\nBaseball, man. It's weird.\n\nAnd now it's off to Miami for what should be a 3-game romp over the dilapidated Marlins. And then Manny and the Padres are in town this weekend for a 3-game series.\n\nOne loss in Arlington isn't worth fretting over, but that Heaney dude has some serious magic when it comes to facing the Birds.\n\n5 out of 6 wins against Miami and San Diego will have us all forgetting about another Sunday loss to an otherwise mediocre southpaw.\n\nJohn Harbaugh got it going right out of the gate yesterday when he quickly defended Lamar Jackson for his inability to take the Ravens to the Super Bowl last January.\n\nHarbaugh's protection of Lamar is interesting. And smart. He knows, of course, what we all know. His team's success is predicated almost entirely on what Jackson does at the quarterback position.\n\n\"The vision that we have together is that Lamar Jackson is going to become and be known and be recognized as the greatest quarterback ever to play in the history of the National Football League,\" Harbaugh told reporters on Sunday. \"It's going to happen by Lamar, his work ethic and his brilliant talent, by all of us pouring into that effort together as a team and by the grace of God and God's goodwill.\"\n\nHarbaugh was answering a question about the team's frustration that Jackson hasn't yet led the team to a Super Bowl.\n\n\"There's a lot of great things said about Lamar, but there's a lot of stuff that's said that you just got to scratch your head about and kind of wonder, 'What's that person even thinking?'\" Harbaugh stated. \"But we take it personally.\"\n\nThis, of course, is going to be the team's template throughout the 2024 season. Lamar plays great and nothing's said. Lamar plays poorly and Harbaugh and others will have to quickly rise to the quarterback's defense.\n\nIt's puzzling to see how many people out there want Jackson to fail. Harbaugh, among others, seems intent on not letting that happen.\n\n\"All his life, Lamar Jackson has been a guy who's been answering those same questions,\" Harbaugh said. \"I'm talking about since he was a kid. Junior high, high school, college, the draft. The success he's had in the league, again, it still comes up. He's going to get better and better, no doubt. But what does he have to do to prove himself to some people? Right?\"\n\nOne thing we all know. It's not going away. Not until Jackson takes the Ravens to a Super Bowl. Once that happens, the questions will change, of course, but Lamar has to take Harbaugh and the Ravens to a Super Bowl before the narrative around him will loosen.\n\nSunday\n\nJuly 21, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3621\n\nthanks for the help...and visit\n\nI've written today's entry, generally, every year on July 21 since #DMD started publishing on August 25, 2014.\n\nThose who have read it before and believe in it will hopefully read today's entry, smile, and remember there is a power in heaven above that exists and occasionally reaches out to us.\n\nIf you've read this story before or read it today and don't believe in it, that's certainly your right to do so. I never judge a non-believer. All I can do is hope that someday you have an experience that leads you to believe.\n\nBefore that, though, let's get on with the sports stuff.\n\nThe O's won last night in another laugher in Arlington, Texas. This time it was 8-4. The Rangers are pretty much a shell of the team that won the World Series last October. Same club. Mostly the same players. But they don't have it this year.\n\nWe'll get back to the Birds later.\n\nThe 2004 British Open at Royal Troon was won by an obscure American golfer named Todd Hamilton.\n\nThe 1997 British Open was won by an American golfer with a reasonable pedigree named Justin Leonard. Much was expected of him coming out of college and Leonard eventually delivered with that '97 victory at Royal Troon.\n\nIf you mixed those two players together, you'd have someone very similar to Billy Horschel. And it's Horschel who has a one-shot lead after 54 holes of this year's British Open.\n\nHorschel is far more well known than was Hamilton when he won in 2004.\n\nBut very few people (outside of #DMD, who had him in our Top 10 contenders) thought much of Horschel's chances at this year's fourth and final major of the year.\n\nLeonard was a guy a lot of people thought was going to be the next American-golfer-fair-haired-boy when he came out of the University of Texas and joined the PGA Tour. Horschel was similarily thought of coming out of the University of Florida.\n\nA lot of golf enthusiasts thought Leonard had the game to win 3 or 4 majors. He wound up with just that one in 1997. Folks figured Billy Horschel would be a multiple-major winner as well. And he still might.\n\nBut today at Troon, Horschel has the opportunity to do the same thing Leonard did in 1997. He can win the British Open for his first major title.\n\nIt won't be easy.\n\nFor starters, it's a major championship and Horschel's record in those isn't stellar, to say the least.\n\n\"I've waited my whole life to be in a position like this,\" Horschel said after his 3rd round 69 left him at 4-under par.\n\n\"There was a time when I just wanted to play on the Tour. Then I wanted to play in all of the majors. Now, I want to win one. I want to win more than one, but I have to win one first. I've been dreaming of this for a long time. Now I'm in position to do it.\"\n\nOthers behind him like Schauffele (-3), Rose (-3) and Scheffler (-2) have a much better history at majors. Horschel has 8 wins in his entire career. Scheffler has 6 wins since this February.\n\nTroon showed her teeth on Saturday and will likely do the same again today, when winds are expected to blow in the 20's throughout the final round.\n\nSecond round leader Shane Lowry rolled up to the 120 yard par-3 8th hole with a 1 shot lead on Daniel Brown. 20 minutes later, Lowry carded a \"5\", Brown scored a bogey 4, and the game was on once again. Lowry stumbled throughout the rainy third round to an ugly 77 that leaves him three shots off the pace heading into today's final round.\n\nHe growled and threw out a few uncomplimentary words for the folks involved with the course set-up in his post-round meeting with the media.\n\n\"Totally brutal out there today,\" the 2019 British Open champ said. \"I thought they could have done with moving a few tees up on the back nine so we didn't have to hit woods into par 4 holes but I guess they didn't think it through like that. It was really hard to make a par coming in.\"\n\nThe front nine played easier, for sure, but the par 3, 8th hole continued to be incredibly challenging for the best players in the world.\n\nIn the first three rounds, it was played at 108, 114 and 120 yards. The green is roughly the size of three pitcher's mounds. The menacing bunkers that surround the putting surface shield the player from seeing much of the green when he stands on the tee.\n\nThey say #17 at TPC Sawgrass and #12 at Augusta National are two of the toughest par 3 holes in the world. But, in fairness, you can at least see the green from the teeing area.\n\nYou can only see roughly 25% of the green at #8 at Troon, aptly called \"Postage Stamp\". It might be the hardest par 3 in the world and most players in the field could throw their golf ball the distance of the hole.\n\nThe weather and wind created some troubling situations on Saturday, namely the 15th and 18th holes. Scottie Scheffler hit driver, 3-iron on the 453 yard closing hole. Under normal circumstances, the #1 player in the world would hit driver, 9-iron on that hole.\n\nOnly 21% of the players in the field hit the par-4 15th hole in regulation due to a blustery wind in their face. Scheffler hit driver, 3-wood and still came up 10 yards short of the putting surface.\n\nMore of the same is expected today.\n\nThe guy with the best short game will come out on top.\n\nWill it be Horschel, finally?\n\nCould it be little known South African Thriston Lawrence (-3), who finished four hours before Lowry concluded his third round on Saturday and finds himself in the final group with Horschel later today.\n\nIf anyone knows how to handle rugged British weather, it's veteran Justin Rose. The 2013 U.S. Open champion has a chance to add a Claret Jug to his trophy case today. A win for Rose would be popular, indeed.\n\nSchauffele? Scheffler? Both of them are poised to make a Sunday move. Schauffele won the PGA Championship in May and Scheffler captured the Masters in April. A win for either of them today would likely sew up Player of the Year honors on the PGA Tour.\n\nLittle known Daniel Brown is still hanging around at 3-under as well. Brown wasn't even exempt into the 2024 British Open. He had to qualify for the tournament just like the rest of the great unwashed. A win for him today would be a golfing triumph for the ages.\n\nOne thing for sure: No matter who wins today, it will be well earned. Hard earned and very well earned.\n\nThere are so many rumored baseball deals swirling that one doesn't know who to believe at this point. But if the O's are indeed in the running to land Garrett Crochet and Luis Robert Jr. from the White Sox, they're going to have to ship at least four quality players to the Windy City, if not more.\n\nThat the Dodgers, Yankees and Mariners are also apparently interested in those two probably only serves to jack up the asking price from the Birds.\n\nWould Mike Elias really part company with the likes of Mayo, Cowser, Norby, Stowers, Kjerstad, Basallo (a combination of those, obviously) and others to land the White Sox talented pitcher and outfielder?\n\nThe official guess here is \"no\".\n\nThat said, a Crochet-Robert deal would be a massive coup for the O's and their quest to reach the World Series.\n\nAnd we'll keep going back to what we've been saying here for the last four weeks or so. If Elias pulls the trigger on a \"big boy trade\", that just proves he was paying attention last year when he sat down at the $5 table and soft-peddled two (very) marginal contributors in Fuji and Flaherty.\n\nIf you're going to go all in, go all in. If you're not going to go in, just go with what you have and hope it works out.\n\nI'm all for whatever Elias decides to do. That said, results are what matter most. Fuji and Flaherty, last summer's windfall, were huge whiffs. That I think Elias should be trusted is only as good as the next deal or deals he makes.\n\nThere was some internet chatter from Arlington on Saturday that indicated the O's might be interested in Max Scherzer. I'm the biggest Max Scherzer fan there is, but I'd be looking for younger and more upside if I'm the Birds.\n\nOn the field, last night's 8-4 win over the Rangers coupled with the Yankees and Red Sox both losing bumped the Birds up another game in the A.L. East.\n\nThe beer is still colder. And getting colder.\n\nI've told this life story here every year on July 21 and today's entry is even more spine tingling and \"better\" than any other year I can remember.\n\nMy mom passed away on this date in 1987. She died of cancer. I was 24 years old.\n\nI won't go into all of the details of my childhood because I'd wind up writing 50,000 words about her, but she was active in every sport I played and was one of those \"team moms\" that we recall from our youth.\n\nMy mom loved sports. She was the biggest Baltimore Colts fan ever and listened to every O's game religiously. So what happened yesterday should come as no real surprise.\n\nBut let me digress to tell you about what happened, again, last night.\n\nMy mom passed away just before 2:00 am on July 21, 1987. I think her official death certificate says 1:59 am but I remember a friend/nurse (my mom worked at North Arundel Hospital in Glen Burnie which is where she also passed away) once telling me she actually died at 1:57. Small stuff, anyway.\n\nEvery year since then, on July 21, I wake up within minutes of 2:00 am. Every. Single. Year.\n\nThis morning, it was 2:01 am.\n\nOther years it's been 1:58, 2:02, 1:59, 2:03, 1:57, etc. It's always right around 2:00 am. And there's never a reason for it. Like a lot of older men, I usually make one bathroom stop in the middle of the night at some point. But this morning, I woke up at 2:01 am and didn't need to use the bathroom.\n\nI was in a deep sleep and suddenly, I just woke up.\n\nI looked over at the clock on my phone.\n\n2:01 am.\n\nI sat up on the edge of the bed for a minute to gather myself.\n\nIt had happened again.\n\nMy mom just reminding me, softly, that she is still here and still watching over me.\n\nBut this year's story gets better.\n\nMy 16 year old son has been taking golf seriously for about two years now. He played his first official tournament in June of 2023, shooting a 98 at the Maryland Junior Amateur at Prospect Bay GC on the Eastern Shore.\n\nOver the last 14 months or so, his progress has gone up and down, just like it does with everyone who takes up golf. A 104 would be followed by a 95. A 93 would then bring about a 101. You know how it goes.\n\nA month or so ago, he shot an 81. The best round of his life. He strolled to the course a day or two later expecting to shoot 71.\n\nI warned him how golf works. He didn't listen. His score of 92 that day left him deflated.\n\nBut he has made significant golfing progress over the last year or so. And I knew there was something special for him on the horizon.\n\nYesterday at Eagle's Nest, we went out for a Saturday afternoon round with a junior golfer friend.\n\nMy son's start was less than stellar. He was 6 over through 6 holes.\n\nBut there was something about him that I noticed. There were no moans about bad breaks (he had a couple) or missed putts from within 10 feet (he had a couple). He just walked along, casually, smiling in his bucket hat and enjoying the day.\n\nHe made birdie at #7, then hit the par 5 9th green in two, basically, and 2-putted from the fringe for another birdie. He played the front in 40, a good score for him.\n\nA few months back when we went Pinehurst for the Tuesday practice round of the U.S. Open, my son, Ethan, got to watch his favorite player, Min Woo Lee, play a couple of holes on the front nine.\n\n\"Dad,\" he said, \"You know how you got to play with one of your idols, Bernhard Langer, at the U.S. Senior Open? I'm going to play with Min Woo Lee someday at the U.S. Open.\"\n\n\"You probably should break 80 first before you start worrying about the U.S. Open,\" I said with a smile and a loving pat on the head.\n\nEthan started the back nine yesterday with pars at #10, #11 and #12. He then went bogey-bogey at #13 and #14. As we walked to the 15th tee, he made the mistake a lot of golfers make when they're trying to break 100, 90, 80 or 70 for the first time. He talked about it.\n\n\"I'm 6 over with four holes left,\" he said. \"I can break 80 today.\"\n\n\"Just worry about this tee shot,\" I shot back. \"This is the only thing you should be focused on.\"\n\nIt was at that moment, though, that I felt a calmness about him that was strange. He took out his 3 wood, quickly lined up his shot, and hit a great drive down the middle on what is, by far, the hardest driving hole on the course.\n\nHe then hit a wonderful 6-iron to 75 yards short of the green. I didn't coach him to hit 6-iron. He surveyed everything in front of him, pulled the club, and struck it perfectly. A wedge and two putts later and he was 6 over with three to play.\n\nWe walked up to the 16th green.\n\nFor reasons I don't know, I started to get ahead of myself, thinking about the date and wondering how we would commemmorate this occasion if Ethan did, in fact, break 80.\n\nJuly 20.\n\nMy mom passed away on July 21.\n\nIt all made sense.\n\nAs we put our bags down on the tee, I quietly spoke to my mom.\n\n\"I have no idea if you're involved in this today,\" I said. \"But it's definitely coming out of nowhere. So I have to assume this is of your doing. If you're the one guiding him along through this round, it would mean a lot to me to be with him the first time he breaks 80 in a real round of golf.\"\n\nThere was a gentle breeze in our face on the 16th tee. It was calm. I didn't say a word to Ethan. But I knew he knew what was going on. He needed to play the last three holes in no more than one over par.\n\nHe lofted a perfectly struck pitching wedge to the front of the green and left himself with 15 feet for birdie. The ensuing putt stopped agonizingly within inches of the hole. He was disappointed he didn't make birdie while I was thrilled he simply two putted and still had a chance at glory.\n\nPredictably, with things starting to get tight, he hit a poor drive at #17. His next shot from the left trees didn't reach the green but he chipped up nicely from there to 15 feet.\n\nHe was on his own at this point. I wasn't coaching him and I wasn't really talking about golf with him. I shifted the conversation to his other favorite topic as we put our bags down and walked to the green: food.\n\n\"Man, I'm starving,\" I said.\n\n\"Me too,\" he countered. \"I can't wait to get something to eat. One more hole.\"\n\nI surveyed his 15 footer. This, I said to myself, could easily be three putted given the location of the pin.\n\nHe left the first putt short. He had four feet left for bogey.\n\nI walked to the side of the green and watched.\n\n\"Mom, if you're still here and you're still handling this, help him go through his routine and preparation for this putt,\" I said.\n\nHe took his time, read the putt from both sides, and with a calmness unlike anything I've seen from him before, gently rolled it for a bogey five.\n\n\"Come on!\" Ethan said out loud. \"A par at 18 and I break 80 for the first time.\"\n\nNow that, I know, is the cardinal mistake in golf. You simply don't say those things out loud, let alone think them in the privacy of your own head.\n\nBut it was out in the open now. He needed to par the last hole to reach one of golf's scoring milestones.\n\n\"Mom, just guide him along here,\" I said. \"He's got this, but you have to help him. Keep him calm, please.\"\n\nWith no direction from me, he eschewed his driver and hit 3-wood off the 365 yard closing hole, which rises dramatically uphill over the last 100 yards.\n\nHe whistled it down the left hand side. Neither of us were sure exactly where it was, but I knew from the ball flight it wasn't going to be in the fairway. As we reached the fairway, I saw his ball, in the rough, some 90 yards from the green.\n\nI knew, though, the quest was far from over. Ethan isn't great with uneven lies, as most young, inexperienced golfers tend not to be.\n\nHis second shot wasn't struck poorly, but he didn't allow for enough of the uphill angle and the ball settled in the rough, some 10 yards short of the green.\n\nIn past golfing experiences, like last week, maybe, Ethan would have reacted with disappointment to that poor shot.\n\nI watched him carefully this time.\n\nThere was nothing. No reaction. Nothing. He just put his bag on his shoulder and walked on.\n\n\"You've got him, mom,\" I said as I watched him stroll up the hill. \"This is all on you. I don't need to help him. You've got him.\"\n\nHe hit his pitch shot from short of the green almost perfectly. The ball landed some 20 feet from the cup and rolled out nicely. For a brief second, I thought it might wind up within a foot and virtually assure him of that 79 he was craving.\n\nInstead, he was left with a 3-footer.\n\nOn any other Saturday, if we were just out there goofing around, I probably would have knocked that putt back to him and said, \"Let's get out of here and eat.\"\n\nBut not this time. There was no way I was conceding that putt to him. I thought for a brief moment about acting as if I would knock it back to him just to hear him say, \"No, no, I want to putt that!\"\n\nThis was the moment he had wanted all along.\n\nI knew he knew what was going on.\n\nI was definitely more nervous than he was.\n\n\"One more putt, mom,\" I said. I was pretty much pleading with her at this point.\n\nI couldn't let the moment go by without the one concrete piece of putting advice I always give him.\n\n\"Just keep your head down and make solid contact with the ball,\" I said as I looked at the putt.\n\nThe putt went in dead-center.\n\nI reacted like a proud dad who had just seen his son reach an athletic achievement he so badly wanted and Ethan put his hands on his head and smiled.\n\nWe hugged and I told him I was proud of him and our junior friend playing with us congratulated him as well.\n\nEthan put his putter in his bag and stopped to look around, surveying the green and taking in the moment.\n\nMaybe he felt something \"different\" on those closing holes, maybe he didn't.\n\nCelebrating with a root beer and chicken wings afterwards, I asked him if he was nervous on the final few holes.\n\n\"Honestly?, \"he said. \"Not really. I don't know why, though. I just kept playing and figured it was all going to work out in the end.\"\n\nI know why he wasn't nervous.\n\nThank you, mom. You gave your son and a dad one of the greatest gifts he could get on that 18th green.\n\nSaturday\n\nJuly 20, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3620\n\ntoday should be......fun?\n\nIf the weather that's predicted to reach Scotland on Saturday does, in fact, find its way there, the British Open is going to look like...well...the British Open.\n\nRain, gusts of wind near 30 MPH, and a day of golfing-survival are in the offing for those fortunate to make the 36-hole cut and play on Royal Troon this weekend.\n\nSunday is calling for no rain, but winds in the 20's and 30's, still. In other words, a \"proper Scottish day\" as they say over there.\n\nToday, though, might be an afternoon for the ages. There's no telling what a good score might be today: 72? 74? Who knows what havoc the weather will create in the third round.\n\nThen again, the weather could make an abrupt shift over there as it often does and scoring could be easier, which would open up a number of possibilities.\n\nShane Lowry, an Irishman who won the Open Championship at Royal Portrush five years ago, is atop the leaderboard at 7 under par through 36 holes. Two other guys who know a thing or two about wind and rain are at 5-under par and two shots back; Justin Rose and Daniel Brown, both of England.\n\nScottie Scheffler is right there in the mix at 2-under with identical rounds of 70-70 to start the year's final major.\n\nTV analyst Paul McGinley summed up Scheffler perfectly on Friday evening as the winds started to perk up at Troon: \"He's just like a thoroughbred racehorse. He paces himself. He knows the only thing that matters is who crosses the finish line first. He'll pick away at the course here and there, make birdies when he can, and do his best to not make any big numbers. He's still the guy to beat in this championship.\"\n\nScheffler has another American with him at 2-under, Billy Horschel. Those two share joint 4th place with South African Dean Burmester.\n\nOther Americans hanging around include Xander Schauffele and Patrick Cantlay (both at -1), along with Dustin Johnson and Colin Morikawa (+1).\n\nGiven the expected weather over the weekend, it's realistic to give anyone who made the cut (6 over par) a chance to win the Claret Jug. Sure, Max Homa (who made a 40-foot putt on #18 on Friday to make the cut on the number) probably has less of a chance than, say, than the guys at +2 like Tom Hoge, Gary Woodland and a #DMD pick, Matthieu Pavon.\n\nBut anyone who made the cut is still alive, particularly if those near the back of the leaderboard can somehow piece together an (unexpected) round in the 60's on Saturday.\n\nThe list of those who missed the cut at Troon is far more impressive than the list of guys who are actually playing all four rounds.\n\nWill Zalatoris, Bryson DeChambeau, Tommy Fleetwood, Ludvig Aberg, Viktor Hovland, Tony Finau, Rory McIlroy and Tiger Woods are all heading home after 36 holes.\n\nMcIlroy was listless on Thursday and Friday, shooting 78 and 75 to earn his early trip home.\n\nFinau was in great shape after an opening round 71, then blew up with an 81 on Friday. For all the hype surrounding Finau, he's starting to cement his reputation as a guy who can't get it done under the pressure of major championship golf.\n\nTiger's play on Friday (77) was a smidgen better than Thursday, but only because he was able to hole a few more putts. Off the tee he was wildly ineffective. Woods played in all four majors this year and missed the cut in the last three of them. He did make the cut and play all four days at Augusta back in April, but that didn't do anything for the rest of his golf in 2024.\n\nThere were two surprising departures on Friday, but not because of their golf, per se.\n\nJohn Daly and Ernie Els -- both of whom won the Claret Jug in their careers -- shot 82 on Thursday and promptly withdrew from this year's event prior to starting round two on Friday.\n\nThat Daly quit isn't a surprise. That Els would quit is a bit of shock to the system, though. Not cool.\n\nLet's get back to the good players who didn't quit.\n\nLowry is known as a solid front runner. Whether he can hold on for two more days remains to be seen, but this year's Open is looking a little like last year's, when Brian Harman led by 5 shots after both day and day three and waltzed to a remarkably easy 5-shot victory for his first major title.\n\nIf Lowry can shoot something around par again today, you'd think he'd a 54 hole lead heading into Sunday's final round.\n\nBut there's a lot of golf to play and some nasty weather on the horizon. Anything is still possible.\n\nA trio of LIV golfers (Dustin Johnson, Jon Rahm and Brooks Koepka) are situated nicely at 1-over par. All three of those guys have major championships. None, though, have won the British Open. A win for any of those three would give them the \"3 quarters grand slam\".\n\nJohnson would only have to win the PGA to capture all four majors.\n\nRahm, too, would only have to capture the PGA.\n\nAnd Koepka would need to win at the Masters to win all four of golf's majors.\n\nAny of those three could win this weekend and it wouldn't be a shock at all.\n\nLet the weather roll in and let's see who survives.\n\nThe Orioles got off to a nice second half start last night with a 9-1 thrashing of the Rangers in Arlington, Texas.\n\nAnthony Santander hit two homers for O's and Adley Rutschman and Colton Cowser both homered as well. Gunnar Henderson didn't homer but he did have four hits, much to the chagrin of any of us (err, I mean, \"you\") who had a 3-way homer wager of Henderson, Rutschman and Santander.\n\nThanks for nuthin', Gunnar.\n\nCorbin Burnes picked up the win and, other than walking four batters, was his usual sharp self. That dude is a terrific pitcher. Let's just hope it's a National League team that lands him this off-season and not the Yankees or Red Sox.\n\nOh, and speaking of \"landing somewhere\", it's going to be interesting to see what kind of free agent deal Anthony Santander can cook up this winter. The All Star right fielder now has 26 homers and 63 RBI on the season, heading briskly in the direction of a 40 homer campaign that should make him very, very wealthy in 2025 and beyond.\n\nThe most-discussed O's deal this past week was the pursuit of Tigers pitcher Tarik Skubal, who will fetch Detroit a mighty sum if industry experts who predict these things are accurate about what Skubal might be worth to a contending team.\n\nThat the O's are likely going to lose Corbin Burnes could make the Skubal deal even that much more attractive to Mike Elias. Skubal would join Grayson Rodriguez at the top of the O's rotation next season and give them one of the best best 1-2 combos in all of baseball.\n\nBut what would it take to get him? Jackson Holliday? Would he have to be in the deal?\n\nWhat about some combination of Cowser, Westburg, Mayo, Norby, Stowers, Povich, McDermott?\n\nWait, here's one: Detroit gets Urias, Mullins, Mateo and Dillon Tate. The O's get Tarik Skubal.\n\nI'm kidding.\n\nWell, not about getting Skubal. I think that's something the Birds should pursue. Urias, Mullins, Mateo and Tate might not even get you Nathan Eovaldi from Texas, the starter the O's clobbered last night in Arlington.\n\nThe oddest dilemma about a deal that would involve Jackson Holliday is that you'd potentially be shipping off a player who is totally unproven at the Major League level (Holliday) for a proven, sturdy, and very promising starting pitcher (Skubal).\n\nBut, Jackson Holliday might be Gunnar Henderson in 18 months. Who knows?\n\nThis is why Mike Elias makes the big bucks. He has to play the game with the Tigers (and all other teams) and figure out what his best course of action is with Skubal, who most certainly would enhance the chances that Baltimore sometime very soon finally gets to watch a World Series in person for the first time since 1983.\n\nFriday\n\nJuly 19, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3619\n\nfriday stuff\n\nOK, so Michael Phelps is the #1 athlete of the last 25 years and Tiger Woods shot 79 in round one of the British Open yesterday and isn't going to make the cut at Troon.\n\nNeither of those can be surprising.\n\nPhelps is the most decorated Olympic athlete of our lifetime with 28 total medals and 23 gold medals in his incredible career. When ESPN.com started circulating the Top 100 list earlier this week, everyone assumed Phelps would be a contender for the top spot and a slam dunk Top 5 finisher at the very least.\n\nHe wound up #1 when the list was finalized and published on Thursday.\n\nGiving in to pressure they've somehow managed to help create, ESPN.com went with Serena Williams at #2 rather than at #6 or #7 where she rightfully belongs.\n\nLionel Messi came in at #3, another attempt by ESPN.com to show how \"worldly\" they are, even though LeBron (#4) and Tom Brady (#5) are far more accomplished.\n\nRounding out the Top 10 were Federer (#6), Simone Biles (#7), Tiger Woods (#8), Usain Bolt (#9) and Kobe Bryant (#10).\n\nThe Top 5 were fine, even though Serena was misplaced.\n\nThe \"next 5\" were incredibly out of whack. But that's probably what ESPN.com wanted in the first place. All by design, in other words.\n\n\"What should we do with Simone Biles?\" Bill asked.\n\n\"I don't know, we have enough basketball players in the Top 25, don't we?\" replied Dave.\n\n\"Uh, she's a gymnast,\" said Bill.\n\n\"My bad,\" Dave countered. \"I remember her now. She's the one that quit gymnastics a few years ago.\"\n\n\"Let's put her at #7, ahead of people like Tiger, Kobe and Novak Djokovic. That will really get the readers going,\" Bill reasoned.\n\n\"That's why we're doing this in the first place, right? I love it. Put Biles at #7 then,\" Dave stated.\n\nYou can debate Phelps, Brady and LeBron and put them in any order and I'd probably not argue with you. I see the merits of all three.\n\nComing up next week at ESPN.com: The Top 100 who didn't make The Top 100 list.\n\nDon't worry, we already know Lamar Jackson is #1 on that list.\n\nAs for Tiger and his play at Troon yesterday (and today, he's halfway through his 2nd round as #DMD publishes), I can't imagine there's anyone at all who was (is) surprised by it, Woods included.\n\n\"I just need to play tournaments,\" Tiger said yesterday after his 8-over-par 79.\n\n\"In some ways I've made a lot of progress this year, even though my results don't show it. But I need to play more events next year so I'm sharper in the majors.\"\n\nThat issue -- as I've written here time and time again over the last four years -- is the primary reason why Woods is no longer competitive in professional golf.\n\nHe's no longer a great putter, either. That's the other reason. But more on that in a minute.\n\nTiger has been trying to catch lightning in a bottle ever since the car accident in 2021 that nearly took his life. He's no longer physically able to play a busy schedule, instead opting to \"ramp up\" his game in advance of the Masters, PGA, U.S. Open and British Open tournaments.\n\nThat formula simply doesn't work. It wouldn't work for Scheffler, Rory, Schauffele, Cantlay or anyone else in their 20's or 30's. It's certainly not going to work for a 48-year old guy with one leg who has had 10 surgeries in the last 10 years.\n\nTiger isn't completely wrong with his assessment of his 2024 play. His \"data\" from tee-to-green isn't terrible. He's not Tiger of 2000, 2005 or 2010, but Father Time is undefeated. You're also getting older, too. We all are. A downturn in performance was always going to happen.\n\nThe prevailing thought with Tiger always was his \"B game\" -- at age 45, let's say -- would still be good enough to beat the \"kids\" coming out on the PGA Tour. And that might have been true, too. But we haven't seen his \"B game\" since the car accident. He's barely played to a Korn Ferry Tour level.\n\nAll that said, Tiger's biggest problem on the course is the other thing I've been talking about and writing about for well over five years now. Even before the 2021 car accident.\n\nHe's no longer a great putter.\n\nAnd if you're a believer in the data, it would tell you he's barely a \"good\" putter any longer. He's become, much to his horror, I'm sure, an \"average TOUR putter\".\n\nThere were two undeniable things about Tiger during his career zenith and they were the reasons why he joined Sam Snead as the sport's all-time winningest player with 82 wins.\n\nHe chewed up the par 5 holes in every tournament he played.\n\nHe made more putts inside of 10 feet than anyone else. Ever.\n\nBoth of those attributes no longer exist.\n\nIn the first two rounds alone, he missed numerous six foot putts. He was never going to win, of course, but a 79 is really a 75 if you make four of those shorties. And even though he's playing a hair better in his second round on Friday, he's still missing too many putts to have any kind of chance to post a reasonable score.\n\nJust now, I watched him stripe it down the fairway on a hole on the back nine and leave himself 120 yards to the hole.\n\n\"Old\" Tiger hits the approach shot from 120 yards to 12 feet and rolls that in for birdie, waving to the crowd and forcing the TV commentators to say, \"My, my, that man sure does know how to attack a golf course, doesn't he?\"\n\nToday's Tiger hit a shot that found the left corner of the green. He then putted from 35 feet and rolled the birdie effort past the hole by five or six feet. And then he missed the par putt and walked away with a bogey.\n\nI would never say Tiger is done. I watched Phil Mickelson win the PGA Championship at age 50. Now, sure, Phil's in much better shape than Woods will be when he turns 50 in December of 2025. But these guys aren't running marathons. They're playing golf.\n\nSo, while I won't go as far as saying Tiger is \"done\", I'll just keep saying what I've been saying for the last few years.\n\nHe can't compete and he can't win if he doesn't play tournament golf.\n\nThis four-times-a-year thing where he tries to magically pull a rabbit out of his hat at the major championships is a failure-waiting-to-happen.\n\nAnd if I know that, Tiger certainly knows it as well.\n\nHe even said as much yesterday.\n\nAs for the tournament itself, Royal Troon is the early winner two days into the season's final major championship.\n\nThe golf course is phenomenal.\n\nThere are hard holes, easy holes, long holes and short holes. And funny enough, the shortest hole (#8, par 3, 110 yards or so) is one of the hardest holes.\n\nThere's a lot of golf left to be played on Friday but the guess here is that someone will lead at day's end with a score of 7 under. Bad weather is rolling in for Saturday and it promises to be, as they like to say over there, a \"proper Open Championship day\". The weather will be better on Sunday for the final round.\n\nSomeone named Daniel Brown finished the first round as the leader at 6-under par. Never heard of him? Don't worry, neither has anyone else. And, no, he's not going to be Ben Curtis or Todd Hamilton, two other guys you never heard of until they won the British Open out of nowhere a long time ago.\n\nThere aren't any other storylines percolating just yet. Billy Horschel (a #DMD pick) is the very early clubhouse leader through 36 holes at 2-under par. He finished playing at 7:30 am EST on Friday.\n\nShane Lowry sits around 7 under par and on top of the leaderboard midway through the second round but he just hit his 2nd shot at #11 into an area of the course where you could play until Christmas and never be able to hit your ball from there.\n\nSomething tells me Lowry will hang around until Sunday when he'll fire and fall back.\n\nScottie Scheffler is hanging around, as is Patrick Cantlay. Justin Thomas was very solid on Thursday but plays late on Friday, when the weather is apparently going to start moving in.\n\nThere's a lot of golf left. The leaderboard after round two will tell us more, since the cut falls after 36 holes. Anyone not making the cut heads home, anyone who gets to play the weekend still has a chance.\n\nfaith in sports\n\nThis week's MLB All-Star Game featured a number of players who openly share their faith when given the opportunity.\n\nOne of those players was Yankees star Aaron Judge.\n\nWe love to spotlight athletes who are willing to take the microphone and glorify God and his son, Jesus Christ. We're not overly thrilled about spotlighting a Yankee in these parts. But we're OK with making an exception this time around.\n\nWatch what Judge and other MLB stars had to say in the video below.\n\nThanks, as always, to our friends at Freestate Electrical for their continued support of #DMD and \"Faith in Sports\" here every Friday.\n\nThursday\n\nJuly 18, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3618\n\nand #1 is......\n\nUnlike yesterday morning, when I had the opportunity to wait until just after 8 AM to see ESPN.com's list of the top 26-50 athletes of the last 25 years, I don't have time to hang around this morning and wait for them to unveil their final 25.\n\nIt's probably better that way, honestly.\n\nIt's 5:50 AM as I write this. I've been up since 2:00 AM watching the British Open. Below you're going to see my top 5. If this Thursday morning was of the \"normal\" variety, I'd wait to see who they release as their top 5 and then I'd spend 45 minutes tearing into ESPN.com.\n\nThis way, I can tear into them tomorrow.\n\nMy top 5 are below.\n\nYou won't agree with them, which is part of the fun, actually.\n\nI don't agree with about 80% of the list I've seen from ESPN.com thus far. Far, far too many women's basketball players, for starters. And simply way too many soccer players in general.\n\nAs I've alluded to this week, several of the misplaced athletes led me to know, right away, the ESPN.com list was a comical attempt at appeasing everyone.\n\nThere's beyond zero chance that a list of the top 100 athletes of the last 25 years can have the best hockey player (Ovechkin), best baseball hitter (Ichiro) and best baseball athlete (Ohtani) outside of the top 25. Alas, they did. But, hey, Tamika Catchings came in at #37, so ESPN.com has that going for them......which is nice.\n\nAnyway, here's the way I see it.\n\nThere are pretty much five non-negotiable athletes that have to be in ESPN.com's top 10 somewhere; LeBron James, Tom Brady, Patrick Mahomes, Michael Phelps and Novak Djokovic.\n\nSwimmer Katie Ledecky will be in the top 25. Maybe as high as #15 or so.\n\nSeeing those listed so far and realizing that Serena Williams, Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer aren't yet listed in the 100-26 range (Andy Murray is the highest ranked tennis player so far at #80) tells me that FOUR tennis players (adding in Djokovic) will be in the top 25. That's a lot of tennis players.\n\nTiger Woods is going to be in the top 25 as well. He'll be the only golfer, I'm guessing, since Phil Mickelson has already been listed.\n\nLamar Jackson has to be in the Top 25, right? I realize he hasn't even played one decade, let alone two, but he's one of the best athletes in all of sports right now. Right?\n\nSteph Curry is in there somewhere as well, probably around #20.\n\nLionel Messi will most certainly be in the top 10. I assume another soccer player, Cristiano Ronaldo, will also be in the top 25.\n\nThat's 14 people right there.\n\nI'm missing 11.\n\nIs it a boxer? MMA/UFC fighter? Would they put someone like professional wrestler John Cena in there? I doubt it. But they have a female soccer player named Marta ahead of Ray Lewis, Derek Jeter and Shohei Ohtani, so if that's possible, it's very possible to have John Cena at, say, #24.\n\nAlso, don't discount ESPN.com doing something goofy like listing hot dog eating champion Joey Chestnut at #23. 75 hot dogs, man. No one else in the world can do that in 10 minutes execpt for Joey.\n\nI'm sure there's a no-brainer I'm simply forgetting. It's 4:04 am and I'm watching golf and working on my 3rd cup of coffee. Take it easy on me.\n\nAnyway...\n\nThe moment you've been waiting for has arrived.\n\nMy personal top 5:\n\n5. Messi\n\n4. Tiger\n\n3. Brady\n\n2. Phelps\n\n1. LeBron\n\nYou can mix those five up any way you want and roll them out and whatever order they end up would be fine. Messi is the best soccer player ever. Yes, better than Pele.\n\nTiger's the best golfer ever. Yes, better than Jack.\n\nBrady's the best QB ever. Yes, better than Montana, Unitas and anyone else.\n\nPhelps is the best swimmer, period.\n\nAnd while I'm not sure LeBron is the best basketball player ever (he has a lot of competition for that honor), there's no doubt he's the best of the last 25 years.\n\nAnd my personal methodology when putting something like this together is I always ask myself, \"Could that guy play some other sport?\"\n\nI think LeBron could have been a NFL player. Or a baseball player. He's Deion Sanders x 3.\n\nMy point, though, is I think those are the best 5 and you can put them in order you want and I'd be OK with it.\n\nI think Djokovic deserves Top 5 consideration as well.\n\nSo, too, does Serena Williams.\n\nPatrick Mahomes doesn't deserve top 5 right now, but he's as athletic as anyone who has played that position...and...he's a winner.\n\nI'll wait anxiously to see the 1-25 list that ESPN.com publishes on Thursday. And I'll be here on Friday to tell you how nuts they were for putting LeBron at #7 or Tiger at #15 or Katie Ledecky at #6.\n\n\"Randy On The O's\"\n\nRandy Morgan takes #DMD readers through the recent week in Orioles baseball as the Birds try to win a second straight A.L. East title.\n\no's midseason review\n\nSince we’ve reached the All-Star break, today we’ll review the Orioles first “half” of the season in lieu of our usual question of the week.\n\nDespite the disappointing week leading into the All-Star break, the Orioles first “half” was still massively successful.\n\nWith the wild win over New York last Sunday, the team finished atop the AL East, one game ahead of the Yankees. They also finished tied for the most wins in the American League, only trailing the Phillies in the entire league, with the third best win percentage in all of MLB.\n\nThe Orioles were also one of the best teams against tough competition, with the second most wins against teams over .500.\n\nEven after the poor final week, the team is on pace for about 97 to 98 wins. Fangraphs has them as a near lock for the playoffs, with a 96% chance of at least getting a Wild Card. The site gives them just a 43.4% chance of winning the division, slightly favoring the Yankees despite their recent tailspin.\n\nAlthough you couldn’t tell from watching last week, the Orioles offense was among the very best in the league in the first half of the ‘24 campaign.\n\nThe O’s finished first in MLB in Baseball Reference’s OPS+, which adjusts for park effects. They were second in Fangraphs’ similar wRC+ statistic. They had the top hard hit percentage in the league and were second in average exit velocity, with a near league average batting average on balls in play, suggesting the success is no mirage or matter of luck.\n\nIf you wanted to nitpick the offense, they have struggled a bit in clutch situations, where they were top of the league last season.\n\nThe O’s are 18th in Fangraphs’ “Clutch” hitting stat and just 19th in the league in batting average with runners in scoring position. They have been one of the worst teams in the league at scoring runners from third base with less than two outs as well.\n\nThe Birds have also been less patient at the plate than in past seasons, placing a league average 14th in on-base percentage and 22nd in BB/K ratio. Though this has been more than made up for by a league leading slugging percentage and home run total.\n\nOn the other hand, the Orioles pitching has not been nearly as elite. While they rank a solid 6th in ERA, they are around league average (15th) in ERA+, which adjusts for park effects. The O’s are 10th in runs allowed per game and 10th in K/BB ratio.\n\nThey are 7th in Fielding Independent Pitching, which suggests they aren’t over-reliant on defense or luck. The pitchers have been roughly league average in both exit velocity and hard hit percentage allowed.\n\nThe starters have been better than the bullpen thus far, with starter ERA ranking 5th in the league, led by Corbin Burnes who is in line to start the All-Star game. Meanwhile, the bullpen ERA is 14th in the league, leaving ample room for improvement.\n\nAs we look ahead to the second “half” of the season and the upcoming trade deadline, the Orioles' needs are clear; they have to improve their pitching.\n\nWhile it initially looked like Albert Suarez, Cade Povich and Cole Irvin may be able to exceed expectations and secure the back half of the rotation, it has now been made clear that none are a suitable replacement for the missing Kyle Bradish and John Means.\n\nThe front office will not sit on their hands. There are surely moves to be made in the coming weeks. The team will likely add at least one starter and one reliever before the deadline.\n\nHopefully they can be much more impactful than Jack Flaherty and Shintaro Fujinami were last season. With a deep and talented farm system, the O’s should be able to secure a few valuable pieces to boost their chances down the stretch this season.\n\nOrioles Midseason MVP: Gunnar Henderson\n\nWhile the Player of the Week award has often been difficult to hand out with so many strong contributors among the mostly winning weeks, the midseason MVP is a no-brainer in Birdland.\n\nGunnar Henderson has not only been the Orioles MVP, but the second-year star is in a head to head battle with Aaron Judge as frontrunners for the AL MVP.\n\nHenderson entered the All-Star break 2nd in WAR at both Fangraphs and Baseball Reference, slightly behind Judge in both cases.\n\nWhile Judge has been better at the plate, Gunnar has also provided top notch defense at the most important position on the field. Gunnar hasn’t been shabby with the bat either, finishing the weekend with a .286/.373/.584 slash line, good for a 174 OPS+ (74% better than average). He has smashed 28 home runs and leads MLB in runs scored with 78.\n\nIt has been a long time since we’ve had a baseball player like Gunnar in Baltimore. He has been a joy to watch day in and day out and we are certainly lucky to have perennial MVP candidates leading both teams in town.\n\nIn addition to Gunnar, Corbin Burnes certainly deserves an honorable mention for this award. The ace acquired from Milwaukee in the offseason has been everything the Orioles could have expected.\n\nBurnes finished the half with a 2.43 ERA, good for second best in the American League and he sits at 5th in MLB with a 154 ERA+, which is adjusted for ballparks.\n\nBurnes has been the picture of consistency, cranking out quality start after quality start and putting the O’s in position to win nearly every game he starts. The O’s will have no worries about sending Burnes out to start game one of any playoff series. The only drama with Burnes will be whether the new owner opens up the pocket book to keep him around beyond this season.\n\nWednesday\n\nJuly 17, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3617\n\nand the winner is...\n\nIf today's edition of #DMD is focusing on a \"winner\", I can tell you for sure who it isn't a winner: The person that designed those All-Star Game uniforms.\n\nAnd the person within Major League Baseball who looked at those and gave his/her approval? Not a winner as well.\n\nThose uniforms were awful.\n\nThat's pretty much all the commentary I have on the game. I watched a total of about 20 pitches. It's just not my thing.\n\nI've written here on numerous occasions about how treasured the All-Star Game was in my younger days. It was one of the best sports nights of the year.\n\nAlas, there's a saying: All good things must come to an end. And that's what happened to the All-Star Game. It used to be good. It no longer is.\n\nThe American League won, 5-3, by the way. Good for them.\n\nWe started our review and discussion of ESPN.com's Top 100 Athletes here yesterday, and the first two curveballs were in the 51-75 category that was released on Tuesday morning.\n\nAlex Ovechkin at #54 and Shohei Ohtani at #62.\n\nWe'll get to Ray Lewis and J.J. Watt in a minute, don't worry.\n\nI'm not confused about Ovechkin at #54 because he's a Capital and they're my favorite team, ever.\n\nAnd it will really stand out as an awful spot for Ovi once we see today's list of those from 50-26. There will be at least a dozen head-scratchers on that list above him, I'm guessing.\n\nI'm confused because he is, without argument, either the first or second best hockey player in the world over the last 25 years. He has been the NHL's version of Lionel Messi, who is likely going to fall somewhere in the Top 35, I'm figuring.\n\nUnless something dramatically wacky happens, he will become the NHL's all-time leading scorer sometime in October or November of 2025.\n\nNow, perhaps that blunder is just ESPN.com's way of gently telling us they don't follow and/or value hockey all that much. If so, no worries there. I don't follow the WNBA all that much, so I'm out of touch on that league just like ESPN is apparently out of touch with what Ovechkin has done over the last two decades.\n\nI will have to see the rest of the list to figure out where I think Ovechkin should be, but he's a clearly a Top 20 athlete at the very least.\n\nAs for Ohtani...\n\nI have no idea what to make of his insertion at #62 on the list but I can only assume it's a \"service\" issue with him and nothing else. He hasn't even been around for 10 years, which probably made it hard for them to put him in the Top 10 where he clearly belongs.\n\nIf, in fact, we're talking about athleticism ONLY and we're putting more stock in what they can do over what their statistical accomplishments are (were), Ohtani is perhaps the best athlete we've seen over the last 25 years.\n\nHe could be #1.\n\nHe can throw a baseball 100 MPH and hit a 450 foot home run, on the same night, like he did in Baltimore back in May of 2023.\n\nI'm not sure when he'll have the opportunity to pitch again, but there could very well come a day when Ohtani throws a no hitter on the same night he also hits the game-winning home run in the bottom of the 8th inning. He's Babe Ruth in modern times. Having Ohtani at #62 was beyond bizarre.\n\nAs for the J.J. Watt (#58) and Ray Lewis (#61) debate, it's not about where they both fall on the list. Football experts might say -- and be right -- that Watt was more stellar at his position than was Lewis at his. Maybe. I don't really care. We're talking three spots, anyway.\n\nBut for those two football stalwarts to fall behind Alexia Putellas at #56 is, right now, ESPN.com's #clownshoes moment of the list thus far.\n\nIf you think Steve Nash was better at basketball than Ray Lewis was at football, have at it.\n\nBut to suggest, in any way, that Alexia Putellas should rank ahead of Watt, Lewis and the greatest relief pitcher in baseball history, Mariano Rivera, is the ultimate attempt at pandering to the masses.\n\n\"Don't forget, we have Luka Modric, a male soccer player at #55. Get Putellas, the Spanish female soccer player, in there somewhere close to him.\"\n\nWorst of all, they put former U.S. soccer star Mia Hamm at #64.\n\nAnyway, the 75-51 list was a disaster. It leads me to worry that 50-26 (today) will be one as well.\n\nTo borrow a great line from a great movie: I expected more from a varsity letterman.\n\nEditor's note: The 26-50 portion of the list was just released at 8:00 am as this was being published. Ichiro Suzuki is at #37. The list is officially in the toilet now.\n\nThree quick programming notes for your personal calendar. My weekly golf radio show on 105.7 will air this Sunday from 2-4 pm instead of its usual 4-6 pm time slot. This gives us the opportunity for immediate live reaction to the final round of the British Open, which should conclude at 1:30 pm or so.\n\nTomorrow here at #DMD we'll be featuring Randy Morgan's first half review of the O's and a look back at how they're doing and what to expect over the season's final two and a half months.\n\nAnd don't forget, tomorrow night (Thursday) at 5:30 pm, we're holding our monthly free FCA junior golf clinic at Pine Ridge. Juniors ages 6-18 are welcome to attend. Parents can certainly hang around and observe as well. Bring a water bottle for hydration fill-ups and a set of golf clubs. We'll do the rest.\n\n#dmd's british open top 10\n\nYes, I still call it the British Open.\n\nI know it's formally known, now, as The Open Championship, but when you say \"Open Championship\", how do you know where it's being played?\n\nWhen you say \"U.S. Open\", you know it's in the U.S.\n\nWhen you say \"British Open\", you know it's being played in Great Britain. Or the United Kingdom. I realize they are not one and the same but you get the point. I call it the \"British\" Open because it's held over there, if you will.\n\nAnyway, they're playing this year's edition of the British Open at Royal Troon, where 9 other \"Open Championships\" have been held since 1923. The last four of them have all featured something similarily unique. The winners all won their first (and as it turned out, only) major championship at Troon.\n\nMark Calcavecchia (1989), Justin Leonard (1997), Todd Hamilton (2004) and Henrik Stenson (2016) were the four most recent winners, with only Hamilton being a complete surprise. Calcavecchia, Leonard and Stenson were all top ranked players who were favored to win a major at some point and Troon just happened to be the site of their eventual victory.\n\nYou're going to see a theme with our Top 10. The names will not necessarily be of the household variety.\n\nWe'll issue our usual caveat when it comes to wagering on majors in 2024. Scottie Scheffler is currently at +400, which is kind of a crazy-low number, of course. You won't make much money on him if he wins. I assume he'll be right there at the end on Sunday. He is Scottie Scheffler, after all.\n\nBut for purposes of this 10-day exercise, we won't be listing Scheffler. We're urging you to wager on him to win just so you can wave the winning ticket at your friends, but there are several other players we're very high on and would urge you to consider as well.\n\nThe theme we're going with isn't that much different than last year's winner, Brian Harman. Or the 1989 winner in Mark Calcavechhia. We're keen on players who are nudging up against winning a major but just haven't managed to do it quite yet.\n\nRecent history at Troon suggests one of those kind of players is going to be holding the Claret Jug on July 21.\n\n#10 was Corey Conners. Robert MacIntyre was #9. Aaron Rai was #8. Xander Schauffele was #7. Billy Horschel was #6. Min Woo Lee was #5. #4 was Adam Scott. #3 was Collin Morikawa. #2 was Matthieu Pavon.\n\n#1 Viktor Hovland and Tony Finau -- Let me explain. I know it looks weird to have two guys at #1.\n\nI think it's going to be very difficult for Bob MacIntyre (listed above at #9) to win this week given that he just won last week at the Scottish Open. If you've already thrown some coin on him, maybe you'll be blessed. But I'd shy away from him given his success of last Sunday.\n\nSo......\n\nI've sorta-kinda replaced him on my list by giving you two players at #1, both of whom I'm very high on this week.\n\nViktor Hovland and Tony Finau.\n\nWhen I think of someone like Justin Leonard winning at Troon and think of an American comparison, it's Finau.\n\nWhen I think of someone like Henrik Stenson winning at Troon and think of a European comparison, it's Hovland.\n\nLeonard was \"due\" to win a major when he captured the '97 British Open. Finau's record in majors is quite impressive. He just hasn't finished on off yet. He very well might this week. He's also at a really nice number of 40-1.\n\nStenson was also one of those \"best players without a major\" when he finally claimed his Claret Jug in 2016. Hovland has been knocking on the door of majors for two or three years now and doesn't yet have one. That might change this week. He's due. And ready.\n\nHovland's number is 35-1, which is also quite appealing.\n\nNone of the last four winners at Troon were ever known as exceptionally good putters. Hovland and Finau both fit that bill. They get hot and streaky with the flat stick, though, which is all they're hoping for this week.\n\nTuesday\n\nJuly 16, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3616\n\nforget 2 to 100, who is #1?\n\nLike just about, well, everyone in the sports media world, ESPN.com is looking for content this summer.\n\nThe political field has content out the wazzoo, obviously. While some of those folks still do make stuff up to write or talk about, they certainly don't need to generate their own stories. Not until mid-November at the very least.\n\nSports has hit that patch in the summer where things have simmered down. Hockey and basketball (just) ended in June, there's only one golf major left on the calendar (this week) and even though football training camps are beginning here shortly, the teams now do most of their own content and the media need is just no longer what it once was for NFL clubs.\n\nSo, people like ESPN.com are starving for content.\n\nIf not for the two major soccer competitions over the last month and Wimbledon over the last two weeks, they -- and others of their ilk -- would have been really hurting for material.\n\nAs it stands now, ESPN and ESPN.com treat the WNBA like it's Major League Baseball. If they didn't have the WNBA in their back pocket they might have to write about soccer or lacrosse during the summer downtime.\n\nLooking for clicks and in a genuine effort to drum up conversation, too, ESPN.com is putting together their Top 100 Athletes Of This Century.\n\nBefore I present anything else of interest about their Top 100, here's the \"Methodology\" ESPN.com used to create their list:\n\nExperts in individual sports were asked to vote to rank the top athletes in their sport since Jan. 1, 2000 (no accomplishments before this date were to be considered). Those votes pared down pools in each sport to lists of 10 to 25 athletes each, which constituted the overall candidate pool for the top athletes of the 21st century so far. Each voter was presented two randomly selected names and asked to pick which one has had the better career in the 21st century. Across repeated, randomized head-to-head matchups, more than 70,000 votes were cast at this stage, and using an Elo rating system, the list was pared down from 262 to 100. That list was then evaluated by a panel of experts for any inconsistencies or oversights, resulting in the top 100 ranking seen here.\n\nSo they didn't sit around a coffee table, apparently, and yell out the obvious names: Brady! LeBron! Tiger! Serena! Djokovic! Jeter!\n\nThere was a formula in place that helped the ESPN and their list-makers come to some sort of agreement. I know it's not easy to come up with the #1 athlete when there were so many remarkable accomplishments and careers in the almost 25-year span. It actually does require a variety of opinions and research nuggets to be uncovered that either confirm or alter those opinions.\n\nThey released 100-76 yesterday and will release the rest of the list in groups of 25 this week.\n\nEd Reed was #99, by the way. That should tell you something about the list. He got beat out by the likes of Annika Sorenstam (golf), A'ja Wilson (basketball) and a cricket player 99.5% of the people reading this have never heard of, Virat Kohli.\n\nI have no idea why ESPN.com throws an obscure cricket player in as a \"better athlete\" than Ed Reed, but I'm also the guy who thinks Jimmie Johnson (auto racing) and John Velazquez (horse racing) should be on the list because they, too, are athletes of the highest caliber.\n\nSo, that's why there's a list in the first place. \"Throw a cricket player in there somewhere and see if you can stir up some controversy.\"\n\nAnyway, speaking of the Ravens, I assume there are two others on the list. I suspect Ray Lewis is in the 75-51 category or maybe even as low as the 50-26 group. If you made me bet it, though, I'd say it's Lamar in the 50-26 group with Ray somewhere around number 55 or so.\n\nWho, though, is #1?\n\nAnd even better, who actually should be #1?\n\nWhy the two questions? Because ESPN.com is prone to posturing in an effort to placate everyone they possibly can. Or at the very least, they're eager to satisfy a large portion of their \"target audience\" because, as we referenced here yesterday with regard to TV networks and their quest for ad dollars, that's the way they stay in business over the long haul.\n\nWe also get to that pesky word of \"athlete\", which is something that bogs us down and fans the flames. If you don't think a 100-and-some-pound jockey commandeering a 1,000 pound horse around a track that it might or might not want to run around on that particular occasion isn't an athletic endeavor, then you have no idea what athleticism really is.\n\nThe same goes for auto racers. You drive from here to Ocean City and you have to stop at least once to pee, once for food and maybe one more time to stretch when the traffic hits a standstill just outside of Rehoboth Beach or Salisbury. Those folks strap themselves in a car and drive it 200 miles an hour around a track for four or six hours at a time.\n\nOne of the reasons why \"athlete lists\" are so hard to compile is because we stuck in the starting gate with the debate about \"athlete\" and how we, as a society, see them.\n\nIf you don't have 2% body fat and aren't 6'3\", 185, are you immediately discounted?\n\nHe's long gone, now, but you don't think someone like professional wrestler King Kong Bundy was an \"athlete\"? I'm not trying to argue about the validity of professional wrestling as a \"sport\" (even though ESPN.com covers it like it is a sport), but I would definitely love to hear you tell me that Dwayne Johnson -- as \"The Rock\" -- wasn't an athlete during his wrestling heyday.\n\nSo, yes, I love these kinds of lists and the water cooler discussion(s) they generate. But I always wind up disagreeing with where someone goes or doesn't go and it's almost always a byproduct of that word - athlete.\n\nGolf is a sport, now, where kids who aren't athletic just have very little chance of ever being really good.\n\nIf any sport on the planet has gone from \"non-athletic\" to \"athletic\" in the last 25 years, it's golf. The entire swing and body movement that's being taught these days is an athletic effort from the ground up.\n\nOne of the very first questions I ask a junior golfer that I come across during camps or my teachings is this: \"What other sports do you play or have you played?\"\n\nIf I hear \"I haven't played any\", I know I'm starting from a different spot than if I hear, \"soccer\", \"tennis\" (my favorite to hear), \"lacrosse\", etc.\n\nSo, back to the topic at hand: \"Athleticism\", what is it, and how do we measure it when we're considering the greatest 100 athletes of the last 25 years?\n\nBut let's not allow that argument -- what about bowlers? there's another one -- to get in the way of the quest to figure out who is #1 on the list. And who should be #1 on the list, too.\n\nMy guess? LeBron is the #1 athlete on ESPN.com's list.\n\nI assume Brady is perhaps #2, but they might throw a curveball at us and put Brady at #3 or #4.\n\nIt's easier to do this when you take the four major sports, first, and throw out the obvious non-factors. The best hockey players over the last 25 years have been Ovechkin and Crosby or Crosby and Ovechkin. They're not in the Top 10. I could see Ovechkin perhaps being at #20 or thereabouts because of the goal-scoring-record chase, but that's his ceiling.\n\nThe best tennis players are (were) great, don't get me wrong. Federer, Djokovic, Serena, Nadal, etc. But I doubt any of those four make the Top 10, with the outside chance that Serena slides in at #9 or so and winds up being the \"top female\" on the list.\n\nIt's almost a disservice to Serena, Simone Biles, and any other female of note who should be considered for the list. They should simply have their own list, where we can argue back and forth about their careers and accomplishments. I have a hard time putting Novak Djokovic, for example, at #30 on the list and putting Serena at, say, #15, when I know Djokovic would beat her, every time, 6-2, 6-2, 6-2.\n\nAnd, not that it matters, really, but I think giving Serena two games in each set is me just being generous.\n\nAnyway...\n\nSo if we eliminate tennis players, we're also eliminating golfers. And, obviously, the only golfer that even comes into the discussion is Tiger and I'm going to guess he winds up somewhere around #7 or #8. Your mileage may vary on that one, but I think that's a fair spot for him. If he winds up at #4 or #5 I'd consider that an overplay and if Woods is at #18 I would consider that out of whack as well.\n\nBut the Top 5 is really what we're trying to zero in on here, because from there you can chip away until you figure out the right order.\n\nI'm holding out on my own, personal, Top 5 until Thursday morning.\n\nThat said, I know who number one should be. Whether I wind up aligning with ESPN.com is another story.\n\nAnd you?\n\nIn the Comments section below, tell us who you think #1 should be and who you think ESPN.com's #1 will be.\n\n#dmd's british open top 10\n\nYes, I still call it the British Open.\n\nI know it's formally known, now, as The Open Championship, but when you say \"Open Championship\", how do you know where it's being played?\n\nWhen you say \"U.S. Open\", you know it's in the U.S.\n\nWhen you say \"British Open\", you know it's being played in Great Britain. Or the United Kingdom. I realize they are not one and the same but you get the point. I call it the \"British\" Open because it's held over there, if you will.\n\nAnyway, they're playing this year's edition of the British Open at Royal Troon, where 9 other \"Open Championships\" have been held since 1923.

Scottie Scheffler is currently at +400, which is kind of a crazy-low number, of course. You won't make much money on him if he wins. I assume he'll be right there at the end on Sunday. He is Scottie Scheffler, after all.\n\nBut for purposes of this 10-day exercise, we won't be listing Scheffler.

Robert MacIntyre was #9. Aaron Rai was #8. Xander Schauffele was #7. Billy Horschel was #6. Min Woo Lee was #5. #4 was Adam Scott. #3 was Collin Morikawa.\n\n#2 Matthieu Pavon -- I was pleased as punch a month ago to see Matthieu Pavon fire and fall back in the final round of the U.S. Open at Pinehurst.\n\nI've had Pavon circled as a British Open favorite of mine all season long. And a win at the U.S. Open would have led me to dismiss his chances at Troon later this week.\n\nAlas, he didn't win at Pinehurst in June and he didn't factor in last week's Scottish Open, either, where he missed the cut. But those two nuggets lead me to lean even more heavily in his direction this week, where he's available at anywhere from 100-1 to 150-1 depending on what service you use and how fortunate you are that they don't pay attention to golf.\n\nPavon (Puh-vone) is the perfect off-the-radar-screen guy who could win this week. He has two international wins in the last 12 months, winning in Spain last October on the European Tour and then capturing the event at Torrey Pines on the PGA Tour back in late January.\n\nAs we saw at Pinehurst, he's a ball striking machine. The 31 year old Frenchman will feel right at home at Troon this week and will be able to play in whatever kind of weather is thrown his way.\n\nHis record at the British Open, you ask? He doesn't have one. He played in 2017 and missed the cut.\n\nBut this year, he has a T12 finish at the Masters and a 5th place finish at the U.S. Open. Sandwiched in between was a missed cut at the PGA.\n\nI know he's not a popular U.S. household name, but he's precisely the guy who leads after 54 holes at Troon and gets you some Top 10 money if he falters or a buyout offer through 5 holes on Sunday if you have $20 on him at 100-1. There are a lot of ways to win with Matthieu Pavon this week and I'm here for them.\n\nMonday\n\nJuly 15, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3615\n\nwhere's the manual?\n\nLike most of you, I assume, I've been involved in numerous discussions over the last couple of days with friends and family members about the horrific incident in Butler, PA on Saturday.\n\nSports, at least in my life, has taken a back seat over the last 36 hours or so. This is real-time tension and concern we're seeing unfold in front of us and it's incredibly nerve-wracking given what we all know are the possibilities and capabilities of folks in this country.\n\nThat said, anyone hear any good Alex Verdugo fielding jokes recently? We'll get to him and his 9th inning error shortly, don't you worry about that.\n\n\"How are we going to fix it?\" a friend's 14 year old son said to me yesterday at Eagle's Nest.\n\nThat, I think, is the most pressing question. \"Why do we this to ourselves?\" is certainly important to navigate, but \"How are we going to fix it?\" is the bigger issue.\n\nThe problem is there's no manual for it or, in this day and age, no website to click on to fix it.\n\nAt least that's what most people think. We'll get back to that one shortly as well.\n\nThe idea that we solve our problems by shooting guns at people is not new, no matter what side of the political fence you're on and how much you disdain or approve of guns.\n\nShooting guns at people to resolve our differences has been going on since the Civil War. We didn't play chess to decide if the North should rule the South or the South should rule the North, remember.\n\nSo this notion that we've suddenly slipped into a country where it's guns, guns, guns is wildly off base. We've been shooting at one another for a long time.\n\nAnd it's not just recently that political figures became the target of violence, either. People act like the 1963 Kennedy assassination was the first time a President was gunned down. Abraham Lincoln, anyone?\n\nBut what's happened in our country over the last two decades is somewhat new. And this is where we need a manual. Because we simply can't fix it or haven't figured out how to fix it.\n\nWe are a country that doesn't know how to disagree on something and move on from there.\n\nThat's the root of our problems. Period.\n\nThe experts on CNN spend hours every day driving home the point that our country is divided. And that is true, for sure. What they gloss over is the fact that they, of course, are one of the reasons why the country is divided in the first place, just as other media entities in the country are as well.\n\nCNN divides us by telling anyone watching how \"their side\" is right and the other side is wrong. That's how they sell their ads. That's how Wolf Blitzer and Anderson Cooper make $15 million a year.\n\nFOX does the same thing.\n\nThey all do it. It's how they make a living. It's an incredibly well produced trap that must have them giggling at the water cooler. Right up until some 20-year old kid tries to kill a Presidential candidate.\n\nIt's not so funny then.\n\nI've written here on numerous occasions over the last few years about the most obvious -- and maddening -- method we use to resolve our differences in this country: It's called \"what about'ism\".\n\n\"The former President was shot today. That's awful isn't it?\"\n\n\"What about the time he laughed at Nancy Pelosi's husband for being attacked?\"\n\n\"We have to do something about this gun violence. Someone just tried to assassinate a former President.\"\n\n\"What about Sandy Hook? The Republicans weren't crying about gun violence when that happened.\"\n\nAnd this isn't a testimonial centered only on horrific attempted murders, either.\n\nWe use \"what about?\" to resolve our own personal, petty differences, too.\n\nThis, of course, is a very, very small thing. I only bring it up because it's here, at #DMD, and readily available for me to make comment on.\n\nI wrote something here yesterday about a conversation I had with my son about baseball and the Saturday incident in Butler, PA and someone in the Comments section wrote something about \"hate and vitriol for the Flyers.\"\n\nClassic \"what about?\" if ever there was one.\n\nBut far more important than some goof on a website in Maryland are the problems we've developed here in this country, all on our own.\n\nI have no idea what caused this sea change in the way we deal with disagreements. Food coloring? Too much sun? Not enough vitamin B12?\n\nSomething has happened in this century.\n\nWe do not know how to successfully and productively resolve our differences.\n\nEveryone points out how we need unity in this country. We have two very distinct political parties. At the root of those two parties is a common theme shared by both: \"We're right and you're wrong.\"\n\nThat's why they fought the Civil War.\n\nAnd that's why we're still fighting today.\n\nEach party believes they're right. And this November, at the battle box (President Biden has no idea how right he was last night when he slipped up and said that), one of the parties will be \"right\" and one will be \"wrong\". One will win, one will lose.\n\nAnd the winner will rejoice and laugh and the loser will cry and rebel.\n\nThe differences will not be \"solved\" in November. They will actually heighten.\n\nWe simply do not know how to disagree on something and move on from there.\n\nUnity?\n\nI don't know how you're possibly going to be unified when the system in place is designed to create and enhance division.\n\nAnd then every time you open your web browser, read a newspaper or turn on the TV, you're met with people telling you to pick a side, stand your ground and not give an inch to the other side.\n\nI never hear CNN or FOX telling their viewers to consider \"the other side\".\n\nDoing that would cost them viewers. Which in turn would cost them advertisers. Which then leads to decreased revenue. And when that happens, Anderson Cooper or Bret Baier might only make $2.5 million annually.\n\nSo our political climate is designed to divide us.\n\nThe media is effectively in business to divide us.\n\nAnd we're shocked and mortified that we are, in fact, divided?\n\nWorst of all, though? We can't fix it.\n\nAnd the reason it can't be fixed is the same reason why you and your little sister or brother used to argue all the time: No one is willing to say, \"I don't want to win. I just want this to be better.\"\n\nWe just don't know how to disagree and move on from there.\n\nI wrote earlier there's no manual for this stuff, which isn't exactly true, of course. There is a book we can all read that serves as the best self-help book ever written: the Bible.\n\nAnd in that book you'll find everything we're dealing with today, 2,000 years later. Anger, hostility, violence, greed, betrayal and, yes, even murder.\n\nBut in that book you'll also find someone, Jesus Christ, who gave us the example of how one could and should live their life.\n\nSadly, we all fall short of Him. Some people try harder than others to follow his living example, but in the end none of us do it.\n\nThe manual, though, does exist. The problem is our country has distanced itself from that manuscript and believes there's a better way.\n\nI disagree with shunning the Bible, but I don't harbor any ill feelings if you agree with it. We'll all be judged accordingly some day. I hope your day of judgement goes well just as I pray that mine does.\n\nBut we're still back to the issue at hand, which is our country's sanity and safety, both of which are compromised at this point, mostly of our doing.\n\nNovember won't solve it.\n\nOnly we can solve it.\n\nI hope it gets fixed in my children's lifetime and they become part of the solution. As a parent, that's all I ask of them.\n\nBe part of the solution, not part of the problem.\n\nNow, let's focus on something fun for a second, which was the Orioles much-needed 6-5 win over the Yankees yesterday at Camden Yards.\n\nIt wasn't fun in the top of the 9th when Craig Kimbrel served up a 3-run gopher ball to Ben Rice -- after walking the #8 and #9 hitters, no less -- to move the O's from a 3-2 lead to a 5-3 deficit.\n\nBut it was wildly fun in the bottom of the 9th when two New York errors on plays that would have ended the game worked out in the O's favor and they wound up on the positive end of a 6-5 victory.\n\nFirst, it was Anthony Volpe failing to handle a routine grounder at shortstop.\n\nThen it was Alex Verdugo bungling a standard fly ball to left field that led to a pair of runs scoring to end the game.\n\nIn typical baseball fashion, the official scorekeeper credited Cedric Mullins with a \"hit\" on that final swing of the bat, but if that was a hit then I'm walking on the moon this Thursday.\n\nIt was an error. A mistake. A play that should have been made but wasn't. But Mullins was given a hit and the O's won, which is really all that matters anyway.\n\nAnd for one day, at least, or perhaps one inning, as it were, all was well in Birdland.\n\nThe next two weeks will be big for Mike Elias and his staff.\n\nTrades?\n\nWho do the Birds get?\n\nWho do they give up?\n\nThere's a juicy story floating around about J.D. Martinez and Luis Severino coming to Baltimore, but the Mets have suddenly started to perk up and are now 49-46 and in the middle of the wild card race in the National League. So we'll have to see about that one.\n\nEither way, the next two weeks will be fun, fun, fun.\n\nThe O's start the 2nd half of the campaign in Texas and then down in Miami against the Marlins before returning home to face Manny Machado and the Padres. By the time San Diego gets to town, you can expect to see some new Birds at Camden Yards.\n\n#dmd's british open top 10\n\nYes, I still call it the British Open.\n\nI know it's formally known, now, as The Open Championship, but when you say \"Open Championship\", how do you know where it's being played?\n\nWhen you say \"U.S. Open\", you know it's in the U.S.\n\nWhen you say \"British Open\", you know it's being played in Great Britain. Or the United Kingdom. I realize they are not one and the same but you get the point. I call it the \"British\" Open because it's held over there, if you will.\n\nAnyway, they're playing this year's edition of the British Open at Royal Troon, where 9 other \"Open Championships\" have been held since 1923. The last four of them have all featured something similarily unique. The winners all won their first (and as it turned out, only) major championship at Troon.\n\nMark Calcavecchia (1989), Justin Leonard (1997), Todd Hamilton (2004) and Henrik Stenson (2016) were the four most recent winners, with only Hamilton being a complete surprise. Calcavecchia, Leonard and Stenson were all top ranked players who were favored to win a major at some point and Troon just happened to be the site of their eventual victory.\n\nYou're going to see a theme with our Top 10. The names will not necessarily be of the household variety.\n\nWe'll issue our usual caveat when it comes to wagering on majors in 2024. Scottie Scheffler is currently at +400, which is kind of a crazy-low number, of course. You won't make much money on him if he wins. I assume he'll be right there at the end on Sunday. He is Scottie Scheffler, after all.\n\nBut for purposes of this 10-day exercise, we won't be listing Scheffler. We're urging you to wager on him to win just so you can wave the winning ticket at your friends, but there are several other players we're very high on and would urge you to consider as well.\n\nThe theme we're going with isn't that much different than last year's winner, Brian Harman. Or the 1989 winner in Mark Calcavechhia. We're keen on players who are nudging up against winning a major but just haven't managed to do it quite yet.\n\nRecent history at Troon suggests one of those kind of players is going to be holding the Claret Jug on July 21.\n\n#10 was Corey Conners. Robert MacIntyre was #9. Aaron Rai was #8. Xander Schauffele was #7. Billy Horschel was #6. Min Woo Lee was #5. #4 was Adam Scott.\n\n#3 Collin Morikawa -- I was happy to see Morikawa slip up on the back nine yesterday at the Scottish Open and fail to win. I don't know that anyone can win twice in seven days, which makes my #9 pick (above) a bit concerning.\n\nAnyway, the British Open is perfect for Collin Morikawa. He's already won it once, of course, and I have to assume he's winning at least one more Claret Jug in his career if not more than one.\n\nThe greens over there simply aren't as difficult as the ones he regularly faces in the U.S., and that's a good thing for Morikawa, who only has one real weakness: putting.\n\nAnd, as I say all the time, Morikawa is not a \"bad\" putter. If he were a bad putter, he wouldn't have two majors and be one of the best 10 players in the world. He's just not a GREAT putter, that's all.\n\nBut I sure do love his chances this week at Troon, where he's 20-1 to win his 3rd career major title.\n\nSunday\n\nJuly 14, 2024#DMDIssue\n\n#3614\n\n\"things are really bad, huh?\"\n\nMy son wandered in early Saturday evening and sat next to me on the couch.\n\n\"Man, Dad, things are really bad, huh?\"\n\nI didn't even feel like talking about it, honestly.\n\nI mean, what do you say?\n\nBut when your son is looking at you for answers, it's your fatherly duty to try to give him peace.\n\n\"Well,\" I said. \"The good news is the All Star Break is coming up.\"\n\n\"Sometimes even good teams need a little time to get reset. They need to take a deep breath and realize they're still in good shape,\" I continued.\n\n\"And you have to assume Mike Elias is going to do something at the trade deadline,\" I stated.\n\nI was starting to get on a roll, so I continued. \"We have plenty of guys in the farm system to move. It's just a question of whether he wants to part with them or not and who we can get in exchange and whether they are rentals or players under club control for a couple of years.\"\n\n\"And let's not forget the Yankees aren't chopped liver,\" I reminded my son. \"Their pitching rotation lined up perfectly for these three games in Baltimore and our rotation wasn't all that great. I know the Cubs aren't anything special. But this New York team is pretty decent, so I wouldn't be all that worked up about losing to them.\"\n\n\"Dad, I'm not worried about the losing,\" my son said, his voice lowering.\n\n\"Oh, you're concerned we might not be able to add anyone of quality at the deadline?\" I asked.\n\nBefore he could answer, I gave more support to Mike Elias.\n\n\"Elias has built this organization from the ashes,\" I explained. \"When he took over six years ago, we were a laughingstock. And he vowed to do it the right way and he has. We have a great major league product, the minors are stocked with growing talent, and the O's scouting department will make some other good picks at the upcoming draft.\"\n\nIt was time for me to remind my son about the past, even if he wasn't around for all of it.\n\n\"If you would have been able to watch the games in 2004, 2006 and 2008, you might have a different feelin"
