        "text": "It’s unique.\n\nLiv Tyler has announced her baby’s name.\n\nAnd as seems to be the theme with celebrity parents, Liv has given her son a name that is definitely unique. It may even be foreshadowing a future career.\n\nThe 37-year-old announced her baby’s name in the most gorgeous way over Instagram on the weekend.\n\nWith her little boy's hand holding a sailor pendant she captioned the image, \"Sailor Gene Gardner.\"\n\nLiv's new little bundle of joy has been named Sailor.\n\nHer son was born earlier this month and he was the first for Liv and her partner, Dave Gardner. Little Sailor couldn't wait to come in to the world, so he arrived six weeks early.\n\nLiv's famous dad, Steven Tyler was in the hospital when she gave birth.\n\nWe are yet to get to swoon over his face, but the little pic of his tiny hand and the announcement of his name will fulfil us for now.\n\nWhat do you think of the baby name, Sailor?\n\nWant more? Try:\n\n\"Congratulations are in order for Liv Tyler.\""
