        "text": "As fabulous as Brooklyn has become, indie movie megastar and new mom Liv Tyler isn't moving across the East River.\n\nEven so, the rock heiress was tempted enough to tour a luxurious Brooklyn Heights townhouse that first made headlines when it hit the market with a whopping $20 million price tag nearly a year ago, sources said.\n\nSince then, the asking price on the stunning Columbia Heights home with views of lower Manhattan and the Statue of Liberty from each of its five floors has dropped - to a still eye-popping $14.5 million.\n\nIt remains by far the borough's highest-priced home - and is now being marketed by real estate brokers as a \"mansion ... for the discerning buyer who either: loves Brooklyn Heights or cannot find a home they love in Manhattan.\"\n\nWhen Tyler visited before Christmas, the home was listed at $16 million.\n\n\"She did not make a bid,\" said one well-placed real estate source. \"It's a pretty formal house. I can't see that.\"\n\nTyler lives in Manhattan's West Village with her husband, Royston Langdon, of the rock band Spacehog, and their 15-month-old son, Milo.\n\nThe \"Lord of the Rings\" actress did not respond to inquiries on her Brooklyn real estate stop.\n\nThe house, which was off the market for several weeks while the owners hunted for a new broker, was relisted at the lower price last weekend.\n\nThe current owner declined comment on Tyler's tour - or the drop in the sale price of the 8,000-square-foot, gut-renovated home the family bought for $2 million in 1999.\n\nShe said she had received several offers, but she said she turned them down. \"We are not always in the mood to sell,\" she said.\n\nManhattan Corcoran broker Deanna Kory said she recommended a lower asking price.\n\n\"We came up with a price to get people to come and look from Manhattan,\" she said.\n\nThe target buyer: a CEO of a Fortune 500 company, said Realtor Karen Kelley, who works with Kory.\n\n\"The buyer is likely to be a Wall Street executive,\" she said.\n\nTyler wouldn't be the first major movie star to move to Brooklyn. Jennifer Connelly, a native of the borough, and her husband, Paul Bettany, share a home in Park Slope."
