        "text": "Sad news today from the world of celebrity marriages, as a rep for Liv Tyler has confirmed to OK! that the actress and her British rocker husband, Royston Langdon, have decided to go their separate ways.\n\n\"They remain good friends and devoted parents to their son Milo and are requesting that their family's privacy be respected at this time,\" read the statement released by the Lord of the Rings star's publicist. No specific reason was given for the split.\n\nWeeks ago, Liv was photographed house hunting in NYC's West Village, sparking rumors that she was moving out of the couple's townhome. On Monday, speculation reached its peak at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute Gala in NYC, when Liv arrived alone and posed for photographs without her wedding ring on.\n\nYhe daughter of rock legend Steven Tyler of Aerosmith is reported to have told friends that she and Langdon married too young."
