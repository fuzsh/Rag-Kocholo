Actress Liv Tyler has split from British rocker Royston Langdon of the British band Spacehog, after five years of marriage.

Tyler, who may be best known for portraying elf princess Arwen in the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy, wed Langdon at a ceremony in the Caribbean in 2003. Their son, Milo, was born in December 2004.

"Liv Tyler and Royston Langdon have confirmed their separation. They remain good friends and devoted parents to their son Milo and are requesting that their family's privacy be respected at this time," said a statement released to People.com on Friday.

The 30-year-old model and actor is the daughter of Aerosmith frontman Steven Tyler.

She met Langdon, 36, while he was with the band Spacehog. He now fronts new group Arckid.

The musician, born in Leeds, and Tyler lived in the Yorkshire region of central England. Tyler was sometimes spotted drinking in local pubs and shopping at the supermarkets in the area.

The actress will next be seen in action blockbuster The Incredible Hulk, due to be released next month.
