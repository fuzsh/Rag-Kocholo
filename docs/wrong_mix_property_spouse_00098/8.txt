Days after Liv Tyler showed up sans wedding ring at the Met Costume Institute gala, our worst suspicions are confirmed. Liv Tyler has split from husband Royston Langdon. The actress, 30, married the 36-year-old rocker (formerly of Spacehog, currently of something called Arckid) in 2003, and they have a 3-year-old son named Milo.

“Liv Tyler and Royston Langdon have confirmed their separation,” says the actress’ rep. “They remain good friends and devoted parents to their son, Milo, and are requesting that their family’s privacy be respected at this time.”

A source tells usmagazine.com that the actress was recently overheard seeking advice from a lawyer on the phone. “In the conversation, she complained about her husband being a ‘leech’ on her assets, and she said she got married too young,” the source tells Us.

Tyler was quoted in 2004 as saying, “I don’t believe in divorce.” Us also offers a counterintuitive slideshow featuring spring splits, if you’re interested. —Noelle Hancock
