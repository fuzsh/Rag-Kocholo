Made to be airborne — and already ordered for two advanced new missile systems — these avionic units are based on radically new circuitry with no moving parts, no tubes or other glassware, no components of questionable reliability. Naturally, they are smaller and lighter than conventional devices. They are also more efficient, longer lasting and simply foolproof. Read the descriptions. Then, let us show you how to slice them to your requirements. AC VOLTAGE REGULATOR— Provides constant voltage output for alternating current source ±1% over ±10% changes in input voltage, and zero to 100% load changes. 95% efficient. Less than 2% waveform distortion. Can be provided for single, two or three-phase, power to 3 KVA for any frequency — 60 cps to 1600 cps. Temperature range: —54 deg. C. to +125 deg. C. Response time: less than 50 milliseconds. Typical example: 450 VA, 3 phase average sensing unit that weighs 5.5 pounds and has volume of 75 cubic inches. DC tO DC POWER SUPPLY (DYNASTAT)- Output available from 5 to 15,000 volts with power output to 2 KW and voltage regulation to 0.1% over much of this range. 70% efficiency. Input 28V D.C. 10%. Temperature range: —54 deg. C. to +71 deg. C. for high power units, and to +120 deg. C. for lower powers. Producing Controls for Every Basic Airborne System BURBANK, CALIFORNIA Anti-Skid Braking Systems • Fuel System Controls ■ Pneumatic Controls • Actuation Systems Electronic Devices HIGH TEMPERATURES Key to Missile Performance by John V. Long, Director of Research, Solar Aircraft Company High temperature presents a formidable barrier to the ad- vancement of missile technology. Present defense requirements call for temperatures ranging from — 460F to way beyond the limits of known material capabilities. New and planned developments in atomic power and space flight will mean temperature levels far out- side of man's current experience. The temperatures encountered in missile development produce startling phenomena. They are part of today's problems— affecting the very concept of the new generation of high- Mach aircraft and missiles. Laboratory experi- ments have produced temperatures in the million degree range. Nuclear fission and fusion reactions produce temperatures even higher. In the all out attack on the thermal barrier, scientists and material researchers are probing the four corners of the periodic table. The goal is to develop a practical solution to the thermal problem. The highest melting material reported is a combination of the carbides of tantalum and hafnium. Its melting point is about 7200E Dif- ficulty of fabrication, however, precludes its use in present day applications. And 7200F is at the cold end of the high temperature spectrum. It is obvious, then, that a solution to the mate- rials problem cannot be based on melting point alone. Man will never beat the thermal thicket by hitting it head on. Success will come only when he has devised new methods of ingen- iously avoiding it. There is an immediate need for a combi- nation of materials and designs which will withstand temperatures of 2000F in jet engines —and at least 20,000F for re-entry vehicles. In an all-out effort to satisfy some needs, materials researchers are re-evaluating available elements, combinations and processes. New techniques including vacuum metallurgy, zone refining, powder metallurgy, dispersion harden- ing and others are providing improved metals and alloys. Molybdenum, tantalum, rhenium and tungsten show promise because of their high melting points. But no known material has the refractory property or structural integrity to withstand the temperatures that will be encountered in tomorrow's \"hotspeed\" aircraft and missiles. Extreme temperature resist- ance is not just a materials prob- lem, but a problem of interaction between environment and the material of the vehicle. Designers must look at the system as a whole and design \"around\" high temper- ature problems. The use of heat sinks, ablation and transpiration cooling are partial solutions. Additional improvements will come with more research. For the present we must learn to use avail- able materials and, through design, provide the balance of the solution. We have by no means exhausted present material capabilities. Researchers must continue to refine and extend the high temperature performance of a variety of materials. A comprehensive knowledge of both metals and non-metals and their physical characteris- tics in extreme environments is necessary for successful applications. The ability to fabricate useful structures is obviously a major criterion. Best results will be obtained through a materials systems concept. This involves close coordination among raw materials suppliers, users, materials engineers, designers, test engi- neers, fabrication specialists and quality, control engineers. The team effort must be enthusiastic— and it must be dedicated to ultimate success through hard work. Solar's capabilities are centered in a team of experts experienced in the many sciences related to missile and systems technology — from basic design to highly precise experimental, prototype and volume production. This backlog of experience is available for your important missile program. For information, write to Dept. F-58, Solar Aircraft Company, San Diego 12, California.

The tremendous glare of publicity in which U.S. missile experts must work while the nation tries to catch up with Russia in the race for space has brought much serious criticism of the nation's press. Why must the U.S. advertise its failures to the world; why must it lose face in the eyes of its allies and potential supporters, and by the same token, strengthen the Russian claims that their system can out- produce a free economy? Isn't the insatiable curiosity of the U.S. press due for curbing, on the ground it injures national policy and prestige? This kind of criticism — unfortunately coming sometimes from in- telligent and highly-placed individuals — concerns us greatly. This pub- lication has an even greater interest in such publicity than does the general press. And like all members of a free press, it has an obligation beyond that to its own specialist readers: A duty to keep the general public informed on matters in which m/r has special competence. The facts and the reasons should be clear in everyone's mind: True, the Russians do not announce their failures, only their successes. But it is also true that Mr. Kruschev's captive taxpayers and servile press have no right to know the truth — and no means of obtaining it. But the right to know the truth, and the equal right to know what's being done with taxpayers' money are vital to the conduct of a demo- cratic form of government. More, the right to criticize, to demand an accounting from any official — no matter how high his position — are more than rights, they are duties. And the public press — asking ques- tions for, and speaking for the ordinary citizen — must assume these duties. The business press, such as ourselves, must add still another duty: If the science of missilery, for a specific case in point, is to advance, its practitioners must know at once what has been done, what concepts were involved, and what happened. It is of course a sad thing that the whole world is told of our plans and — in the event of an attempt at a moon shot — of our failure. But it is also vitally important that our own citizens know of our plans, and also know that there is no magic button called \"American know-how\" that can be pushed. It is of equal importance that our scientists and technicians know as much as possible about why the failure occurred, so that they can see to it that it does not happen again. contents news columns IAF Meets In Amsterdam *\"duustry Countdown 7 , _ .

AMERICAN AVIATION PUBLICATIONS WORLD'S LARGEST AVIATION PUBLISHERS N.W. missiles and rockets, September I, the missile week INDUSTRY COUNTDOWN GOVERNMENT DOD control of security continues to tighten with the announcement that Security Review Branch, Office of Information Services, USAF has been abolished and its functions transferred to Murray Snyder's Office of Security Review . . . Because of the fear that rising costs will force the elimination of \"at least\" one major weapons system from the Air Force program and pos- sible changes in Navy plans, the Pentagon is busily engaged in a major reprogramming for FY 1959 . . . Newest of ARDC's 22 liaison offices has been opened at the Naval Explosive Ord- nance Disposal Technical Center, Indian Head, Maryland. The center is the primary R&D loca- tion for Army, AF, and Navy in providing techniques and devices for making safe and disposing of all types of explosive ordnance materials . . . On orders of the Assistant Secretary of Defense, Research and Engineering, the Defense Metals Information Center has been established at Batelle Memorial Institute in Columbus, Ohio. In addition to government agencies, defense contractors and other suppliers may use the services of the Center, which will collect and disseminate information on titanium, beryllium, refractory metals, high strength alloys for high temperature application, corrosion and oxidation resistant coatings and thermal protection systems. Information will be made available to the general public through OTS, Commerce Department . . . Two bills (H.R. 8711 and H.R. 8948), under study by the House Armed Services Investigation Subcommittee, will be presented to the 86th Congress. Both propose amendments to the procurement act and are a partial result of hearings held by the subcommittee in July. EXPANSIONS Lear Inc. broke ground for its 172,800 sq. ft. plant to be used for manufacture and assembly of missile sub-systems including gyro platforms for the Bomarc and Nike-Zeus, and servo control units for the Sergeant. Completion is scheduled for May, 1959 . . . Utah Governor George Clyde and Lt. Gen. C. S. Irvine witnessed opening ceremonies for Litton Industries' new 60,000 sq. ft. tube plant.

Epsco Inc., of Boston opened a new West Coast division. To be known as Epsco-West, the new division will design, produce and market the Epsco data processing and control systems . . . Ford Motor Company's Aeronutronic Systems Inc. started construction on a 115,000 sq. ft. com- puter development facility in Newport Beach, Calif. Occupancy is scheduled for August of next year . . . The Branch Mfg. Co. division of General Bronze Corp. announced the expansion of its magnetics program to include the manufacture of magnetic amplifiers and systems . . . North American Aviation has formed Aero-Space Laboratories at its Missile Division. Creative research will be the principal function of the new unit. One of the first steps to be taken will be to set up a satellite information center for analyzing data and publishing significant findings . . . United Aircraft is seeking rezoning of a 206-acre tract in Greenwich. Conn, for consolidation of it's recently acquired Norden Division. PROJECTS Project Squid, started over 12 years ago by the Office of Naval Research and managed by Princeton University, has expanded its work in propulsion basic research to include space pro- pulsion . . . Los Angeles division of North American has been awarded a contract by the Fire- stone Missile Division for the manufacture of stabilizing fins for the Corporal. NAA will produce the metal honeycomb fins at Torrance, Calif. . . . The first military procurement of packaged liquid rocket engines was awarded recently to Reaction Motors division of Thiokol. The engine, which is an integral unit including propellant tankage, thrust chamber and all necessary components for operation, is said to be for an air-to-air missile (most likely Sparrow III) because of its small size. RMI is working on other size packages for future missiles of all sizes. Great advantage is that none of liquid's high thrust is lost even though engine can be stored in the same manner as a solid-propellant . . . Polaris mockups will be tested in a sort of \"reverse slingshot\" being con- structed by U.S. Steel at the San Francisco Naval Shipyard.

(Plants at Azusa and near Sacramento, Calif.) missiles and rockets, September I, I9E the missile week WASHINGTON COUNTDOWN Despite persistent rumors to the contrary, neither Boeing nor the Martin Bell team has the edge in the competition to nail down the Dyna-Soar program. Though Boeing frequently has been reported out in front, the large amount of Air Force money spent with Bell in such work, and the broad background of the Martin/Bell team, cannot be discounted. The dual effort points up the recommendations of the House Committee on Government Operations, which recently reported in favor of controlled parallel effort in the preliminary stages of such projects. And then there is always the possibility that the Air Force will decide to choose the better elements from each team and start on the R&D cycle with a completely reshuffled new team, comprising partners from both the old teams. In any case, when the program shakes out, don't look for any drastic reductions in any one team member's efforts. The time will then be about nigh for the inevitable follow-on to Dyna-Soar. With the recent lunar probe failure and half- announced plans for September and October attempts, moon gazers are almost all looking to the Air Force. However, don't discount the Army. Last week, a top Army spokesman told m r that the Army is prepared now to carry out any schedule of moon probes called for. Rumors around town were placing the earliest date for an Army try as sometime in October, but recently, the date has been upped to December. The Committee for Economic Development has published a pamphlet called \"The Prob- lem of National Security — Some Economic and Administrative Aspects.\" The committee, headed by James F. Brownlee, New York investment banker, analyzes the current threat to U.S. security. It makes some pretty strong recommendations: Total dollars for defense should be sufficient to limit the choices between various types of military and other programs; a sharp distinction should be made between what people are willing to spend for defense and what they are able to spend without weakening the economy; the whole weapons system concept needs a new look, and choices should be made on the basis of more information and more systematic investigation; R&D procurement practices should be revamped to give contractors more discretion; and efficiency should be increased in defense management. The pamphlet goes into somewhat greater detail about each of the broad recommenda- tions. Essentially it recommends an end to the normal \"business as usual\" philosophy. Speaking of weapons system concepts, the House Armed Services (Rep. Hebert-D-La.) Investigation Subcommittee will hold hearings, probably in November, on \"soaring costs\" in- volved in this area. Specifically, the probe will dig into the relationships between prime and sub-contractors and the \"team\" concept of sharing weapons development, although Congres- sional spokesmen say that all phases will be explored. Also due for inspection is the subject of government-owned machine tools for private industry. Emphasis here will be on methods of inventory and dissemination of inventory. And you can depend on the Hebert group taking a much longer look at the utilization of a large number of ordnance and other unused government plants to prevent construction of duplicate new facilities for private contractors. Sort of a follow-on to the Indian Head (Md.) Naval powder factory probe that the committee conducted last month. The charge was that Navy paid Aerojet-General several millions of dollars for solid-propellant production facili- ties, while ignoring its own plant, which had large-grain capability. Aerojet, by the way, was exonerated. nissiles and rockets, September I, 1958 9 Sedov: Man In Space Is Next Soviet Goal * Academy of World Astronautics Proposed * Confusion Mars Biggest International Space Meet By Erik Bergaust AMSTERDAM — To put man in space soon is the Soviet's immediate goal. Dr. L. I. Sedov (see cover picture) and K. F. Ogorotinikov told mr/r editors here during the ninth International Astronautical Federation Congress. Biggest Russian delegation ever to attend an IAF Congress was made up of top Soviet astronautical scientists. It included: Academician L. I. Sedov, chair- man; Dr. K. F. Ogorotinikov, Professor V. I. Krassovsky, Dr. V. G. Kostomarov, delegation secretary. Also attending from the Soviet union were four Moscow science teachers (see box). The Russian delegation, which swept in from Moscow in a plush TU- 104 jet, was the center of interest from the large world press group covering the IAF meeting. In an exclusive interview with m/r, Professor Ogorotinikov, famous Lenin- grad astronomer, said: \"We are push- ing the man in space program hard. This is the big thing; we are making fine progress. The re-entry problem has been solved.\" Asked whether the Soviet space at- tempt would involve a live animal or a recoverable satellite, the Russian delegate said such a deed \"would be part of the program.\" Considerable confusion resulted from contradictory stories in the vari- ous press reports emanating from Amsterdam about Russia's moon rocket program. One such story quoted Dr. Sedov as saying: \"We are going to wait for the result of American experience on a moon rocket. Time will show how long we are prepared to wait.\" Another report, based on \"reliable Top m/r Coverage For IAF Congress The Ninth Congress of the International Astronautical Con- gress was attended by two m/r editors, two of its staff of con- tributing editors, and three mem- bers of the publication's Editorial Advisory Board. On hand in Amsterdam last week were: Erik Bergaust, editor; Anthony Vandyk, European Director; Frederick C. Durant III and Dr. Hubertus Strughold, columnists and contributing edi- tors; Dr. Wernher von Braun, Dr. Eugene Saenger and Robert P. Havilland, editorial advisory board members. Russian sources in Amsterdam\" indi- cated that \"the communist will hit the moon any day.\" But in an interview, Dr. Sedov told m/r editors: \"These newspapers inter- views make me sick. Why not wait until after our next shoot?\" Ogorotinikov said, \"Why boast now? Why not wait until after we have accomplished something?\" The Russian delegates were con- stantly trailed by newsmen and photog- raphers, but said little or nothing about their space program. Dr. Sedov added that he had been \"somewhat\" misquoted in m/r at the last IAF congress in Barcelona, when this magazine reported that Russia was putting full emphasis on a full fledged moon rocket program. \"This,\" Dr. Sedov said, \"is only part of our story.\" Dr. Sedov was offered the presi- dency of the IAF for 1959, but said he would rather wait a couple of years. • U.S. has top group — The atten- tion the Russian delegation com- manded, however, obscured the very high caliber of the U.S. delegation. Not only was the U.S. quantitively. the best represented nation at the IAF. but qualitywise was undoubtedly tops. Among the most prominent Americans were ARPA's chief, Roy W. Johnson, Dr. Herbert York, Dr. Theodore Von Kantian, Dr. Joseph Kaplan, Dr. Richard Porter, Dr. S. Fred Singer. Dr. Hubertus S. Rughold, Robert P. Havilland, and Dr. Fred L. Whipple. Observers agreed that the quality of the American papers presented at the Amsterdam session was higher than those given at last year's IAF congress in Barcelona. It was clear, however, that security consideration had weak- ened the U.S. contribution. •Confusion reigns — Despite the fact that nearly all the delegates planned to use some of the time in Europe to visit the British Airshow in Farnbor- ough, some took time out from the Amsterdam sessions to make sight-see- ing trips to Brussels and the World Fair, and IAF officials were much con- cerned that participants might not ap- pear at sessions. Like most of the previous IAF Congresses the Amsterdam meeting was dominated by confusion and frus- tration as far as the organizational and business-meeting aspects was con- cerned. Despite tremendous effort from IAF and Andrew G. Haley, the meet- ing was a flop from the press view- point. There was no coordination with the press and no reprints of papers available. Many top reporters, who had traveled thousands of miles to attend the meeting, left after a couple of days in disgust. Delegates, too, complained bitterly about the organization or lack thereof. Above all, interpretation facili- ties were lacking, and for the vast majority of the delegates who were not linguists, much of the value of the sessions was lost. \"The IAF must realize that the world is changing, and the IAF must change with it,\" one prominent U.S. delegate told m/r. • Block school proposal — President Andrew G. Haley told m/r he is fully aware of the need to update IAF to take account of the tremendous devel- Von Braun Injury Causes Concern The U.S.' Dr. Wernher von Braun found himself accused — through no fault of his own — of \"sabotaging\" a meeting of the Amsterdam IAF meeting, when he failed to deliver a scheduled paper, or to appear at a swank reception given by the City of Amsterdam at the Rijksmuseum. Reason was a painful one: Van Braun fell in his room, while bending to pick up a paper from the floor. Physicians believe he suffered a slipped spinal disc in the accident. Well enough to talk to m/r, though obviously in pain, he smiled at the talk his absence had occasioned. And he added a point of great interest: \"As everyone knows, we tried to keep it a big secret. But we (Army) will try our moon-shoot in October.\" 10 missiles and rockets, September I, 1958 Memo to: U.S. Educators Pointing up the Russian space flight education plan was the presence at the IAF Congress of four educators as members of the eight-man Russian delegation. They were: Dr. P. V. Pshenichsy, Dr. V. V. Zlaoga, Dr. V. Y. Likhusin and Dr. P. V. Sporojenko. Their presence lent point to the fact that no other nation is pushing education in space flight. Dr. K. F. Ogorotinikov told m/ r that the Academy of Sciences is establishing a new university in Siberia. Part of the new unit's work will be in astronautics. Dpments in Astronautics that have taken place in recent years, but he is having \"a hard time\" carrying through these changes because of the short- sightedness of certain delegations. Sweden's delegates, for example, were doing their utmost to block Haley's proposal for the establishment Df an International Academy of Astro- nautics. This would be a research in- stitute charged with the task of achiev- ing space flight for non-military pur- poses. The Swedes turned their thumbs down in this idea because they were ifraid that international astronautical research would be concentrated in one :ountry, rather than be spread all over lie world. Haley's concept of an Astro- nautical Academy, however, does not :all for any concentration. The British are also against the idea >f an Academy, because they consider liat IAF is not economically capable >f carrying on such an ambitious proj- 3Ct. However, Haley told m/r the \\cademy has been assured the back- ng of many of the world's most im- jortant astronautical nations, including lie Soviet Union. • New task for IAF — The extent of which IAF is achieving heightened stature is reflected in the fact that the International Radio Consultative Com- mittee of the International Telecom- munications Union has agreed to in- vestigate an IAF proposal concerning the allocation of frequencies to space- :ircling vehicles and related problems. These six points are to be studied by the committee: 1) What frequencies are especially suitable for penetration of the layers of the earth's atmosphere? 2) What are the influences on these frequencies of the hour of the day, season, the geographical location and solar activities. 3) What deviation in propagation direction can be expected by the pene- tration of the ionosphere? 4) What — if any — will be the dif- ferences in propagation between in- going and outgoing signals relative to the earth? 5) Are special phenomena to be ex- pected that do not occur in transmis- sion between two points on earth? 6) What is the possible influence of the trophosphere on wave propagation to and from extraterrestial objects? • Propaganda war — During the IAF congress m/r learned that the Russians are planning to give 500 satellite tracking telescopes to foreign countries, including Argentina and Poland, to encourage the advancement of astronautics. The Soviet give-away- program undoubtedly will be accom- panied by maximum propaganda once it gets underway. The United States has a program to counter this Soviet hand-out-scheme, m/r established in Amsterdam. How- ever, red tape has bogged down the American program, which calls for handing out some 400 satellite track- ing telescopes. \"Washington has a heavy responsibility for this duty in a program where time is of utmost im- portance,\" one U.S. delegate said. New member societies admitted to IAF during the Amsterdam meeting were from the following countries: Japan, Canada, Nationalist China (after the Soviet delegation had tried to block it), Greece, Israel and Bulgaria. India, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia were given status (further details of the IAF congress will appear in the Sept. 8 issue of m/r). British Setting Up First IRBM Units The first British IRBM unit has been set up by the Royal Air Force. A squadron of the Bomber Command will get its first mis- siles shortly, according to in- formation at the Amsterdam IAF meeting. First activity for this unit, to be commanded by Group Captain F. A. Wilan, will be to improve test installation, and train personnel. USAF technical personnel will be attached to the British unit during the train- ing period. Four Members Added To Senate Space Committee Four senators — Margaret Chase Smith (R-Me.), Carl Hayden (D- Ariz.), Robert S. Kerr (D-Okla.), Jacob K. Javits (R-N.Y.) won places on the Senate Space Committee, bring- ing total membership to 15, and assur- ing permanent status for the com- mittee. Other members of the Committee are: Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson (D-Tex.), chairman; Sens. Richard B. Russell (D-Ga.); Theodore F. Green (D-R. I.); Warren G. Magnuson (D-Wash.); Clinton O. Anderson (D-N.M.); Stuart Symington (D-Mo.); Styles Bridges (R-N.H.); Leverett Salton- stall (R-Mass.); Alexander Wiley (R- Wis.); John W. Bricker (R-Ohio); Bourke B. Hickenlooper (R-Iowa). Hydrogen Fusion Engine Development Underway Vancouver, B.C. — Research aimed at developing a fusion engine, which some scientists have theorized could provide power for a space flight through the entire solar system, was described here last week at a meeting of the American Physical Society. Nicholas Christofilos, physicist at the University of California Radiation Laboratory, Livermore, described the construction of an Astron — a device being developed to test a new approach to the generation of the monuclear power. The experimental Astron, being built at UCRL, will use relativistic (high energy) electrons of an energy of 3,000,000 (3-mev) electron volts to test the theoretical principles. As part of the AFC's Sherwood Project, the Astron is not expected to produce power itself, but eventually to produce low cost energy from the fusion of hydrogen nucleus. Urey Appointed Member of Space Science Board Berkeley, Calif. — Dr. Harold C. Urey, University of California, has been named a member of a 16-man Space Science Board which will \"sur- vey the scientific problems, opportu- nities and implications of man's ad- vance into space,\" the National Acad- emy Science has announced. Dr. Urey will head the committee on the Geochemistry of Space and Exploration of the Moon and Planets. The work of the new board will be coordinated with the National Aero- nautics and Space Administration, the National Science Foundation ARPA and other appropriate organizations. missiles and rockets, September I, 1958 II Foreign Missiles in the News SWEDISH Type 304 air-to-surface missile mounted under aircraft wing. Granskad Tillystyrkes SWEDISH Type 315 naval surface-to-surface missile ready for launching. Armstrong -Whitworth A FOUR-BOOST propulsion test vehicle for Seaslug ship-to-air missile. I 12 Sweden . . . Sweden is equipping its Saab-32 Lansen all-weather attack aircraft with a recently-developed missile, the Type 304. A rocket-powered air-to-surface missile, the 304 is reported to utilize all-weather guidance. The missile was developed by the Swedish Guided Weapons Bureau, and is being pro- duced by the Swedish Air Force's pro- duction facilities, as well as by civil subcontractors. The Lansen is armed with two of the type 304 missiles, and the combina- tion is said to comprise one of Sweden's best weapons systems. The 304 has been under development in Sweden since 1950. and the first flight test of its structural components was con- ducted in 1954. Initial tests of the complete weapon began in February, 1955. Another defense missile unveiled by Sweden is the type 315, a naval surface-to-surface missile for use from destroyers. The 315 is a jet-powered missile using four built-in booster rockets, but information released did not specify the type of jet engine as a, sustainer. Australia . . . A new Australian anti-tank missile, named Malkara, has been ordered by the British government. The radio- controlled SSM weighs 200 pounds. Australia has sent 30 Malkaras toj Britain for acceptance tests. The Brit- ish production order involves the sup- ply of 150 of the missiles. The unit price of the Malkara is about $60,000. England The latest version of the Armstrong- Whitworth Seaslug surface-to-air naval missile uses a solid-fuel sustainer rocket, instead of the previously employed bi- propellant system with nitric acid. A Seaslug propulsion test vehicle with four booster rockets will be shown at the Society of British Aircraft Con- structors' Show at Farnborough in the first week of September. The Seaslug was developed by Armstrong-Whitworth in association with the following companies: E.M.I. Engineering Development; General Electric Co.; Sir George Godfrey and Partners; Imperial Chemical Industries; McMichael Radio; Metropolitan-Vick- ers; The Sperry Gyroscope Co.; John Thompson Conveyor Co.; Vickers- Armstrongs (Aircraft). missiles and rockets, September I, 1958: Earth to Moon in 80 Hours? A manned vehicle will make the trip around the moon in 80 hours, possibly as early as 1963. That's the conclusion of D. M. Cole and D. E. Muir of The Martin Company's Denver Division, in a paper presented at the American Astronauti- cal Society meeting held recently at Palo Alto, Calif. Cole and Muir see several ways in which the project could be approached, with practically the same hardware as would be used in a manned orbital flight, which would precede the cir- cumlunar flight. One method would use six to eight booster rockets to carry extra propul- sion stages into orbit, to a rendezvous with the manned vehicle so that it would be able to make the longer trip. An alternate method would use rocket stages in a cluster to make a single large booster, which would be combined with the orbital rocket and space cabin to make up the circumlunar configuration. This method would require a theo- retical three-stage rocket with stages weighing 160,000, 40,000 and 10.000 lbs., scaled up by a factor of four to make a larger, also theoretical, rocket. The four first stages would be clustered to a common engine of 1.25 million pounds of thrust and a single first stage would make the second stage on the larger rocket. The third stage of the big rocket would be a second stage from the smaller. With such a vehicle, Cole and Muir estimate that the payload can be 20,- 300 lbs. Total weight would be 859,000 lbs and the thrust/ weight ratio would ae 1.45. • Computer does figuring — A num- Jer of orbits were programmed for an IBM 704 computer, and from these, rip time was calculated as a function )f initial velocity. The accuracy requirement was bund not to be as stringent as is usu- illy thought. Actually, an uncorrected rajectory with an error no greater han plus or minus six minutes of arc s adequate. This did not take in ac- :ount the fact that, on a manned trip, :orrections could be made in flight vith small expenditures of propellant. The first leg of the 80-hour trip it- «If would take the form of a nearly ectilinear hyperbola from the earth to he sphere of influence around the noon, and would consume 35.35 lours. The second leg, a hyperbola tround the moon, would take 9.3 lours and the return leg, identical to he first, would again be 35.35 hours, naking the 80-hour total. Cole and Muir see the desirability of making the approach to the moon's surface as close as possible, since the effect of the moon's gravity in bending the orbit back toward the antiparallel to the incoming leg will be greater for closer approaches. The closer the ap- proach, the higher the initial velocity which can be used and the shorter the flight time. An altitude of ten miles is sug- gested for the second leg, with the velocity at perilune 13,720 ft/ sec for the 80-hour trip. Re-entry would be accomplished by pilotage, and the control fins of the vehicle would provide sufficient aerody- namic control to permit landing in the desired area of the earth. The Martin engineers sound a som- ber note in conclusion by saying that development trends indicate that Rus- sia may already have structures on the moon when the U.S. vehicle orbits for its first close glimpse. However, they indicate that since Russia will almost certainly make deep space flights before the U.S., our ob- jective should be to accelerate our space efforts, with a manned trip to the moon as our specific purpose. Speedup Scheduled For Lacrosse and Bullpup Orlando — Navy, anxious to get Bullpup into the operational hands of carrier and shore-based tactical aircraft, has ordered a production speed up from 30 missiles per month to 600. Army is changing production of its field artillery Lacrosse from 15 to nearly 280 per month. The speedup will mean an around-the-clock production schedule for Martin Co.'s Florida Division. The Air Force is also entering the Bullpup program, with the award of a new research and development pro- gram to Martin — aimed at giving Tactical Air Command and NATO na- tions improved air-to-ground missile at- tack capability. Air Force, which has been in on some early testing of Bullpup, plans to use the 10-foot 550-pound missile on its F-100, F-101 and possibly, the F-105. However, Air Force wants in- ternal stowage, radar acquisition of target and possibly a voice command or infra-red guidance system. Production of the missile under the^ planned Air Force program will greatly exceed the Navy program, and can be expected to cut production costs from the present $5,000 per bird. NACA to Spend $19.5 Million at Wallops The National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics has announced details of its $19.5 million capital expansion program for the Wallops Island, Va., rocket research station. Two launching areas, with a block- house between them to serve both sites, will be constructed at a cost of $4.68 million. The launching pads will be con- nected to the blockhouse by a conduit system to handle communications and firing circuit lines. The blockhouse will be 40 x 60 ft., constructed of heavily- reinforced concrete, and covered with protective sand. It will be provided with blastproof doors and blastproof peri- scopes for viewing operations in the launching areas. Extensive tests will be made of hydrogen-flourine combina- tions. The pads will have a rocket launcher, umbilical tower, and a mov- able service tower for loading and final check of guidance control and research instrumentation. Rocket fuel and oxidizers will be handled by tank trailers provided by contractors, who will make deliveries as needed — eliminating the necessity for maintaining large liquid storage tanks and pumping equipment. The 3,200-acre island, used for the past 13 years, is five miles long and one mile wide. Only 800 acres are suitable for use in rocket operations; the remainder is marshland. A 20-ft. wide causeway over the marsh area connecting the island with the mainland is proposed. A 20-minute boat ride is now required to transport personnel and materials. NACA, nucleus of the new National Aeronautics and Space Administration, hopes to acquire some 1,000 acres on the mainland. This land would be used for buildings and facilities — including antenna for long-range radio inter- ferometer, radar, and telemetering equipment. New mainland buildings planned include a two-story administrative and range control facility; a two-story model assembly and reliability check labora- tory, and a one-story technical service structure. Acquisition of approximately 800 acres of Assawoman Island — adjacent and southwest of Wallops Island, is re- quired to provide space for the loca- tion of tracking sites and telemeter stations suitably removed from the Wallops launching area. Facilities at Assowoman Island would be designed for tracking instrumented models in flight after launching, and for recording scientific data relayed from the test models. nissiles and rockets, September I, 1958 13 Wide World Congress Racks Up Record Missile Legislation • $39.6 Billion for DOD Use • Small Business Relief Okayed * NASA Funds Set at $80 Million • Reshuffle Strengthens R&D by Erica Cromley Congress headed for home last week, after scaling a mountain of legislation that has been termed by some Capitol Hill veterans the most impressive and significant of the past quarter century. The defense industries — directly or indirectly affected by much of this year's Congressional package — could be happy with most of the legislation. Taking on the space challenge, Congress established the first civilian space agency, gave the President $39.6 billion for defense — $815 million more than he asked for — and the go-ahead to reorganize the Defense Department. Congress also provided funds for loans to promote science education. The lawgivers also passed a host of bills designed to: create more jobs, aid depressed areas, give small busi- ness a shot in the arm, and liberalize social security benefits. • Space legislation — Members of the Senate and House Space Com- mittees clearly were not on solid ground when they tackled their first space problem: the \"what,\" \"who\" and \"how\" to set up a government agency to direct U.S. civilian space activities. House and Senate hearings dragged on for weeks, as top government and in- dustry scientists gave lawgivers a short course in space technology and advice. Both sides of Congress differed over the top organizational setup, finally compromised on a nine-member council under direction of the Presi- dent. The council will be composed of the Secretary of State, Secretary of Defense, the administrator of the new agency, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, one additional member from the government and three members from industry. Among the council's duties are to advise the President, and to develop \"a compre- hensive program of aeronautical and space activities.\" The new National Aeronautics and Space Administration, unlike the National Advisory Com- mittee for Aeronautics, on which it is based, can negotiate contracts. Congress voted $80 million to get the National Aeronautics and Space Administration into orbit. This is to cover: research and development ($50 million) construction and equipment ($25 million) salaries ($5 million). In addition NASA will receive NACA's $101 million 1959 funds, and another $117 million which will be transferred from the Department of Defense. The legislators slipped a rider into two appropriation bills, which requires NASA to get new authorization for funds each year, in addition to getting appropriation approyal through the legislative mill. Rider proponents finally settled for authorization approval for next year only. Meanwhile, the Senate moved quickly to confirm nomination of the two-man team named by the President to run the new space organi- zation— Thomas Keith Glennan, di-; rector, and Dr. Hugh Dryden, deputy. • Defense appropriations — The tone of urgency in the fact of the new Soviet threat permeated the session from the first day. The $38-billion defense ceiling was lifted and the $1.26 billion emergency appropriations for the development of missiles, air detection devices and bomber facilities asked by the Presi- dent, were quickly approved. The whopping $39.6 billion defense appropriation set a peacetime high. It' caused some bitter controversy: Demo- crats claimed the Administration was* scrimping on research and defense: efforts and that as a result, develop- ment of new missiles was impeded. Republicans countered with the charge: that Democrats were belittling Ameri- can military achievements to make political hay for the November elec- tion campaigns. The new money bill emerged from the Senate-House Conference meeting with $1,193 billion more than the 14 missiles and rockets, September I, 1958 Puzzle: What's Meaning of Spending Limit Law? One of the least understood and most controversial of this year's laws is the bill enabling the President to propose an annual dollar spending limit for each agency. The measure, HR 8002, originally grew out of Hoover Commission pro- posals aimed at returning unused funds to the Treasury, and giving the Budget Bureau and Congress control over the rate of expenditures. However, the amendment-riddled measure that emerged was in such diluted form as to be scarcely recog- nizable. Under it, the Senate and House Appropriations Committees can ignore the President's spending recommendations, which gave rise to the charge that the bill created no more authority than already existed. (The Defense Department, during hearings on the measure, estimated it would have to hire from 5,000 to 7,000 additional clerical employes if the bill became law.) Provisions include: permission of fund transfer within an agency to retain flexibility for long leadtime weapons development; assurance that defense contractors will be paid for deliveries by permitting funds to be drawn from years other than those covered by the annual limitation, if this is necessary. Exactly how or if it will work, remains to be seen. House had approved and $440 million less than the Senate. Total for the three services were $17,877 billion for the Air Force, $11,359 billion for the Navy and $8,993 billion for the Army. Advanced Research Projects Agency (military space projects) was given a little over half a billion dollars of DOD's funds. Increases approved included $638 million for four more Polaris subma- rines, missiles and equipment for a total of nine authorized; $90 million for acceleration of the Minuteman ICBM program, which includes $15 million for research and development; $48 million for the Hound Dog air-to- ground B 52 missile; Army moderniza- tion funds of $37 million for missiles and equipment, to which the Senate added $14 million. (The Department of Defense re- cently revealed that programmed ob- ligations for 1959 missile procurement, construction and research and develop- ment total $6,596 billion, compared to $5,107 billion in Fiscal 1958 (m/r August-11, p. 12). This includes those ship and aircraft costs directly asso- ciated with missiles, but does not in- clude missile operation and main- tenance costs, or military pay.) Although the Congressional mood was to add to any item with a defense tag, it turned economy minded when it hit the military construction bill. The President asked for $1.73 billion; got $1.35 billion. • Small Business legislation — The small businessman got a lot of Con- gressional attention this year. One bill, which gave the five-year- old Small Business Administration permanent status, also raised the in- dividual loan ceiling from $250,000 to $350,000 and dropped the interest rate from 6% to 5'/2%. Another bill authorizes establish- ment of local small business investment corporations with a revolving fund of $250 million to make equity-type capital and long-term credit more easily available. To qualify for a charter, these investment companies, formed by at least 10 persons, must have a minimum capital and surplus of $300,000, half of which they can get from SBA. Loans would be lim- ited to not more than 20% of a bor- rower's capital. Small business also came in for $260 million in tax relief, included in a compromise bill which provides for a vast technical overhaul of the income tax law. Although it does not change the tax rate for small enterprises, the measure permits reduction of taxable income through deduction of a larger percentage of the cost of machinery and equipment for depreciation in the year of purchase. It permits a first- year depreciation allowance equal to 20% of the cost of investment outlays up to $10,000. The tax law also allows business — small or large — to get retroactive tax refunds for three previous years as a result of operating losses. Formerly a loss could be carried back only to the two preceding taxable years. Included is an increase in the allowable accumu- lated earnings from $60,000 to $100,- 000 before a corporation may be sub- ject to the accumulated earnings tax. Another break for small business was a bill modifying certain U.S. pro- curement practices to help the small man get a fair share of government business. It put a new ceiling of $2,500 on open-market purchases for procure- ment without formal advertising. • Defense reorganization — Imple- mentation of the changes under the Defense Reorganization Act will be gradual. Prime aim is to strengthen and clarify the authority of the Secre- tary of Defense. For one thing, the measure puts the six unified defense commands directly under him, through the Joint Chiefs of Staff, instead of having each responsible to one of the military departments. Assistant secretaries have been cut from eight to seven, with the post of Assistant Secretary of Defense Re- search, Engineering, to be upped to that of Director of RE. He will super- vise, manage and direct all DOD re- search programs of the Advanced Re- search Projects Agency and the Office of the Director of Guided Missiles. Only the Director of Research, En- gineering and to some extent the As- sistant Secretary of Defense (Comp- troller) will be able to deal directly with the Army, Navy and Air Force. • Other action — Other Congres- sional action: — grants semi-permanent emergency contract powers to the Pentagon, simi- lar to those of the expired Title II of the War Powers Act, including an in- surance provision for otherwise non- insurable defense contract risks, author- ization of certain advance payment amendments or modification of con- tracts on an emergency basis. — extends for two years the gov- ernment's power to set priorities for defense contracts, exempt cooperating defense contractors from anti-trust laws, authorize defense loans, and pro- vide an emergency standby supply of trained executives for wartime posts. ■ — authorizes an additional $3.3 bil- lion for mutual security. — authorizes $888 million over a four year period to stimulate science and engineering education. — extends Renegotiation Act for six months. Small Business Gets Added Tax Breaks In its efforts to aid small business, Congress further eased tax obliga- tions with bills which would. — permit certain small corpora- tions having ten or less stockholders to be taxed as partnerships, thereby gaining a possible lower tax rate — allow the new small business investment corporations exemption from any taxes on dividend income received from investments in small business regardless of whether they pay it out to their own stockholders; permit them to charge off their capi- tal losses against ordinary income which is subject to a higher income tax; allow an investor in a small business investment corporation to take an ordinary loss instead of a capital loss in connection with the worthlessness or loss from the sale of stock in these corporations. missiles and rockets, September I, 1958 15 1958 EDITION FULLY REVISED WHO'S WHO IN WORLD AVIATION, only reference volume of its kind in the world, will soon be ready in a new edition containing over 3,000 biographical entries: key officials in airlines, aircraft and engine companies and related industries, distinguished air officers and civil pilots, scientists, writers, government officials, legislators, and others playing a significant role in world aviation.

Zaehringer Radiation definitely affects stability of hydrocarbon fuels. Tests on kerosene, gasoline, jet and petroleum rocket fuels with gamma and neutron bombardment indicate: increase in density and viscosity, decrease in hydro- gen content, and the evolution of gas. Studies such as these are needed to determine optimum working fluids for atomic rockets. Liquid ammonia is fuel for X-15 rocket plane. LOX will be oxidant. NACA calculates theoretical Isp of this combination at stoichiometric as 249 sec. Volume performance is 210 lb-sec/ cu. ft. This is one of the first major applications of ammonia as a rocket fuel in the U.S. It also marks one of the first uses of a liquefied gas as a fuel material. Low cost and high availability were other selection parameters. Long run ramjet static test of a Marquardt engine at Naval Ordnance Aerophysics Lab at Daingerfield, Texas was equivalent to a non-stop flight three times around the world at an altitude of over 70,000 ft. Conducted at high supersonic speeds, the ramjet has already chalked up a total run time equal to a flight five times around the world. Super pressures and temperatures may result in new propellants and motor materials. Research at Brigham Young University indicates that attainment of pressures of 3 million psi and temperatures of 5,000°F are possible and may result in the attainment of new physical and chemical properties for many elements and compounds. Gas-producing cartridges for feeding liquid propellants have been de- scribed by the Vernon Laboratories of France. The solids are based on urea, urea nitrate, hexamethylene tetramine, ammonium nitrate, and am- monium hydrophosphite to produce a reducing gas, or with ammonium per- sulfate. to yield a non-reducing gas. Low cost epoxies for solids may be possible with Mod-Epox introduced by Monsanto. The viscosity modifier, based on an organophosphorous compound, could allow the incorporation of higher oxidizer or exotic fuel loadings. Phosphorous improves stability — particularly thermal properties vital under high temperatures and long term storage. Reichold Chemicals, too, is entering the epoxy field and may mean higher interest in epoxy fuel-binders. The reactive epoxide group offers not only a way to form cross-linked polymers, but might also allow the introduction of exotic boron compounds directly into the molecule. Another way of attaching the borohydrides to epoxies would seem to lie in the use of Callery's amine- boranes to act as curing catalysts. Future solid propellants will be a cross between today's homogeneous and composite propellants. So indicates Allegany Ballistics Lab. In homo- geneous propellants, borons or metals may be added as discrete particles or in the form of molecular substitutions. For composites, more oxidizing power will be needed to take advantage of metals addition; this may come in the form of organic monopropellant materials. Thus, homogeneous propellants will have composite components while composites will resemble the homogeneous solids. Safety with boron fuels may result from studies at Rensselaer. Hard to handle pentaborane can be inhibited from explosion by the addition of iron carbonyl. New diborane process developed at Germany's Max Planck Institute for Coal Research uses boron trioxide and an aluminum alkyl. Trialkyl borane formed is reduced with hydrogen to give diborane. U.S. processes use halogen intermediates. Engineer Survey Reports Career Motivations Engineers would rather do engi- neering work, but feel there are more rewards to be gained by moving into jobs outside their technical specializa- tion. This is one of the findings of a national survey of 1,500 engineers by Deutsch and Shea, Inc., technical man- power consultants. More than 80% of the engineers responding to the survey felt that the greatest opportunities for advancement were outside of technical specialization. Sixty-five percent believed that admin- istrative work offered greater opportu- nities, and 17% felt that more oppor- tunities were available in the sales field. However, only 42% of these en- gineers said they would be interested in leaving technical work if the salaries and opportunities in engineering were equal to those in administration and sales. Davis Appointed New R&D Deputy Commander at ARDC Maj. Gen. Leighton I. Davis, Air Force pilot, engineer, inventor and teacher, recently reported to Air Re- search and Development Command (ARDC) headquarters as Deputy Com- mander for Research and Develop- ment. Gen. Davis's new position places him in control of scientific exploration programs and equipment development projects for the Air Force. This re- quires coordinating the efforts of Air Force and civilian scientists, and the work accomplished by numerous uni- versity and private industrial research firms. Gen. Davis returns to ARDC after serving four years as commander of the Air Force Missile Development Center (AFMDC), Holloman Air Force Base, N.M. Prior to this assignment, he was ARDC's Director of Develop- ment, Baltimore, Md.

Legal questions on property rights on the moon and planets, and of our relations to probable existing inhabitants, can wait until we acquire more knowledge. These were the conclusions heard recently at a jointly-sponsored meeting of the Air Research and Development Command, Institute of Aeronautical Sciences and American Rocket Society. San Diego. Speakers included Dr. Theodore von Karman, a member of NATO's advisory group for aeronau- tical research, and Dr. Donald L. Michael, Dunlap & Associates. An agency for space administra- tion might be a solution, according to Dr. Michael, if there is an increased trend to outlaw space missilery. Such a trend could result in an international impasse similar to that of atomic weap- ons. However, an agency could be further complicated by smaller nations who want a part in anything of inter- national significance. This, in turn, can result in pressure groups and complex power politics. If the UN should bear the costs of an international space program, it Missile Shaker THE 44-FT. FIRST STAGE of the Vanguard rocket is being inserted into the test tower at Martin Co., preliminary to undergoing a \"shake\" test. This test, which uses the round wire coils as \"ears,\" is used to conduct a ground resonance survey. These coils are used in recording informations during a test, through the use of strain guages and other devices. to Who Rules Space would still be costly to individual na- tions because there would be no mili- tary cost decrease — it would merely be added on. • Technical aspects — Dr. George A. Hoffman of the Rand Corp., created considerable interest with a paper on the properties of \"whiskers\" — fine crys- tal filaments with phenomenal strength, in some cases approaching the theoreti- cal limit of atomic cohesion. Hoffman said this high strength was due to a phe- nomena of strength increase in a crys- tal as its dimensions decrease, and is quite general in materials. \"Whisker\" materials could be woven into cables or formed into sheets with almost in- credible results in tensile stress and modulus of elasticity. However, Dr. Hoffman estimated, \"it will take about two generations to de- velop a material made from whiskers.\" With the current accent on \"shots to the moon,\" much interest was gen- erated by another Rand Corp. scientist, H. A. Lieske, in his paper on \"Circum- lunar Trajectories.\" Describing possible free-flight tra- jectories of a moon rocket, Lieske em- phasized the dependence of trajectory on burnout velocity of the final stage. The paper covered possible circumlunar trajectories from the classical \"figure eight\" orbit to distorted ellipses. Typi- cal round trip flights would probably vary from 6 to 10 days, depending upon initial velocity of the rocket and the distance of closest approach to the moon. Thermonuclear reaction power plants offer the most interesting possi- bilities if the basic problem of con- trolling the reaction can be solved, ac- cording to Dr. M. R. Clauser, director of Physical Research Lab, Space Tech- nology Laboratories. \"There seems to be no further funda- mental obstacle that would preclude its use for propulsion,\" Dr. Clauser stated. Other methods being investigated, he said, are an ion rocket for use after a vehicle had been put in orbit about 200 miles above the earth, and a sys- tem of nuclear energy using the fission reaction. To accomplish a velocity of 40,000 ft. per sec, as required to en- circle Mars, Dr. Clauser said this would would probably require development of an exotic propellant rocket motor — possibly utilizing a hydrogen-fluorine combination or a fission rocket motor. • Launch to planets — Krafft A. Ehricke, Convair-Astronautics, said that there will be only four periods in the next ten years, each about 90 days long, when it will be possible to launch in- strumented \"comets\" towards Mars and Enemy Imitator NEEDLE-NOSE Kingfisher, the Army's new target missile built by the Lockheed Missile Systems division, can portray enemy attackers to provide a realistic test of U.S. missile-age defenses. A radar target augmentation device in the bird simulates high-flying hostile planes or mis- siles, and a Lockheed-developed firing error indicator records theoretical hits. Venus. Modified versions of ICBMs in current development could be used. Launches towards Mars could be made during a three-month period be- ginning in August 1960; other launches could be made during like periods be- ginning September 1962, November 1964 and December 1966. Six favorable periods will be avail- able for sending instruments towards Venus, but they will last only two weeks each. These will be in June 1959; January 1961; August 1962; March 1964; October 1965; and June 1967. Ehricke also urged an early start towards such projects — \"since our com- petitors won't wait for us.\" North American Aviation Highlights SAC Operation A comprehensive roundup of Stra- tegic Air Command operations is fea- tured in the current issue of North American Aviation's publication, Sky- line.

Designed to carry big wallop — British Army paratrooper tires a close-range guided rocket missile designed as an anti-tank weapon. By Raymond M. Nolan Slated to make its appearance in the U.S. soon is the Vickers 891 anti- tank guided weapon system (m/r August 25, p. 37 — see photo). The 891 is an Infantry anti-tank weapon which can be carried, set up and fired by one man without any special technical skill. Probably the smallest portable weapon of its type, it is a simple and powerful missile which will give an infantryman a good chance against even the heaviest tank. Its only counterpart in the free world today is the French S10 and Sll series, sometimes called the \"suitcase weapon.\" However, the French missiles are some- what heavier than the 891. The Vickers system is actually a two-part weapon: the missile contained in a portable launching canister or in a bag complete with launching stand, and the control device with which the operator generates the command sig- nals. No additional computing gear is required. • Guidance — The missile is guided by means of a simple optical line-of- sight command system. Before firing, a cable is pulled out from the container and plugged into the controller unit. Steering is by a thumb-operated stick which the operator uses to bring the missile onto the line of sight of the target. The absence of any electronic or other parts in the wire-guidance sys- tem which require warming-up make the launching sequence very rapid. Command is exercised by changes in later velocity. As the operator moves the control stick, the velocity with which the missile crosses his line of sight is changed. Commands are trans- mitted by a wire-wound spool attached to the rear end of the missile and en- circling the rocket motor nozzle. Power comes either from batteries or a small turbo-generator. The body has a conical nose fitted with a contact probe. The main body sections and the pressure vessel for the motor are aluminum alloy. The four wings carry trailing edge control sur- faces and plastic shells reinforced with glass cloth, and are filled with foam plastic. The two detachable fairings, lying between the wings, are also of rein- forced molded plastic. They are easily replaceable and serve the twin purpose of housing the electronic components of the control system and providing means of interconnecting equipment at either end of the rocket motor. The solid fuel motor has a remov- able igniter which is screwed into posi- tion just before firing. A flare is also installed to give the operator an assist in visual tracking. •Launching — The missile container becomes the launcher with the removal of a rubber plug and ring in the rear- end support pad. The container lid folds down and becomes the supporting member to achieve the 20 degree firing angle for the missile. Angle of elevation is varied by propping up the rear end. The canister is about 15 in. square and 37 in. long. It weighs from 33 to 45 pounds, complete with missile, de- pending on shock protection. The mis- sile itself is 33 in. long, with a body diameter of 4.5 in. and an 1 1 in. wing- span. Vickers designed the 891 with a one-man launching team in mind. The missile is light enough to be carried, accurate enough to be effective at either end of its range, and rugged enough to be transported by jeep or helicopter, or dropped by parachute. Recent rumors that an American manufacturer would produce the mis- sile have not yet been confirmed, but m/r has learned from sources in Washington that the 891 will be in competition with the Dart at an early date. Arma Sales Drop, Merger With Northrop Considered Sales, profits and earnings on com- mon stock of the American Bosch Arma Corp. for the first six months of this year are considerably below those for the same period last year, the com- pany announced. Sales for the first half of this year were $57.7 million with a net income after taxes of $1.6, as compared with sales for the same period last year totaling $69 million with a profit of $2.9. Earnings on common stock, after provision for preferred stock dividends, were 85 cents per share as compared with $1.56 last year. The lower profits were a result of a 25% reduction in commercial products billings, accord- ing to the company. Arma reported that several meet- ings have been held with officials of Northrop Aircraft, Inc., Hawthorne, Calif., to discuss the possibility of a merger. No agreement has been reached, but talks are continuing. AGN Scientists Seek Man-in-Space Answers San Ramon, Calif. — Scientists at aero- jet-General Corp.'s Nucleonics subsidi- ary are convinced it is possible to build a protective capsule to take man safely through the bands of radiation into space. Protection against natural and man- made radiation hazards is one of the space radiation research staffs main projects. Dr. Robert P. Geckler, AGN biolo- gist, said that bone marrow injections may be used to counteract the effects of low level radiation. Radiation pro- tective suits have been discounted as too cumbersive and restrictive. Scientists at Nucleonics are hopeful that the first successful lunar probe may reveal a minimum zone of radia- tion with comparatively radiation-free escape paths. They also feel that some day man will find a way to utilize the energy of the radiation belt's charged particles. Most of AGN's work is channeled into the production of the Poly Pool educational and research reactor — a miniature version of the bulk shielding reactor at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. missiles and rockets, September I, 1958 19 Missiles . . .

Medaris — Com- manding General of the Army's Ordnance Missile Command — has undertaken to outline for readers the extreme care, and reasons for care taken by the Army to insure proper design and functioning of what have proved to be some of the nation's most reliable missiles. Reliability — the positive assurance that the weapon will function effec- tively whenever required is the key- stone of the Army's rocket and missile program. The Army demands that reliability be achieved during the research and development phase of each weapon system, through a vigorous program of design, test and analysis. It is main- tained during the production phase by a stringent quality assurance and quality control program. The objective is to assure that exist- ing and future weapons systems con- tinuously perform their intended func- tions in the natural and induced en- vironments in which they must operate. Within each major element of the Army Ordnance Missile Command there is a group responsible for a reliability program for each research and development project. These pro- grams are tailored to specific require- ments. All are regularly monitored to insure adherence to Command policy. A staff element is assigned this re- sponsibility and also evaluates policy to determine that it is consistent with the most advanced state of the art of rocket development. • Considerations — Five basic con- siderations enter into all reliability programs in the Command: 1. Definition of the reliability ob- jective in each case. 2. Determination of total environ- mental conditions and design param- eters throughout the life of the weapon system. 3. An intensive laboratory testing program and a companion flight test program to determine modes of failure, level of failure and test-to-failure. 4. Comparison of reliability test results to determine that adequate safety margins exist in the design, to insure that the probabilities are biased in favor of the system. 5. Establish quality assurance pro- cedures which will insure conformity to the inherent reliability designed into the system. • Results — The enhanced reliability of various Army-developed missile sys- tems demonstrates improved reliability design. An outstanding example is the Redstone Ballistic Missile System. Here a high degree of reliability was inher- ent in the research and development and production phases. The system's reliability has been demonstrated under semi-arctic and semi-desert conditions, and most con- vincingly by the tactical firings con- ducted by the 40th Field Artillery Mis- sile Group (Heavy)— the first launch- ings of a large ballistic missile by U.S. troops. In the Jupiter Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile System, being devel- oped for operational employment by the Air Force, a Noteworthy degree of joint Army-contractor participation has been achieved in the resolution of reliability problems. Perhaps the most striking evidence of this success has been the two re- coveries of full-scale Jupiter nose cones with the assistance of the U.S. Navy. The recoveries established that Jupiter's inertial guidance system can deliver a warhead accurately to its target over the approximate full range of the weapon, and that the Army can protect the warhead from the aerodynamic heating encountered by an object re- entering earth's atmosphere. • Cone recovery story — Behind the headlines reporting the nose-cone re- coveries is an efficiently organized re- search and development project in which the reliability philosophy has been carefully integrated. Analysis, studies and test of aero- dynamic stresses, structural designs and material composition guided the selec- tion process. Finally prototype nose cones were developed and tested, first in wind tunnels to measure aerody- namic stability and then in the path of rocket engine jets to measure resist- ance to excessive temperatures. Because of advances in reliability planning, programming and engineer- ing, and the proper balance of labora- tory and flight testing, the Jupiter Sys- tem is expected to surpass Redstone in reliable performance. How exhaustive the flight testing has been may be gauged from the average of 230 individual measure- Maj. Gen. J. B. Medaris ments obtained in flight on each test Redstone. Approximately the same number is derived from each Jupiter test launching. Each of the measure- ments is related to specific areas of investigation required by the missions of the individual missiles. Another example of Army-industry cooperation in reliability concerns the Nike-Ajax surface-to-air system. A quality assurance program was initiated in mid-1953 under Army Ordnance Auspices with the Bell Telephone Laboratories. This provided for a series I of product evaluations, quality surveys j and implementation of standard quality ] assurance procedures. An overall in- crease in system reliability of 12% I was achieved. Better producibility as well as enhanced reliability resulted. • How it's done — A continuing pro- cess of evaluation, review, analysis and i corrective action is carried on. As J a part of this standardization, programs seek to increase the use of interchange- able parts among the various systems. An important element in determining the need for an incorporation of de- 1 sign changes is extensive use of elec- tronic data processing. Product Improvement Committees made up of members of Army-Industry missile system teams, and representa- tives of the combat arms which use the weapons coordinate the review and analysis effort. Their recommendations go to the mission agency responsible for final action. Ordnance Evaluation Laboratory facilities have been provided in the 22 missiles and rockets, September I, 1958 major elements of the Command to provide more effective control of prime contractors in the reliability effort. These laboratories verify design param- eters, monitor contractor reliability achievements by means of independent testing, and contribute to advancing the state of the art. An engineering concept review is conducted within six months after initiation of the project. Then the de- sign agency presents to all interested elements, including the user, the mili- tary characteristics of the weapon de- sign schedule industrial plan, field sup- port plan, and training plan. Design engineering review is con- ducted as soon as basic design decisions have determined the physical charac- teristics of the system and detailed design of hardware is underway. Mock- ups and some hardware are employed to explain the status of design to in- terested elements, and future planning is outlined. This makes possible early initiation of industrial and mainte- nance engineering and instructor train- ing. Engineering design inspection takes place when the design is far advanced and industrial engineering is proceed- ing on the overall system. Develop- ment-type hardware is employed as test prototype. The design agency portrays the status of industrial engineering and the supply and training agencies re- port their progress. Engineer user test schedules are discussed. Production design inspection is scheduled when industrial engineering is well advanced and procurement is in progress. Now the complete system is demonstrated, utilizing the first pro- duction type hardware. No change in engineering design is acceptable, except as a result of the evaluation firings, and only when the change will effect signif- icant improvement in the use of the system by troops. Any other desirable improvements are included after de- livery of the first system of tactical design suitable for deployment. The final review action, known as Special Coordinating Inspection, may be scheduled by the coordinating agency whenever it is considered neces- sary. By introducing the reliability con- cept into every phase of the army's missile and rocket programs, we bring the weapon to the field confident that it will perform efficiently. Our constant purpose is to arm our troops with the best possible means by which to ac- complish their objectives. missiles and rockets, September I, 1958 Explorer V In Ocean Grave? By Norman L. Baker As m/r went to press, the rate of the Explorer V satellite was still shrouded in mystery. Speculation is that the satellite met the same fate as Explorer II, which fell into the ocean shortly after launch- ing. All four stages of the Jupiter-C rocket carrier are reported to have fired without achieving the proper angle of launch. The brevity of the satellite's radio transmission, received at Fort Monmouth, indicates that the final stages fired in a nose-down attitude, with the satellite landing several hun- dred miles from the Cape Canaveral launching site. Explorer V, originally scheduled for flight at 2:30 A.M. on August 21, but delayed for three days due to a faulty valve, was designed to supplement the experiments of Explorer IV. The time of launch was calculated to put the satellite in orbit on the opposite side of the earth from Explorer IV. Assigned to obtain additional data on the corpuscular radiation belt, the opposed positions of the two satellites would have furnished simultaneous readings and would have recorded any changes in intensity levels. Explorer V was one-half pound heavier than IV as the result of heavier shielding for the counters. Explorer IV has one of its counters shielded by lead one-sixteenth of an inch thick, while Explorer V, with similar instru- mentation, was equipped with shield- ing 3/16 or an inch in thickness. According to Brig. Gen. John Bar- clay, commander of ABMA, Explorer V would have attempted to determine the nature of the radiation— whether the particles are electrons or protons. If the particles of the belt are electrons, the highest intensity recorded would be about ten roentgens an hour. If the particles are protons, this in- tensity would be about 100 roentgens an hour. (AEC has recommended 0.3 roentgens per week as a maximum safe human exposure.) As a result of Explorer IV measure- ments, it is now known that from 250 miles to the satellite's apogee of 1,300 miles, the intensity level of the belt doubles every 60 miles. At the apogee, the intensity is so high that no differ- ence was recorded in the readings of the shielded and unshielded counters. • Radiation belt — Prof. Fred Singer, at the 9th Annual Congress of the International Astronautical Federation held last week in Amsterdam, (see p. 10), advanced the theory that the particles in the radiation belt were pro- tons. This reasoning is based on the fact that when primary cosmic rays smash into the earth's atmosphere and disintegrate the atmospheric Nucleus, most of the neutrons released travel upward and out of the earth's magnetic field in straight lines. Some of these neutrons, when traveling through the magnetic field, change into protons and immediately begin to spiral around the magnetic lines of force. Singer stated that the lifetime of the protons is so long that the trapped particles start concentrating at 600 miles. The lifetime of the particles is in- versely related to the density of the atmosphere. Therefore the decrease in density with an increase in altitude increases the lifetime of the particles. Singer theorizes that a maximum con- centration is reached at the equator at about IV2 earth radius, or 6,000 miles, where the intensity drops. At about 10 earth radius, he be- lieves the radiation belt ends gradually. The intensity is known to decrease with higher latitudes, with a complete absence at the poles. • Answers — Singer proposed three possible solutions to radiation hazard: A vehicle could be equipped with a \"shadow\" shielding ring. Based on the theory that trapped particles spiral mainly at right angles to the line of force, and are therefore incident mainly perpendicular to the line of force, the ring would be sufficient for trapping the particles. Another method, based on the fact that the incident radiation is in the direction perpendicular to the line of force, would employ a coil positioned around the space station with its axis parallel to the line of force. The coil would create a small-scale dipole field, providing a magnetic screen that would turn away the radiation bombardment. The most novel proposal suggested the use of \"sweeper\" satellites for cleaning a channel in the radiation belt. The satellites moving through the belt would absorb the protons, reducing the intensity to tolerable limits. This method would require several satellites having a large cross-sectional area. Prof. Singer's proposals are signif- icant in light of the shielding require- ments for a brute force approach to travel through the radiation belt. To reduce the energy of the trapped pro- tons to 10% would require a shell about 4 cm thick. To protect a sphere 12 feet in diameter would require over 10,000 lbs. of lead. 23 industry report missile business The growing trend toward team bidding for missile work — flagged in these columns months ago — gets a strong boost from Air Force Maj. Gen. William T. Thurman. director of procurement and production for Wright- Patterson. A circular over Gen. Thurman's name asks trade associations in the aircraft, electronics and similar industries to bring team bidding procedures to the attention of their members. An old story in some other fields — particularly construction, where con- tractor \"joint ventures\" have ranged to such mammoth ventures as Hoover Dam and the St. Lawrence Seaway— the concept of a team operation is a simple one: A group of firms put their special capabilities together to produce a single product more efficiently and economically than any in- dividual company could possibly do it. In missile production, where so many highly specialized pieces must be conceived, manufactured and put together, the concept is particularly valuable, thinks the Air Force. Biggest problem in team operation — once the contract is awarded — is in management. Automatically, there are a lot of potential bosses in such a combine. The solution, says Air Force, is a special management group set up specifically to handle the joint contract, keep down paperwork, keep up vital communications, generally ramrod the job. A management advisory board, chaired by an officer of the team leader, is usually the first step, backed by necessary staff. Air Force has also gone to some pains to reassure industry that the service won't pay for duplicate facilities or build its own, so long as it knows that sufficient capacity exists. \"Air Force funding (for industrial facility expansions) will be resorted to only when private capital is unavail- able . . . and program needs make government funding absolutely neces- sary,\" says AF's latest Industrial Newsletter. Additionally, AF sets up guidelines for contractors on management of their in-plant and subcontract dollars: (1) Procurement orders or re-orders involving government-owned facilities will be screened to insure that items requiring government facilities can't be obtained through private sources; (2) \"make-or-buy\" studies will be reviewed to assure maximum use of the defense industry's subcontract capability; (3) new facilities expenditures will be authorized only on an absolute minimum basis, in areas beyond research and development and pilot production; (4) existing AF industrial facilities will be disposed of wherever possible. The general business upturn — reflected in almost all barometers, both private and government — hasn't gone far enough yet to encourage real inflation-making moves in the way of drastic price rises, demands for big jumps in labor's pay, etc. But some Congressmen have already raised the cry of inflation and controls (witness Sen. Kefauver's threat to investigate the steel price increase). The Federal Reserve's move to raise the rediscount rate (in the San Francisco area, for one), is evidence that federal money managers are ready with moves to head off a too rapid rise. The \"Fed\" is taking a cautious view of the upturn however, pointing out that similar early strengthening of the economy was followed by mild reversals in 1949 and 1954. Certainly, the midyear financial reports in the past several weeks have shown a spotty picture for firms with heavy missile interests. Last week's crop, for instance, showed this picture: Curtiss-Wright Corp. said its second quarter consolidated net profit was $10.9 million for 1958. compared to $20.7 million a year ago; Zero Mfg. Co. reported a record first fiscal quarter, with sales of $797,517. compared to $675,536 a year ago. 24 contract awards LAST MINUTE AWARDS Boeing Airplane Co. gave Tele-Dy- namics Inc. a substantial contract to de- sign, develop, and manufacture a telem- etry system for use in the operational flight testing of the Bomarc ground-to- air missile.

Hunter In excess of $50 million in tax money is at stake in a hearing on the calendar of the California supreme court this fall. This is the accumulation of property tax payments made by defense contractors and held in escrow pending settlement of the litigation over legality of the tax. In dispute are \"possessory interests\" in government owned materials and work in process. A lower court ruled in favor of the industry in 1957 on two test suits filed jointly by Aerojet-General Corp. and the Pomona division of Convair. It is Los Angeles County's appeal from this decision that comes before the state high court in October. Meanwhile, Los Angeles, San Diego and Alameda counties continue to impose these tax assessments on government materials against the manu- facturing companies. Lockheed's total tax bill this year, for example, will add up to approximately $9.35 million. Of this, approximately $3.34 million will be protested as covering property not owned by Lockheed, but by the government. Another county, Ventura, decided not to wait for the supreme court's decision. North American Aviation will get a new tax bill this year on an assessment value of $1,946,960 for its \"possessory interest\" in govern- ment owned property at Rocketdyne's test facility in the Santa Susana Mountains. Background of the local tax trouble is lack of a California law. In World War II, when aircraft and other defense work boomed, county offi- cials were patriotic and agreed that government materials should not be taxed. But after the war, when the California population gain outran tax revenues, the counties found great need for the money. If the supreme court upholds the lower court's order, the counties will undoubtedly go to the legislature for a law. The defense industry may get a refund on the $50 million paid in, but the tax on missile and other defense materials will be back again just the same. Proposal writers for the prime manufacturers are now at work prepar- ing their bids for the biggest phase of the Minuteman program, the contract for assembly and test of the solid propellant ballistic missile. By prime manufacturers, we mean not only the large airframe companies, including all six on the West coast (Boeing, Convair, Douglas, Lockheed, North American and Northrop), but such companies as Bendix, Curtiss-Wright, General Electric and the big three of the automotive industry; Chrysler, Ford and General Motors. These are the companies which recently received invitations to bid from the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division. The con- tract may be let by Nov. 1"
