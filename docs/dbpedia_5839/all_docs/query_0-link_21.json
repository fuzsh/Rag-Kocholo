        "text": "Space\n\nWeather\n\nSun and EarthSWCE2 on Moon\n\nBelow is a checklist of Space Weather on postal items, in two sections.\n\nThe Stamps section features all known stamps, postal stationery and other selected philatelic items related to Space Weather. Subsidiary items (FDCs, maxicards, imperforates, \"specimen\" overprints, proofs, souvenir cards, folders, booklets, philatelic covers, color variations, etc) are all included. Also included are a variety of unofficial items (e.g. locals, cinderellas, illegal stamps, personalized postage, etc). Users can freely decide to accept or reject them for their own collections. Stamps from official postal authorities that have catalog numbers are identified in the Catalog Number column. Items whose catalog numbers are not known are entered as \"unknown\". The Type of Item column includes some philatelic details about the items.\n\nThe Launch Covers section features philatelic launch and event covers for satellite, rocket, and stratospheric balloon items related to Space Weather. In this section there are no catalog numbers to identify the launch and event covers. Rather, they are listed chronologically by cancel date, with a separate column for cancel location, followed by a Type of Item column which includes cachet details and identifies the satellite, rocket, or balloon in question.\n\nIn both sections, the Notes on Content column includes information about how the items relate to Space Weather. Text within quotation marks in the Notes refers to text found in the philatelic item. Also in the Notes (or rarely in other columns) are included occasional footnote references for subjects or terms that require more explanation. Those footnotes are found at the bottom of each section.\n\nIf readers know of additional information or images, please contact the authors using the e-mail addresses at the bottom of this page.\n\nIn this page, \"space weather\" is defined as the effects of solar energy in its various forms on the space environment, and more particularly the interactions between that energy and the near-Earth (magnetosphere and ionosphere) space environment. Sudden increases in solar activity can create \"storms\" of radiation and particles in space, which necessarily interact with the near-Earth environment when they reach it. These \"storms\" are of interest for several reasons:\n\nThey can be dangerous to life in space (e.g. astronauts in Earth orbit, or on the way to the Moon or Mars);\n\nThey can affect the functioning of satellites, or in extreme cases even damage their components;\n\nThey can disrupt radio and communications signals and GPS navigation;\n\nThey cause brilliant displays of the aurora, even to middle latitudes where they are not usually seen; and\n\nIn extreme cases, they can cause problems in electrical transmission grids, and pipelines, because of electrical currents induced at the ground.\n\nFor these reasons, it is important to observe space weather and to attempt to forecast it.\n\nThe solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, is a major component of space weather. The magnetosphere of a planet with a well-developed magnetic field, such as the Earth, protects the planet by deflecting the solar wind away from it (although some of the particles become trapped in areas known as the Van Allen radiation belts, and some also penetrate into the ionosphere where they form the aurora). A planet with no magnetic field (and therefore no magnetosphere) would have its atmosphere stripped away by the solar wind.\n\nIn the United States, since 1994 the National Space Weather Program (NSWP) has been the agency responsible for space weather services. It is a collaborative organization involving NASA and six other federal agencies. NASA contributes to the NSWP by investigating physical processes in the space environment: from Sun to Earth and to other planets of the solar system and beyond to interstellar space. This is done through remote sensing, in situ spaceflight missions and the development of computer numerical models that simulate the space environment.\n\nThe Stamps and Launch Covers sections feature philatelic items that contain one or more of the following Space Weather-related categories, through depictions or text or other references:\n\nThe magnetosphere and/or magnetic fields of Earth or other planets\n\nThe solar wind and/or its interactions with planetary magnetospheres and/or interplanetary space\n\nThe ionosphere or other upper atmospheric layers and/or reference to upper atmospheric propagation of wireless signals\n\nSpace weather, the space environment, plasma, solar/magnetic storms, charged particles, cosmic rays, neutrons\n\nRadiation hazards to manned or unmanned spaceflight, space weather hazards to people and technology on Earth or in the atmosphere\n\nSpace weather-related observations and forecasts (by satellites, rockets, stratospheric balloons, or other instruments and techniques)\n\nThe heliosphere, in a space weather context; items issued for the International Heliospheric Year are found in the authors' IHY page\n\nSolar activity (sunspots, prominences, solar flares4, coronal mass ejections9, the solar corona), solar observations or solar observatories. Other solar-related items are found in the authors' Solar Effects page\n\nDepictions of Earth's auroras or those of other planets viewed from space, or references to auroras in the general context of space weather or more specifically as part of the missions of scientific satellites, rockets, and balloons. Here is an example of an image of Earth's auroras taken from the ISS, and here is an example of an image of Earth's auroral ring around Antarctica taken by the DE-1 satellite (Explorer-62). Philatelic items depicting Earth's auroras seen from the ground are found in the authors' Auroras page. In this Space Weather page, green highlighting is used to identify postal items depicting auroras seen from space.\n\nIn the Stamps section, yellow highlighting is used to identify postal items showing the Solar Wind Composition Experiment (SWCE)2, most of which are based on a photo of Apollo-11 astronaut Aldrin setting up the experiment. The SWCE was deployed on the Moon during five Apollo missions (Apollo-11, 12, 14, 15, and 16). The goal of the SWCE was to sample and measure the solar wind at a location outside of Earth's magnetosphere. It provided the first accurate measurements of the He, Ne, and Ar isotopic components of the solar wind. The experiment consisted of a sheet of pure metal foil, 1-foot wide and 4.6 feet high, mounted on a pole inserted into the soil of the Moon's surface. The foil was exposed for various amounts of time in the different Apollo missions and was then stowed and returned to Earth for analysis. This photo shows Apollo-11 Astronaut Edwin Aldrin beside the mounted SWCE sheet; this photo shows a close view of the similar SWCE sheet from the Apollo-12 mission; this diagram provides a few details for the deployed sheet. Similarly, blue highlighting is used to identify postal items showing the Solar Wind Spectrometer (SWS)14.\n\nSome space weather-related research involves making Earth-based measurements of the ionosphere through the use of various types of large antennas or towers. Philatelic items that feature such structures are highlighted in pink in the stamps table below.\n\nThe Spaceflight Meteorology Group of the United States forecasts terrestrial weather for spaceflight launches and landings (but at the end of the Space Shuttle program, its operations were significantly scaled back). Since it concentrates on terrestrial weather, philatelic items that refer to it do not belong in this page. Rather, they are found in the National weather services page.\n\nLaunch covers\n\n(including anniversary-of-launch covers, and launch-related event covers)\n\n(farther below) Other postal items\n\n(stamps, souvenir sheets, aerogrammes, postal cards, etc.)\n\n(immediately below) Space weather\n\n(satellite-related) Space weather Space weather\n\n(sub-orbital rocket-related) Space weather\n\n(balloon-related)\n\nBelow is a list of Space weather on postal items (stamps, souvenir sheets, aerogrammes, postal cards, etc.).\n\nCountryCatalog NumberType of ItemYear of IssueNotes on Content Space Weather (on Stamps) Adzharia RepublicLocal1Czechoslovakia 1717 overprinted on 4x Russia 45207 (Mi4497), from strip of 5, also partial overprint template1994/5?Depiction of magnetosphere (and IK-3/5 type satellite) Adzharia RepublicLocal2Czechoslovakia 1717 overprinted on 4x Russia 57337 (Mi5904), from strip of 5, also partial overprint template Adzharia RepublicLocal3Czechoslovakia 1717 overprinted on 4x Russia 5984 (Mi6177), from strip of 5, also partial overprint template Adzharia RepublicLocal4Czechoslovakia 1717 overprinted on 4x Russia 6067A (Mi252), from strip of 5, also partial overprint template Afars and IssasC57 (Mi40)1980Ionospheric research tower in Arta, Djibouti Afars and IssasC57 dsDeluxe sheet (C57) Afars and IssasC57 fdc1Stamp and (text) cancel and (multi-color printed) cachet on FDC Afars and IssasC57 fdc2Stamp and (text) cancel and (Éditions J.F.) cachet on FDC AjmanBL328A\n\nBL328BOn stamp of SS1 (Mi1221A)\n\nOn stamp of imperforate SS1 (Mi1221B)1971Apollo-11 Astronaut Aldrin setting up the SWCE2 Ajman StateMi1268A\n\nMi1268B1971In the foreground, Apollo-15 SWS14 (Solar Wind Spectrometer), based on this photograph of astronaut David Scott deploying the Apollo-15 ALSEP (Apollo Lunar Surface Experiment Package) Ajman StateMi1268B dsImperforate deluxe sheet (Mi1268B) Andorra (French Admin.)171 sc (Mi197 sc)Souvenir card1966\"FR-1's orbital altitude of around 750 km was designed so that the satellite was constantly in the ionosphere, an upper atmospheric layer between 50 and 1000 km that reflects radio waves due to its strong electrical charge\" (in French text) Antigua and Barbuda1259 (Mi1295)1989Apollo-11 Astronaut Aldrin beside the SWCE2 Antigua and Barbuda1822a (Mi2041)One of MS6 (1822 (a-f)) (Mi2041-2046)1994Apollo-11 Astronaut Aldrin in front of the SWCE2;

These radars can measure the position and velocity of plasma irregularities in the Earth's ionosphere. The movements of those irregularities respond to energy coupled into the auroral regions from the solar wind and magnetosphere. Super DARN is therefore one source of information on how the Earth interacts with the space environment.\n\n2The Solar Wind Composition Experiment (SWCE) was deployed on the Moon during five Apollo missions (Apollo-11, 12, 14, 15, and 16). The goal of the SWCE was to sample and measure the solar wind at a location outside of Earth's magnetosphere. It provided the first accurate measurements of the He, Ne, and Ar isotopic components of the solar wind. The experiment consisted of a sheet of pure metal foil, 1-foot wide and 4.6 feet high, mounted on a pole inserted into the soil of the Moon's surface. The foil was exposed for various amounts of time in the different Apollo missions and was then stowed and returned to Earth for analysis. This photo shows Apollo-11 Astronaut Edwin Aldrin beside the mounted SWCE sheet; this photo shows a close view of the similar SWCE sheet from the Apollo-12 mission; this diagram provides a few details for the deployed sheet.\n\n3This item can also be consi"
