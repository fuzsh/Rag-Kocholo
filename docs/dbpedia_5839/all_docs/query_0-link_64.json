Sounding rockets continue to play an important role in space science despite the advent of satellites. While satellites can stay in space for long periods, sounding rockets are still needed to explore regions of the atmosphere too dense for satellites but too high for balloons. Sounding rockets can carry instruments to altitudes between 25-1000 miles, providing vertical profiles of the atmosphere and several minutes of observation time above it. Their advantages include low cost, simplicity, flexibility in location and timing of launches, and recoverability of payloads. However, their observation time is limited and they only provide localized coverage compared to satellites.",
