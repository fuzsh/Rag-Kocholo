The scientific program in- cluded mvestigations of the equatorial electrojet, ionospheric characteristics, atmospheric composition and density distribution, and meteorological conditions m the stratosphere and m the troposphere. Forty-five Nike-Apache rockets and 32 meteorological rockets were launched durmg the expedition. Ship-based obser- vations mcluded ionospheric soundmgs, airglow observations, and twilight Dodson ozone measurements. A complete launchmg site was mstalled on board the Croatan with nearly all of the launchmg control equipment moimted m seven equipment vans on the hangar deck. Twenty-two radio antennas, two Nike launchers, and two Arcus launchers were located on the flight deck and fantail. The vans mcluded Diesel engmes generatmg 500 kW of electrical power, telemetry, and mstrumentation and work- shops for the different experimenters. 142\n\nFig. 12.1 USNS Croatan (NA SA ). 143\n\nThe expedition was organized aroimd the scientific requirements for a latitude survey of the upper atmosphere during the period of low solar activity, and an ex- tensive mvestigation of the equatorial electrojet and the equatorial ionosphere. The staff of the Wallops Is land Rocket Range organized the expedition under the manage- ment of G . S . Brown, R . T . Long, andJ.W. Gray. Fig . 12.2 summarizes the route and laimch schedule. A brief description of the scientific experiments and some of the highlights of the results from the expeditions are given below. Shipboard Observations â Shipboard observmg mstruments mcluded: an lonosonde under the direction of Vern Peterson of ESSA which provided basic ionospheric data throughout the equatorial region, also cross-correlations with a i r - glow measurements; photometer for airglow observations of the 6300A and 5577A oxygen Imes, by J . A. Greenspan of the IIT Research Institute; a Dobson spectrom- eter, used to observe the total ozone by A . J . Krueger of the Naval Ordnance Test Station. The results of the airglow observations show the diurnal and latitude dependence of the airglow and, m particular, a maximum in the red Ime emission in the equator at the anti-solar direction. The ozone measurements have shown also a latitude dependence of total ozone content with a mmimum at S'S latitude, a small pertur- bation at 12Â°S latitude. A clear maximum at 47''S latitude was observed. The F - region ionosonde data correlate very well with the oxygen red Ime as shown by Barbier. Meteorological Observations â Lloyd Chamberlain of ESS A/Wallops Station and Larry Smith of Sandia Corporation, Sixteen Arcus rockets with sonde pay loads to measure temperature and winds, and seven Hasp rockets with chaff payloads for wmd measurements were fired almost daily during the expedition. Measurements were made with these rocket sondes of atmospheric temperature profiles and wind directions. These observations show a decrease in the altitude of the tropopause with increasing latitude. The tropopause near the equator was at a temperature of -84''C and an altitude of 16 km. The trend at higher southern latitudes shows a warming to -58Â°C and a lowering of tropopause to 9 km at 60Â°S. The latitude of the change in the wind directions from east to west was measured to an altitude of 50 km; it was found that the easterly components were present at all levels near the equator and gradually changed to westerly components, changing last at 35Â°S latitude at the 30 km altitude level. Only westerly components were observed at latitudes greater than 35\"S with a maximum speed observed at 60''S of 150 m/sec at 60 km altitude. Ozone Measurements â A . J . Krueger, Naval Ordnance Test Station. Seven Arcus rockets were launched to make ozone measurements with ultraviolet 144\n\nLAUNCH EXPEDITION ROUTE AND LAUNCH SCHEDULE BALBOA - EMBARK PASSENGERS A N D EQUIPMENT â¢ 1 ^ ><L , - T ^ â E Q U A D O R - V . , PERU \\ LIMA-EMBARK PASSENGERS A N D i EQUIPMENT, DEBARK, RETURN TO LIMA, DEPART FOR SOUTH PACIFIC 13 MAJOR ROCKET FLIGHTS SCHEDULED AS SHOWN LIMA \\ 10 20 30 TALCAHUANO-DEBARK PASSENGERS A N D SPECIFIED EQUIPMENT, SAIL FOR BALTIMORE, MARYLAND Fig. 12.2 Route and Launch Schedule of the Mobile Launch Expedition (NASA).\n\no o absorption of solar radiation and m the atmosphere at 2800A and 2950A Five usable profiles were obtamed at different latitudes. The peak of the ozone dis- tribution appears to be at 26 km, m some cases, a second peak m the distribution may exist. Atmospheric Structure with Pitot-Static Experiment â J . J . Horvath and G . R . Carignan (University of Michigan) and J , Theon (Goddard Space Flight Center), Eight Nike-Apache rockets were launched at latitude mtervals of about 15Â° from the equator to 60Â°S latitude, to measure the altitude distribution of pressure, temperature, and density of the upper atmosphere up to 120 km. At the equator, a diurnal pair of flights was made at local noon and at midnight. This method of measurmg atmospheric structure showed day-night variations and a latitude dependence. Air Density Distributions â W. Hansen (University of Michigan). Six Nike- Cajun rockets were launched, mcludmg two off the coast of Wallops Island and one near the equator to measure the atmospheric density profiles by the deceleration of a 2-meter diameter plastic sphere, tracked by the MPS-19 radar. The rollmg of the ship adversely affected the lockmg of the radar on the spheres, and the experi- ment could not be carried out successfully. Atmospheric Composition â E . J . Schaefer (University of Michigan). Four Nike-Apache rockets carried mass spectrometers of the Paul type for the measure- ment of the distribution of the neutral atmospheric constituents at latitudes near the equator and at eO'S latitude. Good measurements were obtamed m the equatorial region, but the high latitude measurements were unsuccessful. The distributions of atomic oxygen, molecular oxygen, argon, and molecular nitrogen measured from 100 to 150 km are very nearly the same as those obtamed at midlatitudes from Wallops Island, Ionospheric Electron Density Profiles â A . C . Aiken and L . J . BlumIe (Goddard) Space Flight Center), Six Nike-Appache rockets were launched to measure the electron density profiles both durmg the day and night m the altitude range from 90 to 200 km. The contmuous-wave propagation technique at 24 MHz and 73.6 MHz were used m conjunction with a Langmuir probe. The distributions of electron con- centration for four flights were very similar. The electron distribution at night m the equatorial region, however, appears to require the source of ionization at least durmg the late night period. D and E Region Aeronomy â S.A, Bowhill (University of Illmois) and L , G . Smith (GCA Corporation). Five Nike-Appache rockets were launched to obtain the electron density distribution m the D and E regions with the differential absorption Faraday rotational experiment of S .A, Bowhill, simultaneously with electron den- sity and electron temperature distribution obtamed with rf probes and ion traps. 146\n\nThe measurements of ultraviolet radiation at Ljmaan-Oi and at 145 OA were a means of measurmg the distribution of molecular oxygen. The results were ob- tained at the equator and at 16, 32, and 48\"'S magnetic latitudes. Rocket telemetry failed one time. Electron distributions were obtained to altitudes as low as 50 km. The southern hemisphere electron densities were lower m the region from 50 to 65 km compared to the northern hemisphere; while at 48Â°S magnetic, this \" C \" r e - gion was similar to the northern hemisphere, with a deep \"valley\" at 65 km alti- tude. A latitude dependence of molecular oxygen number densities was observed with molecular oxygen concentrations mcreasing with increasmg latitude near 90 km altitude. Equatorial Ionospheric Characteristics â R . C . Sagalyn and M. Smiddy (Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories). Two Nike-Cajun rockets carried mstruments for daytime and nighttime equatorial ionosphere measurements. A spherical electrostatic analyzer obtamed the charge density and temperature and energy distributions of the charged particles. Differences m the general shape of the daytime charged particle regions as compared to midlatitudes were observed m the altitude region from 100 to 110 km with a charge density about three times lower in the equator than at midlatitudes. The conductivity in the electrojet region shows a maximum of 8 x 10~^ amperes/m^ at an altitude of 103.5 km. The electron drift velocity was 2.7 km/sec, which is comparable with electrojet models. Equatorial Electrojet Latitude Survey â T . N . Davis (Goddard Space Flight Center and the University of Alaska) and K . Burrows and J . D . Stolarik (Goddard Space Flight Center), Eight Nike-Appache rockets were launched to measure mag- netic fields associated with the equatorial electrojet. Rubidium-vapor magnetom- eters were fired from 230 km north to 135 km south of the magnetic equator. Measurements were made of the total magnetic field change resulting from the electrojet current in the altitude range of 80-150 km. The lower boimdary of the electrojet was foimd to be between the altitudes of 92 and 96 km. The peak current density occurred m the region from 105 to 110 km and a current was still measur- able m the region near 140 km. The shape of the dependence of the electrojet with latitude was obtained. A current sheet with a thickness of 20 km and a lower edge near 105 km was observed durmg one flight; this gave a total field change of 30 gamma. A local midnight measurement mdicated the existence of barely detectable westward currents at the magnetic equator. S3 Currents Near the Equatorial Electrojet â N . C . Maynard and L . J . Cahill, J r . , (University of New Hampshire) launched four Nike-Apache rockets, to measure the magnetic field and electron density distribution with a nuclear free-precession magnetometer and a Langmuir probe. The change in the magnetic field during pas- sage through the current layer was about 120 gammasânearly twice the electrojet magnetic field variation observed in India. The maximum current was at an alti- tude of about 110 km and extended to an altitude of 135 km. In one case, two electric 147"
