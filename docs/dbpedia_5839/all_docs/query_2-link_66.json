        "text": "Mission: Historical reports: U.S.S.R.s Voskhod II, manned by pilot Col. Pave1 Belyayev and co-pilot Lt. Col. Aleksey Leonov, was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, TASS reported. The spacecraft set an altitude record, reaching an apogee of 495 km -higher than any manned spacecraft had flown.\n\nDuring the second orbit. Lt. Col. Leonov, clad in a spacesuit with autonomous life support system. stepped into space, moved about five meters from the spacecraft (tethered by a cable), and successfully carried out prescribed studies and observations: he examined the outer surface of the spacecraft; turned on a film camera; carried out visual observations of the Earth and outer space: took horizontal, vertical, and somersaulting positions; and returned safely to the spacecraft. TASS said: Outside the ship and after returning, Leonov feels well. He spent about 20 min. in conditions of outer space, including 10 min. free-floating in space. Entire procedure was carried out under control of Col. Belyayev, with whom continuous communication was maintained. A television camera fixed to the side of Voskhod II relayed pictures of the maneuver to Soviet ground stations.\n\nBiotelemetric data indicated that both cosmonauts had satisfactorily withstood the orbiting and the transition to weightlessness: the pulse rate of Belyayev and Leonov was 70-72 beats a minute and the respiration rate 18-20 a minute. All spacecraft systems were functioning normall). TASS said Voskhod II would complete at least 13 orbits of the Earth.\n\nAfter 26 hours. of flight, Col. Pavel Belyayev landed Voskhod II manually near Perm, Russia, TASS announced. The two-man spacecraft had completed 17 orbits of the Earth, one more orbit than planned, and had traveled 720,000 km. This was the first time landing of a Soviet spacecraft had been described as manual. Impact of Voskhod II on the ground, later revealed as snow bank, was described as soft.\n\nIn an interview with Izvestia, one of the two directors of the Soviet space program, the chief designer, whose identity had never been revealed [that is: Sergei Korolev], said the Voskhod II program had called for Lt. Col. Leonov to spend 10 minutes outside the cabin but that he could have stayed much longer. He said the weight and space saved by having two men aboard Voskhod II instead of three men. as on Voskhod I, had been used to install a decompression chamber and related equipment. The designer said Leonovs spacesuit was equipped with duplicate systems to ensure a high degree of reliability and that a bellows had been installed to allow bending of the torso, arms, and legs. The chief theoretician, [?] said that Leonovs principal assignment had been to determine mans reaction to weightlessness in free space. He told TASS: We obtained in practice what we had visualized theoretically before.\n\nOn 20 March 1965, Voskhod IIs two-man crew rested under medical supervision at an undisclosed place in the northern Ural mountains, TASS reported. Soviet space flight headquarters at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan reported that Voskhod IIs antennas had burned away as the spacecraft reentered the earths atmosphere. The descent had been tracked by radar units. Lt. Col. Andrian G. Nikolayev, Soviet Cosmonaut, said the order to use manual controls in landing Voskhod II was given by a Soviet ground station, Izvestia reported. It was not known whether the manual landing was part of the original program or was made necessary by a malfunction of the automatic controls.\n\nSoviet Cosmonaut Andrian Nikolayev said in the press that \"all these operations -- the orientation of Voskhod 2 and switching on of the braking engine -- were performed by my colleague cosmonauts by hand, without the help of automation. They performed this task brilliantly. They carried out this landing excellently.\" He did not say if they had landed in their target landing area.\n\nSoviet Cosmonauts Col. Pavel I. Belyayev and Lt. Col. Aleksey Leonov appeared in public on 21 March for the first time since they landed Voskhod II in the Perm region Mar. 19. They were en route to Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan where they were expected to undergo detailed medical checkups and debriefings by scientists and technicians before being welcomed in Moscow in Red Square. At a news conference reported by Soviet press, Col. Pavel Belyayev and Lt. Col. Aleksey Leonov said they had sighted an artificial satellite during their flight: We shouted with surprise when we saw it slowly rotating about 800 meters from our ship. Neither the satellite nor the orbit in which it was traveling was identified.\n\nCol. Leonov said that when he opened the hatch of the air lock after decompression, he was struck by a flow of blindingly bright sunlight like an arc of electric welding. The spacecraft was in its second orbit, passing over Kerch Strait. Space had an unexpected aspect, he said: Ahead of me was black sky, very black. The sun was not radiant, just a smooth disc without an aureole. Below was the smooth-level earth. You could not tell it was a sphere, only by the fact that the round edge showed on the horizon. The acrobatics tired Leonov, especially because of the effort required to move. He said that although the program required that he carefully wind the rope that had tethered him to the craft, he found it a waste of time and simply pulled it into the hatch. The commander quickly closed the hatch cover and injected pressure into the air lock,\n\nDescribing the manually controlled landing, Col. Belyayev said the controls were switched on in time and all systems had worked without a hitch. He said the spacecraft landed in the northern Ural mountains between two big spruce trees in snow 1.5-3 metres deep.\n\nIn an editorial in Aviation Week and Space Technology, editor Robert Hotz said: The trail-blazing mission of the Soviet Voskhod 2 still is continuing as these lines are written, but it has already opened a new chapter in the history of mans conquest of space. It also has emphasized again that, unless some drastic changes are made, this history will be written primarily in the Russian Cyrillic alphabet with only an occasional U.S. footnote technically necessary\n\nAll of this Soviet progress again emphasizes strongly the ultra-conservatism of the U.S. manned space flight program and the utter inadequacy of the tiny step-by-step approach that sounds so convincing when defending under-funded programs. This approach is sounding more and more idiotic in the face of Soviet space achievements\n\nEach Soviet manned space flight makes it clearer that the Russians are widening their lead over the U.S. in this vital area. It also makes it clear that the many billions the American people have poured willingly into our national space program for the purpose of wresting this leadership from the Soviets are not going to achieve that goal under the present management \n\nOn 23 March 1965, an editorial in Red Star, the Soviet Defense Ministry newspaper, revealed that the booster that had launched Voskhod II had developed 650 tons of thrust. The article said Soviet rockets were unmatched and that the Voskhod II flight expedites the appearance of orbital stations and the landing of people in the heavenly bodies.\n\nNASA Administrator James E. Webb regarded a Russian cosmonauts leaving a space vehicle briefly as spectacular but said the U.S. was more intent on developing a space suit that would enable American astronauts to work outside on space vehicles and develop or put together space centers.\n\nOn 25 March 1965, it was reported that the use of a special airlock through which Lt. Col. Aleksei Leonov passed from the spacecraft cabin into space and back again was a major factor in the success of the Voskhod II flight Mar. 18, it was reported. According to Soviet sources, the preservation of normal pressure inside the spacecraft throughout flight had had an important psychological effect on both Col. Relyayev and Col. Leonov.\n\nOn 25 March 1965, Pavel Belyayev told a Moscow news conference that Voskhod II had been scheduled to land after 16 orbits, but that there was an inaccuracy in the solar system of orientation that prevented use of the automatic landing system. He said he then had to obtain radioed permission from the Soviet space center to land by manual control after the 17th orbit. The landing site was overshot by a certain distance Belyayev said without disclosing how much.\n\nLeonov described time outside the ship saying it is too early to call it a pleasant walk. It could not have been done without hard training. He reported his small push on Voskhod II to move away from it after going out of the hatch started the spacecraft into slow rotation. In pulling himself back to the Voskhod II by his cable, Leonov disclosed he had yanked rather vigorously and had to put his hand out to avoid collision with the spacecraft.\n\nBelyayev said he and Leonov were found by a helicopter 2% hrs. after a soft landing in snowy woods near Perm. He said Voskhod II was airlifted back to the launch site at Baikonur in Soviet Central Asia and could be used again if necessary.\n\nOn 27 March 1965, M. V. Keldysh. President of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, commented on the Voskhod II flight in an article in Izvestin: One of the most significant accomplishments in the conquest of space was the experiment dealing with mans emergence into space. New, grandiose perspectives are now open for the construction of orbital stations, the docking of spacecraft in orbit and the carrying out of astronomical and geophysical investigations in space. In the near future, it will be possible to create, in orbit around the earth, a Space Scientific Research Institute in which scientists representing the most diversified fields will be able to work. The results obtained as a result of the flight of Voskhod-2 are most important steps on the way toward carrying out flights to the moon and on to other celestial bodies.\n\nOn 29 March 1965, Pravda gives the first detailed description of the inside of the Voskhod II spacecraft. The airlock was apparently built into the place occupied by a third astronaut during the Voskhod I flight. After Col. Leonov moved into the airlock, his companion, Col. Belyayev, pressed a button that closed the inside door and created a vacuum inside the lock chamber. At the prescribed moment, Col. Belyayev pressed a second button that opened the hatch between the airlock and space, allowing Col. Leonov to climb out. The procedure was apparently reversed for the astronauts return.\n\nRussian physicist Gennadii Skuridin made public for the first time: on 4-6 may 196t that pressure in Aleksey Leonovs spacesuit during his walk was about 0.4 atmosphere] and that Leonov had trouble with his vision and in orienting himself while in space, but was capable of performing useful work. A thirty-minute movie of Leonovs walk in space gave closeup views of construction of Voskhod IIs airlock, Leonovs spacesuit, gloves, footwear, and life-support equipment back pack.\n\nSome of Aleksey Leonovs comments on its EVA were made public on 24 May 1965: I found that the slightest shift in direction of the force of impact caused rotation in the corresponding plane. Those persons who will be working in space will obviously have much to do in securing their bodies in [the weightless state]. As for the so-called psychological barrier that was supposed to be insurmountable by man preparing to confront the cosmic abyss alone, I not only did not sense any barrier, but even forgot that there could be one.\n\nOn 12 July 1965, Pavel BeIyayev disciosed in an ariicle in the newspaper Sovietsky Patriot that the heat was so intense when he was forced to land Voskhod II by manual controls that drops of molten metal ran down the portholes. He said when he discovered that something was wrong with the automatic landing system of the two-man spacecraft, he asked ground control for permission to use the manual system-something that had never been done before during a Soviet manned spaceflight. * * * * * Current overview: x Mission: Historical reports: Ranger IX, equipped with six television cameras, was successfully launched toward the Moon.T he 360 kg spacecraft continued on its 2½-day, 395 000 km trip to the Moon. Projected target was the crater Alphonsus, about 12° south of the Moon's equator, where gaseous emissions had been reported. Five hours after lift-off, NASA announced that Ranger IXs course was so accurate it would hit the Moon only 650 km north of the crater target; an inflight maneuver would be executed later to correct this small course error.\n\nAfter transmitting 5,811 close-up lunar pictures to earth, Ranger IX travelling at 9,617 km/h, impacted the Moon on 24 March 1965 at 9:08 a.m. EST at 12.9° south latitude ant 2.4° west longitude in the crater Alphonsus. The spacecraft was only six kilometres off target.\n\nNASA had made real-time TV coverage available and the three major networks broadcast live pictures during the last ten minutes of Ranger IX flight. First pictures taken as the photographic probe was 2,000 km from the Moon. had about the same degree of detail as telescope views from Earth. Those takan a few seconds before impact defined objects as small as 25 cm across, including close-ups of canal-like rilles on the floor of the crater and dimple-like depressions at points along the rilles. Photographs shown on television were taken by the B camera, one of two wide-angle cameras used. Four narrow-angle cameras took other shots.\n\nRanger IX was last in the Ranger series, and otal number of photographs from Ranger VII, VIII, and IX was 17,267.\n\nA panel of scientists analyzed slides of the Ranger IX lunar pictures at a post-impact press conference and noted that crater rims -- some with level areas -- and ridges inside the walls seemed harder than the plains\n\nbut that floors of the craters appeared to be solidified volcanic froth that would not support a landing vehicle. Volcanic activity was inferred from indications that the moon had at least three types of craters not caused by meteorite impact.\n\nDr. Ewan A. Whitaker of the Lunar and Planetary Laboratory of the Univ. of Arizona, said parts of the highlands around the crater Alphonsus and ridges within it seemed harder and smoother than the dusty lunar plains. Dr. Gerard P. Kuiper, of the same laboratory, said of the crater: It might well be better to make landings there.\n\nMost significant finding of Ranger IXs photographs, according to Dr. Eugene Shoemaker of the U.S. Geological Survey, was the smoothness of the crater walls and of the long ridges on the floor of the crater.\n\nDr. Harold Urey of the Univ. of California referred to black patches in the pictures which he said might be composed of graphite:  these dark halo craters are due to some sort of plutonic activity beneath the surface of the moon. They do not look to me like terrestrial volcanoes They look like a unique lunar type of object. Dr. Urey said a Soviet scientist had reported a red flare near a peak in Alphonsus and that analysis had indicated presence of a molecule with two carbon atoms. He said this was a very curious situation because this molecule does not escape from any known volcano on earth.\n\nPresident Johnson issued a congratulatory statement that said:  Coming so close after yesterdays Gemini success, this far-out photography reveals the balance of the United States space program. Steps toward the manned flight to the moon have become rapid and coordinated strides, as manned space maneuvers of one day are followed by detailed pictures of the moon on the next.\n\nOn 8 Aprl 1965, Dr. Eugene Shoemaker. head of the astrogeological branch of the U.S. Geological Survey, said that the Ranger program had cost a total of about $200 million. He estimated that each Ranger shot had cost just under $30 million and said that, although four of the seven Ranger missions had failed, it would have been foolish to settle for one success: Just imagine that the Martians sent a Ranger-like camera to take pictures of the Earth. With just one shot, theyd end up with pictures of a space no bigger than the size of an urban lot, or of the peak of the Alps, or of the sand dunes in Arabia. Could they tell anything about the Earth from pictures of just one of these? The Ranger program gave U.S. scientists good pictures of three different areas of the Moon. Shoemaker said. A Ranger picture is worth a million computer words.\n\nOn 15-16 April 1965, world scientists met in a special conference on the lunar surface sponsored by the International Astronomical Union and NASA Goddard Space Flight Center at Greenbelt, Md.\n\nNoting areas of disagreement among scientists, theoretical astrophysicist Thomas Gold of Cornell Univ. tried to explain why the Ranger pictures resolved so little: The Ranger pictures are like a mirror. Everyone sees his own theories reflected in them. Prof. Gold saw a moon covered with dust; young craters composed of solid rock while older craters had somehow gone soft; and vast sheets of ice locked under compacted sediment beneath much of the lunar surface.\n\nDr. Harold C. Urey, Nobel prize-winning chemist from the Univ. of California, referred to evidence of widespread collapse of the lunar surface, probably due to underground movement: The Ranger IXs pictures scared me more than anything. Theres all sorts of evidence that some of these craters are sinking.\n\nDr. Eugene Shoemaker of the Geological Survey said that chances that the moons surface was too soft for the 15-ton LEM were almost vanishingly remote. (Simons, Wash. Post, 4/16/65; Clark, NYT, 4/16/65)\n\nDr. Ewan A. Whitaker agreed with findings in the paper he presented for his colleague, Dr. Gerald P. Kuiper of the Univ. of Arizonas Lunar and Planetary Laboratory. Dr. Kuiper concluded that the lunar surface had a bearing strength of between one and two tons per square foot. His calculations, made from data extracted from Ranger IX photographs. was based on the size of rocks ejected from a given impact crater and the distance they traveled. Other tentative findings were that the dark portions of the maria were due to some unknown fluid flows and not lava or ash flows; that the maria were not completely covered with lunar dust; and that the moons surface exhibited a remarkable series of fracture patterns which could be due to polar contraction, tidal effects, or some other force. * * * * * Current overview: x Mission: Historical reports: Gemini III spacecraft (Molly Brown), with Virgil I. Grissom (Maj. USAF) as command pilot, and John W. Young (LCdr. USN) as pilot, was successfully launched.\n\nWithing six minutes after lift-off, Gemini III was injected into elliptical orbit with apogee: 224 km; perigee: 161 km; period: 88 minutes. Speed of spacecraft was 26,700 km/h. Toward the end of the first orbit, 93 minutes after launching, the first maneuver was performed: Grissom fired two small thruster rockets that pushed backward on the spacecraft, slowing it down by about72 km/h. Lessened velocity caused Gemini III to drop in altitude to a near-circular orbit with apogee: 169 km; perigee: 158 km.\n\nSecond maneuver occurred during second orbit; Grissom used the thrusters to turn the spacecraft broadside to its flight path. Then, he gave a burst that pushed the craft about 1/50th of a degree from the orbital course. Short bursts, fired rapidly allowed the craft to be turned it into a course nearly parallel to his original one. Third maneuver came in the third orbit; Grissom fired the spacecraft thruster rockets dropping into an orbit with perigee of 82 km.\n\nManually controlling reentry, the astronauts turned the spacecrafts blunt end forward, ejected the section carrying the retrorockets. Four hours and 53 minutes after launching, Gemini III safely landed in the Atlantic Ocean off Grand Turk Island, considerably off target and some 80-95 km away from the recovery ship, Intrepid.\n\nNavy frogmen from hovering aircraft fastened a float around Gemini III. Original plans had called for the spacecraft, with the astronauts still inside, to be hoisted aboard the recovery ship and immediate medical checks made. But when Grissom became seasick, the men were picked up by helicopter and landed on the Intrepid; the spacecraft was recovered later.\n\nThe astronauts helped perform two experiments. One was the irradiation of human blood to test the combined effects on it of weightlessness and irradiation. The other was to squirt small jets of water into the plasma sheath that surrounded the spacecraft as it reentered the Earth's atmosphere, testing a theory that a fluid flowing through the ionized layer of atoms would permit radio signals to penetrate the communications blackout common to reentry.\n\nGemini officials said that, so far as was known, this was the first time a manned spacecraft had maneuvered in orbit, changing its orbital path.\n\nDr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, said at a press conference: This particular flight is noteworthy for many reasons. Perhaps most importantly it is the first manned flight of a Gemini vehicle and it represents, then, the first step in the remaining twelve Gemini flights. In this flight we did for the first time carry out an orbital maneuver in space. Another first was the first demonstration of reentry control. We did control reentry landing point on this mission. Another first was the use of Syncom for communications with the Coastal Sentry Quebec during the course of the flight.\n\nAn editorial in the March 24, 1965 Baltimore Sun said: Yesterdays Gemini flight is described as historic and so it was. So too is each successful new space exploration, launched by whatever country, manned or unmanned What is happening is that a body of knowledge is being accumulated through increasingly accurate photographs and increasingly sophisticated exercises and experiences on the part of the adventurers of our age, the astronauts \n\nNASA Administrator James E. Webb made these points: The most significant accomplishment of the GT-3 flight was that it provided verification of the basic design, development, test and operations procedures NASA is using to develop manned spacecraft, man-rated launch vehicles and a world-wide operational network\n\nOn 25 March, at a press conference, Virgil Grissom and John Young described the three-orbit GT-3 flight as busy, exhilarating, near-perfect, and short on surprises. They said it was highly significant for future flight in space since it proved that a spacecraft could be maneuvered precisely, at will, and more independently of the ground than before. They said it also proved that man can eat and safely dispose of wastes as they will need to do on long flights. Major Grissom suggested two possible reasons that the Molly Brown had undershot the target landing area: one was that something might have gone wrong during the final orbit change or when subsequently the braking rockets were fired to start the spacecrafts descent; the other was that there might have been a miscalculation of the crafts center of gravity.\n\nOn 6 April 1965, Subcommittee Chairman Albert Thomas (D-Teu.) and the House Independent Offices Appropriations Subcommittee were highly critical of Astronaut Virgil Grissoms deviation from flight plan instructions during the Gemini III flight and eating a sandwich instead of fasting. According to published reports, one Subcommittee member referred to a $30 million corned beef sandwich. and another asked NASA Administrator James E. Webb how he could control a multi-million dollar budget if he could not control two astronauts.\n\nOn 21 April 1965, NASA absolved Astronaut Virgil I. Grissom of any blame in the 93-m off-target landing of the Gemini III spacecraft, according to MSC spokesman. The mishap was attributed to the fact that the spacecraft did not develop as much lift as expected.\n\nOn 3 May 1965, Charles W. Mathews, Gemini program manager explained why Gemini III landed about 100 km short of predicted spot: The pilots were instructed to fly a bank angle based on wind-tunnel data of Gemini spacecrafts lift characteristics. But in actual reentry, the spacecrafts lift was only about 2/3 of what we had expected it to be. Onboard instrumentation showed the discrepancy, but the command pilot followed ground instructions. When he ultimately changed the angle, based on the onboard display, it was too late to achieve the spacecraft target.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCurrent overview: x Mission: Historical reports: Gemini IV was launched on 3 June 1965 at 11:16 EDT and began the four-day space flight of astronauts James A. McDivitt (Maj., USAF) and Edward H. White, II (Maj., USAF), who would make 62 revolutions around the Earth in 97 hrs. 56 min. Eight minutes after lift-off, traveling at 28,265 km/h, the spacecraft was inserted inton orbit.\n\nViewers in Great Britain and at least 11 Western European nations were able to watch the Gemini 4 lift-off live via Early Bird I satellite. Picture reception was reportedly clear. ComSatCorp, cooperating with European ground station owners, arranged for free use of Early Bird I between 8:00 a.m. and 12 noon EDT.\n\nA home-made U.S. flag, carried by astronauts Virgil Grissom and John Young on Gemini III flight, was hoisted at NASA Manned Spacecraft Center the moment James McDivitt and Edward White II went into orbit. Flag would be flown only while astronauts were in spaceflight.\n\nIn an article suggesting the possibility of catastrophe during the GT-4 flight, William Hines had said in the Washington Evening Star: The truth is that the only first the United States has a chance to achieve in Gemini 4 is first casualties in space, and nobody (including the Russians) seek this dubious record.\n\nCommenting on the planned rendezvous, he said:  the other - and more questionable added spectacular on the present mission - is a risky business of unknown proportions There are several purely technical objections to this exercise. First, it is not part of the original Gemini 4 mission, but an afterthought. Second, the spacecraft was not built for rendezvous. Third, the rocket was never envisioned as a target vehicle and is uncontrollable in space\n\nBut if tragedy should strike as a result of something that happens on the first few orbits of Gemini 4, how will the responsibility be fixed: as pilot error or politicians error?\n\nOriginal plans had been for Gemini IV to be maneuvered within 7.5 metres of the burned out second stage of the Titan II booster rocket and for White to approach and possibly touch it during his extravehicular mission. But three hours into flight, ground stations reported that excessive tumbling of the second stage had increased atmospheric drag and that it was orbiting 51 km ahead of and 8 km below Gemini IV. Mission Director Christopher Kraft confirmed Command Pilot McDivitts suggestion to abandon further attempts at rendezvous because of a potential fuel shortage.\n\nWhites extravehicular activity, planned for the second orbit, was delayed until the third to allow astronauts more preparation time. It began at 15:45 EDT. The cabin was depressurized; White, equipped with tether carrying oxygen and communication and with chest pack for emergency oxygen supply, emerged from the spacecraft just past Hawaii. Carrying a modified 35 mm. single-lens reflex camera loaded with color film, and propelled by a hand-held, oxygen-jet gun, he went three times to the full length of his 7.5-m tether and then returned, using the gun to halt his motion and prevent his hitting the spaceship. When the gas supply in the gun was depleted, he returned to the spacecraft by gently tugging on the tether line. At one point. McDivitt exclaimed: You smeared my windshield, you dirty dog.\n\nFlight plans had called for a ten-minute walk in space but White remained outside the spacecraft for 22 minutes. He experienced no disorientation during his walk. When he finally heeded commands to return to the capsule, he had difficulty closing the hatch and decided not to reopen it to jettison excess equipment. Its the saddest moment of my life, White said as he reentered the spacecraft.\n\nOn June 5, during the 17th orbit, the astronauts spoke to their wives at MSC. During the 20th orbit, McDivitt spotted a satellite with big arms sticking out. He was unable to identify it positively. (ABC science editor Jules Bergman reported that the satellite sighted was a secret U.S. military reconnaiSsance satellite with cameras. He said that space officials had been unable to identify it because DOD would not admit the existence of a U.S. reconnaissance satellite.) On June 6, during the 48th orbit, trouble developed with the spacecrafts computer and attempts to repair it with the aid of ground instructions failed. The malfunctioning computer made it necessary for Gemini IV to reenter on a ballistic trajectory.\n\nThroughout the flight, the daily routine of the astronauts included eating, exercise, and performance of medical and scientific experiments. They alternated rest periods. During 12 of the 62 orbits, when Gemini IV passed through a heavy radiation area called the South Atlantic anomaly, astronauts McDivitt and White switched on radiation and magnetic field measuring devices to take readings inside and outside the spacecraft and near their bodies. They also attempted to improve the knowledge of the Earths terrain through high-quality color photographs; to measure with instruments the electrostatic change that accumulates in space and on objects in space; to better define the magnitude and direction of the Earths geomagnetic field; to test the accuracy of part of a prototype navigational system for future space capsules; to measure heartbeats to try to determine the effects of prolonged weightlessness on functioning of the brain; to determine the effects of limited exercise in space through use of a tension cord; to take high-resolution photographs of cloud formations over the earth to aid weathermen in improved forcasting from weather satellites; to determine more exactly the elevation of the earths atmosphere and the layers through use of filtered film; and to determine if long periods of weithtlessness might make the bones brittle.\n\nOn June 7, to begin reentry, McDivitt fired a 45-kg thrusting rocket for 2 minutes 41 seconds  one second too long - to guide the capsule into an orbit with 252 km apogee and 160 km perigee. Twelve minutes later, McDivill fired the retrorockets; 2½ minutes later, he placed the spacecraft into a slow rotation to reduce reentry dispersion. Communications with the spacecraft then ceased for about 4 minutes as ion sheat blackout phase of reentry beagan. Gemini IV entered the final stage of reentry at 13:07 EDT when the stabilizing chute emerged and dampted the oscillation of the descending craft. The main parachute opened shortly afterward and slowed the spacecraft for its final landing at 13:13 EDT, about 725 km east of Cape Kennedy. The landing was 40 65 km off target because of the one-second error in the firing of the thrusting rockets and one-second delay in the firing of the retrorockets.\n\nFifteen minutes after splashdown, Navy frogmen, lowered into the water by helicopter, placed a flotation collar around the capsule. Before egressing from the spacecraft to be hoisted to helicopter, astronauts took biomedical data on themselves. About 40 minutes later, Majors McDivitt and White were landed by helicopter on the flight deck of the carrier Wasp. They were taken immediately to the ships sick bay for postflight examinations.\n\nDr. Charles Berry, Chief Flight Surgeon for the astronauts, said after the examinations: We have knocked down an awful lot of straw men. We had been told that we would have an unconscious astronaut after four days of weightlessness. Well, theyre not. We were told that the astronaut would experience vertigo, disorientation when he stepped out of that spaceship. The most serious problem was fatigue. Both men were bushed, said Dr. Berry. Maj. McDivitt had a few flecks of caked blood in his nostrils, caused by the dryness of the mucous membranes from inhaling pure oxygen for so long. X-rays taken of the astronauts little fingers and heel bones both before and after the flight to determine if long exposure to weightlessness would cause a substantial loss of calcium were being studied.\n\nThe Gemini IV flight had included at least two world firsts: a record length for two-man flights and the first time a pilot had maneuvered outside a ship with a propulsion gun, which gave him control over his movements. American astronauts had flown a total of 10 days, 19 hours and 34 minutes. in space; Soviet astronauts had accumulated 21 days, 3 hours and 16 minutes.\n\n[Note: the longest one-man piloted spaceflight, Vostok 5, was 21 hours longer than Gemini IV; as Soviets 3- and 2-man spaceflight (Voskhod 1 and 2) lasted only one day.]\n\nAn analysis of worldwide press reactions to the successful Gemini IV flight indicated that most newspapers took the occasion to call for US.-Soviet cooperation in space ventures. That this [cooperation] is unlikely shows how far our politics lag behind our technology, Britains Manchester Guardian said. Dutch newspapers joined in asking for cooperation in space and Trouw said the duplication of effort by the Soviet Union and the United States is a waste of money and know-how. The West Berlin press highly praised the U.S. policy of reporting the Gemini flight as it was taking place. Swedish newspapers refrained from any comment amid a wave of anti-American sentiment over Viet Nam and the Dominican Republic. The Hindustani Times commented: It is a pity that the two nations [US. and Soviet Union] are going about the job with such secrecy. The time has come for both nations to pool their resources and make the projected attempt on the moon a truly human adventure.\n\nPresident Johnson, calling Gemini 4s, said:  We can hope and pray that the time will come when all men of all nations will join together to explore space together and walk side by side toward peace.\n\nProbable reasons for the Gemini IV crews failure to achieve rendezvous with the booster -- based on runs in a rendezvous simulator -- were listed: (1) visual rendezvous requires extended ground practice; (2) maneuver is nearly impossible without radar if the spacecraft and target are more than 1,500 metres apart; (3) more fuel than originally expected was required. * * * * * Current overview: x Notes: On 27 July 1964, NASA named Capt. James A. McDivitt (USAF) and Capt. Edward H. White II (USAF) as pilot and copilot for the second manned space flight of Project Gemini (GT-4), a four-day Earth-orbital mission in early 1965. Astronauts named as backup crew for the flight were Maj. Frank Borman (USAF) and Lt. Cdr. James A. Lovell, Jr. (USN) . All four were second generation astronauts selected for the NASA program in September 1962.\n\nAt a press conference on 29 July 1964, Kenneth S. Kleinknecht, Deputy Project Manager of Project Gemini, stated that an experiment assigned to GT-4, scheduled for early 1965, would involve the first exposure of an astronaut to the hazards of outer space without full space vehicle protection. He said that the experiment would involve stepping into space, but modified this later to say that it might involve nothing more than the crewmans opening up the spacecraft hatch and standing up in his seat.\n\nOn 22 March 1965, NASA Administrator James E. Webb was questioned by Sen. Walter F. Mondale (D-Minn.) on when the first U.S. extravehicular activity was planned, and he replied: Within the next year. We are not sure on which Gemini flight we will do it as yet. On 25 March, he reported that an American astronaut probably would be able to open his spacecraft and partly emerge from the cabin during the GT-5 flight. Mr. Webb said under questioning that there might be some possibility of achieving this in the next Gemini flight, but that GT-5 was more likely.\n\nAviation Week & Space Technology reports, on 5 April 1965, that an equipment modification to permit opening of the hatch on Gemini 4 had been successfully tested. Hoses connecting the spacesuits to the spacecrafts environmental control system were lengthened to permit the astronaut to stand and partially emerge through the hatch. NASA had not yet approved a spacecraft-depressurization and hatchopening exercise for the two-man spaceflight.\n\nOn 19 April, Edward L. Hays, chief of crew systems at NASA Manned Spacecraft Center, announced that the crew of the Gemini GT-4 flight would wear the qualified Extravehicular Activity (EVA) spacesuit during their flight.\n\nOn 29 April 1965, Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, said that although extravehicular activity was not planned for Gemini astronauts until GT-5, we are working hard at trying to qualify the space suit and the hatch itself to see whether we can accelerate that date. If their spacesuits and the spacecrafts hatch passed tests in time, Astronaut Edward H. White would lean halfway out of the capsule for perhaps 15 minutes on flight GT-4, scheduled for early June. He and Astronaut James A. McDivitt would attempt to orbit the Earth 63 times in 98 hours.\n\nOn 13 May 1965, Gemini GT-4 countdown rehearsal at KSC was delayed because of a minor fueling problem. Launch of the GT~4 mission was scheduled for June 3.\n\nOn 22 May 1965, the Gemini 4 manned spaceflight had been scheduled for June 3, NASA announced. The four-day flight would last about 97 hrs. 50 min., and would increase the USs hours of manned space flight to about 257 hrs. No decision had been made about opening the two-man spacecraft and letting one astronaut stand exposed to space.\n\nOn 25 May 1965, it was announced that, during the planned 4-day flight, astronaut Edward White would leave the Gemini 4 spacecraft for 12 minunites, if conditions are favorable, NASA officials said the decision had been delayed So final qualification tests could be completed on the spacecraft, spacesuit, secondary life support pack and umbilical.\n\nThe 12-layer protective suit that White would wear had been worn for more than 200 hrs. and White himself had worn it during more than 60 hrs. of tests. Among other things, it had had pellets fired at it at a speed of 27,000 km/h to simulate the impact of small meteoroids.\n\nThe flights command pilot, James McDivitt, would not open his hatch but would take movies of White through a spacecraft window. White would take a 35-mm. still camera loaded with color film on his walk in space. Although he had practiced acrobatics, he had no planned program and would use his own judgment as to what to do while outside the ship. Exit from the spacecraft was planned for the second orbit.\n\nOn 27 May 1965, it was reported that President Johnson was disappointed that the two-man Gemini-Titan 4 spacecraft scheduled for June 3 launching, had no cameras aboard for simultaneous TV transmission of the space walk. The President had hoped that at completion of the four-day flight by Astronauts McDivitt and White, the U.S. would have pictures similar to those released by the Soviet Union after Voskhod II flight. TV cameras had been sacrificed for experimental instruments.\n\nOn 28 May 1965, Dr. George Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, outlined the plan for the flight: When the Gemini 4 spacecraft separated from the second stage, six minutes after launching, Maj. James A. McDivitt, as command pilot, would fire jet thrusters to hold a tight formation with the spent stage, which would trail the astronauts by about 100 metres. Throughout the first orbit, the astronauts would make a complete check of all their systems. At the start of the second orbit they would begin preparing for Maj. Whites emergence by unpacking life support packs, the maneuvering unit, and the 7.5-metre lifeline. Sweeping over the Indian Ocean during this orbit, they would begin to depressurize the spacecraft cabin and pressurize their spacesuits. Over Hawaii, Maj. McDivitt would maneuver the spacecraft to within 7.5 metres of the second stage. Maj. White would open his hatch and, at a point west of Guaymas, Mexico, he would leave the vehicle. That would be about three hours after launching.\n\nUsing the hand-gun maneuvering unit, Maj. White would slowly rotate toward the second stage, which is 8.2 metres long and 3 metres in diameter and would be equipped with two flashing lights. The astronaut would carry a 35-mm movie camera to take pictures of the Earth, star background, the booster, and the spacecraft. After 10 minutes, over Florida, Maj. White would begin returning to the spacecraft. The cabin would be repressurized and the suits depressurized. Then Maj. McDivitt would fire thrusters so that the spacecraft would move about 26 km away from the booster.\n\nDuring the fifth orbit, about three hours later, the Gemini again would be maneuvered so that it would approach the second stage high over Africa. The craft would close to within 3 metres this time to determine how well they can approach an orbiting craft, sighting on the flashing lights.\n\nOn 15 June 1965, Dr. George E. Mueller, NASA Associate Administrator for Manned Space Flight, said that it would take a great deal of effort over a number of years for the United States to achieve first place in space and warned it would be a mistake to believe that the successful Gemini IV spaceflight had overcome a lead of several years held by the Soviet Union. He said the most important result of the Gemini IV flight might be the condition of the astronauts upon their return, based on the preliminary medical examinations of astronauts McDivitt and White. [Assessment of Dr. Mueller was wrong as history will show that, with Gemini 4, U.S. equalled U.S.S.R. and will overtaked it with Gemini V.] Mission: Historical reports: Proton I, a scientific space station, was orbited by the U.S.S.R. with a powerful new booster, TASS announced. The 12,190-kg payload was claimed to be heaviest ever launched. In addition to scientific and measuring instruments, the space station was equipped with special equipment for the study of cosmic particles of super-high energies and a radio transmitter. TASS said: In order to insure realization of the planned space research program, a powerful new booster rocket has been developed in the Soviet Union.\n\nCommenting on the Soviet launching, Dr. Edward C. Welsh, Executive Secretary of the National Aeronautics and Space Council, said he was impressed but not astonished by the Russian accomplishment. We have been predicting for some time that they would deve!op into the space station field, he said. We have anticipated that they would practice rendezvous and docking before they developed what they said was a space station, but they havent followed that particular line.\n\nSoviet propaganda needs in the wake of Mariner 4s flight to Mars [on July 15] appear to have been influential in determining the timing of the latest Soviet space shots, wrote Harry Schwartz in the New York Times on 18 July 1965. He continued: Moscows decision to send up last Friday two rockets -- one putting five small satellites into orbit and the second orbiting the heaviest man-made object yet put into space -- seems to Western observers to be a transparent Soviet effort to counteract thepropaganda defeat Moscow suffered as a result of Mariner 4s historic voyage. That defeat was all the greater because of the failure of the Soviet Mars probe, Zond, sent on the same journey at roughly the same time Mariner 4 was launched.\n\nObservers in Moscow believed that the Soviet Union would shortly launch a gigantic spacecraft with as many as four to six people aboard, said an article in Polands Trybura Ludu published on 18 July 1965. The spacecraft would most likely be commanded by one of the experienced cosmonauts and would have a weight of over 12 tons. It would be placed in orbit by the booster which launched Proton I. The latter, according to the correspondent, probably used solid fuel. The correspondent speculated that the spacecraft would remain in orbit one week and that several cosmonauts would take a walk in space simultaneously\n\nProf. S. N. Vernov, corresponding member of U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences, noted in TASS interview the unusual weight of Proton I and its special equipment for studying cosmic particles of super-high energy. He said the method for counting the particles, worked out eight years ago by Prof. N. L. Grigorov, had made it possible to determine the total energy of each particle separately. Scientists had hesitated to use the method in space because of the weight of the equipment. This problem had been solved with the creation of a more powerful booster, he said.\n\nOn 22 July 1965, Soviet professor V. V. Fedynskiy said that Proton I had demonstrated the possibility of getting more powerful spaceships into orbit, which, if necessary, could lift into space a crew and a large quantity of research equipment. He said use of the new rocket booster would permit more intensive studies of space, including those that would allow a more thorough research of the physical fields and internal structure of the Earth directly from space. Such studies would be of primary interest for geophysics and geology, he said.\n\nOn 29 July 1965, TASS reported that Proton I was functioning normally.\n\nOn 6 August 1965, TASS announced that U.S.S.R.s 12.2-ton Proton I satellite was orbited by a booster whose main engines were rated at thrust of more than 60-million horsepower. Proton I marked the beginning of a new phase in the exploration and domestication of space. It would study solar cosmic rays, spectrum and composition of cosmic ray particles, nuclear interactions of galactic origin, and galactic gamma rays.\n\nProton I had, for the first time, trapped particles with energy of 100 trillion electron volts and a measured energy spectrum of cosmic rays containing such particles, Nikolai I. Grigorov, head of Cosmic Ray Laboratory at Moscow Univ. Institute of Nuclear Physics, told Pravda on 21 August 1965. He said that precise measurements of high-energy particles required the use of a heavy ionizing calorimeter which could not have been orbited without the lifting capacity of Russias new large rockets. Prof. Grigorov explained that high-energy particles never reached Earth-bound registering devices because they were absorbed and transformed as they collided with atoms of Earths atmosphere. * * * * * Current overview: x Mission: Historical reports: Zond III automatic space station was launched into a heliocentric orbit by U.S.S.R. from a heavy artificial satellite placed in a parking orbit around the Earth by a multi-stage carrier rocket, TASS announced. TASS said that the trajectory of the automatic station is close to the expected one, that communications were stable, and that all systems were functioning normally. The purpose of the launch was to check the stations systems in conditions of prolonged space flight and the holding of scientific studies in interplanetary space, TASS said. Pictures of the farside of the Moon taken by Zond III were later released on 20 August 1965.\n\nOn 19 July 1965, U.S.S.R. reported that Zond III had passed the 226,000-km mark in its flight towards unspecified destination. Zond III was said to be functioning normally and radioing scientific data back to Earth.\n\nZond IIIs lunar photography mission was announced by TASS: Automatic station Zond 3 is continuing its flight along a heliocentric orbit Photography of the Moon began on July 20, 36 hrs. after launch, at 0424 hrs., Moscow time, when the automatic station was at a distance of 11,600 km from the lunar surface, and was concluded at 0532 hrs. at a distance of about 10,000 km. After the lunar flyby, the station is continuing its motion in a heliocentric orbit, becoming increasingly more distant from the Earth and the Sun. Image transmission began in accordance with the program of July 29 at a distance of 2.2 million km, when the angular size of the Earth was small enough for the precise tuning of the on-board parabolic antenna towards the Earth.\n\nZond 3 for the first time photographed a part of the Moon that cannot be seen from the Earth and which was not included in the photos made by the Soviet interplanetary station in October 1959. At the moment photography began, the phase of the Moon visible from Zond 3 was close to full moon, while when the photography ended almost half of the lunar disc was in shadow. The first frames show a considerable part of the Moon visible from the Earth. Later frames show the surface of the Moon when there was considerable solar side illumination, when the relief formations cast distinct shadows.\n\nThe images from Zond 3 are sent with a clarity of 1,100 lines. When photographing from a distance of the order of 10,000 km, images of a lunar surface area of about 5 million square km are possible. The quality of the photographs obtained make it possible to see numerous details of the lunar relief, which are of considerable interest. The photo obtained from Zond 3 will be published in leading newspapers and scientific journals. To analyze the result obtained and to name the craters, ranges, and other formations on the newly photographed sections of the Moon, the Academy of Sciences of the U.S.S.R. has set up a special commission.\n\nScientific investigations are continuing on Zond 3. For further testing of the radio line, the transmission of photographs of the far side of the Moon from the station will continue during subsequent communications sessions, right up to the greatest distance from the earth. Thirty-eight communications sessions have been conducted from Zond 3. All on-board systems are functioning normally.\n\nZond IIIs photographs of the hidden side of the moon received editorial comment in the New York Times: Scientists and laymen from all nations will look forward to the pictures of the dark side of the Moon that Moscow reports its Zond 3 satellite took last month. Unitil then, the only photographic intelligence on the area had come from the pictures an earlier Soviet satellite took in 1959, a time when the available equipment -- and consequently the quality of the result -- was primitive by present standards. Six years ago, the marvel was that this feat could be accomplished at all. Now, in the wake of the photographic knowledge of the moon and of Mars obtained by this countrys Ranger and Mariner vehicles, world judgment of the importance of the Soviet accomplishment will depend upon the quality and the quantity of the new knowledge it provides.\n\nOn 23 August 1965, Yuri Khodarev, engineer in the Soviet space program, revealed that Zond III had used photographic film instead of magnetic film to record pictures for later playback. The mission had been essentially a test in which the spacecraft would continue to play back the Moon pictures repeatedly at increasingly greater distances up to hundreds of millions of kilometers, Khodarev said, adding, we have created a new, compact photo television system intended for photographing and transmission of images of planets under conditions of prolonged space flight. Zond III had taken 25 photos of the far side of the Moon in little more than an hour. The moon photographs were as good as those taken of the visible side from earth-based observatories: They show beautiful half-tone transitions, reflecting the character of detailed surface relief.\n\nThe Zond III photographs confirmed earlier conclusions concerning the scarcity of dark depressions on the moons reverse side, but also revealed sea-like formations up to 500 km across and about as long as the maria. These formations differed structurally from the maria and lacked their characteristic dark color. The northern part of the side of the moon was occupied by a bright elevation pitted with craters. Concentration of craters throughout the reverse side of the Moon was high.\n\nMstislav V. Keldysh, President of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, noted that the trajectory of Zond III had passed far from the planets but said that the experience we gained in launching this probe into remote space will be used in subsequent launchings to photograph the planets. He said the U.S.S.R. had already begun preparations to achieve a soft lunar landing. Experiments aboard the spacecraft were for study of magnetic fields, solar wind, low-frequency radio emission of the galaxy, micrometeors, cosmic rays, and the in frared and ultravioiet spectra of the lunar surface. * * * * * Current overview: x Mission: Historical reports: On 19 August 1965, Gemini Vs launch day, the countdown progress to T-10 minutes before it was canceled and reset for August 21. Astronauts Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad, Jr., were disappointed, but took the delay in stride.\n\nFive hours before the scheduled launch, computer studies suggested that the liquid hydrogen in the spacecrafts fuel cells was boiling off too quickly. Engineers attempts to force additional liquid hydrogen into the fuel cells succeeded only in hastening the escape of hydrogen gas. Finally, a colder liquid hydrogen was used with success. As\n\nTen minutes before lift-off, apparent troubles with a telemetry programmer caused another hold in the countdown. During a thunderstorm, a lightning-induced power surge affected the electrical instruments.\n\nAt 17:00 EDT, as NASA officials were opening a press conference, they were informed that a fire had broken out in a communications cable linking the Gemini V launch complex with mission control center. The officials said that there was a very good possibility that Gemini V could be launched on August 21, but that no definite date could be set until a partial countdown was held the next day to determine the damage caused by the power surge and the cable fire.\n\nOn 20 August 1965, NASA announced that Gemini V would be launched from Kennedy Space Center, August 21, at 10:00, EDT. Problems which had collectively postponed the launch on August 19, had been resolved: (1) the malfunctioning telemetry programer had been replaced; (2) the underground communications cable had been repaired; (3) the technique for loading the fuel cells with liquid hydrogen had been perfected; (4) security police would take extra precautions to prevent trespassing onto the launch area; and (5) the Gemini 5 computer, which officials feared had been damaged by the lightning-induced power surge, was functioning normally.\n\nGemini V spacecraft, piloted by L. Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad, Jr., was successfully launched with two-stage Titan II booster on an eight-day mission (190 hr. 55 min.) comprising 120 revolutions of the Earth. Flight objectives were: (1) demonstrate and evaluate performance of the Gemini spacecraft; (2) evaluate performance of the rendezvous guidance and navigation system using the Radar Evaluation Pod (REP); and (3) evaluate effects of prolonged exposure to the space environment of the two-man crew. As reported by the New York Times, the eight days mission is roughly the time that woud be required for a round trip to the moon. If Colonel Cooper and Commander Conrad can function effectively in a state of weightlessness for that long and then return without injury, they will have given strong support to the hypothesis on which the whole program for a manned moonshot is based.\n\nFirst stage of the booster burned for 156.3 seconds. Second stage then separated, burned for 179.6 seconds. Traveling at 28,327 km/h, the 3,605-kg Gemini V was inserted into orbit. Fifty-six minutes after liftoff, astronauts fired thruster rockets to raise the perigee to 170.9 km in preparation for rendezvous with REP, a practice maneuver to prepare for Gemini VIs rendezvous in orbit with an Agena stage. At beginning of 2nd orbit, astronauts ejected REP from the adapter section behind the spacecraft. REP moved away at eight kilometres per hour.\n\nThe astronauts carried two one-dollar bills during the Gemini V mission to prove on landing that they were the same spacemen who were launched, UPI reported. A representative of the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale recorded the serial numbers on the bills before the launch and would check them after the landing.\n\nAbout two hours after insertion of Gemini V into orbit, oxygen pressure for the new fuel cell dropped from 55 to 4 atmospheric pressure because of a failure in the heater element circuitry. This pressure-drop severely reduced the fuel cell's output of electrical power. The REP experiment was abandoned and there was some apprehension as to whether the flight could continue.\n\nAt 27 hours, into the flight, Cooper and Conrad successfully locked their spacecraft radar on a spare REP transponder mounted on a tower at NASA Merritt Island Launch Area during a six-minute pass. Oxygen pressure began building up in the fuel cell system, and hopes of completing the mission were raised,\n\nOn 22 August, the New York Times commented on the malfunction of the fuel cell in the Gemini V spacecraft launched August 21: Past manned space flights have gone so well in most respects that yesterdays tension-filled hours were a shock and a surprise. It has all seemed too easy to the millions of television viewers who have observed previous man-in-space experiments. It was natural to assume that once Gemini 5 was so successfully launched, all would once again go more or less as planned. But those intimately involved with these efforts have known all along of the numerous possibilities of trouble. They were not greatly surprised that one of those possibilities for major difficulty -- in this case a malfunction of the fuel cell on Gemini 5-turned into reality.\n\nThere will undoubtedly be future emergencies in space. Yesterdays events are a sobering reminder that the effort to reach the moon during this decade is straining the limits of available technology, and that serious risks are being taken. These hazards are also faced, of course, by the Soviet manned space program. The brave men both countries are sending into space would be the prime beneficiaries of full Soviet-American cooperation that would pool both countries knowledge and experience to minimize the dangers inherent in these pioneering efforts.\n\nDispatch to Moscow from TASS New York correspondent, Leonid Ponomarev: The flight of the U.S. spaceship Gemini-5 proceeded normally for only two hours, although the flight program was calculated for eight days.\n\nThe main reason [was] that a new system for providing electric power was being used in the Gemini-5 spacecraft for the first time\n\nIt is a noteworthy fact that the new system for providing electrical power has never once been tested in spaceflight conditions. From the test stands on earth, the installation was put directly into working conditions in space. There are several reasons that explain this haste and a certain degree of risk. The program chiefs were given the task of catching up with the Soviet Union at any price regarding the length of flight in space. However, the present power of U.S. rockets and the size of the astronauts capsule are utterly inadequate for lifting and storing reliably tested battery-powered electrical power installations, which would weigh more than the new system. U.S. scientists were compelled to rapidly create a system, new in principle, in order to provide power for the Gemini-5 spacecraft for eight days so that it could fulfill its tasks.\n\nOn August 23, as Gemini V made its 32nd revolution around the Earth, the spacecraft began a series of maneuvers to rendezvous with a simulated Agena upper stage in lieu of the REP experiment. By the 34th orbit, Gemini V was only 26 km behind the simulated Agena, very close to the planned 24-km separation NASA hoped to have on Gemini VI prior to final closing and docking maneuver. Last maneuver was not attempted because of the need to conserve fuel on Gemini V.\n\nOn August 24, astronauts Cooper and Conrad twice spotted objects on the ground; they observed a Minuteman ICBM launch from Vandenberg AFB, and tracked and photographed it; they sighted a huge checkerboard design laid out on the ground near Laredo, Tex., and reported direction in the which arrows in the center of the blocks were pointed.\n\nSoviet claim that the Gemini V spaceflight was undertaken with haste and definite risk received editorial comment in the August 24s Washington Evening Star: Tass, the official Soviet news agency, should feel a little bit embarrassed at the moment. It has given a big play to a story by Leonid Ponomariov [sic], its New York correspondent. The story has charged that American space officials have been ordered by the Johnson administration to beat the Soviet Union at any price with regard to the duration of orbital flight.\n\n our country may indeed be forging ahead. But nothing could be more ridiculous than Ponomariovs [sic] studied suggestion that Gemini 5 has been put into orbit in a slapdash manner, with callous disregard for the safety of the astronauts aboard, just to steal a space scene from the Soviets. The fuel system and everything else aboard the Cooper-Conrad vehicle are not whimsical improvisations. That has been made dramatically clear by the way in which Geminis initial power failure has been eliminated with help from ground control, by the crafts built-in means of self-correction. As a result, it seems fairly certain right now that Astronauts Cooper and Conrad will be able to complete their eight-day mission\n\nOn August 25, the astronauts saw, tracked, and photographed another Minuteman ICBM fired from Vandenberg AFB and identified a rocket sled test on Holloman AFB. At request of U.S. Weather Bureau,, they attempted to photograph the eye of tropical storm Doreen about 300 km south of Hawaii.\n\nDuring the flight, the astronauts both remained in good spirits. Sixteen of the planned seventeen experiments were conducted. Despite the heavy work schedule, Cooper and Conrad each slept about five hours a day. The astronauts ate about 2,000 calories of food a day, less than the 2,900 calories prescribed for the mission, and each drank three kilograms of water daily.\n\nAugust 27 saw problems with the steady accumulation of water in the fuel cell, which threatened to exceed water-storage capacity; faulty attitude and maneuvering thrusters; and the boiling off of hydrogen gas which caused the spacecraft to roll.\n\nOn August 28, the fuel cell and the left thruster were functioning well. Conrad reported seeing a carrier and a destroyer steaming right into Jacksonville; it was actually a tug pulling a large barge.\n\nOn August 29, Cooper and Conrad talked via radio with Astronaut M. Scott Carpenter, in Sealab II on the floor of the Pacific off La Jolla, Calif.\n\nApproach of Hurricane Betsy from the coast of South America forced NASA officials to order Gemini V to land one revc!ution early. Two more of Gemini Vs thrusters froze, but there was still sufficient steering power to correct minor variations.\n\nTo begin reentry, the astronauts fired four braking rockets as the spacecraft passed 1,100 km north of Hawaii. Reentry was normal. Gemini V splashed down into the Atlantic at 8:56 EDT, 1,000 km east of Jacksonville, 145 km off target. A human error in computing the elapsed time of flight caused the target error.\n\nAssisted from the capsule by Navy frogmen 45 minutes after splashdown, the astronauts were taken by helicopter to U.S.S. Lake Champlain for medical debriefing.\n\nThe Gemini V mission established eight new world records: (1) longest manned space flight: 190 hrs., 55 min. (former record: 119 hrs., six min. held by U.S.S.R.); (2) national man hours in space: 441 hrs., 24 min. (former record, 507 hrs., 16 min. held by U.S.S.R.); (3) longest multi-manned space flight: 190 hrs., 56 rnin. (former record, 97 hrs., 48 min. set by U.S.); (4) most revolutions for a manned space flight: 120 (former record, 81, set by U.S.S.R.); (5) most manned flights: 9 (former record held by U.S.S.R., 8); (6) first man to make a second orbital flight: L. Gordon Cooper; (7) individual with most space flight time: Col. Cooper; (8) individuals making the longest single space flight: Cooper and Conrad (former record held by U.S.S.R.)\n\nI certainly have seen nothing in the eight-day data that would lead me to be worried about a 14-day flight, Dr. Charles A. Berry, chief physician for the astronauts, told reporters on 30 August 1965.é. He said that the astronauts were in good physical condition and were returning to normal as quickly as had the pilots of the four-day Gemini 4 flight. Changes in such indicators as the heart rate and blood pressure characteristics seemed to reflect adaptation to the weightless space environment and, later, to the stress of returning to normal gravity of Earth, Dr. Berry explained. Heart rates became lower in space and rose above normal on returning to Earth. At first, on return to Earth, blood pressure did not respond as promptly as normal to tilt-table tests designed to show how well the circulatory system copes with sudden changes from horizontal to neariy-vertical posture. Cooper and Conrad lost about 3½ and 4 kg respectively, but had gained most of it back. This loss might have been a response to the space environment but was believed to be partly water loss after reentry while waiting in the sun to be rescued, Berry said. Both seemed to be less tired than their predecessors.\n\nGemini V astronauts had demonstrated during their flight that a manned weather satellite could become a valuable part of Weather Bureau forecasting, Howard Simons reported in the Washington Post, on 2 September 1965. U.S. weather forecasters needed information on tropical storm Doreen moving through the Pacific. Cooper and Conrad observed the storm and fixed its position, acquiring the information earlier than TIRIS X meteorological satellite and more precisely than a ship 250 km from the storm. The San Francisco Weather Bureau Office had been able to combine Gemini V data with that from TIROS X to prepare an advisory on Doreen.\n\nAt news conference on 9 September 1965, Gordon Cooper and Charles Conrad recommended that, in future flights, both pilots sleep at the same time; more rehydratable foods be included in the diet; daily inflight exercises to compensate for muscular inactivity of the legs be included; the crew travel without spacesuits for greater comfort and flexibility; and that the training period be less compressed. The astronauts agreed that stowage had been the main problem throughout the flight. Any small little item that was misplaced or wasnt placed in the proper location seemed to muhiply, Cooper said. They had seen a great many micrometeorites, and one meteorite when it was reentering the atmosphere down below us. And on any night side, during a very short interval of time, you could see micrometeorites reentering.\n\n* * * * *\n\nCurrent overview: x"
