Propellant utilization and thrust control are other areas in which SMI has developed highly accurate and precise measuring and control systems. SMI's LOX Tanking Computer, which has been in production for the past year, accurately measures, controls and indicates the level of liquid oxygen in missile tanks. Loading is accomplished rapidly and accurately due to a unique two-mode control system. The first mode permits »-! extremely high pumping rates until about f 98% capacity is reached. The second mode then takes over and controls a precise propor- tioning valve which adds the necessary LOX to fill the tank within 0.1% accuracy. The second mode also pro- vides continuous topping, thus compensating for LOX evap- oration losses during standby. SMI has currently in development, more advanced fue management systems to meet the increasingly complex re- quirements of the next generation of missiles and spacecraft. SMI would welcome the opportunity to discuss and propose solutions to your fuel management problems. Write for descriptive literature.

NAVY launches Polaris vehicle from Cape Canaveral April 20 in reportedly successful test of primary flight objectives. missiles and rockets, May 4, 1959 5 editorial The Golden Field of Missile Support One of the most critical tasks facing the missile procurement people today is making Congress, the Services, the civilian administrators of the military, and the public realize that the tremendous cost of the program lies not in the missile itself but in its support equipment. Under that hard stand from which the Thor or Jupiter, Atlas or Titan is launched are miles of pipe, tubes and conduits. Under the stand or in the blockhouse and other shelter units are pumps of all kinds for liquid nitrogen, hydrogen and oxy- gen. There are pumps for gases, high- and low- presssure valves from a quarter of an inch to two feet in size. There are structural steel and sheet steel, tons of concrete, other tons of reinforcement, instruments of all kinds — sensors, recorders, gauges and computers. There are generators for electrical power, highly-automated check-out equipment, tubes, transistors and dials, trucks and hoists and fork lifts and elevators — and on and on and on. One Titan will cost approximately $2 million. A launching complex for a squadron of nine Titans will cost about $45 million. Sites for other missiles can be cheaper. Cost of Atlas locations will depend upon the degree of hardening, that is, protection. But multiply the cost of ICBM sites under any reasonable formula and you come up with an entirely new segment of American industry which inevitably will run into billions of dollars. This fact has not escaped the giants of Ameri- can industry: big steel, aluminum, the automobile colossi, the big foundries, the heavy equipment people. Said a Pentagon colonel in procurement: \"I was at an official party the other night. One of the top officials of U.S. Steel — not a division man but a top official of the parent company — backed me into a corner and questioned me for fifteen minutes on how to get into the support equipment business.\" Many of the big companies now looking over this field find themselves handicapped (unlike the big aircraft firms who have had an eye on it all along) by the lack of technical know-how. They are looking around for smaller companies with technical competence. Object: purchase, merger or simply to work as a team. The services are looking just as hard for this same competence and particularly for new methods, for many of the construction problems they face involve new problems where new techniques are demanded — at least, new techniques would be welcome. The Minuteman, for instance, will be operational in two to three years — but long before that time the Air Force must have trained crews and pre- pared sites to receive it. The Minuteman is a solid- fuel inter-continental missile with an approximate one megaton warhead. Its site is a hole in the ground — an inverted silo, some 100 feet deep, lined with concrete. Under present plans the Minuteman will be manufactured (by Boeing) by the hundreds. And each Minuteman means a hole in the ground lined with concrete. Digging that hole in the ground (multiplied sev- eral hundred times) is going to be a pretty expensive business. So is lining it with concrete strong enough to protect it up to, say, 100 psi from a near miss. It can be done with present methods, but the military would like to see someone come up with a new method of producing the hole — maybe by drilling, maybe by reducing the earth to liquid and sucking it out. Anyway — just so it is efficient and cheap. Said another Pentagon official: \"The man who can come up with a way to dig a 100-foot hole 20 feet in diameter for $50,000 is going to be digging more damned holes than this country has ever seen. And — mark my words — he won't be a big guy. He'll be a little guy with an idea.\" The same thought applies to lining the silo with reinforced concrete. Come up with a new method, a new idea, a way to do it fast and cheaply and there'll be a golden reward. It all adds up to the fact that ballistic missile cost is like the iceberg, four-fifths submerged. The weapon itself will get easier and easier to build as the skills in such spacecraft advance, but there is an equal — and for the moment, greater — need for advanced ingenuity in the parallel field of missile support equipment.

Washington countdown IN THE PENTAGON ARPA is fighting back to maintain its existence. However, the battle appears to be getting rougher — and more open. Many Pentagon foes of ARPA took heart from the demand by Maj. Gen. Bernard A. Schriever, newly-named Air Force R&D commander, that ARPA be abolished. • • • Some experts are betting the best the Navy can hope for in its Polaris program is a 1200-mile operational missile by the end of next year. But they say an 800-mile missile is far more likely. • • • The Army's satellite detection fence that went into operation in late March is reported to be working perfectly. The fence detected and located the orbit of the Discoverer II satellite shortly after it was launched April 13. Informed sources say the fence is capable of detecting any satellite whether or not the satellite is radioing a signal. . . . • • • The Air Force has completed a series of pre-contract tests of air-launched ballistic missiles at Cape Canaveral. Award of a contract for an Air Force ALBM is con- sidered imminent. ON CAPITOL HILL Congressmen are reading a hair- raising report put out by the House Military Operations Subcommittee. The report — the most authoritative of its kind to date — warns that Russia has a good and steadily improv- ing civil defense system. And it says the better Soviet CD gets the more America's deterrent strategy is undermined. But don't expect Congress to do much about it. The solution would cost billions. • • • Watch for a congressional investi- gation of how much — or how little — about the nation's space programs is being told the bill- footing taxpayers. The House Information Subcommittee can be expected to look into the matter. • • • The whole GOP strategy to hold the line on spending hundreds of millions more for ICBM's is being endangered by the White House. The GOP problem: President Eisenhower's insistence that Congress authorize hundreds of millions more for missiles for America's NATO allies. The foreign aid in- crease— little of it to come in FY 1960 — was recommended by the President's own foreign aid advisory committee. AT NASA Present schedule for the U.S. man- in-space program is: (1) a short-range flight down the Atlantic Missile range in a Redstone; (2) a simple orbital flight in the Project Mercury space capsule; (3) an advanced orbital flight in a maneuverable space vehicle; (4) an orbital flight of several days by a maneuver- able vehicle manned by seven men; (5) a per- manent manned orbiting space lab; (6) a manned flight to the vicinity of the moon; (7) manned landings on and return from the moon; (8) interplanetary flight. • • • Systems engineering on the Project Mercury vehicle will be done by NASA's Space Task Group and not the Air Force's Space Technology Laboratory as had been re- ported earlier. STL will be consulted about the Atlas booster, but the Space Task Group will do the actual mating of the various com- ponents and will recommend to NASA who the subcontractors should be. AROUND TOWN Diplomats are speculating on the effect of possible British entry into the East- West space race. The British are considering the possibility of using for satellite launching their new liquid Blue Streak missile which is still under development. One reason that some Englishmen are pushing a British space pro- gram is to halt the departure of British space experts for America. • • • Russia's next bid for leadership in space may not be a manned satellite as many have believed after all. Instead, Russia is re- ported to have given top priority to launching a spy-in-the-sky satellite — for peaceful pur- poses, of course.

PYOGENICS the Space Age CRYOPUMPING and the problems of space travel To simulate the conditions on the fringes of the Earth's atmosphere, engineers must produce ultra- high vacuums (10'8mm Hg or greater) and cryogenic temperatures approaching absolute zero ( — 459.69°F). Such conditions, until recently, were laboratory curi- osities produced on a limited scale. Today, by using cryopumping, large hypersimulation chambers can be designed and built to test both men and equipment under these extreme conditions. Cryopumping involves freezing out the atmosphere in a chamber to create both the ultra-high vacuums and the cryogenic temperatures required. Although its principle has long been known, only recently was cryopumping developed for practical, large-scale use by the University of Southern California Engineering Center and Arthur D. Little, Inc. The special ADL refrigerating unit used in USC's new hypersonic, low-density wind tunnel can cryopump more than 4 million cubic feet of nitrogen per minute at lO^mm Hg; at lower pressures, this pumping rate increases. It uses only 50 horsepower. Conventional vacuum pumping would require 500,000 horsepower!

Perry Washington — Top Defense planners are seriously studying highly classified missile industry proposals which, among other things, would involve creation of what may be known as a Strategic Ready Reserve of trained and experienced contractual personnel to substitute for uniformed servicemen in firing complex missile hardware in event of war. At least three prime weapon system contractors have submitted views which are being studied by the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Pentagon manpower utiliza- tion branches and the war colleges of the principal services, M/R has learned. If a decision were made for retali- atory \"button pushing,\" contractual personnel would immediately become military personnel subject to current Armed Forces regulations. The mili- tary-missile forces conceivably could be reduced to a skeleton force of tech- nologically competent career officers. An ultimate goal in the proposals is future weapon systems contracts in- cluding tactical staffing and operation in addition to design, development, manufacturing and testing. All but the first are now done by weapon system prime contractors, many of whom feel that if war comes tomorrow contractor personnel will have to do the firing because of lack of sufficiently trained service personnel. The dollar volume of prime con- tracts would swell to super-high figures, but on the other hand, industry spokes- men have told M/R, standing Armed Forces, their training and subsistence would be reduced far below the present 1.5 million manpower figure. • The problems — -Defense planners are seriously worried about the ability of military personnel to maintain and operate complex weapon systems. Training costs of service personnel climb to astronomical new highs each year. Coupled with this is the problem of service personnel turnover. After costly expenditures for training, service- men join the ranks of industry when they are trained and experienced, thus depriving the military of their services at a time of maximum usefulness. Another problem area is mobiliza- tion of reserve forces. Planners are ruling out any quick mobilization dur- ing all-out missile warfare. The time factor will not permit recruitment and training in complex weaponry or trans- port to aggressive warfare stations and duties. One proposal for utilization of manpower in reserve programs would be assignment to minor defensive roles and responsibilities and to take over duties presently vested in the virtually ineffective Civil Defense organization. These reserve forces would thus be used in a point defense concept with the Strategic Ready Reserve force manning critical posts. • When will it come? — Industry spokesmen believe that the first test of the Strategic Ready Reserve Force could come in the fleet ballistic missile program. The Navy is quietly wonder- ing whether service personnel can be trained — and retained — with the tech- nological qualifications to operate and service the hardware and support equip- ment necessary for instant retaliation. ■MERCURY CAPSULE TESTS AT WALLOPS ISLAND Island, Va.

In less than six months the first ase for the Boeing surface-to-air mis- le is scheduled to be opened at Mc- ruire AFB, N.J. At any time now the first greatly- nproved Bomarc-B will streak from !ape Canaveral where the new model 'ill begin undergoing flight tests. Within the next year to two years quadrons of nuclear warhead-packing tomarcs will be stationed across the ation at from seven to 14 air defense ases — most probably more. The first two will be equipped with he more than 200-mile range Bo- narc-A. The rest will be equipped with he more than 400-mile range Bomarc-B. • Air Force vs. Army — The final mmber of bases to be set up hangs on he outcome of the bitter competition >etween the Air Force's Bomarc and he Army's Western Electric Nike- lercules. Gen. Thomas D. White. Air Force :hief of staff, has said 40 Bomarc bases :ould protect the entire country from ittack by manned aircraft. The first two Bomarc bases are ex- acted to have 60 launchers. The rest ire expected to have about 30. Bomarc-B's at any one base will be ible to hit targets within a half-million square mile area. The entire area of Jie United States is about 3 million jquare miles. However, any Bomarc base-building Drogram of such magnitude would be :ertain to mean the end of the Nike- Hercules program. And, at least at pres- snt, nothing of the sort is being planned by the Defense Department. • Defense in depth — Defense Sec- missiles and rockets, May 4, 1959 retary Neil H. McElroy told Congress only recently that both weapon systems are needed: the 75-mile range Nike- Hercules for point defense; the much longer range Bomarc for area defense. McElroy said the Nikes and Bo- marcs used in combination with manned interceptors provide the nation with \"defense in depth.\" Richard E. Horner, Assistant Air Force Secretary, said the Bomarc could be used to do \"the Nike job.\" But he said it \"would not give its greatest de- fense capability per dollar in that kind of task.\" However, a recently completed re- port by former Assistant Defense Sec- retary Louis Furnas gave the Bomarc an enthusiastic boost. The result is ex- pected to be a speed-up in the program — including the release of more funds for base construction and possibly the naming of three more base sites. • Bases to date — At present a total of 14 base sites have been chosen. The first four and the order in which they are scheduled to be completed are: McGuire; Suffolk County AFB, N.Y.; Otis AFB, Mass.; and Dow AFB. Maine. The 10 others chosen are: Langley AFB, Va.; Kinross AFB, Mich.; Ni- agara Falls Municipal Airport, N.Y.; Truax Field, Wis.; Duluth Municipal Airport, Minn.; Paine AFB, Wash.; Camp Adair, Oregon; Travis AFB, Calif.; Vandenberg AFB, Calif.; Ethan Allen AFB, Vt. But of the last 10 funds have been released only for Langley, Kinross and Duluth. By the end of next month the Army is scheduled to have 62 battalions of Nikes — both the 35-mile Ajax and the Hercules — protecting key targets around the country. • Ten-year program — The Bomarc program dates back to 1949. The first production unit of the Bomarc-A was completed in December, 1957. The Bomarc-A is powered by an Aerojet-General liquid rocket and two Marquardt Aircraft ramjet engines. The Bomarc-B is powered by a Thiokol solid propellant rocket and improved Mar- quardt ramjets. Both models travel a; speeds greater than Mach 2.5. Both tl\\ at altitudes of about 70,000 feet. The appearance of both models is the same. They are 47 feet long, have an 18-foot wing span and weigh about 15.000 pounds. More than a yea? ago much more advanced \"C\" and \"D\" models were contemplated by Boeing, but the plans were scrapped on grounds that they were not feasible. • Guide and Guided — The Bomarc is integrated with the IBM-SAGE com- puter system which is used to fire the missile and guide it to the vicinity of its target. The computer then releases control and the missile's target-seeker homes on the target. No actual collision is necessary. The Bomarc is armed with a proximity fuse. A test Bomarc-A has been launched from Cape Canaveral by a SAGE com- puter 1500 miles away at Kingston, N.Y., and successfully guided to its target. Bomarc-A' s also have been fired in salvos at different targets from the Air- Proving Ground at Eglin AFB, Fla. The Bomarc-B's are scheduled to be tested for about a month at Cape Canaveral. Then the testing will be switched to Eglin. The Air Force an- ticipates little difficulty. 15 THE DEATH OF A MISSILE One of 40,000 parts fails and a 75-foot bird of space blows up to end a rare association between man and machine — as pho- tographed exclusively for Missiles and Rockets by Cornell Capa by Erica M. Karr A two-inch newspaper story, datelined Edwards Air Force Base, March 27, gave this explanation of the explosion opposite: A captive Atlas missile exploded on its test stand here today. There were no casualties. The same Atlas — Model 60 — had completed numerous other test firings at the base. The missile was destroyed. Cause of the accident was not disclosed. The missile had performed most of its test objectives when the accident occurred. Story behind this story developed in the block- house where famed photographer Cornell Capa was set up to snap \"the new breed of young white- collared engineers\" who build on man's space hopes. The \"routine test,\" after two days of false starts, had ended in the worst ground disaster ever suffered by an Atlas, and the new breed of men, after months of working closely with their massive steel bird, suffered with it. Capa catches the spirit of the block- house story from the first \"pep talk\" briefing, through the moment when the deafening explosion shook the ground and blew up $2-million worth of missile. At first the Air Force reported only that \"nothing fundamental or systematic\" was involved in the blow-up but — as later pieced together from Air Force and other sources — the complete story is both human and dramatic. The captive test firing was first attempted on March 26 after completion of prefiring preparations. This try was called off when electrical difficulties were encountered in the propellant system and traced to \"excessive moisture in an electrical connector.\" The connector was replaced and countdown opera- tions for the firing started at 10:55 the next morn- ing. All went well until T-minus 55 minutes when a hold was called to check the booster engine's auto pilot null position. All clear again, and the count was recycled to T-minus 60 minutes and continued without further difficulty. At 1:35 p.m. — T-minus O — a normal engine start and the transition to main stage operation were achieved. Then one of the tubes in the \"spaghetti\" tube network of the engine cracked, spewing out a small stream of fuel, and causing a fire followed by a small explosion in the engine's thrust section. This was recorded at 43 seconds. At 54 seconds, a larger explosion and fire destroyed the missile. \"Disabling of equipment and controls,\" resulting from initial explosion, was given by the Air Force as the cause of the final explosion. It was later re- ported by other sources that the sensor for the ground pressurization system had stopped indicating, allowing an excess of pressure to build up. Air Force ended its report with this statement: (Continued on page 20) issiles and rockets, May 4, 1959 PRE-TEST BRIEFING has air of a before-the-game pep talk as all hands get a run-through on aims, roles, timing and a bid for close cooperation. missiles and rockets, May 4, 1 959' BAD NEWS at 1:35 p.m. explosion, recorded on the television monitors is reflected in the faces of the blockhouse crew as the reality of the catastrophe sinks in. \"Because of elaborate safety precautions, no per- sonnel were injured and damage was confined to the test stand and superstructure and nearby ground support equipment.\" Questioned after the explosion, spokesmen at Convair Division, General Dynamics Corp., where the missile is under production, said the Atlas had undergone \"hundreds\" of such tests and that this was the first time one had exploded on the ground. \"We've been real lucky for quite a while on engines,\" a spokesman said. \"When you're dealing with thou- sands of parts (more than 40,000 not counting subsystems), any one of these can fail. But that's what the tests are for — to find any weak spots.\" He pointed out that in Atlas tests the sami failure has never shown up more than twice. \"By the third run, we have always had that particulai bug licked.\" A top Convair official expressed \"high corw fidence\" in Atlas' reliability. \"The V-2 achieved 80% reliability out of 4000 flights,\" he said. \"I have no doubt we will achieve at least this. We anj awfully close to that now and this is still a develop- ment program.\" 20 missiles and rockets, May 4, I959j Reason why failure of one missile part can end n such a major catastrophe is the amount of energy nvolved. An Atlas burns in 15 seconds about the lame amount of fuel as that of a DC-7 on an entire :ross-country trip. While the explosion rocked the countryside it ilso rocked the men in the blockhouse.

Said one: \"I knew every pore of that bird.\" That theirs is not \"just another job\" is quickly evident to the blockhouse observer. The challenging needs of the new space field have given rise to a new type of technician and engineer determined to meet them. Sporting crew cuts, white collars, bow ties and a sense of purpose and dedication, many of them live with their jobs 24 hours a day. Some admit waking up out of a sound sleep to ponder a problem. Others dream about them. Emotional involvement with their machines is common among them and when one fails there is a sense of personal CAPT. DAVID FRAZER, BMD representative, and Donald Fagan of Convair confer with fire marshal. disappointment. When one disintegrates before their eyes, as in this case, it is taken like the passing of an old friend. A rare team spirit pervades the blockhouse. It is keenly felt first during the pre-test briefings, when all hands, including the outside crewmen, are given a run-through in an atmosphere of a before- the-game pep talk. Every eye is riveted on the test conductor as he explains aim of the test, timing, roles and asks for a perfect record with everybody giving it everything he has: \"Your full coopera- tion and attention is essential.\" It would be in keeping with the tenor of the scene if he wound up the meeting with the rousing admonition: \"Our team must win!\" In this Atlas test things moved like, and by, clockwork until the first delay, then picked up again until the second holdoff broke the tension. As the countdown started again, from a relaxed beginning, the technicians were soon busy again directing their full attention to the job at hand. NOTHING LEFT but the beak of the bird in id nest. Ground crew man takes last look. Anotheq will one day lift the first U.S. manned capsule spa At T-O, all eyes were on the television monitor. First reaction, as the moment of truth hit, was one of complete disbelief, then reluctant recognition followed by speculation on the cause of the explo- sion. The fire marshal gave assurances that no one was hurt and the job of gathering up the yards of recording paper that charted each minute phase of the operation was begun. Last to leave the blockhouse was test conductor Donald Fagan of Convair. The men filed out leaving him slumped behind his console and went to take a last look at the smoking and torn hulk of what was left of their once proud space machine. Atlas has now undergone 23 test flights. Out of the last 14, which had complete systems, nine were reported to have been completely successful with four of the 14 recorded from 25% to 90% successful. An Atlas powered by Rocketdyne engines will lift the first U.S. manned space capsule. Mercury, under contract from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Atlas fabrication began in San Diego in 1955 with first engine tests run at Edwards in June 1956. Completed missiles were delivered to Syca- more and Cape Canaveral that fall. Convair's associate contractors, in addition to Rocketdyne, include General Electric Co. and the Burroughs Corp., radio-inertial guidance (to be followed by American Bosch Arma Corp., all-iner- tial guidance). General Electric Co. and Avco, nose cone; and Sundstrand Turbo Division (formerly American Machine and Foundry), airborne ac- cessory power supply.

TEST Expanding the Frontiers of Space Technology Testing is a vital part of every stage in the development of missile and space programs at Lockheed Missiles and Space Division. The Division maintains one of the most completely equipped missile and space test laboratories in the world. Equipment includes: altitude, temperature and humidity chambers; shaker and vibration systems; G-accelerators; and apparatus capable of performing chemical, metal- lurgical, plastic, heat transfer, hydraulic, pneumatic, shock, acceleration, sinusoidal and random vibration, structural, electrical, and electronic tests. Static field test- ing; research and development testing on controls; testing in ordnance and hydraulics and high-pressure gas and propulsion systems are conducted at the 4,000 acre, company-owned test base in the Ben Lomond mountains near Santa Cruz, California. Flight testing is conducted at Cape Canaveral, Florida; Alamogordo, New Mexico; and Vandenberg AFB near Santa Maria, California; in a unique manner. All com- ponents and sub-systems of a new project are initially tested on known-performance, production missiles. Thus, when the final system is ready for first flight, its individual components already have flight-tested reliability. This new concept of flight testing has enabled Lockheed to produce extremely complex missile systems in record time and at greatly reduced expense. Underwater launch tests — including studies of cavita- tion, wave simulation and skip motion — are carried on at the Sunnyvale facility and at the Navy test base on San Clemente Island. In addition, structural and other tests are performed at Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard, California. If you are experienced in any of the various phases of testing, we invite your inquiry.

SUNNYVALE. PALO ALTO. VAN NUYS. SANTA CRUZ. SANTA MARIA. CALIFORNIA CAPE CANAVERAL. FLORIDA • ALAMOGORDO. NEW MEXICO • HAWAII How Far to Go with Redundancy? Duplication seems to be on the increase in industry, hut many experts call for limits on the expensive and risky practice by Charles D. LaFond Washington — Many design engi- neers are questioning the wisdom of unrestrained or unnecessary use of cir- cuit and equipment redundancy. It is admitted that by careful investigation and analysis, weak spots in an elec- tronic system can be predicted and should be strengthened or compensated for. But how far should this be per- mitted to go? Is it better for the design engineer to duplicate relatively high-fail-poten- tial equipment or circuit elements without limit — or should more time and effort be spent in creating better circuit design with more reliable and longer-lived components? This is not meant to imply that redundant con- figurations should not be used, but that their use should not be the excuse for avoiding the betterment of conven- tional circuits. The use of redundant circuitry for achieving higher equipment reliability appears to be on the increase. Just how much industry is using it at present is not known, but certainly a great deal of time, effort, and money is being spent in studying the feasibility of du- plicating equipment and circuits in electronic systems. The requirement for redundancy is based on the sometime need for sys- tems in which no single component failure can be permitted to cause a system failure or even severe per- formance degradation. For those not too familiar with the term, there are several kinds of redundancy: • Parallel-redundancy involves the use of two (or more) identical units or \"chains\" of equipment. If a unit fails, its counterpart still provides ade- quate performance. With proper de- sign, some of the unit pairs produce an additive output; that is, together they achieve a higher-than-minimum performance. • This same system, employing parallel-redundancy, may have some missiles and rockets, May 4, 1959 units that cannot be operated together. Here, standby-redundancy can be em- ployed. The duplicate equipments are connected in such a manner that one is in operation while the other is a \"'hot\" operating spare, or standby. Some type of failure-detector switching device is included for control. • Circuit-redundancy is an internal type of duplication. As a result of careful analysis during developmental stages of an equipment, the failure probability of some subsystem circuitry may be determined to be too high. To correct this, an additional circuit is added (where possible) for each weak link. Necessary relay- or switching cir- cuitry must be included also. Since redundancy is a method for improving reliability, the latter should be explained. Reliability can be defined as the probability of a unit performing its function as designed for a minimum time period and under given opera- tional environments. • Past use — Parallel and dual back- up equipments have been employed successfully — albeit expensively — for many years. Commercially, the radio and television industry has utilized ex- tensively the philosophy of operating standby systems. Equipment and main- tenance costs are far outweighed by the potential losses in advertising money and audience in case of station failure or rapid transmission degradation. The military currently is a principal advo- cate of this concept for obvious reasons. Because equipment reliability is -Antennas for BMEWS- GIANT RADAR tracking antennas are being built by Goodyear Aircraft for the Air Force BMEWS installation. Mounted on 30-foot pedestals in 140-foot diameter radomes, the antennas are among the largest ever made. They will provide a radar fence in the Far North to detect and track enemy ICBM's as they appear above the horizon. The work is being done by Goodyear under a multi-million-dollar contract with RCA, system prime contractor. Air Force AMC has primary responsibility for the project. 25 missile electronics New Way to \"Grow\" Germanium not always high enough for their needs, the extra costs must be weighed against such factors as the saving of human lives and achieving minimum warning time for retaliatory offensive operations. • Redundancy studies — Studies per- formed at Hughes Aircraft Company have shown that internally redundant systems using standard parts are con- siderably more reliable than conven- tional systems using specially chosen components. But they have indicated that although the failure probability can be reduced by a factor of \"hun- dreds or more\" system redundancy should be used with great discretion. These systems, said S. Nozick of Hughes, are heavier, larger, and re- quire more maintenance. He stated that internal redundance should be favored only when system failure is very criti- cal in terms of human life or money. External functional redundance — the technique of relying on all or part of another system to replace functionally the failed system — should be consid- ered by designers as an alternative to internal redundance. Speaking of a well-integrated de- velopmental team designing a highly reliable system with a suitable redund- ant configuration, Nozick said: \"... a closely coordinated group with high morale can invent its way out of the problems that usually arise.\" He also warned that consideration must be given to the fact that parallel or re- dundant circuitry might relax the con- trol required on components or sub- systems during equipment construction and component specification. • Future reliability — In the present state of the art of redundant circuit design, the requirement for specially trained engineering groups needed to develop these systems is paramount. Although reliability can be improved substantially, redundancy is always ex- pensive and frequently inadequate. The answer to achieving higher re- liability seemingly does not lie with redundant design as we know it, but the technique is an effective and exist- ing tool. One potential source for increasing circuit redundancy, especially in mis- silery, is in the future use of semi- conductor \"solid-circuitry\" developed by Texas Instrument Co. and Westing- house. Because of the small size and weight and very low power needed, these functional circuits may offer a vastly different kind of redundancy in years to come. Andrews AFB. Md.— Westing- house Electric Corporation's process for \"growing\" germanium crystals in uniform, thin, flat ribbons has earned it a $2-million development contract from the Air Research and Develop- ment Command. In addition. Westing- house's use of this material to create \"functional\" solid state circuits is an- other step toward revising current elec- tronic design concepts. In announcing the contract award by Wright Air Development Center, Maj. Gen. lohn W. Sessums, Jr., com- mander ARDC, said it was part of a broad program effort in this new field of molecular electronics. The development centers on the method of growing the crystals, since the final product eliminates the need for tedious and costly slicing and pol- ishing heretofore required. Westing- house scientists said the manufactur- ing technique permits growing the ma- terial in the exact form in which it can be used for practical application in transistors and other semiconductor components. A result of a new knowledge of the structure of material, the company be- lieves the new method will radically im- prove existing transistor manufacturing processes. Westinghouse already envi- sions machines turning out finished transistors at high speed directly from on input of raw germanium and the two or three other materials needed to complete the device. The new technique for growing DR. BENNETT, codeveloper of new growth process, and the new germanium ribbons. germanium was the work of two West- inghouse research physicists, Dr. R. L. Longini and Dr. A. I. Bennett, both of the laboratories' solid state physics de- partment. \"The ease of processing dendritic germanium into usable form contrasts sharply with present practices,\" the Westinghouse scientists said. \"To pro- cess conventional germanium ingots into useful form, they must be sliced into thin wafers somewhat like a loaf of bread is cut into slices. Because ger- manium is so hard and brittle, the cut- ting is done with a diamond-tipped saw, and each slice has to be three to five times the desired thickness simply to ' keep it from shattering. \"The slices must then be ground down to the required thickness, further cut into small squares, and finally polished. Only then is the germanium ready to be fashioned into finished transistors or other devices. As a result of all this cutting and polishing, about 80% of the original ingot is thrown away as germanium 'sawdust.' \" Not only is dendritic germanium of the proper thickness for direct use, said the scientists, but its ultra-smooth, mir- ror-like surfaces need no grinding or polishing of any kind. • Functional circuits blocks — Re- search results to date indicate that the new process and the use of functional semiconductor circuits may lead to the development of outer-space electronic equipment 1000 times smaller and lighter than anything now in existence. In describing foreseeable products re- sulting from the Air Force's develop- ment program, Col. Clarence H. Lewis, director of ARDC's Electronics Direc- torate, said the concept could take the average pocket-sized transistor radio circuitry excluding the power supply and speaker down to the size of the head of a match.\" In use, these very small pieces of crystal could perform the functions that now require as many as a dozen present-day components using conven- tional circuitry, Col. Lewis said. He added that two possible functions of the minute equipment are the sensing of environmental conditions and transmit- ting the data to any desired location. Feasibility studies are being conducted on infrared, reconnaissance, flight con- trol, communications, and other mili- tary applications. As an example of the size and weight reductions possible under the 26 missiles and rockets, May 4, 1959 - lew concept, Col. Lewis said that the aost modern system used today to neasure the intensity of light in space las a volume of about one cubic inch ind a weight of approximately seven ;rams. The Air Force has conducted dem- mstrations with a Westinghouse light elemetry subsystem which has a rolume of 0.001 cubic inch and a total veight of 0.2 gram. This equipment tot only measures change in light in- ensity but also produces a signal cap- ible of transmission to relate the de- ;ree of change in intensity. The number of component parts in he telemetry subsystem was cut from 4 to 1 and the number of soldered :onnections was reduced from 15 to 2, hereby offering a tremendous potential o reliability, Col. Lewis said. Dhio State Team Makes .ow-Cost Radio Telescope Washington — A unique radio tele- cope being built by a \"professor-stu- lent\" team of Ohio State University vill permit mapping the sky at a mini- num cost. Scheduled to be ready for opera- ion in 1960, the telescope will consist 3f a fixed paraboloidal antenna, a flat iltable reflector, and associated radio receiving equipment. Both 360 feet long, the fixed dish is 70 feet high ind the tiltable antenna is 100 feet riigh. Collecting area of the latter is ;quivalent to that of a 170-foot di- ameter steerable dish and it costs about 90% less. Under the direction of Dr. John D. Kraus and three non-student assist- ants, the system is now in construc- tion. The project is supported by three National Science Foundation grants totaling $272,650 and two university grants totaling $21,600. A 20-acre site has been donated by Ohio Wesleyan which also will control the surrounding land to prevent any operational inter- ference. Radio waves from the sky area under observation will be received on the tiltable antenna, reflected hori- zontally to the fixed dish, and then directed to the receiver system for recording. All components of the telescope will be in fixed position on the ground. The earth's rotation brings new radia- tion sources in the sky into the field covered by the telescope. In a 24-hour period, a narrow band entirely across the sky can be \"mapped.\" Changing the angle of the tiltable reflector will move the band of observation up or down, so that eventually a large part of the sky can be fully mapped. The design of the telescope is suffi- ciently flexible to capture and identify radiation from a wavelength of 21 cen- timeters up to about 20 meters. The geometry of its design provides that regardless of the angle of the tiltable reflector, radiation striking it will be deflected via the fixed antenna to the receiver. Structural problems arising from mounting receivers high in the air on movable antennas are also avoided in Dr. Kraus' cost-saving de- sign. This telescope will not be able to follow an object across the sky as well as steerable dish antennas can, but will depend primarily upon the earth's rotation for its collecting area. hush-hush?

During the last two weeks of April, evaluation teams, numbering close d 100 technical experts, descended on lie Martin Co. in Baltimore and the (oeing Airplane Co.'s Pilotless Air- raft Division in Seattle for an on-the- pot appraisal to guide the 20-man election board. Winner of this two- vay contest will walk off with a con- ract which may eventually total $650 trillion to develop Dyna-Soar (from lynamic soaring). The Air Force has asked Congress or $109.8 million in new obligational lUthority for Dyna-Soar in Fiscal Year 960, with actual expenditures to run 0 $73 million in that period. The manned boost-glide vehicle will lave a global capability. Initially, it vill be developed as a prototype test ystem to explore the flight region >eyond that of the X-15, and extend- ng to near-satellite velocities and alti- udes. It will be a ground-launched, step- :ype vehicle, initially boosted to very righ altitude and speed by ballistic mis- jile boosters which fall away from the |mpowered, man-carrying last-stage ;lider. It will be a \"laboratory\" for j'athering information needed in later |;pace development work. One military role envisioned for ater versions is in the \"missile storage in space\" concept. Idea would be to lave earth continually ringed with or- )iting hydrogen-missile-carrying Dyna- foars which would be controlled from 1 space station, eliminating the need for vulnerable ground facilities and advance warning systems. These could be unleashed for instant retaliation wherever needed. It is estimated that $1.2 billion annually could maintain such a defense network. • Line-ups — Each of the two com- peting industrial giants is backed up by a group of companies ready to pool their technical resources in a new approach to system building — the com- pany team concept as opposed to the prime-subcontractor systems.

Boeing, which also has Good- year on its team, has in addition North American Aviation, Aerojet, Chance Vought Aircraft, General Electric, RCA, and Ramo-Wooldridge. Dr. Walter Dornberger, originator of the Dyna-Soar project, and recently named as engineering director of Bell Aircraft's Niagara Frontier Division, is sure that the contract will go to the Martin-Bell team. If so, the ex-German rocket expert will direct work on de- velopment of the glider vehicle. Asked \"If not?\", Dornberger replied: \"Then we will work on another version of Dyna-Soar or satellite interceptors, res- cue ships, maintenance and supply ships, a shuttle rocket to space stations or the final stage of a moon rocket.\" • Dornberger's vision — Dr. Dornber- ger is a longtime booster of the team approach to space flight and raised some eyebrows during last year's meeting of the National Missile Indus- tries Conference when he said in a speech: \"We cannot afford competition for contracts to build space ships. \"In the coming years we will see only a few industrial combines able to develop big space ships. By pooling facilities, brains and manpower, they alone will provide the necessary capa- bility and productive power to which the nation may hand the technological responsibility in the Space Age.\" Dornberger is an old hand at new concepts, dating back to 1930 when he found himself heading a small group in Germany's Army Ordnance Division which had been directed to make mod- ern weapons out of rockets. Later, the man who was to become Wernher von Braun's boss directed the 17,000-man Peenemunde rocket operation which developed and launched the V-2's dur- ing World War II. Dornberger began pushing the idea of the rocket-boosted glider soon after he came to Bell Aircraft in 1950. Bell, in turn, started pushing it with the Air Force in 1952 when it was called Bomi for bomber-missile; but it was not until Russia launched Sputnik 1 that the Pentagon worked up any enthusiasm and got the ball rolling. • Forceful — The father of Dyna-Soar is a man of strong opinions who ex- presses them in clipped, colorful. Ger- man-accented pronouncements illus- trated with forceful gestures. Said one science reporter after a Dornberger press conference: \"He's the world's only human who speaks in technicolor and stereophonic sound.\" Although his Prussian manner and opinionatedness rub many newspaper- men the wrong way, his sweeping as- sertions always make lively copy. Sample quotes: Education — Our system is all wrong. Everyone who has the brains and guts should get a higher education despite lack of money. Vanguard — Vanguard was a mis- take. We should have used existing hardware. We would have had a satel- lite up sooner. Goals — The future problem is no longer to bring a couple of tons of pay- load into orbit but to bring 20, 30 or even more tons at any spot in space with the correct direction and speed. nissiles and rockets, May 4, 1959 29 Manned vs. unmanned — Space can only be utilized effectively by manned vehicles. An automatic space vehicle would necessarily have to be so com- plex that the possibility of its failure in space would be tremendous. Space will be conquered by man and not by ma- chines. Anti-missile missiles — Practically useless. Out of 100 ballistic missiles shot at us, 90 would get through with the present state of the art on anti- missile missiles. Long-range planning — We should agree on a line of priorities for the next 20 years to survive as a free na- tion. Priorities should run in this order: (1) long-range ballistic missiles; (2) data-gathering research vehicles for cis- lunar space; (3) all weapon system, manned or unmanned, in cis-lunar space; (4) data-gathering research ve- hicles for trans-lunar space; (5) space vehicles for commercial application; (6) prestige flights; (7) stunt flights. Space Race — Russia may put a man-carrying satellite into orbit within the next year. It may take us three years to do this. Royalties for scientists — Creative thinking and imaginative engineering should be paid for . . . the government should guarantee a share in the profit of later production for the original creative mind. Need for speed in the space race — / have lost two world wars. 1 did not come to this country to lose World War III. • Nazi failure — If the Nazi wheels had listened to Dornberger, the history of World War II might well have been different. But despite Dornberger's urging, Germany's rocket-weapon pro- gram went into high gear too late. Getting it off the ground had been for a long time literally a go, no-go proposition. Gen. Prof. Dr. Karl Becker, head of the Board of Ord- nance, had trouble laying his hands on the money needed to launch this \"out- landish\" idea; finally in 1932 he or- dered all Ordnance divisions to con- tribute 10% of their budget to Dorn- berger's project. In all it cost $300 million to de- velop the V-2. There was not much in the way of previous rocket research and the team had to start from scratch: How big? How much payload? What distance? \"I sat down with Von Braun and an artilleryist and we arbitrarily decided to make the payload 100 times that of the Parisian 10-pound gun with over twice its distance of 50 miles. Size was determined by the tunnels and streets 30 through which it would be trans- ported.\" First successful firing of the V-2 was not until October, 1942, and there were 36 more before they achieved a second successful firing — \"A lot ex- ploded on the ground; we had no tele- metering system, either, to tell us what was wrong.\" When problems came up, Dorn- berger said, \"I put my men in a room and told them 'You get nothing to eat until you come to a conclusion.' By 1943 they had achieved 50% relia- bility, by 1945 — 78% and they were firing 30 a day. Von Braun, now director of the Army's missile development at Red- stone Arsenal, recalling his early years with his old chief, told M/R: \"Dr. Dornberger and I first met in 1932 when I was a student at the Tech- nical University of Berlin, and it marked the beginning of 13 years of close association and the beginning of a rocket development program with far-reaching implications. \"Selling the new ideas of rocket propulsion and promoting and fighting for the support of adequate programs to fully develop its potentials, was a tremendous undertaking. It required courage, dedication and passionate per- severance. Dr. Dornberger led us from the shortcomings of our 1932 presen- tations and transformed our youthful enthusiasm into sober engineering plans. \"He is a man of profound technical knowledge, imagination and the ability to combine the technically feasible with Dyna-Soar's early explorations through the atmospheric fringes will erase many of the question marks con- founding man as he plans for space exploration. The rocket-boosted glider will be a bridge between aerodynamic and space flight. It could be used for bombing, reconnaissance and scientific and commercial missions. The domain of the Dyna-Soar will be that area between the ceiling for air-breathing engines — almost 19 miles up — and the floor for. satellites — slightly over 93 miles up. Excursions out of this area will pose some prob- lems, not the least of which will be temperature. The glider's return to earth will be controlled from the ground, as will positioning in orbit. In its early flights, Dyna-Soar prob- ably will be unmanned and will be recovered after several orbits by an the militarily sound and practicabl These, together with his personal to erance and warmhearted understandi for the capabilities, limitations and p sonal problems of his associates, ma Dr. Dornberger the greatest sin force behind German rocket devel ment. And he shared with his youn associates the deep fascination for limitless challenge of future space ploration. \"He was to me a courageous, therly friend who, in many dangero and critical situations, in particu during the declining months of Hitle Germany, never let me down.

Today, Dornberger, whose life the most part was focused high ab the clouds, has completed long-ran plans for ending it there: \"I want to the first man buried in space. When die I want my ashes put in a glass and carried up by a manned space caa. sule to orbit in eternity.\" \"Von Brauj said he will take them up there,\" sal Dornberger, eyes twinkling.

The work of Julian Allen and A. J. Eggers indicates that blunt shapes with high-pressure drag would be most efficient for skip glid- ing since these characteristics mini- mize aerodynamic heating, particularly for relatively light vehicles. Later vari- ations of this concept include the lentil configuration which would enter the atmosphere at an angle of attack of 90°. in this way acting as a blunt shape. Another possibility is a blunt- nosed vehicle, which after achieving entry would rotate to 180° so that a low-drag \"tail\" becomes the leading element. Bell's Dyna-Soar reportedly will have the blunt-nosed Allen con- figuration. Dyna-Soar will not skip as it glides down at slow deceleration and its shape will be based on a high lift- over drag factor. The Lentil configura- tion will probably emerge in one of the later Dyna-Soar versions. Bell Aircraft's mock-up of Dyna- Soar, still under security wraps, was viewed by the Air Force's evaluation team on its appraisal visit to The Martin Co., Baltimore, last week. • Human factor — Keeping the pilot comfortable under the space-equiva- lent conditions he faces in Dyna-Soar means that for the region near or be- low the glider's flight planners must cope with the vapor pressure of body fluids in mammals — 47 mm Hg (63,- 000 ft.). Oxygen supply will not be as much of a problem as in orbiting vehicles because flights can be short. Acceleration and vibration will be similar to those in the launching and flight of a satellite and can be kept to similar levels during re-entry. One aim is to allow the crew to function with- out confinement of pressure suits or thermal shields. • Power — Early versions of the glider could be satisfactorily launched by existing rocket boosters — Titan, for example. However, later versions will be larger and heavier to achieve ma- neuverability in space; hence increased booster capability will be necessary7. Thought must be given to recoverable boosters, apart from the already re- coverable final stage, for economy rea- sons. An air-breathing first stage might be used; then re-use would be a neces- sity. • Rendezvous — To meet orbiting objects in space, the glider will need vernier adjustments in velocity. If the orbiting vehicle is radiating elctro- magnetic energy, homing on this source could be achieved within the vehicle. The power required for the glider to \"jump\" orbit is comparable to that in the original launch. In time these ve- hicles will be large enough to carry ade- quate propellants for making major modifications to orbits. A vehicle weighing 11.000 pounds coming from a satellite orbit must dis- sipate 1.58 x 1010 kgm of energy (11.45 x 1010 ft. lbs.) before it lands. Accord- ing to Dr. Everett T. Welmers of Bell Aircraft Corp., most of this must be achieved by radiation. \"A solution to this design problem which has been developed at Bell is the use of the 'double wall' structure,\" Dr. Welmers reports. \"The outer wall, ex- posed to the airstream, is allowed to heat up to very high temperatures. Radiation from this surface back to space is approximately proportional to the fourth power of the temperature. The inner wall, which carries the struc- tural loads, is shielded from the hot outer face by a layer of insulation and is further cooled by liquid passing through tubes attached to its surface. In this way all but a small percentage of the aerodynamic heating is re-radi- ated, the load-carrying structure is sub- jected to temperatures of about 200°F and thermal problems for equipment and crew inside the double wall become very simple.\" The outer wall is of Inconel and can take over 2000° F. The inner wall is of aluminum. Atmospheric density at 328,000 feet is such that the vehicle could maneuver at less than .01 g through aerodynamic forces. At 246,000 ft., aerodynamic pullout will be about one-third g's; at 180.500 ft., a maximum of about 2.5 g's. Below this altitude, structural limi- tations are likely to be more influential than aerodynamic forces. • Landing — Between the time the pilot decides to land and actual touch- down Dyna-Soar will have traversed from one quarter to several times the earth's circumference. If re-entry and slowdown come off as scheduled, the vehicle, brought in by the automatic landing system, will be able to land within a rectangle of 2x5 miles. Tests at Bell Aircraft have achieved this with planes and guided missiles. Both the Air Force and Navy have proposed that a coordinating body be set up for the Atlantic and Pacific mis- sile range tracking networks — first for the Mercury project, then for Dyna- Soar. This is currently being discussed, at least by the Air Force and NASA. • Background- — Before the V-2 pro- gram roared into high gear and halted work on it. the glide vehicle conceived by a German team under Dornberger's direction worked like this; The A-9, a variation of the V-2, was to carry under it another vehicle weighing 191 thousand pounds. Termed the A-10, this rocket booster would have a 50 to 60-second thrust to 440,000 pounds and a velocity of 2700 mph. At the A-I0's burnout, the A-9 would ignite. It would begin its supersonic glide at 35 miles altitude and travel a distance of 2500 miles. This was based in part on the earlier work of E. Saenger and I. Bredt. Russia's glide-bomber work has re- sulted in the three-stage T-4A test ve- hicle. It is believed to have a 264.000- lb. liquid rocket first stage supple- mented by two solid-propellant rockets. The second stage used the same liquid rocket and the third stage a 77.000-lb. rocket. It is estimated that take-off weight is over 231.000 lbs. and that it reaches a maximum altitude of 235 miles with ranges of 500 to 12.500 miles with top velocities of 5000-6500 m/sec.

Boyce, Jr.* Baltimore — Brazing alloys avail- able until now have made production of brazed steel honeycomb structures both difficult and expensive. The chief problem: uneven filleting caused by rapid flow of the alloy and its poor resistance to corrosion. These limitations have been over- come in a new dispersion-hardened alloy developed by the Baltimore Divi- sion of the Martin Co. The alloy is produced according to established powder metallurgy tech- niques. The initial distribution of the aluminum oxide in the metal matrix follows a method developed by R. H. *Research Institute for Advanced Studies, The Martin Co. COMPLETELY BRAZED panel using aluminum oxide dispersion-hardened braz- ing alloy. missiles and rockets, May 4, 1959 Read while he was investigating the properties of dispersion-hardened cop- per. Read dispersed the aluminum ox- ide in copper oxide by wet milling the appropriate mixture. This method is superior to mixing copper directly with alumina, because the latter method yields a smeared matrix and a non-uniform mixture. Since the oxide is harder than the parent metal, it is broken up readily without noticeable plastic flow and smearing. Following the milling operation the mixture is heated in a hydrogen at- mosphere where the copper oxide is reduced to copper while the alumina, being very stable, remains unaffected. The powder is then pressed and processed by the usual powder metal- lurgy techniques. • Fine screening — In the develop- ment of the Martin brazing alloy, the copper oxide was replaced by another oxide. The mixture was ball-milled wet in a conventional mill for two to three weeks. After drying, the powder was screened through a -180 mesh sieve to eliminate any large particles and treated in a hydrogen atmosphere at 75°-100°C for 2Vz hours to reduce the oxide of the matrix to the metal, the alumina remaining unchanged. The power was screened again through a -100 mesh sieve in prepara- tion for briquetting. It was poured and leveled at a depth of 0.029 inches in a \"push through\" die having a rectangu- lar opening of 1 3/8 x AYi inches and SMALL FURNACE is used to sinter briquetted powders at Martin Company's Baltimore facility. 33 RAYTHEON- DESIGNED Hawk missile annihilates radio-controlled F-80 jet fighter at 500 ft. altitude.

S. cities. RAYTHEON MANUFACTURING COMPANY, Waltham, Mass. 34 missiles and rockets, May 4, 1959 >ressed at 200 tons. The most desirable ;ize for the finished briquette prior to intering was 0.050 inch thickness. The iriquettes were then sintered at 1700°C or two hours and reheated prior to the oiling operations for a minimum of ive minutes at 1700T. With the roll opening set 0.008 nches less than the briquette thickness, :ach briquette was hot rolled in a mill. The roll opening was subsequently re- iuced 0.004 inches prior to each heat- ing and rolling operation and each briquette was given three passes :hrough the rolls after each heating ;ycle. The heating and rolling opera- tions stopped when the material reached a thickness of 0.020 inches. It was subsequently cold rolled. • Fluxing agent needed — By con- tinually decreasing the roll opening until the rolls were completely closed, eventually the material was reduced to a foil 0.001 inches thick. The finished foil was then ready for evaluation as a brazing alloy. In the preliminary tests the alu- minum oxide dispersion-hardened alloy would not wet steel very readily at 1800°F and 1900°F. It was thus evi- dent that a fluxing agent was required in conjunction with the new filler alloy. A foil of 99.7% silver alloy con- taining 0.3% lithium was placed in contact with the dispersion-hardened foil and the combination placed be- tween the skin and the honeycomb. During the brazing cycle the lithium in the silver-lithium foil was concen- trated enough to flux the core and the skin very thoroughly. Thus a successful brazed joint was achieved. • Psi increased — A difference was noted between the flow of the silver- lithium and the composite alloy con- sisting of a layer of silver-lithium and the dispersion-hardened alloy. Speci- men of 17-7PH stainless steel brazed with the silver-lithium showed slightly more flow than the other specimens brazed with the composite material. Secondly, evaluation tests indicated the strength of the lap joints containing the dispersion-hardened silver was around 17,000 psi, whereas the silver- lithium joint yielded shear strengths of 11,500 psi. Thus a definite strength in- crease was shown which prompted further investigation and application. Honeycomb panel brazed with com- mercially available brazing alloy pro- duced areas of no brazing caused by starvation of the top surface. However, no starvation appeared after brazing with silver dispersion-hardened material. The Martin Company is proceeding to braze larger and more complex panels. It is continuing the investiga- tion of other fluxing agents and tech- niques and adding particles other than missiles and rockets, May 4, 1959 aluminum oxide as the hardening medium. • No adhesive — Extremes of high and low temperatures in the environ- ment of supersonic weapons systems have clearly shown the need for new materials and manufacturing processes for the fabrication of aircraft and mis- siles that can endure this environment. The design of the weapons systems that will be operational in the early 1960's is far ahead of the industrial ability to manufacture them. The selec- tion of stainless steel as the material to be used in these systems, because of its characteristic resistance to extremes of temperature, has brought on the prob- lem of how to join the parts of an assembly. With slower flying aluminum planes, adhesive bonding was adequate since the operational temperatures were never high enough to affect the adhe- sive bond. But with temperatures high enough to require the use of stainless steel, an adhesive bond is rendered useless. The only solution is to use a metal joint capable of enduring such an environment. Brazing seemed to offer the answer until experiments showed that avail- able brazing alloys flowed too readily. This caused the bottom joint to be too heavy and the top joint too light or to have no braze at all. Also these fillers showed a poor resistance to corrosion which could not be tolerated. It was these deficiencies in the ex- isting brazing alloys that convinced Martin that development of a new alloy was imperative. • Future significance — Brazing ac- complished with this new alloy shows that a sound, strong brazed structure with even filleting can be attained with none of the defects attendant on the use of other alloys. It also allows an opening of the tolerances since the sluggishness of the melted alloy allows it to stay where it is placed and bridge the increased gap between skin and core. These properties were first sus- pected by Dr. Howard R. Peiffer dur- ing basic metallurgical experiments with silver a{ the Research Institute for Advanced Studies. Important as this development is at present, its use in the missiles and space ships of the near future will show the real significance of this process.

Maj. Gen. D. N. Yates, commander] of the half-billion-dollar test center,! told M/R that Canaveral's present overall facilities could handle five times; the present number of rocket launch-: ings \"without spending another dime.\" Some critics have charged the test center's capacity for handling rocket launchings was a roadblock to speeding: up the nation's space program. Yates said there are only two rea- sons why the center isn't launching more rockets: • More launchings are not called for in particular rocket development programs. • Or, additional rockets are not available. Moreover, he said the center has room for increasing possibly 15 to 20| times the amount of testing including many new type rockets in the years ahead. \"We already are planning for test programs that we only are imagining,\" he said. \"Huge rockets for space ex- ploration projects that so far aren't even programmed.\" Yates also said he thought the day is fast coming when both the U.S. At- lantic and Pacific Missile Ranges along with other missile ranges around the world must centrally coordinate their tracking and monitoring facilities. \"This type of coordination will be essential for such programs as Project Mercury and Dyna-Soar,\" he said. On other developments, Yates said: • The United States can have a man in orbit within a \"year or so\" under the current man-in-space program. However, much remains to be done before the goal can be achieved. • U.S. engineers have developed a successful method for cutting off opera- tion of solid propellant rockets in flight. The method being used is classified. • The Boeing Minuteman, when ready for testing from the Cape, will be fired from a model of the inverted silos that will be used later to house Minutemen at hardened ICBM bases. • Planning is underway for building facilities for testing the Martin Persh- ing and the 1.3-million-pound-thrust Saturn at the Cape. missiles and rockets, May 4, 1959 NOTABLE ACHIEVEMENTS AT JPI JPL PIONEERING CONTINUES WITH THE LAUNCHING OF THE FIRST SUCCESSFUL AMERICAN MOON PROBE ^ The JPL tracking station at Goldstone in the Mo/'ave Desert in California Early on March 3, 1959, Pioneer IV space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral, Florida to become America's first deep-space vehicle capable of escaping the earth's gravitational pull. On its way past the moon and out into lorbit around the sun, this new man-made I planet sent back valuable information on 'the radiations present in space. Several Free World tracking stations clearly received its transmitted signal and helped to establish its distance, velocity, and direction. Under the sponsorship of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, JPL designed and built not only the con- ical payload of Pioneer IV but also the three upper stages of the Juno II launching vehicle, containing new high- performance JPL solid propellant rockets. Over a year ago the same JPL team, in cooperation with ABMA, gave America its first earth satellite, Explorer I, using a similarly reliable vehicle-the Jupiter C. Now, more advanced space vehicle programs are under way at JPL— pro- grams which include development of guidance and propulsion systems for accurate maneuvers many million miles from the earth.
