The transition metal catalyst comprises a Group 8 metal and a ligand containing one or more 2-electron donor atoms. The present invention is also directed to enantioselective reactions of amine compounds with compounds containing carbon-carbon double bonds, and a calorimetric assay to evaluate potential catalysts in these reactions.\n\nThe Existence of a Designer Al=Al Double Bond in the LiAl2 H4- Cluster Formed by Electronic Transmutation.\n\nPubMed\n\nLundell, Katie A; Zhang, Xinxing; Boldyrev, Alexander I; Bowen, Kit H\n\n2017-12-22\n\nThe Al=Al double bond is elusive in chemistry. Herein we report the results obtained via combined photoelectron spectroscopy and ab initio studies of the LiAl 2 H 4 - cluster that confirm the formation of a conventional Al=Al double bond. Comprehensive searches for the most stable structures of the LiAl 2 H 4 - cluster have shown that the global minimum isomer I possesses a geometric structure which resembles that of Si 2 H 4 , demonstrating a successful example of the transmutation of Al atoms into Si atoms by electron donation.

Rotation around these bonds contributes to conformational and energetic disorder and therefore potentially limits charge delocalisation, whereas the use of transition metals presents difficulties for sustainability and application in biological environments. Here we show that a simple aldol condensation reaction can prepare polymers where double bonds lock-in a rigid backbone conformation, thus eliminating free rotation along the conjugated backbone. This polymerisation route requires neither organometallic monomers nor transition metal catalysts and offers a reliable design strategy to facilitate delocalisation of frontier molecular orbitals, elimination of energetic disorder arising from rotational torsion and allowing closer interchain electronic coupling. These characteristics are desirable for high charge carrier mobilities. Our polymers with a high electron affinity display long wavelength NIR absorption with air stable electron transport in solution processed organic thin film transistors.\n\nPancake ÏâÏ Bonding Goes Double: Unexpected 4e/All-Sites Bonding in Boron- and Nitrogen-Doped Phenalenyls\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nTian, Yong-Hui; Sumpter, Bobby G.; Du, Shiyu; ...\n\n2015-06-03\n\nPhenalenyl is an important neutral pi-radical due to its capability to form unconventional pancake pi-pi bonding interactions, whereas its analogues with graphitic boron (B) or nitrogen (N)-doping have been regarded as closed-shell systems and therefore received much less attention.

H2XP:HNNH and H2XP:FNNH complexes are stabilized by PN pnicogen bonds, except for H2(CH3)P:FNNH and H3P:FNNH which are stabilized by N-HP hydrogen bonds. H2XP:HNCHOH complexes are stabilized by PN pnicogen bonds and nonlinear O-HP hydrogen bonds. For a fixed H2XP molecule, binding energies decrease in the order HNCHOH > HNNH > FNNH, except for the binding energies of H2(CH3)P and H3P with HNNH and FNNH. Binding energies of complexes with HNCHOH and HNNH increase as the P-N1 distance decreases, but binding energies of complexes with FNNH show little dependence on this distance. The large binding energies of H2XP:HNCHOH complexes arise from a cooperative effect involving electron-pair acceptance by P to form a pnicogen bond, and electron-pair donation by P to form a hydrogen bond. The dominant charge-transfer interaction in these complexes involves electron-pair donation by N across the pnicogen bond, except for complexes in which X is one of the more electropositive substituents, CCH, CH3, and H. For these, lone-pair donation by P across the hydrogen bond dominates. AIM and NBO data for these complexes are consistent with their bonding characteristics, showing molecular graphs with bond critical points and charge-transfer interactions associated with hydrogen and pnicogen bonds. EOM-CCSD spin-spin coupling constants (1p)J(P-N) across the pnicogen bond for each series of complexes correlate with the P-N distance. In contrast, (2h)J(O-P) values for complexes H2XP:HNCHOH do not correlate with the O-P distance, a consequence of the nonlinearity of these hydrogen bonds.\n\nDouble proton transfer behavior and one-electron oxidation effect in double H-bonded glycinamide-formic acid complex.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Ping; Bu, Yuxiang\n\n2004-11-22\n\nThe behavior of double proton transfer occurring in a representative glycinamide-formic acid complex has been investigated at the B3LYP/6-311 + + G( * *) level of theory. Thermodynamic and, especially, kinetic parameters, such as tautomeric energy, equilibrium constant, and barrier heights have been discussed, respectively. The relevant quantities involved in the double proton transfer process, such as geometrical changes, interaction energies, and intrinsic reaction coordinate calculations have also been studied. Computational results show that the participation of a formic acid molecule favors the proceeding of the proton transfer for glycinamide compared with that without mediate-assisted case. The double proton transfer process proceeds with a concerted mechanism rather than a stepwise one since no ion-pair complexes have been located during the proton transfer process. The calculated barrier heights are 11.48 and 0.85 kcal/mol for the forward and reverse directions, respectively. However, both of them have been reduced by 2.95 and 2.61 kcal/mol to 8.53 and -1.76 kcal/mol if further inclusion of zero-point vibrational energy corrections, where the negative barrier height implies that the reverse reaction should proceed with barrierless spontaneously, analogous to that occurring between glycinamide and formamide. Furthermore, solvent effects on the thermodynamic and kinetic processes have also been predicted qualitatively employing the isodensity surface polarized continuum model within the framework of the self-consistent reaction field theory. Additionally, the oxidation process for the double H-bonded glycinamide-formic acid complex has also been investigated. Contrary to that neutral form possessing a pair of two parallel intermolecular H bonds, only a single H bond with a comparable strength has been found in its ionized form. The vertical and adiabatic ionization potentials for the neutral complex have been determined to be about 9.40 and 8.69 e\n\nReactions of the linear tetranuclear complex Ru sub 4 (CO) sub 10 (CH sub 3 C double bond C(H)C(H) double bond N-i-Pr) sub 2 with oxidizing reagents.

This process is reversible; ie., passing a stream of nitrogen through a solution of 4a-c or removal of the solvent under vacuum causes the reverse reaction with reformation of 3a-c.

Owing to the electron deficiency of boron, chemical bonding in the B 36 cluster is intriguing, complicated, and has remained elusive despite a couple of papers in the literature. Herein, a bonding analysis is given through canonical molecular orbitals (CMOs) and adaptive natural density partitioning (AdNDP), further aided by natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis and orbital composition calculations. The concerted computational data establish the idea of concentric double Ï aromaticity for the B 36 cluster, with inner 6Ï and outer 18Ï electron counting, which both conform to the (4n+2) HÃ¼ckel rule. The updated bonding picture differs from existing knowledge of the system. A refined bonding model is also proposed for coronene, of which the B 36 cluster is an inorganic analogue. It is further shown that concentric double Ï aromaticity in the B 36 cluster is retained and spatially fixed, irrespective of the migration of the hexagonal hole; the latter process changes the system energetically. The hexagonal hole is a destabilizing factor for Ï/Ï CMOs. The central hexagon hole affects substantially fewer CMOs, thus making the bowl-shaped C 6v B 36 cluster the global minimum.

Derivatization of the DDD arrays with electron-withdrawing groups increases the complex association constants by up to a factor of 30 in those arrays examined. Derivatization of the AAA arrays with electron donating substituents reveals a similar magnitude effect on the complex stabilities. The effect of substitution on both types of arrays are modeled quite satisfactorily (R(2) > 0.96 in all cases) as free energy relationships with respect to the sums of their Hammett substituent constants. In all, the complex stabilities can be manipulated over more than three orders of magnitude (>20 kJ mol(-1)) using this type of modification. Copyright Â© 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

A lot can be learned by considering how electron density is distributed, on average, in the average field of the other electrons in the system. That is, mean field theory. However, to describe quantitatively chemical bonds, reactions, and spectroscopy requires consideration of the way that electrons avoid each other by the way they move; this is called electron correlation (or in physics, the many-body problem for fermions). While great progress has been made in theory, there is a need for incisive experimental tests that can be undertaken for large molecular systems in the condensed phase. Here we report a two-dimensional (2D) optical coherent spectroscopy that correlates the double excited electronic states to constituent single excited states. The technique, termed two-dimensional double-coherence spectroscopy (2D-DQCS), makes use of multiple, time-ordered ultrashort coherent optical pulses to create double- and single-quantum coherences over time intervals between the pulses. The resulting two-dimensional electronic spectrum maps the energy correlation between the first excited state and two-photon allowed double-quantum states. The principle of the experiment is that when the energy of the double-quantum state, viewed in simple models as a double HOMO to LUMO excitation, equals twice that of a single excitation, then no signal is radiated. However, electron-electron interactionsâa combination of exchange interactions and electron correlationâin real systems generates a signal that reveals precisely how the energy of the double-quantum resonance differs from twice the single-quantum resonance. The energy shift measured in this experiment reveals how the second excitation is perturbed by both the presence of the first excitation and the way that the other electrons in the system have responded to the presence of that first excitation. We\n\nQ-Band Electron-Nuclear Double Resonance Reveals Out-of-Plane Hydrogen Bonds Stabilize an Anionic Ubisemiquinone in Cytochrome bo3 from Escherichia coli.\n\nPubMed\n\nSun, Chang; Taguchi, Alexander T; Vermaas, Josh V; Beal, Nathan J; O'Malley, Patrick J; Tajkhorshid, Emad; Gennis, Robert B; Dikanov, Sergei A\n\n2016-10-11\n\nThe respiratory cytochrome bo 3 ubiquinol oxidase from Escherichia coli has a high-affinity ubiquinone binding site that stabilizes the one-electron reduced ubisemiquinone (SQ H ), which is a transient intermediate during the electron-mediated reduction of O 2 to water. It is known that SQ H is stabilized by two strong hydrogen bonds from R71 and D75 to ubiquinone carbonyl oxygen O1 and weak hydrogen bonds from H98 and Q101 to O4. In this work, SQ H was investigated with orientation-selective Q-band (â¼34 GHz) pulsed 1 H electron-nuclear double resonance (ENDOR) spectroscopy on fully deuterated cytochrome (cyt) bo 3 in a H 2 O solvent so that only exchangeable protons contribute to the observed ENDOR spectra. Simulations of the experimental ENDOR spectra provided the principal values and directions of the hyperfine (hfi) tensors for the two strongly coupled H-bond protons (H1 and H2). For H1, the largest principal component of the proton anisotropic hfi tensor T z' = 11.8 MHz, whereas for H2, T z' = 8.6 MHz. Remarkably, the data show that the direction of the H1 H-bond is nearly perpendicular to the quinone plane (â¼70Â° out of plane). The orientation of the second strong hydrogen bond, H2, is out of plane by â¼25Â°. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations on a membrane-embedded model of the cyt bo 3 Q H site show that these H-bond orientations are plausible but do not distinguish which H-bond, from R71 or D75, is nearly perpendicular to the quinone ring. Density functional theory calculations support the idea that the distances and geometries of the H-bonds to the ubiquinone carbonyl oxygens, along with the measured proton anisotropic hfi couplings, are most compatible with an anionic (deprotonated) ubisemiquinone.\n\nProgramming Recognition Arrays through Double Chalcogen-Bonding Interactions.\n\nPubMed\n\nBiot, Nicolas; Bonifazi, Davide\n\n2018-04-11\n\nIn this work, we have programmed and synthesized a recognition motif constructed around a chalcogenazolo-pyridine scaffold (CGP) that, through the formation of frontal double chalcogen-bonding interactions, associates into dimeric EX-type complexes. The reliability of the double chalcogen-bonding interaction has been shown at the solid-state by X-ray analysis, depicting the strongest recognition persistence for a Te-congener. The high recognition fidelity, chemical and thermal stability and easy derivatization at the 2-position makes CGP a convenient motif for constructing supramolecular architectures through programmed chalcogen-bonding interactions.

O3 has longer and weaker bonds than O2, whereas SO2 has shorter and stronger bonds than SO. The O-O2 bond is dramatically weaker than the O-SO bond, and the singlet-triplet gap in SO2 is more than double that in O3. In addition, O3 is a very reactive species, while SO2 is far less so. These disparities have been attributed to variations in the amount of diradical character in the two molecules. In this work, we use generalized valence bond (GVB) theory to characterize the electronic structure of ozone and sulfur dioxide, showing O3 does indeed possess significant diradical character, whereas SO2 is effectively a closed shell molecule. The GVB results provide critical insights into the genesis of the observed difference in these two isoelectronic species. SO2 possesses a recoupled pair bond dyad in the a\"(Ï) system, resulting in SO double bonds. The Ï system of O3, on the other hand, has a lone pair on the central oxygen atom plus a pair of electrons in orbitals on the terminal oxygen atoms that give rise to a relatively weak Ï interaction.\n\nEffect of double-layer application on bond quality of adhesive systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nFujiwara, Satoshi; Takamizawa, Toshiki; Barkmeier, Wayne W; Tsujimoto, Akimasa; Imai, Arisa; Watanabe, Hidehiko; Erickson, Robert L; Latta, Mark A; Nakatsuka, Toshiyuki; Miyazaki, Masashi\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to determine the effect of double-layer application of universal adhesives on the bond quality and compare to other adhesive systems. Two universal adhesives used were in this study: Scotchbond Universal (SU), [3M ESPE] and Prime & Bond elect (PE), [Dentsply Caulk]. The conventional single-step self-etch adhesives G-Ónial Bond (GB), [GC Corporation.] and BeautiBond (BB), [Shofu Inc.], and a two-step self-etch adhesive, Optibond XTR (OX), [Kerr Corporation], were used as comparison adhesives. Shear bond strengths (SBS) and shear fatigue strengths (SFS) to human enamel and dentin were measured in single application mode and double application mode. For each test condition, 15 specimens were prepared for SBS testing and 30 specimens for SFS testing. Enamel and dentin SBS of the universal adhesives in the double application mode were significantly higher than those of the single application mode. In addition, the universal adhesives in the double application mode had significantly higher dentin SFS values than those of the single application mode. The two-step self-etch adhesive OX tended to have lower bond strengths in the double application mode, regardless of the test method or adherent substrate. The double application mode is effective in enhancing SBS and SFS of universal adhesives, but not conventional two-step self-etch adhesives. These results suggest that, although the double application mode may enhance the bonding quality of a universal adhesive, it may be counter-productive for two-step self-etch adhesives in clinical use.

The analysis includes different rotation angles, distance between apexes, as well as distinct types of antiphase boundaries. The calculations indicate that the non-rotated configuration of double-walled nanocone with a defective line composed by C and N atoms, forming C-N bonds, is the most stable configuration. It was found that the yam angle, apexes distance and defective line composition present significant influence on the electronic properties of such structures. Moreover, analyzing the spin charge density, for the electronic states near the Fermi level, it was also found that the configuration with a defective line containing C atoms presents a net magnetic moment.\n\nA Simple Visualization of Double Bond Properties: Chemical Reactivity and UV Fluorescence\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nGrayson, Scott M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA simple, easily visualized thin-layer chromatography (TLC) staining experiment is presented that highlights the difference in reactivity between aromatic double bonds and nonaromatic double bonds.

The two equations are also comparable with those, = 1.43( /r)-0.21, determined for a large number of oxide crystals at ambient conditions and = 1.39(/r)-0.22, determined formoreÂ Â» geometry optimized hydroxyacid molecules, that connect the bond lengths to the average Pauling electrostatic bond strength, , for the M-O bonded interactions. On the basis of the correspondence between the two sets of equations connecting Ï(rc) and the Pauling bond strength s with bond length, it appears that Paulingâs simple definition of bond strength closely mimics the accumulation of the electron density between bonded pairs of atoms. The similarity of the expressions for the crystals and molecules is compelling evidence that the M-O bonded interactions for the crystals and molecules 2 containing the same bonded interactions are comparable. Similar expressions, connecting bond lengths and bond strength, have also been found to hold for fluoride, nitride and sulfide molecules and crystals. The Brown-Shannon bond valence, Ï, power law expression Ï = [R1/(R(M-O)]N that has found wide use in crystal chemistry, is shown to be connected to a more universal expression determined for oxides and the perovskites, = r[(1.41)/]4.76, demonstrating that the bond valence for a bonded interaction is likewise closely connected to the accumulation of the electron density between the bonded atoms. Unlike the Brown-Shannon expression, it is universal in that it holds for the M-O bonded interactions for a relatively wide range of M atoms of the\n\nElectron-electron correlation in two-photon double ionization of He-like ions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHu, S.

Understanding the dynamic electron correlation in the photoionization of relatively simple quantum three-body systems, such as He and He-like ions, is an important step toward manipulating complex systems through photoinduced processes. Here we have performed ab initio investigations of two-photon double ionization (TPDI) of He and He-like ions (L i+,B e2 + , and C4 +) exposed to intense attosecond x-ray pulses. Results from such fully correlated quantum calculations show weaker and weaker electron correlation effects in TPDI spectra as the ionic charge increases, which is opposite to the intuition that the absolute increase of correlation in the ground state should lead to more equal energy sharing in photoionization. These findings indicate that the final-state electron-electron correlation ultimately determines the energy sharing of the two ionized electrons in TPDI.\n\nElectron-electron correlation in two-photon double ionization of He-like ions [Counterintuitive electron correlation in two-photon double ionization of He-like ions\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nHu, S.

Four different one-step self-etch adhesives were selected for the study (iBondSE, Clearfil S(3) Bond, XenoV(+), and Scotchbond Universal). Adhesives were applied according to manufacturers' instructions or with a double-layer application technique (without light curing of the first layer). After bonding, resin-dentin specimens were sectioned for microtensile bond strength testing in accordance with the nontrimming technique and divided into 3 subgroups of storage: a) 24 hours (immediate bond strength, T0), b) six months (T6) in artificial saliva at 37Â°C, or c) five hours in 10 % NaOCl at room temperature. After storage, specimens were stressed to failure. Fracture mode was assessed under a light microscope. At T0, iBond SE showed a significant increase in microtensile bond strength when the double-application technique was applied. All adhesive systems showed reduced bond strengths after six months of storage in artificial saliva and after storage in 10% NaOCl for five hours; however at T6, iBond SE, Clearfil S(3) Bond, and XenoV(+) showed significantly higher microtensile bond strength results for the double-application technique compared with the single-application technique. Scotchbond Universal showed no difference between single- or double-application, irrespective of the storage conditions. The results of this study show that improvements in bond strength of one-step self-etch adhesives by using the double-application technique are adhesive dependent.\n\nA new fluorogenic sensing platform for salicylic acid derivatives based on Ï-Ï and NH-Ï interactions between electron-deficient and electron-rich aromatics.\n\nPubMed\n\nPandith, Anup; Hazra, Giridhari; Kim, Hong-Seok\n\n2017-05-05\n\nA novel simple fluorescent probe was designed for the recognition of electron-rich salicylic acid derivatives (SAs). The imidazole-appended aminomethyl perylene probe 1 selectively differentiated between electron-rich amino-SAs and electron-deficient nitro-SAs in EtOH, exhibiting the highest selectivity and sensitivity toward 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and showing strong 1:1 binding (K a =1.37Ã10 7 M -1 ). This high selectivity and sensitivity resulted from the synergistic multiple hydrogen bonding interactions of secondary amine and imidazole units and Ï-Ï interactions between electron-rich and electron-deficient rings, along with the unusual NH-Ï interactions between 5-ASA and the perylene moiety of 1. The limit of detection (LOD) for 5-ASA in EtOH was 0.012ppb. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

A weak adduct of 7 with benzonitrile (8) was detected by NMR spectroscopy, but could not be isolated. tert-Butyl isocyanide afforded a similar, but isolable adduct (9), in which the isocyanide C atom was coordinated to aluminium. The unique reactivity of 7 became evident from its reactions with the heteroatom substituted nitriles PhO-C[triple bond, length as m-dash]N, PhCH2S-C[triple bond, length as m-dash]N and H8C4N-C[triple bond, length as m-dash]N. Hydrophosphination of the C[triple bond, length as m-dash]N triple bonds afforded imines at room temperature which were coordinated to the FLP by Al-N and P-C bonds to yield AlCPCN heterocycles (10 to 12). These processes depend on substrate activation by the FLP. Diphenylcyclopropenone and its sulphur derivative reacted with 7 by addition of the P-H bond to a C-C bond of the strained C3 ring and ring opening to afford the fragment (Z)-Ph-C(H)[double bond, length as m-dash]C(Ph)-C-X-Al (X = O, S). The C-O or C-S groups were coordinated to the FLP to yield AlCPCX heterocycles (13 and 14). The thiocarbonyl derived compound 14 contains an internally stabilized phosphenium cation with a localized P[double bond, length as m-dash]C bond, a trigonal planar coordinated P atom and a short P[double bond, length as m-dash]C distance (168.9 pm). Insight into formation mechanisms, the structural and energetic properties of FLP 7 and compounds 13 and 14 was gained by quantum chemical DFT calculations.\n\nDouble-bond-containing polyallene-based triblock copolymers via phenoxyallene and (meth)acrylate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nDing, Aishun; Lu, Guolin; Guo, Hao; Huang, Xiaoyu\n\n2017-03-01\n\nA series of ABA triblock copolymers, consisting of double-bond-containing poly(phenoxyallene) (PPOA), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), or poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) segments, were synthesized by sequential free radical polymerization and atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). A new bifunctional initiator bearing azo and halogen-containing ATRP initiating groups was first prepared followed by initiating conventional free radical homopolymerization of phenoxyallene with cumulated double bond to give a PPOA-based macroinitiator with ATRP initiating groups at both ends. Next, PMMA-b-PPOA-b-PMMA and PBA-b-PPOA-b-PBA triblock copolymers were synthesized by ATRP of methyl methacrylate and n-butyl acrylate initiated by the PPOA-based macroinitiator through the site transformation strategy. These double-bond-containing triblock copolymers are stable under UV irradiation and free radical circumstances.\n\nTungsten Hydride Phosphorus- and Arsenic-Bearing Molecules with Double and Triple W-P and W-As Bonds.\n\nPubMed\n\nAndrews, Lester; Cho, Han-Gook; Fang, Zongtang; Vasiliu, Monica; Dixon, David A\n\n2018-05-07\n\nLaser ablation of tungsten metal provides W atoms which react with phosphine and arsine during condensation in excess argon and neon, leading to major new infrared (IR) absorptions. Annealing, UV irradiation, and deuterium substitution experiments coupled with electronic structure calculations at the density functional theory level led to the assignment of the observed IR absorptions to the Eâ¡WH 3 and HEâWH 2 molecules for E = P and As. The potential energy surfaces for hydrogen transfer from PH 3 to the W were calculated at the coupled-cluster CCSD(T)/complete basis set level. Additional weak bands in the phosphide and arsenide W-H stretching region are assigned to the molecules with loss of H from W, Eâ¡WH 2 . The electronic structure calculations show that the Eâ¡WH 3 molecules have a W-E triple bond, the HEâWH 2 molecules have a W-E double bond, and the H 2 E-WH molecules have a W-E single bond. The formation of multiple E-W bonds leads to increasing stability for the isomers.\n\nA general mixture equation of state for double bonding carboxylic acids with â¥2 association sites\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMarshall, Bennett D.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nIn this paper, we obtain the first general multi-component solution to Wertheim's thermodynamic perturbation theory for the case that molecules can participate in cyclic double bonds. In contrast to previous authors, we do not restrict double bonding molecules to a 2-site association scheme. Each molecule in a multi-component mixture can have an arbitrary number of donor and acceptor association sites. The one restriction on the theory is that molecules can have at most one pair of double bonding sites. We also incorporate the effect of hydrogen bond cooperativity in cyclic double bonds. We then apply this new association theory to 2-site and 3-site models for carboxylic acids within the polar perturbed chain statistical associating fluid theory equation of state. We demonstrate the accuracy of the approach by comparison to both pure and multi-component phase equilibria data. It is demonstrated that the 3-site association model gives substantially a different hydrogen bonding structure than a 2-site approach. We also demonstrate that inclusion of hydrogen bond cooperativity has a substantial effect on a liquid phase hydrogen bonding structure.\n\nHindered Csbnd N bond rotation in triazinyl dithiocarbamates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJung, Taesub; Do, Hee-Jin; Son, Jongwoo; Song, Jae Hee; Cha, Wansik; Kim, Yeong-Joon; Lee, Kyung-Koo; Kwak, Kyungwon\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe substituent and solvent effects on the rotation around a Csbnd N amide bond were studied for a series of triazine dibenzylcarbamodithioates. The Gibbs free energies (ÎGâ¡) were measured to be 16-18 kcal/mol in DMSO-d6 and toluene-d8 using variable-temperature nuclear magnetic resonance (VT-1H NMR) spectroscopy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduced the experimental observations with various substituents, as well as solvents. From the detailed analysis of the DFT results, we found that the electron donating dibenzyl amine group increased the electron population on the triazinyl ring, which decreased the rotational barrier of the Csbnd N bond in the dithiocarbamate group attached to the triazinyl ring. The higher electron population on the triazine moiety stabilizes the partial double bond character of the Ssbnd C bond, which competitively excludes the double bond character of the Csbnd N bond. Therefore, the rotational dynamics of the Csbnd N bond in dithiocarbamates can be a sensitive probe to small differences in the electron population of substituents on sulfur.\n\nPhotoisomerization around a fulvene double bond: coherent population transfer to the electronic ground state?\n\nPubMed\n\nIoffe, Ilya; Dobryakov, Alexander L; Granovsky, Alexander A; Ernsting, Nikolaus P; Lustres, J Luis PÃ©rez\n\n2011-07-11\n\nPhotoisomerization around a central fulvene-type double bond is known to proceed through a conical intersection at the perpendicular geometry. The process is studied with an indenylidene-dihydropyridine model compound, allowing the use of visible excitation pulses. Transient absorption shows that 1) stimulated emission shifts to the red and loses oscillator strength on a 50 fs timescale, and 2) bleach recovery is highly nonexponential and not affected by solvent viscosity or methyl substitution at the dihydropyridine ring. Quantum-chemical calculations are used to explain point 1 as a result of initial elongation of the central C=C bond with mixing of S(2) and S(1) states. From point 2 it is concluded that internal conversion of S(1)âS(0) does not require torsional motion to the fully perpendicular state. The S(1) population appears to encounter a sink on the torsional coordinate before the conical intersection is reached. Rate equations cannot model the observed ground-state recovery adequately. Instead the dynamics are best described with a strongly damped oscillatory contribution, which could indicate coherent S(1)-S(0) population transfer. Copyright Â© 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

EXAFS results show that with increasing pressure up to 7.5 GPa, the average Nb-O bond distance decreases in agreement with the expected compression and tilting of the NbO6 octahedra. On the contrary, above 7.5 GPa, the average Nb-O bond distance show a tendency to increase. Significant changes in the Nb K-edge XANES spectrum with evident low energy shift of the pre-peak and the absorption edge is found to happen in La1/3NbO3 above 6.3 GPa. These changes evidence a gradual reduction of the Nb cations from Nb(5+)âtowards Nb(4+) above 6.3 GPa. Such a valence change accompanied by the elongation of the average Nb-O bond distances in the octahedra, introduces repulsion forces between non-bonding adjacent oxygen anions in the unoccupied A-sites. Above a critical pressure, the Nb reduction mechanism can no longer be sustained by the changing local structure and amorphization occurs, apparently due to the build-up of local strain. EXAFS and XANES results indicate two distinct pressure regimes having different local and electronic response in the La1/3NbO3 system before the occurence of the pressure induced amorphization atâââ¼14.5 GPa.\n\nOn the nature of bonding in binary Be2O2 and Si2O2 clusters: rhombic four-center four-electron Ï and Ï bonds.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Kang; Wang, Ying-Jin; Li, Da-Zhi; Ou, Ting; Zhao, Xiao-Yun; Zhai, Hua-Jin\n\n2016-04-14\n\nThe structural and electronic properties and chemical bonding of binary Be2O2 and Si2O2 clusters have been studied using quantum chemical calculations at the B3LYP level. For the Be2O2 cluster, the potential energy surface is probed by unbiased structural searches and the global-minimum structure was established using the B3LYP calculations, complemented by PBE0 and single-point CCSD(T) calculations for top isomers. The perfectly planar D2h Be2O2 ((1)Ag) global minimum is well defined, being at least 3.64 eV lower in energy than alternative structures at the CCSD(T)//B3LYP/aug-cc-pVTZ level. Chemical bonding analyses show that D2h Be2O2 and Si2O2 clusters possess the rhombic four-center four-electron (4c-4e) Ï bond, that is, the o-bond, a conception derived from electron-deficient boron oxide clusters lately. Furthermore, the Be2O2 and Si2O2 clusters also exhibit rhombic 4c-4e Ï bonds, both for the radial and tangential Ï frameworks (Ïr and Ït). The Ït framework is classified as an o-bond only formally, due to the secondary contribution from the Be/Si s component. The three-fold (Ï, Ïr, and Ït) o-bonds in Be2O2 and Si2O2 are considered to resemble the three-fold aromaticity in all-metal Al4(2-) dianions. A 4c-4e o-bond makes use of four O 2p electrons, which would otherwise be two lone-pairs, for a delocalized and completely bonding orbital, as well as a residual nonbonding orbital. Three-fold o-bonds thus greatly stabilize the binary Be2O2 and Si2O2 clusters. We anticipate that the bonding concept should be applicable to additional molecular systems, including those with larger heterocyclic rings.\n\nPhysiological and glycomic characterization of N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase-IVa and -IVb double deficient mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTakamatsu, Shinji; Antonopoulos, Aristotelis; Ohtsubo, Kazuaki; Ditto, David; Chiba, Yasunori; Le, Dzung T.; Morris, Howard R.; Haslam, Stuart M.; Dell, Anne; Marth, Jamey D.; Taniguchi, Naoyuki\n\n2010-01-01\n\nN-Acetylglucosaminyltransferase-IV (GnT-IV) has two isoenzymes, GnT-IVa and GnT-IVb, which initiate the GlcNAcÎ²1-4 branch synthesis on the ManÎ±1-3 arm of the N-glycan core thereby increasing N-glycan branch complexity and conferring endogenous lectin binding epitopes. To elucidate the physiological significance of GnT-IV, we engineered and characterized GnT-IVb-deficient mice and further generated GnT-IVa/-IVb double deficient mice. In wild-type mice, GnT-IVa expression is restricted to gastrointestinal tissues, whereas GnT-IVb is broadly expressed among organs. GnT-IVb deficiency induced aberrant GnT-IVa expression corresponding to the GnT-IVb distribution pattern that might be attributed to increased Ets-1, which conceivably activates the Mgat4a promoter, and thereafter preserved apparent GnT-IV activity. The compensative GnT-IVa expression might contribute to amelioration of the GnT-IVb-deficient phenotype. GnT-IVb deficiency showed mild phenotypic alterations in hematopoietic cell populations and hemostasis. GnT-IVa/-IVb double deficiency completely abolished GnT-IV activity that resulted in the disappearance of the GlcNAcÎ²1-4 branch on the ManÎ±1-3 arm that was confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS and GC-MS linkage analyses. Comprehensive glycomic analyses revealed that the abundance of terminal moieties was preserved in GnT-IVa/-IVb double deficiency that was due to the elevated expression of glycosyltransferases regarding synthesis of terminal moieties. Thereby, this may maintain the expression of glycan ligands for endogenous lectins and prevent cellular dysfunctions. The fact that the phenotype of GnT-IVa/-IVb double deficiency largely overlapped that of GnT-IVa single deficiency can be attributed to the induced glycomic compensation. This is the first report that mammalian organs have highly organized glycomic compensation systems to preserve N-glycan branch complexity.

The BâN bridging units endow BNBP with fixed planar configuration and low-lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels. As a result, the polymer based on BNBP units (P-BNBP-T) exhibits high electron mobility, low-lying LUMO/HOMO energy levels, and strong absorbance in the visible region, which is desirable for polymer electron acceptors. Preliminary all-polymer solar cell (all-PSC) devices with P-BNBP-T as the electron acceptor and PTB7 as the electron donor exhibit a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 3.38%, which is among the highest values of all-PSCs with PTB7 as the electron donor.

It employs a minimal set of localized electron wave packets with âfloating and breathingâ degrees of freedom and the spin-coupling of non-orthogonal valence-bond theory. Its accuracy for describing potential energy curves of chemical bonds in ground and excited states of spin singlet and triplet is examined.\n\nGas-phase infrared spectroscopy for determination of double bond configuration of monounsaturated compounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nAttygalle, A B; Svatos, A; Wilcox, C; Voerman, S\n\n1994-05-15\n\nGas-phase Fourier-transform infrared spectra allow unambiguous determination of the configuration of the double bonds of long-chain unsaturated compounds bearing RCH=CHR' type bonds. Although the infrared absorption at 970-967 cm-1 has been used previously for the identification of trans bonds, the absorption at 3028-3011 cm-1 is conventionally considered to be incapable of distinguishing cis and trans isomers. In this paper, we present a large number of gas-phase spectra of monounsaturated long-chain acetates which demonstrate that an absorption, highly characteristic for the cis configuration, occurs at 3013-3011 cm-1, while trans compounds fail to show any bands in this region. However, if a double bond is present at the C-2 or C-3 carbon atoms, this cis=CH stretch absorption shows a hypsochromic shift to 3029-3028 and 3018-3017 cm-1, respectively. Similarly, if a cis double bond is present at the penultimate carbon atom, this band appears at 3022-3021 cm-1. All the spectra of trans alkenyl acetates showed the expected C-H wag absorption at 968-964 cm-1. In addition, the spectra of (E)-2-alkenyl acetates show a unique three-peak \"finger-print\" pattern which allows the identification of the position and configuration of this bond. Furthermore, by synthesizing and obtaining spectra of appropriate deuteriated compounds, we have proved that the 3013-3011 cm-1 band is representative of the C-H stretching vibration of cis compounds of RCH=CHR' type.\n\nOrigin of the 900 cm{sup â1} broad double-hump OH vibrational feature of strongly hydrogen-bonded carboxylic acids\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nVan Hoozen, Brian L.; Petersen, Poul B.\n\n2015-03-14\n\nMedium and strong hydrogen bonds are common in biological systems. Here, they provide structural support and can act as proton transfer relays to drive electron and/or energy transfer. Infrared spectroscopy is a sensitive probe of molecular structure and hydrogen bond strength but strongly hydrogen-bonded structures often exhibit very broad and complex vibrational bands. As an example, strong hydrogen bonds between carboxylic acids and nitrogen-containing aromatic bases commonly display a 900 cm{sup â1} broad feature with a remarkable double-hump structure. Although previous studies have assigned this feature to the OH, the exact origin of the shape and width of this unusualmoreÂ Â» feature is not well understood. In this study, we present ab initio calculations of the contributions of the OH stretch and bend vibrational modes to the vibrational spectrum of strongly hydrogen-bonded heterodimers of carboxylic acids and nitrogen-containing aromatic bases, taking the 7-azaindoleâacetic acid and pyridineâacetic acid dimers as examples. Our calculations take into account coupling between the OH stretch and bend modes as well as how both of these modes are affected by lower frequency dimer stretch modes, which modulate the distance between the monomers. Our calculations reproduce the broadness and the double-hump structure of the OH vibrational feature. Where the spectral broadness is primarily caused by the dimer stretch modes strongly modulating the frequency of the OH stretch mode, the double-hump structure results from a Fermi resonance between the out of the plane OH bend and the OH stretch modes.Â«Â less\n\nAcetonitrile covalent adduct chemical ionization mass spectrometry for double bond localization in non-methylene-interrupted polyene fatty acid methyl esters.\n\nPubMed\n\nLawrence, Peter; Brenna, J Thomas\n\n2006-02-15\n\nCovalent adduct chemical ionization (CACI) using a product of acetonitrile self-reaction, (1-methyleneimino)-1-ethenylium (MIE; CH2=C=N+=CH2), has been investigated as a method for localizing double bonds in a series of 16 non-methylene-interrupted fatty acid methyl esters (NMI-FAME) of polyenes with three and more double bonds. As with polyunsaturated homoallylic (methylene-interrupted) FAME and conjugated dienes, MIE (m/z 54) reacts across double bonds to yield molecular ions 54 mass units above the parent analyte. [M + 54]+ ions of several 20- and 22-carbon FAME that include one double bond in the C2-C3 position separated by two to five methylene units from a three, four, or five C homoallylic system dissociated according to rules for the homoallylic system, with an additional fragment corresponding to cleavage between the lone double bond and the carboxyl group and defining the position of the lone double bond. Triene FAME with both methylene and ethylene interruption yielded characteristic fragments distinguishable from homoallylic trienes. Fragmentation of fully conjugated trienes in the MS-1 spectra yields ratios of [M + 54]+/[M + 54 - 32]+ (loss of methanol) near unity, which distinguishes them from homoallylic FAME having a ratio of 8 or more; collisionally activated dissociation of [M + 54]+ yields a series of ions, including some rearrangement products, indicative of double bond position. Unlike conjugated dienes, fully conjugated triene diagnostic ion signal ratios did not follow any pattern based on double bond geometry. Partially conjugated trienes behave similarly to monoenes and conjugated dienes, yielding [M + 54]+/[M + 54 - 32]+ of 2-3 and, permitting them to be assigned as partially conjugated FAME using the MS-1 spectrum. They yield unique MS/MS spectra with weaker but assignable fragment ions, along with a diagnostic fragment that locates the lone double bond and permits 6,10,12-octatrienoate to be distinguished from 6,8,12-octatrienoate. The\n\nSuperplastic Forming/Diffusion Bonding Without Interlayer of 5A90 Al-Li Alloy Hollow Double-Layer Structure\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJiang, Shaosong; Jia, Yong; Lu, Zhen; Shi, Chengcheng; Zhang, Kaifeng\n\n2017-09-01\n\nThe hollow double-layer structure of 5A90 Al-Li alloy was fabricated by SPF/DB process in this study. The characteristics and mechanism of 5A90 Al-Li alloy with respect to superplasticity and diffusion bonding were investigated. Tensile tests showed that the optimal elongation of tensile specimens was 243.97% at the temperature of 400 Â°C and the strain rate of 0.001 s-1. Effect of the surface roughness, bonding temperature and bonding time to determine the microstructure and mechanical properties of diffusion bonding joints was investigated, and the optimum bonding parameters were 540 Â°C/2.5 h/Ra18. Through the finite element simulation, it could be found that the SPF/DB process of hollow double-layer structure was feasible. The hollow double-layer structure of 5A90 Al-Li alloy was manufactured, showing that the thickness distribution of the bonding area was uniform and the thinnest part was the round corner. The SEM images of diffusion bonding joints showed that sound bonding interfaces were obtained in which no discontinuity existed.\n\nPulsed EPR measurements on reaction rate constants for addition of photo-generated radicals to double bonds of diethyl fumarate and diethyl maleate\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nTakahashi, Hirona; Hagiwara, Kenta; Kawai, Akio\n\n2016-11-01\n\nAddition reaction of photo-generated radicals to double bonds of diethyl fumarate (deF) and diethyl maleate (deM), which are geometrical isomers, was studied by means of time-resolved- (TR-) and pulsed-electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Analysis of TR-EPR spectra indicates that adduct radicals from deF and deM should have the same structure. The double bonds of these monomers are converted to single ones by addition reaction, which allows hindered internal rotation to give the same structure of adduct radical. The rate constants for addition reaction of photo-generated radicals were determined by Stern-Volmer analysis of the decay time of electron spin-echo intensity of these radicals measured by the pulsed EPR method. Rate constants for deF were found to be larger than those for deM. This relation is in good consistent with efficiency of polymerisation of deF and deM.

Parent lipids and ozonolysis cleavage products are both detected directly from surfaces by desorption electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (DESI-MS) with the resulting mass spectra providing clear evidence of the double bond position within these molecules. This serendipitous process has been coupled with thin-layer chromatography (TLC) to provide a simple but powerful approach for the detailed structural elucidation of lipids present in complex biological extracts. Lipid extracts from human lens were deposited onto normal phase TLC plates and then developed to separate components according to lipid class. Exposure of the developed plates to laboratory air for ca. 1 h prior to DESI-MS analysis gave rise to ozonolysis products allowing for the unambiguous identification of double bond positions in even low abundant, unsaturated lipids. In particular, the co-localization of intact unsaturated lactosylceramides (LacCer) with products from their oxidative cleavage provide the first evidence for the presence of three isomeric LacCer (d18:0/24:1) species in the ocular lens lipidome, i.e., variants with double bonds at the n-9, n-7 and n-5 positions.\n\nValence State Driven Site Preference in the Quaternary Compound Ca5MgAgGe5: An Electron-Deficient Phase with Optimized Bonding\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPonou, Simeon; Lidin, Sven; Zhang, Yuemei\n\nThe quaternary phase Ca5Mg0.95Ag1.05(1)Ge5 (3) was synthesized by high-temperature solid-state techniques, and its crystal structure was determined by single-crystal diffraction methods in the orthorhombic space group Pnma â Wyckoff sequence c12 with a = 23.1481(4) Ã , b = 4.4736(1) Ã , c = 11.0128(2) Ã , V = 1140.43(4) Ã 3, Z = 4. The crystal structure can be described as linear intergrowths of slabs cut from the CaGe (CrB-type) and the CaMGe (TiNiSi-type; M = Mg, Ag) structures. Hence, 3 is a hettotype of the hitherto missing n = 3 member of the structure series with the general formula R2+nT2X2+n, previously describedmoreÂ Â» with n = 1, 2, and 4. The member with n = 3 was predicted in the space group Cmcm â Wyckoff sequence f5c2. The experimental space group Pnma (in the nonstandard setting Pmcn) corresponds to a klassengleiche symmetry reduction of index two of the predicted space group Cmcm. This transition originates from the switching of one Ge and one Ag position in the TiNiSi-related slab, a process that triggers an uncoupling of each of the five 8f sites in Cmcm into two 4c sites in Pnma. The Mg/Ag site preference was investigated using VASP calculations and revealed a remarkable example of an intermetallic compound for which the electrostatic valency principle is a critical structure-directing force. The compound is deficient by one valence electron according to the Zintl concept, but LMTO electronic structure calculations indicate electronic stabilization and overall bonding optimization in the polyanionic network. Other stability factors beyond the Zintl concept that may account for the electronic stabilization are discussed.Â«Â less\n\nEffect of oxygen deficiency on electronic properties and local structure of amorphous tantalum oxide thin films\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nDenny, Yus Rama; Firmansyah, Teguh; Oh, Suhk Kun\n\n2016-10-15\n\nHighlights: â¢ The effect of oxygen flow rate on electronic properties and local structure of tantalum oxide thin films was studied. â¢ The oxygen deficiency induced the nonstoichiometric state a-TaOx. â¢ A small peak at 1.97 eV above the valence band side appeared on nonstoichiometric Ta{sub 2}O{sub 5} thin films. â¢ The oxygen flow rate can change the local electronic structure of tantalum oxide thin films. - Abstract: The dependence of electronic properties and local structure of tantalum oxide thin film on oxygen deficiency have been investigated by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Reflection Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (REELS),moreÂ Â» and X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). The XPS results showed that the oxygen flow rate change results in the appearance of features in the Ta 4f at the binding energies of 23.2 eV, 24.4 eV, 25.8, and 27.3 eV whose peaks are attributed to Ta{sup 1+}, Ta{sup 2+}, Ta{sup 3+}/Ta{sup 4+}, and Ta{sup 5+}, respectively. The presence of nonstoichiometric state from tantalum oxide (TaOx) thin films could be generated by the oxygen vacancies. In addition, XAS spectra manifested both the increase of coordination number of the first Ta-O shell and a considerable reduction of the Ta-O bond distance with the decrease of oxygen deficiency.Â«Â less\n\nCD22 x Siglec-G double-deficient mice have massively increased B1 cell numbers and develop systemic autoimmunity.\n\nPubMed\n\nJellusova, Julia; Wellmann, Ute; Amann, Kerstin; Winkler, Thomas H; Nitschke, Lars\n\n2010-04-01\n\nCD22 and Siglec-G are inhibitory coreceptors for BCR-mediated signaling. Although CD22-deficient mice show increased calcium signaling in their conventional B2 cells and a quite normal B cell maturation, Siglec-G-deficient mice have increased calcium mobilization just in B1 cells and show a large expansion of the B1 cell population. Neither CD22-deficient, nor Siglec-G-deficient mice on a pure C57BL/6 or BALB/c background, respectively, develop autoimmunity. Using Siglec-G x CD22 double-deficient mice, we addressed whether Siglec-G and CD22 have redundant functions. Siglec-G x CD22 double-deficient mice show elevated calcium responses in both B1 cells and B2 cells, increased serum IgM levels and an enlarged population of B1 cells. The enlargement of B1 cell numbers is even higher than in Siglecg(-/-) mice. This expansion seems to happen at the expense of B2 cells, which are reduced in absolute cell numbers, but show an activated phenotype. Furthermore, Siglec-G x CD22 double-deficient mice show a diminished immune response to both thymus-dependent and thymus-independent type II Ags. In contrast, B cells from Siglec-G x CD22 double-deficient mice exhibit a hyperproliferative response to stimulation with several TLR ligands. Aged Siglec-G x CD22 double-deficient mice spontaneously develop anti-DNA and antinuclear autoantibodies. These resulted in a moderate form of immune complex glomerulonephritis. These results show that Siglec-G and CD22 have partly compensatory functions and together are crucial in maintaining the B cell tolerance.\n\nAccurate bond energies of hydrocarbons from complete basis set extrapolated multi-reference singles and doubles configuration interaction.\n\nPubMed\n\nOyeyemi, Victor B; Pavone, Michele; Carter, Emily A\n\n2011-12-09\n\nQuantum chemistry has become one of the most reliable tools for characterizing the thermochemical underpinnings of reactions, such as bond dissociation energies (BDEs). The accurate prediction of these particular properties (BDEs) are challenging for ab initio methods based on perturbative corrections or coupled cluster expansions of the single-determinant Hartree-Fock wave function: the processes of bond breaking and forming are inherently multi-configurational and require an accurate description of non-dynamical electron correlation. To this end, we present a systematic ab initio approach for computing BDEs that is based on three components: 1) multi-reference single and double excitation configuration interaction (MRSDCI) for the electronic energies; 2) a two-parameter scheme for extrapolating MRSDCI energies to the complete basis set limit; and 3) DFT-B3LYP calculations of minimum-energy structures and vibrational frequencies to account for zero point energy and thermal corrections. We validated our methodology against a set of reliable experimental BDE values of Cï£¿C and Cï£¿H bonds of hydrocarbons. The goal of chemical accuracy is achieved, on average, without applying any empirical corrections to the MRSDCI electronic energies. We then use this composite scheme to make predictions of BDEs in a large number of hydrocarbon molecules for which there are no experimental data, so as to provide needed thermochemical estimates for fuel molecules.

It is shown that the temperature differences across a double layer can be varied and are not a result of thermalization of the bump-on-tail distribution.

Six different possibilities for NO3 addition to the double bonds, which correspond to the two CâC double bonds (endocyclic or exocyclic) have been considered. The negative activation energies for the addition of NO3 to limonene are calculated and the energies of NO3-limonene radical adducts are found to be 14.55 to 20.17 kcal mol-1 more stable than the separated NO3 and limonene at the CCSD(T)/6â31G(d) + CF level. The results also indicate that the endocyclic addition reaction is more energetically favorable than the exocyclic one.

The discovery of novel intermetallic compounds can enhance understanding of the chemical principles that govern structural stability and chemical bonding as well as finding new applications. Valence electron-poor polar intermetallics with valence electron concentrations (VECs) between 2.0 and 3.0 e - /atom show a plethora of unprecedented and fascinating structural motifs and bonding features. Therefore, establishing simple structure-bonding-property relationships is especially challenging for this compound class because commonly accepted valence electron counting rules are inappropriate. During our efforts to find quasicrystals and crystalline approximants by valence electron tuning near 2.0 e - /atom, we observed that compositions close to those of quasicrystals are exceptional sources for unprecedented valence electron-poor polar intermetallics, e.g., Ca 4 Au 10 In 3 containing (Au 10 In 3 ) wavy layers, Li 14.7 Mg 36.8 Cu 21.5 Ga 66 adopting a type IV clathrate framework, and Sc 4 Mg x Cu 15-x Ga 7.5 that is incommensurately modulated. In particular, exploratory syntheses of AAu 3 T (A = Ca, Sr, Ba and T = Ge, Sn) phases led to interesting bonding features for Au, such as columns, layers, and lonsdaleite-type tetrahedral frameworks. Overall, the breadth of Au-rich polar intermetallics originates, in part, from significant relativistics effect on the valence electrons of Au, effects which result in greater 6s/5d orbital mixing, a small effective metallic radius, and an enhanced Mulliken electronegativity, all leading to ultimate enhanced binding with nearly all metals including itself. Two other successful strategies to mine electron-poor polar intermetallics include lithiation and \"cation-rich\" phases. Along these lines, we have studied lithiated Zn-rich compounds in which structural\n\nElectronic structure and chemical bonding of the electron-poor II-V semiconductors ZnSb and ZnAs\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBenson, Daryn; Sankey, Otto F.; HÃ¤ussermann, Ulrich\n\n2011-09-01\n\nThe binary compounds ZnSb and ZnAs with the CdSb structure are semiconductors (II-V), although the average electron concentration (3.5 per atom) is lower than that of the tetrahedrally bonded III-V and II-VI archetype systems (four per atom). We report a detailed electronic structure and chemical bonding analysis for ZnSb and ZnAs based on first-principles calculations. ZnSb and ZnAs are compared to the zinc blende-type semiconductors GaSb, ZnTe, GaAs, and ZnSe, as well as the more ionic, hypothetical, II-V systems MgSb and MgAs. We establish a clearly covalent bonding scenario for ZnSb and ZnAs where multicenter bonded structural entities (rhomboid rings Zn2Sb2 and Zn2As2) are connected to each other by classical two-center, two-electron bonds. This bonding scenario is only compatible with a weak ionicity in II-V semiconductor systems, and weak ionicity appears as a necessary condition for the stability of the CdSb structure type. It is argued that a chemical bonding scenario with mixed multicenter and two-center bonding resembles that of boron and boron-rich compounds and is typical of electron-poor sp-bonded semiconductors with average valence electron concentrations below four per atom.\n\nThe Impacts of Phosphorus Deficiency on the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain.\n\nPubMed\n\nCarstensen, Andreas; Herdean, Andrei; Schmidt, Sidsel Birkelund; Sharma, Anurag; Spetea, Cornelia; Pribil, Mathias; Husted, SÃ¸ren\n\n2018-05-01\n\nPhosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and P deficiency limits plant productivity. Recent work showed that P deficiency affects electron transport to photosystem I (PSI), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive biological model describing how P deficiency disrupts the photosynthetic machinery and the electron transport chain through a series of sequential events in barley ( Hordeum vulgare ). P deficiency reduces the orthophosphate concentration in the chloroplast stroma to levels that inhibit ATP synthase activity. Consequently, protons accumulate in the thylakoids and cause lumen acidification, which inhibits linear electron flow. Limited plastoquinol oxidation retards electron transport to the cytochrome b 6 f complex, yet the electron transfer rate of PSI is increased under steady-state growth light and is limited under high-light conditions. Under P deficiency, the enhanced electron flow through PSI increases the levels of NADPH, whereas ATP production remains restricted and, hence, reduces CO 2 fixation. In parallel, lumen acidification activates the energy-dependent quenching component of the nonphotochemical quenching mechanism and prevents the overexcitation of photosystem II and damage to the leaf tissue. Consequently, plants can be severely affected by P deficiency for weeks without displaying any visual leaf symptoms. All of the processes in the photosynthetic machinery influenced by P deficiency appear to be fully reversible and can be restored in less than 60 min after resupply of orthophosphate to the leaf tissue.

Here, we report that the potassium graphite reduction of the neutral hypervalent silicon-carbene complex L:SiCl4 {where L: is:C[N(2,6-Pri2-C6H3)CH]2 and Pri is isopropyl} produces L:(Cl)Si-Si(Cl):L, a carbene-stabilized bis-silylene, and L:Si=Si:L, a carbene-stabilized diatomic silicon molecule with the Si atoms in the formal oxidation state of zero. The Si-Si bond distance of 2.2294 +/- 0.0011 (standard deviation) angstroms in L:Si=Si:L is consistent with a Si=Si double bond. Complementary computational studies confirm the nature of the bonding in L:(Cl)Si-Si(Cl):L and L:Si=Si:L.\n\nAdhesive-bonded double-lap joints.

The analyses extend the elastic solution Volkersen and cover adhesive plasticity, adherend stiffness imbalance and thermal mismatch between the adherends. Both elastic-plastic and bi-elastic adhesive representations lead to the explicit result that the influence of the adhesive on the maximum potential bond strength is defined uniquely by the strain energy in shear per unit area of bond. Failures induced by peel stresses at the ends of the joint are examined. This failure mode is particularly important for composite adherends. The explicit solutions are sufficiently simple to be used for design purposes\n\nElectron-Poor Polar Intermetallics: Complex Structures, Novel Clusters, and Intriguing Bonding with Pronounced Electron Delocalization\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLin, Qisheng; Miller, Gordon J.\n\nIntermetallic compounds represent an extensive pool of candidates for energy related applications stemming from magnetic, electric, optic, caloric, and catalytic properties.

It is possible to obtain direct structural information as to these double bond positions using tandem mass spectrometry after collisional activation of the carboxylate anions of an acetone adduct at each of the double bond positions formed by the photochemical PaternÃ²-BÃ¼chi reaction with acetone. This reaction can be carried out by exposing a small portion of an inline fused silica capillary to UV photons from a mercury vapor lamp as the sample is infused into the electrospray ion source of a mass spectrometer. Collisional activation of [M - H] - yields a series of reverse PaternÃ²-BÃ¼chi reaction product ions that essentially are derived from cleavage of the original carbon-carbon double bonds that yield an isopropenyl carboxylate anion corresponding to each double bond location. Aldehydic reverse PaternÃ²-BÃ¼chi product ions are much less abundant as the carbon chain length and number of double bonds increase. The use of a mixture of D 0 /D 6 -acetone facilitates identification of these double bonds indicating product ions as shown for arachidonic acid. If oxygen is present in the solvent stream undergoing UV photoactivation, ozone cleavage ions are also observed without prior collisional activation. This reaction was used to determine the double bond positions in a 20:3 fatty acid that accumulated in phospholipids of RAW 264.7 cells cultured for 3 days.\n\nNanographenes as electron-deficient cores of donor-acceptor systems.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Yu-Min; Hou, Hao; Zhou, Yan-Zhen; Zhao, Xin-Jing; Tang, Chun; Tan, Yuan-Zhi; MÃ¼llen, Klaus\n\n2018-05-15\n\nConjugation of nanographenes (NGs) with electro-active molecules can establish donor-acceptor Ï-systems in which the former generally serve as the electron-donating moieties due to their electronic-rich nature. In contrast, here we report a series of reversed donor-acceptor structuresÂ are obtained by C-N coupling of electron-deficient perchlorinated NGs with electron-rich anilines. Selective amination at the vertexes of the NGs is unambiguously shown through X-ray crystallography. By varying the donating ability of the anilino groups, the optical and assembly properties of donor-acceptor NGs can be finely modulated. The electron-deficient concave core of the resulting conjugates can host electron-rich guest molecules by intermolecular donor-acceptor interactions and gives rise to charge-transfer supramolecular architectures.\n\nBent Bonds and Multiple Bonds.\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nRobinson, Edward A.; Gillespie, Ronald J.\n\n1980-01-01\n\nConsiders carbon-carbon multiple bonds in terms of Pauling's bent bond model, which allows direct calculation of double and triple bonds from the length of a CC single bond.

The boranes B(2)H(6), B(4)H(4), B(4)H(10), [B(6)H(6)](2-), and [B(6)H(7)](-) serve as prototypical examples of hypovalent 3c-2e and 4c-2e bonding. The kinetic energy density is derived from a set of Kohn-Sham orbitals obtained from pure density functional calculations (PBE/TZVP), and the topology of LOL is analyzed in terms of (3,-3) attractors (Gamma). The B-B-B and B-H-B 3c-2e, and the B-B-H-B 4c-2e bonding situations are defined by their own characteristic LOL profiles. The presence of one attractor in relation to the three or four atoms that are engaged in electron deficient bonding provides sufficient indication of the type of 3c-2e or 4c-2e bond present. For the 4c-2e bond in [B(6)H(7)](-) the LOL analysis is compared to results from an experimental QTAIM study.\n\nA Structural Model of a P450-Ferredoxin Complex from Orientation-Selective Double Electron-Electron Resonance Spectroscopy.\n\nPubMed\n\nBowen, Alice M; Johnson, Eachan O D; Mercuri, Francesco; Hoskins, Nicola J; Qiao, Ruihong; McCullagh, James S O; Lovett, Janet E; Bell, Stephen G; Zhou, Weihong; Timmel, Christiane R; Wong, Luet Lok; Harmer, Jeffrey R\n\n2018-02-21\n\nCytochrome P450 (CYP) monooxygenases catalyze the oxidation of chemically inert carbon-hydrogen bonds in diverse endogenous and exogenous organic compounds by atmospheric oxygen. This C-H bond oxy-functionalization activity has huge potential in biotechnological applications. Class I CYPs receive the two electrons required for oxygen activation from NAD(P)H via a ferredoxin reductase and ferredoxin. The interaction of Class I CYPs with their cognate ferredoxin is specific. In order to reconstitute the activity of diverse CYPs, structural characterization of CYP-ferredoxin complexes is necessary, but little structural information is available. Here we report a structural model of such a complex (CYP199A2-HaPux) in frozen solution derived from distance and orientation restraints gathered by the EPR technique of orientation-selective double electron-electron resonance (os-DEER). The long-lived oscillations in the os-DEER spectra were well modeled by a single orientation of the CYP199A2-HaPux complex. The structure is different from the two known Class I CYP-Fdx structures: CYP11A1-Adx and CYP101A1-Pdx. At the protein interface, HaPux residues in the [Fe 2 S 2 ] cluster-binding loop and the Î±3 helix and the C-terminus residue interact with CYP199A2 residues in the proximal loop and the C helix. These residue contacts are consistent with biochemical data on CYP199A2-ferredoxin binding and electron transfer. Electron-tunneling calculations indicate an efficient electron-transfer pathway from the [Fe 2 S 2 ] cluster to the heme. This new structural model of a CYP-Fdx complex provides the basis for tailoring CYP enzymes for which the cognate ferredoxin is not known, to accept electrons from HaPux and display monooxygenase activity.\n\nBond-rearrangement and ionization mechanisms in the photo-double-ionization of simple hydrocarbons (C 2H 4, C 2H 3F, and 1,1-C 2H 2F 2) near and above threshold\n\nDOE PAGES\n\nGaire, B.; Gatton, A. S.; Wiegandt, F.; ...\n\n2016-09-14\n\nWe have investigated bond-rearrangement driven by photo-double-ionization (PDI) near and above the double ionization threshold in a sequence of carbon-carbon double bonded hydrocarbon molecules: ethylene, fluoroethylene, and 1,1-difluoroethylene. We employ the kinematically complete cold target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy (COLTRIMS) method to resolve all photo-double-ionization events leading to two-ionic fragments. We observe changes in the branching ratios of different dissociative ionization channels depending on the presence of none, one, or two fluorine atoms. The role of the fluorine atom in the bond-rearrangement channels is intriguing as evident by the re-ordering of the threshold energies of the PDI in the fluorinatedmoreÂ Â» molecules. These effects offer a compelling argument that the electronegativity of the fluorine (or the polarity of the molecule) strongly influences the potential energy surfaces of the molcules and drives bond-rearrangement during the dissociation process. The energy sharing and the relative angle between the 3D-momentum vectors of the two electrons provide clear evidence of direct and indirect PDI processes.Â«Â less\n\nFirst principles study of the electronic and magnetic structures and bonding properties of UCoC2 ternary, characteristic of C-C units\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMatar, Samir F.\n\n2013-03-01\n\nThe electronic structure of UCoC2, a di-carbide with the C-C units is examined from ab initio with an assessment of the properties of chemical bonding. The energy-volume equation of state shows large anisotropy effects due to C-C alignment along tetragonal c-axis leading to high linear incompressibility. Relevant features of selective bonding of uranium and cobalt with carbon at two different Wyckoff sites and strong C-C interactions are remarkable. The vibrational frequencies for C&ctdot;C stretching modes indicate closer behavior to aliphatic C-C rather than Cdbnd C double bond. A ferromagnetic ground state is proposed from the calculations.\n\nBonded exciplex formation: electronic and stereoelectronic effects.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Yingsheng; Haze, Olesya; Dinnocenzo, Joseph P; Farid, Samir; Farid, Ramy S; Gould, Ian R\n\n2008-12-18\n\nAs recently proposed, the singlet-excited states of several cyanoaromatics react with pyridine via bonded-exciplex formation, a novel concept in photochemical charge transfer reactions. Presented here are electronic and steric effects on the quenching rate constants, which provide valuable support for the model. Additionally, excited-state quenching in poly(vinylpyridine) is strongly inhibited both relative to that in neat pyridine and also to conventional exciplex formation in polymers, consistent with a restrictive orientational requirement for the formation of bonded exciplexes. Examples of competing reactions to form both conventional and bonded exciplexes are presented, which illustrate the delicate balance between these two processes when their reaction energetics are similar. Experimental and computational evidence is provided for the formation of a bonded exciplex in the reaction of the singlet excited state of 2,6,9,10-tetracyanoanthracene (TCA) with an oxygen-substituted donor, dioxane, thus expanding the scope of bonded exciplexes.\n\nFacile synthesis of -C[double bond, length as m-dash]N- linked covalent organic frameworks under ambient conditions.\n\nPubMed\n\nDing, San-Yuan; Cui, Xiao-Hui; Feng, Jie; Lu, Gongxuan; Wang, Wei\n\n2017-10-31\n\nWe reported herein a facile approach for the synthesis of -C[double bond, length as m-dash]N- linked covalent organic frameworks under ambient conditions. Three known (COF-42, COF-43, and COF-LZU1) and one new (Pr-COF-42) COF materials were successfully synthesized using this method. Furthermore, this simple synthetic approach makes the large-scale synthesis of -C[double bond, length as m-dash]N- linked COFs feasible.\n\nPreparation of mesoporous alumina particles by spray pyrolysis and application to double bond migration of 2-butene.\n\nPubMed\n\nSong, Ki Chang; Kim, Joo Hyun; Kim, Jin Han; Jung, Kyeong Youl; Park, Young-Kwon; Jeon, Jong-Ki\n\n2011-07-01\n\nThe objective of the present study is to investigate the catalytic performance of mesoporous alumina that were prepared via spray pyrolysis for double bond migration from 2-butene to 1-butene. The mesoporous alumina particles were prepared via spray pyrolysis by changing the types of organic surfactants and Al precursors. The texture and acidic properties of mesoporous alumina were analyzed through N2 adsorption, SEM, ammonia-temperature programmed desorption, and FT-IR of adsorbed pyridine. The morphologies and texture properties of the mesoporous alumina were found to have been strongly influenced by the combination of the Al precursor and the structure-directing agents. The mesoporous alumina samples had two kinds of acidic sites: a Lewis acid site and a H-bonded weak acid site. 1-Butene was produced selectively through double bond migration of 2-butene over all of the mesoporous alumina catalysts. The catalyst prepared by using a chloride compound as an aluminium precursor and CTAC as a structure-directing agent showed the highest activity in the double bond migration of 2-butene, which was attributed to its large surface area and an overall high amount of acid sites.\n\nA valence bond study of three-center four-electron pi bonding: electronegativity vs electroneutrality.\n\nPubMed\n\nDeBlase, Andrew; Licata, Megan; Galbraith, John Morrison\n\n2008-12-18\n\nThree-center four-electron (3c4e) pi bonding systems analogous to that of the ozone molecule have been studied using modern valence bond theory. Molecules studied herein consist of combinations of first row atoms C, N, and O with the addition of H atoms where appropriate in order to preserve the 3c4e pi system. Breathing orbital valence bond (BOVB) calculations were preformed at the B3LYP/6-31G**-optimized geometries in order to determine structural weights, pi charge distributions, resonance energies, and pi bond energies. It is found that the most weighted VB structure depends on atomic electronegativity and charge distribution, with electronegativity as the dominant factor. By nature, these systems are delocalized, and therefore, resonance energy is the main contributor to pi bond energies. Molecules with a single dominant VB structure have low resonance energies and therefore low pi bond energies.\n\nIntegrated packaging of multiple double sided cooling planar bond power modules\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLiang, Zhenxian\n\nAn integrated double sided cooled power module has one or multiple phase legs configuration including one or more planar power packages, each planar power package having an upper power switch unit and a lower power switch unit directly bonded and interconnected between two insulated power substrates, and further sandwiched between two heat exchangers via direct bonds. A segmented coolant manifold is interposed with the one or more planar power packages and creates a sealed enclosure that defines a coolant inlet, a coolant outlet and a coolant flow path between the inlet and the outlet. A coolant circulates along the flowmoreÂ Â» path to remove heat and increase the power density of the power module.Â«Â less\n\nIsolation and reversible dimerization of a selenium-selenium three-electron Ï-bond.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Senwang; Wang, Xingyong; Su, Yuanting; Qiu, Yunfan; Zhang, Zaichao; Wang, Xinping\n\n2014-06-11\n\nThree-electron Ï-bonding that was proposed by Linus Pauling in 1931 has been recognized as important in intermediates encountered in many areas. A number of three-electron bonding systems have been spectroscopically investigated in the gas phase, solution and solid matrix. However, X-ray diffraction studies have only been possible on simple noble gas dimer Xeâ´Xe and cyclic framework-constrained Nâ´N radical cations. Here, we show that a diselena species modified with a naphthalene scaffold can undergo one-electron oxidation using a large and weakly coordinating anion, to afford a room-temperature-stable radical cation containing a Seâ´Se three-electron Ï-bond. When a small anion is used, a reversible dimerization with phase and marked colour changes is observed: radical cation in solution (blue) but diamagnetic dimer in the solid state (brown). These findings suggest that more examples of three-electron Ï-bonds may be stabilized and isolated by using naphthalene scaffolds together with large and weakly coordinating anions.\n\nIntrinsic microstructure of Si/GaAs heterointerfaces fabricated by surface-activated bonding at room temperature\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOhno, Yutaka; Yoshida, Hideto; Takeda, Seiji; Liang, Jianbo; Shigekawa, Naoteru\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe intrinsic microstructure of Si/GaAs heterointerfaces fabricated by surface-activated bonding at room temperature is examined by plane-view transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and cross-sectional scanning TEM using damage-free TEM specimens prepared only by mechanochemical etching. The bonded heterointerfaces include an As-deficient crystalline GaAs layer with a thickness of less than 1 nm and an amorphous Si layer with a thickness of approximately 3 nm, introduced by the irradiation of an Ar atom beam for surface activation before bonding. It is speculated that the interface resistance mainly originates from the As-deficient defects in the former layer.\n\nResolution of concerted versus sequential mechanisms in photo-induced double-proton transfer reaction in 7-azaindole H-bonded dimer\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCatalÃ¡n, Javier; del Valle, Juan Carlos; Kasha, Michael\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe experimental and theoretical bases for a synchronous or concerted double-proton transfer in centro-symmetric H-bonded electronically excited molecular dimers are presented. The prototype model is the 7-azaindole dimer. New research offers confirmation of a concerted mechanism for excited-state biprotonic transfer. Recent femtosecond photoionization and coulombic explosion techniques have given rise to time-of-flight MS observations suggesting sequential two-step biprotonic transfer for the same dimer. We interpret the overall species observed in the time-of-flight experiments as explicable without conflict with the concerted mechanism of proton transfer.

This emission can be dramatically weakened by inserting a hole-injecting layer of poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonic acid) between the hole-transporting layer and the anode. Consequently, EL color of this OLED is tuned from white to blue. This phenomenon may result from the improvement of hole injection, which shifts the major recombination zone from the NPB/trans-DPDSB interface to the trans-DPDSB layer.\n\nThe Impacts of Phosphorus Deficiency on the Photosynthetic Electron Transport Chain1[OPEN\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2018-01-01\n\nPhosphorus (P) is an essential macronutrient, and P deficiency limits plant productivity. Recent work showed that P deficiency affects electron transport to photosystem I (PSI), but the underlying mechanisms are unknown. Here, we present a comprehensive biological model describing how P deficiency disrupts the photosynthetic machinery and the electron transport chain through a series of sequential events in barley (Hordeum vulgare). P deficiency reduces the orthophosphate concentration in the chloroplast stroma to levels that inhibit ATP synthase activity. Consequently, protons accumulate in the thylakoids and cause lumen acidification, which inhibits linear electron flow. Limited plastoquinol oxidation retards electron transport to the cytochrome b6f complex, yet the electron transfer rate of PSI is increased under steady-state growth light and is limited under high-light conditions. Under P deficiency, the enhanced electron flow through PSI increases the levels of NADPH, whereas ATP production remains restricted and, hence, reduces CO2 fixation. In parallel, lumen acidification activates the energy-dependent quenching component of the nonphotochemical quenching mechanism and prevents the over"
