        "text": "Re: Space X\n\nI think a real problem for SpaceX could be that, really, there's hardly anywhere on the entire eastern coastline that's suitable. Cape Canaveral in Florida is the most likely - because they've been launching from there for decades.\n\nQuite a lot depends on whether or not they can actually pull off a FOD-free launch with a simple stand and water-quenched tin plate underneath it. If they can, there's room at Canaveral for a launch facility like that. If not, and they need an enormous flame trench, there might not be room at Canaveral for a new one of those, and building one at Boca Chica might be impossible.\n\nSo, if a flame trench is needed, it might just be that they've built a rocket too big to be launched from anywhere in the USA. And, when you look at a map of the world for eastern coastlines not too far away from the equator with a properous high tech economy suited to supporting such a program, there's not exactly many places in the world where it could be launched from.\n\nRe: Space X\n\n> \"The site was a bit of a question mark when announced, as much of the content of the lawsuit was raised as issues at the time. TBH, I am rather surprised that there was eventual agreement amongst (collection of US Federal agencies with relevant oversite) and SpaceX that the site was usable for launching rockets without causing environmental chaos.\"\n\nAs improbable as it sounds, a wildlife preserve does not itself preclude successful, beneficial co-existence with a launch site. Kennedy Space Center is completely enclosed in the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge-- I encourage everyone to look at on a map, particularly the one provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service website. When I say \"completely enclosed,\" I mean ***completely enclosed.*** There are bits which are excluded from the Refuge, but the Refuge runs right up to the edges of the launch pads and KSC runway.\n\nAnd as bazza points out, there really aren't any locations along the Gulf or east coasts which could be considered 'unobjectionable' for development of a rocket as large as Starship/Super Heavy: it's all or almost all human inhabited or some kind of park or preserve. They could do more out of KSC, but only up to a point: KSC is used by more than just SpaceX, and NASA doesn't want their other operations to be unnecessarily impeded by the hardware-rich development of any of their partners/tenants. The same applies to Cape Canaveral Space Force Station.\n\nBut the Boca Chica site is not-- and may never be-- a \"primary launch site.\" The recent FAA PEA specified limits on the number of launches SpaceX is permitted. These limits will mostly confine them to test launches, though I'm all but certain they will seek waivers if they get to the point where they're filling an orbital propellent depot to support the moon missions, because they and NASA will want to reduce the time between the first propellent launch and the trans-lunar injection burn.\n\nRe: PEA took ages\n\nThere are repeated bleats on the internet that there should have been an environmental impact study. There was but for launching Falcon 9+Heavy.\n\nAs this is an aerospace project, the lead agency was the FAA. The FAA subcontracted much of the work to US government departments specialising in environmental issues. The correct type of document for evaluating Starship launches at Boca Chica was a Programmatic Environmental Assessment, which the FAA conducted. It took ages, to the point where there was bleating on the internet that the government was dragging it out. I said at the time that was rubbish. The FAA took the time to make the PEA litigation proof. It was abundantly clear that any weakness in the PEA would result in litigation from Blue Origin (a company funded by Jeff Bezos with extensive experience in litigating rocket issues). I have confidence that the FAA's result: mitigated finding on no significant impact is backed by strong evidence and the current litigation will have no effect whatsoever.\n\nThere are historical issues. When Musk was in charge at Boca Chica, there was no single person with responsibility for license compliance. Several people found parts of one of the licenses unclear. Each of them assumed someone else had checked compliance. SpaceX got a stern telling off and were required to name someone to be responsible for compliance for each launch and if anything was unclear to pick up the phone and ask. Fortunately Musk became too busy to handle Boca Chica. Gwynne Shotwell took over then put Kathy Lueders in charge. Kathy is famous among space enthusiasts for heading the NASA side of the Commercial Crew Program where she was sidelined for showing firm fixed price contracts could deliver better results than cost plus. In the past I would have been worried that SpaceX would try to cut corners on the mitigations side of the mitigated FONSI. I have far more confidence in Gwynne and Kathy, and doubly so with Musk deep in a war of words with Zuckerberg.\n\nThe only open issue I am aware of is that SpaceX schedules a large number of road closures and cancels most of them. The number of times highway 4 is actually closed has stayed within agreed bounds. There was an argument about the number of cancelled closures but that has made the news for years.\n\nStarbase has really cleaned up the site. It used to be owned by Sanchez Oil & Gas Corp. Even if this was not provably ridiculous pearl clutching, I would not expect a Texas court to the the environment stand in the way of profit.\n\ncheers of Musk employees as they watched Starship break up in flight.\n\nIt makes sense if you understand the enormous differences between SpaceX and old space.\n\nAn old space rocket is designed and simulated for years at enormous expense. Eventually they try to build one and find they can't. They either have to do expensive research into new manufacturing methods or repeat the expensive design and simulation stage. The project gets delayed for years and the costs rocket up. When they finally do launch the rocket gets to orbit but only after many cancellations and delays because the cost of failure would be the end of a cost plus contract. The final product has an incremental cost of $4B per launch and they can only make one every two years.\n\nSpaceX's immediate goal is not a rocket but a rocket factory. Last I looked there are three boosters and three ships parked in the rocket garden plus more at the test site and more nearing completion at the factory. The factory can turn out a complete stack every month now and is undergoing a huge expansion. The license for Boca Chica is currently 5 orbital launch attempt + some suborbital launches per year. Blowing up a rocket in the cleared launch corridor really means nothing to SpaceX - except perhaps they will not have to scrap another rocket to make space in the garden.\n\nFor that particular launch, the thrust vectoring system was destroyed well before stage separation was scheduled. They needed the entire thing in pieces before it left the cleared launch corridor. The flight termination system was triggered and the shaped charges exploded promptly but the rocket did not blow up. Luckily it was doing summersaults so the thrust averaged out to zero. It took about 40 seconds for the rocket to RUD. I bet there was relief when it happened because no-one wanted a fully fuelled upper stage to explode outside the launch corridor.\n\nThe test generated a huge amount of data - one test is worth a thousand simulations. Simulations showed the upgraded base of the launch table was strong enough for one launch. That proved spectactularly wrong. The simulations have been improved and a large crater was dug (by rocket engines) and filled with rebar and concrete supported by pilings and covered in a giant upside down shower head. Although some of the pieces of the pad production system were built before the test it is clear that waiting for installation would have created at least three months of delay. SpaceX now have a similar amount of delay but with test data informing a thousand changes to the rocket plus better simulations to guide the design of the flame diverter.\n\nWith the pad unavailable because of construction work SpaceX has taken the opportunity to make huge changes to the layout of the ground support equipment. Most of the big vertical tanks have gone - the water tanks are now on their side and vacuum insulated tanks have arrived and been installed for LOX + methane. Testing has continued at the former Massey's gun range site. There have been structural tests on the nose cone, cryo-proofing of a ship, a static test fire and a test of the flight termination system.\n\nI am sure all the SpaceX staff had hoped for more from that launch but in context it is clear to everyone but Jim Free that there has been no significant interruption to Starship progress. If the new flame diverter does its job then SpaceX might be able to fit in all 5 possible launch attempts this year. (My bet is on 4)"
