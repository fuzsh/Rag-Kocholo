        "text": "In the middle of a pandemic, Majeed’s work has been difficult, but it's what she's used to. A visit from an astronaut or chat with an astronomer would be a nice perk to many US classrooms. But to the students of Pakistan, such early and consistent exposure to space icons and their research is simply unheard of. Pakistan’s still-nascent space presence means that Majeed had — and still has — little to work with when establishing Exploration by Yumna. She’s built much of her initiative straight from the ground up.\n\nActivist Malala Yousafzai’s story is an example of what might happen to a young woman pursuing education in Pakistan. When Yousafzai was just a pre-teen, she wrote a blog under a pen name for BBC Urdu describing her life growing up in the Swat district of Pakistan, which had been occupied by the Tehrik-i-Taliban. As Yousafzai rose to international prominence, so did the target on her back. In 2012, after taking an exam, Yousafzai was shot in the head by a Tehrik-i-Taliban gunman in retaliation for her activism.\n\n“We don't have many jobs over here,” Majeed says. In Pakistan, a Ph.D. is necessary—not optional—for a legitimate career in astronomy. Otherwise, there are simply not a lot of roles that a scientist with only a bachelor's or even a master's in space science could fill. As a result, those who do end up pursuing one or two degrees studying astronomy end up seeking opportunities elsewhere—namely in foreign space agencies like NASA or ESA. This only aggravates the roadblocks inhibiting space science advancement in Pakistan.\n\n“Not only are there a lack of jobs but there’s also a lack of public accessibility. When it comes to astronomy, we don't have access to the equipment. Pakistan doesn’t have even a single telescope manufacturing company,” says Majeed, whose space advocacy all began after she won her own telescope in a competition. “Even if somebody's trying to access equipment, we have foolish rules which makes it more difficult for a person to get that equipment. We do not have public observatories, we do not have public planetariums. We do not have space museums, science museums. We do not have such things.\"\n\nThere are dozens of AAM and ASTC accredited space, science, and aviation museums in the United States, so a world without that allure of space exploration might be hard for us to imagine. alone, and admission to the nation’s hallmark museum in Washington, D.C. is completely free. That open accessibility is certainly aided by the fact that the institute’s federal funding for that fiscal year totaled a whopping $1 billion. Comparatively, SUPARCO holds a 2020-2021 budget of 4,975 million Pakistani rupees, roughly the equivalent of 31 million USD. That’s barely over 0.1% of the 2021 fiscal year budget that Congress approved for NASA in December 2020, which clocks in at just under 23.3 billion.\n\nGiven the breakdown of the country’s 2020-21 federal budget, it’s clear that Pakistani politicians have other challenges to face aside from an immature space program. (that’s 95 billion US dollars) is allocated for national defense — a figure that’s likely in response to oscillating tensions at the border in Kashmir. With the looming threat of all-out war almost constantly on the horizon, other scientific endeavors simply must take a backseat to developing stronger, faster, and better defense systems.\n\n“I never planned to be a space educator, and it is a beautiful accident. I came up with this term for myself, because people in different interviews, started calling me self-proclaimed astronaut, or astronomer, and things like that,” says Majeed, who now helps connect Pakistani students with real-life astronauts, “And I wanted a proper term to represent myself. I am not a self-proclaimed astronaut. I am not an astronomer. I am not interested in spectroscopy or measuring the temperature or colors of stars. I am interested in space travel. I am interested in how things work in zero gravity. I'm interested in how science experiments are being conducted at the International Space Station. So this is a difference that people over here in Pakistan, they do not understand.”\n\n“I am actually seeing the responses from kids, and realizing there are people who look up to me, and I feel more responsibility because this is not my final destination. This being a space educator — it happened accidentally. There was a young person who messaged me on Instagram today, and her message said ‘You gave me hope. I had already given up on my astronomy dream, but your interview gave me hope. And I will also teach kids about astronomy.’ I was like — No girl, don’t stop there. If you are passionate about something, please go for it. I didn't want to convey a message that I became a space educator, so you all should become one. No, I want them to be more than that. I want them to be more successful. Like they say, shoot for the Moon. And even if you fail, you will land among the stars.”\n\n“I work in collaboration with various US and European-based organizations. Their objective is similar to mine — they want to promote space science in their communities, in their countries, and all over the world. So, one of the companies is based in the US, and the person who owns the organization is a meteorite collector himself. As I was running his chapter in my country, he gave me a set of meteorites for educational purposes,” says Majeed, “One of them was a meteorite that fell in my own country.”\n\nHow did a meteorite that was found in Pakistan end up overseas? For Majeed, the story is a disappointing status quo. “The meteorite fell in Pakistan, but we did not have access to it. It went to America, some meteorite hunters sold it, and that’s how my friend got a little piece of it,” Majeed says, “Right now, I own them, but I also want to use them for public observation, because we don't have museums here.”\n\nIt’s a major step that Majeed is now in possession of these rocks. However, sharing them with the rest of Pakistan has proved challenging. “Any type of rocks and telescopes are somehow banned at our customs… I want kids to come and see [them]. But for that, I need a proper setup,” says Majeed, “I need to make a tiny traveling museum… But I’m struggling for sponsorship. That’s a difficult thing.\"\n\n“I want kids to go for it, to go for NASA, to go for SpaceX, rather than teaching. If younger people are looking up to me — they want to be Yumna Majeed — I do not want this vicious cycle. I want them to be more than me. I don't want 100 girls to grow up and to get to whatever degree their parents say. And then for fun, do this space education thing.”"
