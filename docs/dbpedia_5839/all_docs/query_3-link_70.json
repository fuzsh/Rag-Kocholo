        "text": "U.S. Navy REGULUS II GUIDED MISSILE\n\nDescription: being launched from Edwards Air Force Base, California with the aid of\n\na single 115,000-pound rocket-assist booster. The supersonic missile attained 325\n\nmph in 4 seconds after leaving the mobile ground launcher. It was faster then mach\n\n2 and had a range of more than 1,000 miles.\n\nPhoto: 8 x 10 original photo in excellent condition with official Navy stamp and\n\ndescription on reverse on a fiber based paper.\n\nUSAF Martin XB-61 MATADOR Pilotless Bomber\n\nPhoto: 8 x 10 in good condition on a fiber based paper. With the hip mounted\n\nwing, this is either the XB-61 or YB-61 being launched from the test range at\n\nHolloman AFB prior to testing being moved to the USAF Missile Test Center in\n\nFlorida in 1951.\n\nDescription: on reverse reads, \"The Martin B-61 Matador pilotless bomber was\n\nthe initial equipment for the 1st Pilotless Bomber Squadron (Light) that was\n\nactivated around 1951 for the USAF Missile Test Center, Cocoa, Fla.\"\n\nPogo-Hi Type IIE3c Rocket\n\nPhoto: Nice fiber based paper with \"Aeronca Manufacturing Corp.\" stamp on\n\nreverse. Aeronca was a component manufacturer.. 8x10 in excellent condition.\n\nAeronica was the successful bidder when the Army at WSMR went out for bid to\n\nsupply the Pogo-Hi as a range service\n\nDescription: Pogo: In 1953, the Physical Science Laboratory of the New Mexico\n\nState University developed the Pogo vehicle under a U.S. Navy contract to provide a\n\nhigh-altitude radar target. The Pogo rocket consisted of a solid-propellant rocket\n\nmotor and a large nose cone. The rocket's four square tail fins were canted to\n\ninduce a stabilizing spin. At the peak of the trajectory (at more than 30 km (100000\n\nft)), the nose cone was separated and began to descend under a large (6 m (20 ft)\n\ndiameter) metallized parachute. This parachute made an excellent target for tests of\n\nradars and radar-guided missiles.\n\nPogo-Hi: Upgraded versions of the Pogo target were generally referred to as\n\nPogo-Hi. They were flown in several different configurations, and used a variety of\n\nmotors like the Cajun, Apache and Asp. The major external difference between the\n\nPogo-Hi vehicles and the original Pogo configuration were the former's triangular tail\n\nfins.\n\nUSAF Boeing M-99 BOMARC 624 XY-1 Missile Launch\n\nPhoto: Photo is 8x10 and in excellent condition on fiber based paper.\n\nDescription: Typed press description on reverse reads, \" Fired by an electronic\n\nimpulse 1500 miles away in Kingston, N.Y., an Air Force BOMARC is successfully\n\nlaunched at the Atlantic Missile Range, Cape Canaveral, Florida. The interceptor\n\nmissile was hurtled at a drone B-17 bomber about 250 miles of the Florida coast.\n\nWhile the missile failed to intercept the target airplane, the primary objective of the\n\nshot was to test the BOMARC working with SAGE, a complex network of radar sites\n\nand computers that help screen the nation from enemy air attacks.\"\n\nU.S. Air Force Vintage photo SM-62 SNARK Missile\n\nDescription: The Snark was essentially a small, turbojet-powered, unmanned\n\naircraft, although it was officially designated a surface-to-surface ICM,\n\nIntercontinental Missile. It was designed to be fired from a short mobile launcher\n\nby means of two solid-fueled rocket boosters. Once air-borne, the Snark was\n\npowered by a single Pratt and Whitney J-57 turbojet I engine capable of cruising at\n\nMach 0.9 to an altitude of approximately 150,000 feet. After a programmed flight of\n\n1,500 to 5,500 nautical miles, the Snark's airframe separated from its nose cone,\n\nand the missile's nuclear warhead followed a ballistic trajectory to its target.\n\nPhoto: Photo in excellent condition on fiber based paper with Northrop press\n\nrelease taped to reverse.\n\nU.S. Navy REGULUS 1 Missile\n\nVintage press release photo on fiber based paper with typed description on reverse.\n\nThe text on reverse reads: \"The missile touched down, hitting the runway at a\n\nspeed in excess of 225 miles per hour. As its landing gear contacted the concrete,\n\na door flapped open near its tail and its parachute brake billowed out, slowing the\n\nheadlong plunge\".\n\nOn the far right you can see the TV-2 chase aircraft just entering the picture frame.\n\nU.S. Air Force Titan-3C, Flight ID 3C-11\n\nDescription: Lift off Titan-3C- 6-16-66 Test No. 1319 complex 41. The 4th Titan 3C\n\nlaunched from the Cape Kennedy AFS by the U.S. Air Force successfully orbited eight\n\nsatellites. Also in the photo, you can also see the Apollo Saturn V 500F on Pad A of\n\nLaunch Complex 39.\n\nPhoto: 8x10 in excellent condition with \"U.S. AIR FORCE PHOTO\" stamped on\n\nreverse with detailed description.\n\nU.S. Air Force Martin Company Titan 1\n\nPhoto: 8 X 10 vintage Martin photo with detailed release attached to reverse. Fiber\n\nbased paper with Martin Company Stamp on reverse. Photo ID: MBX000235.\n\nDescription: An Air Force Titan 1 intercontinental ballistic missile rises from a\n\nlauncher at Vandenberg AFB, Calif., on the beginning of a flight of more than 4,000\n\nmiles down the Pacific Missile Range. Prior to ignition, the 98-foot-tall ICBM rose on\n\nan elevator from its underground silo. The silo doors may be seen at the bottom of\n\nthe photo.\n\nU.S. Air Force Martin TM-61B MATADOR\n\nPhoto: 8 x 10 in excellent condition on a fiber based paper with Air Force Photo\n\nstamp on reverse from Langley AFB, Hampton, VA. In 1955, the USAF had second\n\nthoughts about designating missiles as aircraft, and the B-61A was redesignated as\n\nTM-61A Tactical Missile. The TM-61B was a significantly improved missile. Because\n\nof the many changes, it was redesignated as TM-76 Mace. So, with the name\n\n\"Matador\" on this Missile in this photo, this is most likely the first TM-61B developed.\n\nDescription: HQ Tactical Air Command attached descriptions reads, \"Built by the\n\nMartin Company, the TM-61B is a replica of the TM-61A now in use by TAC but is\n\ncapable of flying father and has an improved guidance equipment which gives it\n\nmore accuracy then the earlier version. The Matador is hurled into the air by a\n\nbooster rocket and when the booster's fuel is expended it continues its flight with a\n\njet-powered Allison engine. It has a speed of over 650 miles per hour and a ceiling\n\nbeyond 35,000 feet. \"\n\nU.S. Navy Bendix Talos RTV-N-6a4 Surface-To-Air Missile Launch\n\nPhoto: 8 x 10 in excellent condition on fiber based paper with \"Official U.S. Navy\"\n\nand \"U.S. Navy Ordnance Missile Test Facility\" stamps on reverse from White\n\nSands Proving Ground. Photo is date stamped Jul 2, 1958.\n\nDescription: American Navy long-range ramjet-powered surface-to-air missile. The\n\nfirst full Talos prototype (XSAM-N-6) flew in October 1952, and later that year, the\n\nfirst successful intercept was made by a RTV-N-6a4 test vehicle. Because the\n\nrequired missile performance was increased several times during development, the\n\nTalos SAM did not become fully operational until 1959, almost a decade later than\n\noriginally planned. Bendix became prime contractor for Talos production.\n\nU.S. Army Douglas M-31 Hontest John & XM-47 Little John\n\nPhoto: 8 x 10 in excellent condition on a fiber based paper.\n\nDescription: Photo shows the M-31 Honest John on the mobile M-289 launcher.\n\nNext to it sits the XM-47 Little John. The Honest John was the U.S. Army's first\n\nnuclear-armed surface-to-surface rocket. In September 1953, the Honest John was\n\nreclassed as M31, and the first operational units were deployed in Europe in Spring\n\n1954. The Little John was the smallest nuclear-capable rocket the U.S. Army ever\n\ndeployed. Studies to develop a lightweight rocket based on the M31/MGR-1 Honest\n\nJohn to give airborne Army units a nuclear capability began in 1953 under the name\n\nHonest John Junior. After preliminary studies by Douglas during 1954, the\n\ndevelopment program - renamed as Little John - was officially started at Redstone\n\nArsenal in June 1955. In June 1956, the first launch of the XM47 Little John\n\noccurred. The XM47 was only an interim rocket, essentially a rocket test vehicle,\n\nand was used for training and testing purposes only.\n\nJuno II, Vintage B/W Glossy - U.S. Air Force Photo ID: PL5-48757\n\nPhoto: 8 x 10 in excellent condition with \"Official U.S. Air Force Photo\" text on\n\nreverse from Patrick AFB.

Virtually identical\n\nto Surveyor 5, this spacecraft carried a television camera, a small bar magnet\n\nattached to one footpad, and an alpha-scattering instrument as well as the\n\nnecessary engineering equipment. It landed on November 10, 1967, in Sinus Medii,\n\nthe center of the moon's visible hemisphere. On November 24, 1967, the spacecraft\n\nwas shut down for the 2-week lunar night. Contact was made on December 14,\n\n1967, but no useful data were obtained.\n\nLaunch Information:\n\nLaunch Date/Time: 1967-11-07 at 07:39:00 UTC\n\nLaunch Site: Cape Canaveral, Fla. Pad 36B\n\nLaunch Vehicle: Atlas-Centaur\n\nPhoto: 8 x 10 B/W glossy on fiber based paper with purple NASA detailed text on\n\nreverse.\n\nDescription: Titan/Centaur-4, to be used to place the first of two Viking spacecraft\n\non trajectories for Mars in August, was rolled from the Solid Motor Assembly to\n\nLaunch Complex 41 at the Titan III Complex today. The spacecraft and payload\n\nfairing which will protect it during its flight through the atmosphere will be mated\n\nwith the launch vehicle in late July, bringing the total height of the space vehicle to\n\n160 feet.\n\nAtlas Agena D - Lunar Orbiter 1\n\nPhoto: 8 x 10 in excellent condition on a nice fiber based paper.\n\nDescription: The Atlas Agena-D Launch Vehicle stands ready to boost the 850\n\npound Lunar Orbiter-A spacecraft to the vicinity of the Moon. The first in a series of 5\n\nplanned missions. The Lunar Orbiter series took photos of lunar surface from\n\nselenocentric orbit. The lunar orbiter used a film scanning process taken from a\n\nclassified program and returned high-resolution images of the surface back to\n\nEarth. These images were vital to planning of the subsequent Surveyor and Apollo\n\nlunar landings.\n\nU.S. Air Force Vintage Color Photo - Polaris A1E-2 Underwater Launch\n\nPhoto: 8 x 10 vintage color on a fiber based paper with repeating \"A KODAK\n\nPAPER\" watermarks on reverse along with Patrick Air Force Base stamp.\n\nDescription: 20 July 1960 - Polaris A1E-1 which was launched by the USS George\n\nWashington (SSBN-598) for the first successful underwater launch of the Polaris\n\nA-1 SLBM, Apogee 500 km (310 mi). The launch of a Lockheed-built Polaris A1\n\nFleet Ballistic Missile was the first in history from a submerged submarine, the\n\nUSS George Washington (SSBN 598). It occurred July 20, 1960, off Cape Canaveral,\n\nFlorida, and within three hours a second Polaris test missile was launched. I\n\nbelieve this photo is of the 2nd launch, Polaris A1E-2.
