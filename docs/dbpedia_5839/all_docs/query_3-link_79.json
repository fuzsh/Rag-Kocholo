        "text": "The social media stars turning followers into fortunes.\n\nEdited by Steven Bertoni. Reporting by Steffi Cao, Matt Craig and Alexandra S. Levine. Photography by Devin Yalkin.\n\nCreators. Influencers. Streamers. Vloggers. Whatever you call them, these powerful social media personalities are calling the shots in entertainment and advertising.\n\nThis year, the 50 honorees on our second annual Forbes Top Creator list harnessed their combined 2.6 billion followers to haul in an estimated $700 million in earnings. That's up more than 20% from 2022's $570 million score. They’re not alone, in 2023 brands will spend an estimated $21 billion on creator marketing, up from just $1.6 billion seven years ago, according to the social media research firm, Influencer Marketing Hub.\n\n\"Influencers are more trusted by their audiences than ads. They can sell out products in minutes. They can cause a flash mob that shuts down a major city,\" says Erin Lanuti, the chief innovation officer at ad titan Omnicom PR Group.\n\nTo rank the world's Top Creators, Forbes crunched data on the estimated earnings, follower counts, engagement rates, and entrepreneurial activities of thousands of internet personalities with the help of the creator marketing firm, Influential.\n\nThe result: The 50 people tapping their massive fan bases to reshape the worlds of media, marketing, entertainment, and taste.\n\n1-10\n\nNo. 01\n\nJimmy Donaldson (MrBeast)\n\nEarnings: $82M\n\nTotal Followers: 312M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 9.8%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 4\n\nWith more than 300 million followers, MrBeast’s fan base is nearly as large as the U.S. population. MrBeast’s power and popularity stem from his high production videos and stunts that include surviving in Antarctica for 50 hours and building a Wonka chocolate factory. The YouTube titan, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, has used his massive clout to earn a fortune in digital ad dollars—and build a real-world empire. Beast-based brands include Feastables snack bars and the MrBeast Burgers restaurant chain, plus Donaldson’s sprawling merch line. (Disclosure: Donaldson is slated to become a member of Forbes’ board when a planned sale of the company is completed.)\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 02\n\nOlajide Olatunji (KSI)\n\nEarnings: $24M\n\nTotal Followers: 112M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 6.5%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 4\n\nOlajide Olatunji, known as KSI, began reacting to FIFA video games on YouTube in 2009, attracting millions of followers for his outlandish humor. He's since gone from comedian to contender, transforming into a rapper and boxer, releasing two singles in 2023, and securing a multiyear distribution deal for his promotional company, Misfits Boxing. He's the face of Prime Hydration alongside Logan Paul (#6 on the Top Creators list). The sports drink became the official drink for FC Barcelona, UFC, and Arsenal this year. Controversy has followed Olatunji for boxing decorum, misogynistic content, and racist and transphobic slurs, but he always turns the scandals into views, both online and in the ring.\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 03\n\nJake Paul\n\nEarnings: $34M\n\nTotal Followers: 66M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 1.6%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 4\n\nThe outrage cycle is no stranger to Jake Paul, the Vine star turned boxer whose stunts on YouTube—such as surprise tattoos, eating dog food, and bathing in Icy Hot—have attracted millions of fans. And attracted controversy including allegations of sexual misconduct, scamming fans, and most recently, an SEC charge for undisclosed cryptocurrency sponsorship. Still, Paul’s ability to orchestrate spectacles made him one of the highest-paid athletes in 2022. He landed a sponsorship with the energy drink Celsius, founded the sports betting app \"Betr\" that raised a $50 million Series A, and this year, signed an MMA contract to fight in a new pay-per-view division.\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 04\n\nRhett & Link\n\nEarnings: $35M\n\nTotal Followers: 51M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 0.85%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 4\n\nBest friends since grade school, the two former engineers—real names Rhett James McLaughlin and Charles Lincoln “Link” Neal III—began posting comedy shows on YouTube in 2006. Today their Burbank, California, entertainment company, Mythical, employs more than 100 people who create YouTube series like the daily variety show Good Mythical Morning, the Mythical Kitchen cooking show and sketch comedy channel Smosh for their 18 million subscribers. The pair produces podcasts, live touring, and livestream events–books and TV shows too. Meanwhile their Creator Accelerator fund invests in upcoming creators.\n\nView Profile | Watch Interview\n\nNo. 05\n\nCharli D’Amelio\n\nEarnings: $23M\n\nTotal Followers: 213M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 0.7%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 4\n\nCharli D’Amelio continues to reign supreme as the top female creator on TikTok and the Forbes Top Creators list—and the D’Amelio dynasty is only growing. The Connecticut native, now one of the most viral stars on the internet, has become a face of Prada and a walking advertisement for Amazon, CeraVe and SKIMS, the clothing line co-founded by Kim Kardashian. D’Amelio’s year-old fragrance, Born Dreamer, is on shelves across the U.S. and Europe. On clothing racks, you’ll find Social Tourist, the brand she and her sister Dixie (#18 on this list) launched with Hollister in 2021. The family is shooting the third season of their reality series \"The D’Amelio Show\" for Hulu and also running their recently-launched shoe brand, D’Amelio Footwear. All this, before Charli’s turned 20.\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 06\n\nLogan Paul\n\nEarnings: $21M\n\nTotal Followers: 74M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 1.25%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 4\n\nLogan Paul first went viral on Vine with his brother Jake (#3 on the Top Creator list), using that momentum to open his YouTube to post vlogs and stunts, like giving away iPhones and fighting celebrities like Kevin Hart. The channel has drawn 23.6 million subscribers, but Paul’s alarming and insensitive videos, including showing a dead body in Japan’s “suicide forest,” led him to become temporarily demonetized on the platform. So the creator took his knack for shock value and pivoted into wrestling. He resigned his WWE deal this year, and has continued to promote Prime Hydration alongside YouTuber KSI (#2 on the Top Creators List). Paul also co-hosts a podcast with his brother Impaulsive, where they address continued controversy.\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 07\n\nElliot Tebele (F*ckJerry)\n\nEarnings: $30M\n\nTotal Followers: 17M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 1%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 4\n\nThe original meme king, whose real name is Elliot Tebele, is the brain behind social media empire FJerryLLC. Its accounts, including F*ckJerry, BeigeCardigan, DudeWithSign, and JerryNews, attract 40 million followers. But his big bucks come from his board game empire that includes his party game “What Do You Meme”, which is sold nationwide at Target, Walmart, and Amazon. Tebele has also branched into the booze business with viral tequila brand Jaja.\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 08\n\nEmma Chamberlain\n\nEarnings: $20M\n\nTotal Followers: 28M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 6.25%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 4\n\nSince filming YouTube videos in her mother’s house, Emma Chamberlain dropped out of high school, amassed 27.9 million followers, and turned her dry humor and passion for fashion into a lifestyle empire. Chamberlain was one of the first creators to secure a high fashion deal with Louis Vuitton, and has continued to ink lucrative partnerships with companies including Cartier, Lancome, Levi’s, Aritzia, and Canon. Her beverage company Chamberlain Coffee sells at Walmart and Sprouts, and her podcast, “Anything Goes,” began an exclusive Spotify video deal in February.\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 09\n\nMatt Rife\n\nEarnings: $25M\n\nTotal Followers: 22M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 10.7%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 3\n\nRife, a stand up comedian, is using social media stardom to sell out live shows. After a decade performing at small clubs, Rife found TikTok fame after a clip of him joking with a female fan went viral. Over the last year, the Ohio native has amassed 17 million TikTok followers and sold more than 750,000 tickets for his international tour. His Netflix stand-up special “Natural Selection” is due to stream later this year.\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 10\n\nBrent Rivera\n\nEarnings: $17.5M\n\nTotal Followers: 96M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 11.25%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 3\n\nBrent Rivera has mastered several of the world’s most popular social media platforms—starting with Vine, then YouTube, and finally TikTok—where his comedic videos (which often feature his younger sister, Lexi) now attract an audience of 50 million fans. But the 25-year-old Streamy Award-winner is as much a businessman as he is a creator, partnering with giant brands like Starbucks, Xbox and Prada. Meanwhile, his Amp Studios, a media company he started in 2017 to support other creators and emerging brands.\n\nView Profile\n\n11-20\n\nNo. 11\n\nKhabane (Khaby) Lame\n\nEarnings: $16.5M\n\nTotal Followers: 244M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 0.85%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 4\n\nFor Lame, silence is golden. TikTok’s million-dollar mime fetches $750,000 to feature a product in a TikTok and Instagram post. Lame, who in 2019 was assembling car filters in a factory outside Turin, now has more than 240 million social media followers and has scored lucrative partnerships with Hugo Boss, State Farm, and Middle East bank QNB. This fall, he was featured as a character in Fortnite, the blockbuster multiplayer video game with more than 230 million monthly players.\n\nView Profile | Watch Interview\n\nNo. 12\n\nAlexandra Cooper\n\nEarnings: $20M\n\nTotal Followers: 5M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 14%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 4\n\nCall her mogul. Cooper, who shot to fame with the podcast “Call Her Daddy,” is the queen of streams, with a reported three-year, $60 million deal with Spotify. Cooper, who discusses sex and relationships with stars like Janelle Monáe and Post Malone, is the most popular female podcaster on the network. This June, she launched Trending, a Gen Z-focused media company cofounded with fiancé Matt Kaplan. In September, her podcast company, The Unwell Network, debuted the show “Hot Mess” with TikTok star Alix Earle (#42 on the Top Creators list) .\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 13\n\nMark Edward Fischbach (Markiplier)\n\nEarnings: $30M\n\nTotal Followers: 68M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 0.40%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 4\n\nIn December, YouTuber Mark Fischbach pledged to start a risqué OnlyFans—to raise money for charity—if his 35 million YouTube subscribers could help push his two podcasts, “Distractible” and “Go! My Favorite Sports Team,” to the top of the charts. They did, and his \"tasteful nudes\" drew more than 120,000 subscribers. A few months later, Spotify signed Markiplier to a multimillion-dollar podcast contract. In addition to his popular Let’s Play videos, Fischbach runs the Cloak clothing brand and is working on a forthcoming horror feature film for which he co-wrote, directed, and starred.\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 15\n\nSean McLoughlin (Jacksepticeye)\n\nEarnings: $27M\n\nTotal Followers: 26M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 0.60%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 4\n\nIrish YouTuber Sean McLoughlin has shown a knack for selling hoodies and t-shirts to his gaming fans. Cloak, the clothing brand he co-founded with fellow creator Markiplier (#12 on the Top Creators list), was one of his biggest revenue sources in the past year. In December, he harnessed the brand to raise more than $10 million for the charity World Central Kitchen by selling “Thankmas” t-shirts. Earlier this year, he also relaunched his \"Top Of The Mornin’ Coffee\" brand. “I don’t pretend to be like a business mogul,” he told Forbes in March. “I just try and make fun things that people can react to.”\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 15\n\nHuda Kattan\n\nEarnings: $13M\n\nTotal Followers: 69M\n\nAvg. Engagement: 1.40%\n\nEntrepreneurship Score: 4\n\nGrowing up in Oklahoma, Huda Kattan often spoke about the bullying she faced from growing up as an Iraqi-American in a predominantly white environment. She eventually left the Midwest to become a celebrity makeup artist in Dubai and Los Angeles. In 2010, she started posting her tips and tricks on a WordPress blog called “Huda Beauty,” which championed diversity in beauty. Since then, her cosmetic brand, Huda Beauty, has become an international sensation, retailing in Sephora and Harrods. Kattan has expanded to skincare with her brand Wishful Skincare. Thanks to her two companies, Kattan has a networth of $400 million, making her one of America’s richest self-made women.\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 16\n\nPreston Arsement (PrestonPlayz)\n\nEarnings: $35M\n\nTotal Followers: 26M\n\nAvg.

He landed an eight-figure deal with Spotter for a share of his YouTube back catalog, brought his brand deal negotiations in-house, and released his own graphic novel, “PrestonPlayz: The Mystery of the Super Spooky Secret House.”\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 17\n\nRyan Kaji\n\nEarnings: $35M\n\nTotal Followers: 36M\n\nAvg.

His family has since turned his influence into a company, Ryan’s World, that sells toys, board games, and clothing. Kaji has entered video game collaborations with Roblox and Xbox too. His wildly popular YouTube channel gets more than 3 billion views a year, reaping an annual eight-figure windfall from Google AdSense.\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 18\n\nDixie D’Amelio\n\nEarnings: $11.5M\n\nTotal Followers: 91M\n\nAvg.

With a loyal audience nearly 100 million strong across TikTok, Instagram and her fast-growing YouTube channel, Dixie has parlayed her internet fame into a career spanning music, fashion and entertainment. The singer released her debut album, \"A Letter to Me\", in 2022; her casual clothing line Social Tourist (with Charli and Hollister) in 2021; and the third season of \"The D’Amelio Show\", her family’s reality TV series on Hulu, this fall. She has partnered with high-end brands including Valentino, Burberry and Ralph Lauren, and this past spring, she dropped a shoe with Puma and launched D’Amelio Footwear under the family’s consumer product company, D’Amelio Brands.\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 19\n\nZach King\n\nEarnings: $13M\n\nTotal Followers: 125M\n\nAvg.

It’s hard to look away from Zach King’s short, enthralling videos—centered on magic tricks and optical illusions—that have rocketed him to mega-fame on YouTube, TikTok and across the internet. His illusions have landed him collabs with special effects legend Adam Savage, actors Terry Crews, Zachary Levi and Gal Gadot, The Jonas Brothers; and several Korean pop stars. (King also recently won the 2023 Streamy Award for Visual and Special Effects.) Some of the magic is, of course, King’s masterful filmmaking—one example being an early, viral TikTok where King, dressed as a Hogwarts reject, appears to be flying on a broomstick, only to reveal he’s actually on a longboard. (The clip won the Guinness World Record for the most-viewed TikTok video of all time as of 2022.)\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 20\n\nDrew Desbordes (Druski)\n\nEarnings: $10M\n\nTotal Followers: 12M\n\nAvg.

Meanwhile, her eponymous brand, Chiara Ferragni, sells eyewear, shoes, ready-to-wear clothing, makeup, and swimsuits.

The Louisiana-born creator has continued to reach new heights from her humble beginnings, branching out from perfume to film. In September, she released her brand, Addison Rae Fragrance. She is slated to star in two upcoming feature movies: the thriller film \"Thanksgiving\" and \"Animal Friends,\" a live-action hybrid movie starring Ryan Reynolds and Jason Momoa.

The Dallas-based lifestyle and fashion influencer’s Instagram and TikTok spotlight life with her husband, toddlers and mother. Millions follow Austin to share in her travels, time off with friends and shopping escapades. She has deals with partners including Tarte Cosmetics, Stanley 1913 and Big Ass Luxury Candles, but the big bucks come from her own brand Divi, which makes scalp products to fight hair loss. For Austin, the problem’s personal—she has struggled with hair loss and says the condition almost ended her creator career. The biz, bootstrapped from an extra bedroom at home in 2021, has since hit a $175 million valuation and its hair products can now be found at Ulta stores across the country (a new shampoo and conditioner are due out by year’s end). She’s also started an investing arm, Dani Austin Ventures, to support up-and-coming consumer brands.\n\nView Profile\n\nNo. 29\n\nMark Rober\n\nEarnings: $6M\n\nTotal Followers: 29M\n\nAvg.
