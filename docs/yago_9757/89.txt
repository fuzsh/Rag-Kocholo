The Rudolph Collection covers the filmmaking and photography careers, respectively, of husband and wife Alan and Joyce Rudolph. Included are production notes, photos, script drafts and revisions, and photographs Joyce took onset for most of Alan’s films, as well as a host of others such as “A Nightmare on Elm Street,” “The Terminator,” “Major League,” “Guilty by Suspicion,” and “The Crossing Guard.”

Alan Rudolph’s films are often quirky ensemble-based stories — often centering around lonely people and mysterious wanderers looking for love who find themselves in somewhat troubled, precarious situations. Frequently filmed in artificial environments, his characters collide with one another in an attempt to find meaning in life. They then wander off, slightly battered, searching for another brief encounter.

He began his professional filmmaking career as an assistant director before being hired by Robert Altman to work on “The Long Goodbye” and later his masterpiece, “Nashville.” The two remained lifelong friends and collaborators as Altman served as producer on many of Rudolph’s future projects.

Director of some twenty films, he is perhaps best known for “Welcome to L.A.,” “Remember My Name,” “Choose Me,” “The Moderns,” “Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,” and “Afterglow.”
