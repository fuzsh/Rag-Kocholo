        "text": "The following review was written by Ultimate Rabbit correspondent, Tony Farinella.\n\nA little over a year ago, Warner Brothers Home Entertainment released a set which included the first four “Rocky” films along with the director’s cut of “Rocky IV.” Many fans were dissatisfied with this release and pointed out audio and video issues along with the fact that “Rocky V” and “Rocky Balboa” were not included in the set. Now, Warner Brothers has released a new edition of the “Rocky” films on 4K in a set entitled “Rocky: The Ultimate Knockout Edition,” and it includes replacement discs for the issues with the first four films and also includes “Rocky V,” “Rocky Balboa” and “Rocky Balboa: The Director’s Cut.” There is also a Blu-ray disc which includes special features for the first four films. I went back and looked at my review from March 2023 for “Rocky: The Knockout Collection,” and I didn’t feel as though the issues were as egregiously bad as other reviewers made them out to be.\n\nWith all six of the Rocky films now out on 4K, people are going to be wondering if this set is worth its hefty price tag. Before I get into all of that, let’s briefly discuss the films. The original “Rocky,” released in 1976, won Best Picture and put Sylvester Stallone on the map. It is the ultimate underdog sports movie and a film which is quoted and remembered to this very day. Even after Stallone is long gone, fans and historians will always remember him as Rocky Balboa. Of course, he also played John Rambo, but people really connect with Rocky and can even see themselves in the character. It was the right film with the right actor at the right time.\n\nThere is much debate and handwringing over the sequels. I love all of the “Rocky” films, warts and all, as they play a part in the story of Rocky Balboa and his ups and downs as a character. We see him start from nothing, rise, fall, and rise again. I think you have to appreciate the good, bad and the ugly all of the films as they all serve a specific purpose for this franchise. Of course, my favorite film will always be the first “Rocky.” After that, I’d probably go with “Rocky II,” “Rocky Balboa,” “Rocky IV,” “Rocky III,” and “Rocky V.” If you ask me this question in a few months, my answer might change again.\n\nThe original “Rocky,” the one which started it all, is about a low-level boxer who is looking for a chance to prove he’s not another bum from the neighborhood. He mostly takes outlaw fights which make little to no money. One day, Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers) is looking for an opponent in order to sell his next fight. When he stumbles upon Rocky Balboa, an underdog fighter from Philadelphia, he figures he can use this David vs. Goliath story to sell some tickets and get an easy victory. He ends up getting more than he bargained for from Rocky Balboa, who is feeling the support of his newfound love interest, Adrian (Talia Shire) and her brother Paulie (Burt Young). All he wants is a chance to prove his self-worth.\n\nIn “Rocky II,” he needs to prepare for his rematch against Apollo Creed. Can he defeat Apollo Creed this time, or will Creed destroy him and show that their last fight was simply a fluke? Even though Creed won the first fight by decision, Rocky showed he can last in the ring with the Heavyweight Champion of the World.\n\nIn “Rocky III,” Rocky needs to learn how to handle the biggest obstacle of all: success. How will he deal with money and fame? He also encounters Clubber Lang, played by Mr. T and Thunderlips, played by Hulk Hogan.\n\nIn “Rocky IV,” Ivan Drago (Dolph Lundgren), a menacing Russian, awaits him. I mentioned in my initial review of the first set how I preferred “Rocky IV: Rocky vs. Drago” over the original cut of “Rocky IV.”\n\nIn “Rocky V,” he has to get a handle on being a dad and life outside of the ring.\n\nIn “Rocky Balboa,” he’s past his prime, old and beaten down, but he’s looking to find an outlet to deal with his pain.\n\nI imagine most people reading this review are familiar with each and every film in the “Rocky” series, so I don’t imagine these are major spoilers. They simply serve as a refresher in case you haven’t seen the films in a while. You are reading this review to see if this box set is worth the money, as mentioned previously. The answer is both yes and no. The 4K transfers are cinematic and an upgrade over the Blu-rays. The “Rocky” films have never looked or sounded better in any other format. The audio issues are also cleaned up on all of the films, even though I didn’t really notice them with the last “Rocky” set. This is all of the “Rocky” films, as the “Creed” films are their own separate entity, even though they are in the “Rocky” universe.\n\nThis set is going for about $90 to $110 depending on where you purchase it from, as Gruv.com has it for the cheapest I’ve seen. The discs themselves are great. Warner Brothers fails massively with the packaging of this set. It comes in a flimsy cardboard slipcover with discs that can be looked through in a flipper case. These movies are important to me, and they are also important to a lot of film fans out there. They went cheap with the packaging, as the cardboard slipcover is not a thick and sturdy box that can protect the films or the case. The discs are also stuck in a flipper case which shows a lot of off-gassing, which is this greasy substance that is really difficult to remove from the back of the disc holders.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed watching the films on 4K, and I’m happy Warner Brothers decided to release this “Ultimate Knockout Edition” of all of the “Rocky films. At its price point, however, I would expect a lot more on the packaging side of things. The packaging and the case are truly a mess, and it makes it hard to fully enjoy this set. As a collector, we buy movies for the movies and also the packaging. We are not simply buying the discs of these films. I wish they would have shown a little tender loving care to this set. They should have released these in individual cases in a sturdy box set which holds them all together.\n\nRatings:\n\n“Rocky”: * * * * out of * * * *\n\n“Rocky II”: * * * ½ out of * * * *\n\n“Rocky III”: * * ½ out of * * * *\n\n“Rocky IV”: * * * out of * * * *\n\n“Rocky IV: Rocky vs Drago – The Ultimate Director’s Cut”: * * * ½ out of * * * *\n\n“Rocky V”: * * out of * * * *\n\n“Rocky Balboa”: * * * ½ out of * * * *\n\n“Rocky Balboa: Director’s Cut”: * * * out of * * * *\n\nVideo Info: All of the films are released on Dolby Vision, which leads to some very impressive looking visuals. The best-looking films in this set, in order, are “Rocky V,” “Rocky II,” “Rocky IV: Rocky vs. Drago,” “Rocky IV,” “Rocky,” “Rocky III,” “Rocky Balboa” and “Rocky Balboa: The Director’s Cut.” It was a bit of a surprise to me that “Rocky Balboa” was the weakest link out of all these films from a visual standpoint. It was the film I was most excited to see upgraded to 4K, but it looks rather bland and vanilla. This is probably because they put both versions of this film on one 4K, which is asking a lot out of one disc, although it didn’t affect both versions of “Rocky IV” for some reason. It’s surprising to see that the worst film in the “Rocky” franchise, “Rocky V,” is the best-looking one out of the bunch.\n\nAudio Info: All of the audio issues are fixed here from the previous release, but once again, I didn’t notice a big difference the last time they released these films on 4K. I know that Warner Brothers made sure to correct the issues from the last release based on what I’ve read online. You don’t have to worry about a disc replacement program with any of the audio tracks here. None of the films come with Dolby Atmos, which is a bit of a bummer, as the Rocky films seem perfect for Dolby Atmos. The audio is still really good, but this would have given it that extra boost.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\n“Rocky”\n\n• Audio Commentary with director John Avildsen and producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff, Talia Shire, Carl Weathers, Burt Young, and Garrett Brown\n\n• Audio Commentary with Lou Duva and Bert Sugar\n\n• Audio Commentary with Sylvester Stallone\n\n“Rocky Balboa”\n\n• Audio Commentary with Writer/Director Sylvester Stallone\n\n• Deleted Scenes\n\n• Skill vs. Will: The Making of Rocky Balboa\n\n• Reality in the Ring: Filming Rocky’s Final Fight\n\n• Virtual Champion: Creating the Computer Fighter\n\n• Fight Makeup\n\n“Rocky” Bonus Disc\n\n• 8MM Home Movies of Rocky\n\n• 3 Rounds with Lou Duva\n\n• Steadicam: Then and Now with Garrett Brown\n\n• Make-Up!

As of right now, the price is way too high considering the packaging on this set and the lack of original special features. My feeling is this—if you are going to release a set like this, which is near and dear to so many people’s hearts, why not release it the right way and take your time? I would have loaded it up with as many special features as possible and spent a little more money on better packaging and a better case. The films, for the most part, look good and the audio is solid. I’m not trying to sound picky here or look a gift horse in the mouth, but this set should cost $60 and not $90 to $110, considering how they threw it all together in this packaging. You will enjoy the films, which is the most important part, but a little quality control would have gone a long way. This “Rocky” set on 4K does come recommended, but I recommend you wait for it to go on sale and not rush out and buy it right away.\n\n**Disclaimer** I received a copy of this film from Warner Brothers to review for free. The opinions and statements in the review are mine and mine alone.\n\nThe following review was written by Ultimate Rabbit correspondent, Tony Farinella.\n\nWhen it comes to Prince’s music, I’m a fan, but I wouldn’t say I listen to his albums religiously. I respect his contributions to the music industry, and I can certainly appreciate and admire the amount of effort and passion that goes into his performances. He gives it his all when he’s on stage. Because of this, I was curious to see “Purple Rain” for the first time, especially since it was getting a 40th anniversary 4K release. I love movies about music, so I thought it would be a film that resonated with me as a movie and music fan. I went into “Purple Rain” with high hopes, and I thought it would be a film that would make a powerful impression on me as a first-time viewer. Even though I’ve seen a lot of movies, there are always a number of them which have slipped through the cracks throughout the years.\n\nPrince stars as The Kid, a front man for a band called The Revolution, and he has a lot of talent, energy and love which shines through in every performance. However, he’s not exactly happy with his life. When he comes home, he sees his father constantly abusing his mother, so his one outlet for his anger and frustration is music. When he’s on that stage, he bares his soul to the audience. His performances take place at the First Avenue Night Club. The other two acts that perform there are The Time, led by Morris Day, and also Dez Dickerson and his band The Modernaires. It’s a competition every night to see which band can leave the biggest impression on the audience.\n\nIn addition to his problems at home, two members of his band, Wendy and Lisa, played by Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, are not happy with The Kid, as they feel as though their contributions to The Revolution are not being taken seriously. It is all about The Kid and his vision. There is also a new female musician who has come into First Avenue from New Orleans named Apollonia (Apollonia Kotero) who catches the eye of The Kid. He is falling hard and fast for her, but he wonders if he can maintain a relationship with her because of his troubled life at home. Will the sins of the father soon become his own sins as well? Apollonia is also getting offers to start an all-girl band from Morris.\n\n“Purple Rain,” sad to say, was a big dud for me. The songs and the music are great in. From “Purple Rain” to “When Doves Cry” to “Let’s Go Crazy”, the film has some fantastic musical numbers in it, and they really come to life on screen. When the movie isn’t on stage, however, it suffers in a big way. The characters are written with very little thought behind them. The Kid wants to play music and be successful. His father is a wifebeater. His mother just seems to be there to get beaten up by the father. Apollonia is just there to be an object of desire. All of this feels very self-serving for Prince. Yes, it is his movie, but there is little to no story here and the plot is paper thin.\n\nFor a movie that is almost two-hours long, the music can only sustain the viewer for so long, especially if we don’t care about the people that are on stage performing the music. When there is a dramatic moment near the end of the film with The Kid’s father, why should we care? Yes, his performance of “Purple Rain” is powerful and the song is fantastic, but everything leading up to that moment has shown him to be a no-good woman abusing jerk who is selfish. Purple Rain really needed to get into the nuts and bolts of this character’s mindset in order for us to fully invest ourselves in his story arc. As an actor, Prince is rather lifeless and bland on screen as well. He’s not a good actor. If they wanted to just make this a Prince concert film, it might have worked. As a narrative film, there is a lot to be desired here.\n\nWith “Purple Rain,” I kept waiting for the musical scenes to return as the scenes outside of First Avenue were incredibly run-of-the-mill. This film needed more balance. They needed to make The Kid’s life outside of First Avenue a lot more complex and well-written. This way, when he performs on stage, the impact is felt in a more powerful way by the viewer. I’m not being a contrarian here, but I really don’t understand why this film is so popular. If I want to listen to Prince’s music, I can listen to it whenever I want to on my iPhone. I watched “Purple Rain” for an interesting story that would be enhanced by the music. The story didn’t need to be great or out of this world. It just needed to have a little more meat on the bones. All of the attention went to the musical numbers, and the acting scenes are simply there to fill up the movie. “Purple Rain” left me feeling very underwhelmed.\n\n* ½ out of * * * *\n\n4K Info: “Purple Rain” is released on a single-disc 4K from Warner Brothers Home Entertainment in honor of its 40th anniversary. The film has a running time of 111 minutes and is rated R for sexuality, some nudity, language, and some violent content. It comes with a digital copy of the film as well.\n\nVideo Info: For a 40-year-old film, I thought “Purple Rain” looked good but not great on 4K. It would have definitely been enhanced by a Dolby Vision transfer. I was hoping they would have gone that way with this release. As it is, it’s still a solid 4K transfer. I haven’t seen the film on Blu-ray, but I didn’t notice anything wrong with this transfer. I also didn’t notice anything that really stood out either.\n\nAudio Info: For a movie that relies heavily on music, it is of the utmost importance to have good sound on this 4K release. I’m glad to report they were up to the task with the audio here. It’s crystal clear and all of the music has a punch to it without being too loud or aggressive. Subtitles are included in English and Spanish.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nCommentary by director Albert Magnoli, producer Robert Cavallo and cinematographer Donald E. Thorin\n\nFirst Avenue: The Road to Pop Royalty – featurette\n\nLet’s Go Crazy – music video\n\nTake Me with U – music video\n\nWhen Doves Cry – Music Video\n\nI Would Die 4 U/Baby I’m a Star – music video\n\nPurple Rain – music video\n\nJungle Love – music video\n\nThe Bird – music video\n\nSex Shooter – music video\n\nShould You Buy It?\n\nIf you are a diehard Prince fan and you love his music and this movie, this is a no-brainer here. You will be very happy with “Purple Rain” on 4K. They also imported the special features from the prior Blu-ray release onto this one as well. The music sounds great with this 4K release, and it is a solid visual offering from Warner Brothers as well. If you are watching this for the first-time and are only a casual fan of Prince, I don’t think there is much of a movie here. I tolerated the first 90 minutes, and it was tough to sit through as it plods along with no character development whatsoever. The characters are one-note and thinly-written. “Purple Rain” was really tedious and laborious to sit through, and I expected more from a movie that was so critically acclaimed and well-received. This one is for diehard Prince fans only. If you are one of them, you will love this flick. For everyone else, you can pass on checking this out, as there’s nothing groundbreaking or out of this world here.\n\n**Disclaimer** I received a copy of this film from Warner Brothers to review for free. The opinions and statements in the review are mine and mine alone.\n\nThe following review was written by Ultimate Rabbit correspondent, Tony Farinella.\n\nThis was my first time having the pleasure of sitting down to watch “The Color Purple,” directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg. This is a director who has never been afraid to tackle any type of film project. When watching this film, his trademark heart is clearly on display. What makes it stand out and be as memorable as it is, though, is the terrific acting, especially from Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey. “The Color Purple” is based on the novel by Alice Walker, which I have not read, so my film review will be solely based on the film itself. I have no frame of reference to compare it to, and I think that is more than OK. Too often, people get caught up in comparing films to books, and in the end, they are two totally different mediums. You will never be able to cover everything from the book because you are limited by the running time of the film.\n\nThe film takes place from 1909 to 1943 in Georgia where we are introduced to Celie Harris (Whoopi Goldberg), a young teenager who already has two children, a boy and a girl, because she was raped by her father. Her father took the children from her and has essentially sold them off for profit. Celie wonders where her children are and worries about them constantly, as any mother would when they are abruptly taken. She was also married off, thanks to her father, to Albert Johnson (Danny Glover), an abusive man who makes her do anything and everything for him. He beats her, forces her to have sex with him, and controls every aspect of her life. In his eyes, this woman serves one purpose and one purpose only, which is to take care of him. She even has to call him “Mister.”\n\nDuring this time, she was separated from her sister, Nettie, played by Akosua Busia. When Albert came looking for a wife, he was initially interested in Nettie, but their father would not part with her and insisted on Celie going with Albert. Celie is often told she is too skinny and ugly. She sees inspiration in the strong-willed Sofia, played by Oprah Winfrey. Sofia is not one to take guff from anyone in her life, but you wonder how long this will last before she is beaten down by the rampant racism she experiences. We get to know another woman named Shug Avery, played by Margaret Avery, a flamboyant performer who has Albert Johnson’s full attention. Even though Shug comes with some baggage, she seems to know how to hold her own and capture the attention of men while remaining independent and tough. Celie is hoping to receive some letters from her sister Nettie, but she starts to wonder why they never show up and if her sister is even alive after they were separated.\n\n“The Color Purple” covers a great deal of time and because of the amount of time it covers, four decades, it makes sense that the film is 153 minutes. This was one of those films where I rarely noticed the running time because it was a prime example of good old-fashioned Hollywood craftsmanship. When film critics and fans say things like, “They don’t make ‘em like they used to,” in my eyes, they are talking about films like this one, which was released in 1985. It’s a drama made by adults for adults. This is a serious subject matter, but it’s handled with Spielberg’s trademark warmth, tenderness and care. Because we spend so much time with Celie on her journey, we can’t help but root for her to overcome her circumstances. We get to know her and the women close to her as they have made an impact on her life.\n\nThe film is incredibly patient in allowing things to slowly build up to its climax without ever feeling like it’s taking too long to get there. Goldberg is tremendous here. She expresses a plethora of emotions on her face without ever overacting or doing too much. You can look in her eyes and see the pain and heartache of her character. It’s a terrific performance, and I think people forget what a great actress she is when given the chance to show off her range of emotions. Of course, she won an Oscar for “Ghost” in 1991. However, this is clearly the film she should have won an Oscar for, with all due respect to Geraldine Page.\n\n“The Color Purple” does sometimes go off the beaten path with its narrative plot and, at times, it can spend too much time with one character in a specific time and place instead of sticking with Goldberg and her character’s story. I was very, very close to giving this film four stars, especially because of the emotional weight which was incredibly powerful. It earns the tears of the audience here by allowing things to build up and develop. Winfrey is also really, really good here and earned an Oscar nomination for her performance in this film along with Avery.\n\nOne of the biggest criticisms of this film is that it was directed by a white director in Steven Spielberg. This is a film populated with a cast which is 95% Black. I can see why audiences would take issue with that, but Spielberg is wise to stay out of the way of the material and the actors. Even though some of his familiar touches are here, as mentioned earlier, it doesn’t feel like a typical Spielberg film. He is sensitive to the story, and he does a terrific job of allowing the performances of his cast and the story itself to take center stage. He’s more in the background here and, for once, it isn’t a bad thing.\n\n* * * ½ out of * * * *\n\n4K Info: “The Color Purple” is released on a single 4K disc from Warner Brothers Home Entertainment. It also comes with a digital copy of the film. The film is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 153 minutes.\n\n4K Video/Audio Info: This is another top-notch transfer from the folks over at Warner Brothers Home Entertainment. The HDR here really shines in some of the outdoor scenes which are lively and colorful. It has a cinematic feel to it while also cleaning up the picture as well. The audio track is also really solid, as this is a dialogue heavy film, and it’s easy to understand everything that is being said with a clean and crisp audio track here. Subtitles are included in English, Spanish and French.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nConversations with the Ancestors: The Color Purple from Book to Screen\n\nA Collaboration of Spirits: Casting and Acting The Color Purple\n\nCultivating a Classic: The Making of The Color Purple\n\nThe Color Purple: The Musical\n\nTeaser #1\n\nTeaser #2\n\nTrailer\n\nShould You Buy It?\n\nIf you read my 4K reviews (and thank you if you do), you know what a big proponent I am of film history and preservation. In the year 2023, Warner Brothers has done their job in going through their extensive catalogue of films and bringing them to 4K and making them look bigger and better than ever. There are a ton of important films in the Warner Brothers library that have received their day in court this year. In order for them to continue doing their job, we need to support their restorations of classic cinema, especially when they are done in such a magnificent manner, leaving no stone unturned. “The Color Purple” pops off the TV here and looks better than it ever has, thanks to this 4K transfer. It sounds great as well. The film itself is an important piece of cinematic history that shows off great acting and tells a vital story with a great cast of actors and one of the best directors of all-time. At its current price point, which is around $23, this is a day one purchase on its December 5th release date.\n\n**Disclaimer** I received a copy of this film from Warner Brothers to review for free. The opinions and statements in the review are mine and mine alone.\n\nWRITER’S NOTE: This article was written in 2010, back when this anniversary screening took place.\n\nAlan Rudolph’s 1985 neo-noir movie “Trouble in Mind” reached its 25th anniversary in 2010. This is especially significant because it got lost by its distributors about twenty years ago, and they only recently found a print of it. The movie has since been restored and been released in a new special edition DVD. To celebrate its anniversary, the producer of “Trouble in Mind,” Dave Walker, showed a new print of it at New Beverly Cinema. Along with him were actors Keith Carradine who played Coop and Lori Singer who played Georgia, and they were also joined by the composer of the film’s score, Mark Isham.\n\nIn talking about working with Rudolph, both Singer and Carradine said they never really rehearsed any scenes. A lot of it came down to them meeting with Rudolph, talking about the screenplay, and getting on the same page with what he wanted to accomplish. Singer explained how he created a “very vivid atmosphere” which came about from an “organic, real feeling.” In summarizing Rudolph’s filmmaking process, Singer said, “Whatever he was shooting, he was capturing his vision. That was our rehearsal.”\n\nIsham described Rudolph as a “jazz director” in that he wanted to get everything right in the first take. When asked how he got the job on “Trouble in Mind,” Isham explained he was being represented by CAA and his agent encouraged him to make a list of directors he wanted to work with. After seeing one of Rudolph’s other movies, “Choose Me,” Isham decided he wanted to work with him. Rudolph ended up listening to one of Mark’s albums, liked it and hired him.\n\nOne question asked of Isham was in regards to working with singer Marianne Faithful on two of the film’s songs. Isham said he knew nothing about Faithful beforehand, but that he quickly learned she was an artist of instinct, and they captured a lot of magic on tape whenever she sang. Basically, he did an acoustic piano version of each song she would sing, and he gave her the music through headphones. Isham went on to say he added synthesizers to the soundtrack afterwards.\n\nIsham is also considered one of the best trumpet players ever, and he did perform on one here. He stated how he has been playing the trumpet since he was eight years old and is always looking to put it in any movie he works on.\n\nAnother audience member asked Carradine about Coop’s hair and why it got all funky throughout. Carradine said he contributed to the look and described it as an “expression of descent into a kind of netherworld from innocent to deeply urban sensibility he was defenseless against.” Coop saw the change of hair as him becoming beautiful, and he was convinced that Singer’s character would like it. Carradine described it as Coop’s way of trying to fit into a world he was utterly clueless about, and that the hair he used was indeed his own, and these days he doesn’t have much of it left.\n\nCarradine and Singer also spoke of working with Divine, the actor made famous in several films directed by John Waters, “Pink Flamingos” in particular. They said they really loved him because he was the sweetest guy and wonderful to work with.\n\nAfter twenty-five years, “Trouble in Mind” still holds up very well, and hopefully its DVD release will open it up to a young audience waiting to discover something new and different. Rudolph has said this films is meant to have the look of a dream, and he gave Singer all the credit for that. The dream is still a strong one even with an elongated passing of time.\n\nWhile at the Days of the Dead convention held in Los Angeles, California in late August of 2023, I got to attend the “Aliens” panel which featured several actors from the classic film. An audience member told the cast how this is one of the most quotable motion pictures of all time and asked if they ever get their famous lines of dialogue yelled back at them on a daily basis. Indeed, there are a plethora of memorable lines throughout which stay with the viewer long after they watch this film. Whether it is Sigourney Weaver saying, “get away from her you bitch” or the late Bill Paxton yelling out “we’re on an express elevator to hell, going down,” there is no forgetting what is said onscreen. This is saying a lot as James Cameron, who wrote and directed this sequel, is not always known for giving his actors great dialogue to work with. Then again, it is far better than the dialogue George Lucas gave us in those “Star Wars” prequels.\n\nThere is no doubt that actors will often find themselves faced with fans yelling lines of dialogue at them as they love what was said, and they always want to see if they can get a reaction out of those particular thespians. I remember interviewing Pierce Brosnan once about his movie “The November Man,” and I walked in to see him pouring himself a cup of coffee and mixing in some milk and sure. To this, I could not help but bring up a famous line he and several other actors have utter throughout history, but with a certain twist:\n\n“Ah, stirred but not shaken!”\n\nThank goodness Brosnan had a great sense of humor about it.\n\nWhen it comes to the cast of “Aliens,” their memories of their most well-known dialogue remain very vivid to them, and this provided some of the most entertaining moments during this Q&A session.\n\nDaniel Kash (Private Spunkmeyer): I was in Florida once, and while I was there, someone said, “Nice pet you have there, Bishop.” That was right out of the blue. It was such an average line that no one cares about.\n\nCarrie Henn (Newt): So, there was a line in the movie that, at the time, I asked why I am even saying this. And I know everybody says to me I know you hate the line, but you said it anyway. I learned to love it. The word “mostly,” it is amazing how many times that comes up. People will say it, and my friends will text it to me and they will say, “While I mostly saw this…” And then they always send me a second text saying “mostly.” People, I will be walking by them, and they will say it, and someone will then say “mostly.” If they only knew who was walking next to them. But yeah, it is the weirdest line, but it sticks.\n\nRicco Ross (Private Frost): This was maybe five years after the movie was made, and I had done a music video with Whitney Houston called “Saving All My Love for You.” I was the guy she was saving her love for. I remember walking in the hood one day and, this is a true story, a guy shouts out, “Hey Mr. Whitney Houston, how’s that Arcturian poontang?”\n\nCynthia Scott (Corporal Dietrich): I had a next-door neighbor in London, and he would come home from the pup every night three sheets to the wind. If I happened to be entering the house at the same time he’d go, “Oy, say that line again! Say your line!” And I would go, “Borderline malnutrition, but I don’t think there’s any permanent damage.”\n\nJenette Goldstein (Private Vasquez): People will yell “let’s rock” at me a lot.\n\nWilliam Hope (Lieutenant Gorman): You know, it’s just like, nice to meet you. You always were an asshole. And this happened in a swimming pool!\n\nFor myself, I would love to know if Sigourney Weaver ever gets anyone quoting one of Ellen Ripley’s best lines to her,\n\n“Burke, I don’t know which species is worse. You don’t see them fucking each other over for a goddamn percentage.”\n\nWhatever you may think of Cameron’s talent for dialogue, this remains one of the best things he has ever written.\n\nOn August 26, 2023, I found the time to attend the Days of The Dead convention which was held at the Hilton Hotel outside of LAX airport. The main highlight of the day for me was sitting in on the panel for “Aliens,” James Cameron’s classic film from the year 1986 which remains as exciting now as it was when first released. This brought many of the talent who worked in front of and behind the camera, and they were very enthusiastic to be here to discuss a motion picture you would think they have been asked every conceivable question about before this point.\n\nOne of the questions asked of everyone was about the biggest challenge everyone faced on set. The first to answer was Tom Woodruff Jr. He is best known as a special effects supervisor who studied under the tutelage of Stan Winston, and he later, along with Alec Gillis, founded Amalgamated Dynamics, an American special effects company specializing in animatronics and prosthetic make-up. “Aliens” was one of Tom’s earliest projects, and he was very direct with the audience about what he dealt with in this science fiction classic.\n\nTom Woodruff Jr.: For me, the biggest challenge was being on set with James Cameron (audience laughs). He was very specific. He’s a rare guy. He knows exactly what he wants, and he knows exactly what parts you don’t understand. The first time we had the aliens on set, it was a scene where there were a lot of fire throwers going on, and the alien was supposed to be hidden up in the wall and crawls out and reveals itself. We did a run through, and Cameron stopped the whole thing and he said, “Why is this alien brown and the rest of him is black?!” The answer I knew in my head was, I didn’t check it out. I remember he just grabbed a can of black spray paint, shook it up and sprayed it on the head. I also realized at that point we wasted a lot of time painting alien heads when we could have just grabbed a can of spray paint.\n\nFor Carrie Henn who plays the orphaned Newt, she had no prior acting experience when she was cast in “Aliens.” Her career as an actress did not last long as she later decided to become a schoolteacher after earning a degree in liberal studies and child development from California State University, Stanislaus. Her response to question given proved to be quite surprising.\n\nCarrie Henn: One of the challenging things was actually being scared of it (the aliens) because, I mean, look at it. Everyone was in the suits at some point, but then they would turn around or I would see them outside of the suit completely or their head would be off. So, I would try to act like I was scared of it, when in reality I knew it was my friend. I was scared of dogs and still am because I have been bitten by many, so I used to just pretend that it was a dog chasing after me.\n\nRicco Ross portrays Private Ross in “Aliens,” and his most memorable lines of dialogue include “guess she doesn’t like the cornbread either” and “what are we supposed to use, harsh language?” He ended up turning down the opportunity to act in Stanley Kubrick’s “Full Metal Jacket” in order to appear in this film. Since “Aliens,” he has remained a busy actor in both movies and television and does not look to be lacking in work. This would still be the case were it not for the SAG/AFTRA and WGA strike which still rages on as I write this article.\n\nRicco Ross: The marines would have lunch and hang out in one area and the aliens would hang out in another area, and we didn’t kick it together. But I remember walking by one day and one of the aliens had his head under his arm and smoking a cigarette, and this was before iPhones, and I wish I had a camera because it was an amazing kind of classic photograph.\n\nCynthia Scott, also known as Cynthia Dale Scott, portrayed Corporal Dietrich in “Aliens,” and her other credits include “Rush” which stars Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh. She has long since left acting behind her and now dedicates her life to working in the visual arts. Her answer to this question reminded me of perhaps her most famous line in this film which is, “Maybe they don’t show up on infrared at all.”\n\nCynthia Scott: I think I am the only one that was grabbed by the alien, and it was extremely challenging because I did half of my own stunt. If you recall, I was taken straight up in the air, and we were so old school that the stunt was achieved with a gigantic sea saw. It was operated by a bunch of crew members. So, I was standing on the downside, and I say my line and the stuntman in the alien suit landed behind me, grabbed me, and simultaneously the crew members pulled down really fast on the other end and we go shooting up in the air so our whole center of gravity changes. And simultaneously I am lowering my live flamethrower and using it ostensibly on my friend Ricco (audience laughs). The first three or four takes, I fell off. I was so terrified of James Cameron that I thought I would be fired today. I’m telling you; it was really hard.\n\nWilliam Hope portrays Gorman, the inexperienced commanding officer of the Marines who would have been best to listen Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) if he had been quick to think about it. Like Ricco Ross, he turned down a role in “Full Metal Jacket” to appear in “Aliens.” Since then, he has given memorable performances in such movies as “Hellbound: Hellraiser II,” “Shining Through,” the cinematic version of the television show “The Saint,” “Captain America: The First Avenger,” “Dark Shadows,” and the recent reboot of a sequel to “Texas Chainsaw Massacre.” His words about James Cameron rang very true.\n\nWilliam Hope: Jim in those days was cutting his teeth in more ways than one because he knew everybody’s job better than they did apart from the actors. So, I was just obsessed with don’t screw this up. We knew the script was just something of a masterpiece. We knew it was very, very special. As for you guys (the alien actors), the only direct contact that I had was when the aliens come through the roof. It was just the most exciting scene to play. The big challenge was getting it right and Jim saying, “Good, okay, move on.”\n\nMark Rolston portrayed Drake, a close friend to fellow badass marine Vasquez who was played by Jenette Goldstein. His other credits include playing Hans in “Lethal Weapon 2,” Stef in “Robocop 2,” and Bogs Diamond in “The Shawshank Redemption.” He also acted in “The Departed” which earned its director, Martin Scorsese, his first ever Academy Award, and co-starred in “Saw V” and Saw VI” as Dan Erickson. On television, he portrayed Gordie Liman on “The Shield.”\n\nMark Rolston: The thing I remember was the creature creation. I actually came back to set to watch the entrance of the queen alien. It is seared in my memory because she was like a two-story puppet which was controlled by guys on the crew. The smallest guy on Tom (Woodruff Jr.’s) crew was the guy who gets stationed in the head, and his sole job, aside from being dressed in black and trying to hide, was to push the queen alien goo out the tail. Cameron at one moment said, “There’s too much goo! Too much goo! You are pushing on the wrong tube!” I was giggling my ass over that one, but it was such an impressive shot. You look at the film and you believe this is a living monster, but onstage you see it’s just a puppet. Such masterful filmmaking.\n\nWe are getting closer to the 40th anniversary of “Aliens,” and this sequel still holds up all these years later. Some of us got to see when it debuted in theaters back in 1986, and others like myself watched on VHS. But even on the small screen, this still proved to be one of the greatest cinematic roller coaster rides we ever went on, and it is so great to see new generations of movie buffs feel the same from one new year to the next.\n\nThe following review was written by Ultimate Rabbit correspondent, Tony Farinella.\n\nWhen it comes to comedy in films, I’m well aware of the fact it is subjective. In fact, film criticism as a whole is subjective, but I feel as though with comedy, it is especially subjective. What I find funny in film, you might find painfully stupid and vice versa. When it comes to the National Lampoon films with Chevy Chase at the helm, I find them annoying and tedious. They fall completely flat for me. I initially watched “National Lampoon’s Christmas Vacation” and was completely unimpressed. Now, it was my first time watching the initial film, “National Lampoon’s Vacation,” and I’ll just say I have no desire, whatsoever, to watch “European Vacation” or “Vegas Vacation.”\n\nUpon researching this film, I discovered readers of Total Film Magazine ranked it as the 46th greatest comedy of all-time. I’m truly baffled by this. It starts with its lead actor in Chevy Chase. I don’t find his style of comedy particularly interesting, funny, or unique. He is overplaying it in these films with his facial reactions and mannerisms, and I found his character of Clark Griswold to be rather exhausting and laborious to spend time with, even if it’s only for a little over an hour and a half. It comes down to laughter, and I might have smirked once or twice during this film.\n\nIn “Vacation,” the Griswolds are looking to take a trip from Illinois to California by car, to visit Walley World, a world-famous amusement park, as Clark is looking to spend more quality time with his family. He feels as though if they were to travel by plane, they would just listen to music and tune each other out. Even though it’s a lengthy trip, he looks forward to getting to bond with his wife Ellen (Beverly D’Angelo) and their two children, Rusty (Anthony Michael Hall) and Audrey (Dana Barron). Audrey is a teenage girl who likes to live on the wild side while Rusty is looking to take the next step into being a man.\n\nAlong the way, they run into every possible problem you can imagine with their mode of transportation, traffic issues, misfortunes, folderol, and even death. They also stop by and visit everyone’s favorite Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid), who is always looking for a handout or a quick buck by telling his latest sob story. Either you like these characters or you don’t. Personally, my favorite character is Ellen, played by Beverly D’Angelo, as she plays the straight woman perfectly during all of this mayhem and mischief.\n\nThe expression, “Whatever can go wrong will go wrong” definitely applies to the Griswolds. After a while, as an audience member, you see it coming from a mile away. It doesn’t work because you know trouble is right around the corner. If everything were going well, there wouldn’t be a movie to be made here. If you want a road trip movie which can produce great laughs, look no further than “Midnight Run.” However, if you don’t have quirky and likable characters, the film is going to fail. As a film critic, I’m driven by characters more than plot. A film needs a plot of course, but I can overlook the lack of one if the characters are keeping me glued to the screen.\n\nNow that I’ve seen two of these films, I can safely state this brand of slapstick, gimmick comedy is not my cup of tea. I know these films are hugely popular, especially “Christmas Vacation,” but I found them extremely painful to sit through as a viewer. It’s even more surprising this film didn’t connect with me because it was written by John Hughes and directed by Harold Ramis, two of my favorites.\n\n* out of * * * *\n\n4K Info: “National Lampoon’s Vacation” is being released on a single-disc 4K from Warner Brothers Home Entertainment. It is rated R and has a running time of 98 minutes. It also comes with a digital code for the film.\n\nVideo Info: The 4K transfer on this forty-year-old film is terrific. It is crisp, clean, and quite colorful. They really upgraded this one in a masterful way. It looks beautiful and has no issues whatsoever.\n\nAudio Info: The Dolby Atmos track is a very nice touch here, and the film sounds terrific from start to finish. It is a dialogue heavy film, and you can hear all of the dialogue without skipping a beat.\n\nSpecial Features:\n\nCommentary with Chevy Chase, Randy Quaid, Matty Simmons, Harold Ramis, Anthony Michael Hall, and Dana Barron\n\nShould You Buy It?\n\nIf you are a fan of the franchise and this film, it is a must-own because Warner Brothers has done a phenomenal job with making this film really pop on 4K. Even though it was my first time watching it, I can’t imagine it gets much better than this from an audio and visual perspective. The commentary track comes from the previously released Blu-ray, but at least there is something to listen to if you want to hear some interesting tidbits about the making of the film. As stated early on, you either like Clark and the Griswolds or you find them insufferable like myself. I’ve seen “Christmas Vacation” and “Vacation,” and it is more than enough for me. It comes down to your personal preference. As the old saying goes, “For those that like that sort of thing, that is the sort of thing they like.” However, if you do love it, you would be making a grave mistake not to own the 4K of this film. They really hit a home run here from a technical aspect.\n\n**Disclaimer** I received a copy of this film from Warner Brothers to review for free. The opinions and statements in the review are mine and mine alone.\n\nOkay, I have been looking for this particular movie trailer, a teaser trailer actually, for the longest time. While you can find just about anything on the internet, this trailer for the 1986 dark fantasy martial arts action comedy “The Golden Child” seemed to be hidden in deepest regions of Paramount Pictures’ vaults. Denis-Carl Robidoux, however, found a 35mm copy of it and has since posted it on his You Tube page. For that, I could not be more grateful.\n\nTalking about this particular trailer is a bit tricky as you probably know everything there is to know about this film which was directed by Michael Ritchie, the same man who directed Chevy Chase to his best performance ever in “Fletch.” With a certain actor from “Beverly Hills Cop” appearing in it, expectations were understandably high.\n\nI saw this teaser trailer when my brother, friends of his and I went to a movie theater in Thousand Oaks, California to check out “Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home” on the silver screen. When this trailer began, it was hard not to be swept up the snowy visuals and the narration which promised us an epic journey for one character who is destined to save the most perfect child to be found on this planet. These visuals were supported greatly by music which sounded like it was ripped off of Maurice Jarre’s score to “Lawrence of Arabia.” But as we followed this character who was described as being “the chosen one,” I came to feel as frigid as he did. Next thing we knew, the chosen one was revealed to be Eddie Murphy who wondered why he was.out in the freezing cold while we were sitting in a nice air-conditioned movie theater. Under the circumstances, I cannot blame him for thinking so, and I loved the reaction from the audience as they laughed loudly at him saying he was going back to Hollywood to kick some butt,\n\nMovie trailers like these are in short supply these days as studios have a hard time surprising us as we are always eagerly anticipating the latest big releases which feature movie stars we know are going to appear in them. This trailer for “The Golden Child,” however, surprised and had me in hysterics as it made me realize all the cinematic heroes are not as stoic as we think they are. And, more importantly, they are not prepared to be the hero we expect them to be. Or perhaps they would be if they were inhabiting a country with a far warmer climate.\n\nPlease feel free to check out the teaser trailer for “The Golden Child” down below. Eddie Murphy may not consider to be one of his best films, and the special effects in it have not aged all that well, but it is better than its reputation may suggest."
