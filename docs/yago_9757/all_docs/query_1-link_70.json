        "text": "“Teeth. Two little rows of stones in the flesh as sensitive in their own way like fingertips or lips. Impossible, like marriage but there they are.”\n\n“(Denis) Leary’s cynical personality shines through.”\n\nAnd there is “The Secret Lives of Dentists,” Alan Rudolph’s newest film. And there is a “Secret” embedded in this film, as foreshadowed in the word lingering as the rest of the title words fade off of the screen.\n\nThis film fits my definition of an independent film to the max, meaning it took a rather simple foundation for a film and makes the viewer think about it in an entirely different way, while at the same time leaving the viewer without the slightest idea of how the film had the power to do that.\n\n“The Secret Lives of Dentists” stars Campbell Scott, Hope Davis and Denis Leary and is based on the novella, “The Age of Grief,” by Jane Smiley. These facts sound like many other films these days, except maybe for the up and coming, lesser known cast. But aside from being based on a novella, this movie for the most part strays from the mainstream.\n\nScott plays David Hurst, a dentist and father of three daughters. Davis plays his wife Dana, also a dentist. The two met in college, went to dental school together and eventually started their own practice. Sounds perfect, right? Almost too perfect.\n\nWhile watching this film, I got the sense in the beginning that I was getting a glimpse of what my future may be like. Personally, I don’t feel I am on the same track as the characters in this movie, as I have no desire to be anywhere near people’s teeth first thing in the morning, but there was still the feeling I was looking into the future because there is a great sense that what these characters go through is what life is in the real world, even if your individual circumstances are different.\n\nBefore the events take place that really made me get this idea, Denis Leary, who plays Slater, one of Hurst’s patients, makes his somewhat unpleasant entry into the movie. He is Hurst’s patient in one of the first scenes, there to have a cavity filled. I am one person who does not in the least bit enjoy going to the dentist, and Slater wasn’t too thrilled about it, either. If there is one character who I related most to in this film, it was him. From his first appearance to his last, he is the one who really puts some of the meanings in the film into perspective.\n\nSlater, a trumpet player, warned Hurst about being careful and not to do anything that would affect his playing while fixing his tooth. His sarcastic, blunt personality represented what I can surely say some of us dentist-goers would like to have when sitting in that chair.\n\nI knew that would not be his last appearance in the movie. But what did the dentist ever do to him? Especially David Hurst?\n\nI think Hurst is victim to too much normalcy in his white picket fence lifestyle that he almost wanted something to go wrong so he could break away.\n\nEarly in the movie, this little light that Hurst has been looking for turns on. His wife has an opera performance the whole family is going to, except for the youngest daughter, Leah. Before the show, the kids want Hurst to give Dana her lucky rabbit’s foot. He takes it to her, and this is where something disturbing happens, but by the end of the movie it turns out to be a blessing for Hurst.\n\nTo make a long story short, from this point on, Hurst suspects that his wife is cheating on him.\n\nAfter what seems like devastation sets in, Hurst goes into the opera hall to sit with his kids and it is there that Slater reappears with a complaint about his filling. At the same time, Hurst is hit with visual flashbacks from the time he and Dana met to the present. These flashbacks were brought on both by Slater’s appearance and his suspicion of Dana having an affair.\n\nAlthough there are some small signs that Dana may be having an affair, I still think it is a figment of Hurst’s imagination and a way for him to escape the trap he has fallen into as a father and a husband.\n\nDana is occasionally late to or from work and she questions her husband’s feelings for her, maybe as a mask for her own lack of feelings for him, but all in all, her supposed affair never materializes into anything because of a lack of the necessary evidence: a man to have an affair with.\n\nThe only glimpse we get of a potential intruder in their relationship is the encounter Hurst witnesses at the opera hall and even then, all he sees is a man leaning in close to Dana and kissing her cheek. This leaves it more up to the viewer whether she is an adulterer or not.\n\nThis is where Leary’s role as Slater comes back into play. He sort of becomes a little guardian or sidekick for Hurst during his struggle and is there in his house, at work, even in the bedroom to verbalize some of the thoughts that are going through Hurst’s head.\n\nAfter I got used to this role, it began to remind me of Brad Pitt’s character in “Fight Club,” except Pitt was more of an alternate personality for Edward Norton. I am curious what the director’s intentions were in having this possible similarity to the entirely different film “Fight Club.”\n\nThe main detail that brought this comparison to mind is Slater’s wardrobe in the movie. He is decked out in a brown leather jacket, a wild button-up shirt complete with rock star sunglasses, all of which might have actually been leftover from “Fight Club” props.\n\nThere wasn’t really a reason I could think of that Rudolph did this except that he maybe got inspiration from David Finch’s choice to parallel Pitt and Norton and decided to put a twist to it that fit a movie about defining your manhood through your marriage to a woman instead of defining your manhood, or lack thereof, through a marriage to a group of men.\n\nThis brings in the other, more important aspect that defines the strength and enjoyment of this film: the acting.\n\nLeary’s cynical personality shines through, but is a little more subdued than what I have seen in his comedic specials where he attacks everything with a cigarette in one hand and a beer in the other.\n\nScott is more of a victim of his own demise in this movie than he was in his last film, “Rodger Dodger,” where he played a character who was exactly opposite to the one he plays in this movie.\n\nAnd Davis is definitely on her way up in the acting world after “About Schmidt.” She has branched out from the talent she showed in that movie. In “Schmidt,” Davis’ character is entirely different and has to be more of the strong person in the family in times of crisis, whereas in this film she is weaker.\n\nThis is clear because she is unhappy in her marriage. Whether or not she is doing anything about it doesn’t matter; it still doesn’t make her any happier in her current situation.\n\nAll in all, people may not like some parts or characters of this movie, but it is entirely original. From beginning to end, all the elements of the film and the challenges the characters face come together to create a film that really makes you think there is hope in finding the secret to life, even if it is different for every person."
