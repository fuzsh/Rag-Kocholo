In the former film, Carradine plays a man who is hospitalized as a pathological liar, even though he is telling the truth about his uncommon life, which included stints as a spy, a fighter pilot, and a professor of poetry. The man soon becomes involved in a love triangle with two roommates, one of whom (Bujold) is a call-in radio advice show host and one of whom runs the bar that the man's fiancée used to run, and neither of whom is aware that the other is seeing this man. In the latter film, Carradine's character is also seen as mad and he starts dressing more and more bizarrely as he is sucked further and further into the punk underside of his city. Trouble in Mind is \"brilliantly bonkers,\" Peter Travers wrote in People. Rudolph's \"creation is . . . hot-blooded, haunting and howlingly comic.\"\n\nRudolph is also the author of the screenplay for Trixie, a spoof of noir detective films that features Trixie Zurbo, an airheaded private security guard who speaks only in malapropisms and who dreams of being a real detective. \"More than any character he's created, Trixie mirrors Rudolph's outsiderness, his quirky defiance of traditional modes of conduct,\" Dave McCoy commented in the Seattle Times. \"Both possess skewed points of view and idiosyncratic approaches to their respective professions.\"\n\nRudolph's most widely praised film may be Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle, a biography of American writer Dorothy Parker and her group of literary friends, who were accustomed to lunch together at the Algonquin Hotel in Manhattan. Parker—an accomplished poet and a notorious wit—left plenty of material for a scriptwriter to work with in her published writings, and in her friendships and love life. The script's \"intelligent transposition of famous Parker one-liners, as well as passages and situations from Parker's fiction, is always amazingly clever,\" Cynthia Lucia wrote in Cineaste, while Brian D. Johnson, writing in Maclean's, appreciated the way Rudolph \"conjures up the literary thickets of the Algonquin Round Table with exquisite detail.\"\n\nBIOGRAPHICAL AND CRITICAL SOURCES:\n\nBOOKS\n\nInternational Dictionary of Films and Filmmakers, Volume 2: Directors, St. James Press (Detroit, MI), 1996.\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nArtforum International, January, 1993, Rosetta Brooks, interview with Rudolph, pp. 56-62.\n\nBoston Herald, January 16, 1998, James Verniere, review of Afterglow, p. 6; October 15, 1999, Paul Sherman, review of Breakfast of Champions, p. 17; July 7, 2000, Stephen Schaefer, review of Trixie, p. 19; July 9, 2000, Stephen Schaefer, interview with Rudolph, p. 51.\n\nChristian Century, September 21, 1994, James M.
