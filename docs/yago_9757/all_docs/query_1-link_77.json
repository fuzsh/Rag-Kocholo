        "text": "From 1975-1979, Aldrich was one of the most significant presidents of the Directors Guild of America. As former DGA board member and noted director Walter Hill (48 Hours, Geronimo, The Warriors) states,\n\n“In addition to his artistic achievements, which were considerable in many genres, Robert Aldrich achieved the greatest contractual breakthroughs for our members. In closed door sessions lasting several weeks, he locked horns with Lew Wasserman, the movie industry’s toughest negotiator. Making him into a weak, vacillating person doing whatever the studio wanted is a travesty…and shameful.”\n\nActor Michael Murphy (Tanner, Manhattan, An Unmarried Woman) worked with Aldrich on Lylah Clare, and was similarly enraged:\n\n“I gave up on FEUD after watching a few minutes of what they did to Bob Aldrich. Unbelievably insulting and bore not a single resemblance to the real man.”\n\nFor Oscar-winner Keith Carradine (Nashville, The Moderns, Emperor of the North),\n\n“My experience with Aldrich was fantastic. He was one of the most knowledgeable and sure-handed directors I’ve ever had the privilege to work with. His ability to navigate the depths of two actors as respected and esteemed as Lee Marvin and Ernest Borgnine was truly impressive. And he did it without ever being anything but a gent and a mensch. Their respect for him was equal to his for them.”\n\nAldrich and Oscar Rudolph, his assistant director and consultant, were the closest of associates and friends for five decades. His son, director Alan Rudolph (Choose Me, Remember My Name, Ray Meets Helen) remembers:\n\n“Robert Aldrich was synonymous with ferocious support for the underdog and what’s fair, challenging myopic authority and forging creative independence. I recall going to private screenings as a boy, so blistering in their head-on contempt for societal intolerance and political ignorance, my head hasn’t stopped spinning. He was David to Hollywood’s Goliath. He created his own studio to battle their control. Portraying him in this program was not only odious and slanderous, but exactly opposite of everything he was and stood for. Such an affront to the accuracy of the man and film history is the equivalent of chief counsel Joseph Welch offering up innocent names to Joseph McCarthy’s witch hunt instead of his chastisement of the Senator’s lack of decency and defeating him forever.”\n\nThe First Amendment allowing free speech grants wide latitude in adapting the actions of pubic figures. But that freedom does not include taking limitless liberties in depicting these people. The essence of a real person should not be violated in the grandiose guise of docu-drama. Wrapping this violation in the dressing of the First Amendment does not provide justification. Integrity and truthfulness must be equal factors. Winston Churchill’s great grandson was repeatedly contacted during the making of The Darkest Hour and he is on the record of how proud he is of the movie’s outcome.\n\nMillions of viewers in future generations will watch FEUD. Unaware of the reputation or accomplishments of Olivia de Havilland and Robert Aldrich, they will accept what they see at face value. The irony is that FX and Ryan Murphy could have accomplished what they felt was dramatically important by making simple adjustments.\n\nDeHavilland’s gossipy, catty dialogue could have been given to Kathy Bates, who adeptly portrayed Joan Blondell, an actress whose sharp one-liners was consistent with her personality on and off screen.\n\nAnd the actions of the character called ‘Robert Aldrich’ could have been acceptable by changing his name to that of a fictional director (reference: David Dennison, Alan Smithee, Lewis Castle) in the fiction FEUD created.\n\nStandards must be set – and adhered to.\n\n* * *"
