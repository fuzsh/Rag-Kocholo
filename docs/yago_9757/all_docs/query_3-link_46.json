        "text": "\"Camille Claudel\" Is a Force of Nature.\n\nCritic-at-large Laurie Stone reviews the film \"Camille Claudel,\" starring Isabelle Adjani as sculptor Camille Claudel and Gerard Depardieu as Auguste Rodin.\n\nReview\n\nLaurie Stone\n\n'My Golden Days,' An Heir To French New Wave\n\nArnaud Desplechin's new film centers on the memories of a middle-aged Frenchman who returns to Paris after years of living abroad. Critic John Powers says My Golden Days is \"achingly romantic.\"\n\nReview\n\n'Chameleon' Has Cabaret, Spies And A Plot Fit For Lifetime\n\nFrancine Prose's latest novel was inspired by a 1932 photo of two lesbians, one of whom was in the Gestapo. Critic Maureen Corrigan says it's an ingenious excursion into the Parisian demimonde.\n\nReview\n\nAlexandra Auder's mother, Viva, was one of Andy Warhol's muses. Growing up in Warhol's orbit meant Auder's childhood was an unusual one. For several years, Viva, Auder and Auder's younger half-sister, Gaby Hoffmann, lived in the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan. It was was famous for having been home to Leonard Cohen, Dylan Thomas, Virgil Thomson, and Bob Dylan, among others.\n\nIn the series Jury Duty, a solar contractor named Ronald Gladden has agreed to participate in what he believes is a documentary about the experience of being a juror--but what Ronald doesn't know is that the whole thing is fake."
