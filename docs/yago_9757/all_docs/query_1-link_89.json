        "text": "Movies change over the years. Decades ago, I saw “Grey Gardens” as a story of a festering delusion of the American aristocracy and the closed circles of high society decaying into inanition and dependency. I saw its pathologies, including squalor and nostalgia, revealing the true and hidden face of an order that had been a sham from the start. In recent years, what came to the fore was horrific waste, not merely of material resources but of authentic and exhilarating artistic talent—that of Edith Ewing Bouvier Beale, “Big Edie,” who was nearing eighty at the time that the film was shot, and was living with her daughter, “Little Edie,” then near sixty, in a dilapidated mansion called Grey Gardens.\n\nThe Beales, mother and daughter, were fighting the ghosts of dead dreams—and, since those dreams were centered largely on missed opportunities for careers on the stage, they indulged their nostalgia by performing their might-have-beens for the filmmakers, Albert and David Maysles. Sad to say, Big Edie had the flair of a true artist; seeing the movie again reminded me of several other stories, including that of the pianist Germaine Thyssens-Valentin, who spent a quarter-century away from the concert stage while raising a family and returned to make some of the most acclaimed of all piano recordings (mainly of music by Gabriel Fauré); and of Alberta Hunter, the great blues singer who withdrew from musical life, in 1957, to become a nurse and returned twenty-one years later with a celebrated series of performances and records (and the soundtrack to Alan Rudolph’s 1978 film “Remember My Name”)."
