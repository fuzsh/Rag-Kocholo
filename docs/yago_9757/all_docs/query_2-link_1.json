        "text": "I suppose like most persons who access IMDb, sometimes I want simply to get some information on a movie, title or principal. Other times it's to enter comment on a particular film or show, sometimes just to browse, and sometimes to do some combination of these.\n\nHaving just seen this film again, I looked at some of the previous comments first. One was made by \"budmassey\" more than 4-1/2 years ago, and is probably one of the best reviews of a film - professional or amateur, lengthy or brief - I've ever seen.\n\nIf anyone happens upon this one, please look at his. I agree with him totally - and this film truly encompasses ALLUSION, NUANCE and SEXUAL ENERGY (without any prurient aspects for the latter) as well as any piece of entertainment, ever.\n\nKeith Carradine and Lesley Ann Warren are two of the most talented, interesting and engaging actors I've ever seen - and I have enjoyed each one's performance in any film or television production I've seen.\n\nGenevieve Bujold and all of the picture's remaining cast are also outstanding, and in addition to \"budmassey\"'s adjectives, I'd add that this film, throughout, is one of the most ENGROSSING you'll find.\n\n6 out of 7 found this helpful.
