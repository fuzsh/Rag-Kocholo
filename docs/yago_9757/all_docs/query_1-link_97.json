        "text": "Filmmakers’ Bios\n\nAaron Wiederspahn (Writer/ Director/ Producer) — Raised in Wyoming, Aaron grew up knowing only of the wind and its companions. Although at a very early age he developed a strong proclivity for verse and could be sighted upon the open plains reciting poetry to a collective of sheep, his knowledge of the wind was all he would confirm. Upon graduating high school, he left his formative pastures in pursuit of a life on the stage, enduring the endless prod of cattle calls. But, wanting to leave the days of Wyoming behind, he soon thereafter left the stage. While struggling to find his place of purpose, he aimlessly began to sing songs in dilapidated bars, drink dollar beers, and slumber on many a person’s sofa, quietly slinking into despair. It was at this time, sofa surfing in Orlando, Florida, that he had a strange and mysterious dream, a life changing event. A wise looking man of more than a thousand years, riding upon a great white buffalo, summoned him, a video cassette in his hand, saying, “Go! You, Aaron of the sheep people, take this video and watch, study and prepare, show yourself approved, make buoyant your heart and mind, create art for the everyman, beautiful and wondrous, remembering always to exercise vigilance. And, of course, don’t forget to thank me should you ever win any awards.” With that being that, Aaron swiftly ran to the nearest VCR, placed Andrei Rublev inside; and quietly began to watch, to gaze, to see, the lids of his eyes gently waking. Finally, he had found a life worthy of pursuit. So, he packed his bags and moved to New Hampshire. The Sensation of Sight is Aaron’s first feature film.\n\nBuzz McLaughlin (Executive Producer/ Producer) — Co-founder of either/or films, Buzz has spent the last four decades in the arts and entertainment industry.
