        "text": "If not for the presence of Ryan Gosling, the first 10 minutes of director Nicolas Winding Refn's \"Drive\" could be mistaken for something made 25 years ago.\n\nThe neon-and-shadows look recalls “To Live and Die in L.A.” or an early episode of “Miami Vice.” And Cliff Martinez’s synthesizer-saturated score echoes the moody Tangerine Dream melodies that backed up “Risky Business” and James Caan’s “Thief.”\n\nRefn’s true mentors, however, seem to be a couple of other filmmakers from around the same period: directors Paul Schrader and Alan Rudolph. “Drive,” like Schrader’s “American Gigolo,” is about a smart, street-savvy sort who appears to be the master of everything around him, but isn’t as much in control as he thinks.\n\nThere’s more than a hint of Rudolph’s unsung classics “Choose Me” and “Trouble in Mind” in Refn’s fascination with the curious connections people make in an urban jungle (and the way horrifying violence can erupt in seemingly safe places).\n\nFILM REVIEW\n\n'Drive'\n\n3.5 stars (out of 4)\n\nRated: R for strong brutal bloody violence, language and some nudity\n\nCast: Ryan Gosling, Carey Mulligan, Albert Brooks, Bryan Cranston\n\nDirector: Nicolas Winding Refn\n\nRunning time: 100 minutes\n\nAlthough “Drive” incorporates all these various elements and acknowledges their sources — one of the villains admits he was a movie producer in the 1980s — it’s not a throwback or an exercise in style over substance. It’s a psychological drama that occasionally flirts with the idea of being an action flick, although neither Refn nor his nameless hero are content to play by the rules.\n\nTherein lies the film’s seductive power: There’s no telling where this story is going. Hossein Amini’s screenplay (adapted from James Sallis’ novel of the same name) eventually runs into a dead end, but before it does, the movie casts a chilly spell.\n\nGosling’s character, identified only as Driver or “The Kid,” casually cruises between multiple lives, sometimes toiling as a mechanic, occasionally performing stunt driving for films and, every now and then, serving as the wheelman for robbers on the run. He has a rabbit-foot keychain and wears a quilted jacket the color of moonlight, with a large yellow scorpion emblem on the back. He strikes pensive poses like James Dean and handles cars like Steve McQueen.\n\nIf he’s troubled by his trips into the criminal world, he doesn’t let it show. He is not exactly the chatty type; he prefers to stare silently (and intently) at those who talk to him, as if he was daring them to try to read his mind.\n\nThe only people to break through Driver’s barriers are his neighbor, Irene (Carey Mulligan), and her young son, Benicio (Kaden Leos). Irene waits tables at Denny’s while not so eagerly waiting for her husband, Standard (Oscar Isaacs), to return home from prison. When he does, “Drive” takes one of its most unpredictable turns, sending Driver into the path of sleazeball money man Bernie Rose (Albert Brooks, playing fiercely and impressively against type), who has a habit of putting tableware to unappetizing uses.\n\nThe ugliness of Driver’s dilemma is contrasted by the elegance of Newton Thomas Sigel’s cinematography, which embraces and enhances every detail, from the tears shimmering in Irene’s eyes to the gaudy glow of a dressing room for exotic dancers, where the stone-faced strippers placidly watch as a man nearly gets a bullet hammered into his skull.\n\nThe showgirls aren’t the only cold cookies in “Drive.” Aside from Irene and Benicio, almost everyone is either emotionally aloof or actively looking for opportunities to do it to the other guy before he does it to them.\n\nGosling refrains from revealing all the inner workings of Driver, which turns out to be a wise choice. Mulligan brings Irene’s conflicts and concerns much closer to the surface and, although she frequently withholds words, her exquisitely controlled performance spells out everything she’s feeling. The only explicitly romantic moment they share — a stunning kiss, photographed in slow-motion — takes places seconds before the movie’s most brutal death, another instance in which the film changes gears when we least expect it. You may not be pleased by the finale of “Drive,” but the journey to get there is certainly full of surprises."
