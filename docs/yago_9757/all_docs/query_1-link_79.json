        "text": "Maybe there's a more ruefully beautiful screen actress than Julie Christie. But that's hard to imagine while watching her radiant performance in ''Afterglow,'' Alan Rudolph's sinuous romance about a great-looking, long-married couple with a lively extracurricular agenda. Ms. Christie, who won a best actress award from the New York Film Critics Circle for her soulful and alluring work here, is as haunting as ever in the role of a middle-aged woman who chooses to live emotionally apart from her philandering husband. Even in circumstances vastly more conventional than those of her ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' days, Ms. Christie still conveys the same wounding wisdom, the same readiness to drift into a dream.\n\nLucky Mann, as played with equal gusto by Nick Nolte, is a rakish handyman with a long list of grateful female clients. And while ''Afterglow'' gets as much pun mileage as possible out of Lucky's moniker (''He must be lucky.'' ''Oh! I find him very different from Lucky.''), it also finds something genuinely smoldering in Lucky's escapades.\n\nEven after the film's last half-hour descends into a silly season, Mr. Rudolph writes and directs with obvious affection for his characters and with a deep knowledge of whatever makes them tick. ''Afterglow'' does seem sincere in trying to understand what happens to marriage after the initial passion burns down into something less fiery but perhaps more sustaining.\n\nCertainly a great fondness keeps Lucky together with Phyllis (Ms. Christie), a former actress who spends a lot of time watching her old films on television. Even though Phyllis accepts and even encourages Lucky's affairs, these two remain intimate friends. Lucky understands the kind of moodiness that sends Phyllis anxiously to her doctor and finds her almost disappointed to learn that nothing is wrong with her. This middle-aged beauty is so fully in the grip of psychic malaise that she expects it to take physical form.\n\nSo Lucky wanders. And ''Afterglow'' coyly watches him get involved with Marianne Byron (Lara Flynn Boyle), the pretty and bubble-headed wife of a cold-blooded yuppie executive (played by Jonny Lee Miller, barely recognizable here as part of the ''Trainspotting'' crew). Lucky's Mr. Fix-it talents are just right for Marianne, who spends most of her time alone in preposterous, ultramodern splendor. The film is set in Montreal, but that isn't enough to explain Marianne's fondness for speaking French to the staff in her apartment building.\n\nAfter the film establishes that Jeffrey, the yuppie, refuses to sleep with Marianne and that she has nonetheless hired Lucky to turn a spare bedroom into a nursery, the two couples begin to intertwine. Lucky and Phyllis, who turn out to have a missing child, both become involved with the Byrons, who hardly seem much older than their daughter. Meanwhile, Mr. Rudolph's writing turns increasingly misty, having moved from handyman double-entendres (''You take plumbing and a woman's nature: they're both unpredictable and filled with hidden mysteries'') to more vague philosophizing. ''Sometimes you lose things,'' Lucky tells Phyllis, whom he still loves so deeply. ''Sometimes you find them. Just let it be what it is.''\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
