        "text": "Alien: Romulus\n\nIf you are a sci fi horror fan, you have probably watched several Alien films. The first is the best. The second, still with Sigourney Weaver, is second best. After those two, Alien sequels have been disappointments. The good news is I noticed Ridley Scott’s name somewhere in the trailers for this one. And our XD theater is ready to pump out superior presentation which increases the pleasure of watching big budget action flicks.\n\nIt Ends With Us\n\nBased on a best selling book whose fans have been turning out for all the early screenings, this film about domestic abuse seems to be a winner. Blake Lively is the woman in trouble. I wish it the greatest success..\n\nBorderlands\n\nAnother uninteresting video game turned movie taking up space on premium screens.. Sitting through the trailer was bad enough. Now I have to try and watch the movie. I will not be playing the video game\n\nCuckoo\n\nA horror comedy about cross species pollination (did I get that wrong?). No matter what I try to watch every movie opening at South Point. I have no interest in this movie, but I look forward to being surprised to the good. Nefarious opened last year, and I was planning on a quick getaway. It turned out to be a scintillating movie that all of you should check out (Nefarious, not Cuckoo)..\n\nHarold and the Purple Crayon\n\nWritten by summer intern Michael Harris. Harold and the Purple Crayon is a well known book almost seventy years old. It only makes sense that a movie was made about it given the creativity drought in today’s animation industry. The ironic part of the Harold and the Purple Crayon movie is that it is full of creativity. The problem is the film is all over the place and does not always add up. Mixed with its unrealistic dialogue, and its plot weighing too much into everything then magically working out, this is not a movie I would pay to see. It is ultimately your choice, but I would recommend giving it a pass.\n\nTrap\n\nThe second Shyamalan family release this summer, the first by his daughter Ishana, The Watchers, which pretty much flopped, but I sort of enjoyed it. Very Shyamalan like. The second by M Night Shyamalan, this one called Trap, looks very interesting. A serial sadist killer playing the loving Daddy while holding a torture victim in a basement takes his daughter to a concert where he finds a trap set to catch him as he exits. And let the cat and mouse game begin.\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine\n\nWritten by second summer intern Jake Gaughan. Deadpool and Wolverine was fan service and nostalgia bait at its finest but more than anything it was a lot of fun! Ryan Reynolds and Hugh Jackman are playing the roles they were born to in this movie and they are at their best here. It’s the first Marvel movie to release in a long time that I have wanted to watch again. I watched it in XD and it was well worth the extra few bucks!\n\nDeadpool and Wolverine\n\nWarning. If you are old and prone to fall asleep in front of screens, please be aware that the bottom two rows of seats nearest the screen in the XD theaters recline all the way. They are the only two rows that function that way. At the first showtime of Deadpool and Wolverine, the theater was filled. I was forced to sit in the second row. I reclined all the way. I made it through the many previews and commercials. I watched the creative opening and an exciting and bloody and fun 20 minutes. Next I knew I woke up having missed a bunch of what I assume was great stuff. Thank goodness a summer intern is watching the movie tonight. I look forward to reading his brief.\n\nTwisters\n\nWritten by summer intern Michael Harris. I do not know what I feel about remakes. Sure, you know that the movie will be good, but it takes the creativity out of Hollywood. Well, at least that was what I thought before seeing this movie. Twisters was the first movie to pull me to the edge of my movie seat in a long time. It is a well done tribute to the original 1996 Twister with some notable references and a similar plot. The main difference is instead of collecting data about twisters, the storm chasers try to stop them. With constant danger and adventure lurking in every cloud, this is the storm you will not want to miss seeing on the Southpoint’s XD screens.\n\nTwisters\n\nThis looks like a winner. As horrible as weather has become, and as many people are suffering from climate change, we still are hooked by live feeds from tornados, hurricanes, tsunamis, heat domes, flooding, and the like. I loved Twister and Twisters should be double the fun. XD presentation is worth the extra $3 bucks. And it can’t hurt to go home and watch the original Twister and play the which is better game.\n\nFly Me To The Moon\n\nWritten by summer intern Michael Harris. Based on a true story… maybe? Fly Me to the Moon confronts the greatest conspiracy of all of mankind; was the moon landing fake? Watch as a sly, advertiser and pathological liar with a past to hide meets an honest, by the book launch director who is haunted by his mistakes in this romance-drama. Kelly Jones, played by Scarlett Johansson, and Cole Davis, played by Channing Tatum fall in love as their morals clash during America’s most monumental feat: putting man on the moon. As always, make sure to see this out of this world film on the big screen.\n\nLonglegs\n\nI have not been following this latest Nick Cage theater release. What is amazing is that movie stars are making direct to video big buck releases, while Mr. Cage seeks out deserving independent productions and infuses them with terrific performances. In a recent interview he chose “Pig” as his best performance. The title turned me off, but I will be streaming it this weekend. If you have the time and want to watch a fun under the radar Nick Cage flick, check out Retirement Plan.\n\nDespicable Me 4\n\nWritten by summer intern Michael Harris. Despicable Me 4 is an expected yet welcome addition to the Despicable Me/Minions franchise. After Despicable Me 3 changed the dynamic of the franchise from a more character development based movie to a more comedic and action based film, Illumination has been walking on a tightrope, careful not to lean too much on either theme. It is looking like this movie will take the best parts of both themes to breathe new life into this old franchise. From new characters to the unique humour the minions always carry, Despicable Me 4 is the one movie your children will want to see this summer on the big screen (not counting In and Out 2).\n\nInside Out 2\n\nWritten by summer intern Michael Harris. Finally, a movie to drag Disney out of the hole it dug through its recent yet under performing movies. Inside Out 2 adds depth to an animated movie like never before, but is still entertaining for your kids. From the complexity of puberty to an ironic allusion to Mickey Mouse, this is the one children’s movie both you and your children will enjoy. To truly feel the most emotion from this movie, make sure to watch it in our South Point XD theatres.\n\nBad Boys: Ride or Die\n\nWritten by summer intern Michael Harris. The bad boys are back so whatcha gonna do? This is the best bad boys movie yet, full of action and comedy and singing from Reba McEntire. Much of the movie is completely unexpected. There are many recurring themes like Martin Lawrence thinking he is invincible leading to great comedy moments, and Will Smith whose panic attacks give depth to the film. This is a must-see movie. And you must see it on our XD screens at the South Point."
