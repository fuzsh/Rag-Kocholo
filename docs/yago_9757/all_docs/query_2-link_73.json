        "text": "Barbie\n\nBarbie was my highlight of the year. I’ve never experienced anything like it, from the anticipation of going to the cinema to the aftermath of realising how some (men) did not get this film at all – it was a real eye-opener for me. At the cinema, America Ferrera’s speech got spontaneous cheers and applause. I felt there was finally a film made for me! A film-maker and big budget company understood what people like me want to see. I laughed and cried. I loved Ryan Gosling, the dance battle, the songs, the jokes. I loved it all. Suvi, 35, Edinburgh\n\nPast Lives\n\nAn exquisite, moving and thought-provoking meditation on love, loss and the immigrant experience, grounded in a beautifully subtle performance by Greta Lee. The conversation between the white American and Korean leads about dreaming in different languages was a standout moment in a gorgeous film that felt like a heartbreaking novel perfectly suited to a warm-bath-in-winter type of afternoon. So many feelings, so difficult to articulate. This movie was 2023’s zenith. Nicholas Rothwell, 27, London\n\nConcrete Utopia\n\nMy favourite film of 2023 by far is the South Korean disaster flick Concrete Utopia. It’s a contemporary, very Korean take on Lord of the Flies, with liberal doses of 1984 and The Admirable Crichton thrown in for good measure. Superbly acted with plenty of darkly comic plot twists along the way, I found it to be a thought-provoking and at times bleakly disturbing study of civilisation breakdown following an extreme natural disaster. I’ve never been more grateful not to be living in an earthquake zone! I was not at all surprised to learn that Concrete Utopia is the highest-grossing domestic film this year and has been selected as South Korea’s entry for best foreign film at the upcoming Oscars. Neil Brazil, 53, Malaysia\n\n20,000 Species of Bees\n\nA warm, empathic and heartfelt story centring on a young child’s struggles with gender identity and dysphoria. You can really feel the unease and pain of the eight-year-old Coco and, for me, the mother’s beautifully delicate response to their distress is pitch perfect. This Spanish film is extremely timely given the toxic nature of debate surrounding gender just now. It left me wondering how Coco’s complex issues would best be managed going forward. Indeed the film offers a great case study and useful starting point for a nuanced discussion regarding the support of a kid in a gender crisis. Andy Weston, 45, Glasgow\n\nKillers of the Flower Moon\n\nBrilliant film-revealing an overlooked tragedy of US history. For me, the sign of a great film or play is the achievement of a “willing suspension of disbelief” where the film or play is so totally engrossing, you forget you’re watching a movie or play, and become one with the experience. This film accomplished that rare feeling. So good that the 3hr 26min running time seemed like barely two hours. Scorsese, De Niro, DiCaprio and Lily Gladstone (and music by Robbie Robertson) all at the top of their profound artistry. Gil Jordan, 78, Montana, US\n\nBottoms\n\nIt was so fun and silly. I’ve not enjoyed a film that much in a long time. I’m such a huge fan of Rachel Sennott and Ayo Edebiri – their comedic timing and delivery in the film is flawless. And how often do we get representation for sapphics who fall in love with straight girls, or a bunch of women tearing up a field of footballers? That scene really spoke to me, it’s so ridiculous but somehow still seems plausible in the Bottoms universe. There aren’t many pure comedy films made like this nowadays. Chandni, 26, London\n\nOppenheimer\n\nIt’s one of the unlikeliest of summer blockbusters but, being a Christopher Nolan film, it delivered on spectacle as well as smarts. It cleverly uses the old Hollywood star power method of casting so you can follow who the major characters are, while never forgetting this is Cillian Murphy’s film in a once-in-a-lifetime role. Hopefully this will allow major studios to fund original features that audiences can discover. Thomas Gunn, 49, Stourbridge\n\nAnatomy of a Fall\n\nI see a lot of films but this one stood out for me this year. Unpredictable and gripping throughout, it kept you riveted and on the edge of your seat. Added intrigue is provided by issues of marriage, parenthood, career and a woman living abroad and having to go through a trial speaking in a second (or even third) language. The did-she, didn’t-she element is brilliantly maintained to the very end. Loved it. Jeremy Bunn, 77, London\n\nBlackBerry\n\nThis film is highly entertaining and there is just something about it that keeps me coming back to watch it again and again. Maybe it’s Glenn Howerton’s role as ruthless businessman Jim Balsillie; perhaps it’s the documentary-style cinematography that turns the audience into an observer. The ending is uniquely heartbreaking. It’s a Canadian product of Canadian artists about a Canadian company, so there’s clearly a lot of heart as well. I wish more people had seen this film while it was at the cinema because I truly believe it was the best of the year. J, 18, Birmingham\n\nFallen Leaves\n\nAki Kaurismäki’s beautifully understated Fallen Leaves is a love story for our times. Employing deadpan humour and boasting remarkable performances from Alma Pöysti and Jussi Vatanen, the film plastered a smile on my face for all of its (perfect) 81 minutes. Though a love story at its heart, it remains one of the most cogent anti-war films of recent years. Set in a seemingly alternate reality in the autumn of 2024 (landlines and tube radios abound), broadcasts throughout the film cover the early days of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. And it is here, in this affecting juxtaposition, that the power of this Finnish masterpiece lies - the characters’ act of love a defiant protest of Russia’s assault on normalcy. Kenneth McDonnell, 31, Berlin\n\nCocaine Bear\n\nI loved that the film was very very loosely based on a real story - why let the truth get in the way of a good elongated death scene? The film was hilarious and ridiculous and just the right amount of gory – and caused quite a bit of family drama. I am getting married in a forest in the US next year where there are known to be some bears. My family were so panicked by the idea of a dangerous bear in the woods after seeing the film that they called to try and get me to change the venue. Luckily, lots of national park ranger videos later, they are willing to attend. Megan Kemp, 30, Essex\n\nNimona\n\nThis is an absolute smasher of an animation released earlier this year. Based on a graphic novel by ND Stevenson, the world it’s set in is an amazingly detailed mashup of medieval knights and science-fiction. It explores pretty serious themes of identity, acceptance and compassion but is never heavy handed and doesn’t patronise younger viewers. There’s comedy, there’s action, drama, romance - it’s such a fantastic all-rounder. Suse, 43, Essex\n\nMission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One\n\nThe movie that really blew me away this year was Mission: Impossible - Dead Reckoning Part One. At a time when sequels and superhero films are really beginning to wear out their welcome, this was a refreshing blast of fresh air and really delivered on all counts. I particularly loved the strong female supporting roles (take a bow Hayley Atwell, Rebecca Ferguson, Vanessa Kirby and especially Pom Klementieff who lit up the screen despite having almost no lines). Formulaic, yes but also fresh, exciting and very prescient (keying in to current concerns about AI). Even my tenterhooks had tenterhooks! Peter, Shepperton\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nIt’s an incredible mixture of animation styles which are an absolute feast for the eyes- with a New York hip-hop soundtrack you can’t help but nod along to. It’s an exciting story with lots of twists and turns and emotional turbulence. Plenty of Easter eggs for the hardcore Spider-Man fans, and an outstanding cast, of which Jason Schwartzman as the Spot is my personal highlight. I’m always in awe when a film can look original, tell an exciting story and also make you feel all the big emotions. I can’t wait for the final instalment of this three-part series. Janika, 34, Glasgow\n\nThe Boy and the Heron\n\nMany people can walk away from it with different impressions of what this film’s central theme might be, but I felt it circled on the idea of inheritance. Natsuko inherits the role of Mahito’s mother, the young inherit war-stricken Japan, and Mahito is asked to inherit the stewardship of another realm. At my age, I feel I too am in the middle of inheriting something. It feels like the world’s leaders are growing older, its systems are decaying or inheriting the faults of decades past, my parents are ageing, and (Hiyao) Miyazaki himself is over 80 years old. The Boy and the Heron is my favourite film of the year because it asks me what I will do with the world I am inheriting. Syed Shams, 23, Houston, US\n\nRed, White & Royal Blue\n\nFrom the trailer, I wasn’t expecting much but I was bowled over by it and have watched in multiple times. This is one of the first romantic comedies where I felt seen and not stereotyped. It’s a film full of heart; a warm hug from an old friend, an emotional remembrance of what it was like to fall in love, and in these dark and tempestuous times, an escape from living in our current political hellscape. Isn’t that what some cinema is meant to provide? Henry Daniels, 50, Bristol\n\nMaestro\n\nGosh, Maestro was lavish, beautiful mainly black and white filming, some great music, stunning acting by Carey Mulligan and Bradley Cooper turning in Oscar-worthy performances. I really thought the way this film was shot was terrific, from closeups to observational shots, it all made you feel like a fly on the wall, witnessing scenes from the movie that was their life. So many layers of truth about art, creativity, sexuality, marriage, the tragedy and imperfections of love, the needs and drives of the creative artist, the silent pain of the supportive partner – there was so much to appreciate. Linda Bateman, 71, St Albans\n\nIndiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\n\nIt’s a fitting finale to the series and Harrison Ford did a great job. The film has everything you’d expect for an Indiana Jones film and I really enjoyed the use of the Antikythera device, which I’d heard about some years ago. What really blew me away was the final sequence. When I realised the device was being used for time travel, I got really excited and suddenly realised where they were going. What a way to finish it all off. Lesley Clayton, 63, Truro\n\nSaltburn\n\nThe revenge of suburbia! It plays into the class system and the perceptions and stereotypes applied to working-class people. So many turns and complexities. All of the characters were utterly horrible, watching the film you wanted someone to come good and no one did. The costumes and scenery oozed the decayed indulgence of privilege. The film was just so mesmerising and the absolute wickedness was so enjoyable you really did not know what was coming next. A fantastic film. Heidi Douglas, 54, Dundee\n\nA Little Life"
