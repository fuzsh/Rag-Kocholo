        "text": "Dear Ms. Undset,\n\nActually, can I call you Sigrid? I think we would be friends, if I could ever finagle myself back to turn-of-the-century Norway. We could go on tour together, see the Continent! I too love the Middle Ages; I delighted in Kristin Lavransdatter and now that I’ve read The Sagas of the Icelanders, we could gossip about those crazy settlers. But I’m actually writing to you about Jenny, a novel you set in its current time. You wrote it after your own trip to Italy, and before your conversion to Catholicism, and I must admit I was startled at how vivid and modern it felt. The way you bring to life the expat experience was so perfect, I couldn’t help thinking back to my own study abroad days! And I wished I could join Jenny and her circle of artist friends: she was so alive, probably happy to be free from her school teacher days. Now Sigrid, I hope this isn’t too much of a liberty, but I suspect Jenny had more than a bit of basis in yourself. You too went to Rome in your late twenties and made friends with a group of Scandinavians living there. And you also found love. I was saddened to see how love and ‘womanly’ responsibilities interfered with women artists; the more things change, the more they stay the same.\n\nOf course, the similarities only go so far. When I realised you were an author of the Wharton school, it made me nervous to keep turning the pages, although of course I did. You drew me completely into Jenny’s life and her head, and the whole novel entranced me. I’m surprised it’s so little known in my time: the writing and character profiles are just perfect. And you did win that Nobel! I think even readers who didn’t, forgive me, get along as well with Kristin Lavransdatter will love Jenny. The new Tiina Nunally translation I read helped as well: it’s found in The Unknown Sigrid Undset. I’m very happy I read it, and I look forward to exploring more of your works.\n\nYour Admirer,\n\nEva\n\nSuggested Companion Reads"
