        "text": "Although I try to avoid resolutions at the turning of the year given the tendency of us all to come up short on them, one thing I am attempting to do more of (no set goal only more) is read Norwegian novels in the original.\n\nI have started with a classic Norwegian novel, Sult by Knut Hamsun, first published in 1890. The book has been translated three times into English, first by George Egerton (Maary Elizabeth Dunne) in 1899, with later 20th century translations by Robert Bly, and in the mid-1990s by Sverre Lyngstad, which is fast establishing itself as the standard translation.\n\nTo aid me in my quest, I have bought not one but two copies of the novel in Norwegian (one with the original 1890 text) and another, newly published in pocket paperback that includes some smoothing out of the unusual (and in its time relatively unstable) Dano-Norwegian of Hamsun’s time. This Dano-Norwegian was the same version of the language that James Joyce tried to master in order to write to Henrik Ibsen. Hamsun’s work—and Sult especially—is an attempt to get away from Ibsenian social realism.\n\nFor the time being, we don’t have an English translation in the house, though some readers of my newsletter might be aware that we do have a French translation of Sult, which was bought in a second hand bookshop in Tabor in the Czech Republic, where Miriam and I first met.\n\nAs I am now reading the book in Norwegian for the first time, I decided to take down this French translation from our shelves.\n\nThe book we have is published by Les Éditions Rieder, a French publishing house that was founded in 1913 and merged into Presses universitaires de France in 1939. The translation was first published in 1926, and translated by Georges Sautreau. This was in fact the second translation of the novel into French, following a first translation by Edmond Bayle in 1895. Presumably the new translation by Sautreau was spurred on by Hamsun’s winning the Nobel prize for literature in 1920. This edition of La Faim was published in 1930 and was the 16th impression, which attests perhaps somewhat to its popularity. It formed part of Éditions Rieder’s series “Les Prosateurs Etrangers Modernes”—Modern Foreign Prose Writers. A number of Hamsun’s novels were part of this series, most of them translated by Sautreau. This edition of La Faim also includes a preface by Octave Mirbeau (perhaps best-known for his Diary of a Chambermaid) from 1895, presumably written to preface the Bayle translation.\n\nSautreau’s interest in and connection to Norway and its literary scene was particularly strong. He was in fact married to Dagny Bjørnson, the youngest daughter of Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, whose importance for the Norwegian cultural and literary revival of the mid- to late nineteenth century is on a par with that of Ibsen (Bjørnson won the Nobel prize for literature in 1903). Dagny and Georges married in 1913 and lived in Paris, though as photographs from the Norwegian Digital Museum show, they were often photographed visiting Aulestad, the Bjørnson homeplace. Sautreau, in addition to translating Hamsun, also had a hand in bringing some of Sigrid Undset’s work into French, as well as a variety of other Norwegian authors, many though not all for Éditions Rieder.\n\nI notice on the inside leaf of the book we have that there is a long dedication, which runs as follows\n\nOh! ne laissons jamais souse le doute énervant\n\nNotre âme s’affaisser comme le flot au vent;\n\nRecevons, sans pâlir, les coups de la souffrance,\n\nQue le bien seulement ait notre souvenir:\n\nOublions le passé pour croire à l’avenir.\n\nEt buvons en marchant le vin de l’espérance.\n\nE. Eggis\n\nNouvel-an 32.\n\nE. [indecipherable]\n\nThe piece of verse—whoever Eggis was, I have no clue—which can be roughly translated via google translate (& with a little help from Larousse French English Dictionary) runs as follows:\n\nOh! never under enervating doubt let\n\nOur soul sag like a wave in the wind;\n\nLet us receive without fading the blows of suffering,\n\nMay the good only be remembered:\n\nLet's forget the past to believe in the future\n\nAnd let us drink up as we go the wine of hope.\n\nIt was given as gift for the New Year in 1932, some 90 years ago now. Though, I think we can perhaps all agree that the sentiments in the verse remain useful as we enter a new year!\n\nOn The Bookwheel\n\nMarc Chabrier (ed.), Larousse Concise French English Dictionary, Paris: Larousse 2004.\n\nKnut Hamsun, La Faim, (trans.
