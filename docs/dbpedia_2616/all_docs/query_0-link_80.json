        "text": "Category Archives: Women in Translation\n\nSeeing Red – Lina Meruane (translated by Megan McDowell)\n\nFor myself Spanish Literature Month is now in full swing, the “to be read” pile has been sorted, with Spanish titles put in their own pile and I can assure you I will not be getting through them all. Without any semblance of a plan for getting through the works I thought I’d just start and see where my journey took me – I’ve landed in Chile (via a quick bizarre “autobiography” from Mexico) and am going to stay here for a little while.\n\nAnother input that briefly crossed my mind was the amount (or lack) of female representation in the Spanish language (primarily middle and South America) books in my pile. Under no circumstance do I want to delay any reading of female authored books, just so I can have a “women only” exclusive month in August for “Women In Translation” Month. It defeats the purpose if I simply avoid female writers for eleven months of the year and prop up the statistics with a one month focus. The issue is I’ll be reviewing at about the 70/30 ratio as per standard publication rates for translated fiction.\n\n“Seeing Red” has a simple premise, a Chilean girl, Lina, our narrator (and our novelist’s name), who is studying in New York has her eyes suddenly fill with blood, causing her sight to be impaired, so severely she cannot see. This event was not unexpected, it was always on the cards, but it still comes as a sudden event…\n\nOnly a few days until the eye doctor comes back from his conference and sees the terminal state of my retinas. Maybe Friday. It’s only Tuesday. Three days during which we have to resolve the rest of our lives.\n\nA simple premise yes, but this is not simply a novel about blindness. Our narrator has recently begun a relationship with a new boyfriend, she has been up front and honest about the potential loss of sight, she also has a trip back to Santiago, Chile planned, how will this latest event impact her relationship and ability to travel?\n\nAgain, these are all just inputs into a linear plot, this novel is so much more than that. There is plenty of material that talks about this being an autobiographical novel, apparently Lina Meruane being struck blind whilst living in New York, and the eyes filling with blood happens on the first page of this short book, not having sight is the start of Lina’s journey.\n\nOn the shore stood Fate and he was raising a question, an admonition. What did you come here looking for? he said, pointing one finger. What did you lose on this island?\n\nTo highlight the effect of no sight, all of the other senses are explored, and the heightened reliance on sounds and touch come to the fore, this is a novel of the senses, although being a necessity there is also a celebration in the strength of hearing, the reliance on memory.\n\nHe makes his breakfast and my coffee with milk as I rummage among the black clothes in the closet, zip up my boots, adjust my glasses—also dark—and we head out like commandos on a secret mission: he’s describing obstacles on the sidewalks and giving clues to the initiate, he’s the militia leader who supplies street names for her to memorize, inserts the metro card into a slot before she can move through the turnstile. He is the one who instructs her on the number of steps leading to the platform, and he announces a long step to cross the gap.\n\nSwitching between first person and third person narrative as our narrator “sees” herself from a distance when struggling with the reality of her predicament, the unreality of a doctor explaining the long term blindness is projected onto somebody else. A visit back to Santiago, Lina’s learned parents distancing themselves from the reality of the situation, one brother avoiding the situation completely, the other attempting to understand, all build as the question of familial love bubbles to the top.\n\nAs mentioned in my “Distant Star” review by Roberto Bolaño (translated by Chris Andrews) there are also the feelings of being in exile, a Chilean with no home;\n\nIn New Jersey I’d forgotten all my Spanish. Later, in Santiago, I’d forgotten English. Now I’m forgetting myself, I thought.\n\nAnd of course there is a hint of the political;\n\nThe car shot through the city like a meteor until we reached La Moneda palace, which appeared to me white, immaculate, the way it was before military helicopters flying overhead dropped bombs on it, and in the midst of the imagined offensive, with the soundtrack of the dictator’s voice announcing his ignominious victory in the background.\n\nA novel constructed in single paragraph chapters, each with a heading, the reality of a bleak situation slowly unpeels, we learn of the years of knowledge and treatment to avoid this potential physical deterioration that happens on page one, instead of a journey into blindness the immediacy of the situation makes it a journey into understanding and life beyond being able to see.\n\nHaving said all that, at the core this really is a love story, an exploration of what it means to “unconditionally” love somebody, would a parent actually give up an eye for their child? The “it depends on how much you love me” statements starting to pepper our narrator’s thoughts as the reality of her situation becomes darker by the day. Conversations happen as recollections of Lina’s and are transposed into the diary style memoir, we only learn of our narrator’s side to event.\n\nAnd our narrator is a writer too, struggling with the reality that to write without sight is going to require retraining of habits;\n\nEven now, even here, in this very passage, I confess it was not difficult to stop writing. It was much more arduous to find a pen, wrap my fingers around it, know that crooked words unreadable even by Ignacio were falling onto the page. Because as the world went black, everything that belonged to it was also left in the dark.\n\nA book that works on so many levels, physical, metaphysical, familial, relationships, exiled writers, this is another fine release from Dallas not-for-profit independent publisher Deep Vellum, who in such a short period of time have unearthed a wonderful collection of translated books.\n\nCopy courtesy of Deep Vellum.\n\nLoad Poems Like Guns: Women’s Poetry from Herat, Afghanistan – Edited and translated by Farzana Marie\n\nThis year I had only read one poetry collection from the Best Translated Book Award longlist, “Wild Words – Four Tamil Poets” – Malathi Maithri, Salma, Kutti Revathi & Sukirtharani (translated by Lakshmi Holmström), and the similarly focused work “Load Poems Like Guns: Women’s Poetry from Herat, Afghanistan” edited and translated by Farzana Marie appealed to me specifically because it features women’s poetry (as a proud supporter of their being more Women In Translation, reviewing female works from all spectrums is part of my credo) and because it comes from a marginalised group.\n\n…poetry, with its symbolic language, is being explored and effectively used as a powerful means of protest against gender discrimination and injustice… (taken from the Foreword)\n\nFrom the mid 1990’s through to 2001, during the Taliban rule in Afghanistan, the regime restricted reading, writing and all forms of education for women in the country. Herat, with a lively arts culture, and a stronghold of literature and poetry, whilst underground, managed to continue female involvement in education, reading and writing and after 2001 a new movement of women’s poetry became visible.\n\nDwindling international military support accompanied by reduced development funding, recovering from the debacle of the 2014 presidential election, and potential negotiations with insurgents all bear serious implications for the situation of women in Afghan society. The broad spectrum of emotions, images and ideas represented in the post-Taliban poetry of Herati women is important for grasping layers of nuance in contemporary societal and gender issues that are often simplified for public consumption.\n\nBesides a Foreword and a substantial Introduction by the editor and translator of the collection, Farzana Marie, the collection opens with the poems of Nadia Anjuman, allegedly the most prominent of the post-Taliban female poets, a published writer who, at age 24, was killed by her husband. Interestingly the poems in this collection by Nadia Anjuman only cover the period 1999-2002, when the introduction speaks of her marriage in 2004, her poetry subsequently becoming darker and her first book being released in 2005 (interestingly the first published work by a female poet after the Taliban rule). Her husband spent a mere four months in jail for the murder and not having any works from the period after her marriage it is impossible to judge if there are any changes in her work post marriage.\n\nThe first poem in the collection is “Makes No Sense”, which is also known as “Afghan Girl” given the poem was used as lyrics in a popular Afghan song by Shahla Zaland. This is a poem that speaks of repression of women, them being voiceless; “stifling songs is my abuser’s strongest skill”, however the power of the soul, which can whisper songs, “Though melodies drain from memory” until “an Afghan woman wails and sings, and wail and sing I will.” There can also be a simpler reading of the poem, an exploration of grief and remorse striking the victim silent, speechless, until the soul takes over and the wailing/singing comes forth.\n\nSmoke-Bloom\n\nI’m full of the feeling of emptiness,\n\nfull.\n\nAn abundant famine\n\nboils me in my soul’s fevered fields,\n\nand this strange waterless boiling\n\nstartled the image in my poem\n\nto life.\n\nHere we have the immediate clash of images such as “emptiness” and “full”, “abundant” and “famine” (and “fields”), “waterless” and “boiling”, even though these images are polar opposites, it is through this balance that the actual work comes to life.\n\nMuzhgan Faramanesh’s poems are short ghazals or even shorter quatrains, following a traditional Persian style but using modern contemporary themes and issues. Her works are of suffering, we have tears, eye witnesses to pain, and she is “craving to write [of] the ferocity of grief” but has a wish that God spares you the same. There is a work (“Ghazal 2”) that uses the unrequited love theme, brought home startlingly when we learn of the death of the protagonist, a death by someone else’s hand, a victim of a suicide bomb. Stark images of gunshot residue, fire, and the word “prey” immediately bring the reader back from the earlier sections of heart-ache and love’s gaze.\n\nHowever it is not only these poets that have a strong activist edge, all the poetry presented here addressing repression, war, violence, death, feminism and like subjects.\n\nRows of Pockmarked Homes\n\nRows of pockmarked homes down our street\n\nmotion, calling –\n\nhey,\n\nwho stole the stones\n\nto build a human?\n\nThe title of the collection comes from a poem by Somaya Ramesh (a section below)\n\nLoad poems like guns –\n\neach moment is loaded\n\nwith bombs\n\nbullets\n\nblasts\n\ndeath-sounds –\n\ndeath and war\n\ndon’t follow the rules\n\nyou can make your pages into white flags\n\na thousand times\n\nbut swallow your words, say no more.\n\nWhilst a confronting collection and a work that needs to be recognised, not only this work but the ongoing writing of these empowered women pushing literary boundaries in their country, I do feel it is a book that promises a lot but delivers a lot less. Each poet is introduced and it is then followed by an individual “translator’s note”. Each of these notes reveals a weakness in Farzana Marie’s translation, she explains too much of the choices she has made, her detailed explanations impact the personal reading of the poems. The poems themselves no longer become a translated work they now become a translated/interpreted and explained work.\n\nI also took umbrage at…”Sharifi’s poem “A Gamble” may have the most contemporary and relatable feel for English-speaking, especially American, readers, who have witnessed and experienced the most crushing economic trends in recent history.” This in a book that is dealing with women who have been denied education, a nation that has undergone decades of war! Personally I picked up this book to read Afghan women poets, I don’t want opinion pieces about first world problems.\n\nWhen the neighbor’s kid continues\n\nto learn “b” for battlefield\n\nand “j” for jihad,\n\nhow will we be able to breathe\n\nthrough the gunpowder?\n\n– From Protestby Elaha Sahel\n\nWhilst an important work, I think the collection falls down in the manner it has been delivered. We have 54 pages of foreword, introduction and translator notes, 8 pages of biographies (ie. 62 pages of text by Farzana Marie) and a mere 41 pages of poems (82 actually as they are presented in both Persian and English) a number of the poems stretching to a mere four or five lines. The subject itself falling into the background of the explanations.\n\nHaving said all that, it was an enlightening time and an educational one too, to read this book, to visit an important literary sub-culture in a region not too often visited by English speaking readers. The poets themselves presenting a powerful collection of works, with vivid imagery, it is a pity there was only a limited collection of them.\n\nPanty – Sangeeta Bandyopadhyay (translated by Arunava Sinha)\n\nAustralian writer Gerald Murnane was featured in the US publication “Music and Literature No 3” where, along with critical essays, he was interviewed about his work and wrote a letter in reply to a journalist about the feeling of distance in his writing, his “space”, the universe being three-dimensional and the mind;\n\nYou wrote about a feeling of distance in my writing. You are a perceptive fellow. Notions of space or distance are nearly always in my thoughts…I hardly need to remind you that I think of mind as space. I long ago rejected the popular theories of the mind advanced in the twentieth century. For me, the mind is extent and, quite possibly, endless, that is to say, infinite. This would entail, I suppose, the belief that all minds are one or even that everything is mind, but that sort of speculation is not for me. I have enough to do during my lifetime with uncovering the patterns of imagery in my corner of mind without seeking further.\n\nInterestingly the concept of space, the continuum between the heart and the mind, came to the fore with the very next book I picked up after reading Murnane’s letter.\n\nTilted Axis Press is a new south London based publisher, a not-for-profit press “on a mission to shake up contemporary international literature.” According to their website they publish “the books that might not otherwise make it into English, for the very reasons that make them exciting to us – artistic originality, radical vision, the sense that here is something new.” Founded by Deborah Smith, yes THE Deborah Smith who recently won the Man Booker International Prize for her translation of Han Kang’s “The Vegetarian”, their name comes from “tilting the axis of world literature from the centre to the margins…these margins are spaces of completing innovation, where multiple traditions spark new forms and translation plays a crucial role.\n\nAnd their first release, from India, Sangeeta Bandyopadhyay’s “Panty” (translated by Arunava Sinha) is a work that very much plays in the margins, a story about space itself.\n\nShe “who had no name, no identity, no family, no city or village, no property or assets” arrives in the city in the middle of the night and is put up in a large dark apartment by a mysterious man. The only thing left in the apartment (there is no light, our narrator is in darkness metaphorically and physically), is a pair of stained leopard skin panties. Due to the onset of our protagonist’s period and with no other clothes our mystery woman puts in the panties;\n\nI slipped into the panty.\n\nWhat I did not know was that I had actually stepped into a woman.\n\nI slipped into her womanhood.\n\nHer sexuality, her love.\n\nI slipped into her desire, her sinful adultery, her humiliation and sorrow, her shame and loathing. I had entered her life, though I didn’t know it. I even slipped into her defeat and her withdrawal. I slipped into her nation too, in that moment. Trite thoughts about her world passed through my mind. How fine the material was, I reflected. Soft. A perfect fit. As though tailored especially for me. After putting it one, I was no longer repulsed. I lay down, spreading my hair out on the pillow. Although I do not admit that I fell asleep, it is undeniable that I was woken up by a series of sounds in the room.\n\nChapter numbers are random (or are they) starting at Chapter 29, moving to 15, then 11, back to 18 etc. with not all numbers covered this is very much a fractured tale of a fractured nation, India. Whilst fractured this book is also, very much like the Tilted Axis agenda, a work that plays with “spaces”. Opening with a definition from the translator of the Bangla word “mōn”;\n\nIn the ontology that English-reading people have acquired through their books, the heart and the mind are binary – neither word can be used to refer to the other. In Indian languages, however, this word (mōn in Bangla, man in Hindi) represents neither the heart nor the mind exclusively. It takes a position, contextually to the rest of the text, on a continuum between the heart and the mind, between emotion and reason, between feeling and knowing.”\n\n– Arunava Sinha\n\nThese spaces, not only of the heart and mind, are a constant theme, urban spaces, the space between happiness and disgrace, “legitimate” and Illicit”, man and woman (“the eternal unquestioning game between man and woman instantly began anew, creating two opposing but complementary forces.”), foreigners and locals, street people and urban dwellers, light and dark, the darkness between sanity and insanity, the spaces between religions.\n\nOnce, in an urge to ascertain the meanings of ‘legitimate’ and ‘illicit’, she had wished for a space that was at once one of emptiness and of equilibrium, the kind of space that defied the laws of nature. She had searched for such a space, but never found it.\n\nA multi layered visceral novel that not only pushes the boundaries of what you would expect of Bengali literature, this is a dreamlike sequence where the anonymous becomes less known, where your expectations are not met, a work where you fall into the spaces, where deconstruction is part of the construction.\n\nLet yourself go, explore the gaps in India’s culture, the spaces in our own lives, can you leap from a white wall to a brown one?\n\nThe book also includes a short story about submission entitled “Sahana, or Shamim”. I dare you… submit.\n\nThe Story of the Lost Child – Elena Ferrante (translated by Anne Goldstein) – Man Booker International Prize 2016 and Best Translated Book Award 2016\n\nToday I’m looking at a book that has made both the Man Booker International Prize shortlist and the Best Translated Book Award shortlist for 2016, a novel I read on its release back in September 2015, Elena Ferrante’s “The Story Of The Lost Child” (translated by Ann Goldstein).\n\nI am going to imagine a situation, I am a reader, I want to try something from a well-known prize shortlist, I want something by a female writer, something European, Ferrante it is (I could choose “Murder Most Serene” by Gabrielle Wittkop, translated by Louise Rogers Lalaurie, but that’s highly unlikely, Ferrante is the only qualifier under the “female, European” criteria on both lists, Wittkop not being eligible for the Man Booker and therefore not on the list). I am surprised, the local bookshop has quite a few copies, must be a good book, I’m not even going to read the back cover, it may influence my purchasing decision, that’s it, mind is made up, cash changes hands, I’m now the proud owner of a “literary” work from Italy. Can’t wait to snuggle down and read it…\n\nI seem to recall somebody at the book club mentioning this anonymous Italian writer, something about “Ferrante Fever”. Being a strong anti-vaccine activist, I haven’t received my inoculations to stop the malaise hitting me, but with a pretty solid immune system I’m very confident that although some symptoms may appear, I will not succumb to a full blown fever, I’ve read four volumes (and am about to start a fifth) of Karl Ove Knausgaard’s personal struggle, if that didn’t give me night sweats and fatigue I’m fairly confident a publicity shy Italian will carry no germs.\n\nThe first pages have an “Index of Characters”, we start off with the “Cerullo family (the shoemaker’s family), Raffaella Cerullo, called Lina, or Lila. She was born in August 1944, and is sixty-six when she disappears from Naples without a trace. At the age of sixteen, she married Stefano Carracci, but during a vacation on Ischia she falls in love with Nino Sarratore, for whom she leaves her husband. After the disastrous end of her relationship with Nino, the birth of her son Gennaro (also called Rino), and the discovery that Stefano is expecting a child with Ada Cappuccio, Lila leaves him definitively. She moves with Enzo Scanno to San Giovanni a Teduccio, but several years later she returns to the neighbourhood with Enzo and Gennaro.”\n\nWHAT? “The neighbourhood”? What neighbourhood? Who are these people? She disappears without a trace? When? If so why is she in this book? Who is Enzo?\n\nDamn this list of people, I’m going to start reading it.\n\nOkay, the first page and a half we have Lila, Nino, Dede and Elsa (the sentence introducing them reads “In reality, what mattered more than that offense was the mention of Dede and Elsa.”), Marcello Solara, Gennaro, Stefano and then it spirals a few more pages with some bloke called Pietro turning up.\n\nI better go back to the list of characters….no joy…back to the book.\n\nNino goes to Naples, Lena to Florence, but who is Adele in Milan?\n\nLet’s face it the foundations, the very core has been laid in the previous three works, well and truly before you even open this book.\n\nYes, of course, it is a measured opening here, it is slowly reintroducing us to the people, reminding us of the affair Lena is having, re-establishing the various cities and their significance and of course we need to be reminded of the influence that Lila plays over Lena’s life.\n\nBut in my opinion, the whole scenario is bizarre – how can this book be up for these awards? The book, to a new reader, makes no sense, who are these people? Maybe the back cover would help you out, give you an idea of what is going on….WHAT, it is just reviews?? Ohhh it’s on the front cover “The Fourth and Final Neapolitan Novel”? Why didn’t anybody tell me?\n\nI know I would probably be living in a cave not to know this is part of a series, but I’m trying to make a point okay?!?\n\nI know this rambling is not really a review of Ferrante’s latest per se, however what is the point of adding yet another view to the plethora of opinions that are out in cyberspace? It wouldn’t count for much at all, if anything. This rant is merely my opinion as to the merits of this work winning either the Man Booker International Prize or the Best Translated Book Award. Neither of these prizes is given for a body of work (although the Man Booker International Prize was for a body of work, not a specific book, prior to this year, it is no longer the case). As a standalone novel I was seriously disappointed that it made either list, let alone both. Is this on these lists as a consolation for the Independent Foreign Fiction Prize ignoring the first three instalments? Or the Best Translated Book Award feeling guilty that the opener in the series “My Brilliant Friend” was completely overlooked and the following two, although being shortlisted, were beaten by László Krasznahorkai (“Seiobo There Below”) and Can Xu (“The Last Lover”)?\n\nLet’s face it, book number four is going to be bought by people who have read numbers 1-3, number four is going to be liked by people who have already read 1,200 pages about Lena and Lila, it’s a conclusion, people like closure, they’ll feel as though they’ve lost a friend but they’ve gained an experience.\n\nLet’s have a look at the Goodreads reviews of the Ferrante fever:\n\n“My Brilliant Friend” – average 3.9 from 35,557 ratings (30% are 5 star)\n\n“The Story of a New Name” – average 4.4 from 15,305 ratings (52% are 5 star)\n\n“Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay” – average 4.32 from 11,401 ratings (48% are 5 star)\n\n“The Story of the Lost Child” – average 4.42 from 9,149 ratings (56% are 5 star)\n\nNumber of ratings decreasing, as you would expect whilst people make their way through the books, and of course there will always be people who drop off the bandwagon along the way, but the ratings themselves are increasing the further people get into the works. Another interesting point is the lowest average scores come for the first novel, a work people may have tried and decided to go no further, only adding fuel to the fire that a score will increase the further you travel along the series journey, only diehards are going to read 1,600 pages.\n\nPersonally I did not enjoy the third in the series anywhere near as much as the first two (my review here reflected that) http://messybooker.blogspot.com.au/2014/12/those-who-leave-and-those-who-stay.htmland this feeling carried over to “The Story of The Lost Child”, although I did think it was much stronger than “Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay”. Having struggled with writing a review for this book when the reading public has the fever, with four books all in the best seller lists, I’ve resigned myself to just presenting my view that as a standalone novel this book should not be on the award shortlists. You watch it win both.\n\nWar, So Much War – Mercè Rodoreda (translated by Maruxa Relaño and Martha Tennent) – Best Translated Book Award 2016\n\nI have spent the last couple of months getting through the United Kingdom based Man Booker International prize longlist, but at the same time I had one eye looking sideways at the emerging titles on the United States based Best Translated Book Award. The Man Booker International Prize announced a longlist of thirteen titles on 10 March, and trimmed the list to six on 14 April, giving avid readers five weeks to get through their list. Meanwhile the Best Translated Book Award announces a fiction longlist of twenty-five titles, they did so this year on 29 March and their shortlist consists of ten books which they announced 21 days after the longlist!!! Three weeks to get through twenty-five books, methinks not. I think a longer period between the two announcements would elicit more discussion, more reading, more sales (for example there are eight works on the longlist that I haven’t read and which did not make the shortlist, with a longer timeframe there is a very good chance I would have read those books, with piles of unread books stacking up around me there is a very much reduced chance that I will go out of my way and hunt these eight books down).\n\nA couple of the books shortlisted for the Best Translated Book Award were already on my “to be read” pile, “The Physics of Sorrow” by Georgi Gospodinov (translated from the Bulgarian by Angela Rodel) and “War, So Much War” by Mercè Rodoreda (translated from the Catalan by Maruxa Relaño and Martha Tennent), as a result of my subscription to Open Letter books. Congratulations to them for publishing two titles that are deemed representative enough to make such a prestigious shortlist.\n\nMercè Rodoreda’s “War, So Much War” is set during the Spanish Civil War, however if you are after a traditional “war” story, or revelations from a Catalan point of view about the events of the Spanish Civil War, then I suggest you look elsewhere.\n\nThis book has forty-three chapters, each a small poignant, matter of fact vignette, written in the first person, with our narrator/protagonist being Adrià Guinart, a young boy “born at midnight, in the autumn of the year, with a birthmark on” his “forehead no bigger than a lentil.”\n\nThe house was ancient, the sink had a terrible stench, the faucet leaked. On windy days the cold crept in through the cracks, but in good weather the smell of flowers permeated every corner. On the Sundays when my father wasn’t of a mind to visit his cousins, he would take me for a walk. We spent hours sitting by the side of the road, and sometimes the air winnowed threads from the hearts of stunted flowers, and some would catch in my clothes. It seemed to me that people were all the same: with legs, with thighs, with eyes, mouths, teeth. I walked along, straight as a ninepin, holding the hand of my father who was tall and very good. I don’t know why I resented girls; if I ever got my hands on one, I would wring her neck like you would a bird’s. They exhaust motherly love.\n\nAs the announcement of the breakout of war reaches Adrià, he decides to run away from his family home, a carnation growing farm on the outskirts of Barcelona, half committing to joining the war, half simply joining other boys, his “coming of age” search from individuality, freedom. He spends the rest of our novel escaping, or running from, the war, and wandering from one fantastical adventure to the next.\n\nWith elements of dark fairy tales and a feeling that there is a parallel to Homer’s “Odyssey” (more on that later) each vignette reveals a little more of Adrià’s fears, hopes, dreams.\n\nThe novel is a blend of numerous influences. We have Biblical references, “They know not what they do”, and stigmata makes an appearance. Mystical references, for example Chapter IV is titled “The Hanged Man, is this a reference to the Tarot Card? Martyrdom? Suspension in time? A sacrifice for the greater good? Or is our narrator, by running away from home, breaking old patterns of behaviour and restrictive bad habits? Or is it simply a tale about a man who is hanging from a tree branch?\n\nThere are also messages of hope, a bright future;\n\nSoon, even more shell-hued than the previous night’s moon, the new day awoke to eyes that have never tired of seeing the tenderness it brings.\n\nThere is a never ending cast of characters who enter Adrià’s circle and then simply disappear as he moves on to another adventure. We have Narcisa, the female form of Narcissus, derived from ναρκη (narke) meaning “sleep, numbness”, appearing as the wife of a man who cannot help but fall asleep all the time, he is a “cyclops” of sorts, a one eyed man:\n\nA man came and stretched out beside me. He was portly and his skin glistened as if it had been smeared with lard. He folded his hands over his bellow. I could only see one of this eyes, beneath an eyebrow with hairs thicker than esparto. The eye studied me, then quickly closed, only to open again slowly.\n\nWonderfully rich characters who all have influences on Adrià’s development. The novel is broken into three parts and at the end of Part One Adrià is living/hiding with Pere Ardèvol, a man who contemplates the sea and spends many hours looking into a mirrow, “each person is the mirror of the entire universe.” When Pere dies he leaves his full estate to Adrià on the condition that he shred and burn all of his documents. Adrià reads them and this leads us to Part Two of the novel.\n\nPart Two includes dream sequences, a repetition of events that Adrià himself has recently experienced when he came to Pere’s farm but events that Pere himself experienced when he was younger. “Under what conditions can one become another?” As is my usual want here I won’t reveal any more of the plot…\n\nThis is a novel packed with riddles, parables, dark tales and a cast of characters too numerous to mention. We have a wanderer who walks with his back to the moon and sun so he can keep his shadow company, a moon-shaped man, and naked nymphs in the reeds with pitchforks, young girls on the beach tossing an orange, girls who are afraid of the waves. All presented in a rich, descriptive language:\n\nThe henhouse was at the back of the vegetable garden. I crept toward it, life a wolf stealing through the artichokes. A hen was clucking like made, I would eat her egg. The frightened fowl stood over her nest, legs deep in the straw, staring at me. The egg tasted like hazelnuts. Three more hens, still as death, craned their necks forward as they perched on their nests. Their wattles dropped, their combs drooped, they were old hens, has laid many eggs, marched little chicks around. I heard the sound of a slamming door coming from the direction of the house, followed by the squeak of a pulley. The egg had made me hungry. I left the vegetable garden. There wasn’t a village in sight. I was surrounded by fields. I was suddenly struck by a flash of sadness, and I shook it off in a hurry. Somehow, I would find what I needed. I continued on my way, slit-eyed, blinded by a sun that had a deeper yolk color than the egg I had just swallowed. I was walking in the bright sunlight, my mind on other things, when I tripped and fell, bloodying my knee. The blood was red, redder than a red carnation, redder than the drooping combs of those golden hens.\n\nMulti layered and with a depth that demands re-reading and exploring in detail, this is a complex, but at the same time thoroughly readable, work. Drawing on myth, Christian icons, medieval, and classical characters, Mercè Rodoreda’s final novel was so enjoyable, I will be hunting down further translated works from her bibliography. In fact I have already committed to reading two via my “Classics Club” list of fifty classic translated books.\n\nAnother wonderful Catalan work that was published last year was “Life Embitters” by Josep Pla (translated by Peter Roland Bush) published by Archipelago Books, a very large collection of short stories, over 600 pages worth, which is written in a more “straight forward” narrative style if you would like to explore Catalan Literature outside of this dark and frolicking work.\n\nA worthy entrant on the Best Translated Book Award shortlist, one I thoroughly enjoyed, a tale of a wandering young boy, observing the war around him, meeting so many characters he simply has to become a man:\n\nI enjoyed nothing more than wandering throughout the world lost. Doing as I please no matter how things turned out, with no one giving me any advice. Seeing the sky, the forests, experiencing fear, contemplating the night and it having a roof.\n\nThe Story Of My Teeth – Valeria Luiselli (translated by Christina MacSweeney) – Best Translated Book Award 2016\n\nThe teeth are the true windows to the soul; they are the tabula rasa The teeth are the true windows to the soul; they are the tabula rasa on which all our vices and all our virtues are inscribed.\n\nLast year Valeria Luiselli was shortlisted for the Best Translated Book Award for her novel “Faces In The Crowd” (translated by Christina MacSweeney) and she backs up with a further shortlisting in 2016 for “The Story of My Teeth” (also translated by Christina MacSweeney). A few days ago I wrote about young female writers, pushing traditional literature’s boundaries, and Luiselli definitely sits in that boat.\n\nIn the Afterwordto this work, our author explains that the book is the result of several collaborations. Working with a serial novel style (a la Dickens’ “The Pickwick Papers”), Luiselli released low-budget chapbooks for distribution to factory workers in a juice factory, and a reading club was established. Recording the worker’s discussions about the chapbooks, their insights and discussions dictated the course of the narrative for future instalments. As Luiselli says “The result of these shared concerns is this collective “novel-essay” about the production of value and meaning in contemporary art and literature.”\n\nOur story opens with Gustavo Sánchez Sánchez, or ‘Highway’, our protagonist narrator, telling us of his obsession with collecting, from his father’s finger nail clippings, drinking straws given to him by an unfaithful wife, rubber bands and paper clips from his desk job at a juice factory, to collecting courses for managing possible staff crises?\n\nYou are hooked from the first page, here are the opening two paragraphs:\n\nI’m the best Auctioneer in the world, but no one knows it because I’m a discreet sort of man. My name is Gustavo Sánchez Sánchez, though people call me Highway, I believe with affection. I can imitate Janis Joplin after two rums. I can interpret Chinese fortune cookies. I can stand an egg upright on a table, the way Christopher Columbus did in the famous anecdote. I know how to count to eight in Japanese: ichi, ni, san, shi, go, roku, shichi, hachi. I can float on my back.\n\nThis is the story of my teeth, and my treatise on collectibles and the variable value of objects. As any other story, this one begins with the Beginning; and then comes the Middle, and then the End. The rest, as a friend of mine always says, is literature: hyperbolics, parabolics, circulars, allegorics, and elliptics. I don’t know what comes after that. Possibly ignominy, death, and, finally, post-mortem fame. At that point it will no longer be my place to say anything in the first person. I will be a dead man, a happy, enviable man.\n\nOur narrator becomes an auctioneer and learns that “there are four types of auctions: circular, elliptical, parabolic and hyperbolic.” These names become the names of the books in our novel, along with “The Story (Beginning, Middle End)”, “The Allegorics”, see literature construction above, and “The Chronologic”, which is actually a section added by the translator, in the theme of being a truly collaborative piece, with a timeline of Gustavo Sánchez Sánchez’s life aligned to significant (?) literary and art events (for example, 2004 – Posthumous publication of Uruguayan author Mario Levrero’s La novela luminoso, which includes a 450-pahe prologue recounting how the writer spent the grant awarded to him by the Guggenheim Foundation. Or March 2012 – New York-based artist Ugo Rondinone curates an exhibition that includes Hans Schärer’s Madonna, in which the teeth are replaced by yellowing pebbles.) For the real literature nuts – Mario Levrero’s novel has not been translated into English, but it is referenced in Andrés Neuman’s “Talking To Oursleves”.\n\nEach “book” within the novel opens with a fortune cookie quote and a circular conundrum of an epigraph, adding to the many layers contained here.\n\nFor sheer reading joy the work is absolutely peppered with quotable gems;\n\nIt’s a mystery why all female Mediterranean bodies look like eggplants after the age of fifty.\n\nThat’s politicians for you, clergy included: their heads are so full of themselves that they aren’t the least bit curious about other people’s lives.\n\nI’ve got an unparalleled talent for resignation, like all Catholic men.\n\nFind photos of all the writers you respect, and you’ll see that their teeth remain a permanently occult mystery. This is in reference to respected writer’s never showing their teeth (noting Luiselli’s photo on the back inner sleeve shows no teeth)\n\nThis is a novel that references numerous writers, numerous artists, well read, or art fans will find many sections they can revel in;\n\nWhat auctioneers auction, in the end, are just names of people, and maybe words. All I do is give them new content.\n\nIs that what Luiselli is doing here? With the numerous references, epigraphs about language or words or the nonexistence of language relationships, containing conundrums, the metaphysics of words, is she giving old words and themes “new content”? Is she selling the unsellable? Is this a story that already exists?\n\nA many layered work, a pleasure to read, a celebration of both the art world and the written word, there is no simple way to describe the book, other than to recommend readers of translated books to get a copy and revel in its joy. I do know of a number of fellow bloggers who were less than enthused about this book, maybe comparing it to her “Faces In The Crowd”, but for me, it read easily, it brought a smile to my face, it had enough ambiguity and “puzzles” to keep me thinking, in other words it satiated the main reading pleasures.\n\nWhat could be more poignant than yet another quote from this amazing work? All the parameters we normally use to measure our actions seem trivial.\n\nAs our author said in her own words, this is a “novel-essay” about the production value and meaning in contemporary art and literature. In my opinion, a highly rated and enjoyable novel that I think is in with a fighting chance of collecting the Best Translated Book Award main gong, not having read the full shortlist it could be a bit premature to make that statement but I have it towards the top of the pile from the ones I have read.\n\nLadivine – Marie Ndiaye (translated by Jordan Stump) – Man Booker International Prize 2016\n\nAnd so she said nothing.\n\nReaders of translated fiction would probably have come across Marie NDiaye through her 2009 Prix Goncourt winning work “Three Strong Women, the work also making the shortlist of the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award in 2014 (the Award won by Juan Gabriel Vásquez’s “The Sound of Things Falling – translated by Anne McLean). The English translation of her latest work Ladivine, just being released in the United Kingdom and is scheduled for release in the United States next week.\n\nIf you were to read this book looking for a linear narrative, or a simple plot, you would be disappointed, whilst basically we can follow the lives of three women, Ladivine, Clarisse (or Malinka) and Ladvine, the work is a lot more complex than what appears on the surface.\n\nIn the opening pages we learn about Clarisse Rivière, who travels incognito to Bordeaux on the first Tuesday of each month to visit her mother Ladivine, but Clarisse isn’t actually Clarisse, she’s Malinka, and she’s ashamed of her past;\n\nWhere Malinka’s mother was born, a place Clarisse Rivière had never gone and never would go – though she had, furtive and uneasy, looked at pictures of it on the Internet – everyone had those same delicate features, harmoniously placed on their faces as if with an eye for coherence, and those same long arms, nearly as slender at the shoulder as at the wrist.\n\nAnd the face that her mother had therefore inherited those traits from a long, extensive ancestry and then passed them on to her daughter (the features, the arms, the slender frame and, thank God, nothing more) once made Clarisse Rivière dizzy with anger, because how could you escape when you were marked in this way, how could you claim not to be what you did not want to be, what you nevertheless had every right not to want to be?\n\nWhilst not explicit, Ladivine is dark skinned and Clarisse light skinned, Malika, becoming Clarisse and attempting to escape her heritage, is this a story of displacement, but one where our protagonist wants to be displaced?\n\nA novel that is rich with emotion, here’s a few words taken from a single page – intelligence, ingenuity, strategy, stubborn, immovable, failure, resolute, evasive, fear, compassion. A roller-coaster of family manipulation, personal highs and lows and confused self-awareness.\n\nAs a reader you move through extremely touching sections, where you feel the daughter’s rejection of her mother, a woman who called her only child “my princess”, a single mother who worked as a servant and cleaner to raise her daughter, and then to be rejected!\n\nA theme that runs throughout is rejection, whether it is of your own family, of your roots, of your culture, of your partner, and this theme isn’t only restricted to Clarisse and her rejection of her mother, she is also hiding behind a façade;\n\nHow she loved her face in the morning, powdered, serious and inanimate!\n\nThat was how Clarisse was meant to be in the eyes in the world, a wonderful girl whose good points were all you ever saw, because there were no bad ones. And how that Clarisse was loved!\n\nHere I’ve really only touched on the opening sections, quite soon thereafter, her daughter has moved out, her husband has left and she cannot share the pain with her mother, as she keeps her mother a secret from her family, she keeps her family, and even her daughter, a secret from her mother. She cannot share her pain, and conversely she could not share the joy of having a daughter.\n\nHer daughter Ladivine, who telephoned often, and her co-workers at the restaurant, and Richard Rivière himself, who dutifully called once a month and wired her money she never spent, they were all doing their best, discreetly, affectionately, sometimes with openly expressed concern, to rescue her from humiliation.\n\nBut she had never felt any such thing. Nor was she humiliated that people thought her humiliated, only vaguely surprised.\n\nThe novel doesn’t simply cover the mother Ladivine and the daughter Malika/Clarisse, it moves to the story of the daughter/grand-daughter Ladivine, and her relationship with her father and her husband and children. Although the main character women in this novel (the two Ladivine’s and Clarisse) are “storng women” I feel their nonchalant behaviour, accepting manner, working continually to simply fit in makes this novel “Three Benevolent Women” not “Three Strong Women”. The opening quote I used is one that does crop up a few times and it does define these women, they simply say nothing.\n\nLadivine had met him after two aimless years at the University of Bordeaux, which, on a whim and a friend of a friend’s vague promise of lodging, she’d left for Berlin, with no great enthusiasm, under the illusion that time and life would go by more quickly if she moved on, stupidly, because she had no plans, no hopes, because at twenty-one she felt tired and worn, and she saw Marko at the watch counter of the Hermannplatz Karstadt, where he’d recently found work, and realised that a young man like him, with his long hair, his big glasses, his delicate, kindly, clam, endlessly patient face would never feel the need to hurt anyone at all, that there was a kind of glory about him that he didn’t work at and didn’t believe in, that that word would have made him laugh, as he was a practical man, and this serene scepticism was an element of his grace, since he had no knowledge of that grace, since he had no access to it.\n\nAs per usual I would rather not give too much of the plot away here, so I am quite restricted in the amount of information I can share here, doing my best to stay within the boundaries of the book’s blurb and inner sleeve description. Although I will say I was wondering how the novel was going to sustain the story of Ladivine and Malika/Clarisse for 300+ pages when it was moving quite rapidly in the first 100!!!\n\nThis is a novel that has a blend of genres, a melting pot of styles, making it a difficult work to simply categorise, that is not a bad thing, fresh voices and young writers pushing the literary boundaries are more than welcome on my shelves. In fact I’ll review another recent release by a female writer in translation in the next couple of days that very much so pushes the boundaries.\n\nA worthy inclusion on the Man Booker Prize Longlist, in my top few? Probably not, but it is still alive and kicking for the Shadow Jury’s main prize so we will know more in the coming weeks.\n\nMend The Living – Maylis De Kerangal (translated by Jessica Moore) – Man Booker International Prize 2016\n\nToday you’re going to come across something that happens very infrequently on this blog, a review of a book that I struggled to finish. Occasionally I come across a book I don’t like and more often than not I simply don’t review it. There are a number of reasons for this approach;\n\nA writer has spent a significant amount of their life on bringing this work into being,\n\nFor the majority of books I read there is also the translator’s efforts to be taken into account, like the author they have dedicated a substantial amount of their time bringing this work to an English speaking audience,\n\nWho am I to judge the relative merits of a book? What I may despise others may love! I’m a casual reader, not formally educated in “fine literature”, not officially qualified to be a stick in the mud, why does my opinion even matter? Then again, why would it matter for books I love too?\n\nWhat value is there in caning a book? My insignificant view on the world stage will possibly impact the purchasing power by one or two copies.\n\nAs a Shadow Jury member for the 2016 Man Booker International Prize I am attempting to read and review all thirteen longlisted novels, and if I am being honest there is no way around giving my opinion on each of the books on the list.\n\nOnto Maylis De Kerangal’s “Mend The Living”, a book that, although clunky in language style, actually starts out as an engaging and potentially compelling piece. The story opens with three mates, waking very early, unlike their usual teenage behaviour, so they can fulfil their insatiable surfing addiction. Amongst the three is Simon Limbeau, soon to be deceased.\n\nIt’s time. Beginning of the day when the shapeless takes shape: the elements gather, the sky separates from the sea, the horizon grows clear. The three boys get ready, methodical, following a precise order that is still a ritual: they wax their boards, check the leashes are attached, slip into thermal rash guards before pulling on their suits, contorting themselves in the parking lot – neoprene adheres to the skin, scrapes and even burns it sometimes – choreography of rubber puppets who ask each other for help, requiring that they touch and manipulate each other; and then the surf boots, the hood, the gloves, and they close the van. They walk down toward the ocean, surfboard under one arm, light, cross the beach in long strides, the beach where pebbles crash beneath their feet in an infernal racket, and once they’ve arrived at water’s edge, while everything grows clear before them, the chaos and the party, they each wrap a leash around an ankle, adjust their hoods, reduce the space of bare skin around their necks to nothing by grabbing the cords at their backs and pulling them up to the last notch of the zipper – it’s a matter of ensuring the best possible degree of waterproofness for their teenage-boy skin, skin that’s often studded with acne on the upper back, on the shoulder blades, where Simon Limbeau sports a Maori tattoo as a pauldron – and this movement, arm extended sharply, signifies that the session is starting, let’s go! And maybe now, hearts get worked up, maybe they shake themselves inside thoracic cages, maybe their mass and their volume augment and their kick intensifies, two distinct sequences in one same pulsing, two beats, always the same: terror and desire.\n\nI’m not giving anything away by explaining that Simon dies soon after the novel commences, as a novel exploring the merits, pitfalls of organ transplants would require a character to die in order for their organs to be harvested.\n\nEarly on in the book, the post-accident helplessness, the grief of family members, the detachment of the hospital staff, is wonderfully rich and I was trusting that this theme would continue throughout:\n\nShe heads for the main door that opens slowly, far off; four figures cross the threshold and come toward her, figures that soon emerge from the blur cast by her myopic eyes: it’s the parents of the other two caballeros, Christophe and Johan, the four of them in a line, and again the winter coats that weigh shoulders down, the scarves rolled into neck braces to hold up falling heads, the gloves. They recognise her, slow down, and then one of the men quickens his step to break rank and when he reaches Marianne folds her in his arms, and then the other three hug her in turn. How is she? Chris’s father is the first to speak; the four of them look at her, she’s paralysed. Murmurs: he’s in a coma, we don’t know yet. She shrugs her shoulders and her mouth distorts: and you? the boys? Johan’s mother answers: Chris, fractured left hip and fibula; Johan, both wrists and clavicle fractured, also his ribcage, but none of his organs were pierced – she remains sober, of an outrageous sobriety, meant to show Marianne that the four of them are aware of how lucky they are, of their monster’s ball, because for them, it’s only breakage – their children were wearing seat belts, were protected from the shock, and if this woman minimises their anxiety to this extent, abstaining from any commentary, it’s also to show Marianne that they know about Simon, know that it’s serious, very serious even, a rumour that will have run from the I.CU. to the department of orthopaedic and trauma surgery where their sons are, and that she won’t have the indecency to add anything, and finally, there is this distress she feels, this guilt that holds her back, because the choice was between their two sons, for the seat belt – Chris had to drive, so it could just as easily have been Johan in the middle and then she would be the one in Marianne’s place at this instant, exactly in her place, swaying before the same terrible abyss, disfigured in just the same way, and she’s suddenly dizzy at the thought, her legs go weak and her eyes begin to roll back, and her husband moves closer, feeling her wavering, puts an arm under hers to steady her, and as Marianne sees this woman capsize, she, too, perceives the abyss between them, between herself and the rest of them, this chasm that separates them now, thank you, I have to go, we’ll keep you posted.\n\nWe have the same incident viewed though many lenses, as the characters begin to pile up, we have competing priorities, differing emotional reactions, different time pressures, then the self-interest starts to boil to the surface, as a reader who do we emotionally attach ourselves to? The mother, the father, the nurse, the surgeon….?\n\nSean and Marianne sit side by side on the couch, awkward, curious even though they’re shattered, and, on one of the vermilion chairs Thomas Remige sits down too, with Simon Limbeau’s medical folder in his hands. But even though these three share the same space, participate in the same time period, nothing on this planet could be further apart than these two beings in pain and this young man who sits before them with the goal – yes, the goal – of obtaining their consent to recover their child’s organs. On one side: a man and a woman caught in a wave of shock, at once swept off the ground and crashed down into a dislocated timeline – a continuity that Simon’s death had ruptured, but a continuity that, like a headless duck running in a farmyard, continued on – total madness – a timeline woven of pain, a man and a woman gathering all the sorrow of the world upon their two heads, and on the other side: this young man in a white lab coat – committed and cautious, prepared to conduct the meeting without skipping any steps, but who has set a timer in a corner of his brain, conscious that once brain death occurs, the body deteriorates rapidly, and that this has to be done quickly – caught in the same torsion.\n\nHowever the further we get into the book, the more distracting the clunky language becomes, it is not only the melding of tenses, nor the rambling sentences, or the ridiculous word usage (more on that soon), but to me the never ending introduction of yet another bit player just became ridiculous, and adding some “fat” to their character was totally uncalled for (why have page after page describing France vs Italy in a soccer match? Oh that becomes slightly relevant once a new Italian surgeon is introduced, however Italy has NEVER beaten France 1-0 in Paris, and if you are going to have a fictitious football match then don’t name real players. Why a whole chapter dedicated to the purchase of a goldfinch? Is that just so there can be a corny reference to the rarity of its song? Why an imbalanced fiery actress lover? More pages? Who cares about the hovering nurse’s night before with an oft missing lover? More filler material?)\n\nTo explain the use of language, or more specifically word choice, here is a short quote about a (yet another) bit player who doesn’t not want to have dinner with her daughter:\n\n…or maybe it’s the couple that frightens her, this couple that, in less than two years, has swallowed up her only daughter, disintegrated her into a sure, emollient conjugality, a balm after years of solitary nomadism: her spirited, polyglot daughter has become completely unrecognisable.\n\n?????? And we have 100’s of examples of similar word choices throughout, not at all endearing, nor does this make for an enjoyable read when you need to stop each paragraph and decipher a word or two.\n\nHere’s another example, this time, of unnecessary words, with the page references so you can see how often they are repeated (and I can assure you this is not an isolated example):\n\nP 138 – One liver, two lungs, two kidneys. And a heart.\n\nP 139 – Marthe Carrare enters all the medical data for Simon Limbeau’s heart, lungs, liver and kidneys into a web interface\n\nP 142 – Responses for the liver, the kidney and the lungs come one after the other.\n\nGiven the majority of the story is given over to the “heart” wouldn’t “the other organs” suffice for “the liver, the kidney and the lungs”, given we then have a detailed explanation of who is going to receive each organ, further along page 142?\n\nA book that has an interesting premise, this doesn’t lift beyond a poorly scripted version of an American television drama, with minor, irrelevant characters, clunky language, ridiculous word choices (wait until you get to the technical “harvesting” sections) and non-closure for so many of the “featured” players, this is an absolute mish-mash.\n\nSadly I was intrigued for about 70-80 pages and pushed through the language idiosyncrasies, I shouldn’t have bothered. One that left me completely flat, needless to say it won’t be featuring on my shortlist.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT – The Translator’s Note at the end of the novel, explains De Kerangal’s use of obscure words, she also explains the hidden references in the character’s names or the struggle with French language words having multiple meanings and not as easily translatable into similar English words. Whilst an insight into the struggle of the translator it doesn’t really change my mind as to the struggle I went through to finish this book. For people who have read this book, you may be interested in where I hit the wall, it was once Marthe Carrare the “short woman, around sixty, olive-skinned and round, auburn hair, voluminous breasts and abdomen stuffed inside a tight camel-coloured cardigan, spherical buttocks bobbing in brown wool trousers, and then a pair of rather skinny legs and tiny feet bulging inside flat loafers”, was introduced.\n\nThe Vegetarian – Han Kang (translated by Deborah Smith) – Man Booker International Prize 2016\n\nBy no stretch of the imagination do I purport to have any knowledge of South Korean history or understanding of their current cultural situation.\n\nTherefore a potted history taken from the preface of “Maninbo: Peace & War” by Ko Un may help to put some of the cultural themes to the fore:\n\nIn early 1960 the citizens began to protest, provoked by blatantly falsified election results. On 19 April 1960 thousands of university students and high school students marched on the Blue House, the presidential mansion, demanding new elections and calling for Syngman Rhee’s (a US installed leader in the 1940’s) resignation, the numbers growing to over 100,000. Police opened fire on the protesters, killing approximately 180 and wounding thousands. On 26 April, President Rhee stepped down from power and went into voluntary exile. This series of events is known as the April revolution.\n\nSouth Korea adopted a parliamentary system which considerably weakened the power of the president and so, while Yun Bo-seon was elected president on 13 August 1960, real power was vested in the prime minister. Following months of political instability, on 19 May 1961 Lt General Park Chung-hee launched a cou d’état overthrowing the short lived second Republic of South Korea and replacing it with a military junta and later the autocratic third Republic of South Korea. Almost at once, he authorised the establishment 1961 of the Korean Central intelligence agency. This was the notorious office responsible for the repression of political and social descent throughout his time in power, and beyond. After Yun resigned in 1962, Lt General Park consolidated his power by becoming acting president. In 1963, he was elected president in his own right. In 1971, Park won another close election against his rival, Kim Dae-jung. Shortly after being sworn in, he declared a state of emergency, and in October 1972, Park dissolved the legislature and suspended the 1963 constitution. The so-called Yushin (‘revitalising’) Constitution was approved in heavily rigged plebiscite in November 1972.\n\nMeanwhile, South Korea had begun the process of industrialisation and urbanisation that were to catapult it to its current position in the world. This was done at the expense of many basic human rights, with low wages, absence of trade unions, arbitrary arrests and random killings. Finally, as more and more people taking to the streets to do demand a return to democracy and a liberalisation of society, Park seemed to be preparing a violent crackdown when he was assassinated by Kim Jae-gyu, The head of the Korean Central intelligence agency, on 26 October 1979.\n\nFor a while, it seemed that the dreamed-of restoration of democracy might happen, but on 18 May 1980, General Chun Doo-hwan staged a coup while provoking an uprising in the south-western city of Gwangju which left hundreds dead. All the leading dissidents were thrown into prison and a new dictatorship began.\n\nAfter continuing resistance and sacrifice on the part of many dissidents, climaxing in huge demonstrations in June 1987 which forced the dictatorial regime to accept the Democratic Constitution, Korea was finally able to elect a civilian president in 1992.\n\nIt is against this backdrop of dissent, rebellion and corruption that the themes of “The Vegetarian” become clearer.\n\nBroken into three parts “The Vegetarian” opens with the first person narration by Yeong-hye’s husband, a plain man with no ambitions;\n\nI’ve always inclined towards the middle course in life. At school I chose to boss around those who were two or three years my junior, and with whom I could act the ringleader, rather than take my chances with those my own age, and later I chose which college to apply to based on my chances of obtaining a scholarship large enough for my needs. Ultimately, I settled for a job where I could be provided with a decent monthly salary in return for diligently carrying out my allotted tasks, at a company whose small size meant they would value my unremarkable skills. And so it was only natural that I would marry the most run-of-the-mill woman in the world. As for women who were pretty, intelligent, strikingly sensual, the daughters of rich families – they would only ever have served to disrupt my carefully ordered existence.\n\nHe is married to a plain unremarkable woman, our protagonist, Yeong-hye;\n\nHowever, if there wasn’t any special attraction, nor did any particular drawbacks present themselves, and therefore there was no reason for the two of us not to get married. The passive personality of this woman in whom I could detect neither freshness nor charm, or anything especially refined, suited me down to the ground. There was no need to affect intellectual leanings in order to win her over, or to worry that she might be comparing me to the preening men who pose in fashion catalogues, and she didn’t get worked up if I happened to be late for one of our meetings. The paunch that started to appear in my mid-twenties, my skinny legs and forearms that steadfastly refused to bulk up in spite of my best efforts, the inferiority complex I used to have about the size of my penis – I could rest assured that I wouldn’t have to fret about such things on her account.\n\nThe basic plot of Han Kang’s novel is Yeong-hye’s decision to become vegetarian (vegan in fact as she also avoids, dairy, eggs, wearing leather etc.) and the subsequent consequences. The first section is narrated by Yeong-hye’s husband, the middle section a third person story of Yeong-hye’s brother-in-law’s relationship with her after her vegetarianism and the final section another third person account from the view of Heong-hye’s sister and husband of the artist featured in section two.\n\nLet’s forget the linear plot as the sub-plot is the more interesting account here. This is a novel that explores institutionalisation, in many different forms, what it means to push against the norm, to what extent to we really have “freedom of choice”? The simple act of declaring her vegetarianism leads Yeong-hye to undergo ostracising by numerous peoples, not just her husband and her family, but governmental bodies, health professionals and more.\n\nThis is a novel that raises all the social norms, the familial norms, governmental norms, general rules of society, for example when is it okay to go semi-naked, when is it okay to choose what you eat, when is it okay to have a different appearance?\n\nAs the novel progresses the “kicking against the pricks” crosses into art, nature, sexual mores and begins to question our beliefs of what constitutes beauty, is it in the eye of the beholder? Is it something we have been programmed or influenced to believe?\n\nThe whole situation was undeniably bizarre, yet she displayed an almost total lack of curiosity, and indeed it seemed that this was what enabled her to maintain her composure no matter what she was faced with. She made no move to investigate the unfamiliar space, and showed none of the emotions that one might expect. It seemed enough for her to just deal with whatever it was that came her way, calmly and without fuss. Or perhaps it was simply that things were happening inside her, terrible things, which no one else could even guess at, and thus it was impossible for her to engage with everyday life at the same time. If so, she would naturally have no energy left, not just for curiosity or interest but indeed for any meaningful response to all the humdrum minutiae that went on on the surface. What suggested to him that this might be the case was that, on occasion, her eyes would seem to reflect a kind of violence that could not simply be dismissed as passivity or idiocy or indifference, and which she would appear to be struggling to suppress. Just then she was staring down at her feet, her hand wrapped around the mug, shoulders hunched like a baby chick trying to get warm. And yet she didn’t look at all pitiful sitting there; instead, it made her appear uncommonly hard and self-contained, so much so that anyone watching would feel uneasy, and want to look away.\n\nA novel that questions social norms and raises questions such as, when someone is different why do we see vulnerability? The inner sleeve tells us that Yeong-hye spirals further and further into her fantasies of abandoning her fleshy prison and becoming – impossibly, ecstatically – a tree.”\n\nWhy did you use to bare your breasts to the sunlight, like some kind of mutant animal that had evolved to be able to photosynthesize?\n\nA wonderfully rich, multi layered work, that questions a raft of social issues on many levels. Written in a sparse, almost detached style, the translation is obviously reflective of a deeper South Korean cultural awareness and allows the reader to subtly become haunted by Yeong-hye’s journey from a meat eater to a natural being.\n\nSurely a work that will feature on the upcoming Man Booker International Prize and Best Translated Book Award longlists, and one I expect to go far in both of these awards. A work of rebellion but without the ra-ra of some books, a haunting journey of what it means to resist."
