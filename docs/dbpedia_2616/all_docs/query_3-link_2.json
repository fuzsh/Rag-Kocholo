        "text": "Neil White The newer translation by Tiina Nunally is preferred by most readers, I think - it's quite beautiful and modern sounding, very straightforward and more like Undset's original prose. It reads like 20th century fiction, basically. Some people prefer the older original translation by Charles Archer and J.S. Scott, but it's rather archaic sounding - lots of 'thee's and 'thou's and 'methinks', etc. It was a stylistic choice to reflect the 14th century of the novel, but a lot of people think it's distracting and does a disservice to Undset's prose. I can see why they thought that might be an interesting choice, but I think the Nunally is far superior.\n\nMariaehartman \"There are two translations of Sigrid Undset's remarkable trilogy, Kristin Lavransdatter. That by Archer and Scott came out promptly after the Norwegian originals in the early 1920s. Undset had lived in London, spoke English fluently, and knew the translators. She would have been consulted on fine points. I am told by a native Norwegian that the (mildly) archaic English these translators used nicely echoes effects in the sentences of an authoress who was steeped in Old Norse, and intimately familiar with the old sagas.\"\n\nhttps://www.catholiceducation.org/en/...\n\nIt's well worth reading the full version of the above analysis, favoring the first translation, with some insight into trends in translation. I regularly revisit the original translation in one of the Knopf editions, and this is the edition I choose for gifts. The dialogue is elegant and gentle and honest. You want to be part of a family that speaks so to one another.\n\nJohn Williams I've read both translations, and I must be one of the few who prefer the older one. The translation by Tina Nunally is good, straightforward English. Its big advantage is that includes everything, whereas the Archer/Scott translation edits out quite a lot, mostly the sexually explicit stuff that was perhaps considered a bit too racy for the 1920s. I think this makes the story more complete and coherent in the Nunally translation. What I found a bit jarring was that Nunally is clearly writing to a late 20th century politically correct audience. For example, she has the characters refer to the northern people as Saami rather than Lapp. I doubt whether Erlend Nikulausson would have been so PC. And every time a woman is churched after childbirth there is a little explanation of churching, which Scott and Archer considered unnecessary. So she makes concessions to modern readers that I don't think are consistent with the spirit of the book. (One of the things I love about the book is the way it plunges us into the world and mindset of 14th century Norway, and makes no concessions to modernity.) Some readers think that Archer & Scott's 'cod mediaeval' English is contrived, stilted and unnecessary. I didn't think so; I loved it, and I prefer it to the more straightforward, modern English of Nunally. Of course my opinion is purely subjective as I don't understand Norwegian. I'd love to hear the opinion of anyone who's read both English translations plus the Norwegian original."
