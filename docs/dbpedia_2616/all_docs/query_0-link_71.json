        "text": "Introduction\n\nWritings in Norwegian, Swedish, Danish, Icelandic, and Faeroese are collectively called Scandinavian literature. This literature has existed for more than 1,000 years, beginning with Norwegian writings that very early became part of Icelandic literature. The Icelandic Eddas and sagas became world renowned and are outstanding literary works. Icelandic literature has continued to flourish, but its readers are largely restricted to Scandinavia. Since the early 19th century several Scandinavian authors have won international acclaim.\n\nSweden\n\nPrior to the 19th century the only Swedish writers to have significant impact outside their native land were Carolus Linnaeus and Emanuel Swedenborg, both known for their scientific writings. The modern novel was established in Sweden by Frederika Bremer, author of The Neighbors (1837), The Home (1839), Hertha (1856), and Father and Daughter (1858). August Strindberg, considered by many critics to be Sweden’s finest writer, wrote exceptional realistic plays, beginning with Master Olof (1872). He is considered one of the chief creators of modern drama.\n\nThe first Swedish writer to win a Nobel prize for literature was Selma Lagerlöf, in 1909. Her novels, beginning with Gösta Berlings Saga (1891), reached an international audience. Five Swedish poets have also won the Nobel prize: Verner von Heidenstam, in 1916; Erik Axel Karlfeldt, in 1931; Pär Fabian Lagerkvist, in 1951; Nelly Sachs, in 1966; and Harry Martinson in 1974. The best known of these writers is Lagerkvist, whose works spanned the era from 1916 to after World War II.\n\nThe 20th-century Swedish novel was developed by Gustaf Hellström, Ludvig Nordström, Elin Wägner, and Sigfrid Siwertz prior to World War I. The outstanding novelist of the 1920s was Hjalmar Bergman. A major contributor to the development of the autobiographical novel in the 1930s was Eyvind Johnson, who shared the 1974 Nobel prize. Vilhelm Moberg’s four-part epic The Emigrants (1949–59), about Swedes in America, gained a large readership in the United States. Later novelists include Lars Gustaffson, Per Olof Sundman, Sara Lidman, Sven Lindqvist, and Per Christian Jersild.\n\nNorway\n\nAfter Norway gained its own government in 1814, a new nationalist literature arose under the inspiration of Henrik Wergeland, author of the epic Creation, Humanity, and Messiah (1830). The major 19th-century writers were dramatist Henrik Ibsen and the poet, novelist, and dramatist Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson, the first Scandinavian to win the Nobel prize, in 1903. The leading novelists were Jonas Lie and Alexander Kielland. The late 19th-century writer Arne Garborg was a novelist, poet, and dramatist whose reputation was established with the novel Peasant Students (1883).\n\nIn the 1890s a new generation of young writers began publishing. The 20th-century writers best known outside Norway are the novelists Knut Hamsun and Sigrid Undset. Both won the Nobel prize for literature—Hamsun in 1920 and Undset in 1928. Less known internationally was Kristofer Uppdal, author of a ten-volume epic entitled The Dance Through the Shadow World (1911–24). Johan Bojer, who wrote The Last of the Vikings (1921) and other novels became popular in France.\n\nThere were outstanding lyric poets after 1890, but they were less well known because of the difficulties of translation. Among them were Nils Collett Vogt, Herman Wildenvey, Olaf Bull, Tore Ørjasaeter, Tarjei Vesaas (also a novelist), Olav Aukrust, and Arnulf Øverland. Among the prose writers after World War II were Jens Bjørnboe, Terje Stigen, Odd Bang-Hansen, Johan Borgen, Knut Faldbakken, and Bjørg Vik.\n\nDenmark\n\nThe three 19th-century writers best known outside Denmark are N.F.S. Grundtvig, poet, churchman, hymn writer, and educational pioneer; Søren Kierkegaard, a profound religious and philosophical writer; and Hans Christian Andersen, author of some of the world’s best-known fairy tales. The first modern Danish novel was The Adventures of a Danish Student (1824), by Poul Møller.\n\nThe trend toward realism and naturalism in literature was initiated by the critic Georg Brandes in his book Main Currents in 19th-Century Literature (1872–90). Two writers who were influenced by Brandes’ Modern Awakening movement shared the 1917 Nobel prize—the poet Karl Gjellerup and Henrik Pontoppidan, one of Denmark’s most outstanding novelists. Pontoppidan produced realistic and often unflattering cycles of novels: The Promised Land (1891–95), Lucky Peter (1898–1904), and The Realm of the Dead (1912–16). Another realist, Herman Bang published By the Wayside (1886), Tine (1889), and The White House (1898).\n\nThree woman novelists were prominent prior to World War I: Gyrithe Lemche, Agnes Henningsen, and Karin Michaëlis. No Danish woman novelist is better known, however, than Isak Dinesen, who made her reputation between the world wars. She published Seven Gothic Tales in English in 1934. Her memoir Out of Africa (1937) was made into a motion picture in 1985.\n\nThe best of the 20th-century novelists were Martin Andersen Nexø and Johannes Vilhelm Jensen, a Nobel prizewinner in 1944. Nexø’s best-known novel is the four-volume Pelle the Conqueror (1906–10). Jensen, also a poet and essayist, published the six-volume novel The Long Journey (1908–22). Later Danish novelists include Hans Kirk, Ole Sarvig, Peter Seeberg, Villy Sørensen, Vagn Lundbye, Ole Hyltoft, Ebbe Reich, Martin A. Hansen, and Klaus Rifbjerg.\n\nThe foremost dramatist was Kaj Munk, a clergyman and patriot killed by the Nazis early in 1944. His heroic plays include Herod the King (1928), Cant (1931), The Word (1932), and He Sits at the Melting Pot (1938). His plays have been translated into English.\n\nFaeroe Islands\n\nThe Faeroese language closely resembles Icelandic, but the literature also contains a large number of Danish works. The first 20th-century island writer to gain international fame was Jens H.O. Djurhuus. His Poems (1914) was the first poetry collection to appear in Faeroese. The first modern novel was The Tower of Babel (1909), by Regin Í Li. The chief novelists after 1930 were Jørgen-Frantz Jacobsen and William Heinesen, who wrote in Danish, and Christian Matras, Hein Brú, Martin Joensen, and Jens Pauli Heinesen, who published in Faeroese. Modern poets include Karsten Hoydal, Regin Dal, Steinbjørn B. Jacobsen, and Guri Helmsdal."
