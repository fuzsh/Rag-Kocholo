EMMÃ NEW YORK ALFRED â¢ A â¢ KNOPF 1921 COPYRIGHT, 1921, BY ALFRED A. KNOPF, Inc. PRINTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\n\nPreface to the electronic edition\n\n\"Jenny\" (1911) is the breakthrough novel of Sigrid Undset, 1928 Nobel Prize winner for literature. This English translation was published in New York in 1921, which means it is in the public domain according to U.S. law. We don't know who the translator W. EmmÃ© is. W might stand for William and he might have been born in 1882, but we don't know when the translator died. The author died in 1949, more than 70 years ago, which means her copyright has expired according to the laws of Norway and other European countries. The book was digitized in October 2016 at Duke University Libraries by the Internet Archive, from where the scanned images in January 2020 were copied to Project Runeberg and furnished with a new OCR text.\n\nThis volume was scanned elsewhere and made available by the Internet Archive, from where the scanned images were copied to Project Runeberg. We very much appreciate that they have made this possible and want to encourage other digital library projects to follow their example.
