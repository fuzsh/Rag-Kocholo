        "text": "My friend Paula gave me an enormous doorstop of a novel with a detail from a medieval painted wooden chest on the cover, because she thought I might like it, and I do. But although the doorstopness of it makes it slow to get through, Kristin Lavransdatter is not a book you have to finish in one go. It is unforgettable, so you can dip in and out without losing the plot.\n\nSo, hands up those who can remember the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature for 1928? That’s right: Sigrid Undset, the third woman winner of the prize, and a Norwegian writing in Norwegian, who has probably remained unknown to most of the Anglophone reading world. She was a well-respected writer all through the 1920s and 1930s in Norway, and escaped to America after the Nazi invasion in 1940, returning after the war, and died in 1949. She was a powerful voice in her twenties for women’s social and sexual emancipation, and her major work is Kristin Lavransdatter, an epic three-volume work about the life of a 14th-century Norwegian woman, from her birth to her death. Liv Ullmann made a film of it in 1995, which does look very Norwegian on IMDB. It was translated into English for the first time in the 1920s, but in a very awkward archaic style. The second translation, by Tiina Nunnally, came out in 1997 in the aforesaid Penguin doorstop edition. When Paula gave it to me, I was more interested in Tiina Nunnally, because she also translated Peter Hoeg’s Miss Smilla’s Feeling for Snow in the 1990s, which I thoroughly enjoyed. She is an impeccable translator who leaves no mark of herself in the work she is transmitting from one language into another.\n\nKristin is the eldest daughter of Lavrans, a landowner of austere beliefs in a strangely contented unhappy marriage. Kristin is betrothed young, doesn’t particularly want to marry, and asks to be sent to the convent in Oslo for a year, to give herself some time for something else to happen in her life. There she meets Erlend, an older nobleman with a bad reputation, who seduces her, and becomes the love of her life, despite her growing awareness, over the years of their forced separation, marriage, and family trials, that he is volatile, easily led, and not wholly to be relied upon. Kristin was a dutiful child who loved her father more than her tormented mother; a naïve girl who didn’t understand that her foster brother Arne was in love with her when he went away to war; and a very heedless and ignorant little madam for continually taking appalling risks with her own reputation and her family’s honour by meeting Erlend secretly throughout her year at the convent. Love was the making of her, and also her fate. It showed her strength of character and will, when she helped to kill Erlend’s former lover (yes, I said ‘kill’: Norwegian convent girls were kind of tough), and withstand her family’s displeasure for two years while waiting for Erlend to restore his reputation at court before he dared send emissaries to ask Lavrans for her hand. Love also gave her the capability to restore Erlend’s manor and farm that he had let go to waste, to run his household effectively and decently, and withstand yearly pregnancies until, finally, Erlend was sent north by the regent to command Norway’s northern territories. Halfway through the second novel of the trilogy, Kristin is in her mid-twenties, has just had her fourth and fifth children (large twin boys, a birth that nearly killed her), and Erlend and her father are being drawn into Norwegian royal politics that seem to be pushing them apart.\n\nKristin is, obviously, a historical novel. An awful lot of historical fiction can be shallow tosh, hopelessly infected with the social preoccupations and times of its author. Undset makes us forget entirely that her novel was written immediately after the First World War, in a time of modernising social ferment and economic trauma. Instead, we are drawn into a world where agonising over sexual sins was a terrifying concern to all. Death came lightly and easily in 14th-century Norway, through disease, accident, childbirth, and no medicine to speak of, and so Christian beliefs were exceedingly important, because of how the priests described the horrors of hell. There is great concern over the wrong kinds of sex in this novel, which determined by the characters’ beliefs about when sex was allowed, was it actually a sin, and the marital status of the participants. The stakes are land inheritance, and personal sin and punishment: rights to personal pleasure and other modern notions are simply not part of the conversation.\n\nThe religious beliefs, devotional rituals and fears of the characters are also powerfully drawn, without the embarrassment of modern piety in medieval clothing. When Undset wrote this novel she was a Lutheran, later converting to Catholicism. Clearly her very strong religious convictions were written into Kristin, and they are totally believable. Kristin faces her fears about death and going to hell for her sins each time she goes into labour, and while some of her sins may not seem very important to us, for her they are overwhelmingly important, and Undset makes us feel this completely.\n\nThe characters are closely detailed, and nuanced; no-one is cardboard, everyone has a story waiting to be told, and characters develop, they don’t just strut in two dimensions. The land and its nature are also lovingly drawn, but it’s drawn for Norwegians. We are expected to know how wolves and outlaws hunt, and to understand the risk Kristin takes in walking for 20 miles alone with her baby to the cathedral as a ritualised penance. Erlend skiis for three days and nights to bring the news of Kristin’s first son to her parents in midwinter, when the snow has been iced over for weeks: maybe Norwegians might think this was an epic journey, or no more than common courtesy. If we don’t understand the context, we have to think harder about the character; again, this is refreshing, and intriguing.\n\nThe mood gets darker across the trilogy. The first book is all young love and delicious risk-taking; the second is about politics and family tragedy; and the third is about death, the endings of their lives, and the endings of their family. The kinship emphasis becomes very strong, since medieval Norwegian knights relied heavily on their connections and cousins to maintain status, get favours from the king, sustain good local relationships with the peasants on their estates. Kristin changes from brave young wife to controlling matriarch, and almost, but not quite, becomes a monstrous old woman. But she manages to evade that fate by slipping away from her son’s wife’s new regime, and walks off to join a convent, just in time to combat the Black Death.\n\nThe things I like best about this epic are the startling differences between medieval Norwegian and English society, and the details of folk tradition. Everyone slept together in large rooms and in large beds, and young lovers had permission to snuggle up on the beds, but on opposite sides of the covers. I don’t remember that happening in The Canterbury Tales. The endless milking and butter-making remind us that even noblemen lived on farms, and a good knight could also be a good farmer. I enjoyed the suspense in family dramas, and the large developing cast of characters. Kristin’s seven sons are a mighty handful to keep track of, as are the women and men of their huge extended families. The patronymical nomenclature makes it very hard to remember who is married to whom, because it’s actually much more important to know who is the child of whom. Now and again we encounter a pagan sniff of pre-Christian belief to to upset the priests, who are the dominant social and political force: they’re more important than the royal family in the lives of the ordinary peasants. Finnish witches have a particularly spiky, untamed feel. But for all the fascinating detail that Undset weaves into the story, her invention didn’t work for me in one important area: I didn’t like the main characters. Kristin herself, and her beloved Erlend, are self-willed, domineering, smug, arrogant, pious, unreliable, controlling, arghh, I could go on. And that’s a bit of a problem for a three-volume novel!\n\nSigrid Undset, Kristin Lavransdatter, Penguin Classics (2005), ISBN-10: 0143039164; ISBN-13: 978-0143039167\n\nKate podcasts weekly about books she likes on Why I Really Like This Book, http://www.reallylikethisbook.com."
