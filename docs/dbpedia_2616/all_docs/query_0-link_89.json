        "text": "Today, my beautiful friends Kim Knowle-Zeller and Erin Strybis have given birth to a book every mother needs. The Beauty of Motherhood: Grace-Filled Devotions For the Early Years is a book of 84 short devotions, each comprised of a Bible verse, a short reflection, a practice to fill your cup, and a prayer.\n\nI’m no longer living in the early years of motherhood. My kids are eleven and eight. There’s not a day that goes by that I look back on those early days and wish for them again. I loved my babies dearly and I’d do it all over again to bring them into my life, but those early years felt damn near impossible. This book is the very book I searched for and could never find.\n\nAll too often devotion books offer hidden judgments or prescriptions. “If you do this, then God will show up.” This book has none of that. It won’t tell you how to parent. It won’t tell you it’s better to to sleep train or co-sleep. It won’t argue that breastfeeding is better than formula. It won’t give you answers for all the questions you have.\n\nInstead, Kim & Erin offer encouragement to see God in the midst of the struggle that comes with motherhood. They lift up the beauty hidden within the mess. From the earliest days of considering pregnancy to the milestone of starting school, this book holds all mothers with tenderness and love. It shares grace with us. It reminds us that we are good enough. That we are the exact mother our child needs.\n\nI am so grateful that my friends have brought it into the world today.\n\nThis book will sit with you in the muck of sleepless nights, of lonely times, of seasons of grief, loss or infertility. This book is more than a book. Its words are a gift from God.\n\nI bought a hard copy of The Long Devotion after a Senior Editor at Literary Mama asked me to write a review. The book sat on my nightstand for months collecting dust. I kept neglecting it because it hit too close to home; the poems and essays stirred up too many emotions I didn’t want to handle. When I finally made it a priority, I read it slowly; just a few chunks at a time. I found myself wanting to savor the words. To sit with them a while; let them change me.\n\nI finished reading it on a rare evening alone. Ironically, I was at the beach, having just journaled about how I should give up writing again, when I read an essay by Molly Spencer. After reading the first line, I found myself nodding vehemently. Spencer writes, “When I was in my late twenties, I made a decision: a decision not to be a writer. … I sensed that an artistic life would be all-consuming and that motherhood would be all-consuming. I didn’t think I could do both, and I chose motherhood.”\n\nI, like Spencer, didn’t believe I could do both. But even as I tried to ignore my identity as a writer, I could feel a deep inner desire for the time and space to write. It was not something I could ignore, no matter how hard I tried.\n\nThe poems and essays in The Long Devotion reminded me that writing isn’t optional; it’s essential. I can’t wait for the perfect time to write. Instead, I have to write when I can. Accept that it will be fragmented, and trust that it will all come together when the time is right. It’s nearly impossible for me to write uninterruptedly in this stage of life. To wait for the right time, though, is to close up an essential part of who I am as a mother writer. Even if it's only a few sentences a day, it’s better than none. And eventually, all those sentences will add up.\n\nThis week, my book review came out in the March/April 2023 issue of Literary Mama. Writing a literary book review felt like an impossible task, but thanks to the encouragement and advice of incredible editors, the final product is a thousand times better than the original. I hope you’ll head over to Literary Mama and read the review, and then find a copy of The Long Devotion: Poets Writing About Motherhood. I’m pretty you’ll like it. And it’s highly possible it will change the way you think about your creative life.\n\nIt’s time for my annual roundup of books! I didn’t read a lot of nonfiction or poetry this year, but I had a fantastic fiction year. I rounded up my top ten, but I’m also including some Honorable Mention, because I don’t want them to go unnoticed. Did you read any of these? What were your favorites from 2022?\n\nMy Favorite Classic\n\nKristin Lavransdatter by Sigrid Undset was the very best book I read this year. I started it at the end of January, with a reading plan that took me through the year. Over 1100 pages, it felt like a beast, but once I started reading I couldn’t put it down. I finished it by the end of March. If you read any book in the new year, I beg you to try this one. It made me think about marriage, motherhood, repentance, and forgiveness. I want to re-read it in 2023.\n\nMy Favorite Novel About Motherhood\n\nLessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus is a close second to Kristin Lavransdatter. I thought it would be a fluffy read when I first heard about it, but it may have been the most thought-provoking book I read all year. The main character, Elizabeth Zott, is a scientist in the 1960s and she finds herself on a cooking show. After reading it, I feel like Elizabeth is a dear friend, and I wish I could invite her over for a playdate.\n\nMy Favorite Book About the Power of Words\n\nThe Dictionary of Lost Words by Pip Williams is another book I want to read over and over again. I knew when I chose it I would be reading a fantastic story of the history behind the Oxford Dictionary. What I didn’t expect was the way it told the story of women during the early 1900s; how often words pertaining to women were intentionally left out of the dictionary. It is a fascinating read.\n\nThe Book that Made Me Most Angry\n\nThe Moor’s Account by Laila Lalami had been on my shelf since it first came out several years ago, but I kept putting it off. I knew it would make me angry and sad. With masterful writing, it tells the account of a person sold into slavery by his family in the 16th century, to an explorer of the new world. It is a piece of history we should all dive a little bit deeper into learning about.\n\nThe Book I Couldn’t Put Down\n\nI chose The Attic Child by Lola Jaye from Book of the Month in September because the title reminded me of Flowers in the Attic by V.C. Andrews, which brought me back to my high school years. The Attic Child has nothing to do with Flowers of the Attic, except that there are children and attics involved. It was heart-wrenching and also so incredibly beautiful.\n\nThe Book Everyone Should Read\n\nTake My Hand by Dolen Perkins-Valdez is another book that had been on my shelf for months, but it took me a while to be ready to think about abortion after the overturning of Roe v. Wade. I wish I could buy a thousand copies of this and hand it out to everyone I know. It raises so many ethical questions about the medical field and government, as well as shining a spotlight on the history of women’s rights and racial equality. It should be required reading everywhere.\n\nMy Favorite Young Adult Novel\n\nFirekeeper’s Daughter by Angeline Boulley taught me so much about holistic medicine, indigenous people, and the discipline it takes to be a runner. I read this at the same time I was reading Braiding Sweetgrass, and they complimented each other so well.\n\nMy Favorite Book About Marriage\n\nJoy in the Morning by Betty Smith was first book I read in 2022 was and it was a terrific way to begin my reading year. [Smith also wrote A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, which I read (and loved) for the first time last year.] Joy in the Morning is an enchanting story about a newlywed couple in the 1920s, the struggles they face, and the way they support each other’s dreams throughout their life together. It’s a fun book and an easy read. I highly recommend it.\n\nMy Favorite Poetry Compilation\n\nI started reading The Long Devotion: Poets Writing Motherhood edited by Emily Perez and Nancy Reddy sometime in April, but it took me until August to really finish reading it. It hit really close to home and stirred up a lot of emotions I didn’t really want to handle this Spring and Summer. But once I finished it, it met me right where I was, in all of my confusion and despair and wonder if I could really mother and homeschool and write all at the same time. I highly recommend it for anyone wondering how to balance mothering and creating. Or really just motherhood in general.\n\nMy Favorite Re-Read\n\nThe Starless Sea by Erin Morgenstern was a reread for me this year and I have to say it blew me away this time around. I missed so much the first time I read it. A fantasy about an other-worldly library and the intersection between story and reality, it’s a book that you really have to savor. This is one of those books I loved for the journey it took me on, with every single page.\n\nHonorable Mention:"
