        "text": "+ Interview with and a review by Joshua Hren.\n\n+ Congratulations to Katy Carl on her about to be published debut novel.\n\n+ Invitation to a Dappled Things/Collegium Institute collaborative online seminar on a new Sigrid Undset translation.\n\n+ Some helpful pre-reading for the seminar.\n\nInterview about How to Read (and Write) Like a Catholic and a review of Missionaries: A Novel\n\nJoshua Hren, who is a former editor of Dappled Things and founder and editor of Wiseblood Books, among many other accomplishments with which most DT readers are familiar, emailed the following links and wrote, “Just in case either of these would be a good fit for your Friday links.”\n\nCan a Novelist \"Create\" a Saint? - Joshua Hren | Catholic Culture Podcast #113: an interview by Thomas V. Mirus at Catholic Culture with Hren about his book How to Read (and Write) Like a Catholic.\n\n‘God, If There Was a God’: Hren reviews Missionaries: A Novel by Phil Klay, in which doubt about the existence of God is vividly portrayed while a possible future conversion is hinted at but—perhaps strategically—not shown.\n\n“As Walker Percy put it, ‘the so-called Catholic or Christian novelist nowadays has to be very indirect, if not downright deceitful, because all he has to do is say one word about salvation or redemption and the jig is up, you know.’”\n\nCongratulations to Katy Carl on her about to be published novel\n\nNovelist Rhonda Ortiz, DT Webmaster, and editor of Chrism Press, writes, “Congratulations to Katy Carl!” and shares this Facebook post from Wiseblood Books. Bernardo Aparicio García, DT founder and editor adds, “Folks, I've already read it and this novel is the real deal. A classic in the making.” If this high praise intrigues you, you can preorder the book here.\n\n“In less than a month Wiseblood will publish As Earth Without Water, by Katy Carl. Dear readers, I hope you'll find that it is, by all counts, one of the very best things we've published!\n\n“Here's the cover, complete with appreciations from Harper's editor Christopher Beha and Jennifer Frey.”—Wiseblood Books\n\nInvitation to a Dappled Things and Collegium Institute Collaborative Seminar\n\nFrom Terrence Sweeney (Theologian-in-Residence at Collegium Institute):\n\n“Dappled Things and Collegium Institute invite you to join us this October for our digital campus seminar Between Two Laws: Sigrid Undset’s Olav Audunssøn: Vows. The publication of volume one last year was a major literary event, as it is the first new English translation of Sigrid Undset’s medieval tetralogy [Ed: whose title was formerly translated as The Master of Hestviken] in a century. In the tradition of Undset’s Kristen Lavransdatter, for which she won the Nobel Prize, Vows is the tumultuous story of love, feud, and commitment in medieval Norway. We will explore the Catholic journeys narrated in this novel as an expression of the division in the human heart between passion and promises and between the law of the world and the law of the Gospel.”\n\nTimes and Dates: 7:00pm–8:30 PM ET on the following Mondays: October 4, 11, 18, and 25.\n\nRegister here. To get a 15% discount, be sure to use our promo code: Dappled2021.\n\n“Our first session will be led by Dr. Laura Michelle Diener, Associate Professor of Ancient and Medieval History and Director of Women’s Studies at Marshall University. She was recommended by Tiina Nunnally, Undset's English translator. Diener is the author of the forthcoming, Seeress of the North: A Biography of Sigrid Undset. She has also studied fine arts and creative writing and has contributed essays to numerous magazines, including Dappled Things!”\n\nTiina Nunnally & the Long-Awaited Debut of Sigrid Undset\n\nKaty Carl: “Good pre-seminar reading for anyone curious about translator Tiina Nunnelly's work with Sigrid Undset's novels and stories.”\n\n“As a translator, Tiina Nunnally has had a long-term relationship with the early 20th-century Norwegian author Sigrid Undset; you may have seen the monster-sized omnibus edition of her translation of Undset’s historical epic Kristin Lavransdatter novels that came out about a decade ago. Around that same time, Nunnally finished a translation of Unset’s first, more contemporary novel, Marta Oulie—but, as she explains, it took her a while to find someone to publish the story of a young woman in Oslo struggling against societal expectations and a confining marriage. As you can see, she was ultimately successful, and here she tells us a bit about why she took such pains to bring this novel to light for English-language readers.\n\nSnoopy Has a Face Off with the Empty Page\n\nSome writers who see this will remember typewriters."
