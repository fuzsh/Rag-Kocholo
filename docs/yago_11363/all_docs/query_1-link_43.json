        "text": "Today is the 28th of December 2020 and I have just watched the 'sequel' to the film Journey to the Center of Earth which had the actor Brendan Fraser but this time it has it is about Dwayne Johnson and Michael Caine who star as the main characters. The film is called Journey 2: The Mysterious Island which is all about a young teenager whose name is Sean Anderson who is the age of 17 and he receives a coded signal from an uncharted island which he suspects was sent by his long-missing grandfather. Along with his stepfather Hank, he sets out in pursuit of finding his grandfather and the Mysterious island to see if it is real or if it is just written in a book that was wrote by Jules Verne and the book is called The Mysterious Island. Along the way of finding his grandfather and the Island he meets a girl whose name is Kailani who is played by the same actresses who is in all of the High School Musical films in those films she played the character Gabriella Montez her name is Vanessa Hudgens. This film that I am writing about has been given four stars which means I liked it because it was not very nice when one of the characters got gigantic bird chasing after him and tried to eat him this happened when they were flying on gigantic bees and I did not like the big bug scenes they were horrible looking. I must try and watch the first film which is called Journey to the Center of the Earth with Brendan Fraser in it because I might have not seen it yet and wrote a review on it. But apart from that scene it was a good film to sit and watch with your family. Thank you for reading my film review on the film called Journey 2: The Mysterious Island. I really hope that film club will get the film called Jungle Cruise that is being made next year which is the year 2021 because it has the actor Dwayne Johnson who is playing the character Frank. Here is a little bit about what the film is going to be based on. It is based on Disneyland's theme park ride where a small riverboat takes a group of travelers through a jungle filled with dangerous animals and reptiles but with a supernatural element to it.\n\nPrint this review"
