        "text": "I really didn't want to ever write about this movie, but damnit, Michael Caine went and got himself cast in it and now I have to write about it! Heat Vision reports that the legendary 77-year-old actor will be starring in the Journey to the Center of the Earth sequel being directed by Brad Peyton (Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore). Caine will be co-starring with Dwayne Johnson and Josh Hutcherson, who is reprising his role from the original. The script for Journey 2: The Mysterious Island, loosely based on Jules Verne's \"The Mysterious Island,\" sees Hutcherson travel to a mythical island to find his missing grandfather (Caine).\n\nApparently his role is not just a cameo either. \"The role will see the actor in action mode, engaging in several chase sequences, including one involving giant bees.\" You know, this news along with Liam Neeson joining Battleship makes me feel like some legendary actors are really scraping the bottom of a barrel with terrible gigs these days, but maybe I'm just being a bit too harsh on these guys (they've got to make a living, right?). Shooting is supposed to start this October in Hawaii and later North Carolina. Beau Flynn and Tripp Vinson of Contrafilm are producing. Warner Bros has scheduled a September 23rd, 2011 release late next year.\n\nI know a lot of people enjoy fun 3D adventures like this, but I personally thought Journey to the Center of the Earth was the absolute bottom-of-the-barrel kind of bullshit 3D movie that should not have even been promoted as a feature film. That kind of insanely gimmicky, poorly produced, 3D adventure is meant to be seen at theme parks and shopping mall carnivals, not in our movie theaters. I stayed as far away from it as I could when it was being released and I'm going to do to the same with the sequel, but because I love Michael Caine so much, I just had to mention this anyway (and voice my opinion about how terrible it all sounds)."
