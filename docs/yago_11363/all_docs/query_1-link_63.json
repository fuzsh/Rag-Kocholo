        "text": "Another week! üôÇ\n\nWelcome to week 9. My next review will be focusing on ‚ÄòJourney to the Mysterious island‚Äò. Enjoy! üôÇ\n\nWhat skills do I want to learn, develop, and enhance?\n\nTHEME/MESSAGE ‚ÄìTo enhance my understanding of underlying messages in film and how these are developed throughout the film.\n\nPLOT ‚ÄìTo develop an understanding of how sequential events in the narrative are significant, as well as how they are used to successfully portray theme/message.\n\nCHARACTERS ‚ÄìTo identify and learn about character archetypes, as well as to gain understanding of how characters develop throughout the film, and how these interact with the theme/message..\n\nVISUAL ‚Äì To develop an understanding of how lighting and cinematography contributes to the theme/message.\n\nSOUND ‚Äì To develop an understanding of how diegetic sound as well as score, narration and sound effects contribute to the theme/message.\n\nWRITTEN REVIEW ‚Äì To enhance my written English skills.\n\nTRAILER\n\nBefore I start the review for this week, I need to note down some discussion points I want to talk about in this film. Here they are:\n\nsequence of events in the movie\n\nmain events\n\nlesson(s) I learn from the movie\n\nnegative (bad) and positive (good)\n\nweaknesses and strengths of the main characters\n\nphysically, mentally, spiritually\n\nperformance, reaction, best actor/actress\n\ngood and bad effects of visual and sound\n\nPLOT\n\nSequence of events\n\nMain events 1: Sean the protagonist tried to solve an equation send from an anonymous person. However, while he frustrated tried to solve the equation send by an anonymous person, Hank his stepfather suddenly walked in his room. He helped Sean solved this equation used his skills in navy. This equation was a directed map to an island called ‚ÄúThe Mysterious Island‚Äù. Therefore, Sean was so excited and he packed all his staff ready to leave the island. He was happy because he will followed the map they discovered with his stepfather. Hank did not want him to go by himself so he decided to accompany his stepson. So, they packed all their staff and left the States to Palau sought to the mysterious island.\n\nMain events 2: Tripped to Palau. They arrived safely in the island of Palau and they have met with someone willing for money. His name was Gabato and he was a pilot with the only shabby helicopter in the island. Gabato has a daughter and her name was Kailani. However, they did not have any other choices but they have to take this offered by rode on the shabby old helicopter. They left Palau and followed the coordinates of the latitude ‚Äì longitude on the map to reach the mysterious island. There was a sudden storm with a tornado hit them so hard. However, Hank and Gobato have the same feeling to go back but, Sean convinced them that the ‚Äòmysterious island‚Äô book said they need to get into the eye of the hurricane to get to the island. Suddenly, BANG! something hit them hard and they woke up in the mysterious island.\n\nMain events 3: They finally reached into The Mysterious Island and they arrived safely with their helicopter in pieces. Kailani and her father wanted to go back to Palau but Hank needed them to follow them and looked for a shelter. They were all surprised when found out that the small animals became large and large animals became small. Well! what was happened?. A huge lizard chased them and attacked them. Luckily, Alexander the hero he is Sean‚Äôs grandfather knocked down the lizard and saved them. They finally meet with the grandfather and he took them to his shelter.\n\nMain events 4: Stand in the middle of Atlantis. Alexander took Sean, Kailani, Hank and Gobato to a place it has been told it was sank. However, Hank realized that the mysterious island will sink in only a couple of days due to tectonic plate shifting. Therefore, the only thing of escaped was to move in a mad rushed for the outer cliffs, for hidden inside an underwater cave. This film showed some clever ideas about the ‚ÄòJourney 2: The Mysterious Island.‚Äù\n\nMain events 5: They took an adventured tried to find the legendary Nautilus, was their only chance to take them back home. This was not an easy adventured for all of them when they have faced lot of hindrances. They got chased by a giant bird where Sean broke his leg. However, Gabato left their camp, so they have to split into two groups. Hank and Sean went together looked for the ship at Nautilus. Alexander and Kailani looked for Gabato and will meet up with Hank and Sean at Nautilus.\n\nMain events 6: Hank and Sean found Nautilus and captain Nemo‚Äôs ship. The sea level has risen, so Hank and Sean dived down the sea and looked for the ship. There it is, they found the ship but they faced problem with the ship tried to power up due for its very old. However, lucky because of the electric eel swam around outside the ship. Therefore, they tried to connect some wire from the eel to the batteries of the ship and it worked. They finally made it on time outside from the island and went back home safely. Also, Gabato used Captain Nemo‚Äôs ship for his tour guide while Kailani in the States. Last but not the least Alexander arrived for Sean birthday with another families adventures planned to the moon.\n\nTHEME(s) / MESSAGE(s)\n\nNever Breaks a Taboo\n\nThere is a taboo that we should just from a promise, if not we would suffer\n\nFor example ‚Äì Sean‚Äôs willingness to solve the equation send from his grandfather, he rather broke the taboo of his grounded much more than his taboo and as a result he found his grandfather\n\n2. Be kind and just to All\n\nIt reminds us that reliable or unreliable, the judge should be fair.\n\nFor example ‚Äì Liz Anderson only punished Sean because she thought that he break in to the satellites in the middle of the night, but she didn‚Äôt find the truth. She also punished Sean for letting the police called in the middle of the night, but at the same time Sean and his stepfather also break the taboo/grounded and went to the island of Palau.\n\nCHARACTER(S)\n\nMain character(s)\n\nSean Anderson was played and voiced by Josh Hutcherson. He is Hank‚Äôs stepson and nephew of Trevor Anderson. He needs to find his missing grandfather on the Mysterious Island. Sean is the main protagonist in this film. Sean‚Äôs father was Max Anderson and he died in lava in the center of the earth, however in reality it was just a dream.\n\nweaknesses and strengths of Sean Anderson\n\nWeaknesses Strengths\n\nNot well behaved person because he talked back to his stepfather and his biological mother which is not a good manner.\n\nTried to break the laws by trying to break into the satellites.\n\nIt seems he looked down on the Palau people as he thought they are not speaks English but Hank told him that English is their official language.\n\nHe easily felt in love to a person he didn‚Äôt know but because of her beauty and gorgeous.\n\nSean‚Äôs another weaknesses when he did not know how to express himself to a girl he like.\n\nHe is really good on trying to break in into a restricted area.\n\nHe has skills on Scientist researched.\n\nHe have guts to go inside the eye of the hurricane in order to take them into the mysterious island\n\nHe was a strong person and not afraid tried to disturb the lizard when attacked Kailani.\n\nHe was a lifesaver when Kailani felt off from the bee while the bird chased them.\n\nSean was having a good memory when he remembered that there was a ship that can took them away from the island which was belonged to Captain Nemo.\n\nJosh Hutcherson was well played the character Sean in this movie. He deserved to be Sean because he was talkative and very active. Josh portrayed here that there is no one can replace him in this movie. His performance and attitudes he put in this character will admire the people who watches this movie. Overall, he admired me and convince me to do a lot of reading and research like what he did.\n\nHank Parsons played and voiced by Dwayne Johnson. He is the stepfather of Sean‚Äôs and a former Navy code breaker. Hank is the second protagonist in this film.\n\nweaknesses and strengths of Hank Parson\n\nWeaknesses Strengths\n\nHe spoiled his stepson by picked him up after he tried to break into the satellites.\n\nTried to be so good to his stepson.\n\nHe was giving up so easily when Alexander led them to the mountain. However, he noticed that there was nothing to take them up to the mountain so he complained.\n\nHank‚Äôs is a caring stepfather and he love Sean so much.\n\nHe applied his skills on navy trying to solve the equation that Sean spend lot of his time on it.\n\nHe knew that the island was about to sink after tasted the salty water at the Atlantis area.\n\nHe was a good singer and he played ukulele.\n\nHank was taking good care of his family.\n\nI don‚Äôt think Dwayne is the right person for this movie. Hank should played by someone voiceless and look humble at all. Hank in this movie is someone small not strong and have muscular. The person supposed to played this character need to show humility and willingness. I wasn‚Äôt admired with Dwayne played this character because he is suitable to play action movies, war but not adventures or explorers. Dwayne was well played in this movie but he was not suitable for this types of genre.\n\nAlexander Anderson was played by Michael Caine, he is Sean‚Äôs grandfather and he is the father for Max and Trevor Anderson.\n\nweaknesses and strengths of Alexander Anderson\n\nWeaknesses Strengths\n\nHe felt in love into Scientist and being an explorer and not priorities his family.\n\nHe underestimated Hank with what he has was important as Hank was noticed that the island was going to sink.\n\nWell navigated person that he arrived safely in the mysterious island.\n\nHe was strong and brave as he saved Hank Sean, Kailani and her father from the huge lizard.\n\nAlexander was a smart person for how he survived by himself in the island.\n\nSean‚Äôs grandfather has a sensed of humor.\n\nAlexander was so smart when discovered the island, so he wrote a letter and send to his grandson. He did not wanted anyone to find out about the island, so he coded the message for his grandson to find out its meaning.\n\nHe can translated the Hindi languages into English.\n\nDon‚Äôt you just sit there! Applaud! I like this character and I admire him. Michael Caine reminded me to be happy and always think postive. Michael deserved to play Alexander character because of his sensed of humor. He was the suitable character for all grandfather in any film. The way he talked, walked and acted was fully drew my attention and focused watched the movie. Every moved showed me are well prepared. He was the only character that drew my attention to watch this movie because of his sense of humor. Well done Michael.\n\nKailani Laguatan played by Vanessa Hudgens. Sean liked her because of she was gorgeous and beautiful. However, he decided to ask her if she will be part of their trip as a tour guide.\n\nweaknesses and strengths of Kailani Laguatan\n\nWeaknesses Strengths\n\nMoney blindfolded her eyes when Hank and Sean tried to negotiated, so she increased the payment for the ride.\n\nShe was really good on tricked when she negotiated with Hank and his stepson of how difficult to take them into the place they want to go by increased the payment for their ride on their helicopter.\n\nShe was brave and strong when she volunteered to looked for the book under the cave to Captain Nemo‚Äôs place.\n\nShe was a loving person. She told her dad that sending to college was not important but as long they are together is the most important one.\n\nVanessa Hudgens played well Kailani‚Äôs part in this movie. She‚Äôs brown and her physical appearance is similar to Polynesian girl. I don‚Äôt have any negative comment about Vanessa. All her acted, performed and dressed are great for me. She do not have any accent to differentiate from the Polynesian people but she revealed her as a true person in real life. However, I may say great job Vanessa you totally rock this character ‚ÄòKailani‚Äô in this film\n\nGabato Laguatan play by Luis Guzman, He was Kailani‚Äôs father, He joined in the father-daughter tour guide team.\n\nweaknesses and strengths of Gabato Laguatan\n\nWeaknesses Strengths\n\nHe was an uneducated person so he felt easily for the money when he heard Hank and Sean‚Äôs conversation in order to sent his daughter to school.\n\nIt seems he used the beauty and gorgeous of his daughter as the method for convincing the tourists to use their service by riding on their helicopter.\n\nHe is so good in warmly welcome the tourists into their little island.\n\nGabato has skills and a pilot on a helicopter.\n\nWell greeting and a good tour guide for tourists.\n\nHe was caring and he needed to educate his daughter in college in order for her to have a good career. For example, he woke up early and left their camp. He was headed to the mountain seek for some gold. However, he found one and he tried dug it out because he wanted his daughter to send to college for a better life.\n\nHe was having a sensed of humor.\n\nA loving father will never let down his daughter. Luis Guzman played Gabato very well. He used his sense of humor in his conversation, acted and his dressed. He never tried something to let Gabato down but he played his all to let everyone knows that he was the right person for this character. The way he dressed exactly portrayed how poor is the Pacific island. He showed the love that an islander has in their life. On the other hand, he was played his best in this movie.\n\nElizabeth also known as Liz Anderson Parsons played by Kristin Davis. She‚Äôs Sean‚Äôs mother.\n\nweaknesses and strengths of Elizabeth\n\nWeaknesses Strengths\n\nI did not come up with any weakness of Elizabeth.\n\nShe was a caring mother. She tried to talk to his son and taught him what to do.\n\nVISUAL/SOUND\n\nPositive effect(s) Negative effect(s)\n\nThe screenplay was excellence.\n\nAs a nonprofessional film reviewed I may say ‚ÄòWell done‚Äô! The CGI set piece of this movie was highly spectacular. There will be no argument about the positive effects both sound and visual which is awesome. On the other hand, I was impressed when they tried to put an advertisement in this movie. For example they have mentioned about the park in Hawaii which that draw the attention of everyone.\n\nUsing of CGI and technology to change the small animals into large and large into small. Well! the questions is how can a human being hold an elephant on his hand. When Hank picked up the elephant like he was holding a tennis ball on his hand it drove me curios. However, this is the best time to apply the effective of used CGI. Well done! 5/5\n\nPeople in this world now a days have a total lack of appreciation of how far special effects have come in the movies. Even bad CGI is better than the special effects in the 60‚Äôs.\n\nI honestly think the CGI was good but that part where Hank tried to get some electric power from the huge eel was not make sensed for me of how can an electric eel survived under water. However, unless if the eel was made of some sort of rubber. The rest I feel only looks like CGI now because we have the newer movies to compare it to. The lighting and effects are perfectly fine.\n\nThe giant lizard, birds, spider looked great indeed, but the way they interact with Hank, Sean, Kailani and Gabato was terrible. No blood, no scratches, no multiple bone fractures where they should have been.\n\nIt‚Äôs vile and disgusting how much filmmakers rely on CGI nowadays. When really, you don‚Äôt need CGI at all to make a good movie. Immersing actors in a CGI world with CGI creatures is not filmmaking in my opinion. Filmmaking in my opinion is when actors are acting and interacting in and with practical environments and physical effects.\n\nOverall, I suggest you all for those who haven‚Äôt watch this movie to watch this movie which is good and not using vulgar languages. You will regret it later if you heard it from any of your friends the varieties and unique of this movie that the director and casts of this movie put in this movie. Do not giving up easily when you read the negative review of other without watching this movie and you won‚Äôt regret it. Sit back, relax and enjoy!\n\nReferences\n\nEbert,. R. (2012).
