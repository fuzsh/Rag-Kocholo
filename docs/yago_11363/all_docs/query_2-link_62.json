        "text": "FILM REVIEWS\n\nMust See Movies\n\nWhenever I’ve spoken to anyone about my cinematic portrayal of recruitment and selection film project, one type of question keeps raising its head: What are the best, greatest, or most enjoyable films I’ve seen? Throughout the project, I have found this question impossible to answer in the singular and instead I’ve responded by talking about how events, moods and emotions influence my choice. I even started using the question myself to teach others about rational decision-making (i.e., the idea that you must know what you are looking for by setting selection criteria, before seeking possible candidates, comparing the candidates to the selection criteria, and choosing the one that satisfies all of the criteria). My criteria for selecting a film as one of the greatest of all time are as follows:\n\nIt must have internal consistency that allows the suspension of disbelief: a coherent, consistent and believable plot, even if the plot is based on fantasy or the surreal.\n\nIt must portray people as complex, multidimensional beings.\n\nIt must be well-scripted, well-acted and beautifully shot.\n\nIt must have a message or purpose that transcends the basic plot.\n\nIt must stand multiple viewings with new ideas or feelings emerging on each viewing.\n\nIt is judged on how well it stands up and excites in the first decade of the twenty-first century.\n\nI must want to watch it again and again and again.\n\nThis is a demanding list of criteria that few films can achieve. However, all of the following satisfy these criteria for me. And as such, they are my greatest films of all time and ones that I recommend without hesitation. They are listed in alphabetical order. I should add that I haven't completed the viewing of the 1000 or so films in my database, so this list is incomplete and will be added to as I see more films.\n\nIf you are interested in reading my weekly film reviews, you will find them available to the public on my Facebook page.\n\nAdventureland (2009, US, Greg Mottola (Director), Anne Carey, Ted Hope and Sidney Kimmel (Producers), 107 mins)\n\nAi no Mukidashi (Love Exposure; 2008, Japanese, Shion Sono (Director), Haruo Umekawa (Producers), 240 mins)\n\nAll the President’s Men (1976, US, Alan J Pakula (Director), William Coblenz (Producer), 138 mins)\n\nAmerican Beauty (1999, US, Sam Mendes (Director), Bruce Cohen and Dan Jinks (Producers), 122 mins)\n\nAmerican Graffiti (1973, US, George Lucas (Director), Francis Ford Coppola (Producer), 108 mins)\n\nAmerican Werewolf in London, An (1981, British, John Landis (Director, Producer), 97 mins)\n\nArgo (2012, US, Ben Affleck (Director, Producer), George Clooney and Grant Heslov (Producers), 120 mins)\n\nArven (Arvet/Inheritance; 2003, Danish/Swedish/Norwegian/British, Per Fly (Director), Ib Tardini (Producer), 110 mins)\n\nAway We Go (2009, US/British, Sam Mendes (Director, Producer), Peter Saraf, Edward Saxon and Marc Turtletaub (Producers), 98 mins)\n\nBabettes Gaestebud (Babette’s Feast; 1987, Danish, Gabriel Axel (Director), Just Betzer and Bo Christensen (Producers), 103 mins)\n\nBakushŭ (Early Summer; 1951, Japanese, Yasujiro Ozu (Director), Takeshi Yamamoto (Producer), 135 mins, B&W)\n\nBattaglia di Algeri, La (The Battle of Algiers; 1965, Algerian/Italian, Gillo Pontecorvo (Director), Antonio Musu and Yacef Saadi (Producers), 135 mins, B&W)\n\nBefore the Devil Knows You’re Dead (2007, US, Sidney Lumet (Director), Michael Cerenzie, William S.

Here is a list of films that you should avoid at all costs. To my eyes, these are so irredeemably bad that you should make strenuous efforts to dodge them. No matter what anyone tells you, do not waste one moment of your life watching these films. Some of these are just poorly made (e.g. The Godfather Part III; Prêt-a-Porter), others are vacuous and immensely dull (e.g. The Interpreter; Bad Education), others maybe landmark films but are unwatchable (Last Year in Marienbad) and others are so revolting in their sentiment or treatment of the subject that they are completely objectionable (e.g. The Birth of a Nation; The Iron Lady, Modern Times; Star Wars Episode 1, The Phantom Menace). To my eyes, these are films with no redeeming features (not even by a parade of naked supermodels as in Prêt-a-Porter).\n\nAlexander (Director’s Cut) (2004, German/French/British/Dutch/Italian, Oliver Stone (Director), Thomas Schühly, Jon Kilik, Iain Smith and Moritz Borman (Producers), 160 mins)\n\nAlice in Wonderland 2D/3D (2010, US, Tim Burton (Director, Producer), Joe Roth, Jennifer Todd, Suzanne Todd and Richard D.
