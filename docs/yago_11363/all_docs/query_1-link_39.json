        "text": "This film has a dash of “Pirates of the Caribbean” in it here, and “Lord of the Rings”in it there. It has pirates, giant spiders, duels, a group stranded on a mysterious island along with the famous Captain Nemo, and themes of betrayal and loyalty. Some of the group wind up as a meal for such creatures as a giant praying mantis.\n\nThe film has some intense and frightening moments which would be a bit much for children under the age of twelve. However, the story of good triumphing and strong friendships and sacrifice make it worth viewing. We gladly award our Dove “Family-Approved” Seal to this movie."
