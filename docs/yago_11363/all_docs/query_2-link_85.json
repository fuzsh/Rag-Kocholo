The film stars Jane Bryan, Charley Grapewin, Henry O'Neill, Johnny Russell, Elisabeth Risdon and James McCallion. The film was released by Warner Bros. on June 3, 1939.[1][2]\n\nPlot[]\n\nIn the late 1930s, whistleblower, Stuart McCrary, and his wife, Mary, are killed by Nick Bartel and other henchmen of the town's corrupt mayor to prevent McCrary's upcoming grand jury testimony. The Carter family, living next door to the McCrarys, witness the murders. After the mayor uses intimidation, threats, assault and, finally, the kidnapping of the Carters' young son, Bill, to keep them from testifying against Bartel, only the boy's grandfather, Ulysses Porterfield, has the courage to testify. The family is placed under police protection before their grand jury appearance. However, Porterfield escapes, rescues Bill, and appears in court as the only cooperating witness, which presumably leads to criminal indictments against Bartel, the mayor and his corrupt organization.\n\nCast[]\n\nJane Bryan as Marge Carter\n\nCharley Grapewin as Ulysses Porterfield\n\nHenry O'Neill as Matthew Carter\n\nJohnny Russell as Ted Carter\n\nElisabeth Risdon as Jessie Carter\n\nJames McCallion as Ralph Carter\n\nDickie Jones as Bill Carter\n\nFrederic Tozere as Stephen Palmer\n\nJohn Gallaudet as Nick Bartel\n\nGrace Stafford as Mary McCrary\n\nReferences[]\n\n[]"
