Although it was not part of the series, the 1958 M-G-M film Andy Hardy Comes Home, directed by Howard W. Koch, also featured Rooney, as well as two other cast members, Cecilia Parker and Sara Haden, who reprised their earlier roles. Contemporary sources in the 1930s called the films \"The Hardy Family\" series, but most later sources refer to it as the \"Andy Hardy\" series, due to the increasing emphasis on \"Andy\" and the popularity of Mickey Rooney, who was the number one box office star from 1938 through 1941, and remained in the \"top ten\" in 1942 and 1943.\n\nBeginning with You're Only Young Once, Lewis Stone replaced Lionel Barrymore as \"Judge James K. Hardy,\" Fay Holden replaced Spring Byington as \"Emily Hardy\" and Ann Rutherford replaced Margaret Marquis as \"Andy's\" girl friend, \"Polly Benedict.\" Betty Ross Clarke replaced Sara Haden as \"Aunt Milly\" in two of the 1938 films in the series, Judge Hardy's Children and Love Finds Andy Hardy. The characters \"Joan Hardy Martin\" and \"Bill Martin\" were not in any of the Hardy Family films after A Family Affair; however, a number of recurring characters were featured in subsequent films, many of which were written by Van Riper and directed by Seitz. Several \"friends,\" \"neighbors\" other residents of the fictitious town of \"Carvel\" were portrayed by the same actors in most of the pictures in the series.\n\nThe principal sets and streets of the town were used in all the films, which usually combined comedy with light drama, and as the series progressed musical numbers were occasionally featured. Topical social issues were combined with domestic situations, and solutions to various problems were usually found by the firm, but kind \"Judge Hardy,\" whose relationship with his adolescent son \"Andy\" was the cornerstone of the series.\n\nJudy Garland first joined the series as \"Betsy Booth\" in the fourth film, Love Finds Andy Hardy. \"Betsy\" was the granddaughter of the Hardys' next-door-neighbors, and had a \"crush\" on \"Andy\" which was usually returned with brotherly affection. The popularity of Garland and Rooney led to their appearance in several M-G-M musicals of the late 1930s and early 1940s. The popularity of the Hardy Family series led to a radio program in 1949 that starred Stone, Rooney, Holden and Garland from the films, along with Richard Crenna, who took over the role of \"Andy's\" pal \"Beezy,\" that was played by actor George Breakston in several of the pictures. M-G-M was awarded a special Academy Award on 4 Mar 1943, \"for it's achievement in representing the American Way of Life in the production of the 'Andy Hardy' series of films.\" According to many modern sources, the series was the most popular of its era.

Marion's new boyfriend, Wayne Trent, whom she met on the train home, is an engineer who has come to town to work on the new acqueduct, and her father's position on the matter worries her. That evening, Joan confesses to her father that she has separated from Bill and is very unhappy. After telling him that she and Bill have been friendly with a \"fast crowd,\" she reveals that she went to a roadhouse with another man and was seen by Bill. Even though her evening was innocent, Bill became furious and he will not listen to her side of the story. The next day, the headline of the Carvel Star reads, \"Citizen's Committee Moves to Impeach Judge Hardy,\" and the paper is posted on public bulletin boards. Angry, Judge Hardy wants to bring contempt of court proceedings against the Star and Redmond. J. Carroll Nichols, the man who asked for the restraining order in the first place, wants to drop the suit to project the judge, but Judge Hardy refuses to give up. Soon the entire town is against the judge because they are afraid that the extra jobs and money promised by Wells will be lost. Polly refuses to speak to Andy because her father opposes the judge, and even Marion and Wayne argue because they cannot marry if Wayne doesn't get the acqueduct job. At a political convention called to determine the judge's fate, Bill shows up and says that the item in the newspaper was untrue and if the paper prints the false story that he and Joan are going to be divorced, he will sue The Star for libel. As people begin to suspect Redmond's motives, Judge Hardy reads \"the fine print\" on the acqueduct's diverting of the river waters and reveals that Wells had planned to impound the land adjacent to the Carvel River, thus ruining many of the townspeople. Realizing that the judge has saved the town, the crowd cheers him as he permanently rules against the acqueduct. Judge and Mrs. Hardy and their two daughters are now happy, and so is Andy when Polly apologizes to him and gives him a kiss.\n\nLess"
