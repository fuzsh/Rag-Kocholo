        "text": "Journey 2: The Mysterious Island\n\nThis topic contains:\n\noverall comments and recommendations\n\ndetails of classification and consumer advice lines for Journey 2: The Mysterious Island\n\na review of Journey 2: The Mysterious Island completed by the Australian Council on Children and the Media (ACCM) on 6 February 2012.\n\nOverall comments and recommendations\n\nAbout the movie\n\nThis section contains details about the movie, including its classification by the Australian Government Classification Board and the associated consumer advice lines. Other classification advice (OC) is provided where the Australian film classification is not available.\n\nACCM review\n\nThis review of the movie contains the following information:\n\na synopsis of the story\n\nthemes\n\nuse of violence\n\nmaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nproduct placement\n\nsexual references\n\nnudity and sexual activity\n\nuse of substances\n\ncoarse language\n\nthe movie’s message\n\nA synopsis of the story\n\nThis sequel to Journey to the Centre of the Earth begins with Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson) being arrested by police after breaking into a satellite installation in a bid to boost an encrypted message he received from an unknown source. In an effort to bond with his new stepson, ex navy decoding expert Hank Parsons (Dwayne Johnson) decodes the cryptic message for Sean, and we learn that the message is from Sean’s grandfather Alexander Anderson (Michael Cain). Apparently Sean’s grandfather has discovered the location of Jules Verne’s legendary Mysterious Island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Hank agrees to take Sean to the coordinates identified in the coded message and the pair set off for the Pacific.\n\nHank and Sean hire helicopter pilot and tour operator Gabato (Luis Guzman) and his daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) to fly them to the spot identified in the coded message but as they get close to their destination a hurricane forces the helicopter down. The group survive the crash to discover they have landed on Mysterious Island and set off to explore their surroundings. They meet Sean’s grandfather, who has been living on the island for some time but soon discover that the island is sinking and that they have only two days to find a way off.\n\nFamily relationships; Reckless behaviour; People in peril.\n\nThe Mysterious Island contains some action violence with no blood and gore depicted. Examples include:\n\nSean, recklessly riding a trail bike, is chased by several police cars. He rides across a train crossing, narrowly missing a passing train. He rides through residential backyards running over a number of garden ornaments and then up a backyard ramp to land in the middle of a swimming pool.\n\nSean, Hank, Kailani and Gabato run for their lives through the jungle while being chased by a giant lizard. On one occasion the giant lizard narrowly misses seizing Sean in its jaws. The lizard is knocked unconscious just before it manages to eat its prey when two large logs swinging on suspended ropes hit it.\n\nWhile riding on the backs of giant flying bees, Sean and Kailani are chased by two gigantic birds. The birds are trying to eat the bees and at one point we see a slow-motion image of a giant bird narrowly missing Sean’s bee. Sean steers the bees to dodge the giant birds causing Kailani to fall from the back of the bee and disappear into the clouds below. Kailani survives and is uninjured. A short time later Sean is knocked from his bee by low hanging branches and his ankle is dislocated.\n\nHank in an aqualung suit faces a giant electric eel. He throws a spear into the eel’s mouth as it lunges at him.\n\nMaterial that may scare or disturb children\n\nIn addition to the above-mentioned violent scenes, there are some scenes in this movie that could scare or disturb children under the age of eight, including the following:\n\nSean, Hank, Kailani, and Gabato fly though an electrical storm with bolts of lightening striking their helicopter, blowing off the tail section and setting the helicopter on fire. The helicopter spins out of control and is sucked into the vortex of a hurricane, eventually breaking up into a number of pieces and disappearing from sight.\n\nA volcano on the Island erupts, spewing rocks and lava into the air while massive earthquakes cause the Island to break apart. Kailani, Gabato and Alexander stand on a ledge overlooking the ocean and are hurled into the sea\n\nThere are many giant scary creatures, including giant spiders, centipedes, lizards and birds and an extended scene of a giant electric moray eel with a mouth full of sharp needle-like teeth and flashing bolts of electricity.\n\nOne scene depicts the skeletal remains of a man sitting clutching a book. Kailani wrestles the book from the dead man’s hands.\n\nChildren in this age group may also be scared by some of the above-mentioned scenes\n\nChildren in this age group may also be scared by some of the above-mentioned scenes\n\nNothing further noted.\n\nProduct placement\n\nThe following products are displayed or used in this movie:\n\nApple computers and phones\n\nFord cars.\n\nSexual references\n\nThe film contains some low-level sexual references some of which have a comical intent. Examples include:\n\nTo scare off a giant lizard, Sean’s grandfather makes a sound that resembles the lizard’s mating call, then says that they had better go before the lizard has intentions of making Sean her husband.\n\nIn one scene, Hank offers Sean some strategies for attracting Kailani’s attention.\n\nGabato asks Kailani if she likes Sean, to which she replies “It could never happen with him”.\n\nNudity and sexual activity\n\nThe film contains some mild sensuality and brief low-level sexual activity. Examples include:\n\nKailani wears short shorts, tight fitting low cut tops and exposed midriff.\n\nIn one humorous scene, Hank, who has a muscle bound physic, demonstrates a move involving undulating pectoral muscles, designed to attract women.\n\nAfter Sean saves the Kailani’s life, we see Kailani sitting on his lap with her arms around his neck while the pair gaze into each other eyes.\n\nKailani kisses Sean on the lips.\n\nUse of substances\n\nNone noted.\n\nCoarse language\n\nThe film contains some infrequent low-level coarse language that children may imitate. Examples include:\n\n“What the blue heck?”, “freaking gorgeous”, “that’s so sick”.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\nJourney 2: The mysterious island is loosely based on Jules Verne’s classic novel The Mysterious Island and is aimed at teens, with some giant creatures and other scenes too scary for younger children. The film is a fast paced and contains all the elements required for a good adventure film including action, fantasy, romance and humour.\n\nThe main message from this movie is that love, friendship and a caring family are worth more than all the wealth in the world.\n\nValues in this movie that parents may wish to reinforce with their children include family love and sacrifice.\n\nThis movie could also give parents the opportunity to discuss with their children attitudes and behaviours, and their real-life consequences, such as:"
