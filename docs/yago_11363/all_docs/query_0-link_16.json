        "text": "Jules Verne is given a “from the book by” credit here but this supposed adaptation, written and directed by Lucien Hubbard, really has very little to do with his 1874 novel L’Île mystérieuse. It was a troubled production, loved by critics at the time but largely shunned by audiences, causing producers MGM to lose a reported $878,000 and putting Hollywood off large scale, serious science fiction for years to come.\n\nCount Dakkar (Lionel Barrymore, excellent, as always) rules over the kingdom of Hetvia from his base on a volcanic island, a benevolent leader and scientist who has seemingly eliminated the problems of class while working on a revolutionary submarine with his sister Sonia (Jacqueline Gadsden, also very good) and her fiancé, chief engineer Nicolai Roget (Lloyd Hughes). The latter manages a test run just before the island is overrun by the forces of Baron Falon (Montagu Love) who deposes his old friend Dakkar and installs himself as a far less benevolent ruler. After he and Sonia are tortured by The Baron who wants the submarines for himself to use as a means of suppressing the workers, Dakkar manages to escape aboard his submarine pursued by Falon aboard Dakkar’s second ship. their chase takes them to the ocean floor where they are attacked by a sea monster (an alligator with plastic dinosaur fins) and a giant squid and encounter a diminutive race of humanoids. Dakkar, Roget and Sonia then prepare to make a final stand against Falon…\n\nProduction on The Mysterious island had begin in 1926, in the dying years of the sound era, but by the time it was completed and being made ready for release, The Jazz Singer (1927) had happened. Although it featured only a few scenes with a synchronised soundtrack, The Jazz Singer was to revolutionise filmmaking in Hollywood. Sound was the new “big thing” and any prestige product needed to be, at least in part, a “talkie.” Although The Mysterious Island had been completed as a silent epic, the advent of sound meant that new sequences had to be shot, boosting the already considerable budget to somewhere in excess of $1,130,000. Although Hubbard is the only director named on the prints, an uncredited Maurice Tourneur had actually started the film until MGM grew tired of his tardy pace and far too many reshoots and replaced him with an equally uncredited Benjamin Christensen of Häxan (1922) fame. He too proved to be too slow and wasteful of both time and resources so Hubbard, seen as a safe pair of hands at MGM who had him under contract, was drafted in to complete it. Warner Oland had originally played Falon but when the film went back into production to shoot the sound sequences, his Swedish accent was deemed to be an obstacle and all of his scenes – silent or sound – had to be reshot.\n\nIt’s a wonder they ended up with a film at all, and the end result – partly silent with intertitles, partly in sound – has some charms, particularly in the underwater scenes, but overall it’s a disappointment. The special effects are variable but interesting, the sets are impressive and there’s certainly no questioning that Hubbard and MGM set out to make a science fiction thriller of epic proportions. But there are too many drawbacks. The sound sequences have the same problems as most early sound films, with actors remaining largely rooted to the spot so as to stay in range of the microphones hidden around the stage and the cameras have to remain equally immobile to minimise any extraneous noise.\n\nThe pace is also terribly leaden. Compare this to the superior 1916 version of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea which zips along at far more energetic clip. Like the earlier film, The Mysterious Island featured underwater photography from the pioneering George and J. Ernest Williamson who had developed a special diving bell specially for the job in hand and the brothers were brought back for The Mysterious Island, Ernest being promoted to director. This ensures that what’s left of their footage – the various rewrites and reshoots that the film went through meant that the released version was a very different film to that in the script and a lot of their work ended up on the cutting room floor – is spectacular and a highlight of the film. The duck-like diving costumes worn by what looks to have been every actor or restricted height at work in Hollywood at the time are peculiar but appealing and a lot more effective than some of the submarine shots which look like exactly what they are – a model suspended in a fish tank."
