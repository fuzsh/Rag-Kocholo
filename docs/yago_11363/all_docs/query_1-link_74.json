Four years after journeying with his uncle to the center of the earth, Sean Anderson (Josh Hutcherson -- reprising his role) receives a coded distress signal from a place even more incredible and remote: an uncharted island where no island should exist, teeming with strange life forms, mountains of gold, deadly volcanoes and hiding more than one astonishing secret. Despite the protests of his mother (Kristin Davis) and new stepfather (Dwayne Johnson), Sean, now 17, is determined to reach this mysterious island and rescue its lone inhabitant, his long-lost grandfather (Michael Caine), before seismic shockwaves force the island under the sea and bury its treasures forever. With Luis Guzman and Vanessa Hudgens as a father daughter helicopter tour team, a new journey begins in this follow-up to the groundbreaking 3D CGI spectacular that travels in dimensions that can only be seen to be believed!",

        "text": "Journey 2: The Mysterious Island immediately recognizes its audience and, fully accepting its constraints, pleases them with its fabulous drive and its intrinsic linearity. [Full review in Spanish]\n\nJune 22, 2023\n\nThere’s nothing about this family-friendly movie that’s outrageously offensive, but there’s nothing about it that’s particularly interesting, well-executed, or inventively conceived either.\n\nFebruary 22, 2023\n\nA screenplay that never quite clicks on all cylinders. There are too many scenes dealing with relationships that really halt any momentum.\n\nApril 13, 2019\n\nLike its predecessor, Journey 2: The Mysterious Island is a race against time to survive, but the inclusion of new characters adds a little more interest.\n\nSeptember 6, 2017\n\nFor a family, this is an agreeable Saturday outing, largely because director Brad Peyton doesn't set his sight higher than the material actually is.\n\nJune 25, 2017\n\n\"Journey 2: The Mysterious Island\" is light, airy family entertainment that actually ends up being too light and airy.\n\nJune 22, 2017"
