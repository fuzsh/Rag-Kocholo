        "text": "Innocuous time-killing remains the agenda of the sequel to Journey to the Center of the Earth (2008).\n\nJourney 2: The Mysterious Island proves that an entire franchise can be built out of not sucking.\n\nJosh Hutcherson returns as Sean Anderson, who in the first movie found a kingdom far beneath the surface of Earth by treating the Jules Verne novel Journey to the Center of the Earth as a factual guidebook.\n\nThis time, Sean intercepts a radio message that he thinks came from his grandfather Alexander (Michael Caine), who has spent the past two years trying to find Verne’s legendary “Mysterious Island.”\n\nIn the hope that their trek will be a bonding experience, Sean’s stepfather, Hank (Dwayne Johnson), volunteers to accompany the teenager to Palau, where they hire tour guide Gabato (Luis Guzman) and daughter Kailani (Vanessa Hudgens) to take them to the coordinates, even though locals know the area as a place where ships disappear.\n\nDirector Brad Peyton (Cats & Dogs: The Revenge of Kitty Galore) oversees the requisite chase scenes and precipice dangling.\n\nThe special effects, however, vary wildly with their flaws made manifest even more vividly in 3-D.\n\nWhere Peyton really bobbles is in the handling of his actors. Hutcherson’s angry, abandoned teen was the original film’s one element that seemed fresh and real, but here he comes off as generically arrogant. Johnson’s self-satisfied performance indicates he hasn’t gotten pro wrestling out of his system, and what’s supposed to be a comic rivalry with Caine resembles mutual disdain because of the awkwardness of their interplay.\n\nGuzman tries to inject some life into his corny dialogue, and Hudgens is saddled with a thankless role: She’s just the headstrong girl who’s destined to fall in love with the hero strictly because the screenplay says so.\n\nStill, the movie zips by inoffensively, and heaven knows there aren’t enough children’s movies that tacitly encourage reading classic literature, so families could certainly do worse than to sign on for this Journey."
