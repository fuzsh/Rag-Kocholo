        "text": "‘I am about to send my 421st rocket to the moon. This time I won’t miss!’\n\nA grieving young opera singer roams the countryside with his servant after the death of his true love. In a nearby district of the remote Carpathian Mountains, superstitious peasants swap tales of the strange goings-on at a mysterious castle. Long thought abandoned, sinister sounds have been heard and old legends seem to be coming to life. After arriving in the area, the singer comes to believe that his lover is still alive, and imprisoned within the fortress…\n\nComedic Czecholslovakian film from director Oldrich Lipský, based on the 1892 novel by Jules Verne. In many ways a worthy and accomplished project, the film still struggles to overcome the slight nature of its source material, which is a very short work by Verne’s standards. The novel comes to a hurried conclusion after a slow paced beginning, which suggests that the author originally intended it as a much longer work.\n\nThe young Count Teleke (Michal Docolomanský) is devastated when diva Evelyna Steimarová dies in his arms on stage in the final moments of her farewell performance. She had agreed to quit the stage and marry him, creeped out by the silent attentions of the sinister Baron Gore (Milos Kopecký), but the strain of it all has proved too much for her.\n\nHeartbroken, Docolomanský roams the land with servant (Vlastimil Brodský), seeking to escape his sorrows. Meanwhile, a long abandoned castle is showing signs of life and putting the fear of god into the locals. When Docolomanský arrives in the area and discovers that this crumbling pile is the ancestral home of Kopecký, he determines to investigate, planning to wreak revenge on the man he holds responsible for his lover’s death.\n\nThis is rather a strange brew from director Lipský and co-writer (and animator) Jiří Brdečka. There’s a lot to like here, and it wouldn’t surprise me to learn that the film has cult status in some areas. One of the good things is that the screenplay expands on the role of the Baron’s scientific advisor, Orfanik (Rudolf Hrušínský), giving him a much larger and more active role than in the original novel. It’s his inventions that provide the film’s most pleasing aspect; a collection of steampunk contraptions delivered in a tour de force style by designer Jan Zázvorka. Hrušínský also has great fun with his role, providing the film’s greatest share of laughs.\n\nThere’s also a pleasing Don Quixote and Sancho Panza vide to the relationship of blow-hard Docolomanský and the faithful Brodský, the latter underplaying nicely to the former’s extravagant flourishes. Lipsky also knows how to frame a shot, providing some gorgeous compositions that evoke classical paintings.\n\nBut there is a problem. Lipský aims for an absurd, Pythonesque humour and brings it on almost without relief for the film’s entire running time. A lot of the jokes are very broad, juvenile and repetitive and, without the contrast of quieter moments, matters becomes rather wearing fairly quickly. The comedy also lacks the truly surreal quality of the best of this kind of work. Your patience is also likely to be tested if you’re not an opera lover. Docolomanský takes many opportunities to vocalise the story in song, bringing events to a dead stop every time he does. It’s a device that could have been funny once or twice, but it’s over-used.\n\nTechnically it’s very impressive in all departments; the period costumes, the photography by Viktor Růžička and the impressively bombastic score by Luboš Fišer all striking the right notes. But, at times, it seems like a film that’s all dressed up with nowhere to go.\n\nAn unusual fable, visually beautiful on occasion, but saddled with a sense of humour that makes it the very definition of an acquired taste.\n\n‘We may even reopen the lower depths and see the people of the abyss…’\n\nScientist and inventor Count Dahkar works at his island fortress on a new deep sea submarine. Unfortunately, one of his friends is a ruthless politician who sees the invention as the perfect means to take control of the government.\n\nFilming on this high profile, big budget production from MGM began in 1926. It had precious little to do with Jules Verne, with the only similarities to his novel being the presence of a sophisticated submarine and the title. Lionel Barrymore, one of the biggest stars of the era, top lined as the heroic Count and the film was shot in colour, a rare and expensive process at the time. In all aspects, the considerable financial weight of the studio was behind it.\n\nUnfortunately, things went badly wrong toward the end of filming. The blame didn’t rest on original director Lucien Hubbard, or his technical crew. It was outside their control completely. Sound had arrived. Audiences were queueing around the world to see Al Jolson speak in ‘The Jazz Singer’ (1927), and MGM blinked first. Unhappy with the prospects of losing their shirts on a silent picture, they ordered reshoots with sound. The technology was brand new, and there were inevitable delays as the filmmakers struggled to get to grips with it. Then the studio decided that they weren’t happy with the underwater model work and SFX, so they ordered everything redone. The shoot dragged on…and on. Costs spiralled out of control.\n\nEventually, the film crawled out onto screens more than 3 years after filming had begun, an unprecedented length of time for the era when it was made. Studio executives held their breath. And it flopped. Massively. So great was the financial disaster that the major studios stayed away from Science Fiction for years afterwards, believing it to be box office poison.\n\nSo exactly how bad is it? Well, not that bad at all, really. Sure, it’s no classic, but, as early Science Fiction goes it’s fairly decent, and the studio’s decision to retool the SFX was perhaps justifiable, given the more than acceptable results. These include a visit to the ‘depths of the abyss’ where our heroes tangle with an underwater dragon and a strange race of small humanoids. These sequences are the best in the film, and provide a good level of action and entertainment. Back on land, however, things are a little soggier with character interactions completely predictable and the inevitable half-baked romance between the Count’s daughter and the brave, but low born, chief engineer. The villain has designs on her as well, of course.\n\nThe addition of the dialogue sequences into the picture is a little clumsy and it does make for a strange viewing experience today. It would undoubtedly have been better to leave the film completely silent or reshoot it all with sound. But, to be fair to the studio, this piecemeal approach hadn’t harmed the box office of Jolson’s triumph and, with sound pictures still a somewhat unknown quantity, it’s an understandable decision.\n\nFor many years it was thought that only slightly incomplete black and white prints of the film had survived, and indeed that was the version that I saw. However, a colour print surfaced recently in Eastern Europe and it can be hoped that this more accurate vision of the filmmaker’s intentions will be made available for general viewing in the future.\n\nTwelve years had passed since the disastrous M.G.M version…\n\nA group of civil war soldiers escape from a besieged town in a balloon, but a storm blows it out over the ocean and wrecks it on a strange island. The survivors try to adapt to their new surroundings, helped by an unseen presence that seems to have their best interests at heart.\n\nTechnically limited but remarkably faithful take on the Jules Verne novel, most successfully filmed in 1961 with the aid of some giant monster magic by Ray Harryhausen. There are no giant creatures here, of course, but it is notable for having Russian actors playing Americans, and for the fact that it resists the addition of Venusians, refugees from Atlantis, undersea dragons, and all the bizarre elements that other filmmakers have brought to the story over the years.\n\nUnfortunately, without all that, we’re left with a very talky picture indeed, enlivened only by the appearance of pirates and an ape manservant. It’s always a problem when adapting Verne; his novels often being stuffed with facts but rather light on story development. The film was shot on the shores of the Black Sea and the locations do supply visual interest, but with a rather dull bunch of protagonists, this seems a lot longer than the fairly brief 75 minute running time.\n\nPredictably, the most memorable sequences come at the climax of the story with the appearance of the Nautilus and respected Soviet actor Nikolai Komissarov as Nemo. But the most notable name attached to the project is actually composer Nikita Bogoslovsky. This was an early score in an international career that included 8 symphonies, 17 operattas and over 100 other film and theatre credits. Although performances of his works were banned during the Stalin area, in later life he received many prestigious awards from the Soviet State.\n\nThe most unusual presence in the production is black American actor Robert Ross. He had settled in the Soviet Union a couple of decades before, shortly after the people’s revolution. According to available sources, this was his only film role and he worked mostly as an unofficial ambassador for black U.S citizens who wished to relocate in the new Russia. In later years he was a well respected lecturer on American affairs in Moscow.\n\nAs a work of cinema, this is strictly unremarkable material, a flat and uninspired exercise, which should be watched for curiosity value alone. After all, it’s not often that you see Russian actors playing Americans in a story written by a Frenchman.\n\nGeorges Méliès goes back to Jules Verne, five years after his classic trip to the moon.\n\nA young man descends to the sea bed via his submarine, where he has encounters with various strange creatures of the deep…\n\nGeorges Méliès was a Frenchman born into a family of shoemakers, who was bitten by the theatrical bug on a visit to England. He became a stage manager and illusionist, before adapting his talents to the newly born medium of cinema and becoming the pioneer of fantasy and science fiction film. Between 1896 and the beginning of World War One, Méliès turned out over 500 short subjects, mostly on bizarre themes, reaching its zenith with ‘A Trip To The Moon’ (1902). This was a 13 minute adaptation of Jules Verne’s ‘From The Earth To The Moon’ (1865) and featured the rocket hitting the moon in the eye, an image which has since become one of the most famous in all cinema.\n\nIn 1907 when he produced this 17 minute epic, Méliès was still riding the crest of international success. He had invented many early cinematic techniques, including using ‘stop motion’ to create SFX. The story may be apocryphal but allegedly he was filming a street scene when the camera jammed. He got it going again but when he watched the resulting footage, the sudden ‘break’ turned a normal horse and carriage into a hearse. This also points, perhaps a little too conveniently, towards such moments as the sudden ‘appearance’ of Satan in Méliès’ ‘The Haunted Castle’ (1986), often cited as the world’s first horror film.\n\nSadly, only 10 minutes of this film remains, and that in a print so white that a lot of the detail is lost. A young aquanaut descends in his submarine after a send-off featuring some soldiers and a line of dancing girls. Once under the sea, he wanders about without oxygen or a wetsuit and encounters various undersea creatures, such as a giant lobster, and some more dancing girls who emerge from a large sea shell. This is complete fantasy, of course, and at total variance with Verne’s more factual approach to storytelling. But it was the fantastic elements that allowed Méliès to indulge his visual sensibilities and outlandish designs; in short, the signature ‘look’ of all his work.\n\nBut success was not to last for the Frenchman. He signed a financially disastrous business deal with the Pathé Studios in England, just as his films started to go out of fashion. Spending more money on more elaborate productions must have seemed like the solution, but it just increased his financial woes and, just before the outbreak of World War One, he lost control of his studio and film company. In a rage, he burnt most of the negatives of his films, one of the prime reasons why barely 200 of them have survived into the present day.\n\nFor many years, it was generally believed that Méliès had died in absolute poverty; a bitter and broken man. It is true that he sold toys from a booth in the Paris Metro, as depicted in Martin Scorsese’s ‘Hugo’ (2011), but, by the 1920s, there had been a revival of interest in his work, particularly amongst contemporary film directors. A gala evening of his films was held in 1929, which Melies later described as ‘one of the most brilliant moments of my life’. Friendships were fellow directors endured and he became the first curator of what would eventually become the world renowned film archive, the Cinémathèque Française. He died in 1938.\n\nAlthough this film is in too poor a condition to be truly representative of Melies’ best work, it still serves as a reminder of the roots of fantasy and science fiction filmmaking and stands as another testament to the first film director in the moon."
