        "text": "Fiction – paperback; Daunt Books; 157 pages; 2019. Translated from the Italian by D.M. Low.\n\nVoices in the Evening, by Italian writer Natalia Ginzburg (1916-1991), was first published in 1963.\n\nThis edition, reissued by Daunt Books, comes with an introduction by Colm Toibin, who says Ginzburg’s imagination was “irrevocably” marked by Fascism and the Second World War, but when the war was over, she became “interested in more mundane manifestations of conflict”, usually within families.\n\nIn many ways, this novella, which is set in a small Italian village, is like a short-form soap opera with multiple characters at loggerheads with one another, caught up in unsuitable marriages or forbidden love affairs, or unable to resist spreading rumours and speculation about others. There’s a lot of judgment and gossip in these pages; people are unpleasant, unhappy or both; and many are simply resigned to their fate and struggle to reject societal norms.\n\nIn short, it’s a story underpinned by a quiet despair.\n\nElsa’s love affair\n\nThe meandering narrative is anchored by the story of Elsa, a 27-year-old woman who still lives at home with her parents. Her mother frets that Elsa will never marry, unaware that her daughter is in a secret relationship with Tommasino, the son of the wealthy De Francisci family.\n\nThe blurb suggests that this love affair is the central focus of the book, but that is misleading. Yes, Elsa’s love life, told in the first person, is part of the overall story of the fictional village in which Voices in the Evening is set, but there are other characters and narrative threads holding it all together and these are told in the third person.\n\nThere is the story of Old Balotta, for instance, who comments on the lives of the other villagers, often cruelly and mean-spiritedly, and whose five children — Gemmina, Vincenzio, Mario, Raffaella, and Tommasino — provide him with plenty of fodder upon which to gossip and complain. Here’s a good example:\n\nVincenzino returned to La Casetta from the sea quite restored to health. He placed a portrait on the table in his room. It showed a girl standing up, in profile, wearing evening dress with a rope of pearls. She had a long neck, a huge black chignon and a feather boa.\n\n‘My fiancée,’ he said.\n\nBalotta said to his wife, ‘Is he engaged, that clown there?’\n\nHe went to look at the portrait when Vincenzino was out.\n\n‘What a long neck,’ he said.\n\nAnd in the morning when he was hardly awake he said to his wife,\n\n‘That young woman will cover him with horns from his head to his feet and from his feet to his head.’ (page 47)\n\nHe describes his daughter Gemmina as having “no sex appeal” and a “very bad complexion” (page 36), and detests Mario’s wife, stating:\n\n“Did you see how ugly she is? How can Mario go to bed with her?’ (page 57)\n\nUnderstated style\n\nWritten in Ginzburg’s typical understated style, the book explores how people become trapped by circumstance, whether by their own doing, family obligations or lack of social mobility.\n\nIt also delves into the complexities of love and marriage at a time when “marriage is the finest destiny” (page 121) for a woman while also showcasing the compromises, disappointments and misogyny present in many of the romantic entanglements depicted here.\n\nOther themes deftly fleshed out by Ginzburg’s perceptive eye include the oppressive nature of small-town life, the insidious nature of gossip and the way judgements keep people in their place. She is very good at revealing people’s unspoken sorrows and disappointments without necessarily spelling them out.\n\nBut for all the novella’s strengths, I found the piecemeal narrative and the fragmented way in which the characters’ lives are revealed too ephemeral. There wasn’t a strong enough hook, and I came away from Voices in the Evening feeling ambivalent about what I’d just read. None of the characters and their personal dramas, for instance, have lingered in my mind.\n\nI read this book for Women in Translation Month, an annual celebration of women writers who write in languages other than English, started by Meytal Radzinski in 2014. Visit my #womenintranslation tag to read all my previous reviews.\n\nThis is also my 10th book for #20booksofsummer 2024. I purchased it in Melbourne earlier this year.\n\nFiction – paperback; Picador; 224 pages; 1998.\n\nThe Book of Evidence was published in 1989. It is the first book in Irishman John Banville’s Frames Trilogy and it is the novel that first brought him to my attention when I read it more than 30 years ago! It’s fair to say that it is also the novel that turned me into a Banville fan.\n\nMind of a murderer\n\nIn this compelling, densely written story, Banville puts us firmly in the head of Freddie Montgomery, the narcissistic first-person narrator, who murders a young maid at the house from which he attempts to steal a painting.\n\nThe book is Freddie’s confession to the authorities, written before a trial date has been set, and he writes it almost as if he is trying to explain to himself why he committed such a senseless act.\n\nI killed her, I admit it freely. And I know that if I were back there today I would do it again, not because I would want to, but because I would have no choice. […]. Nor can I say I did not mean to kill her — only, I am not clear as to when I began to mean it. I was flustered, impatient, angry, she attacked me, I swiped at her, the swipe became a blow, which became the prelude to a second blow — its apogee, so to speak, or perhaps I mean perigee — and so on. There is no moment in this process of which I can confidently say, there, that is when I decided she should die. Decided? — I do not think it was a matter of deciding. I do not think it was a matter of thinking, even. That fat monster inside me just saw his chance and leaped out, frothing and flailing. He had scores to settle with the world, and she, at that moment, was world enough for him. I could not stop him. Or could I? He is me, after all, and I am he. (page 128)\n\nBefore and after the crime\n\nThe book is divided into two halves; the first covers Freddie’s background, his return to Ireland after a failed venture abroad, and the events leading up to the murder, while the second focuses on his arrest, trial and his personal reflections on the crime and his life.\n\nIt includes what I now come to understand as Banville’s obsession with art and science. Freddie, for instance, “took up the study of science in order to find certainty” (page 17) but he also has an eye for art.\n\nWhen he returns to the family home only to discover that his mother has sold his inheritance — his late father’s collection of paintings — his fury drives him to steal his favourite one back. It is the theft of the 17th-century painting Portrait of a Woman with Gloves which triggers the murder that is central to the story.\n\nThere are other Banville tropes, including his focus on guilt and redemption, men who are outcasts and emotionally distanced from those around them, and the unreliable nature of memory. He also has a thing for islands (Freddie, his wife and child live on a Mediterranean island) and classic cars (Freddie drives a Humber Hawk).\n\nAnd his prose is littered with cultural and artistic references, witty asides, word play and the most exquisite descriptions and similies. There’s not a single lazy sentence in the entire book!\n\nThe tree that I can glimpse from the window of my cell has a drab, dusty look, it will soon begin to turn. It trembles, as if in anticipation, at night I fancy I can hear it rustling excitedly out there in the dark. (page 76)\n\nSecond reading\n\nReading The Book of Evidence for the second time, I was surprised to discover just how little I remembered of the story.\n\nIt was the dark, oppressive mood of it that had stayed with me all these years rather than the detail. I had forgotten how pompous and self-righteous Freddie sounded, feeling wronged despite his wealth and privilege and justifying his actions as beyond his control.\n\nAnd having recently read Mark O’Connell’s A Thread of Violence about Malcolm Macarthur, the real-life murderer who inspired Banville’s novel, it was fascinating to observe the parallels between Macarthur and his fictional counterpart, as well as the changes and omissions Banville made in his story. It certainly made for a richer reading experience.\n\nIf you have not tried Banville before, this is a good one to start with. I read the edition published in the one-volume Frames Trilogy published by Picador in 2001 and look forward to completing the trilogy in the weeks to come.\n\nI read this book as part of A Year With John Banville, which I am co-hosting with Cathy from 746 Books. You are invited to join in using the hashtag #JohnBanville2024. To learn more, including our monthly reading schedule, please visit my John Banville page.\n\nI’m very behind in my John Banville reading (I won’t bore you with my excuses), but I hope to catch up soon!\n\n♥ My scheduled August read is ‘A Death in Summer’, penned under the pseudonym Benjamin Black. I hope to review it by the end of the month. Cathy is also reading it.\n\nThis is also my 9th book for #20booksofsummer 2024. I purchased it at a second hand book sale last year for the princely sum of $4.\n\nFiction – Kindle edition; Europa Editions; 336 pages; 2023.\n\nCatherine Chidgey’s eighth novel, Pet, is about the long-lasting impact that an influential teacher can have on a child and what happens when admiration turns into disillusionment and disenchantment.\n\nNew Zealand setting\n\nSet largely in New Zealand in the 1980s, it’s a restrained (and non-typical) thriller and coming-of-age story that neatly balances character and plot.\n\nIt’s told from the perspective of Justine, a 12-year-old girl who develops a close relationship with her new schoolteacher, the glamourous and beautiful Mrs Price, and becomes her “pet” to the chagrin and jealousy of everyone else.\n\nJustine, whose mother recently died and whose grieving father drinks to cope, seeks a mother figure in Mrs Price, craving her approval and affection.\n\nBut Mrs Price is not all that she seems. She, too, is grieving — her husband and daughter died in a car accident — and she is desperate for companionship, whether that be in the form of the children she invites home to her house or the romantic attachment she later develops with Justine’s father.\n\nStrange behaviour\n\nBut as the reader soon comes to see, Mrs Price is manipulative and cruel, addicted to pills and prepared to do absolutely anything to protect her vices from the threat of exposure.\n\nHer classroom dealings are also dubious. When her students’ personal belongings start to go missing, including Justine’s treasured gift of a souvenir pen from her late mother, Mrs Price deals with the problem by asking her students to write down who they think the thief is on a piece of paper.\n\nWhen the nominated “thief” is named and shamed in class, it legitimises the bullying of that student, who is of Chinese ethnicity and already subject to racism in the schoolyard. The consequences are dire.\n\nDual storylines\n\nThe story employs two time frames 30 years apart so that an adult Justine looks back on her last year of primary school and the terrible events that unfolded over the course of a year. Those memories are triggered by her father’s carer, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Mrs Price.\n\nIt’s written in simple, coolly detached prose but is hugely evocative of a particular time and place. Anyone who went to school in the 1980s will recognise the pop culture references — Mrs Price, for instance, loves to dance to Duran Duran; one of the girls gets a Cabbage Patch doll for her birthday; Justine’s best friend has a collection of scratch ‘n’ sniff stickers that smell like fake berries; Justine and her father love watching The Love Boat on TV — and the petty rivalries and cliques that dominate the schoolyard.\n\nPet also does a wonderful job of exploring the dynamics between Justine and the adults in her life — her father, Mrs Price and Mr and Mrs Fong, her best friend’s parents — reflecting the complexities of different authority figures and the impact they impart on her.\n\nIt’s a super-easy book to read — I whizzed through it in a few sittings — and yet it feels “meaty” in the sense that it covers a lot of themes, including childhood experiences, puberty, racism, bullying and betrayal. The oppressive nature of the Catholic Church and its Pro-life message also gets a drubbing.\n\nI loved its authentic depiction of school life, the period 1980s detail and the slow build-up of suspense to deliver a shock ending I never saw coming!\n\nFor other reviews, see Kate’s at Booksaremyfavouriteandbest and Lisa’s at ANZLitLovers.\n\nThis is my 8th book for #20booksofsummer 2024. I bought it last August based on Lisa’s review, even though I had been eying it up before this. I also read this book to contribute to Lisa’s project A Year of Reading New Zealand Literature 2024, which she is co-hosting with Theresa at TheresaSmithWrites.\n\nYou all heard about The New York Times’ recent 100 Best Books of the 21st Century, right? It was certainly all over Instagram and there was much bemoaning of its heavy American influence. Where were the books from Australia, so many of us wondered!\n\nReadings independent book store in Melbourne decided to conduct its own poll focusing on Australian literature published since 2000 and quizzed members of the Australian literary community — from writers to publishers and its own booksellers — to generate an alternative list.\n\nWhen I saw the top 30 — published in a staged process as Readings counted down to number one ten books at a time over the past week — I was delighted to recognise so many titles and to have read (and reviewed) a great chunk of them.\n\nIt’s an interesting mix of fiction and non-fiction, with a few crime novels thrown in and many bestsellers. But what I really love is its focus on literary fiction and its almost equal gender parity.\n\nHere’s the list in full (hyperlinked titles take you to my review).\n\n* I’ve read the two earlier volumes; this one is lingering in my TBR\n\n** Read and LOVED but never reviewed\n\nGoing by this list, I reckon Australian literature is in good health!\n\nLet me know how many you have read (or want to read) in the comments below. I’d love to hear your thoughts on the titles in the list and what title you would have put at number 1.\n\nFiction – paperback; Affirm Press; 288 pages; 2023.\n\nStorylines by Carrie Cox is a fast-paced, thought-provoking novel that explores beauty, self-esteem and the healing power of storytelling in the age of social media.\n\nThe novel is narrated by Nessa, a nurse at an aged-care facility in suburban Perth. Ten years ago, Nessa was seriously disfigured in a car accident. Every morning, she goes through an elaborate routine to cover her facial scars, but she’s still not comfortable looking in a mirror.\n\nBecause every morning is a rude awakening, even after all this time. I often think about the nurse who removed my bandages after the final operation, when nothing more could be done. She held up a hand mirror to my face and jumped back a little as I exploded into tears. ‘You will come to love your scars,’ she said, all calm and practised and movie-ready. ‘They’re the lines of your story. They are who you are.’ (page 15)\n\nIn her spare time, Nessa also runs “Nevada,” a retreat on a rural property given to her by her terminally ill father, but there’s a part of her that worries the wellness industry, to which she longs to belong, peddles false hope and panders only to beautiful people.\n\nShe knows she has to advertise (on social media) to attract clients, but she doesn’t want to make promises she can’t keep nor to “influence lives or start a movement”. She genuinely just wants to help people escape their everyday lives for a short time:\n\nI just want people to come along to my retreats and have an experience that makes them feel better about themselves, about whatever life is handing them. (page 35)\n\nThe story examines how Nessa reconciles these conflicts in her personal and professional lives.\n\nEngaging and suspenseful\n\nThe engaging first-person narration showcases Nessa’s journey from self-loathing to self-confidence. The author withholds vital information about Nessa’s disfigurement, which creates a nice sense of drama and suspense. (The reader doesn’t find out what happened until about three-quarters of the way through, by which time you are completely hooked by the story.)\n\nThe novel delves into family relationships — between sisters, aunts and nieces, fathers and daughters, and mothers and daughters — highlighting the long-lasting repercussions of traumatic events.\n\nMy only issue with the book is the occasional “info dump” passages about the philosophy of beauty, but this is just me being picky!\n\nI loved its focus on storytelling — the “storylines” of the title — which is fleshed out beautifully through a relationship Nessa develops at work with Hannah, an elderly resident in the nursing home. Their shared ritual of telling stories each morning builds connection, trust and a sense of shared purpose.\n\nOne reason the brain falls in love with a story, it is said, is because the physical act of hearing stories encourages the release of oxytocin — the nice hormone that controls things like empathy and social interaction — and decreases cortisol, the stress hormone. I’m quietly surprised I remember all this. ‘So we naturally become invested in a story,’ I explain to Dad. ‘We care about what happens and it feels good.’ (page 121)\n\nYou could say the same for Storylines: I was invested in it and cared about what happened. It makes for a compelling read.\n\nCarrie Cox is a journalist and writer based in Perth. I read this as part of my ongoing #FocusOnWestAustralianWriters project, which you can find out more about here. You can see all the books I’ve reviewed from this part of the world on my Focus on West Australian writers page.\n\nFiction – paperback; Gallery Books UK; 300 pages; 2022.\n\nUK comedian Bob Mortimer is a favourite of mine. He has a surreal take on the world and a sense of humour that is both absurd and playful.\n\nA former solicitor turned comedian, he is best known for being one half of the comedy double act Vic and Bob (or “Reeves and Mortimer”). They had their own bonkers panel show, Shooting Stars (in the 1990s and early 2000s), and a sitcom, Catterick (in 2004).\n\nSince then, he has branched out without Vic to film multiple series of Mortimer & Whitehouse Gone Fishing, a fishing show that isn’t really about fishing, and made numerous panel appearances on everything from Never Mind the Buzzcocks to Would I Lie to You? More recently, he has taken to social media, where he posts short videos of Train Guy, a commuter speaking to colleagues over Facetime in an annoying voice using non-sensical corporate jargon.\n\nI was delighted when I learned he had turned his hand to fiction, if only to see if he could translate his comedic talent to a long-form story.\n\nHis debut novel, The Satsuma Complex, bears all the hallmarks of what makes him such a brilliant comedian. It’s quirky, laugh-out-loud funny, surreal and absurd in places but shines with humanity and kindness. Bob’s comedy is never cruel, but it’s not straightforward, either.\n\nStory of an unremarkable man\n\nThe tale focuses on Gary Thorn, an unremarkable legal assistant at a solicitors’ firm in south London, who is a little bit lonely. He doesn’t have many friends except for his neighbour, Grace, an older lady whose dog he occasionally walks for her. The high point of his existence is eating pies, getting coffee from the local cafe and watching football on the big-screen TV at the pub.\n\nOne evening, he goes for a pint with Brendan, a private investigator he knows through work. When Brendan has to dash off early, Gary starts a conversation with an attractive dark-haired girl sitting nearby. As their conversation develops, he becomes enamoured enough to think he might have found a potential new girlfriend. But she, too, dashes off unexpectedly, leaving behind a hardcover book titled The Satsuma Complex, which she was reading.\n\nThe next day, Gary is visited by the police, who inform him that Brendan has died under suspicious circumstances and that he was the last person to see him alive.\n\nTherein begins a noirish crime tale that blends an investigation into Brendan’s death with Gary’s own hunt for “Satsuma girl” so he can return her book, ask her out on a date and get her to prove he’s not implicated in Brendan’s murder.\n\nQuirky and surreal\n\nAs a crime novel, the plot is relatively basic and full of the usual tropes of the genre. But you don’t read The Satsuma Complex for the crime; you read it for the quirky details, the lovable characters and the surreal humour.\n\nThe book is full of idiosyncratic details, such as a USB stick in the shape of a corncob upon which the entire mystery depends, recurring interludes featuring a talking squirrel, and a high-jinx escapade involving a bottle of urine masquerading as “herbal tea,” all of which mark the story as distinctively “Bob Mortimer”.\n\nBut for all the laughs, there’s a touch of poignancy and melancholy, too, yet Mortimer somehow gets the balance just right.\n\nThe Satsuma Complex won the 2023 Bollinger Everyman Wodehouse Prize for Comic Fiction. A follow-up novel, The Hotel Avocado, will be published next month.\n\nFinally, I can’t leave without mentioning the endorsements on the back cover of my edition, which are clearly made up and are rather hilarious:\n\n“Rollercoaster is not the word — ‘book’ fits much better”\n\n— Annette Kurtain\n\n“I read it in one outfit”\n\n— Mick Moth\n\nAdded extra\n\nBefore I go, I just wanted to leave you with this clip of Mortimer’s best bits on the panel show Would I Lie to You? He is a very funny man — in all senses of the word!\n\nThis is my seventh book for the #20booksofsummer 2024. I rushed out and bought it from Collins Booksellers in Cottesloe upon release in October 2022. And then it sat there for 18 months unread… until now.\n\nNon-fiction – paperback; Harper Collins; 256 pages; 2024.\n\nJim Moginie (born 1956) is best known as the founding member, guitarist, keyboardist and leading songwriter of Midnight Oil, the seminal Australian rock band, which has sold more than 20 million albums worldwide and provided the soundtrack to my life. (I have seen Midnight Oil live in concert too many times to count.)\n\nMoginie is the quiet, industrious one who, together with fellow guitarist Martin Rotsey, is responsible for giving the band its signature guitar duelling sound.\n\nHis memoir, The Silver River, not only charts his life with Midnight Oil but also explores his quest to find his biological mother, who had given him up for adoption at birth.\n\nI read it in the wake of seeing the documentary Midnight Oil: The Hardest Line at the cinema, and both inform each other to create a fascinating portrait of both the band and the musician.\n\nA reason for writing\n\nIn his acknowledgements, Moginie says he began writing the book in 2010 “as an instructional manual for my children to read, in order to understand their father better”. But I suspect he wrote it so he could better understand himself.\n\nIt’s clear from this memoir (and the powerful lyrics to the dozens of songs he has penned over the past 40 years) that Moginie is a highly creative and self-aware individual. His ability to blend powerful messages — about environmentalism, Indigenous rights and social justice — with compelling music indicates a level of introspection and intellectual engagement that marks him as a deep thinker.\n\nAnd he can write! “I didn’t want to do an autohagiography or a tawdry ‘rock-and-roll-in-the-back-of-the-limo’ reliving of an idealised past,” he states. “I did know I wanted it to be ‘writerly'”(page 287).\n\nHere’s a good example — it’s a long quote, but it’s a brilliantly evocative description of what it was like for Moginie travelling through America with Midnight Oil in a tour bus in 2022 and gives a good indication of his painterly eye:\n\nThe familiar American industrial military complex flashed by, a Home Depot with acres of car park. A yellow school bus sped along an adjacent road, then dropped behind some greenery and vanished. In the distance, Baltimore hove into view, all cranes, derricks and chimneys. Rob, Martin and I had pieced together ‘King of the Mountain’ on a night off here in 1988. A lone hawk hovered and presided over a straight road that looked like an alt-country album cover. A brown-brick church appeared in front of some more greenery. ‘Sponsor-a-Highway,’ a sign pleaded. A mobile phone tower sailed into view like the mainmast of a Spanish galleon. Then a concrete flyover and a turnoff to Maryland 295. A child dangled an empty chip packet from the rear window of a car, watching it billow with air. I spotted an empty electric-car recharge station.\n\nThe next day, we were in the National Mall in Washington when Roe Wade was overturned, upending the right to abortion. Homelessness, a dearth of gun laws, junk food, media misinformation and prescription drugs ruled this place. We were back in the Dark Ages, and I was glad to see the back of America. (page 264)\n\nA memoir in four parts\n\nMoginie tells his story in largely chronological order, dividing it up into four parts that cover his childhood and middle-class upbringing, his music career with Midnight Oil, his discovery of his birth family, and the Midnight Oil reunion and final tour.\n\nI discovered quite a lot of things about Moginie I did not know, including\n\nHis older brother, who is also adopted, is called Kim — so the two siblings are Kim and Jim! (This tickled me because I’m Kim and my partner’s name rhymes with mine)\n\nHe has a degree in architectural acoustics, and one of his first jobs was with the CSIRO.\n\nHis mother told him he was adopted in an odd way, blurting it out on a trip across the Tasman when Moginie was 13.\n\nHe had been mistaken as an Irishman by a chambermaid in Dublin who refused to believe he was Australian — turns out his biological grandparents were both Irish, but he did not know this at the time.\n\nHe is very good friends with Neil Finn (*swoon*), who claimed Moginie had an Irish mentality and, therefore, must be Irish — again, before he discovered his true ancestry.\n\nHe spends a lot of time in Ireland, where he has connected with long-lost family members (the book’s title comes from the name of the river in County Offaly where his relatives reside).\n\nHe has founded several bands and collaborated with everyone from the Warumpi Band to the Australian Chamber Orchestra.\n\nThe high point of his career, he says, was Midnight Oil’s performance at the 2000 Sydney Olympics in which the band wore boiler suits emblazoned with the words “Sorry” on them, a reference to the fact the then prime minister John Howard refused to apologise to Indigenous Australians for past injustices.\n\nCandid and self-effacing\n\nThe book’s tone is genuinely self-effacing, reflective and modest. It’s candid, too, particularly as Moginie grapples with his identity and a need to know where he came from, something he did not pursue until after the death of his adoptive father, a successful businessman who died when he was in his 80s.\n\nThe journey that follows is warm and wonderful — Moginie discovers he has five biological siblings — but it’s heart-rending, too, because his biological father dies within 12 months of their reunion and his biological mother five years later.\n\nI came away from this memoir impressed with Moginie’s resilience and his ability for honest self-reflection. After decades of losing himself in work, using his career as a way to escape reality and the pain of not fully knowing his real truth, there’s a sense that he is now at peace with who he is.\n\nThis melancholic story gave me all the feels. The Silver River isn’t your typical rock bio. It offers a mix of personal revelations, historical context and a deep appreciation for music and activism, and it has me itching to explore more of Moginie’s side and solo projects.\n\nIt’s a must for any Midnight Oil fan.\n\nIf you liked this, you might also like:\n\n‘Beds Are Burning: Midnight Oil: The Journey’ by Mark Dodshon: The story of the band’s rise from the suburbs of Sydney to the world stage, ending with Peter Garret’s decision to call it quits in 2002. A lot has happened since then, including Garret’s stint as a federal Labor MP (2004-2013), the band’s induction into the ARIA Hall of Fame (2006), their reunion and world tour (2016-17), The Marrakata Project (2020), the release of their 13th album Resist (2021) and farewell tour (2022).\n\n‘Big Blue Sky’ by Peter Garrett: Published in 2017, this is an inspiring memoir by Peter Garrett, better known as Midnight Oil frontman, environmental activist and politician. I read it when it first came out but never reviewed it on this blog because I just didn’t know where to start! It’s an amazing book.\n\nThis is my sixth book for the #20booksofsummer 2024 edition. I purchased it from Farrell’s Bookshop in Mornington, Victoria, in the week of its release when I was on holiday earlier this year.\n\nFiction – Kindle edition; Penguin; 279 pages; 2023.\n\nAnd I think of soldiers – uniformed or not. I think of armoured vehicles. Of peacelines. Of barriers. I think of burnt-out cars and firebombs. We regard a memory as a pale re-enactment of a particular moment. I am coming to wonder if, in fact, the opposite is true: that our experiences of events and incidents in the present are scant, without volume, that we merely accumulate them, and it is only later, when they have been released into the landscape of the time, that they can reach fruition. (Location 490)\n\nDarragh McKeon’s Remembrance Sunday won this year’s Kerry Group Irish Novel of the Year award, which is how it came to my attention. I’m glad it did; otherwise, I might have missed reading this deeply affecting tale about a middle-aged man grappling with the trauma of a past he thought he’d put behind him.\n\nWhile it’s a political novel — the story focuses on a real-life IRA bombing — McKeon is careful not to apportion blame but to examine the event from two perspectives. His central character, a 15-year-old boy who survives the attack, is the product of a mixed marriage — his father is a Catholic farmer; his mother belongs to the Church of Ireland — and is reluctant to take sides.\n\nThe book examines heavy topics — political violence, mortality, grief and trauma — but it does it in such a deeply thoughtful and considered way that it feels more philosophical than hard-hitting. I came away from it forever changed.\n\nMan with seizures\n\nThe story is told from the perspective of Simon Hanlon, a 49-year-old Irish architect who lives in New York and has recently walked out on his wife.\n\nWhen we meet him, he’s about to undergo an operation to remove a vital part of his “brain’s memory circuitry, essential for laying down new traces”.\n\nRecently I’ve been overcome by seizures. They happen daily now. Some force, internal or external, overcomes my body and causes me to thrash and flail on the floor. Usually I come to on my back: groggy, disoriented, flushed out, sometimes with blood in my mouth, sometimes with my trousers soaked with urine. My seizures first came upon me when I was fifteen years old, living in Northern Ireland, at the height of the Troubles. (Location 241)\n\nPerhaps because he’s now confronting his own mortality, Simon’s thoughts turn to that fateful day which upended his life and “triggered” his neurological condition:\n\nOn the 8th of November 1987, the IRA exploded a bomb in Enniskillen, my hometown. Twelve people were killed; another sixty-three were badly injured. It was one of the lowest points in the whole sad history of the Troubles. Myself and my father were present. My seizures began soon after. (Location 490)\n\nWe later learn that Simon blames himself for the bombing because he had a chance encounter with the IRA man who committed the atrocity and believes he “could have prevented what happened that day in Enniskillen. I should have told someone” (location 3287).\n\nThe other side of the story\n\nPartway through the novel, Simon puts himself in the shoes of that IRA man and invents a convincing backstory for him. It is that story — of working-class Brendan trying to make a life for himself, his wife and young children — that allows Simon to comprehend what happened and why.\n\nBrendan’s narrative is told dispassionately, which only heightens its emotional power, and it’s hard not to draw comparisons between the two men, separated by nothing more than opportunity (or lack thereof), religion and political beliefs.\n\nHe doesn’t let guilt in, he learned to block it a few years ago. A war has casualties. A war has collateral damage. He didn’t wish for any of this to be brought upon his people. He looks at Malachy and knows, someday, his son will ask him to account for his actions and he believes he’ll do it with pride. He’ll talk about how he defended his people against the occupiers, tell him how a free and fair Ireland was birthed from the pain of others. He’ll explain the word ‘gerrymandering’, tell him his people were once second-class citizens on their own soil. Tell him that nothing comes easy, without sacrifice. (Location 2977)\n\nThat switch in focus, from Simon’s story to Brendan’s, does jar at first, but Brendan’s narrative thread is so rich and intimately told that you soon get swept up in his life and the choices he makes.\n\nYes, it’s wholly imagined — McKeon makes it clear in his afterword that the events he writes about are historical, while the characters come from his imagination — but he paints a convincing portrait of “a polarized time” in Ireland’s recent history, highlighting the human stories behind the Troubles.\n\nRemembrance Sunday explores the legacy of unresolved trauma, memory — both personal and collective — truth and violence. It is a profound, eloquent and compelling read.\n\nFiction – paperback; Giramondo; 160 pages; 2017. Translated from the Spanish by Alice Whitmore.\n\nMariana Dimópulos is an Argentine writer. Her novel All My Goodbyes was first published under the title Cada Despedida in 2010 and was translated from Spanish by Australian translator Alice Whitmore in 2017.\n\nThe story follows a young woman who travels from Argentina to Europe, never quite able to settle down and always moving from (unskilled) job to (unskilled) job, relationship to relationship, country to country.\n\nThe opening paragraph sets the scene:\n\nIt’s the same thing time and time again, shamelessly, tirelessly. It doesn’t matter whether it’s morning or night, winter or summer. Whether the house feels like home, whether somebody comes to the door to let me in. I arrive, and I want to stay, and then I leave. (page 1)\n\nThe narrative, which spans around 10 years, is relayed in an overlapping, circular style, so scenes — including “all my goodbyes” of the title — are repeated over and over, almost as if the protagonist’s life has gotten stuck in a groove or a rut from which she can’t escape.\n\nReading the story is like peeling an onion. As the layers are pared back, more information is revealed that changes the reader’s perception of events and the protagonist who recalls them.\n\nBrutal murders\n\nUnderpinning this is the knowledge, revealed fairly early on in the story, that two people she worked with on a remote Patagonian farm have been murdered, and it’s never quite clear whether she might be a suspect in their deaths.\n\nWhat does become clear — to this reader at least — is that the woman at the heart of the story is deeply troubled, unable to form meaningful connections with people (although she does get married to a man she meets in Germany) and always at pains to keep herself emotionally detached from others and from the places she chooses to live.\n\nShe seems unable to make any kind of decision with which she is happy — “I was wrong: wrong to stay, wrong to leave” (page 20); “It didn’t make sense to get under the covers, it didn’t make sense to sleep without them either” (page 50) — lacks curiosity, is completely indifferent to most things, including what she eats, and seems unable to sit with her own thoughts.\n\nThese were precious minutes of innocuous daydreaming, during which I was safe from the treacherous mud of my own thoughts. […] It was a pleasant pastime. But slowly, the empty side of my head filled back up with volatile and unstable things, like methane gas. This is how it works: a pact is made between ourselves and the world at large, and we step out of it onto the wicked path of introspection. (page 28)\n\nNegative thoughts\n\nHer tale is interlaced with repeated mantras, most of them negative or pessimistic — of “muddy thoughts”, of having a “bad heart”, of wanting to avoid “the rodent wheel of life” — which go round and round her brain.\n\nMy mind spun around and around, for hours and days. How I wished I could dismount from the carousel of my life. (page 121)\n\nIn many ways, those thoughts are echoed in the story’s non-linear structure, and yet, for all the repetition and fragmentary nature of the narrative, I found it strangely compelling — and hypnotic.\n\nAs a tale of disconnection and rootlessness, All My Goodbyes is powerful, but it really comes into its own in its exploration of violence, trauma and a human quest for belonging.\n\nLisa at AnzLitLovers has also reviewed this.\n\nThis is my fifth book for the #20booksofsummer edition. I purchased it directly from the publisher last September as part of a 20% off promotion.\n\nBecause this book was originally published in Spanish, I also read it for Spanish & Portuguese Lit Month 2024, which is organised by Stu, who blogs at Winstonsdad’s Blog.\n\nFiction – Kindle edition; Transworld Digital; 266 pages; 2024.\n\nA word of warning. If you choose to read Lottie Hazell’s debut novel, Piglet, make sure you have eaten beforehand because there are so many lush descriptions of food in it that it will immediately make you hungry.\n\nNo surprises, then, that hunger is at the heart of the story — the hunger to succeed, the hunger to lead the perfect life, the hunger to have it all.\n\nIt is also not surprising that the book originated as the creative component of a PhD in Creative Writing about 21st-century food writing, given that the author really knows her stuff.\n\nThwarted wedding plans\n\nThe story follows Piglet, an assistant cookbook editor, who is engaged to be married. She’s just moved into a new-build house on the outskirts of Oxford with her fiance, Kit, and together, the pair are excitedly counting down to the big day.\n\nBut just two weeks out from the nuptials, Kit confesses a betrayal that throws Piglet’s seemingly well-ordered life into disarray.\n\nThe novel is structured as a countdown leading up to the wedding — which may or may not happen — adding to the suspense.\n\nWill she call the wedding off or keep up appearances and continue as planned? How will she tell her working-class parents that the £3,000 they have forked out for her wedding dress has been a waste of money? And does this mean she’s forever blown her chance to be accepted by the upper middle class to which Kit belongs?\n\nTroubled eating\n\nPiglet is a simple story about a young woman discovering that there’s more to life than external appearances.\n\nBut it’s told cleverly because at no point do we ever find out what the betrayal involved — the reader must come to their own conclusions — nor do we know whether Piglet has an issue with her weight; we just assume she does (the clue, I guess, is in the name).\n\nThere are several scenes where she binges on food (each dish is lavishly described), and it becomes increasingly obvious that her appetite is an outward reflection of a much deeper issue. Yet food offers her both solace and a form of expression, but it’s also used as a crutch to get her through difficult situations.\n\n“At the table, in front of her, the linguine steamed, each strand covered in sauce. She could see flecks of chilli, the edges of garlic, the echo of an anchovy. She lifted her fork. The linguine was salty on her tongue, gratifyingly hot, and pleasurable in its heft as she swallowed.” (page 282)\n\nPiglet explores themes of ambition, personal fulfilment, the pressures of perfection, friendship, family and eating disorders. But it also has a lot to say about class — Piglet is from a working-class family based in Derby; Kit is from the upper middle class — and shame, particularly how we deal with it.\n\nI couldn’t help thinking that it would make a brilliant movie. There’s a nerve-shattering depiction of Piglet baking (and assembling) three classic French croquembouche — dozens of cream-filled choux pastry puffs piled into a cone and bound with threads of caramel or spun sugar — against the clock that is ripe for visual adaptation. Think Bridget Jones’s Diary meets The Great British Bake Off!\n\nDelicious!\n\nThis is my fourth book for the #20booksofsummer 2024 edition. I purchased it when it first came out earlier this year, admittedly sucked in by the gorgeous UK cover (donuts are my weakness) and a strong marketing campaign on social media,"
