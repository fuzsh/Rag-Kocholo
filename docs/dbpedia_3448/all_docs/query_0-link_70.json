        "text": "Touched by an \"A\"-ngel\n\nAria is finding it hard to believe Spencer and Emily's revelation about Jason all the while dealing with her feelings for him. Hanna tries to play nice with her future stepsister. Meanwhile, \"A\" continues to torment Emily trying to push her to a breakdown.\n\nOver My Dead Body\n\nAria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer have made a crucial mistake - they told someone about \"A\" and now they must pay the price. With the clock ticking and \"A\" calling the shots, the girls are sent on missions to do \"A's\" bidding in order to save their trusted confidant. Each mission will ultimately lead to what the four liars want the most, but at a costly price to their loved ones and themselves. Can Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer go through with their given tasks, or will they ignore \"A\" to save those around them from being hurt? And, ultimately, will this matter when all is said and done? Nothing is ever as it seems in Rosewood, PA.\n\nThe Naked Truth\n\nRosewood Highâs \"Truth-Up Day,\" is not just an opportunity for the students of the school to air their grievances and stop bullying, but also a chance for Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer to get answers to some burning questions. Spencer looks to find answers on what is going on between Jason and her father when Jason shows up as a chaperone; Aria continues to question Holden on what exactly he is up to during their \"date nights,\" and Hanna tries to figure out the latest situation with Kate. But will the girls be ready for what they find out when shocking truths are revealed? Meanwhile, Emily gets help from an unlikely source to get back on the Rosewood swim team."
