        "text": "I so randomly found Natalie Barelli‚Äôs The Housekeeper on the library shelf and picked it up without knowing anything about it. That rarely happens to me in the ‚ÄúNew Release‚Äù section of the library! I thought it sounded GREAT so I happily added it to my pile of books and left the library excited to start reading. I couldn‚Äôt wait to read and review this book!\n\nAnd then the world shut down and suddenly I was given plenty of time with my stack of library books üôÇ Having not loved the previous book that I read, I was more than ready to start fresh with a new book!\n\nSynopsis from Goodreads:\n\nWhen Claire sees Hannah Wilson at an exclusive Manhattan hair salon, it‚Äôs like a knife slicing through barely healed scars. It may have been ten years since Claire last saw Hannah, but she has thought of her every day, and not in a good way. So Claire does what anyone would do in her position‚Äîshe stalks her.\n\nHannah is now Mrs. Carter, living the charmed life that should have been Claire‚Äôs. It‚Äôs the life Claire used to have, before Hannah came along and took it all away from her.\n\nBack then, Claire was a happy teenager with porcelain skin and long, wavy blond hair. Now she‚Äôs an overweight, lazy drunk with hair the color of compost and skin to match. Which is why when Hannah advertises for a housekeeper, Claire is confident she can apply and not be recognized. And since she has time on her hands, revenge on her mind, and a talent for acting‚Ä¶\n\nBecause what better way to seek retribution‚Äîand redress‚Äîthan from within the beautiful Mrs. Hannah Carter‚Äôs own home?\n\nExcept that it‚Äôs not just Claire who has secrets. Everyone in that house seems to have something to hide.\n\nAnd now, there‚Äôs no way out.\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\n(Disclaimer: I will never post spoilers in my reviews HOWEVER the comment section is completely fair game to discuss any and all specifics including spoilers)\n\n3.5 Stars\n\nThe Housekeeper was‚Ä¶good! It held my attention from page 1 and I read through the entire book fairly quickly. It had short chapters (MY FAVORITE) and twists (including the ending) which I didn‚Äôt see coming.\n\nHowever, there were definitely elements to this book which left me feeling underwhelmed. I found the writing to be choppy and containing so many details that it was nearly impossible to keep everything straight. It severely lacked character development which again made parts of this story hard to follow.\n\nThe biggest problem that I have with this book was that parts were just so unrealistic. Like‚Ä¶severely unrealistic.\n\nAnd here‚Äôs something which I‚Äôve never seen before. DO NOT READ THE AUTHOR‚ÄôS ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AT THE END OF THE BOOK. She somehow managed to spoil the endings of her other books in this one author‚Äôs note (insert face plant emoji here)??? For someone who HATES SPOILERS, this infuriates me and unfortunately makes me now not want to read anything else she has previously written. Like‚Ä¶HOW did her editor allow that one sentence to go through?!?\n\nBottom Line:\n\nFar from the best psychological thriller I‚Äôve read but also far from the worst.\n\n***If you are looking for some GREAT psychological thrillers (one of my favorite genres), check out THIS POST!***\n\nXo,\n\nJenny\n\nDid you read this book?
