        "text": "Hey everyone! We've raised a big heap of funds so far, and thank you to everyone who has made it possible. But I'm hoping we can raise even more! ***For today only*** all donations to the run are being matched! Make your contributions go the extra mile (wink) and donate today. If you are not in a position to help monetarily today, I'd appreciate if you could share this post with others to help spread the word. No need to donate via my link, direct donations to Fred Hollows are also possible (but not sure if these are being matched). Why donate to Fred Hollows? To put it very briefly, could you do your job with a vision impairment or blindness? Could you support your family, or would they be supporting you? Blindness can take away everything from those affected, but you can help bring it back! Many instances of blindness are treatable. More info can be found on the Fred Hollows website. https://lnkd.in/gDjUFZre\n\nüåü Spotlight on PEARL: Uplifting Single-Parent Families üåü In the heart of our community, there‚Äôs a beacon of hope for single-parent families.

Warplanes mercilessly targeted the seven-story residential building, \"Al-Salam Home 6 Building,\" which I call my home. After warplanes targeted my apartment in the same building earlier, several months ago. The aftermath is heart-wrenching - the building has been completely destroyed. I had only been living in this building for a year, and now my neighbors and I find ourselves grappling with the harsh reality. Our dreams, the roof over our heads, and our hopes have been demolished in an instant. It feels like everything we have worked for has been torn apart. The impact goes beyond the physical destruction; it carries a heavy emotional toll. We find ourselves burdened with debts and instalments that we were yet to pay, adding to our already overwhelming challenges. This ordeal has left us devastated, helpless, and uncertain about the future. In moments like these, we must come together as a community. Let us extend our support, empathy, and solidarity to my family. Together, we can lend a helping hand, rebuild shattered lives, and restore hope amidst the darkness. Please keep us in your thoughts and prayers during this difficult time. Share this post to raise awareness and encourage others to stand with us. Let us unite and demonstrate that even in the face of adversity, compassion and resilience prevail.

A Lasting Legacy: The homes we build are not just for one holiday season; they are for lifetimes, for families to grow, and for communities to flourish. Help Solve the Crisis: BC is in a housing crisis. The more times we can say 'Yes', the more we can ease the burden on struggling families, one home at a time. So, will you say 'Yes' with us? Your gift could be the difference between a family celebrating the holidays in the harsh cold or within the warm walls of their own home. This Christmas, be the magic in someone's story. Say 'Yes' to hope, 'Yes' to love, and 'Yes' to a better future for all. Donate today, and let your 'Yes' ring true. www.habitatdonate.com Pictured: One of the units your donations helped build at 1375 Piercy Ave, in Courtenay.\n\nDo you want to help some well deserving children that need your help kicking butt at school this year so they can grow up to help their communities and do great things? (who could say no to that?!!!) School starts on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota in THREE weeks. With an unemployment rate over 80%, many families struggle to provide even the basics. The children, with no control over their circumstances, are the ones who suffer the most. Select things from this amazon wishlist: https://bit.ly/3WHfa0A (shipping address should come up as Robbie White Eyes/Two Bulls). The donations go straight to South Dakota to Ingrid Schneider's contact on the reservation that puts these together for the kids. In addition to selecting things on the list myself- if YOU select something & donate it, comment below. I will donate $5 per person, up to $150 for them to get other materials they need. That's just 30 people to help out. Read more about the Pine Ridge Reservation here: https://lnkd.in/gU6G-XSM\n\nDear friends, Today, I reach out to you with a heartfelt plea for help. Madalina, a brave mother of three, is in a desperate situation and needs our support. After several surgeries, Madalina has lost one of her legs and is now confined to a wheelchair. These tragic events have placed her in a difficult position where she can barely provide for her children and herself. The Urgent Situation Madalina has not been able to pay her rent for the past seven months. Understandably frustrated, the landlord has given her a final warning and plans to involve the authorities to evict her from the house. This family is on the brink of homelessness. How You Can Help I am asking you to contribute as little as one euro, dollar, or pound to help Madalina and her children. Your generous donations will be used primarily for: Paying off overdue rent: Ensuring the family has a roof over their heads. Buying food: Providing the essentials for Madalina and her children. Procuring a prosthetic leg: Helping Madalina regain some mobility and independence. Every Contribution Counts No amount is too small. Every single donation will make a significant difference in their lives. Imagine the impact we can collectively make if each of us gives just a tiny portion of what we have. It could mean the difference between security and uncertainty for Madalina and her children. Spread the Word If you cannot donate at this time, you can still help by spreading the word. Share this post, tell your friends, and encourage others to visit our blog and contribute. Together, we can make a monumental difference.

For an employer-sponsored private foundation, the hardship event must constitute a ‚Äúqualified disaster.‚Äù > Jim: We were robbed last night. > Holly: That wasn‚Äôt us, right? I mean‚Ä¶ you remembered to lock the doors? > Michael: No, did you? > Holly: Michael, I think this is our fault. 2. The class of beneficiaries must be large or indefinite enough to qualify as a charitable class. > Michael: To recoup our losses, I am planning a little charity auction, where people from all over Scranton can come and bid on our goods and services. I‚Äôm calling it \"crime-aid.\" It‚Äôs like farm aid, but instead of farms fighting against AIDS, it‚Äôs us fighting against our own poverty. 3. For a charity auction, confirm you have all the items advertised. More of a donor relations issue. > Michael: All right, in my pocket, I have two tickets to Mr. Bruce Springsteen‚Ä¶ Oh, where are those? Has anyone seen an envelope with Bruce Springsteen front row tickets and backstage passes? Anybody seen something like-lying around? I think they were stolen and they‚Äôre gone forever. 4. Generosity can be contagious! > Phyllis: I have my hug. > Michael: Yeah, well, Phyllis, nobody really wants a hug, so. > Bob: I‚Äôll bid on a hug. > Michael: She‚Äôs your wife, you idiot. > Bob: $100. > David Wallace: $200. > Michael: Uh, what the heck is happening? . . . . > Dwight: $700 and one penny. > Bob: [loudly] $1,000! > Dwight: Eh, not worth it. > Michael: $1,000 going once, $1,000 going twice. Phyllis‚Äô hug sold for $1,000 dollars. ____ Words of wisdom from Season 5, Episode 4 (‚ÄúCrime Aid‚Äù) from our friends at Dunder Mifflin. #nonprofitofficewisdom #philanthropy #charity"
