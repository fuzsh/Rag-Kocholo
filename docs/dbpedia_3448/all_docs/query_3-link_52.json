        "text": "Season of the Dragon follows a cursed girl who is grappling with two souls when her father is killed by a dragon which sends her on a quest for vengeance where she becomes the hunted. What got you excited about starting this Dragos Primeri series?\n\nThe original inspiration for this story began back in 2016! Initially, I was inspired by the idea of a story with a elemental magic loosely based on my Feng Shui practice. I began talking with readers at comic-cons and book festivals about dragons and elemental magic. The world of Menauld grew out of those conversations. The main character, Quen, took a while to develop. But once I ‚Äúgot‚Äù her, I became excited for the possibility of the story I could tell about her‚Äîand the mysterious shadow soul within her.\n\nQuen Santu was a character that faces a lot of obstacles. What were some sources that informed her character development?\n\nWhile I don‚Äôt outline every scene for my books, I know where I want my characters to wind up at the end. For Quen, I had a premise that guided her character arc, and thus informed the conflict. The idea was this: To become our most powerful selves, we must accept the truth of what‚Äîand who‚Äîwe are. That‚Äôs the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù for writing the book, and the idea for the Quen character came from that. But an additional, and very important, idea soon developed: the bonds of family. Quen, for good reasons, questions whether she is lovable if people learn the truth about her. So that first idea‚Äîembracing the truth of who/what you are‚Äîbutts up against the second story question‚Äîwill people love me if I reveal my truth? That emotional question forms the spine of the story. All the fun with dragons, mages, and rogues flows from these essential questions for the main character.\n\nWhat scene in the book did you have the most fun writing?\n\nThe romantic scenes are all fun to write, but the scene I enjoyed writing most is the drinking scene in the Juinar Inn. Quen‚Äôs found family is kicking back with a few drinks after a difficult day, and it was fun to imagine this group of rogue-type characters getting ‚Äúpished.‚Äù I wrote a drinking song called ‚ÄúSong of Niyadi‚Äù that kicks off the book at the beginning. It was a blast to re-work that song into bawdy lyrics‚Äîand hella difficult as I had to stay within the rhythm of the song with the same number of syllables! But hey, that‚Äôs fun for a word nerd such as myself.\n\nWhat can readers expect in book two in the Dragos Primeri series?\n\nIt‚Äôs difficult to answer without giving away the end of Season of the Dragon‚Ä¶ I can say that book two will focus mainly on Aldewin, and readers will learn much more about this mysterious man from the north, and learn his secrets that remained at the end of book one. And as with book one, readers can expect that book two will immerse them once again in the world of Menauld‚Äîand the northern continent, Tinox. Oooh, I have such fun things planned! SotD truly is just the beginning.\n\nAuthor‚Äôs Linktree: https://linktr.ee/nataliewrightauthor\n\nH.A.L.F. Origins follows Tex and Erika while they‚Äôre running for their lives against a deadly alien virus that is spawning an epidemic around the globe. What was the inspiration behind this idea and how did it develop as you were writing?\n\nThe idea of an alien virus was part of the H.A.L.F. storyline from the very beginning of my planning back in 2010/2011. But I planned that the Conexus (the ‚Äúaliens‚Äù behind the virus) wanted to wipe out humans so they could take over the planet. That idea changed a bit when I had the later idea of introducing the M‚ÄôUktah, predator aliens from across the galaxy. The addition of the M‚ÄôUktah altered how the virus would be used. In general, as I developed the story, I kept looking for ways to make life more and more difficult for my characters! So in book three they are beset with the obstacle of both a virulent virus and alien predators trying to devour the population.\n\nThe story is fast paced and throws readers into the deep end of the action. How do you balance action with storytelling to create such a captivating novel?\n\nNovels have lots of ‚Äúmoving parts‚Äù and finding balance between the elements is perhaps the greatest challenge. Action, character development, setting, plot, pacing, theme, dialogue, character arc‚Äìthese and more are all part of the process. Having a fabulous content development editor helps a lot. Alyssa at Red Adept Editing has provided early feedback on all of the H.A.L.F. novels. She is great at helping me see ways to improve pacing, etc. Some of it though is intuitive, but intuition seems to improve with more writing experience. üòâ\n\nI enjoyed watching Tex and Erika‚Äôs relationship grow throughout the story. Was there story organic or did you plan it in advance?\n\nI did not originally plan for Tex and Erika to end up together. When I wrote book one, I assumed that Erika would end up with Jack and that Tex as their relationship ‚Äúcomplication.‚Äù But that‚Äôs now how it ended up and so yes, what transpires between Erika and Tex was organic. Writing their relationship was the most satisfying part of the writing process of this series.\n\nThis is book 3 in the H.A.L.F. series. Are you moving on to other stories or are you going to continue to develop this universe you‚Äôve created?\n\nI am finished with the H.A.L.F. stories and do not intend to write more about Tex or Erika (or Jack and Anna). I‚Äôm currently focused on development of an entirely new project that will be epic fantasy.\n\nI may, however, write some shorts or perhaps a serialized story set on the planet of Uktah, the world of the alien predators from the H.A.L.F. series. There has also been interest by screen writers and producers in developing H.A.L.F. for television, so I‚Äôll be working on that as well in the coming months. H.A.L.F. may show up on the small screen some day. üôÇ\n\nAnd I‚Äôm introducing a new writing challenge for the writing community called PENuary that will debut January, 2018. Inspired by Inktober, I‚Äôll be writing a minimum of 20 minutes per day from a one-word writing prompt for each of the 31 days of January. I‚Äôm inviting other writers of all skill levels to join in this endeavor. You can read more about it here. I‚Äôm hoping that I end up with 2-3 cool ideas out of the 31 day challenge.\n\nAuthor Links: GoodReads | Twitter | Facebook | Website\n\nA deadly alien virus spawns an epidemic. Predators attack Europe. And a clandestine organization conspires to profit from chaos and forge a New World Order.\n\nIn this heart-pounding finale of the award-winning H.A.L.F. series, Tex, Erika and the rest are in a race against time. They fought for their lives. Now they battle to save our species.\n\nTex and Erika are fugitives and running for their lives. But when Tex falls gravely ill, a Navajo healer is his only hope for survival. Tex emerges from the ordeal changed in body and mind and with vital information: how to stop the predatory M‚ÄôUktah from overtaking the human population and destroying those he has come to love.\n\nErika Holt seeks a respite from the constant threats to her life but she‚Äôs not about to give up. As she and Tex launch a mission to shut down the intra-galactic highway used by invaders who prey on humans, she grows closer to her troubled half-human companion. But what about her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Jack?\n\nJack Wilson, with his friend Anna Sturgis, is on a mission of his own. He‚Äôs determined to destroy The Makers, an illuminati-like organization behind the H.A.L.F. program. It‚Äôs time to put an end to their schemes for world domination. Complicating matters, an anti-viral that could save millions from an alien virus has been stolen. As both alien and human forces line up against them, the destiny of all mankind is hand the hands of these young warriors. And time is running out.\n\nH.A.L.F Origins written by Natalie Wright is the third book in the H.A.L.F series. This book will please fans of the series, which is aimed at young adults. It takes a look at the characters that fans know and love, Tex, Erika and Jack Wilson. Tex and Erika are on their own adventures, running for their lives against the deadly alien virus that is spawning an epidemic around the globe. As well as predators attacking Europe and an organization whose conspiring to profit from chaos and forge a New World Order. It seems like these two have their hands full.\n\nTex and Erika need help from a Navajo healer when Tex falls gravely ill The healer is their only chance at helping Tex live. Thankfully, Tex emerges from the experience with vital information which will help stop the predatory M‚ÄôUktah from overtaking the human population. Sounds crazy, hey! Very intense.\n\nI really enjoyed that this book had a pronunciation and definition guide at the start of the book otherwise I would‚Äôve had trouble keeping up with whose who.\n\nAnother thing I really enjoyed was the sweet acknowledgment at the start of the book, as many acknowledgments are at the back and I didn‚Äôt realize that she had written so many words (300,000 to be exact).\n\nThe story is really fast paced and throws you immediately into the deep end of the action. The writing is really clever and immerses the reader immediately into the world of the characters. You can really tell that the author has crafted these characters with care, as they‚Äôre all very different and have a different tone. I‚Äôve noticed with some of the other books that I‚Äôve read, authors tend to just reuse personality traits, but that was not the case with this book at all.\n\nWith The Makers and predatory creatures who want to enslave the human race, I found this book to be very enjoyable and action-packed. It was very sweet to read Erika and Tex‚Äôs budding romance, as he‚Äôs half-human and she‚Äôs into someone else. That was relatable as hell, I mean, apart from the fact he‚Äôs half human. These two broke my heart again and again. Why did they make everything so complicated!?\n\nThe complexity of the characters within this story is what kept me on the edge of my seat. Although I generally like it when characters are undoubtedly good or bad, it‚Äôs refreshing for me to read characters that aren‚Äôt always like this. This was the case with the main characters within this book, as you learn more and more about them as time goes on.\n\nI really enjoyed this book. Is it the last one in the series? I hope not.\n\nPages: 377 | ASIN: B07263P84J\n\nH.A.L.F.: The Makers follows two groups of protagonists under the threat of an alien race. What direction did you want to take this novel that was different from the first book in the series?\n\nThe first book deals mainly with the idea that the aliens known as the Roswell Greys (those ubiquitous big-eyed, bulbous-headed aliens) are the alien threat. Book one brings the reader in with familiar imagery and ideas such as the Roswell crash, the Greys and government conspiracy reminiscent of the X-Files.\n\nIn The Makers (book two), my goal was to expand on the familiar alien mythology. I introduced my own alien species as well as my own ideas about the Roswell Greys. This expanded the story significantly. Books two (The Makers) and three (ORIGINS) are more epic in scope than in book one (The Deep Beneath).\n\nThe characters in this novel are once again intriguing and well developed. Who was your favorite character to write for?\n\nThank you for that compliment! üôÇ I enjoy writing all of the characters and especially had fun creating the sexual tension between Jack and Anna and also between Erika and Tex (though their tension really amps up in book three ;-).\n\nBut overall, I most enjoy writing in Tex‚Äôs perspective. Given that he‚Äôs only half-human, it‚Äôs fun spending time in his head! I like seeing our world through his eyes. Tex has strange, other-worldly experiences with the Regina and the Conexus in The Makers. Those scenes were creepy and fun to write! And his story grows and gets even better, I think, in book 3 (ORIGINS ‚Äì releasing 8/24/17).\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the well crafted mystery and the detailed characters. What is your writing process like?\n\nThank you, again, for your kind words. My writing process is messy! When I first began writing fiction, I outlined extensively. I was an attorney for 20 years, so planning was in my nature!\n\nBut after writing two or three novels, I found that I no longer followed outlines I created. The more experience I get as a writer, the more I focus on character development in my pre-write planning. I write back story, flesh out motivation and details about the characters. For both The Makers (H.A.L.F. #2) and ORIGINS (H.A.L.F. #3), I did not outline the plot. I have a general idea‚Äîbeginning point, middle point and end point. I focus, for each POV character, on what needs to happen for this character for the story to end.\n\nFor The Makers, because there are two separate plot lines, I wrote the Tex and Erika portions all at once, then the Jack and Anna portions, then the U‚ÄôVol chapters. I then had to thread them together. Phew!\n\nWriting in this way takes quite a bit more time than following a detailed outline. I generally cut anywhere from 20,000-50,000 words and have to rewrite and revise for months. But I think that because I don‚Äôt pre-plan, the story has more surprises than if I planned it all out. When I‚Äôm in the flow, the story goes in unpredicted ways. I hope that readers enjoy the unpredictability and surprises in the plot.\n\nWhat are some writers or books that you felt inspired you and this series?\n\nI was inspired by George R.R. Martin‚Äôs Game of Thrones. I know that may sound odd given that the H.A.L.F. series is young adult Sci-Fi‚Äîno dragons! But I read all five of the GoT series while writing book one (The Deep Beneath) and I was inspired to make the H.A.L.F. series into a more complex story. Most young adult books follow a single protagonist, often told in first person, and generally in a fairly linear fashion. I wanted to push the boundaries a bit and write a YA book with multiple storylines and point-of-view characters. This idea was in direction reaction to my love of G.R.R.M‚Äôs writing style.\n\nI was also heavily inspired by Chris Carter‚Äôs work in the X-Files. I tried to emulate the creepy vibe of the X-Files as well as drawing out the mystery the way the X-Files did. You think the ‚Äúbad guy‚Äù is one person, but it may turn out to be someone else‚Äîor something else‚Äîentirely. Readers of the H.A.L.F. series won‚Äôt know all of the answers to the many questions raised until the very end of the series! And I think they‚Äôll be surprised by how it all turns out!\n\nAuthor Links: GoodReads | Twitter | Facebook | Website\n\n‚ÄúThe Makers‚Äù is the follow-up to Natalie Wright‚Äôs multiple award-winning debut science fiction novel ‚ÄúH.A.L.F.: The Deep Beneath.‚Äù ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen grey aliens on T.V. and in movies. We may think we know all about them. But what if everything we think we know is wrong?‚Äù Erika Holt dodged death and departed Earth in an alien ship. It wasn‚Äôt how she‚Äôd planned to spend her senior year. Is Erika on her way to paradise? Or to a hell worse than the underground lab she escaped? The greys rescued Tex from A.H.D.N.A. and promised him a life he could never have imagined. But what will he have to give up to become one with The Conexus? Jack Wilson is still Commander Sturgis‚Äô prisoner, but a promise of freedom comes from an unlikely source. Will his liberation cost more than he‚Äôs willing to pay? Caught up in their personal battles and focused on our war with the grey aliens, will any of them realize the true threat that looms over us all before it‚Äôs too late?\n\nH.A.L.F.: The Makers written by the fantastic, and award winning author, Natalie Wright starts off strong and striking with amazingly descriptive writing. The story follows two groups of protagonists, Erika, Ian, Dr. Randell and Tex taken via the Grays, an alien race who hosted a massive aura of mystery. Tex is being held separate from the others. The group believes themselves to be on an alien ship. However, Tex has information that could show otherwise. The aliens rejected Jack and left him on earth to the group‚Äôs confusion, while Commander Sturgis, starting off with a messy confrontation with her superior, holds knowledge of what‚Äôs to come.\n\nEvery character has a defined purpose and is finely crafted; each plays their role, with unique perspectives and interesting points of view. The writing is incredibly descriptive and sets the scene for each character. However, there is a lot of switching back and forth between different characters that made the story hard to keep in perspective at times.\n\nOn the other hand, the way the author meticulously develops the mystery throughout the story, and how carefully crafted each character is, kept be glued to the pages. They were like finely ticking cogs working towards the bigger picture. The opening segment was one of the most captivating pieces I‚Äôve read in a long time, the detailed description of Erika inside the alien ship was fascinating and had me hooked from the very first page. Most characters are written in a very personal way that make them feel real and make it easy to understand their fears, pride, and personality.\n\nThe pacing of the story helped drive the mystery and allowed time for characters to fully develop.\n\nH.A.L.F The Makers has a fantastic story, filled to cover to cover with excellent description and brilliant creative freedom. Personally, I knew I was going to finish the book from cover to cover the moment I read the first chapter. A short prologue would have been a welcome addition for new readers. But none the less, pure passion and creativity eased me into the story, and before I knew it, I was heavily invested.\n\nPages: 362 | ASIN: B01BLRM2HO\n\nH.A.L.F. tells the story of H.A.L.F 9, a Human-Alien Life Form that escapes from the military facility where he was created. What was your inspiration for this imaginative and thrilling novel?\n\nThe original idea and plot for this story came to me one day as I was driving in my hometown of Tucson, Arizona, listening to a techno-rap song called ‚ÄúCowboys and Aliens‚Äù. What can I say ‚Äì it was a hot day in the desert! I‚Äôve long been fascinated by the remote area in southern Arizona, the borderlands between Mexico and the U.S. There‚Äôs a military testing range out there and not much else. That song on that day got me thinking about how alien conspiracy theorists talk about a secret underground base. And I thought what if such a base is under the missile testing range? And what if there really are human-alien hybrids? And why would a shadow government want to create such a being? The series has been great fun for me, a huge X-Files, Twilight Zone and Star Trek fan. Fun to create my own alien worlds and adventures!\n\nH.A.L.F. 9 forms a bond with other teens that he comes across and their relationships are dynamic and deep as well. What themes did you try to capture when you were creating the relationships the characters had?\n\nWhen I write a first draft, I generally don‚Äôt think about themes. I also don‚Äôt spend time outlining relationships before I write. I try my best to let the characters ‚Äúspeak‚Äù and for the relationships to evolve organically.\n\nBut once the first draft is written, with the assistance of my content editor, I fine tune. In The Deep Beneath, I had not originally intended for H.A.L.F. 9 to become romantically interested in Erika. But he‚Äôs a 17 year old guy who‚Äôs never been around girls his own age! Of course he‚Äôs interested in her!\n\nAs for the three human teens, I spent a lot of pre-first draft planning time creating a relationship backstory for them. On the advice of an early editor, I decided to have Erika and Jack having problems in their boyfriend/girlfriend relationship right off the bat. That‚Äôs not a typical starting point in a YA book and I think it was good advice. Over the three books, readers get to see complex relationships play out. And I think that‚Äôs more like what life is really like. Even with people we love deeply, we don‚Äôt always get along. There are ups and downs. But will we stick with someone through thick and thin? Or bail on them when the going gets tough?\n\nIan and Erika are best friends. Like many best friends in coming of age stories, their relationship is tested by the difficult circumstances they‚Äôre thrust into. The circumstances of the story force them to journey beyond their small town and into the wider world. And oh what a world they step into! They each are confronted with moral dilemmas and the choices they make affects their relationship.\n\nWhat emerges is a story that over the 3-book series is about loyalty, trust, and having each other‚Äôs backs. Not only do we see this in how the three older teens deal with each other, but also through how Erika is teaching H.A.L.F. 9 about living in the human world.\n\nAs I‚Äôm just finishing up revisions on the third and final book in the series, ORIGINS, I‚Äôm going to miss these characters! I‚Äôve enjoyed writing their relationships and watching them grow.\n\nH.A.L.F 9 has telekinetic and telepathic powers which make him a valuable asset to the government. These powers are used in unique and interesting ways. How did you handle the use of these powers in the novel where they were believable yet useful?\n\nI was inspired to give H.A.L.F. 9 the powers that he has from my research into a real top secret military project called Project Stargate. It was started in the 1970‚Äôs and the purpose was to research the potential of ‚Äúpsychic warfare.‚Äù This was during the cold war and they were seeking to create a ‚Äúremote viewing‚Äù spy network but there was also this idea that enemies could potentially be taken out from thousands of miles away using only the mind.\n\nOf course they didn‚Äôt produce much in the way of results. The funding dried up and the program ended (allegedly ;-).\n\nThese sorts of top secret programs inspired the story. What if aliens had stronger psychic abilities than humans, and if a human-alien hybrid was engineered to have the stronger alien psychic abilities, what could it do? Media often portrays aliens as having much more developed psychic abilities than humans, so I thought it would be believable for a human-alien hybrid to have these sorts of powers.\n\nGiving the hybrid being these abilities was like creating superpowers or a magic system. So I had to think of its limits. That led to a rather unique problem for the hybrid beings that acts as a limit on their ‚Äúmagic‚Äù and is, I think, one of the more unique aspects of the series.\n\nWhat is the next book that you are working on and when will it be available?\n\nH.A.L.F.: ORIGINS (H.A.L.F. 3) will be available August 24, 2017! I‚Äôm so excited for it! It has been a super difficult book to write due to all the threads that spread out in book 2. But I think that readers will find the wrap up exciting and satisfying ‚Äì and all questions will be answered!\n\nAuthor Links: Twitter | Facebook | Website | GoodReads\n\nH.A.L.F. 9 has taken his first breath of desert air and his first steps in the human world. Created to be a weapon, he proved too powerful for his makers and has lived a sedated life hidden from humans. But H.A.L.F. 9 has escaped the underground lab he called home, and the sedation has worn off. He has never been more alive. More powerful. Or more deadly.\n\nErika Holt longs to ride her motorcycle east until pavement meets shore. She bides her time until graduation when she‚Äôll say adios to the trailer she shares with her alcoholic mother and memories of her dead father. But a typical night in the desert with friends thrusts Erika into a situation more dangerous than she ever imagined.\n\nCircumstances push the two together, and each must make a fateful choice. Will Erika help H.A.L.F. 9 despite her ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get involved‚Äù rule? And will H.A.L.F. 9 let Erika live even though he was trained to kill?\n\nThe two may need to forget their rules and training and if either is to survive the dangers of the deep beneath them.\n\nH.A.L.F by Natalie Wright tells the story of H.A.L.F 9, a Human-Alien Life Form that escapes from the military facility where he was created. During the course of his escape, H.A.L.F 9 meets teenagers, Erika, Jack and Ian, with whom he strikes up a friendship. Among other abilities, H.A.L.F 9 has extreme telekinetic and telepathic powers which make him a valuable asset to the government and one that they are not willing to lose. The government, claiming ownership of H.A.L.F 9‚Äôs life, sets out to retrieve him. Having no human technology that can match H.A.L.F 9‚Äôs power, they have to enlist a force stronger and more cunning than even H.A.L.F 9 is prepared to face.\n\nRight from the start of the book the characters are likable and relatable. Even though the first couple of chapters were a bit confusing, each one was intriguing enough to make me want to keep reading. It isn‚Äôt immediately obvious how the characters in the first chapters are related to one another, but once you do discover the connection the direction of the story makes perfect sense. The writing is actually done very well for a Young Adult novel; which the book appears to be, as all the main characters are teenagers. I was very surprised at how each chapter really kept me on the edge of my seat; my interest in finishing the book never waned. Most books have at least a few chapters that are somewhat slow but I didn‚Äôt find this to be the case with H.A.L.F., it kept a great pace and remained interesting throughout. I think the struggle within H.A.L.F 9 between his alien and human personalities were done incredibly well. Having spent hardly any time at all actually interacting with humans on a personal level, he isn‚Äôt quite sure what to make of the new feelings that he experiences outside of the facility. For instance, there is a moment at which he finds himself wanting Jack to feel pain, even though he can acknowledge that Jack has never done anything to deserve his ill will. H.A.L.F 9 isn‚Äôt able to recognize that he feels this way toward Jack because of Jack‚Äôs romantic involvement with Erika, whom H.A.L.F 9 is also developing romantic feelings towards. I also appreciated how this aspect of the characters relationships is subtle and not the focus of any particular chapter in the story. Sometimes Young Adult fiction does not have a good balance of romance to substance but this book does not have that problem.\n\nNatalie Wright does an excellent job with the element of surprise. I don‚Äôt want to give any spoilers so I will just say that in several places throughout the book the outcome that I was imagining is not at all what came to pass. I eagerly await the next installment of this series.\n\nPages: 293 | ASIN: B00R6U32CA"
