        "text": "I'm well aware as a 30 something white woman, I am not the books target reader.\n\nHowever, as a secondary school teacher I feel it's important to read books such as this to get a more in depth idea about my pupils. I think that everyone - no matter what their race, age or gender would get a lot rom this book - even if you're not the target demographic.It's eye-opening.\n\nThere is A LOT of information within these pages, and at times it was a little overwhelming. I had to read this book in short chunks so I could fully digest everything. I certainly learnt a lot and I'm sure that younger females of colour would adore this. The journal prompts in this book are also a great addition.\n\nWow. Where to start with an incredible book like this? A straightforward guide to growing up, written directly to the reader. Aimed at young Black girls, however not limited by this; any girl would be hooked from the get go. It is relatable right from the beginning, using language that fits their target audience. It is not written in a way that comes across as preachy or filled with judgement but focused on valuing the individual.\n\nIt is split into a range of sections that can be read as a standalone, but also interlink and connect beautifully following on from one another. Each section is informative, containing a range of stories, advice, top tips and also gives plenty of opportunities to engage with the text. For example by filling in personal mantras, reflecting on who they are and their own sense of self, or giving them other avenues to research and explore. For example, through books, film TV and music written and produced by women of colour.\n\nThe overarching message is that you are good enough, you are worthy, and you should be the best version of yourself you can be. This comes across on every level and in every section. Topics covered range from identity, culture, skin and hair (giving tips and advice, but also wrapped up in equality and current issues), friendships, microaggressions, red flags, consent, religion, careers (dreaming big), affirmations, money advice (very informative) and puberty.\n\nThe section on puberty covers periods, masturbation and accurate labelling of anatomy. This is within the Year 5 curriculum within the UK. It goes on to cover contraception and pregnancy, the specific aspects of which are covered within the Year 6 curriculum. It also includes information on STIs and smear tests. Parents may wish to read first (but not sensor) so they can be ready for any conversations that may arise.\n\nThis book covers so much and I can imagine it becoming the go to bible on growing up for a generation of young girls. Thank you for writing it."
