When she matches the signs with those on the skeleton of the first victim, it is confirmed to her that she is looking for another serial killer. Shortly after, another girl disappears mysteriously, making Robyn realize that she does not have much time left and cannot let another innocent girl lose her life before she succeeds in hunting down the murderer.\n\nBook Series In Order » Authors » Carol Wyer\n\n2 Responses to “Carol Wyer”"
