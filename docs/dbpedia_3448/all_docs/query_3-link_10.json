        "text": "In a city of sinners…\n\nThe Disciple is on a mission to rid the city of sinners. With a twisted view of the Bible, he finds unique ways to kill those he believes deserve to die, then puts their bodies on display for all the world to see. He claims he’s teaching the city a lesson. It turns out he’s done this before. But this time, there’s a major difference—the Disciple has now discovered how much he enjoys executing his mission. The thrill of the hunt, elaborate methods of murder, and a city on edge are the ingredients of the Disciple’s perfect cocktail. Intoxicated by the pursuit, and armed with a long list of names and a twisted desire to please God, he is just getting started.\n\n. . . pray you don’t make…\n\nTravis Parker, a.k.a. Parker Travis, is the lead hand in the produce department at the local grocery store. However, he fancies himself a journalist. When he stumbles across a grisly scene in a dark downtown alley in the city of St. John’s, Travis alerts the police, but not before taking his own pictures and slipping away before the police arrive—and taking with him a note that the killer left in the victim’s pocket. Travis has big plans, but his amateur sleuthing lands him in trouble with the police, and unbeknownst to Travis, he catches the eye of a very dangerous man with a plan of his own.\n\n. . . the Disciple’s list.\n\nCorporal Sunny Bronson and her partner, Sergeant Roscoe Pratt, are members of the RCMP’s Major Crimes Unit in the city of St. John’s, Newfoundland. They’ve just been handed the most difficult case of their career. The body count is rising, and the mountain of evidence is growing, yet they can’t seem to connect the dots. If that wasn’t enough, someone named Parker Travis is one step ahead of them, and he’s flaunting their case on the front pages of the city’s newspaper. With a case that spans three countries and two continents, the pair scramble to bring a killer to justice. The Disciple’s list is growing, and time is running out for the next to die."
