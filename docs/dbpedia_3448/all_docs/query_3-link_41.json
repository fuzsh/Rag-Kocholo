        "text": "I'm an independent journalist. Much of my reporting focuses on gender, reproduction, and technology. I write a lot about women — their health, their ovaries, their lives. I’ve also written about farming, fashion, and female soldiers. My writing has been published in The New York Times, The New York Times Magazine, The Atlantic, The Guardian, NBC News, Slate, ELLE, Lit Hub, Marie Claire, and The Washington Post, among other outlets.\n\nI’m the author of THE BIG FREEZE: A Reporter’s Personal Journey into the World of Egg Freezing and the Quest to Control Our Fertility (Random House, 2024). A work of narrative nonfiction, THE BIG FREEZE is an investigative journalist’s close look at the frontiers of fertility science, reproductive technologies, and the femtech industry. Watch my TEDx on these topics here.\n\nThe director of my graduate program described me as “indefatigable”; my third-grade teacher called me “trouble.” That might be all you need to know about me. But, also:\n\nI hold a master's degree from New York University’s graduate school of journalism, where I studied in the Literary Reportage program and was the 2016 recipient of the Edwin Diamond Award, the highest award given by NYU's Arthur L. Carter Journalism Institute. I hold a bachelor's degree from Elon University, in North Carolina, where I studied English and international relations.\n\nI live in Boulder, Colorado with my husband and our pup. Before moving to the mountains, I lived in Brooklyn. I grew up in northern Virginia and southern Germany; \"home\" has been a long list of wonderful places. I've worked as a writer and researcher in a variety of environments, including for the Department of Defense, at The New York Times doing fact-checking, at a publishing house in Sri Lanka, and as a research assistant at The Atavist Magazine. I was a 2016 FASPE fellow (Fellowships at Auschwitz for the Study of Professional Ethics). As a 2017 Logan Nonfiction fellow, I spent three months in residency at the Carey Institute for Global Good. In 2022, I received a fellowship from Investigative Reporters & Editors (IRE). In 2023, I received a substantial book grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation’s Public Understanding program."
