        "text": "Six Months Later by Natalie D. Richards\n\nPublisher: Sourcebooks Fire\n\nGenre: Contemporary and Young Adult\n\nRelease Date: October 1, 2013\n\nPages: 336 (Paperback)\n\nChloe didn‚Äôt think about it much when she nodded off in study hall on that sleepy summer day. But when she wakes up, snow is on the ground and she can‚Äôt remember the last six months of her life. Before, she‚Äôd been a mediocre student. Now, she‚Äôs on track for valedictorian and being recruited by Ivy League schools. Before, she never had a chance with super jock Blake. Now he‚Äôs her boyfriend. Before, she and Maggie were inseparable. Now her best friend won‚Äôt speak to her.\n\nWhat happened to her?\n\nAnd why can‚Äôt she remember?\n\nFirst of all, I would like to thank the Publisher, Sourcebooks Fire for giving me an ARC of this book to review. Thank you so much! Really appreciate it! All right, now for my review.\n\nThis is a bit of a stretch but I was initially attracted to this novel because Chloe forgot six months of her life and I am a very forgetful person‚Ä¶ so we sort of share that. Anyway, Natalie D. Richards is an author that I know I will read more novels by her when they come out. Her writing style, characters, and setting reeled me in and didn‚Äôt let go until the last page. Even though there are a few predictable things about it, this story is realistic and I enjoyed it a lot despite that.\n\nSix Months Later is quite messy and I understand that it would be since Chloe doesn‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on but I was still left a bit confused and was forced to re-read a few things. There are a few things in this novel that are glaringly obvious from the beginning, like who‚Äôs involved with certain things and with that being said, the ride didn‚Äôt feel as fun and exciting as it could have been.\n\nWhat I did like about this book is the humour that‚Äôs easily weaved into the text. It doesn‚Äôt feel forced. The writing has a nice mix of intense scenes and realism that I love to read about. The relationship between Chloe and Maggie is sweet and realistic, I love how Richards put obstacles in their way and when they overcame them, they still weren‚Äôt ‚Äòbuddy-buddy‚Äô again which made me smile all the more. Another thing that I liked about Six Months Later are the male leads because they are so different yet so alike. Throughout the whole novel, Blake and Adam are seen and judged by their pasts rather than by the present which made a huge deal with a lovely lesson about‚Äì people should never be judged by their pasts because they don‚Äôt matter as much as their actions right now do.\n\nGenerally, I don‚Äôt read many books about amnesia because many of them are the same and I never feel entertained enough by the end. However, Six Months Later is different in the sense that there‚Äôs an easy humour to it and also has a love triangle that isn‚Äôt in the least bit annoying or over done. It fits the novel really well and I recommend this novel to people who love amnesic main characters, love triangles that aren‚Äôt annoying, or just love mystery novels.\n\nNow, onto the guest post! This is a character spotlight on Adam Reed by Natalie D. Richards. She‚Äôs been really awesome and fun to talk to, as well as made me fall even harder for Adam when I finished reading this so check it out below!\n\nAdam Reed: A Spotlight\n\n‚ÄúI admit it, I play favorites with my characters. Every character is special and meaningful and‚Ä¶oh, that‚Äôs not the point. The point is, some characters just stay with you. You get a character crush, like the one I have on my hero from Six Months Later, Adam Reed.\n\nEvery hero is fun, but Adam was something special. Here‚Äôs some of the many things that make him who he is.‚Äù-Natalie D. Richards\n\nBasic Details: 6‚Ä≥2 with dark hair and blue eyes. More prone to smirking than smiling.\n\nLikes? Red pop, breakfast at all hours, bridges and skyscrapers (you‚Äôll see), and Chloe.\n\nDislikes? Messy rooms, giggly girly-girls, being trapped between a rock and a hard place, and Blake.\n\nWhat he Drives:\n\nThree Songs on his iPod Right Now:\n\nLonely Boy ‚Äî The Black Keys\n\nComeback ‚Äî Redlight King\n\nStaring at the Sun ‚Äî TV On The Radio\n\nHow teachers might describe him:\n\nAcademically gifted, but a troubled young man\n\nWhat do other guys think?\n\n‚ÄúI heard that dude got arrested for manslaughter or something.‚Äù-Some random dude.\n\nAnd the girls?\n\n‚ÄúWith a face that pretty, he can break all the laws he wants.‚Äù-Some random chick.\n\nLast, but not least, how does Chloe see Adam?\n\n‚ÄúSix feet and a couple of inches of something that scares me half to death.‚Äù ‚Äî Six Months Later\n\nLet‚Äôs see if the journey she takes in Six Months Later changes that. üòâ\n\nAbbe, thank you so much for having me today! I had an amazing time here and really enjoyed this idea!"
