        "text": "Happy Monday my lovely readers! I’m back, I kind of had a bit of a blogging break the last week as I just needed the time for me. I haven’t been reading very much these days and had no enthusiasm to blog. Today I’m ready to get back into the swing of blogging again. I’m bringing you a review of a kick-ass feminist fantasy novel. I loved it and the sequel is coming out next month. So I hope you enjoy it.\n\nSeafire by Natalie C. Parker\n\nPublished by Usborne Publishing on August 8, 2019\n\nGenres: Fantasy\n\nAmazon | Book Depository | Waterstones\n\nGoodreads\n\nHigh seas, high stakes… and high time for revenge\n\nCaledonia Styx let down her guard once - and her family were murdered by ruthless warlord Aric Athair and his blood-thirsty Bullets. Now captain of a crew of girls who have lost everything to the Bullets, she has sworn never to show mercy again.\n\nBut when a rogue Bullet saves the life of Caledonia's best friend, she faces an impossible choice. If she lets the boy live, could he help them bring down Athair - or will he destroy them all?\n\nMy Review\n\nAt a very young age, Caledonia was sent on her first mission by her mother, but she got played the enemy of the seas, they call themselves, the Bullets specifically Aric Athair. Caledonia blamed herself for the death and destruction of her mother and all those on the ship . She and her best friend, Pisces were the only survivors. Now, four years later, she is captain of a crew girls, she will lead and guide these girls across the seas. The Bullets terrorise the seas, and Caledonia has had enough of their ruling. Until, one rogue Bullet saved her best friend’s life and is onboard Mors Navis. If it’s taught Caledonia anything she will never trust a Bullet ever again, but at the cost of revenge. There are high stakes ahead and impossible choices.\n\nCaledonia has a tough skin on her. She survived a blade to stomach and nothing and no one will stand in her way. She is the fiercest and probably the only captain to take down such a force as the Bullets. Her passion for revenge is not always a good thing though. Caledonia is consumed by the secret that set her on this path. So whilst she appears to be the al-mighty leader of the seas, you certainly get this impression that she is only just human as well. I think that’s why I loved these characters that Natalie created. Yes, we perceive them to be fierce and heroic, which they are, but Caledonia is a flawed character that has to learn a lot about herself, her leadership, and the loyalty to her crew, her family, her sisters.\n\nThe Mors Navis ship has the fiercest and finest girls in YA fantasy and such an inclusive set of secondary characters, her crew, really made the novel. Pieces – second in command, Redtooth – the muscle, Amina – the inventor, Lace – the helm girl & commanding the bridge, and little Hime, a healer and a former Bullet. Caledonia can’t complain that she has built her crew on loyalty and trust on essence of her mother’s ship Ghost. I think the story would be so good if we could get more POVs and their story especially Little Hime and Amina who were my favourite.\n\nThis is my first book written by Natalie C. Parker and her writing is honestly movie quality. You can quite clearly envision these words to become a box office hit. I love a book that has such a rich and vibrant world building of the seas. The ending especially had all the feels and I can’t wait to read Steeltide. Without a doubt there is never a dull moment. You are constantly thrown into the eye of the Bullet storm and all you can do is keep on reading.\n\nIf your a fan of Viper and Venom by Bex Hogan then you will love this book! You know I am and very rarely do you find a pirate adventure quite like these. Seafire, is like a futuristic YA adventure which brought a unique twist to a YA fantasy. With an all female pirate cast, it’s like all your favourite female superhero banded together on the treacherous seas. A fierce feminst YA fantasy of a pirate crew out for revenge.\n\nThank you to Usborne for sending me a copy in exchange for an honest review."
