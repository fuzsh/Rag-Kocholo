        "text": "May 10, 2023\n\nAll the “what ifs” really bring the story together & make you think of the alternate ways this could have gone “if” something else had to happen. I really enjoyed this aspect of the book.\n\nI couldn’t put the book down, the way it jumps back & forth to the past & then present just really captivates you & keeps you reading.\n\nThe “monster” was not who I thought it would be as it seems it would be Allie but the twist of having a brother who was hidden & then learning just how crazy Sheila is, really makes the plot heighten & keeps you questioning on who the kidnapper really is. I never would have guessed until it was revealed!\n\nLOVEEEE how David & Helena end up together, that truly makes my heart happy. Helena deserves this & although I wasn’t sure if it would happen, throughout the book I was hoping it would!\n\nThe last paragraph “it’s a great night for a campfire, and I have everything we need in this little box to start the fire” this was such a great way to end the book & left me so satisfied.\n\nOverall 10/10 for every aspect of this book. So well written & definitely keeps the reader hooked!\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers.\n\nDecember 5, 2023\n\nA debut novel for thriller writer Natalie Carter-Giles, “Hunting Helena” tells us the story of young Helena and a horrific kidnapping, her captivity, and the hell she must face at the hands of a sadistic and depraved perpetrator.\n\nFor over three months Helena is held captive in a dark, cold basement. She is subjected to what can only be described as torture. She is beaten, starved, and assaulted on a regular basis by her sick and twisted captor. She often thinks of giving up, of giving into the darkness around her but somehow, Helena manages to keep going. She finds the fortitude to plan and execute her escape. She is a survivor, but her attacker remains at large, and this is something she cannot forget.\n\nThis book is an emotional read at times. It is heartbreaking what Helena must go through and what she continues to face knowing that this madman is still out there, hurting other women. With Sergeant David Campbell from Major Crimes at her side, Helena must now confront her past in order to secure her future … and the future of her child.\n\nWritten with a concise and clear voice, Carter-Giles speaks of pain and triumph, terror and joy. A very entertaining book that was certainly a page-turner for me. I read it very quickly because I HAD to know how it was going to end. I look forward to reading other publications from this author.\n\nSeptember 11, 2023\n\nFun to read about Newfoundland without it being specifically *about* Newfoundland. This book is a thriller with a lot of interiority - an unusual but not unpleasant combination. I expect the next one will be even better!\n\nJune 28, 2023\n\nVery good read. Hard to put down. Great job to Natalie.\n\nFebruary 4, 2024\n\nThis book pulls at so many emotions. It keeps you completely captivated in the story.\n\nThe fact that it goes back and forth between the past and current is perfect, it helps you piece everything together along the way.\n\nApril 19, 2023\n\nA powerful debut for author Natalie Carter-Giles! Hunting Helena is a heart-wrenching thriller you won’t be able to put down. What if…? In each chapter, the author explores how a sequence of events could have been altered if different decisions had been made. Life can change in a split second. For Helena, one tragedy follows another and she questions how things could have gone differently, if only…\n\nBut left without a family or friends, Helena becomes the victim of a sadist and is kidnapped and tortured for more than three months by someone unknown to her. Barely escaping with her life, Helena vows to track down the monster who destroyed her life and was never found. Eight years later, she may finally have the chance to get her revenge.\n\nSpanning multiple timelines, the suspense is heightened as chapters alternate between the present and past, chronicling the events that led to Helena’s imprisonment and the aftermath. Full of atmosphere, the setting evokes a sense of solitude that parallels the main character’s emotions. From the lighthouse at the foggy lake to the cornfield in the middle of nowhere, the reader follows Helena as runs from her life and her torment.\n\nThis realistic, fast-paced story of a woman’s experience with evil will keep you on your toes as the tables are turned and the hunter becomes the hunted.\n\nJanuary 18, 2024\n\nEight years ago, college student Helena was abducted and held captive by a monster who abused her physically, sexually, and psychologically. Miraculously she escapes after three months and begins a long recovery process, but the discovery of another victim's body sends her and RCMP Officer David back to Deer Lake in search of justice.\n\nNope, not for me.\n\nThough the story unfolds through excerpts of Helena's early life (coping with the death of her father and supporting her grieving mother), the abduction, and the present, the graphic descriptions of torture, abuse, and tragedy make for a very uncomfortable read.\n\nSignificant clues about the abductor are revealed mid-story so there are limited surprises and the story plods along.\n\nHelena's risky actions in the final chapters place her in unnecessary danger and disregard her 'partnership' with the RCMP investigator.\n\nA hard pass on this torture thriller.\n\nJune 26, 2023\n\nWriting this book was an exercise in perseverance, in trusting my instincts, and in learning to believe in myself...a true labor of love. As an avid reader of thrillers, I sincerely hope that I have written one that has you, the reader, turning pages way past bedtime. I believe Hunting Helena is a worthy 5 star story and I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I did writing it! There is always room for improvement, however, and as a writer who hopes to bring you more exciting thriller books, I'd love to read your thoughts! Happy reading!\n\nMay 19, 2024\n\nThis book is about a young woman named Helena who was abducted and tortured in many ways. She was eventual able to escape from the monster but the man was never found. That is until 8 years later when Helena and David the original detective on her case go digging for answers. There were many layers to this story and kept me one rated throughout. I was able to predict the outcome as the book went on but it was we written and I enjoyed reading this book. I would recommend it.\n\nJanuary 3, 2024\n\nI initially purchased this book because it was my friend's sister who wrote it and I'm so glad I did. It was a great story that had me intrigued till the end. Congratulations on your first book Natalie, I cannot wait to read your next book."
