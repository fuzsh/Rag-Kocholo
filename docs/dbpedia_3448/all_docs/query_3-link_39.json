        "text": "I've had this story idea written down in a book for ages and I've recently found it so decided I want to post it. It's a twilight fanfic focused on the pack but this time Jacob Black. It will probably be a short story but I'll see how it goes. It may end up being longer.\n\n**************\n\nJanuary 2005\n\n\"Hey Jake where you headed?\"\n\nI asked as I skipped excitedly towards my boyfriend. Jacob Black and I had been dating since we were 15 although we grew up together on the Quileute reservation. Our moms were best friends so we've practically known each other since we were in diapers. Growing up I always saw Jake as the annoying boy who was always hanging around making my life miserable, I swear him and his best friends Quil and Embry made it their lifes mission to annoy me. As we got older they turned into the protective older brothers always scaring away any guy that looked in my direction. I never really considered Jacob in a romantic way until I turned 15 and he punched Adam West in the face when he tried to kiss me. He was suspended from school for three days but he was so proud of himself. I couldn't let him suffer alone since he did it for me so I spent the afternoons at his place helping him with his homework and just hanging out. It was then I realised how I felt about him, I had a major crush on Jacob and to complete surprise he felt the same way\n\nFlashback\n\n\"Hey Jake, ready to get back to school?\"\n\nI chirped as I walked down the porch steps of my house. Jacob rolled his eyes in response but his face lit up with a dazzling smile and I could feel my stomach filling with butterflies.\n\n\"No way do I want to go back to school but you'll be there so I should get through the day fine\"\n\nHe flashes me another smile and I could feel my cheeks heating up. Suddenly he grabbed hold of my hand entwining our fingers as we walked.\n\n\"Uh Jake\"\n\nMy heart was pounding a mile a minute as he gave my hand a squeeze then he stopped in his tracks and turned to face me still holding my hand firmly.\n\n\"Nat I'm not even going to beat around the bush, I like you. Alot. It's okay if you don't feel the same but I had to tell you, I just-\"\n\nBefore he could finish I cut him off by leaning up to kiss him.\n\n\"I like you too Jake, alot\"\n\nEnd flashback\n\nEver since that day Jacob and I were inseperable, he was my first kiss and the more time we spent together the more I fell for him.\n\n\"Hey Nat, Dad and I are heading into Forks. You remember Bella, Charlie's daughter? Well she's moved in with him and he bought the old pick up truck for her. We're heading over to drop it off\"\n\nHe bent his head down to peck me on the lips before pulling me in for a tight hug.\n\n\"Oh okay, I guess I'll head over to see Embry and Quil\"\n\nBella Swan, I remember when she used to come visit Billy and Jake when she spent the holidays with Charlie. Jake used to have a crush on her back then but she was so timid she didn't realise. We were kinda close back then, maybe we'd be good friends again.\n\n\"We shouldn't be gone all day so I'll give you a call when I get home okay\"\n\nHe spoke as he peppered kisses all over my face.\n\n\"Okay okay get off me slobber face\"\n\nI giggled as I squirmed out of his grasp\n\n\"I love you Nat\""
