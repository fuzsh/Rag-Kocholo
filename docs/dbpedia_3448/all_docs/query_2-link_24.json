        "text": "Ezra Ian Carter. Born September 8, 2014 at 11:07 a.m. He was 8 lbs., 7 oz. and 20.5 inches long. Nick and I cannot even begin to express the amount of love we have for our sweet baby boy. God gave us more than we could have ever asked for or imagined in Ezra. He has the sweetest little spirit. It became very evident to us after Ezra’s delivery that God guided us each step of the way, so we wanted to share with you all Ezra’s birth story!\n\nMy due date, September 4th, came and went, and we were left with the news that my body had made no progress in beginning the laboring process. In fact, we were told that a c-section may be inevitable for me due to Ezra being too big for my frame. Nick and I went home that day thinking a scheduled c-section may in fact be God’s plan for how I would deliver our precious boy. Well guess what happened next…\n\nThat next night as we were getting ready for bed, I started experiencing really bad back pain and I just felt “off.” I slept for about an hour and a half and suddenly woke up in a sweat, experiencing nausea, more back pain, and what seemed to be real contractions. Needless to say, I got no sleep that night.\n\nThat next day I started getting things done around the house because I knew Ezra’s arrival was getting close. Later that night Nick started actually seeing my tummy contracting and then letting off. He decided to start timing them. They seemed close together, but not consistent enough. Since I was past my due date (and not to mention since this was my first pregnancy) we decided to go to the hospital and get checked out. The doctors monitored my contractions for about an hour and a half and told me I was dilated one and a half centimeters. They felt confident I was going to have this baby within a 24 hour window. They told me I could either walk the halls of the hospital (this was at 1 a.m. mind you) or I could go home and they would give me a sleeping pill to try and rest. I chose the latter and they told us they would most likely see us the next day. The sleeping pill did not work one bit. I was miserable. The contractions were getting worse and worse.\n\nThat next morning we got up and got ready to head to the hospital. When we got there they hooked me up again to monitor my contractions. I had progressed to 3 cm. I was just shy of being able to get the epidural as they’d like you to be at 4 cm. We walked the halls and tried to progress, but as the hours went by, I could not get past 3 cm. I was miserable. The doctor on call (my doctor was out of town) told me I could either go home and keep laboring, be induced (and still have a likely chance of having an emergency c-section), or schedule a c-section. Now, remember the other doctor I met with on my due date said that a c-section may be inevitable for me… well, this doctor felt like my body was progressing fine on its own and that I had a good chance of delivering naturally, which this hospital is a huge proponent for. As you can imagine, I was completely overwhelmed.\n\nI did not like the fact that all the options were in my hands–I wanted the doctors to tell me what to do. A c-section seemed like the easy choice, but it is still major surgery, and I thought, since my body has tried to do this on its own, shouldn’t I try to do it naturally since God made women’s bodies to be able to do this? Too many options and the fear of choosing the wrong one. So needless to say, I lost it for a few moments.\n\nThe doctor came out in the waiting room where I was discussing the options with family and she told me she didn’t realize how I had labored the last two nights and had gotten absolutely no sleep. She explained I needed to get rest to even be able to have this baby, so she decided to put me on some even stronger medicine to knock me out and get me rested. Now, that sounded good to me! So that night they admitted me in a room and I rested. I could not have food for 8 hours in case I was to have a c-section. The nurse woke me up at midnight to see if I had progressed any, but I was still at 3 cm. So they asked if I wanted to do the c-section then or if I wanted to wait and talk to my primary doctor that next morning. Once again, I chose the latter and Nick and I tried to rest that night in the hospital.\n\n8 a.m. my doctor walks in and says, “Natalie, I think we should go ahead and do a scheduled c-section. We could induce you, but I think you have a strong chance of laboring really intensely and still having to have an emergency c-section.” I said, “let’s do it.” I was so exhausted at this point, that the thought of more labor made me want to pass out. I felt at peace with my doctor telling me what she believed was best for me. So by 10 a.m., they walked me down to the operating room (which was so surreal!), and they gave Nick some scrubs to change into and he would come in after they numbed me. Walking into the operating room felt just like the movies. The fluorescent lighting, the little operating table in the middle, all the doctors and nurses surrounding with their scrubs and equipment. I began to get super emotional. I think the main thing I was fearful of was losing too much blood since I already knew I was low in iron. I had to just block out the thought that my stomach was about to be sliced open (ah!). They gave me a spinal block and instantly I could not feel any of my lower body. All I could really feel were my arms shaking from how cold the room was and how much medication I was on. I could feel “tugging” on my stomach but nothing painful. Nick walked in shortly after the doctors had come in and started the operation. He sat by my head and rubbed my arms. Soon we heard, “here he is!” And they lifted Ezra up above the curtain and with that first cry, Nick and my eyes flooded with tears. They brought him over where I could see to clean him and do all his measurements. He was just perfect. Then they laid him on my chest…no words can describe this moment! It was the most amazing moment for Nick and me.\n\nShortly after that, Nick and the baby headed back to our hospital room while I had to stay and get sewn back up. They wheeled me in to our room and for the first hour they had me rest and feed Ezra for the first time. After that hour, friends and family were allowed to come in. It was the most amazing time. Lots of laughs and fellowship. Nick and I are so blessed by such amazing friends and family.\n\nEzra was here! He was finally here! And he was absolutely beautiful. Right from the beginning, as soon as I met him face to face, he had the sweetest little spirit. Again I say, God blessed us above and beyond anything we could have asked for or imagined in our son, Ezra.\n\nAfterwards, once we had gotten settled in our postpartum room, we learned of some things and started piecing together how God indeed guided our entire journey. First, having “c-section” put in my mind as a possibility, prepared me mentally. Secondly, keeping me at 3 cm because if I had gone to 4, I would have gotten the epidural and tried to have him naturally–which brings me to my third point, when the doctors first saw him they said, “Oh, oh! You would have never been able to have him naturally due to the size of his head.” So, we knew we had made the right decision going with a scheduled c-section. The doctors also told me that it was good I had labored some because it helped them get to Ezra easier during the operation. We found out too that the umbilical cord was wrapped around his neck, which could have been really bad if I had delivered naturally. It was just SO evident that God kept us at certain points for his perfect plan to be fulfilled–which was my prayer, I wanted God’s way. That’s why I had gotten so emotional when they gave me all the options of how I could deliver–I didn’t want to choose, I wanted God to direct my steps and He SURE did! All the glory and praises go to Him!!!!\n\nWe moved to postpartum and enjoyed it thoroughly. All the nurses were amazing. I got a lot of great help with nursing. The nurses told us they wanted Ezra to have at least two good feedings and two good diapers in the first 24 hours and he had 8 good feedings and 8 good diapers (haha!). By the way, this hospital doesn’t have a nursery either so Ezra was with us from the beginning and stayed in our room. So before we got home we had already gotten a little routine down. Nick and I adopted one of our nurses 😉 she was the best! Nick was the biggest help, he took care of me AND the baby for the first couple days because I could not get out of bed due to my surgery. The first few days were rough and a little painful, but I am recovering GREAT–once again, all glory to God!!!\n\nWell there you have it, Ezra Ian’s birth story. He has been such a blessing to our lives already. He truly is perfect for us. Nick is the best dad and I am thoroughly enjoying being a mother. Every time I look at our sweet boy I still can’t believe he was inside of me. The miracle of birth is like nothing else. It truly shows the mighty and magnificent hand of God and how great and gracious He is!\n\nSome of you may know, Nick and I actually met indirectly two years before meeting at BCF. Later we found these photos on his Dad’s Facebook page and it blew our minds. How cool! 🙂 He’s in the red shirt and I’m in the blue…we don’t remember each other at all haha…\n\nSince August of 2010, Nick and I have been on quite a journey. God is writing such a beautiful story for us, one of humility, love, forgiveness, restoration, freedom, and joy. Through my relationship with Nick, the Lord has shown me that He knows me even better than I know myself, and that He has placed desires in me that I didn’t even know about until I met Nicholas Ian Price Carter. 🙂\n\nNick and I were raised in completely different worlds. Although I come from a broken home, the Lord has blessed me with a rather stable life and family. Looking back, I can only explain the person I am today as a result of God’s grace. His grace is the only thing that has kept me from experiencing much of what the world throws at you in your teenage years. We hear people say, “This person has an awesome testimony, he/she used to do all of these bad things, and is now living for Jesus!” And then we hear people say, “My testimony isn’t anything special, I was raised in church and got saved at an early age, big deal.” Well, my testimony is the latter, and I am so thankful! At age eleven I felt conviction for my sin and from that moment on, I committed my life to following Christ. Let me be clear, by NO means am I claiming to be perfect, quite the contrary actually. I am the worst of sinners, in fact what I struggle with most is the disgusting sin of pride. I am constantly having to reexamine my life and check myself from being like the Pharisees. I am saved by grace alone.\n\nNick has the opposite story. He comes from a background of abandonment, abuse, and things I never dreamed experiencing at such a young age. Tears stream down my face when I think about how thankful I am that God has kept him alive and transformed him to be the man he is today. Growing up Nick turned to things that didn’t satisfy him and was on a downward spiral to destruction, when God encountered him at age sixteen. Since then, Nick has been completely transformed and changed by the Gospel of Jesus Christ. That is what I love about Nick the most, and what inspires me in my faith, is this complete transformation. It is funny to reminisce with his family about “old Nick,” because the Nick I know is nothing like that! It is simply amazing how God can change any life and turn around any situation for His glory.\n\nGod certainly had a plan for Nick and me. It’s been remarkable to see how God has used our relationship to mold us and refine our impurities in order to be the people He is calling us to be. God has used Nick to teach me humility. When I first met Nick I was very judgmental and stuck up. It sounds terrible to say, but it’s true, I only talked to people who looked like me. Nick taught me to love everybody, no matter what they looked like. Nick loves everyone he comes into contact with; it’s one thing I love about him. The Lord has used me in Nick’s life too, to help humble him, to help him trust and break down walls, and deal with other struggles as well. We realize that we are going to let each other down, as we will let others in our lives down too, but God will never let us down, and allowing Him to break us and build us back up is beautiful. Nick and I want people to see the Gospel manifested in our relationship. The world will tell you, “If that person you’re dating struggles with this sin, that’s a red flag, you need to run in the opposite direction.” We are here to tell you that our relationship is defined as two sinners saved by God’s grace alone.\n\nNick started pursuing me his first semester here at BCF. To skip the mushy stuff, I fell pretty hard after I made him pursue me for a while. 🙂 Around New Years Nick’s past started creeping up and the fear of the unknown became very overwhelming. We took the next semester apart, trying to find more of who we were in Christ separately. About six months later we realized both of our hearts hadn’t changed for each other and decided to pursue a relationship again. We had our struggles breaking down walls and trusting the Lord through it all, but we grew so much, in the Lord, and together.\n\nThis past summer was…well…a HUGE test of faith. At some point in your relationship you get to the point where talking about marriage becomes something you’re actually going to do…or not do. This summer Nick was in a whirlwind of confusion. He knew what he wanted, but he was bombarded with stress, responsibility, differing opinions, the burden of becoming the man everyone seemed to be expecting, preparing to lead a woman for life, being reminded of past struggles, and spiritual warfare undoubtedly.\n\n“For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood,\n\nbut against the rulers, against the authorities,\n\nagainst the cosmic powers over this present darkness,\n\nagainst the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.”\n\nEphesians 6:12\n\nIt was very clear that at this point, God needed to intervene and deal with us individually. Looking back, I am beyond thankful for this time apart. I’ve never depended on God so much, and really had to decide, “Was I going to stand on my faith and trust God, or crumble and feed into the devil’s lies?” It was by no means easy, probably the hardest thing I’ve ever had to go through, but is was without question, the most intimate, joyous, and satisfying time I’ve ever experienced in my walk with the Lord. He really is all we need, and I needed to learn this. I got to a point where I gave Nick completely over to the Lord’s control and prayed earnestly, believing that no matter what would happen, God’s plan is best. At this point I had no idea how Nick was feeling, if his heart had changed, or if he had moved on. I knew, just like Abraham was willing to sacrifice his son Isaac, I needed to be willing to let go of Nick if that was what God wanted. Nick and I had very minimal contact during these months, and none whatsoever during the month leading up to the moment he would ask to speak with me.\n\nI believed God could change my heart and my feelings if He wanted to, so I prayed and prayed. My feelings never even lessened, they were just as strong for Nick as they were before. Soon God opened up the door for Nick and I to meet in person and discuss what God had been teaching us. Nick explained that his heart had not changed either and expressed such remorse, and humility that he was terribly sorry for the way he acted this summer. Nick got the awesome opportunity to intern at a church in High Springs, FL this fall semester, and it has been such a growing, equipping, and eye-opening season for Nick as he has been continuously prayed over, supported, and taught how to be the man God’s calling him to be. It is absolutely incredible what God is doing through Nick and others in their ministries at First Baptist High Springs.\n\nMy reply to Nick was, “Show me.” I explained to him that I was very focused on what God was leading me to do with my life and if he was supposed to be in it, he needed to put action to his words. God has always enabled me to love and understand Nick, and just as God extended his grace to me, I extended that grace to Nick.\n\nOn October 14, 2012 Nick showed me his commitment to me by asking me if I would choose to do life with him in marriage. We were at his church for an event called, “Heehaw.” Me being a city girl from Jacksonville, I felt very out of place, haha. Dede, the youth pastor’s wife told me where we were all sitting, explaining that she was to my right and Nick would be on my left. We ate dinner and then I, being the social butterfly that I am, began socializing with people around the gym. Dede’s son, Grant kept coming up to me saying, “Natalie, the show’s about to start.” I thought that was a little strange, but didn’t pay it much thought. Even Nick’s family was there, and I didn’t find that strange either because they had come to visit before. Well I eventually made it back to my seat, and actually looking back on it now, I sat in Nick’s seat and Dede patted my seat with her hand and told me to scoot over. I just thought she really wanted to sit by me. 😉 Nick sang Old McDonald in the show, it was hilarious! The entire Heehaw show was hysterical! Finally at the end, the youth pastor Billy got up on stage and announced that we were going to do a raffle. There were two raffle tickets taped under two of the five hundred chairs in the gym, so we all looked under our chairs to see if we’d won. I had won! I thought to myself, “I have never won a raffle, yay!!!!!” The two winners, Tyler Mikell and myself walked up on stage to claim our prizes. Tyler opened his envelope first; it was a Starbucks gift card. I started to get excited. I then proceeded to open mine and found a letter. Embarrassed, I noticed Nick’s handwriting and asked Billy, “Am I supposed to read this?!” He replied: “READ IT!” The crowd laughed and I began reading the letter. The end of it read: “I am ready to spend the rest of my life with you, will you marry me?” The crowd gasped, as did I! I was SO surprised! Nick came from behind the haystacks and got down on one knee. My answer to him was, “Yes!” But in my head I was screaming “Of course, of course!!!!” I have loved Nick since the first time we started pursuing a relationship and I have never doubted that he is the person I want to spend the rest of my life with here on earth.\n\nOur story is exactly that, our story. It’s perfect for us. God has shown us His faithfulness, His protection, His grace, and so much more throughout our journey. I praise God that Nick and I have remained pure and that God is going to bring us together as one very soon, May 25, 2013 to be exact. 🙂 The ups and downs have taught us so much, and our times apart were always a matter of Nick’s steadfast desire to truly seek out God’s will for his life—and I am so thankful for that. Now we are ready to embark on this life together. 🙂 When I said our story was a story of humility, love, forgiveness, restoration, and joy, I mean that God has truly refined us through His fire and will continue to do that so we can better serve Him with our lives. God has enabled Nick and me to love each other, because He first loved us, and to forgive each other as Christ forgives. The battle is not between flesh and blood, and God has truly restored Nick and I in His perfect timing. Our journey is unique, it is our own, and it shows the Gospel message, which is all I could ever want. May God alone receive the glory and continue to be glorified through our lives and our marriage. Thank you so much for reading. 🙂\n\n“Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins.” 1 Peter 4:8\n\nWaiting. Waiting. Still waiting.\n\nWe are all waiting; waiting for that next step of life. No matter what stage of life, every person is ultimately waiting for something. For the student, it may be finishing up school and starting one’s career. For the single person, it could be finding “the one.” For the married couple, it may be planning to have children. For the older person, it could be retirement. For the Christian, it’s longing to be united with Christ.\n\nAs a person goes through life, it always seems different than one expects. Expectations. Mmm. I have too many of them. I expect a lot and am constantly being disappointed. My expectancy should be in Christ alone because his love never fails. His promises are my only guarantee, and I am so very thankful for that fact. But even though I know where I’m going, I know the end of the story, I know the victory is won…what do I do now? In the midst of waiting and always longing for that next thing, what if it’s not about that? What if it’s only about one man and becoming more and more like him. In studying the Proverbs 31 woman I have been challenged to stop waiting. To stop longing for that next step of life. To stop trying to find “the one.” I’ve been challenged to be the one, and I think this is exactly what these verses infer. We need to be the man or woman of God that he has called us to be. We need to be prepared. A godly man or woman wants to marry a godly person. So who can find that godly spouse one desires? Be “the one.”\n\n“A wife of noble character who can find? She is worth far more than rubies.” Proverbs 31:10\n\nReferring to godly men, a friend of mine recently said, “all the good ones are already taken!” I have heard this several times and have probably thought it myself. It can be hard to find men or women who truly love and fear the Lord. In studying about the Proverbs 31 woman, I wanted to understand the context of the word, “noble.” Being some-what of a nerd, I took out the concordance and did a word study. 😉\n\nThe word “noble” here in Proverbs 31:10 comes from the Hebrew word “hayil” meaning strength, capability, skill, valor, etc. The woman described here is a woman of great moral strength. I would describe my Grandmother as a very strong lady and my Mom and her sister would certainly agree. A woman of noble character is one who doesn’t strive to be seen, but works behind the scenes, living for an audience of One. The verse goes on to say, “she is worth far more than rubies.” She is valuable; she is rare. This challenges me to go against the flow of society, to not be like every one else, to simply be me. God made all of us unique and so many times we try to act like someone else. Comparing myself to others has always been something I struggle with. A lie that the devil has instilled in me since I was young. It’s a constant battle to not compare my life to someone else’s. One commentary said that the “rubies” here may refer to the pink pearls found in the Red Sea, which were of great value to the ancients. We are all of great value to the Lord. He values us so much that he sent his son to die a brutal death on a cross as a sacrifice for our sin. I think this verse should challenge us to also value ourselves and strive to be all we can be. So many times I just do enough to “get by.” I hear a lot of college students say, “a D is fine because I still get my diploma.” God calls us not to be lazy and settle for good, but to work hard and trust him because he wants greatness for us.\n\nWho can find a virtuous woman? In our culture, girls find their beauty and self worth in celebrities and what Hollywood tells them is attractive. We all should strive to be a “rare gem,” only living to meet God’s standard, not what the world considers valuable. The outward appearance of the woman in Proverbs 31 isn’t mentioned. We can conclude however, that her inner beauty was so beautiful in the Lord’s sight and so rare.\n\nI feel overwhelmed at times when I think about striving to be all that God wants me to be. I know I have potential, but I find myself trying to take on too much, and then having to quit because I can’t handle it. I have learned that we can’t do everything, but we can do something. We hear of a lost world that is dying without hearing the Gospel. I find myself wanting to go so bad that I am not taking the opportunities now in America to be missional. We focus a lot on numbers, but I think we should realize that praying hard for one person, their salvation and intentionally witnessing to them is extremely important. God cares about every soul.\n\nFinally, we are called to “come close.” A good friend of mine reminded me of this last night. We need to “come close” to Jesus and live to become more and more like him. We are called to a Person first. What if we lived like that? Before you find, BE the man or woman God has called you to be and draw close to him.\n\nThe word change always stirs up emotions inside of me when I’m forced to confront it. The truth is, change is inevitable. Change happens every day whether good or bad.\n\nRecently I have had to face the reality of both my grandparents passing away within a year of each other. Losing my Grandfather was beyond difficult for me as he was more of a father figure in my life. Yet I must say losing my Grandmother has been the hardest thing I have ever had to deal with. To me this sounds silly, especially when you think about all the people who have been abused in their life, or have dealt with much worse things than I have. But I must be honest and say, I am struggling. When a memory of her pops into my mind, I immediately cast it out. I know this is not good and I have just now begun to allow God to fix my brokenness. He continues to remind me of how merciful he is. My Grandma and Grandpa both knew the Lord and he took them home so graciously. My Grandparents on my Dad’s side however, do not know the Lord. How merciful God is to allow me more time to reach out to them!\n\nI want this blog to be in honor of my Grandmother. She was such an amazing woman, which I witnessed growing up and continue to realize even after her passing. She truly possessed qualities of the Proverbs 31 woman as she feared the Lord, provided for her family and worked extremely hard. I will cherish her always.\n\nRight now in my life I am having to make some hard changes and discipline myself. No one likes the word discipline, but it is so necessary for Christians as they walk with the Lord. I want to grow and be the woman God wants me to be. I commit this semester to the Lord as I am giving up every plan I have set for myself. I want only what he wants because I know that his plan is perfect and my life exists solely to bring him the glory he deserves. I want to grow in even basic areas too, such as cooking, simply picking up after myself, being punctual, keeping up with balancing my check book, working hard with my hands and so on. My desire is to be able to love and serve a family of my own one day. I pray that as I journey through and dissect the verses of chapter 31 in Proverbs, that God would conform me and whoever may be reading this, more to his image. I pray he would enable me to discipline myself in acquiring the virtuous qualities of the Proverbs 31 woman and that he would be glorified in everything I do, even if it’s trying out a new recipe and completely messing up the dish. 😉\n\nNow I know the Proverbs 31 woman isn’t believed to be one woman, but possibly several women, however, she embodies qualities every Christian woman should strive for. Godly women are hard to find as the world denounces such virtuous attributes, rather screams the opposite. The process of sanctification and becoming a godly woman is not going to be easy. It is a daily battle with our nature. For many years I saw my Grandmother work really hard, never cutting corners, not always being recognized for her efforts, but understanding that she works only for the Lord. I saw the sweat on her brow many times and I hope one day to be like her. Next entry: Proverbs 31:10. Who Can Find a Virtuous Woman?"
