        "text": "FLINT, Michigan\n\n— Kadeem Carter wanted to go to Grand Valley State University and was scheduled to visit the campus April 11.\n\nHe was\n\non April 10.\n\nThe 20-year-old Northern High School graduate is among the 55 people killed in Flint this year through Dec. 30.\n\n(Update: Another shooting death took place Dec. 31 and the victim of an earlier shooting died Jan. 1, bringing the 2011 total to 57.\n\n)\n\n“I still have the parking permit,” his father, Edgar Carter, said about the planned college visit. “He was one day away from what he wanted to do.”\n\nCompared with\n\n, 2011 was less violent, particularly in the past six months, which saw a 23 percent drop in homicides from the first half of the year.\n\nStill, this year’s per-capita homicide rate is well above what it was in 1986, when the previous high number of homicides — 61 — took place.\n\nIn 1986, the city had a population of 146,000, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The per-capita homicide rate was 41.7 slayings per 100,000 residents.\n\nThe 2011 rate was 53.7 per 100,000.\n\n“This year has been very difficult,” said Kadeem Carter’s mother, Cynthia Carter, 50. “It’s been really hard for my family. He was a lovable person. He had a lots of friends, young and old. When people come in contact with Kadeem, they automatically fall in love with him. ...\n\n“I just want to heal from this and hope that 2012 will bring some answers, some closure and some justice.”\n\nwas found dead of wounds from an assault rifle alongside another slain youth, 17-year-old Devon McCaskill, inside a crashed car on Dupont Street near Hamilton Avenue, according to police.\n\nNo arrests were made in the case. The same is true of 34 other cases.\n\nThe two victims were among 22 people younger than 25 who were killed in Flint this year. Seven of them were teenagers.\n\nCarter was a 2009 Northern graduate who was looking to restart his education when he was killed in one of the hardest-hit areas of the city.\n\nfor his exploits on the football field and basketball court, and for his passion for “watching out for the underdog.”\n\n“He was a strong, athletic person, very altruistic,” Edgar Carter said of his son. “He was definitely a helper. He always lent a hand to the most destitute that he knew. I think the other passenger in the vehicle was someone he was trying to help.”\n\nThe youngest person killed this year was 4-month-old Nahari Henderson, who police said was\n\nJan. 14.\n\nHer\n\n, pleaded guilty to second-degree murder in October and was sentenced this month to 15 to 30 years in prison, according to court records.\n\n, a 79-year-old civil rights pioneer, was the oldest homicide victim in 2011. He was\n\nJune 17.\n\nRenee Williams, a client of Robinson and person of interest in the case, was\n\n, but she has not been charged in his slaying.\n\nRobinson was not the only senior killed this year.\n\nLonnie Thomas, a 76-year-old retired sheriff’s lieutenant, was\n\nAug. 6 during a break-in.\n\n, were arrested in his slaying.\n\nJewel Baxter, 66, was\n\nSept. 3 on Gloucester Street.\n\nEddie Simmons, 32, was\n\n. Police believed Baxter had come to the aid of a woman being assaulted by Simmons when he was killed.\n\nAnd\n\n, 68, another well-known community activist, was killed in his Kansas Avenue home in an apparent robbery July 9.\n\nDespite\n\nfor a witness to come forward with information, there have been no arrests in the case.\n\nThe 55 homicides were\n\nwas by far the north-side neighborhoods between Welch Boulevard and Pierson Road.\n\nThe first half of 2011\n\n, at 31.\n\nOver the summer, a slew of federal, state, city and\n\nbegan rolling out in desperate waves to fight the problem.\n\nCity officials\n\nof crimes.\n\nFed-up residents\n\nto man mini-stations and help free officers from non-patrol duties.\n\nGov. Rick Snyder\n\ninto the city and arranged the transfer of some inmates out of the overcrowded Genesee County Jail.\n\nAnd the U.S. attorney’s office also\n\nat the county jail by prosecuting some firearms offenders in federal court.\n\nFewer people were killed in the second half of the year — 24.\n\n“It’s better than it was before, but it can still get much better,” said police Chief Alvern Lock. “It’s just a combination of all of us working together, along with citizen participation.”\n\nLock is not overenthusiastic about the small mark of progress.\n\nAnd neither is Edgar Carter.\n\n“I really don’t see it as progress because they really don’t have nothing going on to slow it down or actually stop it,” said Carter, 52. “Things aren’t in place to correct the city’s situation.\n\n“It’s going to be a long, long road because all the elements that cause the problem are still here and nobody seems to be addressing them. ... I’d like to see 15 or 20 more detectives. I’d like to see some of these vacant schools opened up and have some recreation activities for all these young people out here. ... They’re worried about the\n\nbottom line.”\n\nSnyder and the man he appointed this year to get the city’s finances in order, emergency manager Michael Brown, have\n\nand\n\nfinding more cooperative, innovative public safety strategies.\n\nBut Les Key, a Flint teacher who coached Kadeem Carter when he was a standout, undersized, overachieving linebacker at Northern, said that without money to put more police on the streets, residents need to step up.\n\n“You can’t make chicken salad out of chicken feathers,” he said. “The city is doing what they can ... but the citizens here cannot be afraid of the criminal element, and that is an issue. People are afraid to say what they saw and who did it. If we go by the no-snitch rule, the criminals win.”\n\nIf, Key said, Kadeem Carter, who had two loving, married parents and all the support in the world, could fall victim to violence in the city, anyone can.\n\n“I mean that is not the kid that you would expect to be murdered,” Key said. “His heart was bigger than life. I feel deeply hurt for that family. He was a great kid. ... We have to value life a lot more in this city.”"
