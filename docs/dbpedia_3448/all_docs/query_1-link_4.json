        "text": "July 30, 2017\n\nThis short story collection is broken into four sections. Love stories, crime stories, love and crime reprise, and what the author calls epiblog. The first two sections are the majority of the content with the theme of each apparent. The love and crime reprise section contains three stories from previously released collections that fit with the first two sections. However, a note just before the first story resets expectations a touch.\n\n\"These stories are about love and crime, but… reader beware. You may find love in the crime stories and crime in the love stories.\"\n\nI’m guessing there is no need to say that these stories might not fit neatly into whatever pattern you normally picture for a love or crime story. Some, starting with the first, struck me as strange. But on balance most, strange or not, were solid, entertaining reads.\n\nThe epiblog section, the final and shortest of the four sections, has a few brief pieces that were originally blog posts, either on the author’s blog or a guest post elsewhere. They aren’t fiction, but I found them interesting and thought they gave some interesting context to the author’s writing, not only the stories in this book, but her other books as well.\n\n**Originally written for \"Books and Pals\" book blog. May have received a free review copy. **\n\nApril 12, 2017\n\nHello Goodreads! I'm not here to post a review about my own work but to channel two exceptional reviews of Love and Crime by other reviewers, and to give you the links to both. Foreword Reviews has given Love and Crime a five-star rating: \"Anyone who appreciates supple writing and fine storytelling will enjoy every minute spent reading these stories.\" Read the rest of the review here: Foreword Review. BlueInk Review gives Love and Crime its top rating, the \"starred\" review: \"[A]ny reader with a love of fine writing in short story format should find pieces to savor among these well-written offerings.\" Find the rest here: BlueInk Review. Most of all, I look forward to reading your impressions of these stories and their characters. Let me know what you're thinking in a review or a message through the contact page of my website!\n\nMay 1, 2017\n\nA collection of yes, Love and Crime stories! The author has the natural ability to bring the reader right into a story. This allows the book to be an easy read for the reader. There is a tendency to move back and forth from past to present and back. I personally found that a little hard to follow but some may truly enjoy that! The author has a gift for writing crime stories. The crime stories (#1 is the BEST in this book!) are the highlight and are the super part of the book. Fans of Hill Street Blues and Law and Order will love the crime Stories!\n\nNow for the story by story thoughts:\n\nLove Stories\n\nStory 1 – Odd, disjointed – not terribly endearing and as a retired Chef I found the premise hard to believe. A further aside, I doubt ANYTHING can make capers taste good. 2.5/5\n\nStory 2 – Unless a story is really gripping, flashback/forward/back * repeat * is disruptive to the flow. In the end, the story was hard to follow and concluded in an unsatisfactory way. 2.5/5\n\nStory 3 (Conference) – HUNH???? I enjoyed the story but never understood it. 3.5/5\n\nStory 4 (Searching for Ear Wax) – The main character is a bitter/jaded woman who simply failed at love. The Anti-Vaxxers in this story cry out for a serial killer to put them out of their misery and free the kid to Children’s Services. NOTE – any relationship that takes one’s interest away from their spouse is an AFFAIR whether there is sex or not. Had a superb Happy Ending! Having the child disappear and get away from the crazy Anti-Vaxxers is good no matter how it happens! 4/5\n\nCrime Stories\n\n1 – Brilliant, evocative. Took the reader quickly into a new world and carries the reader along. Brilliant, the BEST story in the book. A must read! 5/5\n\n2 – (Pure Kill) Fantastic, gritty, realistic, exciting/ a pure page turner!! 5/5\n\n3 – (Day) 4/5 HATED the ending.\n\n4 – (Collectors Find) Very hard to follow and super hard to like the character of Roz. 3/5\n\nThe Extra Stories\n\nZephyr – 3/5 – meandered\n\nCactus Flowers – 3/5 – no point\n\nCat – 3/5 hard to follow\n\nEpiblog – 3/5 Interesting but hard to follow\n\nMy Rating: 3.5 stars\n\nThis review first appeared: https://princessofthelight.wordpress.com\n\nJune 16, 2017\n\nVS Kemanis’s latest collection of thought-provoking short stories fittingly entitled, Love and Crime, showcase her talents as a compelling writer with great imagination.\n\nEach set story is well-conceived, with well-drawn characters, and thoughtful insights about love, life, and yes, crime. The stories are all entertaining and engaging, making for a wonderful read for a quick break in the day.\n\nTake the first story as a great example. The unusual story is about a self-absorbed man named Anderson who patiently waits for his reservation at an exclusive restaurant that everybody raves about – Ole Factory (great name!). His night has come and he dines alone. But he’s unimpressed with the food. He’s more curious about the story of the two owners of the restaurant, two individuals with severe sensory issues who lived a bland life as singles, but found flavor, joy and wonder as a couple. The exchange that occurs on this night out for Anderson still lingers with me long after I’ve read the story.\n\nJune 15, 2017\n\n“Love and Crime: Stories” written by V.S. Kemanis, is a collection of short stories that all focus on themes of romance, passion, crime, and justice (or sometimes injustice). Each story is truly unique, which keeps the collection interesting and makes the reader want to keep reading after each ending. Obviously, being a collection of stories with crime as a central theme, these are not all happy ever after stories, even though there is a focus on love and romance as well. As the forward to the book warns: “These stories are about love and crime, but…reader beware. You may find love in the crime stories and crime in the love stories.” I found this warning to hold true, and felt that most stories were a rich tapestry of emotional colors and experiences. These stories really showcase the author’s background in sociology, criminal justice (both the good and the bad parts), and the professional dance world.\n\nJune 13, 2017\n\nLove and Crime: Stories by V.S. Kemanis is an intriguing collection of stories that depict off the wall human interaction. The first story about Rueben and his wife Rosemary starts off with their restaurant, the Ole Factory, a great play on words. Their story is strange indeed. This story features a somewhat implausible premise but is entertaining nonetheless. Another story features a business conference, and that too has some convoluted and complicated characters, but is thoughtful and provocative. Some of the stories jump back and forth in time, making it a little difficult to keep track of things, but overall, a solid collection and entertaining. Great little vignettes to pick up and read for a quick and fascinating diversion. The best part of these stories is the character development which is well conceived, even for such short works. Highly recommend.\n\nJune 23, 2017\n\nWonderful collections of stories. Each story had me by the seat of my pants and I just had to find out what happened at the end. The author does a wonderful job of providing details and really making the stories come alive for the reader. I found that each story imparted some form of wisdom for the reader making the collection all the better. I couldn’t start a new story without having it complete it in one sitting making this a must read for me. I found that the author does a wonderful job of making the reader forget that these are just short stories and you really become involved with the characters and what will happen at the end. I placed this book in my must keep and reread shelve with the plan to share it with my friend to read and enjoy. I highly recommend this collection of stories.\n\nMay 28, 2017\n\nThis was a goodreads win and I absolutely loved this book. It isn't true crime stories but a collection of well written short stories. The writer draws a reader into her story's immediately and I found every story to be very well written and so interesting that I couldn't put this book down! I have since passed this book onto a friend of mine and so far she is loving it as well. If you get this novel, trust me you won't be disappointed.\n\nJune 3, 2018\n\nEntertaining\n\nI liked this book because each story is different and interesting! We've am of the stories had a delightful twist at the end.\n\nJune 20, 2017\n\nAs someone who adored a previous collection of V.S. Kemanis’ stories (“Dust of the Universe”), I came to “Love and Crime” with high expectations, and I’m happy to report I wasn’t disappointed. I was lying on a beach in Mexico when I read this book, which was probably a mistake. I was so thoroughly transported to other times and places I think I missed a large part of my vacation.\n\nKemanis has delivered another collection of highly original stories – some on love, some on crime, some blending a good measure of both. Once again, the author’s particular talents are on display. These are not cute, pre-fabricated plots with stock characters shoehorned into place. Kemanis serves up a gallery of strikingly original human beings and unexpected storylines. As in all good fiction, these are character-centered tales: the passions and frailties of these people drive the narratives, ensuring their natures are well explored. I suspect the author’s real interest is people, and she brings them radiantly to life.\n\nIn the love stories, we meet Rosemary and Reuben, a couple running a famous Manhattan restaurant where each meal is uniquely crafted to match the diner. In “Weeping Willow” we meet Trisha, wracked with guilt over the fate of a college friend caught up in the Vietnam draft lottery. It’s a story notable for its very deft use of shifting time periods to build to an unexpected climax. We also meet Abigail Priory, a self-doubting academic gifted a moment of insight from an unassuming dinner pal. In “Searching for Earwax” (my favourite here, despite the slightly off-putting title) we meet Lucille Steadman, a retiree and fledgling babysitter, alienated from her husband and daughter, and wondering if her decision to leave wasn’t based on self-deceit.\n\nThe crime stories are no less impressive, and I have the sense that the author is having more fun with her material here. She brings her signature empathy to the task, but with a slightly harder-boiled tone well suited to the subject matter. Her characters are not always likeable, but they are always relatable. Their choices may not be our own, but we can certainly see why they made them.\n\nThroughout this collection, as in her other work, the thematic depth and the sophistication of the treatment are impressive. Whether it’s the social dread of professional networking, decades-old guilt, regret, envy, bitterness, loneliness, longing, or the pre-conditions for a moment of pure connection, Kemanis is always imaginative and insightful in her approach.\n\nInterestingly, this book also includes three stories from previous collections, including one from “Dust of the Universe” – a truly beautiful collection I unreservedly recommend. It also includes blog posts that offer reflections on storytelling, the law, and dance – a field which, like the law, requires discipline, precision and expression. Those are three things you can always depend on V.S. Kemanis to deliver."
