        "text": "Students recently welcomed their parents, families, and friends to the University to celebrate Family Day, an annual and fun event that creates community and connection while fostering Charger Pride.\n\nBy Renee Chmiel, Office of Marketing and Communications\n\nAngela Carter ’24 and Natalie Carter ’24 were excited to spend a recent Saturday with their parents on campus. Their parents had made the trip from Philadelphia to spend Family Day with their twin daughters and to enjoy the many activities offered as part of the event.\n\n“It’s nice to see my parents because I don’t get to go home often,” said Natalie, an exercise science major. “It’s great to have them here and for them to get to see the campus.”\n\n“I am excited to show them my dorm,” added Angela, a business management major who lives in Celentano Hall. “I want them to meet my roommates.”\n\nTheir parents were also excited to spend time with them on campus. Their father, Al Carter, was excited to watch the Chargers football team play, and their mother, Alicia Green-Carter, appreciated getting to see the University.\n\n“It’s great to catch up with my daughters,” said Carter. “We’ve walked around a bit and checked out the bookstore. It’s great to be here.”\n\n“The campus is beautiful,” added Green-Carter. “It’s very inviting and engaging, and it’s great to be here post-COVID.”\n\n‘There are so many cool events’\n\nAn annual event that enables students’ parents, guardians, families, and friends to visit them and explore the campus, Family Day aims to build a sense of community and gives students an opportunity to share with their loved ones the many opportunities and resources the University has to offer.\n\n“Never forget that your parents, guardians, and family members – and those who are like family – are there for you when you need some extra support,” wrote Sheahon Zenger, Ph.D., in an email to students following Family Day, where he interacted with attendees. “They are the ones who helped you get where you are today, and they will always be your biggest fans.”\n\nFamilies made memories together on campus, taking photos with Charlie, at the Charger statue, inside a balloon photo frame, and at a photo booth. Students and their families played lawn games together, enjoyed the interactive inflatables set up in the Bixler Quad, and created intention bracelets – a fun activity that enabled them to take with them a wearable souvenir of Family Day. That was something the Pickow family was excited to do together.\n\nAshley Pickow ’26 just started her first year as a Charger, and she was excited to get to see her parents again and show them the campus.\n\n“I love my parents, and I missed them,” she said. “I was excited to show them the quad where I sit under a tree and have a coffee. I like seeing everyone here with their families. Everyone is really excited, and there’s a lot going on.”\n\nHer parents came from Long Island to take part in Family Day. They enjoyed seeing their daughter and the many activities offered on campus.\n\n“We’re very excited to be here,” said Kelly Pickow, Ashley’s mother. “We missed Ashley. There are so many cool events, and we were especially excited to check out the crafts and the escape room.”\n\n‘I’m meeting so many new people’\n\nFamilies cheered on the Chargers as they faced American International on the gridiron, winning 54-26. That evening, the Chargers men’s soccer team also faced American International, tying 0-0.\n\nFamily Day was an opportunity for families to tour residence halls and visit the Myatt Center for Diversity and Inclusion, which hosted an open house. The University community made sure families felt welcome, and many staff members and students – including Prudhviraj Boddu ’24 M.S. – were on campus to welcome them with a smile."
