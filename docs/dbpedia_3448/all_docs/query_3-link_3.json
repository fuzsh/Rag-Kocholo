        "text": "Helena Douglas is a survivor. For three months, two weeks, and five days, a madman held her captive, but she escaped. Barely alive and mentally exhausted, she finds the strength to put one foot in front of the other until she is rescued. For the next days, months, and years, Helena fights to regain her life, such as it is. Before this ordeal, she was already running from a previous life filled with heartache and pain, and now she must overcome an ordeal so horrific she still can’t talk about it, because there’s one piece of Helena’s story that isn’t finished—her abductor has never been caught.\n\nShe’s certain he’s out there, waiting and watching for the perfect moment to pick up where he left off with her. Eight years later, that moment has arrived. A body has been found, and the DNA doesn’t lie. He’s back, and now Helena, along with her confidant, David Campbell, has the chance to stop him.\n\nBut there’s a catch.\n\nThe evidence is leading Helena back to Deer Lake, the town where her life started to unravel and the place she vowed never to return. Going home brings a flood of memories, most of which she’d just as soon forget, but after all these years, she’s learning things weren’t exactly as they seemed back then. Sorting through the past and discovering new truths has Helena wondering if a bargain she made with God years ago is the reason behind every horrible thing that has happened since."
