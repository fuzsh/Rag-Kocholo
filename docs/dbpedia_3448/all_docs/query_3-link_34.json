Jenner’s fans will love this.” —Publishers Weekly\n\n“I’m in awe of Natalie Jenner’s new novel, which surprised me at every turn. At times it reads like the juiciest historical tell-all, boasting cameos by enduring household names like Sophia Loren and Gina Lollobrigida, and featuring a party where Ava Gardner dances on the table. But most importantly [this] beautiful book balances and explores the most heroic aspects of humanity, and by extension the most evil. Every Time We Say Good Bye is a heartbreaking, engrossing, and thoroughly dazzling work of art that would make the filmmakers at the center of its story proud.” —Nina de Gramont, New York Times and #1 Sunday Times bestselling author of The Christie Affair\n\n“Jenner plunges readers into a glittering world of cinema, censorship, and complex relationships in postwar Italy in her third novel, Every Time We Say Goodbye.
