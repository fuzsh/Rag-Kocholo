        "text": "Michelle Carter is a free woman, and the debate over whether she ever should have been charged with a crime at all continues.\n\n\"I was surprised that she even got 11 months,\" Lynn Roy told People in an interview ahead of the March 29 premiere of the Hulu drama The Girl From Plainville, which revisits the events leading up to her 18-year-old son Conrad Roy III's death by suicide in 2014 and the fallout that ensued.\n\nBut Lynn was \"satisfied\" by Michelle's conviction, she said. \"I wanted to make a point that [Conrad's] life mattered, and that was the most important thing to me.\"\n\nMichelle was 17 when Conrad died and 20 when a judge found her guilty of involuntary manslaughter for telling him on the phone to get back in the car and finish the job when he called to tell her his plan to poison himself seemed to be working and he was scared.\n\nAcknowledging the \"extremely tragic material\" at the heart of the series, Elle, who's also an executive producer, said on Live With Ryan and Kelly March 29, \"We really had to treat this story with a lot of sensitivity, obviously. I think the media also really painted this case in a one-dimensional way and we wanted to go deeper inside that and get to know a little bit more about it.\"\n\nFor the 23-year-old actress who \"grew up in the age of phones\" and \"that false sense of reality that you get when you're texting and that instant gratification that we all receive,\" Elle added, \"I think for us we wanted to shed a light on the struggles that young people are facing today, especially with technology and, in this case, how harmful it can be.\"\n\nOr, in this case, fatal.\n\nMichelle and Conrad \"were each other's confidante,\" Erin Lee Carr, director of the two-part documentary about the case I Love You, Now Die, told E! News when the film premiered on HBO in 2019. \"I think that you consistently see Michelle Carter reaching out to people for support and Conrad was sort of like this friend that was always in her ear. They communicated so much at these crazy intense intervals, and they really shared things that they had not shared with others.\"\n\nCarr set out to paint a more complete picture of what happened, wanting to avoid the broad brush Michelle was being painted with in the media, the assumption that she was some sort of femme fatale. The filmmaker told E! that, while she started the project with the opinion that Michelle's actions were \"amoral and illegal,\" by the time she was finished she felt there were \"reasons to doubt the conviction.\"\n\nMichelle and her family did not participate in the documentary, but Conrad's did. Carr told E! that Lynn Roy telling her she had done a good job, after they arranged a preview screening for her at the HBO office, was the best feedback she could possibly get.\n\nConrad's last text to Michelle came in at 6:25 p.m.: \"okay I'm almost there.\"\n\n\"Okay,\" Michelle wrote at 6:28. At 9:19 p.m. she wrote, \"Please answer me.\" And then \"I'm scared are you okay? I love you please answer.\"\n\nAt 10:38 p.m. Michelle wrote, \"You're at your dad's...Camdyn told me. I'll get you help soon I guess.\" And \"I thought you actually did it.\"\n\n\"He called me and I heard like muffled sounds and some type of motor running and it was like that for 20 mins and he wouldn't answer,\" Michelle wrote in a text to a friend at 9:24 p.m. \"I think he killed himself.\"\n\nAuthorities found Roy's body in the afternoon on July 13. He had driven his truck to the parking lot of a Kmart in Fairhaven, Mass., and there was a gasoline-operated water pump in his backseat. Cause of death was determined to be carbon monoxide poisoning.\n\nOn Sept. 13, Michelle organized a suicide-prevention fundraiser at King Philip High School, her senior year just underway.\n\nOn Sept. 15, Michelle wrote in a text to a friend (later used as evidence at her trial), \"His death is my fault like honestly I could have stopped him I was on the phone with him and he got out of the car because it was working and he got scared and I f--king told him to get back in.\"\n\nIn the lengthy message, she also wrote that she couldn't stand seeing Conrad in so much pain, and that therapy \"didn't help him.\" She had tried to get him to check into a mental health facility with her, Michelle added, \"but he would go in the other department for his issues but he didnt wanna go because he said nothing they would do or say would help him or change the way he feels.\"\n\nShe continued, \"So I like started giving up because nothing I did was helping and but I should of tried harder like I should of did more and its all my fault because I could of stopped him but I f--king didnt all I had to say was I love you dont do this one more time and hed still be here and he told me he would give me signs to know he is watching over me but I havent seen any and I just idk I'm sorry about this rant I just needed to get that off my chest and its finally all sinking in.\"\n\nThe Fight Continues\n\nWhen Michelle's initial appeal to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court was denied in 2019, a unanimous decision, Justice Scott Kafker wrote in the ruling, \"After she convinced him to get back into the carbon monoxide filled truck, she did absolutely nothing to help him: she did not call for help or tell him to get out of the truck as she listened to him choke and die.\"\n\nMichelle's lawyer Daniel Marx told reporters, \"Today's decision stretches the law to assign blame for a tragedy that was not a crime. It has very troubling implications, for free speech, due process and the exercise of prosecutorial discretion, that should concern us all.\"\n\nShe reported for jail in February 2019.\n\nThe Latest\n\nLynn had not seen any of The Girl From Plainville, expressing dismay that \"there may be an attempt to defend some of [Michelle's] needless and evil actions.\" Yet she hoped more people would become aware of her son's fate and the ongoing effort to pass Conrad's Law.\n\nSince Michelle's release from jail in January 2020, Bristol County Sheriff's Office spokesman Jonathan Darling calling her a \"model inmate\" who got along well with others and had no disciplinary issues, the terms of her release included that she be unable to profit from media interest or other publicity of her case.\n\nHer probation is due to end Aug. 1, 2022, after which that no longer applies."
