        "text": "Director\n\nDarragh Mackin\n\nDarragh Mackin has been described as ‘a rising star on the international legal scene’ (Irish Times) and a ‘Champion of the Cause’ (The Parchment). In July 2016, Darragh was the first ever Ireland based Lawyer to be nominated, and in turn to win, an award at the prestigious London Legal Aid Lawyer of the Year Awards.\n\nHe has developed a specialist practice in Human Rights, Public Law, Actions against Public Authorities and International law. He continues to appear in some of the most complex Inquests and Inquiries in Ireland, acting for 47 of the families in the Stardust Inquest, appearing in the Ballymurphy Inquest, the family of Morgan Barnard who was killed in the Greenville tragedy, and for the victims in the the child abuse Bill Kenneally public inquiry.\n\nHe regularly advises individuals and companies both domestically and internationally, with a particular specialism in data protection and privacy. Darragh recently advises on reputation management and the challenges emanating from the misuse of social media, GDPR, and an individual’s ‘right to be forgotten’ online.\n\nHe has acted in cases at all levels including in the Supreme Courts in London and Dublin, The European Court of Human Rights, the African Commission on Human Rights and the United Nations Special Procedures. He has acted for both individuals, companies and some of the most well known non-governmental organisations including Amnesty International, the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, and Extinction Rebellion. He has been instructed and advised on cases all around the World, including the USA, Spain, France, Sri Lanka, Malawi and the Cayman Islands. He also appears on behalf of a number of Basque prisoners currently pending consideration by the European Court of Human Rights.\n\nDarragh was instructed for the NI Taxi Drivers group which resulted in the payment of £16.7million to NI Taxi Drivers, one of the largest in NI history. He is also currently instructed in a multi million pound claim in the Dublin Commercial Court arising out of the approach by insurance companies to indemnifying hotels during the Covid 19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition to practice, Darragh is an associate lecturer of Public Law at the University of Ulster and has delivered a number of guest lectures at Cambridge University, Trinity University, Queens University Belfast, and DCU.\n\nNOTABLE CASES\n\nHUMAN RIGHTS & PUBLIC LAW\n\nSarah Ewart & Amnesty International (The Abortion Litigation)\n\nDarragh has appeared in many of the seminal human rights cases in recent times in Ireland.

Darragh initiated Judicial Review Proceedings against the Chief Constable of the PSNI for the failure to conduct an overarching investigation into the allegations of state collusion arising out of the Glenanne Gang murders. In the seminal case of Re Edward Barnard, the Court of Appeal ruled that it was unlawful not to investigate the evidence of state collusion.

In September 2015, the Advocate General announced that a fresh inquest was to be held into the fatal shootings at Loughgall. As a result of a political stalemate, the necessary funding for the legacy inquest system was withheld.

A group of individuals including two British citizens living in France, a Gibraltarian national, a Welsh citizen and Fergal McFerran, president of NUS-USI formed the ‘peoples challenge’.

JR 195 – Challenge to compulsory school start age\n\nThis challenge was brought by a father on behalf of his 4 year old son. His son was born prematurely on 1 July meaning he was on the cut off date to commence P1 as one of the youngest in his year. Northern Ireland has one of the youngest formal schooling start age and no provision for flexibility for extenuating circumstances. The Court upheld the claim confirming the statutory scheme was disproportionate in its operation by reason of its lack of flexibility and, thus, its incapacity to deal adequately with a case where requiring a child to commence full-time education at the current compulsory school starting age is clearly and demonstrably contrary to that child’s best interests. A declaration of incompatibility issued and the child was allow to commence another year at nursery.\n\nMedia here.
