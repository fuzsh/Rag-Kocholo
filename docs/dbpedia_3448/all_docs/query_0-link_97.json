        "text": "Natalie Carter, who grew up in WGC, was presented with the Johnson’s Baby Mum’s Midwife of the Year award by the Royal College of Midwives.\n\nA midwife for two years since graduating from the University of Hertfordshire, Natalie beat the country’s top midwives to the honour.\n\nThe award followed her work at Middlesex University Hospital, where she set up a case loading service – a provision that caters for soon-to-be mothers throughout the entirety of their pregnancy.\n\nOne of her former patients, Samantha Diouf, nominated Natalie for her support during the dramatic five-week-premature birth of her son, Olivier, which entailed an emergency Caesarean.\n\n“Natalie made the very stressful situation quite calm – without her, we would have been in such a panic,” said Samantha.\n\n“In the operating theatre she was by my side, with my husband, holding my hand.\n\n“She ensured I could have skin-to-skin contact with Olivier as soon as possible – something which still helps to calm him today.\n\n“Natalie has been an inspiration and played a big part in Olivier’s life. We are so very grateful. This is a perfect way for us to say thank you.”\n\nHundreds of midwives were nominated for the award by mothers whose lives they have helped, or had an impact on.\n\nEntries were judged by a panel of midwives who considered, among other things, to what extent the midwife demonstrated best clinical practice, support for mum’s emotional care and support for strengthening the bond between mum and baby.\n\nNatalie said of the award: “As a midwife who has one of the mums they looked after take the time out to put me forward for this award is truly amazing and means a lot to me. It shows me that I’m doing a good job.\n\n“I know how challenging and rewarding being a midwife can be and to be recognised in this way is a dream come true. I’m very proud to have been involved and to share the experience with Samantha and the other deserving finalists.”"
