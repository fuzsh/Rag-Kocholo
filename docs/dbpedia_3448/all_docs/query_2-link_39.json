        "text": "A headshot is always a portrait, but a portrait is not always a headshot. Case in point, this moody portrait of Katie (@katieattfieldd), who is an actor. Captured in London, at the fine studio of @tomtrevatt. How do you need to show yourself to the world? What do you want people to think when they first \"meet\" you online? How will you convey the different aspects of your personality, your spark? These are all the sorts of things we think (and talk) about when capturing a portrait of you. Some people may call it branding, but that's just another way of saying how are you showing up in the world and what should people expect when they interact with you and your business?\n\nWant a MAGNET TO ATTRACT dream clients? It's you! Listen... Even if you exude anti-charisma -- hey, it's a thing! -- you can make that lack of charisma part of your personal brand. Own it. Play with with. Make it work for you. Use the following three steps to find your brand. (And because I'm a movie nerd, I'll use Hollywood examples to illustrate.) 1. EMBRACE YOUR QUIRKS Don't hide them. Strut them proudly. Quirks make us memorable and relatable. David Lynch, the American director of Blue Velvet and Twin Peaks, is known for two things: his gee-whiz-golly Midwestern niceness AND the dark, deranged cinema he creates. It's a one-of-a-kind, authentic, unforgettable brand. 2. TELL REAL STORIES Sharing experiences from your life shows what you've done and reveals who you are. This creates genuine connection with people and builds trust. Few filmmakers are as honest about their personal life than Francis Ford Coppola, director of The Godfather and Apocalypse Now. Fans have watched him mortgage his home and risk his fortune to finance risky projects. 3. FLAUNT YOUR SIGNATURE STYLE A distinctive style, one that is instantly recognizable, is gold for a brand. It creates consistency across your work and marks you as a \"presence.\" Sofia Coppola is renowned for her dreamy, atmospheric visual style, measured pacing, and an often melancholic tone in films like Lost in Translation and Marie Antoinette. You'd know her work even if you missed the opening credits. Ok, film fans! Now it's your turn. \"And the award for Best Personal Brand goes to... YOU.\"\n\nOne of the hardest & most challenging parts of owning a business?‚Ä¶ ‚Ä¶ keeping it AUTHENTIC. It is SO easy to look at other brands and 1. Compare 2. Be convinced you need to change your whole strategy. 3. Lose your authenticity. It happened to me at one point but you always need to remember the reason your followers followed you to begin with. There‚Äôs been multiple times I‚Äôve felt the need to switch my brands style to look a certain way or ‚Äúfit in‚Äù but that‚Äôs when you must remember you don‚Äôt want to fit in!!! Be different, be YOU, be unique. Have fun, have personality! We are even seeing huge, luxury brands like Marc Jacob‚Äôs showing more of a fun side! Have you ever felt the pressure to make your brand look a certain way? And lost authenticity in the process?\n\nUNSEEN POST, ENDLESS SCROLLING.ü§†‚ò†Ô∏è Ever think about your brand as your business's cool style? It's like your business's favourite outfit that everyone wants to borrow. Let's talk about why not having a brand is like going to a party. Your brand is like the personality of your business. Your brand is the friendly face in a crowd of strangers. We aim for your business to be remembered positively, not forgotten or overlooked. And you know when you're scrolling through your phone? Your brand is the post that makes you stop scrolling. Without it, your business is like a soft voice in a noisy place. Let's make your business the joyful shout that everyone notices and enjoys! Your brand is basically the story of your business. We've talked about branding, now it's your turn! What's the coolest business name you've come across lately? #branding #business #growth\n\nDon't be a copycat üê± Your brand is like a fingerprint üëâ it's unique. The world doesn't need another cookie-cutter business that blends in with all the rest. So, stop trying to mimic others and find your own voice. üåü Be authentic üåü Be true to your values üåü Be consistent When you build your brand around who you really are, people will flock to you. They'll trust you. They'll want to do business with you. Why? Because authenticity breeds loyalty. What makes your brand unique? Share in the comments below.\n\nAre people having a hard time finding your business? It‚Äôs important to make yourself easily accessible and recognizable. Use your resources and strengths to craft a positive, distinctive brand message and image. At the same time, it‚Äôs important to be authentic. That authenticity could be a game changer in itself to set yourself apart from the crowd. We would love to work with you to help freshen up your identity. Contact us and let‚Äôs start a conversation on the best way to get your organization to rise above the rest.\n\nYou‚Äôre not an amateur. You know what the hell you‚Äôre doing. You‚Äôve helped countless people with your expertise at this point ‚Äì and there‚Äôs nobody quite like you. But does your brand image and personal style show it? Does it show the world exactly what makes you different? Or do you kind of look like an amateur? As a stylist and fashion expert, I can tell you that when you combine your authentic self with a kicka$$ brand image‚Ä¶ People pay attention. üëå A professional brand image doesn‚Äôt mean putting on a suit. ‚ùå Especially if wearing a suit isn‚Äôt your style and doesn‚Äôt reflect who you are on the inside. A professional brand image captures the real you ‚Äì the you that blows your clients‚Äô minds with the transformation you create for them. It makes it easy for you to show up with confidence and showcase your talents, whether you‚Äôre posting on social media, on Zoom with clients, or networking with potential partners. And that means more clients and opportunities to shine. Right now, I‚Äôm taking on a few personal clients and helping them upgrade their brand image for more success, income, and reach. Is this opportunity right for you? It depends. If you want to up level your online and in-person presence with the help of an expert, then yes. If you prefer wearing sweatpants, a hoodie, and a baseball cap whether you‚Äôre coaching clients or mowing the lawn, that‚Äôs cool, but you‚Äôre probably not a fit for this. üòâ This VIP service is the fast track to all the things you‚Äôre striving for in your business. And if you‚Äôve been hitting the ball, but you really want some home runs‚Ä¶ This is for you. Let's talk! üì∑ by Aleksandr Karjaka #thoughtleader #Imageupgrade #personalbrandmakeover"
