        "text": "My new book! So my new book with the current boring working title (it will be changed) of \"False Hustle: The Customer-Centric Revolution in Contact Centers and CX\" is close to going to publish. I will be posting the entire book for free to all of my LinkedIn friends in the coming weeks (or days!?) as I do with all my books. You guys know we love to show the \"process\" of what we do and this book is no different. I want to give you a flavor of it right here, right now, with the first 2ish chapters. These are more on the theory of False Hustle, but I will get into detail on how to train it out of your contact centers deeper in the book. While I do not think this will revolutionize CX (many are already doing this, but most are not though), I am hopeful it gets more people thinking about how customers are treated and how brands need to start letting customers have a say in the experiences they have. Let's get rid of false hustle! Quick note... It's just a PDF here so it's not formatted at all, just wanted to get some initial thoughts from all my friends in the contact center world. Also, I hate the first paragraph...get through that, it's getting reworked...lol #callcenter #contactcenter #callcentergeek #falsehustle"
