        "text": "(Gray News) - The U.S. surfer who was killed during a recent trip to Mexico was set to get married in three months.\n\nAccording to Zola, an online wedding registry, 30-year-old Carter Rhoad was preparing to marry his fiancée – Natalie Weirtz on August 17 in Columbus, Ohio.\n\nWith just 101 days away, the couple planned to have a welcome party with family and friends the evening before.\n\nAuthorities said Rhoad and brothers, Jake and Callum Robinson traveled together to Baja California in April for a surfing trip.\n\nThe three men were allegedly shot and killed by thieves attempting to steal their truck because they wanted the tires, the Associated Press reported. They then allegedly got rid of the bodies by dumping them in a well.\n\nA close friend of Carter and Natalie, created a GoFundMe page to help her during this ‘unimaginable’ difficult time.\n\nShe said the first purpose is to rally support for Natalie to provide her essentials for food, transportation and housing.\n\n“The second is to honor Carter by raising money for scholarships and donations he felt passionate about,” she said. “No donation is too small, and every contribution is deeply appreciated.”\n\nSo far, they have reached over $58,000 of its $250,000 goal.\n\nNumerous donations have been coming as they remember Carter, while also showing love and compassion for Natalie.\n\n“My heart is with you all during this time,” a donor said. “We are all so heartbroken this happened and cannot imagine or fathom the pain. May Carter rest in paradise forever.”\n\nAnother donor said, “There aren’t enough words for the legacy you leave and all the hearts you’ve touched. Love you and I’m going to miss you brother! Till we meet again!”"
