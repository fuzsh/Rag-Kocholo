        "text": "Bryce Berkowitz is a poet and screenwriter based in Indianapolis via Montana, West Virginia, L.A., Chicago, and southern Illinois. He dropped out of college at 19 to book touring hip hop acts until career shifts took him from restaurant worker to Hollywood literary assistant to professor.\n\nBryce is part of Butler’s Inclusion Advocate program, the program coordinator for the Visiting Writers’ Series, and faculty advisor for the Screenwriting Club. His course topics range from Writing for Sustainability to Arts-Based Social Justice to the TV Writers’ Room, and his professional development interests include working with students who have ADHD, as well as innovative and inclusive assignment design that reflect pragmatic applications to the work world.\n\nHe thinks of the classroom as a practice field where students can figure out who they are and what matters to them, where perfection is an illusion that gets in the way of learning, where mistakes are not failures but are instead part of a greater learning process in the journey toward self-discovery.\n\nAs a screenwriter, Bryce is the recipient of the Austin Film Festival AMC TV Pilot Award, a ScreenCraft Fellowship finalist, and an NBC TV Writers’ Program finalist. As a poet, his work has appeared twice in Best New Poets, and he’s the author of Bermuda Ferris Wheel, recipient of the 42 Miles | Indiana University Press Poetry Award.\n\nWhen not teaching, Bryce enjoys watching movies at Kan-Kan, picking up produce at Mad Farmers Collective, attending First Friday art shows, and supporting Indy’s many great lit hubs, including Dear Mom, Tomorrow, Dream Palace, Loudmouth, Golden Hour, and Indy Reads.\n\nFind out more about him at bryceberkowitz.com\n\nNatalie Carter holds a Ph.D. in English with a concentration in American Literature and Culture from George Washington University.

Rocky Colavito (B.A., M.A. St. Bonaventure University; Ph.D. University of Arizona) is trained as a specialist in rhetorical theory and the teaching of writing, and serves as the Department’s Assessment Coordinator. Much of his research considers the interplay between rhetorical theories and popular culture with a specific interest in horror literature and films. His teaching ranges from First-Year Seminar through Texts and Ideas courses on popular culture, a PCA course on writing horror, introductory and specialized courses on professional writing, Speaking Across the Curriculum courses on popular culture subjects, and advanced courses on rhetorical theory, scholarly research and writing, and monster/horror studies. Specific courses include The Culture of Fear, Haunted Spaces and People, The Frankenstein Myth; Vampires and Vampirism, Global Horror Films, Writing about Film, and Zombie Literature and Film. His current research project is a more extended analysis of global Zombie cinema, and he is readying two collections of horror stories (Time to Let the Monsters Out, and This Infernal Process) for publication as e-books. He has presented papers at domestic and international conferences on global zombie cinema, the appropriation of classical literature in The Walking Dead graphic novel series,body horror, Zombie studies/literature for the classroom, and the Sharknado franchise. When not preoccupied with all things horror and popular culture, Dr.Colavito is an avid follower of college sports, a wide and varied reader (he highly recommends Carl Hiaasen, James Ellroy, and Jon Maberry to those interested, and just finished Ezekiel Boone’s The Hatching, the start of series about prehistoric spiders that create a global menace) and is forever seeking to perfect his chili recipe; he reports that the last batch was close to where he wants it.\n\nProfessional Bio\n\nMichael Dahlie teaches in Butler University’s English Department and MFA program. He’s the author of two novels with W.W. Norton and his short fiction has been published in journals and magazines including Harper’s, Ploughshares, and The Yale Review. He’s received the PEN/Hemingway Award and a Whiting Award, and he was a National Endowment for the Arts Literature Fellow in 2020.\n\nTeaching Goals\n\n“My role as a creative writing teacher is to help students say the things they want to say, write about the subjects they think are important, and to do it in a way they value. I assign a wide variety of published work, and my courses emphasize the fact that first-rate narrative comes from a diverse set of sources and in a broad range of forms. Most important, I work hard to ensure my classes give students a sense of belonging, camaraderie, and a feeling of common purpose, all while making sure each person has resources and encouragement to develop and refine their own unique literary vision.”\n\nChris Forhan is the author of three books of poetry: Black Leapt In, winner of the Barrow Street Press Poetry Prize; The Actual Moon, The Actual Stars, winner of the Morse Poetry Prize and a Washington State Book Award; and Forgive Us Our Happiness, winner of the Bakeless Prize.

I prioritize introducing students to diverse voices, particularly writers from underrepresented communities. I believe that bringing in contemporary work from established and emerging writers, from all backgrounds, better reflects the world we live in today—and celebrates it, too. Having once been a new writer myself, I want to guide my students as they find their own voice without being discouraged or feeling isolated from the literary establishment.\n\nAlessandra Lynch, Senior Lecturer/Poet-in-Residence at Butler University, is the author\n\nof four collections of poems, Sails the Wind Left Behind (Alice James Books), It was a\n\nterrible cloud at twilight (LSU Press, winner of the Lena Miles-Wever Todd Award),\n\nDaylily Called It a Dangerous Moment (finalist for the UNT Rilke Prize and the LA\n\nTimes Poetry Book Prize, winner of the 2017 Balcones Prize in Poetry, one of The New\n\nYork Times’ ten Best Poetry Books of 2017) and Pretty Tripwire (Alice James Books).\n\nHer work has appeared in the American Poetry Review, The New England Review, The\n\nKenyon Review,Ploughshares and other literary journals.

In particular, she examines how language bothenables and disables the growth of knowledge and consensus surroundingscientific claims, both inside science and in the public. Her publications on the AIDS epidemic, MadCow Disease or Prion Disease, agricultural chemicals, addiction, and climatechange all demonstrate the tenuous relation between “reality” and the languagewe use to represent that reality. Bias,context, and limited data inevitably lead to imperfect definitions,descriptions, labels, and visuals representations that can easily come to“stand in” for an unexplored or unknown totality. She also explores the struggles scientistsface when they attempt to describe and establish new phenomena, engage incross-disciplinary debates over the nature of a phenomenon, when they areentrenched in high stakes disagreements over threats to the environment andhuman health, when they need to communicate risk to the general public, andwhen they want to change perceptions of stigmatized conditions.\n\nProfessor Reeves’ teaching fields include courses in MedicalHumanities, Political Rhetoric, Scientific Rhetoric, Professional Writing abouthealth and the environment, and Literature.\n\nProfessor Reeves has also made contributions to severalorganizations in Indianapolis and Indiana that have provided opportunities forher students. Working with CAFO Watch,Indiana to increase regulatory oversight for Concentrated Animal FeedingOperations, Reeves has brought many students into the organization as internswho learn about the legislative process and environmental policymaking. She and students worked with the RileyHospital Ryan White Pediatric Infectious Disease department to plan a campaignto create awareness of pre- and peri-natal HIV transmission and the importanceof testing. She and her students alsowork with Women for Change Indianapolis and Planned Parenthood to help buildopportunities for women to access educational opportunities and healthcare and tocombat discrimination.\n\nDr. Sunny (as Dr. Romack prefers to be known) holds a B.A. in English with an emphasis in Creative Writing; a M.A. in English-Literature; and a PhD in English-Rhetoric and Composition.
