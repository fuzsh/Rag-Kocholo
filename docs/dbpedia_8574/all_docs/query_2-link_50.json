        "text": "A patriarch (Chabi Biswas) runs his household sternly. His son (Soumitro) brings home a daughter-in-law after marriage. The man has a dream that his daughter-in-law (Sharmila Tagore) is a goddess. A strange incident occurs whereby a sick child gets cured when brought to her.\n\nPredictably when she is put on a divinely pedestal, things go wrong. .. A sequence depicts the patriarch falling at the feet of his daughter-in-law. Even when she tries to flee with her husband, she returns after witnessing an image of a goddess lying on a river bank. This expose on religious superstition is based on a story by Prabhat Mukhopadhyay. The film is directed by Satyajit Ray, and music is scored by Ali Akbar Khan.\n\nAn interesting trivia is that the Brahmo director composed a Shyama Sangeet in this film.\n\nRating: 3 out of 5\n\nThis film was released in 1993, an Indo-Bangladesh production. Padma Nadir Majhi (Boatman of the river Padma) is based on a classic novel by Manik Bandopadhyay. The work is based on the life of fishermen, who eke out a living from the catches they make from the unpredictable river Padma. The hopes and aspirations, despair and grief and longings for a better life of this downtrodden community has been well brought out by the Director. The abject poverty which stares in the face of these beleaguered people almost every day has been skillfully woven into the narrative of this film.\n\nIn the past, there has been two significant films made on the life of fisher folks in Bengali films. They include Ritwik Ghatak’s Titas Ekti Nadir Naam and Rajen Tarafdar’s Ganga. So, this work by Gautam Ghosh can be considered in a series of trilogy on fishermen.\n\nThe film has been shot both in India and Bangladesh. The central character is Kubir played by Asaad who is a tall, strapping fisherman. Initial sequences depict the exploitation of these hapless people, where their catches made after a lot of struggle hardly earns them the money in the market. Even residents from neighborhood take away fishes from them without paying on several occasions. It is indeed a hard life for them.\n\nEnters Hossian Miya (Utpal Dutt), a trader who offers to take this community to Moynadeep and offer them a better life there. It is apparent that Hossian Miya has a flourishing business there, because he has recently purchased a huge boat because of expanding business.\n\nHowever, people who return from Moynadeep after working there has a different tale to narrate. Rasu (Sunil Mukherjee) and Aminuddin (Robi Ghosh) say that Moynadeep is infested with lions and tigers, and there is forest all around. Rasu has fled from Moynadeep deserting his wife and children there. Aminuddin, too, refuses to go back to Moynadeep again.\n\nKubir has a wife and daughter and also recently blessed with a child. His wife is beset with a leg deformity, and his daughter is grown up and engaged to a local man. Kubir goes to pay a visit to his relatives from his wife’s side. On return, he brings along his sister-in-law Kapila (Roopa Ganguly) along with a ton of small kids. Kapila was married, but is now estranged from her husband.\n\nA sneaky amorous relationship develops between Kubir and Kapila. Staying with a deformed wife and coupled with amorous gestures from his alluring sister-in-law Kubir succumbs to her wishes of passion play. However, Kapila’s husband re-appears and takes her away with him.\n\nSuddenly one day a storm rises in the Padma. And leaves behind a trail of destruction. Kubir tells his wife “Padda amago joto daay abar totoi loy ” (It is true Padda gives us a lot, but in return it also takes a lot from us). Gautam Ghosh deserves kudos for beautifully capturing the stormy sequences on celluloid. Indeed, these disaster sequences are hauntingly filmed and lingers in one’s mind.\n\nStorm wreaks havoc in the village. Hussian Miya offers to lend a helping hand to the villagers. He does so, but in return he takes their thumb impression as proof of his help so that he can use it later to exploit them.\n\nMeanwhile Kubir’s daughter’s marriage breaks down. Rasu proposes to marry her. Even though Rasu was close to Kubir, he refuses to accept the match because of the age difference between them. Rasu becomes furious and threatens to ruin Kubir.\n\nHe succeeds in his endeavor. Kubir is fabricated in a theft case, and police is now trying to nab him. He flees, and go to Hussain Miya for help. Hossain Miya tells he can absolve him of the theft charge, but in return Kubir must go to Moynadeep. Kubir agrees to the offer.\n\nKubir goes to Moynadeep. A new life unfolds for him there. These concluding sequences from the film adds up to a compelling climax.\n\nThe music was scored by Gautam Ghosh and Alauddin Khan. The film was made in Bengali.\n\nI am unsure as to why the book has been titled as Childhood days. In fact, there are two aspects in the book the first of course relates to the childhood days of the filmmaker which is roughly about 80 pages. One gets a glimpse of the curious mind of the remarkably talented personality through the narration, albeit a tad heavy on the personal details some of which is quite uninteresting to a lay reader. The second part which tells about the experiences of the filmmaker is quite informative for a film buff and outlines the pains and hardship entailed in the filmmaking process.\n\nThe second part is about 85-90 pages. The film experiences that have been mentioned are the films which involved ‘outdoor shooting’ mostly, and ‘Pather Panchali’ (shot in Boral, a village near Kolkata), ‘Goopy Gane Bagha Byne’ & ‘Sonar Kella’ (Jaiselmer) & “Joy Baba Felunath” & “Aparajito’ (Varanasi) gets highlighted. Just to shoot a particular shot often takes days for a filmmaker – an 8-10 hours of grueling shooting in a day can result in just 3 minutes of screen time. Isn’t that incredulous?\n\nThe redeeming feature of the book is obviously the details about the lesser known actors like Kamu Mukherjee who had a great sense of humor, actors and technicians who have been associated with Ray for a long period. How Ray tackled royalty (like the Maharaja of Jodhpur) or the swelling crowds, how often to shoot a particular sequence Ray had to wait for a year (like the train sequence in Pather Panchali), how he improvised on sequences like in ‘Goopy Gayne Bagha Byne’ where in a particular sequence Goopy & Bagha were transported from a snowy land(Shimla) to a desert(Jaiselmer) which Ray filmed in a reverse mode with Goopy & Bagha actually falling from a tree and when played in reverse it appeared they jumped up and landed on a tree finds its way into the book. Noted cinematographer Subrata Mitra innovated bounce lighting during the shooting of Ray’s APARAJITO.\n\nThe second part deserves a 4-pointer, the first a two out of five.\n\nRating: 3 out of 5\n\nIt is a big thumbs-up when three non-Bengalis (Mira Nair, Irrfan Khan & Tabu) gets into the nuances of Bengali culture and make a convincing film. Based on a novel by Jhumpa Lahiri, the film NAMESAKE highlights the immigrant experience of a Bengali family in America. The film\n\nis rightly paced capturing the transitions and the developments in a credible way. The filming is superlative with an International crew grabbing the essence and the landmarks (like Howrah Bridge) of the city without blemish. The quiet romance between Tabu and Irrfan is endearing. The sequence where Tabu alone in the house gets to know about the passing\n\naway of her husband and breaks down in their garden demonstrates her acting prowess.\n\nIn a similar way, Karl Penn, who plays the son, does well in dramatic sequences when he breaks down on the pillow where his father had slept last. There are several wonderful cameos as well by actors from the Kolkata film industry – Sabyasachi Chakraborty as the father & Kharaj Mukhopadhyay as a servant of the family in the ancestral home of Tabu. The tendencies of immigrants to live within their communities, the blossoming of romance between a second generation immigrant (the son Karl Penn)with a white woman with its complexities have been neatly juxtaposed into the narrative.\n\nRating: 4.1 out of 5"
