        "text": "Looking for the best 5 Assamese films on the internet? right?\n\nI’ve watched quite a few Assamese movies over the years, and I have to admit it’s very hard to pick the best among them. But I will without a shadow of doubt choose these 3 films over the rest of the few that I have had the pleasure of watching, as they are not only pure gold but have immense re-watching potential and some remarkable acting that only adds to their already lustrous attributes\n\n1.Halodhiya Choraie Baodhan Khai (1987)\n\nHalodhiya Choraie Baodhan Khai one of the most popular Assamese films written directed by Expert filmmaker Jahnu Barua must be at the top and could be one of Assam’s most socially important films. The film traces the tale of Rakheswar Bora (Indra Bania), a small farmer who tills a plot of land but is unaware of the fact that the same was mortgaged to Sanatan Sarma, an MLA hopeful and landlord, and that now, due to the failure to pay the debt, land transfers to the latter were defaulted; even though Bora had been paying land income tax but, due to its nescient nature, had not been able to hold it. The weak and naive Bora is caught by lower-ranking government employees as the story progresses and is forced to pay bribes in cash as well as in-kind (by way of curd, woven cloth, etc.) just to take his file to the table of the SDC. Bora is also compelled to make his son, who, as a domestic servant in a noble village house, has high expectations for work. Later, the SDC (Pranjal Saikia), whom he meets after a long ordeal, gives Bora a lot of respites. Somehow, the SDC persuades Sarma to return the land to Bora, keeping in mind the subsequent elections, and not to take any other steps that could irritate the villagers who were well aware of the situation. The film captures the agonies faced by our society’s simple and gullible farmers and peasants, and how landlords and government employees mislead them. In 1988, it was the only Assamese movie to win the Swarna Kamal for Best Feature Film. For their performances, Indra Bania and Purnima Pathak Saikia won accolades.\n\n2.Agnisnaan (1985) Assamese Film\n\nThe film is based on Antarip, Dr. Bhabendranath Saikia’s much-acclaimed book, and was directed and produced by the author himself. The film, set in the backdrop of colonial Assam, portrays the ordeal faced by the film’s lead actress Menoka (Moloya Goswami), a mother of four, when her husband, the wealthy businessman Mohikanta (Biju Phukan), marries again and has a child with a much younger girl, Kirona (Kashmiri Saikia). Menoka refuses to endure such a terror and leaves her husband only to physically engage with Modon (Arun Nath), an outcast of the village and sympathizer of Menoka.In short, it’s a tale of revenge; a story that puts a woman on an equal footing with a man; how taboo the strategy can be. In section, Moloya Goswami outshines the rest. I have included this film because in Assamese movies it was way ahead of its time and almost a game-changer. Two National Awards were bagged with the movie\n\n3.Mon Jaai (2008) Assamese Movie\n\nThe story follows the lives of four unemployed central characters, Manab, Tapan, Nayan, and Akan, directed by Moirangthem Maniram, as they battle unemployment, poverty, meagerness, dipsomania, and other hardships. Some of them choose the wrong side of making money, and others choose the hard/pure side of making money. The result of their decisions and the course their lives take in the process is the film’s core plot. All the core characters had brilliant performances. The film has a subliminal message that, out of anger and greed, one should not go to self-destructive places, but should rather work hard regardless of the circumstances thrown in, and results will follow. The film’s songs were also excellent. The film received the 2010 Assamese Feature Film National Award.\n\n4.কথানদী(Kothanodi, River of Stories)\n\nThe film adapts its story from four episodes of বুঢ়ী আইৰ সাধু (Burhi Aair Xadhu, Grandma’s Tales), a compilation of folklore collected by Sahityarathi Lakshminath Bezbaruah, the fountainhead of Assamese literature. I grew up listening and reading these stories over and over again, like any other Assamese child, and I am so attached to them that I hardly miss any cinematic adoption of these stories. The attention to specifics (such as old Assamese dressing habits, way of speaking, building huts, etc.) and the way the four stories are set out to form a full-length film are what makes this adoption stand out from the audience of other cinematic adoptions.\n\nA Village Rockstar Assamese Film\n\nA Village Rockstar is a coming-of-age Assamese language film written, edited, co-produced, and directed by a self-taught filmmaker, Rima Das. At the 2017 Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), the movie premiered. The movie is about a young village girl who wants to start her own rock band in northeastern India.\n\nHope you like this article. If I miss your favorite film please comment below. I will update my post."
