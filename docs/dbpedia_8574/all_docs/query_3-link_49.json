        "text": "Brilliant Assamese film “Halodhia Choraye Baodhan Khai” (1987) directed by Jahnu Barua which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film besides a score of international awards. Its a poignant story of a simple farmer Rakeshwar Bora (Indra Bania in a brilliant role) who loves his family, having to lose his land to a greedy landowner from whom his father had taken some loan and mortgaged the land. The father had apparently paid off the dues but there was no receipt to prove it.\n\nRakeshwar’s family of wife and two kids have to do farming, duck rearing, supplying curd, while the wife works the loom. Its a tough life for them there. Having lost his land, he has to file a case before the local collector to reclaim it and for it he has to pay umpteen bribes to several people. He ends up selling his cow, pledging his bullocks and is forced to send his young son to work as an errand boy to work in the village headman house, all for the purpose of paying bribes to reclaim his land. The landowner farmer conflict is brilliantly bought out by Jahnu Barua. The landowner has total 105 acres whereas the farmer has a small plot of land which is enough to feed his family and send his kids to school. Indra Bania has done a searing portrayal of a struggling farmer desperate to reclaim his own land. This is somewhat like Do Bigha Zameen of Bimal Roy which was also another brilliant movie on the same theme – money lender – farmer conflict which is common in villages in India for lack of any official banking system it is the money lender who exploits them with usurious interest rates, no paper work, very poor court system to take care of their woes etc. Only the ending is unlike DBZ.\n\nTara as the silent suffering wife has also done a super role. For the farmer, all they have is their land, which is make or break for them. At one point, the farmer tells the collector, if i don’t have the land, how will i feed my family.\n\nBeautiful Assamese movie, Firingoti (1992) directed by Jahnu Barua. Ritu Baroah (Moloya Goswami) has had a difficult childhood and marriage, she becomes a widow very young. But her father encourages her to go out and work and not wear the widow clothes even. She gets a job as a primary school teacher in village Koronga deep in Assam, where to reach it, takes days on foot. She arrives to find no school at all there, as the old school had burned down 12 years ago and the school master of that school was taking his salary until his retirement 5 months ago. That is the level of corruption in India. Anyway, disheartened she thinks of going back to the city, when the village headman encourages her to start a school in the village. Initially the villagers are apprehensive at sending their kids to school as they lose a helping hand in their farm land and for errand jobs. But she convinces them and village falls in line. In comes a trouble maker in the form if a village ruffian who lost his job in the city and comes back to marry a local girl, but that girl, Dalimi is under the care of Ritu and she tells her to refuse her hand, saying nobody can force to marry her. The film depicts a lot of ignorance amongst the village folks in absence of education, many people are able to fool them or con with with false stories. There is one village idiot who keeps telling them strange stories of his army life including Germany bombing Japan with atom bomb which was called Hiroshima!!\n\nMoloya Goswami has played a good role, for which she won the national award as best actress of 1992. Jahnu Barua is a renowned film director has made some very good movies over the years. Assamese language is not the same as Bengali there is a marked difference in both, few words i could understand, but is a nice pleasing language."
