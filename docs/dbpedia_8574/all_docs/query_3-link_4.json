        "text": "“The animation’s messages should reach the youth. They’re the future citizens, the future parents, so this is very important.” – Malaya Goswami\n\nAward-winning actress, director, and radio personality Malaya Goswami joins the TeachAids team as the voice of the female doctor in the Axomiya language version of the TeachAIDS educational materials. Goswami brings over 30 years of experience, a passion for social justice, and a recognizable voice to her character’s message.\n\nGoswami has experience on the stage, behind the scenes, and on the radio. On stage, Goswami has acted in more than 30 plays. She has also directed several plays, including Jyoti Prasad Agarwalla’s famous play, Lobhita. She started in the Assamese film industry as the lead role in the award-winning film Agnisnaan. In her second film, Goswami won the National Film Award for Best Actress for her role as Ruti in the film Firingoti, becoming the first Assamese actress to with this prestigious award. Since then, Goswami has continued to act in Assamese films and television. This year is Goswami’s third time sitting on the selection committee for the Feature Film category at the National Film Festival.\n\nGoswami is well recognized for her dulcet voice, not only on the stage and screen but also on the airwaves. Her strong voice attracted All India Radio (AIR) to cast her in more than 40 radio plays and features produced by ‘Yuva-Vani’. She has further used this platform to address social issues, producing and directing a feature on handicapped children.\n\nMoreover, Goswami places a strong emphasis on education. She completed her bachelor’s degree with honors from Handique Girls College in 1975 and her master’s degree in Education at Gauhati University in 1977. She is a dedicated educator, currently working as an Associate Professor in the Department of Education at Jagiroad College, where she has been teaching for more than 30 years.\n\nGoswami is also a tireless advocate for women and children. She is the Founder and Secretary of Arptia, a socio-cultural organization that is dedicated to helping women and children in distress. She is also a member of the Media Management Group for Literacy & Development, a Delhi-based NGO that assists with comprehensive development efforts involving human resource development, social improvement and environmental issues. She serves as a board member of the Montessori Training Academy, as a trustee for the late Bhabendra Nath Saikia’s children’s trust, Arohan, and as an executive member of the pre-primary organization, Sparsh.\n\n“It’s a great opportunity for me to be a part of this project because, as we all know, this is a very sensitive issue and there is a lot of stigma about HIV and AIDS in our society. As a teacher and as an artist, I think I have an obligation toward the society, especially the younger generation. It’s my duty to educate them in a proper way, to provide them with the information they need. I’m very honored to be part of this project.” – Malaya Goswami\n\nTeachAids is proud to welcome Malaya Goswami to our global team of cultural icons. Her charismatic personality will draw in youth and adults alike.\n\nPhoto: Chandrima Gogoi (right), Special Projects Director at TeachAids, discusses the genesis of the organization with celebrated performing artist Malaya Goswami (left) and acclaimed director Bibi Barbarooah (center) at the Auditek Digital Recording Studio in Guwahati, Assam."
