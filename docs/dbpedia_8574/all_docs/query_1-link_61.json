        "text": "Storming a male-only traditional art form, top actresses from Assam, including Moloya Goswami, Nishita Goswami, Madhurima Chaudhuri, Rasarani Chetana Das and Barsha Rani Bishaya, performed a dance drama “Ram Bijoy-Ankia Naat” for the art and culture lovers in the Capital recently.\n\nThe Ankia Naataks were traditionally performed only by men and even the female characters were enacted by male actors till 1949. As such women performing an Ankia Naat are seen as personification of women empowerment and liberal culture of Assam.\n\n“I wanted to turn the tables. These are times of women revolution, this women driven performance aids in empowering us”, said Madhurima Choudhury, designer and director of the play who essayed the role of Lord Ram.\n\nThe performance “Ankia Naat Bhaona” – a traditional art form of the 15th century and a style of drama conceived by Srimanta Sankardeva – portrays spiritual music encompassing a combination of dance and dramaturgy – by 50 well-known actresses.\n\nSankardev was the fountainhead of the ‘Ankia Naat’, a kind of one-act play that was used to propagate Neo-Vaishnava religion in Assam. The great saint and social reformer created ‘Ankia Naat’ by bringing various aspects from the ancient Sanskrit drama, traditional dramatic art forms and his own innovative ideas to create a conventional performing art form in the field of dramatic arts of India. His “Cihna Yatra”’ is regarded as one of the first open-air theatrical performances in the world.\n\nThe event was organised by Government of Assam in association with Raginee - a socio-cultural organisation of Guwahati.\n\nThe drama, ‘Ram Bijoy’, was performed in “Brajavali”, a concoction of Assamese, Hindi, Oriya and Maithili."
