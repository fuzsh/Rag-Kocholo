        "text": "Elphinstone College is one of the constituent colleges of Dr. Homi Bhabha State University, a state cluster university. Established in 1823, it is one of the oldest colleges in Mumbai. It played a major role in shaping and developing the educational landscape of the city. It also played a pivotal role in the inception of the University of Mumbai.\n\nThe college enjoys a sea of aotable alumnus. This includes the likes of revolutionaries such as B. R. Ambedkar, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Virchand Gandhi, Badruddin Tyabji, Pherozeshah Mehta, Nanabhai Haridas, Kashinath Trimbak Telang, and Jamsetji Tata and teachers including Dadabhai Naoroji. It played a key role in the spread of education in Mumbai. In 2019, it ended its affiliation with the University of Mumbai.\n\nIn 2006, the college marked its sesquicentennial celebrations of inception (1856–2006). It offers undergraduate-level courses in the arts, sciences, and commerce.\n\nHistory\n\nBy the 19th century, Mumbai was a prosperous center for maritime trade and commerce. In 1824, an English school was set up by the Bombay Native Education Society for Indian students.\n\nIn 1827, a resolution was passed that an institution for the promotion of education should be established under Bombay Native Education Society and be designated as \"Elphinstone College\" (distinct from High School). This was named after Mountstuart Elphinstone, the departing Governor of the Bombay Presidency, who was responsible for beginning higher education in the city. An exuberant amount of Rs. 2,29,636.00 was collected by public subscription to fund teaching professorships in the English language and the Arts, Science, and Literature of Europe.\n\nThe college was formally constituted in 1835. The classes commenced in 1836, at Town Hall, with the first two professors: Arthur Bedford Orlebar (natural philosophy) - i.e. science) and John Harkness (general literature - i.e. classics). In 1840, the professors' classes were amalgamated with the Society's High School to form the Elphinstone Native Education Institution. In 1845, the name was shortened to Elphinstone Institution.\n\nElphinstone College became a distinct institution, separated from the high school, on 1 April 1856. This year is officially considered to be the year of the establishment of Elphinstone College.\n\nThe college was affiliated with the University of Mumbai in 1860.\n\nIn 1871, Elphinstone College got its building in Byculla. James Trubshawe, an architect who flourished in the early part of the 19th century, designed the structure, which was built by the engineer, John Adams. This older Elphinstone College building stands opposite the Jijamata Udyaan in Byculla, Mumbai. It is now a hospital, and a second Elphinstone College across the Jehangir Art Gallery was built a decade later.\n\nRole in inception of University Of Mumbai & Other colleges\n\nThe Elphinstone College played a pivotal role in the inception of The University Of Mumbai which was established in 1857, the same year as India's first revolt. The university's initial classes were held at the college's Byculla building and were subsequently moved to the present Fort campus of the same.\n\nThe college also played a major role in formalizing legal education in India. The esteemed \"Perry Professorship\" (A chair of Jurisprudence at the University Of Mumbai) was set up at Elphinstone in 1855. One of the best-known lawyers of the time, Barrister R. T. Reid (LL. B. Bar-at-Law) was appointed the first Perry Professor of Jurisprudence and the Government Law School was establishment. This institution later came to be known as the Government Law College, Mumbai. It is the oldest law school in Asia.\n\nIn 1948, It was suggested that Elphinstone College's premises were to be used (during morning hours) for initial classes of Jai Hind College. The proposal was accepted and admission started for the Arts Faculty in June of the same year. A formal inauguration took place in September 1948 at the Elphinstone College Library Hall.\n\nThe Sir J. J. School of Arts was founded in 1857 and was instituted to offer drawing classes. Its Initial classes were also held at Elphinstone.\n\nAcademics\n\nThe Elphinstone College consists of two academic entities: Junior and Degree colleges.\n\nDegree or \"senior\" college was affiliated to University of Mumbai till 2019. And, it was later made a constituent college of Dr. Homi Bhabha State University. This was a newly formed state owned cluster university. It was the first of its kind. After mere months, another state cluster university was formed in Mumbai called the HSNC University, which included institutes like KC College and HR College.\n\nThe Junior college of the institution is affiliated to the Maharashtra State Board (or commonly known as HSC Board). It provides education at a higher secondary or high school level.\n\nCourses offered\n\nSenior college\n\nB.Sc in Physics, Chemistry, Computer Science, Life Sciences\n\nB.A in Economics, English, Geography, Hindi, History, Mathematics, Statistics, Marathi, Sociology\n\nJunior college\n\nHigher Secondary School Certificate in Arts, Commerce and Science\n\nFacilities\n\nHostels: Government Colleges Hostel, Mumbai for boys; Telang Memorial Hostel and Savitridevi Phule Hostel for girls.\n\nGymkhana\n\nComputer facilities\n\nLibrary (with more than 90,000 books)\n\nNoteworthy features\n\nHeritage College building\n\nThe college building, with its Gothic architecture, has been classified as a grade 1 heritage structure. It is one of the most identified buildings of South Mumbai as a symbol of heritage.\n\nLocally, the college is famous for its Romanesque Transitional style building that has been categorised as Grade I Heritage structure. The iconic building was designed by Trubshaw. And, it was made under the supervision of Khan Bahadur Muncherjee Murzban, and completed in 1888.\n\nIn 2004, The college was awarded the Asia-Pacific Heritage Award for Culture Heritage Conservation by UNESCO.\n\nFestivals\n\nMaharashtrotsav\n\nMaharashtrotsav is a National Level Inter-College Cultural Festival organized by all the students and faculties of Elphinstone College. In 2011–2012, it gathered a crowd of more than 75 colleges with nearly 2500 students, which was then a State Level Event. In 2012–2013, marked huge progress in its type making it National Level Festival with nearly 5000 students from more than 130 colleges across India.\n\nTechTsar\n\nTechTsar started back in 2009, with a budget of INR 75,000, which was contributed by advertisements in the TechTsar brochure and banners. Amongst the notable past corporate sponsors such as Bank of Maharashtra, Dena Bank, Airtel, and many more.\n\nThe name of the festival was inspired by two words: Technology [tech] and King [Tsar] and was proposed by Elphinstone College alumni Rohan Bhambhani. The motto is \"Merging Talent with Technology.\" The festival consists of many events such as C and Java debugging, LAN gaming, quiz, debate, photography, logo designing, grand Prix, treasure hunt, etc. Students from many colleges across Mumbai, Thane, and Navi Mumbai participate. The festival usually takes place in the final week of November. Currently, it is known as one of the fastest-growing college festivals in Mumbai.\n\nPrimers\n\nThe Biotechnology Department of the college organizes the festival known as Primers. It started in 2009. The festival consists of seminars by well-known speakers and continued by events in which the students of colleges of Mumbai and Thane participate. In 2010, the students organized a job fair for all the college students with free entry and are concluding the event with a fashion show.\n\nThe college is located in the Kala Ghoda area of South Mumbai.

He has worked in many Hindi and Gujarati films. He has been the hero in most of the Gujarati movies.[citation needed] He is the son of veteran character actor Jeevan.\n\nKiran Dhar (stage name- Kiran Kumar) is a descendant of a Kashmir royal family.He is the son of legendary character actor Jeevan. He is married to a Gujarati actress Sushma Verma.[citation needed] They have two children: Vikas Kumar who was working with David Dhawan as an Assistant Director and Srishti, who is a Mass Media graduate and runs a jewellery and clothing label with her mother called \"Sush & Shish\".\n\nKiran is a Kashmiri by birth and has ties with the Royal Family by virtue of being the grand son of the Vazir-e-Vazarat of Gilgit.[1] He is a devout believer of Sai baba and has a production house named after the saint- \"Sainama Visions\"\n\nRecently he has been honoured with the life membership of International Film And Television Club of Asian Academy Of Film & Television\n\nHe is a member of CINTAA and is a part of the core committee. He was responsible, along with others, in organising the \"Star CINTAA superstars ka jalwa\" - a televised event that brought the entire hindi film and television industry together to perform and raise funds for CINTAA.\n\n[edit]Career\n\nHe attended Daly College, a boarding school in Indore. He enrolled at R. D. National College in Bandra, Mumbai, and later joined the Film and Television Institute of India (FTTI) in Pune.[1] As a young boy it was the film industry which drew him because of his father's association with it.[citation needed] Kumar starred in Do Boond Pani in 1971, and went on to play the lead in several movies. Due to bad decisions to choose roles his career saw a slump with the onset of movies like jungle mein mangal and other such oddball films. During this phase Kumar started to work in Gujarati movies, where he quickly reached cult status getting him the \"Bachhan of Gujarati cinema\" title. Rakesh Roshan's \"Khudgarz\" got him back to Hindi cinema, and then on negative roles in films like \"Tezaab\" and \"Khuda Gawah\" won him accolades as an antihero.\n\nSunil Mehta's Prem Kishan was his first television serial.

He has worked in many Hindi and Gujarati films. He has been the hero in most of the Gujarati movies.[citation needed] He is the son of veteran character actor Jeevan.\n\nKiran Dhar (stage name- Kiran Kumar) is a descendant of a Kashmir royal family.He is the son of legendary character actor Jeevan. He is married to a Gujarati actress Sushma Verma.[citation needed] They have two children: Vikas Kumar who was working with David Dhawan as an Assistant Director and Srishti, who is a Mass Media graduate and runs a jewellery and clothing label with her mother called \"Sush & Shish\".\n\nKiran is a Kashmiri by birth and has ties with the Royal Family by virtue of being the grand son of the Vazir-e-Vazarat of Gilgit.[1] He is a devout believer of Sai baba and has a production house named after the saint- \"Sainama Visions\"\n\nRecently he has been honoured with the life membership of International Film And Television Club of Asian Academy Of Film & Television\n\nHe is a member of CINTAA and is a part of the core committee. He was responsible, along with others, in organising the \"Star CINTAA superstars ka jalwa\" - a televised event that brought the entire hindi film and television industry together to perform and raise funds for CINTAA.\n\n[edit]Career\n\nHe attended Daly College, a boarding school in Indore. He enrolled at R. D. National College in Bandra, Mumbai, and later joined the Film and Television Institute of India (FTTI) in Pune.[1] As a young boy it was the film industry which drew him because of his father's association with it.[citation needed] Kumar starred in Do Boond Pani in 1971, and went on to play the lead in several movies. Due to bad decisions to choose roles his career saw a slump with the onset of movies like jungle mein mangal and other such oddball films. During this phase Kumar started to work in Gujarati movies, where he quickly reached cult status getting him the \"Bachhan of Gujarati cinema\" title. Rakesh Roshan's \"Khudgarz\" got him back to Hindi cinema, and then on negative roles in films like \"Tezaab\" and \"Khuda Gawah\" won him accolades as an antihero.\n\nSunil Mehta's Prem Kishan was his first television serial. He's established himself as a reining star in the television industry with serials like Zindagi, Ghutan, Sahil, Manzil, Katha Sagar, Aur Phir ek Din, Papa, miilee, chhajje chajje ka pyar and more.\n\nHe was in the process of starting a production house called \"Sainama Visions\" for which the pilot episode of a show called \"Aashiana\" was also shot.\n\n[edit]Films\n\nOm Allah (2011)\n\nAseema: Beyond Boundaries (2009)\n\nAisi Deewangi (2009) (credit only) ....
