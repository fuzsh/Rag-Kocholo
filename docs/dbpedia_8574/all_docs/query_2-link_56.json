        "text": "Mundane Musings | The Review Channel by Jubaraj J. Baruah |\n\nMovie : Halodhia choraye baodhan khai/The Catastrophe\n\nDirector: Jahnu Barua\n\nHere’s a movie that locates itself on the map through a small typical village in rural Assam and tackles the same old story of the rich and the powerful exploiting the poor in a different flavor of hate, helplessness, hope and innocent ignorance. Jahnu Barua’s treatment of innocent ignorance has always been an indispensable part of his plot – how his characters fumble because they are uncomplicated has always been a turning point for his protagonists. The farmer is played by Indra Baniya whose land is grabbed away by a rich land owner all on the grounds of not having papers. Law thus becomes an impediment for the farmer who subsequently loses the land to the influential person who is soon going to contest the MLA elections. The farmer’s struggle for then getting back his land is what forms the rest of the plot.\n\nThis movie draws certain inspiration from “Bicycle Thieves” and this is indirectly complimented with the farmer pasting posters along with his mature son. The son’s role has been designed pretty similarly to the character Bruno in Bicycle Thieves. This film takes up hope and dashes it, destroys room for repair-ability of loss and takes on the realities poverty and powerlessness can thrust upon us. His despair is so extreme that he is driven to paste posters of the person who grabbed away his land; he hates it; he despises it and yet he has to paste it – the images Jahnu Barua creates here tear the viewer into reality to sink in this farmer’s emotional crisis. How his son then becomes the mature one and keeps his dad on the trot, on the run and emanates hope is another beautifully crafted element of the same sequence. Finally the farmer does get back his land only to realize that he has mortgaged his buffalo to win this case and the excitement of getting back the land is immediately switched to a melancholic voice-over of hope, frustration and strong will. He knows he cannot plough now and yet he picks up the kur(a tool which used as an alternative to ploughing by buffaloes) and rushes to the paddy fields – The irony is we don’t see him working on the fields as a happy ending would have asked for – we see him tearing apart that poster he pasted as if out of his self acclaimed independence from all the exploiters and his realization of his stature as an individual, as an important voter. I personally don’t know how to describe my last minutes of this viewing experience – Should I expect him to go back to normalcy right away when he gets back the piece of land or should I realize the fact that exploitation does more than making a person poorer – it breaks him, it rips his family apart and this breakdown cannot be solved by just getting back to default settings – His battle is not a battle for values – he doesn’t fight for winning a case or winning his ego, he fights for winning his bread. This movie disturbed me a lot because it didn’t give me any fair conclusion – All I could think was how helpless, how incapable, how handicapped we all can become, how minuscule unimportant we are? Only one thing seemed to give me contentment somehow and it was how the farmer actually recognized his power to be an individual through something as basic as a voting right. This movie lives on and will survive till we as a society stop exploiting , till we as a society stop creating this tribe called the powerless.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nMundane Musings | The Review Channel by Jubaraj J. Baruah |\n\nMovie: Konikar Ramdhenu (Ride on the rainbow)\n\nDirector: Jahnu Barua\n\nKonikar Ramdhenu like most of his films presents us with the surface of the plot right at the word go. It does deal with the essence of a troubled childhood but it rather focuses more on the psyche than the trouble- here we have a child Kukoi who runs away from his village at the tender age of 11 to work in a garage in the city. Immediately we are presented with an antagonizing garage owner who threatens the kid. All of this is shown as a reminiscence of the kid who now is in a juvenile correction center. The only engaging point for us is to get inside that numbness of Kukoi and wonder the power of guilt that must be building in him for committing a heinous crime like murder. The movie here could have taken two roads – either deal with the dilemma of child molestation and its consequences or select a road less taken by which would be to make us be a part of Kukoi’s journey from that burden of guilt to his world of imagination and freedom. He has killed someone and it is a fact, it cannot be written off, it cannot be wiped from his memory. At the same time while he leads us in this journey, Jahnu Barua also doesn’t completely ignore the issue in hand and keeps referring to the child molestation problem through a set of two different characters. The best part of Konikar Ramdhenu lies in confiding in that utopian world a deprived child loves to live and how his imaginations and fascinations actually make him strive for a better life. Bishnu Khargoria as the mentor of the kid pulls of yet another memorable performance. Moloya Goswami plays the role of a law abiding superintendent by balancing her sympathies and her code of law towards the children and achieves the same effortlessly. The director has always been fascinated with the vastness of the sea and most of his films have a silent hint at the sea. This film cannot be complete without the final song – the song that originates from a certain beat Kukoi always used to play out – we become a part of the dance, the song which the mentor and the child enjoy believing in a better tomorrow. Meghali, the 3 elephants, the 2 cars, the hills, the school teacher, the 3 storeyed school all make Konikar Ramdhenu a memorable film and if you watch it, you will know why.\n\nFrom coming to terms with his musings and his deprived childhood, this here is not a visual experience which will make us contented or nostalgic but will instead make us ponder over the different fates of people – some fortunately misguided against some unfortunately talented people. Konikar Ramdhenu will not let us revisit our childhood but will make us wary of the exploited, deprived, defeated and silenced ones. Here’s a movie that should be watched for its strong visuals and its aura.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nMundane Musings: The Review Channel by Jubaraj J.Baruah\n\nMovie: Firingoti | The Spark | Assamese | 1991 Director: Jahnu Barua\n\nFiringoti might seem to revolve around Ritu, the protagonist of the film as is suggested by the synopsis but then it touches on a lot of un-discussed, roughly hinted parallels which help us in reinventing the 1960s and the rustic lifestyle. To gulp down the 2 hours of this mesmerizing experience at one go is going to be an uphill task and it deserves multiple viewings.\n\nThe film starts by introducing Ritu and her circumstances. She is a widow who has got a new job of a school teacher and the school happens to be located in a remote village in Upper Assam. This new job actually does exist on paper only since the school doesn’t exist – the previous schoolteacher who she has to replace too existed only on paper and was also drawing salary without serving any duties. So this movie then transcends into a journey of this determined lady who opens up her school, first by teaching students under a tree shade and then in a make shift school and the story on a flat note would seem to circle around the obstacles, the encouragement, criticism, support to this strong willed move of hers. But as I said this is just one part of this multi layered brilliant piece of art. The attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the warfare, the bloodshed have been heard of in this village and that has been narrated by a character who’s called Paisakhowa – this character actually becomes the mirror of the need for better education. His fake stories of him being a soldier in the Second World War and his famous anecdote “Anybody challenge?” are a strong comment on the how uneducated people believe in every story that’s told. And these stories actually make these uneducated aged people feel the need for education to validate whatever is being told. It is also a strong comment on how highly educated people wage wars and ignorant people condemn wars. The novelist who might seem nothing more than a cameo has a lot to communicate as a role. In a way he is helpless as he is trying to maintain a balance of belonging to the town where he is read and known against being born and belonging to an ignorant and remote village. He couldn’t possibly achieve what Ritu is about to and though he is proud of her, he can’t offer a better helping hand – All he can do at best is maybe click a photo, capture the great atmosphere as he quotes and expect the children to be one day be capable of reading his novels.\n\nThe third character, the antagonist of the movie is introduced at a very interesting period of time – the Indo-China war is just three days old and the third character by then has completely filled in his shoes as the villain. His claims might be out of frustration of being jobless but then his claims that Ritu doesn’t have a right to teach in that school because she is an outsider does allude to interesting conclusions keeping in mind the backdrop of the Indo-China war when both parties were trying to decide which was whose piece of land. The ignorance to this war is again reflected and the innocence and simplicity of these remote villagers is well established. Jahnu Barua in both the cases of the second world war and the Indo China war somehow juxtaposes ignorance with too much of intellectualism, rustic imageries with vast barren lands of war and bloodshed and demands us to live a few minutes of our lives ignorantly and remotely. So who finally was the spark? Ritu, Paisakhowa, the novelist, the jobless villain, the atrocity of remoteness, the beauty of education or the affirming spirit in ignorant souls of a better educated tomorrow!\n\nJahnu Barua’s Firingoti is a very Assamese movie and it completely compiles together all the rustic elements of a 1960 remote Assamese village, all the minute moments of the villagers, their apprehensions, their blissful innocence, their weaknesses, their strengths and their traditions. It is a must watch movie and the contemporary generation needs to watch it without fail. Firingoti is Assamese purist cinema at its best.\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nMundane Musings: The Review Channel by Jubaraj J. Baruah\n\nMovie: Raag | The Rhythm of Love\n\nRaag starts off brilliantly, keeps up to a bit of the momentum in the middle and fails disastrously towards the end. Raag is the type of a movie going experience where when you know the starting point, you also know the finish line – so this movie heavily depends on the way the story builds up and how the characters adapt to the same and keep us engaged. It is the story of a housewife who is trying to reinvent her married life and who doesn’t yet know that she is a part of a failed totally gone wrong relationship. While doing all of this existential business, she gets in touch with a particular someone – oh you guessed it right – he needs to be a painter because only painters can be available and handsome in their middle age, plus with the indian sentiments attached to an assamese movie, a painter is usually one of the crazy ones who has a big crisis in front of him both financially and mentally and hence is on the unknowing quest for someone, a loved one or a one who can just forward him this link “https://www.facebook.com/aap.h.chutiye?fref=ts”\n\nThe moment you cast a painter as a character, you are in two conflict zones immediately – either you are trying to do formula parallel cinema or you are just trying to be (accept it) stereotypical – ha painter hai, toh uska life toh jhund hoga hi! after all painter bhikhaari hota hai aur thaarki bhi ho sakta hai! The last time I saw a happy to do painter was our own Akshay Khanna in Dil Chahta Hai – after all he did go to Goa and did spend time and money on the beach, anyways proves my point! Now since its Assamese rare cinema(cinema without an audience and deprived of producers), you need to strategize on how you can be more stereotypical- The next trick is always making the painter a media hater, a cynic who just appreciates classical music that too when played early in the morning and also has a foreigner as his ex wife – that too a gori from prague. Just to make it a little less obvious and a little racist they chose Prague and the gori I believe! Oh wait – there’s more, it’s just here when the flute also crops up! After all Raag stands for rhythm and since the director wanted a loose translation and called it rhythm of love, there had to be musical instruments that could be artsy just like the tanpura and the flute.\n\nSo where was I? Yes I was talking about these two characters who are completely similar in a way because both can connect to the music and the paintings they associate themselves with – so they hit it off on the first day itself, Adil Hussain gives a power packed performance with Zerifa Wahid filling up her shoes really well. Except for the stereotypes, the relationship build up is not a let down and happens very realistically and you do feel you are a part of their conflicts. Similarly Kenny doesn’t let us down and his character build up is in sync with his frustration with his married life. They don’t share much dialogue but the visuals very well establish the point of frustration.\n\nSo where does it go all wrong? I had no problem with the introduction of the third character but the way it was dealt with was haywire. The third character would later add on as the closing chapter of the movie and would help in a longer and easier end to the movie. This logic is too good to be logical. The third character is actually an ex lover of the protagonist and it is well established that he still longs for her. But then why do you need him? Is he the end of the vacuum that she is facing? You can’t force in solutions if you want it to be real! I suppose you wanted it to be real because that is the intention which is projected when the relationship between the husband and the painter is built. This I believe was just an easy and failed escape plan to complete the movie and it didn’t work well. P.S. My wow moment during this whole dull period of half an hour was the bike accident! the Dhoom 3 bike stunts look more real than this!\n\nAnd kudos to the sound designer – he really gave me a scare! I so was about to believe she was just going to jump off from that building and commit suicide. Why? Is a suicide attempt or an urge to commit suicide the only possible way to depict complete mental breakdown! Is it or does it just happen in formulaic art films? With such a forced sound track to get us into that emotional frame of mind which demands us to look, look and keep looking: our brain needs to stimulate consistently the same information, same audio, shame video: Oh! she is facing her most difficult, toughest and chaotic time, oh! now she is going to jump, jump, jump, oh wait she just wanted to check how many floors did the building have? Thank god she doesn’t jump! Otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to write a review of the complete movie. Towards the end there’s more to this masala with the husband being shown in negative light with an extra marital affair to make us delve into the suffering of the protagonist even deeper. Doesn’t work! Just another stereotype in the wall! I kind of like the ending and how the participants of these intertwined relationships interact.\n\nRaag tries to be bold and is in fact a very sincere and mature attempt by the director. I think this movie deserves more audience than what it is getting now. A little slow paced but then this pace suits in the mood for the complex theme it deals with. After a long time, we finally have a mature Assamese feature presentation playing in our theaters nearby. Go watch it!\n\nRating: 5.5/10\n\nMundane Musings: The Review Channel by Jubaraj J. Baruah\n\nShinyor\n\nThe timing of the release of this movie was perfect – The longing for an Assamese movie in the theaters had reached its ultimatum. Though the release poster did give me a hint of a warning, I knew had to go – it would be my much need break from all the European, American and Bangaali overdose! For 2 hours Shinyor, you had my attention and in return since you gave me a heartache(with all the Assamese sentiments in consideration) and a headache I take this as a right and as a necessity to pass some remarks on this movie so that the next time when you promise me such a loud poster, you make the movie a little less louder.\n\n1) Next time, make a better poster, do you need graphic artists? Just ask? – You can’t have actors lined up next to each other with the only emotion they can hold on to – pain, anger, frustration, acidity, god knows what?\n\n2)Too many accidents spoil the broth – There are two ways too much of serendipity can happen in your life: a)You are the all in all creator of the black hole and its processes or b)You are just a nagging director who wants dragging climax points to tie the loose ends of an incomplete script. A simpler logic can always be to be a little realistic.\n\n3)Get tear gas next time – By no means, am I complaining about the acting standards of the current assamese movie industry – What I am complaining is of the over dramatic, childish way these characters cry without any sense of timing. Her friend has been shot for god’s sake – you can’t cancel out on Newton’s third law of motion now – a late reaction like that of the protagonist is just one example, watch the movie to discover more, as a matter of fact, her sister actually does better while her mom tops the list!\n\n4) Get a focus puller! If you already had one, fire him right away! And if your cinematographer did it intentionally in those many shots, it doesn’t work boss!\n\n5) The music was the best part of the movie and it does well – the sound design too has been pretty neat\n\n6) Some editing decisions were really disastrous like the first sequence before the credits come in – Was it really meant to give me a trippy feeling! Didn’t do me a thing! The next thing was the rhythm of the movie – The pace was too erratic to give me a comfortable viewing experience\n\n6) Some moments are really wonderful like those little conversations between the protagonist and the prostitutes. It does strike a chord then and there.\n\n7) Comic timing didn’t exist and the milkman trying to milk his way through with two comedy lines and a brief cameo with the lunatic doesn’t serve any purpose – it just extends the headache by another 5 minutes\n\n8) I really was just about to believe that the movie will now get stretched into another melodrama of the protagonist finally succeeding to convince her parents but thankfully the movie ended where it had to and wasn’t stretched unnecessarily.\n\nSo all in all, an attempt that went all wrong – a loose script to start with, a script that deserved more attention, more detail, less loudness, less drama, more realism. Such strong characters like the protagonist and her friend had to be stronger than the way the movie treated them. This movie was supposed to be a powerful movie with a powerful plot in context; it just promises a lot of wet tissues without any fulfilling approach – it goes down as just another filler in the halls because sensible Assamese movies have ceased to exist. 3 weeks and still running – I wish this movie all the luck because I too want the Assamese audience to get engaged with Assamese movies and I want them not to write off this movie by not watching it, but by watching it and then wishing to watch better. At the end of the day, this movie is a lot better than the Khans and the item numbers that you see in Bollywood. I might just sound a little too critical and cynical here but then this is all for the good of Assamese cinema. Joi Axom!\n\nRating: 4/10\n\nindia An Ukranian asked me once upon a time “Are Indians assholes?” And I didn’t know what to tell her except “Maybe yes we are and we will always be till we have our independence?”\n\nSo when do I see that happening? I know this is going to be long and only a handful are going to read what follows but I still will like to have my voice heard – maybe I will find some company during my coffee breaks and random conversation sessions:\n\n1. Freedom from religion – That will be the day when you will not read my surname and will accept that I am your brother! That will be the day when you will not want to marry me because we don’t share the same God! That will be the day Jains will not eat meat not because of a religion but because they feel so, Muslims will eat pork because what they were already having was meat and meat helps in aerobic processes, Hindus will not have a problem with beef on their plate because worshiping a God in the form of a cow doesn’t make sense and all it makes sense is when you really meditate and pray for the supernatural for salvation and peace! That day when temples, mosques and gurudwaras will become only architectural marvels and everyone will be free to find peace in such places, that day when Roja will be a state of mind and not a one month fast just for the sake of it, that day when Karvasauth will be only best wishes and not a ceremony\n\n2. Freedom from fear – That will be the day when women will walk free naked on the streets and men will be civilized enough to let freedom speak for them, that will be the day when a right to information act won’t become a risk to individual act, that will be the day when terrorists will think twice to disturb peace, that will be the day when we will not talk about our father of nation or will we need him – we will be adults enough to handle it all by ourselves\n\n3. Freedom from bullshit – That will be the day when we will not want a Chennai Express to make us happy, that will be the day we will appreciate all the beautiful things in life and filter out the rest of bullshit – that will be the day we will not gossip about our neighbors and we will talk just about us, that will be the day when we will be all selfish for happiness, peace and serenity, that will be the day we won’t need an IPL or Manchester United, we will just need us and our common sense\n\n4. Freedom from schemes – That will be the day when schemes will not be just voted in the Parliament but be implemented – that will be the day when promises will not be made and minority politics will be old school, that will be the day we will concentrate on short term goals and not what will our great grandchildren enjoy, when new road links will not be the solution – the solution will be filling potholes and making better roads – when reservations will not be a political agenda or a CAT IIT JEE bull’s eye but will really help the cause. That will be the day when the problem will be a scheme and the answer will be to fill the gaps in the administrative machinery\n\n5. Freedom from inhibitions – That will be the day porn will be accepted as a teenager fantasy, public display of affection will be accepted as puppy love, sex will be available not because somebody is selling it but because somebody wants to have it, that will be the day when bosses won’t ask their female colleagues to get laid to get a raise because they already will be having great sex, that will be the day when drinking will not be a taboo and will be accepted as a social celebration, that will be the day when weed will be legal because it drives the economy and doesn’t do any harm, that will be the day a gay will call himself a gay and not just crack gay jokes, that will be the day when we will stop smoking because it harms and not because we just need to follow someone’s advice!\n\nThat will be the day when I will be proud to be an Indian – That will be the day you will understand the crisis is not poverty – the crisis is you!\n\nYes I know I invite criticism with a title so ridiculous like the above – But then this is not a review or a critical analysis – this is meant to be a simple post for simple people happy with their popcorn. This is intended for people who like to go for a movie because they have nothing else happening in their life. So here’s how YJHD became a Ship of Theseus:\n\n1.The blind photographer: We all have limitations – We sometimes wonder if not having these limitations will help. We are bound and strangled by limitations – we feel. But then a blind girl who understands colors can add another dimension to her black and white photographs gets intrigued on being asked by an interviewer if she ever felt limited by anything – she wonders if there could be something more beautiful than realizing beauty through dark sunglasses. Now the paradox of limitation is that sometimes you don’t know what lies ahead of you when these limitations are erased. I understand you couldn’t follow me till here. Here’s where YJHD helps – Deepika Padukone went to a temple and you cheered for her, you even wondered if she could be your next daughter in law, you even had such a nightmare and mistook it for a nice dream. Now when did that realization end – When Deepika Padukone chose to go with lenses and do away with her old school spectacles to see more clearly, to let go of her one limitation that made her look a nerd. She suddenly became hot, she stopped going to temples, she started playing holi without the choli and you went head over heels realizing you needed some bhaaang to even dare dream that she could be yours.\n\n2. The monk: We fear death, don’t we? We sometimes follow certain theories and analogies because we believe in them to be the only truth. Just like the monk wants to succumb to death in an age old traditional way by fasting unto death because he has an incurable disease, he has two sides of himself – one side of him wants to fight pharmaceutical companies and defend the cause of the right treatment to animals being tested – this side wants to continue the fight, continue to spread goodwill, continue to live to do all of this, the other side wants to fight any sort of materialism that might crop up in between, fight himself if he has to ever choose to opt for any drugs of these companies he is fighting against. And when such a conflict arises, you either choose death or you take a side to understand who you actually are – maybe just another guy with a tidy trouser and a neatly ironed shirt. And yes to simplify things, YJHD comes to the rescue once again – Kalki Koelchin loves her best friend but then she can’t express it – We all love the way she dramatically calls Mr. Ranbir Kapoor to let her know of her grand wedding at Udaipur. She is now a little princess because she has made a hard choice – she understands that to have a grand wedding and to pay a crore a day for the band baaja baraat she needs someone better than a drunkard best friend – yes it’s time to understand you are a materialist and everything else that is material needs money, plenty of money.\n\n3. The stockbroker: We are constantly in rebellion with who we are because we think we are not doing enough to do right, do good – we want to be good human beings- we try to show it by being kind by being generous and then just forgetting who we really are. Being kind or a charitable person is a virtue – it cannot be us or our inner self. The stockbroker has to attend to his grandmom who just had a recent accident and can’t move. In a certain scene, when his grand-mom asks for medical assistance, he can actually get a nurse to attend her but he doesn’t even try twice. He wants to tell her he is a good man because he is kind and compassionate and that he can too take care of her just like any other nurse. He is rebelling against who he is because he actually cannot justify whatever he’s pursuing to be who he actually is. And then comes along his way an opportunity to find himself answers for who he actually is and that is the moment of revelation for him. He knows who he is and what he can be. Well I know this is as twisted and complicated as it gets and hence we have our very own Kabira – Ranbir Kapoor to explain all of this complicated shit. Mr. Ranbir Kapoor runs, falls, trips, kisses, sleeps and goes abroad in an aeroplane. He finally gets an offer to be a travel show host or to dance in wedding parties! He finally identifies who he actually is and his dancing entertainment show crosses the 100 crore mark in two weeks! Amazing it is to know who we are and where we stand!\n\nI know; I still know – You will still go for a YJHD and you will still skip a Ship of Theseus – There’s no use trying to make you understand what you are missing – All I can do is explain Ship of Theseus the way you want it to be explained where you can understand lessons of life without using your grey matter. If need be, I will explain you one another time but do go for a Ship of Theseus – you won’t watch something similar for ages to come.\n\nWell to retrospect I can see where the gap is – the day when our country will be free of the food security bill not because of political motives but because the right to education really worked wonders for us to get us enough food and a brain, that will be the day of light, brother, that will be the day of enlightenment."
