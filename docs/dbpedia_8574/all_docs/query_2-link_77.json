        "text": "The grand dame of Assamese cinema\n\nThere was not much in terms of conversation between actress Jnanada Kakati and her mother when she was offered her first film role in 1947. Her mother simply told her to pack and leave and to never come back.\n\nThe film was Parghat. Today the eighty year old actress reminiscences, “I was dumbstruck when I was offered the role of heroine in the movie. Cinema was the domain of people in Mumbai. Although I had watched a bit of Joymati it was beyond my comprehension that Assamese people would be in a film.”\n\nWhen she reached Kolkata for shooting she was met with more probing questions, “No one from a good family comes into acting. How have you come into this profession? Why have you come?”\n\nTo this, she had a simple response. “What is wrong with this? If we educated people do not come into this profession, who will?”\n\nAssamese society in the early period of the twentieth century was like a closed seashell, clammed so as to protect its perceived pearl of culture and professions like singing and dancing, especially by the fairer sex were frowned upon.\n\nBack home, while she was away, her parents were exposed to the jibes and snide remarks of neighbours and ‘well-wishers’ who passed comments like, “You will get many son-in-laws now.”\n\nFor as long as she could remember there was always this tussle; a tussle between dreams and societal conformity which started at an early age when she used to hide backstage at the Asom Club in Shillong to watch her father Deben Das, a reputed theatre artist, perform on stage.,\n\n“I was called Akoni and I used to come and watch my father's rehearsal but my father used to forbid me coming to watch. The chowkidar was instructed to drive me away and it drove my mother to despair as to why I went there again and again. I don't know why but to see all these actors put on colours, dress as women and dress up in different characters attracted me and I decided that one day I would be an actress.”,\n\n“I loved songs and singing and would often go and watch people singing or listen to them after school was over much to my mother's concern and worry. In school, teachers used to tell me to sing whenever there used to be a play. I would gather few of my friends and perform a small play on someone's verandah. I would imagine that I was a queen of the land and I would sprout wings and fly away.”\n\nThese were traits not held in great esteem by her parents. Threatened and cajoled by her parents to be ‘good’ she would be often beaten up in an effort to make her ‘normal’.\n\nWhen she was studying in the sixth standard, the legendary Bishnu Rabha saw her dancing and offered to teach her. His prediction was, “Jnanada, you will become a great actress one day.” However after just one week of teaching the dancing classes had to be stopped as ‘well-wishers’ again told her mother that the ‘dancing business’ was not good; another example of the prevalent mind-set.\n\nShe persisted and by the time she was in college she was always the first choice to sing and dance and even teach others.\n\nWhen all threats and cajoling failed her parents planned to get her married which they thought would put an end to their daughter's gallivanting. However much to their dismay, their son-in-law turned out to be a staunch supporter of his wife. Himself very interested in the performing arts, her husband Lohit Kakati, encouraged Jnanada Kakati to act in films and also follow her heart. Remembering him, she says, “I was and I still say I am so lucky to have got married to my husband. He was an artist, singer, dancer and a handsome person. It was due to his support that I could go ahead with my wishes despite opposition from my parents.”\n\nHer lifelong persistence paid rewards when she became the first Assamese actress to go to the famed Berlin film festival in 1959 for her film Puberun, the first Assamese film to be screened at the Berlin film festival.\n\n“I feel lucky and privileged that even in that period I could go to a place like Berlin film festival after doing an Assamese film. We were taken around in a car through the streets of Berlin and people lined up on both sides of the roads to shower flower petals on us and chanting “India… India,” as our car passed by. It was at that moment that I realized what a great moment it was and I felt proud to be an Indian. A girl from a middle class family got the opportunity to dance with a Hollywood star like Cary Grant.”\n\nUnknown to most she was also an accomplished radio announcer for All India Radio and when All India Radio started in Assam for the first time in Shillong, she became its first announcer. She became a staff artist, singer, news reader and drama artist.\n\nAlthough many offers poured in after Parghat she missed out on some important ones.\n\n“Bimal Roy sent me a letter with 80 rupees. He was making a movie called Tothapi and he wanted me to play the lead role of a dumb lady. After Tothapi the next to follow would be the Hindi film Bandini, a role that would later go to Nutan. I told my husband that I don't want to go. I returned the money and told him that I will not be able to take that offer. Had I acted in that movie my stature might have been very different probably. Then another offer came. It was a film called Shesher Kobita. However, I had an accident at the time just before shooting and I was expecting at that time. So that offer was also gone. After that I did Assamese films, Sorapat and Piyoli Phukan.” PC Baruah offered her a role too for a movie which was to be like Joymati but unfortunately he passed away before he could start the movie.\n\nMostly seen in maternal roles on screen despite not being very aged at the time, she laughs as she explains this, “I love pathos and I am a very kind hearted person. Maybe that is why directors loved to offer me the role of a mother.”\n\nMore offers kept coming in. She did some Bengali movies with actors like Nitish Roy and Ahindra Choudhury.\n\nDirectors she worked with\n\n“I will be forever grateful to Bolin da (Phani Sharma). He was a great director for me. Although, he was a very strict man he loved equally. Nip Baruah was also a good director, very calm and quiet. Despite all troubles, they dedicated themselves to the craft. On some days, shooting would be wrapped up in half a day. But nobody gave up.”\n\nThen and now\n\nThe world of acting seems a very different place today. “Everything is so technically advanced today. When we were shooting Piyoli Phukan, even a lizard had to be taken to Kolkata because the colour of a lizard in Kolkata was different from the lizard in Assam. We would stay for months at one place to complete the shooting but today a young college girl who is also an actress can come and give a shot during the lunch break and leave. We don't know what makeup was or dress designer was. We would dress on our own. Today there are books providing instructions on each and every aspect of acting. We went from an environment of thorns and in that context I sometimes think that maybe we have given a lot to films in Assam.”,\n\nA proud mother and a housewife, today she hopes that the new generation should know about artists like her. “Many of the new ones do not know about us. They have not even heard about us. Today cinema is like Bombay type. Directors give so much freedom today. I wouldn't blame the young actors of today. It is the responsibility of the director to extract the best out of an actor. Our boys and girls act well. If our producers had the money they would also do well. But still we need to improve”.\n\nAge may have robbed her of many things but her passion for acting is still alive. “Although, I have aged and I am old, I am still desirous of acting. If I get a good role I think I would do it well,” she says.\n\nMemorable roles\n\nRole of Meghali in Puberun.\n\nRole of Seuti in Piyoli Phukan.\n\nAudio interview with Jnanada Kakati\n\nhttp://tindeck.com/player/v1/player.swf?trackid=svss\n\nThe tag of a ‘villain’ doesn't bother Abdul Majid but he thinks people are afraid of him.\n\nIt happened one afternoon on some nameless day in the early nineties. Abdul Majid was shopping in Fancy Bazaar with his family. In those days there were no restrictions on smoking and while his wife and others busied themselves with shopping, Majid lit a cigarette. Suddenly, he was aware of a lot of eyes on him and hushed panicky voices of some women. “He is here. Let us go out. Go…go” In a matter of a minute the shop was empty. It was not the first time and certainly, not the last time. Curious neighbours or fearful classmates would often ask his family members, “Is he like this at home too? Does he beat you?”\n\nAll testimonies to the acting prowess of a multi-faceted actor but perhaps best remembered as the granddad of all villains in Assamese cinema.\n\nThe beginnings\n\nBorn on November 16, 1931 in Jorhat but officially recorded as May 1, 1932, the young Abdul Majid was attracted to films and theatres from a very young age. Recalling his first brush with cinema, Majid says, “There was a godown of the agricultural department near my house and there used to be a man there called Didaruddin Ahmed, a neatly dressed man in a dhoti, pump shoe and kameez with his finely combed back brushed hair. He used to take me with him to the Jorhat theatre. Occasionally, I would be taken backstage where he would dress up according to his role and sometimes as a woman. I used to find this very funny. Sometimes we used to watch Jatra parties from Kolkata. I always loved watching but never thought that I would act in films or theatre. Sometimes some of us would get together in someone's house and some of the boys would perform a play using bed sheets and other household implements as our equipment. This was my initiation to the world of theatre”.\n\nHe little suspected that these childhood skirmishes with theatre and cinema would one day result in fame and become a way of life for him.\n\nBeing a culturally vibrant place and home to doyens of Assamese culture such as Hem Baruah and Indreswar Sarma there was a tradition in Jorhat that matriculation candidates would enact a play. The young Majid used to assist but one day someone failed to turn up and Majid was asked to enact the absentee's role. Although hesitant, the initial reticence disappeared when onlookers applauded him for his acting. Thus, once started, there was no looking back.\n\nMajid was part of the club called Kristi Sangha under which they started enacting the plays. With the latent talent bursting forth, the youth were soon advised by lot of people to start writing their own plays instead of enacting Bengali plays written by others, which was a norm at the time. Majid eagerly took to the task. Bonchitaa , his first play was written in 1957. Then came Dhuli Makoti followed by Sur and Sampoorno Mahabharata. Much later his play Sihot Ahise found place in a Sahitya Akademi collection of plays.\n\nEarly days\n\nWhen he and his friends were around 24 -25, a wild idea about making a movie crept into their minds; wild because they had no idea about where the money would come from. “We went to Syed Abdul Malik to make his novel Matir saki into a film. He gave the go ahead. At the same time, the premiere of Smritir Porokh was being held in Jorhat for which Brojen Baruah and Nip Baruah had come. We went to meet them. We called them to watch Ronga Police. They watched the play and suggested that we should instead make Ronga Police as this would make a great movie. So we went ahead with that. 10 June 1957 – It was the mohurat of Ronga Police and the first day I came to be associated with movies.”\n\n“I played the role of an anti-hero in the movie. I wouldn't call it negative. I tried to portray the character differently because I had done it numerous times on stage,” says Majid. It worked and his role was appreciated by many and his particular style of walking was even copied.\n\nMore movies followed and all the while he continued to engage with the medium where he first started -theatre- and gave memorable performances in plays like Spartacus, Srimanta Sankardev, Bhagawan Sri Krishna, Jibon Driver and Bazarot Omola among others.\n\nChameli Memsaheb\n\nIn 1975 came, Chameli Memsaheb, the second directorial venture of Abdul Majid (after Morom Trishna), a movie that would go on to win national awards for best Assamese feature film(Rajat Kamal award) and also be the first Assamese film to be screened at the Rashtrapati Bhawan. After reading the short story by Nirod Choudhury, Abdul Majid wrote the screenplay for the same and showed it to Choudhury who gave the go ahead for the same. Despite stiff opposition to the casting of Binita Borgohain as Chameli, a girl from the tea gardens, owing to her mongoloid looks, Majid decided to go ahead. He explains his choice. “I knew the acting skills of Binita so there was never any doubt in my mind about her acceptance in the eyes of the audience. The end result was there for all to see”. The film took the box office by storm and more than 30 years after the movie released it is still regarded as an Assamese classic.\n\nIt also gave him the role of Monglu, the misguided and lovelorn boy in love with Chameli, a role which he regards as one of his best performances. More directorial ventures followed in the form of Banahangsa and Banjui but he was still a few years away from becoming the synonym for villain in Assamese cinema.\n\nVillain 101\n\nIn 1985, Pulok Gogoi directed Sendur, a social drama laced with healthy doses of action. A protesting Abdul Majid was convinced by the director that no one else could play the role of Jagat Barua, an evil zamindar and the rest is folklore today. Sendur became a super hit and Abdul Majid the villain was born. “Pulok Gogoi made me a villain. I didn't want to take up the role initially but Gogoi coaxed me saying that no one else would be able to do justice to the role.”\n\nHits like Puja and Suruj followed and the image of Abdul Majid the evil man became entrenched in the minds of the masses.\n\nIt would not be an exaggeration to say that apart from Dinesh Das, another epitome of onscreen devilry in Assamese cinema, nobody else has defined ‘villain’ more aptly on screen than Abdul Majid.\n\nSo who is a villain and what are the traits needed to play a villain? Majid says, “There has to be a character to a villain. Nobody can become a villain just for the sake of being bad. How does the script make or present the villain? That is important. If we see Maniram Dewan, Upaja Matir Sun, Brojen Baruah's role in Dr Bezbaruah those can be called villains.”\n\nSurprisingly, the bad man on screen has never enacted any villainous roles in theatre.\n\nOn the present status of Assamese cinema\n\nAssamese films might never have attained the rank of an ‘industry’ but most of the veterans cannot help but feel a pang of sadness at its present plight. Majid is no different. He sums up the present scenario succinctly when he says, “They are making films in the Assamese language but the films are not Assamese.”\n\n“It's not that good films are not being made but the majority disappoint. You have to look at where you are. You have to look at who your audience is. There is too much emphasis on glamour without substance. Where is the glamour in Assam? Where is the glamour in the Assamese films? There is no need for it.”\n\nNot too happy with the mobile theatre scenario in the state which he believes apes too much of the Hindi film industry he has some words of advice for them too. “If mobile theatre keeps on moving on at this rate one fine day suddenly it will collapse. When people become fed up of looking at all this they will stop paying them to watch it.”\n\nNever one to sit idle, when he was not facing the camera, he was behind it producing immensely popular serials like Naamghoriya and Jor Puri Haat or directing culturally relevant documentaries like Puppet Dance of Assam, Azan Fakir, Bahadur Gaonburha, Music and dances of Goalpara, Rituals, Customs and culture of the Rabhas of Assam.\n\nToday, more than 50 years after his first film, this doyen of Assamese cinema is still busy with acting in and directing projects. Still active he has just finished shooting for a film and is on the lookout for interesting scripts. For his contribution to Assamese cinema, this untiring servant of culture was given a lifetime achievement award in 2010 under the banner of Prag cine awards besides being awarded numerous times by the state government and other private organizations chief among them being the Bishnu Prasad Rabha award in 1986.\n\nClick on the ‘play’ button below to listen to how he started his career.\n\nhttp://tindeck.com/player/v1/player.swf?trackid=tzpa\n\nThe beauty of simplicity\n\nMridula Barooah – the name evokes a vivid image of an alluringly beautiful village girl, the kind that you read about in story books and the girl every man fancies to take home to their mother. Setting many a heart aflutter with her looks and acting prowess, this beautiful lady was one of the few leading ladies of the small but purposeful Assamese film industry, from the late 70s and 80s, till the early nineties.\n\nEarly days\n\nHailing from the small town of Sootea, in Sonitpur district of Assam, the Barooah family comprising of six children and the parents moved to Biswanath Chariali. Her father, Jogendranath Barooah, was the ‘outdoor incharge’ at the Pratapgarh tea estate and it was from here that the young Mridula Barooah started her theatrical journey by acting in dramas in school.\n\nRecalling her introduction to acting she says, “As a child, I and my siblings went to watch movies and films with child artists in them used to be a great source of observation for us. After coming back we would compete with each other to re-enact the scenes that we had seen.”\n\nHowever, her initiation into acting came much later. “Due to varied reasons I didn’t act in school plays earlier than the 10th standard. I was a painfully shy girl and the school was in Sootea, which was quite far from my home at the Pratapgarh tea estate. However, when I was in the tenth standard I decided enough was enough and that year I took part in everything right from games to drama and won prizes too!”\n\nIt was here that she received the third prize in the drama competition, the first of many awards to follow.\n\nAnother stepping stone for her imminent film career was when she received the first prize at a state level drama competition (All Assam Surjya Bora Memorial one act play competition) when she was in college.\n\nIt was here amidst this culturally vibrant atmosphere that she was discovered by director/ actor Abdul Majid who had gone to enact a role in a movie. She was promptly signed up for her first film Upopath (opposite Pranjal Saikia) with Hemanta Dutta as director and Pramod Baruah as producer. In the meantime, actor Hiren Choudhury too, saw this young girl at work and told director Dwijendra Narayan Deb who was looking for new faces for his film, Moromi. Mridula Barooah was offered the title role and thus at the young age, she had two roles opposite leading stars of the day and was juggling college and films at the same time.\n\n“I still don’t know how everything happened but it is all thanks to these people. Everybody was very nice and cooperative. They perhaps saw something in me and thus I was offered two roles in two films so quickly.” Although Upopath was her first signed film, Moromi was her first released film.\n\nUnlike in many cases, there was no resistance towards her acting career on the part of her parents. “There was only one condition and that was to be good at whatever I did.” And she did more than ‘good’.\n\nIn 1979, came the film Megha Mukti, where she played the role of twin sisters (the first double role in Assamese films) which established her among the public but it was the twin super hits of Buwari and Kokadeuta, Nati aru Hati which did away with any remaining doubts as to her acting abilities and firmly cemented her place in the hearts of the people.\n\nSuccess followed with films like Maa and Protima which incidentally were films with women centric roles, roles where many a time she had to essay characters older than her real age.\n\nReflecting on this she says, “The eighties was a very good era for Assamese films in all senses and maybe it was due to the society of the period that directors were focusing more on women centric roles. Today, of course, it’s a quite different scenario.”\n\nIn the nineties, when she was at her peak, however roles and films dried up due to unrest of secessionist groups and a general demise of production houses.\n\nAlthough, it would be difficult for viewers to let go of the image of the sweet innocent rustic girl attached to her, she still essayed few different roles whenever she was offered one. In Hiya Diya Niya she essayed a negative role, in Dr Bhabendra Nath Saikia’s Kaal Sandhya , where she had a guest appearance; she played the character of an innocent woman who submits to the vagaries of fate and has shades of grey. Similarly her roles in Aborton, Itihaas and Gun Gun Gaane Gaane fetched her critical acclaim.\n\nToday, she is quite content with the way things have panned out and her long journey from lead actress to a matriarchal guide on screen. “You do feel it when suddenly you realize one day that you are no longer going to be the leading lady but it is only momentary. Playing my own age is what gives me immense satisfaction now,” says Barooah.\n\nAdding to her repertoire, she also turned producer in the early 2000s and produced serials for Doordarshan. She also produced documentaries for the state government.\n\nDue to a persistent leg ailment she had to spend five years from 2007 to 2011 on the sidelines but now she is ready to face the lights again and has recently completed shooting for the film Bir Chilarai.\n\nShe is however hopeful that the good times of Assamese films would come back. “The new generation of artists is very talented and if they gain access to more resources they could definitely do a lot better.”\n\nThings you did not know about her and a few memorable moments\n\nShe had an immense desire to be a teacher, a desire she nourishes till date.\n\nFavourite actor – Amitabh Bachchan.\n\nFavourite actress – Jaya Bachchan.\n\nFavourite performance of her own – Protima, Itihas, Gungun Gaane, Ahir Bhairav.\n\nMemorable moments in her own words\n\nIn the film, Shakuntala aru Shankar Joseph Ali, my character dies towards the end. My ‘body’ was carried through the streets of Guwahati on a mini truck. Now most people obviously didn’t know that it was not a real funeral procession and so many started paying their respects from a distance. The truck was just passing a city bus and it so happened that there was a young boy standing on the doorstep. The cameras were not rolling at the moment so I decided to open my eyes for a second. It was at that precise moment that the boy’s eyes and my eyes met as he was about to gesture as a mark of respect towards my ‘body’. To this day, I cannot forget the look on his face. I cannot describe that look. I guess it was a mix of terror and horror for him.\n\nBrief bio-data\n\nBirthday:\n\nApril 14\n\nAwards:\n\n(The list given is not the complete list but a brief representation)\n\nBest actress for Kokadeuta, Nati aru Hati in 1984 awarded by Assam Silpi Samity\n\nBest supporting actress for Maa in 1987, awarded by Eastern India Motion Pictures\n\nLife time contribution to the Assamese film industry award in 2006 by Yotirupa, Assam\n\nAssam state govt. award for best supporting actor in 2005\n\nAs a Producer:\n\nProduced documentaries for Doordarshan.\n\nExcerpt from Buwari:\n\nThe origin of Assamese Cinema can be traced back to the dreams and imagination of a revolutionary visionary, Rupkonwar Jyotiprasad Agarwala, who was also a distinguished poet, playwright, composer and freedom fighter. He was instrumental in the production of the first Assamese Film Joymati, under the banner of Critrakala Movietone. Due to the lack of trained technicians, Jyotiprasad, , had to shoulder the added responsibilities of the script writer, producer, director, choreographer, editor, set and costume designer, lyricist and music director while making his maiden film. The film, completed with a budget of Rupees sixty thousand was released on March 10th, 1935. It was the third Indian talkie to be released, a fact unknown to many. It is unfortunate that like so many early Indian films, the negatives and complete prints of Joymati are missing.\n\nThe film did not do well and Jyotiprasad Agarwala had to endure heavy losses. However, despite the failure of his venture, Jyotiprasad made another film after a lapse of two years titled Indramalati (1939). It was his second and last film. The eminent composer and singer of Assam Dr. Bhupen Hazarika, played a stellar role in the film.. With the passing away of Jyotiprasad, the Assamese film scenario witnessed a temporary lull for about a couple of years.
