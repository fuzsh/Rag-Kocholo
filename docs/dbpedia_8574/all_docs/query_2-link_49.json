        "text": "Book Two of this International Epic Saga Takes You in Perilous 5-Country Pursuit of Ruthless Criminals through Asian Cities and Jungles\n\nPraise from early readers:\n\n\"The horrific inside story of elephant poaching is a global epic.\"\n\n\"Book 2 gives me hope that the killing can be stopped through relentless, heroic police work.\"\n\n\"The intriguing cast of characters from the first book has been expanded with an engaging range of Asian heroes and villains.\"\n\n\"Now I'm sure it's a movie! Will Jackie Chan play Siri? Has Li Bing Bing signed for the role of Suchong? Will Moloya Goswami play Parbati?\"\n\n\"Environmental crime writing reaches a new level!\"\n\n\"I was thrilled to see Malinga step onto the international stage. Let's hope she's with us for a long, long time.\"\n\n\"The never-been-told story of rapacious international environmental crime. A chilling eye-opener! A nightmare of corruption!\"\n\nAs Deputy Inspector Malinga Mutende of the Zambian CID closes the gap in pursuit of international elephant poachers, they play fast and dirty, taking everything she holds dear. Catapulted from an idyllic safari vacation into the dangerous world of international elephant poaching when she witnesses a massive helicopter slaughter in Zambia's idyllic Kafue National Park, DI Malinga refuses to give up although her children and her lover are threatened. This six-country epic will leave you breathless as Malinga returns triumphant to Zambia, but loses what she holds dear.\n\nJoin Malinga on the second leg of her international pursuit!\n\nIn this five-star follow-up to Elephant Murders | Starbuck, Malinga investigates a tangled and mushrooming web of conspirators and allies. Is Vietnamese Environmental Minister Nguyen Trai helping the poachers? Can Malinga trust the the mystic powers of her new friend, Lao coroner, Siri? Does the Burmese bandit escape the Chinese rocket attack? Does Malinga? How do Parbati's elephants capture the poachers? Will Malinga's children, Shiko and Katanga, survive the kidnapping? Is Malinga's lover ranger captain Eitone Mazoka and smooth-talking Zambian Wildlife Authority boss Stephan Bwalya conspiring to disappear with the ivory? Does Basil the hippo have Elvis's body?\n\nNo one, even her new lover, tantalizing amber-eyed park ranger Eitone Mazoka, can be eliminated from Malinga's list of suspects. What are the elephants trying to tell her? Torn between loyalty to her children and her commitment to protect her national heritage, Malinga must decide just how far she'll go to save the elephants from another holocaust. Jammed with larger-than-life characters, human as well as animal, Elephant Murders depicts the changing reality of human-animal relationships and its planetary cost.\n\nElephant Murders: Justice is the second volume in a trilogy about elephant poaching in Africa and Asia featuring Zambian Detective Inspector Malinga Mutende. The first volume, Elephant Murders: Starbuck, was released in March 2015, and the third volume, Elephant Murders: Memories in May 2015."
