        "text": "The film, which won Saikia two National Awards for best film and best screenplay, will be shown at the Nehru Centre, the cultural wing of the Indian High Commission, on August 14 in collaboration with the Assamese community of London.\n\n\"A man with an ingenious career that dominated the creative spheres of Assam for years, Saikia was a maestro of the cinematic form and the written word. The screening of this film is a tribute to him,\" Rini Kakati of the Assam Association of UK said in a statement.\n\nSaikia, who obtained his PhD in nuclear physics from London University, developed an interest in filmmaking while teaching at Gauhati University.\n\nSeven of his movies -- \"Sandhya Rag\", \"Anirban\", \"Agnisnan\", \"Kolahal\", \"Sarothi\", \"Abarton\" and \"Itihas\" -- bagged the Rajat Kamal award for best regional films.\n\nHe also tried his hand at Hindi movies with \"Kaal Sandhya\", which dwelt on militancy and had Ashish Vidyarthi in the lead role.\n\n\"Agnisnan\", starring Moloya Goswami and Biju Phukan, is considered Saikia's most touching film in which he depicted the life of commoners, their hopes and despair, dreams and nightmares, values and morals and the struggle for survival, both physically and intellectually."
