Simon & Schuster's website also includes a description of the book.

"A deliciously witty and inspiring memoir by One Tree Hill star Bethany Joy Lenz about her decade in a cult and her quest to break free," it states.

"In the early 2000s, after years of hard work and determination to breakthrough as an actor, Bethany Joy Lenz was finally cast as one of the leads on the hit drama One Tree Hill. Her career was about to take off, but her personal life was slowly beginning to unravel," it continues.

"What none of the show‚Äôs millions of fans knew, hidden even from her costars, was her secret double life in a cult.

"An only child who often had to fend for herself and always wanted a place to belong, Lenz found the safe haven she‚Äôd been searching for in a Bible study group with other Hollywood creatives.

"However, the group soon morphed into something more sinister‚Äîa slowly woven web of manipulation, abuse, and fear under the guise of a church covenant called The Big House Family.

"Piece by piece, Lenz began to give away her autonomy, ultimately relocating to the Family‚Äôs Pacific Northwest compound, overseen by a domineering minister who would convince Lenz to marry one of his sons and steadily drained millions of her TV income without her knowledge.

"Family 'minders' assigned to her on set, 'Maoist struggle session'‚Äìinspired meetings in the basement of a filthy house, and regular counseling with 'Leadership' were just part of the tactics used to keep her loyal.

"Only when she became a mother did Lenz find the courage to leave and spare her child from a similar fate. After nearly a decade (and with the unlikely help of a One Tree Hill superfan), she finally managed to escape the family‚Äôs grip and begin to heal from the deep trauma that forever altered her relationship with God and her understanding of faith.

"Written with powerful honesty and dark humor, Dinner for Vampires is an inspiring story about the importance of identity and understanding what you believe."

Lenz also spoke to People about Dinner for Vampires.

"I'm a writer at heart, so turning a phrase is easy for me. Exploring the memories, and really facing them, can be challenging ‚Äî but I‚Äôm doing it," she said.

"Recovery looks different for everyone, depending on your experience of trauma. I had to start from a baseline of my personal understanding of God and the experiences I had had.

"And then there was a lot of going back to who I was before and remembering that, and then acknowledging that there was so much I just didn‚Äôt know."
