The song "Mrs. Scott" by Bethany Joy Galeotti is a wistful and romantic expression of a young woman's desire for marriage and the ideal life that comes with it. She paints a picture of a perfect wedding day, complete with a beautiful dress and a hat with a sheer tailored veil. She wants the dress to have a pink sash to match the Swarovski glass beads she envisions wearing. The day is to be full of love and joy.

Beyond the wedding day, the song expresses a desire for the kind of life that goes with being married - a house on the hill, children named Jack and Jill, and a dog in the yard, all surrounded by a white picket fence. The romantic vision is completed by a powder blue car, representing a carefree and happy life together. The singer speaks of how lovely it would be to have a life full of love.
