It's unclear how many episodes she will be in, but she is definitely in the first three episodes.\n\nThe beautiful Jana Kramer , who just came off playing Portia Ranson on CW’s “90210″, has just been hired to join one of their other shows “One Tree Hill”. She will play a model and actress named Alexis who will be the new face of Brooke’s clothing line. She is also an adrenaline junkie and a diva who loves parties and is used to always getting her way. Along with having played a recurring role in CW’s “90210″, she also showed up in six episodes of “Friday Night Lights. (credit to ontheflix.com)\n\n(6/17/09) 'One Tree Hill' exclusive: Meet Haley's sister! | News, One Tree Hill | Ausiello Files | EW.com One Tree Hill's post Peyton-Lucas makeover continues: Sources confirm to me exclusively that relative newcomer Shantel VanSanten has been tapped to play the series regular role of Quinn, one of Haley's free-spirited older sisters. The character comes to Tree Hill with a wounded heart and in search of someone new to shag something new. VanSanten, who will be seen in the upcoming Final Destination reboot, joins fellow Tree Hill virgin Robert Buckley as the newest additions to the show's cast. The Lipstick Jungle hottie is playing Nathan's sports agent.\n\nRobert Buckley, who famously played Kim Raver's Lipstick Jungle boy toy and subsequently did a turn on Privileged, will resurface this fall on the CW's One Tree Hill. Buckley will play Clayton, the sports agent who takes on NBA-bound Nathan as a client and friend, says the Hollywood Reporter. Brian Austin Green was until recently eyed for this series regular role, but ultimately a deal could not be worked out. Buckley's Tree Hill gig stems from a holding deal he had with Privileged producer Warner Bros. TV. One Tree Hill is adding three new characters for Season 7, as the show moves on without longtime leads Hilarie Burton and Chad Michael Murray. The two characters remaining to be cast are Haley's sister and a model working for Brooke. (TV Guide)\n\nOne Tree Hill News: MAJOR UPDATE HERE: and for your eyes first... Austin Nichols has signed with One Tree Hill for 2 years. So he will definitely be back next season, and if the show lives on, he will be back for at least one more. Sophia Bush has also resigned from what I hear. So it looks like the Brooke/Julian relationship will keep growing! (posted 4/13/09 on Austinnicholsfan.com)\n\nKeedar Whittle (Nino) is apparently returning for season seven. The Atlanta native is happy that his 'One Tree Hill' character Nino Jones will be returning when show comes back for its seventh season in the fall. \"My character will be back next season but if I can write my own storyline, I would fall in love with one of the main characters or become Nathan's best friend and make sure I'm on every Monday,\" Whittle said. ''One Tree Hill' is an extreme blessing. I'm completely thankful for the opportunity. It's great just being apart of a major production and a well-oiled machine.\" Full interview: Keedar Whittle: Hell Date Star Loves Life On One Tree Hill\n\n◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊\n\nOne Tree Hill - Exclusive first look at Season 7 New Characters\n\n[CLAYTON] (played by Robert Buckley, as noted above)\n\nLate 20s, handsome. A young and brash sports agent who represents Nathan Scott’s basketball interests, Clayton is a rising star at his agency and has become a close friend, ally, business partner and advisor to Nathan. A bit of a lothario, Clayton unapologetically enjoys the spoils that are available to a young, wealthy, handsome single guy, while always separating business from pleasure, and remaining fiercely protective of Nathan.\n\n[QUINN]\n\nMid to late 20s, very pretty. One of Haley’s older sisters, Quinn is a free spirit but can also be dependable and kind. Strong-willed, self-assured but also self-effacing, Quinn is facing a transitional time in her life, one that will bring her to Tree Hill with a wounded heart and in search of something more...SERIES REGULAR.\n\n[ALEXIS]\n\n20s, gorgeous. Alexis is a model/actress and the new face of Brooke’s clothing line. Alexis is an adrenaline junkie and a bit of a diva who is used to getting her way. Book smart and street wise, Alexis uses her wiles to navigate the sometimes treacherous waters of her profession. She has also never met a party she didn’t like, a habit that may inhibit or accelerate her transition from model to actress, depending on who crosses her path sptv050769. PLEASE SUBMIT ALL ETHNICITIES...SERIES REGULAR.\n\nSource: SpoilerTV\n\nSeason 7 News\n\nMONDAY 8:00-9:00 P.M. \"ONE TREE HILL\"\n\nIn season seven of ONE TREE HILL our beloved characters learn the struggle to live an exceptional life doesn't end once you've achieved your dreams.

With only a handful of episodes under his belt, Buckley tells me that his sports agent alter ego has already “been kissed by pretty much every female character on the show. He’s a little bit of a playboy.”\n\n(7/22/09) Question: Do you know if Kate Voegele, Ashley Rickards, and Stephen Colletti will be reprising their roles as Mia, Sam, and Chase next season on One Tree Hill? Jillian\n\nAusiello: Yes, maybe, and yes.\n\n(6/28/09) A One Tree Hill rep is now confirming what I first hinted at in Ask Ausiello: The bitch is back! Danneel Harris has closed a deal to reprise her role as pot-stirrer Rachel Gatina in at least seven episodes next season, beginning with eppy 7.02. Harris made her Tree Hill debut as Brooke's high school nemesis in season 3 but wasn't made a series regular until season 4. She was written out in season 5 after only a handful of episodes, an apparent victim of the show's four-year flash forward.\n\n(6/17/09) Question: There have been rumors that Danneel Harris is returning as Rachel on One Tree Hill in the season 7. Is this true? --Cameron\n\nAusiello: The rumors are true. Rachel will be back next season for an arc.\n\n(6/8/09) Meanwhile, One Tree Hill -- which famously leaped ahead four years at the start of season 5 -- is mulling another flash forward at the onset of season 7 this fall. But this one's not nearly as drastic; a OTH source says the action would likely pick up just one year later.\n\n(Ausiello at EW.com)\n\n◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊\n\nKristen @ E!

She’s doing just one or possibly two episodes of Melrose, so that won’t conflict with OTH. Her return to OTH is just dependent on their storylines.\n\n(8/3/09) Marc in Keene, Neb.: Any Brooke Davis news? I love me some Sophia Bush on One Tree Hill.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Sophia Bush tells us that good things are on the way for B. Davis on One Tree Hill this season. “It’s really exciting for Brooke this year, with her business [and] her relationship with Julian (Austin Nichols),” says Sophia. “Brooke and her mother had a beautiful ending to their story last year, and I’m really excited to explore that as well with Daphne [Zuniga]. It’s going to be really good.” Yay! Finally some happiness for our favorite Tree Hiller.\n\nCordelia in Fairfax, Del.: Thanks for the One Tree Hill scoop last week! Any word on what will happen in the premiere?\n\nThe One Tree Hill gang gets together to celebrate little Jamie’s birthday after a one-year time jump. Little J’s party brings together the castmembers you already know and love and some of the fresh faces we’ve told you about. Newbie Shantel VanSanten (Quinn) attends the festivities, and she tells us: “The episode is an introduction to all of the new characters. I come to Jamie’s birthday party [because] I haven’t seen them in a while. It’s reconnecting with the family, and I get to smash Jamie’s face into a cake!” Robert Buckley’s Clay shows up, too, with a special guest in tow. “I surprise Jamie by actually bringing Jerry Rice to sign his Jerry Rice jersey,” says Robert.\n\nMiracle in Australia: What’s the deal with Robert Buckley’s character on One Tree Hill?\n\nSports-agent stereotypes aside, it sounds like Robert Buckley’s character, Clay, is a pretty cool dude. “Clay’s a great agent. He hustles and gets what he goes for, but there is a good deal of compassion and loyalty to him,” Robert tells us. Still, expect a little drama heading his way. This is One Tree Hill, after all. “He’s got a lot of mystery to him, a lot of likeable qualities,” says Buckley, “but maybe not a lot of accessible likable qualities.”\n\n◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊ ◊\n\nSpecial thanks goes to Ausiello at EW, OTH Fans, OTH Forums, Showfax, E!, the CW official site, countless fans and our many anonymous sources who help maintain the accuracy of this thread during the season.\n\nLast edited by curlyhead; 09-21-2009 at 08:48 PM"
