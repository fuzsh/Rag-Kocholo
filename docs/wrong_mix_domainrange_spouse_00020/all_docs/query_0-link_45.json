        "text": "Haines, Caelie M. “GL Celebrates 60 Shining Years.” Soap Opera Weekly, vol. 8, no. 4, 28 Jan. 1997. pp. 2-3.\n\nHaving a Ball!\n\nThe anniversary ball to celebrate Cedars Hospital’s 60th anniversary brings passion, pathos, and plenty of surprises to Springfield’s residents this week on Guiding Light. Reva arrives at the affair with her usual style, spoiling Annie’s hopes for sharing a special evening with Josh. Annie’s happiness is further threatened when Reva strikes up a conversation with Fran, but Annie finds a way to get Josh to focus on her. However, she can’t keep Josh’s attention for very long, and in desperation turns to Alan for help in keeping her man.\n\nJenna doesn’t need any help keeping her man. Since Jenna’s return, Buzz’s attention has shifted fully from Reva to her. At that ball, she and Buzz circle each other warily, but they can’t deny the attraction between them, and by Dinah and Jena-Luc also find themselves in a potentially passionate situation when a turn on the dance floor leads to a heated tango. Reva and Billy push up the temperature even more when they turn the tango into a front of everyone, leading Dinah to end the night in Jean-Luc’s arms.\n\nRoger, too, is thrown together with a former love. After getting out of a tangled situation with Amanda at the Spaulding mansion, Roger heads for the lighthouse and is surprised to find Holly alone on the beach.\n\nThere’s little time for catching up, however, when an emergency forces them to turn their attention elsewhere. A distress signal comes in from a capsized boat just as Zachary and Michelle are having an emotional confrontation about their future. The young couple rallies together the citizens of Springfield – friends and enemies alike- hoping to get the lighthouse up and running tin time to save the boaters’ lives.\n\nSpringfield’s Finest Remember When\n\nNo other program has ever reached the milestone that Guiding Light hits Jan. 25: 60 years of broadcast history. “In a buisness as transient as this one, 60 years of anything is astounding,” Says GL‘s longest-running cast member, Jerry ver Dorn (Ross). “I’m not sure what’s made it last. Irna (Phillips, GL‘s creator) had a good idea from the beginning and it’s never really varied over the years. People still love to see their ‘shadow family’ get married, have children and do all the things that paralell real life.”\n\nMichael O’Leary (Rick Bauer) thinks that keeping the focus on the family is the key to GL“s success. “The loss of Charita (Bauer, who played Bert Bauer), William Roerick (Henry Chamberlain), and Larry Gates (H.B. Lewis) is a reminder how important it is to keep traditions going for the next generation and to keep families the focus of everything,” he says. “When it gets right down to it, the simplest and best stories are not the ones with parties and all that stuff, but the ones with people having a conversation across the table or talking one-on-one. They tinker with the themes of daytime – it’s always trying to reinvent itself – but essentially people want to see good romance and good, strong relationships.”\n\nThey also want good acting, which Kim Zimmer (Reva Shayne Lewis) says GL has in spades. “Betty Rea (GL’s recently retired casting director) always had such a flair for casting. We have a cast and a crew who have been around for a long time and are totally devoted to the show. They might bitch and moan, but if this show was taken away tomorrow, these people would have a piece of their life taken away.”\n\nThat would certainly be the case for Elizabeth Keifer (Blake Marler), who has been a fan of the show for 15 years. “A girlfriend of mine went on a soap, and I mistakenly thought it was Guiding Light, so I watched for two weeks, looking for her,” she recalls. “I finally realized she was on another show, so I watched for her for 2 weeks, looking for her,” she recalls. “I finally realized she was on another show, so I watched her there for one day, but then I went back to Guiding Light. I loved Ross and Vanessa. I just remember her in that fur coat. It was a wonderful challenge [living up to Vanessa’s reputation], but I thought, “Hell, I can do this!” And Maeve (Kinkead, Vanessa Chamberlain) is so sweet in real life, she made me feel less intimidated.”\n\nThe friendliness of the cast stands out in Fiona Hutchison‘s (Jenna Bradshaw) mind when she thinks of her favorite GL moments. “When we were doing Frank and Eleni’s wedding, it was like a movie set, she remembers. “The cameras were on cranes and it was shot like a movie, and we worked until 5 the next morning. Some of us had only 2 hours’ sleepbefore we had to start working all over again. When you do that you get into overdrive, in and punchy, too, so it was so much fun.”\n\nGL is fun for Keifer now, too, but when she first started, the job was a bit nerve-racking. “I remember coming in form my screen test and seeing Jerry ver Dorn go down the hallway and getting goose bumps because I was so excited and starstruck. I was afraid to introduce myself to Maureen Garrett (Holly Thorpe).”\n\nZimmer was afraid when it came time to tape Reva’s death on lcoation in Florida. “I can remember getting closer and closer to the site where they were filming the scenes where Josh kept diving and diving trying to find Reva,” she says. “There were all these emergency vehicles there, and I turned to our stage manager Adam (Reist), who was driving with me, and said ‘I guess it’s too late to change my mind.’ I had this awful feeling in the pit of my stomach, like it was all over.”\n\nGarrett also can’t forget being on location. “My most memorable moment was the location shoot in Santo Domingo. It was like shooting a movie, and we were playing our age-old story which will never die. For so long we turned away from Roger and Holly even relating to each other. I didn’t understand that. I guess they were taking some kind of politically correct stance – you don’t have victims associate with their rapists. But there’s a lot more water under the bridge than that. This story is so much bigger. It had been a story of reconciliation, redemption, lost love. Those are very potent images, and there are still parts of that story for us to tell.”\n\nThe Roger/Holly relationship also holds a special place in Michael Zaslow‘s (Roger Thorpe) heart. His most memorable moments are all centered around Holly. “The rape of Holly almost 18 years also. Our experience in Santo Domingo, where Roger kidnapped Holly, and they went on the lam.”\n\nMany of ver Dorn‘s favorite GL moments also have to do with being part of a romantic twosome. “With Liz Keifer here, coming to work is like going to the playground every day; it’s heaven,” he says. “And I remember when I first came on, they actually had parties for new contract players. The cast was so warm, and that was such an honor, since the cast had been together 10,12, even 14 years. I remember the kindness of Charita, and the good storyline I had coming on, being Roger’s no-good lawyer. Then they brought Maeve Kinkead on – more good memories. I still enjoy being here, because seldom, if ever, have I had to repeat myself.”\n\nOctober 8, 2017 I attended the second annual real life Bauer BBQ. I had an amazing time. It wasn’t overly well attended, but it was a great group of people. I was so glad to talk with Guiding Light fans and a couple of people who even knew my blog. I was especially pleased to get to meet in person my online friend Elizabeth who does the Guiding Light discussion board. I’m going to write up a full report that I’ll save for Bauer BBQ week next year and a special post on a bit of Bauer BBQ history I managed to nail down.\n\nNOTE: For this post I’m going to use the term actors rather than actors and actresses or actors/actresses just for the flow of the post. However, I’m including both men and women in my statements.\n\nAbout Me\n\nNow, I normally don’t talk about me in this blog. My opinions and memories of the show? You bet. My family history with the show? All the time, but I don’t talk about my personal history much. That’s really not what this blog is for. However, this post I think I need to give you a little bit of my personal history for you to get the full impact of the last bit.\n\nNormally meeting actors isn’t that big a deal for me, even for shows I watched as a kid. There is another interest I have that is connected to a TV show I loved growing up. I’m there for events that often have a TV component (now a days I’m more for the research but if the TV stuff is there how can you not take part?). I certainly don’t make all of the events, but many are within a reasonable driving distance and so I get to quite a few, so many that a couple of the actors call me by name without prompting. I also have a cousin who is an actor and a father who is in the theater. So I know actors.\n\nAlso, while I was growing up, my mom had a job which had her, among many other things, do spots on local TV shows. Back then there were a lot more locally produced TV shows and she appeared on several on a regular basis, even being a guest host of one for about 6 weeks once. She usually had us come with her on one of the shows once or twice a year. So I know a little bit of TV from the other side of the camera, I know how the camera cues work, how hot the lights are (were? have they gone to LED and are they cooler than they used to be? No idea) and as a result how cold the studios were kept when you weren’t under the lights. I learned how green screen worked at a young age and knew that one of the local anchors always went on camera sock footed for some reason I never understood.\n\nSo my point is that I’m not normally all that excited to meet actors. They have a job. A pretty cool job which they are often very good at, but it’s just a job and one that I know a little bit about so a lot of stuff doesn’t impress me that might other people. I know in most cases who I really wanted to know is the characters and I know I can’t do that, so I’m pretty calm about meeting the actors who played them.\n\nBut…..\n\nSo I surprised with my reaction to some of the Guiding Light people. Honestly I knew I’d enjoy talking with other fans which I totally did (WAVES if any of you are reading this), but I wasn’t expecting as much of a reaction as I had to the actors. It wasn’t all of them of course. A couple of them were working the room and you could tell that’s what they were doing. I certainly admired the skill they showed at it, but that’s what it was — working a room. Some of the actors seemed much more interested in visiting with the other actors than the fans. But the magical bit was at the Bloss Brunch.\n\nIt was a small group and as early arrivers me and my friend Elizabeth (of Guiding Light Central) got to sit next to Jerry verDorn and Liz Keifer aka Ross and Blake. I had an actual conversation with them about soap history (with which they seemed impressed by my recall of long ago plot) and the current state of the industry which was fascinating. But it was a bit surreal. My vision even did a funny thing for a second when I first walked over to the table, like my mind couldn’t believe my eyes were working properly. I think it might have been that by the end their characters had become so like them, that it was like they WERE their characters at least a little bit. This was the third event of the weekend, but somehow they seemed the most real. For a just a flash there while we were talking I honestly felt that somehow I had stepped through the TV and had some magical way ended up in Springfield. Oddly it felt really normal as well. I had heard them talk on the TV for years and often talked back to it (I tend to get a bit vocal when I watch – see my YouTube comments). Only this time they could hear me. It just was natural, but in a wild dichotomy it was also absolutely amazing.\n\nI don’t know if I’ll go again soon. I have a couple of other trips I want to cross off my life list that I’ve scheduled for the next couple of years (a conference I’ve wanted to attend for at least 10 years in Canada and a family trip to Disney), but I hope that I’ll be able to make it to another Guiding Light event. This one was certainly worth the trip.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939. This blog is an effort to make it easy to find Guiding Light and especially Manny online. Check back here for her blog, find fanfic previews and fake WSPR newscasts on her YouTube, find podcasts that look back to old shows and audios of her fanfics on Blog Talk Radio, and finally follow her on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThis is the forty-seventh in an irregular feature where we will report updates on what cast members of Guiding Light are doing now. I’m playing catch up on some soap magazine news. So as a reminder you can buy back issues:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2010/11/27/faq-back-issues\n\nPaula Garces (Pilar Santos, Danny Santos’ little sister) was featured in the April 22, 2002 issue of People. Garces was featured for playing characters younger than her age. In 2012 she has continued to appear regularly on primetime episodic television. Judging from the photo, she’s no longer playing teenagers.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0305519\n\nRyan Brown (Bill Lewis III #4, who played Little Billy during the Bilar romance which crossed heavily with Manny) is featured in the “Where Are They Now?” in the March 20, 2012 Soap Opera Digest. I thought I knew a lot about him, but in this piece I learned his mother is author Sandra Brown and he met his wife Victoria Arbiter, who’s the “royal contributor” for The Early Show on CBS, while on Guiding Light. Find the article in Soap Opera Digest and check out his author page. http://www.ryanbrownauthor.com\n\nIn the February 3, 1997 issue of People Jerry ver Dorn (Ross Marler) was quoted as saying “I’m thoroughly convinced that we could go back to 1937 , do this in front of black drapes and if the story is good enough, they’d still watch. He didn’t know pretty much they’d be back to black drape without the good story to back them up all too soon.\n\nMarcy Rylan (Lizzie Spaulding Lewis #6, part of the wonderful Bizzie pairing) was the feature interview in the April 23, 2012 issue of CBS Soaps in Depth.\n\nBrian Gaskill (Dylan Lewis #2) was interviewed about his poetry album on Soap Central.\n\nhttp://soapcentral.com/radio/news/2012/120316-gaskill.php\n\nI found in the New York Times archive that Elizabeth (Betty) Rea died on December 23, 1999. She was the casting director of Guiding Light from 1970-1996 which would have included casting most of the iconic characters from the middle run of the show. During 1979-1983 she fulfilled the same function simultaneously on As the World Turns. She was inducted into the Soap Opera Hall of Fame. She had also won the Soap Opera Digest Editors Award and the Casting Society of America’s Hoyt Bowers Award.\n\nJoan Collins (Alexandra Spaulding #3) was interviewed about her role on Guiding Light in the November 4, 2002 issue of People. She said her biggest challenge was keeping “25 pages of dialogue in your head.” Cue cards weren’t allowed on set. “We rehearse five scenes and shoot them one after another. It’s like opening night at the theater.” – Find it full text in the Ebscohost Academic Search Complete.\n\nThe Harlem School of Arts provided a group of their students to be Michelle Bauer and Bill Lewis’ classmates appearing both at the prom and the graduation ceremony in 1997; among them: Letesha Hallet-Ridley, Wema Harris, Joanna Goodwin, and Tracy Johnson. A group photo was included in the July 5, 1997 issue of New York Amsterdam News. In 2012 none of those names are included in IMDB except Tracy Johnson which had too many with the same name to be sure if it was the same one.\n\nI found an article in the 12/6/2007 issue of New York Amsterdam News that Vannessa Simmons, the oldest daughter of Rev. Run aka Joseph Simmons of Run-DMC) had gotten a role on Guiding Light. A little digging turned up her character was named Lola. I don’t know anything else about her.\n\nhttp://www.tvfanatic.com/2007/08/vanessa-simmons-sheds-guiding-light-on-new-character\n\nHanne Lynn Anderson‘s marriage was announced in April 3, 2011 issue of The New York Times. Anderson, now. Mrs. Jack Vaughn Jr., had won an Emmy for multiple camera editing as a video editor on Guiding Light in 2008. As of 2011, she was a senior video editor at R/GA a digital advertising agency in New York. She has a few credits on IMDB.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm1950756\n\nBeth Chamberlain (Beth Raines Spaulding #2) gave a quote out during Guiding Light’s 70th Anniversary year. It appeared in the January 22, 2007 issue of Television Week. She talked about her experience meeting fans during her book tour for Loreli’s Diary. “Everywhere I went, there would be three, four generations of women there, and the great-grandmother had gotten the grandmother into the show, who got the mother into it. When I got back from that, I had a completely different perspective about being part of Guiding Light. I’m not just a part of a TV show, I’m part of mother-daughter tradition. It made me appreciate my job.”\n\nMark Schlereth, an ESPN analyst and former guard for both the Redskins and the Broncos, played detective Rock Hoover starting in 2007. Watch for him.\n\nMark Pinter (Mark, who had affairs with Amanda Spaulding and her biological mother Jennifer) and Colleen Zenk (Barbara Ryan on As the World Turns) are quoted in an article that discusses the real story behind their being married to other people and dumping them for each other. They married in 1987 and they divorced in 2010. Read more in March 20, 2012 issue of Soap Opera Digest.\n\nBeth Ehlers (Harley Cooper) and Mark Derwin (A.C. Mallet #1) discussed their relationship. Ehlers left her first husband for Derwin. They never married and even though they left Guiding Light together and were in a couple of other projects together, they broke up before very long. Read more in March 20, 2012 issue of Soap Opera Digest.\n\nAfter Kassie DePaiva (Chelsea Reardon, the youngest Reardon daughter) left Guiding Light, she took over the role of Blair on All My Children. She got involved with costar James DePaiva. They both divorced their then current spouses to be together in 1993. The DePaivas are still together. Read more in March 20, 2012 issue of Soap Opera Digest. DePaiva tweeted a photo of her and her husband and former One Life to Live costar Nathan Fillion.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/KassieDePaiva/status/198913373147119616/photo/1\n\nJames Lipton, best known for hosting Inside the Actors Studio, played a doctor (still looking for a name) on Guiding Light. He wrote scripts and apparently became head writer at one point.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0513851/bio\n\nJack Wood, a director of many soap operas including Guiding Light, died at age 82 as reported in the February 25, 2007 issue of the New York Times.\n\nCheryl Lynn Brown (Chrissy Blake Bauer, as a girl) was tracked down by People magazine for their March 14, 1994 issue. Brown was then a sophomore at Kean College in New Jersey. Then 20, Brown says “I got the part because I looked like the actress who played my mother.” Brown has no further entries in IMDB.\n\nDonna Swajeski (Guiding Light writer) was interviewed in the August 1999 issue of Victoria magazine. “Everybody comes up to me when they find out I write for the soaps. Usually they want to know how I started and how I keep coming up with new ideas,” says Donna. Twice nominated for an Emmy, Donna is a member of the five-person writing team responsible for this immensely popular CBS Soap Opera. “We meet weekly to create an overall story, then each of us crafts a day.” Find the rest of the article in Victoria or in Ebscohost Academic Search Complete.\n\nScott Bailey (Sandy Foster, the fake Jonathan Randall) and his new bride Adrienne Frantz (Amber Moore on The Bold and the Beautiful) have recently appeared on HGTV’s makeover show Design on a Dime. They redid their dining room as a 1920s speakeasy. Read more about it in the March 20, 2012 issue of Soap Opera Digest.\n\nTom Pelphrey (Jonathan Randall, one of Reva’s sudden sons) is currently on Broadway in an American production of a British hit, Somewhere Over the Rainbow. It’s a play about Judy Garland‘s final months. See an article about it in the April 23, 2012 issue of CBS Soaps in Depth.\n\nThe April 23, 2012 issue of CBS Soaps in Depth has photos from 3rd Annual Indie Soap Awards. Signy Coleman (Annie Dutton #2/Terri DeMarco), Michael O’Leary (Rick Bauer #5) Tonja Walker (Marie), Frank Dicopoulos (Frank Cooper), and Orlagh Cassidy (Doris Wolfe, DA).\n\nThe Feb. 28, 2012 issue of Soap Opera Digest did a round up of actors who were on soaps and moved on to primetime, including:\n\nBethany Joy Galeotti/Joie Lenz (Michelle Bauer Santos #4 of Manny fame) to One Tree Hill.\n\nMatt Boomer (Ben Reade #3, who paired with Marina Cooper) moved on to Chuck and White Collar.\n\nTaye Diggs (Sugar Hill, part of Marcus-Delhia-Drew storyline) moved on to Ally McBeal, Grey’s Anatomy, and Private Practice.\n\nMichelle Forbes (Sonni/Solita Lewis, one of Josh’s crazy wives) moved on to Homicide: Life on the Street, 24, Battlestar Galactica, In Treatment, True Blood, and is currently on The Killing.\n\nMelina Kanakaredes (Eleni Cooper #1, the one with spirit and sparkle) moved on to NYPD Blue, Providence, and CSI: New York.\n\nJoe Lando (Macualley West – who did a summer storyline involving Mindy on his summer hiatus from Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman) moved on to The Secret Circle.\n\nHayden Panettiere (Lizzie Spaulding #2, the little girl who returned from Arizona, killed Carl Stevens, and fought cancer) moved on to Heroes.\n\nChristina Pickles (Linell, a Springfield secretary from 1970-1972), moved on to St. Elsewhere and Friends.\n\nBrittany Snow (Susan Daisy LeMay Cooper #2, who returned from Arizona) moved on to American Dreams and Harry’s Law.\n\nSherry Stringfield (Blake Thorpe Marler #4) moved on to NYPD Blue and ER.\n\nPaul Wesley (Max Nickerson #2, Drew Jacob’s foster brother) moved on to American Dreams, Everwood, and Vampire Diaries.\n\nClick on the Posted in “GL Cast Update” category below for more posts about keeping up with the Springfielders.\n\nIn honor of The Guiding Light 60th Anniversary in 1997, Soap Opera Digest did a round up with some of the major cast then on the show asking them New Year’s Wishes and Memorable Moments. Find it on p. 30 of the January 28, 1997 issue of Soap Opera Digest.\n\nWendy Moniz (Dinah Marler #3): “My favorite moment was when Dinah confronted her parents about all the resentment, hurt, and feelings of abandonment she had. It was so powerful. Working with Maeve [Kinkead – Vanessa Chamberlain], and Jerry [ver Dorn – Ross Marler] pulled all this stuff out of me.”\n\n“I don’t think Dinah’s ready to have too happy a true love yet. I hope they continue giving her trials and tribulations, as well as comic relief.”\n\nMichael Zaslow (Roger Thorpe): “My most memorable story? The rape of Holly [Thorpe]. After I saw Rita’s [Stapleton] rape on-air, the afterglow looked very romantic. So when they came up with story of Holly’s rape, I refused. Eventually, we all agreed to do it so it was clear that this was strictly an act of violence.”\n\n“Maureen [Garrett] and I think Roger and Holly are [true loves], too. We don’t have to become lovers, we have such a rich history.”\n\nGrant Aleksander (Phillip Spaulding #2): “The scenes with Judi Evans [Luciano, ex-Beth Raines] in Central Park were certainly the halcyon days [of the Rick/Mindy/Phillip/Beth storyline]. It was everyone’s first big job, the writing was tremendous, and the characters were great.”\n\n“Phillip has a good heart, but he’s very much Alan Spaulding’s son. He’s capable of doing a lot of bad things while being a good person. He could even sleep with Reva [Shayne].”\n\nRobert Newman (Josh Lewis): “Josh and Reva’s wedding was one of the best hours in daytime. I’ve ever seen. A recent moment was when Larry Gates come back for his birthday. We all knew it would be his last day playing H.B.[Lewis], so it’s a bittersweet memory. As usual, he was his wonderful, charming self.”\n\n“Everyone agrees that if you ever really put Josh and Reva together, the story would be over. I don’t know that he’s out of love with Annie, either. I like him on the edge.”\n\nKim Zimmer (Reva Shayne): “I loved the location shoot for Josh and Reva’s wedding. We had a huge group of people, including friends, gathered, and we camped out. I also found out that I was pregnant with my third child.”\n\n“Reva wants it all. She wants to be home with her children and her ex-husband and still be incredible friends with Buzz [Cooper]. Actually, I’d like to see Reva be more independent of the men in her life.”\n\nAsk most fans and the first Bauer that comes to mind is Bert Bauer played by actress Charita Bauer for 35 years. Bert simply was the Guiding Light of the show, especially after Papa Fredrich Bauer’s passing. For Manny fans, Michelle’s unused first name was Bertha after Bert and Robbie’s name was also in honor of Bert because Michelle said Robbie had Bert’s eyes.\n\nThe Power of the Bauer by Adam Kelley\n\nKelley, Adam. “The Power of the Bauer.” Soap Opera Digest 28 January 1997 p.28\n\nTo millions of fans, Charita Bauer (Bert Bauer) was the heart and soul of Guiding Light. “She was wonderful,” says Robert Newman. “I still miss her very much. She was no-nonsense, a real straight shooter, with no ego at all. And she brought such a sense of honor and history to the show.”\n\nShe sure did. Bauer joined GL’s radio cast in 1950, and remained with the show until her death on February 28, 1985 – pretty ironic considering that she had been reluctant to sign her first contract. (She wasn’t sure she wanted to be tied to the show for two years.) For the next 35 years, the actress’s popularity never waned. Just ask Jerry ver Dorn (Ross Marler) who used to make pubic appearances with her. “Traveling with Charita was like traveling with the Pope,” he smiles. “People would come from miles around to meet her. It was extraordinary.”\n\nOn-screen, as in real life, Bauer was regarded as a shining example of courage, compassion and, as her name implies, charity; Bert selflessly devoted her life to keeping the fractious Bauer clan together. along the way, the character battled uterine cancer (a first for daytime). Decades later, when the actress suffered circulatory problems and had to have her leg amputated, she recreated the tragedy on GL, hoping her plight might benefit other people.\n\nThough she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Emmy in 1983, and posthumously awarded a second statuette for Distinguished Service to Daytime Television, the greatest tributes to Bauer still come from those who knew and loved her. “Charita was like my own grandmother,” recalls Michael O’Leary (Rick Bauer #5). “When I first started on the show, she sat with me for hours, explaining who the Bauers were, what their history was, how they fit in the show. She didn’t have to do that, but she knew I was nervous, and that was all the reason she needed. She was a very special lady.”\n\nUPDATED March 9 2019: I changed the placement of the photo and added my current signature block.\n\nRobansuefarm is the handle of one of Manny and Guiding Light‘s biggest fans following in her family’s footsteps of Guiding Light fandom since 1939.

They are aiming to raise $15,000 for Doctors Without Borders in honor of both the character and the actor (who asked fans not to send him any more presents). When I write this they were up to $11,500. This is a worthy cause and I support and applaud the effort to create something good out of this tragedy. I also salute the fans gathering the money because I’ve done that for group donations before and it’s really a lot of work. http://bit.ly/9xS7VB Since my initial write up they have passed $15,000 and are now trying for $20,000.\n\nClick on the Posted in “GL Cast Update” category below for more posts about keeping up with the Springfielders."
