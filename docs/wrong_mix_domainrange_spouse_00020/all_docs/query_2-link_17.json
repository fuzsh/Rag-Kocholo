        "text": "American actress (born 1953)\n\nKay Ann Lenz (born March 4, 1953) is an American actress. She is the recipient of a Daytime Emmy Award and a Primetime Emmy Award, as well as nominations for a Golden Globe Award and a Saturn Award.\n\nLenz is best known for her title role in the film Breezy (1973), for which she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer – Female. She is also known for her roles in the film House (1986), as well as the television series Midnight Caller (1988–1989) and Reasonable Doubts (1991–1993). For her role in the episode \"After It Happened\" of Midnight Caller, she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. She started her career with the stage name Kay Ann Kemper, switching to Kay Lenz after her third role, a brief appearance in American Graffiti (filmed in 1972).\n\nEarly years\n\n[edit]\n\nLenz was born in Los Angeles, California, to Ted Lenz, an actor and producer, and Kay Miller Lenz, who worked as a radio engineer and professional model. Her television debut was as a baby, held by a guest on a program that her father produced.[2]\n\nCareer\n\n[edit]\n\nLenz began working as a child actress, beginning with appearances in three episodes of This Is the Life when she was 14.[2] She went on to appear in such television shows as The Andy Griffith Show (in the episode \"Opie's Group\" (1967) under the stage name Kay Ann Kemper) as well as in stage productions. She made a brief appearance billed as Kay Ann Kemper in American Graffiti (1973) as Jane, a girl at a dance. She achieved recognition for her title-role performance as the free spirit who captivates William Holden in Breezy (1973), directed by Clint Eastwood.[3][4]\n\nLenz made guest appearances in The Streets of San Francisco, Gunsmoke, MacGyver, McCloud, Cannon, and Petrocelli, and played a lead role in the film White Line Fever (1975) before being cast in 1976 in the miniseries Rich Man, Poor Man, for which she was nominated for an Emmy Award.[5] She reprised her role for the sequel, Rich Man, Poor Man Book II (1977). Since the 1980s, she has played guest roles in numerous television series.[5] She appeared in Albert Brooks' short film for a Season 1 episode of Saturday Night Live.\n\nIn 1984, she appeared in Rod Stewart's music video for the song \"Infatuation\". She won a Primetime Emmy Award in 1989 for Midnight Caller.[6][7] She was also nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards for her role as flinty lawyer Maggie Zombro in the police/legal drama Reasonable Doubts.[8][5]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nLenz was the first wife of singer-actor David Cassidy. Of their April 3, 1977, marriage,[6][9] Lenz says:\n\nI wasn’t used to that state-of-stardom lifestyle... When we eloped it was on the national news. All of a sudden I was getting mail from women telling me that they had three of his children.[6]\n\nThe threats from Cassidy's fans became so frequent, Lenz retained the services of celebrity bodyguard Tommy Peacock.[citation needed] The couple divorced on December 28, 1983.[10] She has no children.[citation needed]\n\nFilmography\n\n[edit]\n\nFilm\n\n[edit]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1973 American Graffiti Jane as Kay Ann Kemper 1973 Breezy Edith Alice Breezerman Nominated — Golden Globe Award for Most Promising Newcomer - Female[2] 1973 Lisa, Bright and Dark Lisa Schilling 1975 White Line Fever Jerri Kane Hummer 1976 Moving Violation[11] Cam Johnson 1976 The Great Scout & Cathouse Thursday Thursday 1978 Mean Dog Blues Linda Ramsey 1979 The Passage Leah Bergson 1981 Swan Lake Odille Voice role 1982 Fast-Walking 'Little' Moke 1983 Prisoners of the Lost Universe Carrie Madison 1983 Trial by Terror Karen Armstrong 1986 House Sandy Sinclair Nominated — Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress 1987 Death Wish 4: The Crackdown Karen Sheldon 1987 Stripped to Kill Detective Cody Sheenan 1988 Fear Sharon Haden 1989 Headhunter Katherine Hall 1989 Physical Evidence Deborah Quinn 1990 Streets Sargent 1991 Shakespeare's Plan 12 from Outer Space Sebastian 1992 Falling From Grace P.J.
