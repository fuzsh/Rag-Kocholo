It says #ErwinMcmanus \n•\nI went to Mosaic on and off for 2 years. The level of control displayed, particularly by McManus was deeply characteristic to me of a high-demand group and was disturbing to me and to many other people who have left Mosaic for that very reason. I don’t call people in my community out publicly, EVER, but this billboard made me sick & angry that so many people are being mislead in the name of a God I love and cherish, I feel I have a responsibility to speak up for anyone willing to hear it. The hierarchy in this “church”, the level of abuse that I’ve consistently heard goes on behind the scenes and how everything centers around the Leader is textbook 101 of cults. And usually, unless you’re in the inner circle, it’s much harder to spot. Other signs are how the entire group will immediately devalue anyone who says something against them (enjoy the comments), an inability to question the Leadership who is not accountable to anyone (yeah yeah accountable to the congregation... get real) the delusion that they are onto something that no one else has. The glazed-over eyes, mannequin smiles and unquestioning allegiance to McManus that I saw week after week on most of the people in that congregation should be enough. But we often miss these signs because we so desperately want to be a part of something bigger/good. If you’re a member at Mosaic, please ask yourself what your spiritual life would look like if Erwin McManus wasn’t there anymore. Healthy Pastors are supposed to be teaching us how to have our own relationship with Jesus with or without church leaders. If u just visit on Sunday for a little pick-up and then never interact w Mosaic otherwise— you’ll never see what I’m talking about. But for those of you IN it, behind the scenes... you are not crazy. There’s nothing wrong with you that isn’t wrong with everyone else. And you can’t earn Gods love by trying harder and doing better. If you feel like you’re being controlled- you are. \n\nIf you’ve experienced this at Mosaic, this is an open forum to share your experience as it may help others:\".",
