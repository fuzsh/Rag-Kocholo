        "text": "TELEVISION\n\n!!!!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!\n\nJane The Virgin [Premiered it’s 5th and Last Season]\n\nCRAZY SHOUT OUT TO THIS QUEEN for this INSANE 7 minute monologue done in one continuous shot! Gina Rodriguez is EPIC! Please give her all the awards. I remember watching this and just being in complete awe of her. Her acting was complete and total brilliance. Read about the process of shooting this scene HERE\n\nI’m a total TV nerd, who loves to plan and who loves a good theme. I do this often. Here’s my Jane the Virgin finale setup. Yes, I do this just for me. And I freaking LOVE IT!\n\nAllow me to explain.\n\nMy set up includes:\n\nA flower (Jane’s grandma’s virginity metaphor) Haha.\n\nWhite petals to symbolize her moments with Rafael.\n\nSnowballs to symbolize the title of Jane’s first novel- Snow Falling and her life with Michael.\n\nA cross necklace to symbolize the strong faith this show has and it’s also a necklace I think Jane has worn in earlier seasons.\n\nA soap opera digest as a ode to the show’s telenovela nature.\n\nA lavender drink and tablecloth because it’s Rogelio’s favorite color.\n\nAnd lastly the meal that just screams Villanueva- a grilled cheese sandwich.\n\nOh and I made a ratchet t-shirt of course with my favorite quote. Because duh?\n\nThe finale episode made me laugh, made me cry, made me gasp. But mostly it made me realize how much I’m going to miss this show. Excellent, television. A true game changer. Thank you. Can’t wait for the spinoff!\n\nAlways knew these two were endgame.\n\nMy girl, Sophia Bush even guest starred this season! 😀\n\nGrand Hotel\n\nThis show premiered this Summer and honestly it had me hooked. It’s mysterious, and romantic and full of drama. I hope it gets a season 2, because I just watched the finale and it was bringing the plot twists left and right! Also I think there are many familiar faces involved.\n\nP.S. did I mention the ROMANCE!\n\nThe Bachelorette (Hannah B’s Season) / Bachelor in Paradise\n\nWhy am I so invested in these cheap, reality shows! I am so convinced it is heavily scripted, but I can’t take my eyes away. It’s like a cringeworthy car crash. I have not watched The Bachelor franchise in years. I think I may have watched the first season of The Bachelorette and that is all. But I kept seeing all this drama surrounding Hannah B.’s season and I just got curious and binge-watched it on demand, getting all caught up before home town visits. PETER WAS MY FAVORITE! And as for Hannah, I did like her, but sometimes I found myself screaming at her on my tv too. She definitely had her badass, female empowerment moments too though. So you do you Hannah Boo. Girl is going to be on this Season’s Dancing with the Stars. Like…what? Crazy! She’s everywhere!\n\nPILOT PETE!!!!!! #Windmill #JesusStillLovesMe\n\nI had a little party for the finale. I was so nervous while watching. I wanted her to pick Peter SOOOO bad, but if you watched you know she didn’t. So fingers crossed that he is the next bachelor! #SIGNMEUP #IDGIVEHIMALLTHEROSES\n\nAnd then after that ended Bachelor in Paradise started up…and I didn’t even know this was a thing. Various past contestants get to come back and get another shot at finding love as they stay on a beach in Mexico. So I was like what the hell? Why not. Some of the guys from Hannah’s season were on so I was like woohoo, #SummerTV. Connor, Dylan, Mike, Luke S. were on and some others too. And it is so dramatic and I feel so frustrated watching it, but I can’t help it. It’s entertaining as hell. LOL. My fav couples are Katie & Chris and Clay and Nicole. I just hope they end up together. I also really loved Derek who was from a different season but he is no longer on. The finale is next week and then we get a reunion show, SO HEYYYY!!!! And the next Bachelor is announced. What do we think guys, do those ankles from that new promo look like Peter’s? I sure hope so!\n\nBH 90210\n\nWhen I heard about this reboot, I WAS ESTATIC. When I heard about the concept, not so much. I was nervous, and skeptical. I wanted to love it, but I was scared I wouldn’t. But…it is actually SO DAMN GOOD. This take on the reboot trend is fresh and inventive. I’m so sad it’s only 6 episodes. The season finale is tonight! I hope they bring it back for season 2! It’s so funny, nostalgic and oddly mysterious. It makes my heart happy to see the crew back together. Although I must say…Luke Perry will always be missed.\n\nI may have been a bit young to watch 90210 from the start. But I remember being obsessed with the reruns so much I ran out and bought the first season on DVD. From 90210 where this dream boat waltzed in as Dylan McKay and made girls everywhere swoon. I was unable to decide if I liked him more with Brenda or with Kelly because he made both relationships look so good. To the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie where he was once again the adorable love interest. To when he guest starred on old pal “Kelly’s” “What I Like About You” show. To his most recent role as Fred Andrew’s on CWs hit Riverdale. I’ve followed his career and have always loved him. My heart is broken to know he is gone. 💔 I still can’t believe it. Rest in Peace Luke Perry. You’ll always be a legend. #DylanMckay\n\nI had a little fun premiere party with my sister in law, so I thought why not honor the peach pit, by bringing in some peach vibes…I also rocked this 90210 shirt I made from an old shirt that didn’t fit anymore. I cut out the logo and sewed it to a white tee, that I cropped and made tie.\n\nPearson [Premiered it’s 1st season on USA]\n\nYou know why I’m watching this….my girl Bethany Joy Lenz plays Keri Allen!\n\nI was never a “SUITS” viewer, but I know this is a spin-off based on Jessica Pearson from the show. It is a bit hard to get fully invested in at times, because I honestly just want to see Joy on my screen at all times. LOL. But she does play a vital role. She plays city attorney and left hand woman to Chicago’s mayor Bobby Novak…whom she is having an on going affair with. It’s steamy and sexy and SAD…because there are so many complications and so many times you just want to scream at Keri for being THAT GIRL. But tv is NEVER just right or wrong, Pearson explores the Gray. The Gray in Law, in Politics, and in Love. I AM HERE FOR IT! The finale is next week. So I’m excited, I hope it gets a season 2! Because I really like seeing both Jessica Pearson and Keri Allen be kickass, powerful women BOSSES.\n\nKeri & Bobby THO!!!! #SWOON\n\nHad a little Pearson Premiere Party because I’m a tv geek and I love Joy. So my best friend and I got together to watch.\n\nYounger [Premiered it’s 6th Season]\n\nI fell in love with this show, when it first premiered. And I mean Hilary Duff…duh?\n\nThe finale just aired and this season was full of crazy twists and turns and lots of laughs. But of course in the land of Charles & Liza vs. Liza & Josh. I am all about #TEAMJOSH. Season 7 COMING SOON!\n\nStranger Things [Premiered it’s 3rd Season on Netflix]\n\nIt’s been a minute since Season 2! I’m a little sad that this season is only 8 episodes. I am currently up to 6. And I have to say it’s not my favorite season. But there has definitely been some really good stuff so far. So I’m excited to see all that goes down in the upside down and the real world parallels.\n\nI went to Coney Island this Summer and it was all decked out in promotion for the show. AND Baskin Robbins released special ice cream flavors for the show too! Eleven’s Heaven (White), Upside Down Pralines (Chocolate). They were amazing! Especially the Eleven’s Heaven, it had waffle cone pieces in it. #HEAVEN\n\nIn The Dark [This wasn’t exactly a summer show, but I have yet to talk about it on this blog, so I just wanted to give it a shout out, because it is so good.] A really unique storyline that follows a blind girl who becomes obsessed with the death of a close friend, and takes it upon herself to get him some justice. She is a real fire cracker who hands out insults often, loves smoking and generally hates life. But somehow, you just end up falling in love with her clever angsty wit. I was happy to hear it was picked up for a second season!\n\nPlus…there’s this guy…what a dreamboat. Casey Deidrick who played Chad on Days of Our Lives and Tommy in an MTV show “Eye Candy” that got cancelled, when it shouldn’t have.\n\nScream (Season 3, not sure when this premiered on tv…I just saw it pop up on Netflix and got super excited.)\n\nSeasons 1 &2 were pretty good, I used to love the original slasher films as a kid. I thought they were mysterious and scary. That and I Know What You Did Last Summer were slasher jams growing up in the 90’s/00’s. So I was hyped to see they FINALLY released a Season 3 after all the confusion and cast changes. The plot twist was nice! I was happy that they played with the audience, I was all over the place as to who the killer was. It was only 6 episodes, so I finished it in like 2 days. But with Halloween coming up, it’s perfect to get into the spooky spirit.\n\nHere’s the trailer if your interested.\n\nSo there you have it, my Summer TV recap. Check ’em out!\n\nAnd tell me what you watched this Summer!\n\n*The only photos that I take credit for are the “Premiere Party” photos.*\n\n-<3-\n\nI know I haven’t posted much this summer… I guess I’ve just been busy…\n\nLIVIN MY BEST LIFE! 😉\n\nAs this Summer officially comes to an end for me, (I start work back up tomorrow!) it has dawned on me that this Summer has been pretty great. Which is not always the case for me. No, I wasn’t able to go on some luxurious vacation, but I was able to have some really fun times with great family, friends, food, and lots of wine! 😉 I got to do more than I usually get to, because this summer I decided to take off of work. Granted, my job is different then most, I can either apply to work the summer or not, it’s my choice. Normally I work every Summer, but something made me decline this Summer. And I’m glad I did. My credit card isn’t happy, but I think it was the right move for me personally.\n\nNo my Summer wasn’t perfect, it actually started off really difficult for me and my family. And I have had many emotional moments and hard times, but when I look at all the good. Somehow, that wins. Good always wins. And so, I thought before I jump back into my usual work routine, I should just take a second and reflect of the Summer memories I was blessed with.\n\nJUNE, JULY, & AUGUST 2019\n\nMy Summer started with my usual tradition of taking my mom to see a broadway show. I get her tickets for her Mother’s Day gift and then we usually see the show in June. This year we saw Waitress, and it was ABSOLUTELY amazing. [Fun Fact: I actually just watched the movie and it was good, but I LOVED the play even more!)]\n\n4th of July we celebrated with some family and it was really sweltering hot, but it was a really great time. As an anxious person, heat really tends to effect me. But I’ve really learned to manage my anxiety in the Summer better. The 4th was really fun! Especially since my cousin and his family were in from Florida. It was really nice to be able to spend a holiday with them, it’s been a minute! I also found this super simple COOKIE RECIPE, and they were a hit! I think I made them, like 3 times for 3 separate occasions this summer, I just switch up the sprinkles depending on the occasion. A kid favorite for sure! *You could totally make these for Fall, Halloween, Christmas, Easter, etc. I would even like to try it with chocolate cake mix. BTW if you look closely, you may spy that I wore a Britney Spears t-shirt…it was the only red, white, & blue I had. And like I was cool with it! 😉 #ITSBRITNEYBITCH Guess you can tell, I’m kind of a graphic tee fan…more to come on that later on!\n\nA Stranger Things themed Coney Island! So if you are a fan of the sci fi/mystery Netflix show, you would know that this Summer Season 3 was released. [I’M ONLY UP TO EPISODE 6…SHHHHH!!!!] Coney Island was transformed into a Stranger Things theme park in the show’s 80’s fashion. It consisted of just posters hung around of the logo and the characters, the theme song was placing on the speakers, and the staff had on custom tees. Nothing crazy, I was kind of disappointed. BUT I went with my mom, aunt and my aunt surprised us by bringing my goddaughter, so we got to go on some rides, play games, and eat some food court summer food.\n\nLocal Baseball Game for my Cousin’s husband’s 40th birthday! I’m not a super fan of baseball, but we had a box room, and there was catered food, and the weather was great. The kids even got to run the bases after the game.\n\nI got to catch up with my coworkers…and eat this load of calories! 😛\n\nAtlantic City Overnighter with my fav ladies, my mom and my aunt! We stopped in the small town Smithville on the way. Gambling isn’t my fav, because I HATE losing money. But there were a few fun games I liked, like CRAZY MONEY! BUT I got some sweet Gilmore Girls/Stars Hollow vibes from the small, quaint town, and picked up some goodies.\n\n[INSERT MINI SMITHVILLE HAUL-SLIDESHOW BELOW]\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nTOY STORY 4! THE LION KING! ALADDIN! #RELIVEDMYCHILDHOOD Thank you!\n\nSo I never had a super strong connection to The Lion King or Aladdin as a kid. I was never a super big Disney kid, I had my favorites but they weren’t it. But I really had to see the new live action films. Because, duh? However, Toy Story was a thing! My brother and I were a fan of the films growing up.\n\nI really enjoyed all three films.\n\n[INSERT MINI MOVIE REVIEWS!]\n\nThe Lion King was a little bittersweet because I felt like Nala being played by Beyoncé kept taking me out of the story, because I was just thinking ok you’re Beyoncé. And I just felt annoyed by it. And I just felt like the real animals (although Timon and Pumbaa were HYSTERICAL) were just weird to watch in this sing along world. I felt like the color in the animation helped with suspending reality and enjoying the world. But I did enjoy it for the most part, the original is better, in my opinion. The music was better in the original too.\n\nAladdin was amazing! I loved the romance between Aladdin and Jasmine. You know me, if there’s a love story, I AM IN IT! I thought Jasmine’s vocals were INSANE. And Will Smith as the genie….I mean he cracked me up the whole damn time. The music was beautiful…And I watched a crappy boot leg copy because by the time, I got around to watching it, it wasn’t playing in theaters near me. But I really loved it, and if I watched it in a clear, crisp copy, I’d probably love it even more.\n\nToy Story 4 was EPIC! It was everything-emotional, funny, nostalgic, scary….like those dummy dolls were legit! It was amazing and I actually didn’t think the ending was as sad as everyone made it. I think it actually left room for other films.\n\nPool/Beach Vibes\n\nSo I actually got to go to the beach TWICE this Summer, which is kind of a big deal for me. There have been some Summers I wouldn’t get to go at all! I went once with my mom to a local beach, then I went to Ocean City with some family, and stayed with them in a rented house for a few days. I also got to have some fun pool days, one with my best friend at her house and one with some family, my cousin has a pool membership. I kid you not it was very Stranger Things-80’s pool vibes. Super fun!\n\n[INSERT MINI OCEAN CITY HAUL]\n\nWe were only there for 5 days, but we did so much! The beach, the amusement park, the water park, the arcade, BBQ nights in, shopping strips, dinner night outs, we played cards and other games, mini golf AND survived the crazy heat wave too! 😉\n\nI bought my family tickets to see Ain’t Too Proud! It was my dad’s father’s day gift this year! And the talent was incredible! I honestly was so amazed by their vocals. I grew up with the music of The Temptations playing in my house. I’m definitely a MOTOWN influenced kid. I love their music, songs like My Girl and Just My Imagination were some of my favs! The show was so amazing, I felt like I was seeing them live in concert.\n\nDescendants 3 Premiere with my God Daughter!\n\nMy cousin threw a party for her daughter & her friends, and so I made some fun treats for the girlies. Besides, I was kind of excited for the 3rd film too! I was a bit obsessed with Evie’s blue and red vibes from the second film. The second is my favorite, but I enjoyed the new film too!\n\nI love planning themed parties, and believe me I have a few TV related mini parties I had throughout this summer, but I’m going to do a whole separate post on my Summer TV and Music Favs! So STAY TUNED!\n\nFun with Fashion!!!\n\nI got to play around a little more with fashion this summer. More than I usually do, because I didn’t have to dress a certain way for work. Also, I became a huge fan of hats and tassel earrings. Also the two white t-shirts with the logos on them are both shirts made by my brother. The “she writes her own story” tee was a custom made for me, but the “You’re Making Me Blush” tee is available on his etsy shop! He has some great designs up, please take a look and follow him on instagram @mytshirtaddiction\n\nI told you I love graphic tees, I guess it runs in the family! 😉\n\nI just got a fresh new cut and color because my hair was kind of looking rough from dying it purple in April. I basically had Mermaid hair all Summer. Which was like cool, but I was growing sick of it and I needed a darker vibe for Fall! I’ve had Pink, Blue, and Purple hair over the years and I still have yet to show any of that on this blog! One of these days, I’m going to do a whole Hair Chronicles! LOL.\n\nHad My God Daughter over for a sleepover- and we did everything under the sun from making tie dye tees to baking a cake for my brother’s birthday to making our own chipwiches- I also created a scavenger hunt for her! We also had my brother and his family stay over unexpectedly one night, and it was my niece’s first sleepover at our house. So I had to scramble and make it festive for her and get her some goodies. We decorate every time we have my god daughter for sleepovers so we had to do the same for my niece too! I also babysat my niece by myself for the first time! (It’s not like I can’t… I just never have until this summer, I can be a nervous Nancy when it comes to watching kids all by myself. LOL) Great times with my two favorite little girlies!!!!\n\nMusic & TV Vibes!\n\nSo I do want to share with you all the shows and music I fell in love with this Summer in a separate post, but I just wanted to highlight a few things! I saw Shawn Mendes in concert with my friend and needless to say it was kind of an anxious experience. I will get more into it in a separate post. But let’s just say I will never sit in Barclay’s upper seating again. It’s quite terrifying! Shawn however, was AMAZING! And it ended up being a fun night. Taylor Swift dropped her new album #Lover as you may have guessed from my last few posts, I’m KIND OF a fan! It’s EPIC and I love it! So there has been lots of fun Taylor Swift memories this Summer. As for tv, there were so many shows I saw premiere, shows end and all the feels in between. But the two that I hold so dear to my heart has to be the new 90210 reboot- BH 90210. SO GOOD! And the announcement of the Lizzie McGuire reboot! I AM DYING!!!! SO SO PUMPED for that! I’m already planning my premiere party in my head guys! Nostalgia is a dish best served nice and toasty. Childhood memories….feels like home.\n\nFamily Day at the Aquarium! We got caught in torrential down pour, but it was still a good time!\n\nSpeaking of rain, I think I got caught in crazy down pours and thundering and lightning like 4-5 times this summer. I’ve been soaked from head to toe on multiple occasions. One time my umbrella wouldn’t even open! Some days I could laugh it off and some I just wanted to stop and cry! But looking back at this summer I can just say Thank You! Thank You 2019 for getting me through some really hard emotional blocks, and testing me and proving to me that I can handle so much more than I give myself credit for. Anxiety does not define me. And just because I feel the weight of the world one day or even a week doesn’t mean that it’s forever. That my funky moods, don’t have to be my all day moods! I’m so hoping to bring that knowledge with me into this new Fall Season…MY FAVORITE SEASON! Such a basic bi*ch, I know! #FIGHTME. 😉 BRING ON THE PUMPKIN EVERYTHANG, the flannel, the leather, the cool air, the crisp leaves and the HOLIDAYS! I feel so blessed to have had the Summer I did. And blessed to start this new fall year, that is already filling up with some exciting things!\n\nTime to focus on the positive.\n\nHow was your Summer?\n\n*All images are my own, except the movie posters, the Taylor Swift image I stole from my bestie, and the Lizzie McGuire pic I reposted from Hilary’s instagram.* 😉\n\n-<3-\n\nIt seems like every where you turn, there is another 90’s tv show reboot. To be honest, I’m here for it ALL! I was born in the 90’s and I remember watching these shows and loving them, so these shows are basically my childhood. Nostalgia is so good, sometimes.\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous post, Charmed is coming back to The CW (formerly known as The WB) with three new young witches with many new adventures to face and evil to conquer. Looks kind of good, I’m going to see if it holds up to the original. Because I used to love the original. My best friend and I used to “Play Charmed.” Where we would each pick one of the witches to be and create spells and cast them. We often fought over who would be Prue or Phoebe, but let’s be real eventually we loved Piper because she’d get candle lit dinners with White Lighter Leo. 😉 #BESTFRIENDINSIDEJOKES\n\nThe original premiered in 1998 and starred Shannen Doherty as Prue, Alyssa Milano as Phoebe, Holly Marie Combs as Piper, and Rose McGowen as Paige. Doherty’s character dies in Season 3, which is why they had McGowen show up to take the place of the third witch in the Halliwell family trio. The Series aired for 8 seasons on The WB.\n\nCheck out the Reboot Trailer below:\n\nThe synopsis reads:\n\nMel and Maggie Vera suffer a shock when their mother dies suddenly, but before they have time to heal from their loss, another surprise shows up on their doorstep in the shape of an older sister — brilliant geneticist Macy — whom their mother never told them existed. The emotional stress takes its toll and the girls begin to exhibit impossible new abilities. An explanation comes from an unexpected place: the new chair of the women’s studies department. Harry Greenwood reveals that the three are powerful witches, and he is their white lighter, there to advise and guide them as they battle dark forces.–[Via Wikipedia]\n\nThe idea of this reboot seems relatively similar to the original so I’m interested to see how this plays out. I want the key components of the original, but not an instant copy, and they’ve already changed things up by casting three Latina actresses. Cheers from a fellow Latina! I think this could be really cool. However, the reboot did get backlash from the original actresses, when the reboot proclaimed itself as “Fierce, Funny and Feminist.” OG fans seem to be in agreeance and are skeptical to watch. Alyssa Milano also spoke to Entertainment Tonight saying, “I wish that they would have come to us and we would have been involved since the beginning…But having said that, I do hope that it reaches the newer generation and impacts that generation the way ours was able to do for its generation.” As an OG fan, I feel that the original witches were 4 badass FEMINIST women, but that doesn’t mean we can’t leave room for these new actresses to claim their own feminist badassery. At least they aren’t stepping into the same exact character roles, trying to be something they aren’t. So hey, let’s just give it a chance, shall we? No matter what- Milano, Doherty, Combs and McGowan will always be our original Charmed ones.\n\nThe Reboot airs Sunday, October 14th @ 9 PM on The CW\n\nNEXT UP...\n\nThe latest 90’s sitcom to be revived is- Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Well sort of…let’s dive in.\n\nThe original live action TV series premiered in 1996, and starred Melissa Joan Hart as Sabrina Spellman. The show follows Sabrina Spellman – a teenager with magical powers who comes from a long line of witches. Until going away to college, she lived with her wacky aunts, who would teach her to use her witchcraft wisely, and Salem, the talking black cat, who always has a scheme up his paw. As a high-school student, Sabrina is less judicious about using her powers than when she enters adulthood. The series is said to be based on a 1960s Sabrina, a spinoff of the Archie comic franchise, and an animated TV series that originally aired in the 1970s. –[Via Wikipedia.]\n\nThe original live action tv sitcom (1996) was funny, and light hearted, even the scariest of adventures had some humor attached, very kid friendly. I remember some of my favorite episodes were the ones where Britney Spears, and *NSYNC guest starred/made musical appearances. Another would be when Brian Austin Green played Sabrina’s Boyfriend for the night-yes they created a dough boy and basically baked her a boyfriend! Seriously I wish I was able to point my finger and be dressed and ready, or to zap myself to work, without the travel. Witches man! LOL.\n\nThe sitcom aired for 7 seasons on ABC and The WB and included two television movies and one soundtrack release. The series is also said to be outside the Archie comics.\n\nThanks to my free Hulu trial I get to 90’s it up! Hey remember that time DJ Tanner (Full House/Fuller House) played a psycho cult witch and then Sabrina visited Philly in Boy Meets World…SO good! I’ll be watching that episode on Hulu asap. Been on a bit of a Boy Meets World/Sabrina the Teenage Witch throwback kick.\n\nThis Sabrina Witch storyline has been revived/readapted several times, across several mediums. Comic book, Animation, Live Action TV sitcom, cartoon/animated series, films, and now it’s being given a darker, Netflix twist.\n\nSabrina: The Animated Series\n\nIn 1999, Hart provided the voice of Sabrina’s two aunts for Sabrina: The Animated Series, while Emily Hart (Melissa’s younger sister) voiced the character of Sabrina. This series lasted one season and produced 65 episodes, the television/direct-to-video movie Sabrina: Friends Forever, and the continuation-spinoff series Sabrina’s Secret Life. –[Via Wikipedia]\n\nBoth of Sabrina animated shows and a movie are all produced by DiC Productions, now called DHX Media. The series is outside the Archie comics. –[Via Wikipedia]\n\nSabrina: Secrets of a Teenage Witch\n\nIn 2011, Archie Comics announced plans to produce a new animated series based on Sabrina the Teenage Witch to be released in late 2012. The show featured CGI animation that was produced by MoonScoop, and a brand new look for the Sabrina characters. As of October 2012, The Hub has picked up the series, and it finally debuted on air on October 12, 2013. –[Via Wikipedia]\n\nFilms (with Melissa Joan Hart)\n\nSabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 film)\n\nNot to mention the many Sabrina books!\n\nNEW SABRINA NEWS!!!\n\nRiverdale (2017 TV series-The CW)\n\nOn July 23, 2016, at San Diego Comic-Con, K.J. Apa, who portrays Archie Andrews in the darker, subversive live action take on Archie, confirmed that Sabrina will eventually appear in the CW series. Sabrina was originally slated to debut in the show’s season one finale, but this was eventually decided against, as showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa said it would’ve distracted from the rest of the episode, though she is still being considered for a later season.–[Via Wikipedia]\n\nThis could be really cool.\n\nI wonder who will play her?\n\n*Read the FULL Sabrina history HERE\n\nCheck out the trailer for the latest Sabrina journey-\n\nThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, where Kiernan Shipka (will be taking on the role of Sabrina Spellman.)\n\nThe synopsis reads:\n\nHer name is Sabrina Spellman.\n\nHalf witch. Half mortal. On her 16th birthday, Sabrina (Kiernan Shipka) has to make a choice between the witch world of her family and the human world of her friends. With her aunties (Miranda Otto, Lucy Davis), her cat Salem, and her boyfriend Harvey Kinkle (Ross Lynch), Sabrina will face horrors and new adventures in the mysterious town of Greendale. From the executive producers of Riverdale comes a haunting new tale. –[Via Released by Netflix]\n\nFrom the trailer I can definitely see the Riverdale esque influence. To be honest I didn’t even know the character Sabrina was based on an Archie comic. I was never a comics kid, but I loved TV, (clearly still do!) Being a kid in the 90’s, Melissa Joan Hart was my Sabrina. Although all Hart’s Sabrina related content (Live Action TV series, Animated Series, Films) was considered “outside the Archie comics,” it does still say she was based off the original Archie comic character. So I’m guessing it’s a loose adaption. Hart was the Sabrina I know and love, as she is for many. So now I can understand the difference in direction for this Netflix reboot, it isn’t based on the 90’s sitcom. However, wasn’t Archie more humorous and silly? Where is this darkness coming from? But then again I wasn’t an Archie comic reader.\n\nWAIT!!!!\n\nChilling Adventures of Sabrina is an American comic book series published by Archie Horror, an imprint of Archie Comics, beginning in 2014. The series focuses on Sabrina Spellman during her teenage years in the 1960s. The series is a darker take on the characters and setting of Sabrina the Teenage Witch.— [Via Wikipedia]\n\nNOW I GET IT….DUH???\n\nI know I’m intrigued just to see the same few characters pop back up. Looks really cool!\n\nThe Reboot Premieres Friday, October 26th. Only on Netflix.\n\n*DISCLAIMER: I used Wikipedia/IMDB to fact check, so please don’t quote me on any of this. Sometimes their information can be off. My apologies for any mistaken information.\n\nSo who’s watching these Witchy Reboots? Any takers? Let me know how you think they’ll measure up to the original content in the comments below.\n\n*I do not take credit for any images, video clips, films, trailers, or Wikipedia information*\n\n-<3-\n\nFall is the time where all the returning shows start their season premieres, or when the new shows have their series premieres. And it is seriously like Christmas morning to me. This year there are a few newbies and some good oldies that I’ve invested a few seasons in already. It’s the most wonderful time of the year! Warning…I watch ALOT of tv, it’s my favorite form of storytelling. I love getting to know characters and having them be there every week with new adventures. Hey it’s research! One day I’m going to have my own TV show, that’s the dream!\n\nI try to watch live as much as I can, because I hate spoilers and I like the sense of community. #Livetweeting for the win! But sometimes I just can’t, because life and well sometimes I have to actually #Adult. But I usually catch up when I can, thanks to free on demand, and the internet. Here’s a peek at what I’m watching this fall season…\n\nMONDAYS\n\nThe Resident @ 8 PM FOX *New for me [On it’s 2nd Season]\n\nOh man oh man, so this show just started it’s second season and I had seen a bunch of promos for it. Of course it peeked my interest because Matt Czuchry (Logan from Gilmore Girls) and Emily VanCamp (Amy from Everwood & Emily/Amanda from Revenge) are in it! But I figured it was a hospital drama and it would break my heart just like Grey’s Anatomy did. So I kind of strayed away. And then one day YouTube happened, and I started to watch a few clips and I quickly realized that I was going to be in LOVE with Czuchry’s character, Conrad Hawkins. He’s basically a younger/sexy version of Dr. House. He uses unconventional methods to save his patients lives, and he’s lovably arrogant. He’s a third year resident supervising new first years, and he has one rule “He is always right.” Very rough around the edges because he had a rough go at childhood and served in the marine corps as a medic. I love how he doesn’t even wear full scrubs he just wears the shirt and black jeans and combat boots, with his beaded and leather bracelets and chains and bolt like rings, and tattoos. He’s just so damn cool, I can’t take it.\n\nHowever he really cares about his patients and will break any hospital rule (especially when it involves billing and insurance) to help save them. Just the way he walks is amazing. It’s like a strut.\n\nI LOVE him, and even more so, I love his relationship with VanCamp’s character Nurse Nicolette “Nic” Nevin. You know if there’s a love story, complexities and all…I am ALL IN!\n\nThanks to hulu I just finished Season 1 and caught up on the first two episodes of Season 2. I will admit it’s my current obsession. This happens when I find a new tv show, I just can’t stop thinking about it. LOL. Season 1 was really strong and I am so happy I gave in and watched it.\n\nThe show takes place in Chastain Park Memorial Hospital in Atlanta Georgia, and it drops us in the middle of these character’s lives, so there is a lot of backstory still left to uncover. Especially when it comes to Conrad and Nic’s relationship. It’s really interesting because I’m used to seeing these relationship stables play out- when did they meet? Who asked who out? What’d they do on their first date? When did they first say I love you? When did they have their first love scene? SO MANY QUESTIONS!!!! But I kind of like how they are showing their relationship unfold. It’s very cool.\n\nIn college I had a college writing professor who used to always tell us to “tell it later,” I would always get so frustrated, because I felt like I wanted to tell it now, from the beginning. But as I grow older and watch tv shows and see how they differ in their storytelling, I totally see the appeal of dropping your audience smack dab in the middle of a couple’s complex relationship. For instance in the pilot, the first scene we see between Nic and Conrad is him pulling her into a room and kissing her, telling her he’ll do “whatever it takes to get her back.”\n\nSWOON! It leaves us wanting more. Nicely played FOX. I’m hooked.\n\nI don’t mean to go off on a tangent on this one show, but it’s a new one for me, so I have to get the obsession feels out! I also really like the way the show is shot. Very hand held, snory cam- at times first person shots. The music they use is pretty dope too. For instance in Season 2, they used these two songs and I am obsessed!\n\nI think I may need to do a full on review of this show so I will just stop rambling here and move on…\n\nTUESDAYS\n\nNew Amsterdam @ 10 PM NBC *NEW Series [1st Season]\n\nAll these doctor shows coming in and taking over…another doctor who is not a fan of billing or the medical system and is trying the fight for patients, you may think it’s the same as every other doctor show but…there is a mega twist at the end of the pilot…watch and wait for it…\n\nThis Is Us @ 9 PM NBC [3rd Season]\n\nYou guys…come on now, do I even have to explain how good this show is. I would just like to meet these writers and directors and creators and just give them a standing ovation because, the way they let these stories unfold is just brilliant. I cry almost every week, but it’s still just such moving television.\n\nWEDNESDAYS\n\nRiverdale @ 8 PM The CW [3rd Season]\n\nChicago PD @ 10 PM NBC [6th Season]\n\nTHURSDAYS\n\nWill & Grace @ 9 PM NBC [2nd Season Reboot]\n\nHow To Get Away With Murder @ 10 PM ABC [5th Season]\n\nFRIDAYS\n\nDynasty @ 8 PM The CW [2nd Season]\n\nSATURDAYS\n\nFREE DAY! (Catch up day?) haha\n\nSUNDAYS\n\nSupergirl @ 8 PM The CW [4th Season]\n\nCharmed @ 9 PM The CW [*New Series Reboot]\n\nWe shall see how this holds up to the original…I loved the original!\n\nYOU @ 10 PM Lifetime [*New Series]\n\nThis show is so good, and is so creepy you just can’t help but be intrigued by what’s going to happen next. It takes stalker to a whole new level.\n\nHappy Watching…what are you guys watching this fall?\n\n* I do not take credit for any images used in my edit (or otherwise)\n\nor any videos/music used.*\n\n-<3-\n\nIt’s been a minute, I know! I was doing good with my post schedule for the most part and then I slacked off the past two post days. Well I didn’t exactly slack off, I was busy babysitting! But today I am back!\n\nI’m no stranger to award show season. I used to live for it! I loved watching the Kids Choice Awards and the Teen Choice awards just to see my favorite stars from my favorite shows win or at least see them walk the “red” carpet. What color was it, orange? green? blue? And the slime, there was always slime. Haha.\n\nAs you may know, I was and still am a HUGE One Tree Hill fan girl. I lived that experience of watching that show for 9 years! Even when it drove me crazy, I was always in it for the long haul. Watching and waiting with my best friend.\n\nIt was always the little show that could. I can’t even count how many times we would think the show would get cancelled. Season after season we held our breath, and they kept coming back with new stories to tell us.\n\nDuring the time One Tree Hill was on the air, I don’t ever actually recall the show winning any awards. I was always so disappointed. However, I remember Chad Michael Murray and Sophia Bush winning awards. Whether it was for their role on OTH or their work on other movies, in true OTH fan girl fashion, we were happy just for them to be recognized. A win was a win. Although um, Bethany Joy deserves all the awards…just saying. Give this girl a GRAMMY! #SheNeedsToReleaseAnALBUMFirst #GETITGURL\n\n*Watch my Vlog of her Concert last summer- HERE\n\nBut recently, this year the Teen Choice Awards added a new category- Choice Throwback TV Show. And One Tree Hill was pinned against many other favorites like-\n\nNetflix Generation you lucky lucky littles, you get to stream it all at once, while we had to wait! But I have to thank you for giving OTH a whole new group of fangirls and for keeping the show alive 13 years since it first premiered and 5 Years since it’s series finale! ONE TREE HILL WON A FREAKING TEEN CHOICE AWARD IN 2017! Yes Yes and More Yes! I definitely foresee an OTH movie, or spinoff, or reunion in the future. The cast still hangs out, still keeps in touch, still supports the show by doing those eyecon events-Return to Tree Hill- Conventions. Speaking of, it is a goal of mine to get to one of those at some point in my life! 😉 Hey I’ve met Danneel Harris, Lee Norris, Tyler Hilton, Sophia Bush, Daphne Zuniga, and Bethany Joy Lenz, so I don’t think I’m doing too bad. Sophia and Joy were like massive bucket list points for me!\n\nI just think it’s super cool that One Tree Hill is still teaching young girls (and boys) lessons and giving them a place to call home. Television is home for me. I see stories and characters that I can relate to or that I aspire to be like or are already like me, or gather inspiration from and it is just such a comfort. One Tree Hill took me from my middle school years through high school and even to college, and I have some of the best most special memories because of that show. So much of my adolescence is linked to that show, and it’s always going to be. So for me, One Tree Hill is the reason why I want to write for television one day. So in a nutshell, I’m really happy to see it still being recognized and loved by so many generations.\n\nNow, I’m 26, so no I didn’t watch the Teen Choice Awards so I don’t know how the category was presented, I don’t know if anyone was there to accept it, or if it was just kind of announced in passing. But either way, it’s still super cool that OTH won. To be honest, I probably would have checked in on the show if I remembered it was actually on, but I didn’t. And yes I saw OTH was nominated and I thought it was so awesome, but no I did not vote, because when I was a teen I did and I’ve done my time. It’s their (the Netflix generation) time now, and I had faith in them, Haha. Although let’s be real that category was full of epic shows too!\n\nFor the total list of winners click HERE!\n\nSide Note: I was happy to see Supergirl’s Melissa Benoist won and Riverdale swept the stage with a ton of awards! We all know they were both my most current Netflix binge parties. Can’t wait for the fall so I can watch them both live! 😀\n\n*I do not take credit for images used.*\n\n-<3-\n\nYou sit down on the couch, remote in hand.\n\nAnd you turn on your favorite show.\n\nYou’re pumped and can’t wait to see if Ross and Rachel finally get back together.\n\nBut what makes all of that more sweeter?\n\nThe musical introduction of course!\n\nThe song you know by heart, and involuntarily bop along and sing to as it plays before you dive into the fictional world of your favorite characters.\n\nI love television so much.\n\nI love how you can be catapulted into a world of characters and experience their love and friendships throughout their journey. How you instantly feel like they become your family on that day, at that time. It’s like every week you can depend of them to make your day just a bit better.\n\nAnd what I’ve learned about my love for television, is that the little bit of an intro matters to me. The song they choose- matters to me.\n\nBecause it has to reflect the show’s tone. And the images they place with it too. Of course theme songs are changed, modified, shortened, remixed, throughout the years. But still they set the tone for what’s in store for you and I for one don’t think television would be the same without them.\n\nSo let’s talk about some of my favorites- (in no particular order)\n\nBuffy the Vampire Slayer\n\nThis song was my brother’s and my jam. When we were little every time we would watch the show, the song would come on and we’d just rock out. #IWhipMyHairBackAndForth Girls who wore one or more braids in their hair….you know what I’m talking about.\n\nFRIENDS\n\nWhat would life be like without this song? Unimaginable. Friends. I’ll Be There For You. You know you clap clap clap when they do, admit it!\n\nBeverly Hills 90210\n\nThis is one of the strictly instrumental theme songs out there, but I still get so happy whenever I hear it! Nostalgia.\n\nThe Fresh Prince of Bellaire\n\n“In West Philadelphia born and raised….” Cue the rap props. If you know all the words to this song, dust off your shoulder cuz you are a bonified G. Am I right?\n\nLiving Single\n\nGurllllll…..that saxophone tho….\n\nCharmed\n\nSaved by the Bell\n\nBoy Meets World\n\nThere were three different songs, each better than the last!\n\nSister Sister\n\nThe theme song and intro got a little sassier as the girls got into their older years. Haha.\n\nLizzie McGuire\n\nShe was my queen and therefore this was our musical thrown. I may or may not have been obsessed with her tie dye outfit. 😉\n\nThat’s So Raven\n\nNostalgia is so cozy! Ya nasty! 😉 The old school Disney channel was EPIC!\n\n7th Heaven\n\n“Where can you goooo, when the world don’t treat you right, the answer is homeeee that’s the one place that you’ll find…” come on now!\n\nOh hey Jessica Biel, how you doing girl!\n\nReba\n\nThis show is my jam, I watch everyday before work!\n\nGilmore Girls\n\nDo NOT get me started on my girl Carole King. This song is perfection and it’s like drinking a cup of tea (or ya know coffee coffee coffee) on a cold winter night. It’s just like a big hug!\n\nFull House\n\nIf you don’t know this feel good song, where have you been?\n\nFamily Matters\n\nOne Tree Hill\n\nGavin… oh dear Gavin, I thank you for this and for being the introduction to the show that single handedly shaped my writer’s soul. Hearing this song now, takes me back to watching this story unfold nearly every week with my best friend at my side as we tried to navigate middle school, high school and even the early stages of college. 9 Years people, 9 years, that’s commitment.\n\nThe OC\n\nWho else wants to live in California? They make it seem so nice. 😉\n\nSeth Cohen is my spirit animal!\n\nDegrassi\n\n“Whatever it takes, I know I can make it through!” Positive Messages! You know before they hit you with a shit ton of teenage drama. 😉 #ILOVEDSHAWN\n\nThe Walking Dead\n\nIf you read my blog you may know that The Walking Dead and I have suffered a recent break up. After Glenn’s death our relationship just wasn’t the same and I needed my space. But any time I hear our song, it just brings me back. Another instrumental, but it is so damn eerie, and it is so damn good! Those violins get me every time!\n\nSo Little Time\n\nI cannot even tell you how this song can transport me back into time. Put me on a beach in a long sweater and some capris. Girls you know what I’m talking about, watch that intro!\n\nGossip Girl\n\nSimple, but so effective. Whispers Whispers Whispers. “That’s a secret I’ll never tell, you know you love me. XOXO Gossip girl.”\n\nCity Guys & Hang Time\n\nThese two shows may not ring a bell with anyone. But they were my Saturday mornings! I don’t even really remember what channel they were on, but I loved them and I still remember their theme songs until this day.\n\nHannah Montana\n\nI may or may not have been a little older than the target audience, but yea I was still a fan! #NoShame\n\nZoey 101\n\nSabrina the teenage witch\n\n(Last one was always my fav!)\n\nThe Nanny\n\nThe Golden Girls\n\nMoesha\n\nTheme songs are so important. I know that not all shows have them, or need to have them. But if they do, they have to be good, because years and years later they will stick with you and remind you of beautiful memories. As I wrote this post, the nostalgia was so sweet.\n\n*I do not take credit for any videos, or music used.*\n\n-<3-\n\nMusic. What would I do without you?\n\nMy current obsession has been Shawn Mendes’ new album Illuminate (deluxe).\n\nIt kinda has a really familiar favorite vibe to me. Like a John Mayer, Kris Allen, Ed Sheeran vibe. Which I LOVE! He’s definitely matured artistically-writing wise and vocally. And his lyrics are still beautiful…sexier, but beautiful. Lol.\n\nHere are my current favorites-\n\nFav “Ruin” Lyrics\n\nDo ya… do you think about me?\n\nAnd do ya… do you feel the same way? Yeah\n\nAnd do ya… do you remember how we felt?\n\n‘Cause I do. So listen to me, baby.\n\nAnd do ya… do you think about me at all?\n\nAnd I’m not tryna ruin your happiness,\n\nBut darling, don’t you know that I’m the only one for ya?\n\nAnd I’m not tryna ruin your happiness, baby,\n\nBut darling, don’t you know that I’m the only one?\n\nDo I ever cross your mind?\n\nDo I…\n\nDo I ever cross your mind?\n\nDo I ever cross your mind?\n\nDo I ever cross your mind?\n\nDo I ever cross your mind?\n\nFav “Treat You Better” Lyrics\n\nI know I can treat you better than he can\n\nAnd any girl like you deserves a gentleman\n\nTell me why are we wasting time\n\nOn all your wasted crying\n\nWhen you should be with me instead\n\nI know I can treat you better\n\nBetter than he can\n\nI’ll stop time for you\n\nThe second you say you’d like me too\n\nI just wanna give you the loving that you’re missing\n\nBaby, just to wake up with you\n\nWould be everything I need and this could be so different\n\nTell me what you want to do\n\nFav “No Promises” Lyrics\n\nOh no we don’t need to overcomplicate it\n\nCause I’ve been here once before don’t even say it\n\nBaby please no promises\n\nCause we won’t keep our promises\n\nAnd I know the consequences\n\nSo baby please, baby please no promises\n\nI’ve never been a fan of heartbreak\n\nSo tell me what you want\n\nTake my hands across your body\n\nWe don’t have to hold on\n\nFav “Lights On” Lyrics\n\n*Um Dang Shawn Mendes….smooth criminal you, how old are you dude?\n\nDamn, you look so good with your clothes on\n\nAnd I’m not trying to come off too strong\n\nBut you know that I can’t help it\n\nCause girl you’re beautiful\n\nAnd I can’t deny I want your body\n\nBut I’m a gentleman so I’ll be\n\nThe one who takes it slowly\n\nCause girl you’re so beautiful\n\nI wanna love you with the lights on\n\nKeep you up all night long\n\nDarling I wanna see every inch of you\n\nI get lost in the way you move\n\nI wanna love you with the lights on\n\nHold you ’til the nights gone\n\nDarling I wanna see every inch of you\n\nI get lost in the way you move\n\nI wanna love you with the lights on\n\nFav “Hold On” Lyrics\n\nStop, take it in\n\nAnd I breath for a minute\n\nI think too much when I’m alone\n\nI never win when I\n\nKeep all my thoughts inside\n\nSo I pick up the phone\n\nAnd my dad said “Shawn, stay with me\n\nEverything will be alright\n\nI know I haven’t seen you lately\n\nBut you’re always on my mind”\n\nI don’t know what\n\nYou’re going through\n\nBut there’s so much life\n\nAhead of you\n\nAnd it won’t slow down\n\nNo matter what you do\n\nSo you just gotta hold on\n\nAll we can do is hold on, yeah\n\nSeriously which girl isn’t going to wish these songs were written for her? Or want a guy to write songs like this about her? I can’t. Just so good. Funky, sexy vibes. Cool guitar moments. A+ Mendes. You are one to watch out for!\n\nTV. My heart.\n\nThis week’s How To Get Away With Murder…hit me with another doozy.\n\nConnor and Oliver. These two are killing me with this break up. Although I want them together forever, this storyline could be really good. This push and pull between the two characters. The sexy tension. YAY! Drama. It seems like Oliver doesn’t know what he wants. He breaks up with Connor, but he still tells Connor there’s no rush to move out, still wants to work with Connor, still wants to walk over to their job together, still tries to make Connor feel better about his difficult case, still cooking for him and wanting to celebrate his first case win, he still cares. And when Connor finally agrees to give Oliver what he wants and says he will start packing, Oliver objects in tears. What the hell is going on?\n\nAnd as for Connor, I’ve never seen him so vulnerable, and emotional. He pours his heart out and gets clobbered. And that kiss was perfect. (Another thing- Oliver still kissed Connor back) I wanted to cry. My heart broke. Also I’ve never seen Connor so unsure of himself. He’s pretty cocky and pretty confident and for his personal failure to be affecting his professional obstacles shows just how much he had grown to rely on Oliver always being there. As for why they are breaking up, I really don’t buy Oliver’s crappy reasoning, because if he’s “been thinking about it all summer.” why the hell did he pretend to be Connor and decline Connor’s Stanford acceptance. If he wanted space, he would have had it. Tons of it. But he didn’t want to move and he didn’t want Connor to either. So I think there’s something else going on. And I think Oliver loves Connor just as much and Connor loves him. I just hope that they are both okay. I hope Oliver’s health status hasn’t escalated and he isn’t breaking it off with Connor to spare him or whatever. And I also hope that Shonda Rhimes doesn’t screw us all and kill one of them off, like we know she loves to do!\n\n-<3-\n\nSo I’ve noticed this bit of a “Describe Yourself In 3 Fictional Characters” challenge/trend surface on the internet lately. And I loved it and instinctively wanted to turn it into a blog post.\n\nAs a writer I have a ton of fictional characters that I relate to and feel like somehow mirror my personality. I love identifying bits of myself in characters I see written and portrayed on screen. I couldn’t decide so I did 4, #ICheated #SorryNotSorry. (well Pocahontas is based on a real woman so I guess I didn’t cheat, there’s three fictional here!)\n\nSo here goes…\n\nHaley James (Pre-Scott)\n\nPortrayed By Bethany Joy Lenz\n\nTV Show: One Tree Hill\n\nIf you’ve followed this blog before, you know my obsession with this character. It is real and she is probably my most beloved tv character. Since the first day I started watching One Tree Hill, she was the one I felt was most like me. She was the shy, smart girl who was way beyond her years, wanted to help everyone, had this keen sense between right and wrong, wasn’t popular but had her friends and family who she would do anything for and dressed kind of funky. She is my spirit animal. As later seasons came, she of course got cooler, started dating a jock, made friends with the in crowd, dressed better/different, got married in high school, and became this total rock star, made some mistakes, redeemed herself, had a baby in high school, and then later on became an English teacher and co-owner of the new and improved Karen’s Café. All while looking flawless the whole damn time. Which goes to show you, why I really identified with her in the first season mostly. As much as I love Haley James Scott, Haley James was simple, was real and her life seemed normal. Without all the fancy pants stuff, at her root Haley James-Scott or not has always had a strong moral code and a big heart and for that alone I will always be a fan. #ThatJeanJacketTho\n\nPocahontas\n\nVoice-Irene Bedard, Singing Voice-Judy Kuhn\n\nThe Disney Film\n\nWhile all the little girls wanted to be Cinderella, and Snow White, I related most to Pocahontas. To me, is was the Disney Princess who I felt looked most like me. For starters her olive complexion and her free spirit. Her barefoot adventures and love of sunflowers and jewelry and feathers. I love the story, I love her roots and how she knows who she is and knows that her family her everything. She makes decisions based on what’s best for her, she’s independent despite the many trying to decide what’s best for her. She explores, she is curious. The Indian culture has always fascinated me, and I have always felt a pull to it. She is probably the reason why.\n\nRaven Baxter\n\nPortrayed By Raven Symone\n\nTV Show: That’s So Raven\n\nFreeForm shows old school Disney shows late at night and once night I caught That’s SO Raven on TV, and I couldn’t help but laugh and see a bit of myself in her. Her crazy fashion choices, I have had my moments. #BlueLipStick #FlowersInMyHair #FurrySweaters Her impromptu dancing, her absurd slang. It’s all me. #YANASTY #OHSNAP I love her, and I too at times feel psychic. #SHHHH 😉 Also can we just state that Raven paved this way for curvy girls to feel good about themselves. She wasn’t perfect, she was curvy and loud and fun and colorful and she was SUCCESSFUL! Raven is most like my younger self, and I think she comes out still every once in a while.\n\nJane Villanueva\n\nPortrayed By Gina Rodriquez\n\nTV Show: Jane the Virgin\n\nLet’s put aside the whole baby daddy/mama drama, that is this show. Yes Jane was accidentally artificially inseminated and instantly was thrown into motherhood way ahead of her planned out life’s schedule with a guy’s baby, who she never expected to come back into her life. That is the juicy stuff and my life is nothing like hers in that sense. But for some reason in a lot of other ways, Jane may be the character I relate most too. She’s always the responsible one, but when she messes up she owns up to it, and when she let’s loose, her beauty shines. She’s an older 20’s. She is a curvy Latina, with a heart of gold and good morals and extremely close to her family. She believes in love and is a hopeless romantic-not to mention a soap opera fan too. My favorite part-she’s a writer and she is constantly drifting off into her own world, as she stars in her scenes as she writes them. Her morals are very similar to mine and I adore her character as a whole, because everything I mentioned about her holds true for me too. She spontaneous dances too, so I mean we’re twins who need to meet and be best friends.\n\nAs you can tell I love seeing strong, determines, driven, independent, caring, loving, kind, big heart of gold female characters. They are what inspires me to write and to be a better woman.\n\n-<3-\n\n*I do not take credit for any images used.*"
