        "text": "USA network released it’s new show, Pearson this Summer. My girl Bethany Joy Lenz plays Keri Allen- city attorney and right hand woman to Chicago’s mayor Bobby Novak.\n\nIn the show she is not only feisty and sarcastic, but she borders the line between right and wrong both in her professional and in her personal life. As we soon find out that she is THAT girl who is sleeping with her boss.\n\nHOWEVER, she is an intelligent, hard working, diligent woman who has gotten to where she is by her own merit. And her fear is that being with Bobby (Mayor Novak) is not only hurting her reputation but also breaking up a marriage and a family.\n\nAlthough you can see the pain that has been created due to this affair, we do find out that Bobby pursued her when he and his wife were separated. Yea yea same old story, different characters. So many #Scandal vibes up. in. here. I love it.\n\nKeri is a badass, she doesn’t take crap from anyone, and she is somehow unapologetic for her actions. I mean personally I don’t LOVE that she’s the other woman. I think it is very black and white, separated or not, he has a ring on his finger girl. AND let’s be VERY clear here, she may have slept with a married man and continued to fall into some twisted relationship with him, but HE is the married man who kept pursuing her. Just as much as it is her responsibility to check for a ring, it’s his to know he wears it and that ring is attached to a another woman he made promises to, a woman he had children with. Bobby is being sleazy. No doubt about it. But you can tell the affair wasn’t something Keri planned. And she let it go on for so long because falling in love with her boss was just kind of something that happened along the way and something she felt she couldn’t help.\n\nNeedless to say things get juicy and shit GOES DOWN as the season is coming to a close. And Keri is always trying to as Novak likes to say, “Keep her hands clean.” He doesn’t want her involved in all his behind the scenes, illegal drama. Enter- Jessica Pearson, the woman, the myth, the legend.\n\nIn order to get shit done, Keri has to be comfortable to do that. And from looking over some of her fashion in the show. I realized there are some things she seems to be drawn to.\n\nCLOTHING\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nSimple, classic, timeless pieces- such as high waisted trousers, turtlenecks, blazers, button down shirts, and trench coats.\n\nA lot of business attire.\n\nNeutral colors-blacks, grays, whites, browns, navy, light blues, etc.\n\nIn her down time I’ve seen her rock jeans and a button up or a simple LBD (Little Black Dress).\n\nACCESSORIES & NAILS\n\nNot many. At all.\n\nI’ve noticed she mostly wears simple studs and a watch.\n\nIF she happens to wear a necklace it is often something simple and delicate.\n\nHer nails are usually a very natural color too.\n\nHAIR & MAKEUP\n\nKeri keeps it very natural. She almost has that No Makeup, Makeup look.\n\nI feel like she sticks to colors that just kind of enhance the natural colors in her features.\n\nHowever, every so often she may throw on a red lip, and it adds that extra pop.\n\nAs for her hair she keeps that classic too. Just some simple twists or power pony’s. Or some soft curls.\n\nMy Keri Allen Inspired Look:\n\nBased off this look.\n\nI pulled this black blazer from my closet, that has some striped print when you roll the sleeves, I thought it was similar to Keri’s style. Black dress pants that have a higher waist line, and a white button down shirt.\n\nI couldn’t really see her shoes in any of the shots, but I feel like you can’t go wrong with a trusty black pump.\n\nI work in a much more relaxed environment so I can wear jeans and sneakers. But after dressing in Keri’s style for a minute, I kind of liked the classic look. It was fun, put me in an office! Actually no, I’d never want an office job, I feel like an office style would be too restricting for me. I like to dress comfortable, and funky at times, Lol.\n\nThe Comparison…How did I do?\n\nDo you like Keri Allen’s classic style? Visit this site and shop her clothes!\n\nThe Pearson Season 1 finale airs this Wednesday @ 10 PM on the USA Network.\n\nCheck your local listings!\n\n-<3-\n\n*I do not take credit for the Keri/Jessica/Pearson stills/gifs/ video clips used.*\n\n*All other images are my own.*\n\nTELEVISION\n\n!!!!! SPOILERS AHEAD !!!!!\n\nJane The Virgin [Premiered it’s 5th and Last Season]\n\nCRAZY SHOUT OUT TO THIS QUEEN for this INSANE 7 minute monologue done in one continuous shot! Gina Rodriguez is EPIC! Please give her all the awards. I remember watching this and just being in complete awe of her. Her acting was complete and total brilliance. Read about the process of shooting this scene HERE\n\nI’m a total TV nerd, who loves to plan and who loves a good theme. I do this often. Here’s my Jane the Virgin finale setup. Yes, I do this just for me. And I freaking LOVE IT!\n\nAllow me to explain.\n\nMy set up includes:\n\nA flower (Jane’s grandma’s virginity metaphor) Haha.\n\nWhite petals to symbolize her moments with Rafael.\n\nSnowballs to symbolize the title of Jane’s first novel- Snow Falling and her life with Michael.\n\nA cross necklace to symbolize the strong faith this show has and it’s also a necklace I think Jane has worn in earlier seasons.\n\nA soap opera digest as a ode to the show’s telenovela nature.\n\nA lavender drink and tablecloth because it’s Rogelio’s favorite color.\n\nAnd lastly the meal that just screams Villanueva- a grilled cheese sandwich.\n\nOh and I made a ratchet t-shirt of course with my favorite quote. Because duh?\n\nThe finale episode made me laugh, made me cry, made me gasp. But mostly it made me realize how much I’m going to miss this show. Excellent, television. A true game changer. Thank you. Can’t wait for the spinoff!\n\nAlways knew these two were endgame.\n\nMy girl, Sophia Bush even guest starred this season! 😀\n\nGrand Hotel\n\nThis show premiered this Summer and honestly it had me hooked. It’s mysterious, and romantic and full of drama. I hope it gets a season 2, because I just watched the finale and it was bringing the plot twists left and right! Also I think there are many familiar faces involved.\n\nP.S. did I mention the ROMANCE!\n\nThe Bachelorette (Hannah B’s Season) / Bachelor in Paradise\n\nWhy am I so invested in these cheap, reality shows! I am so convinced it is heavily scripted, but I can’t take my eyes away. It’s like a cringeworthy car crash. I have not watched The Bachelor franchise in years. I think I may have watched the first season of The Bachelorette and that is all. But I kept seeing all this drama surrounding Hannah B.’s season and I just got curious and binge-watched it on demand, getting all caught up before home town visits. PETER WAS MY FAVORITE! And as for Hannah, I did like her, but sometimes I found myself screaming at her on my tv too. She definitely had her badass, female empowerment moments too though. So you do you Hannah Boo. Girl is going to be on this Season’s Dancing with the Stars. Like…what? Crazy! She’s everywhere!\n\nPILOT PETE!!!!!! #Windmill #JesusStillLovesMe\n\nI had a little party for the finale. I was so nervous while watching. I wanted her to pick Peter SOOOO bad, but if you watched you know she didn’t. So fingers crossed that he is the next bachelor! #SIGNMEUP #IDGIVEHIMALLTHEROSES\n\nAnd then after that ended Bachelor in Paradise started up…and I didn’t even know this was a thing. Various past contestants get to come back and get another shot at finding love as they stay on a beach in Mexico. So I was like what the hell? Why not. Some of the guys from Hannah’s season were on so I was like woohoo, #SummerTV. Connor, Dylan, Mike, Luke S. were on and some others too. And it is so dramatic and I feel so frustrated watching it, but I can’t help it. It’s entertaining as hell. LOL. My fav couples are Katie & Chris and Clay and Nicole. I just hope they end up together. I also really loved Derek who was from a different season but he is no longer on. The finale is next week and then we get a reunion show, SO HEYYYY!!!! And the next Bachelor is announced. What do we think guys, do those ankles from that new promo look like Peter’s? I sure hope so!\n\nBH 90210\n\nWhen I heard about this reboot, I WAS ESTATIC. When I heard about the concept, not so much. I was nervous, and skeptical. I wanted to love it, but I was scared I wouldn’t. But…it is actually SO DAMN GOOD. This take on the reboot trend is fresh and inventive. I’m so sad it’s only 6 episodes. The season finale is tonight! I hope they bring it back for season 2! It’s so funny, nostalgic and oddly mysterious. It makes my heart happy to see the crew back together. Although I must say…Luke Perry will always be missed.\n\nI may have been a bit young to watch 90210 from the start. But I remember being obsessed with the reruns so much I ran out and bought the first season on DVD. From 90210 where this dream boat waltzed in as Dylan McKay and made girls everywhere swoon. I was unable to decide if I liked him more with Brenda or with Kelly because he made both relationships look so good. To the original Buffy the Vampire Slayer movie where he was once again the adorable love interest. To when he guest starred on old pal “Kelly’s” “What I Like About You” show. To his most recent role as Fred Andrew’s on CWs hit Riverdale. I’ve followed his career and have always loved him. My heart is broken to know he is gone. 💔 I still can’t believe it. Rest in Peace Luke Perry. You’ll always be a legend. #DylanMckay\n\nI had a little fun premiere party with my sister in law, so I thought why not honor the peach pit, by bringing in some peach vibes…I also rocked this 90210 shirt I made from an old shirt that didn’t fit anymore. I cut out the logo and sewed it to a white tee, that I cropped and made tie.\n\nPearson [Premiered it’s 1st season on USA]\n\nYou know why I’m watching this….my girl Bethany Joy Lenz plays Keri Allen!\n\nI was never a “SUITS” viewer, but I know this is a spin-off based on Jessica Pearson from the show. It is a bit hard to get fully invested in at times, because I honestly just want to see Joy on my screen at all times. LOL. But she does play a vital role. She plays city attorney and left hand woman to Chicago’s mayor Bobby Novak…whom she is having an on going affair with. It’s steamy and sexy and SAD…because there are so many complications and so many times you just want to scream at Keri for being THAT GIRL. But tv is NEVER just right or wrong, Pearson explores the Gray. The Gray in Law, in Politics, and in Love. I AM HERE FOR IT! The finale is next week. So I’m excited, I hope it gets a season 2! Because I really like seeing both Jessica Pearson and Keri Allen be kickass, powerful women BOSSES.\n\nKeri & Bobby THO!!!! #SWOON\n\nHad a little Pearson Premiere Party because I’m a tv geek and I love Joy. So my best friend and I got together to watch.\n\nYounger [Premiered it’s 6th Season]\n\nI fell in love with this show, when it first premiered. And I mean Hilary Duff…duh?\n\nThe finale just aired and this season was full of crazy twists and turns and lots of laughs. But of course in the land of Charles & Liza vs. Liza & Josh. I am all about #TEAMJOSH. Season 7 COMING SOON!\n\nStranger Things [Premiered it’s 3rd Season on Netflix]\n\nIt’s been a minute since Season 2! I’m a little sad that this season is only 8 episodes. I am currently up to 6. And I have to say it’s not my favorite season. But there has definitely been some really good stuff so far. So I’m excited to see all that goes down in the upside down and the real world parallels.\n\nI went to Coney Island this Summer and it was all decked out in promotion for the show. AND Baskin Robbins released special ice cream flavors for the show too! Eleven’s Heaven (White), Upside Down Pralines (Chocolate). They were amazing! Especially the Eleven’s Heaven, it had waffle cone pieces in it. #HEAVEN\n\nIn The Dark [This wasn’t exactly a summer show, but I have yet to talk about it on this blog, so I just wanted to give it a shout out, because it is so good.] A really unique storyline that follows a blind girl who becomes obsessed with the death of a close friend, and takes it upon herself to get him some justice. She is a real fire cracker who hands out insults often, loves smoking and generally hates life. But somehow, you just end up falling in love with her clever angsty wit. I was happy to hear it was picked up for a second season!\n\nPlus…there’s this guy…what a dreamboat. Casey Deidrick who played Chad on Days of Our Lives and Tommy in an MTV show “Eye Candy” that got cancelled, when it shouldn’t have.\n\nScream (Season 3, not sure when this premiered on tv…I just saw it pop up on Netflix and got super excited.)\n\nSeasons 1 &2 were pretty good, I used to love the original slasher films as a kid. I thought they were mysterious and scary. That and I Know What You Did Last Summer were slasher jams growing up in the 90’s/00’s. So I was hyped to see they FINALLY released a Season 3 after all the confusion and cast changes. The plot twist was nice! I was happy that they played with the audience, I was all over the place as to who the killer was. It was only 6 episodes, so I finished it in like 2 days. But with Halloween coming up, it’s perfect to get into the spooky spirit.\n\nHere’s the trailer if your interested.\n\nSo there you have it, my Summer TV recap. Check ’em out!\n\nAnd tell me what you watched this Summer!\n\n*The only photos that I take credit for are the “Premiere Party” photos.*\n\n-<3-\n\nMUSIC\n\nTori Kelly\n\nInspired by True Events [released August 2019]\n\nSo I actually saw Tori back in April for the her Acoustic Sessions- where she not only performed songs from her incredible Gospel album “Hiding Place”, but also a lot of unreleased music that she just recently released in this new project.\n\nAnd holy crap…what an absolute masterpiece. Not only are the songs/lyrics incredible… but the concept “Inspired by True Events” is so beautiful and personal. She wrote from personal memories and she even included voice clips of her younger self. It’s just so amazing.\n\nMy favorite tracks are, Coffee, 2 Places, Kid I Used To Know, and Pretty Fades.\n\nShawn Mendes\n\nSelf titled album [released May 2018…but it’s been releasing new material well into this year.]\n\nMy favorite tracks include, Senorita, If I Can’t Have You, Fallin’ All In You, Where Were You In The Morning, Nervous, Particular Taste [Gives me serious Prince vibes!], Mutual, Queen and When You’re Ready [That’s like the whole album LOLOL, omg I told you I LOVE his music.]\n\nThe Shawn Mendes Tour\n\nI saw Shawn in concert at Barclay’s Center on August 23rd. I randomly bought tickets because it dawned on me how much I love his music- I’ve been listening since Handwritten, yo! I also became obsessed with his new single “If I Can’t Have You.” So my friend and I were super excited to get our cougar on, and go and sing our asses off with all the little teens. Fun Fact: we were those some older girls a few years back when we went to see Justin Bieber. Haha.\n\nHowever, I promised you the full concert experience story so here it goes…\n\nShawn Mendes was AMAZING! Such a stinking cutie pie. I know I have a few years on him, but I have such a stinking crush on this cutie! If only I was 21 again. 😉 Boy can SING! And his music is so damn good. I kind of was hoping for a Camila Cabello surprise, but she wasn’t there. He did do a short mash up of Senorita/I Know What You Did Last Summer, but we definitely missed Camila. He shortened the songs significantly. He also surprised us with a coldplay cover and a FREAKIN WHITNEY HOUSTON cover. LIKE BOY….WHAT? He definitely put on a great show.\n\nBUT had it not been for one sweet woman who exchanged our seats for closer ones, I think I might have had a panic attack in that arena in the upper level. I had purchased tickets in section 206, because frankly it was all I could afford. The structure is INSANELY dangerous. Walking up those stairs was terrifying. I just tried to keep my cool, because it would have been very easy to let my anxiety take over. But I knew I had to keep it together, if I had any chance of enjoying the show.\n\nMy friend has a fear of heights (which sadly I did not know, otherwise I never would have bought those seats!) and so I realized quickly we needed to do something. Thankfully she came up with the idea to see if we could get our seats changed. And so the craziness continued. Not only did the venue let us in later than they should (seriously how do they expect thousands of people to be seated in 10-15 minutes/security check alone was like 10!), and they let us in a weird side entrance where we could not catch an elevator, escalators weren’t working and there was no one really telling us where to go. We had to walk up flights of stairs to get to our seats, not to mention that you had to walk a marathon to get food. All of this drama, causing so many people to miss the opening act- Alessia Cara. I heard her and caught a few bits, she was AMAZING. WHAT A DAMN VOICE. SHE SANG “How Far I’ll Go” from MOANA! #FEELS\n\nI have to say in an emergency situation, I would not have felt safe in that arena. It just seemed like no one cared.\n\nAnyway once we let Alessia’s set finish, I knew we had a small window to change our situation before Shawn took the stage. So my friend and I had to look for an usher, yes WE HAD TO LOOK FOR THEM, and ask if we could get our seats changed. I have to be honest, I didn’t think that was a thing. But my friend was like, we have to try, and she was right, the longer we sat up in those steep seats, the scarier it got. We definitely would not have felt safe to get up, let alone dance.\n\nSo the usher (although nice) told us he couldn’t help us and to go to guest services, to which the man there kept ignoring our complaints stating, “you don’t have a disability,” so he can’t help me. I was pissed.\n\nSo finally another woman told us to try the box office. We get to the box office and they tell us to go to guest services, and I was like “no, we were just there, they sent us here.” She almost told us there’s nothing they can do, that all we can do is purchase ANOTHER ticket. MIND you those nose bleeds seats COSTED $85. I was like “That’s insane, we paid to be here, and we can’t sit there, I’m not asking you to give me some crazy front row seats, we just have to get out of ours.” The woman was very understanding, but you could tell she was not sure if she could help us, claiming that guest services keeps sending people to her. So, this is not the first complaint they’ve gotten. If you have vertigo, you’d probably pass out up there. I mean I myself almost had a panic attack up there, it was so scary. Anway, the woman came back a few minutes later with two tickets, saying, “It’s your lucky day.” And it got me thinking, how many people who complained weren’t THAT lucky.\n\nThere really should be a change made. I know we are not the first people to complain about the steep seating. Not to mention that Barclays Center actually has a policy that says special accommodations can be made at the venue day of. I understand anxiety may not be a disability, but it IS real. We happen to get “lucky” that the seats we were given were being saved for someone who didn’t show. We went from section 206 to 124, and it was AMAZING. We were able to dance freely and enjoy the rest of our night…thankfully. Just out of curiosity I looked up our tickets…and they were about $200+. THAT’s INSANE. I guess safety costs! HUH?\n\nI’ll just leave this article HERE. Because I am not the only one who feels this way. Concerts are supposed to be a fun experience not a dangerous one. (And no I wasn’t drinking, (and my friend barely finished hers because she got so anxious from the seating) I can only imagine how many people have fallen because of the combination of alcohol and steep seating.)\n\n^ The left we were sitting way high up in the nose bleeds. The right we were in our new seats.^\n\nFrom all these pictures you would never know the kind of concert experience we had! I may not be a fan of the venue, but I am a fan of the very sweet woman who accommodated us when no one else would. I will NEVER purchase tickets that high up again, and if this venue wasn’t so convenient for me to go to, I probably would never purchase tickets there again at all. An unforgettable night for sure, a list of things that went wrong. But girl, we hung in and we conquered it! #FightForYourHealth #Memories #AnxietyIsReal #SafetyIsAPriority\n\nShawn is a class act, the arena lit up beautifully with everyone wearing the bracelets they gave us as we walked in. And Shawn barely ever left the stage, performing an epic 23 song set! He is an insane talent. THAT is what I am choosing to focus on, that in the end, we were STILL able to have a good time. I just hope that Barclays takes measures to create a safer environment for concert goers.\n\nSet list (via setlist.fm)\n\nLost in Japan\n\nThere’s Nothing Holdin’ Me Back\n\nNervous\n\nStitches\n\nSeñorita / I Know What You Did Last Summer\n\nMutual\n\nBad Reputation\n\nNever Be Alone\n\nB-Stage:\n\nI Wanna Dance With Somebody (Who Loves Me)\n\n(Whitney Houston cover)\n\nA Little Too Much / Because I Had You / Patience / When You’re Ready\n\nLife of the Party\n\nLike to Be You\n\nRuin\n\nA-Stage:\n\nTreat You Better\n\nParticular Taste\n\nWhere Were You in the Morning?\n\nFallin’ All in You\n\nYouth\n\nIf I Can’t Have You\n\nWhy\n\nMercy\n\nEncore:\n\nFix You\n\n(Coldplay cover)\n\nIn My Blood\n\nBy the way…Here was my concert going outfit. I was really excited about it!\n\nI basically just wanted an all black base so I could rock this funky kimono. And of course I did gold jewelry and gold nails. Mind you, I was on a budget and this WHOLE outfit (aside from the bag and jewelry which I already had) costed me about $40! I think it kinda turned out pretty cool! 🙂\n\nTaylor Swift\n\nLover [released August 2019]\n\nWe know how I feel about this new album!\n\n***** 5 Stars!!!\n\nMy favorite tracks include- I Forgot That You Existed, The Man, I Think He Knows, False God & Afterglow. But honestly I love every single track. Her lyrics are GOLD! She truly was born to do this!\n\nEd Sheeran\n\nNo. 6 Collaborations Project [released July 2019]\n\nSome of my favorite tracks are Beautiful People ft. Khalid, South of the Border ft. Camila Cabello & Cardi B., I Don’t Care with Justin Bieber (of course cuz it’s a JAM!), I Don’t Want Your Money ft. H.E.R, Put It All On Me ft. Ella Mai [this gives me suchBlackstreet & Mya-“Take me there”/City High “What would you do” vibes and the very beginning of this track is very “My whole life has changed” by Ginuwine.\n\nOk so I know I’ve been sleeping on this album and I’m kind of mad at myself because I consider myself an Ed Sheeran fan. He is actually on my concert bucket list, along with Taylor Swift, Bruno Mars and Joy Williams (previously known as 1/2 of The Civil Wars). I had given it a quick listen one day, but didn’t really let it sink in, but recently I have just been playing it at random times, and I mean I totally dig the concept of creating a full album of collabs. He really collaborated with such a variety of artists and he killed it. He really can do anything. Such an incredible artist. I’m just going to leave you with this Dublin concert video, because I can’t tell you how many times I’ve watched this in the past….him and a loop pedal…EPIC!\n\nThe Jonas Brothers\n\nHappiness Begins [released June 2019]\n\nSo this was a THING! The brothers reunited musically after being separated for the past 6 years. I wasn’t A HUGE DIE HARD fan of the JoBros, but I did vibe with them and their music. I LOVED their A Little Bit Longer Album and I’ve loved their solo music too. When I heard they reunited, my boy band loving heart was HAPPY. If tickets were cheaper, I’d probably go see them just to fill my boy band void. #IMLOOKINGATYOU*NSYNC\n\nMy favorite tracks include, Sucker (OBVI…it’s a damn BOP!), Only Human (loved it before it was a single), I Believe, Used To Be, and Rollercoaster.\n\nI really like this album. Do it JOBROS! I know it’s been a minute, but I love that they are brothers/family first.\n\nYou can listen to these albums on Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, etc.\n\n*I do not take credit for any album art used.*\n\n*All other images are my own.*\n\n-<3-\n\nI know I haven’t posted much this summer… I guess I’ve just been busy…\n\nLIVIN MY BEST LIFE! 😉\n\nAs this Summer officially comes to an end for me, (I start work back up tomorrow!) it has dawned on me that this Summer has been pretty great. Which is not always the case for me. No, I wasn’t able to go on some luxurious vacation, but I was able to have some really fun times with great family, friends, food, and lots of wine! 😉 I got to do more than I usually get to, because this summer I decided to take off of work. Granted, my job is different then most, I can either apply to work the summer or not, it’s my choice. Normally I work every Summer, but something made me decline this Summer. And I’m glad I did. My credit card isn’t happy, but I think it was the right move for me personally.\n\nNo my Summer wasn’t perfect, it actually started off really difficult for me and my family. And I have had many emotional moments and hard times, but when I look at all the good. Somehow, that wins. Good always wins. And so, I thought before I jump back into my usual work routine, I should just take a second and reflect of the Summer memories I was blessed with.\n\nJUNE, JULY, & AUGUST 2019\n\nMy Summer started with my usual tradition of taking my mom to see a broadway show. I get her tickets for her Mother’s Day gift and then we usually see the show in June. This year we saw Waitress, and it was ABSOLUTELY amazing. [Fun Fact: I actually just watched the movie and it was good, but I LOVED the play even more!)]\n\n4th of July we celebrated with some family and it was really sweltering hot, but it was a really great time. As an anxious person, heat really tends to effect me. But I’ve really learned to manage my anxiety in the Summer better. The 4th was really fun! Especially since my cousin and his family were in from Florida. It was really nice to be able to spend a holiday with them, it’s been a minute! I also found this super simple COOKIE RECIPE, and they were a hit! I think I made them, like 3 times for 3 separate occasions this summer, I just switch up the sprinkles depending on the occasion. A kid favorite for sure! *You could totally make these for Fall, Halloween, Christmas, Easter, etc. I would even like to try it with chocolate cake mix. BTW if you look closely, you may spy that I wore a Britney Spears t-shirt…it was the only red, white, & blue I had. And like I was cool with it! 😉 #ITSBRITNEYBITCH Guess you can tell, I’m kind of a graphic tee fan…more to come on that later on!\n\nA Stranger Things themed Coney Island! So if you are a fan of the sci fi/mystery Netflix show, you would know that this Summer Season 3 was released. [I’M ONLY UP TO EPISODE 6…SHHHHH!!!!] Coney Island was transformed into a Stranger Things theme park in the show’s 80’s fashion. It consisted of just posters hung around of the logo and the characters, the theme song was placing on the speakers, and the staff had on custom tees. Nothing crazy, I was kind of disappointed. BUT I went with my mom, aunt and my aunt surprised us by bringing my goddaughter, so we got to go on some rides, play games, and eat some food court summer food.\n\nLocal Baseball Game for my Cousin’s husband’s 40th birthday! I’m not a super fan of baseball, but we had a box room, and there was catered food, and the weather was great. The kids even got to run the bases after the game.\n\nI got to catch up with my coworkers…and eat this load of calories! 😛\n\nAtlantic City Overnighter with my fav ladies, my mom and my aunt! We stopped in the small town Smithville on the way. Gambling isn’t my fav, because I HATE losing money. But there were a few fun games I liked, like CRAZY MONEY! BUT I got some sweet Gilmore Girls/Stars Hollow vibes from the small, quaint town, and picked up some goodies.\n\n[INSERT MINI SMITHVILLE HAUL-SLIDESHOW BELOW]\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nTOY STORY 4! THE LION KING! ALADDIN! #RELIVEDMYCHILDHOOD Thank you!\n\nSo I never had a super strong connection to The Lion King or Aladdin as a kid. I was never a super big Disney kid, I had my favorites but they weren’t it. But I really had to see the new live action films. Because, duh? However, Toy Story was a thing! My brother and I were a fan of the films growing up.\n\nI really enjoyed all three films.\n\n[INSERT MINI MOVIE REVIEWS!]\n\nThe Lion King was a little bittersweet because I felt like Nala being played by Beyoncé kept taking me out of the story, because I was just thinking ok you’re Beyoncé. And I just felt annoyed by it. And I just felt like the real animals (although Timon and Pumbaa were HYSTERICAL) were just weird to watch in this sing along world. I felt like the color in the animation helped with suspending reality and enjoying the world. But I did enjoy it for the most part, the original is better, in my opinion. The music was better in the original too.\n\nAladdin was amazing! I loved the romance between Aladdin and Jasmine. You know me, if there’s a love story, I AM IN IT! I thought Jasmine’s vocals were INSANE. And Will Smith as the genie….I mean he cracked me up the whole damn time. The music was beautiful…And I watched a crappy boot leg copy because by the time, I got around to watching it, it wasn’t playing in theaters near me. But I really loved it, and if I watched it in a clear, crisp copy, I’d probably love it even more.\n\nToy Story 4 was EPIC! It was everything-emotional, funny, nostalgic, scary….like those dummy dolls were legit! It was amazing and I actually didn’t think the ending was as sad as everyone made it. I think it actually left room for other films.\n\nPool/Beach Vibes\n\nSo I actually got to go to the beach TWICE this Summer, which is kind of a big deal for me. There have been some Summers I wouldn’t get to go at all! I went once with my mom to a local beach, then I went to Ocean City with some family, and stayed with them in a rented house for a few days. I also got to have some fun pool days, one with my best friend at her house and one with some family, my cousin has a pool membership. I kid you not it was very Stranger Things-80’s pool vibes. Super fun!\n\n[INSERT MINI OCEAN CITY HAUL]\n\nWe were only there for 5 days, but we did so much! The beach, the amusement park, the water park, the arcade, BBQ nights in, shopping strips, dinner night outs, we played cards and other games, mini golf AND survived the crazy heat wave too! 😉\n\nI bought my family tickets to see Ain’t Too Proud! It was my dad’s father’s day gift this year! And the talent was incredible! I honestly was so amazed by their vocals. I grew up with the music of The Temptations playing in my house. I’m definitely a MOTOWN influenced kid. I love their music, songs like My Girl and Just My Imagination were some of my favs! The show was so amazing, I felt like I was seeing them live in concert.\n\nDescendants 3 Premiere with my God Daughter!\n\nMy cousin threw a party for her daughter & her friends, and so I made some fun treats for the girlies. Besides, I was kind of excited for the 3rd film too! I was a bit obsessed with Evie’s blue and red vibes from the second film. The second is my favorite, but I enjoyed the new film too!\n\nI love planning themed parties, and believe me I have a few TV related mini parties I had throughout this summer, but I’m going to do a whole separate post on my Summer TV and Music Favs! So STAY TUNED!\n\nFun with Fashion!!!\n\nI got to play around a little more with fashion this summer. More than I usually do, because I didn’t have to dress a certain way for work. Also, I became a huge fan of hats and tassel earrings. Also the two white t-shirts with the logos on them are both shirts made by my brother. The “she writes her own story” tee was a custom made for me, but the “You’re Making Me Blush” tee is available on his etsy shop! He has some great designs up, please take a look and follow him on instagram @mytshirtaddiction\n\nI told you I love graphic tees, I guess it runs in the family! 😉\n\nI just got a fresh new cut and color because my hair was kind of looking rough from dying it purple in April. I basically had Mermaid hair all Summer. Which was like cool, but I was growing sick of it and I needed a darker vibe for Fall! I’ve had Pink, Blue, and Purple hair over the years and I still have yet to show any of that on this blog! One of these days, I’m going to do a whole Hair Chronicles! LOL.\n\nHad My God Daughter over for a sleepover- and we did everything under the sun from making tie dye tees to baking a cake for my brother’s birthday to making our own chipwiches- I also created a scavenger hunt for her! We also had my brother and his family stay over unexpectedly one night, and it was my niece’s first sleepover at our house. So I had to scramble and make it festive for her and get her some goodies. We decorate every time we have my god daughter for sleepovers so we had to do the same for my niece too! I also babysat my niece by myself for the first time! (It’s not like I can’t… I just never have until this summer, I can be a nervous Nancy when it comes to watching kids all by myself. LOL) Great times with my two favorite little girlies!!!!\n\nMusic & TV Vibes!\n\nSo I do want to share with you all the shows and music I fell in love with this Summer in a separate post, but I just wanted to highlight a few things! I saw Shawn Mendes in concert with my friend and needless to say it was kind of an anxious experience. I will get more into it in a separate post. But let’s just say I will never sit in Barclay’s upper seating again. It’s quite terrifying! Shawn however, was AMAZING! And it ended up being a fun night. Taylor Swift dropped her new album #Lover as you may have guessed from my last few posts, I’m KIND OF a fan! It’s EPIC and I love it! So there has been lots of fun Taylor Swift memories this Summer. As for tv, there were so many shows I saw premiere, shows end and all the feels in between. But the two that I hold so dear to my heart has to be the new 90210 reboot- BH 90210. SO GOOD! And the announcement of the Lizzie McGuire reboot! I AM DYING!!!! SO SO PUMPED for that! I’m already planning my premiere party in my head guys! Nostalgia is a dish best served nice and toasty. Childhood memories….feels like home.\n\nFamily Day at the Aquarium! We got caught in torrential down pour, but it was still a good time!\n\nSpeaking of rain, I think I got caught in crazy down pours and thundering and lightning like 4-5 times this summer. I’ve been soaked from head to toe on multiple occasions. One time my umbrella wouldn’t even open! Some days I could laugh it off and some I just wanted to stop and cry! But looking back at this summer I can just say Thank You! Thank You 2019 for getting me through some really hard emotional blocks, and testing me and proving to me that I can handle so much more than I give myself credit for. Anxiety does not define me. And just because I feel the weight of the world one day or even a week doesn’t mean that it’s forever. That my funky moods, don’t have to be my all day moods! I’m so hoping to bring that knowledge with me into this new Fall Season…MY FAVORITE SEASON! Such a basic bi*ch, I know! #FIGHTME. 😉 BRING ON THE PUMPKIN EVERYTHANG, the flannel, the leather, the cool air, the crisp leaves and the HOLIDAYS! I feel so blessed to have had the Summer I did. And blessed to start this new fall year, that is already filling up with some exciting things!\n\nTime to focus on the positive.\n\nHow was your Summer?\n\n*All images are my own, except the movie posters, the Taylor Swift image I stole from my bestie, and the Lizzie McGuire pic I reposted from Hilary’s instagram.* 😉\n\n-<3-"
