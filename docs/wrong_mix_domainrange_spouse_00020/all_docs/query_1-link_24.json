        "text": "One Tree Hill fans think there may be some drama going on behind the scenes of Drama Queens.\n\nAt the beginning of March, fans of the iHeart Media podcast‚Äîhosted by former costars Hilarie Burton, Bethany Joy Lenz, and Sophia Bush‚Äîbegan to suspect that two of the three women were no longer on good terms. While Burton‚Äôs and Bush's OTH characters, Payton and Brooke, had the most beef during the series' run from 2003 to 2012 (we all know Lucas Scott's name was on the damn door under Brooke's name), this alleged feud involves Burton and Lenz, who played even-keeled Haley James Scott on the popular teen drama.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about the online discourse, which would probably be better suited for BookTok than The CW.\n\nA bit of important background context first:\n\nOver the years Burton, Bush, and Lenz have spoken at length about misogynistic and inappropriate behavior by show creator Mark Schwahn. Back in 2017, Burton, Bush, and Lenz joined other former stars of the show in signing an open letter accusing him of sexual harassment and manipulation.\n\nOn their own podcast the trio discussed how Schwahn would pit the women on the series against one another. In one instance, Burton and Bush were pressured to take part in a Maxim magazine cover shoot in 2006, while Lenz was told she was ‚Äútoo fat‚Äù for the cover and was replaced by castmate Danneel Ackles. However, Bush was led to believe Lenz turned the shoot down.\n\n‚ÄúWhen I said, ‚ÄòI don‚Äôt want to do it,‚Äô I was like, ‚ÄòBut Joy‚Äôs not doing it! She said no. Why does she get to say no?‚Äô‚Äù Bush recalled. ‚ÄúThey go, ‚ÄòWell, she said no, so you have to say yes. She said no first.‚Äô They scapegoated you to tell the three of us we couldn‚Äôt say no‚Ä¶. We weren‚Äôt mad at you but we were pissed about it.‚Äù\n\nAll this is to say, any discussion of ‚Äúfeuding‚Äù between these women is bound to bring up some intense feelings for fans as well as the actors themselves.\n\nSo what‚Äôs going on right now?\n\nOn February 29, Bethany Joy Lenz announced her new memoir, Dinner for Vampires: Life on a Cult TV Show.\n\n‚ÄúDinner for Vampires, my memoir about the decade I spent in an abusive, high-demand group (a.k.a. cult) is on presale now,‚Äù she captioned her post. ‚ÄúBeing a writer has been a great, private joy in my life since I was about 12. This isn‚Äôt the first book I thought I‚Äôd write, publicly, but as difficult as this subject matter is to untangle, I‚Äôm grateful I get to share my story, my way. It‚Äôs a story of forgiveness and a roadmap to how manipulation works, with heartache and humor along the way. We all make mistakes and I hope Dinner for Vampires reminds you that, no matter what weird roads you‚Äôve gone down, you‚Äôre not alone.‚Äù\n\nMeanwhile, others are just sad about the alleged drama, going so far as to suggest Burton is ‚Äúbullying‚Äù Lenz. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sad to see what is happening with Joy Lenz,‚Äù one fan commented on one of Burton's recent posts. ‚ÄúI wish you continued to be an example modeling friendship. Even navigating friendship that don‚Äôt work in a productive way. I‚Äôm sure there is more to the story but the part you made us part of it and the part you showed makes it look like you‚Äôre bullying joy. I‚Äôm so sad. I loved the podcast but i guess that wasn‚Äôt real. Hope y‚Äôall can work it out. Wish you guys both healing or moving on.‚Äù\n\nOn TikTok, another commented, ‚ÄúIf they end drama queens before getting through the whole series I am going to be UP IN ARMS. ü§¨‚Äù\n\nThe topic continues to pick up steam on the social media video app.\n\nTikTok content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nWill this effect Drama Queens?\n\nAs of March 4, Drama Queens is still promoting new episodes.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nHave Burton and Lenz commented on the situation?\n\nWhile Lenz has limited comments on her memoir announcement, there have been no official comments at this time. Glamour has reached out to representatives from both parties.\n\nThis post may be updated."
