        "text": "3×08 – “The Worst Day Since Yesterday”\n\nOverview: Brooke deals with the fallout of sleeping with Chris Keller, Karen deals with Dan and everyone prepares for the first Ravens game of the season.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nLucas is allowed to be grossed out about Chris Keller but he’s not allowed to be mad. He and Brooke were not together.\n\nNathan Scott is my favorite. All protective over Brooke. And threatening Chris Keller. It’s so hot. “I like to think of that as hitting you. Without the hitting.”\n\nWho wouldn’t vote for Karen? She is a gem.\n\nJust the thought of Dan wanting or trying to hurt Nathan makes me want to throw him off a bridge. Such an abusive bastard.\n\nWatching Nathan & Haley have a civilized conversation at this point makes me so happy. I DON’T ASK FOR MUCH.\n\nKaren Roe for PRESIDENT. When she messes up that quote about getting under someone? I die. She is hilarious.\n\nLOL at Whitey making Tim wear 0 after he gets 55 tattooed on himself. Whitey is kind of the best.\n\nIf Danneel was cheering for me, I would have a really hard time concentrating. Lady is a bombshell. I love her.\n\nI crack up laughing every time Nathan nails Chris in the face with the ball. And then he laughs at Lucas and is SO cute.\n\nSo when Nathan calls Haley right away after talking to her so that they can walk together, I start crying and making these strange noises because OH MY GOD THEY ARE SO PRECIOUS.\n\nGo Mouth. Getting Dan beating up his kid on tape is super rad.\n\nBest Bit: James’ impression of CMM is SPOT ON and PERFECT and I could watch it forever. Seriously. I just die. Over and over. Also, his buzz cut is so damn sexy.\n\nUgh! Moment: Dan going after Nathan in the locker room. It makes my blood boil and I just want to KILL him. Such a dick.\n\nFave Quote: “Quit looking at Keller. We already know he can score.” Snarky Nathan is amazing.\n\nBiggest Question: How come the team didn’t make Lucas join in with the shaved heads thing? He probably needs it more than anyone eles!\n\nOn My iPod: “Song Beneath The Song” by Maria Taylor & “The Mixed Tape” by Jack’s Mannequin\n\n3×09 – “How a Resurrection Really Feels”\n\nOverview: The election comes to a close, the investigation into who tried to kill Dan heats up, and Nathan hits the road with Chris Keller.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\n“I guess we know who the cellblock tough’s gonna be.” Brooke is hilarious. I don’t think they would have been put into jumpsuits, though.\n\nWhen I first thought Nathan was telling this stuff to Haley, I got really upset. Thank GOD it was just Chris Keller.\n\nI remember wanting to know who was on that tape SO BAD. It was murder waiting to find out. Not sure I ever pegged Deb, though.\n\nI love Marty and I LOVE that he was mentioned again in Season 9. Hilarious.\n\nThe birth of Clothes over Bros!!! Awwwwwww!!!! The unnecessary apostrophe really bothers me, though.\n\nEvery interaction between Nathan and Chris Keller is priceless. They are incredible together. No wonder James had so much fun filming this episode. It’s so much fun to watch!\n\nAfter hearing “Halo” for the first time, I sang it non-stop in my head FOR MONTHS. Killer jam.\n\n“Chris Keller’s work here is done.” Farewell Chris Keller (for now).\n\nI can never decide whether or not I like Peyton’s inner conversations with her Halloween self.\n\nI feel so bad for Brooke. Lucas really dicked her over and she was just trying to protect her heart and he couldn’t handle it. What an ass. Glad he finally got over himself.\n\nBest Bit: I BET YOU’LL NEVER GUESS. Sweet reunion heaven. Everything about it is perfect. The way they look at each other, their kissing. The recreation of the scene at the door when Nathan asks if he can stay with her in “With Arms Outstretched.” And then oh my God she pulls him down by his wedding ring on the chain. LORD HAVE MERCY I JUST CAN’T TAKE IT. THE FEELINGS ARE TOO MUCH.\n\nUgh! Moment: I hate being reminded that it wasn’t Nathan who kissed Haley while wearing the batman costume. Bad times, man. Also, Karen should have won the election.\n\nFave Quote: “Haley. Stay with me tonight.” I JUST DIE A BILLION TIMES OMG.\n\nBiggest Question: Do we really believe that Brooke could have made THOSE dresses, by herself, in that short amount of time?\n\nOn My iPod: “For Blue Skies” by Strays Don’t Sleep & “Halo” by Bethany Joy Lenz\n\n3×10 – “Brave New World”\n\nOverview: Deb confesses to Nathan, Lucas helps Peyton find Ellie and Brooke officially launches Clothes Over Bro’s.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI love starting the episode with Naley kisses. With them in bed together. It just makes me so happy.\n\nDan is so fucking creepy. Picking up Haley’s bra? Talking about Peyton? Stealing Nathan’s note for Haley? Ugh. That guy. Gross.\n\n“You called me 17 minutes ago and I DRIVE a bicycle.” I love Mouth. Brooke doesn’t appreciate him enough.\n\nI am glad that Peyton sought out and found Ellie. I love this storyline of hers!!\n\nOn the other hand, I could not care less about Lucas and his friends who are not in Tree Hill.\n\nI hate Dan but Nathan is right, what he screams at Deb. “You don’t have the courage to leave him but you have the courage to kill him?” GO NATHAN. Deb will never win a mother of the year award.\n\nI love that Haley told Brooke to stop being such a bitch to everyone who was working so hard. Brooke really needed to hear that. She was acting like a real d-bag.\n\nBest Bit: I love that Nathan came home from that horrible time with his mom and wanted to see Haley right away. Be still my heart!\n\nUgh! Moment: Lucas really left Brooke in bed to go do something with the girl that broke them up in the first place??? I’m all about Leyton but Lucas can be such a tool.\n\nFave Quote: Ida Scott Taylor once wrote, “Do not look back and grieve over the past, for it is gone and do not be troubled for the future for it is yet to come. Live in the present and make it so beautiful that it will be worth remembering.”\n\nBiggest Question: Didn’t Brooke make those other dresses in her bedroom in like 3 hours? What happened to her magic powers?\n\nOn My iPod: “Sugar, We’re Goin’ Down” by Fall Out Boy & “Halo” by Bethany Joy Lenz\n\n3×11 – “Return of the Future”\n\nOverview: The Ravens are losing, Peyton & Ellie are working on their album and Haley and Nathan try and navigate more rough waters.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nDan is gross. And is so sheisty. Hate that guy so much. SCREW HIM for trying to make problems between Nathan & Haley. UGH!\n\nKEITH!! So good to see his face. SO GOOD. I never realize how much I miss that guy until I see him again.\n\n“Kiss first.” Haley. You are my spirit animal. Never change.\n\nNATHAN! You fucking a-hole. IT TAKES TWO!! Why does SHE have to be in charge of the birth control? DO NOT BE YOUR FATHER’S SON!\n\nDid I mention that Whitey is the best? I wish he could coach all of my teams. They would always win!!\n\nLucas is such a douche. Teasing Brooke about the letters that she put so much of her heart into? Fuck Lucas.\n\nKaren & Keith make me all melty. They are so precious and sweet.\n\nThis argument between Nathan & Haley is so rough. Really hard to hear. But I know it has been played out before. I hate that Nathan is letting Dan get into his head. I hate that he is acting like Dan in how he is talking to Haley. Haley made a mistake.\n\n“Here’s an idea. If you don’t want to be like Dan, don’t.” I love Haley James Scott SO DAMN MUCH.\n\nGO KAREN!! Kiss the HELL out of Keith!! ABOUT DAMN TIME!\n\nBest Bit: Lucas and Nathan finding their rhythm on the new/old court. Just like the old Boston Garden. (I may be Boston biased).\n\nUgh! Moment: I hate it when Nathan and Haley fight but I especially hate it when they are fighting because he is being a jerk. He’s so much better than Dan. He just needs to remember that ALL the time.\n\nFave Quote: after seeing Dan, Whitey: (I thought we killed all the cockroaches.)\n\nOn My iPod: “Concrete Bed” by Nada Surf, “You Wanted It” by MoZella, “Always Love” by Nada Surf & “The Blues” by Switchfoot\n\n(this recap is a re-posting from 2/22/12)\n\nYou guys!!! It’s OTH Wednesday!!! *Happy Dance* *Clapping like a seal* – Not sure I should be this excited though. Do y’all realize that after tonight we are more than half way done with the final season? I can’t even think about it. There is happy to be had though. Tonight marks the return of Lucas Scott in an episode directed by our dear Austin Nichols. It’s gotta be epic right? It will be tough to beat last week’s amazing show though. My favorite of the season so far. Everyone was so on point and the story really moved forward. James Lafferty did an incredible job directing and being tied to a chair. I think I have probably watched it 12 or 15 times already. And I’m not sure I can take many more of Ms. Bethany Joy Galeotti’s tears. They are going to be the death of me.\n\nAs you guys know from last week, I am less of a Dan hater than I was two weeks ago. Begrudgingly. The question remains though: if Nathan lives (*crosses self*) will he forgive Dan? Will he let bygones be bygones? I cannot wait to see how the rest of this all unfolds!! GAH!!!\n\nAre you guys ready for this? Here we go!!\n\nNOT the face I was hoping to get a close up of. Gross.\n\nNathan’s shirt is all wet. It should probably be removed.\n\nAnd baby is brave to boot. BE HOTTER. All screaming and flexing arms. Sorry. I will try to get a hold of myself.\n\nI want to trust this young cop. I want to. He is adorable and seems sweet. But, I don’t know. I can’t trust anyone.\n\nExcept maybe Dan? Which goes against EVERYTHING that I feel. And I am trying to watch this episode but all I can hear is my husband singing, “Dan, Dan, He’s Our Man! If He Can’t Do It, Nobody Can!” Lord help me.\n\nClay is feeling guilty. This is sad. POOR EVERYONE. *sob*\n\nLUCAS!!! I didn’t think I would be excited. But OMG the emotions!! Even with that TERRIBLE hair. My heart swells.\n\nIf Peyton was really getting her way do you think she’d let him have that hair? Let’s be honest now.\n\nHOLY CRAP!!! Did they have a threesome?? I am dying. Chris Keller & Chase cuddle time is THE BEST. OMG FOURSOME!! Cannot stop laughing.\n\nBrooke!! Do not forgive him!! Just talking about Quentin is making me cry so hard. That was the worst. Why does she have such a good heart? That guy sucks.\n\n“Are you Chuck? From the Gossip Girl? No means no!” I die. Too funny. But funny does not mean that you can hit my Nathan. Creep.\n\nAnd now the husband is ROLLING ALL OVER ME AGAIN because he totally called that the drug dealer Quinn & Clay pissed off would be behind Nathan’s kidnapping. And he is also reminding me that Dan will probably be the one to save him. I HATE WHEN HE IS RIGHT!! CRAP!\n\nI like hearing Clay talk about when he first met Nathan and why he decided to represent him. It warms my heart.\n\nDamn it. I said I couldn’t take any more Haley tears. Husband is saying, “Don’t cry! Don’t cry!” It’s almost working. Please tell me I’m not the only one getting emotional over her talk with Luke.\n\nHe’s taking the kids??? That is why he is there?? OMG!!! The tears will not stop!! I was trying to figure out why they weren’t leaving the airport…\n\nI am digging the Dan/Julian banter. They are kind of hilarious, no? Who would have thought?\n\nHaley!! Please stop crying!! Dan!! Please stop playing the video!! It all just hurts so bad!!\n\nClassic Nathan Scott smirk. There is nothing sexier than that smirk. Except maybe choking the crap out of that guy. That is also VERY sexy.\n\nMr. Daniels is not any less creepy. God bless Brooke Davis for what she says to the parole board. Could not love her any more. I wish Haley and Nathan and Lucas could hear her. For Q.\n\nChase leaving actually has me kind of sad. For Chuck and for Chris Keller and for me. I never thought that would happen.\n\nShaking sobs. Haley saying bye to her kids. This is just HARD. So hard. I am ugly crying so grossly. And Jamie hugging Lucas like that. WHY GOD OH WHY!!\n\nHusband caught it before I did. That cop! The one I said I didn’t trust switched out the magazine in the gun. SON OF A BITCH! NATHAN!!!\n\nLooks like Tree Hill has more than its fair share of villains. Including Chuck’s dad. What a dick.\n\nThey let that bastard out???? WHAT THE CRAP??? No way. Brooke Davis is going to have to go CRAZY on that ass hole. No doubt. Can’t wait.\n\nHaley James Scott is my girl. I cannot even believe she is still standing. I want to hug her and bring her tea and kill everyone who has ever harmed Nathan.\n\nHoly crap, friends. Is it me or do these episodes just keep getting better and better? I cannot believe how amazing this was. Even though I pretty much bawled my eyes out through the whole thing. I can only be thankful that my husband is no longer traveling overseas for work for 6 weeks at a time while this airs. If that were still happening there is no WAY I would be watching this show right now. I am feeling for Haley on a level you do NOT even know. The lady is breaking my heart. And it looks like next week will just get worse in that department.\n\nI would like to thank director Austin Nichols for a job very well done on this episode. I am blown away by the talent of this cast. I would also like to thank who ever decided to put Nathan Scott in that t-shirt for the duration. It fits him very well.\n\nWhat did you guys think? Were you excited to seek Lucas despite his homeless hair? Did you cry even half as much as I did? Do you want to hug Haley forEVER? I’m off to chug some wine. That one was STRESSFUL!!\n\n3×04 – “An Attempt to Tip the Scales”\n\nOverview: Tree Hill is celebrating Halloween and everyone is pretending to be someone they aren’t.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nIf I were Lucas, I would have gone with the Captain Jack costume. Or the Ninja.\n\nI sometimes forget what an absolute ass hole Dan Scott can be. When he turns the fuckface meter up to 10, he is AMAZING. At being a fuckface.\n\nPeyton, rising from the floor as the Angel of Death, is one of the most stunning camera shots of the entire series. It’s gorgeous and iconic.\n\nI think it’s kind of adorable how they tried for 3 minutes to convince us that Nathan had another lady in his life.\n\nLOVE, LOVE, LOVE the introduction of Rachel Gattina. So much trouble locked into such a hot body.\n\nWhen Haley runs off, thinking that Nathan doesn’t want her; I DIE. And not in the good way. I want to sob for her. Ouch.\n\nI have so much fun watching Mouth & Peyton’s dance. It’s really so cheesy and set up but I can’t help it. It’s a good time.\n\nLucas & Peyton both make really brave decisions about confronting their fears and their weaknesses. There’s a reason this show is so inspirational to people and these are just two small examples.\n\nI never would have guessed in a million years that Nathan’s perfumed letter & secret phone call were both from Chris Keller.\n\nBest Bit: When Nathan lifts Haley off of the floor and carries her to safety.\n\nUgh! Moment: When Haley gets a kiss from a guy who isn’t who she thinks it is.\n\nFave Quote: “Be careful. His heart’s more fragile than you think.”\n\nBiggest Question: How did Haley not know right away that it wasn’t Nathan kissing her? She should have known, right? Also? How was Deb’s phone glued to her face but not glued to the charger?\n\nOn My iPod: “Invincible” by Ok Go, “Empty Room” by Marjorie Fair & “Dance, Dance” by Fall Out Boy\n\n3×05 – “A Multitude of Casualties”\n\nOverview: Nathan and Lucas are fighting on & off the court, Brooke finds new competition in Rachel and Haley continues to try and win Nathan back. Oh, and Dan’s an ass.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI am pretty sure my high school didn’t have a smoke machine. We also didn’t have late night pep rallies. Or a good basketball team. My high school sucked.\n\n“Damn your sperm, Danny.”\n\n“It was a nice moment, Haley. It’s over now.” OUCH. Can you remember thinking being in Haley’s shoes and thinking he was talking about the kiss? Yikes!\n\nThe official introduction or Rachel Gatina. I think we were all meant to hate her but I loved her right away. I blame Danneel. She’s too amazing.\n\nNathan getting Chris to help Haley with her music is just so sweet and mature and could he be more perfect, please? Though, telling her it’s a test is kind of shitty. Fair, but shitty.\n\nDan & Deb’s battle through Dan’s mayoral campaign is one of the funniest things to ever happen on TV. EVER. “Can you see my ass through this?”\n\nSweet, innocent, little Gigi. Too bad she becomes such a giant whore.\n\n“Where’s Lee Harvey Oswald when you need him?”\n\nLove that Nathan is keeping an eye on Haley. It has to be so scary for him, though. Wondering if history will repeat itself.\n\nBest Bit: Every time Whitey talks. I need a Whitey in my life.\n\nUgh! Moment: Did Dan really have to put Deb’s toothbrush up the dog’s ass? BARFING FOREVER.\n\nFave Quote: Nathan: “My dad just ruined my life, and pretty soon he’ll be Mayor and he can ruin everyone else’s too.”\n\nBiggest Question: Why did Peyton go after the mascot? What did that guy ever do to her?\n\nOn My iPod: “Rock and Roll Part Two” by Gary Glitter\n\n3×06 – “Locked Hearts and Hand Grenades”\n\nOverview: Brooke’s Boy Draft idea comes back to bite her and a few others. Lucas struggles with basketball & Karen struggles with her mayoral campaign.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nDan is so gross. Only babies pee in the pool. And drunk people.\n\nNathan and Haley are TALKING!! And not meanly!! And to each other!! Be still my heart.\n\n“If I wanted to watch cheerleaders wrestle, I’d turn on Pay-Per-View!”\n\nRachel’s legalese bailout of Brooke was bitchin. I could have used her back in my day.\n\nChris Keller is such an a-hole and the fact that I love him so much makes me question my morals. Oh well.\n\nPeyton’s bitchy attitude with Haley is annoying. She was hooking up with Luke while he was with Brooke so she really has no high horse to get up on.\n\nHaley looking out for Luke is really sweet. I just love their friendship.\n\nPeyton and Nathan were TERRIBLE as a couple but they are pretty awesome as friends. Their moments are always great.\n\nBest Bit: Haley standing up to Peyton and then scoring her guy in the draft!\n\nUgh! Moment: All of the girls who are buttheads to Mouth. I want to smack them.\n\nFave Quote: Nathan: “I’m here to talk about Haley and her music. Not Haley and me.”\n\nChris: “You still don’t get it do you? They’re the same thing.”\n\nBiggest Question: Did Brooke forget that Bevin is a hamburger shy of a Happy Meal? Shouldn’t she have guessed that Rachel would manipulate her?\n\nOn My iPod: “Shadowland” by Youth Group & “Boyfriend” by Ashlee Simpson\n\n3×07 – “Champagne for My Real Friends, Real Pain for My Sham Friends”\n\nOverview: The Fantasy Boy Draft has taken place and the boys are demanding dates.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI love the sexy dream montage this episode begins with. Especially Chris and Lucas. Fantastic. Though, the Haley/Brooke dream is pretty hot. Go Nathan.\n\nIt’s okay that I get butterflies every time Nathan and Haley even TALK a little, right?\n\nRachel is so hot. Lucas must really have feelings for Brooke. I totally would have hooked up with her.\n\nKaren and Deb’s entire escapade is HILARIOUS!! I love their friendship and I love the way it turns out.\n\nOkay. Not to put Brooke down, but her “designs?” Aren’t they just typeface on existing garments of clothing?\n\nMouth and Peyton’s “date” is so adorable and heartbreaking. They are just darling.\n\n“I mean, the beach, this balcony. I haven’t forgotten about our past Haley, I know where we got married, I know this is where we made love in the rain. I still feel our past, just like you do. I just thought it might be nice to hang out in the present for a night.”\n\nRachel’s little dance while Lucas is blindfolded is AWESOME. I just love Danneel so much, you guys.\n\nI love that Haley wants to show Nathan her prediction. Most of all, I love that Nathan refuses to read it and instead adds his own. Such a lovely moment.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan’s gift to Haley of their flower and the hug on the rooftop where he wraps his arms all the way around her. Be still my heart.\n\nUgh! Moment: Chris is funny but I cannot believe Brooke hooked up with him.\n\nFave Quote: “The roots are still there. It just takes time. Don’t say I never gave you anything.”\n\nBiggest Question: Why did the foursome go to the Mall? What a terrible place for a date.\n\nOn My iPod: “Tender” by Feeder\n\nRead the rest of my One Tree Hill, Retro Recaps here.\n\nWe’re here!! We’re finally here!! Happy OTH Wednesday and happy Season 3 day! I am so excited to have finally made it to this point. Season 3 is my favorite for so many reasons. Can’t wait to jump in!\n\n2×23 – “The Leavers Dance”\n\nOverview: Season 2 comes to an explosive (literally) end as secrets are revealed and plans are made.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nEllie seemed kinda off right from the start, didn’t she?\n\n“We’re gonna be a family again.” Ugh. Dan. Don’t speak about things you know nothing about. Ass.\n\nI still cannot believe Dan tried to blame Nathan for Deb’s problems. Go Deb. Get away from your dick of a husband.\n\nBrooke in her cheerleading uniform reminds me part of why season 2 is so difficult: No basketball!\n\nI KNEW it had to be a dream between Lucas & Brooke. It was too easy otherwise. Lucas’ cold shower is pretty freaking hilarious though.\n\nI effing LOVE Nathan’s face when Brooke accuses he and Peyton of foreplay. Darling. Hilarious.\n\nI always forget how intense this fight between Dan and Whitey is. Yikes.\n\nGREAT timing Lucas. Tell her right before she leaves for the summer? Nice job buddy. And I am SO sure that is why he kept the Peyton stuff. Yeah right.\n\nPoor Peyton. Now she gets a bomb dropped on her as well.\n\nYou have NO idea how badly I wanted Dan to die in this fire. I actually cheered. It was so exciting.\n\n“Hi.” *SOBBING*\n\nBest Bit: Haley! Haley is at the front door! For Nathan! In Tree Hill!!!!!!\n\nUgh! Moment: “We’re not brothers. We’re not even friends.” I hate it when Lucas & Nathan are fighting!!! I understand why Lucas did what he did but he shouldn’t have lied to Nathan. Nathan already has serious trust issues.\n\nFave Quote: Brooke: “Phantom feelings. Like, when you lose a leg and try to scratch it. Lucas was my gangrene infected amputated limb.”\n\nBiggest Question: Is “WATCHMEWATCHU” on Peyton’s IM Creepy Derek already?\n\nOn My iPod: “The Good Kind” by The Wreckers & “Wires” by Athlete\n\n3×01 – “Like You Like An Arsonist”\n\nOverview: It’s time to find out what happened with the fire and how everyone in Tree Hill spent their summer vacation.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI absolutely love how they set everyone up as the possible arsonist. It was a real mystery that was so fun to try and figure out.\n\nThey’re holding hands!! NALEY FEELS!!! SO MANY!!!!!\n\nDamn it. Dan made it out alive. What a bummer.\n\nOh God!! Poor Nathan!! He’s so angry and hurt. At least they’re talking?\n\nWhat a huge thing for Peyton to find out. World rocking even.\n\nNathan and Haley keep having the most difficult interactions and it’s so painful but I can’t help but just feel thankful that they’re in the same room again.\n\n“Pretty angry huh?” I love the “pain stain.” But what happened to the clown?\n\nS1 NALEY FLASHBACK! OUCH!\n\nBrooke is awesome to invite Haley to move in. “I got room for you but not a lot of pity. You did what you did.”\n\nAnybody else totally think Nathan’s letter was from Haley? Or hoped that it was? Especially after she didn’t sign the annulment papers!!!\n\nDan is kind of scary. And I don’t doubt any of his threats.\n\nThis is probably one of my favorite Codas of the entire series. So beautifully done. And a GREAT surprise at the end. Nathan has his ring around his neck. *SOB*\n\nBest Bit & Ugh! Moment: How can a moment feel so good and hurt so bad at the same time? The hardest part was thinking for one second while they were kissing that everything was just going to be okay. “Always and forever. That’s what sucks Haley. I still do love you. I always will. I just can’t trust you.”\n\nFave Quote: Peyton (voiceover): “At this moment there are 6,470,818,671 people in the world. Some are running scared. Some are coming home. Some tell lies to make it through the day. Others are just now facing the truth. Some are evil men, at war with good. And some are good, struggling with evil. Six billion people in the world. Six billion souls. And sometimes…all you need is one.”\n\nBiggest Question: Where did Haley spend her summer? Where did she live? She wasn’t at the apartment. Did she go back on tour?\n\nOn My iPod: “Feeling a Moment” by Feeder & “Street Map” by Athlete\n\n3×02 – “From the Edge of the Deep Green Sea”\n\nOverview: It’s time for the end of summer party but not everyone is in the mood.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nThe infamous list of boys on the door. This list gets a lot of play over the next few years. Peyton’s face when Brooke points out her dad and Dan on the list is PRICELESS.\n\nNathan is ANGRY. And so hot playing basketball. It’s like early S1 Nathan all over again.\n\nLarry is kind of a great dad. Glad that we’re getting to see more of him. Peyton’s situation totally sucks though. Poor thing.\n\nHave I said yet how great it is to have Haley back? “How about never o’clock, or maybe quarter after stab out my eyes… either one would be good by me!”\n\nKaren is the CUTEST. And I have really missed her and Lucas’ sweet mother son time. What, What!\n\nReal time Naley time!! Their first chat in MONTHS. It’s not sweet but it’s words! Right? And arm porn. Mmmm…..\n\nPeyton’s “music to slit your wrists to” soundtrack is kind of funny. Sad. But also funny.\n\n“Well at least she won’t drown naked.” BAHAHAHA. Haley is the best.\n\nLucas’s speech to Brooke on the beach is pretty sweet. “I’m the guy for you.” How could she say no to that?\n\nPeyton confronts Ellie about drugs and Dan has a revelation. Shit is getting REAL!\n\nBest Bit & Ugh! Moment: One and the same again. Nathan and Haley finally have a heart to heart but everything is left up in the air. JUST MAKE UP ALREADY!\n\nFave Quote: Larry (to Peyton): “I understand you’re upset, but don’t be slamming doors and stomping your little chicken ass around this house when I’m talking to you.”\n\nBiggest Question: Come on. Brooke really redecorated the entire apartment while Haley was sleeping? Sure.\n\nOn My iPod: “Move Along” by The All-American Rejects, “Sugar We’re Going Down” by Fall Out Boy &”When The Stars Go Blue” by Bethany Joy Lenz and Tyler Hilton\n\n3×03 – “First Day on a Brand New Planet”\n\nOverview: It’s the first day of their senior year and it brings with it all kinds of surprises.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nThe roof of Karen’s Café. The brick. The predictions. It’s ok if I cry, right?\n\nSurprise #1! Dan is going after Whitey’s coaching job. Again. God he sucks.\n\nSurprise #2! Ellie has cancer and that’s why she was buying drugs. Not sure telling Lucas to tell Peyton is the best way to go about it though.\n\nNathan & Peyton time is always special. “Really, the only thing I missed was skipping algebra and making out in my car. As much as I loathed kissing you, algebra was worse.”\n\nIs Whitey the greatest or what? Calling Haley Avril Lavigne, setting up the Naley detention. The first one is a wash but the 2nd one is AWESOME! Nathan speaks to her and then almost cracks a smile at her. HEAVEN.\n\nIf some lying druggy bitch was in my room when I got home, I’d have had the same reaction as Peyton. That was rude.\n\nYou know what else is special? Nathan & Karen time. We never get enough of it. “Faith is believing when there’s nothing else you can do. But she’s here now. What are you gonna do about it?”\n\nSurprise #3! Karen comes to Whitey’s defense as coach of the Ravens and they WIN!\n\nSurprise #4! It was Lucas who saved Dan from the fire. Sure wish he wouldn’t have done that.\n\nThe scene of Haley working on her predictions brings SO MANY finale feelings. My heart!\n\nBest Bit: He puts his hand. On her back. In front of everyone. Can’t. Breathe.\n\nUgh! Moment: Nathan says the “D” word to Haley. NOOOOO!!!!!\n\nFave Quote: Brooke: “Sometimes people play hard to get because they need to know the other person’s feelings are real.”\n\nBiggest Question: What is the exact reason all of those bitches are being such slunts to Haley? Because of the tour? Because of Nathan? They suck.\n\nOn My iPod: “Always Love” by Nada Surf & “This Is For Keeps” by The Spill Canvas\n\nHappy OTH Wednesday! So sorry for all of the absences. This summer has been nuts! The good news is that I think I’m done traveling for a while and the other good news is that this is the last full post of Season 2 episodes!!! Praise heaven! So ready for some Season 3 goodness next week!\n\n2×19 – “I’m Wide Awake, It’s Morning”\n\nOverview: Nathan’s uncle Cooper shows up to help him take his mind off of things and then it all comes crashing down.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nCooper insisting on looking at Nathan’s junk really grosses me out. It’s just a joke, right?\n\nDan is such a shit. Just intent on destroying everything he can’t have.\n\nHey!!! Stu-Pac!!!! I love it when they have their little “brotherly” moment. Also, Lafferty Jr.’s shirt is awesome, “That ain’t frosting.”\n\nI love Brooke Davis. “I really don’t miss Felix much at all.” None of us do Brooke. None of us.\n\nDay drinking and a dance party. I could totally be down for that.\n\nIs it just me or is that Daytona chick REALLY annoying? Even before she plays “When the Stars Go Blue.”\n\nI probably shouldn’t, but I die laughing every time I see Deb passed out in the bushes. Hilarious.\n\nGAH! Poor Nathan!! He’s so broken! It just kills me. I probably should hug him. Shirtless.\n\nWhitey is just the best. Have I mentioned that lately? And LOL at his comment about Peyton keeping her door locked or creepy guys will get in. Foreshadowing?\n\nBest Bit: Even though they cause him to crash into the wall, I love the Naley flashes in Nathan’s mind. He can’t stop missing her.\n\nUgh! Moment: When Nathan won’t let Lucas call Haley. How can near-death not put a stop to this nonsense?\n\nFave Quote: Dan: “Well, well. It’s my wife. The lawn gnome.”\n\nBiggest Question: So, did Nathan lose control while thinking about Haley? Or did he crash on purpose?\n\nOn My iPod: “Son’s Gonna Rise” by Citizen Cope & “Like a Man Possessed” by The Get Up Kids\n\n2×20 – “Lifetime Piling Up”\n\nOverview: Whilein a coma, Nathan dreams of what might have been.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nThough not one of my favorites, the episode did do a good job of fooling me in the beginning. Right up until I saw Karen. Then I was just really confused.\n\nGotta admit, it’s kind of fun to see Lucas be the dick while Nathan’s the sweetie. It’s hard to believe that Keith would ever be smarmy.\n\nIt’s nice to see Nathan and Haley in the same place but it sucks big balls that they’re doing that whole friend thing. What a letdown.\n\nNathan’s reaction to Brooke in the shower is just THE BEST! Also, he’s naked.\n\nNo matter what the reality is, Dan is always trying to put one of his sons down and Whitey is always standing up to him for it.\n\nOf course in Nathan’s dream, Haley can’t carry a tune in a bucket.\n\nAlt universe Peyton is a LOT nicer to Nathan than she was in real life to Lucas. Kind of awesome.\n\nIt’s way more believable that Nathan would make the winning basket.\n\nDeb’s on drugs, blah, blah, blah. Gonna get help, blah, blah, blah.\n\nDamn it Nathan for telling Haley not to come! Damn it for saying that you both have to follow your dreams. Damn it for making sense! No dreams! Just togetherness!!\n\nBest Bit: HALEY’S PONCHO!! And their scene at the dock! Is it weird that it makes me sob, even in this alternate universe?\n\nUgh! Moment: Nathan & Haley just friends? Eff that!\n\nFave Quote: Nathan: “Don’t say I never gave you anything.”\n\nOn My iPod: “Hands Down” by Dashboard Confessional & “Rest In Pieces” by Saliva\n\n2×21 – “What Could Have Been”\n\nOverview: Nathan struggles to make ends meet after his accident and help from Dan comes with a scary ultimatum.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nBrooke is pretty awesome. I’m not really into the whole “bring Dan down” storyline, mostly because I knew it would never happen, but I’m glad Brooke is now helping.\n\nWhat kind of hospital billing staff says, “She sounds like a keeper. Don’t let her get away.” Mind your own beeswax biatch.\n\nAnnulment papers!! AHHH!!! Run!! BURN THEM NOW!!!\n\nNathan seems almost cheerful. It’s been so long since we’ve seen a legit smile on his face I hardly recognize it. It’s absolute heaven.\n\nHaley’s manager guy is a dick.\n\nI absolutely LOVE Nathan’s face when he tells Brooke about the shower dream. Half smile, half cringe. So priceless and adorable.\n\nDan trying to convince Nathan that he’s anything other than a giant, douche bag, a-hole is some kind of joke.\n\nPoor Karen. She just wants to talk to Keith. Their situation sucks.\n\nIs Brooke allowed to be upset about Lucas keeping things that remind him of Peyton? Has she never kept anything from an ex?\n\nBest Bit: I completely love Nathan and Peyton’s heart to hearts. They were terrible as a couple but their friend moments are some of the best.\n\nUgh! Moment: Dan going to see Haley with the annulment papers and a bag of lies! OMG I hate that guy! He ruins everything!!\n\nFave Quote: Nathan: “Lucas is THIS close to tucking me in and singing me a lullaby.”\n\nBiggest Question: Did Nathan really sign the papers? Or did Dan forge his signature?\n\nOn My iPod: “Overcome” by Better Than Ezra, “Scar” by Missy Higgins & “Walking with the Ghost” by Tegan & Sara\n\n2×22 – “The Tide That Left and Never Came Back”\n\nOverview: Lucas and Brooke bond during a trip to New York to bring Haley home.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nKaren’s fit at Dan’s dealership is AWESOME!! I wish she would have taken that chair to his face instead of to his window though.\n\nDan is the fucking WORST. Blaming Nathan for Deb’s pill problem? I just want to stab him in the throat with a spork!\n\nAWKWARD!! Walking in on Chris & Haley in a tickle fight? Nice Haley.\n\nI cannot handle Nathan’s sad face staring at the Tutor Center sign. “Sometimes they come back, right?” *sob*\n\nIs it possible to want to punch Chris Keller in the neck while laughing at him non-stop?\n\nI don’t know who stitched Nathan up but pretty sure they did a terrible job. That thing bleeds an awful lot.\n\nHaley! Go home! Go to your home! Are you too good for your home?\n\nPoor Peyton. No wonder she is always crying. Poor girl can’t catch a break. And neither can Jake for that matter. Or Karen. Geez Louise.\n\nBest Bit: Watching Nathan get back to basketball is kind of magical.\n\nUgh! Moment: Nicki showing up at the jail to show Jake that she’s taking Jenny. HORRIBLE BITCH!\n\nFave Quote: Nathan: “As far as I’m concerned, Shaw was a punk, ’cause you know what? Tragedies happen. What are you gonna do? Give up? Quit? No. I realize now that when your heart breaks, you gotta fight like hell to make sure you’re still alive. Because you are… and that pain you feel, it’s life. The confusion and fear, that’s there to remind you that somewhere out there is something better… and that something is worth fighting for.”\n\nOn My iPod: “Hear You Me” by Jimmy Eat World, “How Love Should Be” by Tyler Hilton & “All I Want” by Susie Suh\n\nWelcome back to OTH Wednesdays! Thanks for being patient with my absence as I traveled the country over the last few weeks. While I had a wonderful time, it feels great to be back on the job of recapping one of my favorite shows! And, not only is it OTH Wednesday, it’s also the birthday of both Nathan Scott himself, Mr. James Lafferty and the beautiful Shantel VanSanten!! Happy Birthday James & Shantel!!!! Let’s celebrate all this goodness by sobbing our eyes out, shall we?\n\n2×11 – “The Heart Brings You Back”\n\nOverview: Jake is back for Peyton and who knows who Haley’s sister Taylor is back for…\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI swear to GOD when I thought that first flash to Haley on the bus was real I almost kicked a hole in my TV. Thank the heavens it wasn’t. But she still kissed Chris Keller. Again. DAMN IT. And all the while, her husband is waiting at home with a romantic dinner. DAMN IT ALL TO HELL.\n\nTaylor is trouble from the word GO. Wanted to punch that face the moment I saw it. I have good instincts sometimes.\n\nI think I had always missed the part where Jakes says that Lucas called him for Peyton. That was pretty sweet of Lucas.\n\nI’ve told y’all about my thing with the way James says “comfortable,” right? I just LOVE IT SO MUCH!! It’s like seriously a thing I have that I will never get over.\n\nAaaaaaaaaaand Jake spills the beans about Chris Keller & Haley.\n\nScott brother bonding!! My favorite! I literally laugh out loud every time I watch Nathan launch that ball into the river. And then laugh harder when Nathan tells Lucas about losing the V-card to Haley’s sister. It’s just too damn much.\n\n“Usually I get them first.” Poor Nathan. He is a wreck.\n\nPeyton is SO great. I get Anna being confused and everything but she doesn’t deserve a friend like Peyton. I don’t really care for Anna. I’ve said that, right? And I care for Felix even less. WANT TO STAB HIM MANY TIMES!!!!!\n\nThis Nathan and Taylor thing is a giant mess. GIANT MESS. But it’s good for Nathan right now in a way. He has someone to talk to. I guess.\n\nBest Bit: “Hey, do you need some help?” And then Nathan joins Haley in the kitchen and they share that little kiss. And it’s hardly anything. But at the time, it’s everything.\n\nUgh! Moment: Every time Felix is on screen. That guy is beyond help at this point, no matter how many sweet things he says to Brooke.\n\nFave Quote: Lucas: (voiceover)”Tennessee Williams once wrote…When so many are lonely…as seem to be lonely, it would be inexcusably selfish…to be lonely alone.”\n\nOn My iPod: none\n\n2×12 – “Between Order and Randomness”\n\nOverview: Nathan has a secret to share with Haley but Haley has secrets of her own.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\n“We’re family now, we shouldn’t have secrets.” I am pretty sure I would be just fine never knowing how my brothers in law ever lost their virginity. Gross. Nathan’s recovery is AMAZING! “Whoever my first was wasn’t nearly as important as my last.” PERFECT MAN IS PERFECT!!!!\n\nI love Brooke but I could not be less interested in her crab job story line.\n\nDan is such a sleaze bucket. Haven’t these people learned yet that they should question every single one of his motives?\n\nHALEY IS A LIAR!!!!! Damn it Haley. Don’t be emailing Chris! UGH!\n\nNathan is VERY hot when he’s threatening but it doesn’t seem to be having any effect on Taylor who is a giant slut bag. It must be hard not to hit a girl in his situation.\n\nOh Lord. Poor Nathan. Most awkward convo ever. He’s so brave and adorable. I understand Haley getting upset that it was her sister but can she really hold against him what happened before she came along?\n\nI mostly hate Taylor but I love her for calling Haley out on the Chris stuff. Someone needs to.\n\nOf course Haley forgives Nathan. She really kind of has to after what happened between her and Chris. But either way, it warms my heart.\n\nBest Bit: Haley and Nathan walking along the water, hand in hand, stopping to share kisses. Such a sweet moment. And knowing what comes next, a moment I wish I could trap them in forever.\n\nUgh! Moment: Dinner with the elder Scott brothers. Horrible. Uncomfortable. Cringe-worthy. Dan is really THE WORST.\n\nFave Quote: Nathan: “All right, Haley. We got married so quickly, we never really had the talk that most people have when they get engaged. About past relationships… sexual history.” Haley: “Ah, that’s probably because I can give you mine in under ten seconds, while yours is catalogued in the Library of Congress.”\n\nBiggest Question: “Does this mean you didn’t wait for the ring to give it up either?” “I waited until I was in love.” Is Haley saying that she and Nathan did THAT before they got married? This statement has always confused me.\n\nOn My iPod: “Glad” by Tyler Hilton\n\n2×13 – “The Hero Dies In This One”\n\nOverview: Chris Keller is back in town and Haley must make a choice. Lucas makes a choice of his own that upsets everyone except Dan.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nIf Nathan had to find out about Haley emailing Chris Keller at least he did it in a towel. No reason for it to be ALL torture.\n\nHALEY STOP LYING!!! Taylor is definitely to blame for some of it but NOT ALL OF IT!!! DAMN IT!!!\n\nLUCAS STOP LYING!!! My GOD these people are all idiots. Lying is never the answer!!\n\nDan is such a shit head. His double meaning is hidden in everything he says. What an ass. And he is SO GROSS. Was he really hitting on Taylor? Ugh!\n\nNathan is wearing a Celtics shirt. And wearing it SO WELL. I want it. GO BOSTON!\n\nI love the way Peyton introduces Chris Keller. Hilarious. Like she’s touching something dirty as she says his name.\n\nChris Keller the character is the devil but Tyler Hilton is so talented. I love this song he does so much.\n\nAngry, threatening Nathan is SO HOT you guys!! But I cannot handle his face as he watches Haley watch The Wreckers on stage. He’s so afraid of losing her. OUCH!!\n\nGAH!! Nathan!! She was wrong to kiss Chris Keller! Of course she was! But ultimatums are NEVER EVER GOOD EVER!\n\nThis Keane song makes me cry without fail every time. The flash back to their first time there at the dock does not help at all. This is horrible.\n\n*SOB* Will I ever make it through the end of this episode without bawling my face off? GEEZE LOUISE!\n\nBest Bit: There really is no best bit of this episode. The whole thing is painful. But the live music is great. Love both songs.\n\nUgh! Moment: Must I say it? It just hurts SO BAD!!! The yelling! The fighting! The keyboard throwing! The look on Nathan’s face when he knows that Haley is gone! I JUST CAN NOT!!!!!\n\nFave Quote: Peyton: “A kiss always means something.”\n\nOn My iPod: “When It Comes” by Tyler Hilton, “The Good Kind” by The Wreckers & “She Has No Time” by Keane\n\n2×14 – “Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows”\n\nOverview: Everyone is struggling with loss. Nathan is a wreck after losing Haley and Karen after Lucas has moved in with Dan.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nOh God. Poor Nathan. He’s such a mess. It hurts my soul just looking at him.\n\nErica Marsh is a bitch.\n\nNathan rocking bed head while drinking in class would be hilarious if it weren’t so damn tragic.\n\nJake and Peyton and Jenny are SO DAMN CUTE. I just love them. And whitey babysitting? ADORABLE!!!!!\n\n“You got it right Peyton. People always leave.” Break my heart some more why don’t you?\n\nMouth is the sweetest. I just love him. I would totally vote for Brooke after that speech alone.\n\nDamn it Haley! GO HOME! Or at least call your effing husband! GAH!\n\nBrooke’s scene from the series finale!! SO MANY FEELINGS!!!\n\nI absolutely love, love, love this scene with Karen & Nathan. They never get a lot of screen time together but this moment is so perfect. They are both so heartbroken. It’s so painful but so lovely.\n\n“Sometimes they come back.” Awwww!! Thank you Peyton!!!\n\nBest Bit: Another super painful episode but watching Nathan punch Dan in the face feels pretty damn good.\n\nUgh! Moment: Um, every single scene where I have to see the hurt all over Nathan’s face. IT’S SO DAMN HARD!!!!!\n\nFave Quote:\n\nMs. Hand: “Okay, please tell me you are not drinking beer in my class.”\n\nNathan: “Technically, it’s malt liquor…”\n\nMs. Hand: “Nathan!”\n\nNathan: “It’s okay, I brought enough to share.”\n\nMs. Hand: “Come with me, please.”\n\nNathan: “That’s a nice skirt, Ms. Hand. You know, if more teachers dressed like sluts, attendance in this place would skyrocket.”\n\nOn My iPod: “Flying High” by Jem & “Club Foot” by Kasabian\n\nHappy OTH Wednesday!!! And such a happy day it is!! Not only is it an OTH day, it is also my dear friend Jenna’s birthday!! And not just ANY birthday!! It’s her 23rd!!!!! I wish I had happier episodes to share on her special day but I do think it’s appropriate that Jimmy Eat World’s song “23” makes it’s first appearance within this group. Be sure to find her on twitter (@Jennabeans24) and send her happy birthday wishes. LOVE YOU JENNA!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!\n\n2×07 – “Let the Reigns Go Loose”\n\nOverview: The opening of Tric creates drama and an opportunity for dreams come true.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\n“Can I be honest with you Dan? You’re creeping everybody out.” I love Karen.\n\nNathan going to visit Whitey in the hospital to talk to him about High Flyers is adorable. I still don’t understand how him going to camp would prevent Haley from pursuing music but it’s sweet just the same.\n\nLMFAO at Keith’s face when he sees that Andy bought Lucas a little kid’s shirt. And then Andy calls him “Little Lucas.” Hilarious.\n\nAaaaaaaand Nathan meets Chris Keller for the first time. Then gives him the first of many “I am going to kill you,” glares without Chris Keller even noticing.\n\nTric’s opening night gives me SO MANY FINALE FEELINGS. It makes my heart ache.\n\nOh Karen. “Free round on the house… of juice!”\n\nNathan’s Haley pride is just OVERWHELMING. My heart can’t take it. I want to SQUEEZE HIM.\n\nI feel bad for Brooke and what she’s going through but I feel worse for Mouth. He deserves better.\n\nHave I mentioned how much I hate Felix & Anna? I feel that it’s worth repeating. Blech.\n\nI love that Nathan is already giving Chris Keller the shifty eyes, even before Chris Keller opens his mouth about everyone wanting to screw Haley. He’s no dummy.\n\nBest Bit: Haley’s first public performance and the look on Nathan’s face as he watches her on stage. Her happy little smile when everyone starts clapping? Beyond wonderful. And I could listen to Joy’s voice forever.\n\nUgh! Moment: Nathan laying in bed in the middle of the night, wondering where Haley is. I can feel his anxiety and I don’t like it.\n\nFave Quote: Chris (to Nathan): “You have any idea how many guys in the room wanna nail your wife right now?”\n\nOn My iPod: “Alive and Amplified” by The Mooney Suzuki\n\n2×08 – “The Truth, Bitter Truth”\n\nOverview: Nathan and Lucas take a road trip with a dual purpose and the girls have a slumber party where the secrets come pouring out.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nNathan and Haley cannot be any effin cuter. “It’s our first night apart since we got married.” GAH. I just love them more than words.\n\nBrooke is so gross sometimes. I would KILL anyone who had sex in my marital bed. KILL. With weapons.\n\nI know that it’s bad for Haley to be working with Chris Keller behind Nathan’s back but they sound so damn good together.\n\nI get tears in my eyes watching Nathan and Lucas watch that basketball game. Y’all know why. “That could be you some day.” SO MANY FEELS!!!!!!\n\nI’m glad that Haley knows that lying to Nathan is dumb. She should also know that Nathan wants for what her whatever she wants for herself. It makes me sad that she doesn’t see that.\n\nI cannot handle the way Nathan talks about Haley. “Basketball was the most important thing to me. Now Haley is.” His love for her is SO HUGE. Just thinking about it is enough to make my heart explode.\n\nThat slumber party would be perfect. Perfect for bonding, a perfect memory. There’s even a pillow fight! If only Anna weren’t there. Ugh.\n\nNathan and Lucas are so adorable on their road trip. And that SONG? So funny. When they sing along I DIE!!!!! Love me some Scott brother love.\n\nBest Bit: Haley, Brooke and Peyton all screaming at each other over each of their respective wrongs. It’s pure comedy. Especially when Haley rips off Brooke’s nose strip and Peyton squeals. HILARIOUS!\n\nUgh! Moment: When Haley lies to Nathan about working with Chris Keller. Absolutely NOTHING GOOD will come of this.\n\nFave Quote: Peyton: “Okay. How wasted does one have to be to go home with one shoe? It’s like, at what point do you look down at your foot and say hmmm… ?”\n\nBiggest Question: What would you do? Have the HCM test or not?\n\nOn My iPod: “When The Stars Go Blue” by Bethany Joy Lenz and Tyler Hilton & “Every Ship Must Sail Away” by Blue Merle\n\n2×09 – “The The Trick Is To Keep Breathing”\n\nOverview: It’s the night of the Tree Hill High Formal and a lot of kept secrets will find their way onto the dance floor.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI swear I cannot stop my eyes from rolling every single time Felix talks. He is RIDICULOUS!\n\nCan’t help but kind of implicate Peyton in this Haley & Chris Keller mess. She insists that they play, right away, and doesn’t say anything when Chris Keller says that rehearsal might dip into the Formal. RUDE.\n\nI can’t handle Nathan’s face or his whine/yell. “Hales!?” When Haley tells him that she has to be late to the formal. His heart is already breaking. I don’t like it.\n\nI want to know what kind of budget Tree Hill High has. My school NEVER had the money to create THAT kind of dance. The half Eifel Tower? COME ON!!\n\nShut up Deb. Showing some concern. Right. Next stop: Mother of the year. No doubt.\n\nI think that’s what I’ll name my first album: “Better Than Crap.”\n\nNEVER, in their entire time in Tree Hill do I want to stab Felix and Anna more than when they take turns using “gay” and “lesbian” in order to insult Peyton. NOTHING about it is ok. The two of them were clearly raised by psycho bigots. I would have said raised by animals but I would never insult animals that way. They are just HORRIBLE human beings. I expect it from Felix but Anna? After Peyton went out of her way to make her feel welcome? WEAK AND DISGUSTING!\n\nBrooke is a bit harsh on Mouth. She totally takes him for granted, is oblivious to his feelings and then blames him for Felix’s crap. Not cool.\n\nNathan and Haley fighting causes me actual, physical pain. It’s really unhealthy. For all of us. I may be too invested.\n\nI feel pretty bad for Peyton most of the night but it really comes to a head when a drink gets spilled on her mother’s amazing dress. I cannot even imagine. On top of everything else.\n\nGRRRRR!!!! The whole music vs. basketball camp thing is SO AGGRAVATING!!!!! Why is it a choice between the two? WHY do they keep lying to each other???? AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!\n\nBest Bit: Nathan getting so excited about surprising Haley at the dance. He just wants everything to be perfect for her. He’s nearly giddy at the thought. “I actually have a pretty incredible night lined up for her.”\n\nUgh! Moment: Where do I start? When Nathan has to tell the carriage to leave without them. When he finds out that Haley lied. When they fight at the Beach House. It sucks. IT ALL SUCKS SO MUCH.\n\nFave Quote: Brooke: “Think of all the taffeta that had to die to make this thing. Ew.”\n\nOn My iPod: “When The Stars Go Blue” by Bethany Joy Galeotti and Tyler Hilton & “What You Waiting For?” by Gwen Stefani\n\n2×10 – “Don’t Take Me for Granted”\n\nOverview: Drama abounds after the Formal festivities. Peyton deals with hateful rumors and Nathan and Haley’s relationship continues to take hits.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nThat “Formal on a Sunday” stuff is hilarious. And total Tree Hill nonsense. Like, what?\n\n“Ew. You two realize you’re related, right?… Double ew if Tutor Wife is here.” Brooke is HILARIOUS! And Nathan’s: “Hi, Brooke,” is the most adorable thing. Why is it so cute? Two meaningless words and the boy kills me. I must be damaged.\n\nNathan demanding Haley to stop working with Chris? WRONG. Haley refusing? WRONG. Nathan turning around and walking out? WRONG!!!\n\nI probably should NOT find a threatening, violent, jealous Nathan so damn hot. But I do. I’m sorry. I can’t help it.\n\nJules is trying to tell Keith to get out, away from Dan. Away from her. I wish he would have listened.\n\nKaren: “Oh, grow up. That tragic hero crap only works in the movies. And you know what they don’t show you after they fade out? The hero’s mother putting her foot up his ass.” It’s so great that Karen even scared the River Court boys into not letting Lucas play. Lady has powers.\n\nI absolutely LOVE the statement Peyton makes with her “DYKE” t-shirt. It is strong and brave and powerful and still so relevant. Makes me want to stand up and cheer.\n\nI was HORRIFIED when I first learned that Dan had something to do with Jules and her relationship with Keith. He is a truly despicable person.\n\nJAKE!!!!!! Have never been happier to see his face!!\n\nNathan waiting with a romantic dinner for Haley while she goes to see Chris absolutely tears me apart.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan and Haley’s little make up doesn’t fix the overall problems but I still feel it all over. My heart SWELLLS. Why can’t they always be that way?\n\nUgh! Moment: Chris kissing Haley. OMG SO BAD!!!!! SOOOOO BAD!!!!!!!!!\n\nFave Quote: Lucas: (voiceover) “Nathaniel Hawthorne once wrote: No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.”\n\nOn My iPod: “When It Comes” by Tyler Hilton, “Shoot Your Gun” by 22-20’s, “Sideways” by Citizen Cope & “23” by Jimmy Eat World.\n\n2×03 – “Near Wild Heaven”\n\nOverview: Nathan and Haley let their friends throw them “better late than never” bachelor and bachelorette parties.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI love that Nathan isn’t even trying to stop Tim. He just rolls his eyes and throws his hands up like there’s nothing he can do. It’s adorable. But who he is now is nothing like who he used to be, TIM!\n\nHaley is darling, getting all flustered over the thought of Nathan with a stripper. Poor girl.\n\nOnly Dan could be this manipulative from his sick bed. Wanting Lucas to see those pictures, pretending to be a nice guy. Disgusting.\n\nWhy on earth would Mouth volunteer himself to get things thrown at him and be rolled into things? Also, I want to play.\n\n4 guys sitting around doing Cosmo quizzes. I KNEW this stuff happened. Lucas is the best. “What the hell are you reading?” His face kills me!\n\nOMG Nathan’s face when he realizes who’s on the porno. SO DEAD!!!!! “Tim, is that your mom?” Effing hilarious. I had forgotten how damn funny this episode was.\n\nHATE how awkward and distant things are between Keith and Karen. Makes me sad.\n\nThis episode is full of great faces. Haley’s when the tow truck driver strips off his pants? Priceless!\n\nAnd the faces Lucas and Nathan exchange when Tim gets arrested? LAUGHING SO HARD!! Then when Nathan sees Haley hanging out of the party bus? I could watch those faces on a loop for ages.\n\nYou know what else I could watch on a loop? Haley flying off the stripper pole. Absolutely fabulous.\n\nNathan looks like such a little boy when the stripper is coming on to him. So shy and sweet. So uncomfortable! I Love him.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan stripping off his shirt and telling Haley he wants her. Whoa baby! Actually, I love their entire exchange. From the moment Nathan walks into the room (I never thought for one second he was taking the stripper up on her offer) until Haley tells him, “Honey, you’re gonna love the homework.” So sweet and sexy. Those two are just perfect.\n\nUgh! Moment: That slunt stripper propositioning Nathan in Haley’s house. What a whore!\n\nFave Quote: Haley: “All right. I’m off. All the important numbers are by the phone: police, fire, pimps.”\n\nBiggest Question: Is Lucas actually buying any of Dan’s BS? Is he really that curious about his father?\n\nOn My iPod: “Let’s Get It Started” by Black Eyed Peas\n\n2×04 – “You Can’t Always Get What You Want”\n\nOverview: Brooke gets a new neighbor, Nathan & Haley have a new fight, Peyton tries a new hobby and Dan reverts to his old ways.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\n“Are you writing a song or are you planning on killing me?” Could we just watch them live in domestic bliss forever and ever? I swear it would never get boring to me.\n\nI may actually pee my pants laughing at Nathan’s Dan impression. Keith’s response is equally great. “At least the cardboard one’s polite.”\n\nEvery time I see Felix (barf!) I want to stab him in the neck. Every. Single. Time. Most especially when he hits on Haley and talks shit to Nathan. How hot is protective Nathan though? “A little close aren’t you?”\n\nWhat is up with that guy? You can’t work with him unless you’re a coke head? What kind of sense does that make?\n\n“Don’t hate the player. Hate the game.” WHO EFFING TALKS LIKE THAT?? What a loser! GOD I hate that kid.\n\nLove that ‘Vette tough. Very sexy car. I don’t blame Lucas for turning it down but it must have been a super tough decision.\n\nKeith is THE GREATEST. Nathan really needs a guy like him to look up to. I’m glad he’s standing up to Dan and not letting him back in his life but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t need a father figure. And Nathan is so excited to get to work on the car with him.\n\nI don’t know if there is something wrong with me or what but I totally just cried watching Nathan & Haley make up. The way he reaches out to touch her face, insisting that she keep her gift, THE WAY HE LOOKS AT HER (GOD that look could melt an iceberg), the excitement in her voice when she realizes that it’s hers to keep, the way she throws herself into his arms. They are just too precious for words.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan is SOOOOOO cute when he gets all excited to show Haley her keyboard. He believes in her so much and his smile could light up the universe. It’s all just perfect. Right up until they fight about it. Which leads to:\n\nUgh! Moment: Every time Nathan and Haley fight it’s an UGH! Moment. I can’t handle it.\n\nFave Quote: It’s a tie between two of Nathan’s great retorts while talking to Dan. Dan: “Hey, I had a heart attack. I could’ve died.” Nathan: “Dad, we both know that’s never gonna happen. You can’t jerk anybody’s chains if you die.” And, Dan: “How’s your wife?” Nathan: “Happier than yours.”\n\nBiggest Question: Is there anyone Dan has not tried to buy off with a car?\n\nOn My iPod: “Sway” by The Perishers\n\n2×05 – “I Will Dare”\n\nOverview: Felix (barf!) sets up a dare night for our favorite Tree Hill High kids and tries to get closer to Brooke.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI would NEVER have agreed to do this dare night if Felix (barf!) was the one in charge.\n\n“Well, ya know, in some countries, you can buy coffee without actually having to have sex with the cafe owner. Those countries aren’t nearly as much fun for me, but what are you gonna do?” Andy is hilarious. If Karen isn’t going to be with Keith, I’m glad he’s around.\n\nCan you imagine being the sales woman when Lucas comes to return the clothes right off his back?\n\nI cannot handle Nathan’s face during this scene in the massage parlor. WAY TOO FUNNY!!!! “I’m out.” I bet no one wrapped in a sheet has ever run faster.\n\nCHOKING on laughter at the card that Nathan has to read. “Good evening, Mr and Mrs Tree Hill resident. We’re selling these delicious cookies to raise money for ‘Lady Leprechauns’, an organization that empowers us girls to be strong, beautiful, independent women of tomorrow.” His face in that hat. DEAD! And then Keith sees them as he drives by. I’m crying.\n\nPeyton and Haley at the baseball thing are hysterical!! Peyton get’s slammed in the head with a ball, Haley moves in to check on her and then gets whacked in the back. I don’t know why that’s so funny to me.\n\nI would never, ever in a billion years get into an open grave. Buffy I am not.\n\nI honestly do not remember this conversation between Peyton and Haley in the church about Haley throwing up before the wedding. It makes my heart lurch to think of that moment before she marries Nathan.\n\nI haven’t said anything about Anna & Lucas. Oh, right. That’s because I don’t care.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan in a skirt. Duh. As I told my friend Kristen, baby has some sexy legs!\n\nUgh! Moment: “Dare You To Move,” for a scene that is NOT Nathan and Haley? FOR SHAME!!!!!!\n\nFave Quote: Nathan: “So this is legitimate right? This is like a massage?” Tim: “Dude, shut up! I am concentrating.” Nathan: “Yeah, you know what, I really don’t think I need to be here for this.” Masseuse: “Oh, it won’t take long.” Nathan: “Yeah, I’ll bet.”\n\nBiggest Question: Did really no one see Lucas start to pull those photos out of his pocket? How blind are they?\n\nOn My iPod: “Dare You To Move” by Switchfoot & “Collide” by Howie Day\n\n2×06 – “We Might As Well Be Strangers”\n\nOverview: New kids in town mean new couples. And new opportunities mean new challenges.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nChris Keller!! He’s such an ass. But an ass that makes me smile. I just can’t help myself.\n\nAwww!! Whitey. I sure have missed his crankiness. “How the hell should I know? Do I look like the Post Master General?”\n\nI love that Andy assumes that Lucas is a little kid. Hilarious.\n\nOh Nathan. He’s so worried about being away from Haley if he goes to High Flyers. The stress in his face just breaks my heart.\n\nAnna says that they “beat Our Lady of Peace every year” at basketball. Doesn’t she change schools all the time though?\n\nUm, can I please have Andy’s yard?\n\nI don’t think I ever realized that Keith was the first one that wanted to open a dealership. Probably because I have tried to block out all of his time with Jules. He just seems so happy. And then to remember how it’s taken away. Ugh. I don’t like it.\n\nLucas confronting Karen in the kitchen is so funny. I love their relationship.\n\nDamn it Nathan! Why do you have to be so damn perfect? It’s horrible! You can both have your dreams!! You can!! UGH!!\n\n“Welcome to Tric.” Iconic.\n\nAnd then Nathan’s flash back from the series finale!!! I’m gonna go ahead and cry now.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan and Haley watching the meteor shower together. He believes in her so much and he’s just trying to get her to believe in herself. He’s willing to risk his dreams to make that happen. That’s true love.\n\nUgh! Moment: Nathan lying to Haley about High Flyers. BAD NATHAN!! SO BAD!!\n\nFave Quote: Nathan: “I already know my future. It’s with Haley.”\n\nBiggest Question: Why does Nathan think that Haley can’t have her music if he goes to camp? And why would Haley tell him that she’d only play when he got back? KIDS ARE DUMB!\n\nOn My iPod: “Glad” by Tyler Hilton (I would, of course, have “Let Me Fall” by Bethany Joy Lenz on my iPod if it was available. Grrr).\n\nGreetings OTH Family!! And Happy OTH Wednesday! We have hit the end of Season 1 and the beginning of Season 2. Some of the most important episodes of the entire series. Read, enjoy and don’t forget to leave all of those amazing comments that I love so much!\n\n1×21 – “The Leaving Song”\n\nOverview: Everyone is under pressure as the basketball playoffs approach. Jake deals with Nicki, Haley & Nathan deal with new issues & everyone must deal with Dan.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI love the Scott brother bonding. SO MUCH. They certainly have come a long way in just 20 episodes.\n\nWhitey is always hilarious when talking to Dan but he’s also really sweet. So protective over his team.\n\nPoor Nathan. He honestly thinks that Lucas was the lucky one having been abandoned by their father. The worst part is, he’s probably right.\n\nNICKI IS SUCH A SLUNT!!!!! Poor Peyton. I cannot imagine the panic attack. And the guilt. Jake just cannot win.\n\nI hate this argument for SO MANY REASONS. I can put myself back in my teen shoes and understand all of Haley’s insecurities. At the same time, I now know men and can understand their “needs” as well. It’s a lose/lose.\n\nI absolutely love when Karen stands up to Dan because no matter what snide remarks Dan makes, Karen is always in the right. She is good, he is bad. Period.\n\n“Isn’t this bad for your shoulder?” Nathan is looking out for his brother!! Awwwww!!!!! But damn it Lucas! You couldn’t have moved a few inches to the left and barfed on Dan’s shoes?\n\nOh man. Haley just does not understand the way boys work at all. Poor dear. Lucas is really sweet to go to bat for Nathan though and try to explain it to her.\n\nOk, the Peyton pics are BAD. Nathan is a dumb ass. Why on earth let your GF anywhere near your computer without cleaning some stuff up? Idiot. Poor Haley. She’s really hurt.\n\nUgh. Keith. I feel so bad for him. He has every right to be a little selfish now. He gave his whole life to Karen & Lucas. And now everyone is leaving.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan talking to Lucas about his troubles with Haley while they work out. They’re laughing together, telling jokes, acting like real brothers. It warms my heart. And the fact that Dan hates it makes me even happier. “Porn freak. Just stay away from the sites with farm animals.”\n\nUgh! Moment: Haley & Nathan’s fight about porn. I can understand that at 17 it must be a big deal for Haley. At my age, it’s kind of funny and I’d think a guy was strange if he DIDN’T look at porn. Either way, I hate it when they fight, no matter what it’s about.\n\nFave Quote: Haley: “I was over at Nathan’s and I was on his computer, and I came across all this creepy porn.” Peyton: “How creepy? Like she-male midgets?”\n\nBiggest Question: What was Dan’s motivation behind asking for custody of Lucas all those years ago? Did he honestly have a change of heart? I find that hard to believe.\n\nOn My iPod: “Thrown Away” by Vast & “Suffering” by Satchel\n\n1×22 – “The Games That Play Us”\n\nOverview: Lots of shock and awe for all the Tree Hill residents as the Ravens play their first post season game and Lucas & Keith prepare to leave.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nHave I shared with all of you my love affair with Nathan’s color coordinated basketball themed clothes? I want to build a shrine to them. That’s how much I love them. They are magnificent.\n\nAt this point in the story, there is NOTHING that isn’t abhorrent about Dan Scott. The way he coaches, the way he fathers his sons and the way he talks to every woman in his life. The man is a walking disease.\n\n*SQUEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!* “Because I’m sorry. Because I love you. And because you’re looking really hot standing out here in the rain and I’m thinking I have to kiss you.” Pardon me while I do a ridiculous happy dance complete with giggles and clapping. These two. I CANNOT.\n\nThis scene with Karen and Keith breaks my heart. Mostly because Moira Kelly is the most stunning crier EVER. But also because those two are SO MEANT TO BE and it just sucks that she keeps pushing Keith away.\n\nGO HALEY!!! This part. GAH. Nathan’s look of shock, Haley’s reassurance. SEXY AS HELL. I could watch it over and over. Wait, I have watched it over and over.\n\nWhy on earth would Lucas ask Haley to meet him in the cemetery? That is just weird. And then to break that kind of news to her there? What is his damage?\n\nSo incredibly proud of Nathan standing up to Dan that way. He’s right and Dan knows it. So sexy when he fights back. I want to give him a standing ovation. He’s come such a long way.\n\nWho thought Nathan and Haley were talking about doing it? Raise your hand. Yeah, I totally thought that’s what they were talking about.\n\nNot gonna lie, I kind of thought that Brooke had effed things up for Peyton there for a second. Was pretty stoked to be wrong about that. Bye, bye Nicki. Hate you. Never come back, ever.\n\nBrother love!!! Awwww!!! Just adore those two getting along.\n\nReally Lucas? You couldn’t leave each of them their own note? You haven’t put them through enough? Real nice.\n\nDIE, DAN! DIE!!!\n\nTwo things about this scene in Nathan’s apartment. 1.) Lucas has ZERO right to get huffy with Haley about sleeping with Nathan. Who does he think he is? 2.) OMG!!! MARRIED!! Normally I would think 2 teens getting married was beyond stupid. But this, I allow. For so many reasons. Allow and LOVE!!!!!!! I could seriously talk about it for days and probably will post about it at some point in the future. “We did wait.” The way she giggles, the way Nathan looks at her with SO MUCH LOVE written all over his face? I die.\n\nSide note: If you have not yet listened to the two commentaries for this episode, get your hands on a DVD and enjoy! So awesome! Also, James talked about this episode at the recent ATX Festival and my friend Kristen has the full report. Check it out HERE.\n\nBest Bit: This was a tough decision to make but how could I not go with our very first Naley kiss in the rain? A truly stunning moment.\n\nUgh! Moment: Dan catching Keith shirtless hugging Deb. That will not end well for anyone.\n\nFave Quote: Karen: “But no matter where you go or who you become, this place will always be with you. There is only one Tree Hill. And it’s your home.” A quote that will resonate until the very end of the series.\n\nBiggest Question: What on earth is Haley wearing under her shirt? It’s not a camisole, it’s not a bra. I don’t get it at all. Nor have I ever seen one any place else.\n\nOn My iPod: “More Than Anyone” by Gavin DeGraw and “Run” by Snow Patrol\n\n2×01 – “The Desperate Kingdom of Love”\n\nOverview: All of Tree Hill deals with the fall out of Dan’s heart attack, Lucas & Keith’s departure and Naley’s big surprise.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nThis opening funeral scene gave me so much hope. I really thought that Dan had died. What a bummer to find out that he didn’t. In other news, Nathan looks REALLY good in that suit.\n\n“I had the strangest dream.” How insanely precious are these two? Infinitely sweet and sexy and beautiful together. I would watch 187 episodes of just THIS. Does that make me creepy?\n\n“We’re married now Haley. I’m never gonna hide that.” Hey Nathan Scott. Could you please be more darling? LOVE YOU FOREVER.\n\nDeb & Dan. WOW. They are just the WORST. To each other and to their son. Though “Assiest ass,” did make me laugh out loud.\n\nThis Naley flash back. Not sure there is an OTH scene I have watched more times. Absolutely perfect in every way. She is perfect. He is perfect. They are beyond. I want to cry from the epicness of it all.\n\nIf Dan had actually been given a chance to make that little speech he rehearsed in the car, there is no way Deb would have believed him. Right?\n\nI adore Haley’s parents. LOVE THEM. I also LOVE that they let us think that Marion was Haley’s mom there for a second. Hilarious. As are the front door jokes. And the horny cat burglar joke. And poor Nathan. The awkward faces he makes standing in the kitchen are just priceless. BTW, that white shirt looks DAMN good on him. Holy Moses.\n\nKeith’s reasons are hysterical. “Dan’s an ass. You’re an ass. Your mother annihilated my heart.” Love that guy. His rant about Dan is also pretty phenomenal.\n\nSUPER proud of Brooke & Peyton for deciding not to let Lucas’ letter get between them. It shows growth. Hos before bros.\n\n“I promise you Haley. I will always be there for you. I will always protect you. I will always protect you. Always.” MY HEART!! MY FEELINGS!! I thought about this scene so many times during S9. I wish I could explain why. It’s just so powerful.\n\nBest Bit: The entire scene with Nathan and Haley in bed together. The jerk that Nathan once was, is so far gone now and all because of Haley’s love. She knows that too and it’s why he is able to convince her to marry him, no matter how ridiculous it sounds. Nathan: “Ok, so I’ll say it again. I could love you forever.” Haley: “Nathan so could I.” Nathan: “So then why can’t forever start today?”\n\nUgh! Moment: Deb blaming Nathan for Dan’s heart attack and then telling Haley to shut up. What a bitch. And in a chapel too. Real nice.\n\nFave Quote: The first of many, the epic and iconic: “Always and Forever.”\n\nBiggest Question: This entire episode takes place inside what I like to call the “Tree Hill Space/Time Continuum.” There is no way all of the events will ever fit into a time line that makes any sense at all to anyone. It does not work within the previous episode’s parameters even a little bit.\n\nOn My iPod: “Take Your Mama” by Scissor Sisters, “Empty Apartment” by Yellowcard, “She Will Be Loved” by Maroon 5 & “Lie In The Sound” by Trespassers William\n\n2×02 – “Truth Doesn’t Make A Noise”\n\nOverview: Lucas, Peyton & Brooke throw Nathan & Haley a wedding reception while Nathan’s parents continue to struggle with the news.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nLucas is pretty great with his support of Nathan & Haley and with his party idea. And with trying to be friends with the girls. Must give credit where credit is due.\n\nDan’s “the sky is so blue” thing and all of the nicey nice? My eyes are rolling so intensely that they may pop out of my head.\n\nHaley is so classy and sweet. And Deb is such a bitch in return. UGH!\n\nSorry but I am SO uninterested in Peyton’s Lust Factor story line. Take a hint Brooke. Why would anyone ever be happy about having naked pics of them posted on the internet?\n\nNathan is SO SO SO HOT when he stands up to his parents. “How about you and dad back off and shut up about Haley and me.” Yeah Deb! Take that!\n\nAaaaaaand Haley’s parents continue to be awesome, funny and supportive. Everything Nathan’s parents are not. “We found some hash in the guest room.” “By the way, the dog threw up on Mr. Waffles.”\n\nLMAO at Mouth spraying Skills with cheese and then Fergie scraping it off with a chip.\n\nWhitey’s gift is SO sweet. Not exactly useful at this time but sweet all the same.\n\nHeaven help me. Nathan is already a perfect husband. Standing by Haley against his mother. Comforting her when she’s upset. I get all kinds of giddy when I watch that scene on the steps. They are everything to each other.\n\nBest Bit: Haley standing up to Deb to defend her parents and Nathan loving her more for it. Do not mess with Haley James Scott people.\n\nUgh! Moment: Deb has some nerve saying that Haley ruined Nathan’s life. If anything, she saved it after his parents ruined it.\n\nFave Quote: Mr. James: “Hell, you can drive at sixteen, go to war at eighteen, you drink at twenty-one and retire at sixty-five. So how old do you have to be before your love is real?”\n\nBiggest Question: I don’t want to be this curious but I really am. What in the hell was in that note Lucas wrote to Brooke & Peyton?\n\nOn My iPod: “Float On” by Modest Mouse, “Art” by Louque, & “Everybody’s Changing” by Keane\n\nHappy OTH Wednesday friends!! I just love these days. Before we get started, don’t forget to follow the best Rob Buckley fans on the web: we love @Robaholics!!! Now then, after a batch of some of my not favorite episodes, we are back with the good stuff. Basketball, cheering, fighting, stripping Ravens and three magical words. So excited to share this with all of you!\n\n1×17 – “Spirit in the Night”\n\nOverview: During a road trip for a cheer competition and basketball game, Peyton continues to try to get back into Brooke’s good graces as Haley tries to balance her relationships with Lucas & Nathan.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\n“Psycho hose-beast.” Great Wayne’s World reference. An insult I still love using to this day.\n\nThe scene with Lucas & Nathan makes me think ahead to S6. Nathan comes full circle when he is the one who has to coach a jerk on the basketball court.\n\n“I thought one of you was bad enough.” Poor Keith. I’d like to help him set that Dan cardboard cutout on fire. Right after putting it through a wood chipper.\n\nWhitey is the greatest. All the yelling and insulting and stirring the pot. What a crack up. I’d totally hang out with him.\n\nDo they really take points off for complexion? That seems kind of harsh. And rude. Especially when dealing with teenagers.\n\n“I’ll give her a jazz finger.” I LOVE HALEY JAMES. That is all.\n\nMouth’s amazing cheer routine still makes me laugh. He’s really good! Who knew?\n\nI DIE at Nathan’s face when the male strippers come out on stage. At all the guys’ faces actually. Absolutely hilarious.\n\nIt’s so great that they make you think that Whitey is yelling at his team when really he’s yelling at Karen & Larry. Perfect.\n\nLove, love, LOVE that Nathan calls Lucas out for his dick treatment of Haley. It says so much about his feelings for her. He wants her and he wants her to be happy.\n\nThings are softening between Lucas &Nathan, poor Keith has lost Karen and his business and Brooke is still having a hard time forgiving Peyton. Oh, and Dan is still a huge ass hole.\n\nPoor Nathan, all alone in that empty apartment. My GOD his parents suck.\n\nBest Bit: It’s a tie between Nathan pulling Haley into his hotel room for a little kissy time and when she jumps into his arms after the cheer competition. What can I say? I just cannot get enough Naley love!\n\nUgh! Moment: Lucas telling Haley she looks ridiculous in her cheerleading uniform. SO RUDE. What a jerk.\n\nFave Quote: Haley: “I’m a born klutz; I almost drowned in the ball bin at Chuck E. Cheese.”\n\nBiggest Question: Didn’t Dan drop out of college his freshman year? What right does he have telling Keith to go to college?\n\nOn My iPod: “100 Years” by Five For Fighting and “All Kinds Of Time” by Fountains Of Wayne\n\n1×18 – “To Wish Impossible Things”\n\nOverview: The Ravens basketball team is up for auction and the ladies are willing to pay, not knowing that everyone will be getting a bit more than they bargained for.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI love that each of the basketball players come on stage showing their real personalities. It’s brilliant. Tim is a dunce, Jake is adorable, Lucas is awkward, and Nathan is perfectly cocky.\n\nDear GOD help me. This entire bit with Nathan on the auction block is flawless. The flexing of his beautiful body, Haley’s facial expressions and of course Peyton’s comments. “It smells like sex in here.” And “That’s a creepy threesome.” I DIE A MILLION TIMES. Which is also about how many times I’ve watched it.\n\nPoor Haley. Her face as she watches Nathan & Peyton walk away is kind of horrible. Her vulnerability is written all over it.\n\n“I slipped.” And his laugh. GAH. I cannot.\n\nI don’t know y’all. I love Mouth and Brooke getting to be closer friends, their relationship is so great, but the side by side lap dance kind of skeeves me out a bit.\n\nOMG. Deb & Tim and Dan walking in? PRICELESS!! Talk about WOOPS!\n\nUgh. Lucas. SHUT UP. Quit yelling at Haley for crap you’ve done yourself. Such a hypocrite. But the way Haley explains it to him, how she’s falling for Nathan, how she feels turned inside out by him, it’s just amazing. Her fear and her excitement. She perfectly explains what it feels like to fall in love for the first time. I get butterflies myself just hearing her talk about it.\n\nI HATE NICKI. SHE SUCKS SO MUCH. I just want put her in a canon and shoot her far, far away from Jake.\n\nPoor Brooke. She breaks my heart in that scene in the car. And then she has to tell Lucas her big secret. Horrible!\n\nBrooke isn’t the only one with a bomb to drop. GO KEITH!\n\nBest Bit: Seriously? Nathan strips. Need I say more?\n\nUgh! Moment: Lucas catching Peyton & Nathan kissing. OF COURSE that’s when he walks up. I can only be thankful that he didn’t blab about it to Haley.\n\nFave Quote: Haley: “If I look at this tattoo 20 years from now, and it reminds me of how I feel today, I think I’ll be okay with that.”\n\nBiggest Question: Did Nathan actually come on to Peyton? He tries to play it off, and then kind of admits it, but whether out of fear or stupidity, it still feels like he really did.\n\nOn My iPod: none (much to my surprise)\n\n1×19 – “How Can You Be Sure?”\n\nOverview: Brooke and Lucas deal with the aftermath of having sex while Nathan and Haley deal with the issue of not having it.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nDamn it Karen. You’re making a HUGE mistake!!! TOO SAD!!\n\nHere Lucas, let me shove the stick I just peed on in your face. Poor them though. Super scary.\n\n“I am up.” Yeah Nathan, I’ll bet you are. Looks like everyone is getting a surprise! Nathan does not seem stoked about Haley’s tattoo.\n\nUgh. Nicki. Go die in a deep dark hole.\n\nOh Haley. “You can get a tattoo removed Nathan.” Yeah. With a ton of really painful skin grafting. I can’t really blame Nathan for being confused.\n\n“I can’t breathe when I’m around him and when I’m not around him, I want to be. I’m just… I’m totally in love with him.” Butterflies. AGAIN. As always, Haley finds a way to perfectly express those falling in love feelings. If only I could find a way to bottle them and sell them on the black market. I’d make a fortune. If I didn’t use them all up myself. And even though it should be weird, considering the history, Peyton has been just the right person for Haley to talk to about all of it.\n\nPiss off Dan.\n\nFun fact about me: I absolutely LOVE SO MUCH the way James says “comfortable,” pronouncing every single syllable. He still does it in interviews to this day. It makes me swoon. I am weird.\n\nNow that THAT’S out of the way, I can only imagine how Haley must be feeling, like she’s not enough, like he doesn’t want her. It must be chewing a hole in her.\n\nOUCH. Lucas & Karen. Their conversation (and the slap) is just heart crushing. One of the last things a parent wants to hear from their teenage child.\n\n“Wow. There it is.” As;dklfjspdgjsdpgjspdfjspojdspfj!!!!!!!!!!! SO MUCH CLAPPING AND GOOFY GRINNING!!! I just love them. So much. There are no words to express it. It makes me want to explode from the inside out. Also, the song is PERFECT.\n\nThe Coda for this episode is SO sad. The song does not help. “Everybody hurts.”\n\nBest Bit: Obviously. Nathan and Haley exchanging their first of many “I love you’s.” Is there a sweeter sound anywhere?\n\nUgh! Moment: Lucas & Brooke. The bitter exchanges, the name calling, the lying about a pregnancy? It’s all terrible. Really terrible.\n\nFave Quote: Nathan: “Haley, you got a tattoo for god sakes. It just freaks me out a little bit because obviously this whole thing with us means a lot to you. I just don’t want to do anything to pressure you. Or drive you away. Even though sometimes I can’t help it. Just like I can’t help that I fell in love with you. Cause I did. I love you, Haley. And it scares me, a little bit, but, there it is.”\n\nBiggest Question: What was Brooke’s motivation for lying to Lucas about the pregnancy? Just to make him sweat, to punish him?\n\nOn My iPod: “Heaven” by The Fire Theft\n\n1×20 – “What Is And What Should Never Be”\n\nOverview: Haley throws her first big party and Nathan gets his first job. One goes slightly better than the other.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nFYI, this episode is named after one of my favorite Led Zeppelin songs. Supernatural also has an episode named after it. GREAT tune.\n\nI used to have huge, amazing parties at my first apartment but I never remember it getting that trashed. Maybe my friends were nicer than Nathan’s? I don’t blame him at all for escaping to Haley’s house. BTW, it’s like the CUTEST THING that he just crawls in her window to actually just sleep with her. Makes me all squirmy!!! In the good way!\n\nAt this point, shouldn’t Peyton & Lucas just do it? The damage has been done. Why not get a little something out of it?\n\nBefore “I love you,” Haley’s tattoo really had Nathan freaked out. Now? Do you notice the look on his face when he sees it? Priceless. “Tim, go home!”\n\nI love Brooke but at this point in the show, she’s never really been all that friendly to Haley. Not to mention, she’s currently fighting with two of Haley’s actual good friends. Pretty sure she has no right to be all that butt hurt about the party.\n\nNathan’s pretzels are so sad!! Is it ok that I really want to laugh at him and then give him a great big hug? And how does he make even a pretzel ball cap look so hot? What is up with that? “Isn’t that what they used to call your mom? Hot & Twisted?” Oh Nathan. BE MORE EFFING ADORABLE PLEASE!!!!!!\n\nHave I mentioned before how much I love the Lucas & Keith moments? Lucas really was the lucky one of the Scott boys when it came to father figures. And then Karen and Keith and a baby? Excuse me while I go sob.\n\nI hate seeing Brooke with Nicki and continuing to be such a bitch to Peyton. I understand her pain but Brooke is better than this and it sucks to watch her get so low.\n\nCHICK FIGHT!! Nicki gets in one hell of a bitch slap. Slunt is CRAZY. And Lucas’ slutty secret is spilled. He is so screwed. And this time, not in the good way.\n\nPoor Nathan. He works, doesn’t get to party, his apartment gets thrashed, he gets arrested AND has to deal with Dan on top of it. Thank God he has Haley.\n\nBrooke crawling into Peyton’s bed somehow feels so right. After everything, they have both been crushed by the same boy. And the song by The Cure that plays is superbly chosen. GREAT scene.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan throwing Dan a pretzel from the floor and watching him take a bite. Awesome. Eat mall dirt ass hat!\n\nUgh! Moment: Every time I have to look at Nicki’s face. Have I mentioned that I hate her skanky ass?\n\nFave Quote: Haley: (to Nathan) “I’ll kiss you later.”\n\nBiggest Question: In the very beginning, when they want us to think that Nathan is in bed with another chick, but really isn’t, is that actually James? Or just a really great look-a-like?\n\nOn My iPod: “I Belive In A Thing Called Love” by The Darkness & “Apart” by The Cure"
