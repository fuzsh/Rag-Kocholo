        "text": "6\n\nposted by kellyclarkson12\n\nBethany Joy Galeotti (born Bethany Joy Lenz on April 2, 1981) is an American singer-songwriter, musician and actress.\n\nAs a teenager she honed her vocal skills by training with the Director of The Brooklyn College of Opera and not only plays both the guitar and piano but writes her own music as well. As a singer she has released two independent albums titled Preincarnate and Come On Home (2005) and is best known for her chart topping duet When the Stars Go Blue and video release of Songs in My Pockets. Deemed a triple-threat, Galeotti now boasts stage credits that include collaborating with Garry Marshall and Carole King on a new musical as well as working with director Arthur Allan Seidelman on a production of The Outsiders.\n\nAs an actress, she is best known for her roles as Michelle Bauer Santos on Guiding Light (from 1998 to 2000) and as Haley James Scott on One Tree Hill (since 2003).\n\nContents [hide]\n\n1 Early life\n\n2 Career\n\n3 Personal life\n\n4 Filmography\n\n4.1 Television\n\n4.2 Appearances\n\n4.3 Stage\n\n4.4 Cinema\n\n4.5 Music videos\n\n5 Critical acclaim\n\n6 Awards\n\n7 Discography\n\n7.1 Preincarnate\n\n7.1.1 Track listing\n\n7.2 Come On Home\n\n7.2.1 Track listing\n\n7.3 The Starter Kit\n\n7.3.1 Track listing\n\n7.4 Mission Bell\n\n7.4.1 Track listing\n\n7.5 One Tree Hill: Volume One\n\n7.5.1 Track listing\n\n7.6 Friends with Benefit\n\n7.6.1 Track listing\n\n7.7 Songs from One Tree Hill Tour (2005)\n\n7.8 Songs from One Tree Hill\n\n7.9 Songs from Ten Inch Hero\n\n7.10 Miscellaneous Songs\n\n8 References\n\n9 External links\n\n[edit] Early life\n\nBethany Joy Galeotti (formerly Lenz) was born on 2 April 1981 in Hollywood, Florida. Galeotti is an only child to her father, Robert Lenz, a history teacher and therapist, and mother, Cathie, a personnel manager and entrepreneur.[1]\n\nGaleotti's first solo singing performance was at the age of 3, in front of a crowd of three thousand people at the The Carpenter's Church in Lakeland, Florida. At the age of four, Galeotti and her family moved to Arlington, Texas. While attending Pope Elementary there, she was bitten by the acting bug. Immediately after, she performed a twenty minute soliloquy part in High HopeS and Heavy Sweatshirts. This was performed in a very intimate setting in a Dallas museum. She then landed her first stage role at age seven, playing a Munchkin in a local production of The Wonderful Wizard of Oz.\n\n[edit] Career\n\nAt the age of 10, Galeotti landed the role of Scout in To Kill a Mockingbird at the Irving Community Theater in Texas. During a trip to Los Angeles with her drama school she landed her first professional job in a commercial for Swan Crossing, a teen series. Subsequently Galeotti performed in plays such as Annie, Cinderella and Gypsy: A Musical Fable.[2]\n\nWhen she was 13 Galeotti moved with her family to New Jersey and attended the Hawthorne Christian Academy for a year. She immediately began auditioning and became a commercial veteran, appearing in commercials for Eggos Waffles and Dr Pepper. It was at this time that she still going by the name Joy Lenz changed it to Joie Lenz, which was used as her stage name. 'Joie' is 'Joy' spelled in French with an English pronunciation.[3]\n\nAt age 15 during her sophomore year in high school, Galeotti appeared in her first film, Stephen King's Thinner. Her performance was well-noted in reviews particularly in the Associated Press: \"One of the highlights of the film was a joy — Joy Lenz.\"\n\nIn March 1998 at 17, Galeotti earned a nine episode gig in CBS's soap opera Guiding Light where she first appeared as the teenage clone of Reva Shayne. Galeotti made such an impression on viewers, critics and Guiding Light executives alike that she was later recast as Michelle Bauer Santos upon Rebecca Budig's exit.[2] This was an unusual move and \"unheard of\" in the industry according to CBS producer Mickey Dwyer-Dobbin.\n\nLenz and Stewart as Michelle and Danny.In November 1998, Galeotti began acting in one of her most popular roles to date, as Michelle Bauer Santos. While working on the demanding daytime serial Guiding Light, she graduated from Eastern Christian School in New Jersey in 1999 and landed the role of Rose Cronin in Mary and Rhoda. She also appeared in the off-Broadway musical Foxy Ladies Love/Boogie 70's Explosion.[4]\n\nAt the time she was juggling a heavy storyline, a television movie, portraying Mary Tyler Moore's daughter, a one-year run of a New York cabaret and the lead in an independent film. Galeotti was then cast as the lead in a much-anticipated WB pilot which unfortunately never went into production. She also filmed two other pilots: one playing the daughter of Paul Sorvino, and one as the lead in the WB's 1972.\n\nIn October 2000 at the end of her two year contract with Guiding Light, Galeotti chose to leave her popular role. Since then, she had a co-starring role in the independent film The End Of August. She then moved from New York City to Los Angeles where she performed in a theater production of The Outsiders, and also guest-starred on many shows such as Off-Centre, Charmed, Felicity, Maybe It's Me and The Guardian.[2]\n\nIn 2002 Galeotti joined the cast of Bring It On Again where she turned in an unforgettable performance as Marni Potts.[5] During this time, Galeotti was also featured in Interview Magazine's \"Stars On The Rise\" in January.\n\nIn 2003 at age 22, Galeotti was cast in the WB's television series One Tree Hill as Haley James, the quintessential girl-next-door, who is best friends with Lucas Scott, portrayed by Chad Michael Murray, and Nathan Scott’s wife, portrayed by James Lafferty.[6] Upon entering the role of Haley James, Galeotti replaced actress Samantha Shelton's character, Reagan. Approximately around the same time in which she was cast as Haley James she once again used her original name Bethany Joy Lenz.\n\nGaleotti has proven herself not only as a talented actress, but as a musician and a singer. She has a four-octave range,[2] and since her exit from Guilding Light has completed a demo of original music and continues to write screenplays.\n\nGaleotti has recorded two independent records to date. Her first album, entitled Preincarnate, was released in October 2002. Bethany Joy Galeotti and costar Tyler Hilton joined The Wreckers (Michelle Branch and Jessica Harp) for a 25-city North American One Tree Hill tour that started February 28 in Vancouver. The jaunt also featured Gavin DeGraw on select dates. While on tour Galeotti performed original songs from her second independent record. Her second album, Come On Home was sold at the concert venues. During her time off tour Galeotti filmed a video for her song Songs in My Pockets, at Coney Island Beach and Astroland in Brooklyn, New York.Galeotti and Hilton also scored the #89 spot on February 2005's Billboard Pop 100 chart with the duet \"When the Stars Go Blue.\"[7] In addition to the One Tree Hill tour, Galeotti also performes her own rendition of the National Anthem at various charity events, including James Lafferty's Annual Basketball Games.\n\nGaleotti as Haley James Scott performing at Tric. (episode 3.15).In 2006, under the name Haley James Scott, Galeotti recorded the well-known song Halo, which was released in the second volume of the One Tree Hill Soundtrack. At this time alongside her producer Ron Aniello (Lifehouse, Guster, Barenaked Ladies) Galeotti recorded original material for an album with Epic Records. Due to changes within Epic Records, Galeotti is no longer affiliated with them.[8] Consequently, Galeotti collaborated with Garry Marshall and Carole King on a new musical as well as working with director Arthur Allan Seidelman on a production of The Outsiders. In 2006, she wrote and recorded several songs for the soundtrack for Ten Inch Hero.[9]\n\nGaleotti has recently collaborated with Enation for a newly recorded version of the song Feel This. Bethany Joy Galeotti sings the lead vocals while Enation plays the music behind her on the finale of the 5th season of One Tree Hill on CW. The airing led to an excited response, helping make Feel This the #1 Top Seller on CD Baby, one of the largest independent music outlets in the world. Feel This is also included in the two song single album that is available on iTunes for downloads. Galeotti is set to make her debut as director of an episode of One Tree Hill this season.[10]\n\nIn the October 20th episode of One Tree Hill entitled \"Messin' With The Kid\", Galeotti's character Haley James Scott encounters a street performer played by Grace Potter. Ambitious to reestablish her music career Haley decides to sing with Potter's character in the riverfront. In the ending montage of scenes, Galeotti and Potter's characters perform the hit single I Want Something That I Want.\n\nBethany Joy Galeotti and musical acts Angels & Airwaves and occasional One Tree Hill guest star Kate Voegele teamed up with the USO for a live concert event for military personnel. The event also included Galeotti's husband's band Enation, and music partner Amber Sweeney who accompanied Galeotti on stage to perform Galeotti's hit single Feel This and song entitled The Sweetest Thing. The duo also performed their single written for troops, Home Is Me - You Are Mine.\n\nThe USO concert was filmed and formed the basis for a One Tree Hill episode originally aired on November 10th, 2008. In the episode titled Even Fairy Tale Characters Would Be Jealous Galeotti's character Haley James Scott's friend Peyton Sawyer produces a massive USO concert at the military base where her brother is stationed.[11]\n\nNotably Galeotti as character Haley James Scott will sing songs featured on this EP in the episode set to air November 17th 2008 titled We Three (My Echo, My Shadow and Me). In this very special episode Chad Michael Murray pens a homage to the classic films of the 1940s. Karen's Café is transformed into a glamorous nightclub with Lucas (Chad Michael Murray) as its proprietor and Haley as the cabaret singer.[12]\n\n[edit] Personal life\n\nOn December 31, 2005, Bethany Joy Lenz married Enation band member Michael Galeotti. For the fifth season finale of One Tree Hill, Michael Galeotti, the keyboardist of Enation, joined his wife to record a new version of Feel This.\n\nOn November 5th, 2008, Galeotti and close friend Amber Sweeney began a group named Everly located in Battle Ground, Washington. Together the duo released Mission Bell an EP consisting of three songs entitled, Home Is You - You Are Mine, Stars and Little Children. Everly released a statement describing their group to be a:\n\nbirthed of a friendship and a sisterhood that's been many years in the making, and we are proud to present this short collection of music as a \"teaser\" for what is to come.\n\n[13]\n\nBethany Joy Galeotti loves photography, painting, cooking, and horseback riding. She has many dreams that include attending college, movie roles, Broadway, and training at London's prestigious Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts. When she is not filming One Tree Hill in Wilmington, North Carolina, she lives with her husband Michael Galeotti in Battle Ground, Washington.\n\n[edit] Filmography\n\n[edit] Television"
