        "text": "Do you know anyone who has ever built a vacation around visiting a location where a movie was filmed? If you knew me, you could say yes. In 2009, I finally made my pilgrimage to Dyersville IA to visit the Field of Dreams set. We couldn't go into the house, but tourists could play baseball on the diamond next to the cornfield.\n\nBut if you want to take a smaller trip but still satisfy this particular need, Tennessee has the answers. Many films have been shot in the Volunteer State, so I rounded up 10 locations that will put you right in the heart of where the action was.\n\nCentennial Park and the Parthenon - Nashville\n\nRobert Altman's classic drama Nashville featured several characters in the country and gospel music industry as well as politics. The sprawling epic culminated at a political rally for a presidential candidate. Music City's Centennial Park and the Parthenon are featured prominently. In fact, this concert scene was shot ON the steps of the Parthenon.\n\nThe Ryman Auditorium - Nashville\n\nMost people aren't visiting the Ryman because it's where scenes from a classic movie were filmed. But if you're there, you're where Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones awaited their cues during the shoot for Coal Miner's Daughter. The Ryman is where all that movie's concert scenes were filmed.\n\nMud Island - Memphis\n\nOne of Tom Cruise's biggest hits was the adaptation of John Grisham's The Firm which is set in Memphis. In addition to multiple locations downtown--including the historic Peabody Hotel--Mud Island River Park and the gondola that transports tourists to and from the attraction figure prominently in an action sequence late in the film.\n\nThe Client is another Grisham adaptation that was filmed in Memphis, as was the Johnny Cash biopic Walk the Line.\n\nTennessee State Prison - Nashville\n\nTennessee prisons have frequently been used as settings for Hollywood filmmakers. And since the The Green Mile is one of the all-time great prison movies, I can see where fans might want to take a look. And a LOOK is about all you'll get; the prison has been closed for decades.\n\nMorristown TN\n\nLegendary director Sam Raimi utilized this small Tennessee town to film his equally legendary horror film The Evil Dead. Fans have made trips to see the old cabin from the movie, even if there isn't much left of it.\n\nBristol Motor Speedway\n\nHow about a little irony? Nicole Kidman lives in Nashville with her husband Keith Urban and met her FIRST husband, Tom Cruise, on the set of the NASCAR blockbuster Days of Thunder which was partially filmed at Bristol Motor Speedway.\n\nDyersburg TN\n\nIf you can find someone who was in this west Tennessee town when the 1968 Best Picture Oscar winner In the Heat of the Night was filmed, more power to you. Fifty-six years is a long time. But if you CAN, I'm sure there will be stories. For now, though, zip through to the 16:00 mark. That's where you'll find the scene at Endicott's Plantation in Dyersburg.\n\nOkay, movie fans, start your engines. You now have a themed road trip to pack for, and you don't want to be late."
