There’s not a lot of publicly available information regarding Galeotti’s personal life.\n\nMichael Galeotti: Early Life\n\nOn August 28, 1984, Michael Galeotti was born in Manchester, Missouri, to Mike and Sheila Galeotti. His parents came from a middle-class background and worked in regular occupations. Galeotti was a superb musician who could play the guitar and piano. He was brought up in a Christian home and was proud of his Belgian-American ancestry.\n\nMichael Galeotti Career\n\nGaleotti made his acting debut in the comedy series “The Jersey” on the Disney Channel in 2004.

By 2012, Jonathan Jackson, Richard Lee Jackson, Jonathan Thatcher, Daniel Sweatt, and Galeotti were all part of the Battle Ground, Washington, band. Galeotti was involved with the team until 2012.

But that was not how reality was at all. After six years of marriage, Gelotti’s alcoholism escalated to a serious problem, resulting in many arrests and aggressive conduct. Lenzi reportedly left him because of his drunkenness and the violence it brought about. Lenzi, who announced their split on her blog, said she was sorry about the choice to break their marriage, but they would still be friends and co-parent their daughter. The ex-wife of Galeotti was given full custody by the court.\n\nFollowing the divorce\n\nBethany Joy moved to Los Angeles and was granted full custody of their daughter. Galeotti, on the other hand, turned inside and turned away from supporters and the press.\n\nMichael Galeotti: Social Media\n\nGelotti and his wife Bethany Joy Lenzi were frequent users of several social networking sites before their divorce. But after splitting up with the band and leaving social media, it appears Galeotti stopped using most of them. According to some reports, he may have removed or deactivated his accounts to concentrate on his personal life following the separation.\n\nMichael Galeotti: A Tragic End for a Talented Musician\n\nBefore passing away suddenly at the age of 31, Michael Galeotti, a gifted musician and former member of the band Aneshnation, had some health problems. He suffered from high blood pressure, diverticulitis, and excessive cholesterol, which forced him into the hospital just one week before his passing. Despite being released, he was discovered dead not long after, most likely taking his own life due to his chronic alcoholism. Autopsy findings, however, indicated he had no illegal drugs in his blood, suggesting atherosclerotic heart disease was the cause of his death.\n\nAfter his passing, Bethany Joy Lenzi, Galeotti’s ex-wife, sent a statement expressing her sorrow and recalling him as a gifted artist who was extremely enthusiastic about the arts and music. Social media was used by friends, fans, and fellow artists to share memories of Galeotti and offer condolences.\n\nThe world lost a talented musician, and his untimely death serves as a reminder that addiction and health-related complexities can affect anyone…Read more\n\nFrequently Asked Concerning Michael Geltz\n\nWhy was Michael Geltz known in the entertainment industry?\n\nMichael Geltz was known as the keyboardist for the indie rock band Enation and for his role in the Disney Channel series “Jersey”.\n\nWhen did Michael Geltz pass away and what was the cause of his death?\n\nMichael Geltz passed away on January 11, 2016, at the age of 31.
