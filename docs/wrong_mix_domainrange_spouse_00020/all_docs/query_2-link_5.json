        "text": "Lyz Lenz is a midwestern mom on a mission to liberate women from the inequality inherent in marriage. In 2018, the Iowa-based journalist and author penned an essay for Glamour titled, “I’m a Great Cook. Now That I’m Divorced, I’m Never Making Dinner for a Man Again.” The article went viral, and countless women reached out to tell her how miserable they were in their marriages. So many women wanted to know, “When is the time to make my happiness a priority?”\n\nHer answer? Now. It might not be easy, but it’s worth prioritizing yourself now.\n\nIn her third book, This American Ex-Wife: How I Ended My Marriage and Started My Life, Lenz combines memoir with reporting, history, and sociological research to argue that modern marriage is built on inequality and that our society relies on the unpaid labor of women instead of providing a true social safety net. She also offers a solution: divorce. A word that still carries negative connotations, even in progressive circles—but she’s out to change that.\n\nThis American Ex-Wife: How I Ended My Marriage and Started My Life by Lyz Lenz\n\nCrown, hardcover, 288 pp., $28, penguinrandomhouse.com/books/704120/this-american-ex-wife-by-lyz-lenz\n\nLyz Lenz in conversation with Laura Danger\n\nWed 3/6 7 PM, Women & Children First, 5233 N. Clark, womenandchildrenfirst.com/event/person-american-ex-wife-lyz-lenz\n\n“This book is not gentle divorce apologetics but a full-throated argument in favor of it—and the freedom that comes from having the courage to fight for your life rather than lose yourself in it,” Lenz writes in the opening chapter.\n\nWhen I interviewed Lenz, her wicked sense of humor and her passion for helping others find freedom came through over Zoom as delightfully as they do in her writing. What follows is an edited version of our conversation.\n\nEmily McClanathan: Why did you decide to write a book about your experience of divorce?\n\nLyz Lenz: It wasn’t really until the shutdown of 2020 when I was watching all my friends in these marriages, all of a sudden without schools, without the ability to bring their parents in to help them out. And their well-meaning husband was locked in the home office doing his Zoom work while the wife was homeschooling and doing her own job. People would say to me, “How are you doing as a single mom?” And I’d be like, “Great, actually.” Great, because my kids can go to their dad’s house, and I actually have space and time and equality in a way I never had before.\n\nSo going through that and being a journalist, I was reading all those statistics and studies and all these op-eds from women being like, “We are dying. We’re drowning.” The sociologist Jessica Calarco, from Wisconsin, who’s coming out with a wonderful book too, she was saying, “We don’t have a social safety net. All we have are wives and mothers.”\n\nAll of that made me think, I want to talk about this. And I want to talk about this in a way that’s deeply personal and offers a solution, because I think so often the news cycle is like, “Women are mad and sad and overworked. Guess we can’t do anything about it!” And I wanted to be like, no. There’s something you can do about it that’s not just calling your reps and asking for universal childcare or healthcare. You can walk. You can change your life. Your equality is something that you can find and advocate for right now in this second. I’m not trying to say it’s easy, but it is something that you can do. That’s why I wanted to write this book. Then I sold it in early 2021, and it just feels like every time I talk about it, something else happens in the news that makes it even more timely.\n\nCould you elaborate on the argument that our society relies on women’s labor instead of providing a real social safety net?\n\nBasically, I try to separate the idea of relationships, which are beautiful, wonderful, and have existed since the dawn of time—people want to be in relationships together, no matter what those look like—and the modern institution of marriage, which is a legal system that we have based our entire tax base around. It is the metonymy for our social order. It is like the nuclear unit of our society is “marriage.”\n\nAnd it is a modern institution. I joke in the book—[when] people say, “Biblical marriage,” [for] those early patriarchs, it wasn’t one man, one woman, in a home in the suburbs with a “Live, Laugh, Love” sign. It was five, seven wives in this big nomadic community. It was Adam, Eve, Lilith, Janice—whoever Adam’s other wives were, right? Canonically, Janice. [Laughs.]\n\nBut when we look at the way that the legal institution of marriage was developed, it’s basically built on the idea that a woman is subsumed under the laws of coverture, so she becomes a legal nonentity. If you say, “Well, that was just so long ago.” No, it wasn’t, because it wasn’t until the 90s that we even made marital rape illegal. There’s nothing that says you are a piece of property more than making it legal for you to be raped in your marriage.\n\nI think that we really need to understand that the way that our society has developed marriage is based on the unpaid labor of women for childcare, for healthcare, because who’s taking care of aging parents? Who’s taking care of children? Who’s doing all this kind of stuff? This is how we’ve built our society, and I don’t think that that’s a good system to have a relationship in.\n\nIn the book, you also talk about your religious background and how it affected your experience of marriage. How do religion, patriarchy, and purity culture intersect to impact marriage?\n\nI think sometimes, if perhaps you live in a bigger city or you weren’t raised this way, you might want to pretend that religion doesn’t impact how you operate or how we see our society, but I really believe that we still have these deeply religiously entrenched ideas of what marriage is and what a successful marriage is. I talk a lot about growing up deeply conservative. I’m the second oldest of eight kids, and we were homeschooled in Texas. So, I thought I was such a feminist for waiting until I graduated from college to get married.\n\nI think when you come out of that kind of a system, it’s so easy to see how that system still influences, because you can find the most liberal person in the world who will still call a divorce a failure. Why do you think that? Why do we think that marriages have to last forever? Why can’t a good relationship know its ending point, just like a good TV show? I think that we really need to let go of those deeply entrenched religious ideas of what makes a good relationship—what makes a good, happy home and happy family—so that we can build something new.\n\nObviously, women are a target audience of your book. Do you hope that men read it, too? If so, what do you hope they take away from it?\n\nThe goal of my work is women’s liberation and gender normative liberation because my definition of women is anybody who identifies as a woman. I’m trans-inclusive in my definition of women. I really try hard to set that up in the first chapter of the book—to say, I understand there are other ways, but I do believe that this binary trap traps us all, no matter our sexuality. The goal of my work, and what I hope the goal of my work always is, is to liberate us from that binary and that gender trap, and to find newer ways.\n\nI believe that when we’re free, we’re all free. I don’t believe my liberation is a man’s alienation. I believe we all benefit when women are free, and statistically, that is shown to be true. There are studies out there that say, in societies where women have access to reproductive rights and easy divorce, relationships last longer. Women earn more money. Children stay in school longer. Domestic violence rates drop. So, I believe that women’s liberation is better for all people. That’s the goal of my work.\n\nShould men like to come along? Absolutely. But I am so done negotiating for my freedom. I am so done trying to make men feel better and get them on board with my freedom. Join in or don’t, but I am not here to make you comfortable, sir, because you’re not doing that for me.\n\nYour sense of freedom and joy really comes through in the book. What is one of the best things about being an ex-wife, in your experience?\n\nSo many good examples. There’s a store in town that deals with midcentury modern stuff, and I love this store. A couple of weeks ago, [the owner] had this piece of art—a metal sculpture, a really popular midcentury thing—and he was selling it for $100. I’ve seen this sell for $500 before, so I messaged him on Instagram to hold that for me, please. I go in to get it, and he’s like, “You were not the first one who wanted this. I had two other women come in and they wanted it, but their husbands wouldn’t let them.”\n\nI was like, “Here is my money, take it.” And I brought it home, and now it’s over my bed. But I was that woman before. I was with that guy who’s like, “If you spend over $100, I need to know.” I feel bad—not in a condescending way and not in a judgmental way—but I know what it’s like to be there, and I’m so happy I’m not there anymore. I’m so happy I have that piece of art over my bed and that I didn’t have to have a fight about it. It’s just those little freedoms that really mean so, so, so, so much."
