That's a LOT of filler episodes. And when staleness DOES happen, there are several ways that showrunners can attempt to inject new life into it. One of those methods is a smartly-used time jump.\n\nA \"time jump\" in this sense is any significant stretch of time that passes, between seasons or episodes. Usually, within a jump, there has been a notable event (or events) that change the course of the series or set off a new plot. When used correctly, they can make the introduction of new characters more seamless or skip over a chunk of time that may be difficult (or boring) to show onscreen.\n\nTake, for example, \"The College Years\" in any series that began in high school. Doing college storylines on a show that has previously been set in high school rarely goes well (unless you're ABC's TGIF classic Boy Meets World). Several recent high school dramas have chosen to forego college years altogether, skipping over them with a time jump and picking up with the characters as graduates.\n\nOf course, a show can opt to introduce a time jump for any number of reasons. Used near the end of a series rather than in the middle, a time jump can be a way to provide a well-rounded sense of finality, giving us a glimpse into the futures of the characters we have grown to know and love.\n\nCheck out our list below, with 11 of the best TV time jumps EVER!\n\nAgree? Disagree? Have a favorite TV time jump that we left out? Hit the comments and let us know what your favorite time jumps are!\n\n1. Parks and Recreation\n\n2. Fargo\n\n3. One Tree Hill\n\n4.

Often men would help out by sitting next to him, thus protecting the women.\n\n\"Sometimes we wouldn't luck out and he'd just squeeze his disgusting body in between us and put his arms around us, grinning.\n\n\"He pet hair. He massaged shoulders,\" the writer reveals. \"I know he did more but not to me so they're not my stories to share.\"\n\nThere was even speculation that Schwahn sent naked pictures of someone associated with the show around. So, this is a horrible, horrible story.\n\nThe One Tree Hill cast and crew have made a united front, and are sticking together to support Audrey.\n\nHave a look at some of their reactions to the news below.\n\n1. Hilarie Burton\n\n2. Sophia Bush\n\n3. Torrey DeVitto\n\n4. James Lafferty\n\n5. Austin Nichols\n\n6. Karen Gist\n\nView Slideshow\n\n↧\n\nMark Schwahn Suspended by E! Amid Sexual Harassment Allegations\n\nIt was just a few days ago that the cast and crew of One Tree Hill hit out at series creator Mark Schwahn for alleged sexual harassment behind the scenes on the hit WB/CW drama series.\n\nMark moved on to create The Royals for E! after that teen drama concluded, and the show has wrapped production on Season 4 which is slated to debut in the next few months.\n\nNow, it has been confirmed that E! and producers Lionsgate Television have decided it is in their best interests to suspend Mark amid the swirling allegations as the companies investigate what went on.\n\n“E!, Universal Cable Productions and Lionsgate Television take sexual harassment allegations very seriously, investigate them thoroughly and independently, and take appropriate action.\n\n\"Lionsgate has suspended Mark Schwahn from The Royals as we continue our investigation,” the companies said Wednesday in a statement.\n\nIt's unclear whether Mark will return to the show which was the first foray into scripted programming for E! or if the plug will be pulled on the show entirely.\n\nA statement was also released by The Royals star, Alexandra Park on Wednesday in which she confirmed she and her colleagues had witnessed the behavior the cast and crew of One Tree Hill spoke about.\n\n“I have a responsibility as someone who was working under Mark Schwahn on ‘The Royals’ to acknowledge these claims,” Park said in the statement posted on Twitter Wednesday.\n\n“I am devastated to admit to myself, to my colleagues, and to this industry that I too, have been exposed to this reprehensible behavior.”\n\nThe rumor mill went into high gear over the weekend when Audrey Wauchope tweeted about herself, and her writing partner being introduced to sexual harassment on the set of a teen drama, but there was no indication which teen drama the claim was about.\n\n\"Female writers would try to get the spot where the showrunner wouldn't sit as to not be touched. Often men would help out by sitting next to him, thus protecting the women,\" Wauchope wrote.\n\n\"Sometimes we wouldn't luck out and he'd just squeeze his disgusting body in between us and put his arms around us, grinning.

Often men would help out by sitting next to him, thus protecting the women,\" Wauchope wrote last month.\n\n\"Sometimes we wouldn't luck out, and he'd just squeeze his disgusting body in between us and put his arms around us, grinning.

Meanwhile, others have removed themselves from the spotlight completely.\n\nHowever, nothing bonds a group of strangers quite like a TV show. Their bond has remained strong, and they continue to hang out and keep in touch with fans at conventions which have also kept the legacy of the series alive for new and old fans alike.\n\nThere are even talks of a possible revival in the near-future.\n\nSo, let's return to Tree Hill and see what your basketball-loving, small-town actors have been up to since the series wrapped.\n\n1.

Does that mean One Tree Hill fans are also going to be surprised with new friends and family of the characters we've grown to love so much?\n\nHmmm, indeed! Do you think a potential Christmas show could lead to a full-on reboot of One Tree Hill, or maybe a spinoff utilizing the characters Buckley noted meeting? Will this prompt fans of the series to jump on social media to demand it?\n\nThere are so many questions!\n\nWhile stars such as Sophia Bush and Bethany Joy Lenz were not in any of the pictures, they did \"like\" some of the pictures on the picture sharing platform.\n\nThere's no telling whether this project will be related to One Tree Hill, or if it's the cast working together on a project separate from the series.

But that could be the good news. Maybe news about his proclivities led the rest of the cast and crew to agree to get together once again!\n\nHe was famously ousted from The Royals in November after members of the cast and crew of One Tree Hill signed an open letter accusing him of misconduct.\n\nThe cast of The Royals subsequently released a letter in which they confirmed they stood with the One Tree Hill cast and crew.\n\nRelated: Enjoy UNLIMITED access to thousands of Movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video\n\nOkay, TV Fanatics!\n\nIt's speculation time!

That's about the closest thing we have to a silver lining after being teased by the cast earlier this week.\n\nLifetime announced Wednesday that Hilarie Burton, Robert Buckley, Danneel Ackles, and Antwon Tanner were all reuniting for The Christmas Contract.\n\nThe TV movie follows Jolie (Burton) as she makes her way home to Louisiana for the first time since she parted ways with Foster.\n\nAs fate would have it, Foster is also on his way back to town with a brand new girlfriend, and Jolie's friend, Naomi (Ackles) tells her she should bring back Naomi's brother.\n\nRelated: The CW Fall Schedule: What's on the Move?\n\nIn true soap fashion, Naomi creates a contract so that Jack can be a faux boyfriend to try and turn the tide in Jolie's favor. But Jack is getting something out of the deal.\n\nJolie will help him design a website to bring his upcoming novel to the masses.\n\n“Unbeknownst to them, the Christmas contract proves to be so much more than what they signed up for,” says Lifetime of the project.\n\nJordan Ladd (Cabin Fever), Cheryl Ladd (Charlie’s Angels), Bruce Boxleitner (Tron), Jason London (Dazed and Confused), Hunter Burke (Claws), Teri Wyble (The Walking Dead), and Ritchie Montgomery (Baskets) also star in the movie.\n\nRelated: One Tree Hill: Revived for Christmas Movie?\n\nIt was just a few days ago that the four One Tree Hill actors took to social media to share images of a secret Christmas project. It got fans wondering whether a revival was in the works.\n\nLet's face it: One Tree Hill could easily be revived for a special TV movie or even a limited series. There was no shortage of drama throughout the nine seasons it spent on the air.\n\nIn any case, it's a little disappointing that we're not getting to see these characters again, but it should be fun to see some of them reunite on the small screen.\n\nWhat do you think of this news?\n\nRelated: Get Great Selection of New & Classic Movies with the Lifetime Movie Club via Prime Video Channels!\n\nHit the comments below.\n\nRemember you can watch One Tree Hill online right here via TV Fanatic.\n\nGet caught up with one of the best teen dramas around.\n\n↧\n\n↧\n\nSophia Bush Opens Up About Sexual Harassment on One Tree Hill Set\n\nSophia Bush has opened up about the harassment she was subjected to on the set of One Tree Hill.\n\nThe actress chatted with Andy Cohen on Sirius XM's Andy Cohen Live and detailed an incident in which she was touched by creator Mark Schwahn.\n\n“The first time Mark Schwahn grabbed my ass, I hit him in front of six other producers,” she shared. “And I hit him f—ing hard.”\n\nBut that was not the sole incident. Bush stated that Schwahn was \"super-obsessed\" with another actress from the hit CW drama.\n\n“He started trying to bang down her hotel room door in the middle of the night,\" the actress continued.\n\nRelated: One Tree Hill: Revived for Christmas Special?\n\n\"She had to be moved … and then her boyfriend came and stayed with her [for] the next month. It almost came to fisticuffs between the two of them.”\n\nIt truly sounds like the set of One Tree Hill was not a healthy environment to work in with everything that's come to light over the last year.\n\nBack in November, the female cast and many crew members of the show came together to pen an open letter that called out Schwahn for sexual misconduct.\n\nIt all happened following writer Audrey Wauchope opening up via Twitter about her and her female writing partner being harassed while writing for an unnamed series.\n\n\"Female writers would try to get the spot where the showrunner wouldn't sit as to not be touched,\" reads one of the tweets. \"Often men would help out by sitting next to him, thus protecting the women.\"\n\nRelated: One Tree Hill Stars Reunite for Lifetime Movie\n\n\"Sometimes we wouldn't luck out and he'd just squeeze his disgusting body in between us and put his arms around us, grinning,\" reads another.\n\nIn even more disturbing news, Wauchope went on to claim that Schwahn passed around naked photos of an actress he slept with.\n\nThe female cast and crew of One Tree Hill subsequently released a letter standing with Audrey.\n\nHere is what the letter said:\n\nAll of the female cast members of One Tree Hill have chosen this forum to stand together in support of Audrey Wauchope and one another. To use terminology that has become familiar as the systemic reality of sexual harassment and assault has come more and more to light, Mark Schwahn’s behavior over the duration of the filming of One Tree Hill was something of an “open secret.”\n\nMany of us were, to varying degrees, manipulated psychologically and emotionally. More than one of us is still in treatment for post-traumatic stress. Many of us were put in uncomfortable positions and had to swiftly learn to fight back, sometimes physically.\n\nIt was made clear to us that the supervisors in the room were not the protectors they were supposed to be. Many of us were spoken to in ways that ran the spectrum from deeply upsetting, to traumatizing, to downright illegal. And a few of us were put in positions where we felt physically unsafe.\n\nMore than one woman on our show had her career trajectory threatened. It continues: The through line in all of this was, and still is, our unwavering support of and faith in one another.\n\nWe confided in each other. We set up safe spaces to talk about his behavior and how to handle it. To warn new women who joined our ranks.\n\nRelated: Mark Schwahn Fired from The Royals!\n\nWe understood that a lot of it was orchestrated in ways that kept it out of sight for the studio back home. We also understood that no one was fully unaware.\n\nThe lack of action that has been routine, the turning of the other cheek, is intolerable. We collectively want to echo the calls of women everywhere that vehemently demand change, in all industries.\n\nMany of us were told, during filming, that coming forward to talk about this culture would result in our show being canceled and hundreds of lovely, qualified, hard-working, and talented people losing their jobs.\n\nThis is not an appropriate amount of pressure to put on young girls. Many of us since have stayed silent publicly but had very open channels of communication in our friend group and in our industry.\n\nWe want Tree Hill to remain the place “where everything’s better and everything’s safe” for our fans; some of whom have said that the show quite literally saved their lives. But the reality is, no space is safe when it has an underlying and infectious cancer.\n\nWe have worked at taking our power back, making the conventions our own, and relishing in the good memories. But there is more work to be done. We are all deeply grateful for Audrey’s courage.\n\nFor one another. And for every male cast mate and crew member who has reached out to our group of women to offer their support these last few days.\n\nThey echo the greater rallying cry that must lead us to change: Believe Women.
