        "text": "Every year I’m afraid that I’ve found all there is, all there will ever be of Guiding Light holidays in Springfield. So far every year I’ve been able to find something more. Thanks in this case to the wonderful We Love Soaps TV ‏@WeLoveSoapsTV who shared us two early Guiding Light episodes in excellent quality. I’m especially pleased to have this episode because this is as they say “Where I came in.” Well I watched before this, but the first concrete memories of plots I remember is late 1978 or early 1979. So this is right on target.\n\nAt this point, there are several paternity puzzles in play. Chrissy (later Blake) still believes Ed is her father and they call each other Dad and daughter several times in this episode. The guy with the mustache who shows up with Holly is a doctor who Holly has charmed into doing her bidding. Phillip’s biological parents are Jackie and Justin, but very few people know at this point. Justin (in an arrangement that I always thought had more to do with Phillip’s custody than any great romance) was married to Elizabeth who at this point knows she isn’t Phillip’s biological mother, but doesn’t know who is. Jackie knows all and I think Justin does at this point. Jackie and Justin belong together of course. Phillip later said that it was like growing up with four parents. I think most people will probably recognize Bert, Mike and Ed, but the older white haired man is Rick’s other grandfather Dr. Stephen Jackson (father of Leslie, mentor to Ed) who remained friendly with the Bauers and attended most family functions. The woman in pink is Hillary Bauer who is Bill’s biological daughter via his second illegal marriage who is by this time fully accepted into the Bauer fold. She works as a nurse at Cedars Hospital and is best friends with Katie Parker.\n\nAlan Spaulding had found a nemesis in Mike Bauer. Mike found Alan to be underhanded and devious and everything the upstanding Mike Bauer hated. The rilvary was rather one sided because while Alan got tired of Mike’s attempts to thwart his plans, Alan actually respected Mike. Earlier this summer Alan and Hope (Mike’s daughter) had been marooned on a desert island and fallen in love forming one of the best soap couples ever. Unfortunately Alan was married to Jackie and they had several obstacles to overcome before they were married in Mike’s house. Mike was always sure Alan would hurt Hope, which ultimately he would by failing her, but I don’t think Mike ever truly appreciated how much Alan and Hope loved each other. Mike strongly and stormily disapproved at best which caused distance between him and Hope.\n\nCedars Hospital used to have a party every year for the children who were stuck in the hospital over the holiday. Floyd Parker is a dear and he’s helping out his sister with the puppet stand. The woman who comes in with the extra long 1970s Crystal Gayle hair is Lanie Marler. She’s Ross and Justin’s sister. She’s training to attend the Olympics in track (which sadly she doesn’t make after she is temporarily paralyzed) and has a mad unrequited crush on Ed. We have a nice conversation between Rick (then called Freddie) and Phillip an early look at their practically lifelong friendship. I really want to smack Ed when he breaks them up to introduce Rick to another stupid kid.\n\nEd tells the Christmas story with some changed up details for some reason. This is something I don’t think would ever make it on the soap today. The other thing to really notice is the silence bits. The actors do wonders with them and they are something else you won’t see today.\n\nThis is the forty-seventh in an irregular feature where we will report updates on what cast members of Guiding Light are doing now. I’m playing catch up on some soap magazine news. So as a reminder you can buy back issues:\n\nhttps://glmanny.wordpress.com/2010/11/27/faq-back-issues\n\nPaula Garces (Pilar Santos, Danny Santos’ little sister) was featured in the April 22, 2002 issue of People. Garces was featured for playing characters younger than her age. In 2012 she has continued to appear regularly on primetime episodic television. Judging from the photo, she’s no longer playing teenagers.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0305519\n\nRyan Brown (Bill Lewis III #4, who played Little Billy during the Bilar romance which crossed heavily with Manny) is featured in the “Where Are They Now?” in the March 20, 2012 Soap Opera Digest. I thought I knew a lot about him, but in this piece I learned his mother is author Sandra Brown and he met his wife Victoria Arbiter, who’s the “royal contributor” for The Early Show on CBS, while on Guiding Light. Find the article in Soap Opera Digest and check out his author page. http://www.ryanbrownauthor.com\n\nIn the February 3, 1997 issue of People Jerry ver Dorn (Ross Marler) was quoted as saying “I’m thoroughly convinced that we could go back to 1937 , do this in front of black drapes and if the story is good enough, they’d still watch. He didn’t know pretty much they’d be back to black drape without the good story to back them up all too soon.\n\nMarcy Rylan (Lizzie Spaulding Lewis #6, part of the wonderful Bizzie pairing) was the feature interview in the April 23, 2012 issue of CBS Soaps in Depth.\n\nBrian Gaskill (Dylan Lewis #2) was interviewed about his poetry album on Soap Central.\n\nhttp://soapcentral.com/radio/news/2012/120316-gaskill.php\n\nI found in the New York Times archive that Elizabeth (Betty) Rea died on December 23, 1999. She was the casting director of Guiding Light from 1970-1996 which would have included casting most of the iconic characters from the middle run of the show. During 1979-1983 she fulfilled the same function simultaneously on As the World Turns. She was inducted into the Soap Opera Hall of Fame. She had also won the Soap Opera Digest Editors Award and the Casting Society of America’s Hoyt Bowers Award.\n\nJoan Collins (Alexandra Spaulding #3) was interviewed about her role on Guiding Light in the November 4, 2002 issue of People. She said her biggest challenge was keeping “25 pages of dialogue in your head.” Cue cards weren’t allowed on set. “We rehearse five scenes and shoot them one after another. It’s like opening night at the theater.” – Find it full text in the Ebscohost Academic Search Complete.\n\nThe Harlem School of Arts provided a group of their students to be Michelle Bauer and Bill Lewis’ classmates appearing both at the prom and the graduation ceremony in 1997; among them: Letesha Hallet-Ridley, Wema Harris, Joanna Goodwin, and Tracy Johnson. A group photo was included in the July 5, 1997 issue of New York Amsterdam News. In 2012 none of those names are included in IMDB except Tracy Johnson which had too many with the same name to be sure if it was the same one.\n\nI found an article in the 12/6/2007 issue of New York Amsterdam News that Vannessa Simmons, the oldest daughter of Rev. Run aka Joseph Simmons of Run-DMC) had gotten a role on Guiding Light. A little digging turned up her character was named Lola. I don’t know anything else about her.\n\nhttp://www.tvfanatic.com/2007/08/vanessa-simmons-sheds-guiding-light-on-new-character\n\nHanne Lynn Anderson‘s marriage was announced in April 3, 2011 issue of The New York Times. Anderson, now. Mrs. Jack Vaughn Jr., had won an Emmy for multiple camera editing as a video editor on Guiding Light in 2008. As of 2011, she was a senior video editor at R/GA a digital advertising agency in New York. She has a few credits on IMDB.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm1950756\n\nBeth Chamberlain (Beth Raines Spaulding #2) gave a quote out during Guiding Light’s 70th Anniversary year. It appeared in the January 22, 2007 issue of Television Week. She talked about her experience meeting fans during her book tour for Loreli’s Diary. “Everywhere I went, there would be three, four generations of women there, and the great-grandmother had gotten the grandmother into the show, who got the mother into it. When I got back from that, I had a completely different perspective about being part of Guiding Light. I’m not just a part of a TV show, I’m part of mother-daughter tradition. It made me appreciate my job.”\n\nMark Schlereth, an ESPN analyst and former guard for both the Redskins and the Broncos, played detective Rock Hoover starting in 2007. Watch for him.\n\nMark Pinter (Mark, who had affairs with Amanda Spaulding and her biological mother Jennifer) and Colleen Zenk (Barbara Ryan on As the World Turns) are quoted in an article that discusses the real story behind their being married to other people and dumping them for each other. They married in 1987 and they divorced in 2010. Read more in March 20, 2012 issue of Soap Opera Digest.\n\nBeth Ehlers (Harley Cooper) and Mark Derwin (A.C. Mallet #1) discussed their relationship. Ehlers left her first husband for Derwin. They never married and even though they left Guiding Light together and were in a couple of other projects together, they broke up before very long. Read more in March 20, 2012 issue of Soap Opera Digest.\n\nAfter Kassie DePaiva (Chelsea Reardon, the youngest Reardon daughter) left Guiding Light, she took over the role of Blair on All My Children. She got involved with costar James DePaiva. They both divorced their then current spouses to be together in 1993. The DePaivas are still together. Read more in March 20, 2012 issue of Soap Opera Digest. DePaiva tweeted a photo of her and her husband and former One Life to Live costar Nathan Fillion.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/KassieDePaiva/status/198913373147119616/photo/1\n\nJames Lipton, best known for hosting Inside the Actors Studio, played a doctor (still looking for a name) on Guiding Light. He wrote scripts and apparently became head writer at one point.\n\nhttp://www.imdb.com/name/nm0513851/bio\n\nJack Wood, a director of many soap operas including Guiding Light, died at age 82 as reported in the February 25, 2007 issue of the New York Times.\n\nCheryl Lynn Brown (Chrissy Blake Bauer, as a girl) was tracked down by People magazine for their March 14, 1994 issue. Brown was then a sophomore at Kean College in New Jersey. Then 20, Brown says “I got the part because I looked like the actress who played my mother.” Brown has no further entries in IMDB.\n\nDonna Swajeski (Guiding Light writer) was interviewed in the August 1999 issue of Victoria magazine. “Everybody comes up to me when they find out I write for the soaps. Usually they want to know how I started and how I keep coming up with new ideas,” says Donna. Twice nominated for an Emmy, Donna is a member of the five-person writing team responsible for this immensely popular CBS Soap Opera. “We meet weekly to create an overall story, then each of us crafts a day.” Find the rest of the article in Victoria or in Ebscohost Academic Search Complete.\n\nScott Bailey (Sandy Foster, the fake Jonathan Randall) and his new bride Adrienne Frantz (Amber Moore on The Bold and the Beautiful) have recently appeared on HGTV’s makeover show Design on a Dime. They redid their dining room as a 1920s speakeasy. Read more about it in the March 20, 2012 issue of Soap Opera Digest.\n\nTom Pelphrey (Jonathan Randall, one of Reva’s sudden sons) is currently on Broadway in an American production of a British hit, Somewhere Over the Rainbow. It’s a play about Judy Garland‘s final months. See an article about it in the April 23, 2012 issue of CBS Soaps in Depth.\n\nThe April 23, 2012 issue of CBS Soaps in Depth has photos from 3rd Annual Indie Soap Awards. Signy Coleman (Annie Dutton #2/Terri DeMarco), Michael O’Leary (Rick Bauer #5) Tonja Walker (Marie), Frank Dicopoulos (Frank Cooper), and Orlagh Cassidy (Doris Wolfe, DA).\n\nThe Feb. 28, 2012 issue of Soap Opera Digest did a round up of actors who were on soaps and moved on to primetime, including:\n\nBethany Joy Galeotti/Joie Lenz (Michelle Bauer Santos #4 of Manny fame) to One Tree Hill.\n\nMatt Boomer (Ben Reade #3, who paired with Marina Cooper) moved on to Chuck and White Collar.\n\nTaye Diggs (Sugar Hill, part of Marcus-Delhia-Drew storyline) moved on to Ally McBeal, Grey’s Anatomy, and Private Practice.\n\nMichelle Forbes (Sonni/Solita Lewis, one of Josh’s crazy wives) moved on to Homicide: Life on the Street, 24, Battlestar Galactica, In Treatment, True Blood, and is currently on The Killing.\n\nMelina Kanakaredes (Eleni Cooper #1, the one with spirit and sparkle) moved on to NYPD Blue, Providence, and CSI: New York.\n\nJoe Lando (Macualley West – who did a summer storyline involving Mindy on his summer hiatus from Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman) moved on to The Secret Circle.\n\nHayden Panettiere (Lizzie Spaulding #2, the little girl who returned from Arizona, killed Carl Stevens, and fought cancer) moved on to Heroes.\n\nChristina Pickles (Linell, a Springfield secretary from 1970-1972), moved on to St. Elsewhere and Friends.\n\nBrittany Snow (Susan Daisy LeMay Cooper #2, who returned from Arizona) moved on to American Dreams and Harry’s Law.\n\nSherry Stringfield (Blake Thorpe Marler #4) moved on to NYPD Blue and ER.\n\nPaul Wesley (Max Nickerson #2, Drew Jacob’s foster brother) moved on to American Dreams, Everwood, and Vampire Diaries.\n\nClick on the Posted in “GL Cast Update” category below for more posts about keeping up with the Springfielders."
