        "text": "Hey guys, it’s that time again…I’ve been toying around with this first bit of a new short story series for a while. I like how it’s shaping up. This new story series will probably send us into the new year, and long after. #AlwaysRambling. I hope you will join in and read along!\n\nMeet Melanie…\n\nMelanie stares at her reflection in an airport bathroom. Her crystal blue eyes stare back at her.\n\nShe fluffs her hair and reaches into her purse for her lip gloss, as she applies some of her favorite very berry with just a hint of pink, and is instantly hit with a feeling of déjà vu.\n\nTime freezes and she thinks of him. As she often does.\n\nThere she stands in front of her vanity applying her lipstick as she feels him watching her from the doorway of their bedroom.\n\nTurning with a smile, she says, “What are you looking at?”\n\nHe smirks, “Everything,” he says casually leaning against the wooden door molding.\n\n“Yea? And…do you like what you see?” she says showing off her outfit.\n\nHe smiles and walks over to her, taking her hand he spins her around, as his eyes glance over her full ensemble.\n\n“You. Look. Sexy as hell,” he smiles pulling her to him and kissing her.\n\nShe smiles against his lips as she cups his face, her diamond ring sparkling as it sits on her left hand.\n\nMelanie is brought back to reality as a stranger sets off the hand dryer nearby.\n\nShe shakes off the memory as she looks at her now empty ring finger.\n\nShe looks at herself in the mirror once more.\n\nYou can do this, she thinks to herself.\n\nMelanie wipes a tear from her eye, as her cell phone begins to ring.\n\nGrabbing her plaid suitcase and purse, she strolls into the airport lobby, answering her phone.\n\n“Hey mom.”\n\n“Sweetheart! Did you land yet?”\n\n“Yes. Just now actually, I am just about to head out and grab a cab.”\n\n“Oh honey I’m so sorry we couldn’t meet you, there’s just so much prep to do, we have the whole family coming early tomorrow morning.”\n\n“Mom it’s really ok. I understand. It’s no big deal. I will see you soon.”\n\n“Ok honey! Oh I am so excited to see you!”\n\n“Me too. Love you, see you in a bit,” Melanie says with a smile.\n\n“Love you, bye.”\n\nMelanie hangs up and heads toward the exit. Stepping toward the end of the curb, she raises her hand to hail a cab. The fall chill nipping at her nose.\n\n********************************************************************************\n\n“Thank you,” Melanie says to her cab driver as he unloads her suitcase for her.\n\nShe looks up at her childhood home, and instantly her heart is full.\n\nShe smiles at the festive decorations of hay stacks, pumpkins, scarecrows and twinkling lanterns that line the pathway to the door which is dressed in a sunflower wreath. Orange, yellow, red and green flood her eyes as she blinks to feel more grounded.\n\nIt’s been a while.\n\nShe reaches for the door knob, the cold gold feeling strange yet familiar at the same time. And turning it, she peers in. Her nostrils instantly flooded with her mom’s famous sweet potato pie and cranberry stuffing.\n\n“Hello?” She says wheeling her suitcase in as her low heeled booties click and clack over the hard cherry wood floor.\n\nShe hears some clinking and banging in the kitchen and then is met by her mother’s streaks and open arms.\n\n“Melanie!!!! Oh my word. You look fantastic,” she says hugging her daughter tightly.\n\n“Hey Mom,” she says smiling.\n\n“Is that my Mel belle that just walked in?” her dad says walking in the front door in his work clothes and rushing to hug her too.\n\nMelanie smiles as she hugs her parents.\n\n“It’s good to be home,” she says finally feeling an inner peace.\n\n********************************************************************************\n\n“Mom can I help you with anything?” she asks as she settles in on a chair at the island across from where her mother works on mixing up some cornbread batter.\n\n“You could get started on the sticky buns?” she says with a smile.\n\nMelanie smiles back with wide eyes.\n\n“Sure,” she says standing and heading to the fridge.\n\n“You remember how to make them?” her mom says peering over the edges of her red rimmed eyeglasses.\n\n“You put them in the oven, let them rise, add some honey and brown sugar and then get to starting on the glaze.”\n\n“And…” her mom says with a questioning smile.\n\n“Add a little extra cinnamon for a lot of extra love, How could I ever forget?” she says as her mom smiles at her.\n\n*********************************************************************************\n\nMelanie sits in front of the fireplace. Her eyes glazing over as she watches the flames flicker away.\n\nAn image flashes in her mind of him. Them. On that very same couch. He leans over.\n\n“So…are we actually alone in this big old house?”\n\n“I think so,” she says looking over at him her eyes smiling with a sparkle.\n\nHe smirks, and leans over to her, kissing her. As he leans into her, the kisses intensify as he switches them to a laying down position, him above her gazing down into her eyes.\n\n“Promise me something?” he says tucking her hair behind her ear.\n\n“Anything,” She says gazing back her hands wrapped around his waist.\n\n“Promise you’ll never leave me.”\n\n“Never,” she says reaching up and cupping his neck, pulling him into a kiss.\n\n“Good, because I don’t think I can handle that.”\n\nShe smiles, her heart bursting as they kiss into the night, their clothes disguarded piece by piece.\n\nMelanie looks around her living room, it’s emptier now.\n\nShe shifts uncomfortably in her seat.\n\nShe sighs, her heart heavy.\n\nYou can do this, she thinks.\n\nHer eyes begin to well up.\n\n“Honey?”\n\nMelanie looks up to find her mother looking at her with concern.\n\n“Melanie, what’s wrong? Or do I even have to ask?”\n\nMelanie smiles simply as she brushes a single tear off her cheek with her cream colored oversized sweater sleeve.\n\n“If we’re going to do this…I’m going to need a little liquid courage.”\n\n“I have some Thanksgiving Day punch, shall we sneak a little in tonight?”\n\n“Yes please,” she says smiling faintly.\n\n********************************************************************************\n\n“So…have you seen him?” Melanie asks looking over the brim of her glass as she throws back a giant gulp of Thanksgiving Day punch.\n\n“I have,” her mother says carefully, calmly.\n\n“How is he?” Melanie inquires caught between wanting to know and not wanting to know but having to ask anyway no matter what the truth may be.\n\n“He seems good.”\n\n“Good. I’m glad. I want him to be good.”\n\n“He asked about you.”\n\nMelanie sighs looking away.\n\n“Did you tell him I was coming home for the holidays?”\n\n“Did you want me to?”\n\n“No. I mean I don’t know. Town like ours, I’m sure I’m bound to run into him anyway so…”\n\n“He knows. He guessed.”\n\n“Ah,” she says her eyebrows raising.\n\n“He always had a way of knowing you better than anybody…”\n\n“Except you.” She says smiling at her mom.\n\n“Well yes, mother knows best.” She smiles.\n\n“I know I see him every few years. You’d think it’d get easier. But it hasn’t, it just gets harder. I don’t know what to say, or what to do. He deserves so much better than I could ever give him.”\n\n“Honey, I don’t think there is any resentment there. Not anymore. Time does heal.”\n\n“Not all wounds.”\n\n“Maybe not yours. But he seems very much ok. Moved on even.”\n\nMelanie ponders, her eyes watering, and her mind racing as she looks back at the fire, the flames crackling and glistening in the night. She takes another sip of her punch as she stares off into space.\n\nHer mother watching on with a sad heart.\n\n**********************\n\nWho’s this mystery man, that lurks through Melanie’s thoughts?\n\nTo be continued…\n\n-<3-\n\nSo I’ve noticed this bit of a “Describe Yourself In 3 Fictional Characters” challenge/trend surface on the internet lately. And I loved it and instinctively wanted to turn it into a blog post.\n\nAs a writer I have a ton of fictional characters that I relate to and feel like somehow mirror my personality. I love identifying bits of myself in characters I see written and portrayed on screen. I couldn’t decide so I did 4, #ICheated #SorryNotSorry. (well Pocahontas is based on a real woman so I guess I didn’t cheat, there’s three fictional here!)\n\nSo here goes…\n\nHaley James (Pre-Scott)\n\nPortrayed By Bethany Joy Lenz\n\nTV Show: One Tree Hill\n\nIf you’ve followed this blog before, you know my obsession with this character. It is real and she is probably my most beloved tv character. Since the first day I started watching One Tree Hill, she was the one I felt was most like me. She was the shy, smart girl who was way beyond her years, wanted to help everyone, had this keen sense between right and wrong, wasn’t popular but had her friends and family who she would do anything for and dressed kind of funky. She is my spirit animal. As later seasons came, she of course got cooler, started dating a jock, made friends with the in crowd, dressed better/different, got married in high school, and became this total rock star, made some mistakes, redeemed herself, had a baby in high school, and then later on became an English teacher and co-owner of the new and improved Karen’s Café. All while looking flawless the whole damn time. Which goes to show you, why I really identified with her in the first season mostly. As much as I love Haley James Scott, Haley James was simple, was real and her life seemed normal. Without all the fancy pants stuff, at her root Haley James-Scott or not has always had a strong moral code and a big heart and for that alone I will always be a fan. #ThatJeanJacketTho\n\nPocahontas\n\nVoice-Irene Bedard, Singing Voice-Judy Kuhn\n\nThe Disney Film\n\nWhile all the little girls wanted to be Cinderella, and Snow White, I related most to Pocahontas. To me, is was the Disney Princess who I felt looked most like me. For starters her olive complexion and her free spirit. Her barefoot adventures and love of sunflowers and jewelry and feathers. I love the story, I love her roots and how she knows who she is and knows that her family her everything. She makes decisions based on what’s best for her, she’s independent despite the many trying to decide what’s best for her. She explores, she is curious. The Indian culture has always fascinated me, and I have always felt a pull to it. She is probably the reason why.\n\nRaven Baxter\n\nPortrayed By Raven Symone\n\nTV Show: That’s So Raven\n\nFreeForm shows old school Disney shows late at night and once night I caught That’s SO Raven on TV, and I couldn’t help but laugh and see a bit of myself in her. Her crazy fashion choices, I have had my moments. #BlueLipStick #FlowersInMyHair #FurrySweaters Her impromptu dancing, her absurd slang. It’s all me. #YANASTY #OHSNAP I love her, and I too at times feel psychic. #SHHHH 😉 Also can we just state that Raven paved this way for curvy girls to feel good about themselves. She wasn’t perfect, she was curvy and loud and fun and colorful and she was SUCCESSFUL! Raven is most like my younger self, and I think she comes out still every once in a while.\n\nJane Villanueva\n\nPortrayed By Gina Rodriquez\n\nTV Show: Jane the Virgin\n\nLet’s put aside the whole baby daddy/mama drama, that is this show. Yes Jane was accidentally artificially inseminated and instantly was thrown into motherhood way ahead of her planned out life’s schedule with a guy’s baby, who she never expected to come back into her life. That is the juicy stuff and my life is nothing like hers in that sense. But for some reason in a lot of other ways, Jane may be the character I relate most too. She’s always the responsible one, but when she messes up she owns up to it, and when she let’s loose, her beauty shines. She’s an older 20’s. She is a curvy Latina, with a heart of gold and good morals and extremely close to her family. She believes in love and is a hopeless romantic-not to mention a soap opera fan too. My favorite part-she’s a writer and she is constantly drifting off into her own world, as she stars in her scenes as she writes them. Her morals are very similar to mine and I adore her character as a whole, because everything I mentioned about her holds true for me too. She spontaneous dances too, so I mean we’re twins who need to meet and be best friends.\n\nAs you can tell I love seeing strong, determines, driven, independent, caring, loving, kind, big heart of gold female characters. They are what inspires me to write and to be a better woman.\n\n-<3-\n\n*I do not take credit for any images used.*\n\nI’m a TV Junkie and I’ve been anxiously awaiting all the fall premieres for my favorite shows! So I thought I’d share my upcoming tv schedule with you. It’s research for writing my own future television shows. Because I will get there, one day.\n\nMONDAY:\n\nJane The Virgin @ 9:00 pm The CW (October 17th) – Gina Rodriquez is EVERYTHING, she shines as Jane and she is unbelievably authentic.

I love those and it’s got the dad from Everwood in it and the very handsome Jesse Metcalfe, so there’s that. And one of the sisters is a writer, so instantly I love her! I saw the commercial for this while watching one of the many Hallmark movies I love and I just felt drawn to it. Who knew Hallmark had such kickass tv shows too??? 😉\n\nRead my Hallmark movies favs HERE\n\nAs you can see I juggle a lot. Along with work, everyday life stuff, and family and friends, it’s nice to come home and have my mind be on something else for a bit. I love television, it’s an escape for me. I love characters and plotlines, and storytelling. Like I said- it’s research. Stay Tuned.\n\n*If you have any fun tv show suggestions, sound off below. I can always fit something else in, maybe. HAHA.\n\n*I do not take credit for any images used.*\n\n-<3-\n\n**No Monday Post this week. Boo! I know, I broke my streak. But I was actually away in Atlantic City celebrating my brother’s 30th birthday with my family and I didn’t have time to schedule anything worth posting. So I’ll just let that one go, and give you a sick ass Thursday post full of one of my most favorite things…MUSIC. Hope you dig it! 😉\n\nI’ve spoken about my love for One Tree Hill many times, and I am sure that I’ve even dabbled in expressing how much the music on that show inspired new ways of listening to music for me.\n\nI may not have been the biggest Peyton Sawyer fan, but I can safely say that because of her emo “I hate my life” teen angst attitude, I was catapulted into learning the ways of appreciating new music.\n\nThen as Haley James became a songstress and TRIC was born, the music become it’s own character on the show. And for me this character was so well beloved.\n\nI can’t tell you how many times I’d be watching an episode and a line in a song would just tweak my heart and I’d go on a search for that same song with a fury. Cue the greatest One Tree Hill fansite: oth-music.com. This site gave song by song for every episode and it was a lifesaver. If I hear a song, my mind will usually be able to register whether or not it’s been featured on One Tree Hill, and then it can usually tell what scene or bring me back to the days of middle school into high school when that show was LIFE for me and my friends. That time is so special to my heart and it lasted 9 years. Longer than most relationships usually last. So hey what the hell…oth music is my boyfriend. 😉\n\nHere are some of my most treasured songs featured on the show. Anything Gavin DeGraw, Michelle Featherstone, Sarah McLachlan, Susie Suh, or Bethany Joy Lenz was pretty much a staple on the show’s music scene. And because of the show, my musical ear kind of transcended my usual pop radio feels into something much more rich with feeling and understanding. A new aged relatability was born. My best friend was the facilitator for this. She would call me up just to read me lyrics or make me mixed CDs full of songs from One Tree Hill and The OC. I still have them! Pretty sure she was the one to find the music site too. TV shows use music to elevate it’s scenes and the material written. It can take an ordinary chat between friends and make it a life lesson, or can take a heartbreak one particular character is going through and make you feel it in your soul. Music is the universal language. And in some epic way, everybody knows how to speak it- it’s a beautiful thing.\n\nMy Ultimate One Tree Hill Favs Playlist-\n\n1.

Enjoy! 😀\n\n*I do not take credit for any images or songs/videos used.*\n\n-<3-\n\nIt’s safe to say that I’ve always been in love with television. But One Tree Hill made me fall in love with storytelling in a way that I will never forget. So as I reflect on (and freak out over) the fact that I’m FINALLY going to see BETHANY JOY LENZ in concert at the end of this month, all my One Tree Hill obsessions are totally resurfacing. So I thought I’d share some memories I’ve collected over the years that are dear to me.\n\nMy Cozy Keith Scott Body Shop Sweater-\n\nThis was bought as a birthday gift from my friend Kate. I still wear this and it still makes me so happy. I remember wearing it to school one day back when I was in high school and having two girls talking about it behind me- “Oh my god, that’s like Lucas’ Keith Scott’s Body Shop Sweater from One Tree Hill.” I turned and smiled with pride.\n\nFalling In Love With New Music-\n\nHere I am at a Tyler Hilton concert with my friend. We actually got to meet him and I remember asking him what hooptie meant and he said it was an old car and then we all got to give him a big group hug. Tyler played Chris Keller.\n\n“Well I’m cruising El Paseo\n\nIn my off-white coup back ’65\n\nOr I’m cruisin down my own street\n\nAnd my hooptie says to me\n\nYou better hang on to your bench seat\n\nI’m gonna take you for a ride.”\n\n-“When It Comes” by Tyler Hilton\n\nThe Meet & Greets-\n\nMy parents agreed to take part in my obsession and drove me and my best friends to meet what we like to call “Routh”- Marvin “Mouth” McFadden (played by Lee Norris) and Rachel Gatina (played by Danneel Harris.) I remember having a blast road tripping and then waiting in line. We were allowed to make CW t-shirts in the CW lounge they had set up in the Paramus Mall. My dad of course acted like a security guard and got the inside scoop on when the two actors would be coming, haha.\n\nI remember the two of them being so sweet, posing for multiple pictures and signing autographs. I told Lee how excited we were that he finally had his own credit in the show’s beginning credits, he was promoted to a series regular FINALLY.\n\nMeeting Sophia Bush (Brooke Davis) in Macy’s in New York City was EPIC, but left me in tears and with a massive headache and a serious amount of embarrassment. It was kind of surreal, but the moment I went up to meet her I fell apart with no warning. My brother took me and my friends and he’s a photographer so he went up to meet Sophia first so that he would be able to take pictures of us with Sophia. Since the security wouldn’t let us pose for pictures with her, (seriously they took my brothers camera wile he went up and everything) but my brother tried to get Sophia to look at him as I went up so I could get a picture with her and well, she totally did it but just having my brother say that I was her biggest fan and tried to get that picture for me made me super emotional and the excitement, 7 hours of waiting in line, and lack of sleep all came crashing down on me. And I was a mess, so much so that I almost forgot to meet Daphne Zuniga (Victoria Davis.) I just remember wanting to get the heck out of there, because I felt so silly. But hey what can you do. Emotions aren’t controllable. Feeling is okay.\n\nRandom Fangirl Things-\n\nAt Macy’s they had this CW-One Tree Hill photobooth. You were basically supposed to go in an film a 30 second clip of why you should be on the show, or some kind of fan contest thing. They were always doing things like that, but clearly I never won. Anyway, the day we met Sophia was so hectic that we had to go back another day to submit our clips.\n\nRecreating the Season 1 signature tangled web pose.\n\nI hosted many viewing parties usually for the season premieres and would invite all my friends. And then every week my best friend Roe and I would watch together, switching houses each week.\n\nAnd last but not least, I am about to share some very embarrassing photos with you. Our obsession reached the epic standard in middle school and continued through high school when my friends and I would have these epic OTH sleepovers. We would choose scenes/or episodes to act out from the show and film them. I still have one of them and every time I watch them I am reminded of my childhood/teenhood. It was kind of freakin’ awesome and I’d like to think that’s where my writing/directing influence was sparked. I would print out scripts, track down similar outfits and create settings and scenes to match the show. I can’t tell you how many times I would re-watch scenes to take notes, because I wanted to get things just right. We even played the parts, mostly we played out the scenes with all the girls, but sometimes we reverse Shakespearean and played the roles of the guys too. Weird I know, but let’s be honest Lucas and Haley had some epic best friend moments! It was all in good fun and we would have a blast. It was an all weekend thing that would last into all hours of the night! I’d give anything to go back in time and relive a weekend like that again. #Memories\n\nOur favorite episode to do was 2×08 “Truth Bitter Truth”\n\nI played Anna Taggaro (played by Daniella Alonso.) See the resemblance 😉\n\nOther scene similarities\n\nSo big thank you to One Tree Hill for giving me some of my most treasured memories. ❤\n\nI know what you must be thinking, but if you love Bethany Joy Lenz so much, how come you’ve never met her. Well it wasn’t for a lack of trying. Back in middle school when the One Tree Hill tour was on, my best friend and I tried to get tickets and we couldn’t. And then when James Lafferty and Bethany Joy Lenz had their meet and greet, my friends and I found out too late, I was on my way home from vacation with my family from Pennsylvania. But my friend Michelle did go and she filled us in on all the awesomeness. Yea I admit, I was jealous. But now on July 28th I finally get to at least see her in concert with my best friend Roe, and that’s a start. Can’t wait!\n\n*I do not take credit for any One Tree Hill pictures and gifs used.*\n\n*All other photos are my own.*\n\n-<3-\n\nSophia Bush: “Casual” Style Files\n\nRead my First Sophia Bush Fashion Style Files HERE\n\nMeet Erin Davis HERE\n\nI love fashion and experimenting with it. But lately with my current job position being a bit more of a relaxed dress code environment, I’ve found myself reaching for more simple pieces; jeans, plain t-shirts, cardigans or flannels (oh flannels, what would I do without you?), and converse.\n\nThis well-known accessories girl has implemented a few key simple jewelry pieces that I wear basically every day. Which is quite the change for a lover of jewelry.\n\nAnd I’ve noticed that in this change, I’ve sought out some laid back fashion inspiration. I’ve reached for basics and practicality, because when you feel comfortable, your performance at work and in life- shines greater.\n\nNow don’t get me wrong I still love fashion. I love color and prints and mixing and matching. I love accessorizing and picking which pieces will make an outfit complete. But it’s nice to throw on something comfortable and have a well-rounded look, especially when you’re busy.\n\nSo let’s get into the Sophia Bush talk. The reason I chose her is because well I love her, and I love her style. I think she does casual really well. Her looks come across effortless, chic and just super chill. So much so that it gives high fashion a run for its money.\n\nHere are some of my favorite casual Sophia Bush Looks:\n\nThe casual look I think stems from playing detective Erin Lindsay on NBC’s Chicago PD. Bush’s character is a badass and she catches the bad guys while looking flawless in a t-shirt and jeans. She was actually a huge inspiration for me, when I decided to chop my hair off last summer. Can’t wait to do it again this summer. #LongHairAndSummerHeatNoBueno\n\nHave you ever been slightly jealous of a woman who can make a t-shirt and jeans looks so damn cool, calm and collected? Like she doesn’t even have to try. And yea I’m sure Lindsay dresses this way because she needs to be comfortable on the job while she bangs down doors, speed races in cop car chases, and avoids the temptation to kiss her co-worker boyfriend while clocked in, but Bush’s “Lindsay” has transformed the casual look into a staple for me and many fans who were obsessed with her fashion forward Brooke Davis character on CW’s One Tree Hill. (Check out my “Erin Davis” Blog Post linked above for a fashion comparison of these two characters.)\n\nTake a look at Erin Lindsay’s Style:\n\nWhat I love about Bush’s looks are how she keeps the comfort of basic pieces but throws in some odd pieces to brighten the look; like a bright colored or funky printed purse or shoe, or a really chunky statement necklace or my favorite- a killer pair of shades. I think mixing really feminine pieces with simple more masculine clothing can make for a really dynamic look, all while just looking chill and like you just threw this together a few minutes before heading out the door.\n\nFashion is inspiring. I love gaining inspiration from people I admire. Watching TV and film has opened doors to the fashion world too. I can’t count how many times I’ve tried to dress like Lizzie McGuire back in the early 2000s. Sophia Bush is one of my favorites and I think she’s been inspiring my more laid back fashion, that and well my current lifestyle. #Change #SometimesItJustFits\n\nNow I wish I could pull off the casual look and make it look as fashion forward as she (or Detective Lindsay) does, but hey I can only be me. I’m sure I’ll be back to my bohemian side at some point. The cool thing I’ve realized about fashion, is that it evolves. Constantly. Style is not just one look. Sure we all want and try to keep up with the trends. But sometimes I find myself throwing caution to the wind and just wearing whatever the hell I want, whether or not it’s deemed “in style.” One day I can be rocking jeans and a t-shirt and the next on a weekend if I’m going out with friends or have a family occasion to attend; I’m rocking the dress and the heels and the makeup. Style doesn’t have to confine you into a small minded box. Style is just as much how you wear something as it is what you wear.\n\nStyle is mood. Style is occasion. Style is expression. Wear what you want to wear.\n\nWear what inspires you. Experiment. Nothing is set in stone.\n\n*I do not take credit for any Sophia Bush images used.*\n\n-<3-\n\nSo I’ve been seeing a lot of hype swirling around The CW’s newest hit series Jane the Virgin. The lead actress Gina Rodriguez even won a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actress in a Television Series- Musical or Comedy. So I was curious as to what it was about. I’ll admit when I first saw the promos for it back in the summer/fall. I was like what? a pregnant virgin? and that title….is stupid. What the heck? She was artificially inseminated by accident? What? How is this even going to work? Are you just going to ask me to suspend reality, here? (Something I’m totally cool with by the way…so I was IN.)\n\nSo the other day I found myself bored and so I checked my on demand and there they were episodes of Jane the Virgin, right there in front of me. Waiting to be watched. So I dove in. And man oh man was I impressed.\n\nJane the Virgin was loosely adapted from a Venezuelan telenovela. Which explains a lot; namely the many artistic liberties they take when it comes to storytelling.\n\nI’m not going to give too much away, but I will tell you that there are twists and turns every single episode. You will not see them coming. Even all my years of watching soap operas, haven’t prepared me for this.\n\nThe formula they use for this show, is really very unique. I personally haven’t really seen it done. They basically throw you in this weird unrealistic situation and make it believable. It’s basically a more modernized telenovela/soap opera showcased in the form of a TV comedy drama series. In fact each episode is a chapter. Like in a romance novel.\n\nThe story is set in Miami, and follows Jane Gloriana Villanueva. Jane is a 23 year old woman studying to become a teacher when she really dreams of being a writer. She works part time as a waitress for a snazzy hotel with her friends, is dating an adorable cop, and is surrounded by a loving yet strictly religious grandmother and very promiscuous yet loving mother. Jane is a Latina, with a strong religious upbringing. Her grandmother only speaks Spanish, and we can read her words through English subtitles. Jane and her family love their telenovela. And they sit and watch it together as she falls into the story, eating up every word. You can tell she loves them. Little did she know she’d soon be living her very own version of one.\n\nThe Spanish culture is subtle yet rich. I don’t find it obnoxiously stereotypical like some TV shows can be. I really appreciate it, because I’m part Puerto Rican and I didn’t grow up learning to speak Spanish, but I wish I did. So this show kind of gives me this taste of a part of my culture, and I feel a connection to it. And I mean Jane wants to be a writer, so right there, I knew I could relate to her on some human level.\n\nThere’s also “stats” that show up on the screen accompanied by the sound of a type writer as the words spell out character backgrounds. Every time a new character is introduced it’s like a pause comes over and the words scroll across supplying you with the information you need. It sounds weird but it’s actually very cool, and not annoying or disruptive at all. You have to watch it to understand. This technique is also used to share the characters inner secrets and struggles to the audience. The show also has a voice over/narrator with a heavy Spanish accent that tells you the story from the very beginning and keeps you clued into the ever changing developments. He’s actually quite funny and makes me laugh. Often times they have flashbacks to when Jane was young, explaining why the current situation is the current situation and where certain feelings and actions stem from.\n\nMoving onto the character development. Each character has a colorful past, and many layers to them. Jane herself is known as the all-around good girl, which instantly makes her likeable. She has a sweet face and a kind heart and you just feel good watching her. You feel for her, when this extreme event gets thrown into her lap… pun intended. Because she was in no way expecting this, at all…hence she’s a virgin who has been saving herself for her future husband. Basically trying to do everything right, to avoid any derailments in her life timeline. And yet boom the train goes off the track. But how she handles it all really shows that this character has potential to be a healthy, positive role model for young girls. Watch Gina Rodriguez’s inspirational acceptance speech.\n\nBut of course the father of the baby has his own crazy story and his identity comes as a surprise to Jane too. And is a very sexy surprise for the audience as well. Our eyes thank you.\n\nAnyway what I really love about the character of Jane is that she’s got her beliefs and she doesn’t let anyone or anything shake them. In fact her conscience follows her, and they display it in certain scenes where she thinks she sees one thing but it’s really something else. It’s like a small hallucination, to make sure she always does the right thing. Lying doesn’t come naturally to her. She can’t keep things from her family. She’s kind-hearted, she’s smart, she’s driven. And she’s beautiful but it’s a very natural beauty. She’s never overdone, but she always looks amazing. And she is not a skinny mini. She’s got a curvy figure. Which is absolutely accurate, 1) because Latina girls have curves people. And 2) she’s going to be pregnant for 9 months. So her being skinny mini on either account would be unbelievable. Well the whole scenario of her being a virgin and then randomly getting pregnant due to an accidental artificial insemination, is extremely unbelievable. But somehow this show makes it work. They make it human, and you just let it be.\n\nI don’t know watching it I just felt like once you get past the weird factor you just dive into the story. And every character is a shock, they all relate to each other is some strange way. It’s a really cool story, a really cool formula, and a really interesting concept. And the writing mixture of wit and drama is beautiful. It’s so heavy the things Jane has the go through and how many twists and turns get thrown at her and in her way, but they keep it light somehow. And she remains likeable because she always tries to be kind in her attempts. Her intention is always good.\n\nThe acting just works, all the characters fit and it just works. There’s good chemistry and that’s a huge TV perk. Never the less it’s no surprise that this pregnancy is going to weigh on Jane’s relationship with her cop boyfriend, especially when the baby’s father wants to be involved in her pregnancy. I mean can you blame him? It’s human. Thus snowballing into a possible love triangle? It’s a writer’s dream when your audience starts lobbying for their chosen sides. Those reactions and initiating of teams are just proof that you’re doing something right. You’re drawing the audience in.\n\nI just found out that on January 15, 2015, Jane the Virgin was already renewed for a second Season. So cheers to more drama, more laughs, and more beautiful moments with Rafael. Because let’s be honest he is abnormally gorgeous. Team Rafael (baby daddy) right here. A family should stay together, no matter how random or unexpected the pairing was. Although I do feel for Michael (cop bf), poor guy loves her so much. So much has happened to and between these characters, and it’s only the first season. But as storytelling goes, I am sure there’s definitely more love triangle potential in the future of the show. Watching it, I was reminded of Fox’s Ugly Betty, which I loved. And I literally said that and then two seconds later the dad from Ugly Betty popped on screen as Jane’s priest! Small world!\n\nJane the Virgin in currently on YouTube, Free on demand, Hulu, and The CWtv website.\n\nHowever, I just started watching few days ago and tonight the show is on Episode 11/ Chapter 11. The websites and on demand do not have all the episodes up though. Just a select few. So I resorted to watching the first 4 on demand, then watching the rest on various YouTube accounts, which was a pain in the butt, because the subtitles were cut out of the frame, so I couldn’t understand what Abuela was saying!!!! But I got through it and I basically got all caught up! Except for Episode 8, I cannot find it anywhere, I have watched everything before it and after it, so I know what’s going on. But I would still like to watch the episode. Anybody have any links, no downloads or payment fees though. 😉\n\nJane the Virgin airs Mondays @ 9pm on The CW.\n\nSuper excited for the next chapter!\n\n* I take no credit for any images used. *\n\n-<3-\n\nI dedicate this to my continuous love of television and storytelling. Television has always been close to my heart. When I was growing up we didn’t actually have cable tv in our home, so I was a big fan of FOX and The WB (turned The CW). But when I was in junior high school I fell in love with the Disney channel and all its gloriousness; and in walked Lizzie McGuire. I remember locking myself in my Cousin’s room at my Aunt’s house and just watching for hours. They had cable and I had to take advantage. Granted I got yelled at a lot by my mom for being anti-social. But looking back now TV was an outlet. An outlet to express emotion and storytelling. I may not have known all the way back then that I wanted to be a writer of television (and film) but maybe it was my gateway to a dream that would captivate my heart for years to come.\n\nThen came along a little show called One Tree Hill. And this is where the idea of directing and behind the scenes stuff really became of interest to me. I was completely obsessed with this show’s story and its characters. I was interested in how they came up with the ideas and would often watch behind the scenes footage and listen to commentary. I was just as interested in what the creator had to say as I was interested in what the cast/actors had to say. My best friend was equally obsessed, we used to have weekly viewing parties and watch together. Gosh I miss that! Time flies! Anyway, that led to the discovery of fanfiction (which if you don’t know is a place where fans write fiction stories about their favorite characters on their favorite tv shows…and then post them online to share with other like-minded fans…) No I never posted I would just write them (pen and paper, the good old fashioned way). My best friend and I began writing stories based on the One Tree Hill characters and would exchange them during school. This I think is where my love of writing really started. So thank you Mark Schwahn for paving the way, and thank you Roe for being my first critic. 😉\n\nTV allows you to feel.\n\nIt expands reality.\n\nIt’s an escape.\n\nIt’s a new world we get to live in and love in and experience that all, as a part of the show.\n\nAs the audience we want to see the drama unfold but we also want to see realistic aspects and bits and pieces of ourselves in these characters.\n\nThat’s how we relate.\n\nThe content has to be human.\n\nSo what makes a good show (not necessarily a successful show because I’ve seen some really great stories cancelled before they got their chance)… but what I think makes a good show is finding a way to fuse the two; to incorporate real life into this television dream land of sorts.\n\nI mean television life is way sexier but that’s just because it has to be.\n\nWhat do I watch you ask?\n\nWell let me break down *my TV show schedule* for you…\n\nMonday\n\nThe Fosters @8 abcfamily\n\nEye Candy @10 MTV\n\nTuesday\n\nPretty Little Liars @8 abcfamily\n\nMarried At First Sight-First Year @9 FYI\n\nChicago Fire @10 NBC*\n\nWednesday\n\nMelissa & Joey @8 abcfamily\n\nBaby Daddy @8:30 abcfamily\n\nChicago PD @10 NBC\n\nThe Game @10 BET*\n\nThursday\n\nThe Vampire Diaries @8 The CW\n\nGrey’s Anatomy @8 ABC*\n\nScandal @9 ABC\n\nHow To Get Away With Murder @10 ABC\n\nFriday\n\nHart of Dixie @8 The CW\n\nGlee @9 FOX\n\nSaturday\n\n*NONE* I take a day off 😉\n\nSunday\n\nThe Walking Dead @9 AMC\n\nThe Talking Dead @10 AMC\n\nRevenge @10 ABC\n\nGirls @9 HBO*\n\n*– means I try to keep up with them but don’t always get the chance. The others I make sure to fit in!\n\n**Other shows I watch that are on hiatus/available on NetFlix\n\nFinding Carter -MTV\n\nAwkward -MTV\n\nFaking It -MTV\n\nYoung & Hungry -abcfamily\n\nBates Motel -FX\n\nOrange is the New Black *Netflix\n\nLost *Netflix (still have to finish this series!)\n\nWhen it comes to storytelling I become a giddy school girl. Fangirling is for real. My favorite thing about TV and movies is their ability to tell a good love story. But I love TV even more than film because TV is allowed the time to tell the ins and outs and ups and downs of building relationships. I’m a sucker for a well-played out love story. I love the “couple’s timeline.” You know First Meeting, First Date, First Kiss, First I Love You’s, First Time…. It’s pure magic. And when two actors really have good chemistry on screen, it’s even better! I love watching it all unfold. I love the couple names, you know when you take half of one name and combine it with the other half of the other person’s name. Watching tv is when I get to become a fan again. An audience member again, (not that I won’t critique the scenes, but I will be able to enjoy the story).\n\nI remember watching One Tree Hill and being at the edge of my seat or standing on my couch during scenes of The Walking Dead. I am very obnoxiously eccentric when I watch TV. And it’s not because I’m trying to be, I’m just excited about the story. I just can’t help it. I guess I’m just so absorbed, I feel I have to dance or scream to let out my happiness, lol! I really should be filmed while watching certain shows, because I am sure it would be hilarious. In fact just this week I was in a frenzy watching Chicago PD, yes it’s an action show, so there’s definitely that. But Sophia Bush’s (also known as Brooke Davis from One Tree Hill) character Detective Erin Lindsay has been having this ongoing flirtation with her partner Detective Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer) since Season 1. Now we are in Season 2, and these two have yet to get even close to starting something. They had went out once, and decided they were friends and partners and that it wouldn’t be wise to start something in the work place. P.S. their boss a.k.a. Det. Lindsay’s father figure wasn’t gonna have it in his unit. So now Lindsay traded up to a position on a task force and she and Halstead no longer work together…so what do you think happened…use your imagination or watch this and freak the f out like I did. #Linstead. I ship them. I was nearly standing on my bed, screaming, dancing, climbing, and jumping… all the verbs. I was so excited to see all the friendship, care and flirtation that had been building for over a season be positioned into something so great. It was a tasteful love scene too, so props! The cast does a live tweet during the show, so I was literally a frenzied ball of tweets and screams. And now I sit here dying to know what’s going to happen with them this coming Wednesday. That’s good tv, that’s when you know the people involved know what they’re doing. That is what TV does for me. And you can call it weird or obsessive but I call it passionate research.\n\nSo I will continue being very vocal, I will continue to yell at my TV (same goes for scary films, I can’t go to see those in theaters I scream and do the running man in my seat.) My brother always laughs at me and my mom he says we are the best people to watch scary movies with because of our reactions. I got it from my momma. 😉\n\nNotice my TV schedule as of the moment is extensive. It’s a lot to keep up with and I don’t have DVR or TiVo so thank tech gods for free on demand and the internet. YouTube is a godsend, haha. Like I said, I don’t call this obsession, I call it research. No shame. TV is where I wanna be. My ultimate dream is to write for a TV show and eventually be able to executive produce and create my own. I’ve been writing bits and bobs of one for years! Until then! 😀\n\n**R.I.P**\n\nto the fallen TV shows who got axed before their peak…\n\nit’s just like they stopped and I was left wondering well what happened next? That is honestly the WORST feeling. As a writer I could only imagine how unsettling it would feel to put your whole heart into something and then not get to finish telling your story. I think that’s partly why my blog posts end up always being so damn long! haha.\n\nBeautiful People -abcfamily\n\nPrivileged -The WB\n\nJane By Design -abcfamily *this one still stings\n\nThe Carrie Diaries -The CW\n\nManhattan Love Story -ABC *its new episodes were released on Hulu and abc.com and on demand.
