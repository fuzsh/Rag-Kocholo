        "text": "(this is a re-post in honor of the 5th anniversary of the One Tree Hill Series Finale)\n\nThis is it friends. Our very last HAPPY OTH WEDNESDAY!!\n\nI usually start my recaps off with a review of what happened last week and what I think might be coming this week but since this is the very final One Tree Hill recap I will ever write, I wanted to say a little something. I have so many tears in my eyes I can hardly see to type this but here goes:\n\nTo my OTH family: Thank you. Thank you for reading these recaps and all of my other articles. Thank you for sharing them with your friends. For leaving the most amazing comments. Thank you for talking to me on Twitter. For answering my questions. For laughing with me and crying with me. I am very new to this family but each and every one of you has welcomed me with open arms. I could not be more grateful. The One Tree Hill family has given me one of the most amazing fandom experiences I have ever had. I will always look back on this time with love in my heart and a smile on my face and it is all because of YOU. You have shared with me the love of these characters, the love of these stories and the love for one another. This ride with y’all has been so much fun! I would not trade this experience for anything and I am going to miss this part of my week more than I can express. And while I was late in joining the OTH party, I will be forever thankful that I was able to watch this last season live with all of you. It has honestly been life changing in the very best way. I have been overwhelmed by the love you have shown me. From the bottom of my ever grateful heart, thank you. A million times, thank you.\n\nNow then. Here we go!!! My final OTH recap!!! The wine IV has been set up. Hope you all are mentally holding my hand right now!\n\n***Hour One***\n\n· I know I am not the only one already losing it completely. This first hour is going to be brutal. Absolute murder.\n\n· And the husband’s eyes are already rolling. Also, he’s reminding me that the man doing the voice over is the same guy who narrates Gangland on Spike TV.\n\n· All of these past scenes they are showing are making this so beautiful but SO much harder to watch. Is it possible to love something this much while hating it at the same time?\n\n· RIVER COURT!!!! *sob* I just want to live there!! I would even sleep outside! And I do NOT camp.\n\n· “It’s nice to hear that it’s going to be ok.” SO MUCH WORD MARK!!!\n\n· Is that “Always & Forever” on the title card really necessary? So many feels!!!\n\n· Kate Voegele’s voice is so magical that it makes my heart swell. I have chills.\n\n· Loving all of these stories and all of this fan appreciation.\n\n· And of course they have to talk the most about the episodes that made me cry the very hardest. So many powerful moments.\n\n· KEITH! Holy lord the tears. The way that OTH has handled loss has been such a beautiful thing to me. One of the things I love most about it. And I am so grateful that they did exactly what they did.\n\n· The way that these actors talk about their characters shows so much love and respect. I am in awe.\n\n· This season 9 overview is perfect. I am so thankful for it. I have loved every minute.\n\n· I can’t handle the cast choking up. All of their emotion. THE HUGS. The ache in my chest!\n\n· All of these MOMENTS! GAH! It reminds me that sometimes watching this show is like getting a hug when you really need one.\n\n· BTW, I REALLY need one right now. BAWLING MY EYES OUT!\n\n***Hour Two***\n\n· NATHAN!! Oh my. “Someday is today.”\n\n· And BROOKE!! “Say it. Do it.”\n\n· HALEY!!! GEEZ LOUISE!!!\n\n· NALEY!!!! GAH!! And the predictions!!\n\n· (also, hello arm porn)\n\n· Um, you guys. This just keeps getting harder as it goes on. I am a huge MESS of emotions right now. So, yeah. Sorry for all of the outbursts and exclamation points.\n\n· Laughing my butt off!!! Chris Keller is the best! Poor Chase. I probably would have peed the bed after that little surprise.\n\n· Mouth & Millie. Way too cute.\n\n· I want to rip Nathan’s jersey off the wall just so I can hug it and never let it go. But since I cannot do that, may it hang forever.\n\n· I LOVE Blind Pilot. So great.\n\n· Haley is totally talking to us, isn’t she? I think she is.\n\n· Thank GOD for Chris Keller. I really needed these laughs. Tyler Hilton is so brilliant.\n\n· HEY! What I do matters too!! Right? Can I have $500,000.00?? Mouth totally earned that though.\n\n· HJS singing on stage. It does not get much better than this. Joy’s voice is heaven.\n\n· UGH! Felix! Hate that guy! Love you Mouth. “Doesn’t matter.”\n\n· I am so relieved that Chase’s drinks are still gross. And excuse me while I DIE from laughing at that slap. “Devil’s ass.”\n\n· And then Clay too!! My stomach aches from cracking up so hard.\n\n· Logan. SO CUTE IT HURTS. Also, love Clay quoting himself from season 8 when Nathan called him weird.\n\n· “Dad.” I die.\n\n· Is there anything more beautiful than Nathan’s face as he watches Haley sing? I think not friends. Except maybe the way she sounds.\n\n· Oh my God!!! His guitar! From 3×09!!! Awwww!! Nathan really is the very best there is! As are these Chris Keller/Nathan moments. So sweet and funny and darling!\n\n· LOVE this jam! SO SEXY! I am dancing in my chair. No, really. I’m quite good.\n\n· The web site sales!!! Just like the very first Clothes over Bros!! Where’s the child labor though?\n\n· The father/son moments on this show are some of my favorites. And Nathan is just SO great at this. SO GREAT!!!!! I’m gonna start crying again.\n\n· BEVIN!!!!! SO MUCH CLAPPING!!!! I guess Tim didn’t work out? LOL\n\n· Clay is Ah-Ma-Zing. And extremely hilarious. The crack head show does sound like fun.\n\n· “Mom.” I die. Again.\n\n· This bromance between Chase and Chris: I never saw it coming. And yet it is one of my favorite things. If they ended up with those twins it would be the best thing ever.\n\n· THE NOTEBOOK!!! YES!!!!!!\n\n· “Chris Keller’s work here is done!” Something I will now say every single time I finish something. Even if I’m saying it only to myself.\n\n· The book. From the Pilot. *sob*\n\n· This trip down memory lane that Brooke & Haley are taking together is so heartfelt and comforting and SO much what their friendship is: Beautiful.\n\n· Chris Keller & Haley James Scott are making me want to hug the whole world wearing a rainbow sweater.\n\n· GAVIN!!\n\n· Okay. Here we go. Naley time. I may be a tad hysterical for this bit.\n\n· MAC AND CHEESE AND CRACKER JACKS! AND A NEW BRACELET AND I AM CRYING SO HARD!!!\n\n· Those James girls are just the most beautiful criers. This is so amazing!! It’s perfect for them. For all 3 of them. And there’s confetti. Of course there is.\n\n· Mouth’s speech is hitting me really hard. And his scholarship? Edwards Scott. WOW.\n\n· Aaaaaaaaand here we go. Be still my heart. It’s racing. And not from drugs. OMG. I can’t breathe from the Naley. I can’t breathe from the goodness. From the perfection. Lord thunderin Jesus.\n\n· Brooke. And her house. And she gets to be The Girl Behind the Red Door. Because Julian is amazing. I am crying so hard that there are no longer sounds coming out.\n\n· And the hits just keep coming. Thank you Evans Family.\n\n· The passing of the prediction torch. The next generation.\n\n· OH MY GOD HALEY! “There’s only one Tree Hill. And it is your home.”\n\n· Oh B. Davis. Please don’t cry. I can’t handle it.\n\n· “I DON’T WANNA BE ANYTHING OTHER THAN ME!”\n\n· The whole family!!! They are all together. And every single tiny bit of it is perfect. The singing and the playing and the kids and the sharing. And all at Karen’s. I couldn’t smile harder or cry harder if my life depended on it.\n\n· The future. The song. The flashbacks. The voice over. The old quote. The love. The Ravens. “Believe in it. With all your heart.”\n\nPerfect. Brilliant. Beautiful. Amazing.\n\nSomehow all of these words seem totally inadequate and yet they are all I have left. It was everything and then some. Thank you show.\n\nGood night friends. Good night OTH Family. Good night Tree Hill.\n\n3×08 – “The Worst Day Since Yesterday”\n\nOverview: Brooke deals with the fallout of sleeping with Chris Keller, Karen deals with Dan and everyone prepares for the first Ravens game of the season.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nLucas is allowed to be grossed out about Chris Keller but he’s not allowed to be mad. He and Brooke were not together.\n\nNathan Scott is my favorite. All protective over Brooke. And threatening Chris Keller. It’s so hot. “I like to think of that as hitting you. Without the hitting.”\n\nWho wouldn’t vote for Karen? She is a gem.\n\nJust the thought of Dan wanting or trying to hurt Nathan makes me want to throw him off a bridge. Such an abusive bastard.\n\nWatching Nathan & Haley have a civilized conversation at this point makes me so happy. I DON’T ASK FOR MUCH.\n\nKaren Roe for PRESIDENT. When she messes up that quote about getting under someone? I die. She is hilarious.\n\nLOL at Whitey making Tim wear 0 after he gets 55 tattooed on himself. Whitey is kind of the best.\n\nIf Danneel was cheering for me, I would have a really hard time concentrating. Lady is a bombshell. I love her.\n\nI crack up laughing every time Nathan nails Chris in the face with the ball. And then he laughs at Lucas and is SO cute.\n\nSo when Nathan calls Haley right away after talking to her so that they can walk together, I start crying and making these strange noises because OH MY GOD THEY ARE SO PRECIOUS.\n\nGo Mouth. Getting Dan beating up his kid on tape is super rad.\n\nBest Bit: James’ impression of CMM is SPOT ON and PERFECT and I could watch it forever. Seriously. I just die. Over and over. Also, his buzz cut is so damn sexy.\n\nUgh! Moment: Dan going after Nathan in the locker room. It makes my blood boil and I just want to KILL him. Such a dick.\n\nFave Quote: “Quit looking at Keller. We already know he can score.” Snarky Nathan is amazing.\n\nBiggest Question: How come the team didn’t make Lucas join in with the shaved heads thing? He probably needs it more than anyone eles!\n\nOn My iPod: “Song Beneath The Song” by Maria Taylor & “The Mixed Tape” by Jack’s Mannequin\n\n3×09 – “How a Resurrection Really Feels”\n\nOverview: The election comes to a close, the investigation into who tried to kill Dan heats up, and Nathan hits the road with Chris Keller.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\n“I guess we know who the cellblock tough’s gonna be.” Brooke is hilarious. I don’t think they would have been put into jumpsuits, though.\n\nWhen I first thought Nathan was telling this stuff to Haley, I got really upset. Thank GOD it was just Chris Keller.\n\nI remember wanting to know who was on that tape SO BAD. It was murder waiting to find out. Not sure I ever pegged Deb, though.\n\nI love Marty and I LOVE that he was mentioned again in Season 9. Hilarious.\n\nThe birth of Clothes over Bros!!! Awwwwwww!!!! The unnecessary apostrophe really bothers me, though.\n\nEvery interaction between Nathan and Chris Keller is priceless. They are incredible together. No wonder James had so much fun filming this episode. It’s so much fun to watch!\n\nAfter hearing “Halo” for the first time, I sang it non-stop in my head FOR MONTHS. Killer jam.\n\n“Chris Keller’s work here is done.” Farewell Chris Keller (for now).\n\nI can never decide whether or not I like Peyton’s inner conversations with her Halloween self.\n\nI feel so bad for Brooke. Lucas really dicked her over and she was just trying to protect her heart and he couldn’t handle it. What an ass. Glad he finally got over himself.\n\nBest Bit: I BET YOU’LL NEVER GUESS. Sweet reunion heaven. Everything about it is perfect. The way they look at each other, their kissing. The recreation of the scene at the door when Nathan asks if he can stay with her in “With Arms Outstretched.” And then oh my God she pulls him down by his wedding ring on the chain. LORD HAVE MERCY I JUST CAN’T TAKE IT. THE FEELINGS ARE TOO MUCH.\n\nUgh! Moment: I hate being reminded that it wasn’t Nathan who kissed Haley while wearing the batman costume. Bad times, man. Also, Karen should have won the election.\n\nFave Quote: “Haley. Stay with me tonight.” I JUST DIE A BILLION TIMES OMG.\n\nBiggest Question: Do we really believe that Brooke could have made THOSE dresses, by herself, in that short amount of time?\n\nOn My iPod: “For Blue Skies” by Strays Don’t Sleep & “Halo” by Bethany Joy Lenz\n\n3×10 – “Brave New World”\n\nOverview: Deb confesses to Nathan, Lucas helps Peyton find Ellie and Brooke officially launches Clothes Over Bro’s.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI love starting the episode with Naley kisses. With them in bed together. It just makes me so happy.\n\nDan is so fucking creepy. Picking up Haley’s bra? Talking about Peyton? Stealing Nathan’s note for Haley? Ugh. That guy. Gross.\n\n“You called me 17 minutes ago and I DRIVE a bicycle.” I love Mouth. Brooke doesn’t appreciate him enough.\n\nI am glad that Peyton sought out and found Ellie. I love this storyline of hers!!\n\nOn the other hand, I could not care less about Lucas and his friends who are not in Tree Hill.\n\nI hate Dan but Nathan is right, what he screams at Deb. “You don’t have the courage to leave him but you have the courage to kill him?” GO NATHAN. Deb will never win a mother of the year award.\n\nI love that Haley told Brooke to stop being such a bitch to everyone who was working so hard. Brooke really needed to hear that. She was acting like a real d-bag.\n\nBest Bit: I love that Nathan came home from that horrible time with his mom and wanted to see Haley right away. Be still my heart!\n\nUgh! Moment: Lucas really left Brooke in bed to go do something with the girl that broke them up in the first place??? I’m all about Leyton but Lucas can be such a tool.\n\nFave Quote: Ida Scott Taylor once wrote, “Do not look back and grieve over the past, for it is gone and do not be troubled for the future for it is yet to come. Live in the present and make it so beautiful that it will be worth remembering.”\n\nBiggest Question: Didn’t Brooke make those other dresses in her bedroom in like 3 hours? What happened to her magic powers?\n\nOn My iPod: “Sugar, We’re Goin’ Down” by Fall Out Boy & “Halo” by Bethany Joy Lenz\n\n3×11 – “Return of the Future”\n\nOverview: The Ravens are losing, Peyton & Ellie are working on their album and Haley and Nathan try and navigate more rough waters.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nDan is gross. And is so sheisty. Hate that guy so much. SCREW HIM for trying to make problems between Nathan & Haley. UGH!\n\nKEITH!! So good to see his face. SO GOOD. I never realize how much I miss that guy until I see him again.\n\n“Kiss first.” Haley. You are my spirit animal. Never change.\n\nNATHAN! You fucking a-hole. IT TAKES TWO!! Why does SHE have to be in charge of the birth control? DO NOT BE YOUR FATHER’S SON!\n\nDid I mention that Whitey is the best? I wish he could coach all of my teams. They would always win!!\n\nLucas is such a douche. Teasing Brooke about the letters that she put so much of her heart into? Fuck Lucas.\n\nKaren & Keith make me all melty. They are so precious and sweet.\n\nThis argument between Nathan & Haley is so rough. Really hard to hear. But I know it has been played out before. I hate that Nathan is letting Dan get into his head. I hate that he is acting like Dan in how he is talking to Haley. Haley made a mistake.\n\n“Here’s an idea. If you don’t want to be like Dan, don’t.” I love Haley James Scott SO DAMN MUCH.\n\nGO KAREN!! Kiss the HELL out of Keith!! ABOUT DAMN TIME!\n\nBest Bit: Lucas and Nathan finding their rhythm on the new/old court. Just like the old Boston Garden. (I may be Boston biased).\n\nUgh! Moment: I hate it when Nathan and Haley fight but I especially hate it when they are fighting because he is being a jerk. He’s so much better than Dan. He just needs to remember that ALL the time.\n\nFave Quote: after seeing Dan, Whitey: (I thought we killed all the cockroaches.)\n\nOn My iPod: “Concrete Bed” by Nada Surf, “You Wanted It” by MoZella, “Always Love” by Nada Surf & “The Blues” by Switchfoot\n\nToday marks the one year anniversary of the very last episode of One Tree Hill. And while I was late to the party, I always felt like a welcomed guest. I cannot believe that 365 days have passed since we were all together, in the same place, via our television screens. I was so emotional about losing the show a week after the finale aired (you can read all about that here) and I find myself feeling those same feelings again today. I still refuse to delete the finale from my TiVo. The show has had such an impact on me, I felt it was only right to put together a bit of a tribute in honor of this special day.\n\nThe time that we’ve spent together over the years has meant so much. And without you, we would not be here tonight. Thank you. This night is yours, this night is ours, and it’s full of all kinds of surprises.\n\nBefore you continue reading this post, I suggest you make a playlist of the following songs, put them on repeat and sing along with me (while we all cry, obviously).\n\n“Half Moon” by Blind Pilot\n\n“Blue Skies” by Bethany Joy Lenz\n\n“Loaded Gun” by Tyler Hilton\n\n“Solider” by Gavin DeGraw\n\n“I Don’t Wanna Be” by Gavin DeGraw\n\n“One Tree Hill” by U2\n\nI had the amazing opportunity to recap all of the season 9 episodes and share with you all of my thoughts, feelings, questions, and hopes. Those posts no longer exist but the memory of discussing every moment with you, is fresh in my mind. Being a part of the OTH Family is one of the most positive fandom experiences I have ever had. I want to take this opportunity to thank each and every one of you, again, for making it such a wonderful time for me. I connected with so many friends through this show, friends I continue to connect with a year later. Not many television shows can inspire such loyalty, such love, such devotion. So many of you grew up with One Tree Hill. I was blessed enough to be allowed to tag along for the end of the ride. I thank you for that.\n\nIt’s the oldest story in the world. One day, you’re seventeen and planning for someday. And then quietly without you really noticing, someday is today, and then someday is yesterday. And this is your life.\n\nNot only does this show have an amazing group of fans, it also has an incredible cast. So many of them tweeted their experiences during their final days of shooting One Tree Hill, and so many of them were kind enough to share their time with us. My two favorites spoke to us on the night of the finale. Looking back on their tweets makes my heart ache.\n\nSophia Bush shared this today. How great is it that she is still feeling and sharing the OTH love as much as we are?\n\nOne thing the fans of this show brought to me, something that made me love OTH and the fandom even more, were the fan vids. I have posted just a few of my faves for you (in no particular order) below. If you have already seen them, I hope you enjoy watching them all over again. If you have not, get your tissues ready. They still make me emotional to this day.\n\nIf you had a friend you knew you’d never see again, what would you say? If you could do one last thing for someone you love, what would it be? Say it. Do it. Don’t wait. Nothing lasts forever.\n\nWhen I first began speaking to other fans about One Tree Hill, I was taken aback by level of love and devotion that people had for a show that critics loathed and the networked seemed less than excited to hold on to. There is a reason this show lasted as long as it did. It wasn’t just the real and heartfelt stories, told beautifully by the actors portraying favorite characters, it was because of the passion and adoration of the fans. They worked hard to keep their show and followed it through to the end.\n\nMake a wish, and place it in your heart. Anything you want, everything you want. Do you have it? Good. Now believe it can come true. You never know where the next miracle’s gonna come from. The next memory. The next smile. The next wish come true. But if you believe that it’s right around the corner… You open your heart and mind to the possibility of it, to the certainty of it. You just might get the thing you wishin’ for. The world is full of magic. You just have to believe in it. So make your wish. Do you have it? Good. Now believe in it. With all your heart.\n\nThis last week, in preparation for today’s anniversary, I asked all of you to submit to me your thoughts and feelings about what One Tree Hill means to you, one year later. I was so moved by everything you all shared with me. I loved reading about how this little television show shaped and changed your lives, and continues to do so today. My life has been molded and inspired by getting to talk with all of you. Thank you to everyone who submitted their wonderful words:\n\n@Jennabeans24 – how about one word? Everything. I will carry OTH with me for the rest of my life. This show helped shape me. I wouldn’t be who I am without it. Plain & simple.\n\n@EmilyLatka – I had OTH from 15 to 23. It got me through my cancer treatments, life changes, & friend changes.”Sometimes they come back.”\n\n@yellowmonkey26 – we have all grown with these characters, cried with them laughed with them, this show will always be my favourite 🙂\n\n@kairelovesoth – Seems unfair we have 2 live w/out this perfect show! Life’s emptier 4 sure! I will always cherish my time in TreeHill! #oth\n\n@SophiaBushFan10 – #OTH will always be there like the old friend you turn to for comfort. Mark created something timeless.\n\n@Zhezal – One Tree Hill still means everything to me. The show has taught me so many things about life.I will never forget OTH<3 #home\n\n@NoelElaineOTH – #OTH is my heart, my comfort, my therapy, my soul. It makes me brave. It has saved me over & over. It’s everything. Still.\n\n@othsavedme – OTH has made me see that anything is possible. Love happiness pain suffering joy and tears are a part of life that is normal. It’s the best thing to have happened to me. It saved my soul. OTH has made me who I am. I miss it every day. Every single person who made OTH what it is will always mean so much to me.\n\n@AlineBouDiwan – #OTH has gotten me through my happiest & hardest times. It makes me believe in love, hope, happiness & dreams coming true. And a grin like Julian’s (seriously though).\n\n@RiverCourtSML – A year later I still miss it everyday, but all that magic is still with me & all the lessons guide me through everyday life.\n\n@OTHLOVER_ – #OTH means everything to me! A year without it has been tough, but I will never forget it, it lives in my heart Forever.\n\n@TheStyles83 – We Love One Tree Hill.\n\n@LoVyAMB – a lot! It means hope, inspiration, emotion… I am who I am thanks to this show…\n\n@s9onetreehill – it means everything. Maybe now more than ever because the lessons are so meaningful now that the show is over.\n\n@natcfc – OTH CHANGED MY LIFE. i’m a better person because of it, I’ve met awesome people because of it and I’m sure that my life can be separated pre/ pos OTH. I miss it everyday and I’m more grateful everyday that i got to watch it.\n\n@LauraOthLover1 – OTH saved me and gave me hope when I was going give up on this life OTH found words that I felt but was scared to say them.\n\n@ali_lauren1 – there are now words that describe what #OTH meant to me. :’)\n\n@alovelybean – One year later, One Tree Hill remains the constant in life. whatever comes my way… OTH is there & I find an understanding in it. Not only has it helped to shape who I am by growing up with me, but I will always come back to it when new challenges confront me in life. OTH is my love & my home.\n\n@KristenMichele6 – it still means everything – it was so much more than a show and it always will be. OTH means family, more now than ever.\n\n@JhieWeez – #OTH is simply life changing. The stories and characters are easy to relate to. It will forever be my all time fave show!\n\n@jenileesk8 – it is still a show i will never get tired of. Gave me actors i will always love and music i will never stop listening to!\n\nI still sometimes sit alone, iPod playing my favorite OTH songs (“Do you take the non believers?”) and I think about where our favorite characters are today. Do Nathan and Haley have more kids? Is Haley still making music? Is Brooke still getting along with her parents? Are Chase and Chris Keller making out right this minute? It was such a joy to become a part of these characters lives, to get so swept up in what they were doing, where they were going and whom they were loving. Are you all still wondering about them, too?\n\nIt’s a magical place, son. I’ve seen that magic in your eyes for the last nine years. There’s only one Tree Hill Jamie Scott, and it’s your home.\n\nThank you again to everyone reading and sharing with me. Your constant and continued support means the world. I love you every day. I leave you with one of my very favorite photos, courtesy of my good friend Chelsea who was integral during my OTH mourning period this time last year. Just remember friends, no matter what happens, hold high, have faith. Happy anniversary, OTH Family and once again, Good Night Tree Hill!\n\nDon’t forget to check out the One Tree Hill Retro Recaps!! Currently working on Season 3 and I will continue to add to them as I have time!!\n\nWelcome back to OTH Wednesdays! Thanks for being patient with my absence as I traveled the country over the last few weeks. While I had a wonderful time, it feels great to be back on the job of recapping one of my favorite shows! And, not only is it OTH Wednesday, it’s also the birthday of both Nathan Scott himself, Mr. James Lafferty and the beautiful Shantel VanSanten!! Happy Birthday James & Shantel!!!! Let’s celebrate all this goodness by sobbing our eyes out, shall we?\n\n2×11 – “The Heart Brings You Back”\n\nOverview: Jake is back for Peyton and who knows who Haley’s sister Taylor is back for…\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI swear to GOD when I thought that first flash to Haley on the bus was real I almost kicked a hole in my TV. Thank the heavens it wasn’t. But she still kissed Chris Keller. Again. DAMN IT. And all the while, her husband is waiting at home with a romantic dinner. DAMN IT ALL TO HELL.\n\nTaylor is trouble from the word GO. Wanted to punch that face the moment I saw it. I have good instincts sometimes.\n\nI think I had always missed the part where Jakes says that Lucas called him for Peyton. That was pretty sweet of Lucas.\n\nI’ve told y’all about my thing with the way James says “comfortable,” right? I just LOVE IT SO MUCH!! It’s like seriously a thing I have that I will never get over.\n\nAaaaaaaaaaand Jake spills the beans about Chris Keller & Haley.\n\nScott brother bonding!! My favorite! I literally laugh out loud every time I watch Nathan launch that ball into the river. And then laugh harder when Nathan tells Lucas about losing the V-card to Haley’s sister. It’s just too damn much.\n\n“Usually I get them first.” Poor Nathan. He is a wreck.\n\nPeyton is SO great. I get Anna being confused and everything but she doesn’t deserve a friend like Peyton. I don’t really care for Anna. I’ve said that, right? And I care for Felix even less. WANT TO STAB HIM MANY TIMES!!!!!\n\nThis Nathan and Taylor thing is a giant mess. GIANT MESS. But it’s good for Nathan right now in a way. He has someone to talk to. I guess.\n\nBest Bit: “Hey, do you need some help?” And then Nathan joins Haley in the kitchen and they share that little kiss. And it’s hardly anything. But at the time, it’s everything.\n\nUgh! Moment: Every time Felix is on screen. That guy is beyond help at this point, no matter how many sweet things he says to Brooke.\n\nFave Quote: Lucas: (voiceover)”Tennessee Williams once wrote…When so many are lonely…as seem to be lonely, it would be inexcusably selfish…to be lonely alone.”\n\nOn My iPod: none\n\n2×12 – “Between Order and Randomness”\n\nOverview: Nathan has a secret to share with Haley but Haley has secrets of her own.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\n“We’re family now, we shouldn’t have secrets.” I am pretty sure I would be just fine never knowing how my brothers in law ever lost their virginity. Gross. Nathan’s recovery is AMAZING! “Whoever my first was wasn’t nearly as important as my last.” PERFECT MAN IS PERFECT!!!!\n\nI love Brooke but I could not be less interested in her crab job story line.\n\nDan is such a sleaze bucket. Haven’t these people learned yet that they should question every single one of his motives?\n\nHALEY IS A LIAR!!!!! Damn it Haley. Don’t be emailing Chris! UGH!\n\nNathan is VERY hot when he’s threatening but it doesn’t seem to be having any effect on Taylor who is a giant slut bag. It must be hard not to hit a girl in his situation.\n\nOh Lord. Poor Nathan. Most awkward convo ever. He’s so brave and adorable. I understand Haley getting upset that it was her sister but can she really hold against him what happened before she came along?\n\nI mostly hate Taylor but I love her for calling Haley out on the Chris stuff. Someone needs to.\n\nOf course Haley forgives Nathan. She really kind of has to after what happened between her and Chris. But either way, it warms my heart.\n\nBest Bit: Haley and Nathan walking along the water, hand in hand, stopping to share kisses. Such a sweet moment. And knowing what comes next, a moment I wish I could trap them in forever.\n\nUgh! Moment: Dinner with the elder Scott brothers. Horrible. Uncomfortable. Cringe-worthy. Dan is really THE WORST.\n\nFave Quote: Nathan: “All right, Haley. We got married so quickly, we never really had the talk that most people have when they get engaged. About past relationships… sexual history.” Haley: “Ah, that’s probably because I can give you mine in under ten seconds, while yours is catalogued in the Library of Congress.”\n\nBiggest Question: “Does this mean you didn’t wait for the ring to give it up either?” “I waited until I was in love.” Is Haley saying that she and Nathan did THAT before they got married? This statement has always confused me.\n\nOn My iPod: “Glad” by Tyler Hilton\n\n2×13 – “The Hero Dies In This One”\n\nOverview: Chris Keller is back in town and Haley must make a choice. Lucas makes a choice of his own that upsets everyone except Dan.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nIf Nathan had to find out about Haley emailing Chris Keller at least he did it in a towel. No reason for it to be ALL torture.\n\nHALEY STOP LYING!!! Taylor is definitely to blame for some of it but NOT ALL OF IT!!! DAMN IT!!!\n\nLUCAS STOP LYING!!! My GOD these people are all idiots. Lying is never the answer!!\n\nDan is such a shit head. His double meaning is hidden in everything he says. What an ass. And he is SO GROSS. Was he really hitting on Taylor? Ugh!\n\nNathan is wearing a Celtics shirt. And wearing it SO WELL. I want it. GO BOSTON!\n\nI love the way Peyton introduces Chris Keller. Hilarious. Like she’s touching something dirty as she says his name.\n\nChris Keller the character is the devil but Tyler Hilton is so talented. I love this song he does so much.\n\nAngry, threatening Nathan is SO HOT you guys!! But I cannot handle his face as he watches Haley watch The Wreckers on stage. He’s so afraid of losing her. OUCH!!\n\nGAH!! Nathan!! She was wrong to kiss Chris Keller! Of course she was! But ultimatums are NEVER EVER GOOD EVER!\n\nThis Keane song makes me cry without fail every time. The flash back to their first time there at the dock does not help at all. This is horrible.\n\n*SOB* Will I ever make it through the end of this episode without bawling my face off? GEEZE LOUISE!\n\nBest Bit: There really is no best bit of this episode. The whole thing is painful. But the live music is great. Love both songs.\n\nUgh! Moment: Must I say it? It just hurts SO BAD!!! The yelling! The fighting! The keyboard throwing! The look on Nathan’s face when he knows that Haley is gone! I JUST CAN NOT!!!!!\n\nFave Quote: Peyton: “A kiss always means something.”\n\nOn My iPod: “When It Comes” by Tyler Hilton, “The Good Kind” by The Wreckers & “She Has No Time” by Keane\n\n2×14 – “Quiet Things That No One Ever Knows”\n\nOverview: Everyone is struggling with loss. Nathan is a wreck after losing Haley and Karen after Lucas has moved in with Dan.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nOh God. Poor Nathan. He’s such a mess. It hurts my soul just looking at him.\n\nErica Marsh is a bitch.\n\nNathan rocking bed head while drinking in class would be hilarious if it weren’t so damn tragic.\n\nJake and Peyton and Jenny are SO DAMN CUTE. I just love them. And whitey babysitting? ADORABLE!!!!!\n\n“You got it right Peyton. People always leave.” Break my heart some more why don’t you?\n\nMouth is the sweetest. I just love him. I would totally vote for Brooke after that speech alone.\n\nDamn it Haley! GO HOME! Or at least call your effing husband! GAH!\n\nBrooke’s scene from the series finale!! SO MANY FEELINGS!!!\n\nI absolutely love, love, love this scene with Karen & Nathan. They never get a lot of screen time together but this moment is so perfect. They are both so heartbroken. It’s so painful but so lovely.\n\n“Sometimes they come back.” Awwww!! Thank you Peyton!!!\n\nBest Bit: Another super painful episode but watching Nathan punch Dan in the face feels pretty damn good.\n\nUgh! Moment: Um, every single scene where I have to see the hurt all over Nathan’s face. IT’S SO DAMN HARD!!!!!\n\nFave Quote:\n\nMs. Hand: “Okay, please tell me you are not drinking beer in my class.”\n\nNathan: “Technically, it’s malt liquor…”\n\nMs. Hand: “Nathan!”\n\nNathan: “It’s okay, I brought enough to share.”\n\nMs. Hand: “Come with me, please.”\n\nNathan: “That’s a nice skirt, Ms. Hand. You know, if more teachers dressed like sluts, attendance in this place would skyrocket.”\n\nOn My iPod: “Flying High” by Jem & “Club Foot” by Kasabian\n\nHappy OTH Wednesday!!! And such a happy day it is!! Not only is it an OTH day, it is also my dear friend Jenna’s birthday!! And not just ANY birthday!! It’s her 23rd!!!!! I wish I had happier episodes to share on her special day but I do think it’s appropriate that Jimmy Eat World’s song “23” makes it’s first appearance within this group. Be sure to find her on twitter (@Jennabeans24) and send her happy birthday wishes. LOVE YOU JENNA!! HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!\n\n2×07 – “Let the Reigns Go Loose”\n\nOverview: The opening of Tric creates drama and an opportunity for dreams come true.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\n“Can I be honest with you Dan? You’re creeping everybody out.” I love Karen.\n\nNathan going to visit Whitey in the hospital to talk to him about High Flyers is adorable. I still don’t understand how him going to camp would prevent Haley from pursuing music but it’s sweet just the same.\n\nLMFAO at Keith’s face when he sees that Andy bought Lucas a little kid’s shirt. And then Andy calls him “Little Lucas.” Hilarious.\n\nAaaaaaaand Nathan meets Chris Keller for the first time. Then gives him the first of many “I am going to kill you,” glares without Chris Keller even noticing.\n\nTric’s opening night gives me SO MANY FINALE FEELINGS. It makes my heart ache.\n\nOh Karen. “Free round on the house… of juice!”\n\nNathan’s Haley pride is just OVERWHELMING. My heart can’t take it. I want to SQUEEZE HIM.\n\nI feel bad for Brooke and what she’s going through but I feel worse for Mouth. He deserves better.\n\nHave I mentioned how much I hate Felix & Anna? I feel that it’s worth repeating. Blech.\n\nI love that Nathan is already giving Chris Keller the shifty eyes, even before Chris Keller opens his mouth about everyone wanting to screw Haley. He’s no dummy.\n\nBest Bit: Haley’s first public performance and the look on Nathan’s face as he watches her on stage. Her happy little smile when everyone starts clapping? Beyond wonderful. And I could listen to Joy’s voice forever.\n\nUgh! Moment: Nathan laying in bed in the middle of the night, wondering where Haley is. I can feel his anxiety and I don’t like it.\n\nFave Quote: Chris (to Nathan): “You have any idea how many guys in the room wanna nail your wife right now?”\n\nOn My iPod: “Alive and Amplified” by The Mooney Suzuki\n\n2×08 – “The Truth, Bitter Truth”\n\nOverview: Nathan and Lucas take a road trip with a dual purpose and the girls have a slumber party where the secrets come pouring out.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nNathan and Haley cannot be any effin cuter. “It’s our first night apart since we got married.” GAH. I just love them more than words.\n\nBrooke is so gross sometimes. I would KILL anyone who had sex in my marital bed. KILL. With weapons.\n\nI know that it’s bad for Haley to be working with Chris Keller behind Nathan’s back but they sound so damn good together.\n\nI get tears in my eyes watching Nathan and Lucas watch that basketball game. Y’all know why. “That could be you some day.” SO MANY FEELS!!!!!!\n\nI’m glad that Haley knows that lying to Nathan is dumb. She should also know that Nathan wants for what her whatever she wants for herself. It makes me sad that she doesn’t see that.\n\nI cannot handle the way Nathan talks about Haley. “Basketball was the most important thing to me. Now Haley is.” His love for her is SO HUGE. Just thinking about it is enough to make my heart explode.\n\nThat slumber party would be perfect. Perfect for bonding, a perfect memory. There’s even a pillow fight! If only Anna weren’t there. Ugh.\n\nNathan and Lucas are so adorable on their road trip. And that SONG? So funny. When they sing along I DIE!!!!! Love me some Scott brother love.\n\nBest Bit: Haley, Brooke and Peyton all screaming at each other over each of their respective wrongs. It’s pure comedy. Especially when Haley rips off Brooke’s nose strip and Peyton squeals. HILARIOUS!\n\nUgh! Moment: When Haley lies to Nathan about working with Chris Keller. Absolutely NOTHING GOOD will come of this.\n\nFave Quote: Peyton: “Okay. How wasted does one have to be to go home with one shoe? It’s like, at what point do you look down at your foot and say hmmm… ?”\n\nBiggest Question: What would you do? Have the HCM test or not?\n\nOn My iPod: “When The Stars Go Blue” by Bethany Joy Lenz and Tyler Hilton & “Every Ship Must Sail Away” by Blue Merle\n\n2×09 – “The The Trick Is To Keep Breathing”\n\nOverview: It’s the night of the Tree Hill High Formal and a lot of kept secrets will find their way onto the dance floor.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI swear I cannot stop my eyes from rolling every single time Felix talks. He is RIDICULOUS!\n\nCan’t help but kind of implicate Peyton in this Haley & Chris Keller mess. She insists that they play, right away, and doesn’t say anything when Chris Keller says that rehearsal might dip into the Formal. RUDE.\n\nI can’t handle Nathan’s face or his whine/yell. “Hales!?” When Haley tells him that she has to be late to the formal. His heart is already breaking. I don’t like it.\n\nI want to know what kind of budget Tree Hill High has. My school NEVER had the money to create THAT kind of dance. The half Eifel Tower? COME ON!!\n\nShut up Deb. Showing some concern. Right. Next stop: Mother of the year. No doubt.\n\nI think that’s what I’ll name my first album: “Better Than Crap.”\n\nNEVER, in their entire time in Tree Hill do I want to stab Felix and Anna more than when they take turns using “gay” and “lesbian” in order to insult Peyton. NOTHING about it is ok. The two of them were clearly raised by psycho bigots. I would have said raised by animals but I would never insult animals that way. They are just HORRIBLE human beings. I expect it from Felix but Anna? After Peyton went out of her way to make her feel welcome? WEAK AND DISGUSTING!\n\nBrooke is a bit harsh on Mouth. She totally takes him for granted, is oblivious to his feelings and then blames him for Felix’s crap. Not cool.\n\nNathan and Haley fighting causes me actual, physical pain. It’s really unhealthy. For all of us. I may be too invested.\n\nI feel pretty bad for Peyton most of the night but it really comes to a head when a drink gets spilled on her mother’s amazing dress. I cannot even imagine. On top of everything else.\n\nGRRRRR!!!! The whole music vs. basketball camp thing is SO AGGRAVATING!!!!! Why is it a choice between the two? WHY do they keep lying to each other???? AAAAAHHHHH!!!!!\n\nBest Bit: Nathan getting so excited about surprising Haley at the dance. He just wants everything to be perfect for her. He’s nearly giddy at the thought. “I actually have a pretty incredible night lined up for her.”\n\nUgh! Moment: Where do I start? When Nathan has to tell the carriage to leave without them. When he finds out that Haley lied. When they fight at the Beach House. It sucks. IT ALL SUCKS SO MUCH.\n\nFave Quote: Brooke: “Think of all the taffeta that had to die to make this thing. Ew.”\n\nOn My iPod: “When The Stars Go Blue” by Bethany Joy Galeotti and Tyler Hilton & “What You Waiting For?” by Gwen Stefani\n\n2×10 – “Don’t Take Me for Granted”\n\nOverview: Drama abounds after the Formal festivities. Peyton deals with hateful rumors and Nathan and Haley’s relationship continues to take hits.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nThat “Formal on a Sunday” stuff is hilarious. And total Tree Hill nonsense. Like, what?\n\n“Ew. You two realize you’re related, right?… Double ew if Tutor Wife is here.” Brooke is HILARIOUS! And Nathan’s: “Hi, Brooke,” is the most adorable thing. Why is it so cute? Two meaningless words and the boy kills me. I must be damaged.\n\nNathan demanding Haley to stop working with Chris? WRONG. Haley refusing? WRONG. Nathan turning around and walking out? WRONG!!!\n\nI probably should NOT find a threatening, violent, jealous Nathan so damn hot. But I do. I’m sorry. I can’t help it.\n\nJules is trying to tell Keith to get out, away from Dan. Away from her. I wish he would have listened.\n\nKaren: “Oh, grow up. That tragic hero crap only works in the movies. And you know what they don’t show you after they fade out? The hero’s mother putting her foot up his ass.” It’s so great that Karen even scared the River Court boys into not letting Lucas play. Lady has powers.\n\nI absolutely LOVE the statement Peyton makes with her “DYKE” t-shirt. It is strong and brave and powerful and still so relevant. Makes me want to stand up and cheer.\n\nI was HORRIFIED when I first learned that Dan had something to do with Jules and her relationship with Keith. He is a truly despicable person.\n\nJAKE!!!!!! Have never been happier to see his face!!\n\nNathan waiting with a romantic dinner for Haley while she goes to see Chris absolutely tears me apart.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan and Haley’s little make up doesn’t fix the overall problems but I still feel it all over. My heart SWELLLS. Why can’t they always be that way?\n\nUgh! Moment: Chris kissing Haley. OMG SO BAD!!!!! SOOOOO BAD!!!!!!!!!\n\nFave Quote: Lucas: (voiceover) “Nathaniel Hawthorne once wrote: No man, for any considerable period, can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude, without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true.”\n\nOn My iPod: “When It Comes” by Tyler Hilton, “Shoot Your Gun” by 22-20’s, “Sideways” by Citizen Cope & “23” by Jimmy Eat World.\n\n2×03 – “Near Wild Heaven”\n\nOverview: Nathan and Haley let their friends throw them “better late than never” bachelor and bachelorette parties.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI love that Nathan isn’t even trying to stop Tim. He just rolls his eyes and throws his hands up like there’s nothing he can do. It’s adorable. But who he is now is nothing like who he used to be, TIM!\n\nHaley is darling, getting all flustered over the thought of Nathan with a stripper. Poor girl.\n\nOnly Dan could be this manipulative from his sick bed. Wanting Lucas to see those pictures, pretending to be a nice guy. Disgusting.\n\nWhy on earth would Mouth volunteer himself to get things thrown at him and be rolled into things? Also, I want to play.\n\n4 guys sitting around doing Cosmo quizzes. I KNEW this stuff happened. Lucas is the best. “What the hell are you reading?” His face kills me!\n\nOMG Nathan’s face when he realizes who’s on the porno. SO DEAD!!!!! “Tim, is that your mom?” Effing hilarious. I had forgotten how damn funny this episode was.\n\nHATE how awkward and distant things are between Keith and Karen. Makes me sad.\n\nThis episode is full of great faces. Haley’s when the tow truck driver strips off his pants? Priceless!\n\nAnd the faces Lucas and Nathan exchange when Tim gets arrested? LAUGHING SO HARD!! Then when Nathan sees Haley hanging out of the party bus? I could watch those faces on a loop for ages.\n\nYou know what else I could watch on a loop? Haley flying off the stripper pole. Absolutely fabulous.\n\nNathan looks like such a little boy when the stripper is coming on to him. So shy and sweet. So uncomfortable! I Love him.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan stripping off his shirt and telling Haley he wants her. Whoa baby! Actually, I love their entire exchange. From the moment Nathan walks into the room (I never thought for one second he was taking the stripper up on her offer) until Haley tells him, “Honey, you’re gonna love the homework.” So sweet and sexy. Those two are just perfect.\n\nUgh! Moment: That slunt stripper propositioning Nathan in Haley’s house. What a whore!\n\nFave Quote: Haley: “All right. I’m off. All the important numbers are by the phone: police, fire, pimps.”\n\nBiggest Question: Is Lucas actually buying any of Dan’s BS? Is he really that curious about his father?\n\nOn My iPod: “Let’s Get It Started” by Black Eyed Peas\n\n2×04 – “You Can’t Always Get What You Want”\n\nOverview: Brooke gets a new neighbor, Nathan & Haley have a new fight, Peyton tries a new hobby and Dan reverts to his old ways.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\n“Are you writing a song or are you planning on killing me?” Could we just watch them live in domestic bliss forever and ever? I swear it would never get boring to me.\n\nI may actually pee my pants laughing at Nathan’s Dan impression. Keith’s response is equally great. “At least the cardboard one’s polite.”\n\nEvery time I see Felix (barf!) I want to stab him in the neck. Every. Single. Time. Most especially when he hits on Haley and talks shit to Nathan. How hot is protective Nathan though? “A little close aren’t you?”\n\nWhat is up with that guy? You can’t work with him unless you’re a coke head? What kind of sense does that make?\n\n“Don’t hate the player. Hate the game.” WHO EFFING TALKS LIKE THAT?? What a loser! GOD I hate that kid.\n\nLove that ‘Vette tough. Very sexy car. I don’t blame Lucas for turning it down but it must have been a super tough decision.\n\nKeith is THE GREATEST. Nathan really needs a guy like him to look up to. I’m glad he’s standing up to Dan and not letting him back in his life but that doesn’t mean he doesn’t need a father figure. And Nathan is so excited to get to work on the car with him.\n\nI don’t know if there is something wrong with me or what but I totally just cried watching Nathan & Haley make up. The way he reaches out to touch her face, insisting that she keep her gift, THE WAY HE LOOKS AT HER (GOD that look could melt an iceberg), the excitement in her voice when she realizes that it’s hers to keep, the way she throws herself into his arms. They are just too precious for words.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan is SOOOOOO cute when he gets all excited to show Haley her keyboard. He believes in her so much and his smile could light up the universe. It’s all just perfect. Right up until they fight about it. Which leads to:\n\nUgh! Moment: Every time Nathan and Haley fight it’s an UGH! Moment. I can’t handle it.\n\nFave Quote: It’s a tie between two of Nathan’s great retorts while talking to Dan. Dan: “Hey, I had a heart attack. I could’ve died.” Nathan: “Dad, we both know that’s never gonna happen. You can’t jerk anybody’s chains if you die.” And, Dan: “How’s your wife?” Nathan: “Happier than yours.”\n\nBiggest Question: Is there anyone Dan has not tried to buy off with a car?\n\nOn My iPod: “Sway” by The Perishers\n\n2×05 – “I Will Dare”\n\nOverview: Felix (barf!) sets up a dare night for our favorite Tree Hill High kids and tries to get closer to Brooke.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI would NEVER have agreed to do this dare night if Felix (barf!) was the one in charge.\n\n“Well, ya know, in some countries, you can buy coffee without actually having to have sex with the cafe owner. Those countries aren’t nearly as much fun for me, but what are you gonna do?” Andy is hilarious. If Karen isn’t going to be with Keith, I’m glad he’s around.\n\nCan you imagine being the sales woman when Lucas comes to return the clothes right off his back?\n\nI cannot handle Nathan’s face during this scene in the massage parlor. WAY TOO FUNNY!!!! “I’m out.” I bet no one wrapped in a sheet has ever run faster.\n\nCHOKING on laughter at the card that Nathan has to read. “Good evening, Mr and Mrs Tree Hill resident. We’re selling these delicious cookies to raise money for ‘Lady Leprechauns’, an organization that empowers us girls to be strong, beautiful, independent women of tomorrow.” His face in that hat. DEAD! And then Keith sees them as he drives by. I’m crying.\n\nPeyton and Haley at the baseball thing are hysterical!! Peyton get’s slammed in the head with a ball, Haley moves in to check on her and then gets whacked in the back. I don’t know why that’s so funny to me.\n\nI would never, ever in a billion years get into an open grave. Buffy I am not.\n\nI honestly do not remember this conversation between Peyton and Haley in the church about Haley throwing up before the wedding. It makes my heart lurch to think of that moment before she marries Nathan.\n\nI haven’t said anything about Anna & Lucas. Oh, right. That’s because I don’t care.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan in a skirt. Duh. As I told my friend Kristen, baby has some sexy legs!\n\nUgh! Moment: “Dare You To Move,” for a scene that is NOT Nathan and Haley? FOR SHAME!!!!!!\n\nFave Quote: Nathan: “So this is legitimate right? This is like a massage?” Tim: “Dude, shut up! I am concentrating.” Nathan: “Yeah, you know what, I really don’t think I need to be here for this.” Masseuse: “Oh, it won’t take long.” Nathan: “Yeah, I’ll bet.”\n\nBiggest Question: Did really no one see Lucas start to pull those photos out of his pocket? How blind are they?\n\nOn My iPod: “Dare You To Move” by Switchfoot & “Collide” by Howie Day\n\n2×06 – “We Might As Well Be Strangers”\n\nOverview: New kids in town mean new couples. And new opportunities mean new challenges.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nChris Keller!! He’s such an ass. But an ass that makes me smile. I just can’t help myself.\n\nAwww!! Whitey. I sure have missed his crankiness. “How the hell should I know? Do I look like the Post Master General?”\n\nI love that Andy assumes that Lucas is a little kid. Hilarious.\n\nOh Nathan. He’s so worried about being away from Haley if he goes to High Flyers. The stress in his face just breaks my heart.\n\nAnna says that they “beat Our Lady of Peace every year” at basketball. Doesn’t she change schools all the time though?\n\nUm, can I please have Andy’s yard?\n\nI don’t think I ever realized that Keith was the first one that wanted to open a dealership. Probably because I have tried to block out all of his time with Jules. He just seems so happy. And then to remember how it’s taken away. Ugh. I don’t like it.\n\nLucas confronting Karen in the kitchen is so funny. I love their relationship.\n\nDamn it Nathan! Why do you have to be so damn perfect? It’s horrible! You can both have your dreams!! You can!! UGH!!\n\n“Welcome to Tric.” Iconic.\n\nAnd then Nathan’s flash back from the series finale!!! I’m gonna go ahead and cry now.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan and Haley watching the meteor shower together. He believes in her so much and he’s just trying to get her to believe in herself. He’s willing to risk his dreams to make that happen. That’s true love.\n\nUgh! Moment: Nathan lying to Haley about High Flyers. BAD NATHAN!! SO BAD!!\n\nFave Quote: Nathan: “I already know my future. It’s with Haley.”\n\nBiggest Question: Why does Nathan think that Haley can’t have her music if he goes to camp? And why would Haley tell him that she’d only play when he got back? KIDS ARE DUMB!\n\nOn My iPod: “Glad” by Tyler Hilton (I would, of course, have “Let Me Fall” by Bethany Joy Lenz on my iPod if it was available. Grrr).\n\nGreetings OTH Family!! And Happy OTH Wednesday! We have hit the end of Season 1 and the beginning of Season 2. Some of the most important episodes of the entire series. Read, enjoy and don’t forget to leave all of those amazing comments that I love so much!\n\n1×21 – “The Leaving Song”\n\nOverview: Everyone is under pressure as the basketball playoffs approach. Jake deals with Nicki, Haley & Nathan deal with new issues & everyone must deal with Dan.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nI love the Scott brother bonding. SO MUCH. They certainly have come a long way in just 20 episodes.\n\nWhitey is always hilarious when talking to Dan but he’s also really sweet. So protective over his team.\n\nPoor Nathan. He honestly thinks that Lucas was the lucky one having been abandoned by their father. The worst part is, he’s probably right.\n\nNICKI IS SUCH A SLUNT!!!!! Poor Peyton. I cannot imagine the panic attack. And the guilt. Jake just cannot win.\n\nI hate this argument for SO MANY REASONS. I can put myself back in my teen shoes and understand all of Haley’s insecurities. At the same time, I now know men and can understand their “needs” as well. It’s a lose/lose.\n\nI absolutely love when Karen stands up to Dan because no matter what snide remarks Dan makes, Karen is always in the right. She is good, he is bad. Period.\n\n“Isn’t this bad for your shoulder?” Nathan is looking out for his brother!! Awwwww!!!!! But damn it Lucas! You couldn’t have moved a few inches to the left and barfed on Dan’s shoes?\n\nOh man. Haley just does not understand the way boys work at all. Poor dear. Lucas is really sweet to go to bat for Nathan though and try to explain it to her.\n\nOk, the Peyton pics are BAD. Nathan is a dumb ass. Why on earth let your GF anywhere near your computer without cleaning some stuff up? Idiot. Poor Haley. She’s really hurt.\n\nUgh. Keith. I feel so bad for him. He has every right to be a little selfish now. He gave his whole life to Karen & Lucas. And now everyone is leaving.\n\nBest Bit: Nathan talking to Lucas about his troubles with Haley while they work out. They’re laughing together, telling jokes, acting like real brothers. It warms my heart. And the fact that Dan hates it makes me even happier. “Porn freak. Just stay away from the sites with farm animals.”\n\nUgh! Moment: Haley & Nathan’s fight about porn. I can understand that at 17 it must be a big deal for Haley. At my age, it’s kind of funny and I’d think a guy was strange if he DIDN’T look at porn. Either way, I hate it when they fight, no matter what it’s about.\n\nFave Quote: Haley: “I was over at Nathan’s and I was on his computer, and I came across all this creepy porn.” Peyton: “How creepy? Like she-male midgets?”\n\nBiggest Question: What was Dan’s motivation behind asking for custody of Lucas all those years ago? Did he honestly have a change of heart? I find that hard to believe.\n\nOn My iPod: “Thrown Away” by Vast & “Suffering” by Satchel\n\n1×22 – “The Games That Play Us”\n\nOverview: Lots of shock and awe for all the Tree Hill residents as the Ravens play their first post season game and Lucas & Keith prepare to leave.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nHave I shared with all of you my love affair with Nathan’s color coordinated basketball themed clothes? I want to build a shrine to them. That’s how much I love them. They are magnificent.\n\nAt this point in the story, there is NOTHING that isn’t abhorrent about Dan Scott. The way he coaches, the way he fathers his sons and the way he talks to every woman in his life. The man is a walking disease.\n\n*SQUEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!* “Because I’m sorry. Because I love you. And because you’re looking really hot standing out here in the rain and I’m thinking I have to kiss you.” Pardon me while I do a ridiculous happy dance complete with giggles and clapping. These two. I CANNOT.\n\nThis scene with Karen and Keith breaks my heart. Mostly because Moira Kelly is the most stunning crier EVER. But also because those two are SO MEANT TO BE and it just sucks that she keeps pushing Keith away.\n\nGO HALEY!!! This part. GAH. Nathan’s look of shock, Haley’s reassurance. SEXY AS HELL. I could watch it over and over. Wait, I have watched it over and over.\n\nWhy on earth would Lucas ask Haley to meet him in the cemetery? That is just weird. And then to break that kind of news to her there? What is his damage?\n\nSo incredibly proud of Nathan standing up to Dan that way. He’s right and Dan knows it. So sexy when he fights back. I want to give him a standing ovation. He’s come such a long way.\n\nWho thought Nathan and Haley were talking about doing it? Raise your hand. Yeah, I totally thought that’s what they were talking about.\n\nNot gonna lie, I kind of thought that Brooke had effed things up for Peyton there for a second. Was pretty stoked to be wrong about that. Bye, bye Nicki. Hate you. Never come back, ever.\n\nBrother love!!! Awwww!!! Just adore those two getting along.\n\nReally Lucas? You couldn’t leave each of them their own note? You haven’t put them through enough? Real nice.\n\nDIE, DAN! DIE!!!\n\nTwo things about this scene in Nathan’s apartment. 1.) Lucas has ZERO right to get huffy with Haley about sleeping with Nathan. Who does he think he is? 2.) OMG!!! MARRIED!! Normally I would think 2 teens getting married was beyond stupid. But this, I allow. For so many reasons. Allow and LOVE!!!!!!! I could seriously talk about it for days and probably will post about it at some point in the future. “We did wait.” The way she giggles, the way Nathan looks at her with SO MUCH LOVE written all over his face? I die.\n\nSide note: If you have not yet listened to the two commentaries for this episode, get your hands on a DVD and enjoy! So awesome! Also, James talked about this episode at the recent ATX Festival and my friend Kristen has the full report. Check it out HERE.\n\nBest Bit: This was a tough decision to make but how could I not go with our very first Naley kiss in the rain? A truly stunning moment.\n\nUgh! Moment: Dan catching Keith shirtless hugging Deb. That will not end well for anyone.\n\nFave Quote: Karen: “But no matter where you go or who you become, this place will always be with you. There is only one Tree Hill. And it’s your home.” A quote that will resonate until the very end of the series.\n\nBiggest Question: What on earth is Haley wearing under her shirt? It’s not a camisole, it’s not a bra. I don’t get it at all. Nor have I ever seen one any place else.\n\nOn My iPod: “More Than Anyone” by Gavin DeGraw and “Run” by Snow Patrol\n\n2×01 – “The Desperate Kingdom of Love”\n\nOverview: All of Tree Hill deals with the fall out of Dan’s heart attack, Lucas & Keith’s departure and Naley’s big surprise.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nThis opening funeral scene gave me so much hope. I really thought that Dan had died. What a bummer to find out that he didn’t. In other news, Nathan looks REALLY good in that suit.\n\n“I had the strangest dream.” How insanely precious are these two? Infinitely sweet and sexy and beautiful together. I would watch 187 episodes of just THIS. Does that make me creepy?\n\n“We’re married now Haley. I’m never gonna hide that.” Hey Nathan Scott. Could you please be more darling? LOVE YOU FOREVER.\n\nDeb & Dan. WOW. They are just the WORST. To each other and to their son. Though “Assiest ass,” did make me laugh out loud.\n\nThis Naley flash back. Not sure there is an OTH scene I have watched more times. Absolutely perfect in every way. She is perfect. He is perfect. They are beyond. I want to cry from the epicness of it all.\n\nIf Dan had actually been given a chance to make that little speech he rehearsed in the car, there is no way Deb would have believed him. Right?\n\nI adore Haley’s parents. LOVE THEM. I also LOVE that they let us think that Marion was Haley’s mom there for a second. Hilarious. As are the front door jokes. And the horny cat burglar joke. And poor Nathan. The awkward faces he makes standing in the kitchen are just priceless. BTW, that white shirt looks DAMN good on him. Holy Moses.\n\nKeith’s reasons are hysterical. “Dan’s an ass. You’re an ass. Your mother annihilated my heart.” Love that guy. His rant about Dan is also pretty phenomenal.\n\nSUPER proud of Brooke & Peyton for deciding not to let Lucas’ letter get between them. It shows growth. Hos before bros.\n\n“I promise you Haley. I will always be there for you. I will always protect you. I will always protect you. Always.” MY HEART!! MY FEELINGS!! I thought about this scene so many times during S9. I wish I could explain why. It’s just so powerful.\n\nBest Bit: The entire scene with Nathan and Haley in bed together. The jerk that Nathan once was, is so far gone now and all because of Haley’s love. She knows that too and it’s why he is able to convince her to marry him, no matter how ridiculous it sounds. Nathan: “Ok, so I’ll say it again. I could love you forever.” Haley: “Nathan so could I.” Nathan: “So then why can’t forever start today?”\n\nUgh! Moment: Deb blaming Nathan for Dan’s heart attack and then telling Haley to shut up. What a bitch. And in a chapel too. Real nice.\n\nFave Quote: The first of many, the epic and iconic: “Always and Forever.”\n\nBiggest Question: This entire episode takes place inside what I like to call the “Tree Hill Space/Time Continuum.” There is no way all of the events will ever fit into a time line that makes any sense at all to anyone. It does not work within the previous episode’s parameters even a little bit.\n\nOn My iPod: “Take Your Mama” by Scissor Sisters, “Empty Apartment” by Yellowcard, “She Will Be Loved” by Maroon 5 & “Lie In The Sound” by Trespassers William\n\n2×02 – “Truth Doesn’t Make A Noise”\n\nOverview: Lucas, Peyton & Brooke throw Nathan & Haley a wedding reception while Nathan’s parents continue to struggle with the news.\n\nRandom Observations:\n\nLucas is pretty great with his support of Nathan & Haley and with his party idea. And with trying to be friends with the girls. Must give credit where credit is due.\n\nDan’s “the sky is so blue” thing and all of the nicey nice? My eyes are rolling so intensely that they may pop out of my head.\n\nHaley is so classy and sweet. And Deb is such a bitch in return. UGH!\n\nSorry but I am SO uninterested in Peyton’s Lust Factor story line. Take a hint Brooke. Why would anyone ever be happy about having naked pics of them posted on the internet?\n\nNathan is SO SO SO HOT when he stands up to his parents. “How about you and dad back off and shut up about Haley and me.” Yeah Deb! Take that!\n\nAaaaaaand Haley’s parents continue to be awesome, funny and supportive. Everything Nathan’s parents are not. “We found some hash in the guest room.” “By the way, the dog threw up on Mr. Waffles.”\n\nLMAO at Mouth spraying Skills with cheese and then Fergie scraping it off with a chip.\n\nWhitey’s gift is SO sweet. Not exactly useful at this time but sweet all the same.\n\nHeaven help me. Nathan is already a perfect husband. Standing by Haley against his mother. Comforting her when she’s upset. I get all kinds of giddy when I watch that scene on the steps. They are everything to each other.\n\nBest Bit: Haley standing up to Deb to defend her parents and Nathan loving her more for it. Do not mess with Haley James Scott people.\n\nUgh! Moment: Deb has some nerve saying that Haley ruined Nathan’s life. If anything, she saved it after his parents ruined it.\n\nFave Quote: Mr. James: “Hell, you can drive at sixteen, go to war at eighteen, you drink at twenty-one and retire at sixty-five. So how old do you have to be before your love is real?”\n\nBiggest Question: I don’t want to be this curious but I really am. What in the hell was in that note Lucas wrote to Brooke & Peyton?\n\nOn My iPod: “Float On” by Modest Mouse, “Art” by Louque, & “Everybody’s Changing” by Keane"
