        "text": "Bethany Joy Lenz, best known for playing Haley James Scott on One Tree Hill, is in the process of releasing Dinner for Vampires, a book about the decade she spent in a cult called the Big House Family. If that immediately makes you want to ask a few questions, you‚Äôre in luck. Although the book isn‚Äôt out until October 22, Lenz did give us a look at the cover art this week. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the first book I thought I‚Äôd write, publicly, but as difficult as this subject matter is to untangle, I‚Äôm grateful I get to share my story, my way,‚Äù she captioned an Instagram post to promote the book. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a story of forgiveness and a roadmap to how manipulation works, with heartache and humor along the way. We all make mistakes and I hope Dinner for Vampires reminds you that, no matter what weird roads you‚Äôve gone down, you‚Äôre not alone ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•.‚Äù According to publisher, Simon & Schuster, the memoir tracks how a low-key at-home Bible study transformed into ‚Äúsomething more sinister,‚Äù leading her to relocate to the Family‚Äôs Pacific Northwest compound, marry one of the minister‚Äôs sons, and lose her autonomy (plus millions of dollars).\n\nLenz first opened up about her experience in a lengthy interview with Variety last August. According to Lenz, the One Tree Hill cast and crew were aware of her cult membership while she was working on the WB turned CW teen soap. ‚ÄúFor a while, they were all trying to save me and rescue me, which is lovely and so amazing to be cared about in that way,‚Äù Lenz recalled. ‚ÄúBut I was very stubborn. I was really committed to what I believed were the best choices I could make.‚Äù\n\nLenz described the cult‚Äôs leader as a ‚Äúsociopathic‚Äù person, noting that he reminded her so much of NXIVM‚Äôs Keith Raniere that she DM‚Äôd Sarah Edmondson after watching The Vow to talk about the similarities. According to Lenz, the group began as a home Bible study in Los Angeles. She said it encouraged isolation from and distrust of non-members, which extended beyond just her One Tree Hill co-stars ‚Äî for Lenz, one of the most ‚Äúpainful, shameful, difficult parts‚Äù is that she distanced herself from friends and family, missing many major life events. Her loyalty to the cult also caused her to turn down opportunities to be in ‚Äúhuge movies‚Äù and Broadway shows at the height of her career, she said. ‚ÄúEverything I‚Äôd trained for, all my childhood dreams were coming true and I said no to all of it so I could go live with this remote, small group of people, convinced I was making a noble, spiritual sacrifice,‚Äù she recalled. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll tell you, any group that requires you to believe every detail of what they believe in order to be loved without condemnation‚Ä¶ please run the other way. Just run.‚Äù\n\nLenz left the cult ‚Äúvery shortly after‚Äù One Tree Hill ended in 2012. It helped that the show had kept her in North Carolina for nine months out of the year, she said, reflecting that the ‚Äúspatial separation made a big difference when it was time for me to wake up.‚Äù Motherhood was also a factor. But even after her exit, her time in the cult continued to impact her. Lenz said she has struggled to trust others, as well as her own judgment.\n\nStill, she is hopeful that something good will come out of sharing her story. The actress said she plans to publish as many ‚Äúdirty details‚Äù in her book as she can without causing harm, in hopes of allowing readers to recognize if people in their lives are behaving similarly. ‚ÄúI just want to squeeze every ounce of help out of this experience,‚Äù Lenz concluded. ‚Äú I want this experience to just be the fucking biggest lemon I ever had. Let me fucking squeeze out all the juice for everybody else ‚Äî we‚Äôre gonna make some lemonade.‚Äù\n\nThis post has been updated."
