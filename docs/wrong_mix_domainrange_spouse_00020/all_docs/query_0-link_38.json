        "text": "It seems like every where you turn, there is another 90’s tv show reboot. To be honest, I’m here for it ALL! I was born in the 90’s and I remember watching these shows and loving them, so these shows are basically my childhood. Nostalgia is so good, sometimes.\n\nAs I mentioned in a previous post, Charmed is coming back to The CW (formerly known as The WB) with three new young witches with many new adventures to face and evil to conquer. Looks kind of good, I’m going to see if it holds up to the original. Because I used to love the original. My best friend and I used to “Play Charmed.” Where we would each pick one of the witches to be and create spells and cast them. We often fought over who would be Prue or Phoebe, but let’s be real eventually we loved Piper because she’d get candle lit dinners with White Lighter Leo. 😉 #BESTFRIENDINSIDEJOKES\n\nThe original premiered in 1998 and starred Shannen Doherty as Prue, Alyssa Milano as Phoebe, Holly Marie Combs as Piper, and Rose McGowen as Paige. Doherty’s character dies in Season 3, which is why they had McGowen show up to take the place of the third witch in the Halliwell family trio. The Series aired for 8 seasons on The WB.\n\nCheck out the Reboot Trailer below:\n\nThe synopsis reads:\n\nMel and Maggie Vera suffer a shock when their mother dies suddenly, but before they have time to heal from their loss, another surprise shows up on their doorstep in the shape of an older sister — brilliant geneticist Macy — whom their mother never told them existed. The emotional stress takes its toll and the girls begin to exhibit impossible new abilities. An explanation comes from an unexpected place: the new chair of the women’s studies department. Harry Greenwood reveals that the three are powerful witches, and he is their white lighter, there to advise and guide them as they battle dark forces.–[Via Wikipedia]\n\nThe idea of this reboot seems relatively similar to the original so I’m interested to see how this plays out. I want the key components of the original, but not an instant copy, and they’ve already changed things up by casting three Latina actresses. Cheers from a fellow Latina! I think this could be really cool. However, the reboot did get backlash from the original actresses, when the reboot proclaimed itself as “Fierce, Funny and Feminist.” OG fans seem to be in agreeance and are skeptical to watch. Alyssa Milano also spoke to Entertainment Tonight saying, “I wish that they would have come to us and we would have been involved since the beginning…But having said that, I do hope that it reaches the newer generation and impacts that generation the way ours was able to do for its generation.” As an OG fan, I feel that the original witches were 4 badass FEMINIST women, but that doesn’t mean we can’t leave room for these new actresses to claim their own feminist badassery. At least they aren’t stepping into the same exact character roles, trying to be something they aren’t. So hey, let’s just give it a chance, shall we? No matter what- Milano, Doherty, Combs and McGowan will always be our original Charmed ones.\n\nThe Reboot airs Sunday, October 14th @ 9 PM on The CW\n\nNEXT UP...\n\nThe latest 90’s sitcom to be revived is- Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Well sort of…let’s dive in.\n\nThe original live action TV series premiered in 1996, and starred Melissa Joan Hart as Sabrina Spellman. The show follows Sabrina Spellman – a teenager with magical powers who comes from a long line of witches. Until going away to college, she lived with her wacky aunts, who would teach her to use her witchcraft wisely, and Salem, the talking black cat, who always has a scheme up his paw. As a high-school student, Sabrina is less judicious about using her powers than when she enters adulthood. The series is said to be based on a 1960s Sabrina, a spinoff of the Archie comic franchise, and an animated TV series that originally aired in the 1970s. –[Via Wikipedia.]\n\nThe original live action tv sitcom (1996) was funny, and light hearted, even the scariest of adventures had some humor attached, very kid friendly. I remember some of my favorite episodes were the ones where Britney Spears, and *NSYNC guest starred/made musical appearances. Another would be when Brian Austin Green played Sabrina’s Boyfriend for the night-yes they created a dough boy and basically baked her a boyfriend! Seriously I wish I was able to point my finger and be dressed and ready, or to zap myself to work, without the travel. Witches man! LOL.\n\nThe sitcom aired for 7 seasons on ABC and The WB and included two television movies and one soundtrack release. The series is also said to be outside the Archie comics.\n\nThanks to my free Hulu trial I get to 90’s it up! Hey remember that time DJ Tanner (Full House/Fuller House) played a psycho cult witch and then Sabrina visited Philly in Boy Meets World…SO good! I’ll be watching that episode on Hulu asap. Been on a bit of a Boy Meets World/Sabrina the Teenage Witch throwback kick.\n\nThis Sabrina Witch storyline has been revived/readapted several times, across several mediums. Comic book, Animation, Live Action TV sitcom, cartoon/animated series, films, and now it’s being given a darker, Netflix twist.\n\nSabrina: The Animated Series\n\nIn 1999, Hart provided the voice of Sabrina’s two aunts for Sabrina: The Animated Series, while Emily Hart (Melissa’s younger sister) voiced the character of Sabrina. This series lasted one season and produced 65 episodes, the television/direct-to-video movie Sabrina: Friends Forever, and the continuation-spinoff series Sabrina’s Secret Life. –[Via Wikipedia]\n\nBoth of Sabrina animated shows and a movie are all produced by DiC Productions, now called DHX Media. The series is outside the Archie comics. –[Via Wikipedia]\n\nSabrina: Secrets of a Teenage Witch\n\nIn 2011, Archie Comics announced plans to produce a new animated series based on Sabrina the Teenage Witch to be released in late 2012. The show featured CGI animation that was produced by MoonScoop, and a brand new look for the Sabrina characters. As of October 2012, The Hub has picked up the series, and it finally debuted on air on October 12, 2013. –[Via Wikipedia]\n\nFilms (with Melissa Joan Hart)\n\nSabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 film)\n\nNot to mention the many Sabrina books!\n\nNEW SABRINA NEWS!!!\n\nRiverdale (2017 TV series-The CW)\n\nOn July 23, 2016, at San Diego Comic-Con, K.J. Apa, who portrays Archie Andrews in the darker, subversive live action take on Archie, confirmed that Sabrina will eventually appear in the CW series. Sabrina was originally slated to debut in the show’s season one finale, but this was eventually decided against, as showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa said it would’ve distracted from the rest of the episode, though she is still being considered for a later season.–[Via Wikipedia]\n\nThis could be really cool.\n\nI wonder who will play her?\n\n*Read the FULL Sabrina history HERE\n\nCheck out the trailer for the latest Sabrina journey-\n\nThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, where Kiernan Shipka (will be taking on the role of Sabrina Spellman.)\n\nThe synopsis reads:\n\nHer name is Sabrina Spellman.\n\nHalf witch. Half mortal. On her 16th birthday, Sabrina (Kiernan Shipka) has to make a choice between the witch world of her family and the human world of her friends. With her aunties (Miranda Otto, Lucy Davis), her cat Salem, and her boyfriend Harvey Kinkle (Ross Lynch), Sabrina will face horrors and new adventures in the mysterious town of Greendale. From the executive producers of Riverdale comes a haunting new tale. –[Via Released by Netflix]\n\nFrom the trailer I can definitely see the Riverdale esque influence. To be honest I didn’t even know the character Sabrina was based on an Archie comic. I was never a comics kid, but I loved TV, (clearly still do!) Being a kid in the 90’s, Melissa Joan Hart was my Sabrina. Although all Hart’s Sabrina related content (Live Action TV series, Animated Series, Films) was considered “outside the Archie comics,” it does still say she was based off the original Archie comic character. So I’m guessing it’s a loose adaption. Hart was the Sabrina I know and love, as she is for many. So now I can understand the difference in direction for this Netflix reboot, it isn’t based on the 90’s sitcom. However, wasn’t Archie more humorous and silly? Where is this darkness coming from? But then again I wasn’t an Archie comic reader.\n\nWAIT!!!!\n\nChilling Adventures of Sabrina is an American comic book series published by Archie Horror, an imprint of Archie Comics, beginning in 2014. The series focuses on Sabrina Spellman during her teenage years in the 1960s. The series is a darker take on the characters and setting of Sabrina the Teenage Witch.— [Via Wikipedia]\n\nNOW I GET IT….DUH???\n\nI know I’m intrigued just to see the same few characters pop back up. Looks really cool!\n\nThe Reboot Premieres Friday, October 26th. Only on Netflix.\n\n*DISCLAIMER: I used Wikipedia/IMDB to fact check, so please don’t quote me on any of this. Sometimes their information can be off. My apologies for any mistaken information.\n\nSo who’s watching these Witchy Reboots? Any takers? Let me know how you think they’ll measure up to the original content in the comments below.\n\n*I do not take credit for any images, video clips, films, trailers, or Wikipedia information*\n\n-<3-\n\nSo I’ve noticed this bit of a “Describe Yourself In 3 Fictional Characters” challenge/trend surface on the internet lately. And I loved it and instinctively wanted to turn it into a blog post.\n\nAs a writer I have a ton of fictional characters that I relate to and feel like somehow mirror my personality. I love identifying bits of myself in characters I see written and portrayed on screen. I couldn’t decide so I did 4, #ICheated #SorryNotSorry. (well Pocahontas is based on a real woman so I guess I didn’t cheat, there’s three fictional here!)\n\nSo here goes…\n\nHaley James (Pre-Scott)\n\nPortrayed By Bethany Joy Lenz\n\nTV Show: One Tree Hill\n\nIf you’ve followed this blog before, you know my obsession with this character. It is real and she is probably my most beloved tv character. Since the first day I started watching One Tree Hill, she was the one I felt was most like me. She was the shy, smart girl who was way beyond her years, wanted to help everyone, had this keen sense between right and wrong, wasn’t popular but had her friends and family who she would do anything for and dressed kind of funky. She is my spirit animal. As later seasons came, she of course got cooler, started dating a jock, made friends with the in crowd, dressed better/different, got married in high school, and became this total rock star, made some mistakes, redeemed herself, had a baby in high school, and then later on became an English teacher and co-owner of the new and improved Karen’s Café. All while looking flawless the whole damn time. Which goes to show you, why I really identified with her in the first season mostly. As much as I love Haley James Scott, Haley James was simple, was real and her life seemed normal. Without all the fancy pants stuff, at her root Haley James-Scott or not has always had a strong moral code and a big heart and for that alone I will always be a fan. #ThatJeanJacketTho\n\nPocahontas\n\nVoice-Irene Bedard, Singing Voice-Judy Kuhn\n\nThe Disney Film\n\nWhile all the little girls wanted to be Cinderella, and Snow White, I related most to Pocahontas. To me, is was the Disney Princess who I felt looked most like me. For starters her olive complexion and her free spirit. Her barefoot adventures and love of sunflowers and jewelry and feathers. I love the story, I love her roots and how she knows who she is and knows that her family her everything. She makes decisions based on what’s best for her, she’s independent despite the many trying to decide what’s best for her. She explores, she is curious. The Indian culture has always fascinated me, and I have always felt a pull to it. She is probably the reason why.\n\nRaven Baxter\n\nPortrayed By Raven Symone\n\nTV Show: That’s So Raven\n\nFreeForm shows old school Disney shows late at night and once night I caught That’s SO Raven on TV, and I couldn’t help but laugh and see a bit of myself in her. Her crazy fashion choices, I have had my moments. #BlueLipStick #FlowersInMyHair #FurrySweaters Her impromptu dancing, her absurd slang. It’s all me. #YANASTY #OHSNAP I love her, and I too at times feel psychic. #SHHHH 😉 Also can we just state that Raven paved this way for curvy girls to feel good about themselves. She wasn’t perfect, she was curvy and loud and fun and colorful and she was SUCCESSFUL! Raven is most like my younger self, and I think she comes out still every once in a while.\n\nJane Villanueva\n\nPortrayed By Gina Rodriquez\n\nTV Show: Jane the Virgin\n\nLet’s put aside the whole baby daddy/mama drama, that is this show. Yes Jane was accidentally artificially inseminated and instantly was thrown into motherhood way ahead of her planned out life’s schedule with a guy’s baby, who she never expected to come back into her life. That is the juicy stuff and my life is nothing like hers in that sense. But for some reason in a lot of other ways, Jane may be the character I relate most too. She’s always the responsible one, but when she messes up she owns up to it, and when she let’s loose, her beauty shines. She’s an older 20’s. She is a curvy Latina, with a heart of gold and good morals and extremely close to her family. She believes in love and is a hopeless romantic-not to mention a soap opera fan too. My favorite part-she’s a writer and she is constantly drifting off into her own world, as she stars in her scenes as she writes them. Her morals are very similar to mine and I adore her character as a whole, because everything I mentioned about her holds true for me too. She spontaneous dances too, so I mean we’re twins who need to meet and be best friends.\n\nAs you can tell I love seeing strong, determines, driven, independent, caring, loving, kind, big heart of gold female characters. They are what inspires me to write and to be a better woman.\n\n-<3-\n\n*I do not take credit for any images used.*\n\nI dedicate this to my continuous love of television and storytelling. Television has always been close to my heart. When I was growing up we didn’t actually have cable tv in our home, so I was a big fan of FOX and The WB (turned The CW). But when I was in junior high school I fell in love with the Disney channel and all its gloriousness; and in walked Lizzie McGuire. I remember locking myself in my Cousin’s room at my Aunt’s house and just watching for hours. They had cable and I had to take advantage. Granted I got yelled at a lot by my mom for being anti-social. But looking back now TV was an outlet. An outlet to express emotion and storytelling. I may not have known all the way back then that I wanted to be a writer of television (and film) but maybe it was my gateway to a dream that would captivate my heart for years to come.\n\nThen came along a little show called One Tree Hill. And this is where the idea of directing and behind the scenes stuff really became of interest to me. I was completely obsessed with this show’s story and its characters. I was interested in how they came up with the ideas and would often watch behind the scenes footage and listen to commentary. I was just as interested in what the creator had to say as I was interested in what the cast/actors had to say. My best friend was equally obsessed, we used to have weekly viewing parties and watch together. Gosh I miss that! Time flies! Anyway, that led to the discovery of fanfiction (which if you don’t know is a place where fans write fiction stories about their favorite characters on their favorite tv shows…and then post them online to share with other like-minded fans…) No I never posted I would just write them (pen and paper, the good old fashioned way). My best friend and I began writing stories based on the One Tree Hill characters and would exchange them during school. This I think is where my love of writing really started. So thank you Mark Schwahn for paving the way, and thank you Roe for being my first critic. 😉\n\nTV allows you to feel.\n\nIt expands reality.\n\nIt’s an escape.\n\nIt’s a new world we get to live in and love in and experience that all, as a part of the show.\n\nAs the audience we want to see the drama unfold but we also want to see realistic aspects and bits and pieces of ourselves in these characters.\n\nThat’s how we relate.\n\nThe content has to be human.\n\nSo what makes a good show (not necessarily a successful show because I’ve seen some really great stories cancelled before they got their chance)… but what I think makes a good show is finding a way to fuse the two; to incorporate real life into this television dream land of sorts.\n\nI mean television life is way sexier but that’s just because it has to be.\n\nWhat do I watch you ask?\n\nWell let me break down *my TV show schedule* for you…\n\nMonday\n\nThe Fosters @8 abcfamily\n\nEye Candy @10 MTV\n\nTuesday\n\nPretty Little Liars @8 abcfamily\n\nMarried At First Sight-First Year @9 FYI\n\nChicago Fire @10 NBC*\n\nWednesday\n\nMelissa & Joey @8 abcfamily\n\nBaby Daddy @8:30 abcfamily\n\nChicago PD @10 NBC\n\nThe Game @10 BET*\n\nThursday\n\nThe Vampire Diaries @8 The CW\n\nGrey’s Anatomy @8 ABC*\n\nScandal @9 ABC\n\nHow To Get Away With Murder @10 ABC\n\nFriday\n\nHart of Dixie @8 The CW\n\nGlee @9 FOX\n\nSaturday\n\n*NONE* I take a day off 😉\n\nSunday\n\nThe Walking Dead @9 AMC\n\nThe Talking Dead @10 AMC\n\nRevenge @10 ABC\n\nGirls @9 HBO*\n\n*– means I try to keep up with them but don’t always get the chance. The others I make sure to fit in!\n\n**Other shows I watch that are on hiatus/available on NetFlix\n\nFinding Carter -MTV\n\nAwkward -MTV\n\nFaking It -MTV\n\nYoung & Hungry -abcfamily\n\nBates Motel -FX\n\nOrange is the New Black *Netflix\n\nLost *Netflix (still have to finish this series!)\n\nWhen it comes to storytelling I become a giddy school girl. Fangirling is for real. My favorite thing about TV and movies is their ability to tell a good love story. But I love TV even more than film because TV is allowed the time to tell the ins and outs and ups and downs of building relationships. I’m a sucker for a well-played out love story. I love the “couple’s timeline.” You know First Meeting, First Date, First Kiss, First I Love You’s, First Time…. It’s pure magic. And when two actors really have good chemistry on screen, it’s even better! I love watching it all unfold. I love the couple names, you know when you take half of one name and combine it with the other half of the other person’s name. Watching tv is when I get to become a fan again. An audience member again, (not that I won’t critique the scenes, but I will be able to enjoy the story).\n\nI remember watching One Tree Hill and being at the edge of my seat or standing on my couch during scenes of The Walking Dead. I am very obnoxiously eccentric when I watch TV. And it’s not because I’m trying to be, I’m just excited about the story. I just can’t help it. I guess I’m just so absorbed, I feel I have to dance or scream to let out my happiness, lol! I really should be filmed while watching certain shows, because I am sure it would be hilarious. In fact just this week I was in a frenzy watching Chicago PD, yes it’s an action show, so there’s definitely that. But Sophia Bush’s (also known as Brooke Davis from One Tree Hill) character Detective Erin Lindsay has been having this ongoing flirtation with her partner Detective Halstead (Jesse Lee Soffer) since Season 1. Now we are in Season 2, and these two have yet to get even close to starting something. They had went out once, and decided they were friends and partners and that it wouldn’t be wise to start something in the work place. P.S. their boss a.k.a. Det. Lindsay’s father figure wasn’t gonna have it in his unit. So now Lindsay traded up to a position on a task force and she and Halstead no longer work together…so what do you think happened…use your imagination or watch this and freak the f out like I did. #Linstead. I ship them. I was nearly standing on my bed, screaming, dancing, climbing, and jumping… all the verbs. I was so excited to see all the friendship, care and flirtation that had been building for over a season be positioned into something so great. It was a tasteful love scene too, so props! The cast does a live tweet during the show, so I was literally a frenzied ball of tweets and screams. And now I sit here dying to know what’s going to happen with them this coming Wednesday. That’s good tv, that’s when you know the people involved know what they’re doing. That is what TV does for me. And you can call it weird or obsessive but I call it passionate research.\n\nSo I will continue being very vocal, I will continue to yell at my TV (same goes for scary films, I can’t go to see those in theaters I scream and do the running man in my seat.) My brother always laughs at me and my mom he says we are the best people to watch scary movies with because of our reactions. I got it from my momma. 😉\n\nNotice my TV schedule as of the moment is extensive. It’s a lot to keep up with and I don’t have DVR or TiVo so thank tech gods for free on demand and the internet. YouTube is a godsend, haha. Like I said, I don’t call this obsession, I call it research. No shame. TV is where I wanna be. My ultimate dream is to write for a TV show and eventually be able to executive produce and create my own. I’ve been writing bits and bobs of one for years! Until then! 😀\n\n**R.I.P**\n\nto the fallen TV shows who got axed before their peak…\n\nit’s just like they stopped and I was left wondering well what happened next? That is honestly the WORST feeling. As a writer I could only imagine how unsettling it would feel to put your whole heart into something and then not get to finish telling your story. I think that’s partly why my blog posts end up always being so damn long! haha.\n\nBeautiful People -abcfamily\n\nPrivileged -The WB\n\nJane By Design -abcfamily *this one still stings\n\nThe Carrie Diaries -The CW\n\nManhattan Love Story -ABC *its new episodes were released on Hulu and abc.com and on demand.

But nevertheless my love for the WB’s 1990’s hit tv show, “Dawson’s Creek” is all coming back to me now. I lovedddd Pacey and Joey and I loved Pacey himself even more. And as I watch reruns now that I’m an adult and have a better grasp on life’s dramas, it’s much easier for me to share my appreciation for characters and plot-lines.\n\nIn my opinion Pacey Witter is one of the best male characters in a teen drama series, that I’ve ever seen. And as a writer who hopes to one day pen a few scripts (if not many) for a teen drama series, I am very interested in character development. And the little details that make up a full well rounded character. Pacey Witter is an amazingly well written character with a lot of heart. And thanks to Netflix I can relive him and his love of Joey Potter all over again.\n\n36 Reasons\n\n(in no particular order)\n\nwhy Pacey Witter made every 90’s girl’s ❤ melt.\n\n(and continues to do so.)\n\nPacey Witter background.\n\nThe thing about Pacey is that he was simply cast as the comic relief of the show; kinda like a young “Chandler Bing.” He was quick witted (Pacey Witter…haha get it?) He was at times pessimistic, and overall rough around the edges. But when the young character struck well with the audience, the writers gave Jackson a little more to handle. Which in turn led to a massive love triangle between 3 close friends in typical teen angst fashion, which turned his friendship with best friend Dawson on it’s head and also led to an on going love story between him and Joey Potter that was on and off for the rest of the series.\n\nThe 90’s was a very Pacey vs. Dawson time. And I have to say, looking back on the storylines and watching the evolution of Pacey and Joey’s relationship, I soon realized, that for me it was never really a contest. And after you read this, you’ll soon find that it wasn’t much of a contest for Joey either.\n\nAnd while I’ve showcased many of Pacey’s shinning moments (I definitely did not showcase them all…because he’s just that amazing and we’d be here forever,) I will admit that Pacey Witter isn’t that far of a stretch for humanity to grasp. Like many young men Pacey had his issues. He had a very unsupportive, borderline abusive/alcoholic father, a massive family who you rarely saw onscreen with the exception of a brother and sister here and there. He was insecure about his abilities, and often believed he would amount to nothing. This in turn was the root of Joey and Pacey’s relationship problems. He continuously fought the inner battle that he just simply wasn’t good enough for Josephine Potter; a girl with a bright future ahead of her. While Pacey settled for thinking he’d never make it out of town. He continuously feared he’d never measure up to Dawson and the history he and Joey shared. However, although those insecurities followed him to the very end of the series and we’ve seen him struggle along and make mistakes, we’ve seen him act like a jerk, we’ve also seen him fall in love and grow up into a man with the biggest and sweetest heart. A man who is much smarter than he ever gave himself credit for, a man who will always be in love with Joey Potter. A man who treated her with more respect and appreciation and genuine love, than Dawson ever could, or knew how.\n\n1. “I remember everything.”- Pacey [Watch]\n\n2. He named his boat “True Love.” [Watch]\n\n3. He bought Joey a wall, to paint. [Watch]\n\n4. He picked Joey up in the middle of the night, when her current boyfriend realized he was in love with his best friend and was a friend and consoled her. “If you keep looking you’ll find it.”-Pacey [Watch]\n\n5. He punched a horndog kid hitting on a drunk naive Joey, and back then he claimed to just be her “friend.” [Watch]\n\n6. As the story that is “Dawson’s Creek” goes, Dawson was the heart of a group of friends; He, Pacey and Joey. Joey and Dawson were “soul mates,” and basically grew up together. While Pacey was Dawson’s other best friend. Pacey and Joey never really liked each other and bickered like an old married couple. But one day Pacey realizes he has grown to like Joey more than a friend and actually ASKS Dawson’s permission to pursue Joey. At first Dawson’s reaction is totally cool and casual, then he says he’s not ok with it. So Pacey dials back. Dawson then in that same breath takes it all back and assures him that it is all fine and that he would be thrilled if his two best friends got together. So Pacey pursues Joey. Only to be rejected later. However, 2 years later,… all this is history and Pacey and Joey start what I like to call an epic love story…which is when this show should have been renamed….because let’s face it it was always Pacey’s Creek. Dawson was a little selfish bizznatch. [Watch]\n\n7. Pacey carries Joey out of a fire. [Watch]\n\n8. He calls her “Potter,” “Joe,” “Ms. Josephine Potter,” “Good lord woman” is often an admirable greeting too haha…which no one else really seemed to do, not even Dawson. [you”ll soon recognize the pattern in all the vids]\n\n9. “You Ms. Josephine Potter have just wrecked me. In the best possible way you have absolutely wrecked me.”- Pacey [Watch]\n\n10. “Look at that girl Dawson, just take a good look. She’s a freaking goddess man. How long did you think it was gonna be before some guy comes along and is interested in her…I mean really dude. And when that happens what are you gonna do…Because the guy that comes along isn’t gonna be your best friend and he’s not gonna ask for your permission. The guy that comes along is gonna take one look at that woman and just cut right in on ya.”- Pacey [Watch]\n\n11. He spent the entire night watching Joey sleep…and as grams said “You know you love someone when you can spend the entire night sitting by the fire watching them sleep.” [Watch]\n\n12. “You wanna know something Ms. Josephine Potter….I think the world may just surprise you yet. You fall in love and it doesn’t work out and you think it’ll never happen again. But it does, believe me it does. In the strangest of places.”- Pacey [Watch]\n\n13. He challenges Joey “in a way that no one else would even think of” [see #3: he bought her a wall to paint…not your ordinary canvas!] [Watch]\n\n14. He knows her just as well as Dawson does, (if not more…in my opinion.) “In my entire life there have been two people who have actually known me, Dawson and You.” [Watch]\n\n15. As punishment for something he did at school he was put in the “big brother” program, where he was given a very tough, very opinionated little kid named Buzz, whom everyone has one day with and then asks to switch. Pacey stayed. [Watch]\n\n16. “Why do you think I came here, I came here to be with you…when you like someone, proximity is a good thing.” -Pacey\n\n17. He counted to ten before kissing Joey a second time “Joey I’m going to kiss you, if you don’t want me to you’re just gonna have to stop me.”- Pacey (and she didn’t stop him… go cry about it Dawson!) 😉 [Watch for both 16 & 17]\n\n18. Pacey was a man and owned up to his faults in the whole Pacey/Joey/Dawson love triangle. While Dawson made it clear that he was no longer his best friend, and did everything conniving to win Joey back, Pacey gave her her space…and waited for her to come to him….but not without letting her know how he really felt. [see: Dawson enters a boat race Pacey has already entered and forcibly tries to win…leaving Pacey to veer off track to avoid a collision. Dawson gets disqualified and Pacey comes in 8th.] To put it simpler…Pacey is the better man. end of story. [Watch]\n\n19. Pacey always cups Joey’s face, strokes her arms, kisses her forehead, cheek, or hand. It’s all about the body language people, the little things that aren’t always scripted that make the actor allow the character to become their own. It makes the relationship more realistic. [Watch a scene where he says an awkward goodbye to her, it’s super cute!]\n\n20. Joey needs him. [Watch]\n\n21. “Okay ya got me.” Pacey would always say this whenever he and Joey would hit a difficult part in their relationship and whenever Joey had to get him to really talk to her about serious issues. In a nutshell…the conversation would get mushy and he would get emotional. [Watch]\n\n22. When Joey gets drunk at a college party, against Pacey’s better objections, he takes her home and carries her up the stairs…even though he said he wouldn’t. [Watch]\n\n23. “Maybe I happen to be head over heels in love with you…”- Joey/Pacey [Watch]\n\n24. When asked if hypothetically speaking he were to find himself sailing away again, and he were to ask the love of his life to sail away with him…what do you think she would say…”You wouldn’t have to ask Pace.”- Joey [Watch]\n\n25. During his brotherly visits with Buzz he asks Pacey if the girl he’s in love with, is a hottie, Pacey describes Joey…”She’s so beautiful that every time you look at her, your knees tremble and your heart just melts. And you know then and there without any reservation that there is order and meaning to the universe.” “She’s a hottie”-Buzz [Watch]\n\n26. “My god that woman’s amazing.”- Pacey [Watch]\n\n27. “The simple act of being in love with you is enough for me…so you’re off the hook.” -Pacey [Watch]\n\n28. “I’ll tell you what though, I wouldn’t bet against that Potter girl.”-Pacey [Watch]\n\n29. He stands up for those who can’t stand up for themselves; [see: Jack …when a teacher makes fun of a poem he wrote insinuating that he is gay…Pacey spits in the teacher’s face.]\n\n[see: Andie…when Andie cheats on Pacey while away at a emotional health facility, he still goes to help her when she calls Joey scared of her aggressive date. Pacey goes after the guy.]\n\n[see: Joey…when Joey is honored to paint a mural in the school hallway, someone vandalizes it.] “I want you to apologize and then I want you to turn yourself in, and I want you to do it before the day is done….because this time you just happen to mess with somebody I care about.”-Pacey Pacey kicks the guy’s ass, and later gets in trouble. [Watch]\n\n[see: Joey (yet again) He helps Joey rally against the unfair treatment of their principal…and makes mentions of being Joey’s “Duckie”… “Pretty in Pink” reference which I find AMAZINGGG!] [Watch]\n\n30. Pacey and Joey get trapped in a Kmart… and he lets her shave his overly manly beard. [Watch]\n\n31. He never pressured her to do anything she wasn’t ready for.\n\n[Watch Part 1] Plot twist… [Watch Part 2]\n\n32. “Northern Lights my ass, this guy is obviously just tryna separate you from the Potter pantalones.”-Pacey (p.s. his jealousy is perfection) He randomly throws Spanish words into sentences all the time and it is completely hysterical! [Watch]\n\n33. “You’re mom should get a metal…because she raised the perfect boy.”- Joey [Watch]\n\n*Well Joey, I couldn’t have said it better myself.*\n\n34.”And you did, you did… you let me do it”- Pacey (to Joey on her crazy reaction to him kissing her)\n\n35. Dawson: “Oh wow a picture of me and little Joey Potter…look how beautiful she was even then. I had no idea.” Pacey: “You must have been deaf, dumb, and blind not to notice.” [Watch same video for 34 & 35.]\n\n36. He taught her to drive, when Dawson clearly didn’t have the patience to. [Watch]\n\nThe age old debate of Pacey vs. Dawson…was entertaining. However, as I’ve proven Pacey was always meant to prevail, at least in my eyes. I am sure the writers were initially plotting Joey and Dawson to be the show’s end game. But I think once they saw the chemistry between Katie Holmes (Joey) and Joshua Jackson (Pacey) and how well received their relationship was. They realized they struck gold. If you ask me Pacey and Joey were just meant to end up together. I mean it’s the old story of bickering friends…that hate each other who soon find out that under all that hate there’s actually love…love is just hate set on fire my friends. They had a lot in common in many ways, and whatever differences they had only helped them to complete each other. They both ultimately believed the best in each other and rallied in eachother’s corners (although i do have to say I think Joey could have afforded to love Pacey a little harder…and support him as much as he supported her…i blame Dawson for a lot of Joey’s short comings because he was always crying like a little baby and making her feel bad for “betraying” him.) So it was a natural progression of things and in turn we soon saw Joey and Pacey become genuine friends. We saw him continuously support her, and defend her. While Pacey’s intentions were usually always pure, Dawson was more selfish with Joey. Neglecting almost every chance Joey ever gave him to be with her, or making their small romantic encounters overly complicated, (to be honest i think I’ve completely forgotten she and Dawson were ever even a couple…for it was just a few blips in time, her love for Pacey went the distance) Anyway I digress. When Joey finally found a reason to stray, Dawson continuously held their innocent and pure childhood history/once merely romantic relationship above her head like a noose tightening around her throat….plaguing her with the fact that they were “soul mates.” Well Dawson I have news for you…you may have been her soulmate and possible”first love,” but a soulmate can be a number of things…namely a friend….however, Pacey was and will forever be the love of her life…and someone who has always supported her every dream, even if that meant possibly losing her… to distance, to circumstance, to time. He loved her that much.\n\nSO there you have it… all the many reasons why girls hang on to tv male personalities. Because basically Pacey Witter was written to perfection. He was a romantic at heart but sarcastically realistic enough to make you believe he may actually exist. But let’s face it ladies, Pacey Witter standards make living in the real world kinda suckish. So thank you Kevin Williamson for creating Pacey, and thank you Joshua Jackson for bringing him to life. And to all my fellow tv couple analysts (I know you’re out there and that you ship those couples just as much as I do)…may you find your Pacey Witter…godspeed beautiful ladies.\n\nP.S. What with all these television reunions and remakes (Shout out to “Girl Meets World”)…i say someone oughta make a Joey & Pacey; True Love the movie. Where we see what happens after the big reveal that Joey finally picked Pacey in the series finale.\n\nSo…how’s about it? Josh? Katie? Any takers?\n\nJust have your people call my people. 😉\n\n*******\n\nSo I came across this on someone’s tumblr and no joke it’s hilarious and amazing and I think Pacey Con needs to happen, cuz I would be all up in that!\n\n[http://FunnyOrDie.com/m/45sa]\n\n-<3-"
