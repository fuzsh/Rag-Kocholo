Born in Coatzacoalcos, Veracruz, Mexico in 1966, her passion for performing arts led her to abandon university studies for a career in acting. Rising through the ranks of telenovelas and films in Mexico, she moved to Los Angeles in 1991 where she eventually achieved international fame. Hayek's breakthrough came with the movie Desperado (1995), but it was her portrayal of Frida Kahlo in Frida (2002) that cemented her status as an A-list star.
