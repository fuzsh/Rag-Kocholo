His love of woodcraft developed early on and led to his mastering the art of wooden boat building that years later would inform much of his architectural design.\n\nJeff’s talent for drawing, and his fascination with human individuality, led him to France, where he spent his days sketching people in the parks and bistros of Paris. His interest in capturing people’s character and varied expressions has also greatly influenced his approach to architecture.\n\nJeff graduated from Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, with a B.A. in Fine Arts in 1968. He received his Master of Architecture degree from Yale University in 1972 and soon thereafter co-founded the firm of Moore Grover Harper, the predecessor of Centerbrook Architects. His body of work includes private residences, community centers, hotels, churches, museums, sports arenas, music halls, and numerous educational facilities across the United States. Most notably, Quinnipiac University in Hamden, Connecticut, retained Jeff as its sole architect for four decades.\n\nMany of Jeff's building designs have been recognized as among the world’s best, including the Quinnipiac University Law School Center, the Wriston Art Center at Lawrence University and his own house in Guilford, Connecticut, which received the New England AIA 25 Year Award. In 1992 he was invested into the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects. Jeff has received 71 design awards, including the prestigious American Institute of Architects Firm Award in 1998, the highest national recognition an American architectural firm can receive.\n\nMark was born into the world of the arts. His father, Sidney Simon, was a sculptor, and his mother, Joan Crowell, a writer and composer, inspirations that led Simon to major in sculpture at college. After graduating cum laude in 1968 from Brandeis University, he switched to architecture. Being naturally gregarious, he felt he would be happier working with other people and that architecture might touch more diverse lives than sculpture.\n\nAfter graduating from the Yale School of Architecture in 1972, Mark initially built cabinets and houses, but then worked in several architecture offices, and was soon hired by Charles Moore, his former teacher and dean at Yale. They collaborated on a number of homes, and in 1978 Simon was named as a partner at Moore Grover Harper, which eventually became Centerbrook Architects.\n\nFrom the start of his career, Mark has been a pioneer in the practice of “green” architecture, beginning with his design in 1973 of an “Earth House” that was built into a hillside and decades later continues to take advantage of the clean heating and cooling energy of terra firma. Today Mark’s practice ranges from private houses and highly crafted furniture, to commercial, institutional, academic, and religious projects. His projects span from China to Mexico to local projects in New England. Recent houses like the Lakewood house in the Northeast and Casa Ambar in Cabo are explorations in new aesthetics.\n\nMark continues designing groundbreaking buildings for independent schools like Pomfret, Berkshire, University School, and Keystone Academy in Beijing. He has designed many landmark buildings, among them: LancasterHistory in Pennsylvania; Nauticus – The National Maritime Center in Virginia; Park Synagogue East in Ohio, the Chemistry Building and Business School at the University of Connecticut; Yale’s Kroon Hall (with Hopkins Architects); the Yale Cullman-Heyman Tennis Center; Reese Stadium, the Kenney Center and Jensen Plaza at the renowned Yale Bowl. He is now completing a multi-building Alumni Center for Duke University and leading a substantial team to comprehensively renew and extend Yale’s famed Peabody Museum of Natural History.\n\nMark's innovative design has been noted by Time Magazine and The New York Times, among others. His 112 architectural awards include the prestigious American Institute of Architects Architecture Firm Award that Centerbrook received in 1998. In 1990, he was inducted into the American Institute of Architects College of Fellows.\n\nJim joined Centerbrook Architects in 1979 and became a principal (owner) in 1996. In 1994 he was selected as one of the decade’s “40 National Architects under 40” by the Architectural League of New York and Interior Magazine.\n\nJim has won more than 60 design awards including the American Institute of Architects 1998 Architecture Firm Award. He was invested, for design, into the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects in 2001 and recognized for Professional Achievement by the Rhode Island School of Design at their 2005 Commencement. He is a long standing member the National AIA Committee on Design (AIA-COD), serving on its Advisory Group and as the 2015 Chair.\n\nJim’s portfolio includes the Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine in Connecticut; the Wolf Law Building, Center for Community, and Medical Library buildings for the University of Colorado; the headquarters building for the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS) in Lander, Wyoming; a museum and athletic center for Fairfield University; projects for independent schools - MICDS in St. Louis, BB&N in Cambridge, Horace Mann in New York City, and Ridley College in St. Catherines, Ontario.\n\nHe is especially proud of working for Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory for over 30 years on 16 projects - including laboratories, a library, auditoriums, a dining hall, housing, a child care center, chiller plants, development offices, and a DNA learning center for the world-renowned center for molecular biology research.\n\nJim is vested in sustainability with two of his projects certified LEED Platinum, three certified LEED Gold, and a carbon free - Living Building Challenge level - innovation campus for the South Kent School.\n\nHis civic commitments include serving on the Town of Essex School Board, the Vice Chair of the Elementary School Building Committee, Planning and Zoning Boards, and Essex Fire Station Building Committee over ten years. He is currently an active volunteer for the Essex Library, including overseeing and funding a lecture series - the Centerbrook Architects Lecture Series. With a focus on architecture and landscaping the series is in its ninth year and brings 8-9 speakers to the library annually.\n\nChad grew up in Washington, D.C., where a memorable childhood was highlighted by service as a Senate Page for the likes of John F. Kennedy. Later, as a college student at Yale, he caught the theater bug, availing himself of directing and lighting design classes at the Yale School of Drama. His interest in architecture was kindled.\n\nAfter graduating in 1966, Chad shipped off to Vietnam to serve for 13 months as a Marine infantry platoon and company commander. Returned to civilian life, he graduated from the Yale School of Architecture in 1973. Several study grants allowed him to travel to India and across the United States, and his observations on urban architecture and celebratory spaces were published in Architectural Record and elsewhere.\n\nChad would go on to become an urban designer sought after for his unique understanding of public celebration dynamics. His background in acting and theater production equipped him to make a process breakthrough in harnessing live television to engage whole communities in the planning of urban design projects. Floyd’s interactive “Design-a-thons” freed the typical process from the contentiousness of public meetings and led to a remarkable record of public and private investment in places like Dayton, Ohio; Watkins Glen, New York; Roanoke, Virginia; Springfield, Massachusetts; Indianapolis, Indiana; and Salem, Virginia.\n\nHis projects around the country in academia, the arts, and civic architecture include the Palmer Events Center in Austin, Texas; Liberty Memorial in Virginia that honors those who lost their lives on 9/11; Maud Gatewood Hall at the University of North Carolina; an expansion and renovation of the Addison Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy Andover in Massachusetts; Krieble Gallery at the Florence Griswold Museum; Almetris Duren Hall at the University of Texas at Austin; new studio arts and athletics buildings at Colgate University; a master plan and two new academic buildings for St. Mark’s School of Texas in Dallas; a master plan and expansion of the Eugene O’Neill Theater Center; a new academic and dining building for the Amos Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College; renovation of the Garde Arts Center in Connecticut; and new and renovated science buildings along with the new Floren Varsity Field House at Dartmouth College.\n\nRecent projects include the new Thompson Exhibition Building for Mystic Seaport Museum; a new Outpatient Pavilion for UConn Health and a new academic building for the UConn Medical and Dental Schools, both in Farmington; a master plan for Charlotte Country Day School leading to five renovated and new buildings; a master plan and expansion for Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington, Connecticut; renovation of McGovern Hall at the University of St. Joseph’s in West Hartford, Connecticut; new academic buildings for Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia, Greensboro Day School in North Carolina, a master plan with subsequent new and renovated buildings for Saint Andrew's School in Boca Raton, Florida; and a campus plan leading to seven new buildings for Bowdoin College’s Schiller Coastal Studies Center on Orr’s Island in Maine.\n\nChad has garnered 104 awards for design excellence, including the prestigious American Institute of Architects Architecture Firm Award that Centerbrook received in 1998. In 1991 he was invested into the College of Fellows of the American Institute of Architects, and he is also a Fellow of the Institute for Urban Design.\n\nTodd has successfully tackled a variety of building designs during two decades at Centerbrook ⎯ from a working farm in Maine to a major expansion of a research facility set in the whaling village of Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island. The challenge of finding creative design solutions to complex building projects fuels Todd's passion for architecture.\n\nHis love for problem solving and architecture developed in a high school design thinking class and further blossomed during two summer internships at local architectural firms. The studio environment was an exciting break from the traditional classroom and he was hooked. His designs for a variety of project types including – education, learning spaces, scientific research, churches all promote and facilitate social interaction, ‘it is the people that make the buildings come alive’. He designs with the core belief that learning extends well beyond the classroom walls and communities are strengthened when they have the opportunity to organically interact.\n\nAfter graduating from Kingswood Oxford in 1991, Todd earned his Bachelors of Architecture at Syracuse University in 1996. Joining Centerbrook soon thereafter, he went straight to work on projects at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. In 2002 he served as project manager for the establishment of the Hillside Research Campus, the single largest addition to the venerable scientific research institution that was founding in 1890. The challenge was to make the modern 100,000-square-foot facility fit into the historic campus as well as the wooded residential neighborhood.\n\n\"Cold Spring Harbor is where I grew up professionally, and I have forged lasting friendships with the people there,\" Todd says. \"I learned not only about designing buildings, but also about how to create an overall sense of place. Because science and learning occur beyond the classroom walls, I strive to make spaces that promote social interaction in every project – whether the building is devoted to research, academia, business, or religion. Fostering social interaction is important in every case.”\n\nTodd has worked on other campuses as well. He served as the project manager for the STEM building and Center for Community at the Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, and more recently led the renovation of the Albertus Magnus College student center.\n\nTodd resides locally with his wife, three children, and their chocolate lab. He has volunteered with the Valley Soccer Club and enjoys teaching children the values of teamwork. He stays active by playing soccer, pond hockey, and surfing.\n\nBecame a principal of the firm in 2017\n\nElected to the CSHL Corporate Advisory Board\n\nEnjoys spending time in Wellfleet with his family\n\nLived and studied in Florence\n\nContinues to renovate his 1890’s farmhouse\n\nElizabeth joined Centerbrook in 2012 and became a Principal in 2022. She is a registered architect with eighteen years of experience in the architecture, planning, and interiors industry, and the recipient of the 2024 AIA Connecticut Women in Architecture Award.\n\nHer work includes the Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine in Farmington, Connecticut, a renovation at the University of Texas Law School, The Pavilion at Grace Church in Providence, Rhode Island, the Leo D. Mahoney Arena at Fairfield University, the development of the Upper School campus at Greenwich Country Day School, the Shepherd’s Run estate winery in South Kingstown, Rhode Island, and several private residences. She is currently designing a new Alumni Center at her alma mater, the University of Virginia, and advancing the construction of a new gymnasium and science classroom at Buckingham Friends School in Lahaska, Pennsylvania.\n\nElizabeth is a graduate of the University of Virginia (Bachelor of Science in Architecture, Minor in Philosophy) and Yale University (Master of Architecture), where she was awarded the AIA Henry Adams Certificate and the William G. and Virginia Field Chester Scholarship Award. She previously worked in New York City and taught at the Rhode Island School of Design and Connecticut College.\n\nJustin joined Centerbrook Architects in 2011 and recently became a Principal. He is a registered architect with eighteen years of experience in the architecture, planning, and interiors industry.\n\nJustin’s work includes the renovation and expansion of the Yale Peabody Museum; a private residence in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico; Nichols-Biondi Hall at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island; a Museum and Arts Village Master Plan at the University of New Hampshire; the Shepherd’s Run estate winery in South Kingstown, Rhode Island; and several other projects. He is overseeing the construction of the Westerly Museum of American Impressionism in Rhode Island and beginning the design of a new five-star hotel in Newport.\n\nJustin is a graduate of the University of Florida (Bachelor of Architecture) and Yale University (Master of Architecture). At Yale, he was awarded the Samuel J. Fogelson Memorial Scholarship Award. He previously worked in Boston on the design of parcels resulting from the “Big Dig” project. He actively participates in design reviews at Yale and the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nJustin moved to Mystic, Connecticut at an early age after living on a farm outside Philadelphia. He and his family reside in the historic district.\n\nGrowing up with brothers, cousins and uncles in the construction industry, building and tinkering came naturally to Mark. Today he works on his own house and is exploring a new found joy in building dry-laid stone walls.\n\nMark’s passion for sports and art growing up often involved his family members as participants or portrait subjects. He still pursues these pastimes, playing and coaching sports while painting, sculpting and creating bas reliefs that use LED light to create shifting shadows.\n\nIn his first career, as a restaurant manager with Hilton Hotels, among others, he readily appreciated the importance of design in food presentation. His design and construction sensibilities turned Mark to architecture; he earned his Bachelors of Architecture from Roger Williams University and was first in his class. He worked for a small Connecticut firm designing high-end residences before joining Centerbrook in 1997 and being named an associate in 2005 and senior associate in 2014. Mark was promoted to associate principal in 2017.\n\nHis portfolio encompasses academic, cultural, laboratory, and commercial projects, among them the People's United Sports Center at Quinnipiac University and two projects at The Hotchkiss School, including a woodchip-burning Biomass Heating Facility. He was project manager for the mixed use Bedford Square in Westport, Connecticut.\n\nMark chairs the Centerbrook Sustainability Committee, which oversees the integration of green building design in all of the firm’s projects. Centerbrook has accepted the American Institute of Architect’s 2030 Commitment, whose goal is to have all buildings be carbon neutral by 2030. LEED AP BD+C, Mark is a frequent presenter on sustainability; he co-led, with the USGBC, a recent webinar on Biomass Thermal Energy in high-performance buildings.\n\nMark cites the glass-walled Hotchkiss Music Center as one of his favorites: “It was a complicated project, which I love. Helping design the practice rooms and concert hall in a bucolic setting, at the edge of a golf course overlooking the lake was a great experience. The biggest challenge was integrating a contemporary, glassy building in a Georgian campus. The Hotchkiss music program has blossomed beyond expectation and the continued love of the building shows that we succeeded.”\n\nMember of Connecticut and US Green Building Council\n\nCompetes in road races and obstacle courses like Tough Mudder, which aids wounded veterans\n\nHasn’t exhibited his work yet, but is thinking about it\n\nJon is known for his Texas charm and for considerable design talent, administrative skill, and technical expertise. A colleague likened him to the conductor of an orchestra who keeps all the elements of a project in sync, communicating with and inspiring each section toward a common goal of excellence.\n\nA native of Wichita Falls, Texas and a graduate of Texas Tech University, Jon joined Centerbrook in 1987. Since then, he has amassed a significant portfolio of academic, recreational, student life, laboratory, cultural, corporate, and municipal projects. An athlete, Jon seeks opportunities for design that promote occupant wellness and wellbeing. These include a new basketball arena at Fairfield University; the People’s United Center at Quinnipiac University; a new Upper School for the arts and sciences at Greenwich Country Day School and renovations to the Jahn Ice Rink and Hard Auditorium at Pomfret School.\n\nElevated to Associate Principal in 2010, Jon has overseen Centerbrook’s work at Quinnipiac University since 2003. He has managed major projects there that include: playing fields and stadia for field hockey, lacrosse and soccer; a health science center; a medical school; a law school; multiple residential halls; two student centers, two dining halls; and a campus master plan for sustainability.\n\nJon’s projects have received more than a dozen design awards. They include a Neuroscience Center at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, a leading biomedical research facility and a Centerbrook client since 1974. His other design credits include the Wolf Law School at the University of Colorado, and buildings at Yale University and Dartmouth College.\n\nJon is an active community volunteer, serving since 2003 on the Town of Chester planning and zoning commission.\n\nReno began his building career in his teens, working construction with his uncles. Today he can tackle anything his house – or his parents’ summer cottage – can throw at him, from additions and decks to wiring and plumbing. He knew in high school that he would pursue a career in architecture because it combined his two enthusiasms: science and art.\n\nA semester abroad in Italy sealed the deal: “As soon as I got off the plane, I climbed to the top of the campanile in the Plaza del Duomo, and the view of Florence left me awestruck. I was speechless. I had never experienced anything like that.”\n\nHe earned his Bachelors of Architecture from Syracuse University, joined Centerbrook in 1993 after working for several other firms; He was named an associate in 2004, senior associate in 2014 and was promoted to associate principal in 2017.\n\nReno has found Centerbrook’s eclectic clientele to be a good fit: “Every project here is a new experience, an opportunity to learn and do something different.”\n\nHe has been project manager for, among others, the Academic Science & Laboratory Building at Southern Connecticut State University. His academic credits include serving on the design teams for buildings at Yale, M.I.T., Colgate, Amherst, and Pomfret School. His portfolio also encompasses residential, religious, and cultural projects, among them the Nessel Wing at the Norton Museum of Art in Florida, Park Synagogue East in Ohio, and the widely published Lakewood House in the Northeast.\n\nHis design/build chair was judged to be the best in the second Centerbrook Chair Workshop. His modern interpretation of a club chair consists of multiple, horizontal, thin layers of plywood - stacked top to bottom with each sheet separated by a narrow uniform gap and laser cut to resemble a topographical model, including a tapered landing zone. He describes his comfy creation as “a chair with many layers and levels, deceptively simple and surprisingly comfortable.”\n\nTwo-time Centerbrook Travel Grant recipient\n\nVice Chair of Guilford Historic Commission\n\nCould have been an Elvis impersonator\n\nDavid was born and raised in Kingston, Jamaica, where his father, a mechanical engineer, operates his own metal fabricating company. David learned the trade as a teenager, and found that he enjoyed welding and putting things together with his hands – except for “the greasy part.”\n\nHe also liked to draw and in high school his godfather recommended him to a friend who ran an architectural firm. David taught himself AutoCad, an early design technology, and shared his knowledge with his older colleagues. After high school, he attended the Caribbean School of Architecture at the University of Technology in St. Andrew, earning his Bachelors and Masters in architecture. He continues to be in the first wave of those who embrace emerging and evolving design technologies and 3D software such as Revit.\n\nAfter working for firms in Jamaica and Florida, he joined Centerbrook in 2006 and has contributed to academic, cultural, and corporate projects, among them the national headquarters of Welltower in Ohio, the Addison Gallery of American Art in Massachusetts, and more recently the Outpatient Pavilion and Academic Entrance Building at UConn Health. He was named an associate principal in 2019.\n\nIn Jamaica, one of his most successful projects was for a friend: “I enjoy residential design because you interact directly with the people who will be using the building. In this case it was with a friend. I was in the field while the house was being built, working with the carpenter and the mason, and it really opened my eyes to how your design gets implemented on the ground. To me the spaces inside are the most important because that’s where people live. The best part is that the homeowner and I are still friends.”\n\nLEED AP BD+C accredited, 2007\n\nJIA (Jamaican Institute of Architects) professional, 2012\n\nRaces circuit cars\n\nBlack belt in Karate\n\nAgatha had a passion for art and drawing in high school. “At family gatherings I’d be in the corner sketching my relatives interacting with one another, or at other times I would draw the landscape I could see looking out of a window,” she says. “I also needed to know how things were put together, and the details of how they were designed.”\n\nDeciding that architecture was a practical outlet for her creative impulses, Agatha pursued a bachelor's degrees in both architecture building sciences (with a minor in business management) from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Her college thesis focused on furniture design for tight living spaces, and she represented RPI in a furniture design/build competition. In a woodshop class, she also designed a wood-slated, undulating lounge chair that looked like a sure cure for insomnia? (it was comfy).\n\nAfter stints with architectural firms in Connecticut, New York City, and Washington D.C., Agatha joined Centerbrook in 2003 and has served on design teams for projects on all three campuses of Quinnipiac University. She was project manager for its Health Professions Center, which includes a new medical school that is focusing on primary care. She honed her academic and laboratory design skills working on the School of Public Health at the University of Michigan. Her recent work includes designs for the Goodspeed Opera House, Springfield College and continued projects at Quinnipiac. She was named an associate principal in 2019.\n\n“Architecture is a joy,” she insists. “I’m always learning something new and tapping into things that interest me, like medicine, science, and craftsmanship. Every job presents new challenges, multiple tasks, and there are opportunities to work with experts in various specialties, all collaborating toward one goal. It’s incredibly rewarding when you see people using the spaces and the buildings that you have created.”\n\nCenterbrook Travel Grant recipient, Valencia, Spain\n\nLike sports, hiking, travel, fluent in Greek\n\nThere was a picnic table in the backyard of the Santaniello home in Springfield, Massachusetts, and when Andrew was a youngster his dad would tell him to go out back and pound nails into it. It kept him busy for a spell. Before very long, the composition of the table had changed from wood to metal. The notion of doing a job right started there.\n\nAndrew’s parents came to America from Italy as adults, learned the language, worked hard, and were sustainable well before the term came into vogue. They started their own businesses, tended a big garden, made homemade wine, and sewed his sisters’ dresses. Andrew liked to sketch early on and was into understanding how things went together in metal shop and drafting classes in high school. He took to the digital world right away, in particular the graphic programs.\n\nHe pursued his bachelor's and master's degrees in architecture at Norwich University in Vermont, and after working for another Connecticut firm, he joined Centerbrook in 1996. He was named an associate principal in 2019.\n\nAndrew has been project manager for a number of high profile jobs, including the Sullivan Museum and History Center at his alma mater, the national headquarters for Welltower in Ohio, and the Jackson Laboratory for Genomic Medicine in Farmington, Connecticut. This last complex project encompassed 173,000-square-feet and cutting edge research laboratories; it also entailed coordinating design and construction management with a large team of architects, consultants, contractors, and state and local officials. He's now undertaking a very similar design coordination effort as project manager of the Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History's extensive renewal project.\n\nAndrew approaches such challenges with positive thinking: “I have learned that the most important thing about getting a project done right is the relationships you foster with team members. I enjoy getting to know people, all kinds of people, and sharing a laugh down in the trenches. And these relationships are important when you are solving problems in the home stretch during construction. You have to be firm, you can’t avoid difficult issues, but you can also be respectful and polite while not taking yourself too seriously.”\n\nGave a presentation on design at the opening of an architectural exhibit at Norwich University, in the building he helped to design\n\nPlayed varsity basketball in college\n\nDelaware native Ryia Wescott had a lively childhood as the youngest of 13 siblings. She distinguished herself as a self-described “band nerd” who played wind instruments before taking up the bass drum. She stuck with it, perhaps realizing that creative expression was in her future.\n\nRyia always knew she wanted to be an architect, proclaiming it to her mother at just seven years old. Inspired by a black-shuttered house near her home and the lavish du Pont family estates in Delaware’s Brandywine Valley, her interest grew. Following graduation from William Penn High School, Ryia left the mid-Atlantic for coastal New England, where she earned a Bachelor of Science in Architecture and a Master’s of Architecture from Roger Williams University in Rhode Island.\n\nRyia is drawn to architecture that engages people in institutions with strong missions. For her college thesis, she conceived a museum in Richmond, Virginia that sought to bridge the city’s antebellum history – proclaimed by the Confederate statues that once lined Monument Avenue – with present day strivings toward tolerance and equity. Inspired by Yad Vashem, the Holocaust memorial museum in Israel, she sought to create spaces that evoked strong emotions.\n\nRyia’s professional career began with a two-year stint designing houses in wealthy enclaves outside of New York City. She kindled her desire to create mission-driven spaces, identifying Centerbrook as a place she’d like to work. Encouraged by a colleague, Ryia joined our staff in 2022. She is actively pursuing licensure as the next step in her burgeoning career.\n\nIn her spare time, Ryia loves to read and write, especially fan fiction. A self-starter, Ryia taught herself to edit videos for her sister’s home baking channel on YouTube, and is learning to make wood burned art. She is still into music, with an eclectic playlist to prove it.\n\nEven though her parents were geologists, and earth sciences came easily, Katie knew that she didn’t want to study rocks. When her mom, a professor at the State University of New York in Plattsburgh, took her to campus, Katie immersed herself in art books. Inspired by artistic expression, and forever reorganizing her bedroom, Katie realized that architecture was her calling.\n\nIn high school, Katie took a class in 3D modeling that sealed the deal. She also became an avid runner and nurtured a passion for the natural world that she shared with her mom. Success on the track, and a desire to combine design creativity with technical rigor, led Katie to Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. While there she ran like the wind, earning All American status for a sixth place finish at the Division III Indoor Track Nationals, and ran the mile in 5:10, and the 5k in 17:42. Katie slowed down just enough to graduate with Bachelor of Architecture and Bachelor of Science degrees.\n\nKatie cut her architectural teeth on high profile international projects at EYP, where she served on design teams for U.S. embassies in Panama City, Juarez, Rome, and Prague. She particularly enjoyed working in Rome with its vibrant mix of history and modernity. She grew impassioned about the tension between the built and natural environment, realizing that, like the ancient Roman ruins, beauty endures and is, thus, inherently sustainable.\n\nKatie has an abiding desire to conserve natural resources and to improve the health and well-being of building occupants. Perhaps no surprise given her upbringing, she focuses on the science of sustainability. At EYP, Katie was also a group leader of their sustainability practice group and a LEED consultant\n\nKatie’s resolve to educate clients and elevate her peers’ commitment to sustainability has only increased. She has presented at national and regional conferences, co-authored articles, and served on the Board of Directors of the Connecticut Chapter of the U.S. Green Building Council as Chair of Outreach and Engagement. Katie advances health-based project standards as a WELL and Fitwel accredited professional, and teaches sustainable design at the University of Hartford.\n\nAt Centerbrook, Katie’s projects have included Ohio’s Temple-Tifereth Israel and University School, a STEAM Center for Virginia’s Madeira School, the School of Nursing and Health Sciences at Quinnipiac University, and a reimagined corporate office building in Cincinnati.\n\nArchitecture is Brian’s second career, his first being in the performing arts, as a dancer with the prestigious American Ballet Theatre. But all along, there were indications of his future profession.\n\nWhen the ABT was planning a relocation of its rehearsal facilities from New York’s Upper West Side, it enlisted Brian to draw test layouts of how the rehearsal spaces would fit into a prospective building. On tour, he enjoyed meandering about the theaters, studying the architecture and inspecting back-of-house spaces.\n\n“One sign that architecture was an interest was that after several years of living in Manhattan, I still walked around like a tourist, eyes up, admiring the buildings,” Brian says.\n\nIn 1985, Brian turned his talents to architecture and joined Dubose Associates of Hartford, where he worked on cultural, commercial, residential, and academic buildings as project manager. He joined Centerbrook in 2005 and was named an associate in 2012.\n\nAmong the buildings he has contributed to are: Renaissance Hall at Buckingham Browne & Nichols in Cambridge, Massachusetts; the Rocky Top Student Center at Quinnipiac University; Lakewood House, a widely published private residence; and the Academic Laboratory Building at Southern Connecticut State University. He also served as the project manager for the new home for Quinnipiac’s School of Law.\n\n“The details of a building are critical because they create a visceral connection with people,” he says. “At the York Hill Campus Student Center, for example, the railings on the grand staircase feature metal profiles of the school mascot, a bobcat, climbing up and down at various intervals.”\n\nCenterbrook Travel Grant recipient\n\nRenovating a 19th Century farmhouse\n\nIt was an idea born of an observation from her mother. A career in architecture. Perhaps, subconsciously, the idea was already percolating. But it was Cassie’s mother who helped her launch the next phase of what has been an interesting life journey.\n\nCassie was born in Pittsburgh. At the age of three her family moved to Lagos, Nigeria. Her father’s occupation – consultant engineer for an electrical company – required another international relocation when she was 10, this time to Leicester City, England. Along the way, in this early life’s journey through different cultural experiences, Cassie developed her interest in the arts.\n\nIn her teens, Cassie delved into photography, and though she may have been shooting whatever she found interesting, her lens often focused on buildings. Reading between lines as perhaps only a mother can, one day she posed the question to Cassie, “Have you thought about being an architect?”\n\nIt was an epiphany of sorts. “Architecture? Yes!” A high school internship with a firm in Leicester City formalized Cassie’s new direction. Upon graduation, she returned to the U.S. to pursue an architecture degree at Wentworth Institute of Technology in Boston.\n\nCassie met her future husband, Drew, during their first year at Wentworth. Later, as graduation neared, they made a pact to move together when one or the other found employment. Drew landed a job in San Jose, California, and Cassie did the same soon after they relocated.\n\nWith her career in architecture underway, Cassie hit the ground running on a number of projects. Among the highlights during her time in the Golden State was a master plan for a school district that encompassed nine different schools, and a 120,000-square-foot office renovation.\n\nIn 2016, Cassie and Drew decided to return to New England and settled in Connecticut. She went to work at Kenneth Boroson Architects in New Haven and he founded a business in Chester that makes leather goods. Cassie primarily concentrated on multifamily housing projects, including an 81-unit, three-building project using Passive House principles designed to achieve net-zero energy efficiency.\n\nCassie joined Centerbrook in February 2018. She and Drew now reside in East Haddam, Connecticut.\n\n“This creative thing brings new life every day.”\n\nThat’s how Jiaying Bai (pronounced Jye-ing Bye) refreshingly describes her interest in design.\n\nJiaying grew up in Nanjing, China, the daughter of scientists. It was her mother’s interest in the arts that sowed the first design seeds in Jiaying’s mind. At an early age she took to drawing, and to this day she’s more at ease expressing herself visually.\n\nJiaying began her college studies focusing on graphic design, with the thought that it was somewhere between design and art. But the fit wasn’t quite right.\n\nWhile at Tongji University in Shanghai, Jiaying visited many exhibitions and museums, and became more interested in designing in 3D. She had also been thinking more about designing for people. A third influence, she adds, was a Japanese home improvement TV show. She was moved by how people’s lives could be changed through renovations. This convergence redirected her path toward architecture.\n\nInspired, Jiaying decided to pursue a master’s degree in architecture in the United States. She attended the Rhode Island School of Design’s interior architecture program, where she specialized in adaptive reuse.\n\nJiaying joined Centerbrook after graduation. She’s found Centerbrook endearing not only for its family atmosphere, but because of how the firm works with its clients, and its regard for how building users feel about the design.\n\n“I care a lot about what people think of designs. That doesn’t mean I don’t think I’m creative myself, but I do think that design is something that you should do for people specifically.”\n\nIn her spare time, Jiaying likes to doodle and draw cartoons of people. She also enjoys singing, and had a band during college.\n\nWhile Jiaying has no immediate family in the U.S., her fiancé is currently in Georgia pursuing a doctorate at Emory University.\n\nIt may be said that Ben’s path to Centerbrook was preordained. After all, he grew up in Windham, Connecticut, home of our Frog Bridge, and explored the Ocean House in Rhode Island while visiting his grandparents during their stewardship of the Watch Hill lighthouse. He followed a circuitous path though, via Boston’s Massachusetts College of Art and twenty years in the graphic design field.\n\nBen knew he had a creative side when as a child he was intrigued by his grandfather's drawings and his parents' divergent penmanship styles. Voted class artist, he designed his high school’s program of studies, drama club playbills, and yearbook covers. Senior year he painted an abstract mural of his eyes, in blue instead of brown, just for fun.\n\nAt MassArt, Ben studied communications design, which led to graphic design as a principal focus. After graduation, he stayed in Boston where he nurtured a passion for solo urban exploring. He also traveled to Europe, where he became fascinated by how modern street art was juxtaposed with historic architecture. Ben sought opportunities to advance his skills, designing environmental graphics, marketing materials, and leading in-house creative teams for the commercial real estate companies CBRE and JLL. It was there he kindled his architectural interest by designing building brand packages, investment offering memoranda, and property marketing collateral. He was particularly enamored by the snappy renderings created by the architects to bring proposed projects to life.\n\nAs the pandemic took hold, Ben saw an opportunity to make a change, leaving the high octane real estate world to nurture his own business in a small Connecticut town. He purchased an 1855 Colonial whose interiors he delights in transforming with modern elements in patterns and colors he hopes don’t induce his vertigo. A budding chef, Ben cooks a mean pan-seared filet mignon with a balsamic demi-glace and enjoys the precise measuring that baking offers, especially when it results in a perfect brown butter brownie.\n\nDan joined Centerbrook Architects in 2008 after working for firms in Massachusetts and earning his masters in architecture from the Rhode Island School of Design.\n\nHe has served on design teams for academic and cultural projects, among them buildings for Mercersburg Academy in Pennsylvania and Yale University. He was project manager for the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center O’Neill buildout, the reimagined Red Barn at Mitchell College, and Connecticut's first cohousing development, known as Rocky Corner.\n\nDan is a member of the Centerbrook Sustainability Committee, a recipient of a Centerbrook Travel Grant, and has taught at Boston Architecture College.\n\nPrior to his design career, Dan ran his own construction business for four years and was an inveterate world traveler. He trekked across America in a pickup truck (towing his 650 cc motorcycle), circumnavigated the planet another time, and spent nearly three months working on a fishing trawler in the Bering Sea, during the winter. He’s been to Barcelona three times to contemplate Gaudi’s Sagrada Familia.\n\nHe takes his two sons to barn-raisings and he and his family live in their third “fixer-upper.”\n\nAlthough he’s remained close to his Connecticut roots, Jim brings a diverse background of professional experience to his accountant position at Centerbrook.\n\nFresh off of earning a bachelor’s degree in accounting and business information systems in 2009 at Eastern Connecticut State University, Jim launched his career at Seaside Naturals in North Branford. A native of nearby Northford, Jim followed that with more than three years of service at a financial investment firm in North Haven. He joined Centerbrook in 2016 following two-plus years at an area auto dealership.\n\nBeyond his professional duties, Jim has stimulating leisure activities. After dabbling in piano and a few other musical instruments as a youngster, Jim settled on playing drums in his early teens. He hasn’t looked back since.\n\nTaking his craft seriously, Jim continually expands his repertoire. Focusing primarily on rock – Dave Grohl is his main influence – Jim has been a member of 30-some bands through the years. In demand, he’s often been in multiple bands simultaneously.\n\nAlthough he doesn’t (yet) take it as seriously as his music, Jim recently ventured into canvas painting. Jim and a group of close friends gather monthly to watch instructional videos describing painting techniques, then challenge each other to see who can replicate it best.\n\nThe son of a clockmaker, René was schooled in fine detail and precision from an early age.\n\nGrowing up in Boxmeer, a city in the southeast corner The Netherlands, René helped his father in an assortment of tasks related to clocks, watches and jewelry. Assembling, disassembling, fixing, cleaning. This kindled an interest in designing and creating things beyond the family trade.\n\nRené’s initial exposure to the construction industry came from an uncle who was a builder, and another who was an estimator. He earned a bachelor’s degree in engineering from HAN University of Applied Sciences and held an internship as a carpenter.\n\nWith training and experience in the E (engineering) and C (construction) components of the A/E/C acronym, René decided he wanted to pursue the A (architecture). He worked for three-plus years as an assistant project architect in Dublin, Ireland, before crossing the pond to a Manhattan-based, Dutch-American firm.\n\nEventually he wanted to gain an advanced degree in his chosen discipline, so René returned to The Netherlands and earned a master’s degree from Technical University Delft, the third-ranked architecture school in the world according to QS Top Universities.\n\nFollowing jobs in The Netherlands and Latvia, René returned stateside and joined RGB Architects in Providence, Rhode Island. But this time, he made the transition with his new family. René had met his then-future wife, Kimberly, a Connecticut native, during his stint in New York City. Together they welcomed a son, Pieter, when they lived in Latvia.\n\nRené brought a diverse portfolio of work to Centerbrook when he joined the firm in February 2018. He was the head draftsman and site architect on a seven-story, mixed-use development located in a Dublin suburb; he was the assistant project manager for programming the high-profile Eastern Docklands development in Amsterdam; and he assisted in a contemporary concept design for an 18-story office tower in The Hague. At RGB he was the project manager for a job at the Rhode Island Attorney General’s Office.\n\nSince joining Centerbrook, René has contributed to the New Canaan Library and Bowdoin College Schiller Coastal Studies Center projects. He and his family now reside in Waterford, Connecticut.\n\nIn his spare time, René has a special interest in housing the homeless, a cause he picked up in Dublin and has since carried on. He once helped build mud houses in Mozambique with Samaritan’s Purse, and has volunteered with Habitat for Humanity. René is now involved with Malta, a faith-based homeless outreach program in the Groton and New London area.\n\nJess joins her dad Ron as a member of the Centerbrook family – she keeping the trains running in our front office, he tinkering with our old mill as facilities manager. A native of Killingworth, Connecticut, Jess received a degree in sociology from Central Connecticut State University before completing a certificate program in human resources at Post University.\n\nWhile a career in HR may be her true calling, Jess first held several jobs in clothing retail following an undergraduate internship at Disney World in Orlando, Florida. At Hollywood Studios, she sold merchandise to families who rode the Rock ‘n’ Roller Coaster and the Tower of Terror. Independent for the first time, she made lasting friendships there.\n\nWhen asked what she learned from retail, Jess responds, “patience.” Her first job was at Calvin Klein, followed by Michael Kors, Ulta Beauty, Lucky Brand Jeans and her favorite, Juicy Couture. Don’t get her started on the bedazzled velour tracksuits worn by J. Lo and Paris Hilton. Jess also learned how to multitask, a skill that comes in handy in our busy front office, which handles everything from catering and travel arrangements to shipping, greeting visitors, answering phones, and processing shop drawings.\n\nJess loves to sing – in the shower, the car, and on stage. Whether karaoke or a choral group, she’s found confidence and poise performing for an audience and counts Taylor Swift as her favorite accompanist. A cat lover, Jess’s feline companion is named Lucy, or Lucifer, depending on her mood.\n\nAs a sociology major, Jess is a student of human behavior. Her natural bent is being helpful and making sure people’s needs are met. She fits right in at Centerbrook.\n\nRon grew up on the family dairy farm in southern New Hampshire and after school he helped out with the milking and other chores, including repairing the barns and the sugar shack, where maple sap was rendered into syrup. So Ron was fairly handy right out of the gate.\n\nThe family was friendly with a “second home” neighbor who owned a vinyl siding business in Madison, Connecticut, and he invited Ron to join the firm. After a stint doing siding, he went to work for a general contractor.\n\n“I had learned how to repair a few things from working on the farm, but I really learned the trade during five years as a carpenter’s assistant,” he says.\n\nRon graduated with flying colors, and in 1987 he and a partner started their own Essex-based construction firm, Triangle Building Associates, which is still going strong and where his eldest son works.\n\nRon’s association with Centerbrook began long before he was hired as facilities manager in 2014. Triangle worked on a number of the firm’s residential projects as well as on the homes of members of the firm, including several of the partners. Among the highlights of his portfolio are the tower addition and renovation to the Aki House in Guilford and the Mitchell-Haney House in Essex, which was featured on the cover of Fine Homebuilding Magazine.\n\nRon is well aware of the fabled tension between builders and designers ⎯ as in “Oh no, here come the architects; I wonder what they have dreamed up today.” ⎯ but his relationship with Centerbrook and other architects belied the stereotype. Besides, his eldest daughter is an architect, in China.\n\n“I appreciate what architects do, what they bring to a project, and how important it is to get the design right,” he says.\n\nRon and his wife Carole have four children. Ron still visits the family farm periodically with his siblings and on weekends helps his wife with her landscape design and installation business, where their youngest son works, too.\n\nAfter spending half a dozen years driving by the Centerbrook offices with her son attending elementary school across the street, Jill was in the right place at the right time for an opportunity to join the firm.\n\nA native of nearby Old Saybrook, and after moving away to study and practice architecture in locals ranging from Washington, D.C. to Washington State, Jill returned home to Connecticut in the early 2000s. She joined Centerbrook in 2019.\n\nIn high school, architecture was not a clear-cut direction for Jill. She had an affinity for drawing and painting, and envisioned a career in the fine arts. After attaining a degree in graphic design from the University of Connecticut, she landed a job drafting for an environmental consultant in Arizona. It was there that the architectural seed was planted.\n\nJill went back to school and earned a three-year master’s degree in architecture from the University of New Mexico. During the two summers while in the UNM program, she interned with the National Park Service documenting roads and bridges in Yellowstone and in Washington D.C. More than a dozen of her team’s bridge drawings currently reside in the Library of Congress.\n\nWith an architecture degree in hand, Jill went from the Southwest to the Northwest, and spent two years in Seattle before returning to Connecticut to be with family. She worked at Point One Architects for more than a decade before striking out on her own for a period. Prior to joining Centerbrook, Jill spent three years as a facility designer at General Dynamics Electric Boat in New London.\n\nOutside of the office, Jill and her family are immersed in soccer culture as both fans and players. She previously coached her son’s youth team and has played in adult recreation leagues, where she met her husband. They all enjoy watching and attending professional and international matches.\n\nJill (last name pronounced Cart-ah-hey-nah) resides in Ivoryton with her husband, Victor, their son, two cats and a dog.\n\nAdam was anything but a computer geek in high school, and even toyed with the idea of studying architecture. He switched to computer science because he felt that architecture would be a relatively static pursuit, while the burgeoning digital world would be constantly changing, presenting new challenges and opportunities. He was half right.\n\nAs part of the firm’s two-person IT department for nearly two decades, he has witnessed the dramatic impact that those ever changing computers have had on how buildings are designed and built. After graduating from Porter and Chester Institute and working for a computer firm for three years, Adam joined Centerbrook in 2001 to help keep the firm on the cutting edge of technology. A Centerbrook project was once featured as a case study in the official training guide for Autodesk Revit and the firm has “virtualized” its servers, increasing efficiency while also saving office space and utility costs.\n\n“I like the hands on stuff, customizing computers for people, fixing them, and helping staff get the most out of the various design and communication software,” Adam says. \"Our job is to keep people current on the newest electronic tools – we call it ‘Tips and Tricks.’ We go where the technology takes us. Some days I’m not at my desk for more than a minute at a time – at least it seems that way. This firm is very conscious of how technology can advance and improve projects for its clients. People who have gone to other firms still call us looking for help.”\n\nAdam is good at badminton, capturing the office doubles title, with his IT colleague Mike, four times.\n\nAn avid sports fan, Adam reports with wit and telling insight on intramural office athletics.\n\nGrew up on “an historic dirt road” in Harwinton, Connecticut. Harwinton had one stop light back then, still does.\n\nAll his relatives call him for tech support.\n\nKen began pondering a career in architecture in second grade. He liked to draw and when his mother told him that architects used pencils all day long, he was suitably impressed.\n\nGrowing up on a farm in Connecticut, Ken was surrounded by traditional architecture. That early influence helped shape the practical approach to design he has maintained throughout his career.\n\nKen used his Centerbrook Travel Grant trip in 2013 to study Roman pavement patters in Italy. He came away most impressed by the Pantheon in Rome. Arguably, the world’s most sustainable building, it was built nearly 2000 years ago and is still being used.\n\nKen earned his bachelor’s degree in architecture at the University of Hartford, and after working for design firms in New Haven and West Hartford, he joined Centerbrook in 2006. After a brief period away to pursue another opportunity, Ken returned to Centerbrook in 2019.\n\nKen has worked with a variety of project types at Centerbrook, including the famed Ocean House resort – an enduring Rhode Island landmark – as well as Quinnipiac University’s North Haven and York Hill campus expansions.\n\nKen was also on the design teams for a major project at Mary Institute & St. Louis Country Day School, the renovation of Demerec Laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, and the chic Bedford Square mixed-use development in Westport, Connecticut.\n\n“Not many architects get to work on both a new law school and a medical school in succession,” Ken said of his QU North Haven involvement. “I enjoy projects that have an impact on the lives of the people who use the building. I worked on an addition and renovation to an inner city school in New Haven, the Truman School, and when it was finished the Principal was so moved by the changes that she cried at the opening ceremonies. I’ll never forget that.”\n\nJim was inspired by teachers and mentors in high school who taught design and drafting. He proceeded to win a statewide design award and was off to the Rhode Island School of Design, where he earned dual bachelor's degrees in fine arts and architecture. He was the recipient of the Alpha Rho Chi medal from RISD in 1977. A master's in architecture from Columbia followed, as well as a Kinne Travelling Fellowship and a Palladio Study Program in Italy through Pratt Institute.\n\nJim joined Centerbrook in 1980 as an intern and has been a project architect, senior architect, associate and senior associate; from 1994 to 2005 he was a principal in the firm. He is currently the senior director of architectural practice and building science at Centerbrook, and spearheads an ongoing initiative to advance and formalize the firm’s approach to high-performance building and sustainable design, using the latest technologies, such as energy modeling software and BIM, to predict not only construction costs but also lifecycle expenses, i.e. how much a client will pay to operate a building during its life.\n\nJim has worked on signature projects here, such Kroon Hall at Yale University, the University of Connecticut Chemistry Building in Storrs, and the Palmer Events Center in Austin, Texas. He is a two-time recipient of the Centerbrook Architects Travel Grant.\n\nLEED AP BD+C accredited, Jim has served on a number of professional organizations, among them the Education Committee of the Construction Institute at the University of Hartford. In 2010 he developed a Sustainable Design Certificate Program for the Construction Institute and has prepared a lecture on Integrated Design Process as an elective course.\n\nIn his spare time, he is an avid fisherman and watercolor painter of local scenes and buildings worldwide.\n\n“The current emphasis on sustainability and energy efficient design is the right direction for architecture,” he says. “Scientists believe there is only a limited time for us to change how we are living on this planet before irreparable climate change occurs. Architects can make efficient, responsible buildings that also are beautiful. Kroon Hall is a good example of that.”\n\nBuildings Jim has worked on have won more than 40 national and regional design awards\n\nReviews every Centerbrook project for quality assurance\n\nMost memorable catch: a wily bonefish on the flats off the Yucatan\n\nHas yet to win the Martha’s Vineyard Striped Bass & Bluefish Derby (but keeps trying!)\n\nBill is the director of finance and he likes to see that things are done efficiently – on or off duty, whether the activity is keeping accounts receivable current or playing golf before work, at the crack of dawn. Eighteen holes in less than two hours, so he can be the first one in the office at 7:30 a.m.? Not a problem.\n\nBill joined Centerbrook in 2000 after working for a variety of organizations as either comptroller or director of finance, including a visiting nurse association, a fiber optic manufacturer, and a large international data processing firm. He earned his bachelor's degree in accounting with high honors from Bentley College and his MBA from Quinnipiac University, where he was an Honor Society member. He has served as an adjunct professor at Quinnipiac's Lender School of Business. Bill regularly attends QU basketball and hockey games, which are held in the Centerbrook-designed People's United Center.\n\nBill also is active in his community, serving as treasurer of the local Knights of Columbus Chapter, a former scout leader, and coach for his three children’s youth sports teams. He has organized staff bowling nights and softball games and referees the annual Centerbrook Badminton Tournament.\n\nIn addition to running an efficient department, Bill has instituted a supplemental nutrition program in the office for low-blood sugar architects and their fellow travelers, consisting of an ongoing cornucopia of bulk purchased or close-out candies, snacks, and fruit.\n\nBill’s nickname is $Bill\n\nHis mother retired from teaching at age 86\n\nWent on a bird-watching safari in South Africa with his brother Jerry, who is a noted avian expert\n\nDoes his own taxes\n\nPeter’s life has been a modern odyssey. A dual citizen of the United States and Denmark, he grew up in Toronto. At Columbia University, where he earned a master's degree in architecture, he was awarded the William Kinne Fellows Traveling Prize that enabled him to visit Barcelona, and elsewhere. Previously, at the University of Virginia, he received his Bachelors of Architecture and lived on a campus designed by Thomas Jefferson.\n\nAfter practicing architecture in San Francisco and New York City – where several buildings he worked on were published in Architectural Record – Peter joined Centerbrook in 2006. He has contributed to diverse projects here, from a college preparatory school in China and the Yale Peabody Museum master plan, to the award-winning Lancaster History museum and library and Bedford Square, a mixed use development in Westport, Connecticut. He also was on the design team for the Biomass Heating Facility at Hotchkiss School, which won an AIA New England Honor Award, among many other accolades.\n\nDuring his travels, the architecture of Denmark made a strong impression on Peter: “I remember going to the studio of a family friend in Denmark who was an architect. It was in an old barn with big skylights, and people were drawing plans for buildings and making models. I thought this looks like a great place to work. Danish architecture is fairly distinct, characterized by humanist modernism: simple, concise design – but not purposely minimalist or ideologically rigid. It’s modern but social. People have to be comfortable in the spaces.”\n\nNamed Centerbrook Associate in 2013\n\nSpeaks French and Danish\n\nArchitecture wasn’t written in the stars for Aaron: the inspiration was closer to home. His father is an accomplished architect, partner in Amenta/Emma Architects of Hartford, and Aaron cut his teeth in design there from age 16.\n\n“Working for my dad’s firm in the summers I picked up CAD [computer design software] and other skills,” he says. “It is how I learned to understand what architecture is, what it can do for people; it’s where I learned to love design.”\n\nHe proceeded to earn his bachelor's degree in architecture from the Catholic University of America – spent the summer of senior year touring Europe – and then acquired his master's in architecture from the Rhode Island School of Design.\n\nHe went to work for an Oregon firm, fitting out restaurant interiors, but before long was hired by the prestigious Gwathmey Siegel & Associates in New York City. His arrival coincided with the onset of the recent recession, but Aaron survived the downsizing and soon was working side-by-side with Robert Siegel on a number of major projects, including residential towers in Abu Dhabi and a guest house for filmmaker Steven Spielberg in the Hamptons. His command of digital design software was put to use crafting pre-design presentations for job submissions and meetings with prospective clients.\n\nSince he joined Centerbrook in 2013, Aaron has worked on a variety of projects, including the award-winning Thompson Exhibition Building at Mystic Seaport Museum, the Center for Entrepreneurial Studies at Saint Andrew's School, the Commons for Global Study and Engagement at Connecticut College, and Carlson's Landing at Essex Boat Works. When not at his desk, Aaron can be found fishing or ice skating on Mill Pond behind the studio.\n\nAdept in Revit, Form-z, Rhinoceros 3D, etc.\n\nCaught and released a six-pound largemouth bass in his first week here\n\nSkates pretty well for a street hockey player\n\nCaitlin has the considerable task of assisting Centerbrook’s five principals while juggling a number of the firm’s day-to-day operations. Thanks to her background coaching lacrosse, it’s just the type of fast-paced environment in which she thrives.\n\nOriginally from nearby Chester, Connecticut, Caitlin was recruited to play lacrosse following her prep career and chose Allegheny College in Pennsylvania. After her playing days concluded, Caitlin coached the sport at a high school in the Pittsburgh area while earning an online master’s degree in administration from Canisius College. Her coaching career took the next step when she served as a lacrosse assistant at Denison University in Ohio.\n\nCaitlin made the decision to step away from coaching full-time and joined Zulily, an online retailer. It was there that she gained an appreciation for creative environments where things are always changing.\n\nUltimately, Caitlin chose to come back to Connecticut to be closer to family, and joined Centerbrook in 2018.\n\nCaitlin counts interior decorating as a principal hobby. And aside from doting on her daughter, Lennon, she also enjoys traveling with her wife, Michelle. Caitlin considers Liverpool, England – her father is from there – the favorite place she’s been, and hopes to one day visit Greece and Italy.\n\nNick began his architectural career as a child, drawing house plans for fun and then turning them into LEGO creations. The style wasn’t modern or post-modern or Georgian. And although they tended to resemble the houses on his suburban Connecticut street, there were telling flourishes and special detailing that set them apart.\n\nSeeing the elements of design and construction come together by watching shows like “This Old House,” and taking architectural design and drafting classes in high school, further sowed the seeds of an architectural career. After graduation, Nick enrolled at Wentworth Institute of Technology’s five-year Bachelor of Architecture program, and in the summers he interned for Fletcher-Thompson, a Connecticut architectural and engineering firm. He gained valuable experience in existing conditions studies, design development, and creating construction documents.\n\nIn his senior year, for accomplishments within the Wentworth architecture program as the American Institute of Architects Students chapter president, Nick and a fellow student shared the Alpha Rho Chi Award given out annually by the national architecture fraternity. After graduation, he returned to Fletcher-Thompson, concentrating on public school projects from elementary school through college, including a large new junior high school in Camden, New Jersey.\n\nNick joined Centerbrook in 2006 and worked on the projects at Yale University, Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School, and Quinnipiac University, including its new medical school, dining hall, and the Rocky Top Student Center on the York Hill Campus. He also served as project manager for the Quinnipiac North Haven Administration building from design through construction.\n\n“Two of my favorite projects that I have been a part of are the Rocky Top Student Center at QU and the Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School. From Rocky Top’s stone patio that has views of New Haven and Long Island Sound, to its exterior detailing, and its monumental fireplace, it’s a unique project. The extensive use of wood for both structural purposes and fine details coveys a feeling of being in a rustic lodge. While the brick detailing and open classroom layouts of Mary Institute and St. Louis Country Day School inspired me to add creativity and flair to the elementary school I would work on during my Centerbrook hiatus”\n\nIn 2017, Nick left Centerbrook to pursue another opportunity, but returned to the firm in the fall of 2019. During this hiatus, Nick had the opportunity to oversee the design, detailing and construction of a new public elementary school in South Windsor, CT. “One of my accomplishments during that time away, was being able to deliver the client a unique, thoughtfully designed building that came in under budget.”\n\nHas been a mentor to high school students interested in architecture, construction, and engineering, and continues to mentor emerging professionals in the office.\n\nOperated a 1911 Trolley and 70’ sternwheeler at local amusement park Lake Compounce during the summers after high school graduation.\n\nHas two very active boys who hope to someday be American Ninja Warrior champions.\n\nDesign/build is a family tradition. Frank’s father is a furniture designer who crafts and sells his bespoke creations, and his uncle is a contractor who builds high-end residences.\n\nTo help pay his way through college, Frank identified and bought tumbledown classic furniture – often designed by prominent architects such as le Corbusier, Eames, Saarinen, Breuer, Van Der Rohe – and proceeded to refurbish and resell them to collectors around the world. He was studying the manufacturing and marketing end of the furniture business at High Point University when he realized that design held more interest for him.\n\n“I was finding these wonderful chairs, many of which were designed by architects, and the connection led me in that direction,” Frank says.\n\nAfter college he earned his masters of architecture at North Carolina State University, where he and several fellow students captured first prize in the U.S. Green Building Council’s annual design contest with their passive solar house. Their prototype was used for three Habitat for Humanity homes.\n\nIn collegiate summers Frank also worked as a designer and builder – drawing plans and pounding nails for a local design/build firm.\n\n“I found that building things is the best way to become a better designer of things,” he says. “You appreciate the practical consequences that will flow from your plans, how things will be implemented down the line by various building contractors.”\n\nAfter college, Frank worked for a Raleigh architectural firm on health care and residential projects and was on the team that won a design competition for a public plaza and clock tower for Wake Tech Community College. He joined Centerbrook in 2013 and has contributed to projects at Quinnipiac University, Duke University and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory.\n\nRemodeled and renovated his family’s house and kitchen\n\nSpearheaded a competition to design and build bus shelters for a North Carolina women’s shelter\n\nHas a vintage modern chair collection\n\nHis grandfather was a master carpenter with a barn full of tools that Mike would use to build things, including scale model cars. When the first Star Wars movie came out – employing models to create its dazzling special effects – he realized that his pastime had practical applications. Before long he was on the road to a career in architecture, which involves model building. He took drafting and mechanical engineering courses, eventually earning his Bachelors from Roger Williams College.\n\nHe went to work for a New Haven firm building models but also as Project Manager on academic and residential projects. Half way through his tenure, he saw an opportunity that would change his career. Computer-aided design (CAD) was in its infancy and firms were grappling with how to integrate it. Mike stepped up and led the transition serving as CAD manager, the point man for acquiring the knowledge to support and train the staff.\n\n“I saw all this digital technology was here to stay and I realized it was something I had to do, something I really wanted to know about,” Mike said. “I didn’t know anything really about computers then. But it wasn’t a struggle to learn because I really wanted to do it.”\n\nA Connecticut native, Mike was aware of Centerbrook, had applied after college, and received a very gracious rejection letter. That stuck with him because it was the only firm of many Mike applied to that actually acknowledged receiving his resume. He tried again in 2001 and was hired, not as an architect, but as CAD Manager in its IT Department. The role has gotten more complex, encompassing the implementation of many pieces of 3D design software. He is now considered the Digital Design Coordinator, fielding questions and dispensing digital wisdom. Knowing both architecture and the latest design technology makes Mike doubly valuable.\n\nBikes 150-200 miles a week\n\nHis Old Lyme High School golf team won the state title\n\nFour time winner of Centerbrook Badminton Tournament\n\nThanks to a liberal arts education and a Connecticut Yankee upbringing, Chris has enjoyed a peripatetic career. It has encompassed two continents, working for a house wright doing historical renovations, running his own car detailing business, and an inside-the-Beltway position that gave him entre to the Oval Office. While earning his Bachelors in Political Science, Phi Beta Kappa, from Gettysburg College in Pennsylvania, he gave campus tours and spent one semester as an intern in the office of United States Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut. After graduation, Chris served for four years as a member of the Senator’s staff, after which he was appointed to the U.S. Commission for the Preservation of America's Heritage Abroad. This position entailed fact-finding tours of Eastern European nations and negotiating agreements with officials to ensure that historic cemeteries and other heritage sites were being protected – a requirement for admission into NATO.\n\nAfter globetrotting for several years, Chris and his wife Kim decided to return to their native state. She taught and he went to work for The Nature Conservancy as an Assistant Director of Philanthropy. In 2003 he joined Centerbrook as Director of Business Development with responsibilities for developing and implementing the firm’s outreach and marketing strategies. He also makes the trains run on time to meet deadlines for job submissions. When not conducting, Chris is a voracious reader of historical works and fiction, tinkers with cars, enjoys a wooden kayak he crafted, and takes the family out on the Connecticut River in the boat that he and his father built long ago. “I think the diverse jobs I’ve had share a sense of public service, whether a legislative initiative or preserving wild places,” he says. “I feel that way here, that architecture has an important role to play, that it can make individual lives and society better.”\n\nAttended two Presidential Inaugurations, palavered with President Bill Clinton\n\nWhen Centerbrook commissioned its new solar panels, Sen. Lieberman flipped the switch\n\nHas read all four of Robert Caro’s books on Lyndon Johnson\n\nRussell is a Norwich, Connecticut, native who believes architectural osmosis influenced his career path. The historic mill town boasts arresting examples of American design through the centuries, from uncomplicated colonial capes and grand Victorian mansions to Romanesque brick office buildings and a deliciously Art Deco Town Hall. He took them all in and even sketched a few to pass the time. He also had two family friends who served as mentors, and he designed a prospective addition to his high school for his senior project.\n\nA masters of architecture grad from the University of Pennsylvania, Russell joined Centerbrook in 1995, and his work here reflects an eclectic bent, encompassing academic, cultural, religious, residential, and corporate projects. He was named associate in 2004 and senior director in 2014. He also has been active in architectural and civic organizations.\n\n“I love projects that involve renovation or restoration or adding onto an existing structure, as we did at the Buckingham Browne & Nichols School in Massachusetts,” he says. “When you repurpose a building for a new use, you allow its legacy to continue. This is often the most economical and sustainable way to provide space for clients. We did this at the Green Street Arts Center in Middletown, Connecticut, where we took a building that originally was a school and transformed it into a place for the community to pursue and enjoy the arts.”\n\nTrustee of his alma mater, The Williams School, in New London, Connecticut\n\nMember of the National & Connecticut Trusts for Historic Preservation\n\nPast president of AIA New England and AIA Connecticut\n\nTrustee of the First Congregational Church of Old Lyme\n\nChairman of the Hadlyme Ferry Historic District Commission\n\nHardly ever takes the Hadlyme Ferry\n\nHis family garden boasts six dozen tomato plants\n\nLight filtering through iron feathery vines spiraling left and right along the veranda and a splash of blue azulejo tiles on the floor ...\n\nThese images constitute a young Kas’s first architectural impressions. Memories from Cuba, the tropical island where she was born. When Kas was three years old she and her family moved to the United States as political refugees, but the early memories of natural motifs, color, and enclosure would stay with her.\n\nAn artist from an early age, Kas chose a career in architecture – perhaps surprisingly – just as much for its limitations as for its opportunities. She sees art as a chance to describe possible worlds, emotions, and ideas. Kas’s art portfolio includes everything from watercolors of buildings, to landscapes, and people. But the human figure remains by far her preferred subject. She claims influence from Bauhaus artist Oskar Schlemmer, surrealist Salvador Dali, and Giorgio de Chirico. It’s not necessarily about the objectivity of the human figure, but rather its relationship with the world it exists within.\n\n“For me, creating is like breathing. It’s something I can’t imagine not doing, but I also love the constraints of real world challenges. When you’re painting, it’s very much a free flowing process. With architecture, you’re fulfilling a greater purpose, and you’re hopefully helping people by creating beautiful functional spaces. The beauty of architecture is how easy it is to share it, and hopefully what you design helps make other people’s memories too.”\n\nThat philosophy also very much informed her direction for education. Kas earned a bachelor’s degree in architecture from Princeton University, a program known for its strong conceptual teachings. To complement her training, Kas sought out a more hands-on and practical advanced degree experience and attained a master’s from the Yale University School of Architecture.\n\nWhile at Yale, Kas took Kent Bloomer’s course on architectural ornament, and was intrigued to the point where she interned with his studio for a summer. With her background as an artist, Kas was naturally drawn to ornament. It’s as if her early memories of ornate railings were pointing to this moment.\n\n“When you add detail to space, you embed a sense of care. Through ornament you can tell so many stories, which ultimately should complement the larger architectural work.”\n\nAfter graduating from Yale, Kas decided to stay in Connecticut. It was an easy decision since she has fallen in love with New England.\n\n“I really adore all of the unique histories the towns and cities around here have. I could go around documenting the ornament of Essex alone and who knows when I’d be done. There is an intense sense of place here. And being able to walk, bike, or take the train anywhere is certainly a plus.”\n\nFluent in Spanish, English and French, Kas joined Centerbrook after graduating from Yale. She resides in Essex, Connecticut, with her partner Misha Semënov-Leiva, another designer at the firm. She enjoys hiking and other outdoor adventures, reading about ancient Rome, hanging out with her pup Daphne, and baking. Above all else, Kas enjoys her free time creating quasi-surrealist paintings.\n\nFollowing a pair of summer internships with Centerbrook, Ben joined the firm’s full-time staff in the summer of 2018 upon graduation from the esteemed Architecture, Art and Planning program at Cornell University.\n\nA second-generation designer, Ben was able to step in right away and provide technical assistance for Centerbrook design teams through his expertise with software programs like Lumion, Revit, Grasshopper and Rhinoceros 3D. During his second internship with Centerbrook, Ben was instrumental in implementing virtual reality at the firm.\n\nOriginally from Suffield, Connecticut, Ben’s father is an architect and his mother was a graphic designer. Despite the family’s artistic influence, he wasn’t overtly drawn to the profession growing up. Only as an upperclassman at Suffield Academy – when it came time to start applying for colleges – did he reach a decision on what and where to study. With a design career in mind, Ben picked Cornell, annually ranked at or near the top of the Architectural Record list of “America’s Top Architecture Schools.”\n\nBeyond his technical proficiencies, Ben has professional interests in sustainability, digital fabrication and parametric design.\n\nIn his spare time, Ben’s hobbies include metal and woodworking. He also enjoys sailing and target shooting.\n\nPatrick fashioned his first architectural model for Centerbrook in 1990 when he was a freelance design consultant. He earned his bachelor of science degree in industrial design from the University of Bridgeport, and prior to becoming the firm’s master model maker and industrial designer in 2006, he worked as a mason, a toy designer for Hasbro, a welder/metal artisan, and an exhibition designer.\n\nIn addition to intricate and often quite large scale models of Centerbrook projects, Patrick fabricates and creates prototypes of lighting fixtures, furniture, and custom architectural features, such as a fountain for the School of Medicine at Quinnipiac University. His six-foot two-inch replica of the historic powerboat “Aphrodite,” a gift from the firm to the client, is on permanent display at the Ocean House in Watch Hill, Rhode Island. He has been a visiting instructor at the University of Bridgeport’s Industrial Design Department and leads the Centerbrook workshop on handcraft and making for the architectural staff.\n\nPatrick credits a high school art teacher, a stonemason, and his father for instilling in him the determination to make and to fix things the right way. “My interest in design came from my dad, who is very artistic and handy,” he says. “Growing up, I was always interested in watching him work, whether he was making built-in cabinets for our bedrooms, fixing the lawnmower, tuning the car, or painting the house. By necessity and talent, he could do that whole Yankee self-sufficiency thing. I have found that what is simple and practical can also be beautiful.”\n\nJudge of urban park furniture competition sponsored by Architecture for Humanity’s New Haven chapter\n\nCenterbrook Travel Grant recipient\n\nDesigned, built, and donated Chitty Chitty Bang Bang to local high school thespians\n\nPlays ice hockey\n\nMantra: “Don’t overthink it.”\n\nSheryl, head of Centerbrook’s Library and Product Resources Department, is unique in the office. No one contributes to as many projects or researches new products as thoroughly. For example, innovations which increase energy conservation and end-user wellness. More than 80 percent of the firm’s jobs – whether great or small, academic or corporate, residential or cultural – require her advice, aesthetic acumen, and her product knowledge and research. Her duties entail assisting the architectural staff in sourcing solutions for finishes and design systems – everything from acoustic, flooring and lighting products, to highly sustainable structural and building envelope materials.\n\nSheryl joined Centerbrook in 1985 after graduating from SUNY New Paltz with a bachelor’s degree in Italian language, literature, and art history. She spent the next six years in Italy, where she worked as a teacher and translator. Sheryl was fortunate to take a couple of architecture classes at the University in Florence, which enhanced her desire to work in the profession.\n\n“I was always interested in art and design growing up. I loved to draw,” she says. “My mother subscribed to Better Homes and Gardens and I’d pour over the houses, examining the architectural plans to see how everything was arranged. Both parents contributed to my interest in design, art and architecture. I learned from their appreciation for fine quality, perfected handcraft and detailed construction.”\n\nSheryl has been fortunate in her career to not only work at a place that carries craft and quality as its mantra, but also play an essential role in that effort.\n\n“The great thing about my job is that I’m always learning new things. There are continuously new products and systems and technologies to evaluate, and Centerbrook is doing a wider variety of projects now than ever before.”\n\nCoordinates the Centerbrook Lunch & Learn program on innovative products\n\nFavorite projects have involved historic preservation, renovation, and sustainable design\n\nOrganizes Centerbrook’s annual holiday gift effort for foster children\n\nHas taken graduate level fine arts courses at Wesleyan University\n\nEnjoys being ‘lost’ in gardening and working on projects in and around her house\n\nIs still enamored with the Italian language and all of its eloquence\n\nMatt didn’t have to look too far to find role models. His father worked for the pioneering modern architect Edward Durell Stone in New York City and his mother has a degree in fashion design.\n\nThe family moved to South Windsor, Connecticut, where his father started his own firm and his mother designed baby clothing and chaired the planning and zoning commission. Matt worked some summers for his dad, helping to design custom homes, elderly housing, and condominium projects, and spent other summers landscaping or designing and framing custom homes for a local builder. He experienced the building environment from soup to nuts.\n\nMatt earned a bachelor's degree in architecture from New York Institute of Technology, graduating Cum Laude, and was inducted into the honor society in architecture and allied arts. He worked for two Connecticut firms before joining Centerbrook in 1999. He has contributed to academic projects at Quinnipiac University, Yale University, the University of Connecticut, and the National Outdoor Leadership School in Colorado. He is proud to have had the opportunity of working on the 9/11 Memorial, Festival Plaza, as well as Development Services and McCoart buildings in Prince William County, Virginia.\n\nFor his Centerbrook Travel Grant, Matt visited Taliesin West in Arizona, Frank Lloyd Wright’s winter home and school in the desert. “I had visited Fallingwater in Pennsylvania on a school trip and just loved it, along with his work in general. The two houses are so different, yet each is so masterfully connected to their respective sites. At Taliesin, his apprentices would come and have to design and build their own housing with local materials, and examples still dot the landscape.”\n\nIn addition to hand drawing and Revit design software, Matt is handy with a driver and 9 iron, periodically representing the firm in charity golf tournaments.\n\nContributed to a residential project that was published in Architectural Record\n\nCoaches Little League baseball and youth soccer\n\nEnjoys mountain biking, ice hockey, and fly fishing\n\nChuck has strong family ties in Switzerland, where the rich fabric of life, as well as the tapestry of buildings, people, and culture first mesmerized him as a child. He was fascinated by the happy accidents resulting from the mix of medieval and modern building elements. Throughout his career, Chuck has been focused on infusing the familiar with the unexpected by delving deeply into the history of both client and place.\n\nUpon receiving a Bachelor of Architecture degree from Rhode Island School of Design in 1984, Robert L. Harper, FAIA - a founding partner of Centerbrook’s predecessor firm Moore Grover Harper, and adjunct faculty member at RISD - invited him to join Centerbrook.\n\nWhile he is a sought after residential architect, Chuck also has more than 35 years of experience designing a variety of cultural and academic buildings for clients, such as Stepping Stone Museum for Children in Norwalk, The Norton Museum of Art in West Palm Beach, Florida, the Thompson Exhibition Building at Mystic Seaport Museum, Quinnipiac University, and Dartmouth College. Chuck is currently involved with a student center and dining project at the University of St. Joseph in West Hartford, and in the planning of expansions for the Florence Griswold Museum in Old Lyme and Hill-Stead Museum in Farmington.\n\nArticles he’s written on library design in the digital age have been widely published, and his recent portfolio includes the design of libraries in Connecticut and Massachusetts. Projects he has worked on have won more than 20 design awards.\n\nChuck was named senior director in 2014 and is a member of the American Institute of Architects and the American Library Association. He is a regular visiting critic, panelist, and guest lecturer at both RISD, and Massachusetts College of Art.\n\nAway from the office, Chuck’s passions include cycling, hiking, woodworking, and pulling the best espresso shots this side of the Atlantic.\n\nRaised in the rural Connecticut, Alan was an accomplished “odd jobber” by age 15, working on varied restoration projects from an 18th century farmhouse and Victorian villa to vintage Chevys and BSA motorcycles. He also was adept at abstract painting and detailed pen and ink drawings of the natural world. These talents, and a Swamp Yankee “do it yourself” propensity, would serve him well in his architectural career: he liked to see how things worked by a process he calls “selective demolition.”\n\nAlan pursued his bachelor in architecture with a minor in historic preservation from Roger Williams University, and earned a masters in architecture with an emphasis on urban design at University of Pennsylvania. Between college and grad school he served as president of the 10,000-member American Institute of Architecture Students and sat on the national AIA Board of Directors.\n\nAfter working for New Jersey and Pennsylvania firms on academic, research and master planning projects, Alan joined Centerbrook in 2006 and was named an associate in 2012. He has contributed to sundry projects, among them: the Ocean House, which involved the replication of a historic resort hotel, the medical school at Quinnipiac University's North Haven Campus, and a new alumni and visitors center at Duke University.\n\nTwo of his favorite buildings are worlds apart: Kikutake’s administration building at the Izumo Shrine in Japan and the Biomass Heating Facility at the Hotchkiss School in Connecticut, which he oversaw as Project Manager and which has won several awards, including an AIA New England Honor Award. The building, which has been widely published, has reduced both emissions and fuel costs dramatically for the school.\n\n“I enjoyed working on the woodchip-burning plant because we were designing a place that had a great backstory and, in spite of its utilitarian function, it’s really an elegant building. It also is designed to serves as an ancillary “real world” classroom – it’s not your average furnace.”\n\nLEED Accredited Profession\n\nCenterbrook Travel Grant recipient\n\nLike to fish, travel, wax sarcastic\n\nTaps Centerbrook’s sugar maple trees, shares the result\n\nDavid was an art student, standing on the shore of Lake Michigan, when he realized that architecture was what he was about. At the time he was working on a video art installation – camped out with a tarp and blanket, in the fall, on a public beach – and had ample time to contemplate the vast organic form that is Chicago.\n\n\"I saw that architecture could collapse the distance between object and patron,\" David says. \"Something I had been working toward previously through video, installation, and sculpture.\"\n\nDavid proceeded to earn his bachelor's degree in architecture at Cooper Union and his master's at the Yale School of Architecture, where his interest in the relationship between the built and the natural world led him to take a number of courses at the Yale School of Forestry and Environmental Studies (in a building that Centerbrook helped to design).\n\nAfter working for two Connecticut firms, he joined Centerbrook in 2013 and has been on design teams developing a three-campus master plan for Quinnipiac University and sports facilities for field hockey, lacrosse, and soccer.\n\nHe continues to sculpt, paint, and plan installations, including one that would combine design with one of his pastimes: beekeeping.\n\nHas worked as a carpenter and a mason\n\nConversant in the latest digital design programs\n\nOverly ambitious gentleman farmer\n\nEnjoys longboarding and Tai Chi\n\nLegos and Lincoln Logs. The gateway toys to an architectural career.\n\nLike a number of his fellow designers at Centerbrook, Matt Russo didn’t grow up in architecture. But, in another commonality, he was influenced by those ever-popular building sets, and pop-up books by his favorite childhood author David A. Carter.\n\nMatt and his brother, who later went to engineering school, eventually took things to the next level. At Halloween, they would collect cardboard boxes from a local appliance store to make haunted houses for their garage in Branford, Connecticut.\n\nAs he got farther along into school and sports, Matt drifted from the maker mindset, but high school art classes in sculpture and multi-media rekindled an interest in design and he was inspired by a teacher to explore a creative major in college. Harkening back to his youthful building interests, he decided on architecture.\n\nMatt attended Roger Williams University in Rhode Island, where he earned both bachelor’s and master’s degrees in architecture. Along the way, he spent a semester abroad at Barcelona Architecture Center in Spain and supplemented his training with a couple of valuable internships.\n\nBetween his junior and senior years, Matt sought out a summer job working in construction in Hilton Head, South Carolina, where his family had vacationed since he was a toddler. He hoped it would be beneficial to practice the other end of the building process, and he came away with a healthy appreciation for the trade.\n\nHe parlayed the construction job to an architectural internship in South Carolina the following summer, an experience that Matt attributes with bridging his conceptual design background – at that point in his education – with the more technical work that he’d delve deeper into during grad school.\n\nMatt completed architecture school in 2019 and joined Centerbrook that fall.\n\nBeyond architecture, Matt likes to stay active. He had all three seasons covered throughout his school years playing soccer, hockey and tennis. Going to college, he wanted to continue playing team sports, but didn’t know if he’d have enough time due to the demands of architecture school. He tried out for the Roger Williams men’s tennis program and ended up playing all four years. He enjoyed the experience so much that he stayed on as an assistant coach during grad school.\n\nIn addition to tennis, Matt also enjoys traveling and cooking, which provides another creative outlet as well as an opportunity to connect with family.\n\nWhile Matt is still getting his feet wet as a professional designer, he one day hopes to pursue his interests in urban waterfront design.\n\nAndrew has been around, as befits someone who spent his formative years in far corners of New England, from southern Connecticut to Houlton, Maine (near Caribou), after which his family moved south, to Burlington, Vermont.\n\nWhile earning dual bachelor's degrees in architecture and building science at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in the slightly warmer climes of Troy, New York, Andrew took a welcome semester abroad in sunny Rome. Then, after working for a firm in Missouri, he and his new bride took an extended excursion throughout Europe: to Ireland and Paris and up the northern coast to Norway, finally into the Arctic Circle via a nostalgic cargo cruise ship, the MS Lofoten. They proceeded to tour the eastern coast of America, camping their way down to Florida, where their savings ran out. Andrew went back to work, for a firm in New Hampshire, before joining Centerbrook in 2007.\n\nHe has worked on projects at Quinnipiac University, including residence halls, a wind farm, and a student center. He also served as the co-project manager Academic Science and Laboratory Building at Southern Connecticut State University. Andrew has also coordinated early conceptual energy modeling efforts for Centerbrook projects.\n\nWhen not designing, Andrew is busy enjoying outdoors activities with his family – pond skating, canoeing, camping, fishing etc. – and working on their circa 1865 home. A boat tinkerer, he has reconstructed a sunfish for his kids. He and his wife Amy are Cub Scout den leaders, and he coaches Little League.\n\nAndrew also designed and built an elegant and highly crafted wooden chair – a chaise longue/Adirondack cross – for the Centerbrook Chair Workshop: “Nautically inspired, my design features boat-like elements. A wavy base, laminated keel, shaped frames, and steam-bent planking come together as an invitation to sit. White oak, both kiln dried and green, sapele mahogany, waterproof glues, stainless steel, and silicon bronze fasteners hold together this outdoor lounge chair. It is designed for watching vessels come and go from your favorite inlet.”\n\nNamed Centerbrook Associate in 2013\n\nBoated down the Barrow River in Ireland for a week\n\nSue has had a multifaceted career. She earned her bachelor of science degree in criminal justice from Bryant University and served as a legal assistant for a state judge and as a security investigator for Colt Firearms, both in Hartford, before moving to southeastern Connecticut with her husband. She worked for the Lee Company, a major aerospace manufacturer, and then as a preschool teacher for a decade before joining Centerbrook in 2000.\n\nHer diverse skills have been well suited for a number of positions here, including front office support staff, producing marketing materials, and her current post as shop drawing administrator. Sue tracks and coordinates all submittals with the design team and consultants, everything from shop drawings to building samples. She makes sure the submittals are categorized correctly and returned on time to the general contractor. She also archives the drawings, plans, and other relevant materials for completed jobs.\n\nAlthough Sue does not have an architectural background, she gets to see buildings evolve from the early stages of site work to completion. “Each building has its own unique features and I get to learn about everything that goes into that space, from the mundane – like piping and wiring – to the beautiful interior and outdoor spaces.”\n\nNo one else in the firm is involved in each and every job Centerbrook does.\n\nOfficer of the Clinton Land Trust\n\nSings soprano in the Choir at her synagogue, Congregation Beth Shalom Rodfe Zedek\n\nLoves to travel: been to South Africa, Hawaii, New Zealand, among other places\n\nThe son of biologists who emigrated from Russia, Misha was exposed early and often to the natural environment that surrounded his San Francisco home. These childhood experiences shaped many of the personal and professional interests he pursues to this day.\n\n“Biology has always been a fascination for me because I grew up with my parents taking me out for hikes, camping, and exploring in the parks of northern California nearly every weekend. A lot of my curiosity and love for all life forms was instilled by them.”\n\nOn a parallel track, Misha also developed a youthful interest in design, often sketching vast imaginary cities both for humans and for his favorite animals. He recalls a time from his teens at NatureBridge Headlands, an environmental education center just outside of San Francisco, when his interests in biology and design first began to intersect.\n\n“Working as an environmental educator taught me a lot about how people can connect to place in a meaningful way – our mission was to get Bay Area kids, many of them from the inner city, to get to know and care for the plants, animals, and ecosystems that surrounded them. I realized the siting and design of the campus itself was a teaching tool and an important part of that equation. That became part of my mission: to build buildings that could help reconnect humans with the rest of nature.”\n\nWhen deciding what to pursue in college, Misha initially chose the path of design, and graduated as the valedictorian of his Princeton University class with a Bachelor of Arts degree in architecture.\n\n“I felt a tension entering college about whether I wanted to pursue ecology and nature or architecture and design. I think my big moment was when I realized they weren’t mutually exclusive.”\n\nYale University provided the opportunity to study both at the graduate level, so Misha entered the schools of architecture and forestry and environmental studies. He enjoyed the dichotomy of the programs, and the challenge of linking the two when their respective cultures were so unique.\n\n“The design world was all about how things looked and how they were presented. Designers were often ignorant of the science because the field is so focused on image and presentation. In the world of environmental science and ecology, on the other hand, good science wasn’t reaching decision makers or the public precisely because it was not visualized or communicated effectively.”\n\nThe lone member of his graduating Yale class to complet"
