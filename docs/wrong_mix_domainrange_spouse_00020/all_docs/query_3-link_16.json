        "text": "Dexter Morgan\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Dexter Morgan\n\nMichael C. Hall\n\nMaxwell Huckabee (age 3)\n\nNicholas Vigneau (young Dexter, season 7)\n\nDominic Janes (preteen Dexter)\n\nDevon Graye (teenage Dexter)\n\nDexter \"Dex\" Morgan is the titular protagonist and narrator of the series. Dexter is a forensics expert and blood spatter analyst employed by the Miami Metro Police Department, but has a double life as a vigilante serial killer. As young boys, he and his older brother Brian witnessed the murder of their mother, Laura Moser and were left for two days in a shipping container filled with blood. The incident left them psychologically scarred. Soon afterwards, Dexter was adopted by Harry Morgan, who hoped to help repress his memory of the death of his mother. He soon realized that Dexter had an insatiable urge to kill that would begin to intensify. Harry, frustrated with the number of people who avoided justice, decided to train Dexter as a killer who would target and dispatch other murderers.\n\nDexter considers himself emotionally divorced from the rest of humanity; in his narration, he often refers to \"humans\" as if he is not one of them. He makes frequent references to an internal feeling of emptiness, leading to several attempts in his youth to \"feel alive\". He claims to have no feelings or conscience and that all of his emotional responses are part of a well-rehearsed act to conceal his true nature. In the Season 1 of the television series, he had no interest in romance or sex; this changed when he became involved with Lila in Season 2. He initially considered his relationship with Rita to be part of his disguise; however, by the end of the Season 4, Dexter had fully evolved into a family man and wished to rid himself of his self-titled \"Dark Passenger\".\n\nThere are chinks in Dexter's emotional armor; he acknowledges loyalty to family, particularly his now-deceased, adoptive father, stating \"If I were capable of love, how I would have loved Harry\",[citation needed] since Harry's death, Dexter's only family has been his sister, Debra Morgan, Harry's biological daughter. At the end of the first novel, Dexter admits that he could not hurt Debra or allow Brian to harm her because he is \"fond of her\".\n\nDexter likes children;[citation needed] the flip side of this affection is that Dexter is particularly wrathful when his victims prey on children.[citation needed] In the book Dearly Devoted Dexter, Dexter realized that Rita's son Cody was showing the same signs of sociopathy as Dexter had at that age, and looked forward to providing him with \"guidance\" similar to that which Harry provided him. Cody's perceived sociopathy has not been shown in the television series.\n\nThis also gives him a reason to continue his relationship with Rita, to whom (as of Dearly Devoted Dexter) he is engaged because of a misunderstanding. At the beginning of the third book, Dexter in the Dark, it is revealed that Cody is not the only one with dark impulses, as Astor too pressures Dexter to teach her, and Dexter comes to accept his role as a stepfather to both children very seriously; for example, while on a stakeout, he begins to wonder if Cody has brushed his teeth before going to bed and if Astor had set out her Easter dress for photo-day at her school. These thoughts distract him while he is waiting for an intended victim, which thoroughly annoys him. In the TV series, Dexter also takes a detour in his code of only killing murderers in order to dispose of a pedophile who is stalking Astor.\n\nAnimals do not like Dexter, which can cause noise problems when Dexter stalks a victim with pets. He is quoted as having once had a dog that barked and growled at Dexter until he was forced to get rid of it, and a turtle, which hid in its shell until it died of starvation rather than have to deal with Dexter.[1]\n\nRita Bennett\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Rita Bennett\n\nJulie Benz (seasons 1–4; guest season 5)\n\nRita Bennett is Dexter's girlfriend and later wife. Rita is portrayed as a mother, who is slowly recovering from being physically abused by her ex-husband, Paul, and having difficulties maintaining a sexual relationship. Rita tentatively starts a relationship with Dexter, while remaining unaware of his extra-curricular activities. In season two, Rita's relationship with Dexter becomes troubled. After discovering that Dexter framed her ex-husband Paul with drug abuse, she suspects that Dexter owned the drugs himself. She pushes him into Narcotics Anonymous, but begins to suspect that he is having an affair with his sponsor, Lila, and breaks up with him. In anguish, Dexter turns to Lila, and consummates what had before been a platonic relationship. After Dexter lies to Lila about working late (he had gone to kill Jimenez), Lila breaks into Rita's house, afraid that they had rekindled their relationship. Angered, Dexter breaks up with her. His breakup with Lila, his love for Rita and her children, and his sincere regret over what he had done convinces Rita to start dating him again.\n\nIn season 3, Rita suddenly discovers that she is pregnant with Dexter's baby. Believing that being a parent is one of her main achievements, Rita decides to keep the baby, and leaves Dexter's role in the child's life entirely up to him. After much deliberation, Dexter decides (with Debra's help) that he will be there for the child and Rita accepts his marriage proposal. Rita loses her job when she is rude to a customer, but gets back on her feet by working as an assistant to Syl Prado.\n\nAfter the baby, Harrison, is born, Rita and Dexter move into a house together in the suburbs. Rita begins to notice a pattern of lies from Dexter, including deceiving her about the concussion he suffered in the car accident and the ownership of his old apartment. Rita and Dexter then go to a marriage counselor, who allows them to sort out their problems and instigates peace between them. However, their neighbor, Elliot, begins to fall for Rita, kissing her and pointing out that Dexter is never home. Though she initially kisses him back, she quickly ends it before something begins.\n\nDebra Morgan\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Debra Morgan\n\nJennifer Carpenter\n\nHaley King (teenage Debra)\n\nLaura Marano (young Debra)\n\nDebra Morgan (known as Deborah Morgan in the book) is the younger foster sister of Dexter and biological child of Harry Morgan. Debra believed that she truly knew her father, but is unaware of the secrets he kept, especially concerning Dexter (whom she sees as a true brother). Inspired by their father's legendary police career, Debra joined the police and desperately yearned to become a homicide detective. Initially assigned to Vice, she was transferred to Homicide at the start of the first season. Being new to the job and very insecure, she largely relied on Dexter's expertise on murderers to solve difficult cases. Debra met Rudy Cooper, who unknown to her is the Ice Truck Killer using her to get close to Dexter. She falls in love with him, but is later kidnapped by him in order to be able to reveal himself to Dexter. She is bound to a table in the same manner that Dexter kills his victims, while Dexter and Brian discuss her fate. In the show, she is unconscious, but in Darkly Dreaming Dexter, she is awake and finds out that her brother is a killer. Debra is severely affected by Rudy's betrayal; she moves in with Dexter for fear of being alone.\n\nThroughout the second season, Debra stays in her brother's apartment as she deals with the trauma of what happened, but leaves his apartment in a mess. Debra is a key member of the police task force in charge of finding the Bay Harbor Butcher, who is secretly Dexter. She falls for an older man, Frank Lundy, the FBI agent in charge of the case, all the while improving her ability on the job. By the end of Season 2, Debra has recovered from the trauma of the Ice Truck Killer, and is confident as an officer and determined to get her detective's shield.\n\nIn Season 3, Debra has had her hair cut to shoulder length, has \"sworn off men, liquor and smokes\" and is even more determined to get her silver detective's shield. She is working with a new partner, Detective Quinn, but has been approached by an Internal Affairs officer who tells her that her partner is being investigated as a dirty cop, but she refuses to help them. She was originally part of the team investigating the murder of Miguel Prado's brother, Oscar, but because of her lack of tact and people skills she was removed from the case by newly promoted Angel Batista; however, the case she had been assigned (the murder of a young woman) was eventually found to have been connected to the Skinner case, which she solved with the help of Anton, a C.I. whom she started dating after saving his life from the Skinner. Because of her success on the Skinner case, she was promoted to detective at the end of the season.\n\nShe is known to have a very foul mouth, and she hardly speaks a sentence without swearing. This has nearly gotten her into trouble, as she often speaks profanely to her superiors, only to realize a few seconds after. It finally got her into trouble in the third season, as a poorly timed public comment caused her to be kicked off the Freebo case. She is also known for being easily angered and frustrated by suspects. Though she is also frustrated at Dexter's inability to open up to her, she has defended him on more than one occasion.\n\nA conversation between her and Dexter leads to her finding out that her father slept with one of his confidential informants. She investigates the files on Harry's informants and interviews some of them, hoping to find the one with whom Harry had an affair. One of the files is shown to be that of Laura Moser. Also during this time, her relationship with Anton had been breaking, especially now that he had secured a gig in the city instead of on a cruise ship. Also, Frank Lundy returns to Miami to hunt the Trinity Killer, and Debra once again becomes involved with Lundy. Soon, both she and Lundy are shot by an unknown assailant suspected to be the Vacation Murderers. In her hospital bed, she confesses to Anton that she slept with Lundy, prompting him to leave her. Lundy died, and she eventually concludes that the Trinity Killer must have been the shooter. As a result, Debra opens an investigation on the Trinity Killer. However, it is later determined that Trinity could not have been the shooter, since her wounds from the bullet were at a horizontal line, therefore someone of Masuka's height had to be the shooter. During a Thanksgiving dinner, Debra remembers a conversation she had with Christine Hill and realizes Hill has knowledge of the shooting that no one outside the police department should possess. This leads Debra to believe that she was the shooter. This is backed up later when it is revealed that Hill is the daughter of Trinity. Hill later confesses to Debra that she was the shooter, and proceeds to shoot herself in the head. Due to her solving the Lundy killing, Debra restarts her search for Harry's C.I. mistress, and finds out about Laura Moser, and the fact that Dexter and the Ice Truck Killer were brothers.\n\nIn the revival series, Dexter: New Blood, Debra, while still dead, has replaced Harry in Dexter's mind as his \"Dark Passenger\".\n\nJames Doakes\n\nedit\n\nMain article: James Doakes\n\nErik King (seasons 1–2; guest season 7)\n\nJames Doakes is a sergeant serving as lead case investigator to Miami Metro PD's Homicide. Doakes had killer impulses which drove him to divorce his wife, confessing that if he had stayed with her any longer, he would have killed her.\n\nDoakes instinctively hates Dexter and is the only person in Dexter's life who can see through his false persona of normalcy. Doakes suspects that Dexter is hiding a dark secret and has no reservations about cursing him to his face. Ultimately, Doakes realizes that Dexter is withholding vital information on the Ice Truck Killer case and his frustration drives Doakes to physically attack him, only for Dexter to expertly fight back. Doakes' friend LaGuerta tells him to back off, but Doakes begins stalking Dexter in secret.\n\nDoakes temporarily ends his illicit pursuit when he finds Dexter at a Narcotics Anonymous meeting, supposedly for heroin addiction. Doakes erroneously believes Dexter's dark secret is that he is a drug addict whose addiction is caused by work-related stress, Doakes tells Dexter that he has seen many policemen led down the same path. Feeling sympathetic towards Dexter, Doakes briefly leaves him alone.\n\nDoakes resumes the hunt when Debra innocently reveals that Dexter does not so much as smoke. On finding Doakes meddling in his past again, Dexter goads him into a seemingly unprovoked fight in front of the entire squad room. Doakes breaks into Dexter's apartment, and stumbles upon Dexter's blood slide collection box, and realizes that Dexter could be the Bay Harbor Butcher. He steals the slides to have them analyzed. Ironically, Doakes is by now the prime suspect in the case, thanks to Dexter's manipulation of the evidence.\n\nDoakes attempts to apprehend Dexter himself in the Everglades, but Dexter gets the upper hand and locks him in Jimenez's cabin while deciding what to do next. Doakes tries to convince Dexter to turn himself in. Lila Tournay finds the cabin and blows it up by igniting propane tanks after finding out that Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher. Doakes' incinerated remains are found along with the dismembered body of Jose Garza, and so the case is closed, with the official conclusion that Doakes was the serial killer.\n\nMaría LaGuerta\n\nedit\n\nMain article: María LaGuerta\n\nLauren Vélez (seasons 1–7)\n\nLieutenant María LaGuerta is a tough, determined woman in command of the Homicide division. At the series' beginning, she had a sincere dislike for Debra which in later seasons has dissipated.[2] In the first season, she made no secret of her attraction to Dexter, with whom she flirted constantly, to his discomfort. After the first season it is suggested that she sees him more as a good friend. At the end of the first season, she is removed from command.[3]\n\nShe returns to her old job once the new lieutenant, Esmee Pascal, proves to be unstable (a state LaGuerta intentionally worsens by having an affair with Pascal's fiancé).[4] When her friend and former partner and lover, James Doakes, becomes the prime suspect in the Bay Harbor Butcher case, she tries to clear his name. Doakes is found dead in a seemingly accidental explosion along with the body of drug dealer Jose Garza, and the case is closed. As she recovers from the trauma of Doakes' death, she leads an investigation into the murder of Oscar Prado, the brother of her ex-boyfriend, Miguel Prado. She also develops a close relationship with defense attorney Ellen Wolf, and is devastated when Wolf is found murdered. After Miguel's own murder (ostensibly at the hands of The Skinner, but in reality by Dexter), she wants to find admissible evidence to prove he killed Wolf, but Dexter is able to convince her that doing so would only hurt Miguel's family and the Cuban community, and that even then there is a high chance that nothing will be proved. Reluctantly, LaGuerta drops it.\n\nAt the start of Season 4, she is shown to be romantically involved with Angel. They keep their relationship hidden from the rest of the homicide department, aside from Dexter, who both Angel and LaGuerta confide in. Their relationship hits a roadblock when she tells their superiors about their relationship so that it cannot be used against them during a trial. The consequence of her disclosure is a threat of reassignment; either Angel or LaGuerta will have to move out of Homicide. Deciding that their jobs are integral parts of who they both are, the two decide to end their relationship, and sign affidavits to that effect. Staying away from each other does not prove easy and they begin having secret liaisons once more in order to circumvent a reprimand from higher up, and also as a result of their deepening feelings for one another, they secretly get married with Dexter as witness.\n\nLaGuerta and Batista divorce in between Seasons 5 and 6.\n\nIn season 6, Captain Matthews is promoted to deputy chief and LaGuerta is promoted to fill Matthews' position. It was later disclosed that LaGuerta had blackmailed Matthews in order to become the captain. LaGuerta wanted to install Angel Batista, whom she can trust, to be the new lieutenant of homicide division, but as a payback to LaGuerta, Matthews appoints Debra Morgan to be the new lieutenant instead. Later in season 6, when Matthews was involved in a prostitute's overdose death, LaGuerta used Debra Morgan to keep the case alive and eventually leaked the information to the police chief, who forced Matthews to retire. It was implied LaGuerta would become the next deputy chief.\n\nAt the onset of Season 7, LaGuerta finds the blood slide of Travis Marshall at the scene of his death. Remembering that this is the M.O. of the Bay Harbor Butcher, she then launches an independent investigation as to whether the Butcher was still active and James Doakes was innocent.\n\nIn season 7's finale, LaGuerta finds out Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher, and arrests him. Dexter, anticipating LaGuerta's move, made it look as though she was framing him as the Butcher. LaGuerta then finds more evidence of Dexter and Debra's involvement in the death of Travis. She is eventually killed by Debra, with a shot to the chest, who finds her and Dexter in a shipping container as Dexter was trying to frame her for the murder of the killer of Dexter's mother, Hector Estrada.\n\nAngel Batista\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Angel Batista\n\nDavid Zayas (seasons 1–8; guest New Blood)\n\nAngel Batista is a detective in Miami Metro Police Department's Homicide Division. Batista is basically good-natured, with a dry sense of humor. He is also totally honest, at the request of his father on his deathbed, as well as Dexter's best friend. Angel is shown wearing a trilby hat almost all the time. After having an affair with another woman, he confesses his actions to his wife; she immediately ends their relationship, although it takes months for the painful separation to conclude.\n\nAngel takes an interest in Lila and eventually ends up sleeping with her. Lila takes rohipnol and then files rape charges against Angel. During this period, Dexter admits that if he were \"normal\", he would want to be a man like Batista. Ultimately, the charges are dropped once Lila moves to Paris.\n\nAt the start of season 3, Batista is promoted to sergeant and made the department's new lead case investigator to replace the now-deceased Doakes. He risks his career by attempting to sleep with a hooker who turns out to be an undercover cop. After persistent advances, Angel begins a relationship with the other officer, Barbara Gianna.\n\nBy the start of Season 4, it appears that Angel and Barbara have amicably split, and he has a romantic involvement with LaGuerta, although this is kept hidden from those they work with. In \"Hello, Dexter Morgan\", they secretly get married with Dexter as witness. By season 5 their marriage has become common knowledge throughout the office.\n\nBatista and LaGuerta divorce in between seasons 5 and 6.\n\nIn season 7, Batista buys a restaurant, and announces his retirement although in season 8 he still continues to work for the Miami Metro PD as a lieutenant.\n\nHarry Morgan\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Harry Morgan (Dexter)\n\nJames Remar (seasons 1–8)\n\nHarry Morgan is Dexter's adoptive father. When alive, he was a homicide detective and highly respected member of the Miami Police Department. In the course of a high-stakes drug case, Harry began an illicit relationship with Laura Moser, Dexter's biological mother, to gather information and evidence on the drug lords in question. Laura was discovered and made an example of; she and three others were executed with chainsaws in a shipping container. Her sons, Brian and Dexter, were left in the container for two days until Harry and a police team recovered them. Harry adopted Dexter, while Brian was institutionalized.\n\nAt first, Harry attempted to manage Dexter's violent urges by only allowing him to kill animals, but he eventually came to the conclusion that Dexter's pathology could not be repressed, only controlled: Harry decided to train the boy as a vigilante, to hunt and kill murderers without leaving any clues. Dexter prized these lessons as a means to fulfill his desires with his father's approval, dubbing them the \"Code of Harry\". Harry's relationship with his biological daughter Debra, meanwhile, was more complicated. She craved her father's approval, but felt that he favored Dexter.\n\nWhen Dexter was 19, Harry fell seriously ill and gave Dexter \"permission\" to kill Mary, one of his nurses, who was intentionally poisoning him with morphine. A year later when Juan Ryness, a pimp murdering prostitutes, was released due to a faulty search warrant, Harry lost his temper and told Dexter he was right in training him. When Dexter killed Ryness, Harry was horrified by the way Dexter proudly showed him the pimp's dismembered body. Harry committed suicide a few days later, by overdosing on his medication.\n\nVince Masuka\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Vince Masuka\n\nC. S. Lee (seasons 2–8; recurring season 1)\n\nVincent Masuka is the Miami Metro Police lead forensics investigator and works alongside Dexter in the lab and at crime scenes.[2] He often cracks jokes with explicit sexual innuendos to the rest of the team, and harbors decidedly unrequited feelings for Debra. He is portrayed as obsessed with sex, often making inappropriate comments with implied sexual meanings at crime scenes ending with his characteristic laughter. The kinkier the better - he is not shy about propositioning any woman he meets. He has been able to tone it down when the situation calls for it, such as when Angel was in hospital, as well as calming Debra down when Lundy returned. Detective Joey Quinn even confronted him about it, stating that his comments are why nobody likes to be around him, only for Vince to harshly brush him off. He seems to accept Joey's explanation when no one came to see his speech on his newly published work, for which he cleaned up his act and dressed formally, but soon returned to his former self. In the books, Dexter feels a kinship with him as, like him, he hides who he really is. In the novel as well as in the series, he sets up Dexter's bachelor party and kidnaps him to get him there (where, in the belief that he had been kidnapped by Ramon Prado, Dexter slugged Vince in the eye just as he opened the car trunk). He fell for the female party planner and they were in a relationship until the end of season 3. He is also shown to be greatly distraught after seeing Rita kiss another man, leading him to try to tell Dexter. In season 5, it is discovered that he has a giant tattoo of a dragon on his back.\n\nIn the novels, he is the closest thing Dexter has to a friend; Dexter senses that they are both pretending to be normal, albeit for completely different reasons. In Dearly Devoted Dexter Vince throws a large bachelor party for Dexter within a few hours of finding out about his engagement, and in Dexter in the Dark takes his role as best man so seriously that he calls in favors to hire Manny Borque, a famous caterer, for Dexter's wedding.\n\nJoey Quinn\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Joey Quinn\n\nDesmond Harrington (seasons 4–8; recurring season 3)\n\nJoseph \"Joey\" Quinn is a detective who transferred to the Homicide division after being in Narcotics before Season 3. Quinn takes a liking to Debra Morgan, even giving her a C.I. to help with the Oscar Prado case. Quinn's past is unknown and even called into question, as Debra is pressured by Internal Affairs agent Yuki Amado to gather evidence against him. Quinn got the Internal Affairs case dropped, and later confessed to Debra that the real source of the Internal Affairs investigation was from the death of a former partner of his and Yuki's who had a crystal meth addiction. Quinn knew about the partner's addiction but tried to offer private help instead of informing his superiors. He is seen at Dexter's wedding, despite Debra's advice to Dexter against inviting him.\n\nAt the beginning of season 4, Quinn is infuriated when Dexter botches a case he worked on. Soon afterwards, Dexter sees Quinn stealing money from a crime scene, and Quinn attempts to buy Dexter's friendship with expensive football tickets, but Dexter gives them away to Masuka. Meanwhile, Quinn starts a relationship with Christine Hill, a seductive reporter who takes advantage of his access to police information. After a confidential police lead appears in one of Hill's articles, Lt. LaGuerta warns Quinn to be wary of any reporter who squeezes him for confidential information over pillow talk. Nonetheless, Quinn tells Hill about numerous police reports (supposedly \"off the record\"), and she uses this information to expose Frank Lundy's return to Miami. Quinn breaks up with Hill after the article about Lundy, but they soon make up. Though more careful about what he says around her, Quinn still defends Christine when Dexter tells her to leave Debra alone, as Hill claims to have wanted to do a \"hero piece\" on Debra. All of this leads to Quinn developing a confrontational relationship with Dexter. After Hill, revealed to be Trinity's daughter, shoots herself, he is clearly distraught.\n\nIn season 5, he strongly suspects Rita was really murdered by Dexter and not Trinity, because of subtle differences in MO and because Rita shared a kiss with the neighbor. He also believes that Dexter was the Kyle Butler that was hanging out with Arthur. He tracks down Trinity's son, hoping he can identify Dexter as Kyle, but he is stopped by the FBI and suspended by LaGuerta. Unable to continue, Quinn hires Stan Liddy to investigate Dexter. After a one-night stand with Debra, Quinn repeatedly tries to get her back into bed, eventually succeeding as the two begin to date, until Debra discovers that Quinn was suspended by LaGuerta for investigating Dexter, and not taking vacation days as he had said. Liddy begins to harass Quinn but Quinn does not wish to continue investigating Dexter because of his romantic feelings for his sister, Debra. Stan Liddy was killed by Dexter in self-defense. Quinn is the main suspect because there is blood on his shoe and numerous calls between his phone and Liddy. Dexter makes the blood evidence on Quinn's shoe go away and Quinn is once again a free man. Quinn thanks Dexter, who plays dumb and just says \"For what? Just doing my job.\"\n\nIn season 7, Quinn falls for Nadia, a stripper who works at a club, The Fox Hole, operated by the Koshka Brotherhood, a Ukrainian mafia. He steals evidence that would have convicted Isaak Sirko in an attempt to win Nadia's freedom from Koshka control. After freeing her from her strip club job, Nadia runs away to Las Vegas leaving Quinn brokenhearted. In the season finale, he is seen having drinks with Angel Batista's sister.\n\nIn the finale season, Quinn lets Deb know of his returning feelings. They both resume the relationship; unfortunately, Deb does not survive her brutal attack. They were able to show their true feelings before the finale boat ride.\n\nJamie Batista\n\nedit\n\nAimee Garcia (season 8; recurring seasons 6–7)\n\nJamie Batista is Angel Batista's much-younger sister. She moves to Miami to attend graduate school, and is hired by Dexter as Harrison's nanny shortly after. Her tendency to be in scantily-clad clothing in public leads to some issues with her brother, due to their age difference. In season 6, Dexter hires Jamie as a nanny for Harrison, who quickly grows to like her. Jamie regularly works long hours for Dexter, allowing him to continue his murders.\n\nShe had begun to build a relationship with Masuka's third intern, Louis Greene, a game developer. While Jamie attempts to get Batista to accept him, he attempts to scare him away when she is away at dinner. After Dexter mails Louis' secret video of Louis with a prostitute to Jamie, she breaks up with Louis.\n\nIn season 8, she begins a relationship with Joey Quinn. Despite trying to keep it a secret, her brother Angel finds out. Meanwhile, she attempts to set Dexter up with his neighbor Cassie, shortly before Cassie is murdered by Daniel Vogel. Jamie takes a brief break from working with Dexter, mourning the loss of her friend. Joey breaks it off with Jamie after he accepts that he has still not gotten over Debra, which infuriates Jamie.\n\nTom Matthews\n\nedit\n\nGeoff Pierson (season 8; recurring seasons 1–2, 4, 6–7; guest season 5)\n\nThomas \"Tom\" Matthews is a high-ranking Miami Metro PD police official who serves as its deputy chief. Previously, he served as commanding officer of Miami Metro PD Homicide Division and the immediate superior of Lieutenant María LaGuerta. Before this, he was a lieutenant himself, serving as the superior to Harry Morgan, as well as his best friend. When Harry committed suicide, seemingly disillusioned from witnessing too many failures in the justice system, Matthews used his influence to bury any indication of suicide as well as kept his promise to Harry to look after Dexter and Debra.\n\nMatthews is portrayed as having flaws: nominal racism and serious political ambition, neither of which are ever shown in the novel series.\n\nWhile having originally promoted LaGuerta, he frequently clashed with her, trying to keep her focused on hunting the Ice Truck Killer correctly. He later fails to take his own advice, as when Neil Perry was mistakenly arrested and Matthews received all the praise, he went so far as to attempt to bury any evidence to the contrary. Seeing the investigation was being jeopardized LaGuerta revealed that several mistakes during the Ice Truck Killer case had been made, landing Matthews into serious possible trouble. Due to the fact that he was friends with both the police commissioner and the review board, Matthews escaped punishment and, having been personally embarrassed and wanting vengeance, Matthews laid all the blame on LaGuerta and as such gained approval to install Esmee Pascal as the new lieutenant to supervise her. This proved temporary however after having seen Esmee publicly break down over personal issues; his confidence in LaGuerta's abilities restored, Matthews promoted her back to her former position.\n\nMatthews' latest political effort, applying for the position of deputy chief, succeeded after Matthews used the fame of successfully ending the Bay Harbor Butcher case to propel himself to that position. Matthews did not appear in season 3, but re-appeared in season 4, having succeeded in being promoted to deputy chief, personally invested in the investigation surrounding Frank Lundy's death, and Debra's shooting. After LaGuerta and Batista reveal their relationship, he initially wants to transfer Batista out of Homicide to avoid complications during a trial. Eventually, LaGuerta and Angel both agree to end their relationship to continue working in Homicide; and while accepting this, Matthews warns them that there will be serious consequences if their relationship continues. After revealing a video of LaGuerta and Batista kissing, LaGuerta calls Tom out, asking if it was because of her gender or race that he seems to have a grudge against her. Matthews simply replies he has a grudge against her because of her arrogance. In order to circumvent a reprimand from higher up, and also as a result of their deepening feelings for one another, LaGuerta and Batista secretly get married with Dexter as witness.\n\nIn the sixth-season premiere, Matthews oddly has promoted LaGuerta to captain, which many characters note as unusual. After the ceremony, it is shown that LaGuerta had found a \"little black book\" of a brothel with Matthews' name in it, trading the evidence for her promotion. Accordingly, her promotion left the lieutenant position open, which LaGuerta attempted to secure for Batista. Matthews declares Debra a more suitable candidate, being young and famous after a shootout at a restaurant in which Debra and Quinn were involved was recorded and posted online. LaGuerta and Batista both believe that he did this in vengeance, though little was proven. His prostitute-hiring tendencies leads to a call girl dead from a heroin overdose which, while not his fault, led to LaGuerta attempting to cover up the no-fault crime scene, claiming the low clearance rate as unacceptable. Debra continues to search after a visit from the call girl's father, leading to her discovery of Matthews' involvement. LaGuerta used the information on Tom and betrayed him and had him forcibly retired by the board when she told them. Tom believed it to be Debra who sold him out but she stated she never would do that. Debra confronted LaGuerta for using such a low tactic, knowing full well she did it for her own personal gain. As such, LaGuerta will now take over Tom's position, possibly as Deputy Chief.\n\nAfter much absence, Tom is finally brought back during LaGuerta's suspicion that Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher. He is seen on his boat drinking scotch, then greeting LaGuerta as she confides her suspicion that the BHB is alive and well. Tom doesn't believe her, stating the evidence was all against Doakes, but seems to show surprise after hearing a blood slide was found at Travis Marshall's church site. Though reluctant at first, Tom decides to help after discovering LaGuerta was the one who sold him out to the board and shows his anger despite LaGuerta stating he started it. He intends to help for his own reason which is to regain his 40-year pension despite LaGuerta's displeasure at the prospect.\n\nAs they dig into the case, they revisit the cabin Doakes died in and discover that Santos Jimenez had rented the cabin, prompting Tom to realize who he is. He reveals to LaGuerta that Jimenez is responsible for Dexter's mother's death and that Brian the Ice Truck Killer, is Dexter's brother. LaGuerta connects Jimenez's disappearance and Dexter's background and immediately starts to believe Dexter set Doakes up and he is the true BHB. Tom refuses to believe her and prevents LaGuerta from questioning him, stating he'll do it having known Dexter since he was a boy.\n\nAs Tom talks personally to Dexter, he confides how LaGuerta believes he is the butcher (though Dexter is able to see that Tom also suspects it in some way.) Dexter then tells him about a boat Doakes once had to lead him off the case which has Tom believe him. He tells LaGuerta about this and she doesn't believe him stating she would have known if Doakes had a boat. They find a tackle box from the old cabin with a key inside to a marina and, believing it to be Doakes's old boat spot, search the area and find several sheets of plastic, knives and one with degraded blood on it with Doakes's fingerprints on it. This causes Tom to immediately believe Dexter, but LaGuerta still believes otherwise stating Dexter could have planted it (which is actually true). Despite this, Tom tells Maria she should move on. She says she'll keep her word and give Tom his pension, and later Tom is visited by Dexter where the two make amends.\n\nHarrison Morgan\n\nedit\n\nBrandon Michael Bass (dream version, guest season 3)\n\nVarious uncredited infant actors (recurring season 4)\n\nLuke and Evan Kruntchev (recurring seasons 5–7)\n\nLucas Adams (dream version, guest season 7)\n\nJadon Wells (recurring season 8)\n\nJack Alcott (New Blood)\n\nHarrison Morgan is the son of Dexter and Rita Morgan and the half-brother of Cody and Astor. Harrison first appears in season 4, crying in the car while Dexter tries to calm him down. His crying keeps Dexter constantly fatigued in the first part of Season 4 which in turn causes Dexter to make mistakes while practicing his \"hobby\". Dexter appears to care for him genuinely. At the end of Season 4, he is found by Dexter, crying in a pool of blood, much as Dexter had been found by Harry when he was three.\n\nIn season 5, Harrison is raised by Dexter, and is watched during the day, and sometimes night, by his Irish Catholic nanny, Sonya. It is a frequent concern of Dexter that there will be signs of a serial killer that will point to the baby following in his footsteps. This is seen when the baby inflicts harm on another child similar to how his father cuts his victims on the cheek, and when his repetition of the phrase \"Bye-bye\" sounds similar to \"Die-die.\" to Dexter. A psychologist comforts Dexter with the knowledge that the baby appears to be fine.\n\nBy season 6, Harrison has grown old enough for Dexter to enroll him at Our Lady of the Gulf Preschool in the premiere. He now has a new nanny, Batista's sister Jamie, and does not seem to have endured any permanent psychological impact from his mother's death. He is often seen playing or being read to by Dexter, who calls him a \"light\" to his \"darkness\". Harrison undergoes an appendectomy in the fourth episode, causing Dexter to have a crisis of faith.\n\nIn season 7, Harrison is missing from a few episodes while he is staying with his half-siblings, Astor and Cody, in Orlando with their grandparents. Harrison appears to bond some with Dexter's then-girlfriend and fellow serial killer, Hannah McKay.\n\nIn season 8, Dexter plans to leave Miami with Harrison and start a new life with Hannah in Argentina. Harrison is last seen with Hannah at a cafe in Buenos Aires as she discovers the fate of Dexter. Jacob Elway, Debra's former boss, is the only living person in the finale who knows Harrison is alive and on the run with Hannah.\n\nIn Dexter: New Blood, Harrison is now a teenager and reunites with his father. Approximately 10 years after the original series' finale, Dexter has moved to the fictional small town of Iron Lake, New York, posing as Jim Lindsay, a local shopkeeper. He is in a relationship with Angela Bishop (Julia Jones), the town's chief of police, and has abstained from killing for almost a decade. Debra has replaced Harry in Dexter's mind as his \"Dark Passenger\", albeit one who advises him on ways not to kill. He \"falls off the wagon\", however, when he impulsively murders Matt Caldwell (Steve M. Roberts), an arrogant stockbroker who once killed five people and got away with it thanks to his family's wealth and political clout.[5]\n\nCaldwell is officially considered a missing person, and his father Kurt (Clancy Brown) begins nosing around the investigation. Dexter destroys the corpse and alters the crime scene to make it look like Matt left town after being injured. That night, he runs into Kurt, who drunkenly claims to have gotten a FaceTime message from his son. Unbeknownst to Dexter, Kurt is a serial killer who preys on runaway teenage girls, and is trying to get the search called off so the police won't find his victims' bodies.[6]\n\nAt the same time, a now teenage Harrison (Jack Alcott) comes back into Dexter's life, having tracked him to Iron Lake. He says he lived in a series of foster homes after Hannah died of pancreatic cancer.[5] Over Debra's objections, Dexter once again becomes a father to the boy, who quickly becomes a popular student and star of his school's wrestling team, and befriends Angela's adopted daughter, Audrey (Johnny Sequoyah).[7] Harrison also causes Dexter to depart somewhat from his \"code\"; when Harrison nearly dies of a fentanyl overdose at a party, Dexter murders the drug dealer who sold him the pills by forcing him to ingest a lethal amount of the drug, having been interrupted before killing via his usual method, a stab wound to the chest.[8]\n\nHarrison is injured in a knife fight with another student, Ethan Williams (Christian Dell'Edera), whom he badly wounds. Harrison claims that Ethan told him he was planning a school shooting and stabbed him, and that he stabbed Ethan back in self-defense. When it is discovered that Ethan was indeed planning to kill several of his classmates, Harrison is hailed as a hero, but Dexter doubts his story. Using his training as a blood spatter analyst, Dexter reconstructs the fight and determines that Harrison stabbed Ethan unprovoked, and then inflicted a superficial stab wound upon himself to make it look like Ethan attacked him. Dexter searches Harrison's room and finds a bloody straight razor - the same kind of blade that Arthur Mitchell used to kill Rita - and realizes that his son has inherited his homicidal tendencies.[9]\n\nDuring a chance meeting with Angel Batista (now Captain of Miami Metro) at a police conference in New York City, Angela learns about Dexter Morgan's supposed death, and after some investigation discovers the true identity of \"Jim Lindsay\".[8] Dexter tells her the truth about faking his death - while leaving out that he is a serial killer - but she breaks up with him regardless. This causes awkwardness between them after she catches Harrison in bed with Audrey.\n\nMeanwhile, true crime podcaster Molly Park (Jamie Chung) arrives in town to do a story about the missing runaways in Iron Lake, and Dexter discovers that she did a series on the Bay Harbor Butcher. He becomes obsessed with finding out what she knows, especially after Harrison reveals that he learned the truth about Rita's death from her show. He spies on her talking to Kurt, who lies that his son is hiding out at the family cabin in order to lure her out there and kill her. He reluctantly saves her so he can get a closer look at what he correctly suspects to be Kurt's killing ground. Dexter grows alarmed as Kurt becomes a mentor to Harrison, especially after Kurt encourages the boy to break another student's arm during a wrestling match.[10]\n\nWhen Angela finds the mummified corpse of her friend Iris, who disappeared 25 years earlier, she asks Dexter to analyze the remains, and tells him that she suspects Kurt of killing her. Dexter leads her toward investigating Kurt as a serial killer in hopes that exposing his crimes will destroy his influence over Harrison. She arrests Kurt for Iris' murder, but Kurt surprises her by saying that his late father, Roger, committed the crime. (A flashback reveals that Kurt did indeed kill her, however.) When Kurt is released, he tries to intimidate Dexter by hinting that he knows he killed Matt, and Dexter realizes that he will have to kill Kurt to protect Harrison and himself.[11]\n\nDexter arrives at Kurt's cabin just in time to save Harrison from Kurt, who runs off. He tells Harrison that they have the same \"Dark Passenger\", and for the first time truly bonds with his son.[12] At first, Dexter tells Harrison that he merely \"confronts\" murderers to make them stop killing, but Harrison eventually figures out that Dexter kills his victims. Harrison reveals that he remembers seeing Mitchell kill Rita, and that he is filled with a violent rage all the time. He then says that Kurt deserves to die, and father and son set out to kill him.[13]\n\nTogether, they find Kurt's victims, including Park, perfectly preserved and displayed in a bunker underneath his house. Dexter intentionally triggers an alarm to let Kurt know they found his hiding place. As intended, Kurt rushes back to his house, where Dexter incapacitates him and prepares a kill site in Kurt's own bunker. When Kurt claims that he \"saved\" his victims from lives of pain and suffering, Dexter kills him as Harrison watches, and resolves to teach him \"the Code of Harry\". They return to Dexter's cabin to find that Kurt had burned it down the night before. They stay with Angela and Audrey, now Harrison's girlfriend, and start to bond as a family - until Angela finds evidence, left by Kurt, exposing Dexter as Matt's murderer. She then sees a connection between that proof and new evidence uncovered by Park on the Bay Harbor Butcher case, and realizes that Dexter is the killer.[13]\n\nIn the finale episode, \"Sins of the Father\", Angela arrests Dexter for Matt's murder. He flees the station after having contacted Harrison using the deputy Logan's phone.\n\nHe meets up with Harrison and tells his son to leave town with him. Harrison sees blood on Dexter's face, however, and figures out that he killed Logan, Harrison's wrestling coach who had been a friend and mentor to him. Horrified, Harrison says that Dexter's \"code\" is a lie he tells himself to justify the murders he enjoys committing, that Rita and Debra would be alive if not for him, and that whatever darkness is in him is Dexter's fault. Dexter reflects on all the innocent people in his life who have died because of him, and finally sees that he can never be the good man and father that he wants to be. He tells Harrison that the only way out for both of them is for Harrison to kill him. After a moment's hesitation, Harrison shoots Dexter in the chest with the hunting rifle Dexter gave him for Christmas. Dexter tells Harrison he \"did good\" as he succumbs to his wounds, and sees Debra holding his hand as he dies. Moments later, Angela arrives at the scene and allows Harrison to escape. Harrison leaves Iron Lake, and reads the goodbye letter Dexter wrote to Hannah 10 years earlier, telling her to \"let me die so my son can live\".[14][15]\n\nAngela Bishop\n\nedit\n\nJulia Jones (New Blood)\n\nAngela Bishop is a small town, rural New York police chief and Dexter's current girlfriend. She is the adoptive mother of Audrey Bishop and a participant in the search for Matt Caldwell.\n\nAudrey Bishop\n\nedit\n\nJohnny Sequoyah (New Blood)\n\nAudrey Bishop is the adoptive daughter of Angela Bishop. She is in an on-off relationship with Dexter's son Harrison.\n\nLogan\n\nedit\n\nAlano Miller (New Blood)\n\nLogan is a police officer in Iron Lake serving under Chief Angela Bishop. Logan was also close friends with Dexter, who he knew as 'Jim Lindsay', and took a mentorship role towards Harrison when he arrived in Iron Lake. After Dexter is arrested for the possibility of being the Bay Harbour Butcher as well as the murder of Matt Caldwell, Logan still hopes he is innocent. To escape from his cell, Dexter lures him over and slams his head against the bars, before putting him in a chokehold and demanding his keys. Realising Angela was right about him, Logan drew his gun and attempted to shoot Dexter: Dexter dodged the shot though, and snapped Logan's neck. He then stole his keys and escaped the cell and station. Logan was Dexter's final victim, as well as the final violation of the Code of Harry. Despite the blatant violation of the Code that was Logan's murder, Dexter showed absolutely no remorse or guilt, instead focused solely on escaping with Harrison.\n\nKurt Caldwell\n\nedit\n\nClancy Brown (New Blood)\n\nKurt Caldwell is the father of Matt Caldwell and owner of a truck stop diner. He is secretly a serial killer, primarily targeting women. After Matt is murdered by Dexter, Kurt rallies a search party, only to lie that Matt is still alive after the search threatens to expose his illegal activities. Kurt continues to investigate Matt's death on his own, eventually uncovering that Dexter is responsible for the murder. Kurt takes Harrison under his wing as a form of revenge, encouraging the boy's dark impulses and intending to kill him in front of Dexter. After an attempt on Harrison and Dexter's lives fail, Kurt attempts to murder them by setting Dexter's cabin on fire, only to realize his bunker has been infiltrated after receiving a notification on his phone from his security system. Kurt returns home, where he is killed and dismembered by Dexter. The bodies of his victims are later found by Angela-based on a tip from Dexter and she contacts the FBI and the State Police for help with dealing with them.\n\nKurt is based on serial killer Robert Hansen.\n\nRelatives of Dexter and Rita\n\nedit\n\nAstor Bennett\n\nedit\n\nChristina Robinson\n\nAstor Bennett is the daughter of Paul and Rita Bennett.[2] When Paul returns home from prison, Astor, who remembers her father's abuse (and is in fact the one who called the police on Paul), is saddened but comes to love her father, who appears to have changed; she did, however, force Paul to promise that he would not hit Rita again. She has a good relationship with both Paul and Dexter, oblivious to the tension between the two men. At the end of the first season, Paul is back in prison and Rita tells him that he can either explain to Astor and Cody all the bad things he had done or never see them again.\n\nDuring season two, Astor tries to maintain her relationship with Dexter even though he broke up with her mother. Dexter's love for Astor and Cody helps convince Rita to rekindle their relationship.[16]\n\nIn season 3, Astor brings out a protective streak in Dexter, in that Dexter kills a pedophile who was targeting her. He also considers her and Cody his family; in the aforementioned episode, he refers to them as his \"cubs\", and later says that nobody hurts \"his children\". Astor is the maid of honor at Dexter and Rita's wedding.\n\nIn season 4, Astor starts acting out: being rude to both Dexter and her mother, being in a constantly angry mood, and flirting with an older boy. She and Dexter come to a peace after he promises to stop treating her like a child and admits that sometimes he is simply \"dumb\". Her attitude improves following this, though not by much. When he tries to become more involved with Astor's life, she often became hostile, at one point even asking \"why do you hate me?\" when he tried to suggest after school activities.\n\nIn season 5, Astor lashes out at Dexter in anger, blaming him for the death of their mother and for raising false hope that they could be a normal family. In episode 2, she and her brother move in with her grandparents in Orlando after her mother's death. In episode 9 of the season, Astor appears at Dexter and Rita's old home, to Dexter and Lumen's surprise, since Lumen was residing in the home at the time. She and her friend, Olivia, were drunk and Dexter allows her to stay there, wanting to patch things up with his stepdaughter. While initially uncooperative, when her friend's domestic abuse issues are brought to light, Dexter takes matters into his own hands and teaches Astor's friend's mother's boyfriend a lesson and drives him away. Astor thanks him for his support, having thought that he would not want to help, and invites him into their grandparents' house. By the end of season 5, Astor is ready to agree to spending the summer with Dexter.\n\nAstor returns in season 7, episode 8, along with her brother Cody.[17] It is revealed that she now smokes pot.\n\nIn the books, Astor and her brother Cody are two parts of a whole, with Cody performing killings and Astor acting as a sort of mentor who watches. Both she and her brother are kidnapped in Double Dexter, a sequel novel by Jeff Lindsay.\n\nCody Bennett\n\nedit\n\nDaniel Goldman (season 1, 11 episodes)\n\nPreston Bailey (season 2 to season 7, 34 episodes)\n\nCody Bennett is the son of Paul and Rita Bennett.[2] Cody does not remember the abuse his mother suffered at the hands of his father, so, when Paul returns home from prison, he is overjoyed. He has a good relationship with both Paul and Dexter, oblivious to the tension between the two men.\n\nDuring Season 2, Cody tries to maintain his relationship with Dexter, even though he broke up with their mother; he hides toys in his bag, forcing him to come to their home to return it, and asks Dexter to attend an oral report he makes in class. Dexter's love for Cody and Astor helps convince Rita to rekindle their relationship.[16]\n\nAs Season 3 begins, Dexter's relationship with Cody has developed to such an extent that Cody asks him to be a speaker at his school for Parent's Day, while Dexter's presentation of himself as a blood-spatter specialist does not go well with the other kids, Cody tells him that it would have been worse if Dexter had not been there. He also considers Astor and Cody his family; he refers to them as his \"cubs\", and later says that nobody hurts \"his children\". Cody is the ring-bearer at Dexter and Rita's wedding.\n\nCody learns of his mother's death but does not show any hostility towards Dexter, even growing closer to him. But when Astor insists that she wants to leave Miami and live in Orlando with her grandparents, Dexter makes Cody go with his sister because he believes the bond between him and Astor is something he should preserve. In later episodes, Dexter notes that he is still talking with Cody. After Dexter dropped Astor off, he claims that Cody has gotten a foot taller since he last saw him.\n\nCody returned in season 7, episode 8, along with his sister Astor.[18]\n\nIn the books, Astor and her brother Cody are two parts of a whole, with Cody performing killings and Astor acting as a sort of mentor who watches. Cody is able to sense Dexter's \"Dark Passenger\".\n\nDoris Morgan\n\nedit\n\nKathrin Lautner\n\nDoris Morgan is Debra's biological and Dexter's adoptive mother. She died of cancer when Debra was 16. Doris is seen briefly in two flashbacks in season 1, in one scene in a picture that is replicated by the Ice Truck Killer, and in the other urging her husband to contact Dexter's biological father for a blood transfusion,[19] and again in another flashback in season 2, suggesting that Dexter be tested by a psychologist.[4]\n\nLaura Moser\n\nedit\n\nSage Kirkpatrick\n\nLaura Lynn Moser is Dexter and Brian's biological mother. She was involved in the drug trade and had a habit of painting her fingernails in different colors. She and three others were sawed into pieces in a shipping container as her two sons watched, causing their murderous urges.[3][20][21] In the second season, it is revealed that Laura had an affair with Harry Morgan and was working as a police informant, trying to get evidence against Santos Jimenez's boss. She is not named in the books and no such revelation is made. Laura appears in season 3 during two of Dexter's visualizations of Harry. While Dexter is tracking a victim on a cruise, she sits with Harry as if they were vacationing together, much to Dexter's discomfort. In the season finale, she appeared, again with Harry, at Dexter's wedding appearing to be happy for her son. Her mugshot was also briefly seen on Debra's desk as she investigated her father's infidelity. When Debra's investigation of another informant (coincidentally the file before Laura's) leads her to discover her father having multiple affairs with informants, she angrily gives up on her search; Dexter takes this opportunity to shred Laura's file and her photo, but is unable to go through with the photo (\"I can't let her be cut up again\") and keeps the upper half in his desk. Despite Dexter's efforts, Debra and a former informant locate Laura's house, which ultimately links Dexter to Laura, and to Brian.\n\nBrian Moser\n\nedit\n\nChristian Camargo\n\nBrandon Killham (child)\n\nBrian Moser (alias Rudy Cooper, moniker The Ice Truck Killer) is Dexter's biological older brother and the main antagonist of the first season.\n\nAs children, both brothers witnessed the chainsaw murder of their mother, Laura, and afterward were left for two days with her body in a shipping container until the police found them. The memory lay buried in Dexter's subconscious for years until a therapist unknowingly reawakened the memory.\n\nIn the aftermath of the killings, Harry Morgan, the officer-on-scene, adopted Dexter, while Brian was left in the state's care. Brian believed that Morgan did not want anything to do with him because he saw him as a \"fucked up kid\". Brian suffered severe psychological trauma due to the experiences in the container and was left in a mental institution, where over time he became a violent psychopath, resulting in him also becoming a brutal murderer, even more dangerous than Dexter himself.[20]\n\nUpon being released, he went underground, refining his ability to kill and taking on the identity of a plumber he killed (Rudy Cooper) as an alias, all while searching for his brother. Eventually, Brian not only discovered Dexter's location and history upon being separated, but also discovered he was similarly \"damaged\"; upon learning this, Brian immediately plotted to reunite with Dexter for the purpose of killing people side by side.\n\nBrian went to Miami, working as a prosthetist and murdering prostitutes as the \"Ice Truck Killer\". At some of his kills and at Dexter's apartment, Brian left clues to his and Dexter's past. Brian developed a relationship with Debra, Dexter's adoptive sister, while treating one of his own victims, Tony Tucci. As Debra fell in love with him, he used Debra as a means to get closer to Dexter. The week before Dexter was informed of the death of his biological father (Joseph Driscoll) and met Brian Moser for the first time, Brian disguised himself as a cable repair man and visited the house of the deceased man. At the end of the ninth episode of the first season, it was implied that Brian had murdered Joseph Driscoll while in disguise by injecting insulin. The body was cremated before Dexter could find any evidence of murder. Brian began slowly to show more of an interest in spending time with Dexter. When Brian talked to Dexter about possibly marrying Debra, he lied about a cut on his lip. He told Dexter it was a lab accident, but in reality he received the cut while attacking and nearly killing Angel Batista. This led Dexter to the realization that Brian was the Ice Truck Killer. Brian immediately kidnapped Debra, which led to the police suspecting his involvement in the Ice Truck Killer case.\n\nAfter searching Brian's apartment, Dexter tracked him down at the site of their childhood home, where Dexter recalled that they were brothers. Brian told Dexter his history after their separation, and tried to convince Dexter to kill Debra in the same manner that he killed his victims. Dexter refused, leading to a fight between the two as the police arrived. Brian escaped the house and disappeared.\n\nBrian later attempted to kill Debra when he thought she was staying at Dexter's apartment, but instead fell into a trap set by Dexter, who then brought him to the cooling room where Brian committed his murders. After a few choice words between them, a heartbroken Dexter slashed Brian's throat and drained his blood into a bucket, killing him in the same manner as Brian did his victims, but making it appear to the police that Brian killed himself.[20]\n\nBrian's death left Dexter extremely conflicted, to the point that he began making mistakes in his killing rituals. In early episodes of the second season, Brian appeared to Dexter as a visualizations and, in the end, Dexter learned he needed to let go of his feelings about his brother before he could move on with his life.\n\nHowever, Brian returns as the dark side of Dexter after he avenges the murder of Brother Sam, becoming a darker advisor parallel to his father. After an escapade in Nebraska in which Dexter confronts a seemingly-murderous Jonah Mitchell, Dexter's adherence to the Code of Harry and Jonah's guilt lead to Dexter reaffirming his faith in his father, who returns at the end of the episode.\n\nIn Darkly Dreaming Dexter (unlike in the TV series), Brian does not use the name Rudy Cooper and does not get romantically involved with Debra. He is described as resembling Dexter so strongly that, upon seeing an image of Brian with dismembered corpses, Dexter and Debra are convinced that Dexter is the murderer; when they meet, Dexter notes that Brian is an inch or two taller, thicker through the shoulders and chest, and paler. He first meets Dexter face-to-face in a shipping container located in the same place as the one where their mother was murdered, with Debra tied up and ready for Dexter to kill. Rather than killing either Debra or Brian, Dexter lets him go, whereas he kills him in the TV series, recognizing that it is the only way to save his sister. Their professions differ as well; the books have Brian working with imports, while the series has him as a prosthetic surgeon. The age gap between Brian and Dexter is given as one year in the book and five years in the television series. In the books he is known as the Tamiami Slasher; in the show, he is known as the Ice Truck Killer. Brian returns in Dexter is Delicious after learning of the birth of Dexter's daughter. He introduces himself to Dexter's family, and he worked for the cannibalist coven that would later lure Dexter and Debra into a trap, later saving them from the cannibals.\n\nJoe Driscoll\n\nedit\n\nJoseph \"Joe\" Driscoll was the biological father of Dexter. His exact relationship with Laura Moser is not made clear, nor is it specified whether he fathered Brian Moser as well. Joe claimed he got his spider web tattoo on his right elbow while serving in the Vietnam War, but Dexter notes it is actually a prison tattoo. When Laura was exposed and murdered for being involved with the police in their attempts to bring a drug cartel to justice, Joe went underground and resettled in Dade City, Florida working as an insurance adjuster. This was why \"Joe\" adopted an alias; his real name remains unknown. Dexter does not know or remember anything about Joe until he sees his tattoo on his corpse. He later finds out he is an expert bowler and recovered from his drug abuse.\n\nHarry Morgan, Dexter's adopted father, was able to track Joe down, and convinced him to give a transfusion of his rare blood when Dexter was injured in an accident and needed surgery. Joe then received a handmade thank-you card which he kept for the rest of his life and Dexter find after his death. His will named Dexter as executor and sole heir.\n\nJoe met his death at the age of 60, when Brian (now the Ice Truck Killer and going under the alias of \"Rudy Cooper\"), who knew it was the best way to reconnect with his long-lost brother, tracked Joe down and got access to his house while posing as a cable repairman. Brian was able to slip Joe a sedative, and then injected him with insulin, causing Joe to have a seizure and die of cardiac arrest.\n\nWhen Dexter, Rita, Debra (Dexter's adoptive sister) and \"Rudy\" came to sort out Joe's house, Dexter took blood samples of himself and Joe and sent them to Vince Masuka to perform a DNA test, which came back as a match. Dexter suspected that Joe's apparent heart attack was actually murder. However, the body was cremated before Dexter could obtain proof, and thus he never found out what \"Rudy\" had done. Rudy and Dexter stole Joe's ashes and scattered them at Joe's local bowling alley.\n\nJoe and Dexter, when compared, are shown to have great physical resemblance, and Dexter also inherited his father's bowling skill.\n\nGail Brandon\n\nedit\n\nJoBeth Williams\n\nGail Brandon is Rita's mother, Astor, Cody and Harrison's grandmother and Dexter's mother-in-law.[4] Gail is a former public-school teacher who was fired by the school board due to \"philosophical disagreements\" (she disapproved of what she saw as the gradual acceptance of mediocrity in the way schools treated children and made her feelings well-known). She has extremely high standards, making her judgmental of her daughter and her grandchildren. After she arrives, she becomes suspicious of Dexter, claiming that he is hiding something. She distrusts Dexter, and believes him to be a drug addict, and believes Rita is repeating her mistake with Paul by getting involved with another addict. Near the end of Season 2, her attitude causes Rita to break off her ties with her mother and force her to leave her home and return to Michigan, not wanting her children to be exposed to her the way she was. In season 3, Gail refused to attend Dexter and Rita's wedding, claiming that because she had started teaching again she was too busy. She did, however, send a scathing card expressing her hope that Rita's third marriage would be \"the charm\", though Rita is hiding that fact in stating that her mother means the third child (it is also revealed that her surname, and therefore Rita's maiden name, is \"Brandon\").\n\nPaul Bennett\n\nedit\n\nMark Pellegrino\n\nPaul Bennett is Rita's abusive and manipulative ex-husband and the father of Astor and Cody.[2] After his release from prison, to which he was sentenced for nearly beating Rita to death, he tries to rekindle a relationship with his children, though he still harbors disdain for Rita. Paul (correctly) suspects Dexter of framing him for the drug charge that sent him to his latest stint in jail.[20] After a short while in a federal prison, he loses hope after failing to convince Rita of Dexter's plan to frame him. Rita later tells Dexter that he provoked a fight shortly thereafter with another inmate, who beat him to death with a pipe.\n\nIn the book series, Rita's ex-husband is mentioned but never makes an appearance (or is named) since he is dead before the events of the books. In the TV series, by contrast, Paul appears in the second half of the first season and in the first episode of the second season, and his interactions with Dexter lead to a key plot point. In the books, he beat Rita's children as well as beating and raping her; in the series he clearly loves his children, the two of them appearing ignorant of the full reasons why their parents split up, and his violent tendencies are directed only toward Rita, though she says that \"she bore his abuse so they wouldn't have to\", suggesting that he would have beaten them too. In the TV series, it is Astor who finally calls the police on Paul, while in the book series Rita does when he begins to beat Astor and Cody as well.\n\nBill & Maura Bennett\n\nedit\n\nSteve Eastin\n\nKathleen Noone\n\nBill & Maura Bennett are Paul's parents, living in Orlando. They are quite the opposite of their son, providing love and comfort to both Rita and her kids after her separation from Paul. First appearing (played by unknown extras) in the season four finale, taking their grandchildren to Walt Disney World, they return to Miami in the season five premiere, only to learn of Rita's murder.\n\nAfter Rita's funeral, as Astor decides she wants to live with her grandparents, rather than Dexter, Bill and Maura bring both their grandchildren with them back to Orlando. Although they are not Harrison's biological grandparents, they have shown love and have cared for him when Dexter needed them to.\n\nAdditional characters, introduced in season 1\n\nedit\n\nCamilla Figg\n\nedit\n\nMargo Martindale\n\nThe Camilla Figg of the books and television series differ significantly. In the books, Camilla Figg is a young member of the forensics team who has a crush on Dexter. She is later killed by Bernard Elan, who attempts to use her obsession with Dexter to make him suffer.\n\nIn the television series, Camilla is older than Dexter, and had a close relationship with his father. She was a records supervisor at the Miami Metro Police Station. She and her husband, Gene, were good friends with Harry Morgan and his wife. She also knew Dexter and Debra while they were children and was still very good friends with Dexter who often brought donuts to her workplace at the records room. She knew far more about Dexter's past than she let on to him and finally told him that, on Harry Morgan's orders, she destroyed the file of the crime scene where he had found the young Dexter to protect him. Near the end of the second season, she informs Dexter this will be her last year working as she is retiring. In season 3, it is revealed that she has terminal lung cancer just like her husband, who died one year earlier, as they were both smokers. On her deathbed, Figg reveals that she knew that the Ice Truck Killer was Dexter's brother as she read his report before destroying it. During her agony, she frequently asks Dexter to bring her the \"perfect key lime pie\" until he realizes it is meant as a euphemism for euthanasia. Dexter complies with her wishes, but before she dies he tells her that it was he who killed his brother. She surprises him by smiling and telling him that \"it's good you did\" right before she dies. She is the first victim of Dexter's who wanted to die by his hands as well as the first victim he felt he showed mercy towards.\n\nEsmee Pascal\n\nedit\n\nJudith Scott\n\nLieutenant Esmee Pascal is a Haitian American police officer who becomes well-respected (considered a \"real up-and-comer\" by Captain Matthews) after being shot in the line of duty but recovering. When LaGuerta oversteps her authority and embarrasses Captain Matthews with new developments in the Ice Truck Killer case, Matthews brings Pascal in to replace her. Pascal remains Lieutenant of the department well over a month after the end of the case, earning the trust of the police officers and friendship of LaGuerta, but soon begins to crack under pressure when she starts to experience personal problems with her fiancé Bertrand (portrayed by Kiko Ellsworth). She suspects him of cheating on little real evidence, which gradually casts doubt on her rationality. Her obsession becomes so strong that she uses department resources to investigate him, tracking his phone calls and having the forensics department do tests on his shirt (stating it had the smell of another woman on it). As a result of this, Captain Matthews becomes increasingly concerned that he had made the wrong decision in replacing LaGuerta with Pascal, but LaGuerta remains stalwart, apparently standing behind Pascal on principle of loyalty. Captain Matthews is impressed by LaGuerta, believing her to have abandoned her political scheming, and returns control of the Homicide Division to LaGuerta. It is later revealed that LaGuerta manipulated the whole incident, and was the one having an affair with Pascal's fiancé to try to get rid of Pascal and get her old job back.\n\nAdditional characters, introduced in season 2\n\nedit\n\nFrank Lundy\n\nedit\n\nKeith Carradine\n\nFrank Lundy was a high-ranking and illustrious FBI Special Agent, serving as one of their manhunters and the Bureau's top agent. He becomes one of the main antagonists of Season 2 after being recruited by Cpt. Matthews to lead the task force devoted to hunting the Bay Harbor Butcher.\n\nLundy was cool, calm, confident, and incredibly intelligent. He learned about the criminal mind, often finding the important case evidence the frustrated Miami PD normally overlooked. Lundy was legendary with police agencies due to him breaking impossible high-profile criminal cases (e.g. the real-life Green River Killer and the DC Sniper). On a personal level, he had a wife, who died due to cancer, and a daughter. He is fond of classical music. Lundy devotes 15 years of his career to hunting down the \"Trinity Killer\", tracking him and seeing him as the most elusive serial killer he has ever encountered, but cannot convince any of his colleagues that Trinity even exists.\n\nDuring the hunt for the Bay Harbor Butcher, Lundy became dangerously close to finding out Dexter is the Butcher he is seeking, and at the same time becomes involved in a relationship with Debra, helping her get over her left-over chaotic emotions from her time as the prisoner of the Ice Truck Killer. In the end, Dexter outmaneuvers and frames Doakes as the Butcher, causing Lundy to lead the entire police force in a full-scale manhunt to find Doakes. After Doakes is killed in a seemingly accidental explosion, the case is considered closed and Lundy moves on to find another serial killer in Oregon.\n\nAlthough Lundy retired from the FBI some time later, he continued his mission of hunting the Trinity Killer. After tracking him to Miami, Lundy, no longer possessing access to the full resources of the FBI, asked for Dexter's and later Debra's, help in pursuing the Trinity Killer. Eventually, Lundy began to close in on Trinity, going so far as to predict where and when the murders would occur, as well as identifying Arthur Mitchell (albeit unnamed) as a suspect. In the course of the investigation, Lundy and Debra rekindled their relationship, but shortly afterward, both Lundy and Debra were shot by an unseen gunman. Lundy bled out and died from his injuries. Dexter mourned Lundy's death, having seen him as a \"worthy adversary\" and feeling that he deserved a more fitting end. Debra, however, blamed herself for what happened.\n\nIn season 7, it is revealed that Lundy always doubted Doakes's culpability, and wrote about that in his notes. Eventually, Maria LaGuerta discovered them.\n\nGabriel Bosque\n\nedit\n\nDave Baez\n\nGabriel is a writer who becomes Debra's first boyfriend after Rudy Cooper/Brian Moser. He first appeared in the episode \"Waiting to Exhale\" where he met Debra Morgan at a workout gym. Noticing that Debra was checking him out, he offered to help her start training with a punching bag. This did not bode well; while taping up her hands, Debra had a flashback of her abduction by Rudy Cooper. She quickly ran from the scene with little explanation. She apologizes a little later however and they start going out. She takes him back to Dexter's apartment where she handcuffs him to the bed on the grounds that the last person she slept with tried to kill her, and Dexter walks in on them by accident. She begins to wrongly become suspicious of Gabriel and goes as far as searching his belongings and checking his e-mails. She finds an e-mail concerning a story he has written called \"The Ice Princess\" and believes that he is writing a story about her and leaves him accusingly. She then finds out that he is trying to be a children's writer and apologizes. They go on several more dates but she breaks up with him due to her increasing attraction to Frank Lundy.\n\nLila West\n\nedit\n\nJaime Murray\n\nLila West, who goes by the pseudonym Lila Tournay, is Dexter's Narcotics Anonymous sponsor and one of the main antagonists in season 2.[22] Originally from England, she works as an artist, often using stolen items in her work. Dexter begins an affair with her after his breakup with Rita. She confesses to Dexter that she became sober after unintentionally killing her ex-boyfriend while high on meth. She is in fact a sociopath who hangs out in support groups in an attempt to feel emotions she is otherwise incapable of. She immediately sees through Dexter's \"mask\" and becomes obsessed with him, believing him to be her soulmate.\n\nShe sets her own loft on fire and helps Santos Jimenez attack Dexter, believing that she and Dexter are closest in times of crisis. When she breaks into Rita's house, afraid that Dexter might have gotten back together with her, Dexter immediately ends their relationship.\n\nIn retaliation, she seduces Angel Batista, has rough sex with him, and then accuses him of rape, having taken Rohypnol immediately after sex so it would look like Angel had drugged her. Enraged, Debra asks Lundy to run a background check, discovering Lila is working under an alias. A fingerprint analysis turns up Lila's real surname (West) and that she has been illegally living in the United States on an expired visa. Debra confronts her and demands that she leave the country or be deported. Lila, following Dexter and watching him on his boat with Rita, Astor, and Cody, breaks into his van, takes his GPS device and finds the address for Jimenez's cabin. Arriving at the cabin, she finds Doakes caged inside and, upon learning from him that Dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher, decides to protect Dexter and ignites a propane tank inside the cabin, killing Doakes.\n\nAfter finding evidence that Lila killed Doakes, Dexter has the justification he needs for killing Lila. Dexter gathers his tools in a bag and goes to Lila's apartment under the guise that they will leave town together. Dexter's plan is foiled when Debra shows up and Lila walks in on them. Lila leaves the apartment, taking Dexter's bag with her. Upon examination of the bag, Lila learns of Dexter's plan to kill her.\n\nShe abducts Astor and Cody and uses them to lure Dexter inside her loft, and sets it ablaze again. Dexter and the kids narrowly escape, and Lila flees Miami. While living in Paris, Lila checks her mail and discovers a postcard from Miami with Doakes' picture on the back. Dexter emerges from the shadows, injects Lila with a spinal epidural (so he can speak his peace to her while also ensuring that her death is painless), and lays her down on the couch. Lila pleads for her life and tells him that she killed Doakes for Dexter's sake. Dexter asks if she tried to kill Rita's children for his sake as well, thanks her for helping him embrace what he is, and then stabs her through the heart. He wraps her corpse in a plastic garment bag.\n\nLila is so far one of the few main antagonists who was not given an official nickname. However, she has been called a \"vampire\" by Debra as an insult, alluding to her skin, which, according to Debra, is \"pale like a freaking corpse\". Lila has a penchant for committing arson, especially in order to murder other people by locking them in the building that she is burning/exploding. Throughout the season she exhibits other psychopathic tendencies as well, including manipulating and taking advantage of Dexter and others. She was mentioned once by Rita and once by Vince in season 4. She and Hannah McKay were the only female main antagonists throughout the series.\n\nMax Adams\n\nedit\n\nJonathan Banks\n\nMax Adams was the FBI Deputy Director who pushes Lundy aside during the investigation of the Bay Harbor Butcher. He appeared in two episodes during the second season.[16]\n\nFrancis\n\nedit\n\nTasia Sherel\n\nFrancis is a friend of Debra, and the successor to Camilla Figg as the records supervisor of the Miami Metro Police Station. She first appears in the episode \"The Dark Defender\", and has appeared in a total of 7 episodes as of the season 5 finale.\n\nAdditional characters, introduced in season 3\n\nedit\n\nMiguel Prado\n\nedit\n\nJimmy Smits\n\nMiguel Prado was a senior Assistant District Attorney, infamous for his harsh enforcement of the law, making him powerful, influential and popular with the regular police and citizens of Miami, and the main antagonist of Season 3 along with George King. He has a romantic history with Lt. LaGuerta and he comes from a well-connected family, about whom he cares greatly. As such, Prado takes it hard when his younger brother Oscar is found dead in the house of a drug-dealer nicknamed \"Freebo\", and even worse when it is found Oscar was a drug addict to whom Freebo sold and that Oscar was in Freebo's debt. Prado even goes as far as to learn the Code from Dexter, and is the third person to witness Dexter in a kill room after his father Harry and Sgt. James Doakes. With Dexter's guidance he would go on to kill a mob enforcer.\n\nLater that same night, without Dexter's knowledge, Prado kills Ellen Wolf, a defense attorney who was trying to ruin his career by claiming some mistakes he made in his cases were \"proof\" of Prado's claimed \"illicit prosecution tactics, which include witness tampering and deliberately ignoring evidence\". Dexter was disappointed with Miguel's violation of the Code and digs up Wolf's body for the police to find to teach Prado a lesson. Prado seems to have learned his lesson after a talk with Dexter, but Dexter later begins to doubt the authenticity of Miguel's friendship when he learns Miguel used exactly the same language he used in a talk between them in a talk with Rita about trust. Dexter's suspicions are confirmed when he examines the shirt Miguel gave him after the murder of Freebo. The blood on the shirt is in fact cow blood, and Dexter realizes that Miguel has been manipulating him all along. After a game of one-upmanship with regard to Ellen Wolf's murder case, with Miguel threatening to expose Debra Morgan's relationship with the CI Anton and use his position as ADA to make trouble for Dexter, Dexter decides to kill Miguel using the MO (Modus Operandi) of a sought-for killer, just as LaGuerta discovers Miguel killed Ellen. When Miguel discovers that LaGuerta is investigating him, he plans to kill her. However, Dexter discovers what Miguel is planning, traps him at LaGuerta's house when Prado goes there to kill her, and kills Miguel by garroting him, but not before telling him that he killed his brother.\n\nThe entire city of Miami mourns the passing of Miguel Prado, a hero to all, and so the City Council votes to name the city's main freeway interchange after Miguel. This greatly upsets LaGuerta, who is ready to accuse Miguel of murdering Ellen Wolf. Dexter is able to convince her that doing so would only hurt Miguel's family and the Cuban Community, and there is a high chance that nothing could be proven, so she drops it.\n\nIt was later discovered through Miguel's brother, Ramon, that he also lied about the story of defending his family from their abusive father where it was, in fact, Ramon who did it. He stated that Miguel \"always had to be in the spotlight\" and that he had been covering up for Miguel for years.\n\nMiguel is the first main antagonist to die before the last episode of a season.\n\nRamón Prado\n\nedit\n\nJason Manuel Olazabal\n\nRamón Prado was one of the three Prado brothers, and was a county sheriff with the rank of lieutenant. He was married to Sara (portrayed by Paula Miranda), and the couple had one son, Carlos (portrayed by Aramis Knight) and a daughter in pre-school.\n\nRamón and Miguel were both devastated at Oscar's death, with Ramón steadily becoming more and more unstable with time, frustrated with the Miami Police Department's handling of the murder case. Initially, Ramón attempts to keep working, though he steadily slides into alcoholism. In an effort to help his brother, Miguel tries to convince Dexter to tell Ramón about Freebo's death, but is convinced otherwise when Ramón, with a little provoking from Dexter, attacks an innocent person in front of his brother. His increasing recklessness eventually drove him to the point of kidnapping and torturing one of Freebo's clients, which in turn got him arrested by Debra and Quinn. To avoid a prison sentence, Ramón, largely disgraced in the eyes of his Miami Metro PD colleagues, unwillingly accepted the offer from the police union of early retirement with benefits, and so surrendered his gun and badge.\n\nAfter Miguel was seemingly killed by The Skinner (really Dexter to stop his murderous rampage), Ramón, desperate for someone to blame, went out of control. Having been taken on earlier as a bodyguard for Miguel against Dexter (whom he had always had a slight distrust of), and so was driven to hunt Dexter. Dexter tried to find Ramón without success, but instead Ramón showed up in a drunken rage at Dexter and Rita's rehearsal dinner, and pushed off Dexter's calm attempts at discussion. He instead drew his pistol and jammed it in Dexter's face, but was stopped and arrested by Batista and Debra.\n\nEven though \"Harry\" recommended Dexter kill Ramón out of mercy, Dexter, instead, elected to speak to him while he languished in the county jail. Dexter's words made Ramón understand and face his own demons, and brought peace between them. The result was Ramón finally coming out with the source of all his pent-up anger, frustration and distrust: Miguel. All of his life, Ramón remained in his famous brother's shadow (and even helped to build it—such as knocking their abusive father down the stairs and letting Miguel take the credit), that, while Miguel had the appearance, charm, and even the intelligence, Ramón had the strength and spent his whole life holding Miguel's legend together. Now that Miguel was dead, Ramón let go of his harsh behaviors so as to not pass it on to his beloved son and daughter.\n\nAs one last favor from his famous brother, Ramón was released a matter of days later.\n\nAnton Briggs\n\nedit\n\nDavid Ramsey\n\nAnton Briggs is a pot-smoking guitarist who is a confidential informant (CI) for Detective Joey Quinn. Quinn helps Debra out by giving her Anton's information in hopes that he will help her find a lead to Freebo, to which he obliges. Debra continues to meet with Anton to help her find information about both Freebo and later The Skinner because of his connections. Debra becomes close to Anton and eventually develops a romantic relationship with him, which occasionally clouds her judgment. She also finds out that Anton is not officially a CI because Quinn was trying to do him a favor by keeping it off the books. The police end up using Anton as bait in a possible trap for The Skinner, but Debra objects. The Skinner kidnaps Anton and removes two strips of skin from his back before Debra and Quinn rescue him. After Debra finds out that her father cheated on her mother with a CI, she becomes wary of Anton and they eventually break up. At the end of Season 3, they get back together when Debra realizes (with the help of Dexter) that her father Harry would have been so proud of her for being a great cop and getting her detective shield, regardless of her relationship with Anton. At the start of Season 4, their relationship starts to move forward just as Lundy returns and admits he still has feelings for Debra. Debra, who had started to feel claustrophobic in her relationship with Anton, eventually realizes she returns Lundy's feelings and sleeps with him. This results in Anton and Debra breaking up and Debra leaving his place after she admitted she slept with Lundy to Anton. Anton visits Deb in the hospital, where she officially ends their relationship for good. He has not been seen since.\n\nYuki Amado\n\nedit\n\nLiza Lapira\n\nYuki Amado is the Internal Affairs officer who was pressuring Debra Morgan to give her information on Joey Quinn, promising to help her become a detective in return. Debra does not agree to help, and becomes extremely irritated with Yuki's persistence. Yuki, pressured to move forward in her case on Quinn starts giving Debra orders as if she had agreed to help the case. After being confronted by Debra that Quinn told her that it was just a personal grudge of hers, she states that he is lying and is investigating him because of his alleged tendency to cut corners.\n\nSyl Prado\n\nedit\n\nValerie Cruz\n\nSylvia \"Syl\" Prado is Miguel Prado's wife. She is a real-estate agent and becomes close friends with Rita, even hiring her as her assistant. Later, she confides in Rita that she suspects her husband is having an affair. After a miscommunication with Dexter, Rita believes that Prado is cheating on his wife with LaGuerta, which she later tells Syl when trying on bridal outfits. Due to bad timing, she sees her husband leaving LaGuerta's house and she believes he has been cheating on her all this time and forces him out of her house. Syl was devastated when Miguel was killed, apparently by The Skinner (really Dexter).\n\nEllen Wolf\n\nedit\n\nAnne Ramsay\n\nDefense Attorney Ellen Wolf is Miguel Prado's main professional rival. Ellen believes Miguel, whom she derides as a \"fascistic prosecutor,\" bends the rules to put innocent people in prison while Miguel believes Ellen helps guilty people get off. Miguel believes that people like Ellen are the root of the problem that Dexter tries to solve through killing. However, his opinion of her seems to change favorably when Wolf betrays her client, a murderer named Albert Chung. Later, after participating in one of Dexter's murders, Miguel realizes he's capable of cold-blooded killings himself, comes to Wolf's house alone and murders her. Wolf was a close friend of Lt. LaGuerta, who is devastated upon Wolf's death. LaGuerta sought to solve the crime, and in the end discovered Miguel's actions. She initially vowed to tear what life he left behind apart (Miguel had recently been killed by Dexter, although everyone thought it was the Skinner). However, Dexter makes her understand she would be hurting Prado's family, the local community who supported and admired him and the city at large, and there was no guarantee she would find anything. In the end, LaGuerta accepted Dexter's advice and closed the case, keeping Prado's actions a secret and saying goodbye to her friend.\n\nGeorge King\n\nedit\n\nJesse Borrego\n\nGeorge King aka George Washington King, an alias for Jorge Orozco, was the main antagonist of Season 3 along with Miguel Prado. Conscripted into the Nicaraguan army, he rose to the rank of captain in the Resistencia Nicaragüense, heading an interrogation unit. Orozco tortured and killed people for a living, earning the nickname \"The Blade\". His time in the army left him with a deep need for respect. Orozco left the army and moved to Miami, founding and becoming boss of his own tree-trimming company.\n\nWhen Freebo, a petty criminal, disappeared (killed by Dexter) while in debt to Orozco, Orozco resolved to hunt him down and make him pay for his affront, though Dexter saw this as a transparent excuse for his own sociopathic needs. As Debra Morgan met with Freebo's old associates in an attempt to find him, Orozco trailed her, covertly watching their homes under the cover of trimming their trees, and eventually kidnapped each of them, tortured them for information and killed them, taking a patch of skin from each victim, for which he was dubbed \"the Skinner\".\n\nUpon questioning, Orozco deflected attention to one of his violent employees; but when the employee learned Orozco was involved, he had a near-panic attack, causing the police to focus on Orozco. The police then set up Anton Briggs, a former confidential informant, as bait by making him seem to know where Freebo was. Orozco kidnapped and tortured Briggs, but Debra and Joey Quinn interrupted, saving Briggs's life and forcing Orozco to flee.\n\nThe man-hunt continued, escalating when Dexter framed Orozco for ADA Miguel Prado's death (in reality by his own hands), but Dexter was ultimately captured and abducted by Orozco, having been told by Prado that only Dexter knew where Freebo was. Orozco intended to torture and skin Dexter for information, but instead Dexter effectively stripped him of his control (by revealing the truth that Freebo was long dead), then broke free. In a brutal fist-fight, Dexter broke Orozco's neck, killing him. The police arrived, having tracked down Orozco's hideout, but Dexter avoided detection by dropping Orozco's body in front of one of the speeding squad cars, making it look as if the collision caused the death. Getting hit by the car skinned his face; Debra joked that \"what goes around comes around\".\n\nBarbara Gianna\n\nedit\n\nKristin Dattilo\n\nBarbara Gianna, a detective with Miami Metro Police Department's Vice Division meets Sgt. Batista in season 3 and becomes his girlfriend. According to Vince Masuka, Gianna's a \"Wikipedia of perv\". She is attacked and beaten by a would-be \"john\", and Sgt. Batista has Dexter run her keys for blood and DNA. She meets him when she is working undercover as a hooker and he is a would-be client, and she is initially standoffish when, after she declines to arrest him, he later attempts to woo her. In the beginning of Season 4, it is revealed that they have broken up. Angel credits this to their \"wanting different things\".\n\nAdditional characters, introduced in season 4\n\nedit\n\nArthur Mitchell\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Arthur Mitchell (Dexter)\n\nJohn Lithgow\n\nArthur Mitchell is the main antagonist of the fourth season. He is an unassuming suburbanite man who has been living a double life as one of America's most prolific and deadly serial killers, dubbed the Trinity Killer by FBI agent Frank Lundy.\n\nChristine Hill\n\nedit\n\nCourtney Ford\n\nChristine Hill was a Miami Tribune reporter who meets Joey Quinn at the scene of Lisa Bell's murder. She starts a relationship with Quinn, often seducing classified police information out of him, including the Vacation Shootings, and the return of Frank Lundy to Miami. The police use her to help catch the Vacation Murderers. It turns out that Christine is the daughter of Arthur Mitchell/Trinity, and is also the shooter of Frank Lundy and Debra. She also reveals that she saw Arthur commit one of his first murders, and she shot Lundy to prevent Arthur's arrest. The police find out the biological connection and arrest her. She did not confess, however, until Mitchell angrily tells her that he wishes she had never been born. Devastated, Hill calls Debra to her apartment and confesses to killing Lundy, begging for forgiveness, but an enraged Debra sobs at the news and then snarls that she will never forgive Hill and that Hill will rot in jail for the rest of her unloved, unwanted life. A completely broken Hill then pulls out a gun as Debra calls in officers to arrest her, and as Debra turns around, Hill sticks the gun into her mouth and shoots herself.\n\nElliot Larson\n\nedit\n\nRick Peters\n\nElliot becomes the neighbor of Dexter and Rita, after they move next door following their wedding. Recently having separated from his wife, Kate (portrayed by Marisa Petroro), he's now a single father, and becomes friends with the Morgans, much to Dexter's annoyance. Elliot eventually develops a romantic interest in Rita. During Thanksgiving he shares a kiss with her, as witnessed by Masuka. When Dexter eventually finds out, he responds with knocking Elliot down.\n\nAfter Rita's death, he is interviewed as a potential witness and suspect, but is cleared. When Dexter is packing up his house, Elliot apologizes to him for kissing Rita. Later, he meets Lumen Pierce while she is staying at Dexter and Rita's now-unoccupied house.\n\nSally Mitchell\n\nedit\n\nJulia Campbell\n\nSally Mitchell is married to Arthur Mitchell and is the mother of Jonah and Rebecca Mitchell. In \"Dirty Harry\" and \"If I Had a Hammer\" it appears she has an ideal family. The entire family presents as loving, a pillar of the community, church-goers, and involved in a project to build homes for the homeless. However, this is revealed in \"Hungry Man\" to be a facade; Arthur is very controlling and abusive. His wife, fearing her husband, perpetually puts on a cheery façade and is willing to let her daughter continue a perceived affair with Dexter as long as Arthur remains unaware. She is last seen in tears being taken out of her home by the police when they uncover that Arthur is Trinity.\n\nUnable to accept the reality of her husband being a veteran serial killer, Sally begins blaming her children for the loss of their lives, hoping Arthur returns to \"whisk her away\". The blame shifting impacts Rebecca significantly, leading to her suicide, which in turn leads to Jonah beating his mother to death in retribution. Blood-splatter indicates that the murderer was someone of Trinity's height, making people believe that Trinity had found and killed them when, in reality, Jonah killed his mother standing on the stairs at the same height as his father.\n\nJonah Mitchell\n\nedit\n\nBrando Eaton\n\nJonah Mitchell is the son and oldest child of Arthur and Sally. He is a member of JROTC, plays football and at one time played baseball for his high school, which he quit, angering his father greatly. Though at first they seem to have a great father/son relationship, it is soon revealed that his father is very domineering to him and physically abusive, going as far as to break his fingers for damaging Arthur's car (a white 1968 GT-500 Shelby Mustang convertible with a blue racing stripe). Jonah tells Dexter he always comes up with excuses to explain the injuries given by his father to the school, but due to the number of injuries, is running out of excuses. He later snaps during Thanksgiving dinner and destroys his father's awards as well as smashing Arthur's sister's urn, causing him to nearly kill Jonah by strangulation but he is saved by Dexter. When Dexter is trying to find a child Arthur kidnapped, Jonah goes on Arthur's computer, discovering his father had been looking up vacant houses (although he does not know Arthur's intent for doing so). In the season 4 finale, he is seen being taken out of his home by the police when they uncover that Arthur is Trinity.\n\nIn season 5, he is seen in a store where Quinn approaches him with a composite sketch of Kyle Butler which resembles Dexter. Before Jonah can give him an answer of whether the picture is Kyle Butler/Dexter or not, Quinn is taken into custody by an FBI agent in charge of guarding Jonah while in witness protection.\n\nIn season 6, he reappears in the episode \"Nebraska\" as the sole survivor of his family who has been reportedly murdered by the Trinity Killer. While Dexter suspects that Jonah was the perpetrator, with supporting evidence, Jonah's guilt emerges in a confrontation which shows that he killed his mother for instigating his sister's suicide. No longer truly fitting the Code of Harry, Dexter tells him to forgive himself and returns to Miami.\n\nRebecca Mitchell\n\nedit\n\nVanessa Marano\n\nRebecca Mitchell is the daughter of Arthur and Sally. Though she is a 15-year-old teenager, her bedroom resembles that of a young child. After running away once, Arthur now has locks on the outside of the door and on the windows. Arthur often calls her \"Vera\", the name of his deceased sister. When Dexter asks her about this and tries to console her, she asks him to take her away, saying she would do \"anything\", implying she will give him sexual favors to do so (which Dexter flatly refuses). Both Becca and her mother believe he will take Becca up on her offer, however, the latter hopes that Dexter will not allow Arthur to find out. She is last seen in tears being taken out of her home by the police when they uncover that Arthur is Trinity.\n\nA year later, due to the unstable rantings of her mother, Rebecca commits suicide in a way similar to the second victim in her father's cycle of kills. This discovery prompts Dexter to investigate.\n\nAdditional characters, introduced in season 5\n\nedit\n\nLumen Pierce\n\nedit\n\nMain article: Lumen Pierce\n\nJulia Stiles\n\nLumen Pierce is first seen after witnessing Dexter kill Boyd Fowler, a serial killer who had been keeping her captive. Despite Lumen being a witness to the murder and a clear threat to Dexter, due to her not fitting Dexter's code by being innocent, he is morally obligated to keep her alive and locks her up in a secluded area to give himself time to decide what to do with her. At first, Lumen is petrified of Dexter, believing that he will kill her for being a witness to his crime. Despite Dexter's constant assurances that he will not kill her, Lumen refuses to trust him. After an escape attempt, she is once again captured by Dexter.
