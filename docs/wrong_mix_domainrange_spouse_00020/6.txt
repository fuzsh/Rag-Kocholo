Michael Galeotti and Bethany Joy Lenzi’s Divorce

After six years of marriage, Gelotti’s alcoholism escalated to a serious problem, resulting in many arrests and aggressive conduct. Lenzi reportedly left him because of his drunkenness and the violence it brought about. Lenzi, who announced their split on her blog, said she was sorry about the choice to break their marriage, but they would still be friends and co-parent their daughter. The ex-wife of Galeotti was given full custody by the court.

Michael Galeotti: A Tragic End for a Talented Musician

Before passing away suddenly at the age of 31, Michael Galeotti, a gifted musician and former member of the band Aneshnation, had some health problems. He suffered from high blood pressure, diverticulitis, and excessive cholesterol, which forced him into the hospital just one week before his passing. Despite being released, he was discovered dead not long after, most likely taking his own life due to his chronic alcoholism.
