Who is Bethany Joy Lenz’s ex-husband?

Who is Bethany Joy Lenz’s ex-husband? Bethany Joy Lenz is currently single, but she was formerly married to musician Michael Galeotti, who was in the band Enation. Joy Lenz and Galeotti tied the knot in 2005 and were married for about seven years. They welcomed one child, their daughter Maria Rose, in 2011.

Joy Lenz announced that the pair were divorcing in 2012 while the last season of One Tree Hill was airing on The CW. At the time, she shared the news on her blog and said she planned to return to her maiden name, Lenz.

“As most of you know, as much as I love to share with you the magic of ordinary days, I am also very private about my personal life. In fact, the only reason I’m saying anything about this at all is because you’ll all be wondering soon why everyone is calling me ‘Bethany Joy Lenz’ again,” she wrote, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “I’m sorry to say that Michael and I have decided to divorce.”

She continued, “We remain friendly and dedicated to raising our beautiful girl in love and we appreciate your prayers and support during this difficult time. I feel immensely humbled and grateful that God works all things for the good of those who love Him.”

Joy Lenz’s daughter Maria is now 13 years old. This past Valentine’s Day, she shared a sweet photo with Maria on Instagram. “Forever Valentine 💌,” she captioned the picture. The mother-daughter duo were also photographed in 2022 walking the red carpet at the GRAMMY Awards Viewing Party.
