        "text": "AlpAdventures France\n\nSandwiched between the biking parks of les Portes du Soleil and the Alpine capital of the world, Chamonix Mont Blanc, lies Samoëns. Here in France's Haute Savoie, you'll find AlpAdventures' basecamp. From this outdoor paradise, Arno and Jessica have been organizing unforgettable mountain adventures for 15 years.\n\nSamoëns was an EWS destination a few years ago. Below the gondola you will find the most challenging forest descents with a vertical drop of 1400m. A short distance away, there are many singletracks and bike parks, ready to be ripped by you! Whether you want to put together your own adventure trip or participate in one of the planned trips, at AlpAdventures you have come to the right place for an unforgettable mountain adventure.\n\nA French-qualified mountain guide, Arno will take you on the road. Bike parks are fun to warm up and assess the riders' level, but the real challenge (according to Arno) is in the singletracks. The hidden gems that only the locals know about. A kilometre-long flowy trail, that challenging rocky descent full of switchbacks or that path with that insane view of Mont Blanc!\n\nIf you set off with AlpAdventures, then you are going for adventure. This could be during a week of trail shredding from a fixed chalet in Samoëns. For a week, you'll be nicely looked after by AlpAdventures chef Jessica and one night you'll sleep on the trails in a mountain hut. Or how about the Transseventyfour; a 6-day hut2hut bike adventure over the best trails in Haute Savoie. If you can't choose, go for the combination of both on the Best of the Haute Savoie. This coming summer season, the program also includes a point-to-point trip in mountain bike paradise le Queyras and you can spend a week riding fantastic trails (and eating pasta and gelati) in Italy's Aosta.\n\nAlpAdventures offers a number of open trips each season on which you can participate individually, but the specialization is in tailoring. How does that work? Very easily! Gather a group of like-minded biking friends, pick a date and contact AlpAdventures for a tailor-made and unforgettable biking adventure!\n\nTranslated by www.DeepL.com/Translator (free version)"
