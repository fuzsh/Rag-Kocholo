        "text": "Photo story of trail\n\n1. Riding up gondola to Marbachegg\n\nHere is the Marbachegg gondola stations. Buy tickets here.\n\nFour people fit in each gondola car. It’s a short ride to the top.\n\nThe gondola station at the top.\n\nRestaurant at the top of the gondola. We had a quick coffee/cocoa & croissant before heading on the trail.\n\nHere’s what the gondola station looks like after you are on the hike. It’s at the top of the lift.\n\n2. Riding the Mountain go-carts\n\nRight at the gondola you’ll find the go-carts. We paid here in cash for one ride each.\n\nHere is the wooden track you ride down.\n\nThe track gets quite steep at times so stay in control.\n\nAt the bottom of the track, you get off your cart. The attendant sets the cart in the correct position then you get on the cart again. The attendant hooks the tow bar to your cart and you hold the handlebars as you ride to the top.\n\n3. Starting the trail\n\nNear the carts and gondola station, you’ll see this trail sign. Follow signs to Imbrig and Kemmeriboden Bad. You are also on the green 65 Grenzpfad Napfbergpfad.\n\nThe trail starts on this “road”.\n\nThe path descends these stairs to the first picnic area near that little pond.\n\nNow down a big grassy hill.\n\nLooking back up to Marbachegg.\n\nJoin the road and turn left following the road.\n\nAt this farm, the trail branches left off the road for a bit. We missed this turn off and continued on the road. Don’t worry if you miss it too because the trail joins back with the road after a few minutes.\n\nLovely views down the valley.\n\nPassing by adorable farm houses.\n\nThe road is leading close to those peaks, the Schrattenfluh range.\n\nNow very close to the peaks. Take lots of pics here.\n\nYou’ll see this sign for Alp Imbrig. It’s a five min detour uphill to the alpine dairy, which has a cafe selling hot and cold food. There’s a menu posted on the sign to help you decide.\n\nTo continue hiking, keep following the road as it curves to your right.\n\nYou’ll pass another picnic area in a shady spot. It has a nice view the other direction\n\nAt this fork, go right following signs to Kemmeriboden Bad.\n\nAfter this farm, you leave the road and follow a footpath for the rest of the way down the mountain.\n\nTraversing and slowly making your way down.\n\nYou will pass through a few farms on the way.\n\nAt this section, you’ll see a Danger sign warning of you possible falling rocks over a short section. Just walk quickly through and don’t stop or linger in this section.\n\nThere are some steep slopes to the side but the trail is wide and well built.\n\nDespite the number of meters you have to descend, the walk down was milder than expected.\n\nAlmost down with the peaks getting farther away.\n\nEmerging from the forest at this parking near the Kemmeriboden bus stop.\n\nIf you already have a ticket, just get on the bus. If you don’t have a ticket, you can buy one with coins from the driver. It’s about a 20 mins drive back to the gondola station. If you came here by public transportation, you can stay on this bus to the Escholzmatt, Bahnhof train station. Although the trail was empty, the bus was very crowded on the Sunday afternoon we went, presumably people doing other trails in the area.\n\nFAQ\n\nCan you take dogs on this trail?\n\nYes, dogs are welcome on this trail and ride free on the gondola. You are expected to keep dogs on the leash, particularly around cattle and other hikers. Please clean up after your dogs waste.\n\nWhat to wear\n\nThis is a mountain hike, so weather and temperatures can change quickly. Dress appropriate to the weather forecast, bringing layers like a fleece and windbreaker/rain jacket as needed. Most of the trail is quite wide and away from tall grass. So for hot days, it’s ok to wear shorts.\n\nAlthough much of the trail is on a road, the second half is on a dirt footpath with uneven terrain. So I suggest hiking shoes with good tread. I found hiking sticks helpful on the steep downhill sections on the last few km of the hike.\n\nFor sunny days, make sure to bring sunscreen, sun hat, and sunglasses. Bring at least 1 L of water per person. There are no fountains but you can buy drinks at the mountain restaurants.\n\nWhat to bring\n\nAlthough you can buy refreshments at the restaurants along the way, I suggest bringing minimum 1 L of water per person and snacks."
