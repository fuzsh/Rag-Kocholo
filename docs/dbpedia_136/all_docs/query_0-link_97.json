        "text": "Keyword\n\nGeomorphological heritage\n\nLandscapes\n\nSwitzerland\n\nSwitzerland is known not only for its typical products (chocolate, cheese, watches) and services (banking), but also for its landscapes. The latter were at the origin of tourism in Europe in the eighteenth century and landscapes are still among the main tourist attractions in Switzerland today. Their diversity is largely due to the influence of the agricultural development, which has given rise to a multitude of rural sceneries, including typical alternating grasslands, alpine pastures, forests and cultivated fields. Today, however, these rural landscapes are increasingly under pressure from urbanisation, especially on the Swiss Plateau .\n\nThe variety of Swiss landscapes is also due to the combination of varied structural and climatic contexts and a rich geological heritage. The aim of this book is to present and discuss the influence of the different structural contexts and current and former climates on landforms, and the importance of the landforms in structuring the landscapes of Switzerland.\n\nThe book has three main sections. The first section concerns the physical context and details the variety of Swiss geomorphological landscapes. It includes four texts: The first, by O. Adrian Pfiffner, presents the main features of Swiss geology. The second, by Jean-Michel Fallot, does the same for climate. The following text by Christian Schlüchter et al. gives an overview of the evolution of landscapes during the Quaternary. Finally, Emmanuel Reynard et al. provide an overview of the main geomorphological landscapes in Switzerland.\n\nSection two presents 23 characteristic Swiss reliefs and landscapes. It has three subsections. The first one proposes eight examples of structural landscapes , i.e. cases in which structural conditions have strongly influenced morphology. Andrea Moscariello interprets the geomorphological history of the Geneva basin , which has depended to a great extent on structural conditions and has been shaped by repeated passage of glaciers during the Quaternary. Emmanuel Reynard and Philippe Schoeneich portray a typical Jura landscape, the Joux Valley and its surroundings. Emmanuel Reynard and Emmanuel Estoppey offer a geomorphological analysis of the structural landscape (in the Molasse) of the Lavaux World Heritage vineyard. Using the example of the Diablerets Massif , Philippe Schoeneich and Emmanuel Reynard then present the landscapes of the calcareous massifs of the western “Hautes Alpes Calcaires”. O. Adrian Pfiffner does the same for the landscapes of central Switzerland, around Lake Lucerne , following Philipp Häuselmann’s analysis of the surface and underground landscapes of the Siebenhengste-Hohgant-Schrattenfluh karst system . The following text by Thomas Buckingham and O. Adrian Pfiffner deal with structural landscapes of eastern Switzerland, in the Sardona region, another Swiss World Heritage site. The subsection ends with a geomorphological analysis of one of the most famous peaks in the Alps: the Matterhorn , by Michel Marthaler and Henri Rougier.\n\nThe second subsection provides nine examples of glacial, periglacial and high mountain landscapes. Switzerland is rich in glaciers. Two examples of regions where glacial processes are still very active were chosen, both of which are part of the Swiss Alps Jungfrau-Aletsch World Heritage site: the Great Aletsch Glacier (text by Hans Holzhauser) and the glaciers on the northern slope of the Bernese Alps in the Jungfrau region (text by Heinz Zumbühl et al.). The next three examples illustrate the rapid evolution of high mountain valleys as a result of global warming, while underlining the importance of the Quaternary heritage: the rockglaciers of the Engadine (text by Isabelle Gärtner-Roer and Martin Hoelzle), the landscapes of the Swiss National Park (text by Christian Schlüchter et al.) and glacial and periglacial landscapes typical of the valleys in the western Alps, such as those of the Hérens Valley (text by Christophe Lambiel). The following two examples deal with Quaternary legacies of two major glaciers on the Swiss Plateau : the Rhone glacier (text by Susan Ivy-Ochs et al.) and the Rhine glacier (text by Oskar Keller). Beat Keller provides a detailed analysis of landscape evolution, highlighting the importance of the Reuss glacier in shaping the lake and the city of Lucerne. Finally, Cristian Scapozza and Christian Ambrosi discuss the importance of glacial, periglacial and fluvial processes in shaping the valleys located in the Southern Alps, emphasising their particularities by comparing them with valleys in the Northern Alps.\n\nThe third subsection presents six examples of river landscapes and landscapes related to gravity-driven processes. Peter Heitzmann presents the geomorphological context of the biggest waterfall in Switzerland: the Rhine Falls . Nico Bätz et al. analyse the recent evolution of one of the last braided rivers in Switzerland: the Allondon River in the canton of Geneva. Brian McArdell and Mario Sartori analyse the structural conditions and activity of one of the most active torrential systems in the Alps: the Illgraben . The two following texts concern landslides ; the first one, in Campo Vallemaggia (analysed by Luca Bonzanigo) is active, with the most recent major landslide occurring in the 1940s, while the second one in Flims , in the Rhine Valley (studied by Andreas von Poschinger et al.), is an example of a major landslide due to postglacial readjustment of the relief. Here, hillslope landforms caused by gravity combine with fluvial landforms to create an exceptional landscape. The last text (Marcia Phillips, Robert Kenner) concerns the municipality of Pontresina , in Graubünden, and describes the activity of high mountain processes and the new anthropogenic landscapes resulting from measures against natural hazards , very common in the Swiss Alps.\n\nOf course, these examples do not cover all the geomorphological landscapes of Switzerland. Some readers may regret the fact that among the 322 geosites in Switzerland, important sites do not have a chapter to themselves. This is the result of a selection guided not only by scientific criteria (the aim being to present different landscapes influenced by the main structural and climatic contexts throughout the country), but also by practical criteria, including the availability of experts to write a text.\n\nThe last section (by Emmanuel Reynard et al.) deals with geoheritage management issues.\n\nThis book is a collective work that brings together geomorphologists, geologists and geographers working in different regions of the country. I would like to thank all the colleagues who gave their time to write these summary chapters on their study sites. It may seem easy, but in practice, it is often a time-consuming task searching for research results disseminated in multiple documents, ranging from study reports to scientific articles, student work or geological maps. I would also like to thank Mélanie Clivaz, Research Assistant at the Institute of Geography and Sustainability of the University of Lausanne, who helped produce the figures for some chapters.\n\nThe whole book was subject to a review process to ensure the scientific quality of the chapters. I would like to thank the following people who agreed to review one or more chapters: Christian Ambrosi, Philippe Audra, Luca Bonardi, Jean-François Buonchristiani, Dov Corenblit, Philip Deline, Jean-Luc Epard, Monique Fort, Wilfried Haeberli, Peter Heitzmann, Raimund Hipp, Christophe Lambiel, Robin Marchant, Jürg Meyer, O. Adrian Pfiffner, Marcia Phillips, Martine Rebetez, Cristian Scapozza, Philippe Schoeneich, Roberto Seppi and Ronald T. Van Balen.\n\nI also express my warm appreciation to Piotr Migoń, scientific editor of the series “World Geomorphological Landscapes”. His careful proofreading of all the chapters and his rich experience in publishing other books in the series made it possible to clarify certain formulations and uses that may be understandable to Swiss researchers, but not necessarily for foreign readers, and to improve the formal and scientific quality of the chapters. I am grateful to him to have invited me to join the admirable editorial project he is coordinating.\n\nI would also like to acknowledge the precious support of Springer Nature, particularly Robert K. Doe, Senior Publisher, and Rema Devi Viswanathan, Manjula Saravanan, Banu Dhayalan and Madanagopal Deenadayalan who coordinated the publication process with endless patience and dedication.\n\nWithout claiming to be exhaustive, I hope that reading the general chapters in sections 1 and 3 will help understand the context and reasons for Switzerland’s rich geomorphological diversity, while the chapters in section 2 give some concrete examples chosen among the country’s many geomorphosites and geomorphological landscapes (Fig. 1.1)."
