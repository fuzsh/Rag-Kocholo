        "meta_description": "Hengst is the highest point of Schrattenfluh, a unique ridge of limestone pavements. In the summer and autumn, the geology of this is fascinating. In winter it is covered with snow and provides a wonderful area for ski touring, that is neither difficult nor dangerous. Beware early and late season though, some of the cracks in the pavement are deep, and have not been pointed very well! In good weather there are excellent views of the Eiger and the Bernese Oberland.",

        "text": "From Wolhusen follow the road towards Flühli. Pass through Flühli and continue a few more kilometres to the small hamlet of Hirsegg, where there is a right turn off the main road. Park just past this in a large lay by on the left of the main road.\n\nCross the road from the car park and ski across the field to the road bridge over the river .and go over this. From here it is possible to go either left or right. The left hand route follows the ridge up to Alp Schlund, from where it continues through the forest to emerge at a false summit from where the large cross on the top of Hengst is visible. From here, descend slightly and climb direct to the ridge which is followed to the top. The right hand route follows the track to Bodenhütten, then traverses the slope to reach the ridge which is followed to the top. Neither climb is very steep, and is an ideal tour after fresh snow."
