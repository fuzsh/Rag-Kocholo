        "text": "A guide to the most amazing things to do and places to visit in Lucerne, including the most epic day trips to the Lake Lucerne Region.\n\nLocated on the shore of Lake Lucerne, the city of Lucerne is the gateway to central Switzerland and one of the most popular destinations in the country.\n\nWith plenty of landmarks and historic places to explore, Lucerne also has a lot to offer to those interested in food, adventure, and the outdoors.\n\nBeyond the city attractions, you will find plenty of opportunities to enjoy some of the most beautiful Swiss landscapes. Lucerne is the ideal starting point to explore the Lake Lucerne region and Central Switzerland.\n\nFrom medieval houses covered in frescos and ancient wooden bridges, to day trips to impressive mountains and some of the most breathtaking cable car rides in the world, Lucerne and the Lake Lucerne region are waiting to be discovered.\n\nBut before we go on to the most amazing things to do and places to visit in Lucerne, let’s have a look at a brief overview of the city.\n\nAn overview of Lucerne\n\nHow to get to Lucerne\n\nZurich International Airport is 61 km (38 miles) from Lucerne, which can be reached by train in less than an hour.\n\nThere are flights into Zurich from all over the world with SWISS, which is likely to have the best combinations into Switzerland.\n\nIt’s also worth considering flying with SWISS, as it’s one of the few airlines that are working really hard to become as sustainable as possible.\n\nSWISS has set itself ambitious targets for reducing CO2. They are aiming to halve CO2 emissions by 2030 and achieve neutral emissions by 2050. You can read more about SWISS’ sustainability efforts here.\n\nWhere to stay in Lucerne\n\nHotel des Balances – Historic hotel\n\n> Book Hotel des Balances here\n\nHotel Astoria – Award-winning architecture\n\n> Book Hotel Astoria here\n\nHotel Continental Park – A family-run hotel\n\n> Book Hotel Continental Park here\n\nBoutique Hotel Himmelrich – Impressive views outside the city\n\n> Book Boutique Hotel Himmelrich here\n\nGetting around Lucerne and Lake Lucerne Region\n\nThere are a lot of place where you need a car to get around, with Iceland being one of them. But In Switzerland public transport is fantastic!\n\nIt’s really easy to get around Lucerne and Lake Lucerne Region using the Swiss Travel System of public transport.\n\nEverything is very well connected, by urban bus within Lucerne city, and by trains, boats, and cable cars around the region. And of course, it’s the most sustainable way to explore.\n\nI would recommend purchasing the Swiss Travel Pass, which gives you unlimited travel by bus, train, and boat across the whole country.\n\nIt’s so easy to get round with the Swiss Travel Pass that you could easily visit Lucerne as a day trip from Basel by train, for example.\n\nIt’s an all-in-one ticket that can be used for 3, 4, 6, 8 or 15 consecutive days. In addition to giving you unlimited travel on the Swiss Travel Network, it also includes unlimited travel in premium panoramic trains, and cable rides to Mount Rigi, Stoos, and Stanserhorn.\n\nIt also includes free entry to more than 500 museums, and 50% discounts on other mountain excursions.\n\n> Buy your Swiss Travel Pass here\n\nTop things to do and places to visit in Lucerne\n\nExplore Lucerne Old Town\n\nLucerne is known for its medieval architecture, which can be found mostly in the Old Town on the banks of the River Reuss.\n\nExploring the Old Town is one of the top things to do in Lucerne. It’s completely free of traffic, so the best way to do it is by wandering around and getting lost in its narrow alleyways.\n\nAs you walk around, make sure you look up to admire the ancient guild halls covered in frescos. The painted façades and the timber-framed houses will make you feel like you are in a fairy tale town.\n\nSome of the best frescos are in Sternenplatz, Hirschenplatz, Kramgasse, and the façade of Hotel des Balances in Merzgerrainle.\n\nOther highlights are the Old Town Hall (Altes Rathaus), built in the 17th century, and the 14th century clock tower right next to it. Weinmarkt used to be the town’s fish market up until the 16th century, and here you can find one of the prettiest fountains in the city.\n\nKapellplatz is where you can find Lucerne’s oldest church, St Peter’s Chapel, and the colorful Fritschi Fountain decorated with carnival masks. This is where the famous Lucerne Carnival starts every year.\n\nIf, like me, you enjoy learning about the history of a place, I’d recommend doing a walking tour.\n\n> Book a 2-Hour Walking Tour of the Old Town and Chapel Bridge\n\nRELATED READING\n\nFun things to do in Feldkirch, an Austrian fairy-tale town\n\nChapel Bridge (Kappellbrücke) and its Water Tower\n\nChapel Bridge (Kappellbrücke) is considered to be Europe’s oldest covered bridge. Originally part of the city’s fortifications, it was built in the 14th century and it’s one of the top places to visit in Lucerne.\n\nChapel Bridge has a series of 17th century pictorial panels that represent scenes of the history of Lucerne and Switzerland. Sadly, many of the original panels were lost in the fire that destroyed most of the bridge in 1993.\n\nThe bridge was rebuilt and reopened the following year. Fortunately the 14th century Water Tower wasn’t damaged in the fire. This 700-year-old octagonal tower is older than the bridge by about 30 years.\n\nIt has served a number of functions over the centuries. It has been a lookout post, an archive, a treasury, and even a prison. Today you can only visit the Water Tower by taking a private guided tour.\n\nLion monument\n\nNestled in a rocky grotto in a small park, this monument of a dying lion is a powerful memorial and one of the most popular Lucerne attractions.\n\nCarved onto a sandstone wall in 1820, the Lion Monument was designed by Danish artist Bertel Thorvaldsen. It commemorates the death of around 1,000 Swiss guardsmen that lost their lives while protecting the life of King Louis XVI of France during the French Revolution.\n\nIt is a very powerful and poignant sight. As Mark Twain very famously said, “The Lion of Lucerne (is) the most mournful and moving piece of stone in the world.”\n\nVisit the Swiss Transport Museum\n\nThe Swiss Transport Museum (Verkehrshaus) is the most visited museum in Switzerland and one of the top places to visit in Lucerne. With more than 3,000 objects, simulators, multimedia shows, and interactive exhibits, it is the perfect place to spend a day. Especially if traveling as a family.\n\nIt opened in 1959 and it explores the development of transport and mobility on road, rail, water, air, and space travel, in an interactive way.\n\nThere are cars, boats, trains, and aircraft, and you can board many of them. You can easily spend a whole day here.\n\nThe Museum also houses Switzerland’s largest cinema screen, a Planetarium and Swiss Chocolate Adventure.\n\nIf you are only interested in visiting the Swiss Chocolate Adventure part of the museum you can buy a separate ticket.\n\n> Buy a ticket for the Swiss Transport Museum here\n\n>Buy a ticket for the Swiss Chocolate Adventure here\n\nExplore Lake Lucerne on a cruise\n\nLake Lucerne and the surrounding snow-capped mountains offer the ultimate image of Swiss scenery. So exploring the lake by boat is one of the best things to do in Lucerne, even if you only have one day.\n\nYou can take a boat ride in any season, but in summer it’s absolutely stunning.\n\nThe boats leave from the quay in the city center, by the Lucerne Culture and Convention Centre, and there are several options. Here are two highly recommended options:\n\n> Lake Lucerne 1-hour cruise on panoramic yacht\n\n> Lake Lucerne 1st class cruise with gourmet lunch\n\nRELATED READING\n\nSummer in Southern Austria – 15+ Epic Things To Do In Carinthia In Summer\n\nTry the local food in Lucerne\n\nSwiss food has heavy influences from German, French and Italian cuisines. Cheese and potatoes tend to be popular ingredients in a lot of the local food you will find in Lucerne.\n\nThe most popular Swiss food to try in Lucerne is fondue. Fondue is Swiss melted cheese served in a ceramic pot called ‘caquelon’. Bread cubes are picked up on the fork and swiveled in the melted cheese.\n\nAnother dish to try is Älplermagronen (literally translated as alpine macaroni), similar to macaroni cheese, and served with stewed apple on the side. It’s absolutely delicious and proper comfort food.\n\nMake sure you also try the rosti, a fritter of grated potato fried in hot butter. It is often served for breakfast.\n\nAnd of course, chocolate! You must not forget to indulge in milk chocolate in the birth country of this delicious treat.\n\nAttend a concert in KKL Luzerne (Culture and Convention Centre)\n\nThe KKL Luzerne (Culture and Convention Centre) has been recognized as one of the world’s great performance centers for both its architecture and its high-profile acoustics. This cultural complex attracts music fans from all over the world.\n\nDesigned by architect Jean Nouvel, it opened in 1998. The complex has three main areas, the concert hall, a conference wing, and a multi-purpose hall.\n\nLocated on the edge of Lake Lucerne, it has spectacular views of the lake and the surrounding mountains from the rooftop.\n\nEnjoy a swim and sundowner at Lido Beach House\n\nStrandbad Lido is considered to be the most beautiful beach in Switzerland. Here you can go for a swim or just enjoy the beautiful scenery with Lucerne in the background.\n\nGo before the sun goes down and enjoy a sunset drink at Lido Beach House.\n\nTo get there, you can go by bus from Lucerne train station and get off at Verkehrshaus (Swiss Transport Museum) using your Swiss Travel Pass, or you can get a boat to Verkehrshaus Lido.\n\nTop things places to visit around Lucerne\n\nMount Pilatus\n\nAt 2,132m high, Mount Pilatus is an impressive mountain that offers magnificent panoramic views of the Lake Lucerne Region. Visiting its peak is one of the most popular things to do around Lucerne.\n\nThere are a few ways to get to the top of Mount Pilatus, but the most popular way to do it is the Golden Round Trip from Lucerne, which combines four modes of transport – a bus ride, a cable car, a cogwheel train (the world’s steepest), and a boat ride.\n\n> Book your Golden Round Trip to Mount Pilatus from Lucerne here\n\nMount Rigi\n\nMount Rigi, also known as the Queen of the Mountains, sits at 1,798 meters above sea level. If you are looking for places to visit near Lucerne, a day trip to Mount Rigi is a must.\n\nIt is very easy to reach from Lucerne. To reach the top you will ride the oldest mountain railway in Europe, running since 1871. This cog railroad marked the beginning of tourism in Switzerland as we know it.\n\nFrom the top you can enjoy 360 degree panoramic views of the lakes and mountains, and an impressive variety of alpine flora.\n\n> Buy your Mount Rigi Cogwheel Train Ticket here\n\nIf you have a Swiss Travel Pass, the Mount Rigi Cogwheel is already included, so you don’t need to purchase an additional ticket.\n\nRide the CabriO Stanserhorn cable car\n\nRepeatedly listed as one of the top cable car rides in the world, the CabriO Stanserhorn offers spectacular views from an open top cable car. The ride starts in the town of Stans, with a journey back in time on a 1893 funicular railway.\n\nHalf way up, you then change to the exhilarating CabriO cableway, where you can go up to the top deck to enjoy the incredible views as it takes you up to the summit of Mount Stanserhorn. It’s one of the most impressive things to do near Lucerne.\n\nAt the top you will find a revolving restaurant with magnificent views and delicious food.\n\n> Buy your Skip the Line: CabriO Mt Stanserhorn Railway Ticket here\n\nCycle the 1291 route on an e-bike\n\nConsidered to be the best e-bike tour in Switzerland, the 1291 route is named after the year in which Switzerland was founded.\n\nThe route starts in the center of Lucerne and it takes you through the heart of Switzerland for 385 km. But don’t worry, you can do only one section by hiring an e-bike for the day.\n\nI did a section that started in Giswil, went through part of UNESCO Biosphere Entlebuch and ended in Flühli, where I stopped for a delicious lunch in Tschudi Hui.\n\nThis route takes you through a lot of historic places and the landscape is truly breathtaking.\n\nHike The Schrattenfluh and go underground into a karst cave\n\nThe Schrattenfluh is a wild and rugged rocky spot with great alpine views near the town of Sörenberg. Its highest peak is 2,092m above sea level.\n\nThe bizarre rock formations found here are the result of thousands of years of erosion processes. It’s a very popular spot for hikers, and you can hike it independently or combined with a visit to a karstic cave nearby.\n\nHowever, you may need special equipment if you are looking to hike it in winter. Here are some useful tips for winter hiking to help you prepare.\n\nBack in the 70s, while looking for a place to store cow manure, a farmer discovered a karstic cave under his land.
