        "text": "The UNESCO Biosphere Entlebuch, located at the foot of the Swiss Alps, covers the extensive 395 km² valley of the Little Emme River between Bern and Lucerne in the canton of Lucerne, Switzerland. Also known as UNESCO Biosphäre Entlebuch.\n\nSince 2001, after the Swiss National Park, it became the second UNESCO biosphere reserve in the country, but the first to meet the UNESCO Seville criteria of 1995.\n\nThe region is characterized by having the most extensive and numerous moor landscapes in Switzerland, as well as a rich variety of nationally and internationally relevant plants and animals, making it deserving of being the first biosphere reserve in Switzerland.\n\nWithin its 400 square kilometers, it unfolds a mystical environment that invites peace, inspiration, and rest, with its pristine moor landscapes, charming alpine meadows, and the mighty Schrattenfluh. Unique experiences in contact with nature can be had here.\n\nIn addition to being a refuge for calm and rest amidst untouched nature, Entlebuch offers a wide range of recreational activities. From energy trails or storytelling paths, Kneipp-style health facilities, to the Mooraculum children’s park, as well as various hiking and cycling routes or guided tours, the variety of options is vast.\n\nTraditional cultural activities such as charcoal making in Romoos or the descent from the Entlebuch Alps are also part of the area’s cultural attractions.\n\nHistory of the Entlebuch Biosphere (UBE)\n\nThe history of the Entlebuch biosphere reserve in Switzerland is as fascinating as its landscape. Since its designation in 2001, it has stood out as the second UNESCO biosphere reserve in the country, after the Swiss National Park, but the first to meet the UNESCO Seville criteria of 1995. Remarkably, Entlebuch became the world’s first biosphere reserve established through a referendum, reflecting strong participation and cooperation from the local community.\n\nFurthermore, since 2008, the reserve has been recognized as a regional natural park of national importance according to Swiss park regulations. Theo Schnider, one of the co-founders of the reserve, led the Biosphere until 2022 and was succeeded by the former director of the Goldau Nature and Animal Park.\n\nWithin the reserve is the Brienzer Rothorn, the highest and most prominent peak at 2,348 meters high and 338 meters prominence. This peak is just one of the 96 named peaks in the reserve, constituting a significant attraction for visitors and climbers.\n\nHuman history in the region dates back thousands of years. The first known human settlement in the area dates from the Neolithic period, and by 300 BC, a fortified settlement had been established near present-day Bern. During the Roman occupation, this place was transformed into a vicus and positioned strategically along Roman trade routes, though it was abandoned after the fall of the Roman Empire.\n\nDuring the High Middle Ages, the region saw a renaissance of settlements, including the construction of a castle in Burgundy. Bern, founded in the 12th century and joining the Swiss Confederation in 1353, expanded significantly over the centuries.\n\nA great fire in the 14th century devastated many early settlements, leading to reconstruction with sandstone, which is now a distinctive feature of Bern’s old town. Today, Bern is the fourth largest city in Switzerland and acts as the de facto capital of the country.\n\nThe small villages dotting the Entlebuch reserve, many of which have only a few thousand inhabitants, underscore the community’s commitment to preserving the region’s unique natural landscapes, culminating in the creation of the UNESCO biosphere reserve in 2001 to preserve and protect its valuable moors.\n\nRecommended Excursions and Activities\n\nWhat to See and Do in the Entlebuch Biosphere of Switzerland\n\nIn the Entlebuch Biosphere of Switzerland, you can enjoy natural landscapes perfect for hiking, cycling, and wildlife observation. It’s also possible to climb peaks, explore mountains, and, of course, experience the local culture in nearby towns, along with curious visits to traditional cheese dairies or participating in outdoor activities.\n\nDeer Safari in Switzerland\n\nIn Switzerland, you can start your day with an exciting excursion to observe deer in their natural habitat. Guided by ranger Daniel Schmid and his dog, participants venture into the forest until they reach open areas where deer sightings are more likely.

It is notable for hosting the Kapellbrücke, the oldest covered wooden bridge in Europe. Situated on the shores of Lake Lucerne, the city is a central hub for access to the rest of the country due to its central location. From the top of Mount Pilatus, accessible by a short gondola ride, you can enjoy spectacular views of the lake, the city, and the surrounding alpine peaks.\n\nBern\n\nWest of the reserve is Bern, the de facto capital of Switzerland and its fourth-largest city with a population of 135,000. Its exceptionally well-preserved old town is recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The city is also a major cultural center, home to the Kunstmuseum (Museum of Art), Bern’s Rose Garden, and the Cathedral of St. Vincent, among other sites of interest. Additionally, its central position facilitates access to other regions of the country.\n\nGeography of the Entlebuch Biosphere\n\nThe UNESCO Biosphere Entlebuch is strategically located in the heart of Switzerland, between the cities of Bern and Lucerne, serving as an impressive gateway to the Swiss Alps. This natural park extends over 397 square kilometers in the canton of Lucerne, offering direct access to the alpine foothills and surrounding landscapes.\n\nTo the south of the biosphere begin the Bernese Alps. Although the towering peaks of this mountain range do not dominate the Entlebuch landscape, the region does not lack spectacular views. Here, the rugged karst formations and rock walls, such as those of Schratteflue, add a dramatic character to the area, standing out against the gentle green valleys around them.\n\nThe moors, covering more than a quarter of the biosphere, are essential for the region’s biodiversity. These ecosystems, along with winding streams and lush alpine pastures interspersed with forests, create a mosaic of habitats that support a rich variety of flora and fauna. The presence of these moors is one of the key reasons for the designation of Entlebuch as a biosphere reserve.\n\nIn addition to its rich biodiversity, the Entlebuch Biosphere is located in a position that facilitates access to other parks and nature reserves in Switzerland. To the west are the Gantrisch Nature Park and the Gruyère Pays-d’Enhaut Regional Nature Park. To the southwest is the Diemtigtal Nature Park, while to the northwest are the Chasseral, Doubs, and Thal Nature Parks. This proximity to other nature parks expands the opportunities for ecotourism and exploration of Switzerland’s natural landscapes, making Entlebuch a central hub for nature and outdoor enthusiasts.\n\nGeology of Entlebuch\n\nThe geology of the UNESCO Entlebuch Biosphere reveals a fascinating journey through time, marked by crucial events that have shaped the current landscape of this region at the boundary between the Swiss Plateau and the Alps, specifically in the Swiss Prealps.\n\nThe Swiss Plateau, which currently covers about 30% of the country’s territory, began to form around 60 million years ago. This vast expanse is notably flat compared to the mountainous regions that surround it, providing a distinctive contrast with the more abrupt elevations of the Alps.\n\nThe Alps, on the other hand, have an older formation history, dating back approximately 65 million years during the Alpine orogeny. This tectonic event not only gave rise to the Alps but also to other significant mountain ranges in Europe, South Asia, and North Africa, including the Pyrenees, the Himalayas, the Karakoram, the Caucasus, the Atlas, the Carpathians, and the Hindu Kush. This tectonic activity involved the collision of continental plates, pushing seabed material upwards, thus forming the mountains.\n\nOver millions of years, mineral sediments were deposited on the sea floor. With the retreat of the seas about 15 million years ago, these sediments were compacted and transformed into sedimentary rocks such as sandstones, dolomites, and limestones, which characterize many areas of the Prealps and the Alps today.\n\nThe last major glaciation also left its mark on the Entlebuch region, playing a crucial role in shaping the alpine landscape. The glaciers, advancing and retreating, transported enormous rocks and sculpted the terrain, creating U-shaped valleys and leaving behind steep rock walls typical of alpine landscapes.\n\nWithin the Entlebuch Biosphere, some of the most significant peaks include Brienzer Rothorn, Schratteflue, Schongütsch, Tannhorn, Hengst, and Briefehörnli. These peaks are not only geologically important but also offer spectacular landscapes that attract geologists and outdoor enthusiasts alike. The geological diversity of Entlebuch underscores its importance as a place of study and conservation and contributes to its natural richness and biodiversity.\n\nBiodiversity in the UNESCO Entlebuch Biosphere\n\nThe UNESCO Entlebuch Biosphere, with its rich diversity of ecosystems, is a clear example of how human communities and biodiversity can coexist sustainably. The region, home to about 17,000 people, effectively manages the interaction between environmental conservation and the responsible use of its natural resources, ensuring the protection of its natural heritage while supporting the needs of its inhabitants.\n\nThe fauna of Entlebuch is varied and fascinating. Among the most notable mammals are weasels, known for their agility and hunting skills, and beavers, which are master dam builders and play a crucial role in the creation and maintenance of aquatic ecosystems. Chamois, with their impressive ability to climb steep terrain, are also common residents of the region, especially in mountainous areas. Additionally, the reserve and surrounding areas, such as the Gantrisch Nature Park, are habitats for more elusive species like horseshoe bats and alpine hares, which are adapted to alpine conditions.\n\nAs for the flora, Entlebuch is equally diverse. The wetlands and moor areas are dominated by plants like rushes and buckthorn shrubs, while the region’s forests are mainly composed of broadleaf species, including European beeches and white firs. These forests provide a crucial habitat for numerous species of fauna and flora and play an important role in maintaining the region’s ecological balance.\n\nThe karst landscapes of Entlebuch, with their unique geological features, host a rich variety of alpine grasses and wildflowers that bloom profusely during the summer months. These formations are not only essential for the conservation of plant biodiversity but also provide stunning visual spectacles that attract naturalists and tourists.\n\nThus, the Entlebuch Biosphere proves to be a model of how protected areas can function as zones of sustainable coexistence, where rich biodiversity is preserved while maintaining the social and economic fabric of local communities. This interaction between man and nature in Entlebuch is a testament to the possibilities of conservation in the 21st century.\n\nHow to Get There and Move Around in the UNESCO Entlebuch Biosphere\n\nEntlebuch is part of the Lucerne-Lake region, being accessible by public transport from the city of Lucerne.\n\nPublic Transport and Car Sharing\n\nThe Entlebuch Biosphere has half-hourly rail connections with the national train network. PostBus services synchronize with train arrival times to ensure a seamless journey. Additionally, the luggage service throughout Switzerland makes train travel even more convenient, with door-to-door or station-to-station options.\n\nDuring the warmer months, arriving via Brienzer Rothorn is a recommended option. A steam train from the village of Brienz in the Bernese Oberland transports visitors to the highest peak in Lucerne, at 2,350 meters above sea level. From there, you can enjoy panoramic views before descending by cable car to Sörenberg, the tourist center of the UNESCO Biosphere.\n\nCar/Motorcycle\n\nThe Entlebuch Biosphere has five main access points.
