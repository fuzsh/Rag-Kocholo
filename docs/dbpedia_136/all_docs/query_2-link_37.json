        "text": "Crossing the Swiss alps from Lake Constance to Lake Geneva surely is a classic route. The Alpine Panorama Route crosses the northern Alpine region with its many high passes and gorges. You will find a region so rich in its culture with beautiful vista, settlements and mountain farms. This route will seem strenuous for many and you will need to be trained. It will be a stamina testing trip but you will be rewarded with spectacular views which will last in your memory for many years.\n\nYou will follow the King of all routes as it is known in Veloland Switzerland! You will be cycling between two of its great lakes, Lake Constance and Lake Geneva. This Alpine panorama route rises up to 2000 meters above sea level and crosses several major and minor mountain passes. Hard to conquer, sensational in terms of the view! road bikes are a must here, indeed this is the only signposted cycle route in Switzerland which is 100% tarmac roads."
