        "text": "Nature is a precious commodity. Apart from the world-famous Swiss chocolate and the versatile Swiss army knife, it is an important trademark of Switzerland.\n\nWho doesn't think of snow-covered mountains, green meadows with grazing cows, or sparkling mountain lakes when he - or she - dreams of the small confederation in the Alps?\n\nSome of these typical Swiss landscapes are part of a support program launched by the federal government in 2007. Within the framework of this program, financial support is currently flowing to a total of 19 parks of national importance. A distinction is made between three categories: National parks, regional nature parks and nature discovery parks.\n\nKarte der Schweizer Naturparks (Foto: Parks Swiss)\n\nBinntal (Foto: Parks Swiss Brigitte Wolf)\n\nThus, parks are supported throughout Switzerland that are characterized by \"beautiful landscapes, rich biodiversity and high-quality cultural assets\". Regions, cantons and municipalities can apply to the federal government for this label and, if the required criteria are met, may benefit from financial support for their nature park.\n\nIf you are interested in starting your own nature park in Switzerland, you can find the requirements here.\n\nHowever, if you are more interested in an overview of the already existing parks, you can find it here.\n\nAll nature parks in Switzerland\n\nWe have compiled here all 20 nature parks of national importance in Switzerland. They are listed according to location, size and population.\n\nname of nature park location canton area (km²) inhabitants communities Regional Nature Park Schaffhausen North of the Rhine and west of Lake Constance Schaffhausen 213 28,600 15 Wilderness Park Zurich On the northwestern part of Lake Zurich, S-Bahn connection Zurich 11 80 5 Jurapark Aargau Rural Jura landscape between Basel and Zurich Aargau, Solothurn 241 42'000 28 Naturpark Thal South of Basel and north of the Aare Solothurn 139 15`000 8 Parc du Doubs Jura Mountains, along the Doubs River Jura, Neuchâtel, Bern 11 80 5 Parc Regional Chasseral Jura Mountains, northwest of Lake Biel Bern, Neuchâtel 474 51`000 23 Nature Park Jura Vaudois North of Lake Geneva Waadt 568 39’700 34 UNESCO Biosphere Entlebuch West of Lucerne and Mount Pilatus Lucerne 395 17,700 7 Nature Park Gantrisch South of Bern and northwest of Thun Bern, Fribourg 404 37'400 19 Regional Park Gruyere Lake Geneva (Montreux) to Gruyère and Saanenland (Gstaad) Fribourg, Vaud 503 14'700 13 Nature Park Jorat Cohesive forest area of the Swiss Plateau Vaud 9 20 1 Nature Park Diemtigtal Southwest of Lake Thun to Mount Gsür Bern 136 2400 2 Nature Park Pfyn-Finges Central Valais,south of Leukerbad, between Gampel and Sierre Wallis 277 11,000 12 Landscape Park Binntal East of the Breithorn to the Italian border Wallis 181 1200 5 Parco Val Calanca in the Italian-speaking part Graubünden 120 400 4 Naturpark Beverin Four valleys (including the Rhine Gorge) around the Piz Beverin Graubünden 515 3700 9 Park Ela Between Albula, Bergün and Graubünden 548 5200 6 Swiss National Park Engadine Graubünden 170 - - Biosphere Val Müstair beyond the Ofen Pass Graubünden 199 1400 1 Nature Park Trient Valley (from 2024) Between the peaks of the Arpille and the Cime del'Est Wallis 7\n\nRegional Nature Park Schaffhausen\n\nThe Schaffhausen Regional Nature Park celebrated its entry into the federal funding program in 2018. Two of its municipalities lie across the Swiss-German border.\n\nHow to reach the regional nature park Schaffhausen\n\nAll communities located in the regional nature park Schaffhausen can be reached by public transport. Be it by bus, train or boat. By car, it is best to drive via Schaffhausen and then make your way to your destination.\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Renato Bagattini)\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Peer Füglistaller)\n\nWilderness Park Zurich with Sihlwald and Langenberg\n\nThe Wildnispark Zürich is the smallest Swiss nature park. It includes Sihlwald as well as Langenberg. It is the first nationally recognized nature experience park. It has been part of the federal government's funding program since 2010.\n\nHow to reach the Zurich Wilderness Park\n\nBoth parks are easily accessible by public transport from Zurich, Thalwil and Horgen. It is also possible to get there by car, although the parking fees are a flat rate of CHF 10 per day for the zoo and CHF 5 for the wilderness park.\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Metzger Rottmann Bürge AG)\n\nSonnenschein im Naturpark Sihlwald (Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Marcus Gyger)\n\nJurapark Aargau\n\nSince 2012, the Jurapark Aargau has borne its nature park title. It extends in the north to the German border, which is formed by the Rhine. On the eastern and southern edge, the park is bordered by the Aare River.\n\nHow to get to Jurapark Aargau\n\nAll the communities of Jurapark Aargau can be reached either by car, by bicycle - for example on the Route Verte - or by public transport from Aarau, Brugg, Zurich or Basel.\n\nJurapark Aargau is also ideally located for travel by car and can be easily reached via the freeway from Aarau, Brugg, Zurich, Basel and Bern.\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Renato Bagattini)\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Renato Bagattini)\n\nThal Nature Park\n\nAnother old hand in the business is the Thal Nature Park, which has been one of the Swiss nature parks since 2010. It extends in the canton of Solothurn. With its location in the triangle between Bern, Zurich and Basel, it is very easy to reach.\n\nThe Nature Park website offers a wealth of further information on experiences, accommodation, mountain restaurants, hikes, sports activities and events.\n\nHow to reach the Thal Nature Park\n\nThe Thal Nature Park is easily accessible by public transport from several directions. Be it by train via Oensingen and Balsthal, by cable car via Solothurn and Weissenstein or by post bus from the canton of Basel-Landschaft.\n\nThe park is also well accessible by car, as it has direct access to the A1 freeway via Oensingen and is not far from the Egerkingen freeway junction.\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Roland Gerth)\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Renato Bagattini)\n\nParc du Doubs\n\nIf the Doubs has already found no place in the enumeration of water bodies in Switzerland, it is at least duly mentioned here. This river characterizes the northern part of the nature park and is responsible for its naming. At the same time, it forms the border to France north of the Jura mountains.\n\nThe Parc du Doubs accommodates a large portion of nature on its surface and no densely populated settlements.\n\nBut all the more horses.\n\n_Swiss Activities Tip: Be prepared for cooler temperatures in the Franches-Montagnes than on the banks of the Doubs. Even on sunny days, appearances can be deceiving and having an extra layer of clothes up your sleeve is certainly not a bad idea\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Gerry Nitsch)\n\nGruere_(Switzerland Tourism/Martin Maegli).\n\nFor more information, discoveries and suggestions for this area, visit the website of the Parc du Doubs.\n\nHow to reach the Parc du Doubs\n\nYou can reach the Parc du Doubs by public transport, but not as easily as, for example, the Jurapark Aargau. However, if you have a little more time, this is not a serious problem\n\nThe cities of La Chaux-de-Fonds, Le Locle and St-Ursanne are on the SBB network and various villages in the Franches-Montagnes can be reached by train. Buses and cable cars also provide access to the park\n\nWith your own car you are of course also in good hands here. In this case, it is best to travel via Biel or Neuchâtel via La Chaux-de-Fonds.\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Raffael Waldner)\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Giglio Pasqua)\n\nParc régional Chasseral\n\nFacts and figures about the Parc régional Chasseral\n\nFor the Chasseral Nature Park, we will stay in the Jura mountains for the time being. It was named after the Chasseral, the highest elevation in the Bernese Jura, which is also considered the viewing terrace of the Swiss Jura. It has held the title of regional nature park since 2012.\n\nFor more information on discovering the Chasseral Nature Park, with up-to-date details and offers, visit this website\n\nHow to reach the Parc régional Chasseral\n\nIf you are not on your way from Schaffhausen to Geneva by bike, you can also reach the Chasseral Nature Park by public transport. From Biel, La Chaux-de-Fonds and Neuchâtel you can reach the park in less than 20 minutes. You can either take the train, the bus or your own car.\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Martin Maegli)\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Daniel Abort)\n\nJura Vaudois Nature Park\n\nThe Jura Vaudois Nature Park has been part of the Swiss Nature Parks since 2013. It is the westernmost park in Switzerland and thus the last in our list to be located in the Jura mountains. Thanks to its proximity to the densely populated coast of Lake Geneva, it is a popular destination for the people of western Switzerland.\n\nMore suggestions and inspirations can be found on the website of the Jura Vaudois Nature Park. However, the site exists exclusively in French, although the many pictures fortunately speak a globally understandable language\n\nHow to reach the Jura Vaudois Nature Park\n\nThe park is very easy to reach from different starting points. Whether you start in Geneva, Nyon, Morges or Lausanne, public transport gives you easy access\n\nWithin the park there are several train and post bus lines, which makes a car practically unnecessary. Although you can of course also reach the park by choosing any access road from the direction of Lake Geneva.\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Roland Gerth)\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Roland Gerth)\n\nUNESCO Biosphere Entlebuch\n\nFacts and figures about the Entlebuch Biosphere Reserve\n\nThere are around 700 biosphere reserves worldwide, with one of them located in the canton of Lucerne. The Entlebuch Biosphere is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and covers an area of 395 km². It extends over seven municipalities and is home to around 17,700 inhabitants\n\nThe Entlebuch has been a UNESCO Biosphere since 2001 and since 2008, when the federal program was launched, it has been one of Switzerland's regional nature parks.\n\nWhat awaits you in the Entlebuch Biosphere\n\nThe Entlebuch Biosphere is characterized in particular by its many moorland landscapes. The \"wild west of Lucerne\", as the area is also called, consists of a quarter of moors of national importance. Nowhere in Switzerland will you find more moors than here\n\nBut also alpine meadows, wild mountain streams and the imposing Schrattenfluh are part of this nature park. It is not for nothing that the Entlebuch is considered a model and showcase region by UNESCO\n\nDue to the wide range of leisure activities, the Entlebuch is a popular vacation region that offers something for almost every taste. If you are looking for a relaxing beach vacation, you will unfortunately be disappointed here. But otherwise you are sure to find something that suits your preferences.\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Martin Mägli)\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Gerry Nitsch)\n\nThe assortment of ways to pass the time in Entlebuch is immense and you will not find it difficult to occupy yourself here for a few days. Especially for families, the nature park offers a lot of options, which makes it a suitable destination for active family vacations.\n\nYou can find more information on topics such as accommodation, gastronomy, packages, events and much more on the website of the UNESCO Biosphere Entlebuch\n\nHow to reach the Biosphere Entlebuch\n\nThe nature park is easily accessible by public transport from various directions, whether by bus or train. Trains run regularly from Lucerne and Bern to the Entlebuch, and various post bus routes lead to the more remote villages. By the way, the Entlebuch belongs to the validity area of the Tellpass.\n\nThe biosphere is also easily accessible by car via Lucerne or Bern.\n\n(Schweiz Tourismus Jan Geerk)\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Silvano Zeiter)\n\nGantrisch Nature Park\n\nFacts and figures about the Gantrisch Nature Park\n\nThings get much more mountainous in the Gantrisch Nature Park, which has been one of Switzerland's nature parks since 2012. Covering an area of 404 km², it extends over the territory of 19 municipalities and is home to around 37,400 inhabitants\n\nThe park was named after the Gantrisch chain, a mountain range in the Bernese Alps southwest of Thun. Unlike the parks in the Jura Mountains, the peaks here are considerably higher, at more than 2,000 meters above sea level\n\nWhat awaits you in the Gantrisch Nature Park\n\nThe Gantrisch Nature Park advertises many features, one of which immediately catches the eye. Due to the low light pollution, you can experience clear starry nights in the park and hunt for shooting stars. So make a note of your most urgent wishes and go on a shooting star hunt.\n\nAlso during the day there is a lot to see and discover in the Gantrisch Nature Park. On the one hand, there are deep canyons and gorges through which the river \"Schwarzwasser\" meanders. On the other hand, you encounter vast moorlands, the striking Gantrisch chain and endless forests. The importance of the forest must be especially emphasized here\n\nThe Gantrisch Nature Park is home to one of the largest contiguous forest areas in Switzerland. In addition, four times more people work here in the agricultural and forestry sector than the Swiss average.\n\nFrom a cultural-historical point of view there are some treasures to be found here. Spread over the park you will find castles, various baths in the Gurnigel area - which bear witness to the old bathing culture - but also the Schwarzenburg chapel, a part of the Jakobsweg with the Rüeggisberg monastery and various farmhouses built in the style typical of the region. In addition, the Gantrisch Nature Park has eight museums and three observatories\n\nYou remember the clear nights? That was no joke.😉\n\n(Foto: Switzerland Tourism Ivo Scholz)\n\n(Foto: Switzerland Tourism Ivo Scholz)\n\nHow to reach the Gantrisch Nature Park\n\nThe Gantrisch Nature Park is well served by public transport. On the one hand with the train from Bern or within the park with various post bus lines. In winter there is even a snow bus\n\nIf you arrive with your own car - no matter if you come from Bern, Thun or Fribourg - there are several parking lots available\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Alain Rumpf)\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Ivo Scholz)\n\nGruyère Regional Park\n\nFacts and figures about Gruyère Regional Park\n\nWe are cheating a bit with this park. Its full name is \"Parc naturel régional Gruyère Pays-d'Enhaut\". A tongue twister that I would like to spare you and me. Therefore, for the moment, we give it the pet name \"Regional Park Gruyère\"\n\nIt has been part of the inventory of Swiss nature parks since 2012 and covers an area of 503 km². Its territory includes 13 communes and about 14,700 inhabitants. It stretches from the shores of Lake Geneva in Montreux to the Gruyère region and the Saanenland region near Gstaad.\n\nWhat awaits you in the Gruyère Regional Park\n\nWell-known cheeses such as Gruyère, l'Etivaz and Fribourg Vacherin come from this region, so it is not surprising that there are several opportunities to follow in the footsteps of one of Switzerland's most important trademarks\n\nOther features of the Gruyère Regional Park are deep valleys, lush alpine and mountain meadows, numerous wooded areas but also rock faces and steep scree slopes\n\nThe medieval town of Gruyères and the Cailler chocolate factory in Broc are located just outside the park. Just in case you get a craving for chocolate after a long hike, followed by a photo stop in Gruyères\n\nHow best to explore the Gruyère Regional Park\n\nThe park is a true hiker's paradise. By bike you are less well off here than in most other parks, although there are nevertheless isolated bike routes. So we suggest you put on your walking shoes and choose one of the many hikes.\n\nOn the route Les Granges - Gérignoz - l'Etivaz you will find yourself in the largest nature reserve in western Switzerland. This five-hour hike will challenge your legs as you climb over 1,000 meters in altitude\n\nThe cheese trail from Allières to Montbovon is a bit more leisurely. Yes, there are indeed cheese trails in the Gruyère Regional Park. Here you'll find more candidates\n\nThis hike through the moorland at Col des Mosses leads past alpine huts, cow pastures and last but not least the enchanting mountain lake Lac Lioson\n\nFor an excursion on a bike, there are two signposted routes from Schweizmobil. On the one hand there is the Alpine Panorama Route for cyclists and on the other hand the Panorama Bike Route for mountain bikers\n\nMore route suggestions and details about the Parc naturel régional Gruyère Pays-d'Enhaut - seriously, who came up with that name? - can be found on this website\n\nBy the way, the Golden Pass Line, one of the five big panoramic trains, passes right through the Gruyère Regional Park on its way from Montreux to Lucerne. If you're not much of a hiker and more of a connoisseur, this would be a calorie-saving option to visit the park.\n\nHow to reach the Gruyère Regional Park\n\nThe Gruyère Regional Park is well connected by train and several post bus lines. Be it from Fribourg, Gstaad, Montreux or Bulle. If you like winding roads, you will also be happy here with your own car\n\nHowever, there is no direct road from the heart of the park down to the southern part on Lake Geneva. For that you would have to take the highway from Bulle via Vevey to Montreux or the train through the mountains\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Marcus Gyger)\n\nSchlucht im Naturpark Gruyere (Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Tina Sturzenegger)\n\nJorat Nature Park\n\nFacts and figures about the Jorat Nature Park\n\nSmall but mighty takes on a whole new meaning in connection with the Jorat Nature Park. Strictly speaking, it is not a nature park, but only a nature park candidate. It has been on the list since 2016 because it would like to be a nature discovery park\n\nRegistered or not, no one is left out here. With a manageable 9 km², it is located in a single municipality and only 20 people live on its territory\n\nWhat awaits you in the Jorat Nature Park\n\nOne thing above all awaits you in the Jorat Nature Park.\n\nForest.\n\nAt 40 km², the Jorat forests are the largest contiguous forest area in the Swiss midlands. Since it rains a lot here, the forest is considered a water reservoir that could temporarily guarantee the region's water supply in case of pollution of Lake Geneva.\n\nIn addition, the Jorat landscape provides a home for a variety of insects, amphibians, birds and mammals. Since the park is not far from the last metro station of the Lausanne Métro, it registers about one million walkers per year\n\nSo you see. Small, fine but very busy.\n\nThe best way to discover the Jorat Nature Park\n\nThe best way to discover the Jorat Nature Park is on foot along one of the numerous walking trails, paths and boardwalks. Cyclists pass the southern edge of the park on the Swiss mobile route from Lausanne to Payerne.\n\nFor more information on the project around the Jorat Nature Park and its goal of earning a place in the federal program, visit this French-language website\n\nHow to reach the Jorat Nature Park\n\nWith the Métro to Epalinges and a subsequent bus ride, the Jorat Nature Park is easily accessible from Lausanne.\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus Maxime Rebord)\n\n(Foto: Schweiz Tourismus)\n\nDiemtigtal Nature Park\n\nFacts and figures about the Diemtigtal Nature Park\n\nOn the other side of Gstaad, midway between the Gruyère Regional Park and Lake Thun, lies the remote Diemtigtal. With its 136 km², the nature park is rather one of the smaller ones of its kind. It has been part of the Swiss nature parks since 2012, is located on the territory of two municipalities and has about 2400 inhabitants\n\nSomehow also small and fine - although not in the same style as the Jorat Nature Park. The 19 km long valley stretches from Oey-Diemtigen - which, by the way, is also on the route of the Golden Pass Line - to the Landvogtehore, a 2,616 meter high mountain peak at the end of the valley\n\nWhat awaits you in the Diemtigtal Nature Park\n\nWith around 140 alpine farms that lead more than 10,000 cows, cattle, sheep and goats into the Diemtig Alps in summer, the Diemtigtal is one of the most important communities in the Swiss alpine economy. The concert of bells during the hikes and mountain bike tours is therefore pre-programmed.\n\nWhat you can also look forward to are magnificent flower meadows, a wild mountain landscape, beautiful views wherever you look, ice-cold mountain streams, glittering mountain lakes and a diverse animal world. So keep your eyes open on your hikes for ibexes, chamois, marmots and other mountain creatures.\n\nParticularly impressive are the many beautiful Diemtigtaler houses, which are decorated with elaborate carvings and paintings. By the way, these are connected in various themed trails that can be walked with the help of an app. But we'll get to that in a moment.\n\n(Foto: MySwitzerland)\n\nHaus im Naturpark Diemtigtal\n\nHow to best explore the Diemtigtal Nature Park\n\nThe range of activities in the Diemtigtal Nature Park is very comprehensive. You can explore it on foot, by bike, on a mountain bike, on horseback or along one of the many themed trails\n\nEverything about hiking, including suggested routes to mountain lakes, peaks and the Alps, can be found on the hiking page of the Diemtigtal Nature Park.\n\nThe three Diemtigtaler Hauswege lead you past the most beautiful houses and let you marvel again and again. Don't forget to install the app for it\n\nThanks to various other theme trails you will never get bored here. Whether you are interested in birds, cultural history, churches or wild roses\n\nBikers get their money's worth in the Bike Park Wierihorn and on the numerous biking routes. Put on your helmet and get into the fun.\n\nThe scooter fun on the Wierihorn is something for small and adult children\n\nYou can also enjoy the Diemtigtal Nature Park in the air or on horseback.\n\nAs you can see, the Diemtigtal offers something for everyone. No matter whether you are looking for peace and quiet and a few beautiful photos or for a proper adrenaline rush. You can find more information about the nature park on this website\n\nHow to reach the Diemtigtal Nature Park\n\nThe Diemtigtal is only accessible from one side. Unless you are on a hiking tour and arrive via one of the many mountains standing around. Otherwise you can travel by train to Oey-Diemtigen and change there to the post bus\n\nIf you are traveling by car, drive via Spiez in the direction of Zweisimmen and take the turnoff to Diemtigtal in Oey.\n\n(Foto: Switzerland Tourism Roland Gerth)\n\nWandern mit Familie im Naturpark Diemtigtal (Foto: MySwitzerland)\n\nPfyn-Finges Nature Park\n\nFacts and figures about the Pfyn-Finges Nature Park\n\nIn the canton of Valais - which, along with Ticino, is one of the two southernmost cantons in Switzerland - there are two nature parks. One of them is the Pfyn-Finges Nature Park, which covers an area of 277 km² and 12 communes. It has been part of the inventory of Swiss nature parks since 2013 and is inhabited by around 11,000 people\n\nThe special feature of this park is that it is located on the language border between the German and French speaking parts of Switzerland. In addition, the differences in altitude within its territory are considerable, as the lowest point is at 500 and the highest at 4153 m.a.s.l. As you can see, this is a very contrasting area.\n\nWhat awaits you in the Pfyn-Finges Nature Park\n\nThe variety of landscapes and habitats in the Pfyn-Finges Nature Park is impressive. On the one hand, glaciers, rocky steppes, some of the highest mountains in Switzerland and several alpine huts can be found in the park, while not far away are endless pine forests, stately castles, various floodplain areas and the fertile Rohnetal valley with its numerous vineyards.\n\nThe core of the Pfyn-Finges Nature Park consists of the Pfynwald protected area. This forest is one of the largest pine forests the Alps have to offer and is one of the most important biodiversity hotspots in Switzerland on 17 km². The park is also a paradise for ornithologists, as it is home to a large number of different bird species. Even eagles can be observed in the Pfyn-Finges Nature Park.\n\nIf you have a little sommelier slumbering inside you and would like to give it some exercise, you will get your money's worth here. Over 80 wine shops offer their regional products and wine tastings, most of which can be found in the wine village of Salgesch and on the wine island of Varen\n\nHow you can best explore the Pfyn-Finges Nature Park\n\nWith over 450 km of signposted hiking trails, there are more than enough options for exploring Pfyn-Finges Nature Park on foot. You can also make good progress by bike or mountain bike. If you don't have your own bike, you can rent one in Leuk or in Sierre.\n\nThe nature park website has numerous route suggestions, excursion ideas and themed trails posted. These include the following:\n\nThe Wine Trail from Sierre to Salgesch takes 2-4 hours and leads through the heart of the Valais wine industry.\n\nOn the Birdwatching Tour, which is about 15 km long, rare bird species such as the kingfisher can be observed with a bit of luck.\n\nA completely different landscape is revealed on the Lämmeren Glacier Trail, which leads through a floodplain landscape of national importance.\n\nVarious biking routes meander through the park.

Fischer)\n\nParco Val Calanca\n\nFacts and figures about Parco Val Calanca\n\nAnother nature park, which for the time being is only a candidate for the title and is waiting to be included in the federal inventory, is the Parco Val Calanca in the canton of Graubünden. It covers an area of 120 km² and extends over the territory of four municipalities. With only about 400 inhabitants, it is very sparsely populated.\n\nThe sunny valley is open towards the south and is protected in the north by mountains up to 3000 meters high. In addition, the park is home to a small mountain lake in the shape of a heart, which the organizers immediately incorporated into their logo\n\nWhat to expect at Parco Val Calanca\n\nSome of the features of the idyllic Parco Val Calanca are the traditional stone and wooden settlements, well-preserved mule tracks, a wild and unspoiled nature with a diverse wildlife, two very remote villages that can be reached only by cable car and a crystal clear river landscape in the bottom of the valley.\n\nParco Val Calanca is far from the transit traffic between the northern and southern Alps, which makes it a very quiet destination. For wildlife, the park offers an ideal habitat and if you keep your eyes open a bit, you may be lucky enough to see ibexes, deer, chamois and even golden eagles or black grouse\n\nWater-wise, the park has a lot to offer. On the one hand there is the Calancasca River, but also several waterfalls and mountain lakes can be found in this small area.\n\nThe best way to explore Parco Val Calanca\n\nIn Parco Val Calanca you are ideally on foot. Bicycle and mountain bike routes are not really found here, but there are several beautiful hikes that will lead you into the hidden valley:\n\nThe Via Calanca is a hike that can be done in three stages.\n\nThe Panoramic Calanca Valley Trail is a leisurely hike that is also suitable for families.\n\nIn the Lower Calanca Valley there is a circular hike that is perfect for nature lovers who are in good shape.\n\nOther trails start in Rossa, a village at the end - or beginning? - of the Via Calanca\n\nAdditional information about this park candidate can be found on the website of Parco Val Calanca.\n\nHow to reach the Parco Val Calanca\n\nWith public transport it is a bit of a cramp to reach the Parco Val Calanca. With the post bus from Chur or Bellinzona you can get to Rossa, a good starting point for various hikes, with one or two changes\n\nThe Calanca Valley is easily accessible all year round via the A2 and A13 freeways. Here you will find a more detailed description of your journey to the Parco Val Calanca\n\n(Foto: Switzerland Tourism Andreas Gerth)\n\n(Foto: Switzerland Tourism Daniel Loosli)\n\nBeverin Nature Park\n\nFacts and figures about the Beverin Nature Park\n\nLet's move on to a somewhat larger park for a change.

The name means something like \"bad way\". And it is not by chance. If you find yourself on the well-prepared hiking trail with bridges and wooden footbridges in this unpleasant gorge and imagine how dangerous this obstacle on the way south used to be, the pessimistic naming will hardly surprise you.\n\nHow you can best explore the Beverin Nature Park\n\nThe Beverin Nature Park can be explored on foot, by bicycle or mountain bike. But certain gorges are also available for a trip in a canoe or a canyoning tour. It all depends on how much adrenaline you want to release during your stay in the park. Among the options you can choose from are:\n\nThe Via Capricorn is entirely dedicated to the ibex and takes you on a 51 km hike, covered in three stages, across the ibex territory at Schamserberg.

Nowhere else in Switzerland will you encounter so many marmots, ibexes and other wild animals in the wild\n\nThe Swiss National Park has existed since 1914 and is located in the Engadine in the canton of Graubünden. It covers an area of 170 km²] and apart from a very rich wildlife, there is no permanent resident population in the park.\n\nSince 2010, together with the municipalities of Val Müstair and Scuol, it forms the UNESCO Biosphere Val Müstair, which you will learn more about later. With over 100 years under its belt, it is not only the oldest national park in the Alps, but also the best protected.\n\nWhat to expect in the Swiss National Park\n\nAs you can guess, it's all about one thing\n\nNature.\n\nThe national park is open to visitors on around 100 km of signposted hiking trails and a total of 21 routes.
