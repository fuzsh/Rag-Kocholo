Marbachegg is a viewing point in a league of its own – with the Schibegütsch and Hogant on the horizon and, between, a surprising view of the Bernese Alps, Schreckhorn, Finsteraarhorn and Eiger.\n\nPeople visit Marbachegg to relax, eat well and enjoy hikes to Alp Imbrig (where the cheese is made) and Kemmeribodenbad.
