        "text": "The modern Alpine landscape and its foreland were strongly impacted by the numerous glacier advance and retreat cycles during the Middle-to-Late Pleistocene. Due to the overall erosive character of each glaciation cycle, however, direct traces of older glaciations tend to be poorly preserved within the formerly glaciated domains of the pan-Alpine area. Nevertheless, sediments of older glaciations may occur hidden under the modern surface in buried glacially overdeepened troughs that reach below the normal level of fluvial erosion (fluvial base level). These sedimentary archives, partly dating back to the Middle Pleistocene period, are of great scientific value for reconstructing the timing and extent of extensive Alpine glaciation, paleocli-mate, and paleoenvironmental changes in the past and help to better understand ongoing and future changes in the pan-Alpine area. Therefore, the International Continental Scientific Drilling Program (ICDP) project DOVE (Drilling Overdeepened Alpine Valleys) targets several of these glacial overdeepened sedimentary basins to recover their sedimentary infills. In the frame of the DOVE project, a 252 m long drill core of unconsolidated Quaternary sediments was recovered in northern Switzerland from an over 300 m deep glacially overdeepened structure (\"Basadingen Trough\") formed by the former Rhine Glacier lobe system. The recovered sedimentary succession was divided into three stratigraphic units on the basis of lithological and petrophysical characteristics. The lowest unit, deposited below the fluvial base level, consists of an over 200 m thick succession of glacial to (glacio)lacustrine sediments and contains remains of possibly two glaciation cycles. Overlying this lowermost succession, an ∼ 37 m thick fluvial-to-glaciofluvial gravel deposit occurs, which correlates to a locally outcrop-ping Middle Pleistocene formation (\"Buechberg Gravel Complex\"). The sediment succession is capped by an ∼ 11 m thick diamictic succession interpreted as the subglacial till from the later extensive glaciation, including the regional glaciation during the Last Glacial Maximum. The recovered sediment succession thus supports the proposed multi-phase origin of trough formation and its infill.\n\nInactive stalagmites from the Silberen cave system and its surroundings (Muota Valley, Central Switzerland) have been dated by the Th/U method (alpha spectrometry and TIMS). Several samples yielded ages of approximately 200 ka (MIS 7) and 320 ka (MIS 9), others were beyond the upper limit of the method (about >350 ka) or might have behaved as open systems with respect to uranium. The following complementary dating methods were applied: U/U, paleomagnetism, palynology and electron spin resonance. Paleomagnetism yielded positive inclination of the natural remanent magnetization of two stalagmite samples, corresponding to the Brunhes-epoch ( German Inaktive Stalagmiten aus dem Silberen-Höhlensystem und dessen Umgebung (Zentralschweiz) sind mittels der ²³⁰Th/U-Methode (Alpha-Spektrometrie bzw. TIMS) datiert worden. Einige Proben ergaben ²³⁰Th/U-Alter zwischen von 320 ka (MIS 9) und 200 ka (MIS 7), andere lagen ausserhalb des Zeitfensters der ²³⁰Th/U-Methode (>350 ka), wieder andere könnten offene Uran-Systeme gebildet haben. Ergänzend zu den numerischen Datierungen wurden versuchsweise weitere Datierungsmethoden eingesetzt: ²³⁴U/²³⁸U, Paläomagnetik, Palynologie und Elektronen-Spin-Resonanz. Die Paläomagnetik zeigte bei den zwei untersuchten Tropfsteinen eine positive Inklination der natürlichen remanenten Magnetisierung, was der Brunhes-Epoche (230Th/U-Alter, die Ergebnisse der palynologischen und der paläomagnetischen Untersuchungen weisen somit für die datierten Stalagmiten auf ein Alter zwischen 780 und 200 ka. Die ²³⁴U/²³⁸U- und die ESR-Methode lieferten keine schlüssigen Resultate. Aus der bekannten Hebungsrate des Gebirges, dem korrosiven Abtrag der Karstoberfläche sowie der Eintiefung des Muotatals wurde abgeleitet, dass die Verkarstung im Untersuchungsgebiet vor 4 bis 3 Ma (Mittleres bis Oberes Pliozän) begonnen hat. Die bislang datierten Karsthöhlensedimente sind nach diesem Modell also wesentlich jünger als der Anfang der Speleogenese.\n\nWhile stalagmites within caves are commonly used to obtain information about past climate change, little attention has so far been given to the cave, its morphology, and many other types of deposits contained in it. The discontinuous nature of cave sediments and the possibility that caves are re-shaped by more recent water circulations has discouraged many researchers, despite the fact that it is just this intimate relationship between the cave and surface conditions that makes caves such valuable archives. This article presents a method of determining a relative chronology which can then be dated numerically. Information from St. Beatus Cave and other nearby caves provides evidence of glacial advances that occurred within the following time windows: >350, 235–180, 160–135, 114–99, 76–54, and 30–16 ka. It also describes the following dated periods of valley deepening: 805–760 m a.s.l. (>350 ka), 760–700 m a.s.l. (235–180 ka), 700–660 m a.s.l. (160–135 ka), and 660–560 m a.s.l. (30–16 ka). These dates are new for this part of the Alpine Arc.\n\nDehnert, A., Preusser, F., Kramers, J. D., Akçar, N., Kubik, P. W., Reber, R. & Schlüchter, C. 2010: A multi‐dating approach applied to proglacial sediments attributed to the Most Extensive Glaciation of the Swiss Alps. Boreas , Vol. 39, pp. 620–632. 10.1111/j.1502‐3885.2010.00146.x. ISSN 0300‐9483. The number and the timing of Quaternary glaciations of the Alps are poorly constrained and, in particular, the age of the Most Extensive Glaciation (MEG) in Switzerland remains controversial. This ice advance has previously been tentatively correlated with the Riss Glaciation of the classical alpine stratigraphy and with Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 (186–127 ka). An alternative interpretation, based on pollen analysis and stratigraphic correlations, places the MEG further back in the Quaternary, with an age equivalent to MIS 12 (474–427 ka), or even older. To re‐evaluate this issue in the Swiss glaciation history, a multi‐dating approach was applied to proglacial deltaic ‘Höhenschotter’ deposits in locations outside the ice extent of the Last Glacial Maximum. Results of U/Th and luminescence dating suggest a correlation of the investigated deposits with MIS 6 and hence with the Riss Glaciation. Cosmogenic burial dating suffered from large measurement uncertainties and unusually high ²⁶ Al/ ¹⁰ Be ratios and did not provide robust age estimates.\n\nBased on surface and borehole information, together with pre-existing regional and local interpretations, a 7,150 square kilometre Raster Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the bedrock surface of northern Switzerland was constructed using a 25m cell size. This model represents a further important step in the understanding of Quaternary sediment distribution and is open to a broad field of application and analysis, including hydrogeological, geotechnical and geophysical studies as well as research in the field of Pleistocene landscape evolution. An analysis of the overdeepened valleys in the whole model area and, more specifically in the Reuss area, shows that, in most cases, overdeepening is restricted to the areas covered by the Last Glaciation Maximum (LGM). However, at various locations relatively narrow overdeepened valleys outreach the tongue basins and the LGM ice shield limits. Therefore, an earlier and further-reaching glacial event has probably contributed significantly to the overdeepening of these valleys. No significant overdeepening has been identified downstream of Böttstein (Aare) and Kaiserstuhl (Rhine), although the ice extended considerably further downstream, at least during the most extensive glaciation. Except for the bedrock between Brugg and Böttstein, no overdeepened valleys are found significantly north of the outcrop of Mesozoic limestone of the Folded and Tabular Jura. A detailed analysis of the Reuss area shows that the Lake and Suhre valleys are separated from the Emmen—Gisikon Reuss valley basin by a significant bedrock barrier. The individual bedrock valleys are divided into several sub-basins, indicating a multiphase evolution of the valleys. Some of the swells or barriers separating the sub-basins coincide with known late LGM retreat stages. In the Suhre valley, an old fluvial valley floor with restricted overdeepened sections is documented. KeywordsQuaternary cover–Bedrock surface–Overdeepened valleys–DEM–GIS"
