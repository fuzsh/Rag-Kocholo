        "text": "Hello Onebaggers, I am an American who will soon embark on a backpacking-hostel journey around Europe for an unknown amount of time (~2 months maybe). I've never been to europe nor have I solo backpacked before so this will be many firsts. I have been reading up things on this subreddit and have put together my bag and everything that I will be bringing (refer to images). Keep in mind I do need my laptop for remote work. I plan on staying in mainly hostels in the cities, not planning on camping.\n\nAlso I have a small strap around bag coming in the mail, going to use it for day trips within cities and whatnot. Its probably around 8-10L.\n\nPlease give me your criticism, what do you think? What should i get rid of and what am i missing? Too many or too little underwear/socks? Is the Turkish cotton towel unnecessary? Should i bother bringing a long shirt if i have a pullover, or vise versa?\n\nAdditionally, currently I have a shitty hand-me-down backpack with no waist support (its called onestory travel backpack 45L). I am wondering if I should just pull the trigger on a more expensive backpack for the convenience, such as the Tortuga Travel Backpack Lite 40L. Thoughts?\n\nhttps://www.tortugabackpacks.com/products/travel-backpack-lite-40l\n\nOne more thing, i'm starting in Amsterdam and will make my way down to Italy but I am open to everything. The plan for the most part is no plan. Drop some great underrated places/(day)hikes I should make it to! Also drop any advise you think I need to hear!\n\nThanks\n\nEDIT: Pics didn't upload so here they are sorry if the image is massive lol:"
