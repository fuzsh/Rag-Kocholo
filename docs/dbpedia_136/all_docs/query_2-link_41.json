        "text": "Aim A plausible yet untested biogeographical scenario suggests that Quaternary glaciers shaped the present-day distribution of the groundwater amphipod Niphargus virei. This study was designed to test two hypotheses pertaining to this scenario: (1) the probability of occurrence of N. virei in ice-free areas decreases in the vicinity of the Würm glacier; and (2) dispersal is sufficiently low for the historical record of glacial effects to persist over time. Location The study area was located in the southern Jura Mountains, France. Methods A total of 497 sites were sampled to ascertain the distribution of N. virei in the southern Jura. Amplified fragment length polymorphism was analysed from a subset of 24 sites. The relationships between the probability of occurrence of N. virei and distance to the Würm glacier or elevation were investigated using a logistic regression. Spatial autocorrelation analyses were performed on both the residuals of the logistic regression and genetic distance to test the significance of dispersal and barriers to post-glacial recolonization. The influence of catchment boundaries as barriers to dispersal was examined using different neighbouring relationships between sites. We tested the statistical significance of the reduction in deviance and gain in precision of an autologistic regression that took into consideration the influence of dispersal constraints on the distribution of N. virei. Results Niphargus virei rarely occurred in formerly glaciated areas, and its probability of occurrence in ice-free areas decreased in the vicinity of the Würm glacier. Combined autocorrelation analyses of spatial distribution and spatial genetic structure showed that: (1) the distance at which spatial autocorrelation was no longer significantly positive did not exceed 16 km; (2) genetic differentiation fitted a model of isolation by distance; and (3) catchment boundaries acted as barriers to dispersal. The autologistic regression with dispersal constraints significantly increased our capacity to predict the distribution of N. virei. Maps of probabilities of occurrence suggested that post-glacial recolonization was impeded by the extension of glacial outwash. Main conclusions The present distribution of N. virei in southern Jura is probably the result of a historical range reduction driven by glaciation coupled with restricted dispersal and isolation by distance.\n\nCene Fišer\n\n·\n\nValerija Zakšek\n\n·\n\nMaja Zagmajster\n\n·\n\nBoris Sket\n\nNiphargus steueri (Niphargidae) comprises a complex of four subspecies (N. s. steueri, N. s. kolombatovici, N. s. subtypicus, and N. s. liburnicus), the morphology and distribution of which have been poorly known until now. New diagnostic characters of the species and its four subspecies are presented and illustrated. The species is distributed along the major part of the Dinaric Karst, between Slovenia in the northwest and Bosnia and Herzegovina in the southeast. The distribution of the four subspecies approximately resembles the distribution of the evolutionary lineages of the subterranean amphibian Proteus anguinus and the Dinaric lineage of the cave shrimp Troglocaris agg. anophthalmus. Niphargus s. steueri is restricted to the Istran Peninsula; N. s. subtypicus is distributed in southeast Slovenia and northwest Croatia; N. s. liburnicus is known from two disjunctive localities, one on the island of Krk (Croatia) and the other in Gorizia (Italy); and N. s. kolombatovici is restricted to Dalmacija and Herzegovina. The somewhat variable putative synapomorphies of N. steueri probably suggest that the group is old and that the present distribution pattern is a result of historical events, possibly events in the Miocene Dinaride Lake system. Two populations of N. s. kolombatovici and one population of N. s. subtypicus deviate from the general distributional pattern and may belong to cryptic taxa that cannot be distinguished on the basis of morphology. Both hypotheses corroborate with the estimated times of divergence and with the number of independent lineages in the similarly distributed but unrelated stygobionts Proteus and Troglocaris.\n\nView\n\nMarie-José Dole-Olivier\n\n·\n\nFlorian Malard\n\n·\n\nDOMINIQUE MARTIN\n\n·\n\n[...]\n\n·\n\nJANINE GIBERT\n\n1. Relationships between the assemblage structure of stygobionts (i.e. obligate groundwater species) and habitat conditions in aquifers were explored in the French Jura based on 16 environmental variables and presence/absence data on stygobiotic species. The two data sets were simultaneously collected at a total of 269 sites. 2. The study aimed to (i) identify the environmental factors determining the composition of stygobiotic assemblages at the regional scale; (ii) define the ecological preferences of the collected stygobiotic species along environmental gradients; and (iii) describe species assemblages occurring in similar habitats. These aims were pursued with a view to refine approaches to groundwater biodiversity assessment and sampling strategies. 3. A large number of stygobionts (62 species) were collected using a stratified sampling design. The measured environmental variables explained 72% of the overall variability in stygobiotic assemblage structure. Determining factors were primarily geology (pore size) and dissolved oxygen concentration, and secondarily altitude and distance of sampling sites from areas glaciated during the Pleistocene. Water chemistry and land‐cover variables had little influence on the composition of stygobiotic assemblages. 4. Ecological preferences of stygobiotic species were bounded along environmental gradients using Outlying Mean Index (OMI) analysis. Apart from rare species (frequency < 0.01), most stygobionts had a tolerance index >1, but residual tolerance observed in the most widespread species indicates sensitivity to other variables than those studied. 5. Biodiversity hotspots mainly occurred in highly permeable geological formations such as karst and coarse alluvial environments with well oxygenated water situated between 200 and 500 m altitude. More intensive sampling of high‐altitude sites is unlikely to yield additional species, but rare species may be found at low and mid altitudes and at sites far from the Würm glaciers.\n\nView\n\nPETER TRONTELJ\n\n·\n\nCHRISTOPHE J.

Various groundwater habitats have exceptionally high levels of endemism caused by strong hydrographical isolation and low dispersal abilities of their inhabitants. More than 10% of macro-stygobiotic species nevertheless occupy relatively large ranges, measuring from some hundred to over 2000 km in length. These species represent a challenge because their distributions disregard hydrographical boundaries, and their means to disperse and maintain long-term gene flow are unknown. 2. Based on mitochondrial and nuclear gene sequences, we examined the phylogeographic structure of six formally recognised stygobiotic species (Niphargus virei, N. rhenorhodanensis, Troglocaris anophthalmus, T. hercegovinensis, Spelaeocaris pretneri, Proteus anguinus) and searched for cryptic lineage diversity in a genus-wide phylogeny of Niphargus. Using tree-based criteria as well as comparative divergence measures, we identified cryptic lineages, which may tentatively be equated with cryptic species. 3. Fourteen analysed nominal stygobiotic species with large ranges emerged as highly diversified, splitting into 51 tentative cryptic lineages. The degree of divergence was within the range or larger than the divergence of other related pairs of sister species. A substantial part (94%) of the cryptic lineages had ranges <200 km in length. One half of them were recorded at single sites only. The largest range recorded was that of a cryptic N. virei lineage (700 km), while none of the very large traditional ranges (e.g. Niphargus aquilex– 2300 km, N. tauri– 1900 km) could be corroborated. 4. These data suggest that small ranges of macro-stygobionts are the rule, and ranges over 200 km are extremely rare. 5. The implications of this result for groundwater biodiversity assessment and conservation include a considerable increase in overall diversity at the regional and continental scale and a strong decrease in faunal similarities among regions, coupled with greater endemism.\n\nView"
