        "text": "Nideggen trails\n\nThere was once a time when Nideggen had a truly beautiful tour to offer with a lot of variety. Unfortunately, over the years, more and more pieces have been stolen due to closure or ban on cycling there. Well, it was never completely legal, but there was so much cycling that we weren't entirely sure how “illegal” it all was. Now things are really different.\n\nThe GPS that we always followed and shared is no longer driveable. There are now very clear fences with even clearer prohibition signs. Not only for mountain bikers, horse riders are also no longer welcome in a large part of the forest!\n\nThe Kappel trail\n\nFor the Kappel trail you have to go a little further south, which you can reach via the Panoramaweg. The trail starts directly behind the Kappel with a nice rock roller. The trail is relatively short but surprises you several times with quite technical sections over rocky areas and tight bends. Definitely worth making a detour for this.\n\nAll in all, less to drive than before, but certainly worth it for the much-needed variety Witten en Solingen for example!\n\nTo be sure, check locally whether mountain biking is allowed at that time, as German legislation is subject to change. Be sure to stay away from areas where it is clearly stated that you are not allowed to cycle there, you cannot miss it, clear fences with signs have been placed everywhere.\n\nHidden trails in the Cevennes France...\n\nIn our previous story we told you how best to explore trails when you are alone. This year we went on holiday with the family to... Cévennes. Top right near Anduze. Beautiful river, nice village, great. We went looking for hidden trails in the Cevennes France.\n\nTrail hunt in Anduze, France\n\nA few weeks before we went I had already peeked on Trailforks to see if anything could be found. On the map there seemed to be a “red trail” within cycling distance. It was exceptionally warm this holiday with temperatures up to 40 degrees during the day. Fortunately it was still reasonably doable during the night and morning, so: set the alarm, grab your stuff and go!\n\nOf course, completely according to my own 5-step plan. Looked up trails, looked at the region, got maps locally on my phone, WhatsApp shared location sent, brought enough food and drinks and go!\n\nSp1 Labahou red trail in Anduze\n\nThat overgrown content remained quite a thing in parts, flying through the fern bushes it took quite a bit of searching at times, but otherwise the Sp1 Labahou was a gem! Everywhere along the trail you could see that people had worked on it at some point. As mentioned, it was bone dry and trails with lots of loose stones and sand/dust also become very slippery. There was a kind of nice roller laid out everywhere with stones in front of a large stone where you had to drop off again, but explore several parts first. Check, watch and go! Those ferns are normally a guarantee against ticks, by the way. Check carefully afterwards! Fortunately, I knew that ticks do not like extreme drought, which significantly reduces the chance of unwanted visitors, you know that again 😉 The Sp1 Labahou red trail was a walk of just over an hour from the campsite. After the trail it still requires some climbing to get back to normal roads.\n\nSP2 Capelan trail in Anduze\n\nFrom 2de trail in the region was a bit further away, so I explored it first by car. Parked the bus as high as possible and continued the rest of the climb on foot to find the start. That looked good! Even better, I saw that where I ended up at the SP1 Labahou I was already 1/3 of the way up to the SP2 Capelan. Perfect for a combo. The SP2 Capelan was more passable without vegetation. At the top of Les Capelans (379m) I met a local hiker, a retired man. He taught skiing at Mont Ventoux for years, he said. The same Mont Ventoux could be seen from Les Capelans, 100km away as the crow flies! You have to know what the silhouette was but hard to see. The SP2 Capelan trail was a real treat, lots of rocks at the top and gradually more natural into the forest. Many bends, few straights with quite a few technical passages well distributed throughout the descent. Simply delicious!!\n\nDownload the GPS track of both trails here.\n\nBicycle advice:\n\nDefinitely a full suspension bike with at least 140mm front and rear. Furthermore, wear footwear because of the sharp stones and slippery surface.\n\nMore mountain biking in France? Check them out here\n\nStep 1: home research and the right cards\n\nThe first place to look is always there for me trailforks. If you see a lot of lines running, that is the best chance of cool trails. The color coding is often also great for estimating the difficulty of the trail. Unfortunately, this does not always guarantee the best trails, but it is still the best place to look first before you really have to go trail hunting. Found a trail? Make sure you check in advance how it will turn out. Not every trail simply starts at the top and ends in the valley. It often happens that you are halfway up a mountain or in a completely different valley. Use an app that has detailed topo maps and download it to your phone so that you don't have internet. need more. Having reach is not always a certainty. Check the legend to see what is what. My experience shows that the real small hiking trails are not always passable, make sure that the path to unpaved double tracks is as short as possible. Can't find any trail forks options? Komoot can possibly offer a way out, otherwise you have to rely on your topo maps and look for marked walking routes. Consider the well-known GR(NR) routes or check with the local tourist office for beautiful walking tours.\n\nStep 2: Check the trail locally\n\nAfter having come across completely impassable “walking routes” so often, I first explore if possible. Combine this with shopping or a day trip with your family by driving past the start or end of the trail.\n\nYou can often see what the situation is at the top of the mountain at the start. If the start is already completely overgrown, you are almost certain that it has become impassable and further trail hunting is unnecessary. If the first 20 meters look fine, you can assume with a little more certainty that the rest is also passable. Unfortunately, you can't always get to the start by car, but if you can, definitely do so! The other option is to inspect the end and walk a bit into the trail. If it doesn't look overgrown, you can take a chance.\n\nStep 3: Supplies and Rations!\n\nI think it's a no-brainer that your bike should be in order. What is important is that when you go out alone, you have to take unforeseen situations into account. While you normally have several reserve sources available in the entire group in case of an emergency, you now have nothing as an extra reserve during trail hunting. So take just a little bit more with you and make sure you are truly self-sufficient. Not only the right tools and extra inner tubes, but also in terms of food and water you should at least assume that your tour will take twice as long.\n\nI had already stood on a completely paved road on the mountain, I was almost at the top and could almost smell the campsite, the mountain was too steep to climb by bike, the road was the only option. The result was that I had to go all the way back into the valley and detour the entire mountain. This little excursion therefore took much longer and cost a lot more energy. In addition to tools, spare items and food, also take cash with you. Especially abroad, the debit card is not as accepted everywhere as we know it in the Benelux.\n\nThis view takes us straight to North America\n\nSaturday morning 8am – It's still a bit chilly, but actually nice to pedal uphill a bit. We start the tour in Flühli near Sörenberg. The morning sun in our back accompanies us on the first ascent on an alpine road to the “Hilferenpass”.\n\nFrom there you have a beautiful view of the impressive Schrattenfluh. We only know the Canadian landscape from photos, but this place somehow immediately transports us to the wild, untouched nature of North America.\n\nIn order to be able to ride some more single trails, we have adjusted the route a little. After a short descent on a forest road we turn right and go straight to the wild cliffs of Schrattenfluh. After a tough climb we ride a short single trail in the forest to the alpine farm “Vorderbättenalp”. From there we are back on the normal route.\n\nThe world famous Meringue awaits us…\n\nHowever, there is no time to rest, another rather tough climb gets the blood pumping, but rewards us with the “Imbrig” viewpoint at the highest point.\n\nThe panorama that spreads out before us is simply beautiful and the wooden bench is perfectly located for a short break. But we don't want to stay too long, because the world-famous Meringe awaits us in the Kemmeriboden Bath.\n\nOnce again we deviate from the standard route and opt for the single trail descent along the impressive slide “Lauizug”.\n\nFrom there we go quite directly to the Kemmeriboden-Bad Restaurant. Of course the meringues should not be missing - we ordered the small portion. And we can assure you, this is enough for two people for dessert ;-).\n\nOFF Day in Solingen\n\nDo you know that an “OFFDAY” is a day when you just can't get into your flow, a day when you make a fuss about things that you normally do... As is now known, we are working hard on our condition and technique. Every Tuesday evening we fill an hour to an hour and a half with manuals, wheelies, corners, step ups, etc. We now know that this pays off! Corners are better, wheelies take longer and the manual is in the works. Yet. Today is off to a bad start, how am I (Rik) going to pick this up?\n\nWonderful Enduro area here in Solingen\n\nYou can enjoy driving in Solingen. There are beautiful technical trails, many rock roots with steep parts. We immediately start with a technically challenging trail, it has everything and the steepness is above average. The first meters feel awkward, but despite that we roll down the rock garden without any problems, Nico takes his testicles with us, but that's beside the point 😉 After the rock garden there is a roll. Nothing special, it's a bit steep, it's a bit slippery. After driving several times, I rolled around it, it just wouldn't get in my head! Irritating.\n\nThe run after this debacle is less technical, but still raking. If you don't get into the flow, technical sections are extra difficult because you brake more than necessary and that makes it extra difficult. I know this trail, have ridden it several times without any problems….\n\nAfter all that earlier raking we arrive at a beautiful technical bike park descent. There is a lot of fun factor with many small drops, numerous high smooth roots and relatively steep. Are you going to rake on this descent? Then you are almost guaranteed to fall!\n\nKeep breathing on the trails\n\nOnce I have broken in, talking to myself, I promise myself to focus again on what we are training on. Throw the bike into the bend with confidence, see where you want to go and don't want to take out too much speed unnecessarily to achieve misplaced security. It functions! Gradually the flow and confidence returns. Improving your basic technique is now something I can get back to, these descents are great!\n\nRiding new trails in Solingen\n\nWe continue the day with a number of new trails, completely in the mud but no less tasty. Here too, using the right technique, you can let the bike roll wonderfully through the bends and find the flow!\n\nTo maintain the good feeling, we do the 2 most beautiful descents again, through a small loop we return to the bike park-like descent, past the rocks where Nico fell for a revenge and the wonderful flowy race descent that runs along the road and ends up at the bus 😀 The OFFDAY was an absolute TOP DAY!\n\nMore bike park and trail park information Germany\n\nWe gave ourselves time to drive to this region for 2 days. Day 1 takes place in Winterberg and then continues to Willingen in the evening. We won't tell you too much about Winterberg, most people know it 😉 Willingen, on the other hand, is less known and that is perhaps completely unjustified!\n\nAfter a day of playing in Winterberg we arrive in Willingen. Nico has selected the campsite, which in itself is something very special... But still, a great job! We are at a camper campsite, no shower, the rest is fine. What we don't fully realize upon arrival is that we are literally looking forward to the descents. Willingen is beautiful, quiet and has a very “Alpine” feel. First of all, there is a gondola instead of a chair lift. This gondola first takes you over all kinds of beautiful green fields as you often see in the Alps. Furthermore, it is quieter, Winterberg is much more commercial and much busier. Everything is well and neatly maintained and that really appeals to us.\n\nThe trails of Willingen\n\nOf course, a beautifully maintained lift station and green meadows are nice, but it's all about the trails! Today it is foggy at the top, when we reach the top we see some signs pointing to the right, but we do not find any follow-up. There should also be a downhill track. Nothing to find at all. We ask the man at the gondola and he tells us that they start at the other lift station. The fog prevents us from any kind of view so we decide to drive down a random path until we pass under the other elevator. A!! Then we have to find something here.\n\nThere are several trails here, 2 beginners trails, 1 a more flow line and the Enduro trail. The beginners trails are semi-paved trails with many bends and small tables. The Flow trail is the same, but the tables and bends are a bit higher or sharper. There are also some short Northshore sections with some drops at the end. Not a big spectacle but still very fun for the novice “Enduro/downhill” rider. What we care about is the Enduro trail!\n\nThe Downhill Track of WIllingen bike park\n\nOn the other side of the gondola (left as seen from the valley) is the Willingen downhill track. You start on a kind of starting hill and are immediately treated to a stone drop. Not something to worry about, so we'll roll it in. We know that the downhill track also contains gaps and doubles, so the first descent is about finding out what to ride and what not to ride. You see stones everywhere without being able to see what is behind them. Much of it is easy to drive and what is striking is that there are numerous choices. Even though it is officially only 1 trail, you can combine endlessly here. It is rocky with some steeper parts interspersed! And for the really big boys or girls there are the road gaps and high jumps.\n\nAll in all, we have quite fallen in love with Willingen. It is beautiful, as mentioned, it reminds us of the Alps and that quickly makes up for it! Is Willingen a better alternative to Winterberg? No, more of a good combination, if you go that way for 2 days then we would always go for the combination.\n\nMore information bike park Willingen\n\nMore Winterberg bike park information\n\nMore bike park and trail park information in Germany\n\nTrail hunt in the Valkenburg region\n\nValkenburg is located exactly between Maastricht and Heerlen. Just below the A79 in South Limburg. Cyclists are often familiar with this area, they come here in hordes to climb the Cauberg because of the modest summit at 134 meters height... Not really a story to tell outside the Netherlands 😉 But that's not what we came for.\n\nBerg and Terblijt\n\nBerg en Terblijt is located to the left of Valkenburg. We park the cars there and immediately see the potential of the region. There is a difference in height and nature all around us! The region has (as we note) a lot of old mining. We discovered this region through the Shimano Test Center with the Discovery mountain bike trail. A cyclocross competition often takes place here, which means that there is a lot of cycling here.\n\nWe largely follow the regular route and follow the dotted line of our GPS units left and right. We find something, but not really what we were looking for. A nice mini-piece here and there, that's it.\n\nValkenburg\n\nOnce we have crossed to the other side of Berg en Terblijt, towards Valkenburg, we find a bizarre kind of bike park. It all looks “fragilely” built. A real local spot. Today it is very slippery and we decide not to destroy the spot. We check the jumps left and right and continue our search. Every now and then we come across a funny staircase that you can drive down, but our trail hearts are not yet completely satisfied. Somewhere at the top with a view of the Geul we have a choice of left and right. On the left we arrive back at the climb we were just on and on the right leads us in the direction of the Shimano Test Center. Hmmm difficult... I choose to be the only E-biker today to quickly explore the left before sending the three non-E-bikers down a boring descent (and then climbing again in a boring way). That was a good thing! This turned out to be the best descent up to that point and later also the best! At least, certainly the nicest 😉\n\nFurthermore (but it may just be us) we thought it was 'meh, meh, so so'. I can imagine if you come from a region where there is no height difference at all, that this is a lot of fun. But it is better to drive a little further; At the Drielandenpunt you can find much more challenge.\n\nWas it nothing at all? Not that; we had a wonderful day on the bike. We had a nice slide and we laughed. By the way, Paul is still standing at that gate 😀\n\nIt is also good for all our fellow mountain bikers to show that not every day is a good day. Sometimes you simply feel less comfortable on your bike, which makes exciting sections more exciting than normal. Last time I had already encountered a steep section of trail here in the Drielandenpunt that I did not dare to tackle in the icy conditions (\"I\" is Rik by the way. Nico does not know this emotion...) So today it was time to nail it. Unfortunately, after being hit many times, it was not driven. The stupid thing is that I have ridden steeper things before, but this one is now in the \"mindfuck\" category for me and I'll have to figure it out again. After some motivating chicken sounds, I took the “chickenway” and cycled further... This will now be my personal challenge for 2021.\n\nNico, on the other hand – as mentioned – does not know this emotion. Last time he rode a next level piece under icy conditions. Really next level. He crashed. So now it's time for revenge! Check out the video to see if he nailed it this time!"
