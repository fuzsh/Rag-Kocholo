        "text": "The rapidly collapsing glacial systems of the Alps produced a large number of melt-water lakes and mires after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) in the Late Glacial period. The Rhone-Aare-glacier system gave rise to large moorlands and lakes in the region of the Three Lakes Region of Western Switzerland. When moorlands are formed, they are efficient sinks of atmospheric carbon, but when transformed to agricultural land they are significant C sources. In addition, mires can be used as archives for reconstructing landscape evolution. We explored in more detail the dynamics of the landscape of the Three Lakes Region with a particular focus on the formation and degradation of mires. The Bernese part of the Three Lakes Region developed to become—after the optimisation of the water-levels of the Swiss Jura—the vegetable belt of Switzerland. The situation for agriculture, however, has now become critical due to an overexploitation of the peatland. Until c. 13 ka BP the entire region was hydro...\n\nBecause of their extreme environment and vulnerability, mires are well able to reflect the ongoing climate change. Northern mires are presently being studied intensively from this point of view. But little is known about the effect of climate change on peatlands in temperate zone. Monitoring of mires in sensitive montane regions of continental Europe can provide valuable information in this regard. This article uses more than 10 years of data from our monitoring to show hydrological and vegetation changes in well-preserved mountain mires. Primary attention has been paid to mire hydrology, especially the water table and its fluctuations, and vegetation, as they are among the key drivers for carbon cycling and ecological processes in peatlands. The results presented reveal a decreasing mean water table level in the studied mires, particularly in ombrotrophic bogs where their distinct microtopographic features show different responses. Minerotrophic fens well supplied by upwelling groundwater present a more hydrologically stable picture. Changes in mire vegetation were also found, the most significant shifts recorded being among wet microtopographic features related to open bog expanses (sedge hollows, lawns). For example, the cover of Warnstorfia fluitans and sedges (mainly Carex limosa) was considerably reduced. In contrast, the vegetation of hummocks (representing the drier end of the moisture gradient) proved to be relatively stable, including the species composition of Sphagnum mosses.\n\nIn spite of the worldwide largest proportional loss of mires, Europe is a continent with important mire diversity. This article analyses the condition and protection status of European mire ecosystems. The overview is based on the system of European mire regions, representing regional variety and ecosystem biodiversity. We combined peatland distribution data with land cover maps of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service as well as with the World Database on Protected Areas to assess the extent of degraded peatlands and the proportion of peatlands located in protected areas in each European mire region. The total proportion of degraded peatlands in Europe is 25%; within the EU it is 50% (120,000 km2). The proportion of degradation clearly increases from north to south, as does the proportion of peatlands located within protected areas. In more than half of Europe’s mire regions, the target of at least 17% of the area located in protected areas is not met with respect to peatlands. Da..."
