        "text": "Overview\n\nSwitzerland's first biosphere reserve offers natural beauty at its finest. Seemingly endless moors, craggy karst formations and wild unbridled mountain streams provide unique experiences and views.\n\nHardly any other region in Switzerland possesses as many natural treasures as does Lucerne's \"Wild West\". Switzerland's most extensive and numerous moorlands are found here as are a flora and fauna of (inter)national importance. It is no wonder that Entlebuch was designated by UNESCO as the first biosphere reserve in Switzerland. Within the worldwide network of biosphere reserves, Entlebuch represents pre-Alpine moorland and karst landscapes.\n\nOver an area of 400 square kilometres a mystical world unfolds with its promise of peace, inspiration and relaxation - unspoilt moorlands, idyllic Alpine pastures and the majestically towering Schrattenfluh make for experiences of a very special kind indeed.\n\nBut it is not only peace and relaxation in unspoilt nature that the UNESCO Biosphere Entlebuch offers. It also boasts a wide range of leisure activities. There is an enormous choice including the energy and fairytale trails, Kneipp facilities, mud baths, satellite-guided hiking and field trips. Even from a historical and cultural point of view, the region has much to offer - the ancient craft of charcoal burning in Romoos and the pilgrimage site of Heiligkreuz are just highlights of a visit to the largest book in the world."
