The Lucerne village is in the middle of the Entlebuch UNESCO Biosphere. Holidays here, at an altitude of 1,165 meters, are synonymous with immersion in pure natural surroundings. Sörenberg offers a diverse animal and plant world and, on top of this, there is nowhere else in Switzerland which offers such a wide variety of protected moors and marshes in such a small area as here. The family-friendly holiday area offers, relaxation, variety, and a range of attractive leisure opportunities.\n\nIn summer, the Brienz Rothorn mountain area is a fabulous, ‘off the beaten track’ walkers’ paradise! The highest mountain in the canton of Lucerne offers breath-taking views over the Eiger, Mönch and Jungfrau mountains. The marsh water park “Mooraculum” is full of surprises to discover around the Moors theme. Whether you are watching, smelling, feeling or tasting – you are guaranteed to use all your senses. Adventure is pre-programmed with the archery course, tobogganing or mini golf.\n\nIn the colder months, the snow-sure winter wonderland offers winter sports of all kinds. Sörenberg is the largest winter sports area in the canton of Lucerne with its 53 km of ski-runs. From skiing to freeride and cross-country and snow-shoe hiking or skating on the natural ice rink – everything is there!\n\nBy car: From Lucerne-Wolhusen-Schüpfheim or from Bern-Langnau-Schüpfheim, then towards Sörenberg. The panorama road (from the Brünig side) from Giswil to Sörenberg is only open in summer. In Sörenberg through the village, turn left after the police station (in front of the petrol station), then take the first left again.\n\nBy train: SBB to Schüpfheim. Continue by post bus Klusstalden-Flüehli- Sörenberg, 10 minutes walk from the \"Post\" stop up Rothornstrasse towards the police station. Turn left before the petrol station, then left again on the first little road."
