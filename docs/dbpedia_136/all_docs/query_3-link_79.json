        "text": "In our modern lives, so many things have become instant. Wanna watch a movie? There's a bunch to choose from on Netflix. Wanna a quick bite? Pop something in the microwave and 4 minutes later - voila! Wanna talk to someone? Give them a call, text, or even see them with Skype. Wanna buy something? Hop on Amazon and a couple clicks later it's yours.\n\nBut isn't there something magical about anticipation. Remember those childhood memories at Christmas time putting up the tree, writing your letter to Santa and anticipating all those gifts! Remember looking forward to your birthday and to a summer vacation?\n\nI picked up this fun book called \"A Book That Takes It's Time: An Unhurried Adventure in Creative Mindfulness\" by Irene Smit and Astrid van der Hulst. Inside Lisette Thooft talks about CELEBRATING THE WAIT. She reveals that \"Things and experiences gain value when you have to wait for them,\" and \"Instant gratification makes them worth less.\" And the book goes on to state: \"Because of ubiquitous instant gratification, something paradoxal happened in our society. Because we have so little time to long for something, there is a kind of restlessness in our lives which leads us to enjoy ourselves less. If you always get everything you want right away, you're constantly on the treadmill of dissatisfaction, always on the lookout for the next product, the next set of new clothes, the next new gadget, without ever reaching the stage of quiet enjoyment and being satisfied with what you have.\"\n\nAnd isn't this a wonderful discovery that can apply to travel. It means that the travel planning and the travel exploration process can be a wonderful way to extend your joy and build up anticipation for your next trip - plus you get to learn a lot and find those secret hidden spots to check out along the way.\n\nIn the spirit of helping you get excited for your next trip to Switzerland and increasing your joy, here are the essential 5 books and guides I highly recommend to help you plan your perfect trip and learn more about beautiful Switzerland.\n\nCelebrate the Wait with These 5 Books\n\nYes, that's right! Once again, Switzerland has been named world's best country according to the the annual Best Country Rankings, which looks at people's perceptions of 80 countries around the world. While I keep saying this country is one very special place, it's nice to have a survey as proof of why Switzerland needs to be on the top of your list. I certainly think it's the best country in the world, and I'm glad that I'm not the only one who thinks so.\n\nIf you are looking for the most impressive view in the Swiss Alps, you will most certainly find it in the canton of Graub√ºnden at the summit of the Arosa Rothorn. This beautiful mountain is the highest of the Plessur Alps and located in eastern Switzerland.\n\nI've ridden quite a few Gondolas in Switzerland and I've seen some very impressive views, but I have to say the Rothorn is my favorite and offers the most breathtaking vantage point of the alps. At the summit, there are thousands of peaks visible in all directions. You are surrounded on all sides with mountain after mountain with no end in sight. If you didn't know any better, you would think the mountain range goes on forever.\n\nWith so many beautiful cities in Switzerland, it's hard to choose just one. But of the ones that I have seen, Bern has drawn me in and might just be my favorite. It's not hard to see why the medieval old town has been named a UNESCO world heritage site. The stunning town is encircled by the river Aare and boasts being the location of the federal parliament building (Bern is also the capital of Switzerland). In addition, the Altstadt (old town) has a beautiful and iconic clock tower, beautiful architecture, great restaurants and shopping, and so much more.\n\n1. Check out the Famous Bern Clock Tower\n\nTime your visit to the Bern Clocktower to the top of the hour and witness the sounds and movements of Bern's most recognizable landmark. The Zytglogge or Clock Tower was built in the early 13th century and has served the city as a guard tower, clock tower, center of urban life and a civic memorial."
