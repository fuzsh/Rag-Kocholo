        "text": "Historical background\n\nThe first species of Western Tethyan Eocene Heterostegina was described from the Helvetic nappes of Switzerland by Rütimeyer (1850) as “reticulata”, then by Kaufmann (1867) as “helvetica”. More details can be found in Herb (1978), who investigated these forms from their supposed type localities and assumed synonymy, preserving the name “reticulata” as having priority.\n\nBieda (1949) created the genus Grzybowskia for Eocene forms of the Polish Carpathians. Its diagnostic feature is the rhombic-hexagonal shape of secondary chamberlets differing from the regular, rectangular chamberlets of Heterostegina. The type of the new genus was his new species, G. multifida. Later he (Bieda 1957, 1963) described both “multifida” and “reticulata” as belonging to Grzybowskia. Köhler (1967) first suggested that these forms originated from involute Operculina.\n\nThe name Grzybowskia was widely used until Hottinger (1977) put them back into the genus Heterostegina, arguing that the generic features of Grzybowskia fall into the variation field of Heterostegina depressa, the type species. Hottinger (1977) gave also the currently used definition of Heterostegina and after a preliminary study (Hottinger 1964) proposed two parallel evolutionary lineages for involute forms, both having originated in the late Eocene. However, the establishment of these lineages (differing from each other in the tightness of the spire and in the density of subsequent chambers) is purely typological; moreover, the figured examples are coming from geographically remote areas. On the other hand, Hottinger (1977) clearly distinguished Heterostegina from involute Operculina (O. bericensis, O. roselli, O. gomezi) having sometimes randomly spaced secondary chamberlets with frequently incomplete secondary septa. These “anasteginid” forms could be observed in Spain in the same thanatocenosis with O. gomezi and, therefore were interpreted as intraspecific variations of the latter.\n\nHerb (1978) revised Heterostegina from the Helvetic nappes of Switzerland and compared them with forms found in the Priabonian sections of Mossano and Possagno (Northern Italy). He found that in the Swiss localities a transition can be observed from involute Operculina (called O. bericensis) through anasteginid O. gomezi to real Heterostegina, first with numerous then with ever fewer operculinid chambers. This evolution could be followed in Mossano and Possagno where a more advanced form was found with a much reduced operculinid part. Herb put these forms of Heterostegina into a phylogenetic lineage called H. reticulata (corresponding to Hottinger's H. helvetica), starting with H. reticulata multifida, followed by H. r. reticulata and terminating with H. r. italica, a new taxon found in the material from Possagno. From the same sample he described a new species, H. gracilis (corresponding to Hottinger's H. reticulata), with granules on the surface of the test and having a more open spiral and more densely spaced subsequent chambers as compared to the H. reticulata lineage. In establishing this lineage, Herb (1978) was the first who—though in a typological basement—recognized the nepionic acceleration as driving the evolution of Eocene Heterostegina. From a stratigraphical point of view, he suggested that real Heterostegina appeared only in the Priabonian.\n\nThis idea was widely accepted: Bieda (1963) and Köhler (1967) believed that large-sized Nummulites (of the “perforatus” and “millecaput” groups) survived in the Northern Carpathians until the early Priabonian because they occur there together with Heterostegina. This phenomenon can be explained by the frequent reworking of different faunas in turbidite sediments. However, the co-occurrence of large-sized Nummulites and Heterostegina is also well known from Armenia (Krashenninikov et al. 1985; Grigoryan 1986), where the sedimentation is said to be free from turbidites. Grigoryan (1986) described and rather poorly figured two types of Heterostegina from sediments with large-sized Nummulites. She called one of them Grzybowskia reticulata (co-occurring with Nummulites millecaput); the other she described as a new species, G. armenica. The latter is a really primitive form with irregularly arranged secondary chamberlets that often have incomplete secondary septa. It co-occurs with Nummulites gizehensis (or rather N. lyelli) and shows some similarities with anasteginid Operculina gomezi; at the same time, we have found that its proloculus is surprisingly large (see below).\n\nIn their revisional work, Banner and Hodgkinson (1991) used the term Heterostegina only for their “maturoevolute” forms. They called the involute forms with subrectangular chamberlets Heterostegina (Vlerkina) or Grzybowskia if chamberlets were polygonal. Both types occur in our material with a wide variety of intermediates (see details later), so we cannot apply their classification.\n\nThe work of Papazzoni and Sirotti (1993) provided a big step forward in two respects. In studying the Mossano section, they observed the co-occurrence of Heterostegina with Nummulites biedai (one of the end-members of the rather complicated N. perforatus-group) in beds that have never been attributed to the Priabonian. Their findings prove that the evolution of Eocene Heterostegina started in the latest middle Eocene. In addition, they were the first to study Heterostegina biometrically and to evaluate their results statistically. By comparing the statistical results of different parameters of Heterostegina from three populations from the Mossano section in superposition, they recognized not only the strong decrease of the number of operculinid chambers marking the nepionic acceleration, but also the increasing size of the two initial (embryonic) chambers.\n\nRomero et al. (1999) described Heterostegina from the Puig Aguilera section of the Igualada basin in NE Spain. On a typological basement, they distinguished two morphotypes wimin their H. reticulata, one with rather rhomboidal chamberlets and the other one with more regular, quadrangular to rectangular ones. Comparing their camera lucida drawings, the difference between the two morphotypes was not self-evident. The age of this profile was interpreted to be latest Bartonian despite of containing Pellatispira and Biplanispira, two genera that have never been previously reported in such relatively old rocks. Nevertheless, our studies have confirmed the latest Bartonian age of the Pellatispira-beds in Puig Aguilera (see below).\n\nThe recent papers of Stockar (1999), Less and Papazzoni (2000), and Less et al. (2000)—as more or less forerunners of our paper—are all based on statistically evaluated biometric studies. We build upon their main results. The main question we are addressing is whether Western Tethyan Eocene involute Heterostegina form one single lineage or multiple lineages. Thus, it is necessary to investigate the rate and stability of evolution within the lineage(s) to obtain a reasonable tool for characterizing larger foraminiferal events around the middle/late Eocene boundary.\n\nEvaluation of parameters\n\nThe presence/absence of granulation proved to be an excellent qualitative feature in order to distinguish Heterostegina gracilis with granules from H. reticulata (and also H. armenica) lacking them as stated by Herb (1978). Central piles are diagnostic for H. armenica and H. reticulata. No central pile is present in H. gracilis, with the exception of sample Possagno 1, where this feature, observed in several cases, can be interpreted as a somewhat primitive stage of the species (reflected also in the numerical parameters as described below). This observation allows us to refine the diagnosis of this species as compared to Herb's (1978) strict statement on their absence.\n\nThe statistical summary of biometrical data per population (Table 1) shows that the greatest differences between populations can be found in parameters X and S. Their mean values at the 95% confidence level are plotted in Fig. 9. Five important consequences can be deduced.\n\n(1) The populations of Heterostegina gracilis are clearly separate from those of H. reticulata and H. armenica using parameter S.\n\n(2) The populations of both H. reticulata and H. armenica form a continuous chain each.\n\n(3) The populations are arranged according to their associated, age-determining larger foraminiferal fauna. Those occurring with large-sized Nummulites (with test diameter of the B-forms over 15 mm) plot in the upper left quarter and in the centre of Fig. 9; those with neither large-sized Nummulites, nor Spiroclypeus in the centre; those with Spiroclypeus sirottii a little bit below and to the right of the centre. It is worth noting that the parameters of Heterostegina, as well as those of Spiroclypeus, are very consistent within populations. The Heterostegina populations occurring with Spiroclypeus carpaticus plot in the extreme lower right corner of Fig. 9.\n\n4. Populations from samples whose stratigraphic superposition can be directly observed in the field are arranged regularly in the plot, i.e., the “upper” populations can be found always below and to the right of the “lower” populations. These are the succession of samples Mossano 2, 3, 5+6, 7, and 9 in superposition, the couples of Possagno 1 and 2, Úrhida 1 and 3, 6 and 8, 7 and 9, and finally Keçili 3 and 11.\n\n5. Thus, the decrease of the number of operculinid chambers (X) and the increase of the number of chamberlets in chamber 14 (S) have a great stratigraphic significance.\n\nNevertheless, the bivariate plot of Fig. 9 does not help in separating Heterostegina armenica from H. reticulata. Therefore, in Fig. 10 we plotted the mean values of X against those of the size of the proloculus (P) by population, once again at the 95% confidence level. In this bivariate plot H. armenica is distinguished from H. reticulata despite the closeness of the population from Puig Aguilera to the H. armenica-cluster. Based on the quite regular arrangement of secondary chamberlets, however, this population clearly belongs to H. reticulata. At the same time, in this representation, the populations of H. gracilis are far less isolated from those of the most advanced H. reticulata than in Fig. 9.\n\nFrom Fig. 10 almost the same consequences can be deduced as from Fig. 9, e.g., the almost continuous chain of the H. reticulata-populations, the regularity of the arrangement of populations according to their larger foraminiferal associations and the more advanced evolutionary degree of the populations coming from the “upper” samples as compared to those from the “lower” samples.\n\nAt the same time, it is clear from Fig. 10 (and also from Table 1) that the general increase of the size of the proloculus (P) of the H. reticulata-chain is a far less rapid and reliable evolutionary trend than the change in X and S. This difference is even more valid for parameter d, the diameter of the first whorl, which is in strong positive correlation with P (see Table 1); however it can be measured less precisely. A good summary on the environmental and probably the biological control of the proloculus size of larger foraminifera with ample references can be found in Beavington-Penney and Racey (2004).\n\nThe least diagnostic numerical parameter is K, the index of spiral opening that shows a very slow and rather uncertain increase (i.e., the spiral tends to become looser in time) within the H. reticulata-chain. The existence of two simultaneously running evolutionary lineages in the Priabonian— one with tightly coiled and another one with loose spiral—suggested by Hottinger (1977) could not be proven, however, H. gracilis has indeed a significantly looser spire as compared to H. reticulata (see also Table 1). In general, there is a slight positive correlation between the size of the proloculus (P) and the laxity of the spiral.\n\nSince parameters d and K are shown to be not really relevant in distinguishing species and characterizing their evolution, they (together with the measurement of parameter D) turned out to be unnecessary.\n\nThe arrangement and shape of the secondary chamberlets change quite reliably. The most primitive type with a quite irregular arrangement of rhomboid chamberlets, often with incomplete septa, is characteristic for Heterostegina armenica, especially for H. a. armenica, the more primitive subspecies from Keçili 3 and Azatek. A continuously improving regularity in the arrangement of the chamberlets, accompanied by the change of the shape from rhomboid to almost rectangular, can be recognized during the evolutionary track of H. reticulata. Finally, regularly arranged delicate rectangular chamberlets are characteristic for H. gracilis.\n\nAs visible from the photos of Figs. 11–15, no increase in the size of the adult test can be observed during the whole heterosteginid evolution. Moreover, H. gracilis is definitively smaller than the late Bartonian forms. No difference in the test size could be observed between the A- and B-forms, either, although the latter were seldom found. Parameter X (defined as for the A-forms) could be counted in six microspheric specimens from different samples. These specimens suggest a trend to the reduction in the number of undivided chambers (Table 4) also for the microspheric forms.\n\nDiscussion\n\nCorrelation with other fossil groups.—In order to calibrate chronostratigraphically the heterosteginid succession described above we have to correlate them with different fossil groups. In Table 7 we summarize the co-existence data discussed in detail at the description of particular localities. The Assilina schwageri—alpina and Operculina roselli—gomezi groups are not considered here because their successive taxa (said to be age-dependant) are still separated on a highly subjective typological basis.\n\nAccording to Table 7 the boundary between the P 14 and 15 Planktic Foraminiferal Zones can be placed into the interval between the ranges of Heterostegina armenica armenica and H. reticulata multifida. Data from Azatek can be taken into account only with great uncertainty because the redeposition of the larger foraminiferal assemblage cannot be excluded in this case. The boundary between zones P 15 and 16 seems to be close to the boundary of H. reticulata mossanensis and H. r. italica.\n\nThe lower boundary of the NP 18 Calcareous Nannoplankton Zone is highly uncertain in the shallow benthic scale because the data from Azatek are again problematic. Therefore, based on the data from Biralu and Vedi (Krashenninikov et al. 1985), we can only say that the stratigraphical range of H. reticulata helvetica and H. r. reticulata belong to NP 18. The NP 18/19 boundary is somewhat lower than the limit between H. r. mossanensis and H. r. italica whereas the lower boundary of NP 20 (if this zone can be separated from NP 19 at all) nearly coincides with the appearance of H. gracilis.\n\nThe OZ 14 Orthophragminid Zone corresponds to the whole range of Heterostegina armenica and to almost the whole duration of H. reticulata except of H. r. italica. Its lower boundary nearly coincides with the appearance of H. armenica as shown by Özcan et al. (2007) while the upper limit (characterized by the disappearance of orthophragmines of middle Eocene acme such as Discocyclina pratti, Nemkovella strophiolata, Asterocyclina alticostata, and A. kecskemetii) corresponds approximately to the boundary between H. reticulata mossanensis and H. r. italica. The highest occurrence of Discocyclina discus (thought to have become extinct just before the Bartonian/Priabonian boundary) has been found in sample Úrhida 7 together with H. r. helvetica. The correlation of the OZ 15 and 16 zones with the heterosteginid succession is to be studied further.\n\nThe first occurrence of Spiroclypeus (represented by the less advanced S. sirottii sp. nov. described by Less and Özcan 2008) coincides with the first appearance of H. reticulata mossanensis in four localities (Mossano, Verona, Úrhida, and Şarköy) that suggests the simultaneity of this event on the geological time scale. Spiroclypeus sirottii is replaced by the more developed S. carpaticus (in Biarritz, Lou Cachaou by S. aff. carpaticus) nearly simultaneously with the first appearance of Heterostegina gracilis.\n\nThe evolution of the Nummulites fabianii-linesage can also be followed in the heterosteginid evolutionary scale. As mentioned in the description of the Keçili section, N. garganicus (with a mean proloculus diameter below 140 µm) is found together with Operculina ex. gr. roselli—gomezi below the first appearance of Heterostegina armenica. The latter is associated with N. hormoensis (= N. “ptukhiani” by Papazzoni 1998; mean proloculus diameter between 140 and 200 µm) that can be followed until the first appearance of H. reticulata mossanensis, when it is replaced by N. fabianii (with a mean proloculus diameter between 200 and 300 µm). According to our current studies (Less et al. 2006; and unpublished data), this latter species can be followed into the lower Oligocene without involute Heterostegina. Meanwhile the flatter N. fabianii (formerly N. retiatus), having adapted to somewhat deeper outer shelf environments, can only be found in the upper part of the Priabonian together with Spiroclypeus carpaticus.\n\nThe extinction of large-sized Nummulites as correlated with the heterosteginid evolution is the most complicated and therefore most interesting story because it seems to be geographically controlled. In SW Europe the extinction level corresponds approximately to the boundary between Heterostegina reticulata hungarica and H. r. multifida because N. ex. gr. perforatus has been found in Siest (SW Aquitaine) with the first of them while the Puig Aguilera sample (NE Spain) containing H. r. multifida lacks large-sized Nummulites.\n\nIn N Italy the extinction level can be placed at about the boundary of H. reticulata multifida and H. r. helvetica since according to Papazzoni and Sirotti (1995) the highest occurrence of N. biedai corresponds approximately to the level of samples Mossano 2 and Verona, Monte Cavro 4.\n\nIn Úrhida (Hungary) the last representatives of N. ex. gr. millecaput—maximus can be rarely found in sample Úrhida 8 with H. reticulata helvetica. In all the lower samples (Úrhida 1–3 and 4–7 with H. r. hungarica and H. r. helvetica, respectively) these Nummulites are abundant whereas in the higher samples (in Úrhida 9 and 10 with H. r. reticulata and H. r. mossanensis, respectively) they are completely missing. Thus, the extinction level in Úrhida nearly coincides with the boundary between H. reticulata helvetica and H. r. reticulata.\n\nIn Armenia a recognizable horizon, 2–10 m in thickness, with abundant Nummulites ex. gr. millecaput—maximus can be followed in several profiles (Vedi, Shagap, and Biralu). Above this bed large-sized Nummulites occur rarely. Based on the critical evaluation of the description of these profiles by Krashenninikov et al. (1985) and also on our experience from Keçili (eastern Anatolia) we suppose that above the “millecaput” level of Armenia, all the large-sized Nummulites are redeposited. According to our studies the “millecaput” level contains Heterostegina reticulata helvetica in the Biralu and H. r. reticulata in the Vedi profile; thus, the extinction level of large-sized Nummulites in Armenia may correspond to the boundary between H. r. reticulata and H. r. mossanensis. It is worth noting that Nummulites fabianii reported by Krashenninikov et al. (1985) and by Grigoryan (1986) from the “millecaput” beds of Vedi (according to our new, unpublished results) turned out to be N. hormoensis (defined as explained above).\n\nThe eastward migration of the extinction level of largesized Nummulites described above is based on data from only four geographical regions. Therefore we may consider this as a working hypothesis.\n\nThe middle/late Eocene boundary on the heterosteginid evolutionary scale.—There is no general agreement on the exact location of the middle/late Eocene boundary in the different geological time scales), although everybody (Krashenninikov and Ptukhian 1986; Strougo 1992; Berggren et al. 1995; Papazzoni and Sirotti 1995; Serra-Kiel et al. 1998; Sztrákos and Castelltort 2001; Gradstein et al. 2004) agrees that it corresponds to the limit of the Bartonian and Priabonian stages.\n\nTo ensure world-wide correlation, experts on planktic fossils are inclined to put the boundary either onto the base of the P 15 (Globigerinatheka semiinvoluta) Planktic Foraminiferal Zone (Toumarkine and Bolli 1975; Krashenninikov and Ptukhian 1986; Strougo 1992; Sztrákos et al. 1998; Sztrákos and Castelltort 2001) or at the base of the NP 18 (Chiasmolithus oamaruensis) Calcareous Nannoplankton Zone (Berggren et al. 1995). However, there is no agreement in the succession of these two events (Sztrákos and Castelltort 2001). According to Cita (1975), Krashenninikov and Ptukhian (1986), Strougo (1992), Mathelin and Sztrákos (1993) and Sztrákos et al. (1998,) the base of the NP 18 Zone is older than that of the P 15 Zone, while Cañudo et al. (1988) and Berggren et al. (1995) indicate a reverse order between them. Sztrákos and Castelltort (2001) suggest that the first appearance of Chiasmolithus oamaruensis is more heterochronous than that of the Globigerinatheka semiinvoluta, and therefore the latter has to be preferred in marking the middle/late Eocene boundary.\n\nIf we accept this opinion, the Bartonian/Priabonian boundary will nearly coincide with the first appearance of Heterostegina reticulata, thus several sites—containing large-sized Nummulites and traditionally assigned to the middle Eocene (Siest, Mossano 2, Úrhida 1–8)—have to be put into the Priabonian. The other disadvantage of this solution is that the lower limit of the Priabonian is not linked to the stratotype or to a nearby section that can be correlated with it.\n\nThese two disadvantages are eliminated by the experts on larger foraminifera (Papazzoni and Sirotti 1995; Serra-Kiel et al. 1998; Bassi et al. 2000), who define the lower limit of the Priabonian as the lower boundary of the SBZ 19 Zone. It is defined by the first appearance of Nummulites fabianii and of the genus Spiroclypeus as the most important markers. The most suitable profile to locate this boundary is the Mossano section where below the above mentioned first appearances (corresponding to the base of the Marne di Priabona), the disappearance of large-sized Nummulites and that of N. hormoensis (marking the top of SBZ 18) can also be studied. Moreover, the lower boundary of the SBZ 19 coincides with the base of the Marne di Priabona that allows correlating with the stratotype in Priabona and marks a regional transgression. The main disadvantage of locating the middle/upper Eocene boundary in the Mossano section is that larger foraminifera are chosen as the main tool in the correlation of this boundary. According to Luciani et al. (2002), the base of the Marne di Priabona corresponds very probably to the upper part of both the P 15 and NP 18 zones, which makes the world-wide correlation rather difficult.\n\nTable 7.\n\nAssemblages of different fossil groups co-occurring with Heterostegina from particular localities that are ranged among shallow benthic subdivisions. Abbreviations: ↑, above; ?, dubious occurrence.\n\nFurther efforts (magnetostratigraphical studies, investigation of stable isotopes or other methods to be introduced in the future) will likely solve the worldwide correlation of the Bartonian/Priabonian boundary. In the meantime, the exceptionally rapid evolution of heterosteginids in the vicinity of this limit already ensures its regional correlation in the Western Tethys. Therefore, in this paper we correlate the middle/late Eocene boundary with the base of the SBZ 19 Shallow Benthic Zone marked by the first appearance of the genus Spiroclypeus and by the substitution of Heterostegina reticulata reticulata by H. r. mossanensis and of Nummulites hormoensis by N. fabianii. All three events can be detected easily because the genus Spiroclypeus can be distinguished typologically from all the other genera without any difficulties and the changes within both evolutionary lineages are biometrically defined. In the case of the Nummulites fabianii lineage, the two crucial taxa are separated by the 220 µm limit of the mean outer diameter of the proloculus along the main axis (Papazzoni 1998) or by the 200 µm limit of its inner cross-diameter (Less et al. 2006; and unpublished data).\n\nOur investigations confirmed the very close synchronicity of the first appearance of the genus Spiroclypeus by demonstrating the co-occurrence of its less advanced evolutionary stage (Spiroclypeus sirottii sp. nov. described by Less and Özcan 2008) with Heterostegina reticulata mossanensis in four different localities from three quite remote areas (North Italy: Mossano and Verona; Hungary: Úrhida; NW Turkey: Şarköy). Nummulites hormoensis is associated with H. reticulata reticulata in sample Mossano 3 (and is found also in Mossano 4, still below the Marne di Priabona) and Vedi (Armenia), meanwhile N. fabianii co-occurs with H. reticulata mossanensis in sample Verona, hairpin bend.\n\nOur studies on Heterostegina demonstrated also the favorable conditions of the Mossano section to mark here the Bartonian/Priabonian boundary at the base of the Marne di Priabona since two successive evolutionary stages, H. reticulata reticulata (from sample Mossano 3) and H. r. mossanensis (in samples Mossano 5 and 6) have been found on opposite sides of the boundary, stratigraphically separated by about 10 m. This means that no serious hiatus can be expected between the top of the Calcari nummulitici (terminating the SBZ 18) and the base of the Marne di Priabona marking the base of the SBZ 19, thus the profile is nearly continuous through this boundary. This, together with the very good accessibility and outcropping conditions and with the extensive literature dealing with it, makes the Mossano section almost ideal for fixing the middle/upper Eocene boundary at the base of the Marne di Priabona in this profile.\n\nRefinement of the shallow benthic zonation.—It is clear from the above discussion and can be read from Table 7, too, that there are no serious contradictions between the heterosteginid evolutionary succession and those of the other fossil groups. Moreover, the biostratigraphic resolution power of the Heterostegina lineages seems to be the highest of all in the vicinity of the middle/late Eocene boundary. Therefore, the SBZ 18 and 19 zones can be refined and subdivided into subzones. Since the tight connection of the evolution of the H. reticulata-lineage with time has not yet been shown, for the time being we define these subzones with caution, and propose only three ones for SBZ 18 (A to C) and two for SBZ 19 (A and B), respectively. The three subzones of the late Bartonian SBZ 18 are defined as follows.\n\nTable 8.\n\nUpdated range-chart for some late Lutetian to early Rupelian larger benthic foraminiferal taxa of the Western Tethys. The subdivision of the stratigraphic scale is not time-proportional.\n\nSubzone SBZ 18 A (early late Bartonian) is characterized by the interval between the first occurrence (FO) of Nummulites biedai, N. cyrenaicus, N. vicaryi, N. boulangeri, and Heterostegina armenica and the FO of H. reticulata. Subzone SBZ 18 B (middle late Bartonian) is defined by the joint biostratigraphic range of H. reticulata tronensis and H. r. hungarica in succession while SBZ 18 C (latest Bartonian) is characterized by the Joint biostratigraphic range of subsequent Heterostegina reticulata multifida, H. r. helvetica, and H. r. reticulata.\n\nSubzone SBZ 19 A (earliest Priabonian) corresponds to the biostratigraphic range of H. reticulata mossanensis while SBZ 19 B (late early Priabonian) is defined by the joint occurrence of H. reticulata italica and Spiroclypeus sirottii Less and and Özcan, 2008 (described and defined as Xmean>2.7 in Less and Özcan (2008); with the same parameter X as in this paper).\n\nThe definition of SBZ 20 (late Priabonian) by Serra-Kiel et al. (1998) is completed by adding the biostratigraphic range of Spiroclypeus carpaticus (with Xmean>2.7 as defined in Less and Özcan 2008). H. reticulata italica also occurs in this zone.\n\nThe ranges of most important Bartonian—Priabonian larger foraminiferal taxa in the modified shallow benthic scale are shown in Table 8.\n\nThe relationship of Eocene and Oligocene involute Heterostegina.—Involute Heterostegina are unknown so far from the Rupelian (SBZ 21–22A) of the Western Tethys (Cahuzac and Poignant 1997). The Chattian (SBZ 22B–23) representatives (Turkey: Henson 1937, our unpublished data; Israel: Hottinger 1977; SW Aquitaine: Butt 1966, Cahuzac and Poignant 1997; N Spain: Ferrández-Cañadell et al. 1999; and NE Hungary: Less 1991), are described usually under the name of “assilinoides” and supposed to be the descendants of the Eocene forms (Hottinger 1977).\n\nIn Figs. 16 and 17 we exhibit our data on Oligocene involute Heterostegina in the P–X and S–X bivariate plots. The figures correspond to the lower halves of Figs. 9 and 10 in plotting on them for comparison all the Priabonian and the latest Bartonian H. reticulata reticulata populations as well. The Oligocene population of Csókás 4 (SBZ 22B/23) corresponds to that of Less (1991), the Kelereşdere population (SBZ 22B according to our unpublished data) corresponds to samples 108–117 of that section in Sancay et al. (2006). Based on our unpublished data from the Western Taurides, the population of Bey-Daglari corresponds to the SBZ 22B zone, whereas Dazkiri A 7 to the basal part of the same zone. Finally, the locality of Ramleh (SBZ 22B) is described in Drooger (1986). In Fig. 18 we illustrate representative specimens from all the discussed Oligocene sites.\n\nFrom Figs. 16–18 it is clear that the population of Csókás 4 is different from all the other Oligocene populations, and therefore, represents a taxon, different from H. assilinoides whose type locality (Gaziantep region, southern Turkey) is much closer to the location of the other populations. According to Figs. 16 and 17 the Csókás 4 population does not fall into the continuation of the late Bartonian—Priabonian H. reticulata-chain and it is also quite remote from the populations of H. gracilis. Thus, for these Hungarian forms (together with those from N Spain, see Ferrández-Cañadell et al. 1999 and from SW Aquitaine, see Butt 1966 and Cahuzac and Poignant 1997) a new taxon should be introduced in the near future. As concerns the other four Oligocene populations identifiable with H. assilinoides, they seem to fall into the same cluster, which, however, cannot be considered as the continuation of either the H. reticulata-chain or H. gracilis. This is also clear from the photos in Fig. 18.\n\nThus, the Chattian Heterostegina do not appear to be the successors of the Eocene forms, moreover no Heterostegina are recorded from the (at least) Western Tethyan Rupelian. Therefore, we conclude that the Eocene branch of involute Heterostegina became extinct and their development is restricted to the late Bartonian to Priabonian time-span."
