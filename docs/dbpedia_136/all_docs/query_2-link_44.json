This track has many tricky turns that mostly cause your ship to scrape on walls. So, be cautious about turns, especially the S-curve. Two of the Skill-cuts in this track are overpasses and need piloting skills to access them. These overpasses are normally the only ones to pull off barrel rolls and trail of Speed Pads.\n\nMetro Park is one of the tracks that are mostly run on natural track materials. It's one of the beginner track with no sharp corners. Although sometimes, it may find this having tricks up it's sleeves. Watch out for Skill-cuts, one can only be accessed with the Turbo, and the other that may lead you to drown if not navigating properly.\n\nQueens Mall is the second track you race on since the start of the 2048 campaign. Not counting the Skill-cuts, this track doesn't have many tight curves or corners, so feel free to race clean, unless if there are weapon pads everywhere inside the mall and the last Skill-cut.\n\nCapital Reach features an old bridge that is still surprisingly standing for 165 years, but with some windmills on the top and trainlines. At first you race on the bridge, then you race under the bridge after the loops, then back up again.\n\nEmpire Climb is the first track where newcomers will be introduced to the world of Anti-Gravity Racing. The landmark in this track is the supertall skyscraper where racers climb up on the Mag-Strip then back down.\n\nRockway Stadium is a fairly technical track which has more 180-degree hairpin turns than any other track in the game. Therefore, be careful here, especially if you're piloting ships with low Handling rating, as they have greater risks of scraping on walls. This means that this track proves a challenge to navigate, especially in an attempt to score a perfect lap.\n\nDowntown is a big track set in the forest of buildings. This track is wide and a barrel roll happy place. There are so many ramps to launch in this track, so expect to have lots of airtime when racing in this track. As such, expect to get lots of barrel roll opportunities to pull off.\n\nSubway is set in the metro system of Nova State City, this track brings the racers into an intense race on the railways of the train station, over and under. This track is pretty technical, with lots of turns to tackle, though there are only a few tight ones. You'll be surprised with the Hot Wheels-eques Mag-Strip twirl (the first Skill-cut).\n\nSol is the craziest track ever built! Twists and turns and stuff all in one building. This track runs high in the skies of Nova State City. Watch out, because there are barely any barrier walls, making the racers prone to falling down as they are more likely to happen to fly off the track. So take it easy and be careful, as the lack of barrier walls could lead you to the drop of doom.\n\nAltima is the final track you're racing in the 2048 Campaign. Altima is one of the most difficult tracks ever built due to its mixture of switchbacks and terrains. Expect to go airborne for a long time as you jump off and down along the deep steep slope.\n\nWO1 Era[]\n\nDesigned by Stiggart Knurksson, who also put together the very first test track used to demonstrate anti-gravity craft in 2035, Altima VII is the first track known to the early Wipeout fans. Overall, it is not a difficult track. Notable sections include a drop into a tunnel after a long uphill run and a narrowing tunnel just before the finish line.\n\nKarbonis V is a scenic track set within a mountainous region of Japan. The early, tree-lined portion of the course leads into a 350 meter long tunnel. The tunnel exit is a the start of a dive surrounded by the mountains. Other distinguishing features include a series of jumps and a temple area, while towards the end, a series of rolling bends mimic the hilly surroundings.\n\nSet around a reservoir lake in the grassy hills of Schwarzwald in Germany, Terramax is a relatively difficult course and a step-up from the previous two tracks in the F3600 League, Altima VII and Karbonis V. Starting with a twisty run of hilly turns and a tight tunnel section, the course runs over a lake along a glass bridge before a long jump back into the hills. An industrial zone comprises the final section of the track, concluding with another long, high-speed jump.\n\nTaking place within a disused industrial area on the outskirts of Moscow, Korodera offers one of the bleakest settings in the original Wipeout game. The track itself is long at 5.4 km and takes a twisty course around the derelict buildings. Reasonably early on, a fork appears although in this case both the left and right paths are similar. Two sharp descending corkscrew sections and a huge jump are the other distinguishing features of this track. Much of the lap takes place at fairly low speeds apart from the final section which boasts many speed pads. This results in Korodera having longer lap times than its distance would suggest.\n\nArridos IV is located in the desert area of Monument Valley in Utah, USA. Initial turns and bumps give way to a long tunnel through a mine shaft, emerging into the daylight via a steep jump over the canyons. There is a split section with slightly differing alternate paths which cross halfway through. The remainder of the track includes a further steep drop and a long, twisting section that can be difficult to navigate. A final jump across the desert leads to the finish line.\n\nCarved into a glacier and surrounded by sharp blue walls, Silverstream is widely regarded as the most difficult track in the F3600 League and one of the hardest Wipeout tracks of all time. Ice plains and fir trees comprise much of the outdoor scenery, while there is an ice cave early on and portions in tunnel.\n\nFirestar is set on the rocky, dusty surface of Mars, making it the first track in the Wipeout series not located on Earth. The atmosphere is dramatic thanks to the dark orange scenery and skies. As at Silverstream, there is a split section almost immediately, the left route offering a simpler course with fewer speed pads than the right path. The split bears a resemblance to that at Arridos IV. The remainder of the course proceeds through a selection of open sections across the Martian surface broken up by indoor, man-made portions. There is also a brief canyon section.\n\nWO2097 Era[]\n\nTalon's Reach is the easiest track in Wipeout 2097, and it is generally the first track that beginners of the game will race on. But still, it's a good learning ground for new pilots with some variations in the track and some sharper corners to break the simple routine. A pilot can always come back here to learn something new or master a faster speed class. This track can even be easy on Phantom if the player knows how to use the airbrakes. Talon's Reach can give the player a chance to try out ships like Qirex on harder classes to get use to the airbrakes.\n\nSagarmatha may be slightly more technical than Talon's Reach, but it's nothing to fret over. The course does introduce you to tighter corners and sharp variations in the gradient reminiscent of the original Wipeout.\n\nDesigned by Gabriel Mancuso of the South American AG Federation and built between 2082-84, Valparaiso was the subject of huge environmental protests when it hosted its first competitive race - it cut through vast swathes of jungle deemed essential to the delicate balance of life on earth.\n\nPhenitia Park was a commercial business district on the outskirts of Hamburg, Germany. In order to win funding from the city leaders, the park's developers included an F3600 AG racing circuit in their plans, despite never having contacted the AG Race Commission about the proposal. Although the park proved a popular location for local businesses, the circuit itself remained dark for 7 years until the Commission finally agreed to hold races there if it could be upgraded to F5000 status. This was finally achieved under the direction of Dieter Schmidt, a Hamburg plumber and AG fan, and Phenitia Park became a hugely popular European race venue.\n\nBy the time Gare d'Europa was built in 2081, the disused French Metro system had fallen into the hands of a vast criminal underworld which existed entirely separate from legitimate society. The United Nations was eventually briefed to clear the criminals from the tunnels, and in a bid to bring life back to the network, the Gare d'Europa became France's first ever (and only) AG race circuit.\n\nOdessa Keys is the most hated track in Wipeout 2097, even for experienced players. There is a vast variety of corners in this track from a tightening chicane to a narrowing corner to a sharp uphill corner immediately after a jump. However, this track has the most punishing final corner: a VERY sharp right after a downhill stretch and a left kink. There's no chance a Qirex ship, at Phantom class, can clear this corner at full speed.\n\nVostok Island is a difficult track, and being the penultimate track for the Piranha Challenge, it has a reason to be there. It has many turns and splitting parts in the game. Some of them the player could not see thanks to some blinding turns. This requires on most of the turns to use the airbrakes, which would be very difficult to navigate with the Qirex craft. The track is one of few that has the pit road out side of the Start/Finish line. Vostok Island and Spilskinanke are the only two tracks that can be raced on the Venom speed class. They are also allowed on Flash, Rapier, Phantom & Zen.\n\nLike the other track, Spilskinanke is a very difficult track. The track is rather dark, has many turns that the player cannot see coming and has a few dive pads similar to Wipeout 3's Manor Top. However, unlike Manor Top (which is considered a very enjoyable race track), Spilskinanke is considered to be the hardest track in the game, harder than Odessa Keys and Vostok Island. It's even harder as you can race on this track in Venom, Flash, Rapier, Phantom & Zen classes until you complete the Piranha Challenge.\n\nWO64 Era[]\n\nAs with its donor track, Klies Bridge is the easiest and possibly the best looking course in the game. This course has no really hard turns, though navigating the snow tunnel, where the left-right bus stop section of Talon's Reach is, can be tricky if you don't have the track memorized.\n\nThe Race Commission approached us five years ago proposing an anti-gravity circuit down by our Qoron IV underwater research base. I couldn't believe what they were suggesting - I mean, just think about it. It's crazy. But they'd seen the small tunnel system we'd perfected, and they said pay for a big one. They wanted to build it well away from the base but that was no go. If they wanted our technology, we wanted the publicity. So we insisted they build it right by the base, and give it the same name too.\n\nThe Race Commission demanded an anti-gravity circuit through active volcanic territory and I had to get them a location. Remember, they're in competition with spectacular sports like Fire Ballet for Datacast bandwidth and they need serious background action. Sokana was ideal plenty of space for those famous speed curves. Seismic activity in the region is a problem, though we've never suffered fatalities amongst race crew or paying spectators. We lost a hospitality suite full of international dignitaries when a lava flow burst its channel, but I think they were mostly about to fall victim to revolution in any case.\n\nWelcome to Dyroness, another word for efficiently produced hydro-electric power. Electricity has never been so important, whether for powering a child's toy robot, an elderly citizen's electric carving knife, or light and heat for an entire nation. It's something we all rely on, and nowhere is it produced in finer surroundings than at Dyroness. Our hydro-electric complex also houses the Dyroness F5000 anti-gravity circuit, a rolling, sweeping masterpiece of engineering which brings us to the attention of millions of Data-cast viewers each year. Other hydro-electric complexes might make more electricity than us, but none of them do it with the style of Dyroness!\n\nThe design transmission pipes for Fat Fuel™. I believe Mr. Belmondo of the F5000 Race Commission had a Fat Fuel™ heat system installed and he thought the pipes looked really neat. He called me up that morning and asked me to design him a race track - I thought he was a psycho or something. But I did it anyway. Designed a real fast Machaon II circuit and they went and built it over in South America. And with the money they paid me, I walked straight out of that dump of a Fat Fuel(TM) office and never went back.\n\nTera Incorporated, the premier heavy industrial construction specialists in the Global Health Organization's 'High Pollutant' category, is delighted to be associated with F5000 Anti-Gravity Racing, the world's number one speed intensive sport. The company can confirm that after a lively and productive negotiating period, our largest current construction site will also house the Terafumos anti-gravity circuit, sure to become one of the most intense circuits in the race calendar. Tera Incorporated denies that the presence of its Chief Executive on the F5000 Sponsorship Committee has in any way influenced negotiations.\n\nVelocitar is relatively easy to navigate. The circuit starts off with two light turns to the right each with three speed pads to the left side, allowing for great speeds to be built up right out of the gate. Following that is a straightaway uphill that has an incredible concentration of speed pads on the left side of the track, leading blinding speeds for pilots that make use of them. This leads into a tunnel with even further speed pads. Out of the tunnel is a drop that curves to the right with even more large groups of speed pads on the way down.\n\nWO3 Era[]\n\nA nice relaxing way to start off the league, Porto Kora is a short and very straightforward course with only one odd tricky corner to test you. This course is built for pure speed, so the Icaras will have little trouble here.\n\nMega Mall is the 2nd track in Wipeout 3. It is one of the easiest tracks in the game. It starts with a few turns that needs attention for the airbrakes if the player is at Rapier or at Phantom. They would then travel to the infamous 540 degree turn downwards and then 1 more small turn before seeing a straight way with a pit lane. There would be a few more turns that makes the player return to the Start/Finish line.\n\nSampa Run is a dark track with a lot of undulations to destabilize the craft. There's also a few tunnels that will require you to slow down unless you want to kiss the ceiling. Plenty of heavy braking is needed here, you'll need to swing the craft about to keep it from bouncing.\n\nA lot of people hate Stanza Inter, but can be an enjoyable track if tackled properly. Very tricky at high speeds with lots of sharp corners and very few straight sections. This will really test your braking skills, and like Sampa Run, you'll need to swing the craft about to stop it from bouncing.\n\nHi-Fumii isn't quite as tricky as it first appears when you race it. Sure, it has some very sharp corners, but the approach to the majority of them is very favorable and will enable you to take this track at a fairly high speed. Just one narrow track section near the end that may cause some problems though.\n\nP-Mar Project is a notoriously difficult track for most racers especially on Phantom class and in a heavy craft. When you first glance at it, it doesn't seem that bad, but it will punish you later on in the lap needing accurate cornering so that you do just bounce around the walls of the circuit.\n\nThe penultimate track of the standard game, Manor Top is an enjoyable track that has tricky, yet unique turns that cannot be found in the other tracks in the game. It has a few tight turns, as well as 90 degree turns as players try to go from dive pad to dive pad. This track can be difficult for those who don't know how to use the airbrakes; but if they do master it, the true test is to use low turning crafts like Qirex, Goteki 45, and Icaras.\n\nA nice balanced track to finish the league, Terminal has pretty much everything. A long spiral, lots of sharp corners and two huge straights to finish on. The straights can actually be very difficult as everyone is a sitting duck and you'll get hit by quite a few weapons. There's also a tricky corner that can easily bounce you out if you don't approach it correctly.\n\nFusion Era[]\n\nThe US government is said to have increased income tax by around 7000 per cent in order to help finance the building of this circuit of Florion Height in the Nevada desert, and even then, its construction was dogged by tragedy. Dorian Nantucket was site foreman during the building phase, and he commented shortly after it opened, \"Good friends died out there in Nevada, and we were building that circuit not knowing whether it'd ever work! People tell me they ran out of money a year before we were done, and I can believe it 'cause I've never been paid, but when I see them racing out there now, it makes my head spin with pride.\"\n\nMandrashee is often called 'The Elemental', a reference to the elements of earth, air, fire and water which are represented at various points along the circuit. Built between a chain of islands, the circuit crosses volcanoes, cliffs and beaches in addition to exhilarating undersea areas. Natasha Belmondo, Xios International's star pilot, has commented, \"Ever since I was a little girl, I've been afraid of water. At Mandrashee, almost freeze with fear as we drop beneath the ocean, then there's such a kick of adrenaline as I realise I'm in a confined space surrounded by sea that I seem to fly even better than anywhere else. It's incredible.\"\n\nAs one of the Earth's few remaining ice zones, the Cubiss Float alpine region is subject to rigorous environmental protection. Vast atmospheric chilling tanks are embedded deep within the mountains and a United Nations Weather Watch station is always ready to reverse any increase in the average temperature. Run on a non-profit basis by the Swiss Committee for Peaceful Sporting Activity, the circuit is often threatened by terrorist groups and as Paul Burckhardt, Governor of Geneva, puts it, \"It is unfortunate that we have to use the most powerful anti-trespass mines ever made, as they are very unstable and tend to blow up unwary goat farmers. Just one of those things I guess.\"\n\nThe jungle landscape surrounding Alca Vexus gives a stunning backdrop to this much-loved circuit, a particular favorite of Wolfgang Van-Über, owner of Van-Über Racing Development. As he says, \"Perhaps it is the heady aroma of lush vegetation and exotic fruits that excites me. Perhaps it is the presence of Mayan temples, or the circuit's intriguing ballet through the trees. All I know is that when I pass through the passenger terminal at the Alca Vexus International Travel Port and browse the toiletry section of the duty-free store, I feel an irresistible frisson of excitement, and I know I am close to a primitive and vital ancient culture.\"\n\nBuilt on some of the most polluted and toxic regions in the world, Vohl Square passes the famous chemical vats of the Swollen Cossack brewery which exude clouds of choking gas, and the ageing generators owned by Sevvek Power, which sporadically short circuit in damp weather, threatening the lives of pilots and spectators alike. Vohl Square is the favored circuit of Omarr Khumala of Tigron Enterprises, who says, \"How they worship me when I take to that stinking grey circuit! As I wipe the grime from my visor, I realize no one else loves me like they do in Moscow. What a city.\"\n\nWith its fast straights and smooth bends, the inner circuit at Temtesh Bay is one of the League's simplest tracks; however, the two extensions which form the whole circuit add the fiendish curves of Beehive Rock and the confined mining tunnels recently vacated by ShellTec Extraction. Bruce Bloomer, the charismatic business tycoon who masterminded the track's construction, runs the circuit with a populist touch; \"Remember folks, it's HALF PRICE before 10am, with a free lollipop for the kids and a flagon of foaming ale for pa in 'The Convict's Welcome'. Plus, it's FREE to pensioners who buy their daily provisions from Bloomer's Bring And Buy convenience stores. Just tell 'em Bruce sent ya!\"\n\nBased on the moon, Katmoda 12 is a spectacular achievement of F9000 racing, and Pascale Rouser of Auricom has always loved the circuit: \"I was stunned the first time we went there. Imagine stepping out and seeing that small civilization spread out before you - the famous domes, the floating city, the alien remains. And beyond it and around it, Katmoda 12 snakes across our heavenly neighbor.\" Unfortunately, due to the high costs of lunar travel, few spectators make the journey, and crowds are made up of government officials, businessmen on hospitality weekends and pop celebrities such as Raisin Face or Git Boyz Thr3e.\n\nPure Era[]\n\nVineta K is situated at a beachside resort and marina on Makana Island. Being one of the easiest track in terms of complexity, this is a good track for beginner pilots to get accustomed to their crafts and to give the crowd a good show as the track winds around the beachfront properties, along the quays of the island, and even beneath the sea in the Plasma Shield aquatic tunnels.\n\nThis track is the second track in the Beta League. The most evil track since Silverstream. Citta Nuova is the ultimate technical course of Wipeout Pure, and will have you tearing your hair out for days trying to race it on Phantom. Aside from an extremely tight hairpin, there are also a series of undulating chicanes that can easily throw you over the side. The track intro says it all - fly with due care and attention.\n\nSituated on the sloped of Mount Sebenco, Sebenco Cl​imb winds its way up the narrow and winding Austen Pass before a steep plunge into a man-made tunnel at the bottom of the circuit. Because of the overall difficulty to complete the track cleanly, it is a well-loathed track.\n\nThe 4.4km Sol 2 circuit lies suspended a full kilometer above Makana. It's one of the fastest tracks in the games due to its high-speed straights and banked corners, but can get tricky at times, particularly with an long open-sided section. A track that demands respect from even the most skilled pilots.\n\nSebenco Peak is fairly technical. There aren't many fast sections here, and like Sebenco Climb, sharp corners are very common. Learn your airbrakes for this one. This is without doubt a much-loathed track.\n\nIridia is one of the fastest tracks of the Delta League, and is surprisingly wide in places. Lots of room to move also means little to hide behind, so most weapons coming your way are going to hit. Triakis and Tigron are ideal for this track, plenty of speed and you're more than likely to actually live through it. On Time Trial though, sit back and enjoy. There are a couple of sharp corners to keep your eyes open for though, but it is otherwise a very short track.\n\nJust over 5 kilometers long, Anulpha Pass is located in a custom-built entertainment arena on the east side of Makana Island (near the Sinucit track). It looks deceptively simple from above, but the undulations of the track surface and narrow skill-cut are enough to keep any racer on their toes.\n\nKoltiwa is not quite as fast as its sister Delta League courses due to some quite nasty corner work, most notably a chicane series early on and an evil hairpin near the end. Quite a fun track.\n\nKhara Descent is without doubt the most visually stunning circuit so far in Wipeout Pure. While it is the shortest Delta course, Khara Descent is also by far the most technical. There's only a couple of fast sections here, most of the course involves navigating tricky corners, one of which is open on one side. It is still pretty wide though, making for some violent action.\n\nHD Era[]\n\nMoa Therma is the very definition of Mediterranean glamour, built on an exclusive island chain off the shores of Sicily. Race through the horizontal Synchro Logistics dynamo and contribute to the electricity supply for the residential rich and healthy in this 5.3 kilometer track.\n\nThe 4.7 kilometer Metropia circuit carefully picks its way between the skyscrapers that dominate the Kyoto skyline.

Arc Prime is the answer, where fortified walls and secure network channels offer privacy at a price. Only the race escapes, a portion of its 5k length breaking the boundaries of Seattle’s interurban corridor.\n\nFour and a half kilometers of high-tension track coil around the art deco statements of De Konstruct, the city whose only constant is change, where the fortunate can catch a sideways glimpse of the radio waves amongst the engine flares.\n\nThe weather machines came to Gibraltar’s Fort Gale for the research, but they stayed for the race. Hiding themselves between the residential fins, they studiously watch over the five and a half clicks of this viper’s nest of a track.\n\nThis gunmetal grey city was fully excavated after the outbreak of Nova Scotia, leaving only the neon signs and robotic sentries to watch carefully over the crowd-avatars and magnetic twists of Basilico's 4.2 kilometer circuit.\n\nThe parks of Greenland were finally thawed out and preserved forever by a committee of philanthropists with utopian ambitions. This custom built 4.6 kilometer track provides a whirlwind tour through the ice-blue architecture and petrified trees of Platinum Rush.\n\nAs the cities of the Cayman Islands expanded into the sea, Vertica was born. This tropical paradise is home to the last remaining coral reefs and is a haven for the elite and the reclusive, with strict corporate access to the stands of this 4.3k track.\n\n5.1 kilometers of track are surrounded by the supercooled servers and data center's of Outpost 7.

This Moroccan venue strikes a balance between thrills and technical racing over 5.2 kilometers of tarmac rete, angling between the support platforms and statues in the breezy late-afternoon climate.\n\nIn the subterranean networks below Alaska, high ranking officials work in secret ambience waiting for the bomb to drop. Their only entertainment is the race, carrying its own threat level through 4.3k of permanent gloom. This is Orcus.\n\nBallisticNG[]\n\nServing as Barcelona's pivotal tourist attraction across the warm Spanish shoreline, Cassandra is a perfect summer getaway and a breeze for pilots new to the AGL.\n\nCut from the vibrant cloth of the idyllic Italian business park of Zephyr Ridge, this quiet alpine region houses many small outlets for both business and leisure at its base.\n\nTwo weather tampering systems have left portions of the Swiss Alps in a constant electrical storm. Surge through the discharged valleys with this newcomer to the AGL, a perfect entry track for beginner pilots.\n\nGlide through the chilling Greenland mountain ranges of Harpstone.

Such a modern marvel goes unappreciated by the droves of spectators situated along these few miles of repurposed transportation tracks.\n\nA large wind farm wraps itself around the Alps at the heart of Zephyr Climb. The chilly peak boasts a slowly climbing layout with an impressive view of the surrounding mountain ranges.\n\nExpense, destruction and conspiracy. Nova Split is the result of all three. Torn apart by military grade weaponry as its true nature unfolded, the once Nova Park of Chicago lays in ruins from artificial seismic activity. An improvement considered by many.\n\nWhen a small step doesn't cut it you leap into orbit and build entertainment instead. Perhaps the most expensive project in human history, Luna sets a remarkable milestone for human achievement and also the biggest dent in global finances to date.\n\nExplore a legacy along the white cliffs of Dover and pass Dover castle, held in place from centuries past to maintain Britain's geological landmark.\n\nExperience the true sense of anti-gravity among the citadel towers of Ishtar Citadel.

While sharing many similarities with its real life counterpart, this simulated version of the circuit has a continuous surface as it was originally designed.\n\nSerpent straights and sharp drops lay through the virtual Highrise's of days end. Unlikely to see reality, Vespera Heights makes promises of living amongst the clouds with its concept of a floating metropolis.\n\nNeon Nights Era[]\n\nVega City’s Central Park blurs the line between city park and entertainment district, featuring carefully manicured forests and walking paths interspersed by large buildings. Thanks to its vibrant nightlife and unique combination of natural and man-made scenery, the park is Vega City’s most famous feature.\n\nBlueprints of an old AGL circuit were discovered and fully realized in this intermediate track weaving through dense buildings and passing Vega City's 5km highway, the design for the current iteration of Route 05 actually originates from the sport's infancy, when the AGL originally reached out to the Vega City with a proposal to build a venue in the upscale commercial district along Vega Highway 05.\n\nStorm through Vega City's developing industry sector on this intermediate Thunderhead course covered by the pollution of nearby factories. Pitting the simple beauty of nature against a drab backdrop of smoke stacks and office towers, this unique factory complex near Vega City’s downtown attempts to blend the manicured foliage of Vega Square into an industrial environment in order to make it less pollutive and more aesthetically pleasing.\n\nFlow through Vega City's central storm drain on this white knuckle circuit that promises to strain your sense of orientation. Built to handle water collection, filtration, and distribution for the entire city, the massive Vega City Municipal Water Handling Complex directly under Downtown is an underground maze of pipes, storage tanks, pumping stations and filtration facilities spanning more than 5 square kilometers. When the general design parameters for the Basin circuit were proposed, the idea was repeatedly shot down by the Vega City’s officials, who believed that having a racetrack pass through the Complex would be too costly and risk disrupting its functionality.\n\nTransit through the redundant lines of Vega City's metro system with this hybrid circuit still under heavy construction. Dating back to the mid-21st century, Vega City’s once-extensive subway system has gradually become redundant due to recent advances in transportation technology. However, interest in the subway was rekindled when a large swathe of the unused network was purchased by the AGL during the construction of Route 05.\n\nOuter Reaches Era[]\n\nThe plans to make mars habitable are well underway with the Martian habitat project on Caldera. This giant biodome offers a breathable living space and sets the standard for the first generation of extra-terrestrial colonization.\n\nTake to the skies and fly and fly around the chilling climate monitoring station of the mysterious Planet 9.

Fly through the caverns of Maceno Islands dormant volcano and peak a look at the islands vast jungle landscape. The short outdoor section utilizes a unique permanent energy bridge to allow you to see through the track floor and into the jungle below, giving Alto Overseer the best view of any of the Maceno tracks.\n\nNewly formed by artificial volcanism and unmarred by erosion, Maceno Peak looms over the Pacific as the highest point on any island on Earth. Perched nearly five kilometers above the sea, this epic high-altitude route is a stark contrast from the tracks that precede it, traversing the steep slopes at the mountain's summit and giving a good view of the frozen caldera that once birthed the island itself.\n\nBallisticNG XGL Expansion[]\n\nA city track with several right angled turns, this gloomy and challenging Abyssus track has several sharp hairpins that demand a good line and hard braking, including a unique 360 degree drop turn.\n\nThe Altima XIV that started it all, the first track of the first WipE'out\" game. This version is not a port, but a remake with a layout more suited to Zen speeds and much improved scenery, set around a mountain lake.\n\nAntelao is wide and easy, but contains several corner combinations where pilots can shave off time. This makes it ideal for competitive multiplayer events with players who may or may not know the course layout.\n\nSet around a solar-punk power plant near Alexandria, Atan-Ra features several banked turns, mag-lock and a short offroad section. It supports high speed racing such as hyper-speed and drag mode, as well as eliminator events.\n\nA challenging short track in a volcanic caldera, Batur Crater is set around the lava lake of Mount Batur. It may be relatively short, but it is relentless and features some nasty chicanes to challenge even advanced pilots.\n\nA major update to one of Enai's first tracks, Cairodrome. The layout and scenery have been rebuilt from scratch, adding more offroad sections while removing annoying obstacles, This, is Cairodrome II.\n\nCassini Dome is set on the moon, this track is not very long, but offers a variety of corners, while floor-hugger keeps you down and in the action.\n\nLocated in the Canadian Rockies, Cerridan VI is a realistic, \"legit\" styled track that could be an actual XGL racecourse. It is wide, highly competitive and suitable for new players but challenging enough for veterans.\n\nSet among the eternal flames of the Yanartas gas field in Turkey, Desolata is a long track with three offroad sections, a narrow bridge, hazardous fire and a sandstorm that limits long distance vision.\n\nRedOut[]\n\nNeo Calima was inhabited by humans since Ancient Egyptian times, with nearby sites having ancient pyramids and statues. It stopped being inhabited around the time of the Exodus Project, the middle Anthropocene. During the climate collapse, Water World War, New Renaissance and Exodus Project, Old Cairo became on of Earth's largest cities.\n\nPath of Wonder was located on Fuji was once known as Japan, before the exodus. After the Rebirth, the island became of the first regions of Earth to slowly restore its climate, and was subsequently re-colonized by humans. Thanks to the ASERA (originally co-founded by a Japanese engineering company) return from Mars to Earth, SRRL race tracks were completed a few years prior to 2589.\n\nDLC[]\n\nChenghou Project is Makana's Chinatown, located in the heart of Vineta's financial district. This is quite a technical track and not for the faint of heart. Peculiarities on this track include the Hello Lucki Bank hairpin, a inverse-cambered spiral and culminates in a long jump into the tunneled entry into the final chicane.\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nBy 2589, Neumann's Outpost at the Genesis colony has become a sprawling dome-metropolis known as Genesis Lunar City, and is considered one of the worst places to live in the solar system. There are visible scars from the many wars fought here. It still remains the largest exo-city of humanity. The SRRL maintains several race tracks that run through the city and around the dome.\n\nNobody knows exactly what happened at IRIS ORIGIN station during the race of Cassini, one of the bases along the IRIS star route f or Mars. The last known message from the ORIGIN was \"unknown object approaching,\" and some say the ESA sealed off all other records. The rescue teams found only floating rubble and this new, tiny black hole. The black hole was contained and stabilized by the ESA using a continuous influx of garbage. it's now basically a dumpster. With adequate antimatter equipment it can also be an Exo-System portal.\n\nRacers[]\n\nStarting Base Roster[]\n\nAmi Nakajima (FEISAR)\n\nJohn Dekka (AG-Systems)\n\nArial Tetsuo (Auricom)\n\nStefan Geist (Qirex)\n\nMyima Tsarong (Piranha)\n\nTomoya Yamada (G-Tek)\n\nArwel Jones (Wyvern)\n\nTimo Nikkola (Hyperion)\n\nGiovanni Rizzo (Scorpio)\n\nKenta Iwazaki (Nexus)\n\nAmi Ikeyama (Tenrai)\n\nRenato Cardoso (Caliburn)\n\nManu Kanaloa (MAKO)\n\nJohn Carving (Aster)\n\nCaptain Falcon (Blue Falcon)\n\nBilly (Mad Wolf)\n\nDraq (Mighty Typhoon)\n\nBio Rex (Big Fang)\n\nPJ (Groovy Taxi)\n\nRenée Cadieux (Assegai)\n\nJonathan Lidgren (Goteki 45)\n\nHilde Brandt (Icaras)\n\nSongen Grey (Van-Uber)\n\nSveta Kirovski (Tigron)\n\nAlex Reece (EG-R)\n\nNatasha Belmondo (Xios)\n\nGuan Wei Chen (Harimau)\n\nGavino Cavalcante (Triakis)\n\nNyarai Khumala (Mirage)\n\nBrian Turner (EG-X)\n\nHeldi Toledo (Rinumau)\n\nTerry \"Rivets\" Toledo (Scrapjacks)\n\nVictoria Addison (MTech)\n\nMichael Vernon (VERT)\n\nElon Reeve Musk (Tesla)\n\nMasujiro Hashimoto (Nissan)\n\nLouis Renault (Renault)\n\nRudolf \"Rudi\" Dassler (PUMA)\n\nJohn Stith Pemberton (Coca-Cola)\n\nCaleb Davis Bradham (Pepsi)\n\nJon Burgerman (Turboweevel)\n\nMark James (Cardracer)\n\nNeil McFarland (Haironaut)\n\nScien (Klor)\n\nDaxter (Daxtinator)\n\nJak (Havenzoomer)\n\nLena Grünfeld (Katzbalger)\n\nForest (Aporyon)\n\nSamantha Robinson (X-Cell)\n\nKat Sinclair (Thunderbird)\n\nJones Richard (AEC)\n\nNolo Pasaro (Teku)\n\nBanjee Castillo (Silencerz)\n\nTork Maddox (Metal Maniacs)\n\nTaro Kitano (Scorchers)\n\nThomas HK Marmand (ESA-AGR)\n\nKarl Gottlyeb-Daimar (KOEN)\n\nZanna (Lunare Scuderia)\n\nBase Unlockables[]\n\nCarlo Abarth (Abarth)\n\nEric Li Shufu (Geely Auto)\n\nAsura\n\nGilgamesh\n\nLord Dominator\n\nWalter Elias Disney (Disney)\n\nSyndrome\n\nWade Wilson/Deadpool (MARVEL)\n\nBruce Wayne/Batman Who Laughs (DC Comics)\n\nSnake Eyes\n\nShang Tsung\n\nYoshisuke Aikawa (Datsun)\n\nNolan Grayson/Omni-Man (Amazon)\n\nRugal Bernstein (Hyundai)\n\nAkuma (Kia)\n\nEternal Champion/Dark Champion (Acura)\n\nDominic Toretto (Dodge)\n\nSeason 1[]\n\nRuby Rose (Team RWBY)\n\nWeiss Schnee (Team RWBY)\n\nBlake Belladonna (Team RWBY)\n\nYang Xiao Long (Team RWBY)\n\nHanzo Hasashi/Scorpion (Shirah Ryu)\n\nKuai Liang/Sub-Zero (Lin Kuei)\n\nSeason 2[]\n\nSonic The Hedgehog (Team Sonic)\n\nTails 'Miles' Prowler (Team Sonic)\n\nKnuckles The Echidna (Team Sonic)\n\nShadow The Hedgehog (Team Dark)\n\nZavok (Team Eggman)\n\nDr. Eggman (Team Eggman)\n\nSeason 3[]\n\nAmanda Holiday (Daito)\n\nZavala (Vanguard)\n\nRacer Pass #1[]\n\nArcher (Supercell)\n\nBarbie (Ferrari)\n\nChristian von Koenigsegg (Koenigsegg)\n\nJean Bugatti (Bugatti Rimac)\n\nJonathan Irons (Atlas Corporation)\n\nRainbow Dash (Rainbow F.A.S.T)\n\nRacer Pass #2[]\n\nArmand Peugeot (Peugeot)\n\nInarius (GMC)\n\nJia Yueting (Faraday Future)\n\nLilith (Cadillac)\n\nLiu Tao (IM Motors)\n\nNitara (Jetta)\n\nElaTra DLC[]\n\nAarav (SG.X)\n\nAbra (Pulsar)\n\nAlvaro (1+1)\n\nAmzi (Origami)\n\nAnouk (Necra)\n\nQuotes[]\n\nStart Boost[]\n\nHitting the Opponent[]\n\nSonic The Hedgehog\n\nBam, Shadow!\n\nEat Wisp, Zavok!\n\nNailed ya, Knuckles!\n\nOne to the mustache, Eggman!\n\nTagged ya, Tails!\n\nTails 'Miles' Prowler\n\nJust what the doctor ordered, Doctor!\n\nNothing personal, Knuckles!\n\nSorry, Sonic, but I'm in it to win it!\n\nWho's your daddy, Shadow?\n\nGetting Hit by an Opponent[]\n\nSonic The Hedgehog\n\nCheap shot, Eggman!\n\nIt'll take more than that, Shadow!\n\nTails!

In November 2024, the World Technology Symposium rescinded its support of the Congress. As a result, the European Federation ceased its funding of the Foundation, which was later reinstated as an independent research institute once the Congress eventually disbanded.\n\nAnti-Gravity Systems, otherwise known as AG Systems International, also referred to as AG-S or AG-SYS was founded in the early 21st century and was a member of the World Anti-Gravity Research Congress. The Foundation became the leader in anti-gravity research when Pierre Belmondo emerged as its Director in 2024. But later that year, influenced by profit-driven governments, the Congress was shut down, and anti-gravity technology was then deemed \"inefficient\" and \"never...cost-effective\". Nonetheless, Belmondo pushed on with anti-gravity research in secret. He proved the whole world that anti-gravity transport was possible as he accomplished the first flight in an AG craft in 2035.\n\nAuricom Research Industries was founded in 2046 by Delia Flaubert, who previously worked for AG Systems before she was dismissed along with Holst McQueen, then-director of Qirex. A fervent follower of Pierre Belmondo's philosophy of the development of AG technology for the good of mankind, Flaubert believed that the technology should be used to enforce a fair and friendly competition so that the ultimate winners are the people of the Earth.\n\nQirex Research and Development, formerly known as Qirex Industries, also referred to as Qirex-RD was founded in the early 21st century and initially focused on the Russian domestic market. In 2045, AG Systems employee Holst McQueen was dismissed from the company as a result of a communication breakdown with fellow employee Delia Flaubert. McQueen went to Russia and started an AG racing team with Qirex. Flaubert responded by forming Auricom one year later.\n\nPiranha Advancements, formerly known as Pir-hana, stylized as Piranha.A was formed in 2044 as a result of a merger between two smaller Brazilian companies, Pir and Hana. Despite the subtle and mysterious appearance of the team, they had played an important role in the history of Anti-Gravity Racing by establishing both the Anti-Gravity Federation and the Anti-Gravity Racing Championship. Mysteriously, Pir-hana pulled out of AG racing entirely before the F3600 League was announced in 2050. They were bought out by an unknown Chinese consortium. From then, they produced airbrakes for AG Systems and Auricom craft before returning to craft development in 2060 under the new name of Piranha Advancements.\n\nAssegai Developments was formed in 2113 following an invitation from the F5000 Anti-Gravity Racing Commission to the United African Nations (a union of African nations based in South Africa). This was in response to the strong performance of African pilots in the past, as well as an attempt by the Commission to make AG racing a truly international competition. For this reason, Assegai opted to hire only African pilots for their anti-gravity racing program.\n\nGoteki 45 was founded in 2095 and entered competition in the F7200 League. The original Goteki team were one of, if not, the most violent teams to have ever competed, with their craft having far stronger shields at the expense of outright speed. Furthermore, the pilots the team hired seemed to favor violence over actual racing. Because of all of this, it was suspected that Goteki 45 had been founded to undermine anti-gravity racing, for if this was true, it could backfire dramatically.\n\nIcaras was established in 2109 as a pet project after claiming he was able to build an AG racing team from scratch within seven months. Later on, he registered Icaras to the Race Commission to compete in the F7200 League. It seemed that the reason Burns wanted to do such a thing was mainly due to the large contributions from various businesses around the world willing to take part in the project.\n\nVan-Über Racing Developments was founded on 2143 by Wolfgang Van-Über the four-time world champion. The Van-Über team turned out to be very popular thanks to their two pilots, Songen Grey and Nami Mishima, with the latter compared to AG racing legend Arial Tetsuo, mainly because of her hairstyle. Later however, Grey retired, and Mishima was subsequently tipped to take over the main pilot spot. From then and on, her craft had been constantly sabotaged throughout the league.\n\nTigron Enterprises (pronounced Tee-gron) was a conglomerate formed by the same criminals running the country at the time. After buying out the failing Qirex company in 2149, Tigron would enter the competition in the following season using Qirex technologies, but also bringing their own craft designs and aggressive tactics to the fore.\n\nEG-R Technologies formed on 2155 by an unknown founder, although this remains subject of clarification for now. In the two years of entry into AG racing, the F9000 International Federation of Anti-Gravity Racing had made numerous missions to acquire the basic information of the team to no avail, and threatened to suspend the team if they did not comply with the Commission, only to be responded with the 'destructive power' which could 'conjure up at will'. Until the anomaly appeared to their facility, EG-R was pulled by The Entity & they have to race against the odds with Xios International.\n\nXios International was founded in 2137 as a weapons development firm. Unsurprisingly, Xios boasted one of the most powerful weaponries in the F9000 League. Despite this, Xios had possibly been a lower team for their first few years until Natasha Belmondo, the great-great-granddaughter of AG pioneer Pierre Belmondo, moved to the team after being bought from Auricom. Since then, everyone mocked Auricom, with Xios saying that when one of Belmondo's descendants had abandoned them, they were clutching at straws. This obviously angered the American team. The Entity pulled Xios International before the merger with EG-R, Xios & EG-R found their future self, EG-X.\n\nHarimau International was founded in 2177 in Malaysia, the Harimau International organization is a humanitarian foundation established to aid the recovery of Asian regions during the great depression of the 2170s. Expanding out with the borders of its home country in the early 2180s, the organization began its worldwide programme, and contributed to many urban regeneration projects around the world during that decade.\n\nTriakis Industries was formed in 2132 as a result of a merger of three smaller arms companies: Advanced Targeting Systems Ltd., Kramer Ordnance, and Incendiary Projectile Supplies Inc. Because of such diversity, the potential to create an AG racing team wasn't far from the minds of the company directors. However, that wasn't possible during the early years of the Triakis company.\n\nEG-X Technologies was formed in 2172 as a result of the merger of two F9000 League teams EG-R and Xios, EG-X Technologies appears to be a strange blend of man and machinery. Otherwise, they have always been so enigmatic. Despite never participating in the FX300 League, EG-X entered the FX350 League as something of an unknown quantity. They showed such an excellent performance in the league and put a shame to the opposition with their sleek craft that not many people had ever known. This proved that the team were more than ready to compete in AG racing. As such, it was obvious that they were very willing to take an early shot in the next competition.\n\nMirage Racing was formed in 2202 by the wealthy sand baron Sheikh Mani Zayed. The team would utilize the Mantis chassis developed in MAGEC Development Centre outside Dubai. The Mantis craft was undoubtedly the most balanced one of the time, with such outstanding balance in both power and agility. Everyone in the development center claimed that this craft would become the one to make the difference in races. By recruiting pilots who had graduated from the MAGEC Academy, the Mirage team would like to see their performance as they came late in the FX400 League.\n\nBallisticNG[]\n\nGravity Technologies, more commonly known as G-Tek, is an Anti-Gravity R&D firm based in Yokohama, Japan. Founded by Anti-Gravity pioneers Tomoya Yamada and Kenta Iwazaki, G-Tek is the company behind the first ever Anti-Gravity device and the creation of the AGL. They serve as the de facto leader of the AGL Commission, and they have played a leading role in the evolution of the sport to date.\n\nWyvern Incorporated is a very large British vehicle manufacturer that produces a wide range of consumer and public transportation vehicles. Founded in 2050 by a prominent English entrepreneur, Wyvern has since grown to become one of the world’s most recognizable vehicle manufacturers. After developing an AG device independently of G-Tek, they joined the AGL for its inaugural season in 2144 and have been a mainstay ever since.\n\nHyperion Automotive is a Finnish supercar manufacturer that joined the AGL in 2144 in order to promote their line of high-performance AG Cars. They are a long-standing and well rounded team, though their recent focus on combat after an advertising scandal involving Omnicom has led some to believe that they might be preparing to settle a grudge with them in the AGL.\n\nHailing from the rolling valleys of South Tyrol, Italy, Scorpio Engineering is a very large industrial engineering conglomerate that started out as a construction vehicle producer in 2080. They have been responsible for the construction of a significant portion of the AGL’s circuits, and began competing in 2157 to settle a newfound grudge with Omnicom.\n\nHeadquartered in Chicago, Illinois, Omnicom Technologies is an American macrocorporation that started out as a media broadcaster but has expanded into a true giant with business in nearly every industry imaginable. They have held exclusive rights to broadcast AGL events since the league’s inception, and entered competition in the sport’s first season in 2144.\n\nDiavolt Engineering is a Russian military equipment manufacturer that was founded in 2041. Serving as the AGL’s main weapons supplier, they began competing in 2152 alongside the introduction of weapons into the sport, and have since developed a fierce rivalry with Omnicom after the two teams accused each other of causing the Nova Park Scandal.\n\nNexus International is the Anti-Gravity Kinetics arm of the European Consortium for Scientific Research. Originally a subsidiary of G-Tek, they are responsible for developing the first AG racecraft as well as a large portion of the technologies that make modern AG Racing possible.\n\nTenrai Racing Development is a Japanese AG Racing team formed in 2140 by ex-G-Tek senior engineer Ami Ikeyama. Present in the AGL since the beginning, Tenrai is now known for their opposition to the addition of weapons to racing.\n\nCaliburn Brasil is Brazil’s national Anti-Gravity Racing team. Formed in 2134 by a famous ex-racing driver, they rose to prominence as an amateur race organizer before creating an AGL team with support from the Brazilian Government. They were a mainstay in the AGL until 2157, when they were temporarily suspended from competition for using an outlawed stabilization system.\n\nProtonic AG is a Korean aftermarket auto tuning company and racing team founded in 2125. They are regarded as pioneers in the AG-Drifting scene, producing a number of performance parts for roadgoing AG-Cars, and they brought the first drift ship to the AGL in 2153.\n\nMediTech R&D (MTech) is a Canadian medical research firm and emergency vehicle manufacturer that was founded in 2075. They produce the Rescue Droids used at AGL races to catch ships that stray too far from the track, and began competing with their own racing team in 2156 in order to test new technologies and bring publicity to their humanitarian pursuits.\n\nThe Barracuda Corporation is a Korean technology and engineering conglomerate that was founded in 2097. They provide the technology used for the Speed Pads and Weapon Pads on AGL tracks, as well creating some of the virtual environments used by the AGL. In 2154, they decimated the AGL with their Model A until a rule change barred them from competing halfway through the season. They now operate 3 special leagues for their ships alongside the AGL.\n\nLance Systems Aerospace is an Australian virtual-reality developer and AG Research firm that was founded in 2055. Originally a military aircraft manufacturer, Lance Systems branched out to AG development after world peace was achieved. They created the Precision Trials, a special lineup of simulations designed to test pilots’ skills with their Precision Delta prototype craft.\n\nOrbitronix is a spacefaring technology manufacturer that played a large role in the colonization of the Solar System and helped construct all of the AGL’s offworld venues.\n\nMaceno Anti-Gravity Kinetics Optimization (MAKO) is a high-tech research firm specializing in Anti-Gravity systems. Founded in 2150 by one of the ultra-wealthy Angel Investors involved in the formation of Maceno Island, MAKO created an AGL team to join the league alongside the introduction of the Maceno Island tracks.\n\nAster Motocorp is a Swedish motorcycle manufacturer that hosts an AG-Bike racing league alongside the AGL. Originally founded in England by a former Sportbike racer, the company was moved to Sweden after being purchased by new owners.\n\nBallisticNG XGL Expansion[]\n\nAiwass - After its first racing AI was disqualified for turning around and eliminating all other ships in the race, the World University opted to outsource the job of guiding the evolution of its next AI to the internet. The fact that it started calling itself Forkship McHitlerface is the least of its issues.\n\nAsuja - Venetian luxury shipbuilder Asuja aims to join the XGL. Sharing a frame with the Mantax-5 hover-boat, this ship offers all-round performance and offshore grade shielding. However, its wide fins can pose a surprising challenge on tight tracks.\n\nAuroch - The racing version of the Columbiad G-250. Designed by American truck manufacturer Auroch, the Columbiad heavy duty crew cab pickup truck is advertised as being \"Detroit tough and Daytona fast\". Unfortunately, its handling belongs on the Bonneville salt flats.\n\nBlitzen - This featherweight omits the heavy reactor and remass of other racing craft, relying on solid state batteries to power its mag-lev and ion engine. The Z-5 is the most agile ship on the grid, but the ion engine cannot perform a boost start and there is little power to spare for the shield generator.\n\nBonkor - The XGL took this South African racing team out of Soweto, but could not take Soweto out of the team. Cobbled together from junkyard parts and armor plating, the Tremor is the lowest budget contender in the league. Its ride height provides some protection from bottoming out.\n\nBuran - The Harmata from Belarusian team Buran demonstrates what Slavic anti-gravity rallying looks like. No hover height stabilizer. No automatic track alignment. Just two Havoc landskimmer engines, a control stick and the truth.\n\nCliffhawk - First Nations offroad racing team Cliffhawk built a road version of its successful Cliffjumper-X, featuring a powerful AG generator for some extra bounce on rough terrain, trail rated shields and a lightweight frame. Top speed, however, is not a priority off the beaten path.\n\nD.Mtr - When the evil AI \"Nyx\" corrupted \"Panthea\" and took over R-Temis, a couple of engineers were working late with their implants turned off and escaped her siren song. To counteract the memetic virus, they formed team D.Mtr to continue to spread their message of peace and harmony.\n\nDrakkar - Hovering just inches above the ground, the Nordland's two massive turbofans create a vacuum underneath its side skirts, greatly improving grip. The restricted airflow reduces performance at low engine power, but this Norwegian garage team considers the handling benefits more than worth it.\n\nHongshan - A Chinese motto says \"May you live in interesting times.\" The Hongshan LM-3 may have interesting handling dynamics and shield strength, but it also has interesting amounts of firepower and very interesting acceleration, making it an interesting presence on the track for the other teams.\n\nJinx - Built in a British garage by the Middleton twins, the Jinx Gremlin is not the fastest or most technologically advanced ship on the grid, but it features its designers' secret sauce: magnetic airbrakes for an incredibly sharp turning radius.\n\nKharon - As drone trucks took over the easy routes, only the toughest remained in business. Built in Siberia, the rally edition of the Kharon Bearcat features gravity anchors to supplement its airbrakes and slow-burning engines to maximize torque. It may be slow, but it doesn't stop for anything, or anyone.\n\nKi-Tai - Succeeding the legendary Obake was never going to be easy, but the hard-edged Akuma may just have done it. Ki-Tai's latest cowled bike features even more aggressive handling and two screaming turbines that generate enough G-forces to send yourself to the memory bank in 0.46 seconds flat.\n\nMentek - Only class-10 Psion's can pilot this ship, designed by Mentek for the XGL to showcase their psionic augments. Lacking control surfaces, it is steered by the pilot's willpower, giving it inertia less handling at the cost of strict weight and thrust limits.\n\nMoira - Cybernetics chaebol Moira Corporation does not play fair. The Black Widow is slow but very agile and hides a short ranged disruptor that triggers an emergency shutdown in ships directly in front of it, bringing them to an immediate jarring stop.\n\nMother Trucker - This team of hot-rodders found a missing zero in the performance specs of the ATEN-1 battleship engine that made it technically race legal. It may be big and heavy, but the upgraded Thunderhead truck chassis knows how to handle a load and when it gets going, it really gets going.\n\nNamaka - Just when you thought it was safe, Hawaiian team Namaka releases the Kailua-5. Its advanced thrust vectoring technology allows the ship to pitch up or down more effectively and glide longer than even its predecessor, albeit at the cost of engine size and power.\n\nNobuo - Born on the ovals, the Nobuo Talladega's unique asymmetric design adapted well to road racing. Active aero keeps it firmly at ground level, though pilots may find left hand turns slightly easier. As its founder Saikin Tetsuo famously said, \"Winning is easy. Winning with grace is hard.\"\n\nNyx - When the benevolent AI entity \"Panthea\" leading R-Temis was corrupted by her evil twin \"Nyx\", the team changed accordingly. The Nykthos is much more aggressive than its pacifist predecessor, very stable and almost as fast, but still suffers from weak airbrake response.\n\nOvum - Ovum, the \"urban mobility disruptor for a connected crowd space\", is more commonly associated with corporate arrogance than with racing, until hacker collective Rowhammer took control of some of its autonomous O:black limousines and disabled the safety limiters.\n\nPapillon - Developed in France as an aerobatics stunt ship and featuring a very compact design for maximum agility, the Papillon Skydancer is light enough to glide almost indefinitely, making it easy to clear mines and other obstacles, and can easily take to the sky as well.\n\nPhoebus - Designed by Phoebus Customs for a private entrant into the XGL, this chariot's two enormously powerful engines propel it to untold speeds. They do take a while to spool up before they deliver full power, and its graceful bodywork is particularly fragile.\n\nSakrataal - To become a good scientist, one must ask questions. Questions such as \"Instead of building a ship, would it be possible to grow one in a bio-vat?\" or \"How much blood would this take?\" or \"What country has no police?\". In its pursuit of knowledge, Sakrataal Biotech asks them all.\n\nSamhaara - Balinese team Samhaara follows up on the moderately successful Trishula with the intimidating K4L-2 Vishuddha. Sharp edged like a Thuggee dagger, its tail heavy design gives it excellent stability.\n\nSilverbolt - Stuntman Craig \"Fireball\" Noble's Silverbolt shattered the land speed record on the salt flats in 2157, propelled by three solid fuel rockets. Once ignited, the rockets continue to burn until either the fuel or the pilot's luck runs out.\n\nSimhaya - What would you do if you had a tank? Developed by Sri Lankan mil-tech company Simhaya as an armored scout vehicle, the Claw Fist may not be ahead of the pack in terms of speed and especially handling, but it is stable, very tough and its weapons pack a devastating punch.\n\nViskor - Big brains, big engines, big wins: Pakistani steel mogul Prajes Viskor's battle plan is very simple. The Hellion's tri-forged thermocarbon turbines can withstand launch stresses that would melt other engines, giving it excellent acceleration and the best Turbo on the grid.\n\nZjawa - \"If it's ugly but it wins races, it's not ugly.\" The words of Zjawa's Director of Competition Bialas Nowak failed to move the needle on the sales of their (ugly) road cars, but they were not wrong: the ramjet powered XGL Orkan R-68 is ugly, and it wins races.\n\nPACER[]\n\nFollowing the globalisation of the space programme and its internationally financed relocation to Suprabad Space City north west of Hydrabad in the recently federated Bharet Commonwealth, the former Chinese space industry, its scientists and taikonauts found they had time on their hands. Searching for new thrills and spills, led by child-genius and Yuan Dong boy-wonder (and would-be taikonaut), Yukio An convinced his father, president of the huge digital engineering giant Shenzou Fusion Corporation, to invest in the research facility at Tiangong University as a global showcase for for Yuan Dongs technological and sporting prowess utilizing the vision and experience of the old Chinese space industry. Dragon's Dragonstar and a new generation of ninja was born.\n\nEurussia was the first of the big superpowers to see the potential in relocating its Space Agency in the Interworld Hub at Suprabad Space City in Bharet Commonwealth. Its own AG research, initially in tandem with RPSA's Izulu Dynamics' installation of a hyperspeed advanced travel system linking Putingrad with Suprabad, was designed to reduce intercontinental commute times. Research showed that shorter journey times could be achieved by using relays of smaller single passenger craft piloted by smaller, lighter AG-Zhokeys over relatively shorter distances. One of the founding investors in World Anti-Gravity Racing was the Eurussian ex-pat Tiberius Abramovich living in the London Citystate while working as a business advisor for Midas AG. He proposed, part funded, and named, in honour of Yuri Gagarin, the Gagarin-68 team and their Klushino Cosmonaut Research Facility, which sought to harness the Cossack spirit of the AG-Zhoks in an attempt for Eurussia to dominate the then new sport.\n\nIn 2069 the Seer of Dubai invited World Anti-Gravity Racing to hold a showcase event for the nascent sport on a purpose-built track linking the Dubai Palm through the faded hi-rise ghettos of Jumeirah Beach and on to the astonishing space scrapers of the inland NDCC (New Dubai Canal Cities). In preparation for the event the Seer commissioned the cream of international AG scientists and developers to create an invincible Jazirat Al-'Arab AG funded racing team. Thanks to huge investment from the richest Arab businessmen in the region, the team, named after the Seers desire to be the best team not just in the world, but in the galaxy, were victorious. The sport has also become hugely popular with women across the Arab world, who flock to study at the Centre for Scientific Understanding from where Firestarter El-Hashem, one of the most beautiful and highest paid among the WAR elite, graduated in 2071.\n\nThe first Garuda AG developments were public hoverboards to help workers and students navigate the car-less newbuilt science and technology hub of Suprabad Space City located north-west of Hydrabad. As the city grew following the relocation of the global space programme there, larger craft able to cover greater distances were required and Garuda commissioned developers from nearby Hydrabad Energy Research Bureau to work with an invited international symposium of AG technicians at the Suprabad Space City University to develop craft especially suited for maximum performance in the high temperatures of the region. Garuda's chief scientist, Deepak Vijay, realised these developments created super high-performance craft able to compete with the best the rest of the world had to offer and in 2070 Garuda officially entered World Anti-Gravity Racing competition with the blessing of the newly elected Bharet Commonwealth government.\n\nRedout[]\n\nAfter saving humanity with space travel and terraforming research, ESA created what people will really remember them for: antigrav magnets. This is where everything started, and this beauty is the mother of all Redout ships!\n\nThe Koeniggswerth philosophy is that humanity needs stability and safety. Having specialized in hulls during the Exodus war, they brought back the Koen, now with powerful magnets and unmatched shields.\n\nSulha used to produce giant space cargo ships vital to colonization after the Exodus. Today they apply that same horsepower to their ultra-lightweight ship nicknamed the Cannonglass. You'll get either the speed of light or ashes -- there's no middle ground.\n\nBlazing-fast with powerful strafe thrusters and hard-to-tame steering, the Conqueror is one of the fastest ships in the league. Every Conqueror pilot's motto is: \"You only live one straight at a time\".\n\nA tech-savvy team that's innovative to its core, Asera is headquartered on an island once known as Japan. The unique lines, overwhelming acceleration, and immense boost will greatly affect your driving style.\n\nLuxury, speed, and controversy. The founder Giovanni Ricciardi, descendent of Eva Ricciardi, used to say: \"The ordinary flee the past and chase the present, but the exceptional drive the future.\" Such poetic language from the family that almost annihilated humanity.\n\nOften mocked for its weight and mediocre speed, it has carved out a niche in the SRRL thanks to its extreme reliability. Sveta Savitskaya had a motto: \"A Buran that starts is a Buran which will finish.\"\n\nShip Lore[]\n\nWipE'out\"[]\n\nFEISAR\n\nLS-5600 Mk.IV - Needless to say, this craft is suited to absolute beginners. However, it is stressed that if you are familiar with the Wipeout series or any other racing game, you would perform better with another craft like the AG Systems 3240ii SRX, since the LS-5600 is really slow in comparison (and the slowest in the game). Even to test out the more technical tracks, you will be caught off guard by the LS-5600's low speed but superior handling abilities and acceleration. Also, the craft is the lightest in the game, making it the weakest against weapon impact.\n\nF5000 - The FEISAR F5000 craft is very agile, with a high thrust output and relatively strong shields. Most of the time you will be able to navigate a course without even touching the airbrakes, and as a result it is an excellent craft to learn in as the airbrakes take time to master. However, since it is biased towards high maneuverability and ease of use, it is the slowest craft in the game and will often struggle to keep up with the other teams over the course of a race, especially in the higher speed classes.\n\nF7200 - The FEISAR F7200 craft is very agile and is very quick to get off the mark, having the strongest thrust of all of them. This is ideal for beginners, as the high handling will let you get used to the tracks without having to use the airbrakes straight away, and if you do hit the wall, you'll be up and running again very quickly. It also has among the strongest shields, equal to Goteki 45, allowing you to take a lot of punishment. The huge tradeoff for this, however, is that it has extremely low top speed!\n\nLS-59 - As with all FEISAR craft, the LS-59 exhibits superb handling and great shields. However, it has a higher speed stat compared to its predecessors (and any other team craft in the series), which could be beneficial to new pilots (as well as helping it stay competitive later on). As such, this is one of the highly recommended craft in the beginner leagues of the game. However, this extra speed comes at the cost of thrust and weapon power. The LS-59 has the lowest weapons multiplier out of the three starter teams, and its thrust is only marginally better than the G-Tech REVVER series. The thrust will not be a problem for you if you are good enough to avoid any contact with weapons or walls.\n\nFX300 - Amazing handling and great thrust, coupled with decent shielding make it ideal to learn the ropes of AG racing, and also make it a good choice for technical circuits that are more likely to get violent. As a result, its speed leaves a lot to be desired, being the slowest of them all. Don't expect to win many races on Sol 2 or Vineta K if you're up against anything a lot faster.\n\nFX350/400 - For most of the time, FEISAR have always excelled in handling, and their FX350/400 craft is no exception. It is an excellent craft to learn in, as even at high speeds, airbraking is minimal and this will allow you to slowly get used to it rather than jump in the deep end. Coupled with its decent thrust and shield, it's absolutely made for the technical circuits. Its major downside, however, is that it is the slowest craft of them all, as there is little room for the top speed department, which the FEISAR craft always lack. This may not be particularly troublesome on the technical circuits, but it will become more of a handful to hold the lead in the open circuits.\n\nSpeed Class - With sublime handling, this ship is ideal for anyone just starting out in the high-velocity world of Anti-Gravity Racing. While not the fastest ship on the grid, you'll soon catch the competition through the corners. A consummate all-rounder, the FEISAR Speed won't let you down!\n\nFighter Class - The FEISAR Fighter maintains the all-rounder vibe indicative of the team, but with an added punch. This heavy weapons variant is likely to give your opponents a nasty surprise to slow them down on the straights.\n\nAgility Class - Already known for its superb handling, the Agility variant sacrifices a little top end speed for extra maneuverability. Hyper-dynamic airbrakes make this ship ideal for the more technical circuits.\n\nPrototype Class - Experimenting with a fuel system which charges from speed pads, this FEISAR has a variable top speed. While starting off at a slower speed than the rest of the pack, the engine receives a charge from speed pads, providing a more permanent speed increase, exceeding the stated speed class of any race. Exactly what will happen at maximum velocity is still unknown at this stage. This charge system will reset on new laps and after heavy collisions.\n\nAG-Systems\n\n3240ii SRX - The 3240ii SRX has a balanced top speed and mass, good handling and a very high thrust. This balance makes it an ideal tournament craft, as it is equally suited to all track environments.\n\nF5000 - The AG Systems F5000 craft is very agile, with the strongest thrusters of any craft and a speed far superior to that of the FEISAR. While it may be a good stepping stone for those who prefer the smooth handling of a lighter craft, the shield strength is very poor, meaning the craft will be unable to take a lot of punishment necessary to last through some of the longer races.\n\nF7200 - The AG Systems F7200 craft is a much faster incarnation than its predecessors, able to match the Qirex for top speed and better it for handling. However, like its previous incarnation, its shields are thin and a lot of wall scraping will cripple it. Besides, its thrust is not quite up to its usual standard compared to its predecessors and successors.\n\nFX300 - This FX300 craft places strong emphasis on both handling and thrust, making it unbeatable through tough corners. Able to turn on a dime and accelerate away before the other craft have even passed it, it is the master of the technical circuit. Unfortunately, it's not very fast when it comes to straight sections, and all that advantage gained in corners is soon lost again on the straights. It also has weak shielding, making it vulnerable to unguided weapons on straights as well. Not a craft to make a mistake in.\n\nFX350/400 - AG Systems have gone down a similar route to that of FEISAR, favouring agility to raw power. This craft is lacking in the top speed department, and does not handle as well as FEISAR, but it has more powerful thrusters. Getting through corners may be slightly more taxing, but you'll have the advantage getting out of them. Yo"
