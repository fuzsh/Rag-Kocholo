        "text": "The Site is located on the northern slope of the Brienzer Rothorn mountain range, between 1,060 and 1,900 metres above sea level. The Site of almost 14 square kilometres is characterized by a mosaic of fens, several types of mountain swamp with low, transitional and raised bogs of national importance, as well as wet spruce forests and meadows. It is notable as the contiguous mire landscape with the highest number of bogs under protection in Switzerland. Laubersmad-Salwidili is home to 24 plant and 33 animal species listed on the Swiss red lists of endangered species, while three plant and 24 animal species are listed on the IUCN global red list. The presence of the three-toed woodpecker, the capercaillie, the black grouse and the lynx underlines the important role of the Site as a habitat for wild mammals and birds. In terms of ecosystem services, the Site plays an important role in water retention. Important bog restoration measures have been implemented since 2004. Human activities affecting the Site include cattle grazing and mountain recreational pursuits such as skiing, hiking, and mushroom and berry picking."
