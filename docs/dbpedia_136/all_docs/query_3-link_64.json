        "text": "We head onto the Bernese Oberland Trail today. Leaving the historic little town of Unterseen, we pass through modern residential areas lining the banks of the River Aare and make our way to the ruins of Weissenau Castle where the Aare flows into Lake Thun. We follow the line of the Aare Delta, passing a nature reserve and reaching the mouth of the River Lombach at Neuhaus. Bypassing the foot of the Niederhorn, we head for the Bay of Sundlauenen – a popular day-trip destination where we reach the start of the impressive Luk-Treppe – the pilgrim’s path hewn into the rock that leads up to the entrance to the popular St. Beatus Caves, where Saint Beatus is said to have once lived. After this, much of the route passes through woodland continuing our route to Merligen.\n\nBreakfast & dinner included\n\nDistance: 12.9km\n\nElevation gain: 282m\n\nElevation descent: 272m\n\nHighest point: 727 above sea level\n\nToday’s hike will offer unique views of Lake Thun, Lake Brienz and the surrounding mountain peaks.\n\nWe will start the hike following signs for the Augstmatthorn where the path runs over grassland. There are technical sections to overcome, however the panoramic view more than makes up for the effort. To the north, the view sweeps from the moors of Lombachalp and the source of the River Emme to the Hohgant and the Schrattenfluh. On a clear day we can even see the Jura Mountains. To the east, we can make out the top of Lake Brienz and the Aare Plain. The rim of the Bernese Alps can be seen spanning from the south to the west. If we are lucky, we will see a herd of ibex, proud animals that will let us watch up to just a few metres away.\n\nThe next section of the hike runs a little below or over the narrow ridge. This offers even more intoxicating views on the one hand, but longer exposed sections, as well as portions that are difficult to negotiate on the other. The descent will then take us down below the tree line, where it continues along a varied route through meadow or woodland towards Harder. A short distance further along, we’ll reach our destination – the summit station of the Harder Kulm funicular railway.\n\nIn keeping with the ‘nature’ experience, none of the tracks are paved. Surefootedness and a head for heights are essential. This means walking while focusing all of your attention on the path in front of you and stopping if you want to take in the view. The trickiest sections are equipped with a rope.\n\nBreakfast & dinner included\n\nDistance: 11.1km\n\nElevation gain: 810m\n\nElevation descent: 1060m\n\nHighest point: 2134m above sea level\n\nPassing through the Bernese Oberland over the past few days, we will have seen Jungfraujoch. Today is the day we make our way up there to what is known as the ‘Top of Europe’ as it is the highest accessible point in Europe, standing at a staggering 3,454m high. We will begin this journey to the top by boarding a train from Interlaken to the picturesque town of Grindelwald. From here, we continue on with our journey and board another train to Kleine Scheidegg, where we step onto the funicular for our final destination of Jungfraujoch. To get to the very highest point, we take the escalator to the Sphinx. Here, we will enjoy some free time to take in just how high we are, breathe in the crisp mountain air, witness the magnificent glacier and mountain peaks. We will then return down the mountain via the funicular and gondola, finally boarding the train back to Interlaken.\n\nBreakfast included\n\nToday we embark on what is rightly regarded as one of Switzerland’s most beautiful lakeside walks. This trail hugs the bank of the glittering blue-green Lake Brienz, which takes us through gnarled, fairy tale mountain forests, to secluded bathing spots and a splendid Art Nouveau hotel. The track is only paved in the village at the beginning of the route.\n\nThe starting point is the former fishing village of Iseltwald. At the Lido, the lakeside promenade ends and the gravelled lakeside path begins. The route rolls along in gentle dips following the course of the river. Parts of the path run right next to the water where Lake Brienz glistens a unique, intense shade of turquoise. If you’ve brought swimwear, you’ll have numerous opportunities for a refreshing dip at the idyllic bathing spots scattered along the route. However, please remember that since most of Lake Brienz’s water comes from glaciers, so is one of the coldest lakes in Switzerland. At the Glooten picnic area, we encounter a slightly more challenging ascent, but it’s well worth the effort. As pay-off, we can expect a stunning descent through a ruggedly romantic stand of woodland. From the end of the hike at the Giessbach jetty/lake, choose from a 10-minute climb on foot or board Europe’s oldest funicular railway to take us to the Hotel Giessbach, which offers a unique view of the Giessbach Falls.\n\nBreakfast & dinner included\n\nDistance: 5.4km\n\nElevation gain: 140m\n\nElevation descent: 140m\n\nHighest point: 584m above sea level\n\nThis morning after breakfast at the hotel, we board the Interlaken-Lucerne Express which will take us to the centre of Lucerne. Aboard this two-hour train journey passing through the heart of Switzerland, the journey will take us along crystal clear lakes, waterfalls and over the Brünig Mountain pass. After experiencing some magnificent views of the Swiss Alps on the train, we will have a guided tour of the beautiful city of Lucerne. Known for its stunning location on the edge of Lake Lucerne and amid snow-capped mountains, Lucerne is also known for its medieval architecture, and its most popular feature – the wooden bridge that that spans the width of the river. We also board a boat for a cruise along the coast of the lake. We then return to the hotel via the scenic train we arrived on.\n\nBreakfast included\n\nThe hike today is a circular route at the foot of the Stockhorn. We visit two idyllic mountain lakes, which are also very popular with anglers. Today’s paths are natural trails only.\n\nWe begin our ascent by cable car from Erlenbach to the top of the 2190-metre Stockhorn to witness a spectacular observation point where we’ll view the striking peak that stretches from Jura over Lake Thun and the Swiss Prealps to the High Alps. The sight of Lake Hinterstocken—a gorgeous, glistening expanse of green beneath the midway station—adds to the enjoyment. A circular trail runs around the lake. The rock trail carved into the Mieschfluh takes you to the mountain trail leading to the Vorderstocke. The route then continues down to Lake Oberstocken through lush, verdant alpine meadows, peppered with mighty pines. We follow the trail, which conveniently skims the edge of the water, towards the woodland at the northern tip of the lake. After walking through a wooded limestone valley, carpeted with rare flowers, you will reach Hinterstocke. At Lake Hinterstocken, there are benches and a larger picnic area. Both Lake Hinterstocken and Lake Oberstocken are thronging with rainbow trout, which makes them popular destinations for amateur anglers. From the lake, we climb back up to the Chrindi midway station for the Stockhorn Railway.\n\nBreakfast & dinner included\n\nDistance: 6.2km\n\nElevation gain: 400m\n\nElevation descent: 4000m\n\nHighest point: 1798m above sea level"
