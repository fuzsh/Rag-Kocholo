It covers the country’s geological and tectonic context, together with its climatic context, geomorphological history, structural and karstic landscapes, glacial and periglacial landscapes, landscapes with natural hazards, geomorphology and society, and the preservation of its geomorphological heritage. Richly illustrated, it presents case studies on some of the country’s most famous natural sites, including the Matterhorn, Aletsch Glacier, Sardona Tectonic Arena, and Engadine, among others."
