        "text": "The Sörenberg aerial cableway takes you quicky up to Rossweid where you’ll start running already above the forest. Rolling pastures spread bellow, home to a variety of plants and animals, and a unique biosphere reserve. To the northwest, you see the rocky Schrattenfluh. The first kilometers pass through grasslands full of colorful wildflowers, moor, and Emmental farmhouses with their long angling roofs.\n\nFrom Blattenegg to Chrutere it’s an abrupt change in landscape. This steep section is where you put in the bulk of the gain to reach the Brienzer Rothorn, the highest point in the canton Luzern at 2351m. While passing through the Brienzer Rothorn station, look over your shoulder following the sprawling length of the Brienzergrat/Hardergrat.\n\nA short descent leads towards the Eisee before hovering along the Zwischenegg, another grassy ridgeline that separates the cantons Luzern and Bern. Green rolling farmlands expand north to the Emmental. Off the other side of the ridge, views across the Berner Oberland and big mountains. Below, the Brienzersee and a chain of lakes.\n\nCruising the winding Zwischenegg you reach the final highpoint, Höch Gumme. From here it’s all downhill angling into the grasslands below the ridge you traversed. Follow the Chuterenbach for the final few flat kilometers back to the Sörenberg station."
