Join me for an exciting rock climbing weekend in the impressive Schrattenfluh. Located in the Swiss Alps, this place has it all: stunning views, amazing rocks and delicious food.

Schrattenfluh offers thousands of options for all types of climbers. On this outing, we’ll begin by exploring the green alpine meadows and continue until we reach the ridge between the small and big Emmental. From there, we’ll continue walking for an hour until we reach the hut. There are many rock climbing routes around the hut for climbers with no experience at all, advanced climbers and all sort of practitioners in the middle. We can also go to the summit and back to the hut.

We’ll spend the night at a cozy mountain lodge and enjoy the best meals you’ll ever try in the mountains. The views of the Bernese Alps from the lodge well forever stay with you.

Sound tempting? Then book your trip now and discover this gorgeous location in the Alps for yourself!
