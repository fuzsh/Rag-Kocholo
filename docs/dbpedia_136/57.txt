The approximately 6 km long Schrattenfluh runs - like many other mountain ranges in the Swiss Alps - in northeast-southwest direction.

The mountain range of the Schrattenfluh stands out clearly from the pre-alpine hills of the Emmental and the bowl. The northwest flank of the Schrattenfluh is steep, alternating between bands of rock and mountain pastures. To the southeast the ridge falls off relatively smoothly. There are vast, mostly barren karst where fossils are found. In the area of karst, there are caves.
