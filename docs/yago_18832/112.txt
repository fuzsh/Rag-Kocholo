Television actor Rahul Mahajan, who got married to model Dimpy Ganguly amid much fanfare back in 2010, is on the verge of separation from his model wife.

Mahajan had tied the knot with Ganguly in the reality show "Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayenge". But now, it has emerged that the duo's marriage has hit a rough patch, and the model is now involved with a Dubai-based businessman.

Ganguly is said to have been staying away from Mahajan for about a year now, and has shifted to Dubai to stay close to her boyfriend, who is allegedly a former lover.

"It seems Dimpy knew her current boyfriend even before her marriage to Rahul. She eventually realised that she has fallen out of love with her husband. Even Rahul is aware of the relationship. The two have been staying separately for almost a year now. Dimpy relocated to Dubai around six months back. Though they participated in a couple dance reality show last year, it was all hogwash," The Times of India quoted a friend of the couple.

Another friend stated that the tension in the couple's relationship is known to all of their friends but the duo is expected to file for divorce only after the ongoing elections.

When confronted with the news, Mahajan apparently played down the news and said he is busy with elections.

This has not been the first time that reports of tension between the duo have surfaced. Soon after Mahajan and Dimpy's marriage, the model had come out, accusing the former of physical abuse publicly, though they reconciled later.

Incidentally, Mahajan's first wife Shweta Singh had also accused him of domestic violence for seeking separation back in 2008.
