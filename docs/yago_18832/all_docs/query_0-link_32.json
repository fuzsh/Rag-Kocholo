        "text": "Rahul Mahajan, popularly known for his stint in reality shows like 'Bigg Boss' and 'Swayamvar' has finally broken silence on his divorce with Natalya Ilina. Earlier, he has refrained himself from speaking on his divorce with Natalya. Now, he has finally come forward to speak on his third divorce. He has confirmed the news and said that his 'soul has been torn'.\n\nSpeaking to ETimes, Rahul said it is like a 'big earthquake' in his life and tremors are still somewhere there. ''There is a lot of trauma, but life goes on. You’ve no choice but to be strong.''\n\nTalking about discussing his personal life openly, he said that he may not show it but he is very sensitive. ''Also, I’ve never discussed my personal life, from my father's death till date,'' he said.\n\nAlso Read: Shah Rukh Khan gives witty reply to netizen who questioned advance booking numbers of ‘Jawan’\n\nOn being asked about what went wrong in his marriage with her, he said that if he speak about it, it will be a one-sided story and it will be biased. ''I still have love and respect for her. The love never dies. I’m not in touch with her and I don’t even know where she is But love doesn’t go away just like that.''\n\nHe even revealed that he never paid even a single rupee as an alimony in his divorces with Shweta Singh, Dimpy Ganguly and Natalya Ilina.\n\nSpeaking about his failed marriages, he said that he never grew up thinking that he would get divorced multiple times. No one wants relationships to end. It is painful. My soul has been torn. Sometimes relationships do not work and it is beyond your scope.''\n\nAlso Read: Here's how Shraddha Kapoor wished her 'rockstar baapu' Shakti Kapoor on his birthday\n\nRahul Mahajan rose to fame in 2008 during his stint in the second season of Bigg Boss.
