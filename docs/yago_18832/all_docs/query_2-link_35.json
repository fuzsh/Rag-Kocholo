        "text": "Citation preview\n\nEditors’ Note W\n\ne think one of the strengths of this book is that it features contributors from around the world who explore a television genre that is an international phenomenon. As part of this phenomenon, reality producers tweak their shows to appeal to distinct customs or language in each country where a program will air. So the British version of what became American Idol in the USA contained distinctive British elements that were eliminated from the US version. In analysing this international television genre, we think our readers will benefit from hearing authors discuss reality television in their own distinctive voices. One of our chapters, for instance, probes the ethical duties of television producers to respect the cultural and ethical values of viewers in the countries where those mostly European producers are importing reality shows to non-Western viewers. So if our book’s analysis suggests respect dictates ethical authenticity, we think its words should, too. Therefore, readers will encounter both “amongst” and “among” and “whilst” and “while” depending on where the author lives. We think preserving regional language is the most authentic and respectful way to treat authors – and readers – in a collection that raises ethical issues.\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 7\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 8\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nForeword: The Morality of Amoral TV James Poniewozik\n\nT\n\nhe easy answer to the question: “Is reality TV ethical?” is “of course not.” For starters, reality TV shows – like fictional TV, or any TV series produced commercially – are products. They are a response to economic conditions (the desire among networks, for instance, to fill hours of TV cheaply and to put on shows that will draw an audience). In this sense, it’s as pointless to ask whether reality TV – or any TV genre – is “ethical” as to ask whether running shoes or indexed mutual funds are ethical. That is, sure, they may have ethical effects, but ethics generally don’t enter into their creation. It’s also worth noting that asking “is reality TV ethical?” is about as answerable a question as: “Are books ethical?” Reality TV can encompass anything from teen-pregnancy shows to cooking competitions to shows about addiction to documentary serials to travel and home-design series – everything from Morgan Spurlock’s 30 Days to ABC’s 101 Ways to Leave a Game Show. Arguably, the most widely agreed on definition of “reality TV” is “non-fiction television of which I personally disapprove.” The broader sense of the question really falls more along the lines of: “Does reality TV make us bad people?” Does it send bad messages, does it encourage immorality, does it coarsen social standards, is there shame attached into making, participating in and watching it? Here, the common and quick answer is, “of course” – and the makers of reality TV are the last to discourage it. There is, after all, no more common way to sell a reality show than by suggesting that TV has once again Finally Gone Too Far This Time, or by inviting fans to jeer against an Ultimate Bad Guy, like Simon Cowell or Gordon Ramsay. If there is one thing that reality TV fans generally agree on, it’s that they should be ashamed of themselves for watching it. All of which is to say that to discuss the ethics of reality TV as a yes-or-no, black-and-white question is the most common way of treating the issue, and\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 9\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nx\n\nForeword: The Morality of Amoral TV\n\nthe least useful. On the other hand, if you consider that reality TV – like any product or narrative – has ethics, and ask what those ethics are, the question is much more intriguing, and the results more complicated and surprising. Maybe the most important distinction is between the ethics of reality TV and the ethics in reality TV. The former is a question of whether reality TV shows are made honestly, for instance, or whether they treat their participants in a morally responsible manner. The second is a question of whether they communicate a sense of ethics in their narratives and whether they assume, or even prompt, an ethical response from their audience. The former is important, but in a more narrow sense. There are plenty of examples of disingenuousness in reality TV: there’s misleading editing to create conflict and suspense, and there’s “frankenbyting,” the trick of splicing together quotes from different contexts to make participants say what the producers need them to. (This does not mean, by the way, that audiences are oblivious to the manipulation; half the spectator sport of watching many reality shows, for instance, is second-guessing the editing and misdirection.) More egregiously, reality shows can create dangerous situations or at least encourage them, whether by plying house-guests with booze or making entertainment out of addiction or extreme weight-loss competitions. But reality show participants are still a relatively small segment of the workforce; whether your reality programming is “ethical” in this sense is probably a lesser question – in terms of absolute human effects – than, say, whether the restaurants you get takeout from are ethical toward their employees. The reality TV audience is a much bigger group, and the messages this audience receives from reality TV are much more complex, as are the ways in which viewers receive and interpret them. When it comes to the messages embedded in their narratives and the reactions they assume on the part of the audience, many supposedly depraved reality shows are, in fact, among the most moralizing series on TV. A classic case-in-point is the ur-reality competition on broadcast TV, Survivor. Superficially, its premise is amoral in the extreme: You lie, manipulate and betray your teammates to win. Self-preservation is the prime value – “Outwit, Outplay, Outlast” – and, as many finalists have argued to the Tribal Council, it is its own justification: It’s “playing the game,” and therefore acceptable and admirable. But that analysis only examines Survivor as a game. It’s more than that: it’s a spectator sport, viewed by millions of people, and the series depends upon those people to have a strong moral investment in and reaction to the story in order to stay involved. Each season involves heated arguments – on and off-screen – about what it really means to “deserve” to win. Seasons are\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 10\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nForeword: The Morality of Amoral TV\n\nxi\n\noften structured as moral experiments (tribes have been divided by gender, age and race or ethnicity) or as morality plays (e.g. the “Heroes vs. villains” season). The show has long recognized not just the winners of seasons but “fan favorites,” a nod to the idea that the audience will sympathize with players they believed to have lost honorably. Survivor, in other words, assumes that you, the audience member, have an independent system of moral values that is most likely different from the one rewarded by the game, and that that conflict is at least part of what makes the season engaging. That a work of pop culture should make that kind of assumption shouldn’t surprise us – and when it comes to “higher” genres like fiction, it doesn’t. If Mad Men or Boardwalk Empire depicts sexism, or violence, or self-destructive behavior, it’s nuanced story-telling. But if a reality show does the same thing, it’s immoral, misanthropic or bigoted. We assume that the audiences of HBO or FX dramas (or for that matter, readers of Crime and Punishment or Lolita) can empathize with the protagonists without wanting to emulate them; we assume they can maintain a critical distance from the narratives and perceive ironies between the characters’ words and their actions. Why? Because we assume that someone who watches Breaking Bad is smarter, more mature – better – than someone who watches Jersey Shore. Scratch a criticism of reality TV, and often enough you’ll find a criticism of the reality-TV audience. Often too, its provocative premise is 90 percent of the battle for a reality show. Some celebrate fame for its own sake (Keeping Up With the Kardashians), others valorize the kind of blue-collar workers who rarely show up on sitcoms anymore (Deadliest Catch). Many are based on offensive or morally questionable premises – Joe Millionaire, for instance, or Toddlers and Tiaras – but they also require a strong and diverse response to create the arguments that keep the shows alive. Mike Darnell and Lauren Zalaznick may not be the Swifts and Twains of our age, but much effective reality TV is really satire boiled down to one extreme gesture. It takes a commonplace piety and skewers it: that team spirit is the key to winning (Survivor), that everyone has a special talent (American Idol, in particular the audition rounds), that success goes to the deserving (The Real Housewives of Pretty Much Anywhere). Whether reality TV is good TV – that is another question, with as many answers as there are shows. The concept of goodness, however, is alive and well, and the subject of eager debate, among the reality audience. The viewers of reality TV are among the first to cite the genre as evidence that our culture is going to hell. But the controversy, argument and snark that reality TV inspires are vital proof that we have not arrived there yet.\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 11\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 12\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nIntroduction: Reality TV Matters Wendy N. Wyatt and Kristie Bunton\n\nPopular Culture and Reality TV Demand Ethical Analysis\n\nT\n\nhe Ethics of Reality TV is a book about popular culture, and – not surprisingly – we think pop culture should be taken seriously. Why? Consider the following reasons. First, popular culture is, well, popular. It attracts mass audiences like no other kind of culture. In his study of a favorite pop culture text, American Idol, Christopher Bell noted that the show draws more than 25 million viewers per episode. This is equal to the combined populations of Colorado, Maryland, Missouri, Minnesota and Wisconsin, and it exceeds the population of Australia.1 For the first time in 2010, “worldwide viewers watched more reality TV and entertainment shows than dramas and TV series,”2 and reality shows consistently dominate ratings. In the summer of 2010, for example, 15 of the top 20 highest-rated American programs (for viewers 18 to 49 years old) were reality shows.3 We think any cultural product with this kind attention-getting power should be taken seriously. Second, pop culture can and should be accepted and appreciated as “real” culture. Some of the first scholars to study pop culture saw it as “low” culture with little value. In the late 1930s, for example, Frankfurt School theorist Max Horkheimer declared: “What today is called popular entertainment is actually demands evoked, manipulated, and, by implication, deteriorated by the cultural industries. It has little to do with art, least of all where it pretends to be such.”4 Although the Frankfurt School made important contributions to our understanding of communication, this wholesale rejection of pop culture takes an elitist perspective (even as Frankfurt School theorists fought against\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 1\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n2 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\nelitism) that we reject. Instead, we think any cultural artifact – whether it represents “high” culture, “low” culture, or something in between – should be taken seriously because it tells us something about the actual culture in which we live. Third, pop culture is, or can be, entertaining. But it isn’t just entertainment. It is ideologically, socially and economically oriented, and it is “an extension of the people from whom it springs and for whom it is created.”5 In other words, popular culture can tell us a lot about ourselves. As Jeffrey Bineham noted, the texts and artifacts of popular culture “are constantly telling us how to think, how to dress, how to talk, what vocations are significant, and what we should do politically and economically; in sum, they tell us who to be.”6 We think any message with this kind of power to illuminate and influence us should be taken seriously. Finally, pop culture has ethical implications. As the ten chapters in this book will show, the texts of reality TV are ethically laden, and they matter in ways that have real influence on our ethical lives. Popular culture works to shape the minds and souls of those of us who consume it. Therefore, the claim that reality TV is “just entertainment” or “nothing more than low culture” is really just a way of avoiding serious consideration of an increasingly important form of communication, and it’s a way of letting reality TV off the ethical hook. Reality television – like all communication – helps shape the way we view and interact with the world, helps make that world meaningful, and even helps construct that world. As James Carey so eloquently stated: “Communication is a symbolic process whereby reality is produced, maintained, repaired and transformed.”7 When we watch reality TV, we are taking part in a ritual that – strange as it may sound – helps bring reality to life. Yes, reality TV may be showing us the reality around us, but it’s also helping us create our reality. After all, as Carey said, reality itself is “a vast production, a staged creation – something humanly produced and humanly maintained” through communication.8 Clearly, anything with the power to construct reality should be taken seriously.\n\nReality TV is Complicated In this book, therefore, we seriously consider reality television and the ethical questions it raises. We deliberately avoid condemning reality television. That’s too ethically lazy to do, and even if it weren’t, reality TV is far too complex to justify a blanket condemnation. In the Foreword to this book, Time magazine television critic James Poniewozik wrote “to discuss the ethics of reality\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 2\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nIntroduction: Reality TV Matters\n\n3\n\ntelevision as a yes-or-no, black-and-white question is the most common way of treating this issue, and the least useful.” He went on to say: “On the other hand, if you consider that reality TV – like any product or narrative – has ethics, and ask what those ethics are, the question is much more intriguing, and the results more complicated and surprising.” We think that’s exactly what this book will show: that the ethical analysis of reality television is complicated and surprising. While we recognize that there is a reality TV genre, we think it’s unwise to evaluate all of the ethical issues that reality TV raises on the level of genre alone. Reality television is a complex, broad and evolving genre that resists easy definition. Most of us recognize as reality TV the contest shows such as Project Runway, The Amazing Race and American Idol, but we can see those shows have little in common with family-oriented narratives like Jon and Kate Plus 8, 19 Kids and Counting or Little People, Big World, which we know are not similar to shows about offbeat occupations like Pawn Stars, Ice Road Truckers or Cake Boss. If we try to compare the self-improvement shows like What Not to Wear, Shedding for the Wedding and Biggest Loser with the philanthropy shows like Extreme Makeover: Home Edition, Three Wishes or Secret Millionaire, we easily see how hard it can be to decide exactly what makes something a reality show. This book demonstrates an important point: reality television as a genre is complicated and cannot be analyzed as if it were a monolithic programming category. As if the complexity created by a genre that encompasses such a broad variety of program types were not enough, complexity is further created within individual reality programs. That complexity arises because the programs use different techniques and emphasize different approaches. Some reality shows are nearly fiction. They are manipulated and edited in ways that twist the very reality they purport to present. At times, the “real” events they depict seem orchestrated with a heavier hand than the most melodramatic of soap operas. (The Bachelor, with its exaggerated dates and sensationalized relationships that never culminate in an actual marriage, is a ready example of such a fictionalized reality show.) Some reality shows are nearly journalism or documentary. They tell stories in a straightforward way about the lives of real people that traditional television news outlets have failed to show us and that socially responsible journalists ought to present to the communities they serve. (The informational look at a polygamous family provided by Sister Wives is an example.) Furthermore, complexity among reality TV shows varies from season to season and participant to participant. In the UK, for instance, the 2007 season of Celebrity Big Brother generated a firestorm of public criticism, international news coverage, advertiser defection and government disapproval when\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 3\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n4 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\nparticipants, stirred up by the boorish reality celebrity Jade Goody, repeatedly made racist remarks about the manners, accent and appearance of their fellow participant, the Indian actress Shilpa Shetty. Despite this obvious lapse into ethically unacceptable stereotyping and exploitation by the program, all seasons of Celebrity Big Brother cannot automatically be classified as unethical. Each season and each participant requires ethical analysis. Any reality program and its participants can be simultaneously ethical and unethical, just as any television news story or daily soap opera can be. Media texts, including reality TV, are marked by complexity that demands thoughtful ethical scrutiny. Because reality TV is complex in all these ways, the ethical questions probed in this book apply differently to different reality programs and participants. For example, the questions Madeleine Esch poses in her chapter about privacy can be applied differently to reality celebrity Bethenny Frankel when viewing her as a participant in The Real Housewives of New York City, as the title figure in Bethenny Getting Married, as a new parent in Bethenny Ever After, or as a contestant in Dancing with the Stars. That’s just one ethical topic applied to one perennial reality participant. We also think the complexity of reality TV demands that the chapters in this book not be read in isolation from one another. Reading only Bastiaan Vanacker’s chapter on commercialization or Deni Elliott’s chapter on democracy building, for example, gives only part of the picture. A sophisticated understanding of the ethics of reality TV requires a wide-ranging understanding. In other words, the whole is greater than the sum of the individual parts. Reading this book as a coherent whole and comparing the chapters with one another will help build the broad understanding needed for a mature analysis of reality TV’s ethics. For instance, Mira Desai’s chapter on imposing cultural values and Gareth Palmer’s on community are significant on their own, but a richer understanding of the issues emerges from comparing the two. We think we’ve covered some of the most important ethical issues in this book, but we’re sure there are others – those that the genre has already uncovered and those that new shows will inevitably bring to the surface. Our hope is that this book will help foster thoughtful analysis of existing and newly emerging ethical issues as well as encourage sophisticated consumption (and, ideally, creation) of reality TV. We’ll come back to that idea at the end of the book, after our chapters have posed what we think are the crucial questions about the ethics of reality television. But now, let’s get to the questions.\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 4\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nIntroduction: Reality TV Matters\n\n5\n\nNotes 1 Christopher A.

Good stories often capture and convey aspects of us and our moral lives far beyond what logical analysis could ever hope to touch.2 The best stories, thus, are inherently normative: they can make our lives better, both through what they teach us and in how they enrich our lives with their beauty. Stories, even the best ones – the technically best, the rhetorically best, the emotively best – can also, of course, make our lives much worse. They can create or exacerbate bigotry and xenophobia. They can dumb us down. They can scare us into inaction or, worse, into taking dreadful action – recall General Colin Powell’s great story before the United Nations Security Council in 2003, which provided the Bush Administration’s (purported) justification for invading Iraq. Stories can be told through a wide range of media – oral narratives, plays, songs, novels, newspaper accounts, film and reality TV – and there is no inherent moral difference among them. Theatre can be exploitive and demeaning – consider myriad live sex shows – or raise us to the heights of a William Shakespeare, Eugene O’Neill or Tony Kushner. Television, similarly,\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 7\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n8 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\ncan appeal to our basest instincts (think Temptation Island, The Swan and Joe Millionaire) or challenge us intellectually, emotionally and politically (think The Wire, All in the Family and West Wing). The task given to me with this chapter is to try to determine whether watching reality TV is consistent with a life of ethical excellence or areté.3 For reality TV to be so consistent, it has to satisfy three criteria: (i) it has to contribute to (or at least not undercut) the elements that contribute to excellence; (ii) it cannot cause undue harm; and (iii) it cannot treat persons with disrespect. My conclusion: reality TV is not inconsistent with areté; that is, reality TV, in its current form at least, does not significantly violate either of the central ethical conditions (avoid harm and respect persons), nor – assuming one has balance in one’s life – does it essentially corrupt any of the elements. In fact, I take the conclusion a step further: Some reality TV actually contributes to an ethical life in the same way other good narratives do, namely, by directly promoting three of the elements: learning, sociality and pleasurable play. Excellence, however, certainly falls along a continuum with respect both to a life’s overall flourishing and to the individual elements that contribute to it. Thus, while some shows detract from areté – either by promoting conditions that diminish flourishing or by treating others as mere means – as long as, again, there is sufficient balance, watching even those shows does not wholly corrupt one’s excellence. Reality TV does not corrupt one’s excellence because our lives are always in development, moving (one hopes) toward a more excellent state and because very few reality shows will completely fall on one end of the continuum or the other – Pawn Stars is no Iron Chef America, but at least it is better than Jersey Shore,4 which also has at least some redeeming features. The bulk of reality shows reside in the middle, partly contributing to and partly detracting from a flourishing life. Hence, one more time, balance: “It is better to rise from life as from a banquet neither thirsty nor drunken.”5 That reality shows fall on a continuum of flourishing features is part of the reason I think my analysis here has only modest practical import. I do not suggest, for example, that those shows that fall below some mid-point moral criterion should be subjected to social censure, or at least no censure beyond that provided by a marketplace that can choose to shun them. Rather, I see the argument’s primary value as contributing to efforts to increase media literacy, a principal research goal of at least one of this book’s editors:6 The better evaluative tools we have, the better choices we can make and the better we can be at guiding others, especially parents, to make good viewing choices. Those familiar with the Western tradition in moral theory will recognize I do not rely on a single theoretician. Rather, I use a method of moral reasoning7\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 8\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nFlourishing: Reality TV and a Life of Ethical Excellence\n\n9\n\nthat incorporates the insights from the three major camps: (i) Immanuel Kant’s respect for the inherent value of moral rules, especially, here, his “Kingdom of Ends” formulation of the categorical imperative (never treat persons as a mere means, or tool, for the benefit of others, but always as absolutely valuable “ends in themselves”); (ii) John Stuart Mill’s utilitarian exhortation to act so as to promote the greatest aggregate pleasure, particularly higher or intellectual pleasure; and (iii) Aristotle’s virtue theory with its call to each of us to develop our character, to strive for moral and intellectual excellence. One last introductory point is that how one characterizes “reality television” certainly influences the analysis. Should, for example, Keeping Up with the Kardashians (a show celebrating the antics of a family famous, seemingly, for being famous) be included in the same conceptual category as, say, Mythbusters (which humorously uses a scientific method to test the plausibility of various urban and Hollywood myths)? Both are non-fiction television programs that ostensibly reflect unfiltered, if not unedited, reality and neither relies on professional actors. They are otherwise, however, far apart in content, structure and quality. Whereas one might wish for an analytic or conceptual definition of reality TV, one that would provide a neat method for clear distinctions, the subject matter simply makes that implausible; the range of types of shows is too wide (and is being expanded almost weekly). My definition, thus, is sociological or descriptive;8 it appeals to how people – producers, critics, journalists, participants and viewers – refer to it. Namely: Reality TV is at least largely unscripted, normally relies on untrained actors, and purports to provide a narrative of ordinary life. This liberal definition also avoids the straw person of focusing only on the worst; a more inclusive definition – keeping Mythbusters9 alongside Kardashians – captures the diverse mix and complexity of the genre. The more inclusive definition is thus both fairer and, it turns out, more sympathetic to reality TV. Within the array of programs that qualify, some morally enhance while others demean, and persons’ lives are made ethically better when they partake of the former and avoid the latter, or at least when they more frequently do so. Getting to this conclusion requires some foundational work. First, I provide an argument for the relative values of higher and lower pleasures; second, I claim that persons have a duty to strive for arête; and third, I give a brief description of the full set of elements that contribute to areté, with a discussion of how they must in turn be guided by character and practical wisdom. With these elements in place, I then return to show that reality TV can promote some of those conditions, while not fully contradicting any. The last step is to test watching reality TV against the ethical conditions (avoid harm and respect persons), from which I conclude, again, that done in moderation, reality TV is not inconsistent with an excellent life.\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 9\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n10 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\nHigher and Lower Pleasures In line with the utilitarian tradition, I take all pleasure to be good, as long as it does not violate the ethical conditions. However, as Mill makes clear, some pleasures are better than others; namely, the higher, intellectual, pleasures are better than the lower, the physical. The higher pleasures are exemplified in many of the elements that make up areté, and they help create the mental capacities necessary for practical wisdom, via which appreciation of those elements is made possible. In short, they are the features that distinguish persons from other animals. The argument for this (admittedly elitist) view comes from well-known passages in Mill’s Utilitarianism: Human beings have faculties more elevated than the animal appetites, and when once made conscious of them, do not regard anything as happiness which does not include their gratification. . . It is quite compatible with the principle of utility to recognise the fact that some kinds of pleasure are more desirable and more valuable than others. . . If I am asked, what I mean by difference of quality in pleasures, or what makes one pleasure more valuable than another. . . there is but one possible answer. Of two pleasures, if there be one to which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure. . . [Thus] it is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question.10 Much of reality TV gets its appeal through stimulation of the lower pleasures, through erotic titillation, voyeurism and a vicarious amusement with characters’ sexual, alcoholic and violent antics. Contrast this with activities that stimulate physical and mental pleasure – say a great meal with fine, smart friends. Paraphrasing Mill’s argument, those who know and appreciate both kinds of pleasure, those who are essentially experts on the subject, know the latter to be a better pleasure, “and if the fool, or the pig, are of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question.” Further, even if for whatever reason one does not immediately experience the intellectual pleasures as better, one’s capacity for flourishing has been enhanced, as per the argument above. I am not saying, mind you, that physical pleasures are inherently degrading or debased; life would not be as rich, as excellent, without great sex, good\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 10\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nFlourishing: Reality TV and a Life of Ethical Excellence\n\n11\n\nwine and hot fudge sundaes. But a life devoted only, or even mainly, to the physical is incomplete.\n\nA Normative Approach to Flourishing Mill expands upon the “higher pleasures” argument in On Liberty, where he shows how human enhancement, “development,” occurs through the exercise of such intellectual activities. These produce, he says, “different experiments of living,” in which, the human faculties of perception, judgment, discriminative feeling, mental activity, and even moral preference, are exercised only in making a choice. He who does anything because it is the custom, makes no choice. He gains no practice either in discerning or in desiring what is best... It is not by wearing down into uniformity all that is individual in themselves, but by cultivating it and calling it forth, within the limits imposed by the rights and interests of others, that human beings become a noble and beautiful object of contemplation. . . Having said that individuality is the same thing with development, and that it is only the cultivation of individuality which produces, or can produce, well-developed human beings, I might here close the argument: for what more or better can be said of any condition of human affairs, than that it brings human beings themselves nearer to the best thing they can be?11 Despite these eloquent exhortations to self-cultivation, Mill’s moral theory provides at best a weak duty of self-improvement: personal development makes us better people, more interesting, and better able thereby to push society forward. But we have every right to choose to be “ape-like,” mere imitators of others.12 The most that can be said is that the processes by which development emerges – “He must use observation to see, reasoning and judgment to foresee, activity to gather materials for decision, discrimination to decide, and when he has decided, firmness and self-control to hold to his deliberate decision”13 – are also the tools by which we develop the wisdom and judgment needed to more accurately determine which options, in any given scenario, are more likely to produce aggregate pleasure. I thus add to Mill’s arguments W. D. Ross’s dictum that we in fact have a strong prima facie duty of self-improvement: “Some [duties] rest on the fact that we can improve our own condition in respect of virtue or of intelligence.”14 From this combination I get my theoretical starting point: persons\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 11\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n12 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\nshould strive to enhance their lives so as to achieve areté. Our lives are better, richer, fuller and we thrive more, when we develop our physical and mental capacities to their greater potential. Without this normative conception of flourishing, the moral analysis of reality TV, or of any form of entertainment for that matter, would be pretty straightforward: as long as some, any, people enjoy it, as long as no one is significantly harmed by it, and as long as it does not treat others as mere means, it is morally good. I argue, however, that we also have a duty to strive for more excellent lives, to (again quoting Ross) “improve our own condition in respect of [among other things] virtue or of intelligence.” Doing so not only provides us with (higher) pleasure, but it also endows us with the discernment to more wisely improve our moral relations with others and to thereby improve society. Now, the harm and respect caveats are potentially major obstacles to ethically approving of reality TV. As I will argue below, however, even though many shows violate one or both of these conditions, none appear to do so in a way that would make the shows unethical. But that conclusion does not settle the question. The character approach outlined here stresses that a full understanding of our moral lives requires going beyond such impact on others; we need also to evaluate how watching reality TV contributes to or detracts from our own characters.\n\nFlourishing Characterized What, then, are the conditions that produce flourishing lives? I provide the full list for a number of reasons. First, the elements are open to interpretation, with such evaluation potentially affecting the subsequent conclusions about areté and reality TV. My version is based on Aristotle’s, on contemporary literature on happiness, and on wise friends’ and colleagues’ comments. Any given reader, however, might disagree with my reasoning. Second, such disagreement should emerge only after careful reflection on what makes for a life of excellence – a worthy exercise in its own right. Third, even if the reader were to fully embrace my list, she or he might disagree with the relationship between the various elements and reality TV, again potentially producing a different overall conclusion. That said, I move through the full list pretty quickly, later coming back to a much more developed analysis of the three most relevant to the discussion at hand: learning, sociality and playing. I also divide them into what philosophers call necessary, sufficient and enhancing conditions, i.e. respectively,\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 12\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nFlourishing: Reality TV and a Life of Ethical Excellence\n\n13\n\nthose that must be present for excellence, those that are not necessary, but on their own satisfy all the elements, and those that are neither necessary nor sufficient, but can enhance persons’ lives in often profound ways. Furthermore, with all these conditions, there is an assumption of adequate material circumstances and good fortune. In short, one cannot engage in any of what follows unless one has a roof over one’s head, food in one’s mouth (and in one’s children’s), and at least minimal health. By the same token, one has to have adequate luck: For there is required [for happiness], as we said, not only complete virtue but also a complete life, since many changes occur in life, and all manner of chances, and the most prosperous may fall into great misfortunes in old age, as is told of Priam in the Trojan Cycle; and one who has experienced such chances and has ended wretchedly no one calls happy.15\n\nNecessary Conditions MM\n\nSocial relations: having friends to share good conversation, good food and drink; to play with; to support and to be supported by.\n\nMM\n\nChallenge and achievement: establishing goals, or being thrust into a taxing circumstance, and working hard to overcome the obstacles and to succeed.16\n\nMM\n\nLearning: being committed to enhancing one’s knowledge and skills, whether done formally or informally.\n\nMM\n\nContemplation: thinking more about life’s meaning and value than about political ambition or about how to procure a wider flat-screen television.\n\nMM\n\nPlay: engaging in physical play, intellectual play, emotional play, sexual play – done pleasurably, freely and for its own sake, with no goal of producing a secondary outcome (though it often does enhance, and thus overlap with, social relations).\n\nSufficient Conditions MM\n\nWork: being engaged by work, real work, that challenges, makes us better, teaches us, and connects us with others; i.e. it satisfies each of the necessary elements. Because, however, for most humans,\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 13\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n14 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\nwork is instrumental only (assuming it is even available) – i.e. it is a means to, rather than a reason for, living – the type of work described here cannot be a necessary condition. MM\n\nFamily: reveling in the great love, joy, pride and sorrow that come with family relations. Those relations are often amply rich with intellectual and character-enhancing components, and can thereby be a sufficient criterion. They cannot, however, be a necessary one because one can achieve all those components through friendships.17\n\nEnriching elements MM\n\nSpirituality: embracing that there is much beyond our narrow frame of reference, whether that is obtained through a religious reality, or experienced in the wonders of artistic expression, or appreciated through the sublimity of nature grasped while knee deep in a trout stream.18 Because such experiences need not include a social element and are generally not perceived as playful, spirituality is not a sufficient condition, even if it often challenges, teaches and motivates contemplation.\n\nMM\n\nResources: having a minimal level is, as discussed above, a necessary condition; beyond that, resources – particularly money – provide opportunities, opportunities for more contemplation, more play, more learning and more access to great art and trout streams. Money alone cannot make one happy,19 but it can sure as heck make getting there easier and more fun.\n\nA life of excellence and flourishing, thus, is one lived actively and fully; it is rich with ongoing educational opportunities, challenges (including challenging work), critical contemplation and play; and it is filled with fine companions. These elements, though, must also be guided by two other conditions: character and practical wisdom. Character means being committed to an honourable existence; that is, being habituated to virtue, to seeking and living by the mean between excess and deficiency, as dictated by the circumstances attached to the individual and the situation, and as expressed in a life of honesty, benevolence, non-malevolence, respecting others, courage, fidelity, perseverance, fairness and personal accountability. Practical wisdom, or phronesis, is the discerning judgment gained through rational reflection upon experience and the teaching of others. Such judgment\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 14\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nFlourishing: Reality TV and a Life of Ethical Excellence\n\n15\n\nhelps one to better choose from among the many competing options in life (including watching reality TV), to evaluate what is in fact the mean between extremes in given cases (how much reality TV should one watch?), and to more accurately predict the consequences of one’s choices (what gets left undone while one watches?). While the acquisition of practical wisdom is never complete – one can always gain new insights from new experiences and critical reflection – on Aristotle’s account, one cannot be virtuous, and thus one cannot flourish, unless one has some (undefined and probably indefinable) minimum. All this once again reinforces the point that none of the elements of areté is reducible to an either/or. Rather, one can be more or less virtuous and wise, and, through them, more or less social, playful, etc. An excellent life is always in development: Assuming one has the right kind of commitment, has adequate material conditions, is sufficiently fortunate, and has at least a minimal level of practical wisdom, one’s life is continually progressing. That commitment entails hard work, a striving for ever more wisdom and better habituated virtue.\n\nReality TV and a Flourishing Life The requirement for the hard work needed for continuing development might seem to force the conclusion that reality TV is inconsistent with an excellent life. While it is obviously pure speculation, my reading of Aristotle and Mill is that they would both reach that conclusion, given their respective arguments about education (already detailed, above) and given the distinction they each draw between animals and humans – animals cannot, they say, be happy because they cannot contemplate and because they cannot be active and free choosers. Aristotle makes this clear in his discussion of why contemplation is necessary for excellence: “The other animals have no share in happiness, being completely deprived of [rationally critical] activity. For while the whole life of the gods is blessed, and that of men too in so far as some likeness of such activity belongs to them, none of the other animals is happy, since they in no way share in contemplation.”20 Watching reality TV, Aristotle and Mill would likely say, is equivalent to an animal’s level of cognition. It thus fails the test of contemplation and thus is inconsistent with an excellent life. That conclusion seems to me too elitist. Most devotees of particular shows and characters (and certainly all those preoccupied by them) are critically and actively engaged with the story line – with how their favorite characters work to overcome obstacles, with how antagonists make favorites’ lives more\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 15\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n16 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\ndifficult, with the struggles of characters’ love lives.21 While that level of critical engagement is obviously limited, it is certainly beyond that of animals and, to my mind, meets the minimal condition necessary for contemplation. Thus, watching reality TV – assuming the ethical conditions – is not inconsistent with an excellent life.\n\nReality TV as Enhancing Areté That tepid conclusion – that reality TV is not inconsistent with excellence – in fact does not go far enough. Some watching of some reality TV can enhance excellence, in particular through the conditions of learning, sociality and play. In this section I thus give more detailed accounts of each and show their link to reality TV.22\n\nLearning The “lifelong learning” movement has become almost a cliché, but its roots are found in philosophically sophisticated notions of moral maturity, character development and an ethical life. Examples abound,23 but I will stick with this paper’s two main theoretical sources. In Aristotle’s case, we get the argument that young children are not capable of genuine reasoning;24 they need to have their intellectual skills refined through teaching and practice and their moral virtues developed through role-modelling and habituation. In other words, education is indispensible to both the intellectual and moral virtues that are necessary for a developed character. Similarly, and given his own upbringing25 no surprise, Mill was adamant about the importance of learning for personal development and cultivation of one’s fullest self.26 For instance, in On Liberty – a book putatively dedicated to urging that people should largely be left to their own devices – he stresses education’s importance throughout: In the Introduction he (disturbingly) concludes “despotism is a legitimate mode of government in dealing with barbarians,” given their uneducated and “backward” condition;27 in Chapter 3, he discusses the demanding tools28 needed for proper reasoning (tools available only after extensive education); and in Chapter 5, he both insists that free persons can have their liberty properly constrained when they are uninformed about a particular concern or threat,29 and that education should be compulsory.30 If, as suggested above, our lives are always in development, if we are never fully “cultivated,” then we should never stop learning. It is clear some\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 16\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nFlourishing: Reality TV and a Life of Ethical Excellence\n\n17\n\nreality TV is educational, if often in a playful way. Instances range from nature shows, to cooking competitions, to home improvement programs. One of my favorites is Mythbusters, where one can learn everything from the fact that elephants really are afraid of mice, to the plausible idea that torpedoes were used in the thirteenth century, to the notion that it’s safe to yodel in avalanche-prone country. In short, reality TV plainly can motivate learning and it thereby provides a key element of excellence.\n\nSociality Aristotle’s familiar characterization of humans as political (and rational) animals was meant to stress our social nature; we cannot be complete as humans, let alone achieve areté, without social relations. The view is also now widely accepted in psychological literature on happiness, as summarized by Luigino Bruno: There has been increasing appreciation within psychology of the fundamental importance of supportive interpersonal relationships for well-being and happiness. This dimension is so important that some theorists have defined ‘relatedness’ as a basic human need that is essential for wellbeing. In particular within the so-called ‘eudaimonic’ approach, many authors see a universal association between the quality of relationships and subjective well-being.31 When they are richly connected with others, people are happier (both dispositionally and as part of a deeper contentment), less lonely and feel a greater satisfaction in life. This is why sociality is a necessary condition of a flourishing life, and, as noted above, watching reality TV has become, for many, a very social activity. As of this writing, 10,816,947 people have “liked” Jersey Shore’s Facebook page, through which they also “friend” one another and “converse” over the show’s minutiae. Through all this they “come together,” cementing old and creating new friendships. The scare quotes indicate how these social activities diverge from their pre-network equivalents, but, however different, the activities are still unquestionably social. The sociality created by reality TV is in fact like that created through being sports fans. Complete strangers feel wholly connected to one another only because they are rooting for the same team (and are alienated from, even hostile to, the opposition’s players and fans). While such sociality may lack the richness and active contemplation of deep friendships,32 assuming other, richer, interpersonal relations exist in our lives, there is no plausible exclusion\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 17\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n18 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\nof reality TV as a potentially important contributor to the sociality needed for flourishing.\n\nPlaying Again, Aristotle: “To amuse oneself in order that one may exert oneself. . . seems right; for amusement is a sort of relaxation, and we need relaxation because we cannot work continuously. Relaxation, then, is not an end; for it is taken for the sake of activity.”33 As with all features of flourishing, balance is crucial; too much playing disrupts the efforts needed for achievement of the other conditions, but some activity done simply for the fun of it, with no external purpose, makes life better. I break from Aristotle in that I do not think “amusement” need be done (only) so “that one may exert oneself. . . for the sake of activity.” Rather, play is an end in itself – fun for fun’s sake – but also a means to other goods, including learning, connecting with nature, enhancing relationships and making for more productive work. But precisely because play is not otherwise productive, it is all the more critical that participation in it not violate the central ethical conditions. Play done at others’ expense, that intentionally hurts others, or is achieved only by demeaning others, is still conceptually play, but because it is done viciously, it reduces the player’s virtue and thereby detracts from a flourishing life. As I will argue below, some reality TV seems to rely upon the humiliation of others. Play done only, or even primarily, with that as its goal is thus not consistent with contributing to flourishing.\n\nAvoiding Harm and Respect for Others So, watching even the more crass versions of reality TV is not inconsistent with an ethical life; some shows can even contribute to it, assuming a balanced life and assuming, in all cases, the principles of harm avoidance and respect are not violated. Violation of these ethical conditions would defeat any flourishing enhancement. But that caveat is also messy. How much harm is too much? How disrespectfully must persons be treated? What would count as genuine balance? There is no cookie-cutter answer to any of these questions, but the easiest is the balance question because its answer will always be contextual, dictated by the individual’s circumstances, capacities and opportunities. That is, the answer will be, can only be, revealed through a practically wise analysis of that individual and her or his context. Someone who is leading a reasonably\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 18\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nFlourishing: Reality TV and a Life of Ethical Excellence\n\n19\n\nactive, virtuous, socially rich life can no doubt “afford” some brain-dead reality TV time, just as that person can afford time watching How I Met Your Mother, or pouring over baseball stats, or reading trashy books. The person without such a life probably has bigger things to worry about than her or his fascination with some reality TV show or star. On the harm question, reality TV shows cannot cause their participants significant physical, emotional or economic harm, unless they genuinely consent to that threat because any associated flourishing afforded to viewers would be built on the backs – maybe quite literally – of those participants. I will expand on the “genuine consent” criterion in the respect argument, below; by “significant,” I mean such harm that a reasonable group of persons (e.g. a jury) would deem to be profound enough as to warrant compensation, for instance in the form of restitution. The question of harm to viewers is much more problematic. While there is plenty of noise on the topic, 34 genuine scholarship showing a causal relationship between reality TV and individual or social harms is pretty thin. If such a connection can in fact be established, one would, I assume, appeal to a standard process of moral reasoning to determine whether the harms are significant enough to warrant the sorts of restrictions already in place for shows with age-inappropriate sexuality or violence (e.g. time of day and cable versus broadcast). On the respect question, much of reality TV clearly uses persons as a means. Many shows entice people to bare their worst behaviours and character flaws to millions through such enticements as a potential mate, fame or fortune and viewers clearly revel in these participants’ misdeeds and misfortunes. That is, participants are distinctly used both for producers’ profit and for viewers’ entertainment. Even talent competition shows like American Idol have a built-in tension between humiliating some participants and revelling in the achievements and skill of others. But recall Kant’s dictum is against using persons as mere means. He recognized that we justly use one another all the time; our relationships typically include some transactional aspect. For example, we use a grocery check-out clerk to purchase our goods or a bank teller to manage our financial transactions; students use faculty to learn and faculty use students for a paycheck; romantic partners use one another for intimacy, sexual gratification and financial stability. These relationships, however, do not violate the dictum as long as all participants genuinely consent to the activity. That is, we use persons as mere means when they are either coerced into the transaction, when they do not have adequate information to be able to freely choose, or when they could not coherently consent.35 Much of the concern over reality TV is that it uses people in such a degrading manner that it is hard to imagine how they could have genuinely\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 19\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n20 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\nconsented. How could one freely choose to debase oneself so, to submit oneself to the humiliation offered up by someone like Simon Cowell?36 But such denigration exists across the reality TV spectrum. For example, Jennifer L. Pozner discusses a contestant on The Bachelor:37 a vegetarian [who] described eating meat for the first time in 12 years just because Andrew Firestone (star of “The Bachelor’s” third season) fed it to her. ‘My stomach will never be the same,’ she said, grateful for the crumbs. After she got the heave-ho, she batted her big brown eyes at the camera and moaned: ‘You wanna see a girl that’s crushed, you got her.’38 Pozner’s general thesis, in fact, is that much of reality TV’s structure is built around the humiliation of women. So, again, how could one freely choose to be so humiliated? The answer is it does not matter how you or I feel about participating in the activity. As this book’s chapter on exploitation also notes, as long as reality participants know what they are getting into and they are not coerced, their participation is freely undertaken. That the humiliating structure is so apparent speaks to participants’ being adequately informed,39 and since enticement cannot be reasonably seen as coercion, participation is sufficiently voluntary. In other words, even if the vast majority of us might think the choices degrading, the mere means standard is not violated. From the perspective of the viewer, however, getting pleasure from the humiliation of others can never admit of a virtuous mean: Not every action nor every passion admits of a mean; for some have names that already imply badness, e.g. spite, shamelessness, envy and in the case of actions adultery, theft, murder; for all of these and suchlike things imply by their names that they are themselves bad and not the excesses or deficiencies of them. It is not possible, then, ever to be right with regard to them; one must always be wrong.40 I do not, though, know of any shows where humiliation is the entire focus; even those that promote it, also depend on glee at other characters’ eventual successes. Or even the same person’s – recall Susan Boyle’s appearance on the British reality TV show, Britain’s Got Talent. The audience began with some pretty foul shout-outs about her plain appearance, a reaction that quickly turned to avid appreciation for her amazing voice. For whatever reason, reality producers seemingly assume their audience wants some such humiliation, as it is a common element in otherwise good shows – see, for example, Pawn Stars’ treatment of Chumlee, who is often\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 20\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nFlourishing: Reality TV and a Life of Ethical Excellence\n\n21\n\nthe subject of putdowns. Again, the structure of most reality TV programs depends on the tension between humiliation and praise, which places the burden on the virtuous viewer, who can, and should, essentially “work around” those ethical problems, focusing on the playful or educational or social aspects of a show while also being repulsed by the humiliation.41 We thus have the full argument for this chapter’s thesis: reality TV is not only consistent with an ethical life; some watching of some of it can enhance one’s life. This conclusion, though, should not be read as an exhortation to run to the nearest couch and grab the remote. Even in those cases where reality TV does enhance, it does not do so in a unique way; all its contributions to flourishing can no doubt be obtained, by most of us,42 in other, more effective ways. But as an occasional break? As long as that occurs within an otherwise balanced life, I see no justified proscription.\n\nNotes 1 David Shields, Reality Hunger: A Manifesto (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010), 52. 2 Shields, Reality Hunger: “In our hunger for all things true, we make the facts irrelevant. . . [Truth] is that which had been made luminous, undeniably authentic by having been found and taken up, always at a cost, from deeper, more shared levels of the life we all really live” (pp. 86, 47). For a deeper illumination of this point see Martha C. Nussbaum, Love’s Knowledge: Essays on Philosophy and Literature (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990). 3 “Areté,” for the ancient Greeks, was sometimes synonymous with the rich, extended, flourishing life (“eudaimonia”) that represented humans’ fullest individual achievement, and sometimes presented as one of the conditions of eudaimonia. For simplicity’s sake, I will use “areté,” “excellence,” “flourishing,” as different terms for a life lived to its best and fullest, i.e. for a eudaimonic life. 4 Pawn Stars portrays a family-run pawn shop in Las Vegas and includes considerable historical commentary (driven by the items customers bring in); Iron Chef America is a cooking competition in which master chefs are given an hour to turn the “mystery ingredient” into five gourmet plates; and Jersey Shore is an MTV product that follows eight strangers brought together in a single house in New Jersey, with particular attention paid to melodrama and sexuality. 5 This well-known quotation is routinely attributed to Aristotle (see, for example, http://philosophical-quotes.com/657.html), but I could not find its original source; either way, it is an eloquent expression of the need for balance.\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 21\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n22 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\n6 Wendy N. Wyatt, “The Ethical Obligations of News Consumers,” in Journalism Ethics: A Philosophical Approach, ed. Christopher Meyers (New York: Oxford University Press, 2010) 283–95. 7 For a fuller account of that method, see Christopher Meyers, “Re-Appreciating W. D Ross: Naturalizing Prima Facie Duties and a Proposed Method,” Journal of Mass Media Ethics 26, no. 4 (2011, 316–31). 8 For an explanation of the differences between conceptual and descriptive definitions, see Michael Davis, “Why Journalism is a Profession,” in Meyers, Journalism Ethics, 91–102. 9 I characterize Mythbusters (and similarly structured shows, e.g. Pawn Stars, Dancing with the Stars, American Pickers) as unscripted because, even though the voiceover is clearly scripted and the general approach to the “experiments” is planned out, more than half of the televised portion is spontaneous activity and reactions. 10 John Stuart Mill, “Utilitarianism,” in Classics of Political and Moral Philosophy, ed. Steven M. Cahn (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), 896–9. Mill no doubt relied on Aristotle’s similar arguments here. See, for example, Book I, Section 3 of Nicomachean Ethics: “Now each man judges well the things he knows, and of these he is a good judge. And so the man who has been educated in a subject is a good judge of that subject, and the man who has received an all-round education is a good judge in general. Hence a young man is not a proper hearer of lectures on political science; for he is inexperienced in the actions that occur in life. . . And it makes no difference whether he is young in years or youthful in character; the defect does not depend on time, but on his living.” [I use the W. D. Ross translation (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1908), in part because it is available online. See: http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/nicomachaen. html] 11 John Stuart Mill, On Liberty, ed. Currin V.

As any Bachelor season unfolded, viewers saw nearly interchangeable “bachelorettes” gather around the patio of the bachelor’s mansion for a nightly cocktail party at which they vied for time alone with the eligible man. Viewers could expect to see an innocent Southern belle, an outdoorsy brunette, and a vixen intent on mowing down her competition to capture the man. Viewers also could expect to see the bachelor progress from woman to woman, stopping between cuddles to tell the cameras – and the viewers – how “well” he was getting to know the “real” Ashley or Jenna, and how he remained committed to finding his ideal wife. Each episode ended with a ceremony at which the bachelor bestowed roses on women he wanted to pursue and the program’s host asked rejected women to depart immediately. In January 2011, ABC restored Brad Womack to the bachelor mansion. He was infamous as the only bachelor ever to reject every contestant presented\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 25\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n26 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\nto him. After explaining the therapeutic “work” he’d since done to become ready for love and apologizing to the two finalists he had humiliated three years before, Womack was whisked out to the mansion’s entrance. There 30 new women, eager for his attention, paraded before him. He kissed or squeezed each Barbie-like beauty, and the fourteenth Bachelor contest was under way. Are women and men this desperate to marry? Most young women don’t serve themselves up as readily available sex objects to chauvinists like Womack, do they? How can viewers be entertained by reality television’s repeated presentations of rigidly defined, outdated gender roles? Reality television must be guilty of stereotyping. Yes, and no. However many stereotypes some reality television programs present, all reality television is not the same. Reality is a broad genre that includes everything from Bachelor-style dating contests to talent contests such as American Idol, real estate series such as House Hunters, soap opera-style squabbles such as Jersey Shore, shows about offbeat occupations such as Cake Boss, and shows about unusual families such as Sister Wives. The stereotypes these reality programs suggest are not all the same, nor are they equally harmful to reality show participants or viewers. To flatly say reality television unethically stereotypes people is to stereotype reality television. It is more accurate to say some reality television unethically stereotypes some people, while some reality television challenges some stereotypes. For instance, during January 2011, while ABC’s The Bachelor persistently presented outdated gender role stereotypes, the network’s Extreme Makeover: Home Edition quietly countered them. The show, which since its 2003 debut has selected worthy families and built them new homes in a week, visited Savannah, Georgia, to help Carmen and Jim Simpson, who struggled to care for a child with a severe physical condition. The Simpsons wanted to “pay forward” the program’s generosity, so they offered the show a list of other deserving people. They described a friend who couldn’t afford a diamond engagement ring. The program provided a ring, and during a clothing drive where the show addressed the Simpsons’ desire to collect coats for needy people, this bachelor eagerly asked his intended to marry him. She said yes. They hugged, kissed and celebrated. By Bachelor standards, this couple weighed too much and wore discount-store clothes, and they stood in a community hall full of donations. But this program demonstrated that pudgy, plain people enjoy romance, too. The next week, while the bachelor and his all-white bevvy of beauties again cavorted on lavish dates, Extreme Makeover: Home Edition debunked more stereotypes. The show’s big orange bus rolled to Augusta, Georgia, where\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 26\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nStereotypes: Reality TV as Both Creator and Confronter\n\n27\n\nviewers met Earnie Graham, whose home repair had abruptly ended with her brother’s death. But rather than hear a sob story about single parenting, viewers saw an African-American mother and two children who were happy and involved in their community, with nary a mention of an absent father. Because of Graham’s devoted Girl Scouts volunteer work, the show invited an all-female crew to demolish her old house. Armed with sledge hammers and axes, these women attacked the house – and drove the crane swinging the wrecking ball, too. This family and these construction workers provided a notable contrast to the passive beauties languishing on the bachelor’s couch. One network. One month. Two equally long-running reality shows. The message for viewers? Mixed. The Bachelor stereotyped pretty people, while Extreme Makeover: Home Edition embraced ordinary people. Clearly, reality television is a complex source of messages about the identities of contemporary people, and some of those messages foster stereotypes, while others do not. Reality television is a polysemic text open to multiple interpretations, and the stereotypes it contains deserve ethical analysis.\n\nThe Ethical Critique of Reality TV Stereotypes Reality television’s use of stereotypes suggests two primary ethical questions: (i) do reality producers have a duty not to cast and edit their shows in ways that foster stereotypes? (ii) do reality viewers have a duty not to accept the stereotypes some reality programs contain? To answer these questions, an application of duty-based ethical principles seems appropriate, and any duty-based analysis begins with the foundational work of eighteenth-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant. For Kant, ethical decisions must be rooted in a person’s good will, which is the only thing that is always and uniquely a moral good. “A good will is not good because of what it effects or accomplishes – because of its fitness for attaining some proposed end: it is good through its willing alone – that is, good in itself.”1 Decisions cannot be motivated by self-interest or by possible consequences, but by the good will that dictates performing ethical duty – the same ethical duty in all cases. This principle of acting universally to fulfil duty is widely known as Kant’s categorical imperative: “Act as if the maxim of your action were to become through your will a universal law of nature.”2 In the act of performing a universal duty, people – described by Kant as “rational beings” who are “an object of reverence” – must be respected as ends in themselves. This corollary to Kant’s categorical imperative is thus: “Act in such a way that you always treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 27\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n28 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\nperson of any other, never simply as a means, but always at the same time as an end.”3 Two twentieth-century philosophers enhance the duty-based principles ideas of Kant. First, Scottish philosopher W. D. Ross suggests that seven prima facie duties, rather than one universal duty, may be applied to decide an ethical question. These self-evident duties are fidelity (keeping promises), reparation (righting wrongs), gratitude (repaying benefits by conveying benefits to others), non-maleficence (doing no harm), justice (fairly distributing burdens and benefits), beneficence (doing good to others) and self-improvement (fostering one’s own wisdom and goodness). In any situation, one of the duties will rise to the level of “absolute obligation” and trump the others, thus dictating the ethical decision.4 Second, US political philosopher John Rawls adds the important principle that an ethical outcome is one derived from the duty of protecting the interests of the most vulnerable stakeholder in a situation.5 Whether created by program producers or enjoyed by viewers, stereotypes on reality television cannot survive the scrutiny of these duty-based ethical principles. Producers and viewers can hardly be motivated by good will in the Kantian sense when they actively foster false impressions of groups of people for ratings or profit, or when they are entertained by the misrepresentation of others. Nor can creating stereotypes or being entertained by them be universalized; no rational person would suggest that stereotypes be employed in every media message. As well, no ethical argument can be made for using people as means to an end – whether that end is the profit and recognition that may accrue to producers or the entertainment that may be afforded to viewers – through stereotyping. Furthermore, creating stereotypes or being entertained by them cannot be said to fulfill the prima facie duties set out by W. D. Ross. In fact, using stereotypes does wrong, creates harm and unfairly burdens the people who are objects of stereotyping, as well as promotes a failure of self-improvement in the people who create or are entertained by the stereotypes. Finally, the most vulnerable stakeholder in the reality television stereotyping situation would seem to be the person who shares the identity characteristics of those who are stereotyped by the program but who has not volunteered to participate in a program that depicts those characteristics stereotypically. Taking into account the interests of that person would dictate not using the stereotypes, which undermine the ability of people to act autonomously when others apply media-depicted stereotypes to them. That ethical critique, then, can be used to assess how reality television and its viewers foster or debunk stereotypes.\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 28\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nStereotypes: Reality TV as Both Creator and Confronter\n\n29\n\nReality TV Creates a New Cast of Characters Rather than simply offer stereotypes, reality television often provides entertaining messages about who comprises our communities and how they behave. In April 2009, when Susan Boyle stepped to the Britain’s Got Talent microphone, the acerbic judge Simon Cowell wasn’t the only person who had to change his mind about who’s got talent. Thanks to a YouTube video, millions of people worldwide saw a dowdy Scottish villager who possessed a soaring voice that would sell millions of albums over the next two years. As it did in vaulting Boyle onto the world stage, reality television erases lines between what is public and private and who is ordinary or celebrity.6 For example, in a society that pressures parents to be perfect, reality TV viewers don’t have to worry theirs are the only children who throw bedtime tantrums. Supernanny viewers see ordinary parents failing to put their children to bed calmly and on time. This dose of parenting reality is no small thing. For decades television has provided an unrealistic stream of images about families, perpetuating a false nostalgia for what family historian Stephanie Coontz calls a “way we never were.”7 Supernanny, by comparison, suggests it’s acceptable for parents to recognize they need help learning to raise their children. Whether depicting struggling parents or shy Scottish singers, reality television often presents people who have been ignored by mainstream entertainment. Reality television sometimes has been more diverse and used more real lives and language than has fictional television.8 “Whether its subject is kids from New Jersey, adolescent mothers or commercial fisherman, reality TV has discovered new faces, new idioms, new modes of being.”9 For instance, after its 1992 debut, MTV’s The Real World was lauded for being among the first US television shows to fairly depict a gay man. The 1994 series shattered gay stereotypes by including Pedro Zamora, who “grabbed the show’s spotlight and educated its young viewers about what it was like to live with AIDS.”10 Similarly, the fashion reality show Project Runway also has challenged stereotypes about sexual orientation, race and ethnicity. The show’s would-be fashion designers and its judges don’t particularly care about anyone else’s identity characteristics. They care whether a contestant can produce creative clothing. Thus, the show presents a diverse world rarely seen on mainstream fictional television.11 On 19 Kids and Counting, viewers glimpse another world rarely shown on fictional television: that of an evangelical Christian family. Viewers may smile\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 29\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n30 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\nat the antics of all the children who crowd Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar’s Arkansas house, but the show never encourages viewers to make fun of the family. Rather, the show neutrally presents the Duggars’ religious and patriotic values, and offers viewers information about a community often treated as fodder for jokes. Similarly, Sister Wives offers a straightforward look into the rarely seen world of polygamy by featuring Kody Brown, his four wives and 16 children. Meanwhile, What Not to Wear uses humor to feature women of all ages whose wardrobes are laughably unfashionable. It’s true that the show’s fashion experts insist the women assemble a formulaic new wardrobe by shopping at stores with which the program has sponsorship arrangements, but those experts never suggest the women diet, exercise excessively, or have plastic surgery. Whether plump or petite, the women are treated to flattering clothing, hairstyles and makeup. Yes, What Not to Wear plays on the belief that all women clamor to be made over, but at least the program shows all women, not just stick-thin bachelorettes. These examples suggest reality television programs are capable of incorporating a Kantian respect for persons in general and for persons who might be different from television viewers. No matter how different or similar a person’s characteristics to those of the viewer, all people are nevertheless worthy of respect just because they are human.\n\nReality TV Casts and Edits for Stereotypes Despite these encouraging presentations of ordinary, under-represented people, reality television programs also have presented and reinforced stereotypes of gender, race, sexual orientation, religion, socioeconomic class and other identity characteristics. Media activist Jennifer Pozner suggests these stereotypes are “endemic, even necessary”12 to some reality shows. Pozner and other critics say the stereotyping begins with casting, when reality producers deliberately choose participants for stock roles.13 For instance, producers of The Real World have been accused of casting predictable characters such as the naïve, small-town, white person and the street-savvy, urban, African American person who will inevitably clash before becoming fast friends. Thus, critics say The Real World has suggested through casting and editing that racism is a recurring characteristic of rural conservatives but never of urban liberals and that racism can be overcome simply by developing friendships across racial lines.14\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 30\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nStereotypes: Reality TV as Both Creator and Confronter\n\n31\n\nReality television may not provide stereotypical lines for actors to deliver, as would a scripted show, but producers do influence participants’ behavior on these “unscripted” shows. Producers feed ideas to participants before recording on-camera monologues, and producers reward or punish particular behaviors by giving participants basic supplies or extra treats. Contestants confined to the Big Brother house or marooned on the Survivor island care a lot about items the shows’ producers distribute, and thus contestants quickly figure out which of their actions get more goodies. Too, because producers control post-production editing of the programs, they can heighten the drama by emphasizing stereotypes that clash.15 Sex-role stereotypes are among the most frequent reality television stereotypes, and The Bachelor is as good – or bad – an example as any. Critics suggest the show perpetuates stereotypes of the man as all-powerful sexual predator and the woman as gold digger disguised as helpless damsel.16 The Bachelor is not alone in this regard. Most reality dating shows present a patriarchal man and a delicate princess awaiting his rescue. These depictions represent outdated ideas about gender that stem from hundreds of years’ worth of depictions of women and men. Visual imagery in Western society at least since the Renaissance has presented women as passive sexualized objects artfully displayed for the male gaze.17 The Bachelor formula is no different. A parade of almost identical long-haired, tautly toned and exceedingly thin yet large-breasted women is arrayed before one man. The bachelor dictates the dating activities while the “bachelorettes” – and yes, these girlish women are labeled with this diminutive title – provocatively display themselves to attract his attention. This is hardly assertive twenty-firstcentury womanhood. Instead, it perpetuates an outdated princess myth, in which “the mythmaking machines of media and marketing persistently tie ideal femininity and attractiveness to a very specific mode of sexuality, one that involves exhibitionism and a submissive appeal to the male gaze, without any consideration of the girl’s own interests, ideas, or sense of well-being.”18 Furthermore, the “bachelorette” women epitomize a stereotypical ideal female body that is “both slender and voluptuous” – and therefore “practically a physical impossibility” without plastic surgery. 19 Dating contest shows such as The Bachelor don’t just stereotype women. They also present a “limiting vision of masculinity.”20 The bachelor must be tall and chiseled in the masculinity as muscularity mode, and he is encouraged to be sexually voracious. He is expected to be physically intimate with every contestant in his season-long hunt. That the woman he ultimately selects will be submissive goes without saying. No Bachelor aspires to be a house husband or full-time father. No, ma’am. This man will take care of his little woman. No matter that Americans’ views about marriage are changing\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 31\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n32 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\ndramatically today. In the world of The Bachelor, marriage is organized along traditionally rigid gender lines.21 (Of course, that presumes The Bachelor actually marries his princess. Few ever have.) To be fair, pause for a moment to assess The Bachelorette. Some viewers have suggested the spinoff program counters sex-role stereotypes by placing the woman in The Bachelor’s position of power to select a mate. Those viewers are wrong. As Pozner points out, the spin-off fails in several ways to meaningfully reverse stereotypical roles. First, the woman cast as The Bachelorette must have been publicly rejected by a bachelor who didn’t pick her at the end of his series; a bachelor, by comparison, is selected to star in the series on his own merits. Second, women who compete for The Bachelor’s attention routinely are presented as cat-fighting competitors, while men who vie for The Bachelorette “are usually shown palling around with one another, chugging beer and male-bonding over The Bachelorette’s hot bod.”22 Third, while The Bachelor is encouraged to become physically intimate with as many female contestants as possible during his series, The Bachelorette has been chided on her own program, as well as on talk shows and by bloggers, for even the slightest of physical intimacies, as in an instance in which the program host asked a Bachelorette to justify kissing more than one man during the multi-week series. Finally, when men are dumped by The Bachelorette, they typically are asked about their career plans; one contestant even ended up being offered a job on an entertainment news show. Women who are spurned by The Bachelor, by contrast, are shown weeping brokenheartedly as they are driven away from the mansion.23 In sum, then, The Bachelorette may be starring in her own reality series, but she remains a passive, sexualized princess, while the men she dates remain powerful and aggressive. So much for turning the stereotyping tables. Reality programs such as The Bachelor and The Bachelorette that cast for sex-role stereotypes or edit events to emphasize stereotypical conflict, fail the Kantian ethical test of respecting persons as worthwhile ends in themselves. Furthermore, the persistent use of these outmoded stereotypes promotes the failure of any self-improvement of the sort that W. D. Ross said was a duty of the ethical person. A reasonable viewer hardly can be improved by spending time watching shallow, old-fashioned stereotypes.\n\nReality TV Perpetuates Symbolic Annihilation At least Bachelor and Bachelorette viewers have experience interacting with the opposite sex and can competently compare the shows’ stereotypes to\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 32\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nStereotypes: Reality TV as Both Creator and Confronter\n\n33\n\nthose experiences. Where reality TV stereotypes become more troubling is in connection to race and ethnicity, where many viewers lack experience interacting with people of differing backgrounds. By their total absence, The Bachelor suggests people of color don’t matter. The powerful, desirable male has always been white, and the fraction of female contestants who have been anything other than white were usually rejected early in the season.24 The Bachelor presents a curiously white world to viewers in a country where one in seven new marriages is inter-racial or interethnic, where mixed-race people represent one of the fastest growing demographic segments, and where citizens recently elected a president of mixed race.25 The Bachelor typifies the concept of symbolic annihilation. Symbolic annihilation suggests groups of people who are not presented or who are severely under-represented by television may be mentally erased from viewers’ thoughts and therefore dismissed as unimportant to the larger culture. For years, racial and ethnic minority groups have been among the people most frequently symbolically annihilated by television. Complicating their symbolic annihilation is their stereotyping. When these same underrepresented minority group members are presented on television, they have frequently been misrepresented, or stereotyped. Certainly this occurs on reality television. “As reality shows are some of the only places viewers regularly see people of color on TV, their imagery takes on greater significance,” Pozner writes.26 Mainstream broadcast networks do not include people of racial or ethnic minority status on their dating shows, thus perpetuating as “reality” a “white beauty yardstick” to which people of color literally can never measure up, even “in a country that, statistically speaking, is getting darker all the time.”27 Cable networks, which target smaller, more specific audience groups, feature people of color on dating reality shows but often in stereotypical ways. Pozner argues, for instance, that VH1’s Flavor of Love revived damaging racist stereotypes of African Americans nearly 100 years after minstrel shows perpetrated them. The show arrayed 20 young, single African American women in front of the has-been rapper Flavor Flav, who was at least 25 years their senior. He then literally objectified the women by replacing their given names with nicknames, usually chosen to relate to their body parts, and slapping those labels on their breasts or buttocks. He furthered the racist stereotyping by requiring contestants to cook fried chicken and clean disgusting household messes. Yet the Flavor of Love women fought over this man who lacked any obvious qualities that would make him a Bachelor-like prize.28 In their backbiting and outrageousness, the “flavorettes” – and yes, the show called them this – epitomized the “crazy black woman” stereotype applied to other African American women on reality television contests. After\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 33\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n34 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\nparticipating on The Apprentice, Omarosa Manigault-Stallworth became the best known “crazy black woman” on reality television, but one pops up each season on America’s Next Top Model.29 In the case of the “flavorettes,” the “crazy black woman” behaviour resulted in a spin-off show – Flavor of Love Girls: Charm School – designed to class them up.30 In a television world that features few realistic, complex African American female characters, this kind of racist stereotyping is clearly unethical. Racist stereotyping is unethical when it happens to men of color, too. Flavor Flav is a caricature of the shiftless black man, as is Teeny, the unemployed, freeloading brother of American Idol singer Fantasia, whose life and family featured in the VH1 reality show Fantasia for Real that debuted late in 2010.31 The Real World has been criticized for stereotyping African American men as sexually violent.32 Washington Post television writer Paul Farhi suggests most reality programs consistently stereotype African American men as “the Bad Black Guy.” This stereotype is magnified by the symbolic annihilation of African American men. Because so many white men are seen on reality television, they get to be courageous, smart, ignorant, silly, sexy or funny. “You’d never make the same assumption about African American men, for the simple reason that it’s hard to see diversity when there’s only one black man per show. The rigid tokenism of reality programs – call it the ‘one black guy at a time’ rule – magnifies the behaviour of the BBG, giving him metaphoric power,” Farhi writes.33 In the rare instance a reality show includes two African American men, it has been accused of stereotyping one as the “integrated” or “acceptable” black man and the other as the “hood” or “unacceptable” black man.34 Clearly, racist stereotypes perpetuated by reality producers and consumed by viewers fail the Kantian tests of good will and respect for persons. These pernicious stereotypes also fail Ross’ duties not to harm people, to fairly distribute burdens and benefits, to do good to others, and to foster one’s own wisdom and goodness. Additionally, these stereotypes unfairly burden the people about whom viewers may assume the stereotypes they’ve seen on television are accurate. Those people likely qualify as the most vulnerable stakeholders Rawls suggested are deserving of ethical consideration.\n\nWhy Stereotypes on Reality TV Matter Fictional television entertainment stereotypes people by identity characteristics in each of the same potentially harmful ways reality television does, and so does non-fictional television news. So why does stereotyping on reality television particularly merit examination?\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 34\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\nStereotypes: Reality TV as Both Creator and Confronter\n\n35\n\nFirst, people watch a lot of reality television. In 2010, the typical US television viewer saw 34 hours of television a week. Many viewers, especially those under age 50, spent many of those hours on reality programs. In 2010, no fictional entertainment program ranked in the ten highest-rated programs among all US television viewers, but one reality program – Undercover Boss – did.35 US television networks aired almost 600 different prime-time reality programs between 2000 and 2010,36 and some observers contend reality is the most popular television genre in the world.37 Stereotypes on reality television are consumed by millions of viewers. Second, “reality” is a powerful label that raises the expectation of accuracy among viewers.38 “Even though many people who watch it say, ‘Oh, I know it’s sort of made up’, there’s something about the fact that it’s called reality that somehow still gives it a different sense of credibility that people aren’t willing to give a sitcom or a drama,” notes media literacy expert Andrea Quijada.39 Stereotypes seem more troubling when they’re labelled “real.”40 Third, reality programs too often use a single character to represent a racial or ethnic minority community. This combination of symbolic annihilation and misrepresentation can mislead viewers. Washington Post columnist Clarence Page points out that “when viewers are fed a steady diet of stereotypes, stereotypes create a reality all their own,” especially in a society where racial division persists.41 Finally, and most importantly, stereotypes on reality television matter because they can be a potent agent of social learning. Television “plays a significant role in how audiences shape their racially stratified and gendered world,” providing “a means for members of different social, cultural and ethnic groups to learn about each other.”42 Reality television conveys stereotypes about those groups. Whether those stereotypes are believable is not of as much concern as the fact that even unrealistic stereotypes may influence viewers’ perceptions.43 Social psychology studies conclude that people activate stereotypes automatically and quickly, often without even being conscious of doing so.44 Furthermore, social psychologists find that people who are asked to generate stereotypes about groups of people easily produce significantly more negative stereotypes than positive ones, and that people are much more likely to automatically invoke negative stereotypes about people or communities they don’t know.45 The problem is that stereotypes don’t just describe identity characteristics. They exploit and prescribe those characteristics in judgemental ways. While it is a natural cognitive function to compress complex ideas to manage what would otherwise be a cognitive overload, that compression – which becomes the stereotype – is not neutral. It is distorted, magnifying some characteristics and minimizing others. “Stereotypes usually fail to reflect the richness\n\n9781441193810_txt_print.indd 35\n\n16/04/2012 14:33\n\n36 The Ethics of Reality TV\n\nof the subculture and ignore the realities from which the images come.”46 Stereotypes reflect value judgements, letting the holder of the stereotype exploit the traits of some people in a group to judge other people in that group. In this way, stereotyped people are judged by the values laden in the stereotype, and others will begin to expect those people will behave as the stereotype dictates.\n\nAn Ethical Approach to Reality TV Stereotypes Rather than judging one another based on stereotypes, people could learn from one another by sharing their stories.

After all, he concludes, “when the stranger is no longer imaginary, but real and present, sharing a human social life, you may like or dislike him, you may agree or disagree; but if it is what you both want, you can make sense of each other in the end.”49 For Appiah, this kind of cross-cultural understanding is an ethical duty. Appiah’s idea of cross-cultural inquiry as an ethical duty is not new and likely is influenced by his understanding of the ancient Greeks. As philosopher Martha Nussbaum points out, the Greeks argued that “we should not allow differences of nationality or class or ethnic membership or even gender to erect barriers between us and our fellow human beings.”50 Immanuel Kant’s duty-based ethical principles that emph"
