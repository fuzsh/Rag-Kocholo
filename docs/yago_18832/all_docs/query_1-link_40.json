        "text": "\"Bigg Boss 8\" contestant Dimpy Ganguly is set to tie the knot once again.\n\nDimpy, who was earlier married to Rahul Mahajan, announced her engagement on social media.\n\nAccording to a report in Telly Chakkar, Dimpy is engaged to Dubai-based businessman Rohit Roy. The two had been dating each other for over two years.\n\nThe report further states that the grand wedding will be held in Kolkata on 27 November.\n\nConfirming the news, Dimpy's \"Bigg Boss 8\" co-contestant Sushant Divgikar told the entertainment portal: \"Yes, Dimpy has got engaged. Rohit is a very good guy and I wish both of them a very good luck. I have a secret special gift for Dimpy on her wedding which she will cherish her entire life.\"\n\nDuring \"Bigg Boss 8\", there were reports that Dimpy is dating a Dubai-based businessman, who owns an event management company; however, Dimpy refused to talk about the same.\n\nIn 2010, Rahul and Dimpy got married on reality show \"Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega\". However, early this year, the duo legally ended their marriage of five years.\n\nIn the last season of \"Bigg Boss\", fans and well-wishers hoped that the estranged couple Rahul and Dimpy would eventually reconcile and get back together. On some of the episodes, they were even seen getting emotional. But both Rahul and Dimpy maintained that they share a cordial relationship through the show."
