        "text": "PTI | By, Mumbai\n\nReality TV star Rahul Mahajan has denied claims of dating model Aparna Joshi by Bigg Boss Halla Bol co-contestant Sambhavna Seth, saying he is currently single.\n\nReality TV star Rahul Mahajan has denied claims of dating model Aparna Joshi by Bigg Boss Halla Bol co-contestant Sambhavna Seth, saying he is currently single.\n\nSambhavna claimed on a recent episode of the reality show that Rahul, who split from second wife Dimpy more than a year back, was dating the Mumbai-based model.\n\n\"I don't know why she (Sambhavna) said so. She should not have said such things on a national TV. Such baseless statements maligns a girl's name unnecessarily. I am not dating anybody. I am currently single,\" Rahul said.\n\nKnown for his flirtatious behaviour, Rahul, 39, was also said to be dating co-contestant Karishma Tanna before he married Dimpy on a reality show.\n\n\"I knew Karishma much before my stint on Bigg Boss. We were friends. I don't know from where these rumours have come...,\" Rahul said.\n\nThe Nach Baliye star entered Bigg Boss Halla Bol as a challenger and sparked reunion rumours after he was seen supporting his estranged wife Dimpy in her tough times in the house.\n\n\"Dimpy and I still share a friendly relationship. We have not turned enemies after getting separated from each other. We are well-wishers and when Dimpy was even going to participate on the show, I told her not to trust anyone inside the house. We are friends and will always remain so... We are not rekindling our romance,\" he said.\n\nRahul said the way Dimpy is behaving on the show is incorrect and will be harmful for her in the long run.\n\n\"Dimpy sometime really goes over-the-top. The way she is behaving might be good at providing content to TV but it's harmful for her in future. She should know when to stop herself,\" he said.\n\nAsked who has the maximum chances of winning the show, Rahul said,\" I want either Gautam (Gulati) or Pritam (Singh) to win the show because they are my friends.\"\n\nRahul, a former pilot, is excited to begin shooting his debut film 3 Full and 3 Half, where he will play one of the leads. Shooting will commence from March in Delhi.\n\nGet more updates from Bollywood, Taylor Swift, Hollywood, Music Web Series along with Latest Entertainment News at Hindustan Times."
