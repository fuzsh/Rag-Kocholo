But things soon turned rocky in what was Rahul’s second marriage, and Rahul and Dimpy separated. On February 25, 2015, the former lovers officially divorced. There was a court hearing and Rahul posted on Twitter soon after, a clear cut statement about he being just friends with Dimpy from now on.

Soon after the swayamwar, Dimpy filed a domestic violence case against husband Rahul. After this case was filed, it seemed neither Rahul nor Dimpy were happy in their so-called marriage.\n\nBut soon, audiences witnessed the lovebirds in Nach Baliye 5 dance reality show. They entered the show to entertain audiences and also to resolve their personal problems. After this show, Rahul and Dimpy never made a public appearance as a jodi, which became very evident and topic for gossip among their fans. But the fighting pair was seen in Bigg Boss 8 in 2014, although by now the two were staying separately.\n\nIn Bigg Boss 8, it was finally revealed that Rahul and Dimpy have finally moved on and there’s nothing between them apart from simple friendship. Audiences desired to view some romantic and awww moments between Rahul and Dimpy, but Rahul was seen flirting with Karishma Tanna instead in the Bigg Boss 8 house.\n\nWe can just say, we wish Rahul and Dimpy share a strong bond of friendship and live a happy life with their loved ones.\n\nEdited by Shweta Parande"
