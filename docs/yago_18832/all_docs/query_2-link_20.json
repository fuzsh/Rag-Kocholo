        "text": "We all know who Rahul Mahajan is, if you don’t, then I guess I should tell you who Rahul Mahajan is! Famous for being infamous, Rahul Mahajan is one of those characters who does a lot of sh*t but seems to get away with it all. So much so, he even has a ‘fan following‘ because of… I have no clue, maybe his huge eyes, his psychotic laughter? Anyway, there are things Rahul did before becoming a Bigg Boss 8 Halla Bol challenger and I think we should all know what the man was up to before this haunted house made him a household name.\n\n1) Was found in critical condition due to alleged drug abuse\n\nAfter his father Pramod Mahajan was shot dead by his own brother Praveen Mahajan, Rahul and Pramod’s assistant Bibek Maitra, decided to de-stress by having a champagne and drug fest and were found unconscious the next morning. Rahul had to be put on a ventilator and Bibek died due to the overdose.\n\n2) His first wife Shweta Singh divorced him on the grounds of domestic violence\n\nThey were childhood sweethearts.\n\nLove was in the air until differences cropped up. Payal then went on to date (and get engaged to) Sangram Singh. Here are 13 other couples Bigg Boss gave us btw.\n\n4) Featured in Bigg Boss 2\n\nWhere his romance with Payal Rohatgi and feelings for Monica Bedi (yea, that gangster Abu Salem‘s ex) was the talk of the nation!\n\n5) Had a swayamvar for himself!\n\nAfter Rakhi Sawant‘s swayamvar, Rahul was the face of season 2. Unlike Rakhi, he did get married and that resulted in the union of Rahul and Dimpy.\n\n6) Danced in Nach Baliye 5\n\nThe magical union of Rahul and Dimpy gave us one of the most (intentionally or unintentionally) entertaining couples on the dance show.\n\n7) Currently in the process of a divorce again…\n\nThe grounds of this divorce are incompatibility and seeing their antics in the Bigg Boss 8 house, it’s really not that surprising!\n\nHe does seem shady doesn’t he? Maybe that’s why he’s so perfect as a reality show entertainer (FYI, that’s what his Wikipedia page says)."
