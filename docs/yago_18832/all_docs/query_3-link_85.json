        "text": "After finding his soulmate in Dimpy Ganguly through a televised swayamvar, Rahul Mahajan is set to host Perfect Bachelor, a Marathi show. The show, to be aired on ETV Marathi, will hunt for Maharashtra's most eligible bachelor and Rahul has been picked as host for his audience connect, according to the show's production company, CellI8. \"Rahul is a well-known face on television and blends well with the concept of the show. He is an ideal choice for us as the audiences like him and connect to him easily,\" Zubin Driver, group creative director, Network18 Group and CEO, Cell18, said. Rahul, son of late Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Pramod Mahajan, is known for his chequered past with allegations of beating his ex-wife Shweta Singh, a drug abuse case in 2006 and an alleged affair with actor Payal Rohatgi. He made his way to dinner table conversation after participating on reality show Bigg Boss 2 in 2008, after which he chose to find a second wife through Imagine TV's Swayamvar 2 - Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega. Thereafter, he even judged a kids' comedy reality show Chhote Miyan and was even seen as a participant on Sony's Comedy Circus. His latest project on the small screen will have 12 contenders vying for the title of Perfect Bachelor, based on looks, personality and talent. The candidates will be made to live in a house and will be given tasks to perform, on the basis of which they will be judged. Four girls will also live with them in the same house. \"The show relies on allowing audiences to vote for the most eligible bachelor. I am confident that audiences will be engaged with the show,\" said Driver. For now, Cell 18 has approached names like Neha Pendse, Sai Lokur and Shruti Marathe as judges for the show, which is expected to go on air by December-end. It will be a bi-weekly show.\n\nALSO READ:\n\nRahul Mahajan and Monica Bedi on 'Sach Ka Saamna 2'?\n\nStay tuned to BollywoodLife for the latest scoops and updates from Bollywood, Hollywood, South, TV and Web-Series."
