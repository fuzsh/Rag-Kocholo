        "text": "Indian celebrities having a swayamvar on national television is not a new trend. Earlier, the swayamvars of various known names including Rakhi Sawant, Mallika Sherawat, Rahul Mahajan, and Shehnaaz Gill took place on TV. Now, the latest buzz suggests that another celebrity might soon be looking for a bride on a reality show.\n\nWell, we're talking about Mika Singh. Reportedly, the singer is excited about his swayamvar and is going to charge an insane amount for it. There are rumours that he has charged a whopping amount of Rs 50 crore to be a part of the show. Yes, you read that right!\n\nRevealing the same, a source informed ETimes, \"When approached Mika Singh asking price is 50 crores for the participation in the show\". However, the singer is yet to confirm the same.\n\nAccording to reports, the show's concept is similar to the previous swayamvars. It is expected to premiere within a few months. Looks like Mika too will follow the footsteps of Rakhi Sawant and Ratan Rajput. He will reportedly just get engaged on the show and will take his relationship further once the show ends.\n\nInterestingly, after the show, both Rakhi and Ratan broke engagements with their partners as things didn't turn out as expected. We wonder what the future holds for Mika.\n\nWell, the singer is looking forward to his swayamvar. Revealing the same, a source informed TOI, \"Mika is really excited to be a part of the show. Contestants participating in the show will be from across the country\".\n\nTalking about previous swayamvars, only Rahul Mahajan ended up getting married to Dimpy Ganguly on the show Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega in 2010. After being together for around four years, the duo got divorced in 2015.\n\nMallika Sherawat had chosen Vijay Singh as her life partner. After the show, they dated each other for a while and parted ways within a year.\n\nPakistani actress and Bigg Boss 4 contestant Veena Malik too was supposed to have a swayamvar, back in 2012. The promos were out too, however, the show was called off after Imagine TV decided to shut shop."
