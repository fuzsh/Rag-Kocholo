Each episode of the series takes you through the year spent by an exciting bunch of teenagers - a year during which they fall in love, and suffer heart-breaks, have problems with their teachers and parents, experience pressures at exam time and so on. Their trials and tribulations are captured poignantly and with rare sensitivity.\n\nThe story is based on the life of a simple girl named Kangana, who belongs to a traditional Bengali family. Kangana is an exceptionally beautiful girl who knows that she can attract any man, but still hopes for a life partner who will admire, respect and want her for who she is, not her beauty. However, when her beauty becomes her curse, it changes her life forever. Kangana's own family, who are jealous of her, try to destroy every happiness that enters her life. Kangana's childhood sweetheart, Priyam, comes back from America and their love story begins. Kangana falls in love with Priyam, as he has all the qualities she is looking for in her Prince Charming. Soon, she marries him, starting a new chapter in her life. But, life is not as straightforward for Kangana as she was expecting it to be. Problems start arising in her life because of her beauty. Priyam cannot stand that his wife is far more talented and in-demand than him, and with every passing day, his insecurities about Kangana keep growing. He accuses Kangana of having an affair with his own best friend Nivaan and out of his lowliness complex, starts keeping an eye on her to know what she does and whom she meets. His suspicion grows so much that he starts raising his hand on Kangana. He gives her a permanent scar on her face so that she would look like a normal person. In the end, Kangana commits suicide because she was raped and did not want to bring shame on the family."
