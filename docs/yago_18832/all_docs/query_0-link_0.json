        "text": "Dimpy Ganguly is leading the perfect life with husband Rohit Roy and three beautiful kids – Reanna, Aryan and Rishaan. The Bigg Boss fame had a much publicised wedding previously with Rahul Mahajan on reality show – Rahul Ki Dulhaniya. But that marriage didn’t last long after she accused him of domestic violence. In an exclusive interaction with ETimes TV long back, Dimpy had opened up about the healing time post her first marriage and how she regained herself and found love.\n\nShe said that the only people who mattered to her back then were the ones who were around her and not the people hiding behind fake names. She said, “To me, the only people who matter are the ones around me, not the ones who are hiding behind fake names or fake IDs. Even if I know somebody, who is a real person, but has no contribution in my life. As a celebrity, you just grow a thick skin. There is no other way. You cannot make everybody happy. I stopped thinking about it a long time ago. I just look out for my peace, my happiness and my world.”\n\nDimpy didn’t want to give any importance to her past and said, “Many times, people urge me to speak up, talk about it, but… why? Talking about it would take up some time. I would have to invest some time, and give importance to something that is completely immaterial to me.”\n\nThe reality TV show personality did many TV shows as well. But post the divorce, she cut off from everything. Dimpy said back then, “The initial years were hard because I had to start from scratch. I relocated and we started everything fresh. So it was hard. The only way to do it was to completely disconnect. That’s why there was a period of complete silence from my life. I didn’t want to talk to anybody, I didn’t want to do anything. Even though I had time, I didn’t take up any project. I just wanted some time to heal and to figure out my way ahead, start a new life. Once I was in a happy space again, then I came out. I made friends, I did things that I used to do.”\n\nDimpy back then decided to stay away from everyone, even her parents. About the same, she said, “So, there was a time when I trusted nobody. Not even trusting, I moved away from everybody… including my own parents. We were in touch… but what I was going through, what I was thinking… they had no idea. I was dealing with a lot and I wasn’t ready to talk. It was not easy for them. So, I made that choice of moving away.”\n\nDimpy found a friend, philosopher and guide with her now husband Rohit Roy back then. She said, “Rohit was my olive branch from everything that I was going through. At that point, my only friend, philosopher, guide and confidante… everything was Rohit. It was easier than having too many opinions, I only had one source from where I could draw my inspiration from. There was only one person, who knew everything about me and that made it a lot easier. If I had a lot of people around, it would have only created confusion. If you get hit by anything, you don’t have to bounce right then. Take time to heal. At that time, trust only your doctor and nobody else.”\n\nWhen asked about how she decided that she can spend her life with Rohit, Dimpy replied, “There was not much thinking into it. I met him and something just felt right. Whether it was pure luck or instinctive, I can’t point a finger towards one thing that made me trust him. I still can’t. I met him and I felt he is the person I need to trust. There was no other thought.”\n\nThe former model and actress got married to Rahul Mahajan in Rahul Ki Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, did shows like Nach Baliye 5, Bigg Boss 8, Kahani Chandrakanta Ki and many others. The couple had many ugly disputes and differences. Dimpy had accused Rahul of domestic violence after a few months of marriage, which made them file for divorce. She stayed away from the limelight post her bitter divorce in 2015."
