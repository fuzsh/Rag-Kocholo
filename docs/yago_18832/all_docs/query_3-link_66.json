According to reports, the 'Bigg Boss season 2' contestant has filed for divorce from his Kazakhstani wife, Natalya Ilina, in 2022 after being married for 4 years\n\nTrouble in Rahul Mahajan's paradise, once again! According to reports, the Bigg Boss season 2 contestant filed for divorce from his Kazakhstani wife, Natalya Ilina, in 2022 after being married for 4 years. An ETimes report claimed that their relationship fell through due to 'compatibility issues'. A source close to Rahul and Natalya revealed to the publication that there have been issues since the beginning.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe source told ETimes, \"Compatibility issues were there between the two since the beginning. However, they stretched their marriage as long as they could. They parted ways last year and filed for divorce.‚Äù Reportedly, Rahul is heartbroken as it is his third separation. The source also mentioned that the reality show veteran is coping and moving on despite not being in a great state last year.\n\nHowever, Rahul denied the news to the same publication and said, \"I want to keep my private life private. I would not like to comment on anything. I do not discuss what's happening in my personal life even with my friends... By the way, I'm doing well.\"\n\nRahul was 43 years old when he tied the knot with a 25-year-old Natalya. Back in 2020, he revealed to the media that she converted to Hinduism after their marriage. He said in a statement, \"I teach her Bhagavad Gita and we read a lot of mythological stuff together.\"\n\nRahul, the son of late Union Cabinet minister Pramod Mahajan, was married to a person named Shweta Singh. They tied the knot in 2006, however, their relationship saw an end in 2008. She accused him of domestic violence. Shweta filed a divorce on the grounds of incompatibility.\n\nIn 2010, he found love in Dimpy Ganguly on the reality show titled 'Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayenge'. They got married immediately but things didn't work out this time, too. Dimpy left Rahul in 2015. The reason was domestic violence and physical abuse. She later married Rohit Roy and has three children.\n\nThree years later, Rahul sealed the deal with Russian-Kazakh model Natalya, on November 30, 2018, as per Hindu rituals."
