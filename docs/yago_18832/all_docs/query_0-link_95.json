        "text": "Reality show 'star couple' Rahul Mahajan and wife Dimpy are likely to try their luck in Nach Baliye. The couple, who created history by being the first to marry on Indian reality television, have been approached for the fifth season of the dance reality show, which will go on air in the next few months. Here are the names of some other couples who may compete in the dance reality show\n\nRead iDiva for the latest in Bollywood, fashion looks, beauty and lifestyle news.\n\nRahul Mahajan & Dimpy\n\nThe only hitch is Rahul's dancing skills. \"I can't sing or dance. There is no sense of rhythm in my body, I can't even dance in pubs. I gave 16 takes for a 30-second dance step in Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayenge. I don't want to make a fool of myself. But yes, my partner will be strong as Dimpy is a good dancer and she is keen to do the show. I guess even if I make mistakes, it will be okay as people will be curious to see a non-dancer dance,\" says Rahul. He adds, \"I am neither confirming nor denying. But I am positive and interested in doing it.\"\n\nPooja Gor & Raj Singh Arora\n\nPooja of Mann Kee Awaaz Pratigya fame and actor-boyfriend Raj are also probable contestants. \"Raj and I are yet to make up our minds. I have been working non-stop for three years for...Pratigya, which has ended. We are still deciding whether we want to take a break and go on a holiday or do the show,\" says Pooja.\n\nJay & Suhasi Dhami\n\nAnother couple on the show is model-turned actress Suhasi Dhami and husband Jay. Says Suhasi, who became a household name with Yahan Main Ghar Ghar Kheli, \"We love the concept and it will definitely boost my career. It will make me more versatile.\""
