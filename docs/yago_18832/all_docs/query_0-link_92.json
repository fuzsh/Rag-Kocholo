        "text": "Mumbai: Bigg Boss 8 fans brace yourselves for another wild card entry on the show. And no it’s not British adult star Shanti Dynamite, this time the show will see Rahul Mahajan’s estranged wife Dimpy Ganguly making a wild card entry.\n\nThe names of the wildcard entries will be revealed on Friday, November 7. Apart from Dimpy, MTV Roadies contestant Renee Dhyani will also be making a wildcard entry on the show.\n\nDimpy’s entry will be very interesting because, her husband Rahul was also a contestant on the second season of the show. The show’s ratings topped the charts that year because of Rahul’s popularity.\n\nDimpy is also no stranger to reality shows. The former model was a contestant on ‘Swayamvar Season 2: Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jaayega’, where she instantly connected with her husband Rahul Mahajan, and the duo tied the knot on the show.\n\nIt will be quite interesting to see how Dimpy settles in on the hit show."
