        "text": "Rahul Mahajan has always been the talk of the town, and mainly for all the wrong reasons. Whether it was his involvement in the drug abuse case or he being an abusive husband to his ex-wife Shweta Singh, a controversial Bigg Boss inmate or an eligible bachelor luring 17 would-be brides on the reality show ‘Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega’, in which he got hitched to Dimpy Ganguly on 7th March 2010. But it seems there is already some trouble in paradise. His second wife Dimpy Ganguly has accused him of domestic violence, which was also the reason for his first marriage breaking down.\n\nThe son of the slain BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, Rahul’s personal life seems to have been through many ups and downs. With his marriage on the rocks, Ganesha, with the help of Vedic Astrology, takes a look at Rahul’s Kundali and predicts his future and compatibility with wife Dimpy Ganguly-Mahajan.\n\nRahul Mahajan Surya Kundali\n\nAstrological observations\n\nRahul’s Sun is in Cancer.\n\nVenus, Saturn and Mercury are in Gemini. Venus is in Rahu’s Constellation- Ardra.\n\nJupiter is retrograde.\n\nCurrently, Ketu the planet that plays major role in separation is transiting over Venus the significator of wife.\n\nAstrological Predictions\n\nRahul is very emotional. Hence, the need for an emotional union is high. Although he may be taking his own time to decide on the right match, powerful Mercury placed with Venus pushes him to think logically about the right kind of partner, and Saturn the planet that signifies delays is also with Venus so he may take a little time to decide on the relationship, still because Venus is in Rahu’s constellation and Rahu is the planet that creates illusions, he falls for someone and later feels as if a dream is over !\n\nKetu signifies spirituality and separation both. Ketu’s transit through Ardra Constellation over Natal Venus, which is in Rahu’s Constellation- Ardra, is creating a disillusioned situation in his life wherein, again he may find that the partner is incompatible or they don’t gel well.\n\nGanesha strongly feels that as Mercury is in it’s own sign Gemini with Saturn and Venus in Rahul’s Natal chart, he may finally come across someone mature in case if he comes across third match in the future and may stabilize. Time till March 2011 is quite decisive and rather turbulent for Rahul’s relationship with Dimpy. Estrangement is most likely.\n\nUnconventionality, illicit activities and legal matters may bother him till the said period at least, because of Ketu’s transit through Rahu’s Constellation. Anything that’s out of the rule or out of the custom should be avoided else Rahul may face problems (if he indulges into any such activities).\n\nGood luck and may Lord Ganesha bless Rahul and Dimpy.\n\nTo Get Your Personalized Solutions, Talk To An Astrologer Now!"
