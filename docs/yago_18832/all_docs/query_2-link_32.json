        "text": "Reality television shows instantly grab attention, they feed on and encourage the behavior that thrives on gossip and finding out what the man next door or even in a luxury house is thinking and doing. Reality shows peep unashamedly in the human relationships, and from the comfort of an armchair in front of a television set one can dissect and comment on the actions and reactions of the people who are taking part in the serial. One serial that grabbed attention of public for weeks on end and generated a lot interest was a show aired a few years back. It was called ‘Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega’, based on the ancient practice of Swyamwar the show featured one bridegroom to be Rahul Mahajan and several beautiful ladies, who try to convince him to marry them. The final episode actually pictuarized the real marriage between Rahul Mahajan and the girl he picked up from several beauties, Dimpy Ganguly. The whole country watched the marriage being performed in front of television cameras. The couple left the sets of the show with blessing of everyone who hoped that they live happily ever after; however, our hopes are dashed because now the newspapers are full of news of Rahul Mahajan’s divorce.\n\nA well known television station started, a few years back, a successful reality serial called ‘Swayamyar‘. One celebrity was picked up for each season to be the main star of the show; he or she has to pick up a life partner from the number of contestants who also take part in the show. In Season 1 Rakhi Sawant was the main star and she selected one person from the parade of good looking and talented young who did their best to attract her. She got engaged in the television. In Season 2 Rahul Mahajan was the main attraction, he had to select one girl out 15 beautiful, young and talented girls, who came from all parts of India hoping to be his bride. After weeks of judging, interacting and dating Rahul selected Dimpy Ganguly from Bengal as his bride. The marriage was performed in front of television camera full of pomp and glory related to marriages in India. There were Sangeet and Mehdi ceremonies where famous actresses from the television series danced to the lilting tunes of wedding songs. While the rest of the country watched with bated breath, Rahul came with a Barat, married his dream girl and took her away, with fond blessings from the rest of us that they both should live happily in their home.\n\nThe story is so much like a fairy tale where the prince picks up his Cinderella and they lived happily ever after that we forgot that there are no fairy tale marriages in real life. The story of Rahul Mahajan and his bride Dimpy Ganguly, unlike a fairy tale marriage, took an ugly turn when reports emerged in the press only two months after the wedding that there were deep differences between the couple. Dimpy left her husband’s house and went to live with her parents. There were rumors of abusive physical assault and Dimpy even displayed on the television her scared arms. However, Rahul managed to get her back and she came back to live with her husband. Television cameras captured the whole story again. The rest of us were happy that the loving couple is back in their love nest, but again rumors of disenchantment and abusive behavior continued and it is now reported that the couple has finally decided to separate by mutual consent. By now everyone is tired with this off and on marriage and there were no television cameras to flash it to be the rest of the country.\n\nRahul and Dimpy have filed divorce papers and asked the court to waive away six months’ reconciliation period that is generally given to estranged couple to make one more reconciliation attempt before seeking final legal separation. It is reported that Dimpy wants to settle down overseas and is in the hurry to finish the relationship quickly; she has already lived separately from Rahul for months. However, the court refused to grant an immediate divorce and asked the couple to attempt reconciliation for the last time before approaching the court for a final verdict. The divorce papers were filed in the court on May 2014, both Rahul and Dimpy have to wait a few months more before their divorce becomes final."
