        "text": "Attention seeker: Nupur Mehta has relished the attention she has received from the media recently\n\nThe media attention lavished on Nupur Mehta, an actress you wouldn't remember from any film you've ever seen, as she fluttered her false eyelashes and tried very hard to look upset at being linked to the cricket honey trap scandal, was yet another reminder of how little it takes to become famous in a world where shimmer blurs out substance.\n\nWith headline news increasingly starting to resemble Bigg Boss episodes, you don't have to achieve anything to become an instant celebrity. It was Rakhi Sawant who first cracked the code.\n\nTelevision news channels, she figured out, are in desperate need of viewers to stay ahead in ratings wars in a crowded marketplace. She made her private life a national spectacle to whet their insatiable appetite for the comic theatre of the gutter.\n\nAfter her, came the deluge. Dimpy Ganguly married Rahul Mahajan (the male Rakhi Sawant) on reality television and then had news television hyperventilating about her 'divorce'.\n\nPoonam Pandey just had to announce that she would do the Full Monty if Team India lifted the World Cup to make a splash on prime-time news and on the front pages of newspapers.\n\nDolly Bindra became an instant hit by dominating the fourth season of Bigg Boss with her foul mouth.\n\nAnd just in case you have forgotten, Mumbai-based DJ Jenny D appeared on a poster that went viral with just a diaphanous tricolour cloth 'to protect her modesty'.\n\nShe did it last Independence Day to promote the cause of women's emancipation. With specimens such as these, do women need abusive men to feel like filth?"
