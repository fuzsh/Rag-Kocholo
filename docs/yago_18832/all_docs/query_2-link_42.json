        "text": "Dimapur police after a long hunt finally managed to nab the conman who had swindled Rs 1.10 crore from unsuspecting Nagas. One of most wanted criminals in Nagaland, Abu Sayed, who duped hundreds of Naga people with promises of ‘doubling money’ was arrested from Lakhimpur in Assam on July 24 after evading arrest for nearly two years. The tragedy of our times is that people will go to any length to do stupid things all for the sake of greed. Whether it was the conman or the victims themselves, today our sole motive is to look for easy money through dubious means. Our society is today faced with moral bankruptcy. We subscribe to the formula “ends justify the means”. Everything is permissible as long as we become powerful or rich. There is nothing wrong if you want to achieve glory through power and wealth. But we must follow the right path to do this. It will be appropriate to mention here about the seven deadly sins which Mahatma Gandhi spoke about. Gandhi considered these seven sins as the most spiritually perilous to humanity. The seven deadly sins include ‘wealth without work’; ‘pleasure without conscience’; ‘science without humanity’; ‘knowledge without character’; ‘politics without principle’; ‘commerce without morality’; ‘worship without sacrifice’. Had Gandhi been alive today he would have been shocked to witness the extent of our depravity, brutality, selfishness and our hunger for power and wealth.\n\nIt would seem that the more modernity and progress we achieve, the greater is impoverishment of our value system. We are today living in the age of fraud and treason. Just look at the depravity we have reached. Take the case of the drama been played out on the so called holy matrimonial of part actor, part celebrity Rahul Mahajan also better known as the son of former BJP leader Pramod Mahajan. And mind you, the media is also to be blamed for this circus. The latest is that Dimpy Ganguly, who got married to Rahul Mahajan earlier this year, has reportedly left him after alleged violent abuse. Many of us who whale our time in gossip and tantalizing action will be aware that Dimpy got married to Rahul on Imagine TV's reality show Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega on March 6, 2010 this year. This is not the first time Rahul Mahajan has been accused of domestic violence. His first wife had also accused him of physically abusing her. After divorcing her, Rahul, whose only claim to fame is his wild antics, then decided to get married on national television after selecting from a bevy of young women. All along the media staged managed the so called reality show wasting huge money and precious time of viewers. And after all the tamasha, the marriage is about to fall apart. The media should just ignore people like Rahul Majahan. It has better things to do. Let us not give importance to such publicity seekers. Their motive is suspect. Maybe stay in the news, do extraordinary things (like getting married on prime time television) and sell the product to the gullible audience like you and me. The point is this: what are we teaching our younger generation? The public and media in particular must be careful about people who indulge in fraud and treason. Let us not patronize such elements nor become like them."
