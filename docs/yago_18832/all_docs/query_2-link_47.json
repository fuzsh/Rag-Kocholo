The ex-couple have been in the news on and off since they exchanged vows on a reality show, Rahul Dulhania Le Jayega - at times for loyalty test at other, domestic violence. In between the duo appeared together on a dance reality show.\n\nSpeaking about her impending entry into the Bigg Boss house, Dimpy said, \"Bigg Boss is one of the biggest shows on television. I am nervous about how will the show work out for me. While I am familiar with a few of the housemates, they have an advantage over me since they have already been living in the house for over a month now. I am going inside with a positive frame of mind and hopes of making some changes. Let's see how it goes!\"\n\nThe second wild card entry Renee is best remembered for her short temper and sharp tongue on Roadies. the small time actress is known to pick fights and use abusive language liberally.\n\nHowever, upon coming to Bigg Boss, Renee has a completely different agenda - to change this image about herself! Renee hopes to showcase her true self which according to her is much different from what people have perceived her to be for all these years. However, it remains to be seen if her aggressive image will make her renewed efforts seem like a complete waste or if the contestants will give her a wholehearted chance to showcase her good side.\n\nSaid Renee on her entry, \"I am extremely excited to be a part of Bigg Boss Season 8. I have been observing the contestants and their journey and hope to come across as a breath of fresh air for the viewers. I know about the image that viewers have of me and I am looking forward to showcasing my true personality and change all the preconceived notions. I am looking forward to making a lot of great memories and hope that the viewers will support me for this venture that I have undertaken!\"\n\nEarlier, speculations were rife that British adult star Shanti Dynamite would enter the house, but now the audience will have to settle down with dainty damsel Dimpy and sharp-tongued Renee."
