        "text": "On Indian television, nothing sells like reality shows. They not only break the monotony of drama series, but also serve as the perfect tool to satisfy voyeurism and, for some others, the irrepressible temptation to get their 60 seconds of fame. Though various shows have various formats, some of them have had their fair share of controversies and their credibility has occasionally been questioned with allegations that they are not as real as they claim to be - they are often premeditated and well rehearsed to grab more eyeballs and, in turn, higher TRPs.\n\nAn industry source says, \"Most reality shows are rigged and the contestants are told what to do. Production houses go to any extent to get the maximum TRPs for their shows. Sadly, there's no element of reality. Everything is stage-managed.\"\n\nNow, it is alleged that the makers of celebrity dance reality show Nach Baliye, which is supposed to feature real-life couples, have been auditioning several men to be paired opposite actress Sana Saeed. She, however, denies the buzz. \"I already do have a boyfriend and as far as Nach Baliye is concerned, we are only in talks right now,\" she adds.\n\nhitlist recalls some reality shows that have often reeked of pretension and orchestrated drama...\n\nDrastic steps\n\nTelly actors Megha Gupta and Naman Shaw teamed up for the fourth season of Nach Baliye and managed to win the runners-up title. The hit jodi, which seemed to be madly in love while performing together on stage, parted ways soon after the show. Later, rumours rolled out that the duo had faked their relationship to participate in the celeb reality show as Megha was then apparently involved with a director.\n\nCo-stars of TV show Kasturi, Karan Patel and Amita Chandekar took part in the same dance show as a \"couple\". But soon after their eviction, Karan's claim that Amita was never his girlfriend set tongues wagging. He said their relationship was \"a misunderstanding that had been allowed to go on for too long\".\n\nTrue or false?\n\nAshmit Patel and Veena Malik's PDA bordering on obscenity on Bigg Boss 4 became the talk of the town. The Pakistani actress would often claim that her love for Ashmit was real. However, when the show ended, they went their separate ways. However, in an interview, Veena was quoted saying that they had both decided to take their \"friendship\" to another level, but things didn't work out and she was the one who decided to call it quits. \"If I had given massage to Ashmit, he did the same for me. I washed his clothes too. What we had was emotional connect and never did anything for the camera,\" she had said.\n\nThe same edition had a lot more drama to offer to the audience. TV actress Sara Khan's beau Ali Merchant, also an actor, made a sudden entry into the Bigg Boss house after she was linked to Ashmit. The duo then got married on the show, which their close friends said was done at a payment of Rs 50 lakh to up the show's TRP, but the channel denied the allegations. Two months later, when Sara was eliminated, news trickled in about them getting divorced. Interestingly, Ali confirmed the \"wedding farce\" saying, \"I got married on TV for publicity.\" However, Sara said: \"That marriage may be for publicity for him, but not for me.\"\n\nKnot real\n\nCelebs like Mallika Sherawat and Rakhi Sawant found 'prospective partners' on national television, courtesy The Bachelorette India - Mere Khayalon Ki Mallika and Rakhi Ka Swayamvar."
