        "text": "Bigg Boss 8 has decided to bring in more drama by introducing reality show veterans as the new wild card entrants. Rahul Mahajan's estranged wife Dimpy and former Roadies contestant Renee Dhyani entered the house to spice things up.\n\nThe show's season 8, which went on air almost a month ago, has failed to create waves and thus, a drop in its ratings has been noticed. The new contestants who have already appeared in other reality shows are all set to bring in the necessary drama to grab more eyeballs. Rahul was a participant in the celeb reality show in season 2, and now Dimpy is expected to indulge in similar drama that earlier made her estranged husband a household name.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe duo has been in the news on and off since they exchanged vows on a reality show, Rahul Dulhania Le Jayega, - at times for loyalty test on each other or reports of domestic violence. The duo also appeared together on dance reality show Nach Baliye. Dimpy was a cheerful contestant on Rahul Dulhania Le Jayega, where she competed with more than a dozen girls to be chosen by Rahul as his bride.\n\nDimpy has been keeping her fingers crossed regarding her stay inside the Bigg Boss house. Meanwhile, Renee was known for her short temper and sharp tongue on Roadies. The starlet was warned for the excessive usage of abusive language on the show.\n\nRenee is expected to offer some low-brow drama, as her USP. Renee hopes to display her true self. She says that she is much different from what people have perceived her to be for all these years."
