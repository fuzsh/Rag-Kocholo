Her grandmother named her Zahida, but her family insisted on keeping Veena as her first name. Her father often remained away from home, so she was brought up by her grandmother and mother until she was in her late teens when her grandmother died. Malik grew up expressing an interest in joining the film industry and her grandmother decided to encourage her. Her father however disliked the idea and pondered over his daughter's fate in an industry that was deemed unsuitable for girls in Pakistan and initially resisted his daughter's attempts to pursue a career in entertainment.

As per the sources familiar with the matter, Salman has demanded more money to host the episode, than Big B.

It is amazing to see how people react under unique circumstances and to what levels they can go to win in a competition. I am a very straight-forward person and am clear as the shows host as well, that I will not take any hypocrisy and politics lightly. For those who play clean, they will always find their best friend in me those who dont, be ready to expect the worst.\n\nWith Salman as the host, viewers should be prepared in season of Bigg Boss to witness as much action outside the house as is expected inside. Salmans inimitable style, candid persona and exceptional sense of humour is sure to make Bigg Boss Season-4 memorable. said, Ashvini Yardi, Head  Programming, COLORS.\n\nBigg Boss presents the unique combination of reality and real unscripted drama. It is the ultimate reality show where 14 handpicked strangers are locked in a house, for close to 85 days  with 35 cameras following their every move 24x7 and Bigg Boss, the ultimate authority in the house who ensures that their stay is anything but comfortable.
