        "text": "Reality show star Rahul Mahajan, who got married in a TV programme, was on Tuesday allowed by a Delhi court to get back his passport to go to the Maldives on honeymoon.\n\nOutside the courtroom, Mahajan said, “I am very happy with the outcome. I just want to pack my bags and leave.”\n\nThe court, however, made it clear the relief would not be used as an extension of the show, including shootings by him.\n\n“Mahajan shall give an undertaking that his visit shall be a private visit and in no way extension of the show... there shall be no shooting done at Maldives between March 9 and 31,” the court said.\n\nHe was also asked by Additional Sessions Judge J.P.S. Malik to give an affidavit that his marriage contracted on March 6 was a bonafide and not for purpose of the TV show.\n\nAs the conditions for release of his passport, the court directed Mahajan, son of slain BJP leader Pramod Mahajan to get his marriage registered under the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act within two months, apart from depositing Rs 5 lakh each as fixed deposit and a personal bond immediately.\n\nMahajan, 35, got married on Saturday to 21-year-old Dimpy Ganguly, a model and dancer, on TV reality show ‘Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega’.\n\nDuring arguments, prosecutor Ahmed Khan opposed Mahajan’s plea saying the kind of reality show in which he participated and contracted the marriage should not be encouraged as they leave a bad impression on the minds of young viewers."
