        "text": "From getting married on national TV to getting divorced and now leading a blissful life in Dubai with three kids post-second marriage, Dimpy Ganguly has found her happiness. Former actress and now a mother to three beautiful kids, Dimpy previously spoke to ETimes TV on several occasions and she had opened up about how she had shut herself from everyone after her divorce, Rohit Roy instilling faith in her, her pregnancies and a lot more:\n\nDimpy shared how she had shut herself down from everyone and even her parents. Her only confidante back then was Rohit. She said, “The initial years were hard because I had to start from scratch. I relocated and we started everything fresh. So it was hard. The only way to do it was to completely disconnect. That’s why there was a period of complete silence from my life. I didn’t want to talk to anybody. There was a time when I trusted nobody. Not even trusting, I moved away from everybody… including my own parents. We were in touch… but what I was going through, what I was thinking… they had no idea. I was dealing with a lot and I wasn’t ready to talk.”\n\nThe former model and actress, who got married to Rahul Mahajan in Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayenge, did shows like Nach Baliye 5, Bigg Boss 8, Kahani Chandrakanta Ki and many others, stayed away from the limelight post her bitter divorce in 2015. She shared, “I didn’t take up any project. I just wanted some time to heal and to figure out my way ahead, start a new life. Once I was in a happy space again, then I came out. I made friends, I did things that I used to do.”\n\nTalking about how she found solace in her friend Rohit, Dimpy said back then, “Rohit was my olive branch from everything that I was going through. At that point, my only friend, philosopher, guide and confidante… everything was Rohit. It was easy than having too many opinions, I only had one source from where I could draw my inspiration from. There was only one person, who knew everything about me and that made it a lot easier.”\n\nDimpy went with her gut feeling and trusted Rohit. She said, “There was not much thinking into it. I met him and something just felt right. Whether it was pure luck or instinctive, I can’t point a finger towards one thing that made me trust him. I still can’t. I met him and I felt he is the person I need to trust. There was no other thought,” adding, “I wouldn’t change a single thing in my life, however it may have been. I needed to go through all of this. I think all of that was required for me to have a different perspective towards life. So, I won’t change a thing.”\n\nHaving two school-going kids and baby no. 3 on the way, Dimpy had sleepless nights and spoke about the challenges she faced. She shared, “When you go from 1 to 2nd baby, you divide the time accordingly and you get very comfortable. When you have a third person, the newborn takes all of your time. I am breastfeeding and suddenly it’s like all your time is being taken up by the baby and the other 2 babies are suddenly wondering ‘where did mamma go?’ The sleep deprivation takes a toll on your memory. That sometimes get to me. At times, I have completely forgotten that I have to cook a meal. There’s food for the kids, but I had to cook for myself and I would forget.”\n\nDimpy embraced motherhood for the third time last year on July 27. Dimpy and Rohit are parents to 3 kids – Reanna (6), Aryan (3) and Rishaan. Dimpy believed in the concept of having a big family and said, “I feel very good about myself. When I look at my family, I feel ‘wow, I have a big family’. It’s great. I don’t think anybody I have known before has imagined me to be a mom of 3. I like the admiration people have when I tell them I have 3 children. Kids don’t weigh you down, they inspire you to do more. We always liked big families. Living in Dubai, we see a lot of big families. It is not a common thing in India, but around me I have a lot of friends with big families. I see the kids are just so happy.”\n\nDimpy and Rohit are living it up in their own way in Dubai. Having shifted to a bigger space, Dimpy often gives a glimpse of her life with the kids. While she is a hands-on mom, hubby Rohit is the bread-earner. Dimpy shared, “He is doing his best as a father, he is doing his best as a provider. His job is extremely taxing.” Talking about shifting to a bigger house, Dimpy had told us, “She had shared, “It’s actually a villa. I got more bedrooms, we live in a community. It’s got a huge park. It’s really nice for the kids. I was a bit apprehensive before as we were in Downtown Dubai. It was the centre of everything. However, moving here and living in a community I feel brings all the families together.”\n\nWhen asked about if she wished to get back to work, Dimpy shared that her plate is full right now. However she said, “Maybe once my children are older, I might think of starting something of my own… become a mompreneur or something of that sort. I might do something on social media. For now, I would love to chronicle my journey.”"
