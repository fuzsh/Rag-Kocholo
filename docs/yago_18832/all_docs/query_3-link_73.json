        "text": "Frankly, I was very busy with my other television as well as off-screen dance shows. Also, I am selective about my work and after doing one reality show, I wasn’t quite sure if I would like to be part of another, even if it was in the same format. Fortunately, when the producers approached me with Nach Baliye 4, I felt certain about taking it up.\n\nI think Hussain has been an experienced host and a very good one that, while I am a novice at the job. When it came to doing homework for my role, I just opted to be at ease with myself rather than trying to imitate any established anchors.\n\nNow that you have been a participant as well as the show host, which one do you find more appealing?\n\nHonestly, both roles have their pros and cons. As a host, it is very tiring since I have to shoot for two episodes a day. But on the other hand, as a performer, there is a constant pressure to not just practise every day, but also give your best shot on the final day within just three minutes.\n\nI am not trying to be politically correct but I think it is too early to predict winners at this stage. And this is not only because we are still far away from the D-day, but also because the results in every episode have been fluctuating.\n\nUnlike last year where certain teams, like that of Sanjeeda and me, were never in the danger zone, this time the patterns are random. A team that gathers jury and audience popularity in one episode is seen in the danger zone in the next episode. I think we will have to wait till time discloses the winners.\n\nAs a matter of fact, yes. All the three members of the jury — Karisma Kapoor, Arjun Rampal and Farah Khan — are independent in their judgement. They stick to their point of views without getting affected by each other’s opinion. This is definitely a great advantage for the participants as well as the show.\n\nApart from Nach Baliye 4, do we see you being a part of any other reality show in the near future?\n\nWell, I am someone who takes things as they come. Though I have been getting quite a few offers for various reality shows, so far nothing has got me excited.\n\nAs a viewer, I find Bigg Boss very entertaining. Rahul Mahajan was my favourite since he is funny, even stupid at times, but always a pleasure to watch. However, being a participant would be a different ball game. I am an extremely restless person and to stay in a confined zone without any contact with my mother, Sanjeeda and friends sounds an extremely difficult task. May be few years down the line, if and when I mellow down, I can opt for participating in the show."
