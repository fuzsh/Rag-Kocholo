        "text": "The second season of Bigg Boss saw two couples, and both involved the same man. Rahul Mahajan, who was rumored to be in a relationship with Payal Rohatgi even before the season started continues his romance with Payal before shifting to Monica Bedi in the later months. How he could manage to attract two women in less than three months is beyond our understanding. The relationships died natural deaths after the season ended. Now Rahul is married to Dimpy Mahajan, thanks to another reality show Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega, while Payal is engaged to wrestler Sangram Singh, who was seen in the last season of Bigg Boss.\n\nImage courtesy: Deccan Chronicles\n\nWhile there was no open revelation about it, it was quite visible that the Polish-German model Claudia Ciesla and Mr India Pravesh Rana were getting comfortable in each other’s presence. However, once the show ended, we heard no news about them. One more story that made rounds during this season was the one-sided love of Kamaal Rashid Khan, who refused to eat until Claudia said I love you to him, which by the way never happened, and he was caught red-handed eating in the kitchen when he thought everyone was asleep.\n\nHad the season stuck to its original contestants, there would either be no couples or some with same sexes, because on the day it was premiered, only Shakti Kapoor went inside with 12 ladies and one transgender. However, the wild card entries brought in both entertainment and chemistry inside the house. While Amar Upadhyay was seen hitting on Vida Samadzai in the house, Akashdeep Saighal (also known as Sky) and Pooja Bedi too became a couple after the season, the one that is still going strong. Also, Mahek Chahal got proposed by her best friend Danish Khan, right before the results were announced. Sadly, the couple could not hold its engagement for long.\n\nWhile it was a speculation that models Niketan Madhok and Karishma Kotak were involved when they went inside the Bigg Boss house, she was later involved with television actor Vishal Karwal, who was rumored to be with fellow contestant Sana Khan. Apparently, Vishal and Karishma are still going strong. Santosh Shukla was seen trying to impress Aashka Goradia, but that didn’t materialise.\n\nImage courtesy BCCL"
