        "text": "Hindustan Times | By, New Delhi\n\nAfter Ali, reality TV show contestants Renee Dhyani and Dimpy are all set to enter Bigg Boss 8 house as the next wild card entries this season.\n\nAfter Ali, reality TV show contestants Renee Dhyani and Dimpy Ganguly Mahajan are all set to enter Bigg Boss 8 house as the next wild card entries this season.\n\nOn Thursday's episode, Dimpy made a rocking entry with the song Aa Re Pritam Pyaare. Only, her face was covered with the\n\nghoonghat\n\n. Karishma was apparently 'mortified' to see Dimpy once her face was revealed.\n\nDimpy Mahajan now prefers to call herself Dimpy, post her separation from Rahul Mahajan. Winner of a reality show, Dimpy rose to fame when she married Rahul Mahajan. They were the first couple in India to get married on national television on the show Rahul Ka Swayamvar (2010). However, the marriage only lasted for four years after which they filed for divorce.\n\nSpeaking about Bigg Boss house, Dimpy earlier said, \"Bigg Boss is one of the biggest shows on television. I am nervous about how will the show work out for me. While I am familiar with a few of the housemates, they have an advantage over me since they have already been living in the house for over a month now. I am going inside with a positive frame of mind and hopes of making some changes. Let’s see how it goes.\"\n\nRenee Dhyani, a popular contestant on MTV’s Roadies Season 8, gained prominence as one of the more loud contestants who had a strong opinion and is not afraid to voice it. She is known to be short-tempered as well.\n\nRenee, however, claims to have a completely different agenda on Bigg Boss and says she want a change of image. Before entering the house, Renee said, \"I am extremely excited to be a part of Bigg Boss Season 8. I have been observing the contestants and their journey and hope to come across as a breath of fresh air for the viewers. I know about the image that viewers have of me and I am looking forward to showcasing my true personality and change all the preconceived notions. I am looking forward to making a lot of great memories and hope that the viewers will support me for this venture that I have undertaken.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Bigg Boss promises housemates some comedy, action, madness and drama through a buzzer set up in the garden area. For the comedy, we see people dressed up as gorillas and bears entering the house and creating some entertaining mayhem.\n\nThere is also a dose of action as ninja assassins and sword fighters come visiting. The ninjas bring along a damsel in distress who the contestants are supposed to rescue. However, the hostage that the ninjas leave behind is wild card entry Renee.\n\nIn the evening, Dimpy makes her entry while dancing to item song Aa Re Pritam Pyaare along with some goons and cops. The contestants join the guests only to realise that this, too, is another wild card entry.\n\nCatch all the drama at 9pm on COLORS TV.\n\nCatch every big hit, every wicket with Crickit, a one stop destination for Live Scores, Match Stats, Infographics & much more.
