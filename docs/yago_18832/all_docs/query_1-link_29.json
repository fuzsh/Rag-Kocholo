She married Rahul on the reality TV show Rahul Dulhania Le Jayega in 2010. They separated in 2013 and the two appeared on Bigg Boss Season 8 in 2014.\n\nDimpy got engaged to Rohit in October this year.\n\nShe celebrated with a bachelorette party on last Wednesday and the party was all about masks and fancy dresses.\n\nUNI SHS RJ AE 1926"
