        "text": "If you think about it, the reality TV formula works simply for the shock factor associated with it. Pick any reality show and you will be sure to find at least one contestant who keeps the madness going by giving us the kind of moments that always get us saying, ‘yeh kya ho raha hai!’\n\nBut then again, there is something about cringe TV that keeps us intrigued and glued to the screen which is also the reason why most of them have TRPs that are bomb AF. Well, you’d totally agree if you happen to be a reality show fanatic just like us. And if that’s the case, you are sure to love this compilation of 10 of the weirdest moments in the Indian reality history so far. Scroll down:\n\nWhen Shehnaaz Gill Started Beating Herself On Bigg Boss\n\nInstagram\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBigg Boss 13 has been the most successful season of the cult reality show to date. A huge part of this success has been credited to Shehnaaz Gill, the self-confessed attention lover. In all honesty, she was quite entertaining and most of the time a delight to watch. Well, this was only till she got all the attention that she craved for. Things quickly went haywire once she started losing her grip of the same and there came a point when she got so upset by it all that she started beating herself in frustration. She did this more than once during the run of the show and also used it as a threat to get her wishes fulfilled. Just too much!\n\nWhen Salman Told Rashami About Her Boyfriend’s Marriage On Weekend Ka War\n\nInstagram\n\nThings were going suspiciously well between Rashami Desai and Arhaan Khan in Bigg Boss 13 when Salman Khan dropped a major bomb. It was really, really hard to digest and mind-blowingly unbelievable when the host revealed that while Arhaan might have proposed Rashami for marriage, he actually has a past that she doesn’t even have the slightest hint about. It was revealed during the episode that Arhaan, in fact, has been married before and also has a kid from that marriage. Later on, other guests in the show also warned Rashami about him and told her how he has been misusing her name, house, and resources for his own gain all this while.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen We Saw 16 Women Fighting For Rahul Mahajan\n\nImage Source\n\nI think the fact that we had a total of 16 girls fighting for Rahul Mahajan was fantastical enough to really gape at for the starters. However, it got a bit too eerie even for our cringe-crazed heart when Rahul announced that he was actually going to get married on national television and we actually had to witness sangeet and mehendi of three women out of which only one was going to marry the guy. So bizarre and so cruel!\n\nWhen Rahul And Dimpy Went To Emotional Atyachar\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nImage Source\n\nIn what looked like a clear case of the scripted reality show, just a few months after marrying Rahul Mahajan on national TV, Dimpy Ganguly was seen on Emotional Atyachar asking for a loyalty check to be conducted on Rahul Mahajan. But, of course, it got even weirder. The woman sent on an undercover mission to entice him and check his loyalty, ended up being with Nikunj Malik, the runner up of Rahul Dhulaniya Le Jaega. Quite surprisingly, Rahul conducted himself really well and didn’t even raise as much as a brow even after finding out that his wife had a loyalty check conducted on him. So weird! Also, so scripted.\n\nEverytime Someone Talks To Oracle On Splistvilla\n\nFacebook\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOkay, we are sure that MTV Splitsvilla really, really underestimated the audience’s intellect when they came up with the concept of Oracle in the show. We were told that the makers have legit found real soulmates by running an algorithm test on the contestants. However, it was just an insult to our intelligence every time the contestants were presented in front of the huge pyramid-like Oracle and legit asked questions like, “Oracle, kya hum ek ideal match hain.”\n\nWhen Skulls & Roses Turned Out To Be Nothing But A Soft Porn Show\n\nInstagram\n\nRaghu Ram was pretty sure that he has finally come with the ultimate reality show that will trump his Roadies’ success when he started promoting Skulls and Roses. Quite naturally, it was a huge disappointment when it turned out to be nothing but a soft porn show. It followed a weird concept, where contestants were treated like slaves and women were openly objectified in almost every episode. Each one of their so-called “chemistry tests” had us going “yeh kya ho raha hai!” Just for context, dialogues like “Mat kar, mat kar, erection aa raha hai mujhko” and “Main badi bold aur sexy kisim ki ladki hoon” were common AF in the show.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen Vishal & Madhurima Were Just Too Much\n\nInstagram\n\nWe don’t know what was going on in ex-flames Madhurima Tuli and Vishal Aditya Singh’s mind when they decided to participate together in not one but two reality shows right after their break up. Before creating havoc in the Bigg Boss 13 house, the two participated in Nach Baliye 9 with the hopes of mending their relationship. However, things got really ugly when the two could not wait for even the cameras to stop rolling before engaging in a heated argument over a recent fight where Madhurima had apparently slapped Vishal! The topic enraged the former so much that she ended up smashing the mike right in front of the judges. Too much violence and this continued happening in the Bigg Boss house as well. We are yet to decide what really was happening with their strange (not to forget) abusive relationship.\n\nWhen Rannvijay Asked For A Contestant’s Chest Size\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nInstagram\n\nOtherwise known for his graceful demeanour, Rannvijay left everyone surprised after he ended up asking a potential contestant, Adhelna about her chest size during Roadies auditions. It was pretty unsettling. However, he soon revealed the motive behind the questions and shared how the girl had actually made one of her friends’ text Nikhil about her chest size so as to increase her chances of getting selected.\n\nWhen Swami Om Threw Urine On His Fellow Contestants\n\nImage Source\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrom getting in an ugly fistfight with a woman on national television to stealing bicycles, you name it and Bigg Boss 10 fame Swami Om has done it! But wait there’s more! During his appearance on Bigg Boss, he also claimed he has to follow a strict discipline to preserve his practice and was later seen binging on tandoori chicken and kebabs. Notorious for agitating people by his antics, Swami Om crossed all boundaries after he ended up throwing his urine on fellow contestants Bani J and Rohan Mehra. It was really unsettling to watch and he was duly thrown out of the show even before we could gather ourselves and react to what had happened.\n\nWhen Varun & Divya Ended Up Getting Together In A Weird ‘Coincidence’\n\nInstagram\n\nWeeks after Benafsha & Priyank were seen cozying up on Bigg Boss 12, their ex-partners Divya and Varun were seen getting close in Ace of Space. And while all of this could have been all organic, it has just been an unappetising watch to see all of these reality stars continuously switching partners in weird coincidences.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nSo fam, which one of these reality show moments was the most bizarre of them all?\n\nFeatured Image: Instagram"
