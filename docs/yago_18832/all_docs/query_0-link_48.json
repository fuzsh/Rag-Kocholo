        "text": "A source spilled the beans\n\nLove and marital life seem to be turbulent spots for Mahajan. A source close to development spoke to The Times of India and said, \"Compatibility issues were there between the two since the beginning. However, they stretched their marriage as long as they could. They parted ways last year and filed for divorce.\" The couple has not issued an official statement yet.\n\nMahajan's failed conquests of love\n\nMahajan's first marriage was with Shweta Singh in 2006. It lasted for two years and the couple parted ways in 2008. Next, he got married to Dimpy Ganguly, who he met on the matrimonial reality show, Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jaayega. The duo got married in 2010 and parted ways in 2015. Reportedly, Ganguly accused Mahajan of physical abuse."
