Read on to find out more...\n\nThe biggest party is about to take place in Bigg Boss 8 tonight. While the inmates were thrilled to party with their celebrity friends, there was one contestant, who was dreading about a particular guest. We are talking about Dimpy Ganguly.\n\nDimpy, who became famous after marrying Rahul Mahajan on national television in a reality show had recently filed for divorce. The fact that her buddy inside the house Gautam Gulati, invited Rahul for a party (as part of their recent luxury budget task) ruined Dimpy's mood.\n\nRahul accepted the invitation and went inside the house, and surprisingly there were no awkward moments between him and his estranged wifey. In fact, the duo were quite cordial towards each other.\n\nSince Rahul happens to be a former Bigg Boss contestant himself, did he give any tips to Dimpy? Well, to know that we will have to wait and watch tonight's episode of Bigg Boss 8, which is going to be quite interesting.\n\nStay tuned to BollywoodLife for the latest scoops and updates from Bollywood, Hollywood, South, TV and Web-Series."
