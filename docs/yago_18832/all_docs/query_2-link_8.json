        "text": "Rahul Mahajan and Dimpy Ganguly put up a show of togetherness in public for the first time today after a quarrel on Friday when the Kolkata-based model walked out to return the same day following an apparent patch up.\n\nThe couple who got married just in March this year visited the famous Sidhhivinayak temple here this afternoon to seek blessings.\n\n\"We have no issues between us and I love my wife. We are together and therefore came to take blessings of the God,\" Rahul, who kept his arm around Dimpi's shoulders, told reporters.\n\nHowever, Dimpi. who had earlier spoke of her marital woes and physical abuse, refused to speak to the media. (Text/Photo: PTI)\n\nSoon after she was back in the Mahajan family home but says she needs time to think. \"He says he has regretted what he did. I need some time alone to think,” she maintained.\n\nAs the heir to his father's political legacy, Rahul Mahajan had it all. But he has squandered his legacy with allegations of drug abuse and repeated domestic violence.\n\nRahul's first marriage ended after allegations of violence. His television stint - an attempt to restore his battered image. But looks like the real life re-run could come in the way.\n\nRahul Mahajan's marriage to Kolkata model and actress Dimpy Ganguly earlier this year, marked a new chapter in the history of reality television in India. In some ways it also signaled the emergence of Rahul as a celebrity in his own right, away from the shadow of his father, late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan.\n\nRahul has lived a roller coaster life since his father was sensationally murdered by his own brother Pravin Mahajan in 2006. In the photo Rahul (C) is seen performing the last rites for his father Pramod Mahajan, ahead of his cremation at the Shivaji Park in Mumbai, on May 4, 2006. (Photo: AFP)\n\nThat was the first time Rahul was seen on national television, comforting his sister and mother. His stoic demeanour impressed many and it appeared only a matter of time before he would be inducted into the BJP to fill the void left by his father's untimely death. In the photo Rahul (R) is seen with senior BJP leader Gopinath Munde (L) as he leaves after lighting the pyre of the late Pramod Mahajan on May 4, 2006. (Photo: AFP) The inset shows him with his mother Rekha Mahajan.\n\nBut things didn't quite turn out like that. Just a month after Pramod Mahajan's death, his family woke up to another shock. On June 3, 2006, Rahul was hospitalised after an alleged cocaine overdose. His father's close aide, Bibek Maitra was declared dead on arrival at the hospital.\n\nAfter being in a critical condition for days, Rahul recovered. However that wasn't the end of his troubles. On his discharge from hospital on July 6, 2006, he was arrested by the Delhi Police on charges of drug possession and consumption.\n\nRahul Mahajan (R) addressed a press conference in New Delhi on June 15, 2006. Embroiled in a drug abuse case, he pointed fingers at \"a section of the society\" for having a hidden agenda against his family and claimed that he had not committed any legal or moral wrong. After his release on bail on June 14, Rahul addressed a crowded press conference but refused to comment on any aspect of the drug abuse case against him, saying the matter was sub judice and any statement will prejudice his defense. (Photo: AFP)\n\nShweta had filed for the divorce on grounds of incompatibility and mutual consent of both parties. On August 1, 2008, Rahul Mahajan and his wife were granted a divorce by a Gurgaon court. District and session Judge Ramendra Jain granted their divorce after both parties mutually agreed on the move.\n\nHowever there were off moments too, as Rahul sometimes got carried away in his bid for reality TV glory. The show itself came under the scanner for being a little too risqué for family viewing.\n\nOne of the talking points of the show was the on and off chemistry between him and Monica Bedi. Though Monica remained reticent in front of the media, Rahul went on record to admit he had a soft corner for the actress.\n\nBut winning Bigg Boss 2 was clearly not on Rahul's agenda. Once he had topped the popularity charts, Rahul decided to break out of confinement along with three other housemates - Zulfi Sayed, Raja Chaudhury and Ashutosh Kaushik. While the other three reportedly apologised for their behaviour, Rahul was evicted from the show after refusing to follow their example."
