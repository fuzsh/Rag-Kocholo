        "text": "Reality TV show personality and now a mom of three, Dimpy Ganguly has come a long way. From being a model, getting married on national TV, coming out of a bad marriage to now leading a blissful family life, Dimpy Ganguly manifested her way to a happy living. Dimpy had exclusively spoken to ETimes TV from Dubai home and shared her life experiences from her past, pregnancies and her family life. Here take a look at her journey from her on-screen life to living the life with her husband and three beautiful kids.\n\nDimpy Ganguly recently embraced motherhood for the third time. She is now mom to three beautiful kids – Reanna, Aryan and Rishaan. About having a big family, Dimpy exclusively told ETimes TV, “You know women who are considering motherhood or parenthood or more children… Yes, it is hard. Believe me, of late, I am only meeting mothers who have 3-4 kids. The amount of things they are able to do is just amazing.”\n\nDimpy married Rohit Roy, a businessman from Dubai in 2015. About how Rohit became an integral part of her life, Dimpy had said, “Rohit was my olive branch from everything that I was going through. At that point, my only friend, philosopher, guide and confidante… everything was Rohit. It was easy than having too many opinions, I only had one source from where I could draw my inspiration from. There was only one person, who knew everything about me and that made it a lot easier.” She had a traditional style wedding and it was a grand affair. She had her first kid in 2016, her son in 2020 and the third child in 2022. Dimpy spoke about her husband being the breadwinner of the family and she is happily consumed with the kids. She said, “He travels 3 times a week. I am quite ok that way. I have settled up like this is my day and this is what I need to do. He is doing his best as a father, he is doing his best as a provider. His job is extremely taxing.”\n\nAbout pursuing a career in near future, Dimpy said, “Honestly, I am far from India. Had I been in India, I would have probably continued my career. My career is in India and my family is in Dubai. That’s a big challenge for me. I am willing to push myself but I don’t know how much I can push myself to get into a corporate role. Maybe once my children are older, I might think of starting something of my own… become a mompreneur or something of that sort. I might do something on social media.”\n\nBefore having her third baby, Dimpy shifted to a new and bigger house for her big family. They moved to a villa in a community. About it, she had shared, “We have moved to a new house. It’s actually a villa. I got more bedrooms, we live in a community. It’s got a huge park. It’s really nice for the kids. I was a bit apprehensive before as we were in Downtown Dubai. It was the centre of everything. However, moving here and living in a community I feel brings all the families together.”\n\nThe actress had opened up about her difficult past, healing from all the negativity and coming back stronger. She had said, “Many times, people urge me to speak up, talk about it, but… why? Talking about it would take up some time. I would have to invest some time, and give importance to something that is completely immaterial to me.”\n\nAfter her troubled first marriage, Dimpy had completely guarded herself from the public. About that phase of starting life afresh and picking up the pieces again, Dimpy had said, “The initial years were hard because I had to start from scratch. I relocated and we started everything fresh. So it was hard. The only way to do it was to completely disconnect. That’s why there was a period of complete silence from my life. I didn’t want to talk to anybody, I didn’t want to do anything. Even though I had time, I didn’t take up any project. I just wanted some time to heal and to figure out my way ahead, start a new life. Once I was in a happy space again, then I came out.”"
