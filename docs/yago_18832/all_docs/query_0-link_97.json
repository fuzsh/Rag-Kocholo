        "text": "Mumbai: Rahul Mahajan`s wife Dimpy, who had accused him of beating her, is back with him and says they are seeking counseling to smooth out bumps in their marriage. Dimpy, 22, who married Rahul, 36, son of late BJP leader Pramod Mahajan, with much fanfare on a television reality show `Rahul Dulhaniya Le Jayega` in March, walked out on her marriage last month, accusing him of \"punching, kicking and dragging\" her. But a compromise was reached between the couple with the help of Rahul`s mother and the stars say they are now back to leading a normal life. \"Whatever does not kill you makes you stronger. I feel strong and I feel the strength in our relationship. I have accepted it and I know that I love Rahul and want to be with him forever,\" Dimpy said. The Kolkata-based model is reportedly going to be one of the cast members in `Bigg Boss 4`, a show that made Rahul a TV star. Both Rahul and Dimpy denied that what happened in July was a publicity stunt to catch more TV assignments. \"We were in a mess but it was so disheartening to see that the situation was turned against us,\" Dimpy told a news channel. Rahul said there were some communication gap between them and they are trying their best to understand each other. He, however, refused to comment on his Bigg Boss housemate Payal Rohatagi`s accusations that he was harassing her. Rahul said he was planning to contest 2014 general elections. PTI"
