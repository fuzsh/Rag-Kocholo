I’ve learned to love it. It’s a savory cream cheese they sell here. Requeijão cremoso is what its generic name is, and like cheddar cheese in America there is a noted difference with different brands. Catipury is like Xerox, the gold standard when it comes to requeijão . The flavor is wonderful, and unique, and I’ll miss it. It’s like cream cheese, but with more flavor like Edam (those little babybel cheeses I loved as a kid). Either way it is yummy and creamy, and they don’t have it all over the place in the US, unless you haul up to a Brazilian grocery store. Let’s be honest, the only ethnic stores I will take the time to visit are Asian ones, sorry Brazil.

So anyway, the point is you can TRY and knock it off at home. Why not right? This isn’t too difficult of a recipe, and as I live in Brazil, I have not tried it yet, since heck I get the good stuff. But if you are not in Brazil (and for me once I return to the US), here’s a recipe from TudoGostoso… meaning everything yummy. So how can it be wrong?

Catipury

8 tablespoons corn starch

1 liter of milk (about 4 1/4 cups)

200 g butter (just a smidge less than a cup)

2 cups grated mozzarella

2 cups grated cheese curd (good luck on that, I’ve seen it but I know not too common)

1 can cream (about a cup)

Thicken the cornstarch, milk and butter in a pan. Once custard like, add the cream, mozzeralla and grated cheese curd together, with the cornstarch mixture. Beat everything together in a mixure

Refrigerate for 6 hours, then serve.

Yum Sugar had this recipe, which is easier if you don’t want to deal with the above.

Ingredients:

2 packages (9 oz.) Philadelphia Cream Cheese

1 lb. Munster cheese

Preparation:

Over very low heat, melt the two cheeses together until they are completely blended. Remove the mixture from the heat, place it in a container and let it cool. Then put it in the refrigerator for a few hours and after it has been chilled, it can be used in any recipe calling for Catupiry.
