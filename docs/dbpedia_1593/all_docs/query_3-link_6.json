In the original recipe, after the skimmed milk had been curdled, de-wheyed and cooked, it was mixed with cream – a formula still followed by industrial manufacturers. In addition to being a classic at breakfast, spread on a slice of warm bread, it is widely used in cooking: mixed with shredded chicken breast, or added to rice dishes, pasta sauces, cake batters, and savory pastries fillings, among other uses."
