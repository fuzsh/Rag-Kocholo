For those that don’t read Portuguese, here’s my attempt at the lyrics:\n\nVu pra Cametá\n\nCametá\n\nVu pra Cametá\n\nTava numa roça com um trampo meia sola\n\nPassava muita fome\n\nE até pedia esmola\n\nFoi quando a minha sogra que morava\n\nno bengola me arrumou\n\nUm bom emprego que eu achava era uma droga\n\nEra só varrer\n\nEu desprezei o meu serviço\n\nQue era só varrer\n\nComprei muamba na fronteira\n\nE vim revender\n\nNa capital, tenho comercio\n\nPara eu vender\n\nMuambeiro lá na barreio\n\nSou camelo com meu avó\n\nJá fui peixeiro,\n\nCaranguejiero,\n\nCoveiro eu sou,\n\nVendia Avon,\n\nmais to liso e vou a voltar pro interior.\n\nVu pra Cametá.\n\nCametá.\n\nVu, vu, vu, vu pra Cametá.\n\nCametá.Eu tô no barreio.\n\nVu, vu, vu, vu pra Cametá.\n\nEu sou muambeiro.\n\nVu, vu, vu, vu pra Cametá.Olha só, eu tava na pior.\n\nMorando com minha avó\n\nNo meio do gapó!\n\nEu tô no barreio.\n\nVu, vu, vu, vu pra Cametá.\n\nEu sou muambeiro.\n\nVu, vu, vu, vu pra Cametá.\n\nI’m going to Cametá\n\nCametá\n\nI’m going to Cametá\n\nI was in the countryside with a lonely sort of job\n\nI was very hungry most of the time\n\nAnd I even went begging\n\nWhen my mother-in-law who lived\n\nin Bengola arranged\n\na good job for me that I thought was stupid\n\nIt was just sweeping\n\nI didn’t value my job\n\nWhich was just sweeping\n\nI bought cheap contraband on the border\n\nAnd came back to re-sell it\n\nIn the capital, I do business\n\nReselling\n\nBlack marketeer in the ‘hood\n\nI’m a mule along with my grandfather.\n\nI’ve been a fishmonger,\n\nCrabseller,\n\nI’m a gravedigger,\n\nI sold Avon,\n\nbut I’m broke, so I’m going back inland.\n\nI’m going to Cametá.\n\nCametá.\n\nI’m, I’m, I’m, I’m going to Cametá.\n\nCametá.I’m in the ‘hood.\n\nI’m, I’m, I’m, I’m going to Cametá.\n\nI’m a black marketeer.\n\nI’m, I’m, I’m, I’m going to Cametá.Just look, I was in the worst sort of situation\n\nLiving with my grandmother\n\nIn the middle of the swamp!\n\nI’m in the ‘hood.\n\nI’m, I’m, I’m, I’m going to Cametá.\n\nI’m a black marketeer.\n\nI’m, I’m, I’m, I’m going to Cametá.\n\nSee? Very fun. For me, behind all the silliness is a raw fact: this happened A LOT. In some ways it is the story of Brazil’s interior.\n\nWe lament here amongst our friends here that there’s no place to go in the evenings. There used to be–bars, restaurants, even a disco in this small town, a movie theater in the next town over. They all closed. Why? A large part of it is because a decade ago an entire generation left. My husband and his peers all left in their early 20’s for the big cities: São Paolo, Belo Horizonte, Rio, and for the exterior: the United States, Spain, Italy. What was left was a gutted city. With no young customers to fuel the commerce the center of town withered, and it’s still trying to bounce back. What’s the nickname for the nearby town of Governor Valadares? Vala-dolares (translation: its’ worth in dollars), just because so many youth were overseas and sending dollars back home.\n\nThe holiday traffic between our region and São Paolo is amazing. The road that we travel from our farm into town usually has light traffic–some trucks, a few cars. Two days before Christmas I sat and waited for a line of thirty-eight cars–thirty-eight, not even counting the trucks–filed by before I got an opening to pull out of our driveway into transit. All of them had out-of-state plates.\n\nWe see it in the markets too. During the holidays prices on locally-made comfort foods–requeijão, pão de quijo, bisquoitos, doce de leite, etc.–skyrocket around the holidays because all the Paulistas stockpile presents to bring back to the city. Four of my bottles of jabuticaba liquor have already been packed into tourists’ luggage and are making their grand debut in the Big City.\n\nThis lost generation is returning as Brazil’s economy betters. They’re trickling back in ones and twos. But some found lives elsewhere in the intervening decade, started families, found good jobs and urban lifestyles they can’t or don’t want to leave. Those like us who have returned are now in a different place. Now in our mid-to-late 30’s, we’re not going to be the ones to stay out all night at the clubs (although maybe we’ll be the generation to re-invest and re-open them). The job of creating the new energy for the city falls to our nieces and nephews. I watch them giggle about going out to meet friends for ice-cream and daydream about what this town might look like in another ten years."
