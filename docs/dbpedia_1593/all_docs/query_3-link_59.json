This Chicken Pie is great as a snack, or as a whole meal, with some soup or salad! And because the filling is firm you can pack as a snack or even lunch for your kids! It's great warm but it is as delicious if eaten at room temperature.\n\nJump to:\n\nüìã Ingredients\n\nüí≠ Tips to make this Brazilian Chicken Pie\n\nüç≥ How to make it\n\nüìñ Recipe\n\nüí¨ Comments\n\nüìã Ingredients\n\nFilling\n\nchicken breast\n\nbouillon chicken cube\n\ntomato paste\n\nolive oil\n\ngarlic cloves\n\nonion\n\nBrazilian requeij√£o or Catupiry cheese (you can substitute for cream cheese)\n\nDough\n\nall purpose flour\n\negg\n\nbaking margarine (you can substitute for butter)\n\nsalt\n\negg yolk\n\nüí≠ Tips to make this Brazilian Chicken Pie\n\nThis recipe calls for margarine for the dough. Here in Brazil we have one brand that sells margarine for baking and that's the one used in this recipe. If you have anything similar where you live you should use it, if not you can easily substitute for butter.\n\nOne of the ingredients for the filling is requeij√£o or catupiry cheese. You can find it here but you can use cream cheese or any other spreadable cheese that is mild in flavor. The whole point of this ingredient is to keep the filling moist, but still firm.\n\nWe usually make this Chicken pie in a rectangular or square baking dish, but you can make it in a round pan.\n\nüç≥ How to make it\n\nFilling\n\nStart by cooking the chicken breast in water with the bouillon chicken cube and 3 tbsp of tomato paste.\n\nWhen chicken is cooked, remove from water, let it cool a little and shred it.\n\nIn a large skillet heat the olive oil and add onion and garlic.\n\nCook until lightly golden brown and add chicken.\n\nMix well and add remaining tomato paste. Cook for around 2 minutes.\n\nTurn off the heat and add the requeij√£o/Catupiry cheese (or cream cheese) and mix until combined. Set aside.\n\nDough\n\nMix all ingredients (except egg yolk - used for eggwash) and knead for about a minute, until ingredients are all incorporated.\n\nIf it's too dry, you could add 1 tsp of milk.\n\nDivide dough in two, making one piece a little larger than the other (one for the crust and the other for te top)\n\nAssembling\n\nPreheat the oven to 350F (180C).\n\nIn a floured surface roll out the larger piece of dough.\n\nPlace over a 9inX9in (23cmX23cm) baking dish. Leave dough 1/2 inch (1cm) over the edges.\n\nPlace filling on top of dough and spread evenly.\n\nRoll out the other piece of dough and lay over the filling.\n\nGently press the bottom and top pieces of dough together to seal.\n\nBrush the top with beaten egg yolk.\n\nBake for around 30 to 40 minutes or until pie crust is lightly golden brown\n\nüìñ Recipe\n\nI think you might also enjoy this Brazilian Chopped Salad - it goes really well with this recipe!\n\nPrint Pin\n\n5 from 2 votes\n\nBrazilian Chicken Pie\n\nLearn how to make a Brazilian Chicken Pie, made with a delicious buttery crust and loaded with a moist (but firm) chicken filling.\n\nPrep Time 35 minutes minutes\n\nCook Time 30 minutes minutes\n\nServings 9 servings\n\nCalories 398kcal\n\nIngredients\n\nFilling\n\n1 chicken breast\n\n1 bouillon chicken cube\n\n6 tbsp tomato paste\n\n1 tbsp olive oil\n\n2 garlic cloves minced\n\n1 small onion chopped\n\n3 tbsp requeij√£o or catupiry cheese you can substitute for cream cheese\n\nDough\n\n3 cups all purpose flour\n\n1 egg\n\n7 oz margarine (you can substitute for butter) at room temperature\n\n1 tsp salt\n\n1 egg yolk for eggwash\n\nInstructions\n\nFilling\n\nCook the chicken breast in water with the bouillon chicken cube and 3 tbsp of tomato paste.\n\nWhen chicken is cooked, remove from water, let it cool a little and shred it.\n\nIn a large skillet heat the olive oil and add onion and garlic.\n\nCook until lightly golden brown and add chicken.
