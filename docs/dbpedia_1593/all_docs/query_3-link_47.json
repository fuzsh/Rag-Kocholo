        "text": "Cream cheese is typically made from cream but can also be made with a combination of cream and milk (1).\n\nFirst, the cream is heat-treated by pasteurization to kill any potentially dangerous microorganisms. Then, lactic acid bacteria are introduced, making the cheese mildly acidic (2).\n\nFrom there, fat droplets from the cream are broken into smaller and more uniform drops, creating a smooth product (1, 3).\n\nAdditives like carob bean gum and carrageenan thicken the cheese. Finally, a clotting enzyme — derived from either a plant or animal source — is included to improve the firmness (3, 4, 5).\n\nIn the United States, cream cheese must contain at least 33% fat and have less than 55% moisture by weight. However, in some countries, higher fat content may be required (3, 5).\n\nSummary\n\nCream cheese is made from cream or a combination of cream and milk. It becomes slightly acidic from the addition of lactic acid bacteria.\n\nAside from being a tasty spread, cream cheese has some health benefits.\n\nGood source of vitamin A\n\nCream cheese contains a significant amount of vitamin A.\n\nJust 1 ounce (28 grams) contains 87 mg of vitamin A, which is 10% of the DV (6). This vitamin is fat-soluble and particularly important for your vision (7).\n\nIt also supports your immune system and helps protect the integrity of many tissues, such as your skin, lungs, and intestines (8).\n\nSupplies antioxidants\n\nCream cheese is a source of several antioxidants that defend your body against unstable molecules called free radicals. When levels of free radicals get too high in your body, it can lead to cellular damage.\n\nCream cheese contains small amounts of carotenoid antioxidants, including lutein and zeaxanthin, which are especially important for eye health (6, 9, 10, 11).\n\nMay have probiotic effects\n\nCream cheese is made using a starter culture from lactic acid bacteria.\n\nSome of these strains of bacteria are probiotics, which are friendly bacteria that offer health benefits (12).\n\nFor example, some Lactobacillus species support your immune system by reducing inflammatory response, while other species stimulate your immune system when exposed to infection (12, 13, 14).\n\nIn an 8-week study, mice that ate Lactococcus chungangensis cream cheese showed increased levels of beneficial short-chain fatty acids and an improved bacteria profile in their stools (15).\n\nShort-chain fatty acids are the main energy source for colon cells. They also reduce inflammation in your body, which may benefit people with certain inflammatory disorders (16, 17).\n\nThese results are promising, but human studies are needed.\n\nSince heating kills probiotics, look for cream cheese with a “live and active cultures” label, which means that the product boasts living probiotics.\n\nLow in lactose\n\nLactose is a type of sugar found in dairy products like milk, cheese, and yogurt.\n\nYet, some people are unable to digest this sugar. This condition is called lactose intolerance, which can cause symptoms like bloating, gas, and diarrhea (18).\n\nPeople with this condition should limit or avoid dairy products.\n\nHowever, research shows that most people with lactose intolerance can tolerate small amounts of up to 12 grams of lactose per meal (18).\n\nAs cream cheese contains less than 2 grams of lactose per ounce (28 grams), people with lactose intolerance may not have trouble with it (6).\n\nSummary\n\nCream cheese is a great source of vitamin A, low in lactose, and a good source of antioxidants. It may also have probiotic effects."
