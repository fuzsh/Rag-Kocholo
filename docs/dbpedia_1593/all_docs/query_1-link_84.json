        "text": "When is a plum not a plum? When it is a sugarplum or a plum pudding! Judging by the names of these traditional British Christmas treats, one would think that both include some quantity of plum. Not true! For centuries, the term ‘sugarplum’ has referred to any type of dried fruit, made into a small, vaguely plum-shaped sweet. During Victorian times, these sugary candies sometimes contained raisins or currants which were called plums.\n\nSimilarly, traditional plum puddings, including the famous Mrs. Beeton’s Christmas Plum Pudding, Excellent Plum Pudding, and Unrivalled Plum Pudding (Beeton’s Book of Household Management, London, 1861) contain not a trace of plum. Instead, these noble desserts are packed with plump raisins (in the case of the Unrivalled Plum Pudding, specifically muscatel and sultana raisins). Mrs. Beeton does, however, make mention in her book of boxed candied plums, stating that they are best served in a pretty glass dish in the wintertime when fresh fruit is not available.\n\nWhich brings us to our recently-arrived, candied plums from Elvas Portugal. Elvas plums, also known as Greengage plums, have been grown and candied for preservation for centuries in the Upper Alentejo region of Portugal. Greenish in color, these plums are prized in many countries for their rich, sweet flavor. Indeed, they have been popular in England since their introduction by Port merchants in the 1800s. In the Alentejo, they are a DOP or origin-protected fruit, officially titled Ameixas d’Elvas – a ‘sugarplum’ in the truest sense of the name.\n\nOn our trip to southern Portugal in February, Tim and I visited Confibor, a small Ameixas d’Elvas producer in Estremoz. The harvest had long since passed (the plums are harvested between June and August) and all of the beautiful, green plums were soaking in vats of sugar cane syrup. As with all candied fruits, sugar was initially used as a natural preservative, allowing ripe summer fruits to be enjoyed year round in the days before trains and trucks. The process of blanching and candying the fruit takes several weeks, after which they are stored in their sweet syrup until they are needed. Before they’re shipped to us by boat, they are simply drained, dried and packed in wooden boxes.\n\nWhile these plums could be eaten on their own for dessert, we began importing them primarily for their presence on a cheese board. They act in the same way as a fruity jam, a sweet honey, or a tangy membrillo when paired with cheese. I prefer my plums paired with firm, salty cheeses, like Calcagno and Manchego, or with rich, farmy cheeses like Laguiole and Avonlea Cheddar. Try a few slivers of candied plum atop a fluffy pile of Hillman Farm’s fresh goat cheese or MitiCrema fresh sheep’s milk cheese. Consider also a single plum alongside a slice of Stilton and a glass of Ruby Port.\n\nAt our South End store, we’re presenting our plums in a glass jar on the cheese counter, so you can buy them by the piece. In Cambridge, they are available in the chocolate case in the bakery. Just one or two will be the perfect amount to perk up a cheese platter for a small group. If you’re tempted to pop one of these plums in your mouth to experience their sweetly rich flavors – just be warned… they contain pits!\n\nJulie Cappellano is the General Manager and wine buyer at Formaggio Kitchen South End, Boston.\n\nAs a lover of all things Portuguese for many years, I have been working to build the selection of Portuguese cheeses here at our Cambridge location. In the past, we’ve had a few varieties at a time, but this is the first time we’ve had as large a selection as this, and I’m very excited about them all. Here’s the lowdown on the line-up!\n\nA few preliminaries: Portuguese cheeses are often wildcards – you never know from looking at a cheese what sort of flavor you’ll get. Almost all the cheeses we carry from Portugal are basically farmstead cheeses, produced by hand at the local level and intended for Portuguese consumption. They seldom make their way across the pond. Cheesemaking traditions in Portugal have been resistant to modernization; instead, to meet the growing demand, Portuguese cheesemakers have made traditional methods more efficient and produce non-DOP versions of most of their DOP cheeses. The result is that, although the cheeses are sometimes a bit expensive, you really can taste the tradition of small-scale, regional production in a way that is difficult with US-destined cheeses from many other European countries. So read up, taste up, and enjoy!\n\nSheep milk cheeses:\n\nThe all-stars of the Portuguese cheese scene, sheep are one of the hardiest ruminants and are well adapted to handle the country’s challenging terrain. They produce milk with more protein and fat than cows and goats – this is likely responsible in part for that glorious “sheepiness” taste we all know and love. Yum!\n\nSerra da Estrela – Produced by Casa Matias, one of the best producers in the region of Serra da Estrela (north-central Portugal), this raw sheep milk cheese is curdled with cardoon thistle, which breaks down proteins and fats differently than traditional animal rennet, giving the lactic acid bacteria (not added, but allowed to grow from ambient strains) different food to chew on, and therefore different flavors in the finished cheese. Lactic fermentation takes place later, which is why you’ll find distinct flavors of sour milk in a cheese that should be too aged to show them. Texturally, the breakdown isn’t as complete as, say, Brie or some washed-rind cheeses; instead, the texture is springy and lively, the flavors like straw, butter, sunshine, and sheep. It’s kind of amazing. Hand-tied with a cloth wrap to help it keep its shape, it’s spongy and can be eaten as the centerpiece of a family dinner à la Winnimere, Harbison, and the like.\n\nCastelo Branco DOP – From Beira Baixa, south of Serra da Estrela and not far from the Extremadura region of Spain, this raw sheep’s milk cheese is also curdled with thistle. The curd is pressed though, giving a denser texture with a creaminess that expands as the cheese dissolves in your mouth. Mild and nutty, its rind is edible and contributes to the overall flavor nicely.\n\nAzeitão – A tiny giant, I could eat one of these for dinner every night. Made with raw sheep milk and thistle rennet, textures vary from spongy and broken-down to still curdy in the center, nearly always with a pleasantly yeasty dusting on the rind. Produced on the peninsula of Setúbal, whose northern shore holds the southern reaches of the capital of Lisbon, this cheese comes in DOP and non-DOP versions. Right now, we have the non-DOP. In addition to being cheaper, it is sometimes (as in the case of this batch) better, I think. The wrapper reads “amanteigado,” but don’t be fooled: all this means in Portuguese cheese terminology is something like “buttery soft,” and shouldn’t be confused with the very different cheese that’s actually called “Amanteigado.”\n\nSerpa DOP – Yet another raw sheep milk cheese curdled with thistle, Serpa is a bit of a wildcard among wildcards. Hailing from Portugal’s arid southern Alentejo, it can be gassier than the others in its style – almost fermented, but with a balanced bitterness and sweet, ovine depth. I’ve paired it with Flemish sour beers and been blown away by the pleasant resonances of wild yeast and earthy depth. This cheese has many flavors unfamiliar to the American palate but if you’re adventurous, you’ll find it oh-so-rewarding.\n\nTerrincho Velho DOP – From the Trás-os-Montes region of northeastern Portugal, this dense and tiny wheel is made with raw sheep milk and animal rennet, its rind rubbed with sweet paprika, white wine, and extra virgin olive oil (EVOO). Its production is very traditional, and only milk from a local goat breed, Churra da Terra Quente (Hot Earth), is used. Aged for over 90 days, this cheese strikes me as reminiscent of the sheep and the region: rugged and workmanlike. Nutty and bold, an ideal pairing with Douro reds.\n\nSabores d’Avózinha – A very traditional and humble cheese from Figuera de Castelo Rodrigo in Portugal’s northeast, it has a very delicate curd structure – you can break the curds apart easily as you cut it – and an unctuous, sheepy depth. This is, I believe, its first time in the US. Some find it strong, others feel it’s pleasantly full-bodied. It is rubbed in paprika like many cheeses from the north, and pairs wonderfully with honeyed figs and zippy white wines.\n\nGoat milk cheeses:\n\nLike sheep, goats are hardy grazers and can handle the wild flora of Portugal with ease. Goat milk responds less readily to thistle as a renneting agent, but there are a few cheeses that use it nonetheless. The results are a bit more subtle than with the sheep milk cheeses, but are again a lovely demonstration of small-scale tradition.\n\nCabra Raiano – You wouldn’t know it from its richness and depth of flavor, but this goat cheese is produced with pasteurized milk and animal rennet. Exceptionally creamy and less bitter (some say) than its sheepy cousins, these small wheels are a very different expression of goat milk. Foregoing the typical alternation that we see between milky softness and chalky density often seen in small-format French and US goat cheeses, this cheese is creamy and delicate all the way through, and not “bucky” in the least. Some wheels are more like what we think of with washed-rind cheeses like Twig Washed, while others tend a bit more toward something like Castelo Branco. Really excellent, all around.\n\nCabra da Beira Baixa – A raw goat milk version of the legendary Amarelo (see below, under “mixed milk”), this is a riff on a classic that has turned out remarkably well. Hailing from Beira Baixa in central Portugal and made with traditional animal rennet, this cheese is a well-salted gustatory delight. Not one for subtlety, this cheese can be quite punchy, with a big salt profile. The payoff in pairing is an affinity for quince and full-bodied, floral wines with a bit of residual sugar.\n\nPastagens do Convento – Small wheels, nearly rindless, made with raw goat milk and thistle rennet in Trás-os-Montes, the home of Terrincho Velho. Made with milk from the local breed of Cabra Serrana (basically meaning just “mountain goat”), this cheese is an interesting (and recent – this is its first availability in the US) exception to the “sheep + thistle” rule, unusual also because of its dense paste and lack of barnyardy character. It is slightly sour and floral, pairing nicely with dried apricots and figs, and generally excellent all-around as a table cheese. It can be almost oily (recall how Cabra del Berrocal can be) and wet, and always delicious.\n\nCow milk cheeses:\n\nWith a few rare exceptions, cow milk is used on the islands that make up the archipelago of the Açores, culturally and linguistically both contiguous with and disjointed from mainland Portugal. It’s a funny thing: on the mainland, you get tiny cheeses made with sheep and goat milk; on the rocky, steep terrain of the islands, you get wheels – sometimes huge – made with cow milk, often in a Dutch style. Craziness.\n\nCasa de Mendevil Velho – From the Minho in northwestern Portugal, this small-format, aged cow milk cheese is a real anomaly. Made with pasteurized milk and traditional rennet, it is aged for a little under a year, washed with sweet red pepper and EVOO, and shows a surprisingly strong flavor and firm texture. Like the harder cow milk cheeses from the Açores, this cheese has a pronounced spice on the finish, a real “zing!” Buttery while dense, salty while bright, strong but not sharp, it’s a strange beast. But I think it’s delicious, and it gets people’s attention like few other cheeses I know.\n\nCastelinhos – From Terceira Island in the Açores (no, not the A-zores), an island group far off the coast of Portugal, this pasteurized cow milk cheese is creamy and consistently soft from rind to rind. It won’t stand up and blow you away, but its pleasant character of sour milk, light acid, and hints of saffron make it a surprisingly fun cheese if, as many do, you make the mistake of assuming that such a humble cheese can’t be delicious. Açorean cheeses are very different from mainland Portuguese cheeses – recall Ilha Graciosa, Açoreano, and São Jorge – in that they generally use cow milk, and are modeled off of Dutch rather than traditional Iberian cheeses. Trade in the Age of Discovery was the impetus, and they have continued to develop this tradition on their own.\n\nMixed milk cheeses:\n\nThe only thing that’s better than one milk is two or three milks! But seriously, mixed milk cheeses are often born of necessity rather than deliberate artistry, and so give us a window into artisan cheesemaking at its most expedient and traditional. We’re seeing the same thing happen in real-time with some domestic cheeses, where the cheesemakers are mixing milks to make up for low yields, and discovering delicious new styles by accident.\n\nAmarelo da Beira Baixa DOP – Sheep and goat, made with animal rennet by the same producer as Cabra da Beira Baixa. An absolute classic, with a salty, washed-rind character and a bold, smooth presence. Can be quite strong, but with real nutty quality to the rind and an earthy funk not unlike Ardrahan and Gubbeen. The goat milk gives a sort of uplifting effect to the earthy and unctuous sheep milk.\n\nBica – From the Minho (cf. Casa de Mendevil), this cheese is made with a blend of pasteurized goat (70%), cow (20%), and sheep (10%) milk, with traditional rennet. Texture is soft and springy, consistent and not funky in the least. Slightly sour and goaty, it is smooth and satisfying. I don’t want to say it’s an easy cheese, but it definitely isn’t challenging – and I could eat it all day. Washed with sweet red pepper and white wine.\n\nI hope you have a chance to stop into the shop and try some of these cheeses. Of course, if you have any questions about these cheeses or the pretty phenomenal Portuguese preserves, figs, and sweets we have around the shop, just let me know.\n\nMatthew Swoveland wears several hats at Formaggio Kitchen Cambridge – among them are: cheesemonger, instructor, coffee buyer and cheese buyer.\n\nLike everything born of Sintra, the Arenae Colares Malvasia is of and from the sea.\n\nI had the good fortune to spend several weeks last summer exploring Lisbon and its surrounding environs, including an unforgettable day in Sintra, guided by two friends of mine who grew up there.\n\nSintra, the westernmost point in Europe, is a community of fairytale castles and tiny villages perched on mountains cascading into the ocean. These mountains are loosely connected by lengths of sand stolen from the sea – beaches with signs urging swimmers and surfers to be wary, lest she unexpectedly comes to take her sands back from under their feet. Most of these beaches – or at least the best of them – are “praias escondidas,” “hidden beaches,” with entrances by way of mountain passages known only to locals. Speaking over waves breaking with the voices of sirens, my friends explained that the cautionary signs remind those who have lived here in mutual respect with the ocean for generations to still take care, for she can be a fairweather and fickle friend.\n\nColares is the smallest D.O.C. (Denominação de Origem Controlada) in Portugal, just footsteps from the Atlantic, with vineyards protected from the harsh ocean winds by sandy dunes. Most famously, its sandy soils proved inhospitable to the phylloxera louse, meaning that some of the oldest vine stock in Europe still calls Colares home. The characteristics of the soil that held off the phylloxera, however, are not much more welcoming to the vines themselves. From what I could learn through a bit of research, farmers have for centuries tapped into a nutrient-rich layer of clay soil, well below the initial layers of sand. There they plant the vines, coaxing them to grow and thrive, propping them up enough to keep the grapes from burning on the hot ground, but still low enough to protect them from the wind. Nestled behind stone walls and fences, they allow the sand to fill back in over years, once the roots have taken hold.\n\nYou can immediately taste the sun drenched, weather beaten, hard-won fruits of these labors in the depth and dry complexity of Arenae’s Malvasia. It opens with sherry and salinity on the nose. At first touch on the tongue, it carries the salt of the breeze off the ocean along with a warm, rounded tartness – like biting into an apple on the beach so that its juices mix with the flavors of sand and seaweed in the air. A slight oxidation seems to draw out olive oil green and bitter orange notes and pulls all of the flavors together. At first the finish is reminiscent of a fino sherry, then it gently fades into the taste of ocean sprays in the cooling air at sunset with sand between your toes.\n\nThe red wines of the Colares region have been compared to French Bordeaux wines; this Malvasia rivals the intricacy of a high-end Jura Chardonnay – without much “funkiness” (though perhaps with a little bacalhau somewhere on the finish). While Arenae’s Malvasia could easily be drunk on its own, Portuguese wines are created to be enjoyed with simple, fresh, and subtly spiced food. This wine would pair beautifully with fresh-caught seafood, steamed green vegetables drizzled with a little olive oil, salads made with ripe tomatoes, and summer fruits.\n\nAfter hundreds of years of snatching life from the sand and the sea in order to produce limited quantities of this and other stunning Colares wines, the hectares of vineyards have begun to shrink annually. Today traditional farming families are succumbing to the pressures of developers and the expansion of resorts into this beautiful region. Knowing this, and knowing the small quantity of this already rare wine that has ever made it out of Portugal at all, I find myself becoming a little covetous… We currently have, between our South End and Cambridge shops, 8 bottles of the 2008 Arenae’s Colares Malvasia. Give us a call or send an email to julie@formaggiosouthend.com if you’d like us to set one aside for you!\n\n——————————————-\n\nSources:\n\nDavid Lincoln Ross’ “The World’s Most Endangered Wine Region: Portugal’s Colares Appellation“\n\nArnold Waldstein’s “Arenae Colares Malvasia…As rare, as interesting, as satisfying as wine can be“\n\n“Feet Buried in the Sand” from Keith Levenberg’s Cellar-Book\n\n——————————————-\n\nMarianne Staniunas is a cheesemonger at Formaggio Kitchen South End, Boston.\n\nThe holiday season is upon us, and once again this year we’ve asked our wine buyers at both shops to recommend the wines they’re most excited about gifting this year. These are not every day wines, but rather special bottles that you will want to gift or sip with loved ones. If any of these wines strike your fancy let us know so we can set a bottle (or more) aside for you, as some of them are rare and available in very limited quantities.\n\nLa Cigarrera Amontillado VOR\n\nJulie Cappellano, Wine Buyer at Formaggio Kitchen South End\n\nIgnacio Hildago, is the ninth generation of his family to make sherry in Sanlúcar de Barrameda. This extremely rare Amontillado comes from the family’s Sacrista, where their oldest wines are kept. Here Ignacio, upon receiving permission from his family, recently tapped a single barrel of Amontillado Viejo that was a part of his grandmother’s dowry. The average age of the wine from this solera is 100 years. We were lucky to receive ½ of a case out of the 50 cases of 375mL bottles that made their way to the United States. This ancient, bronze elixir, rich with hazelnut aromas and flavors, should be served at cool room temperature. This wine can be served with a simple goat’s milk cheese like Garrotxa or Garcia de Paredes, but when I open my bottle I’ll be sipping it on its own to inhale and taste every flavor nuance to the fullest.\n\nThis wine is available at Formaggio Kitchen South End, or available for pick-up at Formaggio Kitchen Cambridge with one day’s notice.\n\n2012 Domaine Comte Abbatucci “Cuvee Faustine” Rouge\n\nJames Hull, Wine Buyer at Formaggio Kitchen Cambridge\n\nIf undeniable character, quality and a little romance are what your wine-lover craves, this standout from Jean-Charles Abbatucci brims with everything the island of Corsica can throw at it. History buffs know Jean-Charles Abbatucci as a heroic general and brother-in-arms to Napoleon, but the current Jean-Charles has become a modern-day hero by expressing Corsica’s unique grapes and terroir with passion and skill. He grows his grapes with a religious commitment to biodynamics and a good dose of eccentricity (he drives his tractor around the vines blaring traditional songs of the island because he believes they’re part of the terroir and keep the vines happy!). The aromas jumping from the glass will make you a believer—layers of wild herbs, juicy cherries and rocky mineral notes swirl around your senses and ignite the imagination. Savor it with Corsican cheese like Corsu Vecchiu, a hunk of salami and the album “Corsica” by Petru Guelfucci.\n\nThis wine is available at Formaggio Kitchen Cambridge, or available for pick-up at Formaggio Kitchen South End with one day’s notice.\n\n2005 CUNE “Contino” Rioja Reserva\n\nStephen Meuse, Wine Buyer at Formaggio Kitchen Cambridge\n\nNot many wine estates can boast a winery designed by Gustaf Eiffel (of tower fame) and CUNE (kew-nay) is truly an exceptional property in many ways. Located in Haro, at the very heart of La Rioja, Spain, this winery has long enjoyed a reputation for taking a forward-thinking approach while maintaining traditional values—and this elegant wine is a case in point. In a region known for the artful blending of wines from many vineyards, CUNE breeds Contino from the grapes of a single privileged site, established in 1974. Mainly Tempranillo, it benefits from small amounts of Graciano, Mazuelo, and Garnacha Tinta. It is fermented in stainless steel then matured for two years in French and American oak. It sees extended bottle aging before release. Contino shows all the stately charm of mature Rioja, with an abundance of dark red fruits and notes of spruce forest. Tannins are beautifully conditioned and the wine is table-ready. A truly splendid holiday gift for the wine aficionado on your list.\n\nThis wine is available at Formaggio Kitchen Cambridge, or available for pick-up at Formaggio Kitchen South End with one day’s notice.\n\n1979 Kopke Colheita Port\n\nMarianne Staniunas, Formaggio Kitchen South End Wine Department\n\nA Colheita Port is an aged Tawny Port, made from the grapes of a single vintage, aged in wooden casks and released by the winemaker only when it is at its peak—and ready to be relished. Traditionally, a Colheita must be aged for at least seven years, but many winemakers age them for much longer. This year, we were thrilled to receive a limited quantity of a 1979 Colheita from Portugal’s first and oldest Port House—established in Oporto in 1638 by the Kopke family. For any lover of Port, this wine is a must-have once-in-a-lifetime gift.\n\nThis wine is available at Formaggio Kitchen South End, or available for pick-up at Formaggio Kitchen Cambridge with one day’s notice.\n\nTim and Julie recently traveled to Portugal where they visited the capital city Lisbon and toured around the Alentejo, the least populous part of the country, with Portuguese specialty food exporter Manuel Maia.\n\nSummers in the Alentejo are hot and dry, but during our springtime visit the grass and trees were green and the weather alternated almost hourly between rainstorms and blinding sun in blue skies. Long stretches of land were periodically interrupted by small towns made up of houses painted a crisp white with a yellow or green border: the traditional colors of the region.\n\nWe stopped in a few of these towns to visit several artisans, including a producer of Azeitão cheese and a producer of an Amanteigado cheese.\n\nFernando de Oliveira Simões has been making Azeitão since 1992 along with butter and ricotta (requeijão). We watched as a small group of me n worked with their hands and a few simple tools to transform the raw sheep milk, salt and macerated cardoon flower into the pudgy little cheeses we have come to love so much. Our tasting included some unusual jams, including a bright orange pumpkin jam spread on freshly made ricotta — one of the flavor highlights of the trip.\n\nAt Monte da Vinha, owner and former lawyer Joana Fernandes oversees a group of women who work with the raw milk of roughly 500 sheep. They produce various sizes and ages of the same basic cheese, which at its best, has a smooth, pudding texture that is easily scooped out and spread on a piece of bread. The flavors are stronger than the Azeitão and during our tasting with Joana, we had to restrain ourselves from eating too much of the gooey deliciousness or run the risk of appearing gluttonous.\n\nThroughout our stay in Portugal, we enjoyed each meal in its own way, from our first, seafood-centric meal of clams, octopus and bacalhau to the more meat-centric meals with goat stew and smoked meats. On our trip through the Alentejo region, we had our favorite meal in Estremoz, an old walled village with a large castle at the top of the hill.\n\nWe had lunch at São Rosas, a small restaurant with a simple, rustic menu where we tasted farinheira, a rustic sausage of fat from the pata negra or black pig, flour, pork, sweet red pepper and salt. The sausage was originally made in the 15th century with meats other than pork so that the Jewish people of the region could eat sausage to avoid persecution by the inquisition.\n\nLunch continued with açorda de bacalhau, cod fish stew and another typical Alentejo brothy soup with chunks of bread and egg, chopped garlic and fresh cilantro, pézinhos de coentrada (pigs feet in a coriander sauce), various chouriços and cuttlefish in their own ink.\n\nAfter lunch, we drove deeper into the South Alentejo region, where we passed groves of cork oak trees, olive trees, pine trees and in some places, grapevines. Sheep and fluffy, horned cows grazed under the trees while beautiful black bulls ranged on their own, waiting selection for the local bullfights (Spanish bullfights end with the death of the bull but the Portuguese never kill them). At one point, I asked Manuel, “Why all the pine trees?” “Pine nuts,” he answered. We soon discovered that we were in the heart of the production zone for this prized Mediterranean seed.\n\nThe Mediterranean pine nut (pinhõa in Portuguese) is the seed of the stone pine tree that grows in the south-central region of Portugal. The species is well adapted to the heat of the climate and is an important part of the ecosystem as a home for many birds, mammals, insects and amphibians. Because the wood of the stone pine tree is not particularly valuable, pine nuts represent the greatest (and most sustainable) economic opportunity.\n\nFrom mid-December to late March, the pinecones are collected and placed on open-air terraces where they are exposed to the heat of the summer sun. As they dry, the pine cones open up and are struck together to release the pine kernels. The nuts are then shelled, washed and sorted to ensure the highest quality. The spent pine cones and the kernel shells are sold to be reused as fuel in boilers for the biomass industry.\n\nThe Portuguese pine nuts were amazing — soft, full of oil and very piney. We tried them plain, in honey and in a sort of brittle. We learned that one of the biggest purchasers of Portuguese pine nuts is Italy, perhaps one of the reasons Italian pesto is so good.\n\nImportant Portuguese words:\n\nQueijo – cheese\n\nRequeijo – ricotta\n\nAlho – garlic\n\nAtum – tuna\n\nAzeite – olive oil\n\nAzeitones – olives\n\nChá – tea\n\nDoce – sweet\n\nLaranja – orange\n\nLimão – lemon\n\nLulas -squid\n\nMaçã – apple\n\nPao – bread\n\nPeixe – fish\n\nVinho – wine\n\nVelho – old\n\nThe post Queijo, chouriço and pinhões: Adventures in Portugal appeared first on Formaggio Kitchen.\n\nTim and Julie recently traveled to Portugal where they visited the capital city Lisbon and toured around the Alentejo, the least populous part of the country, with Portuguese specialty food exporter Manuel Maia.\n\nSummers in the Alentejo are hot and dry, but during our springtime visit the grass and trees were green and the weather alternated almost hourly between rainstorms and blinding sun in blue skies.
