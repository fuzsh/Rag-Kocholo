        "text": "Queijo do Pico is a soft cheese made from the finest unpasteurized cow's milk, sourced from cows that graze on the nutrient-rich pastures of Pico. The volcanic soil and lush grasses lend a distinct flavor and quality to the milk, which in turn imparts a unique character to the cheese. With its natural rind and a pale yellow hue, Queijo do Pico entices the senses with a strong, salty flavor and a delightful aroma that lingers in the air.\n\nIn the early days, Queijo do Pico was primarily crafted as a means of preserving the islanders' precious milk. The art of cheese-making became a cherished tradition passed down through generations, with each family adding their own touch of expertise to the process. What started as a practical solution soon blossomed into an integral part of the island's cultural fabric, shaping its history and forging connections with neighboring islands and mainland Portugal.\n\nThe legacy of Queijo do Pico has been safeguarded by its recognition as a Denomination of Protected Origin (DOP) by the European Union since 1996. This esteemed designation highlights the adherence to a traditional production method that has been faithfully followed for centuries. To create this delectable cheese, the milk is carefully curdled using animal rennet at a precise temperature of 26 to 27 degrees Celsius. The curds are then gently cut into small pieces, delicately salted, and placed into cylindrical molds. Underneath the watchful eyes of skilled artisans, the molds are pressed to expel the whey and turned over several times during the initial day. The cheeses are then removed from the molds and allowed to dry for two to three days in a cool and humid environment. Finally, they are aged on wooden shelves for a period of 20 to 30 days, a transformative process that lends Queijo do Pico its signature texture and crust.\n\nLisbon.vip Recommends\n\nQueijo do Pico assumes a charming round shape, slightly convex on the sides, boasting a diameter of 16 to 17 centimeters and a height of 2 to 3 centimeters.
