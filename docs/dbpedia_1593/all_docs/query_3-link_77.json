        "text": "This Brazilian mac and cheese with chicken, also known as macarronada, is a baked pasta with a white cheese creamy sauce and chicken. It takes about 25 minutes to bake and is super creamy and delicious. Simply one of my familyâ€™s favorite easy dinners on a budget!\n\nBrazilian Mac and Cheese (Macarronada)\n\nMacarronada com RequeijÃ£o (or Brazilian Mac and Cheese) is one of those easy Brazilian recipes that you have to try!\n\nIt used to be one of my favorite pasta dishes, because it is quick, complete, and a real crowd-pleaser. This pasta dish even reminds me a bit of the very popular American Macaroni and Cheese that I so love.\n\nIt is indeed an excellent option either for a single person working long hours (me in Brazil) or for a full-time mother having to drive kids everywhere (me now).\n\nIf I told you that today was the first time that my husband tasted this macarronada and fell in love with this dish, would you believe it? He was so thrilled that I will have to make it again and again.\n\nActually, I don't even know why I took so long to make it here for the first time. Maybe it is because one of its key ingredients is not available everywhere in the United States. But it is not hard to find either.\n\nI think I was just being lazy. Well, the cream cheese spread in a jar (requeijÃ£o as we say in Brazil, or queso fundido as the Spanish-speakers here say) can be found refrigerated in Latin or Middle-Eastern supermarkets under different brands.\n\nThis one is from Egypt!\n\nIt has a very creamy texture and can be simply spread on toast, Brazilian cheese bread, or incorporated into a variety of dishes.\n\nGive both the cheese spread and the penne pasta macarronada a try, and you will not regret it... Actually, my only fear is that you may become rather addicted -- to both. ðŸ™‚\n\nHow to Make Mac and Cheese with Chicken\n\nPreheat the oven to 350Âº F (180Âº C).\n\nCook the pasta al dente according to the directions on the package. It takes about 10 minutes! Reserve Â½ cup of the pasta water and then drain the pasta. Set aside! SEE PIC. 1\n\nHeat the same pan that you cooked the pasta over medium heat and then sautÃ© the garlic in olive oil, about 1 minute. SEE PIC 2 Mix in the wine, the tomato sauce, the salt, pepper, basil, and the reserved pasta water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover, and let simmer for about 5 minutes. SEE PIC. 3 Stir in the heavy cream, Brazilian cream cheese spread or American cream cheese, and 8 oz of mozzarella cheese until these 2 cheeses melt. Then, mix in the chicken. SEE PIC. 4 NOTE: If using the American cream cheese, make sure it is at room temperature and also use a whisk to mix the cream cheese with the other ingredients until the mixture is smooth (not lumpy).\n\nPlace the cooked and drained pasta into the pan and toss to coat with the sauce. SEE PIC. 5 Transfer to either a large cast-iron skillet or to a medium-sized deep baking dish (about 9-Â½ by 7-â…• inches in diameter and 3 inches deep).\n\nSprinkle the â…“ cup of mozzarella and also the Parmesan cheese on top. SEE PIC. 6 Grease one side of a sheet of aluminum foil with non-stick cooking spray (to prevent the cheeses from sticking to the foil) and then cover the top of the baking dish with the foil, greased side down.\n\nBake in the middle rack for 20 minutes. Remove the foil and let cook uncovered for 5 minutes more. Serve immediately with a fresh salad, air fryer asparagus, or air fryer Brussels sprouts.\n\nCan I make this chicken mac and cheese ahead?\n\nYes, you can! But be aware the creamy cheese sauce wonâ€™t be as creamy as when the baked mac and cheese was served fresh (right after coming out of the oven). The creamy sauce will thicken and the pasta will absorb the sauce.\n\nA solution would be to warm up a little bit of heavy cream and then gradually mix with the re-heated pasta. The amount of heavy cream will depend on the amount of pasta that you reheat. You can also add more mozzarella cheese when reheating the pasta.\n\nCan I reheat this baked mac and cheese?\n\nYes! As I said earlier, you can reheat the pasta and then gradually mix in a little bit of heavy cream until the sauce becomes creamy again. Of course, the amount of heavy cream will depend on the amount of pasta that you reheat.\n\nCan I use other cheeses?\n\nYes, you can! Brazilians tend to use mozzarella and Parmesan more often than other cheeses. They are as popular there as cheddar is in the United States! However, gruyere, Monterey jack, or any other melting cheese goes well in this baked mac and cheese recipe.\n\nCan I use American cream cheese instead of requeijÃ£o?\n\nYes! But there is one catch here: The Brazilian cream cheese (requeijÃ£o) is much softer than the American cream cheese, making it easier and quicker to incorporate into the pasta sauce.\n\nIn order to replace requeijÃ£o with regular cream cheese, make sure:\n\nYour cream cheese is at room temperature or softened.\n\nTo use a whisk (instead of a wooden spoon) to incorporate the cream cheese into the sauce; otherwise, your cheese sauce will be lumpy instead of smooth.\n\nTo be patient! It takes a few minutes more for the cream cheese to dissolve and become smooth.\n\nWhat type of chicken can I use to make this mac and cheese with chicken?\n\nI used rotisserie chicken â€“ which saved me some time. You can either shred or cut the rotisserie chicken into cubes or chunks.\n\nBut if you prefer to use raw chicken instead, prefer skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut into cubes. Of course, you will have to brown the chicken in olive oil, over medium-high heat, before mixing it in the pasta sauce. It will finish cooking when you bake the pasta in the oven.\n\nStorage\n\nStore mac and cheese with chicken in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3-4 days.\n\nYou can freeze it for up to one month. But be aware the sauce will thicken and may become lumpy after reheating. Make sure to thaw the pasta in the fridge and then reheat.\n\nTo reheat, add some warm heavy cream after reheating the pasta (as much as needed to loosen the sauce). Mix it well in order to it smooth. If you want, add more mozzarella.\n\nMore easy pasta recipes:\n\nBlack Bean Pasta\n\nEasy Pasta Bolognese\n\nShrimp Scampi Pasta\n\nGarlic Shrimp Spaghetti\n\nShrimp Carbonara\n\nSpaghetti with Meat Sauce\n\nSausage Pasta\n\nOther mac and cheese recipes:\n\nCauliflower mac and cheese\n\nMicrowave mac and cheese\n\nMac and Cheese Carbonara\n\nSausage Mac and Cheese\n\nPIN & ENJOY!\n\nFOLLOW US on INSTAGRAM, PINTEREST, and FACEBOOK for more easy and delish recipes and updates.\n\nBrazilian Mac and Cheese with Chicken (Macarronada com RequeijÃ£o)\n\nThis Brazilian mac and cheese with chicken, also known as macarronada, is a baked pasta with a white cheese creamy sauce and chicken.
