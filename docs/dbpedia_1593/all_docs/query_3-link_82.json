        "text": "This post may contain affiliate links. Read our disclosure policy.\n\nA French toast bake is always easier than dipping and cooking individual slices of French toast. Not only is this casserole easier, it’s quite the treat! Today’s baked cream cheese French toast casserole is stuffed with sweet cream cheese and topped with a brown sugar crumble topping. It’s a wonderful recipe for a brunch or breakfast gathering because you can prep the casserole the night before.\n\nThe 1st review was from baker Kristen, who says “This. was. phenomenal. I made it for Christmas breakfast, and it was perfect! Multiple people asked me for the recipe! Thanks for sharing! ★★★★★”\n\nToday’s cream cheese French toast casserole is one of my favorite all-in-one, always crowd-pleasing, homerun breakfast recipes. You don’t need an excuse to make it—the dish tastes just as lovely on an ordinary Saturday morning as it does for Christmas brunch. If you’re not into cream cheese, simply leave it out. You could skip the crumb topping, too. Some readers even layer in 1 cup of fresh blueberries for a blueberries & cream version. You can also add mixed berries like we do in our berries & cream French toast.\n\nAs long as you stick with the bread & egg/milk layers, it’ll be a hit.\n\nThis Cream Cheese French Toast Casserole Is:\n\nTotally decadent and indulgent\n\nStuffed with sweet cream cheese\n\nTopped with a crumb cake-like streusel\n\nPerfect for anyone who loves lots of texture and flavor in each bite\n\nA delicious Christmas/holiday/special breakfast recipe\n\nEasy to prepare and feeds a crowd\n\nA convenient make-ahead brunch option\n\nThree Layers to Love\n\nThis isn’t your ordinary bland & soggy breakfast casserole. Rather, there are three glorious texture-packed layers:\n\nFrench Toast Bread: Pour a fabulously rich custard sauce made from eggs, whole milk, brown sugar, and cinnamon over thick pieces of bread. Use whole milk for the richest taste and texture. The bread soaks this up, especially if the bread is stale (see next section). The soaking time is longer than it is when making regular individual french toast, so everything gets fabulously flavorful.\n\nCream Cheese: To make this casserole extra special, add cream cheese. Combine cream cheese with confectioners’ sugar and vanilla extract to make a sweet filling. Make sure you use brick-style cream cheese—the kind sold in individually wrapped bricks. We’ll layer spoonfuls of the cream cheese mixture with the bread to create cream cheese stuffed french toast. It doesn’t get much better for breakfast!\n\nCrumb Topping: Immediately prior to baking, sprinkle the casserole with a brown sugar cinnamon crumb topping made from brown sugar, flour, cinnamon, and cold butter. While optional, I don’t recommend leaving it out because it adds a crisp-crumbly texture.\n\nSuccess Tips for French Toast Casserole\n\nThese success tips also apply to pumpkin French toast casserole and apple cider French toast, both delicious seasonal twists on today’s recipe.\n\nQuality Bread. Bread is the main ingredient in any baked french toast casserole, so don’t skimp here. Flimsy sliced bread won’t do you any favors and the casserole usually ends up tasting flat and soggy. Rather, go for a fancy beauty like challah or croissant bread. French toast made with challah or croissant bread tastes 4873% better than french toast made with any other bread. (I did the math.)\n\nStale Bread. When you have the quality bread you need, let it sit out for a few hours to get a little stale. Like sausage & herb stuffing and bagel breakfast casserole, french toast casserole is best when the bread is somewhat stale.\n\nOvernight is Best. Assemble the bread/cream cheese/custard layers and then before baking it, let it sit overnight in the refrigerator. This time gives the crusty bread a chance to soak up the cinnamon-spiced egg custard. You can leave the prepared french toast casserole in the refrigerator anywhere from 3-4 hours to 24 hours. I find the longer the bread soaks, the tastier the casserole. So, go to sleep. It will be amazing.\n\nIn Pictures: How to Make Baked Cream Cheese French Toast Casserole\n\nThe full printable recipe is below, but let me walk you through the process so you know what to expect when it’s your turn in the kitchen.\n\nAs pictured above, spread half of your stale bread cubes into a greased 9×13-inch baking dish or any 3- to 4-quart baking dish, like this white baking dish you see here in the photos. Make the cream cheese filling and drop random spoonfuls on the bread layer:\n\nLayer the remaining bread cubes on top of cream cheese. Make the egg custard mixture. For this you need eggs, whole milk, cinnamon, brown sugar, and vanilla extract. (Note that cinnamon floats to the top, so that’s why it looks like a lot of cinnamon!)\n\nPour this over the bread. (Using a bowl with a pour spout is especially helpful here!) At this point, you can cover and refrigerate the casserole for at least 3-4 hours or overnight. Make the crumb topping using a pastry blender or two forks, and sprinkle over the casserole before baking.\n\nRight before serving, drizzle the entire casserole with maple syrup or try a dusting of confectioners’ sugar, or spoonfuls of blueberry sauce. This is french toast done right! It’s like French toast, crumbly coffee cake, and cheesecake combined. Yes!!\n\nWhat to Serve with Baked Cream Cheese French Toast Casserole\n\nThe following suggestions can complete your brunch or breakfast meal, especially if you’re making this dish for Thanksgiving, Easter (along with these other favorite Easter brunch recipes!), mother’s day, father’s day, New Years Day, or any special morning.\n\nSomething savory such as quiche, frittata, this simple egg breakfast casserole, a hash brown breakfast skillet, a batch of breakfast egg muffins, or eggs benedict\n\nScrambled eggs or omelets\n\nFresh fruit salad or even this fresh berry quinoa salad\n\nBacon, breakfast sausage, or ham\n\nSmoked salmon\n\nHam and potato casserole which can also be prepared ahead of time\n\nA lunch/brunch dish such as strawberry bacon salad\n\nSee hundreds more breakfast recipes.\n\nPrint\n\nclock clock iconcutlery cutlery iconflag flag iconfolder folder iconinstagram instagram iconpinterest pinterest iconfacebook facebook iconprint print iconsquares squares iconheart heart iconheart solid heart solid icon\n\nBaked Cream Cheese French Toast Casserole\n\n5 Stars 4 Stars 3 Stars 2 Stars 1 Star 4.9 from 110 reviews\n\nAuthor: Sally\n\nPrep Time: 30 minutes\n\nCook Time: 50 minutes\n\nTotal Time: 9 hours, 25 minutes\n\nYield: serves 12\n\nCategory: Breakfast\n\nMethod: Baking\n\nCuisine: American\n\nDescription\n\nThis baked cream cheese french toast casserole is stuffed with sweet cream cheese and topped with a brown sugar crumble topping. It’s a wonderful recipe for a brunch or breakfast gathering because you can prep the casserole the night before.\n\nIngredients\n\n1 (12-14 ounce) loaf french bread, sourdough bread, or challah*\n\n8 ounces (226g) full-fat brick cream cheese, softened to room temperature*\n\n2 Tablespoons (15g) confectioners’ sugar (do not leave out)\n\n3 teaspoons (15ml) pure vanilla extract, divided\n\n8 large eggs\n\n2 and 1/4 cups (540ml) whole milk\n\n3/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n\n2/3 cup (133g) packed light brown sugar\n\nCrumb Topping\n\n1/3 cup (69g) packed light brown sugar\n\n1/3 cup (41g) all-purpose flour (spooned & leveled)\n\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n\n6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, cold and cubed\n\noptional: maple syrup and/or confectioners’ sugar for topping\n\nCook Mode Prevent your screen from going dark\n\nInstructions\n\nGrease a 9×13-inch baking pan or any 3-4 quart oven-safe dish (pictured) with nonstick spray. Slice then cut the bread into cubes, about 1 inch in size. Spread half of the cubes into the prepared baking pan.\n\nUsing a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, beat the room temperature cream cheese on medium-high speed until completely smooth. Beat in the confectioners’ sugar and 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract until combined. Drop random spoonfuls of cream cheese mixture on top of the bread. Layer the remaining bread cubes on top of cream cheese. (I like to make sure some cream cheese is still exposed on top just for looks.) Set aside.\n\nWhisk the eggs, milk, cinnamon, brown sugar, and remaining vanilla together until no brown sugar lumps remain. Pour evenly over the bread. Cover the pan tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 3-4 hours and up to 24 hours. Overnight is best.\n\nPreheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Remove pan from the refrigerator.\n\nPrepare the crumb topping: Whisk the brown sugar, flour, and cinnamon together in a medium bowl. Cut in the cold cubed butter with a pastry blender or two forks. Sprinkle the topping evenly over the soaked bread.\n\nBake uncovered for 45-55 minutes or until golden brown on top. I usually bake it for 45 minutes because I like it softer. Drizzle with optional maple syrup or dust with confectioners’ sugar. Serve warm.\n\nCover leftovers tightly and store in the refrigerator for 2-3 days.\n\nNotes\n\nMake Ahead & Freezing Instructions: You can prep the dish through step 3 up to 24 hours in advance. (See step 3.) You can also prepare the crumb topping 1-2 days in advance, cover tightly, and store in the refrigerator. Sprinkle over the soaked bread immediately before baking. To freeze, prepare the recipe through step 3 and freeze for up to 2 months. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator, and then continue with step 4. You can freeze the prepared casserole with the crumb topping or add it on right before baking, but keep in mind that fresh crumb topping always gives the dish a little more texture. You can also freeze the leftover baked and cooled casserole for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator, and then reheat to your liking in the microwave or cover and bake in a 300°F (149°C) until warm throughout, at least 20 minutes.\n\nSpecial Tools (affiliate links): 9×13-inch Baking Pan or any 3- to 4-quart Oven-safe Baking Dish (pictured) | Electric Mixer (Handheld or Stand) | Glass Mixing Bowls or Mixing Bowls with Pour Spout | Whisk | Pastry Blender\n\nBread: Day-old, crusty bread is perfect for french toast casseroles. Slice and cut it into 1-inch cubes and let it sit out uncovered all day. You’ll have about 12 cups of cubed bread– a little more or less is fine.\n\nCream Cheese: Since the cream cheese is only mixed with a little sugar and vanilla, make sure you are using quality cream cheese that tastes good. I use and love full fat Philadelphia brand brick-style cream cheese for this dish.\n\nHalf Recipe: This recipe can easily be halved in an 8-inch or 9-inch baking pan. The bake time will be slightly shorter, around 30-35 minutes.\n\nCan I add berries? Some readers have added blueberries, blackberries, and/or raspberries sprinkled throughout the casserole. Feel free to scatter 1 cup of fresh berries over the spoonfuls of cream cheese before topping with the remaining bread cubes. I do not recommend frozen berries."
