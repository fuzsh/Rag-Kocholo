        "text": "Metro Atlanta is home to a thriving Brazilian community, which includes several restaurants, bakeries, and home businesses offering a wide range of flavors from the South American country. Just as diverse as its population, Brazilian food encompasses everything from loaded pizzas and riffs on popular Levantine fare to the seafood stew moqueca, with variations on the dish drawing from the country’s Afro-Brazilian, Indigenous, and Portuguese roots. Here are eight Brazilian restaurants to try around Atlanta, along with some suggestions on what to order at each.\n\nDon’t see a favorite Brazilian restaurant listed?

Learn more about our editorial process.\n\nMallú Cunha dedicates her home business to all sorts of gorgeous Brazilian docinhos that are typically ordered for children’s birthday parties, holidays, weddings, and special occasions. At the top of the list is the namesake: brigadeiros, a soft chocolate truffle rolled in chocolate sprinkles. However, Cunha’s menu features all sorts of sweets to choose from, including other iconic treats like beijinhos (coconut truffles), brigadeiro gourmet crocante de caju (truffles rolled in cashews), and olho de sogra (a prune stuffed with a beijinho). Yay! Brigadieros takes orders through Instagram and WhatsApp for pick up in Kennesaw.\n\nIntroduced to Brazil by immigrants from Lebanon and Syria, esfiha is based on sfiha, a Levantine flatbread topped with minced meat, which can be served open-faced or folded into triangular pockets. Donna Esfiha, a home bakery in Marietta, specializes in esfiha aberta (open esfiha). Flavors include the classic carne as well as ricota com espinafre (spinach and ricotta), the pizza-like calabresa, and sweet varieties topped with fruit. People can order through Instagram.\n\nAs its name implies, this restaurant is best known for corn-based Brazilian food. While diners can still find other staples like coxinha and pastel, açai smoothies, and maracujá, get the specialty at the Corn House: pamonha. This dish is made with freshly grated sweet corn and is wrapped in a corn husk. It’s particularly popular during the Brazilian festival, Festa Junina, which celebrates Brazil’s corn harvest. While traditionally eaten sweet, there’s also a savory version called pamonha salgada at the Corn House. End a meal here with an equally popular dessert, the curau or corn pudding.\n\nThis pillar of the Brazilian food community in Marietta showcases a variety of Brazilian flavors. The cafe serves a traditional buffet with food like bolho de mildo (corn cake) and esfihas in the morning and moqueca (Brazilian seafood stew) in the afternoon. Churrasco here is cut to order, and other street foods, including pastéis stuffed with meat or cheese, pão de queijo (Brazilian cheese bread), and coxinhas (chicken-filled croquettes), are also available. Pop over to the grocery side of the cafe to purchase treats like BIS Chocolate Wafer Biscuits and paçoquinha peanut candies or requeijão (spreadable cheese) for sandwiches or baguettes.\n\nAnother longtime Brazilian establishment in Marietta, Brazilian Bakery Cafe serves up street food staples, pastries, and desserts that run the gamut. Lunch offerings include popular Brazilian dishes like savory chicken pies, stuffed tapioca “crepes,” and handhelds like pastel and kibe (Brazil’s riff on Lebanese kibbeh). There’s also the humble Brazilian lunch sandwich made with pão francês or mini baguettes. Find pão de queijo, broa (a springy bite-sized corn bread with a hint of fennel), and guava-laced pastries, along with popular docinhos (little sweets) like brigadeiro and beijinho truffles.\n\nHeralded for offering similar grill and salad bar choices as Fogo de Chão — an international Brazilian steakhouse chain with locations in Atlanta and Dunwoody — but at a more accessible price point, Rio serves a traditional Brazilian buffet and churrasco, along with popular street foods, drinks, and desserts. Diners looking for a feast can go for the buffet-grill combo. For a lighter lunch or snack, choose from the extensive menu of Brazilian classics, such as beef- or cheese-filled pastel, one of the salgados (savory bites) like kibe, or some fried yuca. Pastries and sweets here come in all sorts of varieties, too, from arroz doce (sweet rice pudding) to the soft cream-filled doughnut known as sonho. Grab a maracujá (passion fruit drink) or a caipirinha to wash it all down.\n\nCo-owner Thiago Machado claims that Italians may have invented the pizza, but Brazilians improved it. The pizzas at this Berkeley Park ghost kitchen are light on sauce and come loaded with cheese and toppings, which is why these pies are traditionally eaten with a knife and fork. For meat lovers, try the calabresa topped with a generous layer of Brazilian sausage and sliced onions. There’s also the Frango Catupiry topped with shredded chicken, plenty of creamy Catupiry cheese, and a good sprinkling of oregano. Brasiliana also offers sweet varieties, such as the brigadeiro, which translates the fudgy Brazilian truffle into a chocolate-ladened pizza. Order a few different pizzas and a large bottle of Guaraná soda to share.\n\nWhen musician Rafael Pereira first opened the restaurant in 2018 at the Beacon in Grant Park, the menu offered several traditional Brazilian dishes and snacks. But, in 2022, he decided to take the food in a different direction, transitioning to street tacos. Despite this shift away from Brazilian fare, Buteco is still worth seeking out for an amazing caipirinha, the country’s national cocktail made with lime and cachaça (a liquor distilled from fermented sugarcane juice.) The restaurant also serves feijoada (Brazilian bean stew) on special occasions and features live samba, capoeira demonstrations, and other entertainment paying homage to Brazil. Don’t be surprised to see people dancing to live music on the patio or in front of Buteco on warm summer evenings in Atlanta. A second location is open at Southern Feedstore food hall in East Atlanta Village.\n\nMallú Cunha dedicates her home business to all sorts of gorgeous Brazilian docinhos that are typically ordered for children’s birthday parties, holidays, weddings, and special occasions.
