Around 10% milk is added to the whey and then the mixture is heated and then thin cream is formed which is drained. This produces the requeijao which is low in fat and hight in protein. &nbsp;It is similar to ricotta and used to make cheese spreads also. Reques&oacute;n from Portugal is solid and white in colour. It is strong in taste and sold in plastic containers. Reques&oacute;n from Brazil is a white cream cheese with mild taste.&nbsp;\r\nReques&oacute;n is served with honey, jam, or sprinkled with sugar and cinnamon. It can be added to salads, pasta and enchiladas.",
