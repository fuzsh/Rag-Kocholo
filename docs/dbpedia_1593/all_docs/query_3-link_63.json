        "text": "Background\n\nDona Rita is a new food start-up with a mission to bring P√£o de Queijo to London.\n\nLet‚Äôs start by introducing ourselves:\n\nRita moved to the UK with her family in 2002. Since then she‚Äôs always baked Brazilian cheese bread at home. Throughout the years she tried many different recipes until she cracked the perfect one.\n\nPedro is Rita‚Äôs son. He works as a web developer and likes to take photos. Sometimes he writes articles about things he builds or makes. He‚Äôs the one writing this.\n\nClara is Pedro‚Äôs girlfriend. The idea to start this venture is hers. Being allergic to gluten meant it was pretty much impossible for her to eat nice-tasting bread. When she tried Rita‚Äôs cheese bread for the first time she could not believe they were gluten free and became obsessed with them.\n\nP√£o de Queijo translates to ‚ÄúCheese bread‚Äù. From now on I‚Äôll start using this term.\n\nThe idea\n\nIt never crossed my mind to try and make a business out of selling P√£o de Queijo. I guess it‚Äôs because I grew up eating them and pretty much always had some at home that my mum used to make.\n\nAfter Clara became addicted with P√£o de Queijo she was always saying that we should start selling them. She was convinced that everyone would love them, and the fact that they‚Äôre naturally gluten free would change the lives of many coeliacs out there.\n\nOne morning Cara came across this post on Instagram. It was uploaded by our friend Alan from New York, quoting:\n\nI can‚Äôt get enough of #paodequeijo\n\nClearly this was the moment Clara had made up her mind to introduce my mum‚Äôs P√£o de Queijo to London. I guess our work started there and then. Thanks Alan üëã\n\nThe Strategy\n\nWith a little hand from Raphael Campos we started putting together an initial strategy for our business. Why are we doing this? How are we gonna do it? Who are our competitors?\n\nThis helped us get a broader vision of what our branding and tone of voice would be like, who our target audience would be, where we would position ourselves in the market, etc‚Ä¶\n\nIt also served as a reference point, everything we did from then on should be inline with the initial strategy.\n\nInitial learning curve\n\nThe skillsets that Clara and I have could cover some of the work, for example: we could do the initial strategy, branding, website, social media, a bit of advertising and anything digital/tech related.\n\nRita knew exactly how to make the most delicious P√£o de Queijo, her secret recipe was already spot on. So our product was pretty much ready.\n\nBut we didn‚Äôt now anything about the food industry. Where should we start? Apart from creating a virtual brand, how can we put it out there? What sort of licenses do we need? Can the kitchen in our home be used as the kitchen for the business? The list of questions went on‚Ä¶\n\nWe spent a fair amount of time researching, reading articles and figuring out the right way to get this business going. And this was the biggest learning curve for us.\n\nNote you can find all the links I‚Äôve found helpful at the end of this article.\n\nMinimum Viable Product\n\nAs this is a side project Clara and I decided to go MVP with everything. We only had a couple of hours each week day and the weekends to work on this, so time was precious.\n\nWhen building your own product, it can be quite easy to become emotionally attached to it and allow perfectionism to get in the way of productivity. We had learned that from our day jobs and decided to apply our learnings to this. We started with something that we liked and shipped it. If needed we could always go back and iterate.\n\nName\n\nOne of our first tasks was to choose a name. We shared ideas with our friends, as we thought this was a great way to come up with a name. In the end we decided to go ahead with Dona Rita, thanks to our friend Kaue üëç\n\nBranding\n\nClara took a weekend to work on the branding. That was enough to get us going. We had a temporary logo, a typeface, a slogan and a colour palette.\n\nPhotography\n\nWe did a mini-photoshoot that took roughly 4 hours. My mum came round and we baked some P√£o de Queijo, luckily for us the weather was good and the perfect amount of sun was shining through our window. The natural light helped give the photos a really nice colour and tone.\n\nAt the end we had about 12 photos that would serve as our initial content for social media and the website üéâ\n\nWebsite\n\nIt took us about two days to have something live. We considered using a Squarespace or Wordpress theme but ended up using a simple custom solution. At this stage we didn‚Äôt have much content and we weren‚Äôt ready to sell online. We went with a one page approach, where all your content lives on one page rather than many different pages with little content. Clara designed the website in Sketch and I built in Atom. I bought the domain on Namecheap and hosted the site on Github Pages.\n\nOverall, the website was well received. It even had the pleasure of being featured on some inspirational websites:\n\nLovely, minimal One Pager promoting the ‚ÄúBrazilian Cheese Bread‚Äù by Dona Rita. A good reference to how less-is-more with only 4 quality (well selected) images used in the whole site.\n\n‚Äî onepagelove.com\n\nPackaging\n\nHere‚Äôs where things started to get a little trickier. Packaging consists of two parts ‚Äî the design and the physical packaging. Although they‚Äôre different, they‚Äôre closely dependant on each other.\n\nWe decided to go with a ‚ÄúStand up pouch‚Äù type of packaging and we spent a few hours researching where to buy them from. We started off by trying to buy them from websites such as AliExpress or Alibaba but their Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ) was too high for us. So in the end we found some decent UK based companies (will share the links at the end).\n\nIdeally we wanted to have the branding printed on the packaging, however the MOQ struck again. In order to do that the we‚Äôd have to purchase a hell of a lot of pouches. So our MVP solution was to go with a label and manually stick them on the pouches.\n\nWe also had some help from the great guys at Granola for Gangsters who gave us the name of the companies they were using for their packaging. Be sure to check them out!\n\nMVP conclusion\n\nWe found that the important thing is not to be blocked. Sometimes you may not be satisfied with how things are turning out, but progress is important. As long as you can keep moving you can always go back and improve.\n\nUser testing\n\nOur initial users were our friends. Every step of the process so far we asked them for their opinion. We created different spreadsheets for different topics where we kept a record of their response. We always chose the most voted option.\n\nGetting opinions from others proved to be very helpful to us. The main thing is to try and detach yourself from the things you are testing and take every criticism into account.\n\nProduct awareness\n\nIn order for people to want to buy our product, they needed to know what it was. So we had to find a way to introduce a brand new product to the UK.\n\nDigital appearance\n\nWe created Instagram, Twitter and Facebook profiles, started sharing some posts and followed some people who we thought might be interested in our product. After some time, we started getting some followers that were within our target audience. Other Instagram users shared photos of our product (thanks so much theglutenfreesuitcase, eatnlondon, myglutenfreeguide, lorileysesh, scottcaneat) and this helped spread the word.\n\nPhysical appearance\n\nWe contacted some WeWork offices and arranged to do some pop ups there (thanks for the tip Marina). The idea of doing those pop ups was to get a little bit of experience on how to bake them at a larger scale and to gather feedback from people.\n\nThen after contacting some food markets, we heard back from Druid St Market. We went there to demo our product to Miranda who‚Äôs running the show. After doing a trial period of 2 weeks, she offered us a permanent spot and now we‚Äôre trading there twice a month.\n\nFinally, we rented a stall at Old Street Station for 2 weeks. This is where we are right now (as of the time of writing this). This is by far the biggest event we‚Äôve done so far. It‚Äôs so intense that I‚Äôll dedicate a whole post just for it.\n\nPress\n\nWe wrote a Press Release and sent it out to some journalists. Luckily for us we had a couple of mentions that really helped us get some awareness. The Sunday Times posted a photo on their Instagram, Evening Standard wrote an article and Timeout London also wrote one.\n\nP√£o de Queijo. ‚ÄòWhat‚Äôs that?‚Äô I hear you cry. A wheat-free Brazilian cheese bread, duh: a staple snack found across the country, made from cassava flour and cheese, a crunchy outside giving way to a cloud-like interior. Sounds ace, right? Right\n\n‚Äî Timeout London\n\nWhere can I try it? I want some!\n\nGreat! You can now buy via our website but we‚Äôre currently only delivering to certain areas of London (MVP) as we‚Äôre having to do the deliveries ourselves.\n\nYou can also find us at:\n\nDruid Street Market\n\nWe trade at this lovely food market twice a month. We always announce the dates on our website and social media.\n\nOld Street Station Underground\n\nWe‚Äôre here until the 20th May! Check out our Instagram for opening times and updates.\n\nFree from and Allergy Show\n\nFrom the 7th till the 9th of July 2017. We‚Äôll be exhibiting at the Allergy and Free From Show at the Olympia Grand in London.\n\nHelpful links\n\nIf you are here because you‚Äôre starting your own food business I hope the links below can save you some time and headache:\n\nArticles\n\nStart up guide by Gov.uk\n\nHow to start a street food business\n\nGetting started in Street Food\n\nTools\n\nGithub ‚Äî I used this as a Task Management tool, Version control repository and hosting provider. But feel free to use your preferred set up. If this is outside your area, then I recommend at least using Trello as a task management tool, it‚Äôs a simple and very powerful tool.\n\nSketch ‚Äî Clara‚Äôs design tool of choice üëå\n\nPackaging\n\nSwisspac Pouches\n\nPouch Direct\n\nLabels (they also offer many more things)\n\nNutritional Information\n\nCertificates\n\nFood hygiene certificate\n\nAccountancy\n\nFreeAgent ‚Äî we‚Äôre using Chandler Wells as our accountant and it comes with a FreeAgent subscription.\n\nCredits\n\nWe‚Äôd like to say a huge thank you üíõ to everyone who helped us, gave us advice, tips, shared with their friends.\n\nStay in touch"
