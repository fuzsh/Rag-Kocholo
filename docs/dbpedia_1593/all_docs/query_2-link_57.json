        "text": "The annual Awards Program of the American Dairy Science Association was held virtually on June 22, 2020. Graduate Student Division leaders Miriam Snyder and Heather Keefer-McCain and Past President Geoff Dahl read the citations. The association greatly appreciates the continued generosity and support of the donors in presenting the annual awards to ADSA® members.\n\nAudino Melgar Moreno\n\nRecipient of the 2020 Alltech Inc. Graduate Student Paper Publication Award\n\nAudino Melgar Moreno is the recipient of the 2020 Alltech Inc. Graduate Student Paper Publication Award for the Journal of Dairy Science paper titled “Effects of 3-nitrooxypropanol on rumen fermentation, lactational performance, and resumption of ovarian cyclicity in dairy cows.” This paper, published in the January 2020 issue of the Journal of Dairy Science, was selected as an Editor's Choice by Editor-in-Chief Paul Kononoff. The research was conducted at The Pennsylvania State University under the supervision of Alexander N. Hristov as part of Melgar Moreno's PhD program. The objective of Melgar Moreno's research was to examine enteric methane emission, rumen fermentation, lactational performance, sensory properties of milk, and resumption of ovarian cyclicity in early-lactation dairy cows receiving 3-nitrooxypropanol (3-NOP), a recently developed enteric methane inhibitor under investigation. The study determined that 3-NOP supplementation at a rate of 60 mg/kg of feed dry matter decreased daily methane emission by 26% with no negative effects on feed intake and did not affect lactational performance or onset of ovarian cyclicity of the cows. Also, inclusion of 3-NOP triggered no perceptible changes in the sensory properties of milk and cheddar cheese made from that milk.\n\nMelgar Moreno grew up in Pese, Panama, and completed a bachelor's degree in animal science at the University of Panama in 1999. In 2000, Melgar Moreno joined the Panamanian Institute of Agricultural Research (IDIAP), where he has been working up to date. In 2002, Melgar Moreno moved to the United States for a master's degree program in animal sciences at the University of Idaho and studied ruminal rate and extent of degradation of 15N-labeled nitrogen fractions in alfalfa forage in the laboratory of Alexander N. Hristov. After completion of his program, Melgar Moreno returned to his research position at IDIAP in Panama. In 2016, Melgar Moreno received a scholarship from the Government of Panama to pursue a PhD in dairy cattle nutrition at The Pennsylvania State University. His research focused on enteric methane emission and lactational performance of dairy cows fed 3-NOP. As part of his dissertation, Melgar Moreno conducted four experiments. His studies demonstrated that mixing 3-NOP with the total mixed ration allows continual consumption of 3-NOP throughout the day and has been shown to be effective to decrease daily enteric methane emission, emission yield (expressed in grams of methane per kilogram of dry matter intake), and emission intensity (grams per kilogram of energy-corrected milk) measured with the GreenFeed system. Overall results from these experiments suggest that the investigational methane inhibitor 3-NOP is a promising feed additive for reducing enteric methane emission with no negative effects on feed intake while maintaining lactational performance in dairy cows and potentially increasing milk fat yield. If adopted, this mitigation practice could lead to a substantial reduction of greenhouse gas emissions from the ruminant livestock sector. Melgar Moreno has published two of his recent experiments (with two more currently under review), has coauthored more than a dozen peer-reviewed scientific publications, has published more than 10 abstracts and conference papers, and has given several oral and poster presentations in various regional, national, and international meetings. Upon completion of his PhD program in spring 2020, Melgar Moreno returned to his research position at IDIAP in Panama.\n\nChristiane Girard\n\nRecipient of the 2020 American Feed Industry Association Award\n\nChristiane Girard was born and raised on a dairy farm in the Eastern Townships in the province of Québec, Canada. She undertook her undergraduate studies, MSc, and PhD at Laval University, Québec. She then went through post-doctoral training at the National Institute for Research in Dairying (NIRD), Shinfield, Reading, United Kingdom. Since her return to Québec, she has worked as a research scientist at the Sherbrooke Research and Development Centre of Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada. Girard's work on B vitamins has challenged and led to the revision of the generally accepted concept that dietary requirements of dairy cows for B vitamins do not have to be taken into account because their synthesis by the rumen microflora is sufficient to prevent deficiency symptoms. Girard's work mainly focuses on how increased supply of B vitamins improves the metabolic efficiency of lactating cows while reducing the incidence of metabolic disorders in early lactation. In addition, improved metabolic efficiency reduces the environmental footprint of dairy farms. Providing an adequate supply of B vitamins is achieved through either vitamin supplements or nutritional strategies promoting the synthesis of these vitamins. Moreover, Girard's studies aiming to increase the vitamin B12 content of animal products, especially milk and milk products, respond to the human health concerns about the risks posed by mandatory supplementation with folic acid of flours and cereal products for people whose vitamin B12 status is suboptimal. In order to carry out this work, Girard has developed in her laboratory a unique expertise allowing the determination of most B vitamins in various biological media. Girard has authored or co-authored more than 150 peer-reviewed papers and book chapters as well as 270 scientific communications and extension papers and has received many invitations to present at scientific and extension meetings in North and South America and Europe. She has also been very active in the supervision of research activities of graduate students. She has been directly involved, as co-supervisor, in the supervision of 18 graduate students and post-docs and has been an active committee member for students from Canadian and American universities. She is a member of the academic board for the PhD program in nutritional sciences at the University of Milan, Italy. She is also the head of the dairy section at the Sherbrooke Research and Development Centre. Over the years, Girard has made numerous contributions to several distinguished organizations. She has been associate editor and then editor-in-chief of Canadian Journal of Animal Science. She has also been a member of the editorial board and then chair of the board for Animal Frontiers, a CJASEAAP-ASAS collaborative journal. She is also associate editor for Animal. Girard's work has clearly led the path and truly made an outstanding contribution to improve estimations of supply and requirements of B vitamins. In a perspective of precision farming to optimize metabolic efficiency, meeting dairy cow requirements for B vitamins cannot be overlooked.\n\nAntonio Faciola\n\nRecipient of the 2020 Cargill Animal Nutrition Young Scientist Award\n\nAntonio Faciola grew up in a ranch in the Brazilian Amazon, where his family raised water buffaloes and beef cattle for more than 100 years. He received BS and MS degrees in animal sciences from the Federal University of Viçosa, Brazil, and a PhD in dairy science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison under Glen Broderick's supervision. Faciola has held a tenure-track assistant professor position at the University of Florida (UF) since July 2017, which followed his appointment as an assistant professor at the University of Nevada (UNR) from June 2013 to June 2017. The overarching goal of his laboratory group is to improve the efficiency of nutrient utilization by dairy cows in order to enhance production and minimize the environmental impact of dairy operations. Since 2013, Faciola has published 43 peer-reviewed articles, 34 as the corresponding author, including a Journal of Dairy Science Editor's Choice article in 2014. To further disseminate findings from his work directly benefitting dairy producers and other stakeholders, Faciola regularly publishes articles in popular press and social media.\n\nTo support and grow his research program, Faciola has secured more than $5.4 million in competitive grants as the principal investigator (PI), co-PI, or collaborator. These include NSF, USDA-NIFA, USAID, Hatch, institutional, foundation, and industry contracts. Among these, he was the lead PI on a project that evaluated canola meal as a protein supplement for dairy cows. This work has demonstrated that canola meal improves milk production by about 1 kg/d per cow when it replaces soybean meal in the diet of dairy cows, which has had a significant impact on dairy production and has contributed to the wide adoption of canola meal in the diets of dairy cows throughout the United States and beyond. Moreover, he is a co-PI in a newly awarded $2.3 million, 5-year NSF project aiming at evaluating microalgae as alternative feedstuff for dairy cows.\n\nSince 2013, Faciola has established international collaborations with scientists in Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Israel, Kazakhstan, Slovakia, South Africa, Thailand, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. He presented 23 invited talks in 9 countries (Brazil, Canada, Croatia, Italy, South Africa, Thailand, Turkmenistan, United States, and Uzbekistan). Since 2013, Faciola has mentored 7 MS students, 8 PhD students, 24 visiting scholars, 3 postdocs, and more than 55 undergrads in his laboratory. Faciola has mentored individuals from 16 countries (United States, Brazil, Cambodia, China, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Greece, Guyana, Nicaragua, South Korea, Spain, Thailand, India, Cuba, Venezuela, and Ukraine) in his laboratory, highlighting his international impact and commitment to diversity and inclusion of scholars from diverse backgrounds. Faciola has built a phenomenal group of young scientists and has closely mentored them into a cohesive and productive team. In recognition of these efforts, he was awarded the 2016 Researcher of the Year Award in the College of Agriculture at UNR (the first assistant professor to receive this honor), the 2017 Early Career Innovator Award (the most prestigious campus-wide early career award at UNR), the 2018 Lallemand Forward Award for Scientific Excellence in Dairy Nutrition Award by ADSA, and the 2019 Mentor of the Year at UF.\n\nDonna Amaral-Phillips\n\nRecipient of the 2020 DeLaval Dairy Extension Award\n\nDonna M. Amaral-Phillips, an extension professor and dairy extension specialist at the University of Kentucky, received her BS degree from the University of Connecticut, MS from North Carolina State University, and PhD in nutritional physiology from Iowa State University. Her educational extension programs and supporting scholarly materials strive to increase the knowledge of dairy and other livestock producers, allied industry partners, and the next generation of dairy leaders in the areas of nutrition and related management practices. Through a better understanding of the underlying scientific concepts behind management practices, producers can better understand how to best incorporate these concepts into their dairy businesses. Over her career, she has been an active leader at the national level, sourcing and peer-reviewing materials for extension-based audiences. Most recently, she served as the project leader for DAIReXNET, a national extension-driven dairy web resource, which provided dairy-related audiences with science-based, peer-reviewed materials and educational opportunities. This project illustrated what was possible when extension and research faculty and local extension educators work together collectively on a national basis to provide educational opportunities to end users (i.e., dairy producers, allied industry personnel, consumers, and undergraduate students). In addition to compiled resources articles for 12 subject areas, this resource published monthly articles on timely nutrition topics and was one of the first national groups to have a monthly archived webinar series. Amaral-Phillips has also been a co-coordinator for the North American Invitational 4-H Dairy Quiz Bowl for 32 years, an invitational, national youth event designed to increase the knowledge of dairy foods and production while building life skills in the next leaders in the dairy industry.\n\nIn Kentucky, Amaral-Phillips’ extension program has included many different targeted educational sessions designed to illustrate how best to incorporate new research findings into feeding and management programs for dairy replacements and transition, dry, and lactating dairy cows. Curriculum for these sessions involved not only lecture-type sessions but also hands-on approaches and farmer discussions to best illustrate how to incorporate concepts on-farm. Some of her best extension work was done sitting around a kitchen table or standing in a commodity shed listening to the concerns of a farmer and his or her family. Sometimes our most impactful work has nothing to do with dairy science but rather is related to the human aspects of a family business.\n\nFor more than 20 years, Amaral-Phillips has been actively involved in the interdisciplinary “Master Grazer” project on designing grazing systems for all ruminant species. Amaral-Phillips is the editor and author of many articles in a 4-page monthly newsletter for Kentucky extension educators and dairy industry. Over her career, Amaral-Phillips has authored or co-authored 52 peer-reviewed extension articles, 356 articles for Kentucky farmers, 48 published proceedings articles, and 144 radio tapes. Numerous popular press articles were either republished or abstracted in leading US and international dairy magazines and US and Kentucky allied industry newsletters. Amaral-Phillips has served on numerous ADSA national committees and has been president of the Southern branch of ADSA. She has received the Southern ADSA Honor Award and the University of Kentucky Whitaker Award for Excellence in Extension.\n\nKatharine F. Knowlton\n\nRecipient of the 2020 Hoard's Dairyman Youth Development Award\n\nKatharine F. Knowlton is the Colonel Horace E. Alphin Professor of Dairy Science at Virginia Tech.

Along with personnel at the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, Knowlton created the Veterinary Scholars in Dairy Science program, offering accelerated admission to veterinary school for highly qualified students.\n\nAnyone who knows Knowlton understands her love for dairy judging. She is a successful collegiate dairy judging team coach; her teams have won the National Intercollegiate Dairy Cattle Judging Contest at the World Dairy Expo on four occasions. She developed a highly sought-after workshop for youth, Dairy Judging 101, which has been conducted in numerous states.\n\nKnowlton uses social media to increase visibility of the dairy science program and recruit undergraduates. She has two channels on YouTube: Virginia Tech Dairy Judging and Talking Cows with Uncle Al and KFK. The dairy judging channel has more than 1,130 subscribers and more than 130,000 views. She provides information for dairy youth and coaches wanting to develop dairy judging skills on Facebook.\n\nKnowlton assists with Virginia dairy youth activities and often serves as an official at state 4-H judging contests. She helps with Virginia FFA dairy cattle evaluation and management career development events by selecting classes and officiating. She has presented at numerous youth workshops.\n\nKnowlton was an advisor for the Dairy Club at Virginia Tech from 2000 to 2005 and 2007 to 2015. She was lead advisor for two of the club's most prominent events, Showcase Sale at Virginia Tech and Little All-American Dairy Show. Although not technically a Dairy Club advisor now, she continues to assist the club whenever needed.\n\nKnowlton chairs the planning committee for the Hokie Cow Classic, an annual golf tournament fundraiser. Funds raised from the tournament provide scholarships for dairy science students and support for 4-H programs, collegiate dairy judging teams, and Dairy Challenge teams.\n\nKnowlton's work in developing youth to lead the dairy industry could be described as passionate, joyful, high quality, creative, compassionate, engaging, dynamic, and cooperative. She is a dairy educator who is making a difference in the classroom and well beyond.\n\nSanjeev Anand\n\nRecipient of the 2020 International Dairy Foods Association Research Award in Dairy Foods Processing\n\nSanjeev Anand is a well-recognized and highly respected dairy science professional, specialized in microbiological quality and safety of dairy foods, with about 36 years of teaching and research experience. He obtained his MS and PhD degrees in dairy microbiology from the National Dairy Research Institute, India. He was also a visiting professor at the Canadian Research Institute for Food Safety, University of Guelph, Ontario (2001–2002), where he specialized in the application of quorum signals and bioreporters in studying bacterial virulence markers with Mansel Griffiths.\n\nAnand worked for the Agricultural Research Services, Indian Council of Agricultural Research from 1985 to 2006 and rose through the ranks of scientist to principal scientist. He joined South Dakota State University in 2006 as an assistant professor of dairy manufacturing. Since 2014, he has held the rank of professor in the Dairy and Food Science Department within the College of Agriculture, Food and Environmental Sciences.\n\nAnand has taught two undergraduate-level courses (Dairy Microbiology and Food Microbiology) and a graduate-level course (Advanced Dairy and Food Microbiology) since 2006.

Anand is a recipient of several professional awards, including the 2018 IDFA Teaching Award, 2019 Gamma Sigma Delta Teaching Award, and 2020 Fishback Honors Advocate, to name a few.\n\nF. Xavier Malcata\n\nRecipient of the 2020 International Dairy Foods Association Teaching Award in Dairy Manufacturing\n\nF. Xavier Malcata received a BSc degree in chemical engineering from the University of Porto (UP, Portugal) and a PhD in chemical engineering/food science from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He is currently full professor at the College of Engineering of UP and past chairman of the College of Biotechnology of the Portuguese Catholic University (UCP).\n\nMalcata has for almost three decades been involved in teaching food subjects, first at UCP and later at UP. Both of these institutions are national- and European-accredited universities and have consistently ranked as the best in their areas in Portugal and among the top 50 universities in Europe. He always was particularly fond of dairy products and processes, not only for their challenging physicochemical diversity and complexity but also for their socioeconomic importance in Mediterranean countries.\n\nMalcata believes that the major role of a university is to educate its students to help them become mature, trustworthy, competent, diligent, and active elements of society, both in technico-scientific issues and citizenship values. All these points permeate his instructional approach and have comprehensively been conveyed to hundreds of students to date. In addition to having contributed to the design and teaching of several courses in dairy food manufacture, quality, and safety, he has made a difference in stating that although knowledge can be transferred through textbooks and other audiovisual aids, the main ideas and key concepts need to be communicated to the student in an organized, logical, and interactive fashion and built upon critical thinking.\n\nMalcata has succeeded as a role model for all faculty, as extensively recognized by his peers and by students who have been exposed to his style and learned how to approach and solve complex problems in their job practice after university training. Those who got to know him have been impressed by his keen intellect, his prodigious work ethic, his unique ability to arouse curiosity and communicate the essence of food manufacture and processing in a rational and integrated fashion, and his capacity to motivate others and create consensus around innovative ideas.\n\nThe service rendered by Malcata to the dairy industry has grown out of application of his distinguished record of basic and applied research, education, and industrial outreach. His pioneering work on characterization and technological improvement of traditional dairy foods and development of novel dairy-based functional products has led to several patents in addition to approximately 600 technical presentations in technico-professional meetings worldwide and more than 400 refereed publications; he was accordingly bestowed the French decoration Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Palmes Académiques. He has also received numerous prestigious awards, such as the Ralph Potts Memorial Award and the Young Scientist Research Award from American Oil Chemists’ Society (AOCS), the Canadian and International Constituency Investigator Award in Physical Sciences and Engineering from Sigma Xi (international honor society of scientific research), the Scientist of the Year Award by European Federation of Food Science and Technology, the International Leadership Award and the Elmer Marth Educator Award from International Association for Food Protection, and the Samuel Cate Prescott Award and the William V. Cruess Award from Institute of Food Technologists (IFT) in addition to the Foundation Scholar Award–Dairy Foods Division, the Danisco International Dairy Science Award, and the Distinguished Service Award from American Dairy Science Association. Malcata has meanwhile been elected by his peers for Fellow of AOCS, IFT, ADSA, and International Academy of Food Science and Technology.\n\nChristian Maltecca\n\nRecipient of the 2020 J. L.

His main areas of interest are the genetic improvement of functional traits as well as optimizing methods and breeding scheme designs under genomic selection. Maltecca is among the most active and prolific geneticists in his field and maintains active connections with the global livestock industry either through his own initiative or through collaborations with other institutions.\n\nMaltecca has published more than 100 refereed papers in scientific journals; about 30% of these papers were published in the Journal of Dairy Science. He has also published 4 books and book chapters and more than 200 technical articles and abstracts. Maltecca is a highly sought-after international partner, collaborating on several projects with some of the most productive and relevant research groups in the world. The overall focus of Maltecca's research is the integration of a wide array of genomic technologies in selection programs. His work spans different species, including dairy and beef cattle as well as swine. Maltecca developed and refined methodologies for genomic selection with Bayesian non-linear models. More recently he has investigated the application of these methods to disease resistance, functionality, and health traits in dairy cattle, and results from one of his graduate student's thesis in collaboration with the USDA AGIL group have provided the foundation for the implementation of genomic selection for disease resistance traits for US dairy cattle.\n\nOne of his current areas of research revolves around the use of genomic information to manage diversity and minimize the unfavorable effects of inbreeding in livestock, an area that, with the widespread adoption of genomics, is playing an increasingly important role in breeding programs. For his research work, Maltecca has received the Faculty Scholar Award from NCSU. In his 12 years of tenure at NCSU, Maltecca supervised 10 visiting students from 5 countries and 3 postdoctoral fellows. Maltecca has successfully advised to completion 7 PhD students and 2 MSc students. For his contribution to graduate student mentoring, Maltecca received the CALS Outstanding Graduate Instructor Award in 2020. In recognition of his remarkable contributions to dairy cattle breeding and genomics, Maltecca is a very deserving recipient of the J. L. Lush Award in Animal Breeding.\n\nErin Horst\n\nRecipient of the 2020 National Milk Producers Federation Richard M. Hoyt Award\n\nErin Horst grew up on a small farrow-to-finish swine farm in Van Horne, Iowa. After graduating high school in 2011, she attended Iowa State University for her bachelor's degree in animal science. Throughout her undergraduate career, Horst worked with Lance Baumgard's research team on a number of swine and dairy experiments, and her contributions resulted in a coauthorship on a paper published in Physiological Reports. Horst completed her degree in May 2015 and then began her PhD in Baumgard's program. There, Horst conducted research examining the effects of immune activation on energetic homeostasis. Her work demonstrates the unique alterations in nutrient partitioning animals use to fuel activated leukocytes, which utilizes copious amounts of glucose during and following an acute, intensive immune insult. Horst's research also evaluates the effects of immune activation on calcium homeostasis and how maintaining eucalcemia alters this response. Results of this work validate the role that immune activation plays in hypocalcemia and challenge long-held dogmas (that periparturient hypocalcemia is pathological) in animal physiology and nutrition. Aside from the mechanistic objectives of Horst's research, she also investigates pragmatic approaches (e.g., chromium propionate or zinc amino acid complex) to mitigate the negative consequences of infection. Ultimately, her research demonstrates that many adverse health outcomes observed during the transition period can be explained at least partially by immune activation and the corresponding inflammatory response. Horst's catalog of work includes first authorship on 5 recently published papers in the Journal of Dairy Science, coauthorship on 16 additional papers, as well as 17 conference proceedings and 37 abstracts. Horst has accepted a position with Innovative Liquids LLC upon the completion of her PhD (June 2020).\n\nJohn K. Bernard\n\nRecipient of the 2020 Nutrition Professionals Inc.

He holds degrees from SUNY Morrisville, Cornell University, Penn State University, and the University of Tennessee. He currently is the primary or co-instructor of four undergraduate courses. Animal Genetics and Selection is the primary genetics course in the animal science major and includes students from other disciplines. Dairy Cattle Evaluation and Selection is an upper-level genetics course specifically focused on the dairy industry. Dechow has developed mating simulations for both genetics courses so that students can gain firsthand knowledge about making selection decisions. In the dairy genetics course, students are assigned their own “herd” of approximately 50 cows. The first round of matings is based on the information available to breeders before the era of sire proofs, and each successive round is based on historical advances in dairy genetics. Students from other universities compete with Penn State students and industry professionals during the simulation. Dechow also teaches or co-teaches two dairy management courses. Dairy Problem Solving teaches students to use dairy management software such as DairyComp 305 and PCDart to manage data and make decisions. Dairy Management Systems is co-instructed and is Penn State's capstone dairy management course. Dechow also presents guest lectures about animal genetics in Penn State's companion animal, beef, and introductory animal science courses.\n\nHis teaching is not limited to Penn State. He is a contributor to the United States Dairy Education and Teaching Consortium. He developed the genetics module for a dairy production and management massive open online course developed by Penn State faculty members that has received more than 29,000 views worldwide. He also is the author of a widely read column in Hoard's Dairyman that appears 10 times per year and covers a wide variety of dairy genetics–related issues. In addition to his teaching responsibilities, Dechow is heavily involved in undergraduate advising. In a typical year he will have 10 to 12 advisees, with several of these enrolled in the Schreyer Honors College. Undergraduate students are important contributors to his research program. Many have presented talks or posters at the American Dairy Science Association annual meetings, completed their honors thesis, and served as co-authors for peer-reviewed publications. As co-advisor of the Dairy Science Club, Dechow has contributed greatly to student leadership development. Over the past 7 years, the club has been named Outstanding Chapter by the ADSA Student Affiliate Division six times. For the past 10 years, he has also served as the coach of the Pennsylvania 4-H Dairy Cattle Judging Team. Each of his teams has ranked in the top 10 nationally, and he has coached four teams that have placed first or second. In 2013, he was inducted into Penn State's College of Agricultural Science's Community of Teaching Excellence. He has also been awarded the Arthur W. Nesbitt Faculty Program Development Award by Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences.\n\nJuan Loor\n\nRecipient of the 2020 West Agro Inc. Award\n\nJuan Loor is professor of animal sciences and nutritional sciences at the University of Illinois, Urbana. He is an internationally recognized leader in the application of functional genomics and bioinformatics to study ruminant mammary gland physiology. Loor leads a broad dairy science research program using “omics” tools, with special emphasis on how feeding affects mammary gland metabolic and immune function. His group generated the first large-scale transcriptome profile of the Holstein cow mammary gland across the lactation cycle. It revealed that metabolic signaling pathways such as PPAR, Jak-STAT, and mTOR along with immune/antioxidant pathways (toll-like receptor and KEAP1-NRF2) not only are dynamic across stages of lactation but also associate with molecular control of carbohydrate, lipid, and amino acid metabolism in addition to innate immune responses. This seminal work served as the foundation for subsequent research to understand mechanisms whereby long-chain fatty acids, essential amino acids, and polyphenols regulate metabolism (milk fat and protein synthesis) and immune response (inflammation and oxidative stress) of the mammary gland. Loor's research is supported by the NIFA-AFRI, feed industry, and international programs.\n\nLoor attended the University of California (Davis), where he majored in animal science and developed a passion for dairy cattle nutrition and mammary metabolism. He received his MS and PhD in dairy science and animal science from Virginia Tech, where he studied aspects of ruminant lipid metabolism. Prior to his appointment as assistant professor in 2005, he was a postdoctoral researcher at INRA (Clermont Ferrand) and the University of Illinois, Urbana. During his post-doc at Illinois, Loor trained on bovine functional genomics techniques and developed a keen interest in their application to dairy cattle nutritional physiology research. He was promoted to associate professor in 2011 and professor in 2018.\n\nLoor has authored more than 340 refereed scientific papers, of which 214 were published during the last 5 years and 98 were published in the Journal of Dairy Science. He has authored 8 book chapters and presented seminars at more than 80 national, international scientific, and industry meetings. Loor's h-index since joining Illinois is 45, with his publications being cited more than 4,100 times. He has mentored 19 PhD and 13 MS students and served as co-advisor or supervisor for more than 65 foreign scholars. Loor's dedication to ensuring the success of his mentees is exemplified by the fact that several have received the ADSA Midwest Young Dairy Scholar Award or the National Milk Producers Federation Richard M. Hoyt Award.\n\nLoor has received the Mead Johnson Award (American Society for Nutrition), Zoetis Animal Physiology Award (ADSA), Elanco Award for Excellence in Dairy Science (ADSA), AFIA Ruminant Nutrition Award (ASAS), and Animal Growth and Development Award (ASAS) and is the youngest JDS Club 100 member. At the University of Illinois, Loor has received the College of Agriculture Consumer and Environmental Sciences Faculty Award for Excellence in Research and the Faculty Award for Global Impact.

It is with great pleasure that ADSA and Zinpro Animal Health present Weary with the 2020 Zinpro Award for Excellence in Dairy Science.\n\nPierre Lacasse\n\nRecipient of the 2020 Zoetis Physiology Award\n\nPierre Lacasse undertook his undergraduate studies at the Agricultural Faculty of Laval University. Subsequently, he obtained an MSc in biology from Sherbrooke University and a PhD in animal science from McGill University in 1993. In 1994, he did a postdoc at Ruakura Agricultural Research Centre in Hamilton, New Zealand, where he investigated the relationship between mammary gland blood flow and milk production. Since 1995, he has been a research scientist in biology of lactation for Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada at the Sherbrooke R&D Centre in Quebec. He spent a 1-year work transfer (sabbatical) at the Unité mixte de recherche sur la vache laitière of INRAE at St-Gilles, France. Lacasse also holds adjunct professor status at McGill and Sherbrooke Universities.\n\nLacasse has made outstanding contributions to the understanding of the biological processes controlling lactation and immune resistance and to the development of tools and methods to improve the health, well-being, and longevity of dairy cows and to improve milk quality. Lacasse has distinguished himself with new findings in the areas of lactation physiology in dairy cows. Most remarkably, his recent results on the role of prolactin during ongoing lactation revived the importance of this hormone. Simple and inexpensive to implement, postpartum incomplete milking improves health and reproduction and is now adopted by a growing number of dairy farms. His idea of using prolactin inhibition at drying-off has led to the development of a product sold to farms in several countries. His work on milk iodine has helped the dairy industry solve an important problem.\n\nLacasse is a very productive scientist with 95 peer-reviewed scientific articles, 7 patents, 18 reviews, and 148 abstracts to his credit so far. He has directed the work of 14 postdoctoral fellows, 9 PhD students, 20 master's students, and more than 60 undergraduate students.\n\nHe is also involved in the management of large integrated research programs.

During his tenure as a graduate student, he focused on how nutrition could influence skeletal growth and development. With the dairy industry in mind and conflicting evidence in the literature, Batty summarized milk's influence on skeletal development in growing children and shed light on the subject of childhood milk consumption in relation to reaching one's genetic potential for optimal skeletal mass. Batty also helped investigate the role of selenium-enriched alfalfa hay on glutathione peroxidase levels in postpartum dairy cows. Currently, Batty is a student at the Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine working to become a doctor of veterinary medicine with interests in nutrition and surgery.\n\nCody McCary\n\nRecipient of the 2020 ADSA Foundation Graduate Student Literature Review Award: Production MS Division\n\nCody L. McCary was born in Kennewick, Washington. Although he did not grow up on a dairy, he credits family members and friends with giving him an appreciation for the agriculture community. He believes that even though he did not come from an agricultural family, his unique background helps him provide a pertinent and beneficial perspective to today's dairy consumers. Upon determining that he wanted to work in the agriculture industry, Cody gained experience through employment that included being a ranch hand at a beef feedlot near his home in eastern Washington and working at a dairy in central Utah. After moving around the United States for work and school, Cody and his wife and daughter currently enjoy their time outdoors in the mountains of Colorado.\n\nMcCary attended Utah State University, where he received a bachelor of science degree in animal, dairy, and veterinary science in winter 2017. McCary joined the Utah State University Dairy Science Team, where he competed in the 2016 Intercollegiate Dairy Challenge. Additionally, he worked alongside graduate students in the Utah State University Ruminant Nutrition Lab under the direction of Jong-Su Eun. During that time, he gained an appreciation for laboratory analyses. With this laboratory experience and the knowledge that forages make up a very significant part of a dairy cow's diet, McCary decided to continue his education through a master's program.\n\nMcCary began a master's program at the University of Florida under the supervision of Luiz F. Ferraretto. While at the University of Florida, he was involved in a plethora of experiments evaluating factors such as plant maturity at harvest, hybrid selection, processing techniques, packing techniques, cutting height, fibrolytic enzymes, silage inoculants, plant density, and silage sampling protocols, which can have an effect on forage quality. Cody's research program focused on strategies to improve the nutritive value of whole-plant sorghum silage. His projects aimed to provide a better understanding of how processing techniques at the time of harvest can affect whole-plant sorghum silage nutritive value and how plant population affects the nutritive value of whole-plant sorghum silage. These projects culminated in his review titled “Current perspectives on whole-plant sorghum silage production and utilization by lactating dairy cows.” McCary completed his MS degree in winter 2019 and is now applying the knowledge he acquired from his academic studies to his job as a dairy nutritionist with Purina Animal Nutrition.\n\nSamuel Alcaine\n\nRecipient of the 2020 ADSA Foundation Scholar Award in Dairy Foods\n\nSamuel Alcaine is an assistant professor of dairy fermentations in the Department of Food Science at Cornell University. He earned his BS (2002) from the University of Maryland, College Park, in cell, molecular biology, and genetics. He earned his MS (2007) from Cornell University in food science, and his PhD (2016) in food science from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Alcaine worked in industry for a number of years, first for Miller Brewing Company doing process and production innovation for their R&D division, and then for Unilever as the lead R&D food safety microbiologist for the North American Ice Cream business, before pursuing his PhD. He has been awarded more than $1.5 million in extramurally funded projects, published more than 20 peer-reviewed publications, and given more than 30 national and international presentations during his academic career. In July 2016, he joined Cornell with a unique opportunity to combine his love of fermentation and dairy to start the Alcaine Research Group (ARG). His faculty appointment is a 50/50 split between research and extension. At Cornell, he has served as a mentor to 13 graduate and 6 undergraduate students. Alcaine's research program works to leverage techniques from food microbiology, molecular biology, enzymology, and chemistry to develop, characterize, and control dairy fermentations. The ARG has focused on three key areas: fermentation-based methods to reduce dairy product spoilage, fermentation-based upcycling of dairy by-products, and bacteriophage-based applications for the control and identification of bacteria. In particular, the group has focused on characterizing non-traditional lactose-fermenting yeast and their utilization to convert acid whey and whey permeate into consumer-friendly alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages as well as value-added ingredients. The group has also done research into the use of microbially derived enzymes as natural controls for both spoilage and pathogenic bacteria in milk and cheese. Alcaine's extension program encompasses the key areas of yogurt and fermented dairy product manufacturing and dairy food safety. He is a preventive controls for human food lead instructor and heads a USDA-funded national dairy food safety coaching workshop program. He works with university extension, cheese guilds, and other dairy product groups across the country to provide in-person coaching to help small artisan dairy producers understand and develop FSMA-compliant food safety plans and improve their food safety practices. From 2016 to 2019, he served as a member-at-large for the ADSA Dairy Foods division and as a judge for the ADSA Dairy Foods Graduate Student Poster Competition. He currently serves as the secretary for the ADSA Dairy Foods Division. Alcaine was also recently honored with the 2019 ADSA Northeastern Branch/ASAS Northeastern Section Young Scientist Educator Award.\n\nMichael Steele\n\nRecipient of the 2020 ADSA Foundation Scholar Award in Dairy Production\n\nFor his innovative and highly productive research program and commitment to training future leaders of the dairy industry, Michael Steele has been awarded the 2020 ADSA Foundation Scholar Award. Steele was born and raised on a family dairy farm in Ontario, Canada, where he developed a keen interest in dairy cattle management and nutrition. In between and after his MSc and PhD degrees at the University of Guelph, he worked as a consultant in the Chinese dairy industry, as a nutritionist for Masterfeeds in Canada, and as a research scientist and technology transfer specialist for Nutreco Canada Agresearch. His vast experience in the national and international dairy industry not only highlights the breadth of his knowledge in the field but also has provided him with the ability to develop and nurture partnerships with the dairy industry as a whole. In 2014, Steele became an assistant professor at the University of Alberta, where he received an NSERC Industrial Research Chair (IRC) in dairy cattle nutrition. The overall objective of the NSERC IRC is to develop a better understanding of how common nutritional and management factors in dairy calf production impact gastrointestinal development during the preweaning period and later in life. In 2018, he accepted a position as an associate professor at the University of Guelph, where he continues to grow his NSERC IRC research. Despite focusing on this area of research for only a short period of time, he has established himself as a leader in this field, publishing more than 40 peer-reviewed articles related to calf nutrition and physiology and boosting his total publication record to more than 70 peer-reviewed articles. He has been an invited speaker at more than 100 national and international meetings, and in November 2019 he hosted and co-organized the Smart Calf Rearing Conference and Producer Day with Foerster-Technik and Trouw Nutrition at the University of Guelph, which focused on new concepts in calf nutrition, health, and welfare. He currently plays an active role in the Canadian Society of Animal Science as well as on the editorial board for the Journal of Dairy Science and as a director for the ADSA Production Section Board. As important as his commitment to producing novel research and knowledge transfer is Steele's devotion to training highly skilled students for academic and industry pursuits in the dairy industry. He has mentored more than 40 students at the undergraduate, MSc, and PhD levels and ensures that all students interact with a nutrition company before graduation by establishing exchange programs for his graduate students throughout Canada, the United States, and Europe to narrow the gap between academics and industry. His training style and fervent commitment to their success has resulted in all of his students winning major awards and obtaining careers in dairy sciences or industry. Steele's combined scientific record, industry and knowledge transfer experience, and devotion to training highly skilled students have made a notable impact on our national and international dairy industry.\n\nAdegbola Adesogan\n\nRecipient of the 2020 JDS Highly Cited Award\n\nThe Journal of Dairy Science Highly Cited Award is awarded to Adegbola Adesogan and co-authors for their paper titled “Meta-analysis of effects of inoculation with homofermentative and facultative heterofermentative lactic acid bacteria on silage fermentation, aerobic stability, and the performance of dairy cows,” which was published in the June 2017 issue of the Journal of Dairy Science.\n\nLance Baumgard\n\nRecipient of the 2020 JDS Highly Cited Award\n\nThe Journal of Dairy Science Highly Cited Award is awarded to Lance Baumgard and co-authors for their paper titled “Glucose requirements of an activated immune system in lactating Holstein cows,” which was published in the March 2017 issue of the Journal of Dairy Science.\n\nAdriano Cruz\n\nRecipient of the 2020 JDS Highly Cited Award\n\nThe Journal of Dairy Science Highly Cited Award is awarded to Adriano Cruz and co-authors for their publication titled “Rapid consumer-based sensory characterization of requeijão cremoso, a spreadable processed cheese: Performance of new statistical approaches to evaluate check-all-that-apply data,” which was published in the August 2017 issue of the Journal of Dairy Science.\n\nMatthew C. Lucy\n\nRecipient of the 2020 ADSA Award of Honor\n\nMatthew Lucy is a professor of animal science at the University of Missouri–Columbia. A native of New York State, he received a BS from Cornell University, where he developed an interest in dairy cows. He then moved to Kansas State University, where he began his studies of reproduction in postpartum dairy cows, and later completed a PhD in dairy science at the University of Florida on the same topic. He conducted postdoctoral research in the dairy research group at Monsanto (St. Louis, MO) before accepting a faculty position at the University of Missouri in 1994.\n\nLucy became a member of ADSA when he was a graduate student. Since then he has served ADSA in a variety of capacities, with most of his work involving the Journal of Dairy Science (JDS). He served on the editorial board from 1997 to 2002 and the journal management committee from 2001 to 2003. Afterward, he served as a section editor for Physiology from 2006 to 2012.\n\nIn 2014, Lucy became the editor-in-chief of JDS. His term concluded in 2019 (six years of service). During his tenure as editor-in-chief, Lucy sought to maintain the historical excellence of the journal and extend its reach. The journal has grown from approximately 8,000 pages in 2014 to more than 11,500 pages today (publishing more than 1,200 papers). The increase in the number of published papers has coincided with an increase in the journal impact factor from 2.573 to 3.082. JDS ranked fourth for Impact Factor among 61 journals in the Agriculture, Dairy and Animal Science category. The success of the journal would not have been possible without the dedicated efforts of many individuals, including section editors; reviewers; FASS staff including Susan Pollock, Louise Adam, and Shauna Miller; Elsevier staff and publishers; and the authors who submit their work to JDS.\n\nSeveral important initiatives were launched through the coordinated efforts of Lucy, the FASS staff, and Elsevier. These include reorganization and renaming of the journal sections, increasing the number of section editors serving the journal, increasing the number of editorial board members, preparation of new training materials for section editors, updating the journal website, updating the instructions for authors, increasing the presence of the journal on social media, and the development of special collections that highlight the journal content. Lucy conceived and led efforts to establish the “Club 100” (authors with 100 or more published articles in JDS) and to create the 100-year special issue to honor 100 years of JDS (published in December 2017 with J. P. McNamara acting as special issue editor).\n\nLucy is currently working with FASS and Elsevier to launch a new journal named JDS Communications. Development of this new journal will offer opportunities for existing authors to publish more content under the JDS brand and will provide new authors an opportunity to publish with JDS.\n\nCatherine Stanton\n\nRecipient of the 2020 ADSA Distinguished Service Award\n\nCatherine Stanton has been senior scientist at Teagasc, Moorepark Food Research Center, Ireland, for the past 25 years and is a research professor at APC Microbiome Ireland, University College Cork. She received an MSc (nutrition), PhD (biochemistry), and DSc in recognition of published work (2009). Her career focuses on development of innovative dairy foods that influence human health and the developing gut microbiota in early life. She is ranked in the top 1% by citations in the field of agricultural science (Clarivate Analytics, 2017, 2018, and 2019). She is a member of The Royal Irish Academy and previously received the International Dairy Federation Elie Metchnikoff Award.\n\nJDS Club 100: Class of 2020\n\nIndividuals who have authored or coauthored 100 or more papers in the journal were inducted into JDS Club 100 at the 2020 ADSA Awards Program. The JDS Club 100 class of 2020 included Giovanni Bittante, Glen A. Broderick, Jan Dijkstra, and Paul M. VanRaden."
