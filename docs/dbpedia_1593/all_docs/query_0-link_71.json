Portuguese cheeses are often enjoyed with traditional accompaniments such as local bread, olives, and sometimes with a drizzle of honey or fruit preserves. When visiting Portugal, exploring local markets or cheese shops is a great way to discover and savor the diverse cheese offerings in the country."
