        "text": "Grove Koger\n\nAs I noted in my January 7 post, my book When the Going Was Good is now out of print. I hope to complete a second edition, but in the meantime I plan to post revised and updated sections here. Today’s entry deals with a memoir by George Sand, who was born July 1, 1804. Maggie and I are looking forward to revisiting Majorca later this year, and will be staying in at least one of the locales— Palma—as the Sand/Chopin party.\n\n□□□\n\nWinter in Majorca (Un Hiver à Majorque). Paris: Souverain, 1842.\n\nProlific French novelist and memoirist George Sand (Amantine Lucile Aurore Dupin) was a great-granddaughter of the King of Poland, yet her sympathies lay with the peasantry and with her fellow creative spirits. She had been involved with such literary figures as Prosper Mérimée and Alfred de Musset before beginning a decade-long liaison with Polish composer Frédéric Chopin in 1838.\n\nSand visited the Spanish Mediterranean island of Majorca later that year, accompanied by her son Maurice, her daughter Solange, and her lover. Sand and Chopin hoped to escape the scandal that their affair had provoked in France, and to work on their respective arts. Chopin also hoped that a change of climate might ease his tuberculosis. Yet accommodations proved hard to come by. The group stayed briefly over a barrel maker’s shop in the capital city of Palma; in a roughly furnished house ominously named So’n Vent (“House of the Wind”) in nearby Establiments (depicted below in a drawing by Maurice); and finally in an abandoned Carthusian monastery in the mountains to the north near Valldemossa.\n\nThe account Sand published three years later pays lip service to Majorca’s scenery, but the writer “felt far from enraptured” (in Robert Graves’ translation) with other aspects of the island. Sand faults its people, its food (based primarily on the hog), its roads, and its weather. In their turn the Majorcans were clearly scandalized by Sand’s preference for men’s clothes, her fondness for tobacco, and her intimate relationship with a young man who was not only not her husband but whose illness, they felt sure, threatened everyone and everything he touched. (Sand never refers to Chopin by name, by the way, but only by such formulas as “our invalid.”) A Winter in Majorca is routinely celebrated as masterpiece of misunderstanding, but readers may come away with the impression that Sand and the Majorcans understood each other only too well.\n\n□□□\n\nThe standard English translation of Sands’ memoir is by poet Robert Graves, long resident in Majorca, who also contributes a foreword, a running counterpoint of entertaining notes, an historical summary, and a translation of “To George Sand: A Refutation” by J.M. Quadrado, originally published in a Majorcan periodical in 1841.\n\nFor further information about Sand and Chopin, I recommend William G. Atwood, The Lioness and the Little One: The Liaison of George Sand and Frédéric Chopin (New York: Columbia UP, 1980; and Bartomeu Ferrá, Chopin and George Sand in Majorca (Palma de Mallorca: Edicions la Cartoixa, 1961 (see below).\n\nShare this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nRelated"
