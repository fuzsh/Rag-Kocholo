        "text": "For me, food is connected to everything I hold close. I love the slowness of knowing my neighborhood farmer, butcher, and cheesemaker; the feeling of deep care and connection in the queer farming community; witnessing my nephew drool mid-moose meat indulgence; memories of suffering with pals through 6:00am rainy harvests; and the vastness of knowledge and culturally rich story-telling weaved throughout our communities.\n\nI feel drawn to this work for the ways that it allows me to move with slow and ongoing curiosity. The more people I meet and ingredients I taste, the more my eyes widen to the essence of good food. With an understanding that our food system is inseparable from broader social structures— for me, good food asks us to envision worlds that honour people– our relationships and responsibilities to each other and place. In any case, it’s the simple question of what goes unseen before those delicious shisto peppers make it into my belly that keeps me moving in my own processes of undoing disconnection from food, land, and collective.\n\nI hope this all goes to say— I’m grateful for the opportunity to support the vision that Growing Chefs, our partners, and communities have been tirelessly working on to create possibilities for a more just and accessible food system. It reminds me of all the caring, imaginative, and skilled people in my life who time and time again show me what is possible when we orient towards collective abundance.\n\nI inherited my love of all things green and leafy from my mother, whose passion for dirt, moss, and snails is unsurpassed. She had me out in the yard growing strawberries and zucchinis, and pulling great clumps of potatoes from the ground. I loved eating the fruit right off the plant and helping her wash the mud from our haul. Some of my best memories from childhood centre around the kitchen baking or cooking something delicious with my mom. I am grateful for the gift of knowing how to prepare healthy food inexpensively, especially now as the world continues to change around us and make food security and sustainability more prevalent concerns.\n\nI am also grateful to have grown up on the west coast of BC, which is just so beautiful, but also has a lengthy growing season! I spent several years in Toronto, and while it had many amazing benefits, the long winters and harsh summers were hard to get used to. I tried several times to plant a few pots, but they never survived the extreme August heat. I love that here in Vancouver I can start to see little sprouts popping out of the ground as early as mid-February, and that they will happily keep growing with little maintenance until Halloween.\n\nWhen I'm not out enjoying the lushness of my neighbourhood I spend my time writing, performing, and producing music. My grandfathers on both sides were noted audiophiles, and with a brother in radio it seems destined that I would also follow the path to music. I've been singing since I could talk, and writing my own songs since I was 14. Most recently, I released my first single with a UK-based indie label and with an album due out this fall, I am\n\nexcited for what the future holds.\n\nFun Fact: I have 14 cat mugs.\n\nA BIG GROWING CHEFS WELCOME TO OUR NEWEST TEAM MEMBER! WE’RE SO LUCKY TO HAVE YOU KAT!\n\nMy name is Kat Morrow and I'm thrilled to be joining the lovely team at Growing Chefs as the Communications and Engagement Assistant. I strongly believe that the divide between the food on our plates and our understanding of the places it comes from have deepened greatly over the past 100 years. I'm excited to be part of an organization that is striving to bridge that gap and helps current and future generations understand food production and sustainability. The more we investigate and comprehend where our food is coming from the more equipped we are to make better decisions for ourselves, our families, and our communities.\n\nI became interested in the path of seed to produce at a young age. Although my adult life has kept me in cities with no yard to harvest, I have always managed to fill a container or two with herbs, beans, lettuce, and even the occasional tomato. I also enjoy cooking and there is so much pride in eating something you've grown with your own hands. The end product always seems to taste better.\n\nCooking has always been that one self-care act that I took very seriously. I grew up as a semi-professional swimmer. I spent a lot of energy - and vitamins - practicing from Monday to Saturday for 3 hours per day. I began my swimming career when I was six years old, and I would travel around Brazil competing with kids who had practiced just as much as me.\n\nWhen I was around nine, we found out that I wasn’t getting enough vitamins into my diet, because I was spending too much energy swimming! That’s when my mother started taking meal planning very seriously. She was the person who supported me all the way from taking me to swimming practice to planning every piece of food that I’d put into my mouth. I woke up every morning with a slice of whole-grain bread with requeijão, half papaya with oat, two Brazilian nuts, two cashews, and two walnuts. That’s precisely what my body needed to grow healthier and perform better.\n\nAfter going to the nutritionist once a month for years and years, I grew up taking food planning very seriously. I’ve always been the person who spends two hours of my Sunday night prepping my meals for the week, and I do that until today.\n\nMy journey with Growing Chefs started in 2019, when I volunteered for the first time. Eating healthy food was crucial for me, and I was amazed to see that the work that Growing Chefs does was exactly what I needed when I was young.\n\nWhen I’m not working, I’m usually taking my dog, Shuri, for a walk at the park, lake, or at the beach. I also love spending time with my partner watching TV shows, and reading a good book to start my day.\n\nGROWING CHEFS WELCOMES A NEW ISLAND TEAM MEMBER! WE’RE SO HAPPY TO WELCOME YOU KELLY!\n\nHello! My name is Kelly and I am the new Victoria Program Coordinator at Growing Chefs! I’m so excited to be able to work with so many passionate educators, chefs, gardeners, nutritionists and other inspirational community members to help kids & communities become more connected to their food.\n\nI was born here in what is now known as Victoria, on the unceded Coast Salish Territories of the Lekwungen and W̱SÁNEĆ Peoples. I completed a BA in Interdisciplinary Studies at UBC in 2015 and throughout my undergrad, I was fortunate to have been able to take part in several experiential learning opportunities that were transformational for me.\n\nIn my third year, I went on an incredible 6-month exchange to Lund, Sweden, which is when I started to embrace lagom - a Swedish term for “not too little, not too much” and basically the Swedish art of living a balanced, happy life. I also began to develop a healthy connection to the community I lived in and the food I ate by joining one of the Student Nation clubs that hosted weekly dinners and other events where all the food was prepared and cooked for and by students. From fika (coffee breaks), to sittnings (dinner parties), to smorgasbords (feasts), so many fun social times revolved around food!\n\nFor most of my life, I didn’t realize how disconnected I was to the food I ate and the environment I lived in. However, that definitely changed during my undergrad. While working in food services on-campus, I noticed there was a tremendous amount of food waste which made me think more critically about our current food systems - How can we reduce our food waste? How is compost made and why is it important? Where does our food come from and how is it produced? How can I grow my own food? I was also living and working in the student residences and noticed that many students knew very little about how to grow or cook their own food.\n\nI connected with various food security organizations and began to get more involved in helping combat local food insecurity. I volunteered for several non-profit organizations as well as at the Indigenous Health Garden at the UBC farm; which led me to complete an 8-month practicum in Sustainable Agriculture - another incredible transformational journey! One of the highlights of the practicum program for me was being a part of the sustainable food movement on campus in multiple ways. As a server at one of the restaurants on campus that purchased produce from the UBC farm during the summer and fall months, it was super cool to be able to provide a personal ‘farm to table’ service to the restaurant guests.\n\nI have made a career of working in restaurants in a variety of positions. I have served, cooked, bartended, and managed in a variety of settings, but a couple of years ago I got the opportunity to run a series of children’s cooking classes over the summer. I was able to develop multiple age-appropriate menus and oversaw the classes. It was one of the most rewarding things I have ever done!\n\nMy love of food wasn’t sparked until I was in my mid-20s. Until then, I’d worked in restaurants primarily for the social aspect of connecting with my coworkers and community. It wasn’t until I went away to work in a remote camp in Alberta that I discovered my love for creating delicious food. That job also gave me the freedom to start travelling and discovering other cultures and their foods. Thai street food will always have a special place in my heart.\n\nOnce I settled back in Vancouver I brought two special little creatures into my life. I adopted bonded Boston Terriers named Bobby and Dana and they became my world. I wanted to be the best pet parent that one could be. Dana still remains with me to this day and she now has a new brother, Theo the kitten. On top of being a pet parent I also enjoy playing team sports. In the fall and winter I play dodgeball and in the spring and summer I play softball. If I am not snuggling my animals or playing a sport you will likely find me in my kitchen creating food for the folks I love or else working on a puzzle.\n\nHey friends! My name is Alex (she/her), and I will be joining Growing Chefs! this fall as a student intern while I pursue a degree in Sustainable Agriculture at Kwantlen Polytechnic University. When I was younger, I dreamed of my future career and I read books about massage therapy, mixology, and the behaviour of wolves, but I never imagined that I would one day be interested in agriculture. While I have always been a HUGE fan of tasty food and environmental studies, I did not realize this intersection at sustainable agriculture until I was in university. In school I discovered the amazing work that people do to push growing food to be more earth-friendly and community-friendly and this inspired me to change my school direction.\n\nMy school days are now filled with classes on an organic farm, collecting insects, learning about food systems, and joining Growing Chefs! in their quest to educate our communities. Much of the work I will be doing will be virtual, but it does not mean I feel any less a sense of togetherness as I did when I volunteered with Growing Chefs! in the fall of 2019. I am so pleased to be joining the team this semester and I encourage you to say hello to me if you see me around east Vancouver or on the Kwantlen Polytechnic University Campus.\n\nIn my free time I work to develop my mini jewellery business, spend time with my friends and family, exercise, listen to funny podcasts, grow vegetables, help run the Sustainable Agriculture Student Association at Kwantlen and volunteer with amazing groups such as Fresh Roots and the Astoria Urban Farm.\n\nGrowing Chefs’ friends and family:\n\nHAPPY HEALTHY 2021 to all! My name is Kara-Leigh Bloch and I have the honour to be the new Growing Chefs’ Executive Director. I am very excited to get to work with an amazing and inspiring group of staff, board members, volunteers, and their supportive partners, along with funders and collaborators. I have a deep respect and appreciation for local farmers and producers, chefs and restaurateurs, all who take pride in fresh, local, sustainable foods. Together, we will continue to connect chefs, kids, and communities, and promote healthy, just, sustainable food practices.\n\nOriginally from Edmonton, I grew up playing competitive women’s hockey and 10 pin bowling. I studied Human Ecology at the University of Alberta (Bachelor of Education and Bachelor of Science) where we used an interdisciplinary and holistic approach to examine the many contexts of people’s lives. In particular, my focus was on the inter-relationships people have with their near environments: family, community, and environment. While completing my double degree, I spent a semester abroad at a sister school in Lille, France. This was the beginning of my love of exploring new places, food, and culture.\n\nFrance changed my personal motto from “eat to live” to “LIVE TO EAT”. I jumped at the opportunity to live in a rural community with a host family that had two small children. My favourite memories are going to the Sunday marché, then making a big pot of soup with all the previous week’s leftover vegetables and enjoying it with a fresh baguette and some cheese. They crafted such impressive meals and exposed me to the French cuisine and the French way of life. When I tried my first freshly steamed artichoke (thinking they only came in a jar), it immediately became one of my favourite foods. My appreciation, relationship with, and my love of fresh local food deepened. After I graduated, I worked with the University of Alberta in Research on Aging Policy and Practice, then moved to Dominica/Grenada in the Caribbean to work with Help the Aged Canada as a Seniors Outreach Worker. Eventually in 2008, I settled in Vancouver to live in the same city as my now husband. By this time I was lucky enough to have lived in Montreal, Toronto, France, Dominica and travelled through Europe and Asia, and many other parts of the world!\n\nIt’s crazy to calculate it but I have been working in the non-profit sector for 20 years, mostly in senior housing and the homelessness sector. Most recently, I spent 11 years at Seniors Services Society of BC, 9 of those years as the Executive Director.\n\nI have two daughters (four and six years old), and the sweetest furbaby, Kobe, a labradoodle. Over the last few years, I started to shift my focus and priorities, and decided to redirect my career in an equally meaningful sector to me: food security and community development.\n\nI love food and wine, cooking, entertaining, and may have picked up the nicknames of “snack queen” or “Charcuterie Kara”. Since moving to Vancouver, I always say living here is like being on permanent vacation. The food and the activities around the city, from sea to sky, is the full meal deal.\n\nMy plan for the next few months as I onboard with Growing Chefs is to listen, to learn, and to take small meaningful steps through collaborating both inside and outside the food sector. Food connects us all. I see there is considerable opportunity to join forces with other social justice movements to dig into and address power imbalances and inequality and move towards food justice. I strongly believe that we need creative collective action to ensure that this new generation of kids learn to have healthy connections with food and understand its connectedness to our environment.\n\nWhen I first started working at Growing Chefs in early 2018, I wrote a similar introduction blog post where I talked about how food was my life long passion and how I have been cooking in the kitchen since I was a toddler - really my parents couldn’t get me out of the kitchen if they tried. Well, I am happy to report that over my time off I have continued to pass down my love of the kitchen and the garden to both my daughters.\n\nLucy, age 3.5, is now slowly learning to use a real knife and stir food at the stove but her favourite thing to do is roll dough out for pies and pizzas. Addy, age 19 months, loves to taste everything, “wash” dishes, and turn the blender button on. They both, of course, love to measure and mix things.\n\nBoth girls love to garden with me. Since we don’t have any winter crops in our small garden, we have been trying to grow microgreens this winter. The girls are eager to get back into the garden this Spring and Lucy has big plans of growing lots of flowers.\n\nWe also spent some time last Spring and Fall foraging in the forests close by our home. I love that I am able to share my passion for food and plants with my daughters, and that I get to work at an organization, like Growing Chefs, where those same passions align.\n\nI am so happy to be back to continue to advocate for a just, healthy, sustainable food system and to be able to help build the Growing Chefs community.\n\nMorgan, Growing Chefs is so lucky to have you back!\n\nFrankly, I am not shy about cooking and the culinary scene. Before deciding to study Human Resource Management at York University, I wanted to be a chef and food educator. With ties to the culinary arts, I never gave up my passion and interest in cooking. I even worked at a seafood restaurant in the West End of Vancouver as a prep cook for two months to gain a new perspective as a chef, and to keep my food skills and knowledge fresh. Although adventurous with my cooking, I remain grounded in experimenting with Asian cuisine due to comfort and familiarity. I like to relay back to my culture as the main focus and inspiration to my food creations. As long as I can make good food and share it with others, food origins are not strict and vital to me, since my ultimate goal is to unite people with my food! I believe food is a universal language meant to create new relationships and memories, which I strive to foster within my projects when thinking about food accessibility issues in a communal context."
