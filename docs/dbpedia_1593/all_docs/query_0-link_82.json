        "text": "We are excited to announce the launch of our Category Disruptors! First up: the Granola & Muesli category We congratulate ZEGO LLC, Struesli, One Degree Organic Foods, Rawcology Inc., Freeland Foods | Go Raw on making it to our Top 5 Disruptors out of 187 Granola and Muesli brands in the US and North America!! Our category disruptor scoring is a unique measure of a brand’s innovation within a category. It encompasses flavor, ingredients, packaging, nutritional profile, certifications, and application. Over 120 verified attributes go into this score, and these lists are unencumbered by sponsoring or monetization. #CPGdisruptors #innovation #granola #factlisticles If you’re a brand or manufacturer, you can claim your brand on EatQ for free here: https://app.eatq.io/signup This is a great way to discover your brand score and gain valuable insights into your product’s unique added benefits.\n\n📢 𝗔𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱 𝗮𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗰𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁: 𝗪𝗼𝗿𝗹𝗱 𝗣𝗹𝗮𝗻𝘁-𝗕𝗮𝘀𝗲𝗱 𝗜𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗔𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗱𝘀 𝟮𝟬𝟮𝟯 This year’s shortlist for the World #PlantBased #Innovation Awards has been announced and we’re on the list not once, but 2 times!🚀 1. Best Ingredient Innovation💡- for our ‘PerfectaSOL® D 520’ the perfect texturizer for creamy or stretchy plant-based cheese products. For example our stretchy and melting pizza cheese. Neutral taste and white color. 2. Best Ingredient Innovation 💡- for our 'Next Generation potato protein – PerfectaSOL S’. PerfectaSOL® S replaces egg albumen, to give the right binding and bite. The latest version of our chicken nuggets is a great example of this. They are incredibly similar in taste and texture to the real thing. We are thinking further ahead than replicating meat and dairy products perfectly. The functionalities that PerfectaSOL® S provide (both potato protein as well as blends), are also allowing us to experiment with creating stand-alone plant-based consumer products. Thanks to the judges and @foodbevawards for including us in the list! The winners will be announced at Plant Based World Expo North America 2023 in New York. Here’s the full list of nominees 👉 https://shorturl.at/djo16 #Avebe #award #nomination #plantbased #food\n\nWelcome to the first What's Up Wednesday of 2024! Here we go: SYSTM Foods, a joint venture between SYSTM Brands and GroundForce Capital, has acquired Humm Kombucha. SYSTM also operates two other functional beverage acquisitions - REBBL Inc. and Chameleon Coffee. @Boisson has partnered with KeHE Distributors to expand selections in grocers, restaurants, entertainment venues, etc. Boisson is also opening its first Miami location this year, in Merrick Village. Blank Street has launched a subscription program where members pay either $8.99 or $17.99 a week. The cheaper plan covers basic drinks, such as teas, hot brewed coffee, and double espressos. The more expensive option allows members to buy a wider range of beverages, including cold brew. The program has drawn roughly 5,000 paying members — and another 4,000 are on the waitlist. After several years focused primarily on innovating in the food space, Oatly is going back to basics with two new oat milk launches: Unsweetened Oatmilk and Super Basic Oatmilk. Nature's Fynd thinks the public is ready for fungi yogurts. Made from Fy protein the brand's non-dairy yogurts are made from milk based on a fungal strain called Fusarium strain flavolapis. Danone will be selling its premium dairy brands Horizon Organic and Wallaby to investment firm Platinum Equity Purely Elizabeth has created a new product type that adds incremental value to the category by opening up more granola use occasions throughout the day with its new Cookie Granola, available in Chocolate Chip, Oatmeal Raisin, and Double Chocolate flavors. Chobani is debuting Chobani Creations Greek Yogurt, a new line of dessert-inspired snacks. Flavors at launch include mocha tiramisu, apple pie a la mode, cherry cheesecake, orange cream pop, banana foster, and caramel sundae. Perfect Day, formerly known as Muufri, has raised $90 million in a pre-series E financing round. The funding round was led by internal investors.\n\nAfter much anticipation and careful consideration, we're excited to announce a fresh new identity for HerbYvore #plantbased #dairyfree cheese range! 🧀✨ 🌱 Introducing HerbYvore “Just Like Cheddar”, “Just Like Mozzarella” and “Just Like Parme”.🌱 Why the change? We believe that this new name better reflects the essence of our #sustainablynutritious alternative #cheese range. We want to express our deepest gratitude for your continued support on this journey. Your feedback has been invaluable, and that’s why with the name change, we have also made positive refinement to our cheese. So, what’s different now? ✅ We added faba bean protein to our pea protein base, and with this protein blend, we have achieved higher protein in our range to achieve >8% protein per 100g cheese. ✅ With a blend of proteins from #pulses like faba beans and peas, we have diversified protein sources to ensure you get nutrients from more 🌱 ✅ With this protein blend, we have also managed to achieve a more neutral and less beany taste/texture so the natural cheese flavours can be enjoyed. As a #startup it is important to remain agile and work continuously to improve our offerings. Besides the above, we have now grated versions of our cheeses for #foodservice and before the end of Q1, sliced cheeses will become available too. We can’t wait to share our cheeses with you. Contact us if you would like to have samples for your #foodandbeverage establishment today! #sustainability #alternativeproteins #eatwellbewell"
