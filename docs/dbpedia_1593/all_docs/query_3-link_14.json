        "text": "In the last post I talked about how there are so many traditional Portuguese baking products using only a handful of ingredients. Today I‚Äôll focus on one particular ingredient which is so simple and yet so versatile.\n\nEnter ‚Äúrequeij√£o‚Äú, a by-product of cheese making. ‚ÄúRequeij√£o‚Äù is similar to cottage cheese or a mild ricotta and you can find it in several parts of the country, although with slightly different characteristics from one region to the other.\n\nSometimes you‚Äôll find it on the dessert menu, traditionally served with pumpkin jam and a bit of cinnamon (just because we, Portuguese, love cinnamon with everything!). Some other times you can eat cakes and pies made with ‚Äúrequeij√£o‚Äù.\n\nThe gorgeous tanned little cake on the first photo is a traditional ‚Äúqueijada de requeij√£o‚Äù from Alentejo. ‚ÄúQueijada‚Äù can be loosely translated to cheesecake, because it is a cake and it‚Äôs made with cheese, but has nothing to do with the common modern cheesecakes. It‚Äôs delicious and it‚Äôs shaped like a tiny star ‚Äì what‚Äôs not to like about it?\n\nNext we have a few old family recipes* (not mine) but which are completely along the lines of traditional Portuguese baking.\n\nThese cute buns could be on my breakfast table every morning. They‚Äôre not very sweet but they‚Äôre dense and, of course, they are made with ‚Äúrequeij√£o‚Äù. Add a knob of butter and they‚Äôre heaven!\n\nOn the photo above we have, in the front row, a pie with (you guessed it) ‚Äúrequeij√£o. It‚Äôs soft and somewhat delicate, kind of like middle class in the baking hierarchy: sweeter than most traditional cakes but not on the conventual level.\n\nOn the left, in the back row, there‚Äôs a slice of walnut and honey cake. Sweet like a grandmother, it has both honey and yellow sugar in it. On the right, a slice of bread dough cake. This used to be made once a week, when baking bread for the family and it‚Äôs flavoured with cinnamon (I did say we love cinnamon!).\n\nOn the next post we‚Äôll have a very special guest from the Alentejo (a true celebrity of the region, actually)! üòâ\n\nEnjoy!\n\n*I‚Äôd like to thank Cristina Silva, of P√£o, Caf√© & Companhia for helping this blog post come to life by staying true to the original recipes, by having provided me with so many delicious products and for her infinite patience in answering my questions.\n\n‚Äî\n\nYou can follow me on: Facebook ‚Äì Pinterest ‚Äì TripAdvisor ‚Äì Instagram ‚Äì Youtube"
