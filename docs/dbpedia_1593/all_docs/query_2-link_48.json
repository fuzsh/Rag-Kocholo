        "text": "So, the anxiety of going back to college and its sheer demand of documents has left me unhinged... well, more unhinged than usual at least, which is not helped by mild sleep deprivation caused by a national shortage of pericyazine, which also lefts me even more insane due to the fact that it is an antipsychotic - I am also having strange daydreams (I dreamed I had married a South Korean woman and had moved there, where I became obsessed with cooking cheesebread and throwing rice at the fireplace, as well as sleeping on a red fuzzy rug and going to a 12 story shopping mall) that seem to last for months in my head, so my grasp on what's real and what's not is nearly nonexistent, for all that matters, I might not even be posting this.\n\nThat aside, the rest of the post is likely going to have a sh*tfest of crazy going on as well, such as discussing Anna Paquin and her breasts, or wondering why Strawberry Schmier tastes so damn good when coupled with Coconut Streuselkuchen. Also, I am becoming increasingly obsessed with cheesebread and requeijão, as well as the size of Ian McKellen's genitalia and a newfound taste for the word \"serendipity\", which might or might not (let's hope not) also show up in my subsequent lines.\n\nInitial crazy aside, here I go:\n\nThe character I am currently playing uses a portrait from PaintBG which is undoubtedly based on Anna Paquin, the perfect-breasted actress known for her roles as Rogue and Sookie Stackhouse, I even had found the actual picture it was based on, but I lost it, or maybe I hallucinated it in one of those months-long dreams... nevermind, irrelevant.\n\nThe thing is, there are a few ephemeralities I cannot quite decide on, such as who to take with me throughout BG2, which equipment do I use, etc.\n\nSo far breast goddess has alternated between the Club +1/Club +0 and the Staff Spear +2/Aule's Staff, thing is, sooner or later I'll have to decide between them, later being BG2 - both sides have pretty strong arguments: Club of Detonation +3/5 and Blackblood +3 for Clubs; too many spell-casting staves to count, Staff of the Ram +4/6 (best weapon in the game), what do you think of this? - I've restricted Tittehs' selection to Backwhackable weapons, due to the stalker backstabbing ability.\n\nFor armor, Leigh is restricted to Studded Leather and below (completely incapable of wearing other armors, in fact, not just for backstab), I've narrowed down the selection to The Night's Gift +5, Studded Leather of Thorns +6, Aeger's Hide +3 and Grandmaster's Armor +6, each has their own faults and advantages, and due to the fact that the game is extensive, I'll likely be alternating between them, but I'm still torn as to which one I should use for early-to-mid SoA, late SoA and ToB.\n\nBosom will also be capped at 25 Cleric, 21 Stalker, which gives me a total of 0 Thac0, 3 (4 if 25 wis) 7th circle spells and access to both Clerical And Druidic circles, although only clerical HLAs, 2/5/4/4/6 saves, 208 to 228 hit points and 13 pips.\n\nI also have doubts over who I should take along - Melons is running through BG1 with Puff Pastry and Turkish Delight, as should be obvious from the screenshot - but for BG2, I have no idea who I should take nor how many Party Members I should have - I want to complete all of their storylines except for Cigarette Butts (and it shall be even bloodier than he hoped), who I will purge from the face of Faerûn at the first given opportunity. Will likely also romance Turkish Delight, because Rotten Absinthe is bland as hell and Rocky Mountain Oysters is disgusting. Since I am particularly attached to Puff Pastry, Pop-Tart (her cheap knockoff) will probably be dumped as soon as I get her, I also think I'll take Stinky Tofu with me until then, or maybe 'Nips because he is funnier. Pork Brains is useless despite being a large ham, and Whipped Cream is a pissy attention whore; Basils is awesome, but Melons already fits all her roles and much more, so she doesn't make the cut; Lutefisk, Blood Sausage, Rotten Absinthe, Acarajé and Poutine are all evil, so they do not likely belong with her - although Acarajé can be redeemed, so he might be a valid option (also, dual classing him to thief makes him incredibly deadly) - Lettuce and Pudding have just as much personality as their namesakes, plus Lettuce is the single most useless NPC in the game, and Pudding does not even count as a character since he doesn't have any - Cookies is a very good character and a prime candidate for my party, along with Barbecue, but they might be a tad bit overzealous for Melon's tastes - Squab talks like a complete creep and is a bit overrated - and Pepper is just as likely to blast me as the enemies, plus Puff Pastry is already a mage - Rocky Mountain Oysters is a d**kless waste of space.\n\nThoughts, anyone?\n\nFor the record, I'm completely unsure whether this should be off-topic or general discussion, since it actually discusses the game, but in an insane manner.\n\n6"
