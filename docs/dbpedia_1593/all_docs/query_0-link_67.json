        "text": "What is the best cheesecake ever? The one that goes in the oven, and this cream cheese cheesecake is definitely on the top!\n\nIt is one of my favorite desserts, really. I devour cheesecakes as I devour, I don’t know, candies…\n\nI am very critical, I am not convinced by cheesecakes that look more like cream pies and yes, I like a nice American-style cheesecake that goes in the oven.\n\nThat said, this ricotta cheesecake recipe is on the list of the best. And do you know why?\n\nBecause the quality of the cheese counts a lot. And this Lactimonte ricotta is just something!\n\nThis time the recipe is nothing light, fit, or healthy, but once in a while, it’s also good to have a little treat.\n\nAnd now that the holidays are approaching, it really makes you want to prepare these good recipes.\n\nIn fact, as I always say, the secret is balance! There is nothing better than knowing how to balance between healthier and less healthy foods. But of course, without feeling guilty!\n\nBecause we also need sugar once in a while and there is nothing wrong with that.\n\nFor more recipes with Lactimonte cheeses, check out the Tomato Galette with Cottage Cheese. It’s delicious!\n\nHow do you make this Ricotta Cheesecake?\n\nThere are several versions of cheesecake and as I told you, for me, a good cheesecake is the one that goes in the oven: the so-called American cheesecake.\n\nThe texture of the cheese after baking is wonderful. It melts in your mouth!\n\nThis time I made mini cheesecakes in tartlet pans, but you can make them in a regular pan with no problem.\n\nThe ideal way to unmold them without problems is to make the cheesecakes in a mold with a removable bottom.\n\nIf you make these mini ricotta cheesecakes, like me, the pan doesn’t need to be removable because you can even serve the cheesecakes in the pans.\n\nFor this recipe you’ll need:\n\nFor the crust:\n\nMarie biscuits\n\nButter\n\nFor the filling:\n\nLactimonte Ricotta\n\nEggs\n\nLemon\n\nBrown sugar or other of your preference\n\nVanilla extract\n\nWild berries\n\nWhat tricks will ensure that this Ricotta Cheesecake tastes just right:\n\nGrease your molds well, so that the cheesecake will unmold easily.\n\nThe ingredients should all be at room temperature.\n\nCrush the crackers well, so that when mixed with the butter, they form a moldable dough.\n\nDon’t beat the dough too much, so that the cheesecake doesn’t collapse. I do this process by hand, exactly so I don’t tend to overbeat, but you can use a mixer.\n\nAfter baking, leave the cheesecake in the oven to get some consistency. If you take it out right away, it may flap due to temperature differences, since it will not be fully baked.\n\nLet’s check the step-by-step?"
