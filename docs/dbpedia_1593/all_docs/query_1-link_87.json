        "text": "Portugal experienced a 5.3 magnitude earthquake at 5:11 am on the morning of August 26, 2024. The earthquake struck off the coast of Sines and could be felt around the country. Three aftershocks measuring 1.2, 1.1, and .9 on the Richter scale were felt at the time of this writing. National emergency and civil protection commander André Fernandes briefed the Portuguese public at 8:00 am confirming that a 5.3 earthquake did not meet the criteria for activating special plans, which are only activated from a 6.1 magnitude and above. Fernandes also stated that a tsunami warning only gets issued when an earthquake tremor is recorded as 6.0 or higher. No earthquake-related deaths or major damage have been recorded as of the time of this writing, and the government encouraged the Portuguese population to remain calm.\n\nPortugal’s Seismic Activity and Earthquake History\n\nPortugal is located near the boundary between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates, which makes the southern part of the country and the Azores particularly susceptible to seismic activity. Lisbon’s first recorded earthquake in record books occurred in 1344 (no magnitude or damage reported), and 1358 purportedly saw extensive damage to Seville, Spain and Lisbon, Portugal (no magnitude or death records available). In 1531, Lisbon was hit by a 7.7 earthquake and a large tsunami with 30,000 deaths reported. Another smaller earthquake was reported almost to the day twenty years later with 2,000 deaths reported.\n\nThe biggest earthquake to ever hit Lisbon, measured at 8.7-9.0 on the Richter scale, struck on the morning of November 1, 1755. Lisbon was almost completely destroyed by a combination of the earthquake and subsequent fires followed by an 18.3 meter tsunami. Estimated deaths from the disaster totaled between 50,000 and 100,000 people. No massive earthquakes have affected mainland Portugal since this time.\n\nHow to Prepare for an Earthquake in Portugal\n\nThe earthquake in August 26, 2024 was a reminder that an earthquake can truly hit Portugal at any time. When a disaster occurs, it’s important to be ready with a plan for you and your loved ones. Here are some steps that you can follow to prepare for an earthquake in Portugal.\n\nBefore the Earthquake\n\n1. Identify and assess risks in your house.\n\nNote where the risks may be in your house. Bookshelves and TVs are some of the most likely items to tip over during an earthquake. Strap or bolt file cabinets and other top-heavy furniture that can fall and potentially block exits. Also – don’t sleep with tall or heavy objects near your bed. This includes air conditioning units.\n\nConsider installing easy to open locks on your kitchen cabinets to prevent dishes from flying and shattering in the event of an earthquake. Use screw hooks installed directly into wall studs, not just the plaster, and put putty on the back corners of mirrors and picture frames help keep them from banging against the walls and breaking. Secure the top and bottom of your water heater using heavy-duty straps (or get someone to come in and do this for you). Most importantly, check if your appliances are hooked up to gas lines using flexible connectors. If not, ask a plumber to put these in for you.\n\n2. Organize a family emergency plan.\n\nHave the first conversation with your family about what to do in the event of an earthquake. Talk about the importance of staying calm and discuss where you will go in the event of disaster. Make sure that everyone knows the single European emergency telephone number – 112 – available free of charge 24 hours a day. Inform everyone about the location of the emergency earthquake kit (see below). If not everyone knows how to use a fire extinguisher, it may be a good idea to ensure they know how to use it. Discuss what the family will do in the event of disaster.\n\n3. Prepare an emergency kit.\n\nThis is crucial to have on hand in the event of an earthquake and it could very well save your life. Here are the most useful things to have in your house/apartment:\n\nFire extinguisher.\n\nBattery-powered radio to follow emergency broadcasts (with working batteries)\n\nWhistle – which can be used to identify your position\n\nA multipurpose pocketknife\n\nA pair of protective glasses for each family member\n\nN95 face masks for protection from dust in the air\n\nOne pair of gloves for each family member\n\nIsothermal blankets to maintain body temperature\n\nAdequate supplies of medications that you or family members are taking\n\nTools to turn off the gas and water lines in the event of emergency\n\nFirst-aid kit and handbook\n\nFlashlights with extra bulbs and batteries\n\nPortable radio with extra batteries\n\nWater for each family member for at least two weeks (allow at least 1 gallon per person per day) and purification tablets or chlorine bleach to purify drinking water from other sources. Make a habit of storing bottled water in a safe place in your house specifically for this purpose\n\nCanned and package foods, enough for several days and mechanical can opener. Extra food for pets if necessary\n\nWaterproof, heavy-duty plastic bags for waste disposal.\n\nIt is also a good idea to have a good solid pair of shoes and water near your bed in case you are sleeping when the earthquake strikes. Shoes will help you navigate your way safely through the debris. If you live on the second or third floor of a building, you may also want to have rope on hand to assist you with possibly getting to a lower floor.\n\n4. Keep all important documents online\n\nThis includes anything related to fire and earthquake insurance in an accessible place online – in case you lose access to the paper version after the earthquake.\n\nDuring the Earthquake\n\nIf you are at home or in a building, go to a safe place, such as doorways (preferably on main walls), corners of rooms, or under tables or beds. Kneel and protect yourself with your arms around your head. By bending down, we avoid being thrown to the ground. Taking cover protects us from falling objects.\n\nPlease note that fleeing during an earthquake can increase the risk of an accident. Therefore, you should only leave your home or building when it is safe to do so. Then look around to see if there is any danger. When leaving the house, you should wear sneakers or sturdy shoes.\n\nIf you are in an open place, stay away from tall buildings, walls, electricity poles, antennas, and other objects that could collapse or fall. You must bend down or lie down on the floor to avoid an uncontrolled fall. At the same time, protect your head with your arms.\n\nIf you are on the beach or close to the sea, look for a higher location to protect yourself from the risk of tsunamis (giant waves). In some cases of tsunami, waves have reached 30 meters in height.\n\nDon’t escape by car. You can get stuck inside the car and obstruct traffic, hindering rescue efforts.\n\nIf you are driving, stop the car away from buildings, walls, slopes, poles, and high voltage cables, and remain inside it.\n\nThe most dangerous places at home or in a building are near windows, mirrors, chimneys, and walls with shelves, under lamps, in the middle of rooms, elevators, and balconies.\n\nAfter the Earthquake\n\nRemember that it is very important that you remain calm but attentive. After an earthquake, some aftershocks may follow.\n\nDo not rush to the exits if you are in a building, as the stairs may be congested. When going down the stairs, do so leaning against the wall, in an orderly manner, without running or jumping.\n\nBefore leaving, take essential medicines for your heart, tension, diabetes.\n\nNever use the elevator during or after an earthquake, but rather the stairs, as there is a risk of the elevator falling or becoming trapped inside due to a lack of electricity.\n\nThere may be gas leaks, so at home, do not light matches or lighters, and do not turn on switches or cell phones.\n\nImmediately turn off gas, electricity and water. Also teach the children to do it.\n\nBe careful with electrical cables and broken glass.\n\nWear pants, a long-sleeved shirt, and solid shoes to avoid injuries. Release the animals from their cages. If you are on the street, do not return home until it is safe.\n\nIf there are injured people, help them if you have the ability.\n\nRemember, in case of emergency (serious injuries or fire), after taking safety measures, call 112.\n\nTurn on the radio and pay attention to the information broadcast. For more information, check the official documentation from the Portugal Red Cross (Cruz Vermelha).\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nWe hope this gives you a good guide of what to do to prepare for an earthquake in Portugal. It is essential to be prepared and remain calm in the event of emergency. We cannot prevent earthquakes, but we can be informed and aware when they happen and do our best for ourselves and our families in the event of disaster.\n\nI scream, you scream, we all scream for ice cream, but where are the best ice cream shops in Lisbon? We don’t know about you, but we would happily eat ice cream every day of the year. While you may not think of Lisbon as an ice cream city, we are here to change your mind. We’ve got the scoop on the shops with the crunchiest cones, craziest flavors, and sweetest sorbets. When it’s hot outside, we’ve got just the way to keep you cool.\n\n1. Nannarella\n\nLet’s begin with one of the most popular ice cream shops in Lisbon that now has two locations. The original – and the one we recommend – is in São Bento, just down the street from the Assembly of the Republic, the seat of Portugal’s parliament. Choose from flavors of the month such as “Ricotta Cheese with Pear and Walnuts,” “Madeira Banana,” and “Children’s Day Biscuits” or go for the time-tested favorites such as “Pistacchio” and the “Basil Cream.” This may come as a surprise, but the absolute stand-out here is Oreo, which we cannot recommend enough. Gluten-free cones and chocolate-covered cones are also available. The best place to enjoy Nannarella ice cream is in the Jardim da Praça da Constituição de 1976, but make sure to eat it quickly and bring napkins, as the Oreo, in particular, melts really fast!\n\nIf you’re looking for a quick lunch before the ice cream, Nannarella has also opened pizza by the slice next door at La Pizza di Nanna.\n\nOpen: Monday-Saturday, 12:00 pm-12:00 am, Sunday, 12:00 pm – 10:00 pm, Hours may vary by location so double check before you go\n\n2. Davvero\n\nI first discovered Davvero in Lisbon’s Time Out Market and fell in love with their wide variety of flavors. They must be doing something right because they have now expanded to six locations in the greater Lisbon area including Mouraria, Oeiras, and Alfama. Like Nannarella, this is another Italian chain. It is available in four sizes: piccolo, medio, grande, and grandissimo. Try their strawberry cheesecake, passionfruit, or watermelon (seasonal) flavors for a sensational summer treat. If your sweet tooth is steering you more towards the tiramisu or hazelnut brownies, you will not be disappointed.\n\nOpen: Every Day, 10:00 am-12:00 am, Hours may vary by location\n\n3. Bizzarro Gelato\n\nIf you’re looking for something truly unique to Lisbon (created by two Portuguese brothers), Bizzarro Gelato is the perfect place for you. This is like no ice cream shop that you’ve ever seen. In fact, you may not even recognize it as an ice cream shop from the outside. Bizzarro Gelato stands out for its one-of-a-kind flavor combinations including – drum roll please – Cacao and Chili, Caramel and Soy Sauce, and Onion and Mango, to name only a few. Many vegan flavors are available in addition to tasting menus of 6 or 12 flavors. Cones also come in four different flavors: traditional, green apple, raspberry, and vanilla. Hang out in the space-ship-like art gallery and make new friends as you try flavors you’ve never tried before. It’s brilliantly bizzarro!\n\nOpen: Tuesday-Wednesday, 12:00 pm-7:30 pm, Thursday-Sunday, 12:00 pm – 11:00 pm, Closed Mondays\n\n4. Giola Gelato\n\nJust up the street from Nannarella is one of its newest competitors that’s already attracting ice cream lovers in droves. Some people say it’s even better (gasp!). Giola offers a rich variety of flavors crafted with fresh, high-quality ingredients in Praça das Flores, one of the best plazas in the city. The staff at Giola are incredibly friendly and will let you try little tastes of the interesting flavors such as strawberry-mint, lemon with no sugar, and dulce de leche.\n\nOpen: Monday-Tuesday, 2:30 pm-10:30 pm, Wednesday-Sunday, 12:00 pm-12:00 am\n\n5. Santini\n\nWe can’t continue this ice cream article without mentioning Santini, the oldest ice cream parlor in Portugal! As the name might suggest, Santini was founded by an Italian man, Attilio Santini, whose great-grandfather opened the first ice cream shop in Vienna, Austria. Attilio opened his first shop on Tamariz Beach in Estoril in 1949 and fans would come from all over the country to try his original family recipe. After opening his first shop in Lisbon in 1960, Santini perfected the cookie cone recipe that is still used today. Santini sold part of their company in 2009 to local businessmen who have helped expand the number of shops in Portugal. Stepping into Santini is like stepping into history, where they continue to use fresh fruit and natural ingredients with no aromas, dyes, preservatives, or thickeners. They now have over 200 top-secret ice cream recipes, revealed only to their ice cream makers. Be sure to try strawberry, one of their top sellers year after year.\n\nOpen: Every Day, Hours may vary by location\n\n6. Matoli Gelato\n\nOf all the places on our list, Matoli Gelato in Entrecampos has retained one of today’s most coveted status symbols – a five star rating on Google reviews (although there are still less than 250 reviews). The passionate owner Matheus will guide you through your ice cream journey, letting you taste several of their flavors to help you decide. This is essential because the flavors change each week and do not always include the classics that you might expect. Expect high quality at fair prices with unique flavors such as tea-lemon, chocolate berry, and cherry yogurt.\n\nOpen: Every Day, 1:00 pm-8:00 pm\n\n7. Alice\n\nWith three locations around the city, we can safely say that Alice is here to stay. I first discovered it on the beautiful Luís de Camões street in Santo Amaro next to Alcântara, but they also have a nice location just around the corner from Bizzarro Gelato near Praça do Comércio. Alice serves unforgettable creamy flavors with interesting options that you wouldn’t expect. I always return for the Arroz Doce (Sweet Rice) flavor, which is a classic Portuguese dessert, but you may also like Strawberry Kiwi, Apple Pie, or Moscatel Wine and Raisins, to name a few. Alice always offers a relaxing, friendly environment and has nice seating upstairs in its Rua da Madalena location or on the street in Santo Amaro. You can always count on Alice for good ice cream!\n\nOpen: Monday-Wednesday, 1:00 pm-10:30 pm, Thursday-Sunday, 1:00 pm-11:30 pm, Hours may vary by location\n\n8. Insano Gelato e Pizza\n\nThings have finally turned “insano” as we reach No. 8 on our list. While you might think it’s insane to serve both ice cream and pizza at the same location, it’s been going very well for Insano Gelato, whose customers cite it as better than some of the top gelato shops in Italy. Now you really want to try it, right? Despite its small size, it is cozy and serves fresh pizzas and homemade ice cream that will have you coming back for more – even if, like me, you have to travel across town just for another scoop. Trust me, it’s worth it. You’ll find mostly traditional flavors here served in generous portions. Try the pistachio and the mint chocolate chip!\n\nOpen: Thursday-Tuesday, 12:00 pm-10:00 pm, Closed Wednesdays\n\n9. Nivá Cremeria Gelateria Italiana\n\nNivá is another high-quality Italian-style gelateria in Lisbon with locations in Príncipe Real and Alcântara. They serve interesting flavors including salted hazelnut and an açai/banana mix. Like most Italian gelaterias, you also get a free cookie wafer added to the top of your cone to finish off the gelato presentation. The shop in Príncipe Real is a 2-minute walk from Jardim do Príncipe Real, a beautiful place to enjoy your ice cream. There is also a tiny park across from the location in Alcântara and a few tables inside.\n\nOpen: Sunday-Friday, 12:00 pm-12:30 am, Saturday, 11:00 am-12:30 am, Hours may vary by location\n\n10. Amorino Gelato\n\nWith five locations in Greater Lisbon and three of these being right in the heart of Baixa-Chiado, Amorino Gelato is one of the most popular gelato chains in the capital. The reason we have put it so far down the list is because it a French multinational with 250 stores around the world. It’s not exactly unique to Lisbon, but it is a huge success for a reason. Not only does it serve ice cream in the shape of a flower, but even if you order the smallest size, you can get unlimited flavors and even top of your cone with a macaron. When I order a small, I usually stop at three flavors. Amorino Gelato also offers waffles, milkshakes, crêpes, and macarons. Try interesting flavor combinations such as mango + lime, chai latte, and honey-lavender. While the presentation is amazing, you can find richer and creamier gelato at Nannarella or Giola.\n\nOpen: Wednesday-Monday, 10:30 am-12:00 am, Tuesday, 11:00 am – 12:00 am, Hours may vary by location\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nThis list of the 11 best ice cream shops in Lisbon just scratches the surface of what Lisbon has to offer.

Happy ice cream hunting!\n\nGuide to Lisbon\n\n⬇️Please share your favorite ice cream shops in Lisbon in the comments below ⬇️\n\nAfter making up for the existing delays, Luís Montenegro’s team has created a working group to implement the new border control systems.\n\nAccording to the communication published in the Diary of the Republic (Diário da República) this week, the group will be made up of seven members from the Government and other entities, and the work will be coordinated by the Secretary of State for Infrastructure, Hugo Espírito Santo.\n\nThe main reasons for the creation of this group are the implementation of the new Entry-Exit System (EES), which shall become operational from October 6 onwards in most of the 27 Member States of the European Union, and the European Travel Information and Authorization System (ETIAS), which will become operational around six months later.\n\nNote that both systems aim to strengthen European security and monitor the movements of non-European citizens that enter and leave the Schengen area.\n\nIn short, the EES is a new electronic system that will replace the physical stamp on passports when going through passport control. All EU Member States, except Bulgaria, Cyprus, Ireland, and Romania, where passports will continue to be stamped manually, and the four non-Schengen countries (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland), will be part of this new system.\n\nOnce it is operational, travelers who land in another Schengen country will have to have their faces photographed and their fingerprints electronically scanned. However, citizens of the EU or Schengen countries will not be affected and can continue to travel freely throughout the area.\n\nEven though the EES is scheduled to come into force in October, it is not expected to arrive in time to respond to the constraints experienced this year related to the processing of passengers from third states. It is expected that, during the high season (between March 31 and October 26), the number of passengers from third (non-Schengen) states, at Portuguese airports, when compared to last year, will increase by up to 10%.\n\nAccording to the communication, the working group’s progress will be coordinated by the Secretary of State for Infrastructure, who will be responsible for reporting monthly, until April 30, 2025, on the status of the implementation of the systems to the Portuguese Ministries of the Presidency, Internal Administration, and Infrastructure. After that date, the working group will submit a final report to the Government.\n\nThe team will be made up of a representative of the Government responsible for migration, a representative of the Government responsible for internal administration, and a representative of the External Border Control Unit of the Internal Security System. It will also include a representative from AIMA, a representative from the Public Security Police, a representative from the National Republican Guard, and a representative from ANA – Aeroportos de Portugal.\n\nThis topic generated some controversy after the Minister for the Presidency accused the previous Government of being responsible for the delay in meeting the required European deadlines. The Minister even warned that there was a risk of Portugal being suspended from the Schengen area for non-compliance, but an official source from the European Commission guaranteed that such a scenario was not on the table, with the internal security system (SSI) assuring that Portugal has already “recovered the delays” in implementing the security systems in question.\n\nBeyond its castles, beaches, and sunshine, Portugal has more recently emerged as a creative hub for street art, with Lisbon and Porto transformed by talented artists who etch social commentary and everyday scenes onto its walls. These artists bring to life the stories, struggles, and dreams of the Portuguese people. Here are five of the most influential street artists in Portugal, whose works challenge and inspire those who encounter them.\n\n1. Vhils\n\nAlexandre Farto, known in the street art world as Vhils, has gained international recognition for his unique approach to street art, which involves carving into walls rather than painting on them. Growing up in Seixal, a small riverside town in the Lisbon metropolitan area, Vhils was deeply influenced by the rapid urban development that characterized Portugal in the 1980s and 1990s. His fascination with history embedded in the buildings of the cities led him to develop his signature technique using chisels, knives, hammers, and even explosives to break walls, exposing the layers beneath the surface of a city.\n\nBy chiseling away at plaster, concrete, and brick, Vhils reveals poignant portraits that seem to emerge from the very fabric of the city. His work is a powerful commentary on how the built environment absorbs and reflects social changes, capturing the essence of time and memory.\n\nVhils’ art has been celebrated worldwide, with exhibitions in major cultural institutions such as the Center Pompidou in Paris and the Barbican Centre in London. Some of his most notable works include the tribute to Amália Rodrigues, the legendary Fado singer, in Lisbon, where he collaborated with the city’s paving team to create a stunning piece in Portuguese cobblestone. Another significant work is his mural at São João Hospital, which honors the healthcare workers who fought against the COVID-19 pandemic. Vhils’ ability to merge art with social commentary has made him one of the most influential street artists of his generation, and his work continues to provoke and inspire across the globe.\n\n2. Bordalo II\n\nArtur Bordalo, better known as Bordalo II, is a trailblazer in the world of “trash art,” where he transforms discarded materials into stunning and meaningful sculptures. Born in Lisbon in 1987, Bordalo II was deeply influenced by his grandfather, Artur Real Bordalo, a painter. This familial connection to art, combined with his exposure to the environmental degradation caused by urban waste, led Bordalo II to create art that not only dazzles visually but also carries a powerful message about pollution and consumerism. His sculptures, often depicting animals endangered by human activity, are constructed from materials like scrap metal, old tires, and plastic waste—materials that are contributing to the destruction of the very creatures he portrays.\n\nBordalo II’s work is a vivid reminder of the consequences of human consumption. His “Big Trash Animals” series, which can be found in cities across the world, is particularly striking. These larger-than-life creatures, made entirely from urban waste, serve as a haunting reflection of how our throwaway culture is threatening the natural world. In addition to his environmental activism, Bordalo II has been involved in social campaigns, such as supporting refugees through his art. Despite his global success, Bordalo II remains rooted in Lisbon, where he continues to collect discarded materials from the streets to create his next impactful piece. His work is more than art; it’s a call to action for a more sustainable and conscious way of living.\n\n3. Daniel Eime\n\nBorn in 1986, Daniel Eime has carved out a distinctive niche in the street art world with his intricate stencil work, which often features hauntingly beautiful black-and-white portraits. Eime’s journey into the world of art began early, with his passion for drawing leading him to explore various forms of street art as a teenager. Initially involved in graffiti, Eime soon became captivated by the possibilities of stencil art, which he has since mastered and evolved. His work is characterized by a combination of stencil techniques with dripping effects and a touch of realism. He creates portraits that are both striking and emotionally resonant.\n\nEime’s art has been showcased in numerous countries, including England, France, Italy, and Switzerland, where his evocative portraits continue to garner attention. One of his most famous works, “Mira,” is a mural in the Miragaia neighborhood of Porto that depicts a local resident. This piece is a testament to Eime’s ability to capture the essence of his subjects, infusing urban spaces with a sense of intimacy and connection. His work offers a deep exploration of human emotion and identity. As Eime continues to push the boundaries of stencil art, he remains a key figure in the Portuguese street art scene with a growing international reputation.\n\n4. Frederico Draw\n\nFrederico Draw, born in Porto in 1988, is a street artist known for his large-scale murals that focus on the human figure and bodily expression. With a background in architecture, Draw approaches his art with a meticulous eye for detail and a deep understanding of space. He uses spray cans as if they were brushes and carefully crafts realistic portraits that convey powerful emotions and stories. Draw’s work often features anonymous faces and portraits of ordinary people, which he transposes onto urban spaces and imbues with new meaning and life.\n\nOne of Frederico Draw’s most iconic works is the mural of his grandfather near the Luís I Bridge in Porto. This piece, which depicts his grandfather extending a hand in welcome, is a touching tribute to both his family and the city’s spirit of hospitality. Despite its personal nature, the mural has resonated widely with both locals and tourists and become a beloved landmark. As a member of the RUA collective, Draw is actively involved in projects that aim to revitalize urban spaces through art. His work beautifies the city while at the same time creating a dialogue with its inhabitants, making him a central figure in the transformation of Porto’s urban landscape.\n\n5. Mr. Dheo\n\nMr. Dheo, a prominent street artist from Porto, is renowned for his photorealistic graffiti that blends realism with graphic elements. Born in 1985, Mr. Dheo developed his skills at a young age as a self-taught artist. His early exposure to graffiti at the age of fifteen sparked a lifelong passion for street art, and over the years, he has refined his techniques to create highly detailed and lifelike portraits. Mr. Dheo’s work is characterized by its meticulous attention to detail. He often incorporates complex shading and textures that give his pieces a three-dimensional quality.\n\nThroughout his career, Mr. Dheo has created works in over 50 cities around the world, from Miami to Johannesburg, but some of his most iconic pieces can be found in his hometown of Porto. His mural “Angels on Earth,” created during the COVID-19 pandemic in Vila Nova de Gaia, is a powerful tribute to healthcare workers and became a viral sensation, featured in major international publications. Mr. Dheo’s ability to capture the human spirit in his art has earned him a global following, and his work continues to evolve, pushing the boundaries of what street art can achieve. Whether in Porto or abroad, Mr. Dheo’s murals are powerful statements that make a long-lasting impression on the viewer.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nPortugal’s innovative street art scene is constantly evolving, challenging beliefs while also honoring tradition.

The mean daily maximum temperature is only 75.4°F (24.1°C), and it rarely goes beyond 86°F (30°C).

We actually recommend waking up really early one morning and exploring the beaches in Cascais – the atmosphere is serene, the views are breathtaking, and there’s a high chance it will be rather peaceful in the morning.\n\nHowever, if you want to discover more about this area, you have the perfect opportunity until September 14th.

Romans used stone mosaics to pave their roads, a technique that laid the foundation for what would become a defining feature of Portuguese urban landscapes.\n\nIn Portugal, this technique took on a unique character. The first recorded instance of Portuguese pavement was in Lisbon in the mid-19th century, inspired by Roman methods but adapted to local aesthetics and materials.\n\nThe Marquis of Pombal played a pivotal role in the development of Portuguese pavement. After the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, he initiated extensive rebuilding projects, incorporating stone mosaics to enhance the city’s resilience and beauty.\n\nWhat Is Calçada Portuguesa Made Of?\n\nCalçada Portuguesa is characterized by its use of black basalt and white limestone. These stones are meticulously cut and arranged to create intricate patterns, often depicting cultural and historical motifs.\n\nThe first major project using this technique was the paving of Rossio Square in 1848. The success of this project led to the widespread adoption of Portuguese pavement throughout Lisbon and other Portuguese cities.\n\nPortuguese pavement is both functional and a form of artistic expression. Patterns range from simple geometric designs to elaborate representations of ships, animals, and scenes from Portuguese history. Many pavements feature symbols of Portuguese identity, such as the cross of the Order of Christ or maritime motifs reflecting Portugal’s seafaring heritage. These designs serve as a cultural narrative in stone.\n\nPortuguese explorers and colonizers spread the technique worldwide. Today, you can find Portuguese pavement in former colonies like Brazil and Macau, as well as in cities like Paris and New York, where Portuguese communities have left their mark. Crafting these pavements requires skilled artisans known as calceteiros. The process involves laying a sand foundation, placing the stones meticulously, and often embedding them with lime to secure the design.\n\nMaintaining Portuguese pavement is labor-intensive. Over time, stones can become dislodged, and the intricate patterns require constant upkeep to preserve their beauty and functionality. Despite these challenges, Portuguese pavement remains a symbol of national pride. It reflects Portugal’s history, artistic heritage, and the enduring craftsmanship of its people.\n\nShould We Still Use Calçada Portuguesa?\n\nIn modern times, the use of Portuguese pavement has become a topic of debate. While it remains a beloved feature of historical city centers, its practicality in contemporary urban settings is questioned.\n\nOne of the main criticisms is safety. Portuguese pavement can be slippery when wet, posing a hazard to pedestrians. The uneven surface can be challenging for individuals with reduced mobility, making it difficult for wheelchairs and strollers to navigate the streets. Additionally, the uneven surface makes it difficult for people to run or move quickly over these stones.\n\nThe cost of maintaining Portuguese pavement is another issue. The specialized labor required for repairs is expensive, and the stones themselves can be costly to replace. These issues often lead to delays in repairs, making it more likely that someone may injure themselves stepping over the broken stones.\n\nThis raises a critical question: Should Portuguese pavement be preserved at the expense of practicality? In historical areas, it is cherished for its aesthetic and cultural value, but in other parts of the city, modern alternatives might be more suitable. Should calçada portuguesa be removed altogether apart from the main commercial avenues of a city?\n\nSome cities have explored alternative solutions, such as using Portuguese pavement in combination with other, more practical materials. This approach aims to preserve the aesthetic appeal while addressing safety and accessibility concerns.\n\nPublic opinion on this issue is divided. Many people value the historical and cultural significance of Portuguese pavement and advocate for its preservation. Others prioritize safety and functionality, especially in more residential parts of the city.\n\nWhat Is the Future of Calçada Portuguesa?\n\nOne of the primary issues facing Calçada Portuguesa is the decline in new installations and the dwindling number of skilled artisans, known as calceteiros. The profession demands long hours and offers low wages, which has significantly reduced the number of apprentices entering the field. For comparison, in 1927, 400 calceteiros were active in the city of Lisbon. However, in 2020, there are only 18 registered calceteiros, of which only 11 are currently working. Without a new generation of skilled workers to carry on the tradition, the craft is at risk of fading away. This decline is exacerbated by the high cost and difficulty of obtaining suitable stones, making new projects less appealing for both public and private investors.\n\nIn response to these challenges, some cities have already begun replacing traditional Portuguese pavement with more practical materials. For instance, in 2005, Porto replaced much of its city center’s Calçada Portuguesa with granite blocks. Similarly, São Paulo has largely replaced the Portuguese pavement on Paulista Avenue with a more regular and cost-effective type of concrete pavement since 2007. These changes reflect a broader trend towards prioritizing functionality and safety over historical preservation.\n\nDespite these trends, Calçada Portuguesa remains prevalent in certain areas, particularly in more affluent neighborhoods and historical districts. In Rio de Janeiro, for example, the traditional pavement is still widely used, especially in wealthier areas where there is a greater emphasis on maintaining cultural heritage. Additionally, places like the Asunción Super Centro building in Asunción, Paraguay, continue to showcase this iconic pavement, highlighting its enduring appeal in specific contexts.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nCalçada Portuguesa represents a unique blend of artistic expression and cultural heritage, yet faces significant challenges in the modern era. It is already part of Portugal’s Intangible Cultural Heritage. However, its decline is driven by practical concerns like safety, maintenance, and economic viability. With strategic conservation efforts focused on historically significant and aesthetically valuable areas, hopefully, this iconic pavement can still play a role in urban cities. Balancing tradition with modernization will be key to preserving the legacy of Calçada Portuguesa for future generations.\n\nDid you know that Portugal boasts some of the most extraordinary stargazing opportunities in Europe? With its diverse terrain, ranging from towering mountains to remote islands in the Atlantic, Portugal offers a variety of unique locations where the stars shine brightly, far from the light pollution of urban centers.\n\nThe country’s commitment to preserving these dark skies has led to the creation of specific stargazing reserves and a growing interest in astrotourism. In this article, we will explore seven of the best places for stargazing in Portugal, including must-visit spots in Madeira and the Azores. These locations combine the beauty of the natural world with the wonder of the universe.\n\n1. Alqueva Dark Sky Reserve, Alentejo\n\nThe Alqueva Dark Sky Reserve stands out not only for its breathtaking stargazing potential but also for its dedication to dark sky preservation. The region around Lake Alqueva has been meticulously protected from light pollution, which allows visitors to experience the night sky as it was meant to be seen—clear, dark, and filled with stars. The reserve spans over 3,000 square kilometers and encompasses several towns and villages that have embraced this commitment to maintaining pristine night skies.\n\nFurthermore, the Alqueva Dark Sky Reserve is recognized by the Starlight Foundation, which has awarded it with the Starlight Tourism Destination certification.

The combination of professional guidance, high-quality telescopes, and some of the darkest skies in Europe makes Alqueva our top destination in Portugal for anyone interested in exploring the wonders of the universe.\n\n2. Serra da Estrela, Central Portugal\n\nSerra da Estrela is the highest mountain range in mainland Portugal and offers an extraordinary stargazing experience due to its altitude and isolation. The crisp mountain air and lack of light pollution provide an ideal setting for viewing the night sky. Visitors to Serra da Estrela can expect to see a sky teeming with stars, where constellations, planets, and even meteor showers can be observed with remarkable clarity. The range also hosts a network of hiking trails, which during the day, provides stunning views of the surrounding landscape, and by night, become the perfect spots for setting up a telescope or simply lying back to enjoy the celestial display.\n\nBeyond the natural beauty and clear skies, Serra da Estrela is also known for its local culture and traditions. After an evening of stargazing, visitors can sample regional delicacies like Serra da Estrela cheese and relax in cozy mountain lodges. This blend of nature and culture creates a truly memorable visit for anyone looking to explore the stars.\n\n3. Paúl da Serra, Madeira\n\nPaúl da Serra, located on Madeira’s western plateau, is one of the island’s most unique and captivating locations for stargazing. This vast, flat expanse at an altitude of around 1,500 meters offers uninterrupted views of the night sky. Paúl da Serra’s remote location means it is free from the light pollution that affects more populated areas, making it an ideal spot to observe the Milky Way, constellations, and meteor showers. The plateau’s isolation and high elevation provide exceptionally clear skies, often above the cloud cover that can obscure lower areas of the island​.\n\nPaúl da Serra is also known for its unique microclimate, where weather conditions can change rapidly, so keep that in mind. The plateau’s barren yet beautiful landscape, combined with the clarity of the night sky, makes it a perfect location for both amateur astronomers and those simply seeking a quiet place to connect with the cosmos in the middle of the Atlantic.\n\n4. Peneda-Gerês National Park, Northern Portugal\n\nPeneda-Gerês National Park is a place full of natural beauty both day and night. By day, the park is known for its rugged mountains, lush forests, and cascading waterfalls. By night, it transforms into a stargazer’s paradise, where the lack of urban light pollution allows the stars to shine in all their glory. Specific locations within the park, such as Porta do Mezio, are particular favorites for stargazing, offering clear skies that are perfect for catching celestial highlights like meteor showers and the Milky Way.\n\nThe park’s remote location makes it a unique spot for stargazing.

The region’s isolation means there is virtually no light pollution, making the night sky here incredibly dark and perfect for observing galaxies, nebulae, and constellations.\n\nIn addition to its stargazing potential, Serra da Malcata is also known for its rich biodiversity. The area is a protected reserve, home to a variety of wildlife including the Iberian lynx, one of the most endangered species in Europe. This makes a stargazing trip to Serra da Malcata a unique opportunity to have a truly meditative experience with nature that is perfect for those looking to escape the hustle and bustle of modern life.\n\n6. Fanal, Madeira\n\nFanal, a mystical laurel forest located in northwest Madeira, is one of the island’s most enchanting spots for stargazing. The ancient trees, often shrouded in mist during the day, clear up at night to reveal a dark, star-filled sky. The unique setting of twisted laurel trees against the backdrop of the Milky Way creates a surreal and unforgettable experience. Fanal is less accessible than Paúl da Serra, requiring a bit of a trek, but the journey is well worth it for the serene and otherworldly stargazing opportunities it offers.\n\nVisiting Fanal is like stepping into another world. The forest, which is part of the UNESCO Laurisilva of Madeira, is a type of laurel forest that once covered much of Southern Europe. At night, this ancient landscape takes on an ethereal quality. For those who enjoy photography, Fanal offers a unique opportunity to capture stunning images of the Milky Way framed by these iconic trees. The combination of natural beauty and dark skies makes Fanal a must-visit destination for anyone passionate about stargazing.\n\n7. Montanha do Pico, Azores\n\nIn the Azores, Montanha do Pico on Pico Island is an unrivaled stargazing destination. As the highest peak in Portugal, standing at 2,351 meters, it offers an extraordinary vantage point for observing the night sky. The mountain’s isolation in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean means there is virtually no light pollution, making the stars appear incredibly bright and close. The site is also a favorite for astrophotographers, who come to capture stunning images of the Milky Way and other celestial phenomena. Hiking up Montanha do Pico to watch the stars is a challenging but rewarding adventure for any stargazing enthusiast.\n\nThe ascent to the summit of Montanha do Pico is an experience in itself. Hikers often start their journey in the late afternoon to reach the summit by sunset, setting up camp for a night in the crater under the stars. The effort is well worth it, as the clear skies offer an unrivaled view of the cosmos.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nPortugal’s varied landscapes provide an abundance of opportunities for stargazing, from the mountains of Madeira to the volcanic peaks of the Azores and the vast plains of Alentejo. With its clear skies and minimal light pollution, Portugal is truly a haven for those who wish to connect with the universe.\n\nIt has been busy at the Portuguese Association of Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies (APBC). “We must have thousands of emails with fraud complaints and requests for information,” said Fred Antunes, founder of the APBC and the president of its General Assembly. But this is just the visible tip of the crypto iceberg. The iceberg below the surface reveals that fraud and cryptocurrency misplacement complaints already exceed 25 million euros in total. There’s talk of a case leading to a 6 million euro loss. At the National Unit for Combating Cybercrime and Technological Crime of the Judicial Police (UNC3T), the numbers are alarming: “From 2022 until now, around 3,000 inquiries related to crypto assets have been opened,” says Carlos Cabreiro, UNC3T’s director.\n\nThe cryptocurrency circuit has had a recent surge in losses and fraud. According to Fred Antunes, “It can all start with a phone call attempting to solicit investments in cryptocurrencies allegedly promoted by a celebrity.” These callers exhibit a level of professionalism comparable to those selling new telecommunications contracts, but the goal remains the same: investment in cryptocurrencies through exchanges or brokers that may not even exist. Additionally, there is misleading advertising spread through social networks, television and radio channels, and newspapers.\n\nFor your information, here are the most common types of fraud:\n\nFake platforms: These proliferate with ads that use images of celebrities without their knowledge or consent. Once investments are made, they present charts with gains that don’t correspond to reality to encourage further investments. Generally, withdrawal requests are followed by a hefty fee, which serves as the last part of the theft. The likelihood of a refund is slim, and even if there is a refund, the fee is lost.\n\nCredential theft: This involves malicious codes that infect computers and phones or alerts via email, SMS, WhatsApp, or phone from fake cybersecurity experts who, in reality, are cybercriminals seeking access to cryptocurrency wallet credentials.\n\nUnprofitable crypto: Cryptocurrencies proliferated in the past decade (in Portugal, the crypto escudo was possibly the first). They can vary with supply and demand, but they are not supervised. Some cryptocurrencies, while not illegal, lose value, but there are also cryptocurrencies created solely to divert money with a worthless product.\n\nA factor that makes these cases particularly troubling is that many people do not understand how crypto assets work and/or are simply willing to invest all their savings when confronted with promises of extraordinary returns. In these scenarios, nothing prevents someone from posing as a broker or exchange agent and contacting consumers from the other side of the globe with supposed financial applications that promise extraordinary returns, which are specifically designed to encourage victims to invest more.\n\n“Fake crypto asset investment platforms have mushroomed in Europe and around the world,” confirms Cláudia Pina, a Portuguese judge working as a seconded expert at Eurojust.\n\nAt the Bank of Portugal, requests for information and clarification have increased in priority. The Bank provides a page identifying companies registered to operate in Portugal and also recommends consulting the CMVM (Securities Market Commission) to verify the credibility of intermediaries that advertise different services on the web. However, between 2022 and today, the Bank of Portugal has opened more than 100 investigations into entities operating irregularly in Portugal. Most were referred to the Public Prosecutor’s Office, according to Bank officials. These cases include reinventions of the famous Ponzi schemes, but there are also investments that were never made or were directed towards non-existent currencies.\n\nAs cryptocurrencies have become part of routine investment strategies, some crypto fortunes have been made but also many fortunes have been lost in the form of bankruptcy – something that would be impossible without blockchain technology. The visibility it provides enhances trust but does not guarantee security. It is possible to track which machines contribute to each process, but there’s a catch. According to Cláudia Pina, “Even if you can identify which transaction was made, there is no guarantee that the individuals who conducted the transactions can be identified.”\n\nTo complicate matters, cybercriminals use mixers and tumblers that function as convenient exchange houses to convert a certain amount into different cryptocurrencies. According to Nuno Serdoura, a prosecutor at the Public Prosecutor’s Office, Portuguese authorities lack training and tools for automated cryptocurrency transaction tracking. Carlos Cabreiro denies such a thing, although he admits that the “abnormal case boom of the last two years” led to the creation of a specialized group for investigating crypto assets within UNC3T.\n\nNote that there has also been encouragement for the establishment of groups to investigate crypto assets in different departments of the Judiciary Police, and in parallel, training has been provided to more than 120 professionals with accredited platforms for exchanging and making transactions with different cryptocurrencies, such as Binance or Coinbase, or authorities such as Europol, the FBI, or American intelligence services.\n\nConsidering the number and context of these alarming cases, there is at least one good piece of news on the horizon: the European Regulation on Crypto Asset Markets (MiCA) is expected to come into force at the end of the year. Even though it only expressively legislates stablecoins, it is the first step towards further legislation of crypto."
