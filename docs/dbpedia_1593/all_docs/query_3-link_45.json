You will love the chewy bread and cheesy center.\n\nFeatured with this recipe\n\nWhat is Pao de Queijo?\n\nGetting the Right Ingredients\n\nTwo Easy Methods to Make Brazilian Cheese Bread\n\nTips for Making Brazilian Cheese Bread\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nMore Roll Recipes\n\nHow to Make Brazilian Cheese Bread (Pao de Queijo)\n\nBrazilian Cheese Bread (Pao de Queijo) Recipe\n\nThis Pao De Queijo recipe, or Brazilian Cheese Bread, is the stuff dreams are made of! I originally discovered it at a restaurant called Tucanos Brazilian Grill in Utah. Every time I go there, I seriously have to try to limit myself to only a few of these little cheese rolls or I will completely go to town on them. They are so good! If you haven’t had these rolls before, now is the time! Oh, and did I mention they are GLUTEN FREE?! So this one is for all of my gluten-free friends out there!\n\nWhat is Pao de Queijo?\n\nPao de Queijo (pronounced “pow duh kay-ju”), literally translates to “cheese bread” in Portuguese. These small, round, baked cheese rolls are a popular snack and breakfast food in Brazil. And even though it’s called “bread”, the dough doesn’t use yeast (hence, gluten-free!). These cheese rolls are actually really easy and fun to make, and even more fun to eat!\n\nGetting the Right Ingredients\n\nThe ingredients used to make this Pao de Queijo recipe are very simple, such as oil, milk, eggs, and salt. The two key ingredients here are the flour and the cheese:\n\nTapioca Flour (or Tapioca Starch) – Tapioca flour is the key ingredient in Brazilian cheese bread. It is the main binding agent for the pão de queijo. Be sure to use tapioca flour or starch specifically, as other flours won’t yield the same results. Two main types of tapioca flour are used in Pao de Queijo: sour tapioca flour (polvilho azedo), which provides a tangy flavor and chewy texture, and sweet tapioca flour (polvilho doce), which has a neutral taste. Both types are gluten-free and contribute to the unique characteristics of Brazilian cheese bread.\n\nCheese – any kind of shredded cheese will work. While queijo Minas (Minas cheese) is traditional, it isn’t easily found in the States. Other cheeses like cheddar, parmesan (parmigiano reggiano), mozzarella, or a mix of cheeses work well. My favorite, hands-down, is a combination of sharp cheddar cheese and parmigiano reggiano. That way you get the smoothness of the cheddar and also the bold flavor of the parmesan. Grate the cheeses finely to ensure even distribution throughout the dough.\n\nTwo Easy Methods to Make Brazilian Cheese Bread\n\n1. The Authentic Way – The first way is the more “authentic” way to make them. There is a little more technique and skill involved. This is the way as described in the recipe below.\n\n2. The Blender Method – This is the best way to make Brazilian cheese bread if you are in a hurry or simply want to make things easier on yourself. I honestly can’t tell much a difference between the two methods. I am all about ease and usually find myself putting it all in a blender more often than not. Here’s what you do:\n\nPreheat oven to 400-degrees\n\nPut all the ingredients except the cheese in a blender.\n\nBlend until smooth (about 20 seconds) then scrape the sides of the blender.\n\nAdd cheese and pulse 3-4 times to incorporate.\n\nSpray a mini muffin pan with cooking spray and fill each cup with the cheese mixture until almost full.\n\nPlace in the oven and bake 15-20 minutes or until the outside of the rolls are golden brown and puffed up. Do not over bake! The texture on the outside is more dry and “bread” like and the inside is more soft and chewy.\n\nTips for Making Brazilian Cheese Bread\n\nWhen it comes to making Brazilian cheese bread, here are some helpful tips to ensure delicious results:\n\nQuality Ingredients: Use high-quality ingredients, especially cheese and tapioca flour. Freshly grated cheese will enhance the flavor and texture of your cheese bread.\n\nProper Mixing: When combining the ingredients, mix the dough thoroughly to ensure all the ingredients are well incorporated. You can use a blender or mixer to get the right consistency.\n\nConsistent Dough Balls: Use a cookie scoop to get consistent balls. If using the blender method, you can use a mini muffin tin to get them all the same size.\n\nUse Parchment Paper: This prevents sticking and makes for easier cleanup.\n\nBaking Time: Keep a close eye on the cheese bread while baking, as the baking time can vary depending on the size of the bread. Generally, it takes around 20-25 minutes, or until the bread develops a golden color and puffs up.\n\nEnjoy Fresh: Brazilian cheese bread is best enjoyed fresh from the oven when it’s still warm and at its peak texture.\n\nFreezing Options: If you have leftovers, you can freeze the unbaked cheese bread dough balls and bake them straight from the freezer whenever you crave a fresh batch (like the popular Brazilian Bites). Simply adjust the baking time accordingly.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nREAD MORE: 35+Quick and Easy to Follow Dinner Ideas\n\nMore Roll Recipes\n\nIn our family, a dinner is truly not complete without a side of bread or rolls.
