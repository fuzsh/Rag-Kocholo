        "text": "Ages ago I made a brief reference to the Brazilian culinary delight, ‘pão de queijo’, or ‘cheese bread’, in a post about pronunciation.\n\nI would say it’s pronounced, more or less, “PUWNG jee KAY-zhoo”, but watch out for the “puwng” as you could end up inadvertently asking for something different. Whatever way you say it, it’s not “pow”. See ‘Brazilian Portuguese: Pronunciation Tips for Beginners’ for why.\n\nPronunciation aside, pão de queijo deserves a blog post in its own right since it’s a very popular savoury snack among Brazilians, and to be in Brazil and not know what it is a blunder akin to not knowing what açaí is or never having tried a caipirinha.\n\nBut you can’t spend long in Brazil without stumbling upon some pão de queijo at some point – it’s sold all over the place: restaurants; cafés; street stalls; snack bars in bus stations and airports; beach ‘quiosques’ (‘kiosks’ – pronounced “ki-OS-kis”, haha!); supermarkets… Basically it’s everywhere.\n\nThe popular chain, ‘Casa do Pão de Queijo’, can be spotted in all major cities and many smaller ones, though in my personal opinion pão de queijo is just as delightful at other establishments and often significantly cheaper.\n\nThe usual pão de queijo is simply a mini, round bread roll – around 4-5 cm in diameter – made with cassava or tapioca flour with tasty cheese inside, and it is especially delicious when still warm as the cheese inside is nice and chewy. The type of cheese varies but is usually very mild, often with parmesan or “requeijão” (pronounced, more or less: ‘heh-keh-ZHAOWNG’, or somesuch that’s hard to write phonetically), which is sort of a cross between spreadable butter and cream cheese. However, being British, I prefer to have pão de queijo with cheddar, as offered on the ‘Casa do Pão de Queijo’ menu.\n\nAlthough I described pão de queijo as a savoury snack it’s possible to chow down on a tasty sweet version too – with one of my favourite sweet treats: doce de leite (pronounced, more or less: “DO-say jee LAY-chee”) – milk sweetened with sugar, boiled until concentrated into a creamy spread or into something resembling fudge.\n\nYum.\n\nFor the adventurous among you – or those that have more culinary skills than me (which will be most of you) – you can try to make them yourself at home.\n\nCheck out these websites for recipes:\n\nhttp://www.simplyrecipes.com/recipes/easy_brazilian_cheese_bread/\n\nhttp://www.epicurious.com/recipes/member/views/PAO-DE-QUEIJO-AKA-BRAZILIAN-CHEESE-PUFFS-1266023\n\nOne of these delicious little snacks is by no means enough, so usually you will order 5, or 8, or 12, or however it’s offered at your establishment of choice.\n\nPão de queijo: Great as a snack and great for sharing. Just great in general.\n\nEnjoy! 🙂"
