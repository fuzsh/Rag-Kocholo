Sodium borohydride and aminoborane are two materials given consideration as chemical hydrogen storage materials by the US Department of Energy. A very significant barrier to adoption of these materials as hydrogen carriers is their regeneration from \"spent fuel,\" i.e., the material remaining after discharge of hydrogen. In this thesis, some research directed at regeneration of sodium borohydride and aminoborane is described. For sodium borohydride, electrochemical reduction of boric acid and sodium metaborate (representing spent fuel) in alkaline, aqueous solution has been investigated. Similarly to literature reports (primarily patents), a variety of cathode materials were tried in these experiments. Additionally, approaches directed at overcoming electrostatic repulsion of borate anion from the cathode, not described in the previous literature for electrochemical reduction of spent fuels, have been attempted. A quantitative analytical method for measuring the concentration of sodium borohydride in alkaline aqueous solution has been developed as part of this work and is described herein. Finally, findings from stability tests for sodium borohydride in aqueous solutions of several different compositions are reported. For aminoborane, other research institutes have developed regeneration schemes involving tributyltin hydride. In this thesis, electrochemical reduction experiments attempting to regenerate tributyltin hydride from tributyltin chloride (a representative by-product of the regeneration scheme) are described. These experiments were performed in the non-aqueous solvents acetonitrile and 1,2-dimethoxyethane. A non-aqueous reference electrode for electrolysis experiments in acetonitrile was developed and is described.\n\nSodium Borohydride/Hydrogen Peroxide Fuel Cells For Space Application\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nValdez, T. I.; Deelo, M. E.; Narayanan, S. R.\n\n2006-01-01\n\nThis viewgraph presentation examines Sodium Borohydride and Hydrogen Peroxide Fuel Cells as they are applied to space applications. The topics include: 1) Motivation; 2) The Sodium Borohydride Fuel Cell; 3) Sodium Borohydride Fuel Cell Test Stands; 4) Fuel Cell Comparisons; 5) MEA Performance; 6) Anode Polarization; and 7) Electrode Analysis. The benefits of hydrogen peroxide as an oxidant and benefits of sodium borohydride as a fuel are also addressed.\n\nOn the purity assessment of solid sodium borohydride\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nBotasini, Santiago; MÃ©ndez, Eduardo\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSince sodium borohydride has become extensively used as chemical hydrogen storage material in fuel cells, many techniques have been proposed to assess the purity of this substance. However, all of them are developed in aqueous media, where the reagent is unstable. In addition, its hygroscopic nature was difficults in any attempt to make precise quantifications. The present work compares three different methods, namely, voltammetric, titrimetric, and Fourier transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) in order to assess the purity of sodium borohydride, using an expired and a new sodium borohydride samples as references. Our results show that only the FTIR measurements provide a simple and semi-quantitative means to assess the purity of sodium borohydride due to the fact that it is the only one that measures the sample in the solid state. A comparison between the experimental data and theoretical calculation reveals the identification of the absorption bands at 1437 cm-1 of sodium metaborate and 2291 cm-1 of sodium borohydride which represent a good fingerprint for the qualitative assessment of the sample quality.\n\nThe Discovery-Oriented Approach to Organic Chemistry. 6.

The micro-disperse particles can have a substantially uniform diameter of 1-10 microns, and preferably about 3-5 microns. Ruthenium or cobalt catalytic nanoparticles can be incorporated in the micro-disperse particles of sodium borohydride, which allows a rapid and complete reaction to occur without the problems associated with caking and scaling of the surface by the reactant product sodium metaborate. A closed loop water management system can be used to recycle wastewater from a PEM fuel cell to supply water for reacting with the micro-disperse particles of sodium borohydride in a compact hydrogen gas generator. Capillary forces can wick water from a water reservoir into a packed bed of micro-disperse fuel particles, eliminating the need for using an active pump.\n\nChiral Compounds and Green Chemistry in Undergraduate Organic Laboratories: Reduction of a Ketone by Sodium Borohydride and Baker's Yeast\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nPohl, Nicola; Clague, Allen; Schwarz, Kimberly\n\n2002-06-01\n\nWe describe an integrated set of experiments for the undergraduate organic laboratory that allows students to compare and contrast biological and chemical means of introducing chirality into a molecule. The racemic reduction of ethyl acetoacetate with sodium borohydride and the same reduction in the presence of a tartaric acid ligand are described, and a capillary gas chromatography column packed with a chiral material for product analysis is introduced. The results of these two hydride reactions are compared with the results of a common undergraduate experiment, the baker's yeast reduction of ethyl acetoacetate.\n\nMethod of Manufacturing Micro-Disperse Particles of Sodium Borohydride\n\nDOEpatents\n\nKravitz, Stanley H.; Hecht, Andrew M.; Sylwester.

The Ni-B amorphous nanoparticles were synthesized from aqueous reduction of NiSO4 by sodium borohydride in microscale interface at room temperature. The size, morphology, elemental compositions, and the chemical composition on the surface of Ni-B amorphous nanoparticles were characterized by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). All the results showed that the synthesized particles are Ni-B amorphous nanoparticles with uniform in size distribution and having good dispersion. The mean particle diameter of Ni-B amorphous nanoparticles was around 9 nm. The present work provides an alternative synthesis route for the Ni-B amorphous nanoparticles.\n\nUnderstanding oscillatory phenomena in molecular hydrogen generation via sodium borohydride hydrolysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBudroni, M A; Biosa, E; Garroni, S; Mulas, G R C; Marchettini, N; Culeddu, N; Rustici, M\n\n2013-11-14\n\nThe hydrolysis of borohydride salts represents one of the most promising processes for the generation of high purity molecular hydrogen under mild conditions. In this work we show that the sodium borohydride hydrolysis exhibits a fingerprinting periodic oscillatory transient in the hydrogen flow over a wide range of experimental conditions. We disproved the possibility that flow oscillations are driven by supersaturation phenomena of gaseous bubbles in the reactive mixture or by a nonlinear thermal feedback according to a thermokinetic model. Our experimental results indicate that the NaBH4 hydrolysis is a spontaneous inorganic oscillator, in which the hydrogen flow oscillations are coupled to an \"oscillophor\" in the reactive solution. The discovery of this original oscillator paves the way for a new class of chemical oscillators, with fundamental implications not only for testing the general theory on oscillations, but also with a view to chemical control of borohydride systems used as a source of hydrogen based green fuel.\n\nThe Removal of Cu (II) from Aqueous Solution using Sodium Borohydride as a Reducing Agent\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSithole, N. T.; Ntuli, F.; Mashifana, T.\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe removal and recovery of metals from wastewater has been a subject of significant importance due the negative impact these toxic metals have on human health and the environment as a result of water and soil pollution. Increased use of the metals and chemicals in the process industries has resulted in generation of large quantity of effluents that contains high level of toxic metals and other pollutants. The objective of this work was to recover of Cu in its elemental form as metallic powder from aqueous solution using NaBH4 as a reducing agent. Reductive precipitation was achieved in a batch reactor at 65Â°C using Cu powder as a seeding material. This study also investigated the effect of concentration of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) as a reducing agent. The amount of NaBH4 was varied based on mole ratios which are 1:1, 1:0.25 and 1:0.1 to recover Cu from synthetic wastewater. The results obtained showed that sodium borohydride is an effective reducing agent to recover Cu from wastewater. The optimum concentration of NaBH4 that gives the best results the 1:1 molar ratio with over 99% Cu removal.\n\nVolcano Plot for Bimetallic Catalysts in Hydrogen Generation by Hydrolysis of Sodium Borohydride\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKoska, Anais; Toshikj, Nikola; Hoett, Sandra; Bernaud, Laurent; Demirci, Umit B.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIn the field of \"hydrogen energy\", sodium borohydride (NaBH[subscript 4]) is a potential hydrogen carrier able to release H[subscript 2] by hydrolysis in the presence of a metal catalyst.

P.; Liu, B. H.; Liu, F. F.; Xu, D.\n\nTo develop a hydrogen source for underwater applications, a composite of sodium borohydride and super absorbent polymer (SAP) is prepared by ball milling sodium borohydride powder with SAP powder, and by dehydrating an alkaline borohydride gel. When sodium polyacrylate (NaPAA) is used as the SAP, the resulting composite exhibits a high rate of borohydride hydrolysis for hydrogen generation. A mechanism of hydrogen evolution from the NaBH 4-NaPAA composite is suggested based on structure analysis by X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. The effects of water and NiCl 2 content in the precursor solution on the hydrogen evolution behavior are investigated and discussed.\n\nBy-Product Carrying Humidified Hydrogen: An Underestimated Issue in the Hydrolysis of Sodium Borohydride.\n\nPubMed\n\nPetit, Eddy; Miele, Philippe; Demirci, Umit B\n\n2016-07-21\n\nCatalyzed hydrolysis of sodium borohydride generates up to four molecules of hydrogen, but contrary to what has been reported so far, the humidified evolved gas is not pure hydrogen. Elemental and spectroscopic analyses show, for the first time, that borate by-products pollute the stream as well as the vessel. Â© 2016 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

L.\n\nIn this preliminary study, we tried to use sodium polyacrylate as the super absorbent polymer to form alkaline NaBH 4 gel and explored its possibilities for borohydride hydrolysis and borohydride electro-oxidation. It was found that the absorption capacity of sodium polyacrylate decreased with increasing NaBH 4 concentration. The formed gel was rather stable in the sealed vessel but tended to slowly decompose in open air. Hydrogen generation from the gel was carried out using CoCl 2 catalyst precursor solutions. Hydrogen generation rate from the alkaline NaBH 4 gel was found to be higher and impurities in hydrogen were less than that from the alkaline NaBH 4 solution. The NaBH 4 gel also successfully powered a NaBH 4-air battery.\n\nCharacterization of radiation damage to DNA by reaction with borohydride.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSchellenberg, K A; Shaeffer, J; Nichols, R K; Gates, D\n\n1981-01-01\n\nIrradiation of aqueous solutions of native calf thymus DNA with x-rays produced functional groups that reacted with sodium borohydride. The DNA was labeled with tritium from NaB3H4 to the extent of 2.0 x 10(-10) atom/dalton/rad. The presence of cysteamine or other radical scavengers, or saturation of the solution with nitrogen during irradiation decreased the labeling. After mild acid hydrolysis, the major tritium-containing moiety was identical with 2,3-dihydroxy-2-methylpropanoic acid in all chromatographic systems tested. The suggested mechanism of labeling involved reduction by borohydride of the potential aldehyde at carbon 6 of thymine glycol residues present in the irradiated DNA.

Comparison of the results with those obtained from a series of model quinones and hydroquinones demonstrates that these spectral changes cannot be assigned directly to the absorption and emission of visible light by quinones/hydroquinones. Instead, these results are consistent with a charge transfer model in which the visible absorption is due primarily to charge transfer transitions arising among hydroxy- (methoxy-) aromatic donors and carbonyl-containing acceptors. Unlike most of the model hydroquinones, the changes in optical properties of the natural samples following NaBH(4) reduction were largely irreversible in the presence of air and following addition of a Cu(2+) catalyst, providing tentative evidence that aromatic ketones (or other similar carbonyl-containing structures) may play a more important role than quinones in the optical properties of these materials.\n\nUltrahigh figure-of-merit for hydrogen generation from sodium borohydride using ternary metal catalysts\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHu, Lunghao; Ceccato, R.; Raj, R.\n\nWe report further increase in the figure-of-merit (FOM) for hydrogen generation from NaBH 4 than reported in an earlier paper [1], where a sub-nanometer layer of metal catalysts are deposited on carbon nanotube paper (CNT paper) that has been functionalized with polymer-derived silicon carbonitride (SiCN) ceramic film. Ternary, Ru-Pd-Pt, instead of the binary Pd-Pt catalyst used earlier, together with a thinner CNT paper is shown to increase the figure-of-merit by up to a factor of six, putting is above any other known catalyst for hydrogen generation from NaBH 4. The catalysts are prepared by first impregnating the functionalized CNT-paper with solutions of the metal salts, followed by reduction in a sodium borohydride solution. The reaction mechanism and the catalyst efficiency are described in terms of an electric charge transfer, whereby the negative charge on the BH 4 - ion is exchanged with hydrogen via the electronically conducting SiCN/CNT substrate [1].\n\nThe Concept about the Regeneration of Spent Borohydrides and Used Catalysts from Green Electricity\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLiu, Cheng-Hong; Chen, Bing-Hung\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCurrently, the Brown-Schlesinger process is still regarded as the most common and mature method for the commercial production of sodium borohydride (NaBH4). However, the metallic sodium, currently produced from the electrolysis of molten NaCl that is mass-produced by evaporation of seawater or brine, is probably the most costly raw material. Recently, several reports have demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing green electricity such as offshore wind power to produce metallic sodium through electrolysis of seawater. Based on this concept, we have made improvements and modified our previously proposed life cycle of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and ammonia borane (NH3BH3), in order to further reduce costs in the conventional Brown-Schlesinger process. In summary, the revision in the concept combining the regeneration of the spent borohydrides and the used catalysts with the green electricity is reflected in (1) that metallic sodium could be produced from NaCl of high purity obtained from the conversion of the byproduct in the synthesis of NH3BH3 to devoid the complicated purification procedures if produced from seawater; and (2) that the recycling and the regeneration processes of the spent NaBH4 and NH3BH3 as well as the used catalysts could be simultaneously carried out and combined with the proposed life cycle of borohydrides.\n\nSynthesis, structure and properties of bimetallic sodium rare-earth (RE) borohydrides, NaRE(BH4)4, RE = Ce, Pr, Er or Gd.\n\nPubMed\n\nPayandeh GharibDoust, SeyedHosein; RavnsbÃ¦k, Dorthe B; ÄernÃ½, Radovan; Jensen, Torben R\n\n2017-10-10\n\nFormation, stability and properties of new metal borohydrides within RE(BH 4 ) 3 -NaBH 4 , RE = Ce, Pr, Er or Gd is investigated. Three new bimetallic sodium rare-earth borohydrides, NaCe(BH 4 ) 4 , NaPr(BH 4 ) 4 and NaEr(BH 4 ) 4 are formed based on an addition reaction between NaBH 4 and halide free rare-earth metal borohydrides RE(BH 4 ) 3 , RE = Ce, Pr, Er. All the new compounds crystallize in the orthorhombic crystal system. NaCe(BH 4 ) 4 has unit cell parameters of a = 6.8028(5), b = 17.5181(13), c = 7.2841(5) Ã and space group Pbcn. NaPr(BH 4 ) 4 is isostructural to NaCe(BH 4 ) 4 with unit cell parameters of a = 6.7617(2), b = 17.4678(7), c = 7.2522(3) Ã . NaEr(BH 4 ) 4 crystallizes in space group Cmcm with unit cell parameters of a = 8.5379(2), b = 12.1570(4), c = 9.1652(3) Ã . The structural relationships, also to the known RE(BH 4 ) 3 , are discussed in detail and related to the stability and synthesis conditions. Heat treatment of NaBH 4 -Gd(BH 4 ) 3 mixture forms an unstable amorphous phase, which decomposes after one day at RT. NaCe(BH 4 ) 4 and NaPr(BH 4 ) 4 show reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 1.65 and 1.04 wt% in the fourth H 2 release, whereas that of NaEr(BH 4 ) 4 continuously decreases. This is mainly assigned to formation of metal hydrides and possibly slower formation of sodium borohydride. The dehydrogenated state clearly contains rare-earth metal borides, which stabilize boron in the dehydrogenated state.\n\nDevelopment of an on-board H2 storage and recovery system based on lithium borohydride.\n\nDOT National Transportation Integrated Search\n\n2014-02-28\n\nAlkali metal borohydrides based on sodium and lithium, NaBH4 and LiBH4, have been evaluated as a potential hydrogen storage and recovery system for on-board vehicle use.

Here we report a new paradigm using natural polymer (guar gum, GG) and sodium borohydride (NaBH4), for the preparation of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs)-containing smart hydrogels in a simple, fast and economical way. NaBH4 performs as a reducing agent for AgNPs synthesis using silver nitrate (AgNO3) as the precursor. Meanwhile, sodium metaborate (NaBO2) (from NaBH4) behaves as a cross-linking agent between GG molecular chains. The AgNPs/GG hydrogels with excellent viscoelastic properties can be obtained within 3âmin at room temperature without the addition of other cross-linkers. The resultant AgNPs/GG hydrogels are flowable and injectable, and they possess excellent pH/thermal responsive properties. Additionally, they exhibit rapid self-healing capacity. This work introduces a facile and scale-up way to prepare a class of hydrogels that can have great potential to biomedical and other industrial applications.

Z.; Liu, J. W.; Yao, X. D.; Wang, H.; Liu, Z. W.; Zhu, M.\n\n2017-08-01\n\nSodium borohydride (NaBH4) hydrolysis is a promising approach for hydrogen generation, but it is limited by high costs, low efficiency of recycling the by-product, and a lack of effective gravimetric storage methods. Here we demonstrate the regeneration of NaBH4 by ball milling the by-product, NaBO2Â·2H2O or NaBO2Â·4H2O, with MgH2 at room temperature and atmospheric pressure without any further post-treatment. Record yields of NaBH4 at 90.0% for NaBO2Â·2H2O and 88.3% for NaBO2Â·4H2O are achieved. This process also produces hydrogen from the splitting of coordinate water in hydrated sodium metaborate. This compensates the need for extra hydrogen for generating MgH2. Accordingly, we conclude that our unique approach realizes an efficient and cost-effective closed loop system for hydrogen production and storage.\n\nAqueous sodium borohydride induced thermally stable porous zirconium oxide for quick removal of lead ions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNayak, Nadiya B.; Nayak, Bibhuti B.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAqueous sodium borohydride (NaBH4) is well known for its reducing property and well-established for the development of metal nanoparticles through reduction method. In contrary, this research paper discloses the importance of aqueous NaBH4 as a precipitating agent towards development of porous zirconium oxide. The boron species present in aqueous NaBH4 play an active role during gelation as well as phase separated out in the form of boron complex during precipitation, which helps to form boron free zirconium hydroxide [Zr(OH)4] in the as-synthesized condition. Evolved in-situ hydrogen (H2) gas-bubbles also play an important role to develop as-synthesized loose zirconium hydroxide and the presence of intra-particle voids in the loose zirconium hydroxide help to develop porous zirconium oxide during calcination process. Without any surface modification, this porous zirconium oxide quickly adsorbs almost hundred percentages of toxic lead ions from water solution within 15 minutes at normal pH condition. Adsorption kinetic models suggest that the adsorption process was surface reaction controlled chemisorption. Quick adsorption was governed by surface diffusion process and the adsorption kinetic was limited by pore diffusion. Five cycles of adsorption-desorption result suggests that the porous zirconium oxide can be reused efficiently for removal of Pb (II) ions from aqueous solution.

These microgels are then exposed to anion exchange reactions with differ ionic liquid forming salts, such as potassium thiocyanate (PTC), sodium dicyanamide (SDCA), ammonium hexafluorophosphate (AHFP), and sodium tetrafluoroborate (STFB) in aqueous medium for the preparation of p(TAEA-co-GDE) based ionic liquid colloidal microgels. These anions exchanged p(TAEA-co-GDE) ionic liquid colloids (ILCs) are directly used as catalyst for hydrogen (H2) generation from the methanol solution of sodium borohydride (NaBH4). Various parameters affecting the H2 production rate such as the catalyst types, NaBH4 amount, and the temperature are investigated. It is found that the methanolysis of NaBH4 catalyzed by p(TAEA-co-GDE)-HCl obeys the first order reaction kinetic. The activation energy, enthalpy and entropy of the protonated p(TAEA-co-GDE) microgels are calculated and found as the 30.37 kJ mol-1, 27.96 kJ mol-1, and -148.08 J mol-1 K-1, respectively. Furthermore, the hydrogen generation rate of 3018 mL min-1 g-1 catalyzed by p(TAEA-co-GDE)-HCl catalyst is attained.\n\nColor reduction of sulfonated eucalyptus kraft lignin.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Hui; Bai, Youcan; Zhou, Wanpeng; Chen, Fangeng\n\n2017-04-01\n\nSeveral eucalyptus lignins named as HSL, SML and BSL were prepared by high temperature sulfonation, sulfomethylation, butane sultone sulfonation respectively. The color properties of samples were investigated. Under optimized conditions the sulfonic group (SO 3 H) content of HSL, SML and BSL reached 1.52, 1.60 and 1.58mmol/g, respectively. Samples were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, FTIR spectroscopy, 1 H NMR spectroscopy, GPC and brightness test, respectively. The results revealed that BSL performed a higher molecular weight and lighter color due to the phenolic hydroxyl blocking by 1,4-butane sultone (1,4-BS). The color reduction of sodium borohydride treated BSL (labeled as SBSL) was further enhanced and the brightness value was improved by 76.1% compared with the darkest HSL. SBSL process was much better than HSL and SML process. Hydroxyl blocking effect of 1,4-BS and reducibility of sodium borohydride played important roles in the color reduction of sulfonated eucalyptus kraft lignin. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Quantitative information on consumer knowledge of sodium and reduction of dietary sodium is limited. The objectives of this study were to characterize consumer knowledge and awareness of sodium and salt reduction in foods. Consumers (n = 489) participated in a quantitative internet survey designed to gather knowledge and attitudes towards dietary sodium, sodium in foods, and health. Eating habits and food consumption characteristics, knowledge of salt and sodium, and interest in health and wellness were probed. Saltiness believe and sodium knowledge indices were calculated based on correct responses to salt levels in food products. Kano analysis was conducted to determine the role of nutrition labels and satisfaction/dissatisfaction of foods. Consumers were aware of the presence of sodium in \"salty\" foods, and that sodium was part of salt. People who had a family history of certain diseases associated with a higher intake of dietary sodium did not necessarily have more knowledge of the relationship between sodium intake and a specific disease compared to consumers with no family history. Sodium content on the food label panel did not influence consumer dissatisfaction; however, sodium content did not necessarily increase consumer product satisfaction either. The addition of a healthy nutrient (that is, whole grain, fiber) into a current food product was appealing to consumers. For nutrient labeling, a \"reduced\" claim was more appealing to consumers than a \"free\" claim for \"unhealthy\" nutrients such as fat, sodium, and sugar. This study demonstrated the current state of consumer knowledge on sodium and salt reduction, and consumer perception of the relationship between diets high in sodium and many chronic diseases. Information that may contribute to consumer satisfaction on nutrition panel labeling was also determined.

The fuel cell system consists of a fuel cell stack, hydrogen generator, and hybrid power management system. PEMFC stack with an output power of 100 W is prepared and tested to decide the efficient operating conditions; the stack must be operated in the dead-end mode with purge in order to ensure prolonged stack performance. A hydrogen generator is fabricated to supply gaseous hydrogen to the stack. Sodium borohydride (NaBH 4) is used as the hydrogen source in the present study. Co/Al 2O 3 catalyst is prepared for the hydrolysis of the alkaline NaBH 4 solution at room temperature. The fabricated Co catalyst is comparable to the Ru catalyst. The UAV consumes more power in the takeoff mode than in the cruising mode. A hybrid power management system using an auxiliary battery is developed and evaluated for efficient energy management. Hybrid power from both the fuel cell and battery powers takeoff and turning flight operations, while the fuel cell supplies steady power during the cruising flight. The capabilities of the fuel-cell UAVs for long endurance flights are validated by successful flight tests.\n\nAggregation of nitroaniline in tetrahydrofuran through intriguing H-bond formation by sodium borohydride.\n\nPubMed\n\nGanguly, Mainak; Mondal, Chanchal; Pal, Anjali; Pratik, Saied Md; Pal, Jaya; Pal, Tarasankar\n\n2014-07-07\n\nThe participation of sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in hydrogen bonding interactions and transient anion radical formation has been proved. Thus, the properties of NaBH4 are extended beyond the purview of its normal reducing capability and nucleophilic property. It is reported that ortho- and para-nitroanilines (NAs) form stable aggregates only in tetrahydrofuran (THF) in the presence of NaBH4 and unprecedented orange/red colorations are observed. The same recipe with nitrobenzene instead of nitroanilines (NAs) in the presence of NaBH4 evolves a transient rose red solution due to the formation of a highly fluorescent anion radical. Spectroscopic studies (UV-vis, fluorescence, RLS, Raman, NMR etc.) as well as theoretical calculations supplement the J-aggregate formation of NAs due to extensive hydrogen bonding. This is the first report where BH4(-) in THF has been shown to support such an aggregation process through H-bonding. It is further confirmed that stable intermolecular hydrogen bond-induced aggregation requires a geometrical match in both the nitro- and amino-functionalities attached to the phenyl ring with proper geometry. On the contrary, meta-nitroaniline remains as the odd man out and does not take part in such aggregation. Surprisingly, Au nanoparticles dismantle the J-aggregates of NA in THF. Explicit hydrogen bond formation in NA has been confirmed experimentally considering its promising applications in different fields including non-linear optics.\n\nA novel magnetic Fe@Au core-shell nanoparticles anchored graphene oxide recyclable nanocatalyst for the reduction of nitrophenol compounds.\n\nPubMed\n\nGupta, Vinod Kumar; Atar, Necip; Yola, Mehmet LÃ¼tfi; ÃstÃ¼ndaÄ, Zafer; Uzun, Lokman\n\n2014-01-01\n\nIn this study, a novel catalyst based on Fe@Au bimetallic nanoparticles involved graphene oxide was prepared and characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM), and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The nanomaterial was used in catalytic reductions of 4-nitrophenol and 2-nitrophenol in the presence of sodium borohydride. The experimental parameters such as temperature, the dosage of catalyst and the concentration of sodium borohydride were studied. The rates of catalytic reduction of the nitrophenol compounds have been found as the sequence: 4-nitrophenol>2-nitrophenol. The kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of nitrophenol compounds were determined. Activation energies were found as 2.33 kcal mol(-1) and 3.16 kcal mol(-1) for 4-nitrophenol and 2-nitrophenol, respectively. The nanomaterial was separated from the product by using a magnet and recycled after the reduction of nitrophenol compounds. The recyclable of the nanocatalyst is economically significant in industry. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

The relative intensity of SERS of caffeine significantly varies with different concentrations of sodium chloride and silver particles. However, at too high or too low concentration of sodium chloride and silver particle, the enhancement of SERS spectra is not evident. The SERS spectra of caffeine suggest that the contribution of the charge transfer mechanism to SERS may be dominant. The chloride ions can significantly enhance the efficiency of SERS, while the enhancement is selective, as the efficiency in charge transfer enhancement is higher than in electromagnetic enhancement. Therefore, it can be concluded that the active site of chloride ion locates on the bond between the caffeine and the silver surface. In addition, the SERS spectra of caffeine on borohydride-reduced and citrate-reduced silver colloids are different, which may be due to different states caffeine adsorbed on silver surface under different silver colloids.\n\nIntrinsic borohydride fuel cell/battery hybrid power sources\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHong, Jian; Fang, Bin; Wang, Chunsheng; Currie, Kenneth\n\nThe electrochemical oxidation behaviors of NaBH 4 on Zn, Zn-MH, and MH (metal-hydride) electrodes were investigated, and an intrinsic direct borohydride fuel cell (DBFC)/battery hybrid power source using MH (or Zn-MH) as the anode and MnO 2 as the cathode was tested. Borohydride cannot be effectively oxidized on Zn electrodes at the Zn oxidation potential because of the poor electrocatalytic ability of Zn for borohydride oxidation and the high overpotential, even though borohydride has the same oxidation potential of Zn in an alkaline solution. The borohydride can be electrochemically oxidized on Ni and MH electrodes through a 4e reaction at a high overpotential. Simply adding borohydride into an alkaline electrolyte of a Zn/air or MH/air battery can greatly increase the capacity, while an intrinsic DBFC/MH(or Zn)-MnO 2 battery can deliver a higher peak power than regular DBFCs.\n\nSimulating the synthesis and thermodynamic characteristics of the desolvation of lanthanide borohydride tris-Tetrahydrofuranates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nGafurov, B. A.; Mirsaidov, I. U.; Nasrulloeva, D. Kh.; Badalov, A.\n\n2013-10-01\n\nLanthanide borohydride tris-tetrahydrofuranates (Ln(BH4) Â· 3THF, where THF is tetrahydrofuran and Ln is La, Nd, Sm, Gd, Er, Yb, and Lu) is synthesized via the exchange reaction of lanthanide(III) chloride and sodium borohydride in THF. It is found that synthesis proceeds according to a stepwise mechanism and the product of the reaction (lanthanide borohydride) initiates the process. The two-step character of the desolvation of Ln(BH4)3 Â· 3THF under steady-state conditions in the temperature range of 300 to 400 K is determined through X-ray phase and chemical analyses, tensiometry, and gas volumetry. It is established that one mole and then two moles of THF are removed from the initial sample at the first and second steps, respectively. Equations for barograms are obtained and the thermodynamic characteristics of desolvation of Ln(BH4)3 Â· 3THF under study are calculated. Gibbs energy values of the stages of process are determined semi-empirically. The law of its change for the entire series of Ln(BH4)3 Â· 3THF is determined with the emergence of the tetrad effect.\n\nDendrimer encapsulated Silver nanoparticles as novel catalysts for reduction of aromatic nitro compounds\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAsharani, I. V.; Thirumalai, D.; Sivakumar, A.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nPolyethylene glycol (PEG) core dendrimer encapsulated silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) were synthesized through normal chemical reduction method, where dendrimer acts as reducing and stabilizing agent. The encapsulated AgNPs were well characterized using TEM, DLS and XPS techniques. The synthesized AgNPs showed excellent catalytic activity towards the reduction of aromatic nitro compounds with sodium borohydride as reducing agent and the results substantiate that dendrimer encapsulated AgNPs can be an effective catalyst for the substituted nitro aromatic reduction reactions. Also the kinetics of different nitro compounds reductions was studied and presented.\n\nAchieving the WHO sodium target: estimation of reductions required in the sodium content of packaged foods and other sources of dietary sodium.\n\nPubMed\n\nEyles, Helen; Shields, Emma; Webster, Jacqui; Ni Mhurchu, Cliona\n\n2016-08-01\n\nExcess sodium intake is one of the top 2 dietary risk factors contributing to the global burden of disease. As such, many countries are now developing national sodium reduction strategies, a key component of which is a sodium reduction model that includes sodium targets for packaged foods and other sources of dietary sodium. We sought to develop a sodium reduction model to determine the reductions required in the sodium content of packaged foods and other dietary sources of sodium to reduce adult population salt intake by â¼30% toward the optimal WHO target of 5 g/d. Nationally representative household food-purchasing data for New Zealand were linked with branded food composition information to determine the mean contribution of major packaged food categories to total population sodium consumption. Discretionary salt use and the contribution of sodium from fresh foods and foods consumed away from the home were estimated with the use of national nutrition survey data. Reductions required in the sodium content of packaged foods and other dietary sources of sodium to achieve a 30% reduction in dietary sodium intakes were estimated. A 36% reduction (1.6 g salt or 628 mg Na) in the sodium content of packaged foods in conjunction with a 40% reduction in discretionary salt use and the sodium content of foods consumed away from the home would reduce total population salt intake in New Zealand by 35% (from 8.4 to 5.5 g/d) and thus meet the WHO 2025 30% relative reduction target. Key reductions required include a decrease of 21% in the sodium content of white bread, 27% for hard cheese, 42% for sausages, and 54% for ready-to-eat breakfast cereals. Achieving the WHO sodium target in New Zealand will take considerable efforts by both food manufacturers and consumers and will likely require a national government-led sodium reduction strategy.

In our present work, Co3O4 nanowires were successfully synthesized as catalyst precursor by employing SBA-15 as a hard template. For material characterization, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD), fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and N2 adsorption isotherms were employed, respectively. To measure the catalyst activity, typical water-displacement method was carried out. Using a reaction solution comprising 10wt.% NaBH4 and 2wt.% NaOH, the hydrogen generation rate (HGR) was observed to be as high as 7.74L min-1 g-1 at 25âC in the presence of Co3O4 nanowires, which is significantly higher than that of CoB nanoparticles and commercial Co3O4 powder. Apparent activation energy was calculated to be 50.9kJ mol-1. After recycling the Co3O4 nanowires six times, HGR was decreased to be 72.6% of the initial level.\n\nLessons Learned From Community-Based Approaches to Sodium Reduction\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKane, Heather; Strazza, Karen; Losby PhD, Jan L.; Lane, Rashon; Mugavero, Kristy; Anater, Andrea S.; Frost, Corey; Margolis, Marjorie; Hersey, James\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPurpose This article describes lessons from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initiative encompassing sodium reduction interventions in six communities. Design A multiple case study design was used. Setting This evaluation examined data from programs implemented in six communities located in New York (Broome County, Schenectady County, and New York City); California (Los Angeles County and Shasta County); and Kansas (Shawnee County). Subjects Participants (n = 80) included program staff, program directors, state-level staff, and partners. Measures Measures for this evaluation included challenges, facilitators, and lessons learned from implementing sodium reduction strategies. Analysis The project team conducted a document review of program materials and semi structured interviews 12 to 14 months after implementation. The team coded and analyzed data deductively and inductively. Results Five lessons for implementing community-based sodium reduction approaches emerged: (1) build relationships with partners to understand their concerns, (2) involve individuals knowledgeable about specific venues early, (3) incorporate sodium reduction efforts and messaging into broader nutrition efforts, (4) design the program to reduce sodium gradually to take into account consumer preferences and taste transitions, and (5) identify ways to address the cost of lower-sodium products. Conclusion The experiences of the six communities may assist practitioners in planning community-based sodium reduction interventions. Addressing sodium reduction using a community-based approach can foster meaningful change in dietary sodium consumption.

G.; Sleep, B. E.\n\n2016-12-01\n\nGases are commonly introduced into the subsurface via external displacement (drainage). However, gases can also be produced by internal drainage (exsolution). One example is the injection of reactive solutions for in situ groundwater remediation, such as nanoscale zero-valent iron (nzvi), which produces hydrogen gas (H2). Effective implementation of nzvi requires an understanding of H2 gas generation and dynamics, and their effects on aqueous permeability, contaminant mass transfer and potential flow diversion. Several studies have reported using excess sodium borohydride (NaBH4) in nzvi applications to promote complete reaction and to ensure uniform nzvi particle growth, which also produces H2 gas. The aim of this study was to visualize and quantify H2 produced by exsolution from the injection of NaBH4 and nzvi solutions into homogeneous sands, and to investigate the reduction of hydraulic conductivity caused by the H2 gas and the subsequent increase in hydraulic conductivity as the gas dissolved. Bench-scale experiments were performed using cold (4 Â°C) NaBH4 solutions injected in sand packed in a 22 cm Ã 34 cm Ã 1 cm flow cell. The injected solution was allowed to warm to room temperature, for controlled production of a uniform distribution of exsolved gas. A light transmission method was used to quantify gas production and dissolution over time. The results indicate a reduction of hydraulic conductivity due to the existence of H2 and increased hydraulic conductivity as H2 gas dissolves, which could be represented using traditional relative permeability expressions. Additional experiments were performed in the flow cell to compare H2 gas exsolving from nzvi and NaBH4 solutions injected as either a point injection or a well injection. The results indicated greater amounts of H2 gas produced when injecting nzvi solutions prepared with high concentrations of excess NaBH4. H2 gas pooling at the top of the flow cell, and H2 gas trapped near the injection point\n\nCatalyzed borohydrides for hydrogen storage\n\nDOEpatents\n\nAu, Ming [Augusta, GA\n\n2012-02-28\n\nA hydrogen storage material and process is provided in which alkali borohydride materials are created which contain effective amounts of catalyst(s) which include transition metal oxides, halides, and chlorides of titanium, zirconium, tin, and combinations of the various catalysts. When the catalysts are added to an alkali borodydride such as a lithium borohydride, the initial hydrogen release point of the resulting mixture is substantially lowered. Additionally, the hydrogen storage material may be rehydrided with weight percent values of hydrogen at least about 9 percent.\n\nTemperature-mediated phase transformation, pore geometry and pore hysteresis transformation of borohydride derived in-born porous zirconium hydroxide nanopowders\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNayak, Nadiya B.; Nayak, Bibhuti B.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nDevelopment of in-born porous nature of zirconium hydroxide nanopowders through a facile hydrogen (H2) gas-bubbles assisted borohydride synthesis route using sodium borohydride (NaBH4) and novel information on the temperature-mediated phase transformation, pore geometry as well as pore hysteresis transformation of in-born porous zirconium hydroxide nanopowders with the help of X-ray diffraction (XRD), BrunauerâEmmettâTeller (BET) isotherm and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images are the main theme of this research work. Without any surfactants or pore forming agents, the borohydride derived amorphous nature of porous powders was stable up to 500âÂ°C and then the seed crystals start to develop within the loose amorphous matrix and trapping the inter-particulate voids, which led to develop the porous nature of tetragonal zirconium oxide at 600âÂ°C and further sustain this porous nature as well as tetragonal phase of zirconium oxide up to 800âÂ°C. The novel hydrogen (H2) gas-bubbles assisted borohydride synthesis route led to develop thermally stable porous zirconium hydroxide/oxide nanopowders with an adequate pore size, pore volume, and surface area and thus these porous materials are further suggested for promising use in different areas of applications.

Using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2007-2010 data, we estimated current sodium intake in US population ethnic subgroups and modeled the potential impact of a new sodium reduction technology on sodium intake. NHANES 2007-2010 data were analyzed using The National Cancer Institute method to estimate usual intake in population subgroups. Potential impact of SODA-LOÂ® Salt Microspheres sodium reduction technology on sodium intake was modeled using suggested sodium reductions of 20-30% in 953 foods and assuming various market penetrations. SAS 9.2, SUDAAN 11, and NHANES survey weights were used in all calculations with assessment across age, gender and ethnic groups. Current sodium intake across all population subgroups exceeds the Dietary Guidelines 2010 recommendations and has not changed during the last decade. However, sodium intake measured as a function of food intake has decreased significantly during the last decade for all ethnicities. \"Grain Products\" and \"Meat, Poultry, Fish, & Mixtures\" contribute about 2/3rd of total sodium intake. Sodium reduction, using SODA-LOÂ® Salt Microspheres sodium reduction technology (with 100% market penetration) was estimated to be 185-323Â mg/day or 6.3-8.4% of intake depending upon age, gender and ethnic group. Current sodium intake in US ethnic subgroups exceeds the recommendations and sodium reduction technologies could potentially help reduce dietary sodium intake among those groups.\n\nEvaluation of anode (electro)catalytic materials for the direct borohydride fuel cell: Methods and benchmarks\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOlu, Pierre-Yves; Job, Nathalie; Chatenet, Marian\n\n2016-09-01\n\nIn this paper, different methods are discussed for the evaluation of the potential of a given catalyst, in view of an application as a direct borohydride fuel cell DBFC anode material. Characterizations results in DBFC configuration are notably analyzed at the light of important experimental variables which influence the performances of the DBFC. However, in many practical DBFC-oriented studies, these various experimental variables prevent one to isolate the influence of the anode catalyst on the cell performances. Thus, the electrochemical three-electrode cell is a widely-employed and useful tool to isolate the DBFC anode catalyst and to investigate its electrocatalytic activity towards the borohydride oxidation reaction (BOR) in the absence of other limitations. This article reviews selected results for different types of catalysts in electrochemical cell containing a sodium borohydride alkaline electrolyte. In particular, propositions of common experimental conditions and benchmarks are given for practical evaluation of the electrocatalytic activity towards the BOR in three-electrode cell configuration. The major issue of gaseous hydrogen generation and escape upon DBFC operation is also addressed through a comprehensive review of various results depending on the anode composition. At last, preliminary concerns are raised about the stability of potential anode catalysts upon DBFC operation.\n\nEvaluation of Australian soup manufacturer compliance with national sodium reduction targets.\n\nPubMed\n\nLevi, Rebecca; Probst, Yasmine; Crino, Michelle; Dunford, Elizabeth\n\n2018-04-01\n\nPackaged foods dominate Australia's food supply and are important contributors to nutrition-related disease. To help address this problem, the Food and Health Dialogue (FHD) was launched in 2009, setting voluntary sodium reduction targets for various categories of packaged foods. The aim of this study was to examine the food industry's progress and compliance with the FHD sodium reduction targets for soup products. Nutritional information was collected from product labels of all soup products available from four major Australian supermarkets annually between 2011 and 2014. Products were assigned to categories in line with those in the FHD. The proportion of soup products meeting sodium reduction targets was examined by (i) soup category; (ii) FHD participant status; and (iii) manufacturer. A 6% reduction in sodium levels in soups overall was found from 2011 to 2014 (Pâ=â0.002). Significant reductions were observed for FHD participants (Pâ<â0.05 for all) but not for non-participants. In 2014, 67% dry soups and 76% of wet soups met national sodium reduction targets. Despite the majority of soup products meeting the sodium reduction targets specified by the FHD, re-evaluation of the targets may be required to further reduce sodium levels in soups. Manufacturers participating in the FHD are likely to be driving sodium reductions in the Australian soup market, further highlighting the need for continued government leadership in this area to ensure all manufacturers are actively involved in the process.

The key step involved rapid reductive amination of aldehyde 8 with aniline 5 by sodium triacetoxyborohydride (STAB-H) and TFA followed by ring closure of intermediate amine 9 to compound 1 in the same pot. These reaction conditions were also applied to facile reductive aminations with anilines known to have little reactivity under STAB-H/AcOH conditions. Spectral data supported the tris(trifluoroacetoxy)borohydride anion (16) as the active reducing agent.\n\nTime to Consider Use of the Sodium-to-Potassium Ratio for Practical Sodium Reduction and Potassium Increase\n\nPubMed Central\n\nMiura, Katsuyuki; Ueshima, Hirotsugu\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPathogenetic studies have demonstrated that the interdependency of sodium and potassium affects blood pressure. Emerging evidences on the sodium-to-potassium ratio show benefits for a reduction in sodium and an increase in potassium compared to sodium and potassium separately. As presently there is no known review, this article examined the practical use of the sodium-to-potassium ratio in daily practice. Epidemiological studies suggest that the urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio may be a superior metric as compared to separate sodium and potassium values for determining the relation to blood pressure and cardiovascular disease risks. Higher correlations and better agreements are seen for the casual urine sodium-to-potassium ratio than for casual urine sodium or potassium alone when compared with the 24-h urine values. Repeated measurements of the casual urine provide reliable estimates of the 7-day 24-h urine value with less bias for the sodium-to-potassium ratio as compared to the common formulas used for estimating the single 24-h urine from the casual urine for sodium and potassium separately. Self-monitoring devices for the urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio measurement makes it possible to provide prompt onsite feedback. Although these devices have been evaluated with a view to support an individual approach for sodium reduction and potassium increase, there has yet to be an accepted recommended guideline for the sodium-to-potassium ratio. This review concludes with a look at the practical use of the sodium-to-potassium ratio for assistance in practical sodium reduction and potassium increase.

If successful, this strategy will enable reduction of sodium without affecting consumer satisfaction with regard to salty taste. The microstructure approach comprised of entrapment of sodium in the internal aqueous phase of water-in-oil-in-water emulsions. These were designed to destabilise during oral processing when in contact with the salivary enzyme amylase in combination with the mechanical manipulation of the emulsion between the tongue and palate. Oral destabilisation was achieved through breakdown of the emulsion that was stabilised with a commercially modified octenyl succinic anhydride (OSA)-starch. Microstructure breakdown and salt release was evaluated utilising in vitro, in vivo and sensory methods. For control emulsions, stabilised with orally inert proteins, no loss of structure and no release of sodium from the internal aqueous phase was found. The OSA-starch microstructure breakdown took the initial form of oil droplet coalescence. It is hypothesised that during this coalescence process sodium from the internalised aqueous phase is partially released and is therefore available for perception. Indeed, programmed emulsions showed an enhancement in saltiness perception; a 23.7% reduction in sodium could be achieved without compromise in salty taste (p < 0.05; 120 consumers). This study shows a promising new approach for sodium reduction in liquid and semi-liquid emulsion based foods.\n\nFrom Menu to Mouth: Opportunities for Sodium Reduction in Restaurants\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGunn, Janelle Peralez\n\n2014-01-01\n\nRestaurant foods can be a substantial source of sodium in the American diet. According to the Institute of Medicine, the significant contribution made by restaurants and food service menu items to Americansâ sodium intake warrants targeted attention. Public health practitioners are uniquely poised to support sodium-reduction efforts in restaurants and help drive demand for lower-sodium products through communication and collaboration with restaurant and food service professionals and through incentives for restaurants. This article discusses the role of the public health practitioner in restaurant sodium reduction and highlights select strategies that have been taken by state and local jurisdictions to support this effort.

Quantitative information on current consumer knowledge of sodium reduction trends in Korea is unknown. The objective of this study was to quantify the consumer knowledge and awareness of sodium and salt reduction in foods and to characterize consumer interest in health labeling on the food package. Additionally, comparison of consumer knowledge status between Korea and United States was followed. Consumers (n = 289) participated in an internet survey designed to gauge consumer knowledge and attitudes toward dietary sodium, the sodium content in representative food products (n = 27), and their interest toward specific health claims, including sodium labeling. Questions regarding demographics as well as consumption characteristics were asked. Sodium knowledge index and saltiness belief index were calculated based on the number of correct responses regarding the salt level and sodium content in given food products. Kano analysis was conducted to determine the role of nutrition labels in consumer satisfaction with products. Current consumer knowledge on the sodium content in food products was high, and consumers were adept at matching the sodium content with the salty taste intensity of food products. Consumers' knowledge of the relationship between diets high in sodium and an increased risk of developing previously reported sodium-related diseases, such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, kidney disease, and stomach cancer, were also high. Information on the nutrition panel that influences the consumer satisfaction (trans-fat, sodium, ingredient list, and country of origin) as well as adjective-nutrition claim pairs that appeal positively to purchase intent of the product were identified. This work provided the current status of Korean consumer knowledge on the amount of sodium in food and that sodium can be a risk factor of developing chronic diseases.

Two counties have been selected from each province and 12 townships in each county making a total of 120 clusters. Within each township one village has been selected for participation with 1:1 randomization stratified by county. The sodium reduction intervention comprises community health education and a food supply strategy based upon providing access to salt substitute.

The sodium reduction program was commenced in the 60 intervention villages between May and June of that year with outcome surveys scheduled for October to December 2012. Baseline data collection shows that randomisation achieved good balance across groups. The establishment of the China Rural Health Initiative has enabled the launch of this large-scale trial designed to identify a novel, scalable strategy for reduction of dietary sodium and control of blood pressure.

Aluminum is a cheap, light, and abundant element and Al 3+ can serve as a template for reversible dehydrogenation. However, Al(BH 4 ) 3 , containing 16.9â wtâ% of hydrogen, has a low boiling point, is explosive on air and has poor storage stability. A new family of mixed-cation borohydrides M[Al(BH 4 ) 4 ], which are all solid under ambient conditions, show diverse thermal decomposition behaviors: Al(BH 4 ) 3 is released for M=Li + or Na + , whereas heavier derivatives evolve hydrogen and diborane. NH 4 [Al(BH 4 ) 4 ], containing both protic and hydridic hydrogen, has the lowest decomposition temperature of 35âÂ°C and yields Al(BH 4 ) 3 â NHBH and hydrogen. The decomposition temperatures, correlated with the cations' ionic potential, show that M[Al(BH 4 ) 4 ] species are in the most practical stability window. This family of solids, with convenient and versatile properties, puts aluminum borohydride chemistry in the mainstream of hydrogen storage research, for example, for the development of reactive hydride composites with increased hydrogen content.

Starting out from an academic institution, the Lebanese Action on Sodium and Health (LASH) campaign was established to counter the increasing prevalence of hypertension and associated adverse health effects. The campaignâs strategy was based on four pillars: research, health communication, advocacy, and monitoring. The LASH group set out with determining: baseline sodium intake of the population, main sources of sodium intake, and the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors (KAB) of the population as a situation analysis that prompts for action. This gave LASH tangible evidence of the magnitude of the problem and the need for the government, the food industry, and the consumers, to be mobilized to take part in devising a solution. Currently, Lebanon is at a stage of technically working to reduce the sodium content in the major sources of sodium, namely local bread and bread-like products. The next steps will include implementation of a plan for monitoring industry compliance, while studying other food targets, including dairy products and processed meat. Meanwhile, the health communication plan is ongoing and the Salt Awareness Week is celebrated every year with media appearances of LASH researchers to raise the issue to the public eye.

Ca(BH(4))(2) was incorporated into activated mesoporous carbon by the incipient wetness method. The activation of mesoporous carbon was necessary to optimize the surface area and pore size. Thermal programmed absorption measurements showed that the confinement of this borohydride into carbon nanoscaffolds improved its reversible capacity (relative to the reactive portion) and performance of hydrogen storage compared to unsupported borohydride. Hydrogen release from the supported hydride started at a temperature as low as 100 Â°C and the dehydrogenation rate was fast compared to the bulk borohydride. In addition, the hydrogen pressure necessary to regenerate the borohydride from the dehydrogenation products was reduced.\n\nEnhanced hydrogen release by catalyzed hydrolysis of sodium borohydride-ammonia borane mixtures: a solution-state 11B NMR study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHannauer, J; Demirci, U B; Geantet, C; Herrmann, J M; Miele, P\n\n2011-03-07\n\nHydrolysis of mixtures consisting of sodium borohydride NaBH(4) (SB) and ammonia borane NH(3)BH(3) (AB) was studied in the absence/presence of a Co catalyst. The kinetics of the H(2) evolutions was measured. The reactions were followed in situ by solution-state (11)B NMR and the hydrolysis by-products characterized by NMR, XRD and IR. It is demonstrated that the combination of the two compounds gives a synergetic effect. SB rapidly reduces the Co catalyst precursor and the NH(4)(+) ions from AB contribute in the dispersion of the in situ formed Co nanoparticles. As a result, the kinetics of H(2) evolution is greatly improved. For instance, a hydrogen generation rate of 29.6 L min(-1) g(-1)(Co) was found for a mixture consisting of 81 wt% NH(3)BH(3), 9 wt% NaBH(4) and 10 wt% CoCl(2). By (11)B NMR, it was showed that the reaction mechanisms are quite trivial. As soon as the Co catalyst forms in situ, SB, rather than AB, hydrolyzes until it is totally converted. Then, the overall hydrolysis continues with that of AB. Both reactions follow a bimolecular Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism; no reaction intermediates were observed during the process. In fact, SB and AB convert directly into B(OH)(4)(-), which comes in equilibrium with a polyborate compound identified as B(3)O(3)(OH)(4)(-). All of these results are discussed herein.\n\nA LARGE-SCALE CLUSTER RANDOMIZED TRIAL TO DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF COMMUNITY-BASED DIETARY SODIUM REDUCTION â THE CHINA RURAL HEALTH INITIATIVE SODIUM REDUCTION STUDY\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLi, Nicole; Yan, Lijing L.; Niu, Wenyi; Labarthe, Darwin; Feng, Xiangxian; Shi, Jingpu; Zhang, Jianxin; Zhang, Ruijuan; Zhang, Yuhong; Chu, Hongling; Neiman, Andrea; Engelgau, Michael; Elliott, Paul; Wu, Yangfeng; Neal, Bruce\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death and disability in China.

The metal loading in synthesized nanocatalysts was 20wt% and the molar ratio of Ni: Pt was 1:1. The structural characterizations of Ni@Pt/C electrocatalysts were investigated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The electrocatalytic activity of Ni@Pt/C electrocatalysts toward BH 4 - oxidation in alkaline medium was studied by means of cyclic voltammetry (CV), chronopotentiometry (CP), chronoamperometry (CA) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The results showed that Ni@Pt/C electrocatalyst synthesized without SDS has superior catalytic activity toward borohydride oxidation (22016.92Ag Pt -1 ) in comparison with a catalyst prepared in the presence of SDS (17766.15Ag Pt -1 ) in NaBH 4 0.1M at 25Â°C. The Membrane Electrode Assembly (MEA) used in fuel cell set-up was fabricated with catalyst-coated membrane (CCM) technique. The effect of Ni@Pt/C catalysts prepared with two methods as anode catalyst on the performance of direct borohydride-hydrogen peroxide fuel cell was studied. The maximum power density was obtained using Ni@Pt/C catalyst synthesized without SDS at 60Â°C, 1M NaBH 4 and 2M H 2 O 2 (133.38mWcm -2 ). Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Using NHANES 2007-2010 data, we estimated current sodium intake and modeled the potential impact of a new sodium reduction technology on sodium intake. NHANES 2007-2010 data were used to assess current sodium intake. The National Cancer Institute method was used for usual intake determination. Suggested sodium reductions using SODA-LO (Â®) Salt Microspheres ranged from 20% to 30% in 953 foods and usual intakes were modeled by using various reduction factors and levels of market penetration. SAS 9.2, SUDAAN 11, and NHANES survey weights were used in all calculations with assessment across gender and age groups. Current (2007-2010) sodium intake (mg/day) exceeds recommendations across all age gender groups and has not changed during the last decade. However, sodium intake measured as a function of food intake (mg/g food) has decreased significantly during the last decade. Two food categories contribute about 2/3rd of total sodium intake: \"Grain Products\" and \"Meat, Poultry, Fish & Mixtures\". Sodium reduction, with 100% market penetration of the new technology, was estimated to be 230-300Â mg/day or 7-9% of intake depending upon age and gender group. Sodium reduction innovations like SODA-LO (Â®) Salt Microspheres could contribute to meaningful reductions in sodium intake.\n\nDietary sodium reduction in New Zealand: influence of the Tick label.\n\nPubMed\n\nNing, Sherry X; Mainvil, Louise A; Thomson, Rachel K; McLean, Rachel M\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe Tick programme of the National Heart Foundation (NHF) is the longest standing voluntary front of pack signpost nutrition logo in New Zealand. It provides a platform for collaboration with the food industry to encourage development of healthier products. This study evaluated the impact of the Tick programme on sodium in processed food. Fifty-two Tick programme products from food categories known to contribute substantially to sodium intake were identified. Sales volumes (kg) from January 2011 to December 2013 were multiplied by changes in sodium content over that time, producing an estimate of programme impact. Five semi-structured interviews with industry representatives were conducted, to look at other influences for sodium reduction, and themes identified through methods of thematic analysis. Over the period, the Tick programme influenced food companies to remove approximately 16 tonnes of salt through the reformulation and formulation of 52 Tick-approved breakfast cereals, edible oil spreads, cooking sauces and processed poultry products. Other factors influencing sodium reduction reported by company representatives included increased consumer and industry interest in healthier product nutrition profiles and other sodium reduction programmes targeting reformulation/formulation. The Tick remains a credible and well-recognized brand and may provide a competitive edge for participating food manufacturers in the current market. The Tick programme is effective in influencing industry to reduce sodium in processed foods in New Zealand. The combined impact of the Tick and other NHF programmes has the potential to reduce population sodium intake and improve health outcomes.\n\nCharacterization of Sodium Mobility and Binding by 23 Na NMR Spectroscopy in a Model Lipoproteic Emulsion Gel for Sodium Reduction.\n\nPubMed\n\nOkada, Kyle S; Lee, Youngsoo\n\n2017-07-01\n\nThe effects of formulation and processing parameters on sodium availability in a model lipid/protein-based emulsion gel were studied for purposes of sodium reduction. Heat-set model gels were prepared with varying levels of protein, lipid, and NaCl contents and high pressure homogenization treatments. Single quantum and double quantum-filtered 23 Na NMR spectroscopy experiments were used to characterize sodium mobility, structural order around \"bound\" (restricted mobility) sodium, and sodium binding, which have been correlated to saltiness perception in food systems previously. Total sodium mobility was lower in gels with higher protein or fat content, and was not affected by changes in homogenization pressure. The gels with increased protein, fat, or homogenization pressure had increased structure surrounding \"bound\" sodium and more relative \"bound\" sodium due to increased interfacial protein interactions. The data obtained in this study provide information on factors affecting sodium availability, which can be applied towards sodium reduction in lipid/protein-based foods.

Socio-economic inequities in sodium consumption seem likely, but research is limited. Knowledge of socio-economic inequities in sodium consumption is important for informing population-level sodium reduction strategies, to ensure that they are both impactful and equitable. We examined the association between socio-economic indicators (income and education) and sodium, using two outcome variables: 1) sodium consumption in mg/day, and 2) reported use of table salt, in two national surveys: the 1970/72 Nutrition Canada Survey and the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey, Cycle 2.2. This permitted us to explore whether there were any changes in socio-economic patterning in dietary sodium during a time period characterized by modest, information-based national sodium reduction efforts, as well as to provide baseline information against which to examine the impact (equitable or not) of future sodium reduction strategies in Canada. There was no evidence of a socio-economic inequity in sodium consumption (mg/day) in 2004. In fact findings pointed to a positive association in women, whereby women of higher education consumed more sodium than women of lower education in 2004. For men, income was positively associated with reported use of table salt in 1970/72, but negatively associated in 2004. An emerging inequity in reported use of table salt among men could reflect the modest, information-based sodium reduction efforts that were implemented during the time frame considered. However, for sodium consumption in mg/day, we found no evidence of a contemporary inequity, and in fact observed the opposite effect among women. Our findings could reflect data limitations, or they could signal that sodium differs from some other nutrients in terms of its socio-economic patterning, perhaps reflecting very high prevalence of excess consumption\n\nMethod of recycling lithium borate to lithium borohydride through diborane\n\nDOEpatents\n\nFilby, Evan E.\n\n1976-01-01\n\nThis invention provides a method for the recycling of lithium borate to lithium borohydride which can be reacted with water to generate hydrogen for utilization as a fuel.

Pearson's Crystal Data. Crystal Structure Database for Inorganic Compounds, Release 2014/2015, ASM International, Materials Park, Ohio, USA]. The coordination polyhedra around the cations and the borohydride anion are determined, and constitute the basis of the structural systematics underlying metal borohydride chemistry in various frameworks and variants of ionic packing, including complex anions and the packing of neutral molecules in the crystal. Underlying nets are determined by topology analysis using the program TOPOS [Blatov (2006). IUCr CompComm. Newsl. 7, 4-38]. It is found that the Pauling rules for ionic crystals apply to all non-molecular borohydride crystal structures, and that the latter can often be derived by simple deformation of the close-packed anionic lattices c.c.p. and h.c.p., by partially removing anions and filling tetrahedral or octahedral sites. The deviation from an ideal close packing is facilitated in metal borohydrides with respect to the oxide due to geometrical and electronic considerations of the BH4(-) anion (tetrahedral shape, polarizability). This review on crystal chemistry of borohydrides and their similarity to oxides is a contribution which should serve materials engineers as a roadmap to design new materials, synthetic chemists in their search for promising compounds to be prepared, and materials scientists in understanding the properties of novel materials.\n\nStructural, textural and sensory impact of sodium reduction on long fermented pizza.\n\nPubMed\n\nBernklau, Isabelle; NeuÃer, Christian; Moroni, Alice V; Gysler, Christof; Spagnolello, Alessandro; Chung, Wookyung; Jekle, Mario; Becker, Thomas\n\n2017-11-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to elucidate the microstructural, textural, and sensory impact of sodium reduction and its partial replacement by potassium chloride in pizza dough and crusts prepared by a traditional long fermentation process. For the first time, macrostructural changes in texture were elucidated and quantified by a novel protein network analysis. The fermentation process exerted a strengthening effect in the doughs, allowing to reduce sodium up to 25% without any negative impact on texture. Sodium reduction by 15% did not cause any significant textural changes in pizza crusts and partial replacement by KCl resulted in a strengthened dough and firmer pizza crust. The use of toppings masked the effect of lowering the sodium content, allowing to increase the reduction level from 15% to 35%. A reduction of NaCl by 25% with an addition of KCl achieved high acceptance in the sensory evaluation. Copyright Â© 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study the effect of monosodium glutamate (MSG), as an umami substance, on saltiness and sodium reduction was investigated. Methods and Results The trained panellists were presented with basic spicy soups (curry chicken and chili chicken) containing different amounts of sodium chloride (NaCl) (0â1.2%) and MSG (0â1.2%). They tasted the optimum concentrations of NaCl and MSG for the two spicy soups and the overall acceptability were 0.8% and 0.7%, respectively. There was no significant effect of spiciness level on the saltiness and umami taste of both soups. The optimum levels of combined NaCl and MSG for overall acceptance in the chili and curry soups were 0.3% and 0.7%, respectively. The results showed that with the addition of MSG, it is possible to reduce sodium intake without changing the overall acceptability of the spicy soup. A 32.5% reduction in sodium level is made feasible by adding 0.7% MSG to the spicy soups. Conclusions This study suggests that low-sodium soups can be developed by the addition of appropriate amounts of MSG, while maintaining the acceptability of the spicy soups. It was also proven that it is feasible to reduce sodium intake by replacing NaCl with MSG.

The aim of current work is to clarify the promotion behavior of sodium chloride in the roasting reduction process. The influence of moisture on the reduction of ore in the presence of sodium chloride is studied to get clear comprehension of promotion process. In the presence of moisture, the HCl is produced by pyrohydrolysis of sodium chloride for chlorinating nickel and iron oxides, moreover, interactions between metallic oxides and sodium chloride are also a way for chlorination at high temperature (>802âÂ°C); subsequently, the metal chloride would be reduced by reductant. In the absence of moisture, the magnetic separation results show that the recoveries of iron and nickel have a significant increase; moreover, olivine structure would be destroyed gradually with the increase of roasting temperature in the action of sodium chloride, and the sodium chloride existed in high-magnesium, low-nickel oxide ore could make the NiO isolate from NiO-bearing minerals. The NiO reacts with Fe2O3 at high temperature to form NiFe2O4, which is conductive to the formation of Ni-Fe alloy during the reduction process.

Here, we demonstrate a mechanical-force-driven self-printing process that enables monodispersed (~6ânm) NaBH4 nanodots to uniformly anchor onto freshly-exfoliated graphitic nanosheets (GNs). Both mechanical-forces and borohydride interaction with GNs stimulate NaBH4 clusters intercalation/absorption into the graphite interlayers acting as a âpenâ for writing, which is accomplished by exfoliating GNs with the âprintedâ borohydrides. These nano-NaBH4@GNs exhibit favorable thermodynamics (decrease in ÎH of ~45%), rapid kinetics (a greater than six-fold increase) and stable de-/re-hydrogenation that retains a high capacity (up to ~5âwt% for NaBH4) compared with those of micro-NaBH4. Our results are helpful in the scalable fabrication of zero-dimensional complex hydrides on two-dimensional supports with enhanced hydrogen storage for potential applications.\n\nCross-Course Collaboration in the Undergraduate Chemistry Curriculum: Isotopic Labeling with Sodium Borodeuteride in the Introductory Organic Chemistry Laboratory\n\nERIC Educational Resources Information Center\n\nKjonaas, Richard A.; Fitch, Richard W.; Noll, Robert J.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nA microscale isotopic labeling experiment is described for the introductory organic chemistry laboratory course wherein half of the students use sodium borohydride (NaBH[subscript 4]) and the other half use sodium borodeuteride (NaBD[subscript 4]) to reduce acetophenone to 1-phenylethanol and then compare spectral data. The cost is reasonable, andâ¦\n\nWorking with grocers to reduce dietary sodium: lessons learned from the Broome County Sodium Reduction in Communities pilot project.\n\nPubMed\n\nJohnston, Yvonne A; McFadden, Mary; Lamphere, Marissa; Buch, Karen; Stark, Beth; Salton, Judith Lynn\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe purpose of this article is to describe implementation of and lessons learned from the Broome County Sodium Reduction in Communities grocery store initiative. This pilot project was conducted in collaboration with a regional supermarket chain and endeavored to develop population-based strategies for reducing sodium intake. Key interventions included marketing strategies, taste test demonstrations, and a public media campaign. Project staff worked closely with corporate registered dietitian nutritionists, a nutrition specialist, and an advertising agency in its development and implementation. A social marketing approach was used to educate consumers about the hidden sources of dietary sodium, to raise awareness of the adverse health effects of excess sodium intake, to encourage consumers to read food labels, "
