The aim of the organisation is to establish a harmonised and sustainable system for collecting and recycling this kind of packaging across Switzerland. The materials collected will be recycled and used again in packaging.\n\nRecyPac chimes with our ambitious sustainability goal of making all packaging fully recyclable by 2027 in the interests of circularity. As a producer of high-quality dairy products, we depend on recyclable packaging. We commit to this goal through our membership of various organisations.\n\nrecypac.ch\n\nIn Wisconsin, Emmi Roth opened an ultra-modern site where cheese will be converted and packaged, using resources efficiently. This will enable the Emmi Group to consolidate its business activity in the USA, its most important overseas market, while forging still further ahead on the American speciality cheese market. The large-scale investment will give rise to additional sales opportunities for imported Swiss cheese.\n\nThe facility, which runs on electrical energy, will also help Emmi on the road to netZERO 2050. Around 125 new and ergonomic workstations were also created.\n\nMedia release\n\nAt the World Cheese Awards, Emmi Group cheeses won no fewer than 18 medals. Seven of these went to the cave-aged Kaltbach cheese. The renowned competition – the biggest of its kind in the world – considered more than 4,000 cheeses from 40 nations.\n\nThe large number of awards is confirmation of our depth of expertise in cheese, which is based on the traditional craftsmanship that we continue to develop and foster through our strategic focus on speciality cheeses.\n\nMedia release\n\nGlobally, around a third of all food ends up as waste, accounting for 8% of carbon emissions. Emmi is committed to taking steps to prevent food waste, thereby aiming to halve the waste created by our production processes as well as food waste by 2027. To achieve this, Emmi collaborates with outside partners and continually enhances its production processes.\n\nWe also take part in various initiatives designed to combat food waste. Since 2017, we have succeeded in reducing our food waste by 13%. In this way, we are making our contribution towards United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 12 (“Responsible consumption and production”) while taking another step towards our netZERO 2050 vision.\n\nemmi.com/sustainability\n\nThe Rachelli dessert Classico Tiramisu received the coveted Great Taste Award in the UK – just three months after launching on the UK market. Rachelli, a premium brand from Emmi Dessert Italia, is a pioneer in authentic Italian dessert creations made with carefully selected ingredients. It is produced using Sardinian Savoiardi sponge fingers and Italian Marsala wine.\n\nThe award underlines the innovative flair of the Italian subsidiary in a key strategic niche which the Emmi Group is seeking to expand and develop as part of its strategy.\n\nrachelli.it\n\nGiven the acute shortage of workers and skilled professionals, employee development – as anchored in the Emmi strategy – is vitally important. As part of this strategy, Emmi sets great store by high-quality apprentice training and staff development opportunities.\n\nThe fact that all 44 of the apprentices in Switzerland successfully completed their training, with a large number of the young professionals subsequently staying with the company, is testament to Emmi’s dedication to its employees. We are passionate about ensuring young people can gain a sound training before looking ahead to development opportunities within the company.\n\nemmi.com/apprenticeships\n\nWe published our seventh sustainability report as part of our long-standing commitment to sustainability, which is an integral part of Emmi’s corporate strategy. Every two years we take stock of how we are measuring up to our commitments.\n\nWe are on course to achieve our ambitious sustainability goals for 2027 in the areas of people, communities and the planet. Emmi has made progress in employee development and sustainable dairy while cutting greenhouse gas emissions and reducing waste. Thus, we create the best dairy moments – today and for generations to come.\n\nMedia release\n\nemmi.com/sustainability\n\nAs well as optimising production and logistics processes at our dessert companies Emmi Dessert Italia and Pasticceria Quadrifoglio, we increased our production capacities and invested in an innovation centre. These optimisation measures are consolidating our position in this key strategic niche.\n\nExpansion of the production site in Campogalliano, which makes products such as our fine tiramisu, has been realised in an energy-efficient way, and will help the Emmi Group meet its net zero reduction targets.\n\nMedia release\n\nA passion for the best dairy moments is also uniting our teams in the Netherlands. Since the spring of 2023, we have operated our goat’s milk powder business in Etten-Leur as Emmi Nutritional Solutions (ENS) with a view to strengthening this attractive niche.\n\nENS then joined forces with Emmi Benelux and Bettinehoeve to form a more powerful and agile organisation. This creates more opportunities for employees, customers and consumers, and provides greater strategic oversight with the involvement of local teams.\n\nMedia release\n\nemminutritionals.com\n\nThe new Emmi Caffè Latte flavours were developed by and for GenZ. The Marketing department asked Emmi apprentices in this target group to share their ideas and preferences. The results were developed into new recipes, sampled and rated by the young people and finally produced by us.\n\nThe winners: Popcorn and Hazelnut Brownie. The idea behind the new “Fun Latte” is that young people are once again looking for some light-hearted fun after the pandemic years.\n\nemmi.com/stories\n\nAs the leading manufacturer of high-quality dairy products in Switzerland, we attach great importance to a balanced and healthy diet. Back in 2015, we committed to reducing the sugar content of our yogurts.\n\nToday we are supporting the extension of the Milan Declaration to milk drinks, such as our popular Emmi Caffè Latte, and also to quark.\n\nIn California, Cypress Grove and Cowgirl Creamery are enjoying market success with unique goat’s and cow’s milk specialities – and innovative products are generating a lot of excitement. Cypress Grove launched a cheddar made from 100% goat’s milk. Its velvety texture and nutty, savoury flavour are winning over consumers.\n\nThree of Cowgirl Creamery’s popular soft cheeses made from Northern Californian organic cow’s milk – “Devil’s Gulch”, “Pierce Point” and “Red Hawk” – were also given a refresh this year, and their recipes refined. The latter now boasts even better consistency and quality.\n\ncypressgrovecheese.com\n\ncowgirlcreamery.com\n\nEmmi is the first Swiss private company to bring an industrial solar thermal system made by Geneva-based company TVP into operation. At the Langnau site, where products including the Gerber fondue specialities are made, the system converts sunlight into carbon-free heat using around 100 solar thermal collectors. This step towards netZERO has enabled us to further decarbonise our energy supply.\n\nMedia release\n\nEmmi is blazing a trail with Beleaf’s innovative vegan, oat milk-based semi-hard cheese alternative, and is expanding its range in the growing segment of plant-based milk alternatives. Thanks to a sophisticated fermentation process and the addition of plant-based proteins and Swiss oats, the product is a viable alternative to the original in terms of both taste and nutritional value.\n\nemmi.com/stories\n\nbeleaf.eu\n\nEmmi celebrated the launch of the new, resource-saving cheese dairy at its traditional location in Emmen. With an investment of CHF 50 million, this new dairy is one of the most significant projects in our history. The ultra-modern plant is geared to the company's long-term growth plans in the area of speciality cheeses such as Luzerner Rahmkäse and is boosting long-term value creation in central Switzerland in homage to the Swiss cheese tradition.\n\nMedia release\n\nFollowing the acquisition of the Athenos business in 2021, the leading speciality cheese on the US feta market was quickly and successfully integrated into Emmi Roth USA. This has enabled Emmi to systematically expand its portfolio in the strategic area of speciality cheese and in our most important foreign market. The integration also creates synergies and additional efficiency gains, further strengthening Emmi Roth’s market position.\n\nMedia release\n\nFifty young people began their apprenticeship at Emmi in 2022 – more than ever before. The 133 total apprentices in Switzerland is also a record figure. This positive development is no accident, but rather a product of the sustainability goals anchored in our strategy in the field of employee development: we create a place where everyone feels welcome, valued and inspired and offer growth opportunities for all our apprentices and employees.\n\nEmmi’s popularity as an employer among young apprentices can be explained not only by the high-quality of our apprenticeship programme, but also by the Emmi culture, which creates a friendly, cooperative atmosphere as well as a supportive and motivating work environment.\n\nemmi.com/stories\n\nEach year, US supermarket chain Whole Foods honours its best suppliers with the «Supplier of the Year Award». The prestigious accolade in the Innovation category went to our Californian subsidiary Cypress Grove. The goat’s cheese manufacturer puts its heart and soul into producing a wide variety of cheese specialities, ranging from innovative combinations with lavender and fennel seeds through to classics featuring ash.\n\nThe award is given to manufacturers who develop innovative breakthroughs that set new trends in the industry. This is already the second time Cypress Grove has been recognised by the jury since the awards were launched ten years ago.\n\ncypressgrovecheese.com\n\nOur Management Practice Programme is a key initiative to develop talents and the next generation of leaders within the Emmi Group at the level of middle management. In international teams, participants spend nine months working together on selected projects with relevance for the entire Emmi Group, supported by representatives of Emmi Group Management. This programme, which is run every two years, promotes targeted international networking within the company. It also supports our ongoing efforts to provide an environment where employees feel welcome, inspired and have opportunities for development. In this way, the Management Practice programme is an important contributor to one of the targets defined within our Emmi sustainability model of filling 50 percent of vacancies internally by 2027.\n\nemmi.com/sustainability\n\nThe dessert creations of Emmi Dessert USA and our Italian manufactory Pasticceria Quadrifoglio won three awards from the Food & Beverage Innovator (FABI) in the USA.\n\nThe FABI Award recognises companies for developing exceptional foods and beverages that lead the way within their category in terms of new flavours, flavour profiles, creativity and their potential for innovation.\n\npasticceriaquadrifoglio.com\n\nJoint efforts are needed to advance effective solutions for climate protection. With that in mind, we have started the «KlimaStaR Milch» initiative, together with our milk suppliers and Nestlé and backed by scientific partners.\n\nThe cross-sectoral initiative pursues the goal of gaining scientifically based insights in order to make the Swiss dairy industry more competitive and sustainable with respect to climate protection and resource efficiency. The project is supported by the Federal Office for Agriculture and includes around 300 agricultural pilot operations.\n\nMedia release\n\nemmi.com/sustainability\n\nBuilding on our abilities and our DNA , the new Emmi Purpose helps us to continue to do the right thing and to take long-term responsibility. It equips ourselves for the changes that lie ahead in a volatile world and inspires us to jointly create the best dairy moments – today and for generations to come.\n\nOur sustainable economic success is based on a focused and proven strategy. To continue and consolidate this success, we have sharpened our strategy in line with our proven strengths and integrated the key issues of the future and the changing needs of our stakeholders even more firmly into our business model.\n\nEmmi purpose\n\nEmmi strategy\n\nJohan Ewijk, the founder of Bettinehoeve, started making fine cheese on his farm with just two goats. 40 years later, the company processes around 65 million kg of goat’s milk from over 55 regional farms each year. Bettinehoeve exports its specialities to the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Belgium and the Nordic countries. With around 140 employees, the goat’s milk manufacturer also creates important added value, especially for farmers and partners in the local areal.\n\nBettinehoeve has been part of the Emmi Group since February 2016 and has been wholly owned by Emmi since April 2022. This has helped us to further strengthen our global goat’s milk network in an important growth segment.\n\nbettine.nl\n\nWe have been supplying Mcdonald’s Switzerland with selected specialties for almost 20 years. The quality of this long-standing relationship is also reflected in the results of the company’s annual supplier audit, with the chain – which was founded in 1940 as a snack bar – awarding Emmi “Supplier of the year 2021”. Emmi achieves a score of 100% – something no partner has ever achieved before.\n\nEmmi acquired Athenos, the number 1 in the US feta business, strengthening our strategically important specialty cheese business in our most important foreign market. The Athenos feta range perfectly complements the extensive selection of high-quality, locally produced as well as imported speciality cheeses in our business in north America. We are also creating additional export opportunities for Swiss cheese thanks to our strengthened distribution capacity.\n\nMedia release\n\nathenos.com\n\nEmmi and WWF Switzerland extend the partnership initiated in 2016 for a further three years. WWF will therefore continue to provide Emmi with strategic support on the way to achieving its ambitious goals in the areas of climate and energy, food waste and establishing a sustainable dairy industry beyond Switzerland.\n\nThis is based on a shared vision of a food system that respects the Earth’s ecological limits. The collaboration with WWF has helped Emmi to continue its tradition of building a business model aligned to broad sustainability initiatives backed by science-based targets, and pursuing a net-zero reduction path with a 2050 horizon.\n\nMedia release\n\nAt the World Cheese Awards (WCA) in Ovideo, Spain, 26 cheese specialities from Emmi achieve a place on the podium. Five of them even win a gold medal, such as Kaltbach Rahmkäse, which is matured in the sandstone cave. As a producer of a wide variety of specialty cheeses and Switzerland’s largest cheese trader, Emmi markets its cheeses around the world and uses the annual WCA platform to inspire people to enjoy cheese.\n\nworldcheeseawards.com\n\nEmmi is committed to a circular economy as part of its sustainability model. Our goal is to use only recyclable packaging by 2027 and to increase the share of recycled materials to at least 30%. Emmi is starting with its successful Emmi Caffè Latte brand. Since September the cups have contained a proportion of recycled polypropylene. A first step in the right direction.\n\nMedia release\n\nOur cave masters in Kaltbach are now using solar energy and a local “AOP eco-cheese” network to produce our cheese specialties – from the farm, through production in the cheese dairy, to cave maturing. The centrepiece is a new photovoltaic system installed on the production building in Kaltbach. This complements the solar-powered production of Emmentaler AOP at the nearby traditional Schlierbach cheese dairy, whose local milk suppliers are also increasingly switching to solar energy.\n\nMedia release\n\nWe have also set ourselves ambitious targets for reducing our own greenhouse gas emissions. We aim to reduce these by 60% by 2027, relying heavily on renewable energies. For products manufactured at the Emmen site, such as Emmi Aktifit and Luzerner Rahmkäse, solar energy will now be used to supplement the existing wood chip-fired heating system. The source is 1,440 photovoltaic modules on the roofs of the Amstutz buildings, which produce around 500,000 kilowatt hours of electricity per year.\n\nMedia release\n\namstutzholzenergie.ch\n\nAt our traditional location in Emmen, we are investing 50 million Swiss francs in the construction of a new cheese factory. It will replace the existing cheese dairy building and provide space for highly professional and resource-saving cheese production. In line with our long-term growth plans, we are thus creating additional capacity and regional added value.\n\nMedia release\n\nThe Emmi Sustainability Award was first conferred in 2012 and is now open to all of Emmi’s almost 8,700 employees worldwide. Besides raising awareness of sustainability issues relevant to Emmi, this format aims to help the company achieve its sustainability goals through specific projects.\n\nMore than 20 projects from seven countries were submitted this year and evaluated by a jury including internal and external experts from WWF Switzerland and the Energy Agency Swiss Private Sector (EnAW), for example.\n\nThis year’s first prize was awarded to a project implemented at the Ostermundigen production site that massively reduces the consumption of cleaning agents and water. Other prize winners came from Italy, the US and Kirchberg (Switzerland).\n\nemmi.com\n\nWinner project from Ostermundigen\n\nPasticceria Quadrifoglio, which has been part of the Emmi Group since 2019, operates two production sites in the Modena area. Due to good growth prospects, including within Emmi’s dessert network in Italy and, more recently, also in the US, the “Quadrilatero” project was launched to expand production capacity at the Campogalliano site. The expansion will also be innovative from a sustainability perspective. For example, “Quadrilatero” will be the first production facility within the Emmi family to be “net zero” from the outset. The expansion is scheduled to be completed by the end of 2022.\n\nFrance has had some quite specific tastes when it comes to the coffee it consumes. For a long time, “café au lait” was only drunk with breakfast. But after some delay, the trend for chilled coffee drinks also took hold a few years ago.\n\nEmmi too has been serving this market since 2019, with chilled coffee drinks from Ostermundigen under the “Republic of Blends” brand. This brand not only emphasises coffee expertise but also achieves clear differentiation from the generic term “caffe latte”.\n\nWith its listing with Carrefour, Europe’s second-largest retailer with a strong foothold in its home market of France, Republic of Blends has the best prospects for more than just a summer fairy tale.\n\nemmi-republicofblends.fr\n\nTwo new members were elected to the Board of Directors of Emmi AG at the General Meeting on 22 April 2021: Dominik Bürgy, a lawyer and qualified tax expert, and Thomas Grüter, a master farmer. They succeed long-standing members of the Board of Directors Christian Arnold and Niklaus Meier, who did not stand for re-election.\n\nMedia release\n\nMany consumers want less sugar in their products, but still want to treat themselves to something indulgent. So it’s a yes to less sugar, a no to artificially sweetened products, and generally also a no to products with significantly less sugar. A different approach seems to be showing some promise: sweet, yes, but with no artificial or granulated sugar.\n\nAn alternative to sugar is the answer here. But agave, maple syrup and co. have about the same effect on the body as granulated sugar. But this isn’t the case with the new date-sweetened Emmi JogurtPur. That’s because the dates are dried as whole fruits and finely ground. Because of this, they not only add sweetness to the yogurt but also vital nutrients.\n\nemmi-pur.ch\n\nOats, with their sweet, cereal-like taste, are a popular milk alter-native. But a large proportion of these products are produced abroad or manufactured here in Switzerland using imported oats. Not so with the oat products from our vegan brand beleaf. These drinks and yogurt alternatives use oats produced regionally in Switzerland as their key ingredient. We are therefore not only generating local added value; we are also improving our ecological footprint thanks to short transport routes, with Swissness as a mark of differentiation.\n\nMedia release (only in German)\n\nbeleaf.ch\n\nQuillayes and Surlat, two major, successful Chilean milk processors, joined forces in early 2020. The Emmi Group company now operates under the name Quillayes Surlat and, with around 800 employees and sales of around CHF 180 million, is number four in the country.\n\nFollowing the merger of the two companies, the process of gradually merging core activities such as production and logistics began. Since the beginning of 2021, the company has been managed from the joint headquarters in Santiago de Chile, in order to create solid foundations for a shared corporate culture with a focus on growth.\n\nquillayessurlat.cl\n\nThe artisan Cowgirl Creamery and Cypress Grove in California are among the Emmi Group’s drivers of innovation. Their efforts to continually surprise consumers with sophisticated creations were honoured not once but twice at this year’s edition of The Specialty Food Association’s sofi™ Awards. Cowgirl Creamery’s Organic Clabbered Cottage Cheese and Cypress Grove’s Fog Lights both received awards from the panel of experts.\n\nList of the Winners of the sofi Awards\n\ncowgirlcreamery.com\n\nBy using renewable energy at all its locations around the world, Emmi is significantly reducing CO2 emissions. Emmi’s operations in Switzerland have already been supplied exclusively with European hydropower since 2017 (-14,800 tonnes of CO2). In 2018, all locations in Europe followed suit (-17,600 tonnes of CO2). Since the beginning of 2021, renewable energy has also been procured as standard for Emmi Group companies in North and South America, which will reduce CO2 emissions by a further 19,000 tonnes.\n\nEmmi raises the bar yet again in terms of its commitment to sustainability, with extended targets up to 2027. In addition to further reducing our environmental impact and now also our water consumption, we have also extended our commitment to sustainable dairy farming at Group level. Furthermore, we have set new reduction targets along the entire value chain based on the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and switched to a net zero reduction path with the netZERO 2050 vision.\n\nMedia release\n\nemmi.com/sustainability\n\nSince the end of 2020, Emmi has been using two of the world’s first hydrogen-powered lorries from Hyundai. Emmi believes this technology has the potential to lead to a more sustainable future for freight transport by road. Sustainable transport and mobility solutions are an important element for Emmi in achieving its new emissions target of reducing its CO2 emissions by 60 % by 2027. Every hydrogen-powered lorry that replaces a conventional diesel lorry will save around 70 to 80 tonnes of CO2 per year.\n\nemmi.com/nachhaltigkeit\n\nEmmi is strengthening its presence in Switzerland and investing CHF 50 million in its traditional location in Emmen. A new building will replace the more than 40-year-old cheese dairy building, providing space for highly professional and resource-saving cheese production and creating additional capacities in line with the company’s long-term growth plans. Construction work began in November 2020, with commissioning planned for the end of 2022.\n\nMedia release\n\nOver the past few years, Emmi has built up a new strategic pillar in Italian speciality desserts. Starting with the acquisition of A-27 in 2012, a network of Italian dessert manufacturers has been gradually established, which now operates under the umbrella of Emmi Dessert Italia.\n\nThe acquisition of US company Indulge Desserts means Emmi can now become part of the world’s largest dessert market, extend its footprint in the United States and open up new distribution opportunities for its Italian desserts. The company, which is based in the Greater New York area, has a wide range of high-quality desserts and generates annual sales of between USD 80 million and 90 million.\n\nMedia release\n\nCaffè Latte is Emmi’s best known and most successful brand. Since it was launched 15 years ago, things have changed in chilled coffee drinks, particularly in terms of flavour based on freshly roasted coffee beans and perfectly brewed coffee thanks, among other things, to gently roasted coffee beans and freshly brewed coffee.\n\nCaution is therefore needed when it comes to changing recipes. But Emmi has now decided to use a new manufacturing process it has developed itself to simplify recipes: since autumn 2020, no additives such as stabilising agents or preservatives have been used in the majority of the Emmi Caffè Latte range.\n\nemmi.com\n\nEmmi used the United Nations' World Environment Day as a platform for the first-ever Emmi Sustainability Day. Emmi employees worldwide committed to driving forward positive changes for the environment and more sustainable development.\n\nEach location had a different focus in its actions for a better world. For example, three bee colonies now live on the company premises in Kirchberg and Gläserne Molkerei has planted apple trees in its courtyard garden. The staff at the headquarters in Lucerne assessed their individual environmental footprint with the help of WWF Switzerland. They concluded that they performed better than the average Swiss citizen, but that they still had a lot of work to do.\n\nVideo: Emmi Sustainability Day 2020\n\nMore and more people are eating a body-conscious diet and want to support their active, sporty lifestyle with protein-rich foods. But they want these foods to taste great as well. This trend is an opportunity for Emmi products. Because here, functionality is never at the cost of quality and pleasure.\n\nEmmi has therefore expanded its range with innovations on three fronts: a new drink containing high-quality whey proteins, a high-protein variant of Emmi Caffè Latte and a protein drink developed in collaboration with the Swiss sports nutrition specialist Sponser Sport Food. All products must meet two criteria: they need to be body conscious and great tasting.\n\nMedia release\n\nCoffee is inextricably linked with Italy. Italians have shaped the global coffee culture. But they have also managed to stick with their own coffee habits. While most coffee-lovers generally like either espresso or white coffee, in Italy it is the time of day that determines which is drunk.\n\nItalians are though open to enjoying a coffee dessert after eating rather than a hot espresso. Inspired by this, Emmi Dessert Italia have launched a fitting range. In a glass espresso cup – for the perfect espresso moment!\n\nemmidessert.it\n\nThe Emmi General Meeting 2020 was planning to host 1,800 guests. As a result of the ban on events due to coronavirus, however, the huge event took on a much smaller scale.\n\nThe attendees included the chairman of the Board of Directors, the independent proxy, a representative of the auditors and the secretary of the Board of Directors.\n\nThe shareholders were of course still able to vote: in advance – in writing or online. In this way, all the proposals were approved by a large majority.\n\nMedia release\n\nEmmi’s Swiss facilities alone use around 600 million yogurt cups each year. Most of these cups are made of polystyrene.\n\nAs recycling systems for this type of cup are often deficient, Emmi is committed to finding more environmentally friendly solutions. With the “Seda Paper Cup”, an internal project team has developed a promising alternative that produces around 60 % less CO2-emissions, with comparable product protection.\n\nThe cup's initial use for exports of the beleaf brand, which was coordinated by the Development, Production and Marketing teams, was awarded the Emmi Sustainability Award.\n\nemmi.com/sustainability\n\nGläserne Molkerei in Germany followed in the footsteps of its parent company in Switzerland in 2018, launching its own additive-free Bio-JoghurtPur.\n\nIn the year following its launch, sales of JoghurtPur rose rapidly in line with its popularity. Reason enough for Gläserne Molkerei to expand its range with a version enriched with organic cream in three new flavours.\n\nThe icing on the cake of this success story came when readers of the German trade journal Milchmarketing named it “product of the year”.\n\nMedia release\n\nglaeserne-molkerei.de\n\nMore and more consumers are eating vegetarian or vegan food from time to time. In response to this trend, Emmi is launching its own vegan line under the brand Beleaf.\n\nThe yogurt alternatives, drinks and shakes based on almonds or oats offer even more variety for all those who value a varied diet. Emmi Caffè Drink Almond Macchiato is a further highlight for vegan food fans.\n\nVegan is nothing new for Emmi. In Switzerland, it has been producing a variety of almond, cashew and lupin-based plant products for its trading partners since the 1990s. With its plant-based brand products, Emmi is servicing a segment of its home market that has been heavily influenced by imported products in the past.\n\nMedia release\n\nbeleaf.eu\n\nemmicaffelatte.ch\n\n“Only the best come to Kaltbach” – this motto underlies the decision as to which cheeses are matured in the famous sandstone cave. Because only the highest-quality wheels are suitable for the long cave ageing and warrant the considerable effort producing such an extraordinary result.\n\nAppenzeller® is the third “big” Swiss cheese speciality to join the exclusive range of Kaltbach cave-aged specialities.\n\nemmi-kaltbach.com\n\nEvery year, the Lucerne Compensation Office, IV Lucerne and wira Lucerne present the WAS IV Awards to companies that strive to integrate people with disabilities. Emmi has been consistently implementing internal integration projects for years and has now received the IV Award for its efforts. Emmi will double the prize money and use it for further projects to benefit people with disabilities.\n\nMedia release\n\nVideo: IV Award Emmi Schweiz AG\n\nOn 10 February – two weeks before the first confirmed case of coronavirus in Switzerland – Emmi began raising awareness among its employees and introducing additional hygiene and protective measures. All efforts were focused on protecting employees and maintaining production.\n\nThe strong networking of the central crisis team and subsidiaries made it possible to share knowledge. Experience from Italy, the European country that was hit first and particularly hard by the coronavirus crisis, proved especially valuable. As a result, the Emmi companies in the USA and South America were well prepared when the virus began to spread to them a few weeks later.\n\nemmi.com\n\nAs part of its sustainability strategy, Emmi has set the goal of reducing its global CO2-emissions by 25 % by the end of 2020. The emphasis is on implementing measures in Emmi's own production sites to reduce direct emissions from the use of fossil fuels (scope 1) and associated indirect emissions from the production of electricity and heat (scope 2).\n\nEmmi provides transparent and detailed information on emissions, measures and progress, for example through participation in the “Carbon Disclosure Project”.\n\nThis organisation awarded Emmi's emissions data a B- rating. This puts Emmi ahead of the pack compared with the average grade of C within the food industry and within Europe (all companies based in Europe).\n\nemmi.com/sustainability\n\nLe Gruyère AOP is the most popular Swiss cheese – both at home and abroad. The magazine “al dente” asked six cheese specialists to taste a selection of cheeses matured for eight to 12 months.\n\nKALTBACH Le Gruyère AOP emerged as the favourite thanks to its rich spectrum of aromas, intense flavour and salt crystals, which are appreciated by connoisseurs and denote its long maturation period.\n\nStory: Gruyère – top after 12 months\n\nEmmi has operated the cheese dairy in Landquart and the associated Grisons mountain cheese warehouse since 2003. Over the last 15 years, the operation has not only developed into the largest raclette cheese dairy in Switzerland, but also produces “Switzerland Swiss”, which is popular in the US. Around 350,000 wheels of raclette cheese, 80,000 wheels of mountain cheese and 10,000 wheels of Swiss-type cheese are matured in the warehouse. In 2019, thanks to rising demand, the volume of milk processed in Landquart exceeded 100 million kilogrammes for the first time. This milk is sourced from around 650 dairy farmers in the surrounding area (Grisons, St. Gallen, Glarus and Schwyz).\n\nMedia release\n\nConsumers should be able to see who is behind Emmi’s milk products. These are numerous farming families from all over Switzerland. And with around 6,000 milk suppliers, almost all consumers in Switzerland have an Emmi farmer in their immediate vicinity. To strengthen the bond between Emmi and these farming families, over 250 milk producers already showcase their farms on the Emmi website. In 2019, Emmi launched the online competition “Take the cow out to pasture”. Christian Hitz received the most virtual cows. On his real pasture farm in Untersiggenthal, Aargau, he keeps around 80 Holstein cows. The animals are housed in accordance with the additional requirements of the two state-controlled animal welfare labels RAUS and BTS (stables).\n\nemmi.com/sustainability\n\nEmmi is the largest cheese retailer in Switzerland and markets its cheeses around the world. One way of making foreign retailers and consumers aware of its cheeses is to take part in competitions – for example, the annual World Cheese Awards. At the world’s largest cheese industry competition in 2019, cheese specialties from the Emmi range won a total of 26 awards.\n\nMedia release\n\nSurlat, Emmi’s Chilean subsidiary, produces a wide range of dairy and fresh products at its facilities in Pitrufquen. After about one year of planning and construction, a new warehouse was put into operation at the site. It houses capacity for 4,000 pallets. This investment will enable growing demand to be met even more efficiently.\n\nsurlat.cl\n\nTraining as a dairy technologist is challenging. It requires interest in biological and chemical processes, quality awareness, conscientiousness and technological flair. And last but not least, a dairy technologist needs to be able to tackle everyday production work. Talented new recruits are therefore in great demand in the industry. Such talents were on display at the first “SwissSkills” professional championships for dairy technologists. Emmi supported this event as the main sponsor.\n\nmilchtechnologe.ch\n\nIn 2016, Emmi set itself the goal of introducing a sustainability standard for its Swiss cow’s milk suppliers by 2020. This vision motivated the industry and resulted in the nationwide “swissmilk green” sustainability standard, which Emmi welcomes and supports as an important first step. By 2022, all Swiss dairy farmers are expected to make additional sustainability efforts that benefit animals and the environment in particular. In return, they will receive a supplement of 3 centimes per kilogramme of milk (in the “A segment”). A good three-quarters of Emmi’s milk suppliers currently meet the new sustainability requirements.\n\nswissmilk.ch\n\nThe Brazilian dairy Laticínios Porto Alegre in Antonio Carlos built its new production facilities in the record time of just 13 months. Yogurt and fresh cheese will mainly be produced there in future, including Moments – a Brazilian version of Emmi Moments, the gourmet yogurt popular in Switzerland. The factory was opened on 26 September 2019. In the launch phase, around 100 people will work in Antonio Carlos.\n\nlaticiniosportoalegre.com.br\n\nTo supply customers with fresh goods on a daily basis, Emmi lorries cover a great number of kilometres every year. Emmi is committed to making this transport as environmentally friendly as possible. The electromobility advertised for passenger cars is not a practicable solution for freight vehicles in the foreseeable future. However, hydrogen could offer a potential alternative to conventional fuels. It combines environmental benefits with a high degree of practicality – especially thanks to the simple refuelling process and long range. Emmi is therefore becoming a member of the H2 Mobility Switzerland Association in the aim of promoting developments in this area.\n\nh2mobilitaet.ch\n\nFour young women have been training as road transport specialists in Ostermundigen since August 2019. This is remarkable: not only is there a general lack of new recruits, but the occupation has long been a male bastion. Together with three other apprentices in Emmen, these women are part of Emmi’s 95-strong team of drivers in Switzerland.\n\nemmi.com/apprenticeships\n\nStrengthening its international presence is a key pillar of Emmi’s strategy. Some of the desired growth is to be achieved in growth markets in Latin America. Emmi is present in the Chilean market in the form of local company Surlat. In August 2019, Surlat agreed to merge with its competitor Quillayes. The two companies complement each other perfectly. While Surlat has a strong position in the fresh products sector, where it has also made a name for itself with lactose-free products, Quillayes offers a very extensive portfolio of cheeses. Cumulatively, the two companies posted sales of around 120,000 million Chilean pesos (approx. CHF 170 million) in 2018.\n\nMedia release\n\nEmmi has been a sponsor of the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup since the 2009/10 season. Emmi Caffè Latte has been visible in the start or finish areas, on hoardings or on start numbers at up to 40 races a year across Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Italy, France and Norway. Following a successful third-party sponsorship arrangement, Emmi Caffè Latte is the new main sponsor of three-time world champion and Olympic gold medallist Wendy Holdener, from Oberiberg in Switzerland, starting in the 2019/20 season.\n\nwendyholdener.ch\n\nItalian specialty desserts represent an important strategic pillar for Emmi. With the acquisition of Pasticceria Quadrifoglio in Modena, Emmi is expanding and strengthening its network consisting of A-27, Rachelli and Italian Fresh Foods. The family business sells its patisserie desserts and ice cream through the food retail trade and the food service channel in Italy. It has around 90 employees and posted net sales of some EUR 19 million in 2018.\n\npasticceriaquadrifoglio.com\n\nEmmi is increasing its stake in Laticínios Porto Alegre Indústria e Comércio S.A. from 40% to 70%. The dairy is active in the segments natural cheese, mozzarella and fresh cheese (“Requeijão”), UHT milk, cream, butter and whey powder. Since Emmi acquired a stake in the company in July 2017, it has performed well and is now among the top three dairies in its region. With this transaction, Emmi is strengthening its presence in Latin America and building further bridges beyond its existing presence in Chile and Mexico.\n\nlaticiniosportoalegre.com.br\n\nUnder the Toni’s brand, mozzarella and fresh cheese spread is now available at Coop in three varieties. What sets Toni’s apart from the competition? It’s a real Swiss brand. Despite a milk surplus, most of the fresh cheese spreads consumed in Switzerland come from abroad. In addition to offering “swissness”, Toni’s aims to win over consumers with a creamy consistency, a delicious taste and good value for money.\n\ntonis.ch\n\nMedia release\n\nWith a 66% stake in the Austrian organic goat’s milk and sheep’s milk processor Leeb Biomilch GmbH (“Leeb”), Emmi is strengthening its position in the market for goat’s milk products. With this acquisition, Emmi is also expanding its range to include organic vegan products. Leeb currently has around 50 employees and generates sales of over EUR 15 million. The two previous owners Hubert Leeb and Jörg Hackenbuchner will continue to hold shares in the company and will remain active in their current roles as managing directors.\n\nleeb-milch.at\n\nMedia release\n\nAlmost everyone who spent their childhood in Switzerland between 1970 and 2000 remembers the colourful little man from the ice cream advertisement. Between 1974 and 1999, Tom, Magic, Pierino and co. were produced in Ostermundigen. And after an almost 20-year hiatus, the cult brand has been breathed back into life there.\n\nThe mascot Pierrot is designed to evoke childhood memories and feelings of nostalgia. So that the children of yesteryear buy Pierrot for themselves and share the love with the children of today.\n\npierrot-glace.ch\n\nFifteen years on the market and not tired at all! In 2019, fans of cold coffee drinks were in for a treat. In the spring of 2019, two new products were launched on the market: Emmi Caffè Latte Colombia Edition and Emmi Caffè Latte Cold Brew. The special thing about the last one: the coffee is “brewed” with cold water for twelve hours. The effect, thanks to this process, is that the coffee is less acidic. At the same time, coffee prepared in this way needs less sugar.\n\nemmi-caffelatte.com/uk\n\nMedia release\n\nAccording to a study by consumer research institute GfK, Emmi enjoys an excellent reputation among the Swiss population. Emmi was voted the ninth most popular company alongside firms such as Migros, Rivella and Geberit. For this ranking, around 3,500 people were surveyed and companies from a wide range of industries were included – including pharmaceutical firms and banks.\n\ngfk.com\n\nMore and more consumers are becoming aware of what they eat. But this awareness can take very different forms. Some people pay meticulous attention to the number of calories consumed, while others consider a balanced diet to consist of the widest possible range of foods. Pleasure also has its place in such a diet. And this is where Emmi Moments comes in, the new yogurt in the flavours chocolate, caramel, strawberry and lemon cheesecake.\n\nemmi-moments.ch\n\nMedia release\n\nEmmi and dairy farmers belong together. This is demonstrated by the “Farmers as ambassadors” campaign. Some 60 Emmi milk suppliers are presented to the public, with everyone able to support their favourite by voting for them online. Brothers Aaron and Jonas Ruprecht, who run a dairy and arable farm with 95 Holstein cows, receive the most votes.\n\nbauernbotschafter.emmi.com\n\nAfter a project to introduce SAP as the enterprise resource planning (ERP) system for all Emmi’s Swiss sites, the systems at the foreign subsidiaries are to be integrated more closely with those of their parent company over the next few years. This will be made possible by a standardised, lean ERP system. The first go live at Emmi UK in London is a success.\n\nThe easy-to-prepare Gerber fondue has been extremely popular since the 1960s. The recipe of this classic dish has now been adapted in line with the trend towards making products as natural as possible. It no longer contains emulsifiers, which were previously used to enhance the stability and shelf life of the product.\n\ngerbercheese.ch\n\nOver the past eight years, Emmi has acquired no less than three dessert manufacturers in the greater Milan area. They are now united under one roof: Emmi Dessert Italia. This is the first time that Emmi has carried out such a comprehensive merger of different companies outside Switzerland. The bundling of know-how and innovative strength will support the continued successful development of the dessert business.\n\nemmidessert.it\n\nThe people of Graubünden are rightly proud of their mountain cheese. There are many different varieties, mostly from small producers. One of the cheeses has made it to Kaltbach. Thirty farmers from across the region supply their milk to Lataria Engiadinaisa in Bever – one of the highest dairies in Europe. There, the milk is made into mountain cheese according to a tried-and-tested recipe and stored for 70 days before being sent to the Kaltbach cave for refinement.\n\nemmi-kaltbach.com\n\nMedia release\n\nThe milk in Emmi products comes from 6,000 farmers all over Switzerland – from Vaud to Grisons, from Schaffhausen to Uri. Each of these regions has its own characteristics, not least when it comes to language. The wide range of dialects are part of Swiss culture, and for many people form part of their personal identity. With milk packaging in twelve different dialects, Emmi brings this popular topic to the breakfast table in autumn 2018.\n\nMedia release in German\n\nKaiku, which is part of the Emmi Group, has held a stake in the second-largest Tunisian milk processor, Centrale Laitière de Mahdia SA (“Vitalait”), since 2012. Emmi and the other Kaiku shareholders decide to increase their stake in Vitalait from 45.4 % to 54.7 %, and then to 64.0 % in 2021.\n\nfacebook.com/vitalait.tn\n\nMedia release\n\nAround 20 % of employees have been with Emmi for more than 20 years. Christian Zaugg has been with the company the longest. He represents a whole host of employees who have supported Emmi for decades, and the cheese dispatcher in Kirchberg will continue to contribute his expertise and experience to the company in 2018.\n\nMore than 3,000 cheeses from 31 countries go head to head at this year’s World Cheese Awards in London. Emmi puts selected Swiss cheeses before the jury, along with several cheese specialities from the United States and the Netherlands, and picks up a total of 16 awards. The cave-aged KALTBACH cheeses were successful once again, winning two gold medals and a silver.\n\ngff.co.uk\n\nMedia release\n\nEmmi takes a majority stake in Mexican trading company Mexideli.\n\nFind out more >\n\nEmmi increases its stake in Mexideli from 50 % to 51 %. It now holds a majority stake in Mexico’s leading importer of premium food products. The company is very well established after nearly 30 years of successful operation in this market. Mexideli helps Emmi strengthen its position in an attractive, growing market and increases the potential for exporting Emmi Group products – currently Swiss cheese and Italian desserts – to Mexico.\n\nMedia release\n\nFederal Councillor Alain Berset, Cantonal Councillor for Lucerne Guido Graf and the Social Security and Health Committee of the Council of States take a tour of the Kaltbach cave at the invitation of the outgoing Chairman of the Committee and Chairman of the Emmi Board of Directors, Konrad Graber. Anyone can make an appointment to visit the unique cave and discover the secret of the premium cheese with the black rind.\n\nemmi-kaltbach.com\n\nGerber ready-made fondues are well-established in Swiss food culture. First launched back in the 1960s, they are now the most popular fondue in Switzerland. This is no surprise, since they are practical and perfect every time. However, demand for fresh fondue mixes is constantly increasing. Emmi aims to impress fondue fans with the new Gerber Mélange Maison fresh fondue. High-quality speciality cheeses and Swiss apricot brandy – which is used instead of Kirsch – give the fondue a unique taste.\n\ngerbercheese.com\n\nMedia release\n\nFounded in 1995, investment company ÖKOVISION LUX S.A. invests solely on sustainable principles. Investment decisions are based on the ÖKOVISION investment universe, made up of companies selected by an independent investment committee. It currently comprises 350 companies. Emmi recently became one of them and has now also been awarded the ÖKOVISION Sustainability Leadership Award.\n\noekovision25.de\n\nMedia release\n\nThe current trend is for healthy eating and sensible indulgence – alongside practical, time-saving convenience products. Ready-to-eat desserts are therefore extremely popular. Emmi believes this segment has considerable potential for high-quality, innovative products and is therefore launching a new range of desserts: Ooola Secrets. To this end, a completely new production line has been installed in Emmen, near Lucerne.\n\nMedia release\n\nDaily routines that don’t allow for set mealtimes are becoming commonplace. As is eating on the go – while driving, on the train or when walking. Consumers are therefore increasingly turning towards convenience products that are not only practical and save time, but that are also of great quality and made with natural ingredients.\n\nemmi-pur.ch\n\nMedia release\n\nLaticínios Porto Alegre is set to become Emmi’s second strong base in South America after Surlat in Chile. Its size, profitability and market position are a great fit for Emmi and its strategy: the company is one of the five largest dairies in its key market of Minas Gerais, which is comparable in size to the French market. It is well positioned in the cheese, fresh cheese, UHT milk, butter and whey powder product categories. The stake in Porto Alegre gives Emmi a presence in a market with an attractive long-term outlook.\n\nlaticiniosportoalegre.com.br\n\nMedia release\n\nThe migration of sales processes to SAP in January 2017 marks the final step in the OneERP journey. After around four years of hard work, Emmi officially brings the project to a close at the end of March 2017. SAP is rolled out as planned to all major Swiss production facilities and selected departments. More than 1,500 Emmi employees now use the new OneERP tools in their work.\n\nCypress Grove, the Arcata-based subsidiary, is the first Californian Emmi company to launch the proven Operational Excellence programme. The company doesn’t just want to distinguish itself as a manufacturer of top quality goat’s cheese – it also aims to come top in making processes even more efficient, reducing waste and saving costs.\n\nEmmi has grown to become the leading supplier of Italian dessert specialities in recent years with A-27 and Rachelli. Northern Italian company Italian Fresh Foods (IFF) is yet another building block in Emmi’s pursuit of this niche strategy. IFF generates the majority of its sales abroad, as do Emmi’s other Italian dessert producers. Gaining access to Emmi’s international distribution network will therefore be the main source of growth opportunities for IFF.\n\nitalianfreshfoods.it\n\nMedia release"
