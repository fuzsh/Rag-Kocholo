        "text": "I guess me, stitch and mack are the only ones who are gonna consistently do predicts every week, and with that being said, here's mine for the week.\n\nPredicts!\n\nLavender Laprases (4) vs Bayern Munchlax (6)\n\nUbers: halaman95 vs 7u9i2 - Putting Halaman in ubers seems like an odd choice, as they mainly seem to play ou. 7u9i2 may have had somewhat lucky wins in a couple of the past weeks, but they know the tier and can play it solidly. Despite ending their win streak with trade last week, 7u9i2 traded their potential win vs trade last week for a win vs halaman this week. Ah yes, equivalent(?) exchange.\n\nOU: queso vs ToastedBunzzz02 - This battle is a grilled cheese sandwich. This is an hl match simply for it being a battle between 2 food based usernames, and being a bit of a tossup too I guess. This should be close since I think toasted is the better overall player, yet cheese is an actual ou player with more experience in the tier. Could easily see it going either way, but I'll give the ever so slight edge to toastedbunz while the cheese on this grilled cheese sandwich proceeds to melt. On that note, I haven't had breakfast yet and this is making me hungry.\n\nOU: henguinie vs Expulso - So we have a mono player vs a lower tiers player, playing in ou. Interesting choices were made. I won't base this much on blt. Expulso is a lower tiers player primarily, though a solid player overall who is currently in round 2 of slam playoffs, while bdlol has been good in the past, I haven't seen much from them at all lately. Expulso should slam bdlol because of this, even if this isn't the right tour for slamming.\n\nUU: TMM vs Sets - Tmm has had a very up and down blt so far while I believe sets is only just now making an appearance. From what I know, sets is a lower tiers mains who's decent, while Tmm is a very solid uu main with a lot of knowledge and experience in the tier. I don't see tmm losing here.\n\nRU: Mac3 vs yovan33321 - Bit of an hl match. Both are great ru players and I expect this to be good, but the main difference between yovan and mac is that mac is a goat. Yovan is not a goat, not compared to mac3 anyways. Because of this, I think mac should win here. Sorry yovan, you may be good, but not goated.\n\nNU: Xiri vs roxiee - Another hl, though I'm feeling pretty confident about who wins here. Roxiee is another player who's had a very up and down blt so far while Xiri is currently 4-0. Roxiee is a solid nu main with plenty of experience, and being a decent player overall, and while Xiri is a bit less of an nu main and more of a lower tiers player, but they're definitely the better player overall comparing what I've seen from both in the past and personally. So I'm thinking Xiri should win here, but I expect this to be good.\n\nPU: tlenit vs gum - Hl match, and please, don't sub out gum this time, I really want to see this. Anyways, its odd that 2 of the best pu players have been doing pretty abysmal in blt so far. Poor tlenit keeps losing by hax or bad mu, and gum is 1-1. Both are very solid pu mains but I think tlenit may be just a bit better as a player and with experience, but this could go either way imo. I pray we have a good, non-haxy game, PLEASE.\n\nLC: Surfy vs p4P1//0n - This should be good. Surfy is yet another player who has had their ups and downs, while pap is currently 3-1, having only lost to mikaav so far. Both of these players are good in lc but I think I'm gonna give it to pap based on their blt performance so far in comparison to surfy's. Pap has has the more impressive wins vs harder opponents, though I wouldn't sleep on surfy as he's done well in lc elsewhere.\n\nDOU: Zoaw vs Shadowmonstr7 - Despite the fact Zoaw came off last week with a huge upset vs ttt, I think shadow still wins here, as I think they're the better, more consistent and more experienced overall dou player. Sorry Zoaw.\n\nMonotype: ChessRobot vs Meta - Chessrobot has been doing good so far with 2 wins but there's no way they're winning against frickin meta. Meta is one of, if not the best mono player in the pool, while chessrobot isn't even in the pool, the water would cause them to malfunction. Chessrobot's 2 wins were unimpressive, while meta has been dominating the competition and I don't think they'll ever stop.\n\nAnistar Articunos (4) vs Sunyshore Snorlaxes (6)\n\nUbers: Trade vs FatFighter2 - Major hl match! Fat has been doing well in ubers lately, even if they're now 2-2, so by all means I expect this to be good but Trade, who can just play anything like an absolute goat, has for the most part been dominating, only losing 1 match to hax against the best ubers player in the pool. I think trade wins here because trade is trade and trade = goated.\n\nOU: crying vs TectonicDestroyer - These 2 have been doing ok in blt so far. Now comparing the action of flowing tears to a destroyer of tectonic plates, it sounds pretty obvious who'd win from that. But no, inolife is def the better ou player and player overall. Tect is by all means a solid player and good in ou but I think inolife is the better of the 2 and should take it. Though, tect has pulled off quite a few upsets in the past, being the destroyer of tectonic plates and all...\n\nOU: lvl100Blaziken vs Roginald - Here we got 2 players who specialize in both ou and randbats. Frags hasn't shown their best so far, and rogi simply hasn't shown much at all. However, based purely on how I've seen both of them play outside of blt and in the past, I think rogi is the better player and has more experience in ou.\n\nUU: RoyalReloaded vs Mygrein - I honestly haven't been too impressed by rr so far, while mygrein has been doing well very well lately, having only lost to saba and winning from then on. From what I know about both, Mygrein is a relatively solid uu main with a lot of experience while rr not as much. Mygrein has gotten the more impressive wins as well so based on this, I'm giving it to Mygrein.\n\nUU: lkapkd1 vs Hys - Either way, the snorlaxes should still win uu.\n\nRU: moesi vs EternalSnowman - Esm hasn't had a great blt so far facing a stacked ru pool, but this is his time to catch a break. EverlastingIcelad has been playing quite a few ru goats, only picking up his first win last week with a bit of luck (just a bit, it was a good game), but despite that, I think he is quite a bit better than moesi in ru, and as a player, being pretty solid in terms of both while moesi hasn't shown us much. For these reasons, ForeverFrostGuy should get another win here.\n\nNU: Plas vs daniYSB - Speaking of great players who are 1-3, we have 2 of them right here. Both are great players overall, though Dani is definitely a greater, more solid nu main with plenty more experience in the tier than plas. Unfortunately, from what we've seen so far of plas, he can't seem to stand up to the solid nu mains in the pool, so I think dani should win here.\n\nPU: sirmrwhale vs Z Strats - How much sirmrwhale has been dominating this blt is probably the most shocking out of everyone I've seen. I think they've definitely proven they can hold their own in the tier as a relatively solid pu main, but I'm still gonna pick Z Strats here as I just found out he's in pupl and has proven to be quite solid in pu in blt so far. Although, sirmrwhale winning wouldn't surprise me in the least anymore.\n\nLC: Mikaav vs BigBoy038 - Both players here can be considered veterans. Bigboy has done alright so far this blt, and is definitely a solid player in lc and overall, I feel mikaav is definitely better as an lc main and perhaps overall, and I've been more impressed by their performance this blt than bigboy's so far. So I think mikaav takes this.\n\nDOU: RKD vs LightScreener - This strikes me as a match between underrated dou players. This actually seems pretty even but I think I'm gonna give it to lightscreener for the better performance so far. Also, THAT MEW TECH, I bet mish was pretty irk'd by that.\n\nMonotype: PrinceOfAllTacos vs TheGreenRoman - A Prince, especially that of all tacos, is by far superior to some guy from Rome who's green. If TheGreenRoman plays mono, that's news to me, while Poat actually mains mono and is a good player despite not having a great showing so far. Being the better overall player, and a mono main, poat should win this.\n\nRuin Valley Roserades (5) vs Celestic Town Celesteelas (5) (The Roserades will probably win since the steelas tend to have bad luck though)\n\nUbers: Reje vs LTG - Ltg hasn't been doing well in blt at all, while reje is literally the best ubers player in the tour. So reje should take this without question, sorry ltg.\n\nOU: Baloor vs Stareal - Hl match, and what will probably be quite an entertaining one. Both are good players, solid ou mains, and currently 3-1, but I think the one about to become 3-2 and not 4-1 will be baloor. Comparing what I've seen from these 2, Star is the stronger ou main and perhaps the better player overall. Baloor is by all means a good ou player, but he's not the real star here.\n\nOU: Hockey1 vs Pradhaaan - I feel the same can be said here, except for the 3-1 part. Both are solid ou mains, though prad is the stronger ou main and player overall comparing the 2. Despite coming off an unfortunate loss, prad should bounce back and take this. No hockey goals to be scored this time.\n\nUU: Sificon vs avarice - This looks like a good match on paper. These 2 are both good players, however, avarice has had a very unfortunate showing so far and is currently winless. Also, I think sifi has the better grasp on uu than his opponent, so after a win vs z strats, I think sifi will only continue to keep it up this week.\n\nRU: Kyotoshi vs TheFranklin - HL MATCH, huge hl match. Currently undefeated arce goat vs the one who should've been undefeated kygoatoshi. This should be extremely close. Both are very good players who have been dominating the competition in ru. It's hard to say who the better overall player is here, but I think arce9 is better acquainted with the ru meta. Because of that, I'm giving arce9 an ever so slight edge but again, this is really close, kygoatoshi could definitely win here too.\n\nNU: Ninja vs Crow Music - Crow music has had a rough blt, while Ninja has been surprisingly dominant so far. I think I definitely underestimated Ninja in previous weeks as they've shown they can play nu pretty well, even beating dani last week, while crow music hasn't shown us anything truly memorable yet... The crow music won't have any affect on the ninja, who will sneak up on the crow and stealthily kill it. The ninja shall be victorious.\n\nPU: Let's Rumble Shall We vs Splash - This should be good, and potentially close. Both are good players though when comparing the 2, I think splash may be the better player overall despite having the worse record. Also, I think splash has made a bit more of a splash in pu than hellray, that is to say I think he knows the tier better, so I'm giving it to splash, though I could see it going either way.\n\nLC: kythr vs Fille - Hl match. Will we finally get to see Fille the lc goat play in his natural habitat? I think this could be close. Fille, though he has had a rough, winless blt in nu so far, is a fantastic lc player who has quite a few years of experience. Then we have kythr, an absolutely goated player overall who's success in lc seems far more recent, and mostly pertaining to gen 8. From what I know, kythr has had more success in gen 8 lc than fille, like being lc circuit winner. Due to that, being goated overall, and having to play every week in lc while fille has yet to play in lc in this tour, I'm slightly favoring kythr here, though Fille could easily win here too, being a long lived lc goat himself.\n\nDOU: Karnisbroke vs Crunchman - If you're like me, then you also didn't know who Karnisbroke was. I did a bit of research and found out that though they haven't been on smogon for too long they're actually a solid doubles player currently in round 7 of ss dou spring seasonal, which is impressive, along with a few other doubles tours. After watching some replays to get an idea, I think crunchman should win this but I wouldn't be surprised if karn wins, as this seems like it could be close.\n\nMonotype: Kaguya Lys vs giove97 - On the left we have a great, experienced mono player who is currently 4-0 with ongoing momentum, and on the right we have giove who is winless, inconsistent, never got that momentum, and hasn't been doing as much mono lately and more so lc. I'm sorry gi.\n\nPU: TeamCharm vs Hoopa590 - Biggest hl match of the week. 2 players who are hax masters and like bringing wack sets. Lets be real, this will come down to which side gets haxed more.\n\nAnyways, thanks for reading and see you next week.\n\n(Apologies to anyone I may have possibly offended, please do not take these very seriously.)\n\nI feel like doing predicts, take em with a grain of salt unless u r z or kythr\n\nUbers: halaman95 vs 7u9i2- 7 has been nothing if not solid so far in ubers. I think ubers sucks as a meta where every game is lasting like 200 turns but they seem to have the patience for it so props\n\nOU: queso vs ToastedBunzzz02- People sleep on cheese, he's better than people give him credit for, but TB is solid and ill give em a slight edge\n\nOU: henguinie vs Expulso- BDL is again another player than likely deserves some more credit than they get, Expulso has really gotten a lot better this past year though, and is proving it across a lot of tiers\n\nUU: TMM vs Sets- TMM should have a bit more experience here, I wouldn't be surprised if it was close\n\nRU: Mac3 vs yovan33321- HL game, kinda a tossup, both super solid RU (RU pool is pretty stacked)\n\nNU: Xiri vs roxiee- Xiri is playing really well as per usual, and although roxiee is solid NU Xiri should be favored a bit\n\nPU: tlenit vs gum- Another super close MU, gum and tlenit are both really good, I think tlenit will be really motivated for a win after the past few weeks though\n\nLC: Surfy vs p4P1//0n- A lot of BLT is won or lost in the builder. BLT always gets some very solid players, and it's always a question of effort to determine how they'll do. Most of the players in this tour are solid, and in almost every matchup anyone can beat anyone. I like when newer players to the tours scene like pap really try to do well, and prep hard every week. I'm not saying surfy doesn't, and this should be close, but also props to pap for doing well so far.\n\nDOU: Zoaw vs Shadowmonstr7- I really want to bold Zoaw for the upset here, but I gotta stick with shadow. Coming into the tour I thought Zoaw was a bit underrated, and their performances have def been mixed so far. Def a player to watch out for in the future, but I'll stick with shadow for now\n\nMonotype: ChessRobot vs Meta- I don't know enough about Chessrobot tbh, I think that they seem pretty solid, but Meta is 4-0 and a player I have respect for\n\nUbers: Trade vs FatFighter2- FF2 is solid ubers, and I see this as a close HL game, but Trade is one of the best in the tour so I gotta favor\n\nOU: crying vs TectonicDestroyer- Even if tect wins they'll forget to post and it'll be a deadgame... Inolife is very solid and should be favored a bit\n\nOU: lvl100Blaziken vs Roginald- GL HF :) These two should agree to meme\n\nUU: RoyalReloaded vs Mygrein- I lost to royalreloaded, but they have played relatively average since and mygrein should be slightly better versed in the tier\n\nRU: moesi vs EternalSnowman- Bring a breaker that doesn't lose to rocks and you'll be fine\n\nNU: Plas vs daniYSB- in terms of playing ability I'd slightly favor plas, dani is a solid NU main though so ill give them a slight nod here\n\nPU: sirmrwhale vs Z Strats- Undefeated player vs the worst player in this tour. Z's match last week was pretty unfortunate ngl, well played by sifi but clicking specs eball in front of char is ballsy (shows that it is good to keep people honest sometimes)\n\nLC: Mikaav vs BigBoy038- BigBoy is really good and brings solid teams but mikaav has been an lc main for awhile, and bigboy kinda threw last week which gives me some pause\n\nDOU: RKD vs LightScreener- DOU pool has been really good, and really close, and I expect this to be a fun one\n\nMonotype: PrinceOfAllTacos vs TheGreenRoman- Poat\n\nUbers: Reje vs LTG- LTG is rlly nice but I think Reje should be the better player here\n\nOU: Baloor vs Stareal- There's a couple reasons I don't want to pick this one. Star is one of the best ou players in this current pool but I think it'll be close\n\nOU: Hockey1 vs Pradhaaan- Similar levels of playing skill but I slightly favor praad's team choices\n\nUU: Sificon vs avarice- avarice is a really good player who has had a really unfortunate tour, I would not be surprised if they bounced back\n\nRU: Kyotoshi vs TheFranklin- Super high HL for me, Kyo is really good but I think Arce has a little bit less to prove rn. Despite getting haxed last week, I think kyo also slightly mismanaged some points of the game in a pretty good matchup\n\nNU: Ninja vs Crow Music- Closer than people will give this credit for sure. Slight edge bc ninja has had a better blt\n\nPU: Let's Rumble Shall We vs Splash- Almost 50.50, edge to splash\n\nLC: kythr vs Fille- Kythr is by far the second-worst player in this entire tour\n\nDOU: Karnisbroke vs Crunchman- I am so excited for this game. Coming into BLT I did not do enough scouting, and I missed a few really good players in this tour. Crunchman is a really solid dou player, and karn is 100% someone you should not sleep on. These players should both impress, and I'm hoping for a fun one\n\nMonotype: Kaguya Lys vs giove97- Giove pretty cool but Kaguya should be favored here\n\nUbers: Blimax vs Ainzcrad\n\nOU: myjava vs lotiasite\n\nOU: Harshal_08 vs Perish Song\n\nUU: 100%GXE vs Axelsior\n\nRU: Maki vs Malassa\n\nNU: udongirl vs PokeArt2004♥- I don't want to comment on my team's games, but I will say I have been impressed with Pokeart so far. Coming into BLT I was mostly relying on past performances but I don't think any player has shown more growth than pokeart. So far they've shown up with both solid teams and solid play, people gotta stop sleeping. That being said udon is the GOAT and should win\n\nPU: TeamCharm vs Hoopa590\n\nLC: Serene Grace vs Gray\n\nDOU: mammalu vs TTT444\n\nMonotype: Decem vs RichardPepper"
