        "text": "Introduction\n\nCheesecake is a sweet dessert consisting of one or more layers. The main, and thickest layer, consists of a mixture of soft, fresh cheese (typically cream cheese or ricotta), eggs, and sugar. If there is a bottom layer, it often consists of a crust or base made from crushed cookies (or digestive biscuits), graham crackers, pastry, or sometimes sponge cake.It may be baked or unbaked (usually refrigerated)\n\nCheesecake is usually sweetened with sugar and may be flavored in many different ways. It may be flavored by adding vanilla, spices, lemon, chocolate, pumpkin, or other flavors to the cheese layer. Additional flavors and visual appeal may be added by topping the finished pie with fruit, whipped cream, nuts, cookies, fruit sauce, chocolate syrup, or other toppings.\n\nClassification\n\nIronically, modern cheesecake is not usually classified as a cake, despite the name. People who classify it as a torte point to the presence of many eggs, which are the sole source of leavening, as a key factor. For others, the overall structure, with the separate crust, the soft filling, and the absence of flour, is compelling evidence that it is a custard pie. Other sources identify it as a flan or tart.\n\nNational varieties\n\nCheesecakes can be broadly categorized into two basic types: baked and unbaked. Each comes in a variety of styles determined by region:\n\nAfrica\n\nAsia\n\nAsian-style cheesecake flavors include matcha (powdered Japanese green tea), lychee, and mango\n\nIndia\n\nThe Indian state of Odisha is known for chhena poda which is a type of cheesecake made by baking a mixture of chhena – a type of cottage cheese, sugar and nuts.\n\nPhilippines\n\nIt is made with a base of crushed graham crackers and an upper layer of cream cheese and ube halaya (mashed purple yam with milk, sugar, and butter).\n\nJapan\n\nJapanese-style cheesecake relies upon the emulsification of cornstarch and eggs to make a smooth flan-like texture and almost plasticine appearance.\n\nFrance\n\nFrench-style cheesecakes are very light, feature gelatin as a binding ingredient, and are typically only 3 to 5 cm (1 to 2 inches) high. This variety gets its light texture and flavor from Neufchâtel cheese.\n\nGerman\n\nA German Quarkkuchen uses quark cheese made from sour milk.\n\nGreece\n\nIn Greece the cheesecake has been made since antiquity and is now traditionally made using mizithra. There are many regional variants of the mizithropita.\n\nItaly\n\nAncient Roman\n\nstyle cheesecake uses honey and a ricotta-like cheese along with flour and is traditionally shaped into loaves. Some recipes call for bay leaves, which may have been used as a preservative.[citation needed] Italian-style cheesecake uses ricotta or mascarpone cheese, sugar, vanilla extract, and sometimes barley flakes. This type of cheesecake is typically drier than American styles. Small bits of candied fruit are often added.\n\nThe Netherlands and Belgium\n\nPoland\n\nPolish sernik (cheesecake), one of the most popular desserts in Poland, is made primarily using twaróg, Polish quark cheese.\n\nPortugal\n\nThe Portuguese confectionery Queijada is closely related to cheesecake, although smaller in size and prepared with Requeijão, a typically Portuguese cheese.\n\nRussia\n\nRussian\n\nstyle cheesecake (Vatrushka) is in the form of a dough ring and filled with quark or cottage cheese.[19] The tvorozhnaya zapekanka is a crustless baked cheesecake that mixes tvorog (Russian quark), eggs and semolina, and often includes raisins.\n\nSweden\n\nSwedish-style cheesecake differs greatly from other cheesecakes. A Swedish cheesecake is not layered and is traditionally produced by adding rennet to milk and letting the casein coagulate. It is then baked in an oven and served warm.\n\nUnited Kingdom and Ireland\n\nIn the United Kingdom and Ireland, cheesecake is typically made with a base of crushed, buttered biscuits and often topped with a fruit compote. The most common commercial varieties are black cherry, blackcurrant, strawberry, passionfruit, raspberry, and lemon curd. The usual filling is a mixture of cream cheese, sugar, and cream.\n\nUnited States\n\nThe United States has several different recipes for cheesecake and this usually depends on the region in which the cake was baked, as well as the cultural background of the person baking it.These cheesecakes are typically baked before serving.\n\nNew York\n\nstyle cheesecake relies upon heavy cream or sour cream.The typical New York cheesecake is rich and has a dense, smooth, and creamy consistency."
