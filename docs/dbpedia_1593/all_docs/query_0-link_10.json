        "text": "I love filo because it reminds me of delicate paper. This type of pastry can be used in savoury or sweet dishes and it is specially seen in the cuisine of the Middle East. This weekend, in order to use some Portuguese sheep’s milk cheese I had in the fridge, I created not only an easy lunch but also a deliciously looking dish which pays homage to a few cuisines of the Mediterranean. Enjoy.\n\nSpinach & “requeijão” in filo/Requeijão e espinafres em filo\n\n12 sheets of filo pastry\n\n200 gr of spinach (washed and dryed)\n\n15o gr of requeijão (ricotta also works)\n\n1 handful of pitted black olives\n\nSalt & pepper\n\nOlive oil to brush\n\nPreparation\n\nPre-heat the oven at 190ºC.\n\nUsing a circular spring form of 23 cm diameter, start laying each filo sheet inside it, each one brushed with olive oil. When you reach half of the sheets, place the spinach, the cheese and the olives in the middle. Season with a bit of salt & pepper. Continue the process until the sheets of filo are finished.\n\nPlace in the oven for 15-20 minutes, till it is golden and crispy. Serve warm, with a few ripe tomatoes with extra virgin olive oil and oregano."
