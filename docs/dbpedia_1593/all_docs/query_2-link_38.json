        "text": "To all those up-and-coming hotel Sales Managers out there, here's one of the best pieces of advice I got early in my career. Diversify Your Experience 🔬 For example, I've worked at an airport hotel, a downtown hotel, a resort, opened a hotel, multiple hotels at once. The benefits are two-fold; you discover what type of market you enjoy working in and you build a resume that shows experience across different markets. 👉 But put your time in. Jumping to new jobs every six months is a bad look and could make a potential employer think you'll leave on them in six months. 🔬 Take on different types of business. Corporate, catering, SMERF, business travel, etc. These reap the same benefits as listed above. 👉 But master one before adding another. There was risk and growing pains in trying different things, but it was totally worth it. Now that I'm getting older, I find that I'm more calculated with the risks I'll take. Such as, will I fart if I pick up this heavy box?\n\n#Recruiters, a little unconventional, perhaps, but this is how I learned what makes a skilled sales professional. Who would have guessed that what I learned while working at the Guam Hilton would have shaped my understanding of sales? But if you think about it, it really isn't that odd. Sales is about building relationships. And what better way than daily interaction with guests from around the world. They were \"buyers\" after all. They bought a hotel room, food, beverages, souvenirs, and experiences. And all of us at the #guamhilton were sellers. In fact, I think I learned more about sales working at the hotel - first as front desk clerk and then as disco manager - than in many of the sales trainings I attended. That's because #sales is human-to-human. Recruiters, I've included interview questions at the end of the carousel that I've used to get a better understanding of how sales candidates treat these special relationships. Their answers often given insight into their skill level.\n\nMoving… ?! 📦🌍✈️ It’s been a crazy week, I just moved apartment and although I thought it would be an easy move, it’s now Friday and I’m still not fully unpacked! 👠🤯 But this got me thinking… I only moved a few minutes away… at Food People, we are regularly moving amazing talents from market to market in the GCC and sometimes from across the globe! 🌎🤩 Moving country can be extremely daunting, so here are some of my recommendations when considering a move:- 🍊Check out Numbeo! - An amazing tool to compare cost of living from city to city, from the average rental prices to the price of a pint of milk!🥛 🍊Visiting - (particularly if moving within the GCC) Take a weekend out to visit your potential new home and feel it out! 🍊Join online forums - Prior to my move, I joined many online pages and forums as these are a great place for information and to ask the really important questions! 🍊Speak to someone in that market - Whether it be a friend or a friend of a friend who has made a move, they can speak from experience and guide you with the move. #relocating #recruitment #foodandbeveragerecruitment #foodandbeverage #wearefoodpeople #fmcg\n\n🚀 LIVE COMMERCIAL JOBS 🚀 More jobs filled and more jobs in, strong performance from everyone last week!

There is a lot of activity all around us. People chatting, working, and laughing around - a snapshot of modern life in all its vibrant complexity. What happened next was something that some might say was insignificant, but it for me it showed that this particular organisation valued their customers and trained their staff to make a difference. Who would think it all came down to a bottle of sauce at the table! Now most of us would be accustomed to the single flower or an arrangement, the table napkins and the usual bottle of ketchup that gets placed. What was different? We all know that most Indians like their food spicy. So, I felt it was a nice touch, that the server without being asked made sure that the table now had a bottle of Tabasco -just in case the diners were looking for that extra bit of kick to their meal. It made me think of the everyday moments and the power of soft skills. I also thought of the soft skill trainer at my first job - telling us how we needed to approach difficult customers. He said and I quote, \"you might be telling them to go to hell and they would actually be asking for directions.\" Over the years I have come to marvel at the way soft skills shape our lives in ways big and small. Like when I find myself offering a listening ear to a colleague going through a tough time, thanking my server or cab driver at the end of a meal or a ride. These seemingly small acts are becoming a rarity and those using them are on the list of \"endangered species\". Yet, they are the building blocks of strong relationships, effective collaboration, and personal growth. So, as I sit here in this bustling café, I can't help but say “Soft skills” are not just buzzwords on a resume—they're the secret sauce that helps us navigate the beautiful messiness of the world around us. And for that, I'm endlessly grateful. #softskills #training #lifelearnings\n\n⭐Our Interim support takes the pressure off your team and drives your sales… If your hotel or venue is missing one of your sales team at the moment due to unexpected absence, you are in the recruitment phase or planning for a maternity/paternity cover, this could be the solution for you.
