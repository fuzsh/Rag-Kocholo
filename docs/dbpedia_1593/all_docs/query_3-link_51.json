Watch carefully in order not to spill over your stovetop.\n\n2\n\nTurn off the heat as soon as it comes to a boil and then stir in the lemon juice or vinegar. Set aside for about 15 minutes in order to curdle and cool down.\n\n3\n\nStrain: Pass the liquids and curdles through a fine-mesh sieve and press them down with a spoon to release all the liquid. TIP: It is important to remove all the liquid, which can be re-purposed. The liquid is rich in protein. (Freeze it in ice cube trays and add to soups, rice, or smoothies).\n\n4\n\nBlend: Transfer the curdles to a blender or food processor and add the butter, salt, and about 2 tablespoons of the extra milk. Blend well until creamy, smooth, and spreadable, about 2-3 minutes.\n\n5\n\nIf you would like your cream cheese to be thinner, add one more tablespoon of the reserved milk and blend again just until homogeneous and creamy. NOTE: Unlike the American cream cheese, which is solid, the Brazilian cream cheese has a super creamy, smooth, and spreadable consistency (almost like a cake frosting).\n\n6\n\nChill/Serve or Store: Transfer the cream cheese spread to a sterilized mason jar, seal the lid, and refrigerate for at least 3 hours or until chilled. Spread over Brazi Bites Cheddar & Parmesan Brazilian Cheese Bread or fill the bread with the cream cheese spread."
