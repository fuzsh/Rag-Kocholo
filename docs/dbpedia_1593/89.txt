Popular in the Northeast, this version of requeijão appeared before the spread version was created and, to date, it is often produced through a handmade process from cow’s buttermilk, de-wheyed and cooked. The right consistency is obtained during the cooking process, and the more it cooks, the darker it gets – that is why it can be called requeijão crioulo (creole) or preto (black). Sliced or cut into pieces, it complements salads and fillings.
