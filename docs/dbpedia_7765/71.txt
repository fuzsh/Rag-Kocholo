(Angel Dust)

Backside melts into a sofa

My world, my TV, and my food

Besides listening to my belly gurgle

Ain′t much else to do

Yeah, I sweat a lot

Pants fall down every time I bend over

And my feet itch

Yeah-I married a scarecrow

I hate you

Talking to myself

Everibody's starin′ at me

I'm only bleedin'

Someone taps me on the shoulder every 5 minutes

Nobody speaks English anymore

Would anybody tell me I was gettin′ stupider?

I hate you

Talking to myself

You don′t feel it after awhile

You take the beating

I'm a swingin′ guy

Throw a belt over the shower curtain rod

And swing - - -

Toss me inside a Hefty

And put me in the ground

A drink needs me

I don't

I ain′t about to guzzle no tears

So kiss my ass

Newscasters, coakroaches, and desserts

I hate you

Talkin' to myself

Everibody′s starin' at me

I'm only bleedin′

Where are the kids?

Maybepregnantorondrugs

Oronwelfareontopoftheworld

DonthehonorrolonparoleontheDodgers

Onthebackofmilkcartonsonstakes

Inthemiddleofcornfields

Oncoversoffuturehistorybooks

Onoldlady′smantleswalkin'onwaternailedoncrosses

I think it′s time I had a talk with my kids

I'll just tell ′em what my daddy told me

YOU AIN'T NEVER GONNA AMOUNT NOTHIN′
