        "text": "Joey Holman (of HOLMAN) and Roddy Bottum (Faith No More, Imperial Teen, CRICKETS, and Nastie Band), are together in life as well as their new collaborative project, MAN ON MAN. With a timeless indie-rock style, their new single, ‘Stohner’, was born of the hardships they have experienced during the isolation of the COVID-19 pandemic. They moved from the East to West Coast at the start of the virus, and in the span of just six months, the couple lost both their mothers. The pair celebrated the impact both women had on their lives by pouring their hearts into, in their words, “pop melodies that collide effortlessly with both a shared melancholy and simultaneous hope.” If you’ve not already realised, MAN ON MAN abbreviates nicely as M.O.M.\n\nIn ‘Stohner’, we see true love encapsulated. Raw, unrestrained, and immensely fervent. Speaking about the song, M.O.M. state,\n\n“As we continue to tell the story of queer love and tenderness, it was important for us to showcase our affection in new and exciting ways.”\n\nThe fourth single from their upcoming self-titled album, ‘Stohner’ is a prime indie-pop love song, filled with distorted instrumentals and earnest lyrics. When writing the post-grunge rock track, their goal was to shake off the paranoia at the beginning of quarantine. The music video, directed by Brendan McGowan, is unadorned, with the sole focus on the couple and their radiating affection for one another. Illuminated by a soft, warm glow, Bottum and Holman share a kiss to announce the shoegaze strumming. By the end of the clip, their desire for each other exceeds the need to act PG in front of the camera. As two bees meet, honey is generously poured over the pair leaving the lovers locked to each other as the song fades out. The pair not only flirt with each other on-screen but with the audience as well. It’s guaranteed viewers will be engrossed by the screen chemistry emitted by the MAN ON MAN.\n\nCheck out ‘Stohner’ below, and catch up with more about MAN ON MAN and their music online on Instagram."
