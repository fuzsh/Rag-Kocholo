        "text": "Hadrian's Union (HU) is back and breaking down walls, both musical and social. This eclectic folk-rock band from the UK has been through many iterations, but their latest lineup is their strongest yet.\n\nWant to know how a love of bears, a walk on the Camino de Santiago, and a dash of ADHD fueled the creation of their new single, \"Big Ole Daddy B\"? This interview dives deep into the band's creative process, their new album Splendiferous, and their upcoming gigs.\n\nIntrigued by a band that celebrates inclusivity and isn't afraid to have fun? Read the full interview to learn more about HU's unique sound, their inspirations, and their upcoming projects! You won't want to miss their energetic live shows or their message of acceptance.\n\nHadrian’s Union (HU) was formed in 2006 as a folk bluegrass duo comprising Stew Simpson on guitar and vocals and Danny Hart on violin and lead guitar. Over the years HU has gone through various changes in the line up which has resulted in the music evolving and growing. An early version of HU signed to Fellside records in 2008 but split a few years after that. In 2015 HU re-emerged as a folk rock group with five members and a collection of varied instruments. The new line up proved successful and following various tours, recorded a third album entitled Aural Borderalis featuring David Pratt on drums. Unfortunately, HU parted ways once again but returned with a new line up who recorded a 5 track EP called Permission. Lockdown created many complications for the band which resulted in them parting ways and the lead singer, Stew, almost quitting music altogether. Fortunately David (Pratt) and Stew decided to rekindle the fire of the band. Mat Mellor (lead guitar) replaced the original violin sound and Mike Turnbull recently joined as bass player. When HU were still a folk rock band, they had considered inviting Mike to join them to play mandolin and they knew he could sing as well. Turns out he’s also an amazing slide bass guitar player and his personality fits in well with the rest of the group. Mat supported the original line up of HU at their second album launch, In Your Own Time. Stew got in touch with Mat’s guitar teacher looking for a lead guitarist having forgotten that Mat had supported the band all those years ago when he was only 16.At his audition, Mat’s natural talent shone through and then one thing led to another. David was the first person to audition for HU on drums and Stew said yes instantly, he just loved his vibe. David and Stew’s time apart has made the bond stronger in the long run.\n\nHadrian’s Wall in separates the North of England and Scotland. It was built by the Roman emperor Hadrian in AD122. Stew wanted the name to represent the past and the present day, with ideas of social fairness and a bond of the people involved. With various band members being from different points along the 83 miles of this historical monument, it seemed like a very poignant choice. Breaking down walls which were built to separate now symbolises a coming together of people, a union of ideas, of brotherhood, in a sense of family ie Hadrian’s Union.\n\nStew and Mat both love punk rock, rap and so much more, David is our go to blues and Americana guy, Mike loves folk music, so it’s a huge mix of influences – everything from Nirvana, Green Day, The Clash to Lil Feet, Eric Clapton, Seth Lakeman and the Eagles. At times, in our music, you can also hear the Beatles, Pink Floyd, The Detroit Cobras and so much more. HU and it’s music are very much a product of the various generations that exist in the band, we have a Boomer, a Gen X, a Xennial, and a Millennial. This is very evident in the differing style of tracks on the new album Splendiferous which is a move towards something a little more rock and roll, slightly Springsteen, mid Bon Jovi denim vibes. But like the music, there is individuals’ influence but collectively it just seems to blend together like a perfect mismatched outfit. It’s new but it’s also vintage.\n\nStew usually starts the process by bringing the bare bones of a song to the band. He exclusively writes the lyrics but predominantly sees himself as an artist, so the songs themselves are another outlet to make connections with people. The band take the music and allow it to organically emerge through jamming out ideas. Recently the rhythm section recorded groovy riffs for Mat to add his electric magic and presented it to Stew to add the lyrics. Mat also brought a tune to the band called Perfect Match which is included on the new album Splendiferous. The band work together well in this ever changing process.\n\nHU are an eclectic, non ageist, inclusive group of people who love and respect one another regardless of sexuality, age or neurodiversity. If anything, HU is a celebration of difference which makes them more relatable. They are not trying to fit in, because they know that they can’t. If listeners like what they hear, they can join the Union, if not then that’s okay and they can find something else they do like. HU sing about modern day life, mental health, love, lust and occasionally politics, all with a touch of humour but also a seriousness about deep subjects. This is a band that is deep but loves to have fun too, music for dancing and thinking, sometimes simultaneously.\n\nStew’s always had a thing for bears, and has in the past hinted at what he likes lyrically. He was very subtle using polari and rhyming slang to suggest his queerness. However, after doing a lot of soul searching during the pandemic and whilst walking the Camino de Santiago in 2022, Stew decided to be upfront and honest. “The World has changed and I feel safe enough within myself to stand up and be counted, I am a gay neurodivergent man who is attracted to larger, hirsute (often mature) men, always have been and always will be. I feel like so much body shaming exists in the world which can lead to bad mental health, it’s more than okay to be you, you are enough and you should be proud”.\n\nI don’t know about the rest of the band but I’d love it if Big Dipper could do a fat dance mix just because I think he’d get it and he’s super talented, maybe John Grant (because he’s hot, talented and I love his electronic stuff) or maybe a collaboration with Roddy Bottum from Man on Man (also see above regarding hotness). The video is dedicated to the memory of Darren Etheringon who was a much respected member of the bear community in Newcastle Upon Tyne (UK). He was going to be asked to star as Big Ole Daddy B in the video, but sadly he died on Easter Sunday. It would be fitting if Man on Man collaborated because they brought Darren and Stew together via a bear facebook group called the Bears Arms, who have a joint admiration of the gay rock (couple) Roddy Bottum (Faith No More) and Joey Holman.\n\nOver the next 6 months HU will release 5 more singles and videos via their website hadriansunion.co.uk and also YouTube, culminating in releasing the album to streaming in November, just in time for Christmas. In the meantime, they will be headlining Hexham Pride (16.6.24) and performing at Chickenstock Music Festival (2.8.24), The Magnet, Broadstairs (3.8.24), Prohibition Bar, Newcastle (8.8.24) as well as various gigs up and down the UK.\n\nIf you would like to buy the Splendiferous album exclusively before it is streamed, then please go to www.hadriansunion.co.uk where you can buy the CD or download now. We still have some dates available so if you would like to hear Splendiferous live, please get in touch via our website."
