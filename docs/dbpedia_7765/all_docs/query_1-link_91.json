I'm empty.\n\nI bought the thing\n\nI taught the thing\n\nAnd I fought the thing\n\nThey said it's normal\n\nBut they're keeping me dumb and hot\n\nYou're missing something\n\nKeeping me dumb and hot\n\nYou must be missing something\n\nKeeping me dumb and hot\n\nWhat'd I say? I'm empty.\n\nAnd I'm sending it back to you\n\nTop\n\nHelpless\n\nThe air is warm\n\nI hear the wind and the trees\n\nI know I'm there, but I'll never be\n\nThe wind is soft tonight, the tide is low\n\nAnd I know the way\n\n(I never felt better now)\n\nSometimes life, it moves too slow\n\nSlows to a crawl, and then the poetry is lost\n\nAnd without speed, hope becomes certainty\n\nAnd for once I'm certain\n\n(I never felt better now)\n\nA garden is it's own perfect world\n\nWhere everything has a place\n\nEvery leaf, every stone, every speck of dirt\n\nBut where's my place?\n\nI even tried to get arrested today\n\nBut everyone looked the other way\n\nI count the hours, and I count the days\n\nBut for once I'm certain\n\nDon't want your help\n\nDon't need your help\n\nDon't want your help\n\nDon't need your help\n\nHelpless\n\nYou found a way to make me say\n\nHelp me please someone\n\nThe water's clear\n\nI see that it's full of dimes\n\nFor every wish, I wonder why\n\nWhy all I want is something beautiful\n\nA place to rest\n\n(I never felt better now)\n\nHELP\n\nTop\n\nMouth To Mouth\n\nYou tied the knot\n\nA legend is what you bought\n\nI give you cold water and you\n\nSwear it was wine\n\nYou bought time\n\nIf you can fool yourself, then why not them?\n\nJust keep on passing it mouth to mouth to mouth\n\nI can dress up the dead man\n\nBut I can't bring him back to life\n\nYou tied the knot\n\nPeeled your skin off, leaving a bundle of nerves\n\nI give you a wet noodle, you swear that it was my tongue\n\nA sharp one\n\nInstead of that same old mouth to mouth to mouth to mouth\n\nI can dress up the dead man\n\nBut I can't bring him back to life\n\nTop\n\nAshes To Ashes\n\nI want them to know it's me\n\nIt's on my head\n\nI'll point the finger at me\n\nIt's on my head\n\nGive it all to you\n\nThen I'll be closer\n\nSmiling with the mouth of the ocean\n\nAnd I'll wave to you with the arms of the mountain\n\nI'll see you\n\nI will let you shout no more\n\nIt's on my head\n\nI'll pick you up from the floor\n\nIt's on my head\n\nI'll let you even the score It's on my head\n\nGive it all to you\n\nThen I'll be closer\n\nSmiling with the mouth of the ocean\n\nAnd I'll wave to you with the arms of the mountain\n\nI'll see you\n\nGive the same to me then I'll be closer, closer\n\nGive the same to me then I'll be closer, closer\n\nSmiling with the mouth of the ocean\n\nAnd I'll wave to you with the arms of the mountain\n\nGive the same to me then I'll be closer\n\nTop\n\nShe Loves Me Not\n\nI'm here alone on the telephone line\n\nI'm right where you want me to be\n\nAnd I'll wait alone and never ask why\n\nI'll be where you want me to be\n\nAnd I know...\n\nI've been here before and I know your kind\n\nYou're right where I want you to be\n\nNow I'll say what I think\n\nI'll never be what you want me to be\n\n(Just to be who I am)\n\nWhat do you want me to be?\n\nYou'll be on your knees\n\nTell me\n\nTell me it's not true\n\nTop\n\nGot That Feeling\n\nGot that feeling\n\nLuck is just a little of it\n\nGot that feeling\n\nI can't stop winning\n\nA to Z\n\nLook what you're missing, as we speak\n\nYour number's rising, take a peak\n\nThere's just enough to go around, get a piece\n\nYour own little piece of hell\n\nGot that feeling\n\nLoving every minute of it\n\nGot that feeling\n\nI can't stop winning\n\nHave a drink\n\nA pot of coffee, cannot think\n\nToo many friends here, just an inch\n\nBetween striking out and striking rich, just a risk\n\nOne I'll take and take again...\n\nGot that feeling\n\nGotta bet a little of it\n\nGot that feeling\n\nI can't stop winning..\n\nAnd start living\n\nYou can't borrow tomorrow\n\nTop\n\nPaths Of Glory\n\nYou squirt out red and turn so yellow\n\nAnd then you made me kill my own\n\nI'm not afraid\n\n(coming, coming)\n\nBut I'm afraid\n\nBlood in your eyes again\n\nBravery, the face of man\n\nBlood on your mind again\n\nChivalry, the face of man\n\nBlood in your lies again\n\nEnemy, the face of man\n\nBlood in your eyes, again\n\nIs this the only path of glory?\n\nIf so then I won't go alone\n\nFollow the trail\n\n(running) Follow the trail\n\nI'm not afraid\n\nBut I'm afraid\n\nTop\n\nHome Sick Home\n\nCome home\n\nIt's been so long\n\nWe're missing you at home\n\nSo hang up that phone\n\nCuz I'm coming back\n\nhome\n\nCome home\n\nIt's been so long\n\nCan't hide no more\n\nSo hang up that phone\n\nCuz I'm coming back\n\nhome\n\nDrive me home\n\nTop\n\nPristina\n\nI'm watching you\n\nYou shall weep no more\n\nIt's your last breath of air\n\nThese walls won't keep them out\n\nThey'll keep you in\n\nBut who's going to protect you?\n\nWho?\n\nIn every flower bed\n\nIn every marriage bed\n\nI'll be with you\n\nI'm watching you\n\nTop\n\nAll songs published by FNM Music ASCAP.\n\nProduced by Roli Mosimann and Billy Gould with Faith No More.\n\nMixed by Roli Mosimann.\n\nRecorded at Brilliant Studios, San Francisco, CA.
