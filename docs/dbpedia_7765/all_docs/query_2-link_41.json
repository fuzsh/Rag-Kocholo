        "text": "Another week, another review. After covering Aerosmith’s shit-hits-the-fan phase, how about I cover another band in their shit-hits-the-fan phase? This is Faith No More’s Album Of The Year. Also, sorry for the delay.\n\nAlbum Of The Year is Faith No More’s sixth studio album, released June 3, 1997 on Slash and Reprise. Produced by Roli Mosimann and bassist Billy Gould, this marked the band’s last album before disbanding the following year (though of course they regrouped in 2009), as well as the first to feature current guitarist Jon Hudson, who was a former roommate of keyboardist Roddy Bottum.\n\nThe album received a mixed-to-negative reception from critics and fans, and even Mike Patton has said this was the point where the band started making bad music. Do I agree with him? I wi-\n\nWait, that’s what this review is for!\n\n1. “Collision” (Jon Hudson/Mike Patton):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=SX7jEHy6v-4\n\nOpening up the album is “Collusion”, the first of four songs to credit Jon Hudson.\n\nThis track gets comes right out the gate, just swarming with crushing guitars and the operatic wail of Mr. Mike Patton, popular music’s most versatile vocalist according to VVN Music , and man, he sure as hell isn’t far off.\n\nRoddy Bottum’s synth work is extremely tasteful on here, perfectly complimenting the atmosphere of the verses and never robbing the track of its heaviness or power. Synthesizers in heavier music can be a somewhat dicey affair, but Roddy pulls it off masterfully. Billy Gould’s bass is just as ballsy and muscular as ever, it and Bordin’s left-of-center hard rock attack driving the track powerfully. For better and/or for worse, every guitarist that FNM gets will be compared to Jim Martin on some level. I will say that Jon Hudson does a more than respectable job on guitar here. He’s not really stretching out here, but he fits into the Faith No More aesthetic seamlessly.\n\nA very straight ahead track, it does a stellar job of kicking off the album and getting the listener interested right out the gate.\n\n2. “Stripsearch” (Mike Bordin/Billy Gould/Hudson):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=-_U6165DVeM\n\nNow we come to “Stripsearch”, the third and final single off the album. This came about from a riff that Jon Hudson composes on an MIDI.\n\nThis marks the first track to highlight the electronic experimentation encouraged by co-producer Roli Mosimann. These elements present a detached, exhausted feeling to the track. It’s full of shine and spark, but there remains a dark undertone to the song. There’s a feeling of waking up, half asleep and still dealing with cold sweat. Jon Hudson plays a cool little solo that nicely fits into the song, while he and the others bring a bit of Faith No More’s metal leanings back in near the end as Patton delivers the keep yourself…away refrain and Roddy delivers some Psycho styled strings.\n\nLyrically, the track is as abstract as you’d expect from Mike Patton’s lyrics. That said, they appear to reflect a relationship going down the tube, with Patton still longing for the warmth and affection that he and his partner have had in the past. But it’s gone, they’re both going through the motions, and by continuing on the relationship, they are living a lie. He keeps opening up, no matter how awkward, painful, and embarrassing it is, and no matter how little it helps him, not unlike a strip search. It’s hard not to read into this for reality subtext, since the band members were really not on the same page when making this album, and even Patton has said that if they had continued on, the next album would have been absolute crap.\n\nWith all of that, we have a pretty stellar track and a solid choice for a single.\n\n3. “Last Cup Of Sorrow” (Gould/Patton):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ht7kX2IL9nE\n\n“Last Cup Of Sorrow”, which was the second single off this album. As you’ll likely notice in the video right above, the video and the single artwork were both influenced by Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo.\n\nWhile the track is heavier than “Stripsearch”, it retains the electronic touches, using them to add a light touch to the main riff, contrasting against the intensity of the music. The music possesses a dramatic flair, with the strings swelling at key moments of drama. The distortion on parts of Patton’s vocal, particularly the you might surprise yourself gives a tense feel to the track, reflecting the unease in letting go.\n\nLyrically, this explores the theme of letting go that “Stripsearch” touched on. Whereas that track explored staying on with something longer than you should, this emphasizes the need to go into the open, find that new thing and embrace it, because it can easily disappear at any moment. A fun fact: the pre-chorus directly comes from “Bloody Mary” off Mr. Bungle’s Goddamnit, I Love America demo. I’m often pretty iffy on bands reusing their own lyrics, but it can be done well, and it’s certainly done well here. First off, it’s off a demo, and plus, it perfectly ties in with the theme of trying to move on, both in how difficult it can be, as well as how rewarding. And it arguably foreshadows Mike moving his focus over to Mr Bungle\n\n4. “Naked in Front Of The Computer” (Patton):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=UYbFsZmQG3E\n\n“Naked In Front Of The Computer”, a young male’s natural habitat. It is also the rare Faith No More song to be credited solely to Mike Patton.\n\nThis song is very much in the vein of “Get Out” off the previous album, which I actually reviewed very early on. It’s a straight up fast, heavy track, short, sweet, and to the point. I hear a little bit of old Anthrax in this track, which is interesting since Scott Ian is a big FNM fan and of course, he played at those Mr. Bungle shows a few months ago. From what I’ve heard, they were good, and I’m sure it was, but for me, especially if the reunion is meant to be permanent, you need Bär, Theo, and Danny, you need all six of them for it to be real deal Mr. Bungle.\n\nLyrically, the track is sadly not about porn, but the inane and superficial relationship between man and computer and how much agitation can be created by something that’s supposed to make our lives easier. I’m living in a more advanced age, and I still relate.\n\nYou could say this is the band repeating themselves, which for Faith No More can be pretty disappointing. That said, I dig heavy Faith No More, this song doesn’t overstay it’s welcome, so I’m good with it. It’s filler, but it’s killer filler.\n\n5. “Helpless” (Bordin/Gould/Patton):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=4RBLz6TK8wU\n\nAh, “Helpless”.\n\nMusically, the track has this very dreamy character. There’s a sense of bliss throughout the track, with even the chorus-while somewhat heavier-having a borderline shoegaze feel. It reminds me of Deftones, who I love. Obviously, a lot of bands took after Faith No More, usually doing a really piss poor job of it. I know it’s a cliche at this point to rip on nu metal, but seriously, how does such a creative band (help) spawn such a creatively genre? Faith No More goes “let’s do some hip hop and put it in with funk and metal and prog and whatever”. Then a bunch of bands decide to dress and act like jerks and rap. Badly. With all that said, I would say Deftones were a band that learned the right lessons from Faith No More.\n\nLyrically, for a song called “Helpless”, it’s actually quite hopeful in tone. Sure, there’s difficulty along the way, and it’s strange to see everything just end, but it really allows for a new beginning. Of course, Mike is howling “HELP!” at the end, so perhaps he’s lying to himself to make it seem better than it really is?\n\n6. “Mouth to Mouth” (Bordin/Gould/Hudson/Patton):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=J_HoEHWw4vY\n\nNow we come to “Mouth to Mouth”, which is a total throwback to the early stuff, particularly when Chuck Moseley was in the band.\n\nThe track builds up, Billy Gould’s bass work setting the foundation for the track as the track comes right in. The track is very much in the vein of early Faith No More, particularly when Chuck Moseley was the singer. Fairly straightforward with the heavy a metal riffs mixed in with funk, hip hop, and post-punk even. The track explodes with energy and rhythmic density and flow. Mike Patton attacks the lyrics viciously.\n\nThese lyrics do seem very stream-of-conscious, something Mike wrote out thinking of something to compliment the melody and instrumentation. With that said, I get the impression of a star of sorts that has become a shell of themselves. Past glories keep the star afloat, fans eagerly eating up his work even when it’s not up to par simply out of idol worship. As somebody that’s been on forums and all that, yeah, there’s a shit load of fans that just eat up whatever their idol does, doesn’t matter if it’s even good or not. I’m pretty fuckin’ loyal to my favorite artists, but not to the point of pretending everything they do is good.\n\nThis is easily one of my favorite songs on the album, it’s a absolute highlight.\n\n7. “Ashes to Ashes” (Bordin/Roddy Bottum/Gould/Hudson/Patton):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Kfq7wHJu21c\n\n“Ashes to Ashes”, the first song to credit all five members as well as the first single off the album.\n\nMan, that riff, so gripping, nasty and full of bite. Roddy’s synths create an almost confessional atmosphere, as though Mike is going to a priest to confess his sins. There’s a heavy weight on him, and he has no idea what reaction he will get. But he knows if he doesn’t do this, things will only get worse. As I mentioned in the opening, Mike has said that if the band hadn’t broken up, the next album would have sucked. I don’t agree with him that this was where the band started making bad music, I’m more with Billy on that subject; however, you can somewhat tell something is up here. It’s like with Pantera’s Reinventing the Steel. Every one of Pantera’s albums prior to that, even if we include the Glamtera albums, felt like a natural progression, and a step forward. Reinventing, though, felt like Pantera on cruise control. It’s not a band album by any means, but the issues between Phil and the Abbott Brothers are very obvious in hindsight. Likewise, this album kind of feels like Faith No More making just another album, it’s the closest they’ve to sounding like a band on cruise control.\n\nThe track has this great anthemic chorus, the release of finally taking the albatross off your neck. And let’s give it up for Jon Hudson, who does some sweet lead work and particularly his solo at 2:17. Of course, Jim Martin can’t truly be replaced, but Hudson does a more than repsectable job at filling in.\n\nThis is an absolute gem and one of the album highlights.\n\n8. “She Loves Me Lot” (Bordin/Gould/Patton):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=R4HSx2ORSl4\n\nHere we come to a ballad, which was originally going to be the fourth single but wasn’t because of the group breaking up. However, it would later appear on their greatest hits compilation that came out in 2006.\n\nI do detect the lounge influence, but I can see how Billy compared this to a Boyz II Men song. Certainly as far as song structure, it’s very similar to something Boyz II Men. And I’m totally good with that as somebody that enjoys R&B and loved “Evidence” off King For A Day, and this is another slice of R&B Faith No More. Mike is in fantastic vocal on here. Granted, it’s Mike Patton, so you know the vocals will be strong, but his vocal melody and delivery is so expertly crafted throughout the track.\n\nI also want to give a shout out to Mr. Roddy Bottum, who plays some wonderful R&B flavored piano as well as a dreamy Mellotron soundscape. It gives the song such a sweetness not normally associated with Faith No More, and really helps broaden the scope of the band.\n\nI do get why Billy was reluctant to show this song, it does stick out like a sore thumb compared to a lot of the album. But fuck it, like Bordin said, it’s a good song and worthy of inclusion. It adds a nice dimension to the record, and brings a good variety to the mix.\n\n9. “Got That Feeling” (Patton):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lEDgRHDQhQo\n\n“Got That Feeling”, the second song to credit solely Mike Patton.\n\nSimilar to “Naked In Front Of The Computer”, it’s a short, fast song. It begins with a little surf riff before going into this alt metal/punk type of song. I hear quite a bit of Jane’s Addiction in this song, from some of what Jon Hudson plays on guitar to some of Patton’s vocal mannerisms that recall Perry Farrell. I do love the little scat vocals that Mike does on here, which actually somewhat reminds me of Jonathan Davis from Korn. And funny enough, the band were about to do a co-headlining tour with Korn before this whole pandemic. I wasn’t able to get tickets, and really I would have bought them to see Faith No More. I know Korn has a good reputation as a live band, and I do like some Korn, but really, I’m there for FNM. And sure, it sucks that FNM has to open for a band to pave the way for them, but hey, I catch a whole set from the band that actually matters to me and still beat the traffic.\n\nI will say this was more of a grower for me, I thought it was cool when I first heard the album. But now? Fucking love it, and it may actually be in my Top 5 for the album. Then again, it’s Faith No More, they’re a band where you have to sit in the water before it totally sinks in.\n\nI fucking love this track, but now we move on to “Paths Of Glory”.\n\n10. “Paths Of Glory” (Bordin/Bottum/Gould/Hudson/Patton):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=kBzmwwkeMrM\n\nAnd now the second song to credit all five members of the band.\n\nBordin lays down a solid groove for the track to build upon. Hudson and Billy deliver a crunchy interlocking of guitar and bass, while Roddy fills in the cracks with his synth arrangements. There’s a strong wall of sound without being overbearing or masturbatory. The track is fairly minimalist, but the atmosphere is rich and dense throughout the track. The rumbling hushed vocals of Mike Patton only add to this atmosphere, with his operatic wails only coming in at select moments.\n\nLyrically, this falls into very abstract territory, where the listener is left to decide for themselves what it’s about. From what I gather, this seems to be Mike saying that he could be a bigger star but he’s not going to step on others to do so, nor will he change for others. Whereas many songs on here tie into moving on, not dragging things out, or various aspects of fame, this can tie into maintaining a sense of integrity. It would have been easy for the band to repeat “Epic” or for Mike to play into the pretty boy look, but they went “fuck that”, and made Angel Dust. It may not have been the easy way, and they may not have sold as many records as some of their peers, but they played long game, and now they are winning like fuck. And more than anything, they’re respected. In many ways, that’s more valuable.\n\n“Path Of Glory”, one of my favorite tracks on the album.\n\n11. “Home Sick Home” (Patton):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=TfZwMGZVsxQ\n\nAt the second to last, we have the third and final track to credit just Mike Patton.\n\nThe opening riff, I hear a bit of “Same Old Song And Dance” by Aerosmith, which leads into the atmospheric synth work of Roddy and the driving rhythm of Bordin and Billy. The tune feels like a mish mash of old ideas and shit we’ve already heard from Faith No More, and usually done better.\n\nAs I previously mentioned, Faith No More albums are ones where I usually have to give them time before they fully sink. There are tracks that went from “okay, it’s not bad” to “this track is awesome!”. And there are the tracks that are killer filler. “Home Sick Home” is just plain filler, just there to tie us over and bring the album to at least forty minutes. A little fun fact: this was the first album since Mike’s arrival to be under fifty minutes.\n\nAnd right there is the rare Faith No More song that I don’t like.\n\n12. “Pristina” (Gould/Patton):\n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=vAsVa768r8E\n\nNow we wrap it up with “Pristina”, which was written with Billy.\n\nI hear a fair bit of Melvins in this tune, particularly Houdini era Melvins, which makes sense since I know at least Mike is a Melvins fan, and of course, they’ve been friends for years and the Melvins have been on Ipecac almost since the beginning. The song is more driven by atmosphere, with an almost dreamy, shoegazey kind of vibe to it.\n\nThe track has a mournful quality to it, matched by the album cover of Czechoslovak politician Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk, as well as the gatefold depicting his funeral. I never knew for the longest time who the guy was on the album cover, I just thought it was a cool cover. Then I researched the cover, particularly for this album review, and now the cover really makes sense. Masaryk was the country’s founding father, a man that people looked to when thinking “this is what we should do” and who was looked up to, not unlike how many saw the band. And the funeral, of course, this is goodbye, it’s time to move on. It may not be easy, but we still had a good run, and we wouldn’t have done it any other way.\n\nThis album got really slammed when it came out, it was really seen as a disappointment. Pitchfork, Jesus Christ Almighty, protector of all that is good and holy, gave this a two and compared it to a one night stand that you end up feeling gross about afterward. That can describe a lot of Faith No More’s knockoffs, but not Faith No More under any circumstances.\n\nWhatever. This track is not a single by any means, but it’s a very effective album track and album closer.\n\nOVERALL THOUGHTS\n\nThat is Faith No More’s Album Of The Year. It’s not a perfect effort, it’s certainly one of the lesser entries into their discography. With that said, Faith No More still knocks it out as always. Though probably their most streamlined album, certainly since Mike Patton joined, it still retains some of the experimental tendencies that the group is known for. It’s also just a good hard rock album, with the band right as ever and consistently delivering top notch performances.\n\nThis isn’t an album I’d use to get somebody into Faith No More, Real Thing And Angel Dust both serving as better entrance points into the band’s body of work. However, it still makes for a very solid addition to the collection of any alternative hard rock and metal fan as well as any Faith No More fan.\n\nThere it is. Be sure to comment, subscribe, and spread the word like a hair metal rocker spreads herpes."
