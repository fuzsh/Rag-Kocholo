His first band was named \"The Animated,\" which seemed to be a cross of many different genres.\n\nFaith No More[]\n\nIn the early 1980s, Gould moved to San Francisco to begin his studies, joining many underground bands along the way. He then met Mike Bordin and Jim Martin, and soon after that the band Faith No Man was formed. Wade Worthington was quickly replaced by Roddy Bottum and once Mike Morris was out of the band, it was renamed to Faith No More.\n\nGould produced 1997's Album of the Year and since then has become he CEO of Koolarrow Records, joining in on many side projects along the way. In 2009, Faith No More reformed for a reunion tour and possible recording, and Billy is a current member to this day.\n\nKoolarrow Records[]"
