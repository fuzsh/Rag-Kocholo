Band Member Profiles\n\nBass:\n\nWilliam David Gould Junior, more commonly known as Billy Gould.\n\nBill was born in Los Angeles on 24th April 1963. He went to school in LA with Roddy Bottum. He currently lives in San Francisco and had been in the band since 1982.\n\nKeyboards:\n\nRoswell Christopher Bottum, Roddy Bottum to us all.\n\nHe was born in Los Angeles on 1st July 1963. He is a classically trained pianist who also lives in San Francisco and had been in the band since 1982.\n\nDrums:\n\nMichael Andrew Bordin, also known as \"Puffy\".\n\nMike Bordin was born in San Francisco on 27th November 1962. His nickname Puffy, which first used to be Puff Head, came from his hair style as a teenager. He had a really puffy afro and Jim Martin came up with the idea to call Mike Puffy. He studied African rhythms and is left-handed. He'd also been in FNM since 1982.\n\nVocals:\n\nMichael Allan Patton, commonly known as Mike Patton.\n\nMike Patton was born on 27th January 1968 in Eureka, CA. He joined Faith No More in 1988. He lives in both San Francisco and Bologna Italy.\n\nGuitar:\n\nJon Hudson\n\nHudson was the band's last guitar player. He joined FNM in 1996, and contributed to the writing of 'Album Of The Year'. Before Faith No More, he played in a Bay Area band called Systems Collapse.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n3. Band History\n\nSee the Band Biography Page.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n4. What is Faith No Man?\n\nFaith No Man was an early configuration of Faith No More. It had Mike Bordin on drums, Wade Worthington on keyboards, Billy Gould on bass and Mike \"The Man\" Morris on guitar and vocals.\n\nAfter about a year of existence, Worthington left the band, at which point Billy invited his roommate Roddy Bottum to take his place at the keys. Bill, Puffy and Roddy all got along well with this collaboration, yet they all had a problem with the singer. He was older, bossier and tried to dictate how they should dress to suit his vision of the band. So as a polite means of firing him, the remaining three quit.\n\nNow free to pursue their own direction, the band became increasingly bizarre. With \"The Man\" out of the band, they needed a new name. A friend of Billy's, Will Carpmill, (who incidentally used to be in a band called Systems Collapse...sound familiar?) suggested Faith No More, seeing as The Man was essentially no more.\n\nThe new name stuck. So in 1982, Faith No More was finally born. One 7\" single was released under Faith No Man. It contained two songs \"Quiet in Heaven\" and \"Song of Liberty\", on Propaganda Records.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n5. Was Courtney Love really in Faith No More?\n\nShe was indeed. She joined the band in 1983, a period in which FNM were going through a lot of singers and guitarists. Courtney was in the band for roughly a year. Billy explains why she didn't stay: \"She's got to lead and tell people what's what. She was the dictator, and in our band things were democratic.\"...\"At that time she couldn't sing too well, and she had a lot of personal problems, so she had to leave the band.\"\n\nBack to the Top\n\n6. Who is Mark Bowen?\n\nMark Bowen used to be a guitarist in FNM sometime between 1982 and 1984. Not much else is known about him, including the reason why FNM wrote a song titled Mark Bowen which appeared on the 1985 album We Care A Lot.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n7. What singers, guitarists and other members has Faith No More had before the final line up?\n\nFNM has its fair share of ex-band members. Here they all are, in ascending order:\n\nSingers: Joe 'Pop-o-Pie' Pye, Walter, Paula Frazer, Mike Morris, Courtney Love, Chuck Mosely.\n\nGuitarists: Mike Morris, Jake Crucifix, Mark Stewart, Desmond Trial, Scott Colbertson, Mark Bowen, Jim Martin, Trey Spruance, Dean Menta.\n\nKeyboardists: Wade Worthington\n\nBack to the Top\n\n8. What happened to Chuck Mosely?\n\nThe band had always accepted that Chuck Mosely had drug, alcohol and attitude problems. According to Bill Gould: \"It's just really hard to describe how difficult it was working with this guy.\" The problem reached new heights when Chuck got drunk and fell asleep on stage during the 'Introduce Yourself' release party. The band could not deal with him any longer and he was fired before the recording of \"The Real Thing\" in 1988.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n9. What happened to Jim Martin?\n\nDepends on who you ask. Bill Gould says \"To make a long story short-- Jim wrote very few of the parts on Angel Dust. In fact, the tension and difficulty due to his lack of contribution on that album had a lot to do with his eventual ouster. Having said that, I'd rather not go song by song through who wrote what. For the record I'm happy to leave it that all of the songs on Angel Dust were FNM songs, meaning, written by all of the members equally, including Jim like the credits say.\"\n\nWhen asked why he was no longer in the band, Martin replied, \"Two words: Mike Patton. When I joined the band, we were going to spread hatred and have fun. At some point we stopped doing both.\"\n\nBilly explains further: \"Musically we were always kinda different. But... it got to a point I think when the chemistry can even just wear itself out into nothingness. Everybody tried to make things work, it just became so stressful that it became just kinda obvious.\"...\"I think that if we didn't change members we would have broken up.\"\n\nSo Jim Martin was fired, supposedly by fax, on November 30, 1993.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n10. What happened to Trey Spruance?\n\nAccording to the band on numerous occasions, Trey left the band as he was unable to commit to the hectic touring schedule which Faith No More endured with each release.\n\nPuffy had this to say: \"Trey didn't come highly recommended by the only person in the band that knew him! Mike Patton said \"He's a great guitarist, he'll do the job, but he's not dependable and he'll fuck us up ultimately due to his lack of any sense of responsibility.\"\"\n\nBilly: \"I really liked his guitar playing, I think musically he worked out. But I think probably we would not have worked out on the road, and so I'm glad that he decided to leave when he did.\" Trey left the band before any touring began.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n11. What happened to Dean Menta?\n\nAfter playing guitar on the 1995 King For A Day World Tour, Dean was out of the band.\n\nIt had been reported that the reason for Dean's exit was that the writing process for the new album wasn't working out.\n\nMike Patton's comments on the departure of Dean: \"We finally realized that it didn't work. We sure realized that more than him, it's not that we fired him...but we decided to look for someone else...so to be honest we fired him in a way.\"\n\nBack to the Top\n\n12. Has Faith No More been in contact with Jim since he was fired?\n\nA reporter asked Roddy this question when KFAD was released: -Are you in contact with Jim Martin? -No, I haven't talked to him since we fired him. Although we had this listening party in Hamburg (Germany), for journalists and the record company. For some reason, Jim was in Hamburg at the time. Everyone in the band was really nervous that he'd show. I was saying, 'Why would he want to show up?', but, sure, he showed up with this huge thug of a guy who was really heavy, like a Mafia type - he was so powerful they couldn't have not let him in, or he would have bombed the place later on. So, there he was with this big Hamburg heavy. He stayed at one end of the club and we were at the other end. It was a boring night. -So no one talked to him? -No.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n13. How did Faith No More meet up with Jon Hudson?\n\nJon is an old friend of Bill Gould's, a former roommate in fact. They'd known each other for 7 or 8 years before he joined FNM.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n14. What are the bands official releases?\n\nALBUMS\n\nWe Care A Lot 1985\n\nIntroduce Yourself 1987\n\nThe Real Thing 1989\n\nLive At The Brixton Academy 1991\n\nAngel Dust 1992\n\nKing For A Day....Fool For A Lifetime 1995\n\nAlbum Of The Year 1997\n\nWho Cares a Lot?

What are the lyrics to Jizzlobber's first verse?\n\nThey will sum it all up in a sentence.\n\nA verdict made by those who know.\n\nI'm ready to make a commitment.\n\nI'm willing to make love to concrete.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n17. What are the extra lyrics to Get Out?\n\nI don't speak that language anymore!\n\nMy blood is not that color anymore!\n\nMy blood don't shine same way anymore!\n\nI cannot deny it anymore!\n\nBack to the Top\n\n18. What language is that four lined verse of Caralho Voador spoken in? And what does it mean?\n\nBoth the title of the song and a small section of it are in Portuguese.\n\nThe title Caralho Voador translates to \"Flying Dick\". The Portuguese verses original lyrics are not written with the correct spelling. Here is the original verse, the corrected version, and the English version of the part.\n\nOriginal Lyrics - In \"REAL\" Portuguese - In literal English\n\nEo non posso dirigir - Eu não posso dirigir - I can't drive\n\nE agora a pares - E agora aparece - And now show-up\n\nNeo dedu indehado - Meu dedo enterrado - My finger buried\n\nNo neo naris - No meu nariz - In my nose\n\nWhen the English translation is rewritten into proper English, the translation is something like this:\n\n\"Flying Dick\"\n\nI can't drive\n\nAnd now my index finger\n\nShows up in my nose.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n19. Is it true that Evidence has been recorded in different languages?\n\nYes. It is known that there are studio recordings of Evidence in three different languages, besides the English version. They are Portuguese, Spanish and Italian. Faith No More has done the Portuguese and Spanish versions live, in Portugal/Brazil and Chile respectively. The Spanish version appears on the Argentinian pressing of King For A Day.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n20. Which part of Malpractice is the Kronos Quartet sample?\n\nThe sample in Malpractice can be heard at 2:56 , 3:02, 3:22 and 3:26.\n\nIt is taken from Dmitri Shostakovich's Quartet No. 8 which appears on the album \"Black Angels\" by Kronos Quartet. The piece contains four movements. The sample in Malpractice is taken from the second movement titled Allegro molto (Track 8 at 2:10).\n\nBack to the Top\n\n21. What is Mike Patton rambling about in the background of Kindergarten?\n\nAfter a careful listen it seems obvious that Mike has taken on the role of an auctioneer. Talk of bidding and 'Going once, twice, SOLD!' is audible.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n22. What is being said in Jim, the song from the 1985 album We Care A Lot?\n\nThe conversation, before the song starts, sounds like this:\n\nPuffy: \"Don't play it Jim.\"\n\nJim: \"Why not?\"\n\nPuffy: \"I said so.\"\n\nJim: \"I'll play it all fucking night.\"\n\nIt's also been suggested that it's actually \"Don't BLOW it...\", and \"I'll BLOW it all fuckin' night.\"\n\nThe one line at the end of the song sounds like it could be: \"?????? you're fuckin in the house\"\n\nBack to the Top\n\n23. Where are some of those familiar Land of Sunshine lyrics from?\n\nIn a L. Ron Hubbard personality test offered by the Church of Scientology, the following questions are present:\n\n#12. Do you often sing or whistle just for the fun of it?\n\n#52. Does life seem worthwhile?\n\n#60. Does emotional music have quite an effect on you?\n\n#192. Do you sometimes feel that your age is against you (too young or too old)?\n\n#195. Do others push you around? *Question #195 is written on the lyric sheet but is not in the album version of the song.\n\nNow if those lines didn't ring any bells then maybe these will. They're from Fortune Cookies!\n\nLife to you is a dashing bold adventure\n\nSing and rejoice, fortune is smiling upon you\n\nYou have a winning way so keep it\n\nYou are an angel heading for a land of sunshine\n\nPat yourself on the back and give yourself a handshake\n\nBack to the Top\n\n24. Where can I find lyrics to the B-sides and 'Album Of The Year'?\n\nThere's a comprehensive FNM Lyrics Page. You can find all the lyrics you need there, including a translation of Das Schützenfest and the German lyrics to it so you can try and sing along, as well as lyrics to 'Album Of The Year' sent in by Billy Gould.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n25. Did Mike Patton write the lyrics to Caffeine during a sleep deprivation experiment?\n\nApparently yes he did. Roddy has also pointed out that caffeine is \"the only drug he [Patton] does\". But Caffeine was not the only song written during that time. Here's what Patton had to say about Land Of Sunshine: \"I wrote that song when I was doing an experiment in sleep deprivation with my body. I was up for three days straight and I was watching a lot of...late night TV programs...that are kind of self-help oriented...(Here he went into an explanation of infomercials, like \"The Power Of Positive Thinking\" etc.). So yeah, I was watching a lot of those so I wrote a really kinda absurdly positive song.\"\n\nBack to the Top\n\n26. What are the main influences on Patton's lyrics?\n\nWhen asked \"Where do they come from?\"\n\nPatton replies: \"They come from my head, my ass, my toilet, my pillow, places like that.\"\n\nQ: \"Do you have any particular influences when you write lyrics?\"\n\nPatton: \"Sure. Everything, absolutely everything. Its just like writing music. Sometimes you draw it from a particular source, sometimes you steal, sometimes you try and think back on how the hell did this start and you can't think about it.\"\n\nThe first overall influence might be the popular director Stanley Kubrick. The connection can be seen in the following instances: In the Falling To Pieces video, Mike Patton dressed up like Alex from \"Clockwork Orange\", a Stanley Kubrick movie. In Kubrick's movie \"Full Metal Jacket\" a The First to Go, The Last To Know logo from the US Marine Corps appears. \"Paths Of Glory\" is an old Stanley Kubrick movie.\n\nThe following examples are from books: \"Homeboy\" by Seth Morgan, contains this phrase: \"Just got to where I had to run as fast as I could to stay in one place. To get anywhere, I had to run twice as fast.\" which strongly resembles Ricochet's \"Runnin twice as fast to stay in the same place.\" Mike Patton has mentioned that he was reading this book. \"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\" by Hunter S. Thompson contains this phrase (in boldface): \"Kill the body and the head will die\" which also appears in FNM's song \"What A Day\".\n\nBack to the Top\n\n27. I saw Faith No More live and they played a song where Mike sang 'I just wanna be a woman'. What was this song???\n\nThis is Portishead's \"Glory Box\". Faith No More had done a lot of covers live. They didn't do the entire songs but Mike Patton liked to insert snippets of various cover songs into the show. (see the Statistics and Cover Songs Page)\n\nBack to the Top\n\n28. Which songs, originally recorded with Chuck Mosely, have Faith No More performed live after Mike Patton joined?\n\nWe Care A Lot\n\nThe Jungle\n\nMark Bowen\n\nJim\n\nWhy Do You Bother\n\nGreed\n\nPills For Breakfast\n\nAs The Worn Turns\n\nFaster Disco\n\nIntroduce Yourself\n\nChinese Arithmetic\n\nDeath March\n\nRnR\n\nThe Crab Song\n\nBlood\n\nBack to the Top\n\n29. Were any Chuck Mosely songs re-recorded with Mike Patton?\n\nYes, As The Worm Turns was re-recorded in the studio with Mike Patton on vocals. It was done in 1991/2 and appeared as a B-side on the Australian Midlife Crisis single, as well as a couple of other releases. Please refer to the Discography for details. The new version has a few small additions from Roddy's keyboards, apart from the obvious inclusion of Patton.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n30. What are the meanings of various songs?\n\nFirst of all, here's a quote for you:\n\n\"I think that too many people think too much about my lyrics. I am more a person who works with the sound of a word than with its meaning. Often I just choose the words because of the rhythm not because of the meaning.\"\n\n- Mike Patton\n\nWith that in mind, we can have a look at some explanations of song meanings from the band themselves.\n\nA Small Victory\n\nPatton: \"Its kind of about, well my dad was a coach, so I grew up and I always wanted to win. And well, I found out that I just cant win every game...darn it.\"\n\nMidlife Crisis\n\nPatton: \"The song is based on a lot of observation and a lot of speculation. But in sort of a pointed way its kind of about Madonna...I think it was a particular time where I was being bombarded with her image on TV and in magazines and her whole schtick kind of speaks to me in that way...like she's going through some sort of problem. It seems she's getting a bit desperate.\" Mike has also said that its not so much about a midlife crisis, as he couldnt empathise in what it would feel like, but \"it's more about creating false emotion, being emotional, dwelling on your emotions and in a sense inventing them.\"\n\nRV\n\nWhen FNM write songs, sometimes they see them visually first. They communicate to each other visually what they want the song to sound like. This technique was used when writing RV (which stands for Recreational Vehicle). The visualization as described by Mike Patton was a \"fat guy sitting in a trailer, eating horrible food, watching horrible TV, maybe beating his kids every once in a while or abusing his wife. Thats what that song is about. Thats a whole, I would say, culture in America, of working class, white-trash Americana.\"\n\nCrack Hitler\n\nBilly: \"'Crack Hitler' is about this drug baron who takes Crack and compares himself with Hitler, because he commands enough depended people. So he thinks he's the biggest one...you know what's funny about all this? His skin is not even white! He's coloured and he thinks he's Hitler? We all laughed a lot about him, so we had to dedicate him a song.\"\n\nBe Aggressive\n\nRoddy, who came out in 1992, wrote the lyrics to this song. Roddy, when asked what the song was about in a 1992 interview for \"The Advocate,\" replied \"Swallowing. It was a pretty fun thing to write, knowing that Mike was going to have to put himself on the line and go up onstage and sing these vocals.\"\n\nMalpractice\n\nPatton: \"It's about a lady who goes to a surgeon and she's getting operated on and she realizes she likes the surgeon's hand inside of her. She doesn't even care about being cured, she just wants someone's hands inside of her - she gets addicted to that.\"\n\nCaralho Voador\n\nBilly: \"Well we all know what Caralho Voador is right? Its like this flying dick right. Well its about a man in his car, whos just a fucked up old man, he drives around the city and hes picking his nose. And basically he's a dick, and the car is like his wings. He flies around the city and he's like a flying dick.\"\n\nBack to the Top\n\n31. What are all the songs which do not appear on the albums?

What were the alternate song titles used by the band?\n\nIt's humorous when a band member didn't know a song title and had to ask \"What's the song that goes, \"This is the best party I've ever been to?\"\". This is because the band went by code names for the songs. So here now are some of them.\n\nWorking titles:\n\nKing For A Day = Acoustic Groove\n\nThe Last To Know = Dirge\n\nCaralho Voador = The Velvet Hammer\n\nCuckoo For Caca = The First Song\n\nBe Aggressive = I Swallow\n\nSmaller And Smaller = Arabic (AKA The Arabian Song)\n\nRV = Macaroni and Cheese\n\nCrack Hitler = Action Adventure\n\nKindergarten = F Sharp\n\n? = Slow Song\n\nShe Loves Me Not = Michael Jack Song\n\nStripsearch = Seal\n\nSet list titles:\n\nMidlife Crisis = Madonna/Midlife/Mid\n\nBe Aggressive = Funk\n\nZombie Eaters = Zombie\n\nEvidence = Blues/Evidence\n\nWhat A Day = Old\n\nCaffeine = Trip/Caffeine\n\nIntroduce Yourself = Intro/Introduce\n\nGet Out = Patton III/Get\n\nCaralho Voador = Bossa Nova\n\nKing For A Day = Acoustic\n\nDigging The Grave = Punk\n\nJust a Man = Man/Piano\n\nThe Gentle Art of Making Enemies = Patton II/Gentle Art\n\nWe Care A Lot = Care/Care A Lot\n\nEpic = Epic\n\nEasy = Easy\n\nRicochet = Nirvana\n\nI Started A Joke = I Started A Joke\n\nAshes To Ashes = Ashes\n\nNaked In Front Of The Computer = Naked\n\nHome Sick Home = Homesick\n\nLand of Sunshine = Whitney\n\nLast Cup Of Sorrow = Last Cup/Cup\n\nCollision = Collision\n\nPaths of Glory = NIN\n\nGot That Feeling = Feeling\n\nSurprise! You're Dead! = Surprise\n\nMidnight Cowboy = Cowboy\n\nStripsearch = Strip\n\n\"This Guy's in Love\" - Bach/Bacharach\n\nSetlist name and working title:\n\nRicochet = Nirvana\n\nBack to the Top\n\n33. Why was 'Ricochet' referred to as 'Nirvana'? Were they all big fans and 'Ricochet' is a tribute?\n\nFrom interviews in 1992 and 1995, Billy and Roddy expressed an interest in the band. Roddy was friends with Kurt and Courtney also. However neither of these factors are the actual reason. 'Ricochet' was written the day of Kurt's suicide, and that is the only reason we have been given for this.\n\nAnd while we're on the subject of Nirvana, is it true that the song \"Star A.D.\" was inspired by Kurt Cobain's death?\n\nNo. When asked this question, Mike Patton had the following to say: \"Kurt? God no! It's about a phenomenon. And if that guy happened to be one, I don't know. It's one of those things that happen; it's a Vegas thing. What could be more shameful than having to change your colostomy bag onstage?! Vegas is great, though. I love it. Welcome to America.\"\n\nBack to the Top\n\n34. What are ex-Faith No More band members doing now?\n\nJim Martin - Jim had his own project called 'Jim Martin'. Initially it was called 'The Behemoth' but he had to change the name as it was already being used by a band in Europe. He has a solo album out called \"Milk and Blood\" on the label CBH/SPV, on which he covers \"Surprise! You're Dead!\". Latest Jim release is called Anand Bhatt and Jim Martin - Conflict on (Sonic Wave International / Living Dead Music).\n\nChuck Mosely - The Chuck Mosely Theory, Cement, VUA\n\nTrey Spruance - Mr. Bungle, Faxed Head, 3 Doctors Band, Secret Chiefs 3, Nottingturd Fan, Tub ring.\n\nDean Menta - Duh\n\nFor details on the members of the final FNM line-up, please see next Question.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n35. What other projects have FNM involved themselves with?\n\nApart from Faith No More, each member of the band pursued other musical interests with different bands and projects, most of which still continue. It would be unfair to refer to them as side projects as is commonly the case, as most of them are treated with as much importance as Faith No More was.\n\nMike Patton -\n\nSolo Work\n\nMike has recorded two albums as a solo artist. The first titled Adult Themes For Voice (1996) which contains sound effects created by voice and microphone, recorded on a four track in various hotel rooms throughout the world (so it says). The locations of the hotels would suggest the sounds were recorded while Faith No More were on tour in 92/95. Whether this could actually be described as music has been debated. It is, nevertheless, an interesting listen.\n\nMike's second album is composed by him, but is by no means a solo album. Pranzo Oltranzista (1997) \"magically transports the listener to a surreal ambient world of the unexpected\" and features the talents of Erik Friedlander on cello, Marc Ribot on guitar, William Winant on percussion, John Zorn on alto saxophone and Mike doing voice and sound effects. The album follows the theme of food. The CD sleeve contains various recipes for each piece, and over the music noises associated with food, such as chopping and chewing, can be heard. Both albums are on Tzadik Records, Composer Series.\n\nMike, at times, appears at festivals and other shows around the world performing his unique vocal contortions similar to what appears on his two albums. He has performed in groups named House of Discipline and Perfect Victim which also include artists such as John Zorn, Merzbow, Ikue Mori, David Slusser, Bob Ostertag and several others.\n\nAdult Themes For Voice (1996) TZ 7015\n\nPranzo Oltranzista (1997) TZ 7022\n\nMaldoror-She (1999) (collaboration with Japanese noise guru Masami \"Merzbow\" Akita) IPC-003\n\nMr. Bungle\n\nMike is still an active member of the band which he has been in since high school, Mr. Bungle. Mr. Bungle is presently comprised of Mike on vocals, Trey Spruance on guitar and keyboards, Trevor Dunn on bass, Danny Heifetz on drums, Clinton 'Bär' McKinnon on tenor sax and keyboards and Theo Lengyel on alto sax. On the last two albums and subsequent tours, percussionist William Winant accompanied them. Whether he is to become a seventh member of the band is yet to be seen.

The band's debut, self-titled album was released on Patton's own record label Ipecac Records.

Mike Bordin was one of the guests on the album, alongside Slash and Izzy Stradlin.\n\nGuest appearances by Mike Bordin on various albums\n\nPrimus 'Sailing the Sees of Cheese' - (1991)\n\nVarious Artists: Flyin' Traps - \"Choked\" by Tim Alexander & Mike Bordin (1997)\n\nJerry Cantrell 'Degradation Trip' (2002)\n\nPrimus 'Frizzle fry' (2002)\n\nBill Gould -\n\nBrujeria\n\nBill plays with a death metal band Brujeria (pronounced Broo-her-ria).

In this band, Roddy takes on a different role to what we are used to, as Imperial Teen shows his talents as a singer and guitarist (and occasional drummer). The quartet consists of Roddy on vocals and guitar, Lynn Perko on drums, Will Schwartz on vocals and guitar also and Jone Stebbins on bass.\n\nSeasick, 1996 Slash/London\n\nWhat Is Not To Love, 1999 Slash/London\n\nOn, 2002 Merge Records\n\nRoddy played keyboards on L7's 'Hungry For Stink' album, on the song \"Riding With A Movie Star\".

These are the only known recordings of the band.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n36. What was Mike Patton's involvement with Sepultura?\n\nMike and the Sepultura guys have known each other personally for quite some time. On Sepultura's album 'Roots', Mike sang vocals on track 8, 'Lookaway'. The lyrics were written by Jonathan Davis of Korn, who also did vocals on that track. Mike co-wrote a song with Sepultura called 'Mine'. It appeared as a b-side on certain editions of Sepultura's 'Attitude' single, as well as 'Blood Rooted', the Sepultura b-sides album. Mike Patton also did the vocals on this song. In 1999, Patton added vocals to the track previously titled \"Kamaitachi\" and it was re-released as \"The Waste\". Mike also appeared on a Brazilian soundtrack: \"No Coração dos Deuses\" (In the Heart of Gods) - the track is \"Procura o Cara\" which means \"Look for the Man\" in Portuguese, and features members of Sepultura along with Patton on vocals.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n37.

It also has Mr. Bungle's 'Travolta' (Quote Unquote) video in the middle. Three guys received this video in Brazil: A journalist, Max Cavalera (former Sepultura vocalist/guitarist) and Joäo Gordo (Ratos de Poräo vocalist). There are scenes of people dying and others eating faeces. Gordo wrote a song for it after having watched the tape. He also reviewed it for a Brazilian magazine. The song appears on the 1994 album \"Just another crime in massacreland\", on Roadrunner Records.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n38. What is FNM's connection with Primus?\n\nMike Bordin appears in the credits on most of Primus' releases. Here are some details:\n\nOn the first Primus album'Frizzle Fry', the following credits appear: \"Special thanx to Susan and Howard for letting us spill bong water into their console (the Exxon/Puffy conspiracy)\".\n\nFaith No More is thanked on 'Suck On This', \"Hugs and Kisses to Faith No More\".\n\nOn 'Tales from the Punchbowl', in the song \"Over the Electric Grapevine\" Primus mentioned Introduce Yourself: \"Then 'Introduce Yourself' came on as they barreled through the fog.\" On 'Sailing The Seas Of Cheese' Bordin is credited as playing the \"Two-Skinned Foreskin Drum\" on track 13 -'Los Bastardos'. He is also listed as one of the Bastardos under drums and vocals as 'Puffster'.\n\nJim Martin plays guitar on \"Eclectic Electric\", a track on Primus' 1999 album \"Antipop\"\n\nBack to the Top\n\n39. Where is some of the different cover artwork from?\n\nThe US Single for Midlife Crisis, which has a photo of the band in Red Square with a group of soldiers, is obviously not real. The Band's faces were put onto the faces of the people in the picture. The guy in between Mike and Jim was in the original picture, and is not connected with the band in any way.\n\nThe King For A Day...Fool For A Lifetime artwork comes from a book called Flood: A Novel In Pictures, by Eric Drooker. ISBN 0-941423-79-4\n\nThe Album of the Year artwork is explained in Question #47\n\nBack to the Top\n\n40. Were any other samples, besides Kronos Quartet, used on Angel Dust? Any on the other albums?\n\nFor Angel Dust, these have been listed: Simon and Garfunkel, Z'ev and music from The Wizard Of Oz.\n\nThe Simon and Garfunkel song that was sampled is called \"Cecilia,\" and it appears in \"Midlife Crisis\" (in the drum track).\n\nThe barking/howling at the beginning of \"Caffeine\" was heard in the movie \"A Rose for Emily,\" but it is likely that both the movie and FNM got the sound from a collection of stock sound effects, which Roddy has mentioned using.\n\nThere's also a squeaky part of Midlife Crisis which sounds a lot like it could be sampled from Car Thief by the Beastie Boys, off the Paul's Boutique album. This is yet to be confirmed.\n\nThe sample in 'Collision', off 'Album Of The Year' is taken from a cb radio.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n41.

He was a very aristocratic president at a time when Czechoslovakia was one of the richest countries in the world. His funeral was HUGE (they are the shots on the album artwork) and his death took place on the eve of WW2. If there is any symbolic importance, it is the depiction of the death of a 'golden age.'\"\n\nThe artwork was also used on FNM Tour T-shirts in Europe. A lot of people are of the opinion that the man pictured is 'Lenin'. He isn't. Billy had this to say:\n\n\"I realized that his \"death mask\" face looked alot like Lenin, but not until after the shirts were printed. We might change it.\"\n\nThe name of the president is Tomas Garrigue Masaryk (1850-1937). He was the first president of independent Czechoslovakia (1918).\n\nInside the CD sleeve in the funeral picture, the words \"Pravda Vitezi\" appear on the coffin. \"Pravda Videzi\" translates to \"Knight of truth - Knight if integrity\". It means \"Truth will prevail\" / \"The truth wins\". It's a phrase which appears on the Czech president's flag.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n48. What is going on in Last Cup Of Sorrow Video? Is it based on something?\n\nFaith No More latest video for their single \"Last Cup Of Sorrow\" have you confused? Well, don't be. Here's a brief explanation:\n\nThe video is based, more or less, around the Alfred Hitchcock cult classic film Vertigo, which stars movie legends James Stewart and Kim Novak in the leading roles. So if many scenes from the video strike you as confusing, odd, or out of place...don't worry. It's okay; not everyone is expected to have seen Vertigo. But if you're interested in getting the full \"effect\" of the clip, read on.\n\nThe main character Scotty, a veteran police officer, played by Stewart in the film and Mike Patton in the video, suffers from severe acrophobia (a fear of heights and falling). In the line of duty, when a fellow officer hangs from a roof top, Scotty is left immobilized by a fear of heights and allows the man to fall (*this scene is clearly present in the very beginning of the \"Last Cup\" video*).\n\nBecause of his fear, he is forced to retire from the police department until he finds a suitable cure. (*Mike Patton can be seen on a stepping stool looking \"Up. Down.\" when he passes out from his fear*) Enter Scotty's long time friend Gavin Elster (*not represented in the video*) who asks him to follow his wife, Madeline (Kim Novak; *represented by actress Jennifer Jason Leigh in the video*), whom he says is both \"possessed\" and \"suicidal\".\n\nAlthough Scotty is at first wary of the task at hand, once he sees Madeline he must follow through as he is instantly attracted by her beauty. The chase leads Scotty to find Madeline visiting gravesites (*shown in the video, while Billy Gould seems to be portraying the character Madeline is obsessed with in the film*), staring at old paintings for hours on end, and visiting old rundown hotel rooms through out San Fransisco.\n\nThe plot takes yet another twist when Scotty witnesses Madeline's fall into the San Francisco Bay and he saves her from what seems to be an failed suicide attempt (*this is in the video, you can't miss it*). They are forced to begin a face to to face relationship and Scotty soon falls deeply in love with her. But Madeline's obsession with death grows worse and when she describes an old mission she had seen in a dream, Scotty brings her there in an attempt to snap her out of her suicidal state. Once there, Madeline dashes for a bell tower in a suicidal attempt but Scotty's fear of heights prevents him from saving her this time around. (*Patton chases Leigh up the towers stairs; looks down the staircase and gets dizzy, a body is shown falling through a window of the tower* - a scene right out of the movie.)\n\nUnable to continue with his life, Scotty is still obssessed with the dead love, Madeline. One day he meets a woman who looks nearly identical to his lost love, who goes by the name of Judy Barton (*represented in the video by Leigh wearing a black wig*). Judy herself also has her secrets which soon throw Scotty back into a world in which he must battle illusion and reality (*the scene with the floating Patton head and the trippy background is taken from the original film*).\n\nNow, I don't want to give too much of the film away...but you get the basic idea. The film was recently re-mastered and re-released in widescreen format and can be found at nearly any local or chain video store, so go pick it up if you're curious. But keep in mind, not all of the scenes or ideas in the video were taken from the movie (pornography, cross dressing, Mike Bordin eating a bagel). It seems the basic ideas, themes, plot, and characters were used to convey their own story, so a lot of what's happening is really up in the air.\n\n- Thanks to Nick Chester for this analysis.\n\nBack to the Top\n\n49.

I have 'The Real Thing' on CD, but I see the album on audio cassette and it says it has two extra songs! Should I buy this to complete my collection?\n\nNo need to stress. The two extra songs which are mentioned are 'War Pigs' and 'Edge of the World'. They are listed as 'two extra songs' as they were not included on the vinyl version of 'TRT'. The CD does have it, so if you have that, don't bother!\n\nBack to the Top\n\n51.
