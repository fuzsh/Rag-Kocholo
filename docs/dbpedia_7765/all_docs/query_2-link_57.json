        "text": "FAITH NO MORE – “From Out of Nowhere” (1990 Slash records 3 track 7″ single)\n\nWhen I was beginning to seriously collect Faith No More in 1991 onwards, I had no idea what was out there. I found the UK 7″ single for “From Out of Nowhere” at a record show in Guelph. There are different versions of this single out there with “Cowboy Song” on the B-side, but that track can also be found on Live at the Brixton Academy. The UK single on Slash/London has two live tracks you can’t find anywhere else, recorded by the BBC on March 2 1990. Shortly after “Epic” was released as a single, but before it went mega.\n\nThe problem is, with 10 minutes of music squeezed onto the B-side, this single sounds horribly thin and is ridiculously quiet. Tons of surface noise too. The A-side, which spins at 45 rpm, is better. Have a look at the unaltered waveform in Audacity for comparison.\n\nFaith No More didn’t truly make it big until the end of the (first) vinyl age. The album version of “From Out of Nowhere” was always an excellent song; one of their most “mainstream” if you can call it that. The keyboard hook is the main angle, and Patton’s notable for using that clean nasal voice he discontinued not long after. An excellent song, and a cornerstone of any nutritious Faith No More collection.\n\nThe B-side, the exclusive live recordings, rotates at 33 1/3 rpm. Captured in Norwich, “Woodpecker From Mars” is Faith No More’s instrumental classic led by a keyboard violin voice by Roddy Bottum. There is a different performance on a home video called You Fat Bastards (which is the complete Brixton set) but nothing else on audio. “Epic” is disappointingly edited by the BBC. They obscure the line where Mike Patton naughtily sings “get down on it and fuck it some more.” The band sound fresh and almost green with enthusiasm for the song, playing it a bit more straight than they would later on.\n\nOn the plus side, this single comes packaged in a gatefold sleeve, a rarity for 7″ release. Inside Mike Patton is givin’ ‘er live on stage. Some kids probably taped this to the wall as-is.\n\nIn short, the music is great. The vinyl is not.\n\n2.5/5 stars\n\nFAITH NO MORE – We Care a Lot (Originally 1985, 2016 Deluxe Band Edition)\n\nIn 1985, roughly when a young band called Mr. Bungle was forming elsewhere in California, the legendary Faith No More released their debut album. Original pressings and reissues have the band name written as “Faith. No More.” It was a version of their name that they’d soon drop. The lineup of Chuck Mosely, Jim Martin, Roddy Bottum, Billy Gould and Mike Bordin put together a low-budget debut that garnered them enough attention for their next album to be distruibuted by Warner. A viable career as a rock band followed. As a result of this fruitful career, in 2016 We Care a Lot was officially reissued with a load of bonus tracks and full participation from producer Matt Wallace. As the liner notes say, “We’re putting this out because we can.”\n\nThis reissue includes four demos, and interestingly they reveal that there was an instrumental “Intro” for this album that was apparently dropped. This sci-fi, keyboard-led intro would have been an interesting way to kick off the album with some atmosphere and foreboding. (For a custom listening experience, try playing the album with the instrumental first.) The disc instead commences directly with “We Care A Lot”, the first version mind you, not the hit single you know. The sound is a tad more primitive and the lyrics were different in several places. The “NASA Shuttle” hadn’t fallen into the sea yet in 1985, so it is Los Angeles that Chuck cares a lot about it. Instead of the Transformers, he gives a shout-out to Mr. T.\n\n“Jungle” is a disorienteing series of head-punches with reverse-echo. A jagged Jim Martin riff and staggering Mike Bordin drum pattern makes it a relentless slam. Chuck Mosely sounds frantic, unstable and urgent. The same relentless approach pounds your head on “Mark Bowen”, slower but no less imposing. Though Chuck is all over the map with his scattershot vocals, the band is solidly ominous behind him.\n\nAn absolutely beautiful acoustic interlude called “Jim” reveals a previously unknown part of Martin’s talents. Though less articulate, this kind of composition sounds like the ones Randy Rhodes would include on an Ozzy record. And just like with Ozzy, next it’s something heavy to slam. That something is “Why Do You Bother”, the original side one closer. Tense and rhythmic, it’s a tornado of fun.\n\nSide two boasts several standout tracks. Certainly “As the Worm Turns” has earned its place in Faith No More history, since Mike Patton re-recorded it in the studio and performed it live numerous times. Its cascading keyboard melody contrasts with the heavy riff. This version is rougher, but no less perfect. “Greed”, which opens the side, is also notable. It reads like a rejection letter from record labels. “They say that when I’m supposed to be singin’, all I’m really doin’ is yelling!” Though one doesn’t think Chuck would have been sensitive to such criticism, he does seem stung that “they say that I can’t sing, that I don’t say a thing, that I make everything up.” But he defiantly strikes back with a heartfelt melody delivered at maximum intensity.\n\nFor thunder, check out “Pills for Breakfast”, another instrumental anchored by a Jim Martin riff that could move mountains. Martin’s guitar gives “Arabian Disco” a solid spine, and Mosely shoves in as much melody as he’s got to give. Only here at the tail end of the album does the quality of the songs dip at all. “New Beginnings” is too laid back compared to the rest of the disc, bordering on dull.\n\nFaith No More have been blessed with a number of (arguably) 5/5 star albums in a row: Introduce Yourself (1987), The Real Thing (1989), Angel Dust (1991) and King For a Day (1995). We Care A Lot isn’t quite at that lofty point yet, but it wouldn’t take long. Chuck Mosely’s unique approach of “yelling when he’s supposed to be singing” isn’t for everything and wasn’t fully harnessed in the studio until the next album. But all the ingredients are here, on the first record, ready to explode in every direction. Fortunately for you, this CD edition goes on for another nine bonus tracks!\n\nSome 2016 remixes by Matt Wallace add more punch to the originals: “We Care A Lot”, “Pills For Breakfast”, and “As The Worm Turns” are given the remix treatment. Less echo; louder and punchier guitars. No structural changes. Three of the best tracks were selected, and sound great if played on a shuffle with later Faith No More classics. The next batch of bonus tracks are four demos (including the aforementioned “Intro”). Dig into early version of “Greed”, “Mark Bowen” and “Arabian Disco”. The arrangements are all more or less intact, and the recording is so good that they could have been released long before.\n\nFinally there are two live tracks from San Francisco in 1986. “Jungle” (with a segue into “Shout” by Tears For Fears) and “New Beginnings” are bootleg quality, but look what they have done in terms of track selection. There are no songs repeated among the bonus tracks. Between the demos, remixes and live versions, eight of the album’s ten are present in alternate versions. That’s value for the consumer.\n\nSnag We Care A Lot if you see one in the wild, but absolutely aim for the 2016 Deluxe Band Edition.\n\n4/5 stars\n\nRoddy Bottum is a man of many talents. A multi-instrumentalist, Roddy might be best known for his bands Faith No More and Imperial Teen. Roddy is also a composer and Sasquatch: The Opera is his first entry on that stage, but surely not the last.\n\nAn opera about Sasquatch? What’s the deal with that? It’s been a difficult journey. I had the chance to question on Roddy about it and his other projects. Read it from the man himself.\n\nMike: Sasquatch: The Opera has to be the most intriguing three-word title I’ve ever seen. I understand the story is about the misunderstood “monster”, but how did you settle on the Sasquatch for your monster? I’m a bit of a Sasquatch geek, and I’m curious if you are too.\n\nRoddy: It’s a character I always identified with. The ‘gentle giant’ aspect of him I kind of created myself. It’s a characteristic I always am moved by in literature and film. Elephant Man, King Kong, Frankenstein… the vulnerability of the misunderstood oaf, if you will. I’m also very sexually attracted to exactly that type.\n\nMike: Would you ever go on a Sasquatch expedition?\n\nRoddy: I think I could entertain that voyage in a ‘social studies’ kind of way but I would be hard pressed to putting my best foot forward in the hopes of finding the monster. I want to believe. I really do. It’s like being taught religion as a child. I remain sceptical and needing of proof.\n\nMike: Absolutely understood; I hope one day we find that proof. How would you describe the music, is it a “rock opera”? I have to assume it’s a little different!\n\nRoddy: The instrumentation is timpani drums, drum machine, two synthesizers and two trumpets. It’s not exactly rock but it’s more rock than symphonic. I kind of based the musical vibe all around the timpanis. The grandeur of that instruments spoke a lot in the presentation of the piece.\n\nMike: Do you perform on stage in the musical?\n\nRoddy: I did, yeah, I conducted the piece and played a synthesizer. The one with the easier parts.\n\nMike: Did you compose Sasquatch primarily on the keyboard?\n\nRoddy: Yes, first in my head and then on the keyboard.\n\nMike: I read about the apartment fire you had while in the midst of working on Sasquatch. You had to recreate the Opera from scratch, replace props and costumes? Are you happy with how it turned out?\n\nRoddy: The fire gave me the opportunity to create from a clean slate something that I’d already done before. I like that process, actually. The fire was really and truly one of the worst tragedies I’ve had to go through. The cliche of the open window that happens as a result of a closed one, though. That rang true. Still, though I’m spooked by fire and I can’t eat barbecue or mescal or anything with a smokey after taste. Too soon.\n\nMike: I can’t even imagine what that is like…I love barbecue. Can we expect another musical from you?\n\nRoddy: Yes, I’d like to create another opera that’s about the fall of a nation. Particularly America in this political climate.\n\nMike: I’d be into that. Now, I was going to go and see Sasquatch with my mom. She’s in her 70s and maybe a little old fashioned. Do you think my mom would have a good time, or would I regret bringing her?\n\nRoddy: I got some of my best criticisms from people older than myself. I’m 55. I like to think of the themes as universal though there are some elements of incest and drug use that seem to disturb people. How open minded is your Mom?\n\nMike: She’s pretty cool, I think she can handle it. Could Sasquatch get a CD or DVD release?\n\nRoddy: I honestly like to keep the opera in the realm of ‘shrouded in mystery.’ In keeping with the allure and mystique of Sasquatch, the being, I would prefer that the only people who witness my monster and my music are the ones in the theatre who come to see it. It’s too easy for people to listen to something online. I’m not into the lazy attendant factor of that, if that makes sense.\n\nMike: It does, I have heard stand-up comedians say similar things. It should be just in the moment. Moving on, can you update us on the next Imperial Teen record? I heard it was in the mixing stages.\n\nRoddy: We just finished the record, mastered it last week and are working on the album artwork. It’s got 10 songs, it’s called Now We Are Timeless and it will come out on Merge Records July 12.\n\nMike: I hope you don’t mind a little fan-geek questioning. I am a music collector. I pride myself in having “almost everything” for many bands I love, but one “holy grail” item would be a live Faith No More bootleg with Courtney Love on vocals. I have been searching for years…decades! Does such a thing exist or is that era now lost to the sands of time?\n\nRoddy: I believe the only audio recording of Courtney singing with us is on a VHS recording of a daytime public access television show recorded in San Francisco in 1984. Courtney wore a dirty white slip and brought into the studio bags and bags of old flowers she collected from the flower mart. We decorated the stage and lit incense and performed in dashikis.\n\nMike: If it exists, I will find it one day! Regarding Faith No More, I think Sol Invictus is a fantastic record. Among your best. I usually give the rare “5/5 star rating” to Introduce Yourself, Angel Dust, and King for a Day. Now I have added Sol Invictus to that list. You don’t strike me as the kind of band that puts out albums you aren’t happy with, but the reception to Sol Invictus was overwhelmingly positive. With a few years hindsight, how happy are you with Sol Invictus today?\n\nRoddy: I think it’s a strong record, thank you. I’m glad we were in a position to not have to pander to radio playlist or whatever. We made the record we wanted to make and really didn’t compromise at any stage.\n\nMike: Is that you on vocals in the verses to “Motherfucker”?\n\nRoddy: It is, yes, and thank you for noticing.\n\nMike: Do you have any other projects cooking currently that you can tell us about?\n\nRoddy: I’m in a band called Nastie Band. Our record will come out in April. It features an 84 year old singer, a pair of identical twins, a drummer and guitarist and many theatrical elements. It’s a performance band, very dark. Another band I’m in is called Crickets. We’re going away this weekend on a writing retreat. Michael O’Neil and JD Samson are both in that band and we liken ourselves to a wobbly dance sound a-la Tom Tom Club. We have our first show in New York in February.\n\nIt sounds like 2019 is shaping up to be an exciting year for Roddy Bottum. Be sure to check out the Nastie Band in April, and the new Imperial Teen record Now We Are Timeless in July. Thank you Roddy for the chat!\n\nFAITH NO MORE – Introduce Yourself (1987 Slash)\n\nFaith No More’s second LP (and major label debut) is their only so far not to have received a deluxe or expanded edition. The bizarre thing about that is that Introduce Yourself is one of their best, totally deserving the honour. Faith No More have several 5/5 star albums in their catalogue, and Introduce Yourself is [spoiler] one of them [end spoiler].\n\nChuck Mosley was the singer, a bizarre frontman with a totally unique style and a penchant for putting stuff in his dreadlocks. One of his lyrics says it best. On the first Faith No More album, he wrote “They say that when I’m supposed to be singing, all I’m really doing is yelling, oh well…” Mosley’s stuffy-nose stylings are an acquired taste, especially if you have only heard Mike Patton. In Faith No More, it worked and set up what Mike Patton was able to do later on. Mosley is melodic in a bizarre, off key way.\n\n“Faster Disco” isn’t that at all. It’s mid-tempo Faith No More, in the style they created and mastered. There is a chunky guitar riff (or two). There is an underscore of keyboards holding down the melodic foundation. There is a solid beat, and a strangely catchy multi-tracked vocal.\n\nFaith No More are also known for funky Billy Gould bass beats, and that’s “Anne’s Song”. Chuck has a conversational vocal, sorta-rapped, sorta-spoken. It too is strangely memorable, and it was one of two singles.\n\nThe title track “Introduce Yourself” is fast and fun, and also lives up to its name! Chuck introduces the band in the lyrics, but the song is so incredibly fast that it’s over in 1:30. Too bad, because it’s awesome. Another style Faith No More are known for is the “dark and ominous” song. “Chinese Arithmetic” is one of those, a weighty track with keyboards providing glimmers of light. One of the strangest tracks is the staggering “Death March”, which is also hilarious. “How much for a transfer, man? 95 cents? Fuck you, I’ll skate to the beach! And look better getting there!”\n\nThe most famed track is “We Care a Lot”, the most well known single from this album and also the title track from the prior album. The lyrics were updated and the music re-recorded. This version is the best one, what with that line about “We care a lot / about Transformers, cuz there’s more than meets the eye!”\n\n“R n’ R” is caffeinated Faith No More, blowing down the doors with hard rapping and riffing. Then is “The Crab Song”, which Mike Patton once described as a “sad song”. It has that, and it also has the split personality thing going on. Halfway in, it abruptly changes into a riffy, bass-slappy stomp. At almost six minutes long, it’s one of the earliest examples of Faith No More creating mini-epics by assembling seemingly mismatched components.\n\nIntroduce Yourself concludes with a pair of fast, impacting song. “Blood” is carried by a lofty keyboard part, and hammered forth by a relentless Chuck Mosley. Then “Spirit” is the finishing touch, a heavy-as-fuck Jim Martin guitar riff. In the back, drummer Mike Bordin is physically assaulting his kit. Mosley puts his throat to full intensity as the band rips all the way to the end.\n\nIntroduce Yourself is brilliant, and it’s easy to overlook it because Mike Patton has since become a dominant presence. Introduce Yourself is every bit as challenging, intense, unorthodox, melodic and heavy as any of their later albums. Do not dismiss it; instead make it a priority.\n\n5/5 stars\n\nFAITH NO MORE – “Cone of Shame” (2016 Reclamation Recordings 7″ single for Record Store Day, gold vinyl)\n\nAll hail the mighty JHUBNER, decorated hard-core hunter…of records. Raise your Romulan ale (or what have you)! Somewhere somehow, the subject of limited edition Faith No More singles for Record Store Day came up. Mr. Hubner kindly took note that he had seen some at his local establishment. With great care and expense, he packed it well, armored in a shell of cardboard that could withstand any wayward bombardments. Thusly, I have acquired “Cone of Shame” on limited edition clear gold vinyl. Had I thought this through, I would have asked for green, to compliment this burning green alcoholic beverage that Scotty below is hoisting to Mr. Hubner.\n\nThis is a gorgeous 45. The cover art is quite funny: a pug (with eyes blacked out for anonymity) wearing a doggie “cone of shame”. Would have been better with a miniature schnauzer, but pugs are fine. The vintage style label is starkly awesome in black & white. The pristine yellow disc is a piece of beauty indeed, clean and clear and rich with awesome music carved into its grooves.\n\nThe A-side is the standard album version of “Cone of Shame” from Sol Invictus. This is a song I have strongly warmed up to in the last year. I didn’t care for it at first, but I have since fallen for its weirdness and Patton’s vocal heroics. Flip over to the B-side and you will find J.G. Thirwell’s “Calcitron Mix” of “Motherfucker”. I love what he did with it. Most of Patton’s voice has been wiped leaving only Roddy Bottum’s hypnotic verses. The word “motherfucker” is chopped and looped to become the main hook. There is very little of the original song left. Essentially a new song has been created with Roddy’s “get the motherfucker on the phone, on the phone” hook, chopped up and given the Max Headroom treatment. The techno backing feels like a bunch of idiots at a rave, but that’s not my thing. I’m easily amused so the rearrangement and repetition of the word “motherfucker” keeps me entertained.\n\nRemixes are what they are. You either like them or you don’t. I usually lean towards the opinion that an original is better than a remix, 99% of the time. There are the odd exceptions. I think you need to use a different measuring stick when talking about remixes. Instead of “did it make the song better”, perhaps the question should be “did it make the song different?” In this case “Motherfucker” has been reimagined as something new, and that’s pretty cool.\n\n3.5/5 stars\n\nFAITH NO MORE – The Real Thing (originally 1989, 2015 Slash records deluxe edition)\n\nFans of discerning taste cried tears of joy when Faith No More, one of the most underappreciated bands of recent times, finally received the deluxe edition treatment. Faith No More may have paved the way for more popular acts like as Korn, System of a Down and Incubus, but they seemed forgotten by new young rock fans. These deluxe editions have put their classic albums back on the racks.\n\nThough The Real Thing is the album that launched them onto MTV and contains their best known hit (“Epic”), it’s the only Faith No More album that sounds like this. Mike Patton affected a nasal tone to his singing that he dropped by the next album. (Producer Mike Wallace suggests that Patton sang this way on The Real Thing partially to separate Faith No More from Mr. Bungle, who he still had massive loyalties to.) It’s the most mainstream and most “metal” of their albums, with much of their other material being more abstract, artsy and bizarre. Though they loathed the term, you can hear how Faith No More were considered “funk metal” from 1989-92.\n\nOpener “From Out of Nowhere” is a living embodiment of its own title. A keyboard and guitar riff, simple and catchy, pummel the speakers as Mike Patton makes his debut. Original singer Chuck Mosely was gone and Patton emerged, fresh from the aforementioned Mr. Bungle. Nobody had ever heard anything like Mike Patton before. His range and power were enviable, but he clearly liked taking the piss too. “From Out of Nowhere” was the first single and a brilliant choice for trying to sway the uninitiated.\n\nOf course “Epic” was the big one. Its timely combination of rap and metal was on the cutting edge. The lyrics were nonsense* and Patton’s goofy personality shone through. It was close to the edge of novelty. Jim Martin’s power chords and harmony leads kept things from falling off. On the rhythm, Mike “Puffy” Bordin is one hard-hitting drummer, keeping things anchored solidly. You can really hear the funk on “Falling to Pieces”. It’s there in Billy Gould’s bass and Patton’s soulful (nasal) voice. This too was a single, following the smash hit of “Epic”.\n\nFaith No More also crossed over to the thrash crowd with “Surprise! You’re Dead!”. An aggressive banger like this was custom made for Anthrax fans. Most importantly, Mike Patton got to show off some of what he is capable of. The guttural howls, painful shrieks, and insane laughs burrow into your ears. They are hooks themselves, though certainly not in the traditional sense! This is a contrast to “Zombie Eaters”, with quiet acoustic sections and intricate picking by Martin. “Zombie Eaters” does not stay that way, and soon transitions into a rumbling, earthquake riff. Roddy Bottum’s keyboards add tension, and Mike Patton piles anguish on top of that. An even more powerful song follows: “The Real Thing”, 8:01 of light/shade and dramatic performances.\n\nPop and funk collide on “Underwater Love”, the most accessible song on the album. It evolved live into something very different, as you will hear on disc two. Patton did it with more of his own style once they got it out on stage. “The Morning After” has a haunting vibe, moving into a heavier chorus. Jim Martin’s guitars are clearly in the metal domain, like the odd man out, but still essential.\n\nThe album begins to drift to a close with “Woodpecker From Mars”, the only instrumental. Roddy has his keyboard set to the “violin” tone, and is the lead melodic focus of this punishing track. Everything else is a blur of guitars, drums and bass. Their unique cover of “War Pigs” is next, though pretty straight-laced compared to the live version on disc 2. Finally “Edge of the World” closes the album with a slow piano waltz completely unlike anything else on the album.\n\nThe second disc has a wealth of treasure, though not all the B-sides and rarities out there. “Sweet Emotion” was released a few years back on The Very Best Definitive Ultimate Greatest Hits Collection, but its original source is a flexi-disc from Kerrang! magazine. It is not an Aerosmith cover; rather it is an early version of “The Perfect Crime” from the Bill & Ted’s Bogus Journey soundtrack. Two more bonus tracks, “Cowboy Song” and “The Grade” (an instrumental) are also available on the album Live at the Brixton Academy. Both good songs; “The Grade” really shows off some very sweet Jim Martin steel guitar. “Cowboy Song” (nothing to do with Thin Lizzy) is good enough that it could have been a single: catchy, melodic and punchy.\n\nRemixes of “Epic” and “Falling to Pieces” are taken from an old two-song CD single, although this remix of “Falling to Pieces” is longer by 11 seconds compared to the single. They add a bit more echo and other effects as well as some edits. An extended remix of “From Out of Nowhere” lengthens the song by a minute, by adding more instrumental sections. Five live songs round out the B-sides and rarities, including two that were chopped from the CD release of Brixton Academy. (Speaking of which, that’s a deluxe edition we’d like to see.) “As the Worm Turns” is one of these Brixton tracks, an old essential Chuck Mosely song given the Patton treatment. Patton’s gurgling during “War Pigs” is a career highlight! Live BBC recordings of “Epic” and “Woodpecker From Mars” are missing from this deluxe edition, but available on an old 7″ single (“From Out of Nowhere”).\n\nThe Real Thing is an essential album. Its deluxe edition was long overdue, and fortunately most of Faith No More’s catalogue has been similarly beefed up. It is not perfect, but few deluxes are. There will always be more to collect. This deluxe however will scratch quite a few tracks off your lists.\n\n4.5/5 stars\n\n*I recall writing “What is it? It’s it.” on my English final exam for no particular reason.\n\nWe temporarily interrupt the Aerosmith series in order to bring you this…\n\nNEW RELEASE\n\nFAITH NO MORE – Sol Invictus (2015 Reclamation, Japanese import)\n\nWhen I worked at the Record Store, I used to tell the younger folks, “If you like bands such as Korn, System of a Down, or Incubus, then you need to check out Faith No More. They were doing what those bands did way back in the early 90’s.” I still maintain that to be true. Faith No More have been there, done that, and moved onto Sol Invictus, their first studio album in 18 years.\n\nEvery Faith No More album requires multiple listens to “get”, usually somewhere between three and a dozen listens. There is no shortcut to this. The only way to appreciate Faith No More is to give each record the time and focus that it deserves. Faith No More is not background music nor have they ever been. Scott from Heavy Metal Overload said in his Sol Invictus review, “…On initial spins it seemed like Faith No More were playing it too safe. The material and delivery seemed lazy and half-baked.” I had the same impression. The songs seemed too laid-back and passive at first. Then the album began to sink in, as I absorbed its shadowy intensity.\n\nAs a fan since 1990, I tried to keep my expectations reasonable in 2015. In my heart, I knew that if Faith No More were to live up to their past, the new album must meet the following criteria at minimum:\n\n1. The album had to continue to straddle many genres of music, as they always have — preferably within the same song. They have done this again, blending exotic moods and textures together into a contiguous whole. Diversity is not an issue.\n\n2. I needed Mike Patton to blow me away with his singing again. I know his voice has changed (as voices do!) but he is such a unique, innovative vocalist that I couldn’t settle for anything less than manic intense awesomeness. Once again, Patton has risen to the occasion. Utilizing gutteral grunts, Tom Waits’ low grumbles, and sandpaper screams, he uses his voice as an instrument. Just listen to that “Go! Go! Go! Go!” hook in “Superhero”. There is no better way to describe it than vocals as a bizarre instrument.\n\n3. A Faith No More album must be bracing, even if the songs are slower and quieter. I found 1997’s Album of the Year (the last album, and the only other one with guitarist Jon Hudson) to be tame by comparison to their prior work. Not Sol Invictus. Even on slower, more melodic tracks like the excellent “Sunny Side Up”, they bristle with tension. There’s an emotional intensity to every track.\n\n4. Faith No More have to sound like they mean it — and they do. I hate when a band reunites, but do not add anything to their legacy when they do it. Sol Invictus has a purpose; you can hear the blood sweat and tears in the songs.\n\n5. This one was a given. The musicianship had to be top notch. No worries there. In addition I feel like I’m “getting to know” guitarist Jon Hudson for the first time, due to his diverse work here. Heavy Metal Overload also laid kudos at the feet of keyboardist Roddy Bottum, and he does deserve credit for creating the textures and atmosphere.\n\nI have to admit I was worried about this album. I didn’t care for the first two singles, “Superhero” and “Motherfucker”. Because of this, I purposely did not play them again, until the album came out. I know that Faith No More are not the kind of band you can always appreciate from a single. I was concerned that the first two singles didn’t leave an impression, but I knew that the context of a full album would do them good, and I was right.\n\nMy favourite track of the album cuts is “Rise of the Fall”. This singular song combines elements from all eras of Faith No More into one. At times it sounds like a Mosely-era track from Introduce Yourself. At others, one of the more humid and tropical moments on King For A Day. Then a track like “Matador” reminds me of how “Zombie Eaters” from The Real Thing builds, and builds, and builds. It stands out to me for those reasons, but it is impossible for me to ignore any of these songs. Each one has a personality of its own, and there are none I haven’t grown to like. I look forward to listening to Sol Invictus this summer, and allowing the songs to unfold on their own, and reveal their colours.\n\nThe Japanese version of this CD has a fantastic bonus track — a remix called “Superhero Battaglia”. Because I normally dislike remixes, you can trust me when I say this is a good’un. The song is intensified and made more exotic. I like it better than the original. “Superhero Battaglia” was originally the B-side to “Superhero”, logically enough. This leaves one B-side, a J.G. Thirwell remix of “Motherfucker”, still on my “want” list. (It was the B-side to the Record Store Day single for “Motherfucker”.)\n\nSol Invictus is the first contender for album of the year. (Pun intended.)\n\n4.5/5 stars"
