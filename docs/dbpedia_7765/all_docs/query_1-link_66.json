        "text": "Having only been in the Michigan music scene for a little over a year, March Skies continues to hone their craft of hard rock. Mixing driving and ambient music with a wide range of vocal stylings that make you want to sing along.\n\nIn the last year, they have been able to play with touring bands and locals alike primarily in the Saginaw and Detroit area.\n\nThe band's new music was recorded at WesMix in Chesterfield with long-time producer Kevin Williams. To date, this is the 3rd release from March Skies as a follow-up to last year's \"The Flame” and “Perfect Prison.” All three songs are available now on streaming platforms and have accompanying videos.\n\nMarch Skies will be performing live at The Machine Shop on Friday, July 14. The band will be opening for Los Angeles, California's Liliac. Also, performing that night will be Elsie Binx.\n\nThis will be March Skies' first Flint show in nearly a year and their first at The Machine Shop.\n\nTickets to Liliac, Elsie Binx, and March Skies are only $17 and are available, here.\n\nIn the meantime check out the new video for their song ‘BREATHE.’"
