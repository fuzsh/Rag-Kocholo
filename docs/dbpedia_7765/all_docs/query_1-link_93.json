Their upcoming season of virtual workshops offered us an opportunity to discuss the way they teach, but more specifically the rituals in which they create. The realms explored range from electronic poetry arts, to hoarders and the tricky relationship between people and things, traumas, healing and the sacred EARTH.\n\nEPISODE 4: R.B. Schlather & Roddy Bottum\n\n“The Future of Opera: Sasquatch, Rip Van Winkle and Chosen Families”\n\nConversation about the intersections of the underground world of art and the old world of opera between Opera Director / Artist R.B. Schlather and Musician Roddy Bottum. Opera was created 100s of years ago as an artistic experiment of the European elite, but after speaking to RB and Roddy we find ourselves wondering if it could stand to benefit from being reclaimed by local communities and the underworld. From DIY dioramas and pen pal projects, to mutual understanding about queer solitude, we may wonder what world would not benefit from such creativity?\n\nIn honor of Pride Month and our commitment to artistic subcultures, we celebrate these two independent and innovative artists on this Basilica Conversation Podcast.\n\nEPISODE 3: Elise McMahon of LikeMindedObjects\n\n“Cross Industry Solution Hunting, Wastestream Research, & Regional Manufacturing!”\n\nLearn about the underworld of FAST FASHION and it’s connection to West Africa, about RESOURCEFUL DESIGN and a new design headquarters in Hudson that aims to inspire the “spinning of gears” to deconstruct the design, materials and previous lives of objects on display.\n\nLMO creates furniture, accessories and custom interiors in a contemporary joyful aesthetic with a resourceful design eye looking to local materials and technologies that respect communities and environment\n\nEPISODE 2: Jon Bowermaster, Susannah Bradley & Rebecca Wolff\n\nHow do we break out of echo chambers? How do we mobilize both individual action and systemic change, and what role can the arts play in climate action?\n\nThis episode of the Basilica Conversation Series Podcast features oceans expert, journalist, author, and filmmaker Jon Bowermaster; SunCommon’s Regional Director of Marketing Susannah Bradley; and writer, publisher and City of Hudson Alderperson Rebecca Wolff as they tackle these questions and more.\n\nEPISODE 1: Rebecca Foon & Jesse Paris Smith of Pathway to Paris/1000 Cities\n\nBecky Foon and Jesse Paris Smith are both musicians, activists, and co-founders of Pathway to Paris, a non-profit organization dedicated to turning the Paris Agreement into reality. They bring together musicians, artists, activists, academics, mayors and innovators, to raise consciousness surrounding the urgency of climate.\n\nBecky Foon also is a member of the Basilica Hudson Board of Directors, and based in Montreal. Jesse Smith is based in NYC.\n\nBasilica x H0l0 Podcast\n\nPLACE OF ASSEMBLY: The Art Emergence in Upstate New York\n\nW/ Co-Host Sam Hillmer of H0l0 & Melissa Auf der Maur of Basilica Hudson\n\nWe were thrilled to partner with H0L0 and Experimental Sound Studio Chicago on their Place of Assembly Podcast last spring. Place of Assembly is a podcast that looks at the role of physical space in cultural production and in the lives of artists and creative communities of practice. Together we produced a 4 part series titled “The Art Emergence in Upstate New York” to explore in depth three established arts organizations founded a decade or more ago in the Hudson Valley: Basilica Hudson, WGXC/WaveFarm and PS21 Chatham. Then by comparison, in the fourth episode we met three emerging arts organizations— The Tenth Magazine, Hudson Eye, and The Hudson Art Fair— taking root in the dynamic City of Hudson, NY, where the city itself is the Place of Assembly.\n\nPlace of Assembly is produced by H0L0.NYC in partnership with Experimental Sound Studio Chicago and 8 Ball Radio.\n\n➕➕➕\n\nThe Art Emergence in Upstate NY created in partnership with Basilica Hudson\n\nTHE ART EMERGENCE IN UPSTATE NY PT. 1 – W/ COHOST MELISSA AUF DER MAUR\n\nTHE ART EMERGENCE IN UPSTATE NY PT. 3 – W/ COHOST MELISSA AUF DER MAUR\n\nTHE ART EMERGENCE IN UPSTATE NY PT. 4 – W/ COHOST MELISSA AUF DER MAUR"
