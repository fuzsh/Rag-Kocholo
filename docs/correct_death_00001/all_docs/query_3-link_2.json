        "text": "Michael Jackson is dead and buried — but the home he died in is still very much available.\n\nThe Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, house where the pop singer died in 2009 has been placed back on the market — and for a mere $23.9 million it could be yours.\n\nYes, that's a lot of dough — but consider the amenities that the three-story, 17,000 square foot home offers. Described by the real-estate agency that's selling it as an \"elegant and sophisticated French Chateau estate,\" the house boasts seven bedrooms, 13 baths, a movie theater, wine cellar, tasting room, gym, an elevator and 12 working fireplaces.\n\nThe latter of which will surely be useful, because the property also includes a whole lot of chilling memories.\n\nThe home, which was listed in 2010 with a sale price of $23.5 million, sits on a \"lush and mature landscape\" of approximately 1.26 acres.\n\nJackson died at the home at the age of 50 on June 25, 2009, of acute propofol intoxication. Jackson's personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter last year for providing the drug to the pop singer. The house was leased for Jackson by concert promoter AEG Live as he prepared for his string of comeback concerts at London's O2 Arena."
