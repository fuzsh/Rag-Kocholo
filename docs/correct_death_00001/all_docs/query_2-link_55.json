        "text": "The King of Pop was about to launch a comeback tour that would put him firmly back on top of the music world.\n\nBut then, on June 25, 2009, the world was rocked by the news that Michael Jackson was dead.\n\nThe troubled star had died from an overdose less than three weeks before his first show on the This Is It tour was due to start at the O2 in London.\n\nJackson was just 50 years old.\n\nJust 24 hours earlier the former child star had been busy preparing for his tour.\n\nThose who spent the day with him have said he never looked better.\n\nHis long-time choreographer, Travis Payne, had spent the afternoon of June 24 working with Jackson.\n\nAs usual, rehearsals started between noon and 1pm.\n\nIt was the first time Jacko and his team had run through the whole show top to bottom.\n\nDorian Holley, Jackson's vocal director, told CNN : \"He was sharp, there was no indication there was something wrong.\"\n\nJackson's musical director, Michael Bearden, was also with the star at his final rehearsal.\n\nHe said: \"You could see his confidence growing and you could see that physically he was able to do all the things that he wanted to do.\"\n\nAfter training for almost 12 hours, Jackson left the Staples Centre where he had been working with his team at around midnight.\n\nHeartbreakingly, as he walked out he gave Dorian a hug and said \"I love you Mike\".\n\nIt was the Thriller hitmaker's final goodbye to the team who had been with him for so long.\n\nJackson had suffered from chronic insomnia for years.\n\nLong-time confident J Randy Taraborrelli said: \"I used to say - and I still believe - that Michael would have paid a million dollars for a good night's sleep.\"\n\nHe was so dependant on medication that he struggled to sleep without the use of sedatives.\n\nBack at home Jackson's live in doctor, Dr Conrad Murray, was about to make a series of fatal decisions that would end with the superstar's death.\n\nDr Murray, who was paid $150,000 a month, started trying to get the singer, who was repeatedly said \"I must be ready for England\" to sleep.\n\nFirst he gave some Valium at 1.30am but by 2am, with Jackson still unable to sleep, the doctor injected him with the anti anxiety drug, Ativan.\n\nIt was administered via a drip in Jackson's bedroom, which, when police arrived, was littered with bottles of pills, vials, syringes, oxygen tanks and drips.\n\nAt 3am Jackson was still wide awake and Dr Murray gave him a second sedative, Versed.\n\nThroughout the night, the Bad singer was given another two more doses of Ativan and two of Versed - but nothing was working and he couldn't sleep.\n\nDr Murray has always claimed it was Jackson himself who asked to be given propofol, the drug that killed him.\n\nPropofol is given to patients in hospital before and during surgery and Dr Murray admitted he had given the star doses of the powerful drug for 60 nights running up to June 22.\n\nHe claimed he was trying to wean Jackson off propofol but he insists the increasingly desperate star had begged him for one more dose.\n\nHaving been awake all night, Jackson was given the propofol, which he dubbed \"milk\", at 10:40am on June 25.\n\nDr Murray has always said that he had to necessary equipment to monitor the star, including heart monitors and machines to check his oxygen levels.\n\nTen ministered after he had administered the dose by drip, Dr Murray says he went to the toilet, leaving Jackson alone.\n\nBut when he got back his patient wasn't breathing.\n\nHowever, police phone records have cast doubt on Dr Murray's timeline and suggest it was closer to midday before he noticed something was wrong.\n\nDr Murray says he immediately started resucitation attempts on the star and administered CPR.\n\nThe doctor has claimed the reason he didn't call emergency services immediately was because he was too busy trying to save Jackson's life.\n\nFinally he shouted for Alberto Alvarez, one of the singer's security guards, to come into the bedroom and clear away vials, bottles and drips before dialling 911.\n\nThat call wasn't made until 12.21pm -almost two hours after the fatal dose had been administered.\n\nBy now, the rest of Jackson's house had realised something was terribly wrong and the panic had started to spread.\n\nTragically, his two eldest children, Prince and Paris, were caught up in this and were absolutely distraught that their father was fighting for his life.\n\nThe first paramedics at the scene were stunned by the scene before them.\n\nThey didn't immediately recognise Jackson and Richard Senneff, one of the emergency responders, initially thought he had been called to an emergency involving a terminally ill patient.\n\nJackson was pale, underweight ad surrounded by a drip and vials of medication.\n\nHe was rushed by ambulance to the UCLA medical centre where medics desperately tried to save his life.\n\nBut an hour and 13 minutes after he had arrived at the hospital, Jackson was declared dead.\n\nNews of his death broke at 2.44pm in the US - 10.44pm in the UK.\n\nFans across the world were distraught ther idol was dead.\n\nDr Conrad Murray, Jackson's personal physician, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in 2011.\n\nHe was jailed for four years but served less than half of his sentence."
