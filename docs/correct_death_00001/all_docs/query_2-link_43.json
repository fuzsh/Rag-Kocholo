        "text": "LOS ANGELES — Michael Jackson was more than $500 million in debt in 2009 when he died ahead of a planned concert tour, according to new court documents.\n\nThe deep financial hole the “King of Pop” found himself in was detailed in a petition the executors of his estate filed Friday in Los Angeles County Superior Court.\n\n“At the time of Michael Jackson’s death, Michael Jackson’s most significant assets were subject to more than $500 million of debt and creditors’ claims, with some of the debt accruing interest at extremely high interest rates, and some debt in default,” the filing said.\n\nBefore he died on June 25, 2009, Jackson was preparing to launch a concert tour called This Is It.\n\nThe tour had been planned as a colossal 50-show engagement at London’s O2 Arena.\n\nHe died close to the eve of the tour, which left his estate financially liable for $40 million to the tour promoter, AEG, the filing said.\n\nThe filing requests that money from Jackson's estate be used to reimburse the executors’ attorneys for legal services and other expenses in 2018.\n\nJackson was also facing lawsuits in several states and countries when he died, the petition said. More than 65 creditors’ claims had been filed, which prompted more lawsuits, the filing said.\n\nThe executors, however, have settled or disposed of most of the creditors’ claims and litigation, the filing said.\n\nJackson died at his Los Angelesmansion at age 50 of acute propofol intoxication. His physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in 2011 for providing the drug."
