        "text": "It sounds as if Michael Balderrama may never forget working with — and simply being in the presence of — the late Michael Jackson.\n\n“It was a small slice of time, but you are impacted for your entire life to have worked with him,” says Balderrama in a recent phone interview. “Even now, I’m thinking about it, like, the hair on my arm is standing on end.”\n\nThese days, Balderrama is connected to the King of Pop as the associate global choreographer for “MJ,” the Tony Award-winning jukebox musical built on a foundation of Jackson hits that on July 16 will begin a run of 32 performances in the KeyBank State Theatre at Playhouse Square in Cleveland.\n\nThe initial brush with Jackson’s brilliance came in 1996, shortly after Balderrama had moved to Los Angeles, where he quickly booked a gig as a dancer for Vanessa Williams’ performance of “Colors of the Wind” at the 68th Academy Awards.\n\nHis good fortune continued when Travis Payne and LaVelle Smith Jr. — choreographers known for working with Jackson — suddenly found themselves in need of a “tall dancer” when one of their regulars became unavailable for a project.\n\n“I went over to their apartment,” he says, “danced in their studio, interviewed with them for a couple of hours and then booked it.”\n\n“It” was the roughly 40-minute mini-movie “Michael Jackson’s Ghosts,” which counts famed horror novelist Stephen King among its story contributors.\n\n“It was supposed to be about 20 minutes, and, in very-Michael Jackson fashion, he went completely over budget,” Balderrama says.\n\nAlthough the project used about 20 dancers, as fate would have it, Balderrama says, he found himself working closely with Smith, Payne fellow dancer Cris Judd — who next would go on to dance with Jackson on the HIStory World Tour — and Jackson frequently when other people involved with the shoot were not present.\n\n“I was the fly on the wall,” he says. “Cris Judd, LaVelle and Travis — they had all been with him for years, so he felt like he was amongst friends. And it was such a unique and special experience because he was laughing. … He was literally just hanging out with friends, and I got to sort of participate vicariously through them.”\n\nJackson would “close himself off” with more people around, Balderrama says. At the same time, though, he describes Jackson as “a general leading his army” during the filming.\n\n“He had a clear vision. He had clear communication. He was completely comfortable taking the lead with hundreds of people he’d never met.”\n\n“MJ” debuted on Broadway in late 2021, more than a decade after Jackson’s death. Featuring actors playing multiple versions of Jackson, including lead character MJ, the Christopher Wheeldon-directed and -choreographed and Lynn Nottage-penned show is built around the making of the 1992 “Dangerous” World Tour.\n\nComing from a very musical family, Jackson first became known as a child singing with The Jackson 5. As an adult, he made several hugely successful records, giving the world songs such as “Beat It,” “Thriller,” “Bad,” “Man in the Mirror,” “Black and White” and “Billie Jean,” all of which are found in “MJ.”\n\n‘MJ’ bringing Baldwin Wallace grad Jahir L. Hipps back to Cleveland\n\nOf course, Jackson’s legacy is complicated by multiple allegations of child sex abuse, first made in 1993.\n\nStill, the world was ready for “MJ,” which, while earning mixed reviews, has been a hit — along with this national tour, it has spawned productions in Europe and beyond — and was nominated for scads of Tonys, winning in four categories, including Best Choreography.\n\n“It reminds us of not only the incredible talent and the incredible gift of music that he gave the world but (also) the world he had to navigate in order to make that happen,” Balderrama says.\n\nHe adds later in the conversation, “I think the show hits the mark where it celebrates his work and reminds us of the incredible talent, his incredible creativity, his uniqueness, while at the same time it’s not just a love letter. You know, we’re speaking about a human and an artist that struggled with difficulties.”\n\nBased in the New York City area — “across the river in Jersey” — Balderrama was involved in the development of the show and now, as associate global choreographer, is one of the people responsible for keeping the various productions in fine form.\n\n“I’m the keeper of the keys in the choreography realm,” he says. “With a long-running show, when you get a new company up, there are some small adjustments. There are some creative changes. There’s always an ability to tinker.”\n\nThat said, he and his counterparts responsible for maintaining other aspects of the show know to take things only so far.\n\n“You collaborate together to make sure it’s its own version but (possesses) the true artistic nature of the original,” he says.\n\nWhile Jackson is known perhaps as much for his dancing as his music, Balderrama says the show boasts a blend of dance styles. While we may anticipate seeing the Moonwalk, we also should expect ballet thanks to Wheeldon’s background.\n\n“He is a world-renowned ballet choreographer, and his ballets are done by every company around the world,” Balderrama says. “He’s often creating new ones, and they’re brilliant — they’re beautiful.”\n\nWheeldon’s previous state musical, Balderrama notes, was the ballet-heavy “An American in Paris,” so “MJ” reflects him going out of his comfort zone, at least to a significant degree. Plus, he says, Wheeldon infused the show with myriad other dance influences.\n\n“And then what ended up happening is it all got soaked together,” he says. “(The show) actually really discovers a new version of (Jackson) that is perfect for the stage, that is perfect for musical theater.”\n\nGiven that, this is a demanding piece for those portraying various versions of Michael, especially considering their marching orders are to be able to sing and dance like him and capture his essence while avoiding falling into a strict impersonation.\n\nIt’s a serious commitment, Balderrama says.\n\n“Everyone who is up there is capable, and it speaks volumes (about) the show, as well, because the show supports the actual story — it’s not (dependent) on a single performer. The show in and of itself is an experience everyone should have the pleasure of having.”\n\nSpeaking of experience, he continues to draw from his with Jackson, he says.\n\n“It definitely was a pivotal point in my career,” Balderrama says. “I think underlying it was, ‘Just do the work. Just be the best version of the work, and the rest will take care of itself.’ And I still live by that mantra to this day.”\n\n‘MJ’\n\nWhere: Playhouse Square’s KeyBank State Theatre, 1519 Euclid Ave., Cleveland.\n\nWhen: July 16 through Aug. 11.\n\nTickets: $39 to $189.\n\nInfo: PlayhouseSquare.org or 216-241-6000."
