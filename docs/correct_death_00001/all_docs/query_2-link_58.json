        "text": "Propofol, according to Conrad, was nicknamed ‘milk’ by the singer, and so many reports suggested his final words were pleading for milk.\n\nTo be exact, Conrad said the singer asked, as reported by the LA Times: “I’d like to have some milk. Please, please give me some milk so that I can sleep, because I know that this is all that really works for me.”\n\nPropofol is an anaesthetic, nicknamed as such because of its opaque, milky appearance.\n\nAccording to the statement, Conrad was concerned by this, due to Michael’s busy rehearsal schedule.\n\nIn 2011, the jury found Conrad guilty and he was sentenced to four years in prison but was released after two years on October 28, 2013, for good behaviour.\n\nDuring the trial, his licence to practise medicine and administer heavy sedatives was revoked and has remained so to this day.\n\nHis former wife, Lisa Marie Presley, opened up on what Michael’s final words were to her, which showed his fragile mental state at the time.\n\nSpeaking to Oprah Winfrey the year after Michael’s death, she said: \"It was a very long conversation. I was so removed and he could hear it and feel it…\n\n\"He was checking to get a read, throw a line out to see if I would bite."
