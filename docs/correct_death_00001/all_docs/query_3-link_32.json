        "text": "LOS ANGELES -- Michael Jackson, the sensationally gifted \"King of Pop\" who emerged from childhood superstardom to become the entertainment world's most influential singer and dancer before his life and career deteriorated in a freakish series of scandals, died Thursday, a person with knowledge of the situation told The Associated Press. He was 50.\n\nThe person said Jackson died in a Los Angeles hospital. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and requested anonymity.\n\nThe circumstances of his death were not immediately clear. Jackson was not breathing when Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics responded to a call at his Los Angeles home about 12:30 p.m., Capt. Steve Ruda told the Los Angeles Times. The paramedics performed CPR and took him to UCLA Medical Center, Ruda told the newspaper.\n\nJackson spent time at a Pahrump home last summer. He was rumored to be planning a show in Las Vegas but rumors were dispelled when Jackson announced his London tour in March.\n\nJackson spent time in Las Vegas before his 2003 arrest on multiple counts of child molestation. After an overnight stay at Green Valley Ranch in Henderson, Jackson left Las Vegas to surrender to police in Santa Barbara, Calif., on an arrest warrant. He had been seen numerous times in Las Vegas the week before.\n\nPalms owner George Maloof said Thursday afternoon he was saddened to learn of Jackson's death.\n\n\"I feel very privileged to have known Michael Jackson and I am saddened by the loss of such a phenomenal talent,\" he said. \"I truly admire his professionalism and contribution to the entertainment industry\".\n\nWynn Resorts executive Steve Wynn echoed those sentiments: \"Michael was a wonderful Dad and I feel very sad for the children.‚Äù\n\nThe singer's father, Joe Jackson, was in Las Vegas when contacted Thursday afternoon by the E! Online celebrity news site.\n\nJackson's death brought a tragic end to a long, bizarre, sometimes farcical decline from his peak in the 1980s, when he was popular music's premier all-around performer, a uniter of black and white music who shattered the race barrier on MTV, dominated the charts and dazzled even more on stage.\n\nHis 1982 album \"Thriller\" - which included the blockbuster hits \"Beat It,\" \"Billie Jean\" and \"Thriller\" - remains the biggest-selling album of all time, with more than 26 million copies.\n\nHe was perhaps the most exciting performer of his generation, known for his feverish, crotch-grabbing dance moves and his high-pitched voice punctuated with squeals and titters.\n\nHis single sequined glove, tight, military-style jacket and aviator sunglasses were trademarks second only to his ever-changing, surgically altered appearance.\n\nAs years went by, he became an increasingly freakish figure - a middle-aged man-child weirdly out of touch with grownup life. His skin became lighter and his nose narrower. He surrounded himself with children at his Neverland ranch, often wore a germ mask while traveling and kept a pet chimpanzee named Bubbles as one of his closest companions.\n\nIn 2005, he was cleared of charges he molested a 13-year-old cancer survivor at Neverland in 2003. He had been accused of plying the boy with alcohol and groping him. The case took a fearsome toll on his career and image, and he fell into serious financial trouble.\n\nJackson was preparing for what was to be his greatest comeback: He was scheduled for an unprecedented 50 shows at a London arena, with the first set for July 13. He was in rehearsals in Los Angeles for the concert, an extravaganza that was to capture the classic Jackson magic: showstopping dance moves, elaborate staging and throbbing dance beats.\n\nHundreds of people gathered outside the hospital as word of his death spread. The emergency entrance at the UCLA Medical Center, which is near Jackson's rented home, was roped off with police tape.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, Michael Jackson has just died,\" a woman boarding a Manhattan bus called out, shortly after the news was annunced. Immediately many riders reached for their cell phones.\n\nIn New York's Times Square, a low groan went up in the crowd when a screen flashed that Jackson had died, and people began relaying the news to friends by cell phone.\n\n\"No joke. King of Pop is no more. Wow,\" Michael Harris, 36, of New York City, read from a text message a friend sent to his telephone. \"It's like when Kennedy was assassinated. I will always remember being in Times Square when Michael Jackson died.\"\n\nSun reporters John Katsilometes and Amanda Finnegan contributed to this report."
