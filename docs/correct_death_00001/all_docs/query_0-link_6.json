        "meta_description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — After Michael Jackson's death on June 25, 2009, the gated mansion at 100 North Carolwood Drive where the pop star lived with his three children while preparing for his comeback concerts became part media camp, part Jackson tribute ground.\n\t\n\tHundreds of tearful fans left cards, flowers, balloons and handwritten notes in front of the three-story home resembling a French chateau, while dozens of reporters jumped at any development in the death investigation. Anyone coming in or out of the property was bombarded with questions.\n\t\n\tNow, as Dr. Conrad Murray sits in a jail cell awaiting sentencing for involuntary manslaughter in Jackson's death, the contents of the home — including the queen-size bed where Jackson took his last breath — sit neatly on display, just as they were, awaiting the auction block.\n\t\n\t\"We want to preserve the history of these items,\" said celebrity auctioneer Darren Julien, president of Julien's Auctions, which next month will sell the various antique furnishings, paintings and sculptures that surrounded the King of Pop in his final days.\n\t\n\tLocated on a leafy corner in the posh Holmby Hills neighborhood, the Carolwood home where Jackson lived from December 2008 until his death is separately up for sale. The house and its furnishings were leased to Jackson while he and his family lived there.\n\t\n\tA note from one of the children remains on a chalkboard inside the home's sprawling kitchen, where three barstools were lined up against the center island — a perfect breakfast spot for the kids. \"I (heart) Daddy. SMILE, it's for free,\" the chalk note reads in childlike scrawl. The chalkboard will be sold as-is, and is expected to fetch more than $400.\n\t\n\tAt the very moment on Monday that Murray was hearing his guilty verdict, reporters were eerily taking a private preview tour of the three-story home where the pop star lived and died.\n\t\n\tThe bedroom shown in evidence photos at Murray's criminal trial was actually considered a \"medication room\" by the Jackson team. Murray was convicted of supplying an insomnia-plagued Jackson with the powerful operating-room anesthetic propofol to help him sleep as he rehearsed for a series of comeback concerts in London.\n\t\n\tThe room looked perfect, like a hotel room awaiting its first guest. There was no sign that anyone had struggled there with insomnia or drug addiction, certainly no sign that anyone had died.\n\t\n\tJackson maintained an adjacent bedroom that he regarded as his inner sanctum — a private place only for him.\n\t\n\tIt is in this second bedroom that the pop star wrote a message to himself on the mirror of an antique armoire. \"TRAIN, perfection, March April. FULL OUT May,\" it reads. Jackson was to begin his London concert run in July.\n\t\n\t\n\t..
