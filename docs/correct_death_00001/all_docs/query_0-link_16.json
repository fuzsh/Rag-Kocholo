        "text": "Nearly 15 years since its release, it’s still wrenching to watch the documentary Michael Jackson’s This Is It — a glimpse of one of the greatest concerts that never happened.\n\nRevisiting behind-the-scenes footage of the planned residency at London’s O2 Arena, it’s clear Michael Jackson was at the top of his game. The Kenny Ortega-directed film takes us through rehearsals, dancer auditions, costume design, and more, as the run of 50 shows loomed.\n\nDespite any personal or medical issues the embattled King of Pop faced, he danced and sang terrifically. All 50 dates had sold out; after more than a decade off the road, This Is It was bound to be a momentous pop event.\n\nBut the residency would never happen, for the most tragic reason possible: on June 25, 2009, after returning home from a past-midnight rehearsal, Jackson passed away from acute propofol intoxication, administered by his personal physician, Conrad Murray. Jackson was 50.\n\nThe news rattled the world, causing major internet platforms including Google, AOL Instant Messenger, Twitter, and Wikipedia to be pushed to the breaking point with significant traffic spikes. The following year, Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter, and sentenced to four years in prison. (He was released after serving nearly two years, due in part to good behavior.)\n\n“Our beloved son, brother, uncle and father of three children has gone so unexpectedly, in such a tragic way and much too soon,” read a statement from the Jackson family. “It leaves us, his family, speechless and devastated to a point, where communication with the outside world seems almost impossible at times.”\n\nWhile the Spice Girls may have seemed like an overnight success in America, its members had been working their way through the British music scene for years. In March 1994, hundreds of aspiring stars crammed into Dancework Studios in London after an advertisement was posted in The Stage magazine looking for the next girl band.\n\nThe groups were randomly split up, taught a dance routine, and then had to perform the song for talent managers and father-son duo, Bob and Chris Herbert. One month later, with 10 girls left, the initial final four — Melanie \"Scary Spice\" Brown, Melanie \"Sporty Spice\" Chisholm, Victoria \"Posh Spice\" Adams, and Geri \"Ginger Spice\" Halliwell — were all chosen to form the final group with a then-17-year-old Michelle Stephenson. The group moved into a home together, where they received additional dance training and vocal coaching. However, Michelle was soon replaced by Emma \"Baby Spice\" Bunton, completing the lineup of Spice Girls that as we know them today.\n\n\"Of course I regret I'm not a multi-millionaire like them. But at the time I left the group I knew I was doing the right thing and I still think it was the right thing,\" Stephenson told The Mirror in 2001. \"It wasn't my kind of music and they were not living the lifestyle I wanted.\"\n\nRead More: The Evolution Of The Girl Group: How TLC, BLACKPINK, The Shirelles & More Have Elevated Female Expression\n\nThe group's charisma and corresponding archetypal personalities were put on display in the music video for \"Wannabe.\" The iconic, single-take music video shot in London’s Midland Grand Hotel (now St. Pancras Renaissance Hotel), became as legendary as the track itself. In 2015, Billboard included the video for \"Wannabe\" in a list of 10 iconic girl group videos, solidifying the video's lasting impression.\n\nDirected by Johan Camitz, the video was the perfect visual introduction to the group: Ginger Spice unapologetically dances through the hotel in a sparkly Union Jack leotard alongside Scary Spice, whose bold persona is conveyed through carefree dances that included whipping her hair around. The group's distinct, playful personalities remained a key selling point used throughout their career.\n\n\"Wannabe\" producers Matt Rowe and Stannard first saw the Spice Girls at a showcase, and the duo instantly knew that they had the next group of superstars. Soon after, Rowe and Stannard worked with the group to produce \"Wannabe,\" and the chemistry was undeniable.\n\nIn her 2002 book, Catch a Fire: The Autobiography, Brown recalls that the producer duo understood the group's vision and automatically knew how to blend \"the spirit of five loud girls into great pop music.\"\n\n\"Wannabe\" was an inescapable radio hit in the '90s — for all the right reasons. From the punchy beat and distinctive vocal inflections, to the shouts of \"if you wanna be my lover,\" the song remains as a persistent earworm.\n\nEven science backs that claim up. According to a 2014 study conducted by the University of Amsterdam and Manchester's Museum of Science and Industry, researchers found that study participants were able to identify and name \"Wannabe\" in an average of 2.29 seconds, making it the quickest recognized song in the study. This was ahead of Lou Bega’s \"Mambo No 5\" and Survivor’s \"Eye of The Tiger,\" and underscores \"Wannabe’s\" celebrated and timeless status.\n\nWhile the song itself is a lively, carefree summer anthem perfect for blasting in the car with the windows down, its lyrics resonate with a powerful message of female empowerment and friendship, standing tall above conventional romantic themes.\n\nRead more: 'Spiceworld' At 25: How The Spice Girls' Feminine Enthusiasm & Camp Became A Beacon For Queer Youth\n\n\"Girl Power embodies much more than a gender,\" Gerri Horner, formerly Halliwell, told BBC in 2017. \"It's about everybody. Everybody deserves the same treatment, whatever race you are, gender you are, age you are. Everybody deserves a voice.\"\n\nWith such a strong debut as \"Wannabe,\" it's clear why the Spice Girls weren't just a one-hit wonder. The British girl group went on to deliver dozens of other pop hits like \"Say You'll Be There\" and \"2 Become 1,\" which defined the late '90s and early '00s. Released months after \"Wannabe,\" Spice would spend 15 weeks at No. 1 on the Official Charts U.K. Album Chart and also topped the U.S. Billboard 200 chart. The album sold more than 23 million copies worldwide.\n\nEven after 28 years, the meaning of \"zig-a-zig-ah\" remains a mystery, but it's a small price to pay for the beloved dance-pop song we cherish today.\n\n\"It seems like everything I did in the first year that I came out with my first album is like a blur because everything happened so fast for me and I never had the chance to sit down and go 'Wow, this is actually happening,'\" Carey recalled in an interview with MTV. \"I just, like, went straight ahead.\"\n\nThe success of Mariah Carey was a mix of fate, talent and perseverance. In 1988, a teenage Carey left her family home in Long Island to pursue a music career. She brought with her a four-song demo tape made during her high school years with songwriter/producer Ben Marguiles (who also co-wrote Mariah Carey with several other writers). She continued to shape up the demo tape as she worked multiple jobs, and eventually crossed paths with Latin GRAMMY winner Brenda K. Starr.\n\nRead more: Songbook: How Mariah Carey Became The Songbird Supreme, From Her Unmistakable Range To Genre-Melding Prowess\n\nCarey found herself singing back-up vocals for the artist at live performances, and caught Starr's attention with her astonishing voice. Recognizing her exceptional talent, Starr played a pivotal role in launching Carey's career to new heights.\n\n\"I really didn't want to do it, but I said it's gotta be better than what I'm doing now,\" Carey confessed of the audition in Chris Nickson's book, Mariah Carey Revisited: Her Story. \"So I went to the audition, and Brenda was such a great person.\"\n\nEventually, Starr brought Carey along to an industry party, where she was able to get her demo tapes into the hands of Tommy Mottola, the then-president of Columbia Records. With stars in his eyes, Mottola listened to the tape and quickly signed Carey to the label.\n\nOf the many reviews of \"The Wiz\" over the years, one of the most famous comes from none other than Broadway legend Stephen Sondheim.\n\nWhen asked what his favorite Broadway show is (besides his own), Sondheim named \"The Wiz\" and said it’s because, \"it's the one show which makes you feel better when you come out of it than you did when you walked in.\"\n\nThe original production of \"The Wiz\" had its pre-Broadway tryout in 1974, with a Broadway premiere in January 1975. In the decades since, it's remained beloved among musical theatre fans, as well as a staple of community theatre. Not only does \"The Wiz\" boast a 50 year legacy and the distinction of being one of the first shows with an all-Black cast, but the musical itself stands the test of time because of the strength of the music and the message behind it. To accompany a tour and Broadway revival at the Marquis Theatre, the 2024 revival cast recording comes out on June 14, paving the yellow brick road for a new generation of fans to ease on down and enjoy the journey.\n\nWhile many people remember the 1978 Diana Ross film The Wiz (which also starred a young Michael Jackson), it was a critical and box office flop. The Broadway show, meanwhile, had more success. The show won seven Tony Awards including Best Musical. The original cast recording is the 30th highest selling cast album of all time. In 2017, the original Broadway cast recording of \"The Wiz\" was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.\"\n\nThe tale of Dorothoy's arrival in and travels through Oz has been in the cultural lexicon for over 100 years. \"The Wonderful Wizard of Oz\" was written in 1900 and, 39 years later, the Technicolor Judy Garland movie cemented the iconic story. While \"The Wiz\" (full title \"The Wiz: The Supersoul Musical ‘Wizard of Oz'\") is still primarily set in the magical land of Oz, the creators and production team made significant, conscious choices to place \"The Wiz\" among Black culture of the time. The new production, with an updated book by Amber Ruffin, strives to do the same.\n\nOf \"The Wiz,\" the Smithsonian — which displays costumes from the original production in their National Museum of African American History and Culture — says it is \"a tale that celebrates African American street style as a unique subculture and unapologetically American way of life. The song lyrics, script, sets, and costumes all reference and champion the struggles and triumphs of African Americans.\"\n\nAnalysis of the original cast album cites influences from popular music of the time, along with jargon. Most notably, however, and what Sondheim responded to, is that all the songs in \"The Wiz\" have a message and emotional core that moves the story forward both literally and within each characters’ arc. Instead of the repetitive \"Follow the Yellow Brick Road\" from the film, \"The Wiz’s\" \"Ease on Down the Road\" encourages the characters and then the audience to keep on keeping on with their goals. Lyrics such as \"Cause there may be times/ When you think you lost your mind/ And the steps you're takin'/ Leave you three, four steps behind/ But the road you're walking/ Might be long sometimes/ You just keep on truckin'/ And you'll just be fine, yeah,\" can be applied to anyone’s life problems — not just Dorothy and Company on their fantastical journey.\n\nAfter vanquishing the Wicked Witch, Evilene, the principals and ensemble sing, \"Everybody Rejoice/ Brand New Day,\" a celebratory song that exudes joy. They sing, \"We always knew that we'd be free somehow,\" which, when placed in American theatre and sung by an all Black ensemble, holds more historical significance than a simple song about escaping capture. Glinda appears and doesn’t just tell Dororthy to click her heels; she tells her to \"Believe in Yourself\" not only that she can go home, but that she should believe in her own feelings and power inside her heart.\n\nFinally, \"Home,\" which some say takes the place of the classic \"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\" speaks to a broader character arc and feels more like a pop anthem than a musical theatre song. It has been released as a single throughout the show’s history, including last year by Brandi Carlile to go with the \"Ted Lasso\" finale. While Garland’s Dorothy learns in the end, \"There’s no place like home,\" \"The Wiz’s\" Dorothy sings, \"And I've learned that we must look/ Inside our hearts to find/ A world full of love/ Like yours, like mine/ Like home.\"\n\nThe original Broadway cast recording is hard to find. It can be purchased on streaming services like Apple, but on Spotify, only the single version of \"Home\" is playable. \"The Wiz: Live!,\" a well-received televised version, does have a readily streamable soundtrack, but a new Broadway cast album is very welcome. The cast features Nichelle Lewis as Dorothy and television and Broadway veteran Wayne Brady as the titular role; the stage production updates both script and set to feel more more contemporary. Meanwhile, the score has been lightly \"refurbished\" with additional songs.\n\n\"The original ‘Wiz’ was a definitive product of the 1970s in its glam and excess,\" Brady told the New York Times. \"Ours is of this time: We have this place and can just be. From the queerness onstage to the costumes, the musicality, light and bricks. I think instead of fighting to be seen, this ‘Wiz’ is, ‘Oh, you see us.’\"\n\nSondheim’s praise of \"The Wiz\" is particularly magnanimous because Sondheim’s own show \"Gypsy\" had a revival in 1974, the same year as the original production of \"The Wiz,\" which meant the two shows battled it out both in box office and awards. A revival of \"Gypsy\" starring Audra McDonald and directed by George C. Wolfe has just been announced, so both \"The Wiz\" and \"Gypsy\" will again be on Broadway. This time, both shows will be led by Black actors and directors.\n\nBroadway has struggled post-pandemic, and America has a lot to learn about love when it comes to race, but, with the release of \"The Wiz\" back into the world, we get a much-needed infusion of joy. Throughout the last 50 years, there have been many stories and real events that point to a world that is anything but full of love, but, through it all, \"The Wiz\" holds onto hope.\n\nNew Broadway Musicals To See This Spring: \"Hell's Kitchen,\" \"The Wiz\" & More"
