        "text": "On Death And Immortality\n\n\"I don't want to die. I want to live forever.\"\n\nMichael Jackson, 2002\n\n\"Who wants mortality? Everybody wants immortality. You want what you create to live! Be it sculpting, painting, music, composition. That is why to escape death I attempt to bind my soul to my work because I just want it to live forever and just give all that I have.\"\n\nMichael Jackson\n\n\"Michael was one of those people that was always worried about someone having to take care of him. He didn't want to turn into someone who couldn't make it up the stairs or couldn't make it to the bathroom. But I don't think losing his life at an early age was part of his plan either. He never talked to me about dying, but most of us are a little in fear of dying.\"\n\nTito Jackson, brother\n\nMJ: I don´t want a long (life). I don´t like, I don´, I don´t. I think growing old is the ugliest, the most, the ugliest thing. When the body breaks down and you start to wrinkle, I think it´s so bad. I don´t , that´s something I don´t understand, Schmuley. And I never want to look in the mirror and see that. I don´t understand it. I really don´t. And people say that growing old is beautiful and this and that. I disagree. I totally do.\n\nSB: So do want to die before that happens?\n\nMJ: Um... I don´t want to grow old. I would like to get...\n\nSB: What if you could stay young in spirit, Michael?\n\nMJ: Yeah, that´s important to me.\n\nSB: You may have wrinkles, but don´t you want to see Prince and Paris grow up?\n\nMJ: Yes, I do.\n\nSB: Don´t you want to see their children?\n\nMJ: I just don’t want to look old and start forgetting. I want to always be youthful and have the energy to run around and play hide and seek, which is one of my favorite games. I wanted to play it so badly at your house the last time we were there ´cause you have a nice big house for it. Um, I hate to see people grow old, Schmuley.\n\nSB: Haven´t you seen people who grew old but kept their youthfulness? They behaved like they were still young?\n\nMJ: Yeah, when they have a youthfull heart, I love that. When they start to forget and wrinkle, (and) their body parts break down, it hurts me.\n\n(...)\n\nSB: Are you afraid of death?\n\nMJ: Yes.\n\nSB: We all are.\n\nMJ: I always said I want to be buried right where there are children. I want them next to me. I would feel safer that way. I want them next to me. I need their spirit protecting me. I always see that in my mind and I see myself and I hate to see it. I see myself and I see children laying there to protect me.\n\nMichael Jackson in conversation with Rabi Schmuley Botteach\n\n\"I don´t want to be burried. I want to live forever.\"\n\nMichael Jackson in \"Living with Michael Jackson\" when Martin Bashir asks him about sarcophagus\n\nFrank Cascio\n\n\"I will never be sad if I leave this world, because I know I will be in a better place. The only thing I care about is that people stop thinking that I did something wrong. I love the kids, and disgusting lies almost killed me. When I die, all [the] money I have will go to my children and other children of the world.\"\n\nMichael Jackson according to Frank Cascio\n\n\"I am sorry. He was an extremely sensitive human being...and the injustices ultimately killed him.\n\nI don’t think his heart and wisdom was enough to win the battle over the evil that pursued him throughout his life.\"\n\nKaren Faye@wingheartDec 20 2018\n\n\"That person, whom I considered (at the risk of ridicule) very pure, still survived — he was reading the poems of Rabindranath Tagore when we talked the last time, two weeks ago.\"\n\nDeepak Chopra about Michael shortly before his death - he read Tagore´s poems... :-)\n\nSource: www.beliefnet.com/columnists/intentchopra/2009/06/a-tribute-to-my-friend-michael.html\n\nEarth Song - the last song that Michael Jackson ever sang, June 24th 2009, a few hours before his death:\n\nMichael Bush said in an interview on ABC after Michael died that one day when he was fitting him for clothes for TII Michael said to him “you promised me you wouldn’t tell anyone” about how thin and frail he was\n\nAn excerpt from Prince Jackson's testimony at the AEG Live trial.\n\nTo never forget.\n\n'They're going to kill me,' Michael Jackson told son.\n\nMichael Jackson often cried after talking to AEG Live executives as he prepared for his comeback concerts, his oldest son testified.\n\n\"After he got off the phone, he would cry,\" Prince Jackson testified. \"He would say 'They're going to kill me, they're going to kill me.'\"\n\nHis father told him he was talking about AEG Live CEO Randy Phillips and his ex-manager, Dr. Tohme Tohme, Prince said.\n\n\"Sorry kids, your dad's dead\"\n\nPrince recounted the day his father died four years ago. He saw his father \"hanging halfway off the bed, his eyes were rolled back,\" when he ran into the bedroom where Dr. Murray was doing CPR in a futile effort to revive him, he said.\n\nParis followed him up the stairs, \"but we kept pulling her down the stair,\" he said.\n\n\"She was screaming the whole time saying she wants her daddy,\" he said.\n\nAt the hospital later, Dr. Murray told them \"Sorry kids, your dad's dead,\" Prince testified.\n\nPrince was 12 when the pop icon died, but he said his father confided in him about whom he trusted and didn't trust and what he feared as he prepared for his comeback concerts.\n\n\"I can't sleep at night,\" Prince said. \"I have a hard time sleeping.\" The death left him \"emotionally distant from a lot of people\" for a while, he said.\n\nHe's missed sharing with his father \"the first day of going to school, having the first girlfriend, being able to drive,\" Prince testified.\n\nPrince did speak about his sister.\n\n\"I think out of all of my siblings she was probably hit the hardest because she was my dad's princess,\" he said.\n\nWhile he and his sister no longer want to celebrate birthdays because \"it's not the same without\" their father, Blanket, now 11, does, Prince said.\n\n\"Right now, I don't know if Blanket realizes what he lost,\" he said. \"He was so young. He is still growing up just like I am and he doesn't have a father to guide him.\"\n\nSource: edition.cnn\n\n“When Michael died, the world came to a halt. News broadcasts were interrupted, traffic came to a standstill, and people left their homes and took to the streets as if pulled by some invisible force, or maybe just a desperate need for support and togetherness. They grabbed sheets of cardboard to craft signs of love or placed balloons and flowers at locations he had visited. Many lit candles in front of framed photos in their living rooms, and celebrities, world leaders, and ordinary people alike poured their hearts out…shock, disbelief, pain…Michael Jackson? Dead…gone forever. In all countries, on all continents, people mourned his passing. No matter race, creed, social status, ethnicity or origin, people were joined in the process of missing him. This is the impact Michael Jackson had on the world.\n\n[T.S. You were here and you are not. That’s it. It’s not making a difference.] And, in the end, I want to thank you. I want to thank you because through your actions, your callousness, and your hate, you have shown me exactly who I do not want to be.\n\nI choose kindness, forgiveness, serenity and compassion, and most of all, I choose love every single time. MICHAEL TAUGHT ME THAT.”\n\nSandra Sasvari\n\nPeople mourning Michael Jackson´s death all over the planet:\n\nThe day Michael Jackson died - June 25th 2009, social media Twitter, Wikipedia and AOL IM all collapsed at 3:15 pm exact. Twitter reported that 15% of tweets, which was 5000 per minute, mentioned Michael Jackson.\n\nAfter Michael Jackson died, his older brother Jermaine found handwritten poem to his mother.\n\nKatherine Jackson said she cried when she read the words.\n\n\"All my success has been based on the fact that I wanted to make Mother proud,\" the poem ends. \"To win her smile of approval.\"\n\nAnd she had it framed.\n\n\"When a mother loses a child... No one knows until it happens to them. That’s the worst thing that could happen to a person, losing a child.\"\n\n\"I lost my mother, my father and my sister … but when I lost Michael, I lost everything.\"\n\n\"Paris was particularly emotional. She was screaming, looking up at the sky and said, 'Daddy, I want to go with you.'\"\n\n\"When it came time to leave the hospital,\n\n'Grandma, where are we going?' I recalled Paris asking. \"And I said, 'You’re going home with Grandma.'\"\n\n\"My nephew and I and Paris and her brothers … went everywhere trying to find this special heart, and it was a broken heart..\"\n\n\"When she got it, she went to the morgue and she hung one heart around her father’s neck. Paris kept the other half\"\n\n<<<<ஜ۩۞۩ஜ>>>>\n\nThe clothes that Michael Jackson was laid to rest in:\n\nMichael Jackson was laid to rest at Forest Lawn cemetery in Glendale, California, inside an enormous structure called the Great Mausoleum.\n\nMichael Jackson´s Tomb:\n\n<<<<ஜ۩۞۩ஜ>>>>\n\n\"The image of my son as a little boy is the portrait that i have in my mind when i think of him.\n\nI think of my son all through the day, all the time, and I don't like to talk about him because I get all choked up.\n\nSometimes during the day, I can hear his laughter in my mind.\n\nThank you very much fans, we all love you. And if Michael was here, he would say, 'I love you more.'\"\n\nKatherine Jackson\n\n<<<<ஜ۩۞۩ஜ>>>>\n\n“His death teaches the world about condemnation and judgment. It proved our society's unnatural fear of anything that's different. He illuminated basic prejudices like gender and skin color. He exposed our need to topple those we once adored; our need to witness the brightest star, highest achiever, fall to the depths of what must have been a living hell. We imposed our perversions on the pure of heart – a modern day televised witch hunt. He seemed to be androgynous, from when he was a young male and female sides a mixture of both. Although he has an aggressive masculine delivery he could also flow and present ambiguity -definitely had that magic, which seemed to be a kind of naturalness a blessing for which to see the world through - and made his appeal so broad —In some cultures this otherness is celebrated, some forbidden -for an entertainer there are less rigid perceptions --For being raised a Jehovah's Witness ... and secular performer with a pluralistic POV it must have been challenging -The facts are: he was a supernatural phenomenon - and it's incalculable to realize how much joy that music, if you put together all those hours of people listening and dancing to it, has given the world.”\n\nDavid LaChapelle speaking with FLAUNT Magazine in September of 2009\n\n\"Michael Jackson had a probing mind, and many times we talked about life after death. Once we discussed Albert Einstein and his theory of relativity, which states that energy cannot be destroyed. My friend has died but he is a pure energy source now, and that will live forever. (...) Michael and I discussed life after death on several occasions and I know he believed that our souls are indestructible. Our energy lives after us.\"\n\nUri Geller\n\nAre You Listening?\n\nWho am I?\n\nWho are you?\n\nWhere did we come from?\n\nWhere are we going?\n\nWhat's it all about?\n\nDo you have the answers?\n\nImmortality's my game\n\nFrom Bliss I came\n\nIn Bliss I am sustained\n\nTo Bliss I return\n\nIf you don't know it now\n\nIt's a shame\n\nAre you listening?\n\nThis body of mine\n\nIs a flux of energy\n\nIn the river of time\n\nEons pass, ages come and go\n\nI appear and disappear\n\nPlaying hide-and-seek\n\nIn the twinkling of an eye\n\nI am the particle\n\nI am the wave\n\nWhirling at lightning speed\n\nI am the fluctuation\n\nThat takes the lead\n\nI am the Prince\n\nI am the Knave\n\nI am the doing\n\nThat is the deed\n\nI am the galaxy, the void of space\n\nIn the Milky Way\n\nI am the craze\n\nI am the thinker, the thinking, the thought\n\nI am the seeker, the seeking, the sought\n\nI am the dewdrop, the sunshine, the storm\n\nI am the phenomenon, the field, the form\n\nI am the desert, the ocean, the sky\n\nI am the Primeval Self\n\nIn you and I\n\nPure unbounded consciousness\n\nTruth, existence, Bliss am I\n\nIn infinite expressions I come and go\n\nPlaying hide-and-seek\n\nIn the twinkling of an eye\n\nBut immortality's my game\n\nEons pass\n\nDeep inside\n\nI remain\n\nEver the same\n\nFrom Bliss I came\n\nIn Bliss I am sustained\n\nJoin me in my dance\n\nPlease join me now\n\nIf you forget yourself\n\nYou'll never know how\n\nThis game is played\n\nIn the ocean bed of Eternity\n\nStop this agony of wishing\n\nPlay it out\n\nDon't think, don't hesitate\n\nCurving back within yourself\n\nJust create...just create\n\nImmortality's my game\n\nFrom Bliss I came\n\nIn Bliss I'm sustained\n\nTo Bliss I return\n\nIf you don't know it now\n\nIt's a shame\n\nAre you listening?\n\nMichael Jackson´s poem from his book \"Dancing The Dream\", 1992\n\n\"If you enter this world knowing you are loved and you leave this world knowing the same, then everything that happens in between can be dealt with.\"\n\n“That’s life.
