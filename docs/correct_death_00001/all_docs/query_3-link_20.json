The previous owners of the L.A.-area property were Hubert Guez, the C.E.O. of Ed Hardy, and his wife, Roxanne Guez, who purchased the estate in 2004 and listed it for $38 million in 2008 before agreeing to let a concert promoter rent the house for Jackson.\n\nPer The Wall Street Journal, the 17,000-square-foot, Richard Landry­–designed home features seven bedrooms, 13 bathrooms, 12 working fireplaces, a theater, a wine cellar, an elevator, and a spa with a gym. A guest house and pool round out the amenities on the 1.3-acre grounds. On June 25, 2009, Jackson died in his bed at the mansion after resuscitation efforts by his private physician, Conrad Murray, proved unsuccessful. Last year, Murray—who liberally prescribed sedatives to Jackson during his final years—was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter of the pop legend and sentenced to four years in prison.\n\nThe house is believed to have been purchased by Steven Mayer, a senior managing director of the private investment firm Cerberus Capital Management.\n\nRelated: Michael Jackson’s Burial Was Delayed Because Janet Wanted Her Burial-Plot Deposit Back\n\nHollywood\n\nShannen Doherty, Star of Charmed, Heathers, and Beverly Hills, 90210, Dies at 53\n\nThe ultimate ’90s bad girl had been fighting breast cancer since 2015.\n\nHollywood\n\nMichael J.
