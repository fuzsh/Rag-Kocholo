        "text": "LOS ANGELES – Los Angeles County coroner’s spokesman Craig Harvey said Friday determining the cause of Michael Jackson’s death will require further neuropathology and pulmonary tests that will take four to six weeks.\n\nHarvey says there were no signs of foul play or trauma to the body during Friday’s three-hour autopsy. He also says Jackson was taking some unspecified prescription medications.\n\nThe spokesman says Assistant Chief Coroner Ed Winter is with Jackson’s family.\n\nHarvey says the police department has requested a security hold on the investigation which limits how much the coroner’s office can say about the case. He says the death became a coroner’s case because there was no doctor to sign the death certificate.\n\nHarvey says the body will be released once the family selects a mortuary."
