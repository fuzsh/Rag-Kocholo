They began collaborating on the first two instrumental pieces, which were going to be recorded by an 80-piece orchestra in Los Angeles or London. Jackson and Frank first met 20 years earlier on a television special honoring Sammy Davis Jr., for which Frank received his first EMMY nomination.\"\n\nDavid Michael Frank, Composer\n\nFilm,Television,Cable, Arranger,Composer,Conductor\n\ndethorro\n\nProud Member\n\nJoined\n\nDec 30, 2018\n\nMessages\n\n1,362\n\nPoints\n\n113\n\nDec 31, 2023\n\n#12\n\nWhat's the source for the classical album info?

At least not in the way he initially told it. Michael was going to release albums, but the rollouts would be different.\n\nHe would focus on releasing a large number of singles before compiling them on an album later on.
