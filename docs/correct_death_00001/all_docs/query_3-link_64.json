        "text": "Michael Jackson's physician, Doctor Conrad Murray, has been found guilty of involuntary manslaughter by a jury in Los Angeles.\n\nDuring the trial they were shown images of the singer lying dead in a hospital and rehearsing the day before his death.\n\nThe prosecution team claimed Conrad Murray was an incompetent physician who used an anaesthetic called Propofol without the proper safeguards.\n\nThe defence said Jackson caused his own death by taking a drug overdose, including Propofol, after Murray left his bedroom on the day of his death.\n\nFind out what drugs were found in Michael Jackson's body.\n\nPropofol is a fast-acting hospital sedative, administered intravenously and used before anaesthetics. It was first used widely in the late 1980s.\n\nThe drug, which Conrad Murray gave to the singer to help him sleep, is made by the pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca and is also sold under the brand name Diprivan.\n\nExperts say Propofol is extremely powerful and not meant for use outside hospitals and clinics.\n\nPropofol was referred to by Michael Jackson as his \"milk\" because of the milk-like appearance.\n\nThe drug is administered either by intravenous drip or by being injected ahead of an anaesthetic, or to keep a patient anesthetized during an operation.\n\nIt is a preferred sedative in operating theatres because it is well tolerated and allows patients to recover quicker.\n\nIt's commonly used in outpatient surgery or as a sedative for certain examinations.\n\nPropofol is also used as a painkiller or anti-anxiety drug in post-operative care.\n\nConrad Murray told police in 2009 that he gave Michael Jackson other drugs known as benzodiazepines, which are also used as sleep aids.\n\nBut when they did not work, he claimed Jackson demanded Propofol.\n\nMurray's defence lawyer Ed Chernoff said the singer swallowed several pills of Lorazepam on the morning of his death, enough to put six people to sleep.\n\nIt is widely used as a sedative and muscle relaxant.\n\nAlso known as Ativan and Temesta, the drug is used short-term for insomnia, anxiety, seizures and for sedating aggressive patients.\n\nMidazolam is used in a similar way to Lorazepam.\n\nIt is widely used as a sedative and to treat seizures.\n\nAlso know as Dormicum, Hypnovel and Versed, the drug is also used short-term to treat severe insomnia and anxiety.\n\nJackson was given four milligrams of the drug on the morning of his death."
