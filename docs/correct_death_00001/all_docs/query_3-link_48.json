Putnam, who is defending AEG Live, says Jackson died because of his own bad choices, not because of anything the company did. Putnam says the company did not know anything about Jackson's use of propofol as a sleep aid and did not hire Dr. Conrad Murray to be his physician.\n\nAug. 2, 2013: Michael La Perruque, one of Jackson's former security workers, tells the jury he was concerned the singer would overdose on prescription medications in the early 2000s.\n\nJuly 11, 2013: Kenny Ortega, the director of Jackson's ill-fated comeback concerts, tells a jury he was frightened when Jackson was shivering and seemed lost at one of his final rehearsals for the This Is It shows.\n\nMay 22, 2013: A corporate lawyer for AEG Live says the company did not conduct any background checks or supervise Dr. Conrad Murray, who was later convicted of killing Jackson .\n\nMay 7, 2013: Jackson's doctor was not qualified to treat the singer for insomnia or drug addiction and botched resuscitation efforts, an expert cardiologist testifying for the singer's mother tells the jury.\n\nApril 29, 2013: Opening statements begin in a U.S. courtroom as lawyers for Jackson's mother, Katherine Jackson, attempt to convince a jury that the company promoting the pop superstar's 2009 comeback concerts, AEG Live, was responsible for his untimely death. AEG Live denies any wrongdoing and contests that it hired the physician who for months was giving Jackson doses of a powerful anesthetic in the singer's bedroom to help him sleep. The suit seeks $40 billion US in damages.\n\nApril 22, 2013: Eighteen months after Murray's involuntary manslaughter conviction, Jackson's doctor appeals his case, claiming there were multiple legal errors at his trial. His lawyer says there was insufficient proof that Jackson died of an overdose of the anesthetic propofol administered by Murray.\n\nMarch 25, 2013: Jackson's famed Moonwalk celebrates its 30th anniversary.\n\nFeb. 22, 2013: Cirque du Soleil announces it is combining the songs of Jackson and its own technology-enhanced theatrics for a second Las Vegas show centred on the King of Pop. It is scheduled to officially premiere June 29.\n\nDec. 3, 2012: Jackson costumes and memorabilia are auctioned in Los Angeles, bringing in more than $5 million US. According to auctioneer Darren Julien, sale highlights included $240,000 US paid for a jacket the King of Pop wore on his Bad tour, and two of the crystal-studded gloves favoured by Jackson (one hailing from his landmark 1983 performance at the Motown 25 show) that fetched more than $100,000 US each. The memorabilia came from the collection of costume designers Dennis Thompkins and Michael Bush, who worked with Jackson for years and to whom he gave many of his outfits.\n\nSept. 12, 2012: Jackson's former concert promoter, AEG Live, drops a $17.5-million US insurance claim over the concert tour that was cancelled due to the 2009 death of the pop superstar. AEG Live had sued London insurance company Lloyd’s, claiming it lost millions when Jackson failed to fulfill his contract for 50 \"This is It\" concerts. Lloyd’s had countersued, saying AEG made false claims about Jackson's health.\n\nAug. 22, 2012: A judge appoints Jackson's nephew, TJ Jackson, to share guardianship responsibilities for the late singer's three children. He shares the responsibilities with Michael Jackson's mother, Katherine, who had cared for the children since the singer's death.\n\nJuly 25, 2012: A judge removes Katherine Jackson as the guardian of Jackson's children because of a days-long absence from them. Her grandson Tito Joe \"TJ\" Jackson is named temporary caretaker of the three children amid a bitter family dispute over Michael Jackson's estate. A Los Angeles judge re-appointed Katherine Jackson as guardian on Aug. 2.\n\nJan. 26, 2012: Jackson's children Prince, Paris and Blanket help honour their father's memory by impressing hand and footprints outside Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Hollywood.\n\nDec. 17, 2011: The contents of the home where Jackson lived with his three children before his death in 2009 have sold for nearly $1 million at auction. The headboard from the bed where the pop star died at age 50 was removed from the sale at the family's request, but the rug that was beneath the bed sold for $15,360.\n\nNov. 29, 2011: Jackson's doctor, Dr. Conrad Murray, is sentenced to four years of incarceration for his involuntary manslaughter conviction. The doctor's sentence is automatically cut in half due to state laws, and sheriff's officials say Murray will serve a little less than two years, housed in a one-man cell and kept at a distance from other prisoners. Murray is also ordered to pay an $800 restitution fine, a $30 court security fee, and a $40 criminal conviction assessment.\n\nNov. 7, 2011: A jury in Los Angeles finds Jackson's doctor, Dr. Conrad Murray, guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the singer’s death. The trial had taken 23 days. Murray gave Jackson the surgical anesthetic propofol to help him sleep nearly every night for the last two months of his life, according to testimony.\n\n[IMAGEGALLERY galleryid=1415 size= small]\n\nOct. 26, 2011: For the second year in a row, Jackson tops the Forbes annual list of the Top-Earning Dead Celebrities.

The coroner reports that Jackson's death should be considered a homicide.\n\nJuly 7, 2009: Private family memorials are held for Jackson, as well as a public memorial at the Staples Center in Los Angeles that attracted hundreds of thousands. Jackson's closed casket was made of bronze and plated with gold. The service, featuring a host of celebrities, was broadcast around the world.\n\nJune 28, 2009: Katherine Jackson, 79, filed a petition in Los Angeles for guardianship of her son's three children: 12-year-old Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., known as Prince Michael, 11-year-old Paris Michael Katherine Jackson and seven-year-old Prince Michael Jackson II, who the late singer had once dubbed Blanket. She also files papers requesting to be appointed as the administrator of her son's estate, with her 80-year-old husband, Joe Jackson, joining in on the petition. The judge approves the guardianship, and later the right to take control of the singer's personal property.\n\nJune 25, 2009: Jackson is pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. in a Los Angeles hospital at age 50. Paramedics had responded to a call at Jackson's rented mansion in Holmby Hills about 12:30 p.m. PT, but Jackson was not breathing when they arrived. The Los Angeles County coroner rules that his death was caused by \"acute propofol intoxication\" in combination with two sedatives.\n\nJune 10, 2009: Allgood Entertainment files a breach of contract lawsuit against Jackson in a U.S. federal court in Manhattan.

After paying the overdue wages, the singer subsequently laid off the majority of the ranch's staff and largely closed down operations on the property.\n\nJune 13, 2005: A jury finds Jackson not guilty on all the counts against him. A member of the jury later says in an interview that he believes Jackson \"probably has molested boys,\" but there wasn't enough evidence to convict him.\n\nJune 3, 2005: The case against Jackson goes to the jury. In closing arguments, the prosecution tried to paint the picture of a serial child molester who plied children with alcohol at his sprawling Neverland Ranch home. Jackson’s lawyers argued he was the victim of an attempted extortion.\n\nMay 12, 2005: Actor Macaulay Culkin testifies on Jackson’s behalf and denies the pop singer ever abused him while he was a child star. Culkin, 24, made many visits to Jackson's Neverland estate in the early 1990s. Culkin told the trial he slept in Jackson’s bed several times but said it was simply because he fell asleep in the bedroom.\n\nMarch 10, 2005: The presiding judge issues an arrest warrant and threatens to revoke Jackson's $3 million US bail when Jackson fails to appear in court on time. The judge holds off an hour on executing the order as Jackson's lawyer tracks down his client. Jackson was in hospital with back problems. He arrives in court and the trial resumes.\n\nFebruary 28, 2005: The prosecution opens its case, accusing Jackson of being a closet pervert who used wine and pornography to lower the inhibitions of a 13-year-old boy.

The marriage lasts 18 months. 1993: Jackson is accused of molesting a 13-year-old boy.

The 'moonwalk' went on to become one of the most iconic dance moves of all time after that performance, turning Michael Jackson into a household name and forever cementing his title as the king of pop.\n\nNov. 30, 1982: Jackson releases Thriller, produced by Quincy Jones. More than 40 million copies are sold. The album contains chart-topping singles such as The Girl Is Mine, Billie Jean and Beat It.
