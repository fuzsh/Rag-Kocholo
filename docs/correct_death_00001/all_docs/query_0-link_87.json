        "text": "Firefighters are continuing an uphill battle in Santa Barbara County, where the Lake Fire swelled to over 20,000 acres over the weekend.\n\nThe blaze was first reported on Friday at around 3:45 p.m. near Zaca Lake and Saint Lucia Road, according to Cal Fire.\n\nBy Monday morning, the fire has consumed 20,320 acres and remains just 8% contained with more than 1,100 firefighters engaged in the firefight. On top of ground units, 10 helicopters and numerous other water-dropping aircraft are assisting with the ongoing suppression efforts.\n\nNot only are they dealing with exceedingly dry conditions, crews are also forced to work with the sweltering heat wave that has swathed most of Southern California in triple degree temperatures over the weekend.\n\nSo far one structure has been damaged and one injury has been reported, Cal Fire said. Among the homes threatened by the rapidly spreading flames is Michael Jackson's former residence, the famed Neverland Ranch, located in the 5000 block of Figueroa Mountain Road. He owned the 2,700-acre property from 1988 until his death in 2009.\n\nAn evacuation order was issued late Saturday evening for Figueroa Mountain Road to Sawmill Basin, including Tunnel Road and the Figueroa Campground.\n\nAdditionally, evacuation warnings have also been issued for Figueroa Mountain Road to Chamberlin Ranch and Zaca Lake Road, Foxen Canyon Road and the area south of the Sisquoc River, firefighters said.\n\nThe current status of ongoing evacuation orders and warnings can be found here.\n\nIt remains unclear what sparked the massive fire, which is now the second largest reported in California since the start of 2024."
