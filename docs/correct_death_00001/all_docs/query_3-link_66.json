        "text": "From polls, to statements and “where were you when you heard” reflections that include tributes, the one-year anniversary of the death of Michael Jackson has created another emotional outpouring regarding the loss of the “King of Pop.”\n\nSome radio stations woke up listeners to Jackson’s music; on U.S. television, all the major networks devoted a portion of their morning news programs to Jackson and more coverage was expected during prime-time hours. Events were planned across the globe, from Tokyo to New York.\n\nForest Lawn was to be just one of the many places where Jackson’s fans would gather to remember their hero, who died on June 25, 2009, at age 50 as he was preparing for a series of comeback concerts in London. Dr. Conrad Murray is charged with involuntary manslaughter in Jackson’s death for administering the powerful anesthetic propofol to Jackson to help the pop star sleep.\n\nBarricades were set up early at the Los Angeles-area cemetery for the throng of fans and Jackson family members expected to arrive later on Friday. Five large wreaths of flowers and dozens of bouquets, drawings and photos of Jackson had been placed outside his private mausoleum.\n\nOn Friday in Japan, hundreds of fans met at Tokyo Tower to honor Jackson with a candlelight vigil, a gospel concert and more. Some got a chance to see a collection of his possessions, including costumes from his tours and even a 1967 Rolls-Royce Phantom that he used to drive around Los Angeles.\n\nAbout 50 guests paid $1,100 each to sleep overnight at the Tokyo landmark, where they had catered food, watched a gospel choir, looked at Jackson memorabilia and danced to Michael Jackson’s music before observing a period of silence as the sun rose.\n\nIn Gary, Ind., Jackson’s hometown, there was to be a tribute at the family home; city officials said they expected Jackson’s mother, Katherine Jackson, and his niece, Genevieve Jackson, to show up, along with thousands of others.\n\nHis brother Randy Jackson was hoping to make the official family commemoration at Forest Lawn on Friday morning.\n\nAnd later in the afternoon in Harlem, around the hour of Jackson’s death, the Rev. Al Sharpton and his National Action Network were to hold a moment of silence.\n\nInformation from the Associated Press contributed to this report."
