As an ex-employee of Zalando its a personal satisfaction to partner with a Zalando company. But its not only the personal level that works well here. We are also focusing on very close API integration to increase on-boarding speed and really deliver the best optimization experience to our joined customers. Our collaboration centralizes pricing strategies into one easy-to-use hub, making international omni-channel operations more efficient. A great example is Tamaris (Wortmann Schuh-Holding), who saw a 5% reduction in discount rates and significant time savings thanks to our solution.

I believe it will become more and more important for #ai solutions to show that they do AI with less resource usage. This will save money and Co2 emissions. #AI #Sustainability #Microsoft #Energy #TechInnovation #ClimateChange #GreenTech #emissions\n\nToday is the last day of 7Learnings' first employee Mojca Bertoncelj!
