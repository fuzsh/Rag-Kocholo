        "text": "UNIT D STATES PATENT QFFICE.\n\nFELIX IIOFFMANN, OF ELBERFELD, GERMANY, ASSIGNOR TO THE FARIiEN- FABRIKEN OF ELBERFELD COMPANY, OF NEW YORK.\n\nACETYL SALICYLIC ACID.\n\nSPECIFICATION forming part of Letters Patent No. 644,077, dated February 27, 1900. Application filed August 1, 1898 Serial No. 687,385. (Specimens) T etZZ whom it may concern:\n\nBe it known that I, FELIX HOFFMANN, doctor of philosophy, chemist, (assignor to the FARBENFABRIKEN on ELBERFELD COMPAN r, of New York,) residing at Elberfeld, Germany, have invented a new and useful Improvement in the Manufacture or Production of Acetyl Salicylic Acid; and I hereby declare the following to be a clear and exact description of my invention.\n\nIn the Amzalcn der Chemie und Pha-rmacie, Vol. 150,-pages 11 and 12, Kraut has described that he obtained by the action of acetyl chlorid on salicylic acid a body which he thought to be acetyl salicylic acid. I have now found that on heating salicylic acid with acetic anhydride a body is obtained the properties of which are perfectlydiiferent from those of the body described by Kraut. According to my researches the body obtained by means of my new process is undoubtedly the real aeetyl salicylic acid ococn, o .H (J 4\\ coon.\n\nTherefore the compound described by Kraut cannot be the real acetyl salicylic acid, but isanothercompound. In thefollowinglpoint out specifically the principal differences between my new compound and the body described by Kraut.\n\nIf the Kraut product is boiled even for a long while with water, (according to Krauts statement,) acetic acid is not produced,while my new body when boiled with water is readily split up, acetic and salicylic acid being produced. The watery solution of the Kraut body shows the same behavior on the addition of a small quantity of ferric chlorid asa watery solution of salicylic acid when mixed with a small quantity of ferric chlorid-that is to say, it assumes a violet color. On the contrary, a watery solution of my new body when mixed with ferric chlorid does not assume a violet color. If a melted testportion of the Kraut body is allowed to cool, it begins to solidify (according to Krauts statement) at from 118 to 1l8.5 Centigrade, while a melted test portion of my product solidifies at about 70 centigrade. The melting-points of the two compounds cannot be compared, be-\n\ncause Kraut does not give the melting-point of his compound. It follows from these details that the two compounds are absolutely different.\n\nIn producing my new compound Ican proceed as follows, (without limiting myself to the particulars given:) A mixture prepared from fifty parts of salicylic acid and seventy- 6o five parts of acetic anhydride is heated for about two hours at about 150 centigrade in a vessel provided with a reflux condenser. Thus a clear liquid is obtained, from which on cooling a crystalline mass is separated, which is the acetyl salicylic acid. It is freed from the acetic anhydride by pressing and then recrystallized from dry chloroform. The acid is thus obtained in the shape of glittering white needles melting at about 135 cen- 7o tigrade, which are easily soluble in benzene, alcohol, glacial acetic acid, and chloroform, but difiicultly soluble in cold water. It has the formula H 6 coon and exhibits therapeutical properties.\n\nHaving now described my invention and in what manner the same is to be performed, what I claim as new, and desire to secure by Letters Patent, is-\n\nAs a new article of manufacture the acetyl salicylic acid having the formula:\n\ncoon being when crystallized from drychloroform 9c in the shape of white glittering needles, easily soluble in benzene, alcohol and glacial acetic acid, difficultly soluble in cold water, being split by hot water into acetic acid and salicylic acid, melting at about 135 centigrade, substantially as hereinbefore described.\n\nIn testimony whereof I have signed my name in the presence of two subscribing witnesses.\n\nFELIX HOFFMANN.\n\nlVitnesses:\n\nR. E. JAHN, OTTO Konre."
