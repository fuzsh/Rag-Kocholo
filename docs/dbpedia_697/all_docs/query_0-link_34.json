        "text": "Felix Hoffmann was a German chemist who, according to the Bayer website, in 1897, invented the first stable compound which would later be introduced as Aspirin. I will be eternally grateful for his efforts.\n\nYes, I went back to Jazzercise yesterday. Due to a long list of REASONS, (not to be confused with excuses) I haven’t exercised much lately. First there was the NASTY cold of late September and early October, followed closely by the sprained derriere incident of early November, then the holidays…I could go on, but what’s the point, really? Suffice to say, I am even more out of shape than is my custom.\n\nSince Sugar and I recently booked a trip to St. John to celebrate the milestone anniversary (let’s not get into which one, okay?) that we actually passed a couple years back when we were too over-committed to go on that first honeymoon we never took, very soon, I will have to put on a bathing suit.\n\nSo, yesterday, I drug myself on over to the dance floor and let The Queen of Pain start whipping me back into some semblance of shape. I nearly missed class because the UPS man was late getting here with our Korbel shipment, and I have to sign for that. Besides, I really didn’t want to leave champagne on the front porch. But, Brown showed up at the precise moment after which it would have been impossible for me to get to class on time.\n\nI was really worried this time that I wouldn’t be able to make it through a whole class. I told the QOP that I needed to stand in the back, but she would have none of it. “They don’t want to be running over you back there any more than we do,” she said. The woman has no empathy–none, I tell you. Later, it dawned on me that the reason she wanted me up front was that if she had to hop off the stage and perform CPR, she’d have less floor to cover.\n\nBy the Grace of the Good Lord, I make it through without a medical incident or fall, and I avoided throwing up on PPJ’s floor. Now I’m popping Aspirin and using the hand-held massager on my major muscle groups. I won’t be going to class today, as my body needs time to recover. But tomorrow I’ve got to haul myself back in there. Casey only has until March 19th to get me Caribbean-ready.\n\nPeace, out…\n\nSusan"
