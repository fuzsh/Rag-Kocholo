        "text": "You are warmly invited to the 24th Fototreff meeting on Friday, June 1, 2018, 7 pm.\n\nOn June 1st we will present the work of the artist Gábor Arion Kudász from Hungary at FOTOTREFF #24. Kudász published his book HUMAN in March 2018 and talks to Felix Hoffmann, the chief curator of the C/O Berlin about his publication. His work will also be presented at the Triennale der Photographie in Hamburg, and so we are particularly pleased that he is showing HUMAN for the first time in Germany in run-up to the Triennale.\n\nThe meeting will be held in English.\n\nGábor Arion Kudász\n\nKudasz’s work HUMAN fascinates with its photographic ambiguity. The large-format pictures of a former east European brick factory are connected to each other in many different ways. Stones join to form structures, workers set themselves in a sculptural scene and direct our gaze to the human measure in comparison to the stone harmony of the serially produced product. There are the outliers of the production as well as pictures of their bored and exhausted producers, which Kusdaz almost stoically stages. Political gestures of the workers, chalk drawings of the not yet realized living space and archaically staged last relics of the production show a long gone social form of physical production, which seems strange and almost surreal to us. HUMAN reflects the photographic process, and establishes a connection that literally allows us to experience the measure of things and their producers, and the measure of photography as a documenting and methaphoric medium at the same time.\n\nGábor Arion Kudász was born in Budapest in 1978. He graduated in Photography at the Hungarian University of Art and Design in 2003, where he later earned his doctorate degree with Human in 2016. He received several awards, among them the Robert Capa Grand-prize and Rudolf Balogh awards. His long-term series investigate the interplay between man and the environment through a wide array of subjects ranging from urban development, technology, private histories and the workings of memory. Although he considers his approach optimistic documentary in nature, he also incorporates staged or conceptual elements into his works. Since 2013 he is adjunct professor at Moholy-Nagy University of Art and Design. He is a father of three children, lives and works in Budapest.\n\nFelix Hoffmann\n\nFelix Hoffmann is an art historian and cultural scientist and has been Chief Curator of the C/O Berlin Foundation since 2005. He has worked at the Museum Folkwang / Essen, the Kupferstichkabinett / Dresden and the Fotomuseum / Munich as a scholarship holder of the Krupp Foundation. He co-curated numerous international exhibitions, including Nan Goldin (2009), Larry Clark (2012), Gordon Parks (2015), and themed exhibitions such as “unheimlich vertraut. Pictures of Terror” (2011) or “Kreuzberg-America” (2016). He has also published numerous texts and books.\n\nSHOW + TELL\n\nThe following works will be presented in the second part of the evening:\n\nAlexander Gehring\n\nSasha Kolosnjaj\n\nEva Gjaltema\n\n–\n\nWe invite you already now to submit your own works for FOTOTREFF SPEZIAL #2 on September 29th 2018 after the summer break. We want to put together a diverse programme for the European Month of Photography. As always, unfinished works in particular offer potential for discourse, and so we are very happy about pictures and series that are still in the process. Please contact us at: .\n\nFOTOTREFF BERLIN\n\nFOTOTREFF BERLIN is a photographers and editors meeting and open for everybody who is interested in contemporary photography. Our aim is to provide an open platform for critical discourse and exchange about photography, authorship, and the editing and presentation of personal projects. Fototreff invites established artists to present their work in an intimate setting, allowing unique insight into their artistic practices. In the second part of the evening pitched projects selected by our team will be discussed in an open conversation.\n\nPlease support us with a donation of 5/3 Euros.\n\nUnfortunately our studio capacities are limited. Please come early.\n\nFOTOTREFF BERLIN is initiated by Winifred Chiocchia, Tobias Laukemper, Anna Charlotte Schmid and Sarah Straßmann.\n\nSupported by:\n\nCollegium Hungaricum Berlin | PicDrop.de | rent one *photo support | Delight Rental Services\n\nMedia Partner: PiB – Photography in Berlin"
