        "text": "Bring up the topic of opioid painkillers, and you’re almost certain to hear an idea that goes like this: People believed, or were allegedly led to believe, that opioid painkillers pose less of an addiction risk than they actually do. What comes up less often is that, in the opioid field, this has happened before.\n\nNow that you’ve read my post from last week about opioids, let’s talk about heroin. It’s an opioid. It’s an addictive drug that can kill. But here's the thing. Heroin wasn’t always hated, or even feared. Here are five things to know about heroin’s chemical history.\n\n1. Heroin used to be a brand name.\n\nYou read that correctly. From 1898 to 1910, The German pharmaceutical company, Bayer, commercialized Heroin (note the capital “H”) as a cough suppressant and morphine substitute. The name likely comes from the German word “heroisch”, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. If you pop that word into a translator, you find that it means “heroic”, but that doesn’t convey the full meaning that you’d get if you read a German medical text. “Heroisch” conveyed a sense of something extremely powerful, highly active even at small doses. All this talk about the German language makes you think that’s where heroin was invented. Not so, however.\n\n2. Heroin was discovered in England, not Germany.\n\nEven though Germany led the way in commercializing heroin, an Englishman made the stuff first. The opium poppy and its effects were known to medicine for centuries. But it wasn’t until the mid-to-late 1800s that chemists developed enough know-how to make adjustments to the poppy’s main chemical component, morphine. In 1874, chemist C. R. Alder Wright boiled morphine with a compound called acetic anhydride, simply to see what would happen. Acetic anhydride is a fairly reactive molecule. Think of it as two copies of the molecule that’s in vinegar (acetic acid) mashed together. What Alder got was a stronger version of morphine, one with two additional little chemical groups that came from the acetic anhydride. This discovery didn’t lead to much, however. Alder’s collaborators conducted a couple of tests in animals, but that was about it. Alder was less interested in what the compound did and more in what it looked like. Back then, chemists didn’t know how all the atoms in morphine were connected to one another. This leads me to a point worth emphasizing, one that would be rather foreign to today’s drug industry.\n\n3. Scientists didn’t know heroin’s chemical structure when the drug was legally available.\n\nTake a close look at Wright’s 1874 paper- the first report of human-made heroin. Notice anything missing? A chemist would immediately notice that there are no structures in this paper.\n\nWright had ways of counting how many carbon atoms, hydrogen atoms, and oxygen atoms were in morphine, codeine, heroin, and all their derivatives. But as I said earlier, they didn’t know how to connect those atomic dots. In those days, chemists used reactions to make new things, but they also used reactions as tools to deduce a molecule’s structure. Every new product from a reaction was a new clue.\n\nIt wasn’t until 1925 that chemist Sir Robert Robinson would deduce the structure of morphine. By extension, once he did that, the structure of heroin was straightforward to figure out. The morphine structure was just one of many reasons that Robinson won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1947.\n\nFor today’s medicinal chemists, it would be positively wild not to know the structure of the drug you’re working on. Nowadays chemists have tools that allow them to determine a new molecule’s structure quickly, and chemical structures are the basis of many drug patents.\n\n4. Heroin and aspirin share some historical ties.\n\nSo we know that the English made heroin first. What was the story with Germany? According to the archives of the Bayer company, chemist Felix Hoffmann synthesized heroin in the summer of 1897. This was the same summer he synthesized aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid. Hoffmann wasn’t the first to make aspirin, either, but Bayer marketed both drugs and ended up with blockbusters on their hands. Hoffmann went about making aspirin and heroin in much the same way— by taking a molecule made in nature and adding a small chemical group, the acetyl group.\n\nIf the term “acetyl” sounds familiar, it’s because chemists can add acetyl groups with acetic anhydride— the same stuff I mentioned that Wright worked with back in England. Chemists had a few other ways of adding this group at the time, as well. The idea was that if you made slight modifications to a drug, you might make a stronger drug, or a less toxic drug. So in 1897, Hoffmann was adding acetyl groups to whatever he could get his hands on. When you have a hammer, everything looks like a nail.\n\n5. Heroin was marketed as a non-addictive alternative to morphine.\n\nAt first, heroin got an enthusiastic reception from the medical community. The very earliest studies didn’t observe adverse effects. And doctors in those days needed drugs like heroin to relieve coughs, because lung diseases like tuberculosis and pneumonia were commonly awful for patients to endure. It’s not like everyone in the profession was clueless for decades, though. As early as 1899, a handful of doctors started sounding the alarm that heroin might be dangerous and addictive."
