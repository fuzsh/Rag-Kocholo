Proventia Solutions, a Finnish technology and professional services company specialised in corporate sustainability issues and Hyperion (NASDAQ:NYSL), the global leader in Business Performance Management software, today announced the delivery of sustainability management and reporting software for global engineering and technology corporation Metso Oyj. The state-of-the-art software solution combines Proventia's sustainability management and reporting solution with HyperionÂ´s market-leading financial management and reporting tool in a single platform and user interface.

"We strongly feel that non-financial information such as emission calculations, employee health and safety issues and energy efficiency calculations should be managed and reported with the same kind of accuracy, processes and systems as financial data. This allows companies to use non-financial information efficiently in their management processes and truly find value in non-financials. With this Hyperion partnership, we can offer our customers a great opportunity to integrate our sustainability management framework with the leading financial data management solution. We are glad to see that innovative companies such as Metso share our vision and prove this in practice," said Mikko Valtonen, Managing Director of Proventia Solutions.

With the joint solution by Proventia Solutions and Hyperion, corporations can not only save time and costs by combining their financial and non-financial data management and reporting processes, but also get clear benefits and increased data management capabilities from a single reporting process and unified software tools.

"It is important for us to utilize our existing Hyperion Financial Management system to also manage our non-financial information. This saves time and helps us synchronize our reporting processes, which leads to better efficiency and more reliable non-financial reporting. Additionally, this allows us to provide our various stakeholders, such as investors, with accurate and reliable information, while supporting the sustainable development of our own operations," said Vice Precident Jouko Yli-Kauppila, in charge of IPR and Environmental Management at Metso Corporation.

Hyperion is developing its market-leading financial management systems to encompass non-financial data management together with Proventia Solutions. "Systematic monitoring and analyzing of non-financial data enables the integration of non-financials to business performance measurement. This way, management is able to gain a more thorough picture about the performance of its organization, while helping to integrate important responsibility issues into existing decision-making processes. This has been proven to create value to our customers," said Mika Salminen, Managing Director, Hyperion Finland.
