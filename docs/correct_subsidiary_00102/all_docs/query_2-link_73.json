        "text": "For the Borderlands 2 enemy faction, see Hyperion (faction).\n\nHyperion provides New-U Station services and is one of the chief weapon manufacturers on Pandora. They manufacture submachine guns, combat rifles/assault rifles, repeater pistols, rocket launchers, shotguns, and sniper rifles. Hyperion weapons are made of dark pink, red, silver, or black metal of a sort and have greater accuracy and damage when compared to guns of similar levels.\n\nIn Borderlands, weapons produced by this manufacturer are harder to find than most others, with only Atlas guns being harder to find. In later installments, such as Borderlands 2, Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel and Borderlands 3, Hyperion guns are much more common.\n\nInvolvement[]\n\nIn Borderlands, Hyperion maintains a Claptrap manufacturing plant in the Dividing Faults. This location forms a pivotal plot point in the fourth DLC, Claptrap's New Robot Revolution when the Interplanetary Ninja Assassin Claptrap uses it to 'claptrap' many of Pandora's inhabitants and wildlife to further the cause of the robot revolution.\n\nThe Hyperion Vice President, Mr. Blake then arrives on the planet to personally take charge of a counter-insurgency operation, accompanied by a group of soldiers.\n\nThe opening of the Vault and the appearance of Eridium gained the attention of a Hyperion employee named Handsome Jack who utilized it for Hyperion's profits. After opening the Vault on Elpis, he decides to use the Warrior to cleanse Pandora of bandits.\n\nAfter killing Harold Tassiter and destroying the Claptrap product line, Jack becomes the president of Hyperion. He then declares himself as the dictator of Pandora, intending to rule over the populace with an iron fist to eliminate \"bandits\", whilst also gathering Eridium to charge the Vault Key he stole from Patricia Tannis to unlock another Vault containing a powerful creature known as the Warrior, in order to secure his rule over the planet. He also maintains a facade when addressing everyone on Pandora, including his attempt to build the city of Opportunity and using the Hyperion Truth Network to spread propaganda. Jack is killed shortly after the Warrior is destroyed.\n\nBorderlands[]\n\nProducts[]\n\nHyperion manufactures assault shotguns, combat rifles, machine pistols, repeaters, rocket launchers, semi-auto sniper rifles, and submachine guns.\n\nA list of items produced by Hyperion.\n\nUnique weapons:\n\nCombat Rifle – The Sentinel\n\nRepeater Pistol – Lady Finger\n\nRepeater Pistol – Athena's Wisdom (The Secret Armory of General Knoxx only)\n\nSubmachine Gun – The Spy\n\nLegendary weapons:\n\nCombat Rifle – Destroyer\n\nMachine Pistol – Reaper\n\nRepeater Pistol – Invader (pistol)\n\nRocket Launcher – Nidhogg\n\nShotgun – Butcher\n\nSniper Rifle – Invader (sniper rifle)\n\nSubmachine Gun – Bitch\n\nClass Mods:\n\nBerserker – Warmonger\n\nHunter – Assassin, Sniper, Sharpshooter (Loyalty)\n\nSiren – Plaguebearer, Tormentor, Specter\n\nGrenade Mods:\n\nLongbow – Explosive, Corrosive, Incendiary, Shock\n\nShields:\n\nFire Resistance – Thermal, Asbestic, Endothermic\n\nPearlescent weapons:\n\nRepeater Pistol – Nemesis\n\nWeapon Tiers[]\n\nHyperion Valde = Level 13 - 21\n\nHyperion Melior = Level 22 - 30\n\nHyperion Ultra = Level 31 - 39\n\nHyperion Magnus = Level 40 - 47\n\nHyperion Optimus = Level 48+\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"Hyperion asks, 'What good is a gun that doesn't shoot where you point?'

The makers of the most precise weaponry in the universe.\" (Mad Moxxi in The Underdome Riot)\n\n\"Hyperion ... success requires making every opportunity count.\" (Mad Moxxi in The Underdome Riot)\n\nBorderlands 2[]\n\nHyperion has a corporate theme in Borderlands 2, with the theme of their weapon names being business buzzwords. The weapons having a sharp, angular appearance with their magazines inserted into the top of the weapon. The Hyperion weapon gimmick is \"reverse recoil;\" weapons start out with severe sway, but sustained fire causes them to increase in stability instead of decreasing. The listed accuracy on the weapon is what is achievable after the sustained fire increases their accuracy to maximum.\n\nThe Hyperion corporation and its CEO, a manipulative, charismatic narcissist named Handsome Jack, are the main antagonists in the game's plotline. Hyperion has extensive interests all across Pandora and has set up huge facilities to mass-produce loaders and harvest valuable Eridium ore.\n\nSome scoped Hyperion weapons in Borderlands 2 (excluding sniper rifles) seem to have large, bulky scopes, with an unnecessarily long-range zoom (especially seen on shotguns).\n\nProducts[]\n\nThe following are items made by Hyperion in Borderlands 2.\n\nCommon weapons\n\nPistols\n\n• Apparatus • Impact • Leverage • Synergy • Vision\n\nSMGs\n\n• Backburner • Presence • Projectile Convergence • Storm • Transmurdera • Weisenheimer • Wellness\n\nShotguns\n\n• Crowdsourcing • Development • Face Time • Projectile Diversification • Thinking\n\nSniper rifles\n\n• Competition • Policy • Sniper Rifle • Transaction\n\nE-tech weapons\n\nPistols – Dart • Spiker\n\nSMGs – Plasma Caster\n\nShotguns – Splatgun\n\nSniper Rifles – Hybridfication\n\nUnique weapons\n\nPistols – Fibber • Lady Fist\n\nSMGs – Bane • Commerce • Yellow Jacket\n\nShotguns – Heart Breaker • Shotgun 1340 • Slow Hand\n\nSniper Rifles – Fremington's Edge • Morningstar\n\nLegendary weapons\n\nPistols – Logan's Gun\n\nSMGs – Bitch\n\nShotguns – Conference Call • Overcompensator\n\nSniper Rifles – Invader • Longbow\n\nSeraph weapons\n\nSMGs – Actualizer\n\nShotguns – Interfacer\n\nPearlescent weapons\n\nShotguns – Butcher\n\nClass Mods\n\nCat • Specialist • Shot • Killer • Roboteer\n\nLegendary Cat • Legendary Killer • Legendary Mechromancer • Legendary Roboteer\n\nGrenade Mods\n\nSingularity Grenade\n\nNasty Surprise • Quasar\n\nShields\n\nAmplify Shield\n\nThe Bee\n\nRetainer\n\nPrefixes[]\n\nWeapons without accessory and without elemental capacitor Grip Bandit Dahl Hyperion Jakobs Maliwan Tediore Torgue Vladof Pistols Asset Deferred Inspiring Practical Auto Correcting Refactored Granular Facilitating Shotguns Asset N/A Inspiring Practical N/A Refactored Granular N/A SMGs Asset Deferred Inspiring N/A Stabilizing Refactored N/A N/A Sniper Rifles N/A Deferred Inspiring Practical No Prefix N/A N/A Facilitating\n\nRegardless of the grip they may spawn with, Face Time shotguns always receive the Bilateral prefix.\n\nRegardless of the grip they may spawn with, Thinking shotguns always receive the Customer Focused prefix.\n\nRegardless of the grip they may spawn with, Crowdsourcing shotguns always receive the Tri Fusion prefix.\n\nWeapons without accessory but with elemental capacitor Capacitor Corrosive Incendiary Shock Slag Pistols Base Hot Button Energizing Amplified Shotguns Industrial Clement Conductive Negative SMGs Base Hot Button Energizing Amplified Sniper Rifles Residual Thermogenic Energy Diffusion\n\nWeapons with accessory, with or without elemental capacitor Accessory Effect Pistols Shotguns SMGs Sniper Rifles Accuracy + Earnest - Analytical Longitudinal Fire rate + Dynamic - - Operational Bullet speed + - Potential Proactive - Damage + Win-Win - Rightsizing Auditing Reload speed + - Reactive Social - Stability + Core Practicable Corporate Cohesion Melee + Action Restructuring Cutting Edge Contingent Critical + - Critical - Venture Magazine size + Maximized Scalable - Resource Double Redundant - - - General boost + - Social - -\n\nRegardless of the grip or any accessory they may spawn with, Gemstone weapons always receive the Diamond prefix.\n\nGun Appearance by Quality[]\n\nWhite weapons\n\nFaded white and yellow color scheme. They appear well used with signs of environmental damage.\n\nGreen weapons\n\nBright Hyperion-yellow with white details. Colors are more vibrant with little to no signs of environmental damage.\n\nBlue weapons\n\nGreen with a yellow stripe with little to no signs of environmental damage.\n\nPurple weapons\n\nGlossy black with a red stripe. Yellow colored elements of some parts on the lower rarities are now high-polished golden metallic. Pristine appearance, no corrosion nor weathering visible.\n\nGemstone weapons\n\nWeapons with the \"Diamond\" prefix are mostly made of a cyan colored material, with other parts made of a reflective pink material.\n\nE-tech weapons\n\nE-tech weapons use the same color scheme as Purple weapons.\n\nLegendary weapons\n\nDifferent weapon classess use different colors and patterns. Bitch SMG has terra cotta matte paint job with scratch-like writings and some elemets in grey. Conference Call shotgun has glossy black finish with a bright red vertical stripe.\n\nSeraph weapons\n\nActualizer SMG has gradient color scheme with dark blue near the barrel, steelblue for the central section, and silver-ish grey stock. Interfacer shotguns use the color scheme simillar to that found on White rarity weapons.\n\nPearlescent weapons\n\nBeing the only Hyperion-made Pearlescent weapon, the Butcher has light firebrick color with a horizontal white stripe.\n\nOther rarity-specific visual changes:\n\nHyperion SMGs are reloaded slightly differently depending on reload speed:\n\nThe ammo-feeding mechanism on slower reloading (>2.5s) SMGs pops out, allowing clips to be replaced, where it then lowers back down.\n\nThe ammo-feeding mechanism on faster reloading (≤2.5s) SMGs pops out much farther; the gun is then physically tilted up to drop the used clip.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"Digi-structing your future.\" - Motto\n\nNotes[]\n\nHyperion submachine guns, shotguns and repeater pistols feature increasing accuracy as the trigger is held down. They will mostly always have high sway, but that will be rectified when fired continuously. Sniper rifles are the same, however they will gradually become more accurate while using the scope and do therefore not require being fired to reach maximum accuracy. The listed accuracy on the weapon is what is achievable after the sustained fire increases their accuracy to maximum.\n\nDue to their large spray, Hyperion submachine guns are often awkward to use because the first few shots usually hit nothing. Firing short, precise burst is almost impossible. Their superior stats compared to other manufacturers usually make up for it though.\n\nHyperion weapon sights often contain a consistent aesthetic; pistols have a flattened, futuristic sight with a trapezoidal screen when zoomed in; SMGs have a vertically rectangular reflex sight, shotguns use an extremely angled hexagonal sight, and sniper rifles have a futuristic look with an octagonal screen when zoomed in. Hyperion sights also have the highest zoom multipliers of any manufacturer.\n\nAll Hyperion weapons load from a magazine inserted at the top of the weapon. When reloading, Hyperion pistols and sniper rifles open a motorized hatch at the top for the user to remove the old magazine and insert a new one, which is then automatically loaded into the weapon. Hyperion shotguns and submachine guns are loaded in a fashion similar to that of the real-world FN P90; when reloading, the weapon will pop up the old magazine for removal and the new magazine is lowered automatically when inserted.\n\nAccuracy in Hyperion weapons can also depend on certain weapon grips; pistols use an elongated grip, shotguns use an aluminum pump, trigger with thumbhole/grip and SMGs use a dual thumbhole grip.\n\nBorderlands: The Pre-Sequel[]\n\nIn Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel, there are two distinct sets of Hyperion weapons, \"old Hyperion\" and \"new Hyperion\", as a result of Hyperion undergoing a \"transitional phase\" during the events of the game:\n\nWhat with the Dahl attack and Jack's impending rise, Hyperion is going through what a sweating PR shill might say is \"a transitional phase.\" Look for different styles of Hyperion weapons built during this period.\n\n—Loading screen tip\n\nThe two weapon sets share the same pool of weapon parts from various manufacturers, but have substantially different titles and prefixes. For example, a new Hyperion pistol named \"Earnest Synergy\" will have the same Vladof twin barrel and accuracy-enhancing laser accessory as the old Hyperion pistol named \"Trustworthy Expeditious\". Occasionally, a new Hyperion weapon may have old Hyperion naming or vice versa; the material (see below) is what distinguishes old- and new-style weapons.\n\nNew Hyperion weapons are essentially unchanged from those in Borderlands 2, except for the addition of laser weapons and the replacement of slag with cryo.\n\nOld Hyperion weapons use materials similar to those used in the original Borderlands, with a primary reddish color and a white horizontal stripe. This reddish color darkens towards crimson with increasing rarity, although blue-rarity weapons are predominantly black carbon fiber with red accents. Both styles have the characteristic Hyperion \"reverse recoil\"; however, with the general exception of Lasers, old Hyperion weapons have higher damage output at the cost of significantly lower accuracy and fire rate.\n\nLawrence De Quidt Maxim Turner Alma Harren Lawrence De Quidt founded Hyperion's artificial intelligence branch, prototyping the robots that now surround you. In his later years, De Quidt dedicated his life to correcting personality flaws in the early prototypes for the CL4P-TP steward bots. He passed away before making this dream a reality. Maxim Turner bankrolled the early days of Hyperion. One of the initial proponents of the Last Corporate War, Turner profited greatly from the fall of the central government. Using his vast resources to acquire Alma Harren and Lawrence De Quidt, Founder Turner built the Hyperion corporation into the diversified superpower it is today. Hyperion co-founder Alma Harren earned three-hundred confirmed kills during her time as a sniper in the Corporate Wars. After the downfall of the central government, Founder Harren made a name for herself as the mercenary who couldn't miss. Harren headed up Hyperion's weapon design department, prototyping the stabilizer technology that keep Hyperion guns the most accurate in the galaxy.\n\nGun Appearance by Quality (Old Hyperion)[]\n\nWhite\n\nFaded light red with a faded white stripe\n\nGreen\n\nRed with a white stripe\n\nBlue\n\nBlack carbon fiber with crimson details\n\nPurple\n\nDark crimson with a cream stripe and silver details\n\nProducts[]\n\nThe following are items made by Hyperion in Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.\n\nCommon weapons:\n\nPistols\n\n\"Old Hyperion\" – Apparatus • Attitude • Devigorator • Expeditious • Factualizer\n\n\"New Hyperion\" – Apparatus • Impact • Leverage • Synergy • Vision\n\nSMGs\n\n\"Old Hyperion\" – Ascerbic • Boiler • Brainstorm • Confidence • Fridge • Projectile Convergence • Pro-Target\n\n\"New Hyperion\" – Backburner • Cooler • Presence • Projectile Convergence • Storm • Transmurdera • Weisenheimer\n\nShotguns\n\n\"Old Hyperion\" – Aggressive Expansion • Crowd-Pleaser • Delivery • Focus Group • Session\n\n\"New Hyperion\" – Aggressive Expansion • Crowdsourcing • Development • Face Time • Thinking\n\nSniper Rifles\n\n\"Old Hyperion\" – Contract • Fast Turnaround • Outlay • Sniper Rifle\n\n\"New Hyperion\" – Competition • Policy • Sniper Rifle • Transaction\n\nLasers\n\nBeam (old and new styles)\n\nBlaster (old and new styles)\n\nRailgun (old and new styles)\n\nSplitter (old and new styles)\n\nUnique weapons:\n\nPistols – Globber • T4s-R\n\nSMG – Black Snake\n\nShotgun – Bullpup • Company Man\n\nSniper rifle – Fremington's Edge\n\nLaser – Mining Laser\n\nLegendary weapons:\n\nPistol – Logan's Gun\n\nSMGs – Cheat Code • Fatale\n\nShotgun – Viral Marketer\n\nSniper rifle – Invader • Omni-Cannon\n\nLasers – Excalibastard (old-style) • Longest Yard (new-style)\n\nClass Mods\n\nBlaster• Crapshooter • CEO • Economist • Entrepreneur • Equalizer • Femme Fatale • Fighter • Gladiatrix • Golem • Hero • Howitzer • Illusion • Loose Cannon • Mauler • Mech • Obliterator • Privileged • Projection • Protagonist • Queen • Scorcher • Terminator\n\nCelestial Baroness • Celestial Doppelganger • Celestial Enforcer • Chronicler of Elpis • Eridian Vanquisher\n\nGrenade Mods\n\nSingularity Grenade\n\nNasty Surprise • Quasar\n\nOz Kits\n\nAcrobat Oz Kit • Precision Strike Oz Kit\n\nFreedom Oz Kit • Springs' Oz Kit\n\n3DD1.E • Support Relay\n\nShields\n\nAmplify Shield\n\nShield of Ages\n\nPrismatic Bulwark • Rerouter\n\nPrefixes[]\n\nWeapons without accessory and without elemental capacitor (old Hyperion) Grip Bandit Dahl Hyperion Jakobs Maliwan Tediore Torgue Vladof Pistols Takeover Committed A-Triple-Plus Hard-Stopping Auto Correcting Slick Disintermediating Quatifying Shotguns Takeover N/A A-Triple-Plus Hard-Stopping N/A Slick Disintermediating N/A SMGs Takeover Committed A-Triple-Plus N/A Stabilizing Slick N/A N/A Sniper Rifles N/A Committed A-Triple-Plus Hard-Stopping No Prefix N/A N/A Quantifying\n\nWeapons without accessory and without elemental capacitor (new Hyperion) Grip Bandit Dahl Hyperion Jakobs Maliwan Tediore Torgue Vladof Pistols Acquired Standard Galvanizing Constructive Auto Correcting Solid Rugged Expediting Shotguns Acquired N/A Galvanizing Constructive N/A Solid Rugged N/A SMGs Acquired Standard Galvanizing N/A Auto Correcting Solid N/A N/A Sniper Rifles N/A Standard Galvanizing Constructive No Prefix N/A N/A Expediting\n\nWeapons without accessory but with elemental capacitor (old Hyperion) Capacitor Corrosive Fire Cryo Shock Pistols Disintegrating Passionate Wintery Galvanic Shotguns Rendering Intensified Chilled Energetic SMGs Rendering Intensified Chilled Energetic Sniper Rifles Downsizing Pyretic Cooling-Effect Power\n\nWeapons without accessory but with elemental capacitor (new Hyperion) Capacitor Corrosive\n\nFire\n\nCryo\n\nShock Pistols Base Hot Button Iced Energizing Shotguns Base Hot Button Iced Energizing SMGs Base Hot Button Frigid Energizing Sniper Rifles Residual Thermogenic Chilled Energy\n\nWeapons with accessory, with or without elemental capacitor (old Hyperion) Accessory Effect Pistols Shotguns SMGs Sniper Rifles Accuracy + Trustworthy Executive Considered Client-Focused Fire rate + Swift -

These energy shields are brought up when aiming down the sights and can soak some hits separate from the body shield.

It is also revealed that yellow is Jack's favorite color in several side quests."
