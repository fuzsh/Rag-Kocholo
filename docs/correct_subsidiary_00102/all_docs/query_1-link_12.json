        "text": "Oracle and Hyperion\n\nIn 2007, Oracle acquired Hyperion, a leading provider of performance management software. The transaction extends Oracle's business intelligence capabilities to offer the most comprehensive system for enterprise performance management. Over the past few years, Oracle has significantly reoriented our business intelligence product strategy, shifting our focus from offering a solution that works for Oracle-only environments towards offering a best-of-breed business intelligence and performance management product family that will work with heterogeneous information sources in an enterprise, both Oracle and non-Oracle.\n\nBusiness continues to change at an ever more rapid pace. Volatile market dynamics have immediate impact on a global scale. Organizations today are faced with higher degrees of uncertainty, forcing them to reinvent management practices, and to develop superior capabilities to manage the current performance and long term sustainability of their business. Corporate Boards and regulators are placing greater demands for transparency and accountability on these organizations. These new demands are piled on top of the traditional risks of globalization, deregulation, technology advancements, and commoditization. Data is also becoming increasingly more complex, less insightful and more difficult to analyze. As a result, executives are facing more pressure to ensure that information about their operations is correct and consistent. They must have confidence in their processes and in the results that they are reporting.\n\nEnterprise Performance Management (EPM) is a management discipline that focuses on supporting integrated management processes on a strategic, financial and operational level enabling organizations to more effectively run their business. What if you could have timely, accurate, and relevant intelligence with which to plan and control your entire organization? What if you could have the most important metrics to measure the performance of the organization at your fingertips? What if all of your management systems could work together to provide what you need, when you need it?\n\nThere are many benefits to Oracle Hyperion Financial Management:\n\nAugmented organizational flexibility\n\nImproved communication\n\nStakeholder alignment\n\nGovernance and compliance\n\nBetter preparation for changes\n\nSuperior business management\n\nConnected business processes\n\nDefined Business process framework\n\nAccountability and visibility\n\nTimely actionable information\n\nDecreased total cost of ownership\n\nIncreased return on investment\n\nLeverage ERP / CRM systems\n\nIncreased predictability\n\nReduced risk\n\nStrategic, competitive advantage\n\nStandardized management processes\n\nEnhanced efficiency and adaptability\n\nAs always there are many challenges to implementing, optimizing and realizing full value of an Oracle Hyperion system implementation. There are many factors that may lead to challenges for companies. How will my business process change? What changes can be made that better leverage the technology? How do we integrate the data? Who should have access to what?
