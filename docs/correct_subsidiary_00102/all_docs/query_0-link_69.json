        "text": "Hi - we are currently considering on whether to move our consolidation process from HFM to GCS and we need to know the pros and cons between the two. We have not used the GCS function although we use Oracle GL. We have search the internet for any documentation that can help us justify our plan, except the comparative study made by Pinnacle Tech. Is there any study that favors GCS more (and for what reasons), or could anyone who had experience with both systems share with us the pros and cons between the two? Many thanks.\n\nWhat I would probably do, is set up translation in GCS. In doing that, I would have as many corporate-level ledgers as they are subsidiary ledgers. For instance, you may have 5 subsidiaries running statutory accounting on 5 sets of books or balancing segments. I would map them to 5 SOBs or balancing segments that would run on corporate chart of accounts and than import data from those books with corporate COA into HFM. That way you will have all the advantages that I specified in my prior. Plus, if down the road you need to change the way you do your consolidation (e.g. at some point your company sells a subsidiary or controlling stake in one of the subsidiaries, hence you no longer consolidate it in full), you will still see a good history of consolidations in your HFM software. Other than consolidated-level adjustments (e.g. intercompany, goodwill) that you would need to make in HFM, all the source data would come from GCS giving your finance people great opportunity to explain any figure by drilling down from corporate books into source documents.\n\nIt would be useful to know why are you considering a move from HFM to GCS… anyway, some thoughts on typical benefits/downsides. Benefits: 1) GCS uses the same master files and based on the same data model as GL, therefore there is no need for integration (e.g. Chart of Accounts, currency rates) 2) GCS would allow you to drill down to source documents - as long as you transfer transactions (not balances) to your consolidated set of books. Downsides: 1) HFM is better than GCS in terms of tracking history of consolidation parameters, like entities and mappings that were used for consolidation purposes in the past 2) HFM is more visual, consequently it is easier to maintain, as you adapt your consolidation parameters to ever-changing needs 3) HFM shares the data model with Hyperion Planning, which could be a tangible benefit if you plan on using HP for financial planning and modelling. Alternatives: you may find it to be most beneficial using both GCS and HFM. GCS will become a source data for HFM. That way you would use GCS to prepare source data for consolidation, drill down from consolidated balances into source documents, do any currency revals, control monthly and annual book closing, make GAAP adjustments, etc. HFM would use that data from GCS once it is clean and ready. HFM’s purpose would be to help you make group-level adjustments, run consolidation processes and obtain consolidated reports. In my mind, that is typically the most effective way to organize consolidated reporting with Oracle apps."
