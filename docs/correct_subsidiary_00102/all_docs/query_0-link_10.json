        "text": "Hyperion Planning & Budgeting – History\n\nThe new Hyperion planning and budgeting is the idea backed by a worth sharing history. If we look back, we will be amazed to know that Hyperion Solutions Corporation was a software company initially located in Santa Clara in California, and was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2007. Since then, many products were developed from the Business Intelligence and Business Performance Management markets perspective. In 2013, it was developed and sold with the name of Oracle Hyperion products. In 1998, there was a merger between Hyperion Software (IMRS) and Arbor Software.\n\nSince, we can see the changing history in different years; we would like to share some.\n\nIn the year, 1981, IMRS was founded by Marco Arese & Thomas\n\nThen in 1983, IMRS launched financial and management consolidation software which is popular with the name “Micro Control”.\n\nIn 1985, IMRS hired Jim Perakis as CEO and during his tenure; the growth reaches from $1M to almost $300M.\n\nIMRS then became a public company in 1991, and launched ‘Hyperion’\n\nThen Arbor Software launched Online Analytical Processing Software in 1992, which is the first version of Essbase.\n\nIn 1995, after the excellent success of “Hyperion” product, IMRS changed its name to “Hyperion Software Corporation” and then the name of product was known with “Hyperion Enterprise”\n\nAfter the Arbor acquired AppSource, Hyperion Software merged with Arbor in 1998 and the company was renamed as “Hyperion Solutions”.\n\nIn 1999 Jeffery Rod eke was named CEO and Chairman of Hyperion.\n\nIn 2001, Godfrey Sullivan was named COO and President of Hyperion.\n\nThen Brio Technology and the Alca Group were acquired by Hyperion in 2003.\n\nIn 2006, Hyperion acquired Upstream and Beat ware.\n\nAnd then in 2007, Hyperion acquired Decisioning.\n\nThen on 1st March 2007, Oracle Corporation announced to purchase Hyperion Solutions Corporation for $3.3 billion in cash. This transaction was completed on 18th April, 2007 and then Hyperion started to operate as a division of Oracle. From then, Oracle has been giving an extended support for majority of Hyperion Products (v11.1.2.x) to 2018. Then the Hyperion BI tools were successfully bundled into Oracle Business Intelligence Suite Enterprise Edition.\n\nHyperion Planning & Budgeting – Competitors\n\nThe top 5 competitors of Hyperion Planning & Budgeting includes\n\nIBM Cognos\n\nProphix\n\nAnaplan\n\nAdaptive Insight\n\nVena\n\nHowever, more competitors include\n\nWorkday Adaptive Planning\n\nG2 Deals\n\nPlanful\n\nIBM Planning Analytics with Watson\n\nSAP Business Planning and Consolidation\n\nSAP Analytics Cloud\n\nOne Stream\n\nCCH Tagetik\n\nJed ox\n\nBoard\n\nHyperion Planning & Budgeting – Market Trends\n\nThe vendors of Hyperion in the business intelligence space are often categorized into:\n\nThe combined big four mega vendors named\n\nIBM Cognos\n\nMicrosoft BI\n\nSAP\n\nBusinessObjects\n\nHowever, the independent vendors include\n\nSAS\n\nTableau\n\nMicroStrategy\n\nQlikView\n\nHyperion has long list of products.
