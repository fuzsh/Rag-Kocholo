        "text": "We have vendor supplied tools (HP being one of them) that check to see if the computer is up and can tell if services are running but I found that these did not help very much so I’ve developed a set of scripts and processes that check the portal from front to back . There is a front-end web server response check process and another process for keeping tabs on the back-end servers.\n\nI have a checker script that I run every five minutes on Unix to check the response time of each web server. We use four web servers behind a firewall that are front-ended by an address on our Cisco load balancer. We have a landing site on another web server that our customers go to first when they log into our portal. The landing site allows us to post message-of-the day notices and has links to other sites and help aids. Users actually login from the landing. Before they are connected to a web server the get routed to the Kerberos authentication site to enter their user ID and password. The check script goes through the entire connection process including authentication, login, uses the core services, and retrieves the test document. The scripts provide the monitoring information.\n\nThe check script connects to our portal with each web server to retrieve the test.html document. The time it takes to retrieve the document is calculated and if it takes more than 10 second a warning that the (identified) web server is running slow; if the response time is over 60 seconds we get a failure message that lets us know that the identified web server may be in trouble. The script also checks that the landing site is up and taking connections. One alert is no big deal, but when we get a series of them, especially back-to-back failures on the same web server or several web servers failing at the same time, we look into it right away. I capture these check tests in a log file and upload them to a table in the repository nightly which allows me to look at the health of the web servers over time and gives me an easy way to report uptime stats to the CIO. I also have a weekly report that shows the slow and failed check tests over the past 30 days for each web server. This helps a lot but it isn’t checking the back-end servers that process BQY and SQR processing and scheduling services.\n\nI have a second set of scripts which is a bit of a kluge but it works on keeping tabs on our three back-end servers. On the portal I run simple test SQR and BQY programs every three minutes that publish a simple report back on the portal (which gets deleted after twenty minutes). The SQR report includes the back-end server that processed it, the BQY simply connect to the repository database but the server it used is in the published log file. In a separate process on a Unix server I have another set of scripts which connect to the repository database and looks for the latest SQR test and BQY test output and calculates how old it is. If it is over ten minutes we are sent an alert. Whenever we get one of these we check things ASAP.\n\nRegards\n\nBill\n\n“Again and again, the impossible problem is solved when we see that the problem is only a tough decision waiting to be made.”\n\nBill Lotozo\n\neReports Infrastructure\n\nOffice of the Chief Information Officer\n\nThe Ohio State University\n\n1121 Kinnear Road\n\nColumbus, Ohio 43212\n\n(614) 688-4362\n\nThat’s the tool that was offered by IT for monitoring, though they were\n\nreally pushing SCOM.\n\nBelow is a SiteScope summary report I get each morning…You can see that I\n\nmonitored the Hyperion services, as well as CPU, memory and disk.
