        "text": "3D printed construction can save time and money while ensuring health and safety for construction workers and improving the sustainability of the construction business. In the 3D Micro-Factories, design and engineering phases are expedited because they run in parallel. Moreover, earlier strength gain can be achieved: specifically, 50% of the total strength has been reached after one day. This leads up to 50% reduction in the execution time.Â The costs can also be reduced up to 30% as faster production and installation take place on site with less labor required, no formwork needed and less material used.Â By minimizing labor in the construction site, we reduce health and safety risks.Â As our mortar is made out of waste stream products, it is placed only where it is needed, and no formwork is used, we improve sustainabilityÂ up to 90%.Â\n\nAs structural design for 3D printing is not (yet) codified, we employ a method called âdesign by testingâ to justify our structures.\n\nHyperion owns a set of testing equipment that allows us to apply controlled force to a printed element. The result of the tests is then compared to the theoretical values obtained by calculation. We also have a close partnership with local testing laboratories where we can commission more specific material tests.\n\nHyperion Robotics is currently a member of the Global Committee (JG80) led by construction expert Stephan Mansour where we are looking to establish the ISO and ASTM standards and codes for 3D printing in the construction industry."
