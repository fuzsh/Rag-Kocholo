        "text": "Crafts Technology a Division of Hyperion Solutions proudly supported our own Emily Temmer as she competed in her fourth International Wheel Gymnastics World Championships on May 23-28, 2022, in Sønderborg, Denmark.\n\nAfter a four-year hiatus due to COVID, the International Wheel Gymnasts Federation (link to https://wheelgymnastics.sport/), referred to as the IRV, hosted close to 100 wheel gymnasts from 13 countries. According to the IRV, “There are three competitive disciplines within wheel gymnastics: straight-line, spiral, and vault.”\n\nAfter the competition in Denmark, Emily visited the Hyperion Materials & Technologies (link to https://www.hyperionmt.com/ ) manufacturing facility in Stockholm, Sweden. Hyperion Site Manager Christina Strömbäck and Operations Director Mats Karmehag welcomed Emily and were delighted to host her tour of the facility. After the visit, Emily noted, “It was interesting to see the process, learn more about the company, and meet our European partners.”\n\nEmily trained hard to qualify for the international competition and is already looking forward to the next world championships scheduled for 2024 in Israel. However, she is also working hard at another type of training, as an employee at Crafts Technology, where she’s currently a highly skilled machine and tool operator who aspires to join our engineering team in the future.\n\nWe congratulate Emily and will be by her side, cheering her on as she finds success at Crafts Technology and in the world of Wheel Gymnastics!"
