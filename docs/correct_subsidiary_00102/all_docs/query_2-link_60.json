        "text": "What is path tracing?\n\nPath tracing is a method for generating digital images by simulating how light would interact with objects in a virtual world. The path of light is traced by shooting rays (line segments) into the scene and tracking them as they bounce between objects.\n\nPath tracing gets its name from calculating the full path of light from a light source to the camera. Light can potentially bounce between many objects inside the virtual scene. As a ray of light hits a surface, it bounces and creates new rays of light. A path can therefore consist of a number of rays. By collecting all of the rays along a path together, the contributions of a light source and the surfaces along the path can be calculated. These calculations are used to produce a final image.\n\nIn many versions of path tracing (including the approach Hyperion takes), paths are started from the camera and shot into the scene to find connections to light sources. This is the opposite of how light behaves in the real world, but by doing this backwards, it is much easier to find light paths that will actually hit the camera.\n\nWhy path tracing?\n\nThe technique is capable of producing a high degree of realism. Because all of the interactions between lights and objects in the virtual scene are simulated, we can capture effects such as refraction and glossy reflections. Most importantly, we can produce images with indirect illumination where light reflecting off virtual objects is accounted for. Even light that reflects several times (called multi-bounce light) has an impact on the scene, incorporating subtle and not-so-subtle lighting effects.\n\nIn the following frames we see real photographs of objects with very different characteristics, compared to re-creations rendered in Hyperion.\n\nIn our movies, we encounter very large and complex settings such as San Fransokyo, the city in Big Hero 6. This would present a challenge to any renderer striving to simulate realistic lighting.\n\nUsing typical path tracing techniques, light bounces around randomly, encountering objects in an unpredictable order. This can lead to a massive amount of wasted time, especially in complex scenes. To tackle this difficult problem we use our own unique variation of path tracing.\n\nHyperion handles several million light rays at a time by sorting and bundling them together according to their directions. When the rays are grouped in this way, many of the rays in a bundle hit the same object in the same region of space. This similarity of ray hits then allows us – and the computer – to optimize the calculations for the objects hit.\n\nThanks to our novel method, we can render the entirety of San Fransokyo without resorting to tricks like creating paintings to imitate distant scenery. This lets us put the audience on Baymax's shoulders as he rockets through San Fransokyo without any constraints."
