BUSINESS\n\nGENERAL\n\nFounded in 1991, Hyperion Solutions Corporation (the \"Company\" or\n\n\"Hyperion\") develops, markets and supports business analysis software, which\n\nhelps turn raw data into business information. The Company's products and\n\nservices enables companies and their employees to plan, manage, and execute\n\nbusiness strategies to achieve faster revenue and profit growth, and ultimately\n\ncreate value for their shareholders.\n\nHyperion's products analyze the raw data captured in operational systems,\n\nwhich improves the return on investment that organizations have made in\n\nenterprise resource planning (\"ERP\"), supply chain management (\"SCM\"), customer\n\nrelationship management (\"CRM\"), marketing automation, Web and e-commerce\n\nsystems and data warehouses.\n\nHyperion provides a full suite of applications that cover analytical needs\n\nacross a wide variety of functional areas extending from \"front office\" to \"back\n\noffice.\" Hyperion uses its best of breed technology - Hyperion Essbase OLAP\n\nServer - as the foundation of its comprehensive enterprise analysis platform.\n\nThis on-line analytical processing (\"OLAP\") server technology, along with\n\npackaged business analysis applications, and an extensive family of application\n\ndevelopment tools and data and application integration technologies give\n\nHyperion one of the deepest and broadest product offerings in the market. In\n\naddition, Hyperion offers highly rated support and services from offices in 26\n\ncountries, and works with over 400 partners to provide solutions to more than\n\n6,000 customer organizations worldwide.\n\nHyperion and its network of over 400 partners deliver Web and\n\nmobile-enabled solutions that address a broad range of cross-industry and\n\nindustry-specific business analysis requirements. These include performance\n\nmeasurement; financial planning, analysis and consolidation; management\n\nreporting; customer relationship analysis; partner relationship analysis;\n\nproduct profitability; budgeting, planning and forecasting; and demand and\n\ncapacity planning. Hyperion is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.\n\n-2-\n\n4\n\nINDUSTRY BACKGROUND\n\nIn response to today's competitive pressures, most businesses need faster\n\nrevenue and profit growth, which ultimately leads to value creation. They also\n\nneed analysis support for the full business cycle, including its reporting,\n\nanalyzing, modeling and planning stages. They require systems and processes that\n\nfacilitate faster, better decisions in relation to opportunities and threats,\n\nsupport for increasingly collaborative planning and help in driving execution of\n\nthose decisions and plans.\n\nAt the same time, organizations generate significant volumes of transaction\n\nlevel data within their sales, marketing, service, support, development,\n\nmanufacturing, finance and administrative systems. This data is typically\n\ncaptured in different formats in a variety of information systems. Web and\n\ne-commerce initiatives have added another important but disparate source of data\n\nabout employees, customers, suppliers, partners and competitors. Data is also\n\nobtained from external sources for use in applications such as competitive\n\nbenchmarking.\n\nBusiness analysis software helps turn this raw data into \"Business\n\nInformation.\" At its best, software (such as Hyperion's) provides a full \"circle\n\nof analysis,\" often starting with helping the organization to get a 360 degree\n\nview of their customers from a number of touchpoints. But it should not end\n\nthere. The customer analysis should be linked to analysis of other company data,\n\nincluding operational, supplier, employee and financial. Organizations want the\n\nflexibility to start with their most pressing analysis needs, such as financial\n\nor performance analysis, and then incorporate customer analysis - as they\n\ncomplete the circle.\n\nHyperion believes that customers will increasingly demand a full suite and\n\nintegrated platform approach that supports more effective decision-making and\n\nfaster revenue and profit growth. The applications, technology foundation and\n\nassociated tools and services which comprise a company's business analysis\n\nplatform must be specifically designed to leverage the return on the investment\n\nthat organizations have already made in raw data collection and operational\n\nsystems.\n\nThis strategic approach is in contrast to the tactical manner in which some\n\norganizations address analysis requirements today. Using standalone\n\napplications, query and reporting tools and spreadsheets, for example, employees\n\nin different functional areas conduct analyses that are potentially incomplete\n\nor inaccurate. Deployment of a common business analysis platform helps employees\n\nexecute the basic management cycle of reporting, analyzing, modeling and\n\nplanning by providing consistent information. Additionally, it allows an\n\norganization to create and execute strategic, financial and operational plans\n\nthat are in alignment.\n\nTo be useful, all of the data to be analyzed must also be accessed,\n\ncleansed, transformed, extracted and then analyzed using an assortment of\n\nsophisticated quantitative methods. It must be summarized, visualized and\n\npresented in a variety of formats - from spreadsheets and specialized financial\n\nreport formats, to multidimensional views and graphical Web-based presentations\n\n- - that are meaningful and intuitive to users throughout the organization. Since\n\nmost global organizations use multiple operational systems that capture data in\n\ndifferent formats, integrating and interpreting this enterprise data is an\n\nincreasingly critical requirement. To take full advantage of the value of the\n\ndata stored in existing systems and accelerate decision-making requires specific\n\nbusiness analysis software that provides data quality and integrity, scalability\n\nand ease of use across the organization.\n\n-3-\n\n5\n\nHyperion believes that the business analysis software market is developing\n\nas a historical parallel of the relational database applications market. The\n\nbusiness analysis software market includes two significant segments: the \"buy\"\n\nmarket supported by packaged (or \"pre-built\") analysis applications, and\n\n\"custom-built\" analysis applications, in both cases based on key technologies\n\nthat include OLAP servers, data and application integration technologies, and\n\nWeb-enabled reporting, analysis, presentation and application development tools.\n\nOrganizations demand the availability of both \"custom-built\" and \"pre-built\"\n\nsolutions to accommodate current and future requirements. Historically,\n\ncompanies initially purchased relational databases and developed applications\n\nwith in-house or third party resources. Later, as packaged applications such as\n\nERP and CRM suites became more fully functional and general purpose in scope,\n\nthe total life cycle cost of ownership decreased sufficiently to create a\n\ncommercial market opportunity. As expected, organizations are increasingly\n\nbuying packaged business analysis applications when feasible and OLAP tools and\n\ntechnologies to develop custom analysis applications in-house to meet their more\n\nspecialized needs.\n\nThe Company believes that, in the business analysis software market as in\n\nthe relational database market, applications drag technologies and vice versa.\n\nBoth create network effects. \"Network effects\" means that the greater the number\n\nof solutions that are available on a platform, the more valuable that platform\n\nbecomes to customers. Hyperion believes that it must fully embrace partners to\n\nmaximize the number of third-party solutions available on the Hyperion platform\n\nto be successful in the business analysis software market.\n\nHyperion's business analysis platform is comprehensive, scalable, open and\n\nenterprise-class and meets industry needs with a full suite and platform\n\napproach specifically designed to leverage return on the investment\n\norganizations have already made in raw data collection and operational systems.\n\nBusiness analysis software represents the next logical step in the evolution of\n\nenterprise application software and has spawned an industry that will exceed\n\n$11.6 billion in the next four years, according to industry analysts. Hyperion\n\nis currently the leader in this fast growing, global business analysis software\n\nmarket.\n\nSTRATEGY\n\nHyperion's objective is to be the leading global provider of business\n\nanalysis software products and services. These products and services give the\n\nCompany's customers the power to leverage their information assets for strategic\n\npurposes and enable organizations to improve customer service, make additional\n\nsales to existing customers and successfully exploit new market opportunities to\n\ndrive profitable growth. The Company intends to accomplish this by continuing to\n\nenhance its scalable, easy-to-use, cross-platform OLAP technology and tools,\n\nbringing more packaged business analysis applications to market faster, basing\n\nthese applications and related services on its OLAP technology, and expanding\n\nits network of partners. Hyperion intends to deliver business analysis solutions\n\nfor emerging market requirements such as performance management, electronic\n\ncustomer relationship management (\"eCRM\") analysis, supply-chain management\n\n(\"SCM\") analysis, trading exchange analysis, workforce and skills management\n\nanalysis and industry-specific analyses. The Company also intends to enable\n\nthese solutions for new mobile-based information delivery technologies such as\n\nwireless application protocol (\"WAP\").\n\n-4-\n\n6\n\nHyperion believes that a high level of customer service and the resultant\n\nhigh level of customer satisfaction is critical to the successful marketing and\n\nsales of its existing and new products. The Company provides a broad range of\n\nworldwide consulting, training and support services that help its customers and\n\npartners implement, customize, enhance, support and extend its business analysis\n\nplatform. In response to market conditions, Hyperion is committed to building a\n\nworld-class workforce to deliver these offerings. Hyperion is also committed to\n\nsupporting the more than 400 partners that deliver complementary products and\n\nservices, meeting a wide variety of customer requirements. These solutions\n\ninclude additional packaged business analysis applications, data and application\n\nintegration technologies, tools, custom application development and\n\nimplementation and training services, all of which use the Company's OLAP server\n\ntechnology as the foundation. The Company believes that the number of partners\n\noffering solutions based on Hyperion applications and technology coupled with\n\nsustained growth in new partnerships validate its business analysis platform as\n\nan emerging standard. These partner relationships increase the network effects\n\nof Hyperion's business analysis platform, enhance the Company's market reach and\n\nprovide Hyperion customers with comprehensive solutions that deliver greater\n\nflexibility and choice.\n\nKey elements of the Company's strategy include:\n\nLeverage Existing Market Leadership Position. The Company plans to enhance\n\nits OLAP technology, Hyperion Essbase OLAP Server, with even greater scalability\n\nand ease of use features and tighter integration with relational data sources.\n\nThe Company intends to actively seek the co-development of vertical and\n\nhorizontal applications based on Hyperion Essbase with outside organizations.\n\nThe Company also intends to embed Hyperion Essbase as a key differentiator in\n\nall of its business analysis applications. Hyperion believes that these\n\nactivities will increase the ability of the Company and its partners to deliver\n\nan integrated suite of business analysis applications across key market areas.\n\nThe Company believes its key strengths are its established distribution channels\n\nand comprehensive strategic technology platform for business analysis, but also\n\nbelieves that its proven domain expertise and credibility gained from market\n\nleadership in the financial applications area can be leveraged to win business\n\nin new markets.\n\nIncrease Focus and Penetration of Key Markets. The Company plans to focus\n\nits intellectual capital and leverage its partners to provide best-of-breed\n\nbusiness analysis solutions in key markets including performance management,\n\neCRM analysis, financial analysis, supply-chain analysis, OLAP technology and\n\ntools, and data warehousing. Hyperion alliance partners will also provide\n\nadditional solutions for markets outside of the Company's current areas of focus\n\nsuch as workforce analysis and industry-specific solutions.\n\nFoster Strategic Relationships. To accelerate the adoption of the Company's\n\nbusiness analysis platform, Hyperion has established over 400 strategic\n\nrelationships, including the following:\n\n- Application Partners include enterprise software companies such as ERP\n\nproviders that either integrate their enterprise packaged application\n\nsuite with Hyperion products to enhance business analysis capabilities,\n\nand/or develop horizontal or vertical business analysis applications\n\nsuch as budgeting, sales forecasting, demand planning or profitability\n\nanalysis, using Hyperion products.\n\n-5-\n\n7\n\n- Tools Partners include developers of products and technologies that\n\nintegrate with the Hyperion product family for enterprise information\n\ndelivery and analysis. These tools include query and reporting,\n\napplication development, spreadsheets, visualization, statistics,\n\nmapping and systems management.\n\n- Data Integration Partners include developers of software that work with\n\nthe Company to provide data integration with data marts, data\n\nwarehouses or packaged application suites such as ERP and customer\n\nrelationship management packages.\n\n- Platform Partners manufacture and/or develop hardware platforms,\n\noperating systems, and relational databases supported by the Hyperion\n\nproducts.\n\n- Complementary Technology Partners focus on the resale, implementation\n\nand support of complementary software technology that works with the\n\nCompany's software products.\n\n- Service Partners include system integrators and consulting and\n\neducation partners that sublicense Hyperion products and/or provide\n\nservices including systems planning, analysis, design, development,\n\nimplementation, customization, systems integration and training\n\nservices to the Company's customers and partners.\n\n- Distribution Partners include worldwide and territory-specific\n\norganizations that sell and support Hyperion products in a specific\n\ngeography.\n\nHyperion's partner network enhances and expands the Company's distribution\n\nchannels, and extends its business analysis platform by providing a wider range\n\nof choices for its customers.\n\nDesign for Ease of Implementation and Ease of Use. The Company's packaged\n\napplication products are designed for an end-user role in maintenance, with\n\nminimal training. By supporting familiar interfaces such as spreadsheets, Web\n\nbrowsers and, increasingly, mobile-based computing interfaces, users become\n\nproductive more quickly. The Company also provides process-specific analysis\n\nexpertise by embedding that expertise into its packaged application offerings\n\nand through its experienced consulting personnel. Following implementation,\n\ncustomers are able to operate self-sufficiently with trained administrators at\n\nheadquarters locations and independent end-users at headquarters and at remote\n\nsites.\n\nMaintain Sales and Support Relationships. The Company licenses its products\n\nto customers throughout the world through a direct sales force as well as\n\nthrough independent distributors and sales agents in certain regions, and\n\nthrough reseller arrangements with other technology and application software\n\ncompanies, and major systems integrators (\"channel partners\"). Hyperion and its\n\npartners often provide installation and post-sale consulting support to build\n\nlong-term customer relationships.\n\nGenerate Follow-on Revenues. The Company generates revenues from existing\n\ncustomers through licensing for additional users, the cross-selling of licenses\n\nof new products and annual maintenance fees. In addition, sales of training and\n\nconsulting services to existing customers represent a significant portion of the\n\nCompany's total service revenues. Follow-on revenues leverage sales and\n\nmarketing resources and strengthen the Company's relationships with its\n\ncustomers.\n\n-6-\n\n8\n\nPRODUCTS AND SERVICES\n\nHyperion offers customers an open, scalable, flexible and integrated\n\nbusiness analysis platform which consists of: Hyperion Essbase, its OLAP server\n\ntechnology; four categories of packaged business analysis applications including\n\nHyperion eCRM Analysis, Hyperion Financial Analysis, Hyperion Performance\n\nManagement, and the newly announced Hyperion Supply-Chain Management Analysis;\n\nand Hyperion Tools.

Organizations that deploy\n\nHyperion Performance Scorecard are better able to bridge the gap between\n\nstrategy and execution, engage a broader range of employees in planning\n\nactivities and respond more proactively to changing business conditions.\n\nHyperion Performance Scorecard embeds industry-leading metric libraries, exposes\n\nworld class benchmarking services and supports customized and standard\n\nperformance measurement frameworks, including the Balanced Scorecard.\n\nHyperion Activity Based Management is a Web-enabled business analysis\n\napplication that is designed to help manage and optimize strategy by causing\n\nassumptions about strategy to be constantly tested and revised. Using an\n\noperational approach rather than strictly financial formulas, Hyperion Activity\n\nBased Management builds sophisticated models of activities within a business\n\nprocess in order to determine the true cost of a customer, product or channel,\n\nfor example, and promote a better understanding of resource utilization and\n\nassociated operational constraints. Starting with requirements, the\n\nactivity-based models determine how employees, processes and resources should be\n\ndeployed to fulfill these requirements most efficiently.\n\nHYPERION ANALYSIS TOOLS\n\nHyperion Analysis Tools are designed to provide best-in-class solutions for\n\na broad range of enterprise analysis, reporting and information delivery needs.\n\nHyperion Analysis Tools range from solutions that work right out of the box,\n\nthrough to an open, standards-based framework for assembling custom business\n\nanalysis applications.\n\nHyperion Enterprise Reporting is an advanced financial reporting solution\n\nfor Hyperion Enterprise. An intuitive graphical interface helps users create\n\nsophisticated production-quality financial reports for printing or on-line\n\naccess. Embedded process-specific financial intelligence provides accurate and\n\ndetailed financial information, while a comprehensive library of financial\n\nfunctions and calculations allow users to derive new metrics.\n\nHyperion Reports delivers highly formatted management reports to an\n\nenterprise. Tightly integrated with Hyperion Essbase OLAP Server, Hyperion\n\nReports provides versatile query and reporting capabilities that allow users to\n\ncreate reports from data in multiple sources. A scalable, cross-platform Report\n\nServer facilitates deployment to large user communities. These features make\n\nHyperion Reports an appropriate solution for a wide range of enterprise\n\nreporting applications, including profit-and-loss, balance sheet and statutory\n\nreporting.\n\nHyperion Analyzer delivers intuitive Web-based graphical presentation of\n\nOLAP data and interactive analysis across all levels of an organization.\n\nDesigned for enterprise-wide deployment, Hyperion Analyzer can adapt to meet the\n\ninformation requirements of employees\n\n-10-\n\n12\n\nin different functions and at different levels of the organization. This makes\n\nit ideal for a broad range of sales, marketing, and other ad-hoc business\n\nanalysis applications such as sales analysis, product profitability, and key\n\nperformance measurement.\n\nSERVICES AND SUPPORT\n\nHyperion believes that a high level of customer service and the resultant\n\nhigh level of customer satisfaction is important to the successful marketing and\n\nsale of its products. The Company offers an extensive selection of worldwide\n\ntraining, consulting, and technical support services to install, implement,\n\ncustomize, and support its products. Consulting and training services are not\n\nincluded in software license fees, but are provided on a time and materials\n\nbasis. Within the area of technical support, enhanced support offerings are not\n\nincluded in the software license fees. The Company believes that as a result of\n\nproviding customers with the flexibility to select and customize the level of\n\nconsulting, training, and technical support services that best meets their\n\nneeds, customer satisfaction has remained high. Hyperion's services and support\n\norganization consisted of 878 employees as of June 30, 2000. Hyperion has also\n\nestablished a global network of partners who deliver implementation and training\n\nservices.\n\nUnder the terms of the Company's standard license agreement, customers may,\n\nat their option, pay a maintenance fee annually. This maintenance fee entitles\n\ncustomers to technical support, including telephone and Web-based support, and\n\nto any updates and enhancements provided for their software.\n\nSALES AND MARKETING\n\nHyperion markets and sells its products in the United States, Canada,\n\nEurope and Asia through its direct sales force and worldwide through original\n\nequipment manufacturers (OEMs), value-added resellers (VARs), independent\n\ndistributors and sales agents. The Company supports its sales force with lead\n\ngeneration and marketing programs which include telemarketing, public relations,\n\ndirect mail, advertising, seminars, trade shows, education, ongoing customer\n\ncommunication programs, third-party alliances and user group conferences.\n\nWorldwide and regional user conferences are held annually. Regional user\n\nmeetings and product-specific focus groups are also scheduled periodically.\n\nSales cycles generally last from three to nine months. Hyperion has dedicated\n\nsales, marketing and technical alliance resources designed to optimize its\n\npartner relationships. The direct sales force is compensated for direct sales as\n\nwell as sales made through indirect channel partners to ensure appropriate\n\ncooperation with the Company's OEMs and VARs, independent distributors and sales\n\nagents. The Company has licensed its software to more than 6,000 organizations\n\nworldwide, many of which are multidivision and/or multilocation organizations\n\nwith diverse information management requirements. In the past three fiscal\n\nyears, no one customer accounted for more than 10% of total revenues.\n\nHyperion's sales and marketing organization consisted of 678 employees as\n\nof June 30, 2000. The Company has sales offices at its headquarters in\n\nSunnyvale, California and in other U.S. and international locations including\n\nAmsterdam, Atlanta, Baltimore, Boston, Brussels, Calgary, Charlotte, Chicago,\n\nCincinnati, Cleveland, Copenhagen, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, Frankfurt, Hamburg,\n\nHong Kong, Houston, Linz, London, Los Angeles, Madrid, Manchester, Melbourne,\n\nMilan, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Montreal, Munich, Newark, New York City, Ottawa,\n\n-11-\n\n13\n\nParis, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Rome, San Diego, San Francisco, Sao Paolo,\n\nSeattle, Seoul, Singapore, Stamford, St. Louis, Stockholm, Sydney, Tokyo,\n\nToronto, Washington, D.C. and Zurich. Product support and training are available\n\nas well through many of these locations.\n\nHyperion has been able to leverage sales and marketing through its\n\npartnering strategy with channel partners that distribute or resell the\n\nCompany's products in their respective markets. The Company has license and\n\ndistribution agreements with independent distributors and sales agents in\n\nArgentina, Australia, Brazil, Egypt, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Israel, Japan,\n\nKorea, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Turkey and\n\nSwitzerland, as well as other territories of North America, Europe and Asia. The\n\ndistributors generally maintain sales and services personnel dedicated to the\n\nCompany's products. The distribution agreements generally provide for the right\n\nto offer the Company's products within a territory, in return for royalties\n\ntypically equal to 50% of license and renewal fees.\n\nRevenues derived from channel partners for fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 were\n\n16.5%, 14% and 10.7% of total revenues, respectively. Hyperion's channel\n\npartners include, but are not limited to: Arthur Andersen LLP; Comshare,\n\nIncorporated; Deloitte & Touche LLP; Ernst & Young Technologies, Inc.; Fujitsu\n\nLimited; International Business Machines Corporation; i2 Technologies, Inc.;\n\nKPMG Consulting Inc.; Lawson Associates, Inc.; Mitsubishi Corporation;\n\nPeopleSoft, Inc.; ShowCase Corporation; Software House International; Vantage\n\nSource and Walker Interactive Systems, Inc.\n\nIn each of its 2000, 1999 and 1998 fiscal years, approximately 34.4%, 37.6%\n\nand 31.7%, respectively, of the Company's total revenues were derived from\n\nmarkets outside of the United States.\n\nRESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\n\nThe Company's products have been developed by its internal staff as well as\n\nthrough strategic acquisitions. When developing a new product or enhancement,\n\nthe Company consults with customers and other external resources to determine\n\ntheir requirements.\n\nThe Company's development efforts are focused on new products, as well as\n\non maintaining the competitiveness of its current product line, including\n\ndevelopment of the next releases of Hyperion Enterprise, Hyperion Essbase OLAP\n\nServer, Hyperion Performance Measurement and Hyperion Pillar. During calendar\n\nyear 2000, Hyperion expects to have released at least thirteen major new\n\nproducts or releases, a significant increase over the prior three calendar\n\nyears. As of June 30, 2000, the Company's product development was performed by\n\n496 employees located at its facilities in Sunnyvale and Foster City,\n\nCalifornia; Stamford, Connecticut; Orlando, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; and\n\nToronto, Canada.\n\nCOMPETITION\n\nThe markets in which Hyperion competes are intensely competitive, highly\n\nfragmented and characterized by rapidly changing technology and evolving\n\nstandards. The Company's current and potential competitors offer a variety of\n\nreporting, analysis, modeling and planning software solutions and generally fall\n\nwithin four categories: (i) vendors of OLAP Server software; (ii) vendors of\n\nenterprise software applications that support transaction processes and\n\nfront/back office automation; (iii) vendors of front-end information access\n\ntools; and (iv) vendors of\n\n-12-\n\n14\n\npackaged business analysis applications. While competition is intense on any\n\nindividual business analysis opportunity, the Company believes that no other\n\ncompetitor currently has the singular focus and breadth of products and services\n\nrequired to deliver enterprise-wide business analysis solutions. As the\n\nvisibility of business analysis solutions continues to increase with industry\n\nsenior executives, Hyperion believes it is currently positioned to capitalize\n\non the demand. As markets continue to develop for business analysis software\n\nproducts, additional competitors may enter or expand into those markets and\n\ncompetition may intensify.\n\nHyperion has experienced, and expects that it will continue to experience,\n\nincreased competition from current and potential competitors, some of whom have\n\nsignificantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than\n\nthe Company. Such competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or\n\nemerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater\n\nresources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than the\n\nCompany. Also, certain current and potential competitors may have greater name\n\nrecognition or more extensive customer bases that could be leveraged, thereby\n\ngaining market share to the Company's detriment. Hyperion expects additional\n\ncompetition as other established and emerging companies enter into the\n\nenterprise software market and new products and technologies are introduced. In\n\naddition, as the Company develops and enhances its software and complementary\n\nproducts, the resulting new functionality may duplicate the functionality of,\n\nand thus compete with, other products offered by channel partners. Increased\n\ncompetition could result in price reductions, fewer customer orders, reduced\n\ngross margins and loss of market share, any of which would materially adversely\n\naffect the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nCurrent and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or\n\nestablish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties,\n\nthereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of\n\nHyperion's existing and prospective customers. Further competitive pressures,\n\nsuch as those resulting from competitors' discounting of their products, may\n\nrequire the Company to reduce the price of its software products, which would\n\nmaterially adversely affect the Company's business, operating results and\n\nfinancial condition. There can be no assurance that Hyperion will be able to\n\ncompete successfully against current and future competitors, and the failure to\n\ndo so would have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business,\n\noperating results and financial condition. See \"Part I, Item 7, Risk Factors.\"\n\nPROPRIETARY RIGHTS AND LICENSES\n\nThe Company relies primarily on a combination of patent, copyright and\n\ntrademark laws, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual\n\nprovisions to protect its proprietary rights. Despite the Company's efforts to\n\nprotect its proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects\n\nof the Company's products or to obtain and use information that the Company\n\nregards as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of the Company's products is\n\ndifficult, and while the Company is unable to determine the extent to which\n\npiracy of its software products exists, software piracy is expected to be a\n\npersistent problem. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not\n\nprotect the Company's proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the United\n\nStates. There can be no assurance that the Company's means of protecting its\n\nproprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be adequate or that\n\ncompetitors will not independently develop similar technology. The Company has\n\nentered into source code escrow agreements with a number of its customers and\n\nindirect channel partners\n\n-13-\n\n15\n\nrequiring release of source code under certain conditions. Generally, such\n\nagreements provide that such parties will have a limited, nonexclusive right to\n\nuse such code in the event that there is an undismissed bankruptcy proceeding by\n\nor against the Company, if the Company ceases to do business or if the Company\n\nmaterially fails to meet its contractual obligations. The release of source code\n\nmay increase the likelihood of misappropriation by third parties.\n\nHyperion currently has a small number of patents relating to its products,\n\nincluding four United States patents, two foreign patents and a number of patent\n\napplications pending in the United States and abroad. There can be no assurance\n\nthat the Company's patents will not be invalidated, circumvented or challenged,\n\nthat the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the\n\nCompany or that any of the Company's pending or future patent applications,\n\nwhether or not being currently challenged by applicable governmental patent\n\nexaminers, will be issued with the scope of the claims sought by the Company, if\n\nat all. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that others will not develop\n\ntechnologies that are similar or superior to the Company's technology or design\n\naround the patents owned by the Company. In 1998, the U.S. Patent and Trademark\n\nOffice granted two requests for reexamination of the Company's U.S. Patent No.\n\n5,359,724 (the \"'724 Patent\"). The requests were made by Gentia Software in\n\nconnection with its litigation with the Company over the validity and\n\nenforceability of the '724 Patent. While the litigation between Gentia and the\n\nCompany has been settled, the reexamination proceedings are currently pending.\n\nSee \"Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\"\n\nThe Company expects that software product developers will increasingly be\n\nsubject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in the\n\nCompany's industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different\n\nindustry segments overlaps. Any such claims, with or without merit, could be\n\ntime consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, divert management's\n\nattention and resources, cause product shipment delays or require the Company to\n\nenter into royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing\n\nagreements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to the\n\nCompany, if at all. In the event of a successful claim of product infringement\n\nagainst the Company and failure or inability of the Company to license the\n\ninfringed or similar technology, the Company's business, operating results and\n\nfinancial condition would be materially adversely affected.\n\nThe Company relies upon certain software that it licenses from third\n\nparties, including software that is integrated with the Company's internally\n\ndeveloped software and used in the Company's products to perform key functions.\n\nThere can be no assurance that these third party software licenses will continue\n\nto be available to the Company on commercially reasonable terms. The loss of, or\n\ninability to maintain, any such software licenses could result in shipment\n\ndelays or reductions until equivalent software could be developed, identified,\n\nlicensed and integrated, which would materially adversely affect the Company's\n\nbusiness, operating results and financial condition.\n\nThe Company distributes its products under software license agreements that\n\ngrant customers a nonexclusive, nontransferable license to the Company's\n\nproducts and contain terms and conditions prohibiting the unauthorized\n\nreproduction or transfer of the Company's products. Generally, the Company does\n\nnot provide end users with the source code for its products except under the\n\nescrow arrangements as described above.\n\n-14-\n\n16\n\nEMPLOYEES\n\nAs of July 31, 2000, the Company employed a total of 2,464 employees,\n\nincluding 701 in marketing and sales, 1,416 in research and development,\n\nservices and customer support, and 347 in management, administration and\n\nfinance. None of the Company's employees is represented by a labor union. The\n\nCompany believes its relations with employees are good.\n\nThe executive officers of the Company as of September 15, 2000, are as\n\nfollows:\n\nName Age Position\n\n---- --- --------\n\nJeffrey R.

PROPERTIES\n\nHyperion's principal administrative, sales and services, marketing, and\n\nresearch and development facilities are principally located in Sunnyvale and\n\nFoster City, California, Stamford, Connecticut, Toronto, Canada, Atlanta,\n\nGeorgia and Orlando, Florida. The Company occupies approximately 100,000 square\n\nfeet at its headquarters in Sunnyvale, California, pursuant to a lease which\n\nexpires in December 2002. The Company also owns and occupies approximately\n\n230,000 square feet in Stamford, Connecticut. The Stamford site permits future\n\nexpansion of approximately 300,000 square feet of additional space. The Company\n\nalso leases office space throughout the world for its local sales and services\n\nneeds. Hyperion believes that its existing facilities are adequate for its\n\ncurrent needs; however, if additional space is needed in the future, Hyperion\n\nbelieves that suitable additional or alternative space will be available on\n\ncommercially reasonable terms as needed.\n\nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n\nOn July 11, 1997, Gentia Software filed a request for reexamination of\n\nHyperion's U.S. Patent No. 5,359,724 with the United States Patent and Trademark\n\nOffice (the \"PTO\") arguing that the '724 patent was anticipated and obvious in\n\nlight of certain prior art references. On September 11, 1997, the PTO granted\n\nthe request for reexamination. On February 27, 1998, Gentia Software filed a\n\nrequest for a second reexamination of the '724 patent with the PTO based on\n\nadditional prior art references. On May 22, 1998, the PTO granted that request\n\nfor reexamination, which was later consolidated with the first reexamination. On\n\nMarch 31, 1999, the PTO issued a non-final office action rejecting the claims of\n\nthe `724 patent. Hyperion filed its response to the office action on May 31,\n\n1999. No final office action has been issued by the PTO. The Company believes\n\nthat the outcome of such action will not have a material adverse effect on the\n\nfinancial position of the Company.\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of business, various claims are\n\nmade against the Company. At this time, in the opinion of management, there are\n\nno pending claims the outcome of which is expected to result in a material\n\nadverse effect on the financial position of the Company.\n\nITEM 4. SUBMISSION OF MATTERS TO A VOTE OF SECURITY HOLDERS\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report, no\n\nmatter was submitted to a vote of security holders through the solicitation of\n\nproxies or otherwise.\n\n-17-\n\n19\n\nPART II\n\nITEM 5.

The Company's products and services enables companies and\n\ntheir employees to plan, manage, and execute business strategies to achieve\n\nfaster revenue and profit growth, and ultimately create value for their\n\nshareholders. The Company's products analyze the raw data captured in\n\noperational systems, which improves the return on investment that organizations\n\nhave made in enterprise resource planning (\"ERP\"), supply chain management\n\n(\"SCM\"), customer relationship management (\"CRM\"), marketing automation, Web and\n\ne-commerce systems and data warehouses.\n\nHyperion provides a full suite of applications that cover analytical needs\n\nacross a wide variety of functional areas extending from \"front office\" to \"back\n\noffice.\" Hyperion uses its best of breed technology - Hyperion Essbase OLAP\n\nServer - as the foundation of its comprehensive enterprise analysis platform.\n\nThis online analytical processing (\"OLAP\") server technology, along with\n\npackaged business analysis applications, and an extensive family of application\n\ndevelopment tools and data and application integration technologies give\n\nHyperion one of the deepest and broadest product offerings in the market. In\n\naddition, Hyperion offers highly rated support and services from offices in 26\n\ncountries, and works with over 400 partners to provide solutions to more than\n\n6,000 customer organizations worldwide.\n\nHyperion and its network of over 400 partners deliver Web and\n\nmobile-enabled solutions that address a broad range of cross-industry and\n\nindustry-specific business analysis requirements. These include performance\n\nmeasurement; financial planning, analysis and consolidation; management\n\nreporting; customer relationship analysis; partner relationship analysis;\n\nproduct profitability; budgeting, planning and forecasting; and demand and\n\ncapacity planning. The Company is headquartered in Sunnyvale, California.\n\nHyperion derives revenues from licensing its software products and providing\n\nrelated software maintenance and support, product installation and\n\nimplementation, and training services. Customers are billed an initial license\n\nfee for the software upon delivery. A maintenance fee entitling customers to\n\nroutine support and product updates is billed annually. With operations in\n\ntwenty-six countries, Hyperion licenses its products throughout the world\n\nthrough a direct sales force and through independent distributors and sales\n\nagents, including other technology and application software companies, and major\n\nsystems integrators (\"channel partners\"). The Company includes in revenues its\n\nnet share of revenues generated by channel partners. In the event that an agent\n\nhas facilitated the sale and Hyperion is the licensor, the license revenue is\n\nreported gross and a commission charge is reflected.\n\n-20-\n\n22\n\nITEM 7.

The growth in software sales was\n\nled by increased sales force productivity and demand for the Company's business\n\nanalysis software.\n\nSoftware license revenues declined in fiscal 1999 versus fiscal 1998 primarily\n\nas a result of a decrease in the number of licenses sold (unit volume) versus,\n\nfor example, price decreases. Moreover, due primarily to merger integration\n\nrelated activities, including sales and marketing execution issues, software\n\nsales were less than the Company plan, particularly in North America beginning\n\nin the December 1998 quarter. The Company appointed new sales leadership and\n\nexpanded its sales training and lead generation programs, resulting in sales\n\nproductivity improving gradually each quarter through the balance of fiscal\n\n2000.\n\nService and annual maintenance revenue grew in fiscal 2000, albeit at a slower\n\nrate than in the prior fiscal year, due to reduced license revenue volumes in\n\nfiscal 1999 and the first half of fiscal 2000.\n\nRevenues generated from markets outside the United States, including export\n\nsales, for fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 were $171.1 million, $159.9 million and\n\n$119.6 million, or 34.4%, 37.6% and 31.7% of total revenues, respectively.\n\nRevenue growth was particularly strong in France, Italy and Scandinavia in\n\nfiscal 2000, and in France, Italy and the Netherlands in fiscal 1999.\n\nRevenues derived from channel partners for fiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998 were\n\n16.5%, 14% and 10.7% of total revenues, respectively.\n\nIn October 1997, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants issued\n\nStatement of Position 97-2, \"Software Revenue Recognition\" (\"SOP\"), which\n\nprovides guidance on applying generally accepted accounting principles in\n\nrecognizing revenue on software transactions. Effective July 1, 1998, the\n\nCompany adopted the SOP, as amended, and the impact on operating results for the\n\nfiscal year was not material. However, should the Company adopt new licensing\n\npractices or change its current ones, in response to a preference from the\n\nmarket or otherwise, then the Company's revenue recognition practices may be\n\nsubject to significant change to comply with the accounting requirements of the\n\nSOP, as amended.\n\n-21-\n\n23\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n\nIn December 1999, the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission issued its\n\nStaff Accounting Bulletin (\"SAB\") No. 101, \"Revenue Recognition.\" SAB No. 101\n\nprovides guidance on the measurement and timing of revenue recognition in\n\nfinancial statements of public companies. Changes in accounting policies to\n\napply the guidance of SAB No. 101, as amended, must be adopted by recording the\n\ncumulative effect of the change in the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2001.\n\nManagement is currently assessing the impact that adoption of SAB No. 101 will\n\nhave on the Company's financial statements.\n\nCOST OF REVENUES\n\nYEAR ENDED JUNE 30,\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n2000 CHANGE 1999 CHANGE 1998\n\n-------------------------------------------------------\n\n(dollars in thousands)\n\nSoftware licenses $ 8,782 12.6% $ 7,799 (24.5)% $ 10,335\n\nGross profit percentage 96.3% 96.2% 95.2%\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMaintenance and services $141,915 23.1% $115,265 22.8% $ 93,829\n\nGross profit percentage 44.7% 47.3% 42.4%\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCost of software license revenues consists primarily of the cost of product\n\npackaging and documentation materials, amortization of capitalized software\n\ncosts, amortization of certain intangible assets related to business\n\nacquisitions, and royalty expenses. The amortization of capitalized software\n\ncosts begins upon the general release of the software to customers. The increase\n\nin the cost of software license revenues in fiscal 2000 over the prior fiscal\n\nyear principally reflects royalty fees related to third-party software\n\ndistributed by the Company and an increase in amortization expense of certain\n\nintangible assets related to business and technology asset acquisitions. The\n\nincrease is offset, to a lesser extent, by a decrease in amortization of\n\ncapitalized software costs.\n\nThe nonrecurring increase in the cost of software license revenues in fiscal\n\n1998 principally reflected royalty fees related to third-party software\n\ndistributed by the Company in 1998.\n\nThe increases in the cost of maintenance and service revenues for fiscal 2000\n\nand 1999 were due primarily to additional staffing expense for both installation\n\nand ongoing support services.\n\nOPERATING EXPENSES\n\nYEAR ENDED JUNE 30,\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n2000 CHANGE 1999 CHANGE 1998\n\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n(dollars in thousands)\n\nSales and marketing $191,414 16.1% $164,913 23.9% $133,124\n\nPercentage of total revenues 38.5% 38.8% 35.3%\n\n- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nResearch and development $ 70,199 10.0% $ 63,813 30.3% $ 48,957\n\nPercentage of total revenues 14.1% 15.0% 13.0%\n\n- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral and administrative $ 44,437 15.4% $ 38,500 8.3% $ 35,557\n\nPercentage of total revenues 8.9% 9.1% 9.4%\n\n- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFor the most part, the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2000\n\nwas due to a net increase in sales and marketing personnel. In fiscal 1999,\n\nsales and marketing expenses rose over fiscal 1998 for the same reason.\n\n-22-\n\n24\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n\nThe increase in research and development expenses reflects additional personnel\n\ncosts associated with expanded product research and development activities. In\n\nfiscal 2000, 1999 and 1998, the Company capitalized $2.6 million, $1.8 million\n\nand $2.7 million of software development costs, respectively, in accordance with\n\nStatement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 86, \"Accounting for the Costs of\n\nComputer Software to be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed.\" The amounts\n\ncapitalized relate to the Company's development of enterprise-wide, packaged\n\nanalytic application solutions for client/server environments and represented\n\n3.5%, 2.7% and 5.2% of total research and development expenditures (excluding\n\nacquired in-process technology). Capitalized software costs are amortized over\n\nthe estimated economic life of the product, but generally not for more than\n\nthree years.\n\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 2000 resulted,\n\nfor the most part, from an increase in personnel costs incurred to manage and\n\nsupport the growth of the Company's overall operations, offset to a lesser\n\nextent by a change in accounting estimates of $3.7 million, primarily related to\n\nproduct warranties for older product lines and the reduction of tax\n\ncontingencies in various jurisdictions.\n\nThe increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal 1999 resulted,\n\nfor the most part, from increases in personnel and professional services costs\n\nincurred to manage and support the growth of the Company's overall operations.\n\nAlso, the increase in 1999 was net of the $1.2 million charge incurred in the\n\nfirst quarter of 1998 for additional support expenses associated with certain\n\ndiscontinued Hyperion products.\n\nThe merger of Arbor Software Corporation (former name of the Company) and\n\nHyperion Software Corporation was completed on August 24, 1998. The Company's\n\nfinancial statements have been restated for all periods presented to reflect the\n\nbusiness combination, which was accounted for as a pooling of interests. The\n\nCompany charged $19.5 million, $17.4 million after taxes, to operations for\n\nnonrecurring merger costs incurred. These charges include direct transaction\n\ncosts primarily for financial advisory services and legal fees of $13.9 million,\n\nand costs of $5.6 million associated with combining the operations of the two\n\ncompanies, including $3.4 million for restructuring (more specifically, $1.9\n\nmillion for the closing of duplicate offices, employee severance and\n\nrelocations) and the write down of certain intangible assets. For further\n\ndetails of the merger, see Note B of the accompanying financial statements.\n\nIn fiscal 2000, the Company recorded a one-time charge to operations of\n\napproximately $2.1 million, $1.3 million after taxes, associated with\n\nrestructuring its European operations and costs associated with outsourcing its\n\nNorth American-based accounting department. This charge is comprised primarily\n\nof severance costs.\n\nINTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE\n\nYEAR ENDED JUNE 30,\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n2000 CHANGE 1999 CHANGE 1998\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n(dollars in thousands)\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterest income $13,010 18.0% $11,029 119.2% $5,031\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nInterest expense $(5,588) 3.9% $(5,378) 739.0% $ (641)\n\n- ------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-23-\n\n25\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n\nNet interest income grew in fiscal 2000 due to the increase in cash available\n\nfor investment. Growth in the prior year was also due to the increase in cash\n\navailable for investment, resulting from the issuance in March 1998 of $100\n\nmillion of 4.5% convertible subordinated notes and from operations.\n\nPROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES\n\nExcluding the impact of merger costs in the prior year, the Company's effective\n\nincome tax rate remained substantially unchanged at approximately 37%.\n\nNET INCOME\n\nAs a result of the above factors, net income for 2000 increased to $28.8\n\nmillion, or by 261%, from $8 million for 1999. Net income decreased 77.1% in\n\n1999, from $34.8 million for 1998. Excluding the nonrecurring charges, the\n\nCompany would have had net income of $30 million, $25.4 million and $37.8\n\nmillion for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2000, 1999 and 1998, respectively.\n\nTo date, the overall impact of inflation on the Company has not been material.\n\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nIn June 1998, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 133,\n\n\"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\" (\"SFAS 133\").\n\nSFAS 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative\n\ninstruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other\n\ncontracts, and for hedging activities. In July 1999, the Financial Accounting\n\nStandards Board issued SFAS No. 137, \"Accounting for Derivative Instruments and\n\nHedging Activities - Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133\"\n\n(\"SFAS 137\"). SFAS 137 deferred the effective date of SFAS 133 until the first\n\nfiscal quarter ending on or after June 30, 2000. In June 2000, the Financial\n\nAccounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 138, \"Accounting for Certain\n\nDerivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities - an amendment of FASB\n\nStatement No. 133\" (\"SFAS 138\"). SFAS 138 amends certain of the accounting and\n\nreporting standards of SFAS 133 for certain derivative instruments and certain\n\nhedging activities. The Company will adopt SFAS 133, as amended, in its quarter\n\nending September 30, 2000. The Company has not engaged in hedging activities or\n\ninvested in derivative instruments and, accordingly, does not believe\n\nimplementation of SFAS 133 will have a material effect on its financial\n\nstatements.\n\nIn March 2000, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation\n\nNo. 44, \"Accounting for Certain Transactions Involving Stock Compensation -- an\n\ninterpretation of APB Opinion No. 25\" (\"FIN 44\"). This Interpretation clarifies\n\nthe definition of employee for purposes of applying Accounting Principles Board\n\nOpinion No. 25, \"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees,\" the criteria for\n\ndetermining whether a plan qualifies as a noncompensatory plan, the accounting\n\nconsequence of various modifications to the terms of a previously fixed stock\n\noption or award, and the accounting for an exchange of stock compensation awards\n\nin a business combination. This Interpretation is effective July 1, 2000, but\n\ncertain conclusions in this Interpretation cover specific events that occur\n\nafter either December 15, 1998, or January 12, 2000. The Company believes that\n\nthe impact of FIN 44 will not have a material effect on the financial position\n\nof the Company.\n\n-24-\n\n26\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n\nRISK FACTORS AND QUARTERLY FINANCIAL INFORMATION\n\nMARKET RISKS\n\nAt June 30, 2000, the Company's investment portfolio consisted of\n\ninvestment-grade debt securities, excluding those classified as cash\n\nequivalents, of $32.8 million (see Notes A and C of the accompanying financial\n\nstatements). The portfolio is invested predominantly in short-term securities to\n\nminimize interest rate risk and for liquidity purposes in the event of immediate\n\ncash needs. Accordingly, if market interest rates were to increase immediately\n\nand uniformly by 10% from levels as of June 30, 2000, the decline in the fair\n\nvalue of the portfolio would not be material.\n\nThe Company's long-term debt bears interest, for the most part, at a fixed rate\n\n(see Note G of the accompanying financial statements) and, therefore, relative\n\nto its long-term debt, an immediate 10% change in market interest rates would\n\nnot materially impact the Company's financial statements.\n\nApproximately one-third of the Company's sales, cost of sales and marketing is\n\ntransacted in local currencies. As a result, the revenue and expenses associated\n\nwith the Company's operations from markets outside the United States are subject\n\nto foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nFACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\n\nThe Company operates in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment that\n\ninvolves numerous risks, some of which are beyond the Company's control. The\n\nfollowing discussion highlights some of these risks.\n\nGENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. The revenue growth and profitability of the Company\n\ndepends on the overall demand for computer software and services, which in turn\n\ndepends on general economic and business conditions. A softening of demand for\n\ncomputer software caused by weakening of the economy may result in decreased\n\nrevenues or lower growth rates. There can be no assurance that the Company will\n\nbe able to effectively promote revenue growth rates in all economic conditions.\n\nCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. The markets in which Hyperion competes are intensely\n\ncompetitive, highly fragmented and characterized by rapidly changing technology\n\nand evolving standards. Hyperion has experienced, and expects that it will\n\ncontinue to experience increased competition from current and potential\n\ncompetitors, some of whom may have significantly greater financial, technical,\n\nmarketing and other resources than the Company. Hyperion expects additional\n\ncompetition as other established and emerging companies enter into the\n\nenterprise business analysis software market and new products and technologies\n\nare introduced. Increased competition could result in price reductions, fewer\n\ncustomer orders, reduced gross margins and loss of market share, any of which\n\nwould materially adversely affect the Company's business, operating results and\n\nfinancial condition. See \"Part I, Item 1, Competition.\"\n\n-25-\n\n27\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n\nPRICING. Intense competition in the various markets in which the Company\n\ncompetes may put pressure on the Company to reduce prices on certain products,\n\nparticularly in the markets where certain vendors offer deep discounts in an\n\neffort to recapture or gain market share or to sell other software or hardware\n\nproducts. Moreover, any broadly based changes to the Company's or its\n\ncompetitors pricing packaging or distribution models could lead to a decline or\n\ndelay in sales as the Company's sales force and its customers adjust to the new\n\nmodels. Any such price reductions and resulting lower license revenues could\n\nhave a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations\n\nor financial position if the Company cannot offset these price reductions with a\n\ncorresponding increase in sales volumes or lower spending.\n\nHIRING AND RETENTION OF EMPLOYEES. The Company's future operating results depend\n\nin significant part upon the continued service of its key technical and senior\n\nmanagement personnel. Hyperion's future success also depends on its continuing\n\nability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales, and managerial\n\npersonnel. Competition for such personnel is intense, and there can be no\n\nassurance that the Company will retain its key managerial or technical personnel\n\nor attract such personnel in the future. Hyperion has at times experienced and\n\ncontinues to experience difficulty in recruiting qualified personnel and there\n\ncan be no assurance that the Company will not experience such difficulties in\n\nthe future. The Company, either directly or through personnel search firms,\n\nactively recruits qualified research and development, financial and sales and\n\nmarketing personnel. If Hyperion is unable to hire and retain qualified\n\npersonnel in the future, such inability could have a material adverse effect on\n\nthe Company's business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nBACK-ENDED QUARTERS. Quarterly revenues and operating results are highly\n\ndependent on the volume and timing of the signing of licensing agreements and\n\nproduct deliveries during the quarter, which are difficult to forecast. A\n\nsignificant portion of the Company's quarterly software licensing agreements is\n\nconcluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter, generally with a\n\nconcentration of such revenues earned in the final ten business days of that\n\nmonth. Due to the relatively fixed nature of certain costs, including personnel\n\nand facilities expenses, a decline or shortfall in quarterly and/or annual\n\nrevenues typically results in lower profitability or may result in losses.\n\nINTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. A substantial portion of the Company's revenues is\n\nderived from international sales and is therefore subject to the related risks,\n\nincluding the general economic conditions in each country, the overlap of\n\ndifferent tax structures, the difficulty of managing an organization spread over\n\nvarious countries, changes in regulatory requirements, compliance with a variety\n\nof foreign laws and regulations, longer payment cycles and volatilities of\n\n-26-\n\n28\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n\nexchange rates in certain countries. There can be no assurances that the Company\n\nwill be able to successfully address each of these challenges in the near term.\n\nOther risks associated with international operations include import and export\n\nlicensing requirements, trade restrictions and changes in tariff rates.\n\nA significant portion of the Company's business is conducted in currencies other\n\nthan the U.S. dollar. Changes in the value of major foreign currencies relative\n\nto the value of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the\n\nCompany's business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nORGANIZATIONAL AND PRODUCT INTEGRATION RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS. The Company has\n\nmade and expects to continue to make acquisitions of, or significant investments\n\nin, businesses that offer complementary products, services and technologies.\n\nThere are risks involved in acquisitions of businesses, including but not\n\nlimited to: the possibility that the Company pays more than the value it derives\n\nfrom the acquisition; the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel\n\nof the acquired businesses; the potential product liability associated with\n\nselling the acquired company's products; the potential disruption of the\n\nCompany's ongoing business and the distraction of management from the Company's\n\nbusiness. These factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company's\n\nbusiness, results of operations or financial position, especially in the case of\n\na large acquisition.\n\nNEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTION. The Company competes in a market characterized by\n\nrapid technological advances in hardware and software development, evolving\n\nstandards in computer hardware and software technology and frequent new product\n\nintroductions and enhancements. The Company's failure to successfully enhance\n\nand improve its products in a timely manner, and position and/or price its\n\nproducts, undetected errors or delays in new products or new versions of a\n\nproduct could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, results\n\nof operations or financial position.\n\nPARTNER SUPPORT OF HYPERION ESSBASE API. Hyperion's future success will depend\n\nin part upon the availability of third party tools and applications that address\n\ncustomer requirements and work with Hyperion's business analysis platform and\n\nHyperion Essbase through the Hyperion Essbase Application Programming Interface\n\n(\"API\"). Failure by third parties to support the Company's API, or failure by\n\nthe Company to maintain, develop and market competitive business analysis\n\napplications or to adopt industry standard APIs, if and when they emerge, could\n\nmaterially adversely affect the Company's business, operating results and\n\nfinancial condition.\n\n-27-\n\n29\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n\nCONVERSION OF INTERNAL FINANCIAL SYSTEMS. The Company is in the process of\n\nreengineering certain of its internal financial management processes and\n\nmigrating its internal financial systems to an ERP solution provided through an\n\noutsourcing engagement with Arthur Andersen LLP. Arthur Andersen began\n\nperforming certain accounting functions for the Company in July 2000. The\n\nCompany currently anticipates that the transition of remaining identified\n\nactivities will be completed by the end of fiscal 2001. There can be no\n\nassurance, however, that such migration will be completed on schedule or will\n\nnot cause a disruption to the Company's operations or any resulting disruption\n\nwill not have an adverse impact on the Company's business, operating results and\n\nfinancial condition.\n\nSALES FORECASTS. The Company uses a \"pipeline\" system, a common industry\n\npractice, to forecast sales and trends in the Company's business. The Company's\n\nsales personnel monitor the status of all proposals, such as the date when they\n\nestimate that a customer will make a purchase decision and the potential dollar\n\namount of the sale. Management aggregates these estimates periodically in order\n\nto generate a sales pipeline. Management compares the pipeline at various points\n\nin time to look for trends in the Company's business. While this pipeline\n\nanalysis is useful to management in business planning and budgeting, these\n\npipeline forecasts are only estimates and may not correlate to revenues in a\n\nparticular quarter or over a longer period of time. A significant discrepancy\n\nbetween actual results and sales forecasts could cause the Company to improperly\n\nplan or budget and thereby adversely affect its business or results of\n\noperations.\n\nSALES FORCE TRANSITION. The Company has restructured or made other adjustments\n\nto its sales force operations in the past and may do so in the future. These\n\nchanges have historically resulted in temporary sales productivity issues in the\n\nshort term.\n\nENFORCEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. The Company relies\n\nprimarily on a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws, trade\n\nsecrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect its\n\nproprietary rights. There can be no assurance that the Company's means of\n\nprotecting its proprietary rights in the United States or abroad will be\n\nadequate or that competitors will not independently develop similar technology.\n\nSee \"Part I, Item 1, Proprietary Rights and Licenses.\"\n\nPOSSIBILITY OF INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS. The Company expects that software product\n\ndevelopers will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of\n\nproducts and competitors in the Company's industry segment grows and the\n\nfunctionality of products in different industry segments overlaps. Any such\n\nclaims, with or without merit, could be time consuming to defend, result in\n\ncostly litigation, divert management's attention and resources, cause product\n\nshipment delays or require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing\n\nagreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may not be\n\navailable on terms acceptable to the\n\n-28-\n\n30\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n\nCompany, if at all. In the event of a successful claim of product infringement\n\nagainst the Company and failure or inability of the Company to license the\n\ninfringed or similar technology, the Company's business, operating results and\n\nfinancial condition would be materially adversely affected. See \"Part I, Item 1,\n\nProprietary Rights and Licenses.\"\n\nPOSSIBLE VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICE. The market price of the Company's Common\n\nStock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate\n\nsignificantly. The market price of the Common Stock may be significantly\n\naffected by factors, including but not limited to, the announcement of new\n\nproducts, product enhancements or technological innovation by the Company or its\n\ncompetitors, changes in the Company's or its competitors' results of operations,\n\nchanges in revenue and revenue growth rates for the Company as a whole or for\n\nspecific geographic areas or business units, changes in earnings estimates by\n\nmarket analysts, and general market conditions or market conditions specific to\n\nparticular industries. Technology stocks have experienced wide fluctuations in\n\nprices, which sometimes have been unrelated to their operating performance. The\n\nmarket price of the Company's Common Stock could be adversely affected by such\n\nfluctuations.\n\nQUARTERLY RESULTS\n\nThe following table sets forth certain unaudited operating results for each of\n\nthe Company's eight most recent fiscal quarters. This information has been\n\nprepared by the Company on the same basis as its audited financial statements\n\nappearing elsewhere in this Annual Report and includes all adjustments\n\n(consisting only of normal recurring adjustments) necessary to present fairly\n\nthis information when read in conjunction with the Company's audited financial\n\nstatements and notes thereto. The Company's operating results for any one\n\nquarter or series of quarters are not necessarily indicative of results for any\n\nfuture period.\n\nQuarter Ended\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJune 30, March 31, Dec. 31, Sept. 30, June 30, March 31, Dec. 31, Sept. 30,\n\n2000 2000 1999 1999 1999 1999 1998 1998\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(in thousands, except per share data)\n\n(unaudited)\n\nTotal revenues $148,064 $125,798 $115,793 $107,250 $111,399 $101,646 $106,958 $104,882\n\nOperating income\n\n(loss) 12,335 8,478(b) 9,347 8,237 9,657(a) 2,924 12,124 (9,583)(a)\n\nNet income (loss) 9,108 6,613(b) 7,073 6,025 6,679(a) 2,579 8,648 (9,933)(a)\n\nDiluted earnings\n\n(loss) per share .27 .19(b) .22 .19 .22(a) .08 .28 (.33)(a)\n\n(a) Excluding the $21.8 million ($18.7 million after tax) nonrecurring charge\n\naccrued in the September quarter for merger costs and the related $(2.3)\n\nmillion ($(1.3) million after tax) credit recorded in the June quarter, the\n\nCompany would have had operating income of $12.2 million and $7.3 million,\n\nand net income of $8.8 million and $5.4 million or $.28 and $.17 per pro\n\nforma diluted share, for its first quarter ended September 30, 1998 and its\n\nfourth quarter ended June 30, 1999, respectively.\n\n(b) Excluding the $2.1 million ($1.3 million after tax) nonrecurring charge\n\naccrued in the March quarter for restructuring, the Company would have had\n\noperating income of $10.5 million and net income of $7.9 million or $.23\n\nper pro forma diluted share.\n\n-29-\n\n31\n\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\n\nOF OPERATIONS (CONTINUED)\n\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo date, the Company has financed its business through positive cash flow from\n\noperations and, to a lesser extent, through the issuance of its capital stock\n\nand convertible subordinated notes. For fiscal years 2000, 1999 and 1998, the\n\nCompany generated positive cash flow from operations of $27.8 million, $43.2\n\nmillion and $87.6 million, respectively.\n\nCash used by investing activities amounted to $26 million for fiscal 2000,\n\nincluding $21.8 million primarily for purchases of computer equipment and\n\nsoftware.\n\nFinancing activities in fiscal 2000, including stock options exercised by\n\nemployees and payments of indebtedness, generated net cash of $30.7 million. In\n\nconnection with the stock options exercised by certain of its employees (for a\n\ntotal of 1,774,000 common shares), the Company recognized (as a credit to\n\nadditional paid-in capital) an income tax benefit of $8.6 million for the year\n\nended June 30, 2000. The Company also made principal payments of $4.5 million\n\nrelated to the loan agreement with the Connecticut Development Authority (the\n\n\"CDA\") governing the $9.5 million mortgage loan issued to the Company by the CDA\n\nin 1995 to purchase an office and research facility in Stamford, Connecticut.\n\nAs of June 30, 2000, the Company had cash, cash equivalents and short-term\n\ninvestments of $295.2 million, working capital of $297.7 million, and $102.5\n\nmillion of long-term debt. Cash equivalents are comprised primarily of\n\ninvestment-grade commercial paper, and U.S. federal, state and political\n\nsubdivision obligations with varying terms of three months or less. The Company\n\nanticipates capital expenditures of approximately $30 million for its 2001\n\nfiscal year. The Company intends to continue to review potential acquisitions\n\nand business alliances that it believes would enhance its growth and\n\nprofitability.\n\nFrom time to time, in the normal course of business, various claims are made\n\nagainst the Company. At this time, in the opinion of management, there are no\n\npending claims the outcome of which is expected to result in a material adverse\n\neffect on the financial position of the Company.\n\nThe Company believes that its current cash and short-term investment balances,\n\nand the funds generated from its operations, if any, will be sufficient to\n\nfinance the Company's business for at least the next year.\n\n-30-\n\n32\n\nITEM 8. REPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS,\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\n-31-\n\n33\n\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS\n\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of\n\nHyperion Solutions Corporation\n\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the index\n\nappearing under Item 14(a)(1) on page 58 present fairly, in all material\n\nrespects, the financial position of Hyperion Solutions Corporation and its\n\nsubsidiaries at June 30, 2000 and 1999, and the results of their operations and\n\ntheir cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended"
