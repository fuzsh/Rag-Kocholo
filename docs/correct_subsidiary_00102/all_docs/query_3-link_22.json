It provides financial stakeholders with the ability to rapidly close and report financial results, meet global regulatory requirements, reduce the cost of compliance and deliver confidence in the numbers. This is delivered in a single, highly scalable software solution, using today's most advance technology, yet is built to be owned and maintained by the enterprise's finance team.\n\nIn today's rapidly changing Corporate environment, a client's organizational structure is more regularly being updated. Hyperion Financial Management (HFM) , while one of the most intuitive and powerful tools in the market for Financial Consolidation and Reporting, also has a very flexible model in being able to adapt to an ever changing environment.

In addition, it is one of the leading SOX compliance ready tools in the Financial Consolidation market, with its powerful Process Management tool, where validation and approval of data has never been easier or more comprehensive.\n\nHyperion Financial Management (HFM) runs off a standard relational database management platform, and will accommodate metadata and data from any source through ETL tools, Data Mapping tools (such as Financial Data Quality Management ), delimited text, direct input (through a variety of out-of-box and custom built data grids and forms), or through the audit-ready and compliant Journals module. Hyperion Financial Management (HFM) uses advanced sub-cube processing technology to be able to process, consolidate and report your data in a very efficient and timely manner, insuring accurate financials and instant access to your reporting.\n\nThe relational repository also allows HFM to collect textual information critical to a coordinated understanding of the financials. As with all Hyperion products, along with its web software application, HFM also has an add-in with Microsoft Office (called Smart View) which allows users to input, manage, and report their data in Microsoft Excel, Word, or Powerpoint, an environment comfortable to most finance users.\n\nHyperion Financial Management (HFM) is part of Oracle's on-premise Hyperion EPM software suite and is often utilized with Hyperion Financial Reports and Web Analysis to provide top notch reporting and graphical capabilities, including Dashboards.
