        "text": "In a move to expand the legal transformation services it offers law firms and legal departments, the global company Epiq has acquired Hyperion Global Partners, a major provider of business and technology services to the legal profession.\n\nEpiq, formed in 2016 out of the combination of Epiq Systems and DTI, and rebranded as Epiq in January 2018, is best known as a provider of discovery services such as data collection, forensics, information governance, data processing, document review and data hosting.\n\nBut over the past year, it has steadily expanded its “transformation solutions” business, delivering business management services and solutions to corporate in-house law departments, law firms and other clients.\n\nHyperion’s business appears to be a good fit with Epiq. Founded in 2009, it provides business and technology consulting to the legal profession, working with larger law firms, corporate legal departments and public sector agencies.\n\nThe acquisition includes Hyperion’s legal operations advisory practice as well as Hyperion Research, a unit that provides independent market research and analysis on legal strategy, operations and technology.\n\nHyperion’s founder and CEO, Eyal Iffergan, will join Epiq as managing director of its new legal operations advisory business.\n\nEpiq launched its legal transformation services group earlier this year as part of its Legal Solutions business, which is led by Roger Pilc, president and general manager.\n\n“We’re thrilled to have Hyperion as part of Epiq as we continue to build out our vision for helping our clients,” Pilc said in a statement provided by the company. “Together, we can scale and extend their transformative work with legal teams globally.”"
