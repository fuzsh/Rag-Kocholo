        "text": "managing director\n\nMarc & I started Brovanture in 2005 after having worked together at the EPM vendor Comshare. A shared recognition that Essbase was far and above the best financial database led us to approach Hyperion to become partners and the rest, as they say, is history.\n\nOver the years we have completed over 80 successful implementation projects including discoverIE, Channel 4 Television, Edrington-Beam Suntory and many others. Our first project remains a valued client and has migrated, with our support, from Oracle Hyperion Planning to the Oracle Cloud EPM Planning, an evolution that we have enthusiastically followed ourselves. We use NetSuite and Oracle Cloud EPM internally.\n\nA background in management and ERP & EPM sales has enabled me to to lead teams to position and implement business change/improvement programmes using software as a facilitator of that change within a range of industries and in different functional areas.\n\nWhen I am not working to exceed the expectations of our clients I can be found playing golf or watching the trials and tribulations of Harlequins rugby.\n\nI would love to hear from you whatever your relationship to Brovanture, or not, click HERE to send me a message.\n\nprofessional services director\n\nWhen we started Brovanture we wanted to improve on the various organisations that we’d come to know. My business life that began at Dimension Data, in Johannesburg in 1997 with Essbase, continued with Comshare where a certain account manager dispatched me to implement in Glasgow within days of arriving and has culminated in over 13 years and many implementations with Brovanture. I lead a group of highly skilled and dedicated consultants – many of whom have been developed within Brovanture as placement students or graduates.\n\nOracle Essbase remains at the core of what we do whether in Oracle Cloud EPM or Oracle Hyperion On-premises. Our Graduates always start with the foundation of Oracle Essbase before moving on to the various products in use.\n\nMy skillset developed over years of Pre-Sales, Implementation and Support engagements remains valid in today’s market as the use of the Cloud becomes the standard in finance.\n\nI remain convinced that the Brovanture teams of technical and functional specialists and skilled accountants presents the best service provision for companies looking for fast economic solutions with the market leading Oracle Cloud software.\n\nWhen I’m not contemplating a multi dimensional cube I can be found in Richmond Park preparing for the next triathlon or on the terraces of The Stoop.\n\nI would love to hear from you whatever your relationship to Brovanture, or not, click HERE to send me a message.\n\nEPM services director\n\nI’ve been working with EPM products since I joined Hyperion in 1999 as an Essbase support consultant. I was invited to join Brovanture in 2014 after working with several consultancies including Infratects, KPMG and Analitica.\n\nMy main areas of focus are on environments, integration and presales. Brovanture provide innovative hosting and support solutions for our on-premises customers and we are experts in delivering smooth and swift upgrade services migrating on-premises applications to the Oracle Cloud EPM and Oracle NetSuite Cloud ERP. However, you never forget your first love and I still get a real kick out of demoing Oracle Cloud EPM Planning and more recently the Oracle Analytics Cloud to our new clients.\n\nWhen I’m not up to my elbows in data you’ll find me running on the fells, swimming in lakes and cycling up hills.\n\nRead my EPM Blog here\n\nI would love to hear from you whatever your relationship to Brovanture, or not, click HERE to send me a message."
