Page 4 of 14 <PAGE> (d) REMEDIES. Termination of this Agreement shall not limit or restrict any of the remedies otherwise available to the parties hereunder or at law. (e) EFFECTS OF TERMINATION. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, all rights and licenses granted to SPSS under this Agreement shall terminate and revert to Hyperion, except that sublicenses of the ShowCase AS/400 Port- granted by SPSS to End Users in accordance with this Agreement as of the date of termination will remain in effect in accordance with their terms and conditions. Upon termination of this Agreement for any reason, SPSS shall (i) immediately return to Hyperion all Hyperion Confidential Information including the Technical Information, catalogues and literature in its possession, custody or control in whichever form held (including all copies or embodiments thereof); (ii) cease using any trademarks, service marks and other designations of Hyperion; (iii) cease issuing new sublicenses of the ShowCase AS/400 Port; (iv) no longer identify or hold itself out as a distributor of the ShowCase AS/400 Port or the Software; and (v) without additional consideration, assign, convey and transfer to Hyperion all right, title and interest in and to the ShowCase AS/400 Port. Notwithstanding the foregoing and provided that the Agreement was not terminated for violations of Hyperion's intellectual property rights, SPSS may, at its discretion, retain a limited use license to use the ShowCase AS/400 Port and related Documentation solely as required to fulfill its contractual duties to support End Users for the remaining duration of the annual term of End User Support agreements existing as of termination of this Agreement, provided that SPSS has paid Hyperion the applicable End User Support Fees. Prior to the end of the then-annual term of such End User Support agreements, SPSS may if it chooses to, at its sole discretion, inform the End User to contact Hyperion to contract directly with Hyperion for such software license and maintenance for the ShowCase AS/400 Port. In addition to the foregoing, upon termination of this Agreement, Hyperion may contact End Users using the End User information provided by SPSS to Hyperion pursuant to Section 5(b) and Section 8 below and arrange for such End Users to terminate their software license and maintenance agreements with SPSS as of the end of the then-annual term and to contract directly with Hyperion for such software license and maintenance for the ShowCase AS/400 Port. 5. FEES AND PAYMENT (a) SUBLICENSE FEES PAYMENT TO HYPERION. For each sublicense of the ShowCase AS/400 Port granted by SPSS, SPSS shall report and pay to Hyperion the applicable Sublicense Fees stated in Exhibit A payable in accordance with Section 5(b) below. Unless otherwise expressly stated in Exhibit A, the applicable Sublicense Fees will be Hyperion's then-current local list price for such Software in effect in the Territory, less the applicable discount specified in Exhibit A for the type of sublicense granted. In the event discount levels are changed, such changes will apply prospectively only and not retroactively. Any prepaid Sublicense Fees paid by SPSS will be credited only against future Sublicense Fees. Hyperion shall have the right to change its price lists at any time, provided that any such change shall be effective under this Agreement upon a minimum of sixty (60) days' written notice to SPSS. (b) REPORTING OF SUBLICENSE FEES AND END USER SUPPORT FEES. Within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar month, SPSS shall provide to Hyperion a written report detailing the information set forth in Exhibit C for all sublicenses of the ShowCase AS/400 Port delivered and first year End User Support sold to End Users by SPSS in the just completed month. Within thirty (30) days following the end of each calendar quarter, SPSS shall provide to Hyperion a written report detailing the information set forth in Exhibit C for all anniversaries of all sublicenses sold (except for those sublicenses for which the End User notifies SPSS that annual maintenance will not be renewed) under this Agreement and the previous License Agreement between the parties hereto dated April 1, 1998 as amended that occurred in the just completed quarter. Such report shall include any credits for incorrectly reported maintenance renewals on the prior quarter's report. (c) HYPERION ROYALTY PAYMENT TO SPSS. Hyperion shall pay SPSS a royalty for each copy of the ShowCase AS/400 Port distributed by Hyperion or its resellers. Such royalty shall be equal to [*] --------------- * Confidential information has been omitted from this sentence and such confidential information has been separately filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Page 5 of 14 <PAGE> percent ([*]%) of SPSS's then-current local list price. The parties agree to negotiate in good faith regarding discounts for large transactions. SPSS agrees to provide Hyperion with sixty (60) days' prior written notice of any change in its list price. Hyperion agrees to pay and report any license sale under this Section 5(c) within thirty (30) days of the quarter in which the license sale occurs. (d) HYPERION eLICENSING REQUIREMENT. During the term of this Agreement, SPSS acknowledges and agrees to support and incorporate Hyperion's eLicensing strategy that will require the ShowCase AS/400 Port to incorporate technology that can enforce software licensing restrictions substantially similar to the technology that Hyperion incorporates in the Software. For avoidance of doubt, if Hyperion subsequently incorporates technology in the Software that can enforce software licensing restrictions at the component level (i.e., beyond the server level), SPSS shall promptly, provided that the parties may mutually agree on an extended period because of any technical or practical issues, support and incorporate such technology in the ShowCase AS/400 Port or other technology developed or licensed by SPSS that can enforce software licensing restrictions at the component level. Failure by SPSS to promptly, provided that the parties may mutually agree on an extended period because of any technical or practical issues, incorporate such additional technology into the ShowCase AS/400 Port shall be deemed a material breach. (e) MAINTENANCE OF BOOKS AND RECORDS. SPSS shall maintain accurate books and records relating to the performance of its obligations under this Agreement for at least three (3) years after expiration or termination of this Agreement. (f) TERMS OF PAYMENT. All fees due under this Agreement are payable and due within thirty (30) days of date of invoice. Late payments will bear interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month (or the maximum rate allowed by law, whichever is lower). In addition, the payor will pay all charges reasonably incurred in the purchase and/or shipment of Software, including transportation charges, insurance premiums, taxes (except taxes based on seller's net income), duties and other government assessments, except to the extent expressly prohibited by law. Payor's obligation to pay the other party shall not be affected by its ability to collect payment from its customers. All fees charged by a party and payable by the other party do not include taxes. The parties agree that all taxes shall be paid in accordance with Section 9 (j) below. (g) AUDIT. Hyperion may at any time, upon five (5) business days' written notice and not more than once in each twelve month period, examine SPSS's books and records related to the amounts due to Hyperion. Such examination may be done by a certified public accounting firm, at Hyperion's expense, provided, however, that if any such audit uncovers one or more underpayments in excess of five percent (5%) of the total amount determined by the audit to be payable to Hyperion for the audited period, SPSS shall immediately reimburse Hyperion for the full costs of such audit and the amount of underpayment uncovered during the course of the audit. 6. MAINTENANCE SUPPORT (a) SUPPORT FOR SPSS'S END USERS. SPSS shall provide First Level Support, Second Level Support and Third Level Support to those customers who have purchased licenses for the ShowCase AS/400 Port from SPSS or its Resellers. Hyperion will provide secondary support in accordance with Exhibit H directly to SPSS (and not to its Resellers or End Users) with respect to all such sales. Hyperion will also provide Software Upgrades to SPSS. For such support, SPSS shall pay Hyperion the End User Support Fees as set forth in Exhibit A. (b) SUPPORT FOR SHOWCASE AS/400 PORT SALES BY HYPERION. Hyperion or its partner can collect or cause to be collected and promptly pay to SPSS an annual maintenance fee equal to 15 percent of the then-current SPSS local list price for the ShowCase AS/400 Port when Hyperion originally licenses the ShowCase AS/400 Port. The End User shall contract directly with SPSS for Support of the ShowCase ------------------- * Confidential information has been omitted from this sentence and such confidential information has been separately filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Page 6 of 14 <PAGE> AS/400 Port, and then SPSS will provide First, Second and Third Level support directly to such End Users. After the first year of maintenance for a customer, SPSS will handle all renewals and will extend its maintenance contract to the customers at SPSS's then current rates. 7. MARKETING ACTIVITIES (a) PUBLICITY. Unless a party is required by law or due to an SEC requirement in such party's reasonable judgment, neither party will issue any public announcement nor publish any materials that reference or discuss the other party or its products without the prior written consent of the other party. Each party grants the other party the right to use the other party's name and logo for marketing purposes. (b) JOINT MARKETING. During the Term of this Agreement, SPSS and Hyperion may mutually agree from time to time to engage in joint marketing activities which promote their products including seminars, press announcements, trade shows, user groups or other events. 8. ESCROW OF SHOWCASE AS/400 PORT AND CURRENT END USER LIST. Promptly after the release of each version of the ShowCase AS/400 Port, SPSS will put into escrow the ShowCase AS/400 Port and all proprietary software, instructions and notes necessary to recreate the development environment. Promptly after the Effective Date of this Agreement, SPSS will put into escrow its current list of End Users. Upon the termination of this Agreement, Hyperion shall be entitled to have access to and use the source code form of the ShowCase AS/400 Port for the purposes set forth in this Agreement and Hyperion shall be entitled to have access to and use the list of End Users. The fees for this escrow arrangement shall be paid by Hyperion and shall not exceed $650 per year. 9. GENERAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS (a) OWNERSHIP OF SOFTWARE.
