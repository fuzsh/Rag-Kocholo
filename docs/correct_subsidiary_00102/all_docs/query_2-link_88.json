        "text": "“We radically changed the professional delivery model by challenging long-held norms and innovating with strategic value-based engagement models.” - Eyal Iffergan\n\nIn the world of business, decisions have a great impact on the performance and competitiveness of companies. The quality of decisions you make, as well as how they are executed, feed directly into value creation, performance levels, and governance standards. While companies’ leadership teams are ultimately responsible for making business decisions, many understand the limits of their own experience and enrich those important capability gaps with trusted, credible advisors who assist them to identify, analyze and manage the challenges of their business and support them to execute against strategic goals and objectives.\n\nWe are pleased to present Hyperion Global Partners – a business and technology consulting practice to the legal profession. The company brings a fresh approach to collaborating with clients on technology and business management issues.\n\nHyperion Global offers advisory services to AmLaw 200 law firms and Global 1000 corporations to make intelligent, fact-based decisions about how to improve their operational performance.\n\nThe company was founded in 2009 and is headquartered in Sugar Land, Texas.\n\nInterview Excerpt: Eyal Iffergan, President/CEO\n\nWhy was the company set up? And how did you expand your company and its offerings over the years?\n\nIn founding Hyperion, we set out to create a new model consulting practice that challenged all of the conventional wisdom of the industry. We innovated in who we hired, the services we offered, the way we delivered those services, and how we charged for them. In many ways, we became the ‘anti-consultancy.’\n\nWe are focused on transformation. While all the other consulting companies in our industry focus on very tactical work – to install a new technology or document processes, etc. – we provide a more holistic approach to operations and information management, leading our clients through broad-based transformation programs that serve to dramatically change the way they work and the results they achieve.\n\nWhat kind of responses have you received from your consumers over the years? How have they motivated you to shape your offerings/grow the company?\n\nOur innovation has borne many fruits. We not only challenged the status quo, but we have created an entirely new market in doing so – one we defined and lead. We are widely acclaimed in the marketplace for our innovative approach and have established a presence of immense influence: we advise and guide all stakeholders in the market – buyers, solution providers and investors – and are widely acknowledged as the leaders in the legal solutions market.\n\nAbout adaptability, how do you stay relevant to the consumer interests and needs in this highly volatile market?\n\nAt Hyperion, we are focused on helping our clients maximize return on their existing investments, and to make smart, considered decisions about executing process and technology improvement initiatives that produce measurable value. The consultants that stand behind the Hyperion Global Partners name represent the legal industry’s most experienced technology and business thought leaders in their respective practices. Hyperion Global Partner’s experts have worked with the largest international law practices, Fortune 500 corporations, andpublic sector agencies.\n\nWe constantly work to translate our expertise in new and innovative ways and deliver solutions that are consistently ahead of the curve. Hyperion clients hire us for our expertise but retain us to help lead, improve and transform their organizations, and we aim to continue offering these vital services moving forward to ensure continued success for both ourselves and the clients we serve.\n\nIf you have to list four factors that have been/are the biggest asset to your organization, what would they be and why?\n\nOur model is simple: we focus only on the areas that we know better than anyone else.\n\nWe don’t charge by time. We believe that time is the least valuable way to measure the value we deliver. Our entire model is focused on harnessing the expertise of our team to deliver tangible, actionable, compelling solutions to our clients and to innovate in the way we deliver those solutions.\n\nWe have assembled a team of the best and brightest in the industry to bring unparalleled expertise, with a healthy dose of pragmatism, to help our clients align and execute their strategic business objectives.\n\nWe are not opportunists. We focus only on the areas we know better than anyone else, and our clients hire us precisely because we are the best at what we do.\n\nWe radically changed the professional delivery model to challenge highly linear revenue model predicated on supplying people to perform tasks at an hourly rate. We pioneered the scalable professional service.\n\nWhat do you feel are the reasons behind your company’s reputation?\n\nOur philosophy is to always provide pragmatic, actionable and specific advice and counsel. When it comes to best practices, we have generally developed them. We don’t do nebulous ‘Findings Reports;’ our proprietary PracticeView™ Assessments will address specific issues with specific courses of action. We have worked closely with all of the leading practice management technologies, and our consultants have developed proven and honed implementation methodologies. All of our consultants enjoy a prominent career distinction – our projects always come in on time and on budget.\n\nHyperion Research, a division of Hyperion Global Partners, is the legal industry’s only independent and objective analyst-based research and advisory team. Hyperion research is led and managed by a multi-dimensional team of legal solution experts with extensive career experience as attorneys, technologists, MBA’s, Ph.D.’s, software executives, and legal operations managers. Their broad range of in-depth insight, reflected in Hyperion’s expansive and rigorous Research Agendas, garners the respect of all stakeholders in the legal technology ecosystem.\n\nThe annual Hyperion Global Partners MarketView™ report is recognized as the definitive guide to legal technology, providing analysis of the legal solution market and demonstrating its excellence in research and thought leadership. The report provides in-depth analysis of key segments, including solution definitions, solution provider landscape, and market sizing and adoption scenarios.\n\nIn addition to the well-respected MarketView™ report, Hyperion Global Partners is widely known for its TrendView™ reports. This intelligence provides unparalleled insight into the leading trends in legal strategy, operations, and technology and focuses on the latest trends, issues and solutions in the legal market. Working with clients, solution providers, ongoing benchmarking research and surveys, and market pundits, TrendView™ reports publish thoughtful and analytic legal market intelligence, on topics including: Enterprise Legal Management, Global E-Billing, Intellectual Property Management, Contract Management, Workflow and Automation, Enterprise Content Management, Information Governance, Risk Management, and Performance Metrics and KPIs.\n\nLast but not the least, we want to know: why did you choose to name your firm Hyperion?\n\nAccording to Greek mythology, Hyperion was one of the twelve Titans of Ancient Greece. It is said that he was the first to understand, by diligent observation and analysis, the movement of the sun and the moon and the other stars, and the consequent changing of the seasons. So in essence, as he helped mankind to understand the nature of the world around them, we can ascribe him the honor of being the first consultant.\n\nWe also borrow loftier meaning from Hyperion. He was the Titan of Light, and as a consultancy deeply committed to the interests and success of our clients, we understand that our value is to illuminate.\n\nThe Man Behind The Operation: A Brief Background\n\nEyal Iffergan: As President and CEO of Hyperion Global Partners, Eyal Iffergan leads the premier global consultancy for legal business strategy and operations. He is recognized industry-wide for his expertise in implementing dynamic business strategies and systems that align legal operations with business objectives.\n\nWith over 20 years of leadership in advising the legal and intellectual property business communities, Mr. Iffergan brings broad-based legal process and technology experience to managing influential global practices and companies, including founding and building several market-revolutionizing enterprises. His extensive experience includes legal technology transformation for Intellectual Property Management, Information Strategy, Workflow and Process Automation, Practice Operations, Risk Portfolio Management, Performance Management and Global E-Billing.\n\nPrior to founding Hyperion, Mr. Iffergan was a Principal at Baker Robbins & Company. It was the industry’s leading and largest technology consulting company of that era, and Mr. Iffergan led it until its acquisition. He was a founder and chief architect of Clearspire, a groundbreaking two-company law firm/legal service entity regarded as a pioneer in legal delivery system evolution.
