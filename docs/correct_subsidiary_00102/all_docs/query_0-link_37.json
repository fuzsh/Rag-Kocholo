        "text": "Three years, 30 deals, well over $20 billion spent.\n\nOracle’s $3.3 billion acquisition of Santa Clara software maker Hyperion Solutions, announced Thursday, is the latest deal in one of the most ambitious shopping sprees in Silicon Valley history.\n\nYet many of those deals were for start-ups with innovative technologies or specialists in software for specific industries, such as retailing.\n\nIn buying Hyperion for $52 a share in cash, Redwood City-based Oracle is planting a big stake in one of the software world’s fastest-growing markets: business intelligence.\n\nThe purchase, which helps Oracle fill a lucrative hole in its product line, continues Oracle’s bid to broaden beyond the mature database software business into the market for application software that helps run businesses.\n\n“This is a continuation of a very successful plan to create the most comprehensive and open enterprise software `stack’ in the industry,” Oracle President Charles Phillips told financial analysts during a conference call Thursday morning. “Normally, we buy category leaders, and this is no exception.”\n\nBusiness intelligence, or BI in industry parlance, is a decade-old term describing software that harvests numbers and information from companies’ day-to-day operations to help executives understand what’s happening inside their business.\n\n“Business intelligence is all about how you bridge the gap between the raw data and the business guy,” said Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry.\n\nThe market for BI software is expected to grow 10 percent this year, to $13.9 billion, according to research firm IDC.\n\nAs the market has matured, so has debate over what the words mean.\n\nDuring the past several years, Hyperion Chief Executive Godfrey Sullivan had begun calling his business a “performance management company,” providing software that helps executives make decisions based on that business intelligence and analysis.\n\nOther companies, including Hyperion’s archrival, Business Objects, co-headquartered in Paris and San Jose, say performance management is just a part of business intelligence.\n\nHyperion, which IDC says accounts for 5.2 percent of the business-intelligence market, has 12,000 customers worldwide, including 91 of the 100 largest U.S. corporations. Oracle now sells about 4.5 percent of all BI software bought in the United States.\n\nBI software lets companies get a view into their business from underlying data.\n\nIn one example, from Business Objects, a European theme-park operator used BI software to monitor every visitor passing through its turnstiles. Park managers could then instantly compare current data with historical data, helping them figure out whether and when and where to send more food vendors or cleaning crews.\n\nOracle already offers its own business-intelligence software, much of it acquired along with Siebel Systems two years ago, as well as similar software acquired through its purchase of PeopleSoft.\n\nThe Hyperion acquisition is in line with Oracle’s strategy during the past several years: Buy companies for their technology and customers, then do the hard work of stitching the acquired technology together into a broad “suite” of applications.\n\n“Oracle has shown over the past three or four years that internally they are unable to innovate. The only way they can show growth is to acquire,” said Mayiz Habbal, managing director of securities and investments at Celent, a Boston financial research and consulting firm, and an executive at Siebel when Oracle bought it.\n\nSAP, the German company that is No. 1 in applications software, has a completely different strategy, creating most of its new software in-house.\n\n“We don’t believe buying a big player that causes a huge disruption in our core investment areas that customers already made is a win for our customers. Oracle does,” said Doug Merritt, an executive vice president who manages SAP’s BI technology.\n\nAfter acquiring Hyperion, Oracle is likely to face serious competition in business intelligence software from Business Objects, innovative start-ups, and major technology companies like SAP, Microsoft, IBM and even Hewlett-Packard, which is rumored to be interested in acquiring its way into the BI market. And Oracle will need to deal with the risks of losing Hyperion and Oracle customers that are unsure whether to switch to the other company’s software.\n\n“`Clearly, there is an overlap in products between Oracle and Hyperion,” said Keith Giles, senior adviser to the chief strategy officer at Business Objects. “`There will be huge confusion out in the marketplace.”\n\nOracle shares rose 34 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $16.77 Thursday, while Hyperion’s rose $8.78, or 20.4 percent, to $51.57, just below Oracle’s $52-a-share offer."
