Remember the Tarantella: legal papers, 1984-92\n\nThe bulk of the papers for Remember the Tarantella relate to legal action taken by Finola Moorhead against Brennan. In 1988 Brennan had an offer for the UK rights to the book from the Women's Press UK. Women's Press UK refused to sign the contract until Brennan agreed to remove his 'Publisher's Note' which appeared as a forward in the Australian publication. It had a policy of not including material written by men in its publications. Brennan refused to agree to the change, claiming sexual discrimination. As a result, Moorhead took legal action against him for financial loss and damage to her reputation. Protracted legal proceedings ensued, with the matter finally being resolved in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1991. Brennan lost the case and costs were awarded against him.\n\nThis series comprises a large number of papers accumulated by Brennan while preparing his defence. They include correspondence with solicitors and publishers, approaches to people for their expert advice, applications for legal aid and research material on legal rights from various sources. There are also copies of legal documents lodged with the Supreme Court of New South Wales. They include affidavits, summonses, notices of motion, subpoenas, notices of appearance, cross examinations, discoveries and a copy of the final judgment by Justice John Brennan.\n\nIn 1990, Brennan lodged a complaint with the Human Rights Commission on the grounds of sexual discrimination. It was unable to assist Brennan in the matter because the Women's Press UK was a foreign corporation and did not come under Australian jurisdiction.\n\nCorrespondence between Brennan and Moorhead, 1984-91 (File 1)\n\nCorrespondence between Brennan and Moorhead's solicitors, Communications Law Centre, 1989-92 (File 2_3)\n\nCorrespondence between Brennan and two firms of solicitors: Watsons (1989) and John Sarroff and Company (1989-90) (File 4)\n\nCorrespondence between Brennan and the publishing companies The Women's Press, Van Gennep and Van Splunteren, 1984-91 (File 5)\n\nCorrespondence between Brennan and Elizabeth Fullerton, and Brennan and the Australian Society of Authors, 1987-90 (File 6)\n\nCopies of documents from Moorhead, obtained under discovery, 1988-89 (File 7)\n\nCopies of legal documents lodged with the Supreme Court of New South Wales, 1990-91 (File 8_10)\n\nBrennan's notes relating the cross-examination of Moorhead (File 11)\n\nCorrespondence and copies of legal documents relating to the settlement of the case, including a copy of the final judgment, 1991-1992 (File 12_13)\n\nMiscellaneous notes relating to the case (File 14)\n\nPapers relating to Brennan's application for Legal Aid, 1990-1991 (File 15)\n\nBrennan's notes on the chronology of events relating to the case (File 16_17)\n\nMaterial relating to Brennan's background research for the case (File 18_19)\n\nIncluded are journal articles, booklets, pamphlets from Human Rights Australia and the Australian Commercial Disputes Centre, and a discussion paper on 'Moral rights' from the Copyright Law Review Committee.\n\nCorrespondence between Brennan and the Australia Council regarding a 'Freedom of Information' request for documents, and between Brennan and Human Rights Australia regarding his allegation against Moorhead of sexual discrimination,, 1990 (File 20)\n\nCorrespondence between Brennan and The Article 19 Bulletin, and between Brennan and Laurie Miller from the University of Queensland Press seeking advice relating to the case, 1990-1992 (File 21)\n\nNewspaper clippings and journal articles relating to the outcomes of the case, 1991 (File 22)\n\nSeries 12. Remember the Tarantella: miscellaneous papers\n\nThis series comprises a small collection of miscellaneous material, most of which does not relate directly to the book. Included are a copy of the published version of Remember the Tarantella, a copy of a book by Moorhead entitled A handwritten modern classic and published by Sybylla Co-operative in 1977, a framed acrylic painting inscribed 'Merry Christmas Paul and Christine, love Finola, 1986' and a white painted shirt. Also included is a letter of complaint from Brennan to Carolyn Gerrish (1991) from the Sydney Community College regarding derogatory comments about Primavera Press which she allegedly made to students during the teaching of her course in Creative Writing, and correspondence between Brennan and the Australian Journalists' Association (1991) regarding a complaint he made against Jennie Curtin, a journalist with The Sydney Morning Herald.\n\n2 folders\n\nSeries 13.

Grant Watson (1885-1970), edited by Dorothy Green. The book resulted from approaches Brennan made to both Josephine Spence, the daughter of Grant Watson, and the literary historian Dorothy Green. For a number of years Green had been working on a biography of Grant Watson and she wrote a biographical introduction to the book. A scientific introduction was written by Dr E.J. (Ted) Steele of the Department of Biology, University of Wollongong. The book was launched in February 1990 at the National Museum of Australia in Canberra by Barry Jones, Minister for Science.\n\nDuring the course of publishing the book, Brennan established a close working relationship with Josephine Spence.

Primavera Press also sold the film rights to the book to Illumination Films who produced the film version of the book, which was released in 1993.

This book was originally published by Cresset Press in 1940. Contractual disputes between Brennan and Josephine Spence soured their relationship and led to the termination of the contract before the book was published. At this time Brennan completely severed their relationship, and returned all rights to E.L. Grant Watson's works to Spence.\n\nThe re-release of the book had been timed to coincide with the release of the film version of the book entitled Exile, which was produced by Paul Cox of Illumination Films. The film was subsequently released, but not in Australia.\n\nThis series comprises correspondence and papers relating to the re-release of Priest Island and the film version of the book. The correspondence between Brennan and Josephine Spence documents the gradual decline of their relationship as a result of the contractual disputes. Other correspondents include Paul Cox, Floris Books (Edinburgh), Hope Kynoch, Don Lowe, and William Marshall (Marshall and Dent, solicitors). The papers include legal documents, several pages of proofs of the book, a photocopy of the original version of the book, reviews of the film and a copy of the film script.\n\nIncluded with the papers, but not related to the book, is a copy of a letter from the author Kathleen Raine (1979) to Dorothy Green setting out her recollections of E.L. Grant Watson.\n\nCorrespondence with Josephine Spence, 1992-94 (File 1)\n\nGeneral correspondence, 1992-94 (File 2)\n\nCorrespondence with Marshall and Dent (solicitors for Spence) and Paul Cox, mainly relating to the contractual dispute, 1991-1993 (File 3)\n\nProofs of the book (1993), photocopy of the original version of the book and letter from Kathleen Raine to Dorothy Green (1979) (File 4)\n\nTypescript of the 'Afterword' for the book, written by Hope Kynoch, 1994 (File 5)\n\nLegal papers relating to the literary and film rights for the book, 1989-92 (File 6)\n\nScript of Exile and copies of reviews of the film, 1994 (File 7)"
