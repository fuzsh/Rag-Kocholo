        "text": "Article content\n\nManitoba Film is expecting a $435 million year, a new record and double what was spent in the province last year which was impacted by a couple strikes in Hollywood. One of the top-tier movies that’s being filmed right now in and around Winnipeg is Nobody 2. Bob Odenkirk, Connie Nielson and Christopher Lloyd are all back for the sequel, as well as Sharon Stone who’s been added this time around as the new villain. I loved the first Nobody! Especially all the shots of Winnipeg. Critics and audiences really enjoyed it too, according to Rotten Tomatoes. The critics gave it 83%, while audiences scored it 94%. Let’s hope the new Nobody! is just as good when it’s released next year. And while we’re talking about films shot locally, Kyle Irving at Eagle Vision hopes you check out Deaner ’89 when it arrives in theatres early next month. Hard-luck metalhead Dean Murdoch, played by Paul Spence, reveals how he finally made it by taking us back to the 1980s, my favourite decade. Based on the trailer, it looks like the movie will be a blast.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive columns by Ryan Stelter, Paul Friesen, Ted Wyman, Scott Billeck, Lorrie Goldstein, Warren Kinsella and others.

Since closing his store in Stonewall just a year ago, he’s acquired enough antiques and collectables to fill 10 stores. He’ll even have movie props. I’ve obtained most of my good stuff through George so if you’re looking, he’s selling, and it’s all gotta go. Just follow the signs on Highways 8 or 9 north of Gimli to Spruce Bay Road. I hope to see you there. I’ll even be selling some of my treasures.\n\nTAKE ROOT FESTIVAL\n\nOn the other side of Lake Winnipeg, the Take Root Festival will be happening this weekend at Cityfolk Farm near Thalberg. Organizers say it’s a fun farm experience to learn skills rooted in community and nature. Over 30 workshops and demonstrations will teach a wide variety of skills that your great-grandparents were probably good at. Like how to forage for mushrooms and herbs and how to make your own all-natural soap. If it’s anything like Homestead Rescue on TV with the Raney family, it should be a great event. There’s lots more information at TakeRootFest.ca.\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nSHOPPING FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES\n\nI’m told many parents have started shopping for back-to-school supplies. And in some stores, believe it or not, they’re in short supply already. Deloitte says moms and dads are spending less this year ($586 per child, compared to $597 last year) but that doesn’t mean they’re spending less time on the task. In fact, parents are doing whatever they can to get what their kids need for school at the best possible price. One survey I saw said 5% of them would even consider dumpster diving.\n\nSNOOP DOGG EFFECT\n\nThe Paris Olympics are a big hit. It’s set a new streaming record, 17 billion minutes viewed so far. That’s more than all the previous Olympic Games combined. For me, the addition of Snoop Dogg has been genius. “Snoop has done everything and beyond what we ever expected him to do,” according to Rick Cordella, president of NBC Sports. I don’t know about you but I’ll also be tuning in to the closing ceremony on Sunday to see the big Tom Cruise stunt everyone is talking about.\n\n— Hal has written columns for years.
