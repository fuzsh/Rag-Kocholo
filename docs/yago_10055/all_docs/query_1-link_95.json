        "text": "June 30 – September 14, 2024\n\nLowell Davies Festival Theatre\n\nWorld premiere adaptation By William Shakespeare\n\nAdapted and directed by Barry Edelstein\n\nA once-in-a-generation event comes to San Diego in 2024: The Old Globe becomes one of only a small handful of theatres in the country’s history to complete Shakespeare’s canon with the two-part Henry 6, the largest Shakespeare production the Globe has ever presented.\n\nIn One: Flowers and France, King Henry VI inherits the crown of England as a child. Absent the strong leadership of his father, who conquered France in a surprise victory, the English court is reduced to petty squabbles. The French take up arms to regain their lost territory and rally behind Joan of Arc, who claims she was sent from God to fight the English. And when King Henry marries Queen Margaret, she inflames the political disputes that roil the throne. Can the English stop arguing among themselves and unite to hold on to France? Or will their in-fighting cost them the hard-won French territory and lead to chaos at home?\n\nAcclaimed Shakespeare director and the Globe’s Erna Finci Viterbi Artistic Director Barry Edelstein turns the rarely produced Henry VI, Parts I, II, and III into a thrilling two-part event, running simultaneously through the summer in our beautiful outdoor theatre. These adaptations include everything people love about the Bard—ingenious language, vibrant characters, breathtaking battles, and sweeping crowd scenes—as they explore the impact of national politics on individual lives. And the action is framed by a design team working at the very top of their craft, and a sprawling cast of professional actors and local community members.\n\nThe Old Globe is celebrating this historic milestone with a yearlong program of citywide arts engagement and humanities events that bring audiences closer to the art than ever before, including opportunities for San Diegans to participate in the making of the production itself. It is an event that simply cannot be missed!\n\nThis production includes violence and the use of theatrical haze.\n\nTotal running time: Two hours and 50 minutes (two acts with one intermission).\n\nDigital Program\n\nDownload the Program PDF\n\nmore info\n\nVicki and Carl Zeiger Insights Seminar: Tuesday, July 16 at 7:00 p.m.\n\nPost Show Forum: Wednesday, July 24; Wednesday, August 7; and Tuesday, August 20.\n\nHenry 6 is made possible by a generous grant from The Roy Cockrum Foundation.\n\nHenry 6 is supported by lead production sponsors Kathryn Hattox Charitable Trust; Jeannie Polinsky Rivkin Artistic Fund; Jean and Gary Shekhter; Darlene Marcos Shiley, in memory of Donald Shiley; The Erna Finci Viterbi Artistic Director Fund; production sponsors Hal and Pam Fuson, Vicki and Carl Zeiger; and artist sponsors Richard and Jennifer Greenfield (for costume designer David Israel Reynoso) and Deborah A. and David A. Hawkins (for scenic designer Lawrence E. Moten III).\n\nThis project was made possible with support from California Humanities, a partner of the NEH.

Dr. Jeff Wilson will give an inside look at how George R.R. Martin took all of that and more from the historical Wars of the Roses—the same events that inspired Shakespeare’s Henry 6. Come see how your favorite characters from the acclaimed TV show appear in a different form on the Globe stage this summer!\n\nBarry Edelstein In Conversation with Dr. James Shapiro, supported by the Fuson Family | August 31\n\nTwo of the greatest minds in American Shakespeare come together to discuss Henry 6. Globe audiences have thrilled at Shapiro’s previous visits to the Globe, and he returns for one night only to dive into this summer’s epic production. Edelstein and Shapiro will also talk about Shapiro’s latest book, The Playbook: A Story of Theater, Democracy, and the Making of a Culture War, and about how Shakespeare continues to shape American culture today.\n\nShakespeare and Disability: Discussing Disability Representation in Shakespeare’s Plays | September 7\n\nCurious about how the character of Richard III is addressed in modern performances? Have you ever wondered what an Elizabethan mobility aid looks like? Join acclaimed scholar Dr. Katherine Williams for a discussion about disability representation in Shakespeare’s plays, both in the Renaissance and onstage today.\n\nPast Events Include:\n\nDr. Sonia Desai, Literary Associate at The Old Globe and Shakespeare scholar\n\nCarla Steen, Resident dramaturg of the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis"
