        "text": "A heroic leading man who has vaulted to international stardom as the star of the syndicated TV series \"The Highlander\" (1992-98), the darkly handsome Adrian Paul has been able to use his background as a dancer and choreographer in the role of Duncan MacLeod, a 16th Century Scottish warrior battling evil in the modern world. A native of London, Paul played semi-pro soccer and modeled throughout Europe before returning to native city where he worked as a choreographer and dancer for six years. Aptly, his first real notice came when he was cast as a dancer/actor in the London musical \"The Break.\" Following the success of the show, Paul decided to head to Hollywood, where from 1986-1987 he played Nikolai 'Kolya' Rostov, a temperamental Russian dancer on the \"Dynasty\" spin-off \"The Colbys\" (ABC). Despite the specific nature of the role, he avoided typecasting. In 1988, he played a photographer in Vietnam in \"Shooter\" (NBC). Paul moved into the realm of action hero playing John Kincaid, a former soldier battling aliens, on the syndicated series \"War of the Worlds\" (1989-1990). After playing the interviewer of Santa Claus in the frothy \"In the Nick of Time\" (NBC, 1991), he lent his romantic presence to the period primetime remake of the cult soap opera \"Dark Shadows\" (NBC, 1991). In some ways, that role was a warm-up for what has become his signature portrayal, \"The Highlander.\""
