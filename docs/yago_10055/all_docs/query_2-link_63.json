        "text": "By Seymour I. \"Spence\" Toll\n\nDuring nearly 60 years as a lawyer, I never yearned to be a movie actor. What lawyers do in court made cinema acting seem like fluff. Nevertheless, my dear wife, Jean, and I worked on a Warner Bros. film in 1998.\n\nThe setting was the coastal village of Popham, Maine, near where our family has a vacation home. Recalling that experience invites comparisons between performing in court and on a movie set.\n\nWhen our family arrived in Popham in June 1998, we knew a Hollywood film company was on location shooting much of a film titled Message in a Bottle, starring Kevin Costner, Robin Wright, and Paul Newman. About 150 studio employees, tractor-trailers, trucks, and vans were seen throughout the village, especially around Spinney's restaurant and Percy's general store.\n\nServing as a mess hall near Percy's was a yellow-and-white-striped tent with folding tables at which about a dozen extras were sipping Styrofoam cups of coffee and looking bored as they waited to be called for their scenes. We strolled into the tent, and adventuresome Jean quickly learned how to apply for a job as an extra.\n\nOne phone call to \"central casting\" later, and we both had acting jobs. We were told to show up in our 1996 Subaru station wagon at 7:45 the next morning, dressed for summer weather - walking shorts, short-sleeve sport shirts, sneakers or sandals, and no clothing with any red, white, or blue logos. Even though the next morning was very cold, I respected such costuming. As a trial lawyer, I know that how one dresses can influence the audience (or jury).\n\nOur movie, set in the 1990s, was adapted from Nicholas Sparks' novel of the same name. Costner played Garret, a bereaved widower in North Carolina who builds boats and has a father named Dodge, who was played by Paul Newman. While grieving for his deceased wife, Garret writes her a letter that he puts in a bottle and sends out to sea. It reaches a distant beach where Theresa, a divorced Chicago journalist played by Robin Wright, finds it. Beginning their ill-fated romance, she tracks him down in North Carolina.\n\nAfter their first meeting, Costner has Newman drive him to an airport shuttle van, which will take him to a Chicago flight so he can see Theresa again. Newman pulls into a North Carolina parking lot, which was played by a Maine parking lot. This revision of reality didn't jolt me; it's similar to what phony evidence in a trial does to reality.\n\nThe parking lot was the setting for our scene. The two stars are sitting in the cab of Newman's pickup truck. They're parked next to the road on which four cars pass by. Jean looks relaxed driving one of them. It's our Subaru, with North Carolina license plates covering our Pennsylvania ones. There were several retakes, and she was on camera in each, but her scene was cut from the movie's final version.\n\nAlthough my scene was brief, it proves that if you can make a living trying cases, you can handle acting for Hollywood.\n\nCarrying a duffel bag, Costner steps from the truck. When he gets halfway to the van, Newman yells that he forgot his flight tickets. Costner retrieves them and walks to the van, where the driver shows him his seat behind the driver's.\n\nAfter waiting all day, I finally learned that my role was to be Costner's fellow passenger in the van. I hadn't seen the script, but was confident I could wing it. (After all, trial lawyers are trained to be quick reads.) My lines were no problem. I had none.\n\nNow the on-screen challenge was to communicate silently with Costner through facial expressions. In Hollywood, that's routine; in a courtroom, it's a no-no. That's how an \"unclean\" lawyer tries to influence a jury, as his unaware opponent makes a closing argument.\n\nI figured I would be on camera when I stepped into the van, with Costner following me, and then again when he settled into his second-row seat because I would be directly behind him. Alas, my third-row seat went to another extra, and I was sent to the rear. Although I wasn't to be on camera with Costner, sometimes all is not lost in even the toughest trials. I thought that was the case here too.\n\nUntil I saw the actual movie.\n\nI was sure I would be on screen, both my profile (the Hollywood one) and facial expressions appearing through the van's large side window to my right. I didn't realize that, from the outdoors, the window's heavy tint made it look like a blue-green mirror through which the camera could photograph no one. Including me.\n\nThus, in my one fleeting moment on screen, to the audience I'm nothing but a dark blob. This acting assignment was like trying a case in which I'm the only one in the courtroom who knows how I look and sound.\n\nAlthough returning to trial in the next case is always a fresh chance to show my stuff, I didn't want a second shot at movie-making. In my only film role, I wasn't in the movie I was in. Rather than risk that again, I was done with Hollywood. I would stick to practicing law. In that setting, I knew there was one thing my courtroom audience would never be denied. Me."
