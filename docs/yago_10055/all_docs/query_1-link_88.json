        "text": "“What if we took somebody, a headbanger from Alberta and sort of threw him into that world of the internet for the first time. How would he use it? How would he harness it?”\n\nThat’s what Canadian director Michael Dowse thought when he reunited FUBAR‘s Terry and Dean for a new eight-episode series on VICELAND.\n\nFUBAR was a small film about two headbangers in Alberta, filmed on a little digital camera, with a budget that left everyone on the cast broke. But Terry and Deaner’s legendary antics shot the film up to cult acclaim, inspiring a generation of hosers to continue shotgunning Pilsners. With two successful films under their belt, Dowse reunited with actors David Lawrence and Paul Spence, who are reprising their roles as Terry and Dean. The new series, FUBAR: Age of Computer will still feature Terry and Dean’s classic antics, but now with the internet.\n\n“It was a good way to not only show what’s interesting out there but to also mock the internet and really blur the lines between reality and fiction,” said Dowse.\n\nVICE caught up with Terry and Dean to find out about their escape from Fort McMurray, Terry’s thriving internet drone marijuana business and Dean’s new “sex odyssey” record.\n\nVideos by VICE\n\nVICE: How’s it going?\n\nTerry: Alright, not too bad.\n\nSo we haven’t seen you for a long time, seven years, what have you been doing?\n\nTerry: Oh, we were working up on the pipelines up in Fort McMurray there. You know, pretty much just givin’er, you know—\n\nDean: Big fucking fire, and now we’re back—\n\nTerry: Yeah, we had to flee, we had to flee there so we ain’t really employed right now. And my buddy, my cousin buddy is like “you guys can crash here for a while.” He was recording a record, and I’m like I got a few things cooking on the internet. I finally figured out how to like click it and you know.\n\nYeah, you’ve discovered the internet?\n\nTerry: A little bit, yeah.\n\nWhat are you doing on it?\n\nTerry: Oh you know like watching funny videos.\n\nDean: Yeah there’s like one with fish.\n\nTerry: Yeah like this dolphin, oh it’s really gross. Sometimes you watch it over and over.\n\nDean: Yeah, like, that’s normal now! The first time you see it you’re like “you shouldn’t stick that in a blowhole,” now you’re like, “oh that’s hilarious.”\n\nAre you on Tinder?\n\nUh no, ’cause I don’t have a smartphone. And so there’s some stuff that I’m learning, like you can’t do it just on—I have a 486 computer. Yeah it’s that one, it’s 46. Sometimes it’s a bit slow but I’m getting it. We have our internet provided by Pentatron internet service provider, and it’s slow.\n\nSo this is your computer?\n\nYeah, right here you got my computer there, on here there’s all sorts off—this is where I can call people on Skype. I got email. See this is my homepage. It’s actually Shank’s computer, my neighbour, my landlord guy. Yeah I have all sorts of different things going on—”Airijuana”\n\nYour company?\n\nTerry: Yes, my marijuana delivery company. This is the headquarters, this is where it’s all coming from. This is where I’m learning to run businesses off the computer. Yeah and I’m just getting my fingers wet so to speak.\n\nCool. So you’re still drinking Pilsner?\n\nTerry: Yeah, It’s the—you know I don’t know if I’m allowed to say this, it’s actually a beer that they use real German hops to make the Pilsner like they used to. In most pilsners they just use hops that aren’t made in Germany but Pilsner hops are actually from Germany.\n\nHave you tried other beers?\n\nTerry: Oh yeah, I’ve had a few other but this is like—every time I go in and there are so many, I think about it, I spend like days there and I always end up going with the old favourite.\n\nI guess you’re pretty used to drinking a lot of beer huh?\n\nTerry: Yeah, yeah slow and steady you know. I know if I’ve had too much, I know it’s like “Terry take five or you’re going to not be able to work the next day” so you know.\n\nTerry: So I’m growing some pot here. This is sort of some of the product you might expect to find in—what I’m going to be delivering through Air-ijuana. Now, this is just a little one, this is Betsy, she’s coming along real good.\n\nThis is Betsy?\n\nTerry: Yeah, that’s the one plant there, she’s smaller. And this one’s sprouted up and I don’t even think it’s dope, I think it’s like cabbage or something.\n\nYeah, it looks like it.\n\nTerry: So I could also deliver cabbage or whatever, like this is just the start. I also have another invention called the beer bot. I can’t show it to you right now, it’s kind of top secret but it’s like a backpack that will give you an extra arm. And like, when you’re partying, it’ll just like sip your beer for you and then your other hand’s free to smoke and this hand’s free to tell stories with or high-fives.\n\nSo like a beer robot?\n\nTerry: Yeah, right on, like an extra. That’s not public yet, so keep that on the low down. You’d be surprised how many people wished they’d had a third arm.\n\nHow’s the band?\n\nDean: Tour’s going deadly man, yeah my album’s coming out soon. 3069 Space Rock Sex Odyssey. It’s really, really good. It’s really good, it’s fucking, it’s really deadly man. It’s this whole odyssey, it starts off with me as a survivor, kind of what like happened in Fort Mac. Anyways, after that it goes into me facing off with myself, like I’m a dragon and I have a dragon’s face and I have to enter the dragon’s lair. It’s really intense man. It’s going to come with a whole full album and every song’s going to have a painting with it.\n\nThis is a nice place, it’s need some cleaning though.\n\nTerry: To each their own, do you play instruments?\n\nYeah I do.\n\nTerry: Yeah, sometimes having a messy space and the right vibe, it gets captured in the recordings. If it’s too clean and sterile then the music might be that way. You know you got to be free down here. You could jam here with Deaner maybe, what do you play?\n\nThe saxophone.\n\nTerry: Oh I don’t think so, that’s not really an instrument. Not really.\n\nWhy? It’s not rock enough?\n\nTerry: No, it’s like a bird."
