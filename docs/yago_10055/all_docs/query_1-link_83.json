        "text": "“Aftersun” (2022)\n\n“Aftersun” earned Mescal his first Oscar nomination playing a depressed single father looking to craft the perfect vacation for his young daughter (Frankie Coiro). Writer-director Charlotte Wells drew on her personal relationship with her late father to craft the drama which topped critics’ lists of “Best of 2022” films.\n\n“It’s my favorite kind of acting — acting that requires some sort of psychological or physical change,” Mescal told IndieWire. “I don’t want people to get comfortable with the choices that I make. And that doesn’t have to be necessarily broad, sweeping surprising things…​​I love a blockbuster as much as the next person, but my only point is that we have to be careful about just leaving a bit more space for films like ‘Aftersun’ to break out. It’s a step in the right direction with filmmakers, and a film that I’m really proud of that is resonating with people.”\n\n“Carmen”\n\nMescal leads “Carmen,” helmed by Benjamin Millepied of “Black Swan” choreography fame. The film debuted at 2022 TIFF and is set to open from Sony Pictures Classics in select markets April 21, 2023, followed by a national release in May 2023.\n\n“The Revenant” scribe Alexander Dinelaris, “Girl, Interrupted” writer Lisa Loomer, and Loïc Barrere collaborated on the script. Melissa Barrera is set to play the titular character, with Elsa Pataky and Rossy de Palma also starring. Emmy-winning composer Nicholas Britell (“Succession”) is behind the score.\n\nThe official synopsis reads: “Carmen” follows a young and fiercely independent woman who is forced to flee her home in the Mexican desert following the brutal murder of her mother, another strong and mysterious woman. Carmen (Barrera) survives a terrifying and dangerous illegal border crossing into the US, only to be confronted by a lawless volunteer border guard who cold-bloodedly murders two other immigrants in her group. When the border guard and his patrol partner, Aidan (Mescal) — a Marine with PTSD — become embroiled in a deadly standoff, Carmen and Aidan are forced to escape together. They make their way north toward Los Angeles in search of Carmen’s mother’s best friend, the mercurial Masilda (De Palma) and owner of La Sombra nightclub, a sanctuary of music and dance. Carmen and Aidan find both solace and their unwavering love for each other in the safety of Masilda’s magical refuge, but time is running out as the police hunt closes in.\n\n“Merrily We Roll Along”\n\nMescal joined the cast of Richard Linklater’s adaptation of Stephen Sondheim’s musical “Merrily We Roll Along.” Similar to Linklater’s “Boyhood,” production, the film will span more than two decades. The musical, which is an adaptation of a Broadway play by George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart, centers on three friends pursuing careers in various facets of the entertainment industry and charts how their lives change as they age. “Merrily We Roll Along” is famously told in reverse chronological order. Mescal plays composer Franklin Shepard; Blake Jenner was initially cast in the role.\n\nBen Platt and Beanie Feldstein also star, rounding out the core friend group for the feature.\n\n“One down, eight parts to go,” Linklater told IndieWire in March 2022. “We shot the end. We’re making it as we go. It’s not ‘Boyhood.’ There are a ton of gaps. Nine times in 20 years. So far, it’s been a wonderful experience. It’s really cool. But come on, it’s so far off. I’ve got nothing much to say about it.”\n\n“Gladiator 2”\n\nMescal plays Joaquin Phoenix’s grown-up nephew in Ridley Scott’s “Gladiator” sequel, set 20 years after the events of the Oscar-winning original film starring Russell Crowe. Mescal takes over the role of Lucius, the nephew of since-deceased Commodus (Phoenix) who was killed by Crowe’s Maximus. Lucius is the son of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and grandson of Marcus Aurelius.\n\nFellow 2023 Oscar nominee Barry Keoghan is also reported to be cast as Emperor Geta, with Denzel Washington cast in an undisclosed role.\n\n“Gladiator 2” is written by Scott’s “Napoleon” screenwriter David Scarpa. “Top Gun: Maverick” scribe Peter Craig was previously attached as a screenwriter when “Gladiator 2” was being developed by Paramount; the studio is no longer attached.\n\nOriginal “Gladiator” collaborators, costume designer Janty Yates and production designer Arthur Max, are returning along with director-producer Scott. Scott Free President Michael Pruss, plus Doug Wick and Lucy Fisher via Red Wagon Entertainment, are also producing."
