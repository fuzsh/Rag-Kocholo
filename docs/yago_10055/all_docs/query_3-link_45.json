        "text": "It was jovial night to remember, tables adorned with red and blue, a sumptuous menu and of course the star of the night, Paul Spence. We hosted our very own supper theatre at The Nest Hotel, a well-received and entertaining show that delighted many guests. We are sorry if you missed out, but rest assured there will be more, and you do not want to miss out next time!\n\nPaul Spence, an actor with the Royal Shakespeare Company in the UK for seven years, has acted and directed in theatres from Edinburgh to Copenhagen, Vienna to Tokyo. Paul currently entertains audiences with cabaret and theatre shows in venues across South Africa and directs his anarchic amateur dramatic company, The Upstagers, in regular shows at the Schlesinger Theatre, Michaelhouse.\n\nLaughter filled the air as guests were treated to a night of British comedy with classic sketches from Rowan Atkinson, Alan Bennett, Frank Muir and other favourites. To say it was a treat, is an understatement, not to mention the delicious menu on offer and wonderfully comfortable accommodation.\n\nNext time you dream about waking up to the stunning views that the majestic Drakensberg Mountains offers, check out our specials and come and stay with us at The Nest Hotel."
