        "text": "Fubar is a 2002 mockumentary based on the lives of two lifelong friends, Terry and Dean, who are head-bangers living out their lives, constantly drinking beer. It premiered in January 2002 at the Sundance Film Festival in the ‘Park City at Midnight’ category, where it was described as “An earnest filmmaker attempts to create a coherent documentary about two bumbling, beer-lovin’ heavy metal Canadians.” It quickly became a cult classic comedy. Filmed and set primarily in and around Calgary, Alberta, the characters are partly based on a comedy routine performed by costars David Lawrence and Paul Spence that they developed based on the head-banger subculture of the time. Most of “the cast” were real people and this is the only movie they have appeared in."
