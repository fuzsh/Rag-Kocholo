        "text": "FUBAR (2002, directed by Michael Dowse)\n\nFerrell Mitchner, an amature filmaker, wants to look at two locals who live the party life, fast and hard. Terry and Deaner are two “bangers” living in Calgary Alberta. They shotgun their beers, vandalize stuff, and avoid getting a real job, and to them that’s just fine. They live a worry and care-free lifestyle with a killer soundtrack behind them: AC/DC, Iron Maiden, Thor, and original metal music too.\n\nAll’s not well in partyland though: Terry and Dean’s best friend, Tron (Troy) isn’t hanging out with them anymore. Things seem pretty dull in Calgary until Terry blabs to Ferrell that Dean’s got cancer.\n\nAnd it’s bad cancer, too. Testicular cancer. While Dean acts like it’s a joke, his on-and-off girlfriend Trixie convinces him to get treatment. For the sake of their daughter Chastity, Dean decides to go. But not before one last massive blow-out party weekend. Camping. And Ferrell’s going to film the whole thing.\n\nWhile the cancer aspect doesn’t sound funny, it does lend itself to many lines about Dean’s “giant nut”. It’s the dense but lovable Terry and Dean who make this comedy work. Eternally quotable, Fubar is equal to or better than Trailer Park Boys’ dialogue.\n\nEven though he cast some nasty fuckin’ evil shit on people, Merlin went to Heaven. That stuff’s real. Merlin was in King Henry’s court.\n\nI liked this one, too.\n\nSome of the best burgers I’ve ever had came from bowling alleys. Bowling alleys have some of the best cooks. Just because they work at a bowling alley, doesn’t mean they’re not gonna put some pride in their fuckin’ burgers.\n\nThe fact is, anybody who grew up in the 80’s knew somebody just like Terry and Dean. Dumb, but lovable and loyal, finding amusement in the simplest activities like farts, jumping fences and play fighting. Terry and Dean are not unlike that guy down the street who wore his jean jacket even on the hottest summer days. Along the way, they encouter real Albertans like themselves, (like, actually real, as in these people didn’t know it was for a fictional movie) . Guys who drink hard and party hard all weekend, waking at the crack of noon to do it all over again. While some would like to live in denial that such people exist, they’re out there, and they don’t give a shit what you think.\n\nA big part of why this movie works is Paul Spence and David Lawrence. Somehow they manage to give the characters of Dean and Terry just enough pathos, while keeping them genuine.\n\nThis is a truely awesome Canadian cult classic. It is a comedy with a real heart beating inside. Most importantly, it is only the beginning. Hopefully, you’ll want to see what adventures Terry and Deaner are up to when they move to Fort McMurray in Fubar II!\n\nBonus features are extremely high quality, with deleted scenes that should have made the final cut, and some hilarious commentary tracks. I’m always a big fan of character commentaries. The character commentary in this movie is hilarious. Just as a sad scene is about to take place, commentary Deaner says:\n\nI know I’m supposed to be sad because of what’s gonna happen…but this song’s so good, I can’t be sad. (“Run To The Hills”)\n\nNote: You gain absolutely nothing by owning this on blu-ray vs. DVD. The movie is supposed to look like they shot it with no money (which they basically did), and blu-ray actually looked worse in my opinion.\n\n5/5 stars, just give’r."
