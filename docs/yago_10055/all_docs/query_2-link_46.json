        "text": "He’s starred in one of the biggest film franchises of the decade – and one of its most acclaimed TV series.\n\nNow US actor, activist and writer Woody Harrelson is coming to York to talk movies.\n\nThe man best known as Haymitch Abernathy, the mentor in The Hunger Games, and lauded for his role opposite Matthew McConaughey in HBO drama True Detective is here to talk about a very unusual project.\n\nBack in January, Woody Harrelson directed and starred in a world’s first: a movie made on the fly, shot in real time in London in a single take and broadcast live to cinemas across the world.\n\nThe result was comedy drama Lost in London (12A), Harrelson’s directorial debut.\n\nFollowing a showing of the film at York City Screen there’s a Q&A session with Woody Harrelson – part of his tour of Picturehouse cinemas to promote the new film.\n\nCity Screen marketing director Emma Parker described the prospect as“very exciting – as we don’t often get such big Hollywood actors in.”\n\nSparkling career\n\nWoody Harrelson is a highly respected and well-known actor, being a two-time Academy Award nominee and Emmy award winner.\n\nAfter finding fame as barman Woody in sitcom Cheers, he became a big screen star in movies including the controversial Natural Born Killers.\n\nLater he found new audiences in his role in The Hunger Games films.\n\nPioneering film\n\nLost in London is a comical remake of one crazy night in Soho experienced by Harrelson.\n\nHe struggles to get home to his family after a huge scandal threatens to ruin his marriage. Run-ins with royalty, friends and the law all try to prevent him from succeeding.\n\nThe film also stars Owen Wilson and Willie Nelson.\n\nIt has been described as funny, charming and above all, moving, with The Guardian claiming “Harrelson’s directorial debut is a unique work that fuses technical wizardry with self-deprecating satire”."
