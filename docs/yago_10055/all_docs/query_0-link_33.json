        "text": "description\n\nA special 15th Anniversary screening of the Calgary-shot cult classic.\n\nAre you ready to just give’r? This hilarious mockumentary is based on the lives of lifelong friends and headbangers Terry (Dave Lawrence) and Dean (Paul Spence), who've devoted their lives to the important arts of beer, heavy metal, and, well, breaking stuff. These two mullet-sporting, beer-chugging Alberta-based headbangers are the subject of a fictional documentary by Ferral Mitchner (Gordon Skilling), a filmmaker who follows Terry and Dean as they explore the depths of their friendship through a series of unexpected twists and turns. A fun, hilarious, and unforgettable trip into the minds of two of Canada’s most beloved comic rogues.\n\nFollowing the screening, please join us for HEAVY METAL KARAOKE after party at the Ship & Anchor Pub 534 17 Ave SW. All are welcome.\n\nOFFICIAL SELECTION\n\nSundance Film Festival 2002"
