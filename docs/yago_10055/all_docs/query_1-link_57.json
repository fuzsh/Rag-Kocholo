        "text": "SHEILA MCCARTHY (NORA)\n\nDecades after establishing herself as one of Canada’s great actresses, Sheila McCarthy is having a long-earned international moment with her riveting performance opposite Rooney Mara, Claire Foy, Jessie Buckley, Judith Ivey and Frances McDormand in Sarah Polley’s Women Talking for Plan B/MGM. She and her castmates were the recipients of the Robert Altman Award for Best Ensemble at the 2023 Film Independent Spirit Awards.\n\nOther recent film credits include starring roles in Helen Shaver’s psychological thriller Happy Place for Sienna Films, the little indie horror that could Anything For Jackson with Julian Richings, supporting roles in the TriStar/Sony film Broken Heart Gallery, and the TIFF selected film Like A House On Fire. She can next be seen in Alex Noyer’s upcoming horror film Love is the Monster. Sheila won ACTRA’s Best Actress Award for her film Cardinals opposite Noah Reid, which also premiered at TIFF. Sheila won the People’s Choice Award at the Cannes Film Festival for her work in the film I’ve Heard the Mermaids Singing, also winning the Chaplin Award in Vevey, Switzerland and her first of two Canadian Screen Awards.\n\nRecent TV credits include an arc on Netflix’s Umbrella Academy, NBC’s Transplant, ABC’s The Good Doctor, CBS’ Star Trek: Discovery, and Riviera with Will Arnett and Julia Stiles.\n\nMARY WALSH (EDNA)\n\nMary Walsh created and starred in This Hour Has 22 Minutes, CBC’s wildly popular take on current affairs. The series earned her many of her numerous Gemini awards and showcased her dynamic range of characters, including the flagrantly outspoken ‘Marg Delahunty’.\n\nWalsh wrote, produced and starred in the Gemini award winning series Hatching, Matching and Dispatching, which returned to CBC in 2017 as a feature length presentation called A Christmas Fury, with Walsh and the original cast reprising their roles. In 2017 she released her debut novel, a Canadian best- seller, Crying For The Moon. She currently writes and stars in The Missus Downstairs, for which she has been nominated for multiple Canadian Screen Awards.\n\nWalsh’s recent TV credits include recurring roles on Syfy’s Resident Alien, CBC’s Hudson & Rex, and Little Dog for which she was nominated for a 2020 Canadian Screen Award, as well as numerous guest appearances on This Hour Has 22 Minutes.\n\nSelect feature film credits include The Grand Seduction and Closet Monster (Official selections at TIFF 2014 and 2015, respectively), and Mambo Italiano. She won the Canadian Screen Award for Best Supporting Actress in 2021 for her leading role in Helen Shaver’s first feature film Happy Place, and is soon to appear in Deaner ’89, alongside Will Sasso, Kevin McDonald and Paul Spence.\n\nOutside of the film, TV and theatre world, Mary is an outspoken advocate for mental health and addiction awareness as a spokesperson for Bell Let’s Talk. She’s a staunch supporter of the Wabano Centre for Aboriginal Health in Ottawa, and lends her time and voice to the CNIB, St. Joseph’s Hospital and CAMH.\n\nAmong her many awards and doctorates, Mary is the recipient of the Order of Canada, the Governor General’s Lifetime Achievement Award in the Performing Arts, and the CSA’s Earle Grey Award for lifetime achievement in television acting."
