        "text": "Rowan Russell, a former Film student, produced his first film in 2018. It was picked up by IFC Midnight in 2019. \"I Trapped the Devil\" was written and directed by Josh Lobo and produced by Rowen Russell, Spence Nicholson, and Scott Weinburg.\n\n\"Set during the Christmas season, the plot kicks into gear when when Matt (AJ Bowen) and his wife Karen (Susan Burke) show up unannounced at the home of his estranged brother Steve (Scott Poythress) to celebrate the holidays, but instead they are greeted with a disturbing surprise: Held hostage in Steve’s basement is a man — though not just any man. Steve believes he has captured the human manifestation of the Devil himself. As shock and skepticism turn to fear and paranoia, Matt and Karen find themselves caught in a spiral of terror and doubt. Could this mysterious stranger really be evil incarnate? Or is Steve dangerously unhinged?\" - Deadline\n\nDana Reason, member of our Film consortium, served as the musical arranger for composer Paul Miller (aka DJ Spooky) on \"Reconstruction: American After the Civil War\" which airs on PBS April 9th and 16th, 2019 at 9pm. The series is hosted by historian Henry Louis Gates Jr..\n\n\"The series explores the transformative years following the American Civil War, when the nation struggled to rebuild itself in the face of profound loss, massive destruction, and revolutionary social change. The twelve years that composed the post-war Reconstruction era (1865-77) witnessed a seismic shift in the meaning and make-up of our democracy, with millions of former slaves and free black people seeking out their rightful place as equal citizens under the law.\" - PBS\n\nWhen the Movies Mattered: The New Hollywood Revisited\n\nEdited by Jonathan Kirshner and OSU's Jon Lewis\n\nIn When the Movies Mattered Jonathan Kirshner and Jon Lewis gather a remarkable collection of authors to revisit the unique era in American cinema that was New Hollywood. Ten eminent contributors, some of whom wrote about the New Hollywood movement as it unfolded across the 1960s and 1970s, assess the convergence of film-industry developments and momentous social and political changes that created a new type of commercial film that reflected those revolutionary influences in American life.\n\nEven as New Hollywood first took shape, film industry insiders and commentators alike realized its significance. At the time, Pauline Kael compared the New Hollywood to the “tangled, bitter flowering of American letters in the 1850s” and David Thomson dubbed the era “the decade when movies mattered.” Thomson’s words provide the impetus for this volume in which a cohort of seasoned film critics and scholars who came of age watching the movies of this era reflect upon and reconsider this golden age in American filmmaking.\n\nJon Lewis is the Distinguished Professor of Film Studies and University Honors College Eminent Professor at Oregon State University and the author of Hard-Boiled Hollywood, and several other books on film.\n\nJonathan Kirshner is Professor in the Department of Political Science at Boston College and the author of numerous books, including Hollywood’s Last Golden Age."
