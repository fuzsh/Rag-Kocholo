This is *sort of* a different Deaner from FUBAR and FUBAR II fame, with no official connection to the other movies despite the recurring character. Dean is back in time in a story that sees him receive a trunk of his late father’s legacy. Paul Spence – playing Dean like no one else could – shares the screen with Canadian comedy royalty like Will Sasso, Mary Walsh and Kevin McDonald.\n\nThe Canadian metal-loving comedy movie arrives September 6th.\n\nRead more here.\n\nAnd for the hell of it, here are blurry photos of the times I’ve been lucky enough to cross paths with the FUBAR boys."
