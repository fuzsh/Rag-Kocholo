        "text": "Vegas\n\nThe adults are Vegas-bound when Jay hooks them up with Excelsior Level hotel accommodations courtesy of one of his big clients, but after learning thereâs an even higher level, Jay becomes obsessed with upgrading. Meanwhile, everyoneâs sneaking around when Claire secretly hits the tables to win back money she lost years ago, Phil goes underground auditioning for a secret society of magicians, Cam ducks out of a spa day with Mitch to join their friendâs bachelor party shenanigans, and Gloria is determined to hide a female version of dog butler Barkley from Jay.\n\nJoint Session\n\nTwenty-four hours before Selina's first major speech as President, her staff frantically tries to work out how she can say two completely opposite things at the same time. Gary questions his worth now that he can no longer be close to Selina; Jonah is put off by the hands-on approach of the new VP's chief of staff, Teddy; Amy learns that Bill Ericsson, a rival campaign manager, may make a play for her job.\n\nEast Wing\n\nThe President's staff prepares for her state visit with the Israeli Prime Minister. Mike tries out a new look for his more visible role. Teddy does Jonah a favor, while continuing to invade his personal space. Stuck in traffic with Richard, Amy learns via FaceTime that Selina is bringing in a new Director of Communications. Gary goes overboard while planning the state dinner for the Israeli delegation, and a painting in the White House comes under the spotlight.\n\nData\n\nWhen the personal details of a previously anonymous girl mentioned by the President are leaked, Selina's team tries to find a scapegoat for the data breach. Catherine tells Selina she wants to support an anti-bullying campaign; Dan tasks Jonah and Richard with buying fireworks for a campaign rally. While Mike is about to make a dreadful error at a press conference, the President hosts the annual Easter Egg Roll and reads a story to the assembled kids.\n\nTehran\n\nAs part of her Middle East peace-talks tour, President Meyer makes an historic trip to Iran, where an American reporter is being detained. Back in DC, Dan is wooed by lobbyist Sidney Purcell, while VP Doyle stands in for the President at a Rainbow Jersey event with a gay NBA star. Meanwhile, Kent's polling and Jonah's big mouth may cause trouble for Selina."
