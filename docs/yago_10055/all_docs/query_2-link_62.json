        "text": "A man gazing at his ­children and adoring girlfriend would normally feel a warm glow but Paul Spence can't... no matter how hard he tries.\n\nHis ­capacity for emotions was wrecked by a punch from a brawling lout that damaged his brain and changed his life forever.\n\nNow Paul, 35, can stare at a picture of himself as a happy family man but, try as he might, he can’t recapture that love.\n\nHe feels nothing. All because of one ­idiotic punch. After the incident, when he ­recovered consciousness in hospital his loved ones were overjoyed.\n\nLittle did they realise this was the start of another ­ordeal for all of them.\n\nIt would cost Paul his five-year ­relationship with girlfriend Gemma, 31, and ­estrange him from son Reece, 12, who suffers mild cerebral palsy, and daughter Shannon, 14.\n\nRead more: Dublin bar attack victim dies after 'hitting his head on pavement in one-punch attack'\n\nFormer electrician Paul said the blow turned him into an ­emotionless ­robot.\n\nHe recalled: “I woke and I knew who ­everyone was. I knew our connection but I just didn’t feel anything. I’d forgotten how to feel any emotion or empathy.\n\n“It was like everything ­before that one punch had been wiped out. The person I was had gone, along with that emotional attachment to every connection I had.”\n\nPaul’s life was devastated when he walked out the toilet of pub in Hull on April 8, 2012. There had been a brawl in the lounge area and one of the fighters viciously punched Paul for no reason.\n\nHis head hit a ceramic floor and he was taken to the neurosurgical ward of Hull Royal Infirmary. Scans showed his brain’s frontal lobe had bashed against his inner skull.\n\nPaul’s attacker was East Yorkshire judo coach Stephen Shepherd. In February 2013, the 47-year-old was convicted at Hull Crown Court of causing ­grievous bodily harm and jailed for 16 months.\n\nThe judge said: “You punched him hard and he fell to the floor. It made a sound like two ­snooker balls hitting each other.”\n\nPaul spent a week in an ­induced coma and almost two months in hospital after suffering seizures. His family hoped and prayed he would come through and when he regained consciousness they were over the moon.\n\nBut when Paul finally went home he couldn’t even remember decorating his front room a few weeks before the assault.\n\nHe said: “I knew there was something ­different about my house but I couldn’t put my finger on it. Gemma had to tell me I’d just been redecorating.\n\n“I was just a shell really. I spent hours ­staring at walls and pacing up and down. I was a ­human doing, rather than a human being.\n\n“I’d look at pictures of me and Gemma and recognise where they were taken but not recall any of the memories associated with it.”\n\nHe couldn’t recall the birth of his son Reece, from an earlier relationship, and was crushed that he could no longer understand what he was saying. The lad’s mild cerebral palsy ­affects his speech.\n\nJust weeks before the attack Paul had met Shannon for the first time. He never knew he had a 14-year-old daughter until she contacted him through his brother on Facebook. Shannon’s mother had died suddenly.\n\nPaul said: “Shannon would come round to visit and because we’d not long met I’d wonder why there was a 14-year-old girl sitting on my sofa staring at me.\n\n\"I’d always been able to understand what Reece was saying but ­suddenly I couldn’t make him out. It really hurt. There were days when I wanted to drop to my knees and scream because I was so frustrated.\n\n“My brother Mark once quizzed me on how my emotions worked and asked if I’d be upset if he died tomorrow.\n\n“I said I would miss him but didn’t know how much I would actually feel.\n\n“It was all so horribly hard for my ­family. I couldn’t visualise times we’d shared so didn’t have the feelings ­connected to them.”\n\nAs Paul struggled, ­primary teacher Gemma, friends and family showed him pictures and talked him through memories of their time together.\n\nAfter 18 months, Paul’s first memory returned – of son Reece being born.\n\n“It was an amazing ­moment,” he said. But it was too late for him and Gemma.\n\nHe said: “I must’ve been so hard for her, but I just didn’t feel real love ­towards her any more. It wasn’t just Gemma, it was ­everyone. Memories make you feel ­connected to someone and I didn’t have them. It was like my brain was starting from scratch.\n\n“I told her it just wasn’t working and she decided to move out. There was never any huge row or bitterness. I even helped her pack her things. Looking back, I was a bit cold about it.\n\n“I knew how I should feel but I couldn’t get those emotions to come to the surface. I’m not heartless person but I knew. I was like a robot.”\n\nThe couple never lost touch and remain close friends. A reunion may be on the cards as Paul works hard ­towards recovering more memories.\n\nHe said: “We’ve started seeing a bit more of each other lately so we have the chance to make new ­memories and maybe things will develop.\n\n“Never say never, but I’m not the same person I was. I struggle emotionally and still have memory problems but am ­making the best of what I have.”\n\nDespite his ordeal Paul, who had to give up his job as an electrician, refuses to feel anger towards his attacker or his ­condition.\n\nHe said: “There’s no point looking backwards. I have to accept the way I am now.\n\n“I’ll never be the man I was before. I still suffer memory and emotional problems and I’ll always have lasting brain ­damage but I am accepting the new me and I’m a more rounded person again.”\n\nHe has set up the charity Paul For Brain Recovery for other people who have ­suffered life-changing brain ­injuries.\n\nSo far he has raised £40,500 through a variety of events including marathons.\n\nOn December 12, The Hull Monty, featuring male strippers, a drag act and topless DJ, is being staged for Paul’s ­charity.\n\nHe said: “I just want to help other ­people who have been through similar experiences. You’re at the centre of a ­ripple and everything and everybody around you is affected.\n\n“It takes away part of your identity and affects your independence.\n\n“I also had depression after the attack but have worked through so much with help from therapists, family and friends and want to help other people who are walking that line of despair. Things can and do get better.”\n\nGemma said: “Paul is not the same person he was or the person I knew.\n\n“We still see each other but it’s hard to know where we are because it’s been two years since we lived together and he’s so different.\n\n“I think he needed space to find himself again and was so poorly he didn’t have the capacity to think about anyone else.\n\n“It’s hard to take and hear him say he doesn’t know if he can love fully again but he’s hopeful for the future.”"
