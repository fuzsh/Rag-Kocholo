        "text": "So I'm sitting in the parlor of a posh San Francisco hotel talking with Paul Walker about Dale Earnhardt, Jr. and how the stock car hero is a big gamer. \"So am I,\" responds Walker in his SoCal drawl. Too bad I'm not or we would have something to talk about other than his new film The Fast and the Furious.\n\nPaul Walker, star of The Fast and the Furious\n\nWalker, for those of you in the dark, is, on the surface, the stereotypical Los Angeles male heartthrob: blonde hair, blue eyes, 6 ft tall, suave as #$%^ (at least in the SoCal dude kind of way). Walker is also a rising star on the Hollywood celluloidal thespian circuit, having cut his teeth in such films as Varsity Blues, She's All That, The Skulls, and Meet The Deedles.\n\nIn FATF Walkers plays an undercover cop who infiltrates the LA street racing scene. Filled with high octane chases and plenty of NOS injected imports and given Walker's career choice as an actor, it's no wonder that he's also into role playing video game stylee. \"I like RPG stuff,\" says Walker of his game fetish. \"It's all PC. Right now I'm playing Wizards and Warriors. I love that. But like I play a lot of Ages of Empires. And I loved Myst and like I played a lot of Tomb Raider, actually.\"\n\nWhen I tell Walker that I, too enjoy a little TR action, but get endless crap from the serious gamers in the office he merely shakes his head, laughs and says \"You do?\"\n\n\"It's an addiction. It's bad for me. Like I get in front of it, I love it so much, so I have to regulate. I only play at night, only play at night. That's it.\"\n\nSo what time of the night is right for Walker to get his game on? \"Whatever, just so long as there isn't anything goin' on. I mean I'm not gonna stay inside and play a video game all day. I mean I like to be out and doing stuff. But like I'm not really a big movie buff. Like I'll see, seriously, six movies in the course of a year. Like I'll go to the theater and see six. On DVD and stuff I'll see a lot more. Like I'll watch old favorites like Michael Mann stuff. Like I'll watch all of his stuff, even The Keep. Do you remember The Keep?\" Naturally, being the purveyor of bad horror films that I am, I have indeed seen this film and do remember it. I nod my approval as Walker continues with his Mann adoration. \"His stuff's just awesome, I love Michael Mann. I love like Braveheart, classics like that. Casino, Goodfellas, I love the gangsta/mobster stuff.\"\n\nWhen I fess up to still not having seen Braveheart, Walker waves his had and sighs \"Ohhhh! Have you seen Last of the Mohicans? Go get that. Do yourself a favor.\"\n\nGuess what I'm gonna do this weekend? Myself a favor, that's what."
