        "text": "Samaria Region of ancient Israel\n\n0 0\n\nrank #1 ·\n\nSamaria (Hebrew: שומרון‎, Šoməron, Šōmərôn; Arabic: السامرة‎, as-Sāmirah – also known as Jibāl Nāblus, \"Nablus Mountains\") is a historical and biblical name used for the central region of the ancient Land of Israel, also part of Palestine, bordered by Galilee to the north and Judaea to the south. For the beginning of the Common Era, Josephus set the Mediterranean Sea as its limit to the west, and the Jordan River as its limit to the east. Its territory largely corresponds to the biblical allotments of the tribe of Ephraim and the western half of Manasseh; after the death of Solomon and the splitting-up of his empire into the southern Kingdom of Judah and the northern Kingdom of Israel, this territory constituted the southern part of the Kingdom of Israel. The border between Samaria and Judea is set at the latitude of Ramallah.\n\nHebrew Bible regions · 6T\n\nNew Testament regions · 6T\n\nSamaria · 3T\n\nJamnith Topic\n\n0 0\n\nrank #3 ·\n\nJamnith (Greek: Ἰαμνειθ), also Jabnith, Yavnit (Hebrew: יבנית), Iamnia, or in medieval parlance, Ibnit / Abnit / Ovnit, is a ruin in the Upper Galilee that came to renown during the First Jewish Revolt in the 1st-century CE. The ruin, known locally by the name Khurbet esh-Sheikh Banit, or simply Kh. Banît, lies about 3.4 kilometres (2.1 mi) to the northeast of Safed, in the Biriya Forest, and was once a fortified town towards the northeast of Mount Canaan (Hebrew: Har Kena'an), upon a hill called Har Yavnit. The hill on which the village ruins lie rises 836 metres (2,743 ft) above sea level and overlooks the Hula valley. Access to the ruin is now restricted because of an enclosed military installation built over the site.\n\nUpper Galilee · 15T\n\nFirst Jewish–Roman War · 34T\n\nGeography of Northern District (Israel) · 13T\n\nVia Maris Ancient trade route linking Egypt with Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia\n\n0 0\n\nrank #4 ·\n\nVia Maris is the modern name for an ancient trade route, dating from the early Bronze Age, linking Egypt with the northern empires of Syria, Anatolia and Mesopotamia — modern day Iran, Iraq, Palestine, Israel, Turkey and Syria. In Latin, Via Maris means \"way of the sea.\" It is a historic road that runs along the Israeli Mediterranean coast. It was the most important route from Egypt to Syria (the Fertile Crescent) which followed the coastal plain before crossing over into the plain of Jezreel and the Jordan valley.\n\nLadder of the Tyrians Geographical feature of Lebanon and the Phoenician Coast\n\n0 0\n\nrank #5 ·\n\nLadder of Tyre (Aramaic: Sûlama de Ṣôr), (Greek: ̔Η κλίμαξ Τύρου), also known as the Ladder of the Tyrians and the Promontory of Tyre, is a geographical feature mentioned in Greek and Hebrew sources, distinguished by a littoral mountainous range, the highest point of which is distant 18.5 kilometres (11.5 mi) north of Acre in northern Israel. The range stretches beyond Tyre in southern Lebanon. Along its Mediterranean coastline, the Ladder of Tyre skirts an area of about five miles wide at its greatest width, and is distinguished by capes that jut westward into the sea from the ridge which runs parallel to the general line of the coast. These capes project more than a mile into the sea, and rise precipitously at a mean elevation of 250 feet (76 m) above sea level. The Ladder of Tyre is mentioned in the Babylonian Talmud, in the Jerusalem Talmud, and in the First Book of Maccabees (11:59).\n\nMosaic of Rehob Halakhic boundaries of the Land of Israel\n\n0 0\n\nrank #6 ·\n\nThe Mosaic of Reḥob, also known as the Tel Rehov inscription and Baraita of the Boundaries, is a late third–sixth-century CE mosaic discovered in 1973, inlaid in the floor of the foyer or narthex of an ancient synagogue near Tel Rehov, 4.5 kilometers (2.8 mi) south of Beit She'an and about 6.5 kilometres (4.0 mi) west of the Jordan River, containing the longest written text hitherto discovered in any mosaic in the Land of Israel, and also the oldest known Talmudic text.\n\nAuja al-Hafir Place in Beersheba, Mandatory Palestine\n\n0 0\n\nrank #7 ·\n\nAuja al-Hafir (Arabic: عوجة الحفير‎, also Auja), was an ancient road junction close to water wells in the western Negev and eastern Sinai. It was the traditional grazing land of the 'Azazme tribe. The border crossing between Egypt and Ottoman/British Palestine, about 60 km (37 mi) south of Gaza, was situated there. Today it is the site of Nitzana and the Ktzi'ot military base in the Southern District of Israel.\n\n0 0\n\nrank #8 ·\n\nThe Israel National Trail, (Hebrew: שביל ישראל‎, Shvil Yisra'el) is a hiking path that was inaugurated in 1995. The trail crosses the entire country of Israel. Its northern end is at Dan, near the Lebanese border in the far north of the country, and it extends to Eilat at the southernmost tip of Israel on the Red Sea, a length of 1,015 km (631 mi).\n\nBat Galim Neighbourhood of Haifa, Israel\n\n0 0\n\nrank #9 ·\n\nBat Galim (Hebrew: בת גלים‎, lit. Daughter of the Waves) is a neighborhood of Haifa, Israel, located at the foot of Mt. Carmel on the Mediterranean coast. Bat Galim is known for its promenade and sandy beaches. The neighborhood spans from Rambam hospital in the North to the Haifa Cable Cars in the South, and from the Mediterranean Sea's shore line in the West to Bat Galim's train station on the East."
