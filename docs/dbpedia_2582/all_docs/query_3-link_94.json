The PhD project evolved following work for more than a decade at Al-Mashhad – the Palestinian Institution for Cultural landscape Studies (PICLS) in Ramallah – when I was part of a multi-disciplinary team in landscape studies.\n\nThe PICLS team carried out several archaeology surveys across the West Bank, which aimed to investigate the modern human impact over the landscape, archaeological sites, and traditional buildings. One of the main outcomes of this research in general, and fieldwork in particular, is the evidence of the Israeli structural destruction of Palestinian landscape and archaeology. This could be seen, for example, by building the separation wall which destroyed or confiscated many archaeology sites.\n\nProject bibliography"
