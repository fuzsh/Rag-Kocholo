        "text": "The archaeology of Islamic Palestine and Jordan remains the poor and neglected cousin of Biblical and Roman studies. For instance much of the essential groundwork on the historical geography of the period has yet to be done, and the material culture of the earlier Islamic periods is either largely ignored or misclassified. Little or no effort has been made to establish a soundly based understanding of the economic and social structure of the region from either written or archaeological sources. This thesis attempts to deal with some of these shortcomings by investigating the administrative geography, routes and urban framework of the two Islamic provinces of the jund of Filastin and the jund of al-Urdunn during the first four centuries of Islamic history, that is during the Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid and early Fatimid periods (ca. 20-375/640-985). The material for this study comes from a number of varied sources, both literary and archaeological. Particular attention is paid to the Arabic written works of the 3rd/9th and 4th/10th centuries, especially those which deal with the historical, administrative and descriptive geography of the Islamic World. Archaeological research has produced further detailed information on the urban centres of Filastin and al-Urdunn and their administration. In particular a combination of Early Islamic numismatics and the Umayyad papyri documents from Nessana makes a valuable contribution to identifying the administrative structure of these two provinces under the Rashidun and Umayyad caliphates."
