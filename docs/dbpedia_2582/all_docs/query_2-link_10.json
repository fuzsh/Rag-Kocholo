        "text": "Work concentrated in the north-east corner of the town, clearing a large church (one of three on site) and the adjoining building, probably a monastery. The church contained marble elements, carved and painted architectural details, and a mosaic floor. It was not possible to ascertain the date of the original construction and of the subsequent additions and reconstructions. A number of headstones found suggest the church continued to be in use until the seventh century.\n\nTo the south of the church was a large open paved plaza, to the east of and adjoining the church was a series of rooms and courtyards of a monastery. The pottery recovered predominantly was Byzantine, some sherds of late Roman date. The site was reoccupied some time later, moulded ceramics from the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries found.\n\nWork was abandoned at Sbeita in December 1935 due to lack of water at the site and the activities were moved to Auja el Hafir at end of December 1935.\n\nTwo churches at Auja were cleared by Baly in November, which were returned to in December. The churches and their accompanying rooms were excavated as well as a large fort which occupied the remainder of the hill top. Clearance of fort hampered by large Turkish hospital built in the middle of it.\n\nIt was not possible to determine the stratification of the hillside, however pottery dating from the third century B.C. through to the fourteenth century A.D. recovered during excavations.\n\nDiscovered papyri in rubbish dumps located in rooms attached to the north and south churches."
