What role, if any, did it play in the development of civilization? Where and when did its ancient inhabitants live? Was its soil rich or poor, its water plentiful or lacking, its minerals abundant or unknown, its landscape attractive or forbidding, its geographical position of great or indifferent importance? Every area on the face of the earth, be it seemingly ever so waste and empty, has a story behind it which the inquisi- tive sooner or later will attempt to obtain. And when such a terra incognita forms a bridgehead between continents, as does that part of the Holy Land called the Negev, then the urge to explore its past becomes irresistible. I have con- cerned myself with that task during the last six years, under the auspices of the Hebrew Union College Jewish Institute of Religion. It represents the natural continuation ojE similar work car- IX X INTRODUCTION ried out in previous years in Transjordan, which had resulted in bringing its remote and hazy past into clear focus for the first time. The discovery of more than a thousand ancient sites belonging to a whole series of advanced, agricultural civilizations existing in widely separated periods had under- lined and filled out scanty references in the Bible dealing with some of them. Edom, Moab and Ammon became tangi- ble realities, the Nabataeans were revealed as a highly civi- lized people, and unscientific theories of profound climatic changes in historical times had been dispelled by new and irrefutable historical facts. It was therefore logical and alluring to extend the archaeo- logical survey westward across the dividing rift of the Wadi Arabah, which separated Edom from the Negev. It seemed unlikely that civilization could have halted at the edge of this comparatively narrow, physical fault and tenuous bound- ary line which stretched from the south end of the Dead Sea to the north end of the Gulf of Aqabah. And so we plunged into the Negev and found that it was full of cultural monu- ments, waiting to be recognized. In the course of the last half dozen years we have been able to place on the map the locations of about four hundred sites of distant centuries, which belonged to well-developed civilizations reaching far beyond the confines of the Negev. Others too, notably Jo- hanon Aharoni, David Alon, Emanual Anati and Jose Feld- man have in recent years discovered and correctly dated some additional ancient sites there. Two of the sites mentioned in this book, namely Khirbet Gharrah and Khirbet Ghazza, were first archaeologically examined and correctly dated by Jo- hanon Aharoni. The biographical account of man in the Negev is a long and tortuous one, with many chapters com- pletely missing. It reaches back to early prehistoric periods, when Palestine Man first walked the face of the earth. The record of his coming and going is revealed by the changing types of skillfully made flint tools, that remained after the disappearance of his kind. INTRODUCTION XI History as such begins in the Negev during the latter part o the Chalcolithic period, near the end o the fourth mil- lennium B.C., when people lived in mud-brick villages, tilled the soil, wove cloth, made fired pottery, carved ivory images and forged copper tools and weapons. The brilliant French archaeologist, Jean Perrot, has excavated one of these villages near Beersheba, and I have found others in the comparatively fertile plains of the Northern Negev. This region may be equated with the Beersheba Basin and represents the top- most and broadest section of the triangular area of the Negev. After the Chalcolithic civilization was brought to an end by some unknown catastrophe, there ensued a long hiatus in the datable history of man in the Negev, which lasted for most of the third millennium B.C. And then, suddenly, a new civilization appeared, which can be assigned by clear- cut pottery remains to the Abrahamitic Period between the twenty-first and nineteenth centuries B.C. The events in the lives of the Patriarchs, which are alluded to in the Biblical narrative as having taken place in the Negev, could have occurred only during these three centuries, if they are to be included within any historical framework at all, and if one is to rely, as I do, upon the amazing historical memory of the Bible. These Abrahamitic Period settlements were found not only in the plains of the Northern Negev, but also among the broken highlands of the Central Negev. Indeed, in these two sections of the Negev were located most of the villages which sprang up under incredibly difficult conditions during widely separated periods of approximately four thousand years of ancient history, The average rainfall even in these districts of the Negev, whose lands at the best must be classified as semi-marginal, ranges from less than ten to about six inches a year, as one goes from north to south. Beyond that, in the narrowing confines of the Southern Negev, the annual precipitation Xli INTRODUCTION diminishes progressively till it measures only about an inch or less a year at Elath. In all three parts of the Negev, we found Judaean king- dom villages and fortresses, which could be dated from the time of King Solomon at the end of the tenth century B.C. down to the beginning of the sixth century B.C., when Judah was destroyed by the Babylonians. Solomon and his successors maintained fortresses and industrial settlements even in the almost completely arid Southern Negev, to protect the trade routes through it between Jerusalem and the Judaean sea- port and industrial center of Ezion-geber, and to keep the lines of communication open to and from the copper mines in the Wadi Arabah, which formed the eastern bound- ary of the Negev, even as Sinai bordered its western side. The most intensive period of sedentary settlement in all of the Negev occurred during the Nabataean-Roman and Byzantine periods, extending from the second century B.C. to the seventh century A,D. This stretch of almost eight hundred years represents the longest period of continuous civilization in the entire history of the Negev. Every possible bit of ground was cultivated, and every drop of rainwater was sought. Commerce throve and the population grew as never before. As many as a hundred thousand people may have lived there then. The long history of the rise and fall of civilizations in the Negev, with periods of sedentary occupation alternating with periods of emptiness, when Bedouins were the masters of the land, is strikingly similar to that of Transjordan. The gaps in the story must be ascribed to wars and economic blight rather than to drastic changes in the weather. As a result o these explorations, the area of the Negev no longer marks an empty space on the edge of the map of the Fertile Crescent, whose cultivable lands, extending in a great semicircle from the head of the Persian Gulf through Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Palestine are hemmed in by the desert to the south and east, the mountains to the north and the Mediterranean to INTRODUCTION xiii the west. The Negev is in many ways the poorest of these lands, but far from the least important. It is a land of sharp contrasts, of surprising fertility and extreme barrenness, of delicate flowers and fierce bushes armed with tearing spikes, of rain in scarcity and cisterns without number, of extreme dryness and heavy dew. It is a land of great heat by day and bitter cold by night, of some amazing riches and much unrelieved poverty, of cultivable plains, high and broken plateaus, deep canyons, and innu- merable dry stream beds that on rare occasions are hosts to short-lived torrents. It is a strong land of wide horizons and open spaces, where divinity once made itself apparent and where sturdy pioneers seek once again to strike root. The Biblical passages quoted are based on the Revised Version published in 1901, which happens to be the one I have had with me on my travels during the last few years, mainly because of the dictionary and concordance attached to it. I have, however, made my own insertions or transla- tions whenever it suited my purposes. Our work in the Negev would not have been possible with- out the assistance and protection of the Israeli Armed Forces. Highly to be praised are the numerous, young Israeli colo- nists, whose deep interest in Biblical archaeology made them gladly forego their brief annual vacations to join my expe- ditions in the hottest months of the year. Many thanks are due my chief assistant, Benno Rothenberg, who is responsible for all the photographs published in this book, unless other- wise specified. He has been an invaluable member of our archaeological team, and I am deeply indebted to him for his helpfulness in every possible respect. The first published de- scription of the sanctuary in Wadi Umm es-Sedeir, which is dealt with in the last pages of this book, and the original translations of the inscriptions found there are contained in the excellent volume, Tagliyot Sinai, written by him and others. Jean Perrot and Dorothy Kenyon have kindly per- XIV INTRODUCTION mitted the use of photographs from their excavations. Mrs. E, Philip Vogel has prepared the index. I dedicate this book to the memory of the late Louis M. Rabinowitz, who not only supported most of my Negev expeditions with open hands and heart, but was also one of the most generous and deeply understanding patrons in mod- ern America of arts and letters and the freedoms that go with them.

In a cave in the hills above the Lake of Galilee, in another near Nazareth, and in the cave of et-Tabun, south o Mt. Carmel at Haifa, overlooking the Mediterranean, bones or skulls or skeletons of human beings have been discovered which may be assigned to the Middle Palaeolithic period, as far back perhaps as 150,000 to 120,000 years ago. Some of the skeletons of et-Tabun were cased in natural coffins of limestone breccia which had slowly solidified about them, as flies or beetles are sometimes entombed in coagula- tions of amber. The skeletons range from a Neanderthal type woman to a man with some strikingly modern charac- teristics. The mixture of races they represent had resulted from the meeting and interbreeding o the earliest peoples on the intercontinental bridgehead of Palestine. The vast influence Palestine has always exercised because of its geo- 2 RIVERS IN THE DESERT graphical position affected the gradual transformation there of homo sapiens. A new species came into being, which has become known as Palestine Man (Palaeoanthropus Pales- tinensis). The flaked flint tools this Palestine Man used have been found also at numerous places in the Negev. Palaeolithic flint hand axes of a still earlier period were found there cor- responding to those discovered at the et-Tabun cave below the levels in which skeletons of Palestine Man were un- covered. The Negev, then, was within the orbit of his wander- ings, as well as that of his predecessors, whose tools alone are known, but whose identity still escapes us. It is possible that the very, very great grandchildren of Palestine Man, if we assume that, somehow, there were continuous lines of suc- cession, may include such native peoples of the Negev as the Kenites, among whom Moses found himself a wife. It is con- ceivable that there may be a chain of unbroken connection from the prehistoric man of the cave near Mt. Carmel to Moses, the \"man of God\" of Sinai and Nebo. One was de- pendent upon adaptability and cunning, the other upon con- science and consecration. Both of them were touched by the finger of God. Both of them, stirred by the mystery of crea- tion, worshipped divinity in accordance with their own understanding. Palestine Man was a mighty hunter, although the only weapons and tools at his command were those he learned early in his career to shape out of flint and basalt. He ac- quired this skill apparently not long after crossing the im- mense chasm that yawns between beast and man. With such simple means and the intelligence that enabled him to con- trive traps of various kinds, he managed to keep alive and perpetuate his kind in the savage conflict for existence. Monstrous rhinoceroses, hippopotami, elephants and cave oxen were common in his age. Their bones have been dug up all over the country from the Mediterranean coast to the Jordan river valley and in the mountain ranges between* In 'IN THE BEGINNING\" 3 the ancient bed of the Jordan, which lies considerably below the present one, there was found an elephant's tusk six feet long. Bones and teeth of these great beasts have been dis- covered also in the hills of Bethlehem. In those days tropical conditions prevailed. The land was raw and damp and hot. Then a series of radical changes followed during approximately the next 100,000 years, until a dry, warm climate developed at the beginning of the Meso- lithic Natufian period, about the eighth millennium B.C. By then the original types of animals had vanished, and deer and gazelles became abundant. The climate has remained much the same to this very day! During the passage of these eons of time radical alterations in the face of the earth were taking place. Seas withdrew, lakes dwindled, swamps dried up and the courses of streams were diverted or blocked. As the result of a great upthrust of land, the southward flow of the Jordan was locked in a thirteen-hundred-foot-deep pit to form the leaden mixture known variously as the Asphalt Lake, the Sea of Salt, the Sea of Lot or the Dead Sea. Throughout these countless years, the Beni Adam (the Chil* dren of Man) did not lose ground but strengthened and improved their lot. Some fauna and flora disappeared com- pletely, but mankind surged forward, succumbing neither to cataclysms of nature nor to catastrophes of its own making, Ingenious, inventive, indomitable, the Children of Man rap- idly achieved dominion over all other living creatures. \"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth\" (Genesis 1:26). With the advent of the Natufian period, some ten thousand years ago, there came a revolutionary development. The in- habitants of the land began to practice a primitive kind of agriculture. They used flint tools to break up the ground for A RIVERS IN THE DESERT planting, harvested wheat with sickles of fine flint blades embedded in bone handles and crushed the grain with pestles in mortars of limestone and basalt. With these first halting steps to produce their own food, instead of relying exclusively upon hunting and the gathering of wild fruits, they left the world of the savage and entered the Modern Era. Flocks began to be raised, baskets made, sculpture attempted. Bone pins and awls came into use. Pendants and beads appeared as ornaments. A sickle handle of bone found at et-Tabun was carved to represent a fawn. The inhabitants of Natufian Jericho commenced living in houses of their own construc- tion, instead of in caves. By the beginning of the Neolithic period, about 6000 B.C., Jericho already had experienced several millennia of what by all counts must be considered civilized history. Man was on the march and he would establish cities and kingdoms and cultures. The quest for knowledge and power would become a conscious and growing concern. He would learn how to bake pottery, smelt ores, weave cloth, reckon time by the stars in their courses, create languages with al- phabets to express his thoughts, build towers which reached arrogantly toward the skies and bend the forces of nature ever more to his will. And then disaster would strike, Deserts would appear where irrigated fields had flourished, entire states collapse with their cities literally disintegrating into dust, whole populations melt away where multitudes had thrived. Instead of laughter and song and the bustle of cre- ativity, there would be the silence of emptiness and the still- ness of death. But then, after a time, all of this would start all over again, with sometimes the embers of previous gains serving to kindle the new developments. Thus for long years, or even centuries, various parts of the earth would lie waste and void, until newcomers often of a different culture and speech and sometimes of a differ- ent race took possession of the land. They would erect new dwellings and sometimes protective walls around them over \"IN THE BEGINNING'* 5 the debris of the old, the sameness of location determined by unchanging factors of topography, water, defense and eco- nomics. As a result of the frequent repetition of this process in the lengthening calendar of civilization, there would arise in time over the original knoll an artificial city-hill, which would finally be abandoned forever for one reason or an- other. It was not uncommon for the debris of these ruins piled on top of one another, as one superimposed city after another was destroyed, to rise as much as a hundred feet or even more. Some of these tells, as they are known in Arabic and He- brew, or tillu (ruin-heap) in Babylonian, conceal the ruins of as many as twenty cities, encompassing almost the total span of history. Later, during the Hellenistic-Roman period especially, new cities were built on previously unoccupied sites because of their very large and heavy foundations and structures and because it was no longer necessary for each one to be strongly fortified and located on an easily defendable position. Whole landscapes in large parts of the Fertile Crescent, which are bare of population and cultivation today, are strewn with these tells, testifying both to the creative genius and the nihilistic tendencies of mankind. Excavations under- taken among some of them indicate the existence of temples and houses and of arts and letters of exciting excellence in early ages. Many of the achievements in such countries as ancient Assyria, Babylonia and Egypt have rarely been sur- passed. From an airplane one can see lines of ancient canals, now silted over, which once extended between the Tigris and the Euphrates. They testify to the existence of wide- spread and intensive irrigation agriculture in what was, it is thought, formerly the Garden of Eden. In our time a fine start has already been made to restore all this country to its former fertility* With tranquility, vigor and vision, the glo- ries of Assurbanipal, Nebuchadnezzar and Artaxerxes could be equaled again in the same lands. 6 RIVERS IN THE DESERT There are some countries, however, such as Transjordan and the Negev, where these multilayer ed mounds of former civilizations are rare. If you travel through the one you will be convinced from casual observation that large sections of it were from very early times, if not always, beyond the limits of settlement. If you travel through the other, it will seem obvious that it was, on the whole, never anything but an uninhabited and uninhabitable wilderness. It has indeed been thought, and little wonder, that \"no great route now leads or ever has led through this district of the Negev,\" It has always appeared as a blank on every Biblical map because of the familiar and generally accepted dictum of high au- thority that \"[the Holy Land] practically extended from Dan to Beersheba, where, during the greater part of history, the means o settled cultivation carne to an end\" (George Adam Smith, The Historical Geography of the Holy Land, p. 280). These judgments are not correct for either of these lands. In each of them, for many reasons, periods of urban settle- ment were hundreds and sometimes thousands of years apart. The extreme desolation created repeatedly by merci- less invaders resulted often in the total disappearance of civilizations. \"And he took the city, and slew the people that were therein; and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt\" (Judges 9:45), In the fallow periods that followed, there was no law nor order, and Bedouins roamed the countryside. Their depre- dations, along with the forces of natural deterioration, re- sulted frequently in the remaining ruins being leveled to the ground. When new settlers arrived, sometimes after pro- longed intervals of time, they would neither know nor be able to recognize the locations of the previous town sites and would build their houses of stone or of mud brick on virgin soil No firmly rooted people of the land would be left who had retained and could transmit from historical memory the heritage of unbroken tradition. Only by chance would they \"IN THE BEGINNING\" 7 build exactly where perhaps a thousand years earlier another village had once stood. Has the Climate Changed? The easy and unsubstantiated explanation frequently given for the absence or for the downfall and disappearance of whole kingdoms and cultures in the ancient Near East is to assume climatic changes of such severity as to make the es- tablishment or continuation of civilized life impossible. Yet the horrifying tendency of man, wearily repeated throughout the centuries, to take his neighbor's goods or country, or to \"scorch\" the land for his own protection and his enemies' hurt, is all too adequate a reason. It certainly makes understand- able why scores of cities have been reduced to piles of faceless rubble, rich countrysides transformed almost overnight into wildernesses, and why dark ages have followed times of cul- tural enlightenment. I could show you a thousand or more sites of antiquity in Transjordan which existed during and after the time the land was supposed no longer to be able to sustain them because of radical, pronounced and permanent climatic changes. The settlements on them flourished in spite of currently popular theories of a steady diminution of rainfall that made perma- nent, sedentary, agricultural occupation progressively impos- sible. Their imagined absence in many apparently vacant regions had to be accounted for, and this theory of climatic change seemed to furnish the answer. The fault lay perhaps in the fact that most of the ruins which barely fleck the sur- face could not be discovered without mastery of the mod- ern techniques and tools of archaeological investigation. These were developed and perfected in the first half and particularly in the second quarter of the twentieth century A.D. in Palestine by such scholars as Sir Flinders Petrie, P&re Hugo Vincent, Clarence S. Fisher and William F. Al- bright, among others. Only then was it possible to recognize RIVERS IN THE DESERT the locations and determine the dates of such ancient sites as were marked by often little more than surface scraps of pottery. The science o pottery identification has now developed to such a degree that from broken fragments alone, which are almost invariably found on the surface of every ancient site, the competent student can determine the spans of civilized occupation they represent with less of an error than a hun- dred years in a thousand. Pottery, made of clay mixed with a binding material of tiny stones or shells and thoroughly baked in a kiln, is perhaps the most durable substance that man has ever created. Pottery can be shattered, but the pieces will remain, indeed have remained intact for thousands of years. Stone crumbles. The limestone fortification walls of ancient Biblical cities were regularly breached by the enemy's building huge brush fires against them and literally burning them down. Copper and iron, unless specially treated, corrode and decompose. Glass decays and flakes away. Wood, leather, papyrus, paper and cloth disappear unless properly protected or buried in absolutely dry places where no moisture can penetrate. Pottery alone is impervious to such chemical changes and has endured since it was first invented, as an exceedingly impor- tant handmaid of history. Man's discovery of how to make and bake earthenware vessels in which water could be carried and food prepared and stored, ranks in importance not fat behind his learning the kindly uses of fire for his internal and external comfort. As a result of empirical experience, gained from numerous scientifically controlled excavations of ancient sites, it has become possible to fix the dates of widely distributed pottery vessels, whether found in context or not At first, complete pieces of pottery, or even fragments from a distinctive kvel o! a tell, could be dated by all kinds of associated criteria, rang- ing, for instance, from previously well known types which may have been imported from abroad to scarabs or coins or ''IN THE BEGINNING\" 9 inscriptions. In time, through the extension of this process, it became possible to utilize just potsherds, found on the top or slopes of a tell or on a completely razed site, as keys to open gates in what previously may have appeared to be blank walls of history. These artifacts were familiar to the ancients and were referred to frequently: \"Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! a potsherd among the potsherds of the earth! Shall the clay say to him that fashioneth it, what makest thou?\" (Isaiah 45:9). The forces of erosion cutting away constantly at the sides of every layered tell expose to sight pottery and potsherds usually of every period of its occupation. If hundreds of ancient sites in a given area are examined only in this one fashion, the margin of error in fixing the periods of sedentary occupation is either nil or is reduced to negligible propor- tions. Dates arrived at from such surface finds have been regularly corroborated by subsequent excavation. Years ago, William Foxwell Albright, the most outstanding scholar and archaeologist of the ancient Near East, examined the pot- sherds on Tell Beit Mirsim (Biblical Debir or Qiriath-sefer) in southwestern Palestine and decided that it had been in- habited from 2000 to 600 B.a Four years of excavations followed. On the basis of the huge quantity of materials ex- cavated, he came to the conclusion that his previous figures were wrong. Instead of from 2000 to 600 B.C., the proper dating, he said, should have been from 2200 to 586 B.C.! I have gathered fragments of pottery from the surfaces of one or another ancient site which fairly shout out the periods of history they belong to* It is as if they had been waiting for ages for someone to come along and notice them and pick them up, so that they could describe with eloquent pride the time and quality of their kingdoms. I can assure you that the archaeologist regards each artifact with feelings akin to personal affection. With the \"open sesame\" that such surface sherds afforded our expeditions, we worked our way, square mile by square 10 RIVERS IN THE DESERT mile, through Transjordan and later on the Negev, prospect- ing for the treasures o antiquity. It was not easy in this fashion to glean the stuff of history from large areas re- peatedly scythed bare of flourishing communities. As a re- sult, whole civilizations came to the fore whose real nature had either been insufficiently comprehended from scanty Biblical references or whose very existence had escaped rec- ognition. In Transjordan, the Biblical kingdoms of Edom and Moab, among others, assumed the substance of tangible reality. Mesha, king of Moab, consequently became a person of flesh and blood and not just a shadowy figure in the Scrip- tural account, as did also Balaam of Ammon, who refused at the behest of Balak of Moab to curse Israel, and Job of Edom who refused to curse God. The famous stele, on which was incised the account of how Mesha regained his country's independence from Ahab of Israel, became more understand- able in the light of the numerous fine cities and stout for- tresses we discovered that belonged to the highly developed kingdom over which he ruled. And the kingdom of Edom was found to be just as strong. It became clear too, why, being denied permission to travel via the King's Highway through the center of Edom and Moab, in spite of their specific promise to deviate neither to the right nor left of it, the Israelites of the Exodus had no choice but to heed the refusal. Their enfeebled forces would have been overwhelmed by the armies of these en- trenched kingdoms. They therefore took the desert route northward around the east borders of Edom and Moab be- fore turning westward to cross over the Jordan and enter the Promised Land at Gilgal and Jericho. The Exodus through easternmost Transjordan could thus not have taken place before the thirteenth century B,C. If it had occurred earlier, the wanderers would have found neither Edomites nor Moab- ites with sufficient strength to say them yea or nay with regard to anything* \"IN THE BEGINNING 11 The onslaught of Babylonia and not any cataclysms of nature finally brought about the downfall of Edom and Moab and their contemporaries on both sides of the Jordan in the first pan of the sixth century B.C. Considerable numbers of their populations were dispersed to other countries. Thou- sands of Judaeans were exiled to the banks of the Euphrates, whence later on with Persian aid some hundreds returned. In Edom and Moab, to speak of those countries alone, civilized life ceased to function for a long time. Uninhabited houses collapsed, ungarrisoned fortresses caved in, cisterns became filled with sediment and untilled acres assumed the appear- ance of barren desert. Only the climate remained the same. Centuries earlier, another civilization of high achieve- ment had flourished between the twenty-first and nineteenth centuries B.C. till it was savagely liquidated by the Kings of the East. According to Biblical statements, which have been borne out by archaeological evidence, they gutted every city and village at the end of that period from Ashtaroth-Karnaim in southern Syria through all of Transjordan and the Negev to Kadesh(-barnea) in Sinai (Genesis 14:1-7). From then on, for hundreds of years, till the establishment of the kingdoms of Edom and Moab and Ammon in the thirteenth century B.C., there was a great gap in the history of permanent, sed- entary settlement. Bedouins roamed freely throughout the length and breadth of most of Transjordan. With a few no- table exceptions in the area of Ammon, the central and south- ern parts of the land knew the sound of the carpenter's hammer and the ring of the stonemason's chisel no more. Systematic agriculture became a thing of the past. Commerce ceased. There are no pottery remains of this period other than at several isolated places to testify to civilized activity, which continued uninterruptedly in Canaan on the west side of the Jordan. And, again, all these changes can be ascribed not to radical shifts in climate, but rather to the vagaries of human character. 12 RIVERS IN THE DESERT The phenomenon of the rise and fall o civilizations in Transjordan, the Negev and Sinai seems to be governed by a tidal regularity of building up and breaking down, with a slow gathering of strength for renewed effort in between. Unrestrained by governmental authority, which halted them normally at the edge of the desert, Bedouins were always pre- pared to seize the lands of the Sown. A miracle of transforma- tion would then gradually take place as the Bedouins became in their own right tillers of the soil and architects of new cities and civilizations. But then, apparently inevitably, some centuries later, new invaders from afar or other nomads from nearby would dispossess them in turn. After the fall of Edom and Moab, hordes of Nabataean no- mads infiltrated into the vacuum to dominate for a while the ever changing scene. Many Edomites were pushed into south- ern Judah, where they became known as Idumaeans, and from among whom came the ancestors of Herod the Great. Gradually the Nabataeans built up a remarkable civilization of their own, learning much from the remaining Edomites and Moabites whom they absorbed. The kingdom they created included southern Transjordan, as well as the Negev and Sinai and northern Arabia. At the height of its development between the second century B.C. and the second century A.D., it extended from Syria to Arabia and to the borders of Egypt. Their rule was short lived. The fate which had over- come all of their predecessors overtook them. They, too, suc- cumbed to conquest by arms and not to uncontrollable forces of nature. The resulting diversion of trade to other regions and routes drained away their economic lifeblood, and not the drying up of their lands because of a sudden lack of water. The conclusion seems inescapable, wherever it has been possible to check, that the major factors affecting the course of human history certainly in the Near East, and probably elsewhere, during the last ten thousand years, are those over which in general there is a large measure of human control \"IN THE BEGINNING\" 13 Response To Challenge It was because of the challenge which the Negev as a con- spicuous tabula rasa among the historical maps of the ancient Near East presented that we found ourselves journeying through it, with the determination to examine archaeologi- cally every square mile of its entire area. A similar undertak- ing in Transjordan had resulted in the curtain of its past be- ing raised, so that the wonder of its history stood out for all to behold like a statue recovered from the sea. Why not the same for the contiguous territory of the Negev, we asked ourselves? Could this isosceles triangle of the Southland have been as empty of civilization and untouched by animal hus- bandry and agriculture and permanent places of inhabitation as it was generally made out to be? Part of the misapprehension with regard to the Negev, as I have already said, is the \"from Dan to Beersheba\" statement which stems from Judges 20:1 and reads: \"Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation was as- sembled as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba, together with the inhabitants of the land of Gilead, unto Jehovah at Mizpah.\" In I Samuel 3:20, there is a similar reference to \"all Israel from Dan to Beersheba. . . . \" The phrase \"from Dan ... to Beersheeba\" became a household word. It is supposed to have been quoted by the Bible-bred Welshman, Lloyd George, at the Versailles Conference in 1919, after the end of the First World War. The victors were engaged in carving up old states, dishing out new ones, allocating spheres of interest to one another and drawing new maps. When a proposed new sketch map of Palestine, which had been placed under British mandate, was handed him, it showed, so the story goes, that the ancient site of Biblical Dan was not in- cluded in it With a sweeping stroke of a large red crayon, Lloyd George redrew the boundary line so that it was north of Dan, bellowing out that every idiot knew that the Holy Land stretched from Dan to Beersheba* !4 RIVERS IN THE DESERT Assuming that this account is not apocryphal, and that Lloyd George was unaware o the Talmudic injunction not to use the Bible \"as a spade wherewith to dig, 51 he might have cited as warrant for further expansion of mandatory territory still other passages in Sacred Writ, indicating that the king- dom of Israel extended from \"the entrance of Hamath unto the Brook of Egypt/' with all of Palestine and the Negev in between (I Kings 8:65; II Kings 14:25; Joshua 15:1*4), That would have given him everything from Syria to Sinai. Ancient Hamath is to be identified with modern Kama on the Orontes River, which cleaves the length of most of Syria before turning sharply west to pour into the Mediterranean, The Brook of Egypt, known today as the Wadi el-Arish, bi- sects the peninsula of Sinai from south to north, and empties into the Mediterranean at el-Arish. The prime minister may simply have overlooked this portrayal of the extreme reaches of Solomonic suzerainty. He may also have been conscious of a prior agreement, that Syria was to be guided to inde- pendence by France and that the destiny of Sinai was to be supervised by Great Britain. In all events, the Negev was and has remained until recently a largely unknown quantity so far as both its physical and historical properties are concerned. The more I thought about the Negev, the more my curi- osity about it was aroused. Was it a real desert or only seemingly so? Was it actually as bare and barren and inhos- pitable to sedentary occupation as had for so many centuries been taken for granted? And even if apparent poverty of natural resources and the marginal nature of much of its soil made an absence of permanent settlements seem plausible, it was obvious that from earliest historic and even prehistoric times important travel and trade routes had passed through it. Where were the camps and fortresses and guard posts and sources of water supply which must have existed along their lengths? Which were the tracks that Abram (Abraham) and his retinue had followed on their journey from Canaan to Egypt and back again? Was it possible to figure out firom the \"IN THE BEGINNING\" 15 topography of the country, together with Biblical descrip- tions, the lines of march that the Israelites of the Exodus had wearily pursued through the Negev en route from Sinai to the Promised Land? How did Solomon and the kings of Judah after him man- age the logistics of conquest and defense and commerce be- tween their capital in Jerusalem and their distant port of Ezion-geber on the north shore of the east arm of the Red Sea, if the Negev in between were an uncontrolled and law- less wilderness? At what stations and by which cisterns or wells or springs did the caravan of the Queen of Sheba halt at nighttime and for rest periods during the day while cross- ing the Negev in the course of the very long and necessarily arduous trip from her mystery-shrouded kingdom in Arabia to the mountain throne of Solomon in Jerusalem? Did the Biblical name of the Wilderness of Zin apply to the entirety of this Southland, or just to one of its parts? Could indeed the Negev ever have been a forlorn no man's land of history, being completely encircled as it was by Egypt, Sinai, the Aegean cultural area, Canaan, Edom and Arabia? Bare landscapes, bold colors and fiercely bright light stand out in the picture of the Negev. The picture is one of strength and simplicity. Hunger and thirst are its patrimony, but there are great treasures of ore and oil concealed in its most desolate wastes. Its hills are gaunt and there are lunar- like craters and massive depressions imprisoned below almost sheer cliffs. It has some fertile plains and innumerable patches of good soil in carefully terraced creek beds. Wide stretches of hamada desert are covered with flint and slate and sandstone pebbles as if the earth in abject mourning had strewn itself with sackcloth and ashes. A few springs and in- frequent wells accentuate the general poverty. It is a land ravaged by drought, but where on rare occasion freshets tear through normally dry stream beds. It is indeed difficult for the newcomer facing the blazing desolateness of most of the Negev, especially during the sum- j6 RIVERS IN THE DESERT mer and autumn months, to believe that it ever was or ever could be anything but a completely barren desert. Some of it is just that and always has been. To conjure up in it, how* ever, verdant crops, fat flocks of sheep and goats and herds of cattle, hundreds of camping sites, strongholds and thriving villages would seem to require a wildly uninhibited imagi- nation. If one looks at its soil during the unlidded hours of unre- strained sunlight, then the earth is stripped of all sculptur- ing shadows and bleached of the hues that make parts of it appear at other times like a painter's palette. Surely, you say to yourself, this is nought but a nether world of \"hissing and howling.\" The massive heat of the midday hours is intensi- fied in the shelterless open during the silent fury of the breathless hamsin. One shivers under the penetrating cold which comes with the quick darkness. Pity those who must cross its expanse eastward to Edom, or turn off from the south to Arabia or Egypt, or strike northward to Palestine and Syria, Was it not natural, then, in accordance with normal hu- man weakness, that the people of the Exodus should yearn to return to the lush fields and plentiful water of the Nile Delta lands, quickly forgetting the slavery they had chosen to es- cape? We can read with sympathy the outpourings of their hearts: \"And the Children of Israel, even the whole congre- gation, came into the Wilderness of Zin . . . and , . . abode in Kadesh. . . , And there was no water for the congregation; and they assembled themselves together against Moses and Aaron. And the people strove with Moses, and spake, saying. Would that we had died when our brethren died before the Lord! And why have ye brought the assembly of the Lord into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our beasts? And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us unto this evil place? It is no place of seed or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink\" (Numbers 20: 1-5), \"IN THE BEGINNING\" 17 And so, in despair and ingratitude, the Israelites raised their voices in rebellion. Thus they turned against the leaders who had guided them through perilous difficulties, and dem- onstrated their lack of faith in the God of freedom and hu- manity, without whose illumination they were lost. They were to pay grievously. They would wander till the end of their days. It would take a generation with stronger moral fiber and firmer adherence to God than they possessed to reach the goal of their vision. Had they moved on, they would have found the bareness and grimness of the Negev far less formidable than first sight or report made it appear to be. Even in late summer, during the early morning hours, low-lying mist frequently blankets the gouged earth so completely as to efface all landmarks and blot out visibility. This moisture alone suffices for the few vineyards and gardens, which can be found in the most unexpected places. They grace the severe landscape, nor- mally burned out and bare at this season, with rare greenness. Almost every afternoon, even during the hottest months of the year, refreshing breezes blow. I have been able to stave off the exhaustion that threatened me on more than one\" oc- casion while searching out the past in the Negev only because I knew that around four o'clock these gentle winds would come to revive my spirits. In the softer light of this temper- ate interval, as also at the beginning of the day, the soil sheds its aspect of whitefaced hostility. The subtle richness of its reddish browns and saffron grays becomes perceptible. The rainbow hues of multicolored sandstone formations are seen most vividly when the sun is well removed from its zenith. The values o the Negev must be sensed and sought out in order to be appreciated. Patience and imagination are re- quired to understand its moods, skill and strength and cour- age to surmount its rigors* The Negev has always played an epic role in the annals o Israel and of mankind. It represents an amazing phenomenon which caimot be made completely understandable by any t g RIVERS IN THE DESERT sum of rational factors. The actual size of this triangularly shaped Southland of the Bible, measuring some seventy by one hundred and twenty miles at its greatest dimensions, bears no relationship to its limitless and continuing impor- tance. Neither its geographical position nor its physical char- acteristics can, by themselves, adequately explain the unique- ness of its influence. Of ail the places which figured in its ancient past, the names of only a few stand out. The others are lost in deep obscurity. Even these few would not be known were it not for the highly selective records of Sacred Writ. As a result, the Negev has long appeared to be an empty wilderness which people crossed with all possible speed and in which only nomads were really at home. Its boundaries are indicated by four points which box the compass. They are Kadesh-barnea near the eastern edge of Sinai, Hormah between Beersheba and Arad at the entrance to Canaan, Elath by Ezion-geber on the Gulf of Aqabah, and Punon in the Arabah on the way up to Edom, I have never traveled along the time-rutted trails that tie them together without feeling a sense of excitement. I have never walked in the footsteps of the Patriarchs and the Prophets without wondering what new view of the miraculous past might be unrolled before me. I have never wandered over the Negev or Sinai without realizing that here God's will was revealed to mortal men, giving them a status little lower than the angels. As we traveled with frequent halts at many places in the Negev, the lines of demarcation between periods of time seemed to disappear. The panoramas of the past merged in our consciousness with the scenes of our own day. The events that had taken place there were part of the substance of our own selves. This was not a far country that we were visiting as casual tourists. We were back in the land of our spiritual belonging. It was as if our own grandfather were leading us by the hand and showing us the scenes we seemed to remem- ber from the stories of his youth he had so often told us. \"IN THE BEGINNING\" 10 As we thought and talked of Abraham and Moses, of King Solomon and the Queen of Sheba and of many others in the long annals of the history of the Negev, and as we looked for the paths they followed, and found by the hundreds the places they had halted at or sojourned in, comparing what we saw and experienced and discovered with what we knew had gone before, it frequently became difficult to distinguish between present reality and past happenings. A kaleidoscopic parade of many peoples and eras and tongues filed before us, with the line reaching back much farther than we could ever possibly see. One day we searched out and established firmly the dates of the Judaean fortresses guarding the little-known Way of Shur of Biblical fame, which crossed through the Negev and central Sinai to the Egyptian border (Genesis 16:7; 20:1; 25:18; Exodus 15:22; Numbers 33:8). Abraham and Isaac and Jacob had used it (Genesis 24:62; 26:22), and hosts of others, too. At one point there, a caravan was approaching us! It could have belonged to the Midianites who sold Joseph to Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh's guard. Many centuries later yet another Joseph, together with his little family, probably traveled the same route the Midianites must have followed through the Negev and Sinai to Egypt. It is told that he heeded the warning of an angel of the Lord, who appeared to him in a dream saying: \"Arise and take the young child and his mother and flee unto Egypt and be thou there until I tell thee: for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him. And he arose and took the young child and his mothet by night and departed unto Egypt; and was there until the death of Herod\" (Matthew 2:13-15). The route of Joseph's journey could have been little difr ferent from the one Jeremiah is supposed to have taken when he escaped from Judah after its conquest by Babylonia (Jere- miah 4g:6~i2), And earlier still, Hadad the Edomite had been taken to Egypt by his father's servants when he was \"yet 2O RIVERS IN THE DESERT a little child,\" returning only after David's death to become \"an adversary to Solomon\" (I Kings 11:14.17.21-22). The small band now appearing above the skyline might be Joshua and Caleb and their companions sent out by Moses to make their way from Sinai to spy out Canaan. There is a raggedly dressed man standing on the side of the road and motioning to us with cupped hands for a drink of water! Give him the full canteen! Of striking appearance, he is obviously someone of quality, with his wise and deeply fur- rowed countenance. He could, indeed, be taken for the Prophet Elijah, fleeing from the fierce anger of the Phoeni- cian princess, Jezebel, whose misrule in Samaria he had fear- lessly condemned. Far removed from her and Ahab's rich and corrupt court, he sought in the great stillness and sanctity of this region to hear the voice of God. Miracles in the Desert The question of water clamorously raised by the Israelites at Kadesh-barnea has always stood in the forefront of human concern in the Negev and Sinai. Only about eight inches of rain fall in the most favored Beersheba region in an average year, with the amount being progressively reduced, until it is little more and frequently less than an inch a year at Eilat. And more often than not, most of it conies in a few torren- tial storms. Men and tribes will fight bitterly over wells or cisterns. Bedouins shot at my party last summer when we suddenly appeared without previous announcement at one of their watering holes on the border of Sinai. They feared that we had come to preempt it and deprive them and their ani- mals of its life sustaining supply. Understanding their feel- ings, we did not fire back but shouted explanations and soon made friends with them. I have experienced the thickness of tongue, the salty crust of drying spittle, the flaking and cracking of swollen lips and the leaden faltering of limbs that attend prolonged thirst in RAINFALL IN INCHES \"IN THE BEGINNING'* 21 the desert. I have never stumbled across water in Moab or Edom or in the Wilderness of Zin or Paran, without uttering a prayer of thanksgiving. Not to have water in the Negev or to know where to find it can spell disaster and even death. The simple Biblical account of Hagar and her infant son tells of such a near tragedy: \"And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread and a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her shoulder; and gave her the child and sent her away. And she departed and wandered about in the wilderness (south) of Beersheba. And the water in the bottle was spent, and she cast the child under one of the shrubs. And she . . . sat over against him and lifted up her voice and wept. And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven and said unto her: What aileth thee, Hagar. Fear not, for God hath heard the voice of the lad where he is. Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thy hand, for I will make him into a great nation. And God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the bottle with water and gave the lad to drink. And God was with the lad, and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness, and became, as he grew up, an archer. And he dwelt in the Wil- derness of Paran (in Sinai) . . /* (Genesis 2 1 : 14-2 1). It is hard to understand at first sight how life of almost any kind can exist in many wild stretches of the Negev. We were talking about this fact while looking about us from the top of a rock-ribbed hill overlooking the Wadi Hafir. It is a long, fairly wide, cruelly bare little valley, scarred by a shallow, twisting, dry stream bed braided with heaps of stones. There was no hint o cultivation, nor any sign of man or beast. In the changing light of the late afternoon, however, the sur- rounding foothills began to assume distinctive character. Suddenly, there was life after all! Coming out from the clefts and slopes of the hills were irregular blurs of movement that seemed to be converging toward a central point in the valley. As they came closer to 22 RIVERS IN THE DESERT us, we could make out that they were straggling lines of sheep and goats. The two figures, looking like scarecrows, that glided ahead of them were shepherdesses, almost com- pletely muffled in long black garments trailing the ground. We learned that they were headed for the low-lying well of Bir Hafir. Age-old tradition and hard experience have taught the Bedouins that water can be found in even the most inhospi- table reaches of the Negev. \"And the servants of Isaac dug in the nahal (the wadi or dry stream bed), and found a well of living water'* (Genesis 26:19). In numerous places, thamileh holes need be sunk only to a shallow depth until a moderate amount of underground water is reached. The discovery of water in these regions can frequently only be described in the language of religious experience: \"Thus saith the Lord: dig numerous holes in this nahal ... Ye will see neither wind nor rain, yet the torrent-bed shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, ye and your cattle and your beasts. And this is but a light thing in the eyes of the Lord . . .\" (II Kings 3:16-18). A well in this part of the world is a continuous miracle, evoking joy and song: \"Spring up, O well! Sing to it. The well which the princes dug, which the nobles of the people sunk with scepters, with their staffs\" (Numbers 21:18). I have often joined throngs of Bedouins at wells such as Bir Hafir to exchange greetings and news with them, while they filled and refilled the adjacent stone troughs until the thirst of their animals had been slaked. They would always gladly interrupt the rhythm of drawing up brimming bucket- fuls, with ropes sliding smoothly along grooves cut by long usage in the stone facing of the well's mouth, to give me a cooling drink or pour water over my head and hands to wash off the dust and sweat of the way. \"And it came to pass . . . that behold Rebekkah came out . . . with a pitcher on her shoulder . . . and she went down to the fountain and filled her pitcher and came up. And the \"IN THE BEGINNING\" 23 servant ran to meet her and said, Give me to drink, I pray thee, a little water from thy pitcher. And she said, drink, my lord, and she hasted and let down her pitcher upon her hand and gave him to drink. And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw for thy camels also, until they have done drinking. And she hasted and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and ran again unto the well to draw, and she drew water for all his camels\" (Genesis 24:15-20). The well of Bir Hafir has recently been deepened and strengthened with cement walls. There can be little question, however, but that a cruder predecessor or others like it served earlier inhabitants of this area. In more propitious centuries of political security and peace, there had been stone villages alongside and overlooking the Wadi Hafir. Their occupants dry-farmed some of it with occasional success, but their herds and flocks of domestic animals were their main concern. They engaged in trade, too, because a very impor- tant travel route led through the valley, connecting the Abdah area with Sinai. Their lives always revolved around their wells and later on also around their cisterns, as do those of the modern Bedouins. It is axiomatic that wherever there is or once was water in the Negev or elsewhere in the Fertile Crescent, it is possible to find remains of ancient settlements. Many of them antedated by millennia the beginnings of his- torical times, which are marked by man's invention of fire- baked pottery. On another trip, we arrived one day at the green-tinged pool of Ain Yerka. It is hidden in a muddy hollow at the base of a semicircle of sheer walls which slant upward and inward to a small skylight opening at the top. It reminded me of a font in a dimly lit cathedral, whose dome is pierced with a small window letting in the sun's rays for a few minutes each day. The rare rain waters of the entire depression of the Machtesh Gadol (Wadi Hathirah) fling themselves in their united volume through this narrow, purse-lipped aperture to form for a while a thunderous waterfall twenty-five feet high. 24 RIVERS IN THE DESERT Its flood is funneled then through the canyon of the Yerka to plunge down to the Wadi Arabah. Imagine the ecstasy of the ancients at the sight of this boisterous torrent, however short-lived its violent passage might be. Pools of water, re- maining at various places along its length for weeks at a time, were utilized to the last drop. And enough seeped under- ground farther back to keep the modest spring of Ain Yerka alive throughout the entire year. Completely dependent upon it in former times were several villages, whose sad remains we discovered on the neighboring hills. The importance of this spring and of the transient spate with which its waters are occasionally mingled may be judged from evidence of the considerable effort undertaken in an- tiquity to afford easy access to it. Out of the rock face of the cliff on the steep north side of the canyon were cut flights of steps. With low, carefully calculated risers and landings, they follow the contours of the hillside down to the bed of the wadi. Turn to the left then, and behold the precious spring! The vaulting cavern which houses it has been hol- lowed out by the seasonal waterfall. There is absolutely nothing to indicate when the steps were first built or by whom. It must have taken well-tem- pered tools to hew them out of the hard, gleaming white limestone. This was not the handiwork of unskilled laborers but of highly trained craftsmen. The height of each riser had correctly to be figured and the space of each tread exactly measured. Each step had to be chiseled out carefully along previously drawn chalk lines- Where did the artisans come from? What language did they speak? When and why did they and their community disappear, without leaving a single trace of their identity behind them? As I stood wondering about these matters, there suddenly appeared a herd of goats, which came skipping down the steps. Behind them were several Bedouins who, with judi- ciously thrown pebbles, directed their course* Watching them, I seemed to recall other figures like them descending \"IN THE BEGINNING\" 25 the staircase to the spring, and thought I heard snatches of song. The wind was blowing in the wrong direction, and it was hard to make out the words. Were they in Nabataean Aramaic or in the soft-spoken Hebrew of southern Judah? But then these were in vogue two and three millennia ago, and surely my imagination was playing me false. Yet these steps must have been made and used in one or both of these periods and perhaps still earlier too. The song I was listening to came clear to me now. It was in a quavering, nasal Arabic to the thin tune of a high-pitched flute. Music of this kind must have been heard frequently before at this place, with its melody penetrating the recesses of shadowy beginnings and its beat harking back across the centuries to the mallet blows of master masons. In admiration of their handiwork, we salute their memory, however veiled in mystery their tribe and tongue and time may be. Any source of water, however small and brackish, as long as it is at all drinkable, is accounted precious in the Negev. Even chance pools collected in hollows or wadi beds after the brief winter rains are not neglected. I have seen modern Bedouins pitch their tents by them till nothing was left but a rapidly drying patch of mud. They would then depart leav- ing behind them few traces of their stay which time would not surely efface. This practice was followed as far back as prehistoric periods, with the difference that worked flint tools were extensively employed then. They were commonly aban- doned as it became necessary to move from site to site, it being easy enough to fashion new ones wherever a long halt was made. They are enduring records of the passage of early peoples across the face of the land, with each age putting the imprint of unique characteristics upon its artifacts. Stone Age Inhabitants On the surface of a Stone Age site alongside the Wadi Nit- sartah was much evidence that people had once lived there. 2 5 RIVERS IN THE DESERT The ground was thickly strewn with fine stone implements shaped by the hands of men. An extensive flint-tool industry had flourished here. Wherever we turned were pestles and mortars of stone, and flint cores from which blades, picks, axes, adzes and arrowheads had been skillfully flaked. Much of the raw material had been struck from blocks of flint dug out of the ground so that in their \"green\" state they could more easily be worked, being less brittle than when long exposed to the elements on the surface. Admire the delicacy of stroke necessary to produce, for instance, these fine blades and spear- and arrowheads, some with barbed or serrated sides! They bear with remarkable fidelity the stamp of the Neolithic period of their origin. It hails back, approximately, from 6000 to 4500 B.C. That was long before written docu- ments of any kind could have come into existence. This particular center of Neolithic tool industry was only several miles northwest of Auja Hafir or Nessana (Nitsanah), as it was known in classical times. An age-old travel route passes by it that led from Palestine through the Negev to Sinai. A clear Bedouin trail follows the same path to this very day. There are scores of similar and also earlier prehistoric sites in the Negev. Is a wisp of cloudy memory about the Neolithic peoples who lived there and in Canaan to be found in the names of the mysterious Refa'im and Zamzumim (Deu- teronomy 2:20) who get such scanty mention in the pages of the Bible? However, the Neolithic peoples of the Negev or of the ancient Near East in general were not merely primitive no- mads distinguished only by the ability to make excellent tools out of ordinary stones. There were already in this age in Canaan highly developed urban communities of sophisti- cated civilization, to judge particularly from discoveries at ancient Jericho, Some twenty successive phases of superim- posed houses of the Neolithic period, resulting in the accu- mulation of forty-five feet of debris, as one house was built on top of the ruins of the preceding one, have been opened \"IN THE BEGINNING\" 27 up there. In the excavations, each stratum or level of occupa- tion was separately removed, starting from the top down, as if they were successive floors of a multi-storied building that was being wrecked. In a scientific excavation, every possible detail is noted, recorded, measured, drawn and photographed, with many individual objects being carefully preserved. The remarkably advanced architecture of Neolithic Jericho was characterized by well-proportioned rectangular rooms, solid walls built of bricks of a distinctive, flattened cigar-shaped style, and by carefully laid, lime-surfaced, painted and bur- nished clay floors with walls to match. Flint tools, polished stone bowls, grinding querns and pestles were common, and in the middle of the period the use of pottery was introduced. Deeply concerned with the mysteries of life and creation and reproduction, the Neolithic Jerichoans were devoted to a pronounced fertility cult and to a highly developed an- cestor worship. That their sheep, goats, cattle and pigs might reproduce and increase in number, diminutive clay replicas of them were placed in a shrine as freewill gifts of thanksgiv- ing and supplication. Phallic objects expressed their concern for the perpetuation of their own kind. Such offerings and symbols were not new in early Jericho. They had played a central role in the religious expression of human beings for millennia preceding the Neolithic age and were to be employed for long periods following it there and in the Negev and throughout all of the ancient Near East, The children of Israel were to fashion a golden calf in the plain below Mt Sinai at the very moment of Moses' confron- tation by the deity, whose Being could not be imprisoned in corporeal form. Prophets and priests were to inveigh against the making of idols and images designed to ward off barren- ness and ensure fecundity, but it was to take many lifetimes before the sense of their message became part of the inner- most consciousness of their people. Especially remarkable in Neolithic Jericho are sculptures of gods or humans which reveal high artistic achievement. 28 RIVERS IN THE DESERT Several groups were found there, each representing an early triad of god, goddess and offspring. Each figure was built up, about two-thirds life size, on a skeleton framework of reeds over which lime marl was placed and molded into shape. One head of astonishing sensitivity and power has been pre- served almost intact, being formed to show the full face. It is very thin in profile, having only sufficient depth to support the features. Deeply impressed shell eyes, ridged eyebrows, aquiline nose, prominent cheeks, thin mouth above protrud- ing lips, high forehead crowned with raised coiffure and lines of paint representing tattooing or hair or both make this sculpture appear like the death mask of someone who had been of outstanding character and rank in actual life. The artist has captured in the attractive and ageless feminine face a reflection of deep wisdom and strength and serenity that indeed make a goddess out of a mortal queen. In another form of sculpture commonly employed in this sophisticated city, which may first have been founded ten thousand years ago, actual human skulls were employed. Over their bone structure, the features of the dead were faithfully reproduced in plaster, with detailed representation of nostrils, ears, eyelids and mouth. The eyeballs were formed in some cases by rounded shells in two segments, with a verti- cal or horizontal slit to represent the pupil. In another type, the eyeballs were formed by cowrie shells, with their hori- zontal openings giving the effect of eyes nearly closed in sleep or death. There is evidence that the plaster features were flesh-tinted with paint. In one instance, in order to complete the realism, a mustache was painted on. Horizontal bands of blackish paint decorated the top of one of the skulls, which were usually left bare. Thus the departed chieftain or king and heads of households were made ever-present gods. They could be worshipped, and their favorable intervention in the lives and fortunes of their families regularly implored. Neolithic and still earlier Natufian Jericho could not have been an isolated phenomenon. It must have had widespread \"IN THE BEGINNING*' 2Q connections with other Natufian sites, whose history extended from the eighth down to about the middle of the fifth mil- lennium B.C. Other towns of equal antiquity are bound to be excavated sooner or later in Palestine, and will be found to be sisters in culture and accomplishment to this source- spring of civilization in the Jordan Valley. The tool makers of the Neolithic site near Auja Hafir were embraced within the general civilization which early Jericho so amazingly represented. Their skills in fashioning flint implements seem less surprising in view of the advanced attainments of their urban brothers. It is hard for us who measure periods of time by the span of our own life expectancy to appreciate the reality of people who lived so long ago. Yet they were graced with all the native endowments which enabled them, in spite of frequent setbacks, to expand the frontiers of knowledge. In retracing the steps which have led us to our present state of civilization, we are constantly astounded by the kind and quality of hu- man achievements, which frequently have been completely forgotten and buried in the oblivion of the past. The lure of archaeology is in reaching back to the realms of our physical and spiritual ancestors and walking with them through both the darkness and light of their days toward a future, which has become part of our own present. We have learned through detailed and comparative studies, which concern themselves with everything from climate to geology to pottery to literature, to find our way back with much certainty to very distant reaches of human history. Now we resort also to the new science of Carbon- 14 dating to help determine the general correctness or errors of our con- clusions with regard to the time limits of periods of antiq- uity. To be sure, in this kind of dating it is necessary to allow a leeway of several hundred years each way. By this method, through the measurement of the surviving radio- activity of charcoal from Neolithic Jericho, a date of about 6250 BXX was obtained for the first two-thirds of the series o RIVERS IN THE DESERT of houses with plastered floors. Earlier levels precede them, which probably bring the beginnings of Jericho to the eighth millennium B.C. Indeed, history was at home in this fabu- lous town. Its very name, like that of ancient Beth Yerah (the Temple of the Moon), which is located on the south shore of the Lake of Galilee at the point where its waters funnel into the Jordan, indicates the worship of the lunar deity there. The story of civilization might well start with the words: \"And in the beginning, there was Jericho.\" It is difficult to realize, in view of the remoteness from us of the Neolithic peasants of Jericho and of the nomads of the Negev who were embraced within the outer limits of their culture, that all of them would have been considered upstarts in any genealogical Blue Book of human society of the an- cient Near East. They were latecomers on the scene, with little or nothing being known of their origins. If aristocracy is determined by the questionable standards of mere longev- ity and continuity of background, then they must be judged to have been extremely plebeian in comparison with their Paleolithic predecessors. Is the Bible Correct? Here, then, was the Negev, like an unsealed mountain, un- known but not unknowable. Our methods and techniques of penetrating its secrets were the same as those we had used in our archaeological mapping of all of Transjordan and the Jordan Valley. They had been perfected in modern times especially by William F. Albright. The first task was to as- semble and examine the literary evidence. The chief source of information was the Bible itself. Its historical memories and descriptions and sometimes exact references to particular places are of inestimable value to the scholar. The purpose of the Biblical historian and archaeologist is, however, not to \"prove\" the correctness of the Bible. It is primarily a theological document, which can never be \"IN THE BEGINNING\" 31 \"proved,\" because it is based on belief in God, whose Being can be scientifically suggested but never scientifically demon- strated. Sacred Writ was concerned in its entirety with setting forth and underscoring the uniqueness and universal- ity of God as the Source of all being and the Father of all mankind, whose wisdom was supreme, whose word was law, and whose imperatives were the moral mandates of human conduct. Saga and song, legend and myth, fact and folklore were woven into the text to illustrate and emphasize this central theme. Those people are essentially of little faith who seek through archaeological corroboration of historical source materials in the Bible to validate its religious teachings and spiritual insights. The archaeological explorer in Bible lands must be aware of the fact that as important as the Bible is for historical information, it is definitely not primarily a chronicle of history, as we understand that term today. It is above all concerned with true religion and only secondarily with illustrative records. Even if the latter had suffered through faulty transmission or embellishments, the purity and primacy of the Bible's innermost message would not thereby be diminished. As a matter of fact, however, it may be stated categorically that no archaeological discovery has ever controverted a Biblical reference. Scores of archaeological findings have been made which confirm in clear outline or in exact detail historical statements in the Bible. And, by the same token, proper evaluation of Biblical descriptions has often led to amazing discoveries. They form tesserae in the vast mosaic of the Bible's almost incredibly correct historical memory. The whereabouts of Solomon's long-lost port city of Ezion- geber was for centuries an unfathomable mystery, because no one paid attention to the Biblical statement that it was lo- cated \"beside Eloth, on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom\" (I Kings 9:26; 10:22). And that is exactly where we found it, in the form of the small, sanded-over mound of g2 RIVERS IN THE DESERT Tell el-Kheleifeh on the north shore of the Gulf of Aqabah, which is the eastern arm of the Red Sea. Memory of its loca- tion had been snuffed out like the flame of a gutted candle. Assuming, however, as we did, that the Biblical statement was literally correct, it was not too difficult to rediscover it. Previous explorations had convinced us that the line of the present seashore had changed but little since Biblical times, and that the land of Edom did indeed reach that far south, and also that the Nabataean-Byzantine site of Aila near Aqa- bah must be on or close to the site of ancient Elath. From that point on, there was little more to do than to stroll along the seashore and examine the only little tell there, which, shortly before our arrival, had been visited by another ex- plorer, Fritz Frank. He, however, had not been trained in pottery identification. Surface pottery finds and the results subsequently of three seasons of excavations there enabled us to identify Tell el- Kheleifeh with Solomon's fabled seaport His ships, made and manned by Phoenicians, used to sail from there to distant Ophir and back (I Kings 9:26-28), In a similar manner, our discovery of Solomon's copper and iron mines in the Arabah rift north of Ezion-geber verified completely the sometimes questioned description of the Promised Land as being in part a land \"whose stones are iron and out of whose hills you can dig copper\" (Deuteronomy 8:9). On the basis of that in- formation, whose reliability we accepted as a matter of course, and acting on a \"hunch\" as to where to look, we were able to locate the ancient mines and furnaces and slag heaps and establish their dates by pottery finds. Our task was to spy out the Negev. It was necessary first of all to examine the geography and topography of the land and become acquainted with its physical nature. The lay of the land has throughout the ages determined the location of the roads. We soon discovered that if we followed modern Bedouin trails we would find ourselves on ancient highways. A firmly trodden track used by nomads today passes along \"IN THE BEGINNING\" 33 the middle of a Roman road in the desert depression of the Wadi Raman, as if it were a painted line separating lanes of traffic on a modern thoroughfare. Clumps of fallen and broken Roman milestones accentuate its antiquity and past unchangeability. We were able to establish that it had been used in Judaean and earlier times too. The modern Israeli road parallels pan of its course. Its counterpart in Trans- jordan is called the Tariq es-Sultani (the \"Road of the Sul- tan' 1 ). In many places it runs next to or directly over the road built by Trajan from Damascus to Aila, which, in turn, superseded the Derekh ha-Melekh (the \"King's Way\") of the Bible. Soil and natural resources had to be studied too, to see what use, if any, had been made of them in the past, even though present neglect seemed to belie that possibility. Furthermore, every spring, however small, and every well, however insignificant, had to be visited, every means of se- curing and saving water examined. There is a cardinal rule in archaeological exploration which bears frequent repeti- tion, namely, that people will have built houses wherever there is good water. I have on occasion visited an area around a spring or well and failed at first to find the ancient site that must have existed in its vicinity, but I have almost al- ways discovered it sooner or later if I persisted in the search. Ours was not the first venture of its kind in the Negev, In the fall of 1913, two young English archaeologists undertook the exploration of parts of Sinai and the Negev. They tried through surface reconnaissance to determine more about the ancient history of this area than had previously been known. Each of them was subsequently to achieve international re* nown. The one, Sir Leonard Woolley, as the excavator of Ur of the Chaldees and other sites of absorbing interest. The other, T. E. Lawrence, as a redoubtable desert warrior and as the greatly gifted author of The Seven Pillars of Wisdom. They published the results of their investigations in a book called The Wilderness of Zin, which appeared in 1915, 34 RIVERS IN THE DESERT The Wilderness of Zin refers loosely to the region between the camping place of Moses and his people at Kadesh-barnea in northeastern Sinai and the Ascent of Aqrabbim (Scorpion Pass), which marks the steep rise from the Arabah into the broken hill-country of the Negev (Numbers 13:21; Joshua 15:1-4), Within this expanse are contained some of the most important parts of the Negev. The investigations of Woolley and Lawrence dealt with a few of the comparatively small number of tells to be found in the northern part of the Negev and with the small Judaean kingdom fortress located at Kadesh-barnea. Also described are several of the springs and wells and cisterns and ancient burial tumuli they came across. Their special concern was with the easily recognizable ruins of half a dozen towns of amazing size and still recognizable grandeur, whose greatest development and final collapse occurred during the Byzan- tine period. The vaulting walls of excellent masonry of magnificent churches, which are among the earliest in Christendom, can still be seen at some of these sites. Those at Isbeita are par- ticularly striking* They give a vivid impression of the bril- liant Christian civilization which flourished in the Negev particularly during the fifth and sixth centuries A.0, The main Byzantine sites discussed in The Wilderness of Zin, in addition to Isbeita, are Mishrefeh, Abdah, Khalasah, Ruhei- beh, Nitsanah and Kurnub. They were all built over the ruins of earlier Nabataean and Roman cities, whose beginnings may be traced back to the second and first centuries B.C. The antecedents of some of them reach farther back into still earlier historical times. Through no fault of their own, neither Woolley nor Law- rence nor anyone else of their time could conduct a proper archaeological exploration of the Negev or Sinai or Trans- Jordan, because they lacked the simple but indispensable tool of pottery identification. That tool was not really developed and sufficiently refined for scientific use until almost a gen- \"IN THE BEGINNING\" 35 eration after their archaeological venture in Sinai and in the Negev. It provides the modern archaeological explorer, as I have already said, with the equivalent of an almost in- fallible divining rod. Even a single potsherd can sometimes be of considerable significance. A number of years ago, some of us were walking along the top of the ancient city wall which still surrounds the magnificent remains of Roman Gerasa (modern Jerash) in Transjordan, Some Roman sherds were visible in the de- bris on top of the wall They had been washed down from the adjacent hill slope, whose soil, through forces of erosion, was now flush with the top of the wall. The ancient stone terraces which had once kept the soil in place had through cen- turies of neglect almost completely disappeared. Suddenly, we saw among them a single fragment of pottery which could be clearly dated to about 2000 B.C. This was a source of pleased amazement to us, because it indicated the possibility of the existence of a pre-Roman and pre-Hellenistic site at Gerasa, for which we had long been searching. However, one swallow does not make a summer, and one potsherd does not make an ancient settlement. For all we knew, some modern Job might have brought it from elsewhere to scratch his boils (Job 2:8). Looking about then very carefully, we saw a low, flat- topped, completely isolated hill nearby, A painstaking search of its slopes was undertaken, and it soon became apparent that the single sherd was not a lonely waif strayed far from home. It was one of many, which increased in number as we reached the hilltop. Flush with the ground were the founda- tion remains of the stone fortification wall that had once surrounded it. We had found the Bronze Age city of Gerasa, which had flourished about four thousand years ago. We had simply overlooked it previously, even though it occupied a classical position. Almost directly below it was the powerful spring around which the Roman city was built two millennia later on. RIVERS IN THE DESERT In a somewhat similar fashion, our expedition recently dis- covered a striking Solomonic fortress on a Gibraltarlike hill- top above the extremely powerful spring and rich garden lands of Ain Ghadyan in the southwest part of the Wadi Arabah, It guarded access to some of the most important copper and iron mines there, which had been intensively ex- ploited by King Solomon, and it commanded the main high- way on the west side of the Arabah rift to and from his chief seaport, Ezion-geber:Elath, on the Red Sea. The blossoming Israeli settlement of Yotvatah is now located at Ain Ghadyan. Newly planted groves of date palms and orchards of other fruit trees and widespread, irrigated fields yielding abundant harvest of various crops testify to the creative labors of its young pioneers. They are blessed with an abundance of water both from the spring and from as many wells as they care to dig through earth and several feet of rock to reach a plentiful supply of underground water in the Arabah proper. Much of the water of the spring is piped about eight miles south-southwest to the Arabah site of Timnah, known to the Arabs as Mene'iyeh. The mining operations extensively carried on in former times at Timnah by Solomon's men are being repeated on a much larger scale today. A modern smelter has been erected there to process the ore. We had found its equivalent in Ezion-geber, where Solomon's engineers had, about 3000 years ago, erected an elaborate smelter. It utilized the principle of the Bessemer blast furnace system. Flues were provided in its walls through which the strong and constant winds from the north were admitted to furnish the draft necessary for the charcoal-fueled flames in the furnace rooms, On a previous occasion, we had discovered the remains of a Nabataean caravanserai at Ain Ghadyan, together with some fragments of the beautiful pottery of this gifted people. There were also some pieces of slag, indicating that copper ores which had been mined somewhere in the vicinity had been given a \"IN THE BEGINNING\" yj preliminary \"roasting\" before being brought to the Solo- monic smelter at Ezion-geber for further refining. Slag heaps scattered throughout much of Arabah and in many of its lateral approaches testify to the extensiveness of these early mining operations. When we arrived at Ain Ghadyan this time, we heard that pieces of pottery and slag had been found on the rectangular, sheer hill overlooking the spring. We immediately ascended the very steep trail leading to its top, to discover that it was another of the fortresses that Solomon had built, and that some of his successors had rebuilt in the Wadi Arabah and throughout the Negev to guard the mines and to protect the avenues of communication and commerce so vital to the safety and economy of Israel and Judah. Without the surface sherds which dated this stronghold to the time of Solomon about three millennia ago and also to later periods of oc- cupation, we could have guessed at, but never firmly fixed, its place in history. Pottery, literary references, topography and geography, soil and minerals and water and climate, varying economic, religious and cultural factors of local or foreign origin, shift- ing populations, public security and the impact of personali- ties like Moses and Solomon all these and more too must be considered by the archaeological explorer, as by the historian, in order to find and intelligently put together the pieces of the puzzles which lost civilizations represent. Experience counts for much, and driving curiosity accounts for more. After a while, the archaeological explorer begins to under- stand the genius and moods of a country, to gain an insight into the alchemy of influences which conditioned its develop- ment. He becomes familiar with the backgrounds and com- plexities of its ancient civilizations, and conscious of the in- clinations and aptitudes of its former inhabitants. He relives their past, learning to plan and build with them, to share their fights and fears, their triumphs and defeats. He begins 38 RIVERS IN THE DESERT to recognize from far away the places of their lodging and to know in advance the circumstances of their living and the forms of their self-expression. In one age, the people of the land would prefer to build their villages on long, fairly gentle slopes, open to the breezes, close to the fields they tilled and within a reasonable distance of the water they required for themselves and their animals. In another, they would pick strategically located hilltops which they would strongly fortify and provide with cisterns they had learned how to dig and make watertight. In yet a later period of immense skills in soil and water conservation, they would establish settlements in inhospitable areas where none before them and few after them were able to strike root and survive. Each age obviously had its own peculiari- ties, and each segment of the earth's surface possesses unique characteristics which make it different from any other. This applies certainly to the story of the Negev, CHAPTER II \"REMEMBER THE DAYS OF OLD\" Five Thousand Years Ago THE ATTEMPT to unravel the story of civilization in the Negev gave rise to innumerable questions and problems. Was this terra incognita, as had been generally assumed, in truth a kind of Paradise Lost situated between the granaries of plenty known as Egypt and the country \"flowing with milk and honey\" called Canaan? Could it indeed be dismissed as being merely a grim and gray and nearly waterless desert link between these totally dissimilar parts of separate continental masses, whose fortunes were bound up respectively with the flood of the Nile and the flow of the Jordan? The easiest and most natural point of departure for the history, archaeology and geopolitical significance of the Negev is from the city called the Well of Seven or the Well of Oath, which are the Biblical explanations for the Hebrew name of Beersheba (Genesis 21:30-31). Age-old renown and geographical location have conspired to make and keep it famous as a meeting and market place and administrative 39 40 RIVERS IN THE DESERT center. Excellent farm and grazing lands surround it. They are part of the elongated valley which rises imperceptibly eastward from the Mediterranean coast to the plain of Arad, beyond which a weird confusion of dessicated gullies plunges swiftly down to the Dead Sea. A single dry stream bed of many names and multiple branches but of undisturbed con- tinuity is drawn through its entire length like a shining thread through a drab sash. This band of good earth is bordered on the north by the abruptly rising Mountains of Judah and dissolves in the south into the broken hill-country of the continuation of the Negev, which is deeply pockmarked in places with lunarlike craters. This northernmost district was blessed with approxi- mately eight to six inches of rain annually. However meager that quantity is, it sufficed, together with the natural fertility of the loess soil of this basin, to support a chain of rich cities reaching eastward from Beersheba to Arad, not to speak of those extending westward from Beersheba to the sea. Like Megiddo and Taanach and Bethshan in the some- what similar valley of Jezreel and Esdraelon, memorial monu- ments in the form of a few massive tells testify to the rise and repeated reconstruction and final abandonment of some of the northernmost cities of the Negev in the course of the mil- lennia. There were others, however, of no less antiquity or importance, whose graves were not marked by tiered mauso- leums of their skeletal remains heaped up hill high. One of them was Khirbet Samra, whose character was completely obscure until recently. Another was Beersheba itself, whose name has remained faithful to its present position through all the ups and downs of good and ill fortune. It has generally been thought that the name of Beersheba came from a nearby ancient mound, about three miles to the east-northeast, called Tell Sab'a. One of the main periods of occupation there was from the nineteenth to the sixteenth centuries B.C., when permanent sedentary settlement seems to have been absent in the Negev. While it is very close to the \"REMEMBER THE DAYS OF OLD\" 41 border, it appears that Tell Sab'a should be regarded as one of the southernmost cities of Judah rather than as belonging to the Negev. Its strategic position was, to be sure, incompa- rably better than that of Beersheba, which has always been in the defenseless open, and in centuries of danger it may have served as its protective fortress. However, there were many cities of early periods in the Negev which were built without protective walls. To regard Tell Sab'a therefore as the founder of the older city of Beersheba is unwarranted and unfair. It makes an imposter out of an honest tell, which deserves the dignity of its own identity whatever that may originally have been. It is more likely that it was named after Beersheba, rather than the reverse. Paths from all directions and people of most diverse back- grounds and cultures have met in Beersheba from the start of the story of civilization. Its position, wells, soil and con- stantly renewed population have given it a deserved preemi- nence in the memories and annals of history. It was natural and perhaps inevitable that the census figures of its citizenry should have leaped from less than five hundred to approxi- mately forty thousand within the first decade of the existence of the modern state of Israel. The most direct route from Kadesh-barnea in Sinai led directly to it and to nearby Hormah. Travelers from Ezion- geber or from the oases of Arabia who were headed to the coastal cities of the Philistine Plain or to Jerusalem had per* force to pass through it. There must always have been heavy traffic from it to Beth-eglayim (Tell el-Ajjul), near the Medi- terranean and on the north side of the Wadi Ghazzeh, and constant intercourse with the cities in between them such as Gerar (Tell Abu Hureireh) and Sharuhen (Tell el-Far'ah). If you look at the map, you will see that the position of Kir-haresheth, the capital of Moab, is almost exactly parallel to that of Beersheba. The road eastward from Beersheba leads to the dominating mound of Tell Arad. It then de- scends the severe slopes beyond it to the shore of the Dead 42 RIVERS IN THE DESERT Sea, which is nearly thirteen hundred feet below sea level. A ford, still passable at the beginning of the twentieth cen- tury A.D., led to the peninsula of the Lisan on its east side. From there, you can still follow the clearly defined Roman road which climbs up to the massively fortified crag of Kerak (Biblical Qir-haresheth), on top of the high, broken, Moabite plateau. Or, leaving Tell Arad, you can journey southeast past the Judaean stronghold of Khirbet Ghazza, descend to the Dead Sea plain, skirt its south end, and then, after cross- ing the Wadi Arabah, ascend to the great mound of Edomite Bozrah or find your way to the fantastic mountain metropolis of Nabataean Petra. The spokes of many travel routes have always led to Beersheba. Life Underground Fairly early in the fourth millennium B.C., not long after people had learned how to store and cook food and carry water in pottery containers, a full-blown civilization was transplanted bodily to Beersheba and its surroundings. Whence it came, we do not know, at least not for certain. We may never find out why it came just then, although we can hazard an explanation. It has to do, as usual, more with con- quest than with climate, with increase in population rather than with decrease in rain. It was based on agricultural per- sistence, not nomadic happenstance, on the spread and skills of arts and crafts in urban centers in contrast to the limiting sameness and insufficiency and constant vagaries of an exclu- sively pastoral economy. This civilization was called Chalcolithic, and nowhere does the term apply more aptly than to Beersheba and its daughter towns. It designates the cultural epoch when copper and bronze were employed, preceding the use of iron. To quote the dictionary, the first part of the word is derived from the Greek chalkos, meaning copper, and the second part from the Greek lithikos, pertaining to stones* The brilliant excava* \"REMEMBER THE DAYS OF OLD\" 43 tions of Jean Perrot at one of several Chalcolithic suburbs of earliest Beersheba revealed the presence there of an advanced copper industry. This particular suburb is called Tell Abu Matar, and is located about a mile southeast of the old city of Beersheba, on the west or right bank of a bend of the Wadi Sab'a. It is reasonable to assume that if excavations were undertaken in Beersheba proper, where Chalcolithic pottery has been found, corresponding evidence of this Copper Age would be obtained. The catalogue of copper objects recovered at Tell Abu Matar is an impressive one, including some of the inevitable weapons with which every generation girds itself. In this instance, they consisted of pear-shaped, perforated maceheads, well designed for the breaking of skulls. The metal, out of which the finished products were fashioned, was compara- tively unalloyed, although not of the almost absolute purity of the Lake Superior nuggets which the American Indians sought out. It resulted apparently from the utilization of ores of high mineral content. They were crushed on large flint anvils, and, after a preliminary \"roasting/* were smelted in specially constructed clay furnaces and further refined in small pottery crucibles. The molten ore was poured then, apparently, into earthen moulds. It was a process handed down from age to age. The Bible suggests a similar one ex- ecuted about twenty-five centuries later by Hiram of Tyre, who was Solomon's master coppersmith. \"All the vessels which Hiram made for king Solomon in the temple of the Lord were of burnished copper. In the plain of the Jordan did the king have them cast, in thickened earthen molds, be- tween Succoth and Zarethan\" (I Kings 7:45-46; II Chronicles Tell Abu Matar obviously did not obtain its ores from the thick loess soil of the Beersheba basin, in which there are no mineral deposits, nor from Sinai, which would seem to have been too far away. The most likely source was the \"land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills you can dig copper\" 44 RIVERS IN THE DESERT (Deuteronomy 8:9), which is to be identified with the great rift of the Arabah. It may well be the same as the mysterious Valley of the Smiths with its City of Copper, which are glanc- ingly referred to in I Chronicles 4: 12-14. The first copper mine of King Solomon which we discov- ered on the northeast side of the Wadi Arabah, being at- tracted to it in part by its name, was called, in Arabic, Khir- bet Nahas, which means the Ruin of the Copper City. There, and at nearby Feinan, which is the Punon of Bi"
