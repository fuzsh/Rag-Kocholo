        "text": "To make use of the limited amounts of water in arid region, the Iranians developed man-made underground water channels called qanats (kanats) .In fact, qanats may be considered as the first long-distance water transfer system. Qanats are an ancient water transfer system found in arid regions wherein groundwater from mountainous areas, aquifers and sometimes from rivers, was brought to points of re-emergence such as an oasis, through one or more underground tunnels. The tunnels, many of which were kilometers in length, had designed for slopes to provide gravitational flow. The tunnels allowed water to drain out to the surface by gravity to supply water to lower and flatter agricultural land. Qanats have been an ancient, sustainable system facilitating the harvesting of water for centuries in Iran, and more than 35 additional countries of the world such as India, Arabia, Egypt, North Africa, Spain and even to New world. There are about 22000 qanats in Iran with 274000 kilometers of un...\n\nDuring history, many techniques have been developed to supply individuals as well as societies with the vital basic resource water. Humans in the industrialized regions of the “Western World” are simply unable to imagine a situation of severe water scarcity, due to the natural abundance and technique-supported availability of water. But within the vast belt of anticyclone dominated regions between the midlatitudes and the humid tropics, the absence of water is the common situation. Therefore, especially adapted techniques had to be invented to guarantee a secure water supply in order to survive within the hostile environment. One of these most impressing methods of water supply are qanats. Probably originating from the Iraq-Iranian borderland they spread globally. Even in the Mediterranean region their influence on societies and socio-economic development has become important throughout periods of time. According to the trend of increasing aridity the question arises whether to reactivate these ancient sustainable water resource.\n\nIn scattered areas of the Arabian Peninsula, beginning several centuries before the first Christian millennium and for several centuries after, public works efforts were mounted to convey water from mountain aquifers, via subsurface aqueducts, onto drier valleys and plains. These subterranean, gravity-driven filtration galleries, known generically as qanats, were transplanted across the Peninsula first by Persians, and later by others who borrowed their technology. Much scholarly work has been produced to account for their constructions in Iran, Oman, and many other countries throughout the world where qanats were eventually built. But this story of technological diffusion has been left with notable gaps. This paper offers a synthesis of the history of qanats from earlier studies, together with fresh evidence collected from 1993-1998 fieldwork in some of these 'gaps' in the northern and southern Peninsula. This collation offers evidence of three distinct pathways of diffusion of qanat technology from Persia across Arabia, and discusses the current use and future of qanats throughout the region."
