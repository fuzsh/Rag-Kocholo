Since its acceptance, I have worked to update the contents and add new information and references. My advisor was Prof. Yoram Tsafrir and I would like to thank him for his aid and encouragement in preparing and presenting this study. While attending a conference in Matera, Italy in 2005, I met David Davison and he suggested that I publish my dissertation in BAR Series. I would like to thank him for advice and encouragement in doing so. I appreciate the fact that his publication provides a great deal of important research material that is disseminated in research libraries throughout the world. I would like thank Prof. S. Thomas Parker and Prof. Yoram Tsafrir for recommending its publication in BAR Series. The material evidence used in the research of this paper is based on the work of a number of people employed by the Israel Antiquities Authority involved in the excavation and post-excavation process of projects carried out in recent years at Mampsis, Oboda and Mezad ‘En Hazeva. Thus, I would like to recognize, first and foremost, the encouragement and help I received from Dr. Dov Nahlieli, the director of the Southern Region in the Israel Antiquities Authority, and his part in promoting the excavations at Mampsis and Oboda, as well as my good friend, Dr. Yigal Israel, for kindly allowing me to make full use of the material from the excavation of the site of Mezad ‘En Hazeva. The work on the material from Mezad ‘En Hazeva, which was originally stored in the Israel Museum, was greatly facilitated by the help I received from Ms. Rebecca Cohen-Amin. Yeshayahu Lender assisted me in the precarious excavation of the smaller Late Roman vault in the cavalry camp at ‘En Hazeva in February 2003. Ms. Sharon Gal provided me with many helpful suggestions in regards to technical matters in preparing this paper. I would also like to thank Yaacov Bamgarten for his advice and kindness in providing me with books and articles as well as his assistance. The most important part of my research was based on the fine drawings of the pottery and other finds carried out by the late Yochi Kasabi (Mampsis) and Anna Dudin (Oboda). Shula Lavi skillfully reconstructed numerous vessels found at both sites and the photographers, Sando Mandrea, Clara Amit and Tzila Segiv carefully photographed both of the sites and many of the finds. Yochi Kasabi drew the plans and sections for the excavation of Building XII South at Mampsis and Vadim Essman and Slava Persky drew the plans of the Late Roman army camp at Oboda and the recent excavation of the small Roman military treasury vault at ‘En Hazeva. Avi Hajean drew the plans for the excavation of the Late Roman/Early Byzantine Quarter at Oboda. Natasha Zak was helpful in preparing the plans from Oboda for final publication. One of the most important aspects of the research was the study of coins found at all three sites. These were cleaned by the team of the IAA laboratory at Har Hotzvim in Jerusalem under the direction of Ella Altmark. The coins from Mampsis were studied by Mr. Robert Kool, who has also prepared a final report, and the coins from Oboda and ‘En Hazeva were studied by Helena Sokolov. The head of the IAA numismatics department, Dr. Donald Ariel, has provided me with aid and advice many times. Yael Goren-Rosen is currently preparing the reports on the glass objects found at all three sites. Her preliminary analyses and dating of the material have been a very important part of this research. Dr. Guy Bar-Oz from Haifa University is currently processing the animal bones found in the pantry in the Late Roman Quarter at Oboda. The late Professor Avraham Negev spent many hours working on and finally completing the translation of the Nabataean inscription found in the Late Roman Quarter at Oboda. During the excavations I was aided by several valuable people. These include my close friends, Yeshayahu (Paul) BenYa’akov at Mampsis and Larissa Shilov at Oboda. Haim Lavi served as my capable logistics manager at Oboda and Nir S. Paran was my field supervisor in the Late Roman Quarter at Oboda. The work at Mampsis and Oboda was also greatly facilitated by the aid and support of members of the National Parks Authority and particularly Nili Dvash, Orli Sarig and Ilan Kembel. I owe a great deal to my close friend and colleague, Dr. Benjamin J. Dolinka, for sharing with me his extensive knowledge of Nabataean and Late Roman ceramics. Moreover, Dr. Dolinka kindly offered to read and help to edit this volume as did vii\n\nDaniel and Barbara Gold of Herzliya, Israel. Mr. and Mrs. Gold very kindly volunteered their services in editing most of this volume and I am forever grateful. I would also like to acknowledge friends and fellow researchers from Israel and abroad for their encouragement and advice and input: Dr. Benjamin A. Saidel, Prof. S. Thomas Parker, Dr. Christopher Tuttle, Prof. Jodi Magness, Dr. Ina Kehrberg, Prof. David F. Graf, Dr. Haim Ben David, Dr. Zbigniew Fiema, Dr. David Johnson, Prof. Martha S. Joukowsky, Prof. Tina Niemi, Prof. John Oleson, Dr. Andrey Korjenkov, Dr. Walter Ward, Dr. Leah Di Segni, Dr. Ariel Lewin, Prof. Joseph Patrich, Shulamit Cohen, Arieh Roichman-Halperin, Flavia Sontag, Dr. Zeev Meshel and Dr. Hendrick Bruins. Finally, I would like to thank my parents-in-law, Dany and Clara Gini for the frequent hospitality in their home in Jerusalem, as well as my children: Liel, Aviel, Elore and Daniel, my mother Dorothy, and especially my husband, my heart, Moshe, for their patience and support.\n\nviii\n\nPreface\n\nWhen compared to the historical and archaeological documentation concerning the Negev in other periods, the Late Roman and Early Byzantine periods in this region (the second through early fifth centuries CE) have received relatively little attention on the part of researchers. However, the Late Roman period is a critical era that witnessed the cessation of international trade passing through the region while the Early Byzantine period is the formative period that preceeded the largest increase in population ever to have taken place there. The lack of scholarly attention focusing on this transformation is largely due to a paucity of primary historical sources about the region during the upheavals of the third century CE as well as a lack of archaeological data from the third through the early fifth centuries CE.\n\nthe second chapter a summary of archaeological research of the region under discussion, including surveys and excavations, will be presented. In chapters three through six the historical background in the early centuries of the first millennium CE will be presented together with historical and archaeological evidence pertaining to the region. In this section particular attention will be paid to economic, political and military developments in the eastern empire in general, and in the region under discussion. In the second part of this work, the material finds from sealed deposits found in recent excavations from Mampsis, Oboda and Mezad ‘En Hazeva will be presented and discussed in their archaeological and historical contexts. Attention will be directed to the ceramic evidence and the implications that this evidence holds with regard to demographic and economic developments in the region in the period under discussion. The ceramic assemblages examined here are of particular research value because they are “Pompeii-type” deposits found in primary contexts. These assemblages provide a rare window through which we may view the pottery vessels in use and in their relative amounts at the time of their deposition. Three such deposits will be examined in this paper. The first assemblage was uncovered in an abandoned kitchen pantry found in situ at Oboda, dated to the early third century CE. The second assemblage was discovered in rooms apparently destroyed by the earthquake of 363 CE at Mampsis, Oboda and the fort at ‘En Hazeva. The third assemblage was found in situ in a residential complex destroyed by an earthquake in the early fifth century CE at Oboda.\n\nThe purpose of this study is to examine the transformation that took place in the central Negev during the Late Roman and Early Byzantine periods by addressing the following questions: 1. What do existing historical records and past archaeological research tell us about the transformation that took place in the Negev and in neighboring regions during this period? 2. What can the material finds from recent excavations in the area, for the purposes of this study at Mampsis, Oboda, and Mezad ‘En Hazeva, provide to supplement that information? 3. What factors contributed to the greatest population increase and permanent settlement activity to have ever taken place in such an inhospitable desert environment as occurred in the Byzantine period between the fourth and the seventh century CE?\n\nFinally, I will examine and summarize the hypothesis that international trade through the Negev in the early centuries of the Christian era was replaced by interregional trade based on agricultural production starting in the fourth century CE, as well as the reasons that this transformation took place.\n\nPart One is made up of the following chapters: in the first chapter the geographical setting, including the geology, climate, hydrology and vegetation will be discussed. In\n\nix\n\nPart One Chapter One The Regional Environment\n\nland using run-off farming methods in the Byzantine and Early Islamic periods (Fig.1.4). In the western extremes of the area of this study, the landscape is dominated by a largely uninhabited tract of sand dunes, the Halutza and Shunra Dunes, extending from the area south of Nahal Be’ersheva into northern Sinai. The sand is the result of the erosion of granite mountains located in East Africa, washed down the Nile Valley and deposited in the Mediterranean Sea (Nahlieli 1999: 69). For millennia the sand was carried along the Mediterranean coast by strong currents and was blown into the area of the western Negev and northern Sinai. In the northern most area the dunes are stable; however, as one travels to the south and west the dunes are unstable and shift frequently during heavy winds. Some historical and archaeological evidence exists to suggest that since the sixth century CE the previously inhabited area of Rehovot in the Negev, Horvat Sa'adon and Halutza was inundated by unstable sand covering the area (Mayerson 1983: 250). The ancient track running past these towns connecting Be’ersheva and the oasis of Kadesh Barnea in northern Sinai, the proposed Biblical “Way of Shur,” fell out of use. In recent times the Ottoman railroad and the modern road were situated further south on the edge of the sand dunes.\n\nBoundaries and Borders The area dealt with in this study includes the arid region stretching from the Mediterranean coastal plain on the west and northwest to the Arava valley on the east. This area is physically cut off from the fertile coastal plain on the west by a largely uninhabited belt of shifting sand dunes, the Halutza and Shunra dunes (Fig.1.1). The western border touching the Sinai Peninsula is defined by the southern reaches of the Ramat Barnea ridge and Wadi El Arish. To the south and southeast the Ramon Crater formed a great physical obstacle to travelers and settlers in antiquity. The central Arava valley included in this study is bounded on the south by the Omer Ridge and on the north by the southern shore of the Dead Sea. The northern boundary of this study includes the part of the north central Negev as far as the Be’ersheva basin in the northwest and Mampsis and the ancient and modern routes leading towards the southern end of the Dead Sea on the northeast. Geology and Geomorphology The geological history of the Negev highlands was influenced primarily by two factors: first, its proximity to the Afro-Syrian Rift Valley and second, the deposition of sediments, mainly carbonates, over large areas of the region due to the presence of the Tethys Ocean in early geological periods (Benjamini 1979; Bruins 1986: 17-18), (Fig. 1.2).\n\nThe volatile geology of the area resulted in extreme differences in elevations as can be seen in the Dead Sea area, which at 400 meters below sea level is the lowest point on earth, and the mountainous area of the western Negev. In that region the highest elevations, such Har Loz and Har Ramon at 1000 meters above sea level, are located on the western edge of the largest of the three deep erosional cirques or craters, Ramon Crater. The drop in elevation between the highlands at this point and the bottom of the Ramon Crater is a dramatic 400-500 meters within the space of merely five kilometers (Scott 1977: 159,166).\n\nThe Negev highlands are located in close proximity to the Arabo-African craton that rifted apart in the Late Cenozoic period (Fig.1.3). A series of faults and asymmetric folds aligned northeast-southwest and east to west in an arc extending from the Euphrates River through Northern Jordan, Israel and the Sinai into Egypt was created between the Late Cretaceous and Tertiary periods. Associated folded anticlines in the Negev highlands rise steadily on the north-western side and drop off steeply on the south-eastern side, the geomorphology of which greatly influenced settlement patterns and agricultural activity in ancient times (Bruins 1986: 17-18). During the Quaternary loessial soil was deposited in the valleys and streambeds in this region, forming the basis for cultivable\n\nClimate Prior to the mid third millennium BCE the region of the southern Levant appears to have enjoyed a moister climate than at present (Goldberg and Bar-Yosef 1990: 84). Some researchers maintain that arid conditions have existed 1\n\nNabataean Settlement and Self-Organized Economy in the Central Negev: Crisis and Renewal.\n\nFigure 1.1. The Negev\n\nFigure 1.2.

The range of precipitation in the central Negev Highlands varies between 120 mm annually in the north to 75 mm in the southeast (Bruins 1986: 23). Precipitation in the Arava is much less, averaging 50 mm or less annually (Stern et al. 1986: 63).\n\nThe possibility that climatic change was responsible for the development of widespread agriculture and settlement in the Roman and Byzantine periods was first raised by E. Huntington who explored the central Negev in 1909 (Huntington 1911). Huntington believed that climatic cycles were the key to the ancient history of Israel and pointed to the florescence of the Negev in the Byzantine period as evidence of an increase in precipitation in ancient times. Since Huntington’s publication this particular issue has created controversy among researchers. There are those who claim that conditions in the Roman and Byzantine periods were wetter and colder until the end of the Byzantine period when the climate became much drier (Issar and Govrin 1991; Issar\n\nMeasurements of dew in the region indicate that the area north and east of the Negev Highlands receives annual amounts between 15-20 mm. This figure drops off drastically east and south of the central mountains and in the Arava amounts to only 1 mm or less (Stern et al. 1986: XIII). Dew in the central Negev Highlands occurs between 150-200 nights each year (Bruins 1986: 25). Evaporation is lower in the central Negev, between 2000-2600 mm annually, as compared to the area further east and south including the central Arava, between 2600-3200 mm annually (Stern et al. 1986: 66).\n\nand Makover-Levin 1995). Woolley and Lawrence questioned the validity of Huntington’s theory in wake of their survey of ancient towns from the Roman and Byzantine periods in the Negev (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915: 33). That survey revealed evidence that the inhabitants had gone to great lengths to procure water for drinking and agriculture and even for bathing facilities. W. F. Albright was one of the leading opponents of Huntington’s theory (Albright 1958: 108-111). He also emphasized the archaeological evidence of the procurement of water in the Negev as proof of the scarcity of water in that period. According to Albright, Huntington’s theories were misinformed, based on “false premises and on induction of wrongly observed facts” and he noted that Huntington had ignored contradictory archaeological evidence found in other parts of the Near East (Albright 1958: 109-111). At present, few researchers accept Huntington’s ideas, and more scientific evidence has accumulated to refute them. Studies on fluctuations in water levels in the Dead Sea point to a higher level of humidity in the first century BCE and first century CE followed by a more arid climate through the remainder of the first millennium (Rosen 2000: 55). The wet period in the Early Roman era peaked around 90 CE and conditions became increasingly drier by the third and fourth centuries CE (Bruins 1994: 307-308).\n\nAquifers Water in the central Arava, including ‘En Hazeva, is mainly acquired from water wells of exploit floodwaters derived from the Hazeva formation and the alluvial fill of the Arava valley. Here floodwaters of perennial streams are soaked up and flow in two separate basins underground: north towards the Dead Sea and south towards Eilat (Stern et al. 1986: XIV; Map 10.2). Numerous wells and springs are concentrated in a relatively small area located between the Nabataean site of Moyat 'Awad on the Petra-Gaza Route and ‘En Hazeva. The quality of water in the Arava valley is often poor with a high saline content (‘Drinking Water Under the Negev’, Teva Ha Dvarim 74:20). Water wells in the central Negev tap into the Judea Group, and the northwestern slopes of the highlands act as local replenishment areas with water flowing underground towards the Be’ersheva area (Stern et al. 1986: XIV; Map 10.2). Wells and springs in the central Negev Highlands are scarce. The main concentration of springs is located in the area of Nahal Zin near Sede Boqer (Nahlieli 1999:75) and in the northern Sinai in the Kadesh Barnea district. Water wells tap into areas with high water tables generally located in or next to large dry streambeds such as Nahal Nizzana and Nahal Be’erotayim, Nahal Shunra, Nahal Besor and Nahal Revivim. Major wells in these areas include the wells next to modern Mizpe Ezuz at Be’erotayim, Auja el-Hafir -Nizzana (ancient Nessana), Rehovot and Halutza (ancient Elusa). Two wells, located at Oboda and Rehovot, were excavated through at least 60 meters of bedrock in order to reach the water table, probably in order to provide water for the use of communal bathhouses in those communities during the Byzantine period (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915:55,131).1 The ancient settlements of\n\nThe present climate of the central Negev Highlands has been described as arid bordering on the hyper-arid zone of the inner desert of the Arava, southern Negev and Sinai Peninsula. Arid zone environments are described as regions in which the annual rainfall is between 80-150 mm in winter rainfalls, areas with interannual rainfall variability between 50% – 100%, have scattered vegetation, supports nomadic livestock and can support local rainfall-based agriculture only through rainwater harvesting techniques such as runoff farming (Bruins 1986: 4-5). Temperatures in the central Negev vary between an average of 12 degrees Celsius in mid winter to an average of 27 degrees C. in August. Temperatures in the Arava valley\n\nWater in the well at Oboda was measured at a depth of 70 meters in\n\n1\n\n4\n\nThe Regional Environment Mampsis and Sobota (Shivta) derived their water supply solely from the collection of winter rains into man-made catchments and cisterns.1 Vegetation The flora found in the area of the Halutza Sands and the Negev Highlands belong mainly to the SaharoArabian species. Vegetation in these areas is restricted to favorable locales such as crevices in rocks and ephemeral streambeds, and salt-resistant shrubs grow in areas with a high water table (Bruins 1986:26; Stern et al. 1986: XVI). Mediterranean Irano-Turanian flora is also found in the highlands and may be described as relics of wetter climates. In the Negev Highland foothills there is a cover of semi-shrubs, perennials and herbaceous annuals including cultivated cereals, depending on the yearly amount and distribution of rainfall. Sudanian species appear in the Arava valley due to that area’s high temperatures but are less common in the highlands and westwards (Stern et al. 1986: XIV-XVI). Archaeological research has provided some information about the types of domestic plants cultivated in the region in ancient times. Information dated to the sixth and seventh centuries CE found in the Nessana papyrus, Document 82, refers to domestic crops, mainly wheat, barley and a type of legume (aracus), while other papyri from the site indicate that grapes, olives and figs were also cultivated in the region around Nessana in that period (Mayerson 1962: 227-229).2 Winepresses dated to the Byzantine period have been found at Oboda, Sobota and near Elusa, and at least two caves at Oboda contained installations used to store and ferment wine (Negev 1988c: 29, 1997: 7; Mazor 1981: 53-54). Olive presses have been found at Oboda, Sobota and in the fort of Moyat 'Awad in the Arava (Rubin 1990: 91-92; Cohen 2000: 78). Summary Figure 1.5. Regional precipitation in millimeters per annum\n\nAn examination of the environmental factors affecting the region of this study indicates that it lacks most of the features that sustain permanent settlement activity, namely sufficient rainfall, arable soil and farmland, and plentiful natural sources of water in the form of rivers, springs and wells. The one area with numerous springs and wells of rather low quality, the central Arava valley, is located in\n\nan area with very high temperatures and high evaporation rates combined with a lack of arable soil. Arable soil in the central Negev, located mainly in man-made terraced wadis, probably suffered from a lack of fertilization that would have resulted in very low yields of crops (Bruins 1986: 91-92).\n\n1993. 1 The Colt Expedition, sponsored by New York University and the British School of Archaeology in Jerusalem, was forced to abandon their fieldwork at Shivta in the mid-1930s due to a lack of water. The expedition began to excavate the site of Auja el-Hafir, where water wells are located. The British cleaned out the south well there for use by the local Bedouins in the aftermath of a drought that lasted between 1936 -1939. The British also cleaned out and often partially rebuilt wells at other sites: Be’erotayim, Be’er Hafir, Be’er Resisim, Be’er Milcah, Be’erot Asluj, Be’er Yeroham and Be’er Halutza (Orion and Eini 1988:40). They also cleaned and rebuilt wells at Oboda and Rehovot. 2 A. Negev has suggested that the dates mentioned in the Nessana documents were probably not cultivated near the site but were brought there from the area of El-Arish (Negev 1988c: 29).\n\nIn addition, travel and communication through the region was hampered by extreme elevations between the Arava valley and the central Negev Highlands, as well as the existence of large natural craters: the Ramon Crater, the Large Crater, and the Small Crater. The dramatic topography of the Negev and Arava Valley had a direct impact on the location of roads and mountain passes.\n\nRegional precipitation in millimeters per annum\n\nHistorical and archaeological evidence indicates that until 5\n\n(Bruins 1986:23) Figure 1.5\n\nNabataean Settlement and Self-Organized Economy in the Central Negev: Crisis and Renewal. recent times the region was mainly inhabited by nomadic pastoralists. The first millennium CE, and particularly the Byzantine period (fourth – seventh century CE), were exceptions, when large permanent settlements and widespread agricultural activity took place.\n\n6\n\nChapter 2 Previous Research in the Central Negev and Central Arava Valley\n\nIntroduction\n\nof European explorers in the early nineteenth century. Ulrich Jaspar Seetzen was the first to explore and record Byzantine ruins in the Negev (Seetzen 1855, 1859; Schur 1992: 105). Seetzen appears to have visited only a few sites: Elusa (el-Khalasa), Rehovot in-the-Negev, Mampsis (Kalla el-Kurnub) and Nessana (Auja el-Hafir), which he mistook for Oboda (Negev 1988a: 9; Negev 1997: 10-11), (Fig. 1.6). Negev points out that Seetzen’s description of what he assumed to be Oboda includes large pools found at other sites such as Nessana, Subeita, Rehovot-in-theNegev, and Mampsis but not at Oboda (Negev 1997: 1011).\n\nIn this section I will provide an overview of the archaeological research in sites dated to the Hellenistic through Early Byzantine periods, which was carried out in the central Negev and central Arava in the nineteenth through early twenty-first centuries. This research includes visits by early explorers, exploration surveys, excavations, and systematic archaeological surveys. The first section describes sites discovered by Western explorers, usually led by local guides, in the nineteenth century. The second section reviews exploration surveys carried out mainly in the first half of the twentieth century by individuals and teams who provided detailed information about particular sites (usually the major towns in the central Negev) as well as smaller sites discovered along the major roads in the region. These roads and sites include the Darb es-Sultan, the Petra-Gaza road between Moyat 'Awad and Oboda, the road between the Dead Sea and Mampsis, the Ma’ale Tsafir route between Mezad Hazeva and Mampsis, and the fort in the central Arava at Be’er Menuha.\n\nSeetzen identified the site of Mampsis (Kurnub), which he visited on his way to Wadi Musa, as that of ancient Thamara (Seetzen 1855: 10-11, Pl.III). He also noted sites that he heard existed in the region such as Mischwepe (elMushrife/Mizpe Shivta?) Erbebe (Kh. Ruheiba/Rehovotin-the-Negev?), Audche (Auja el-Hafir?), Be’er Menuha, Sbetha (Sobata) and Minnieh (the identification of the last is unclear), (Seetzen 1855: 43-44).\n\nThe next section includes an overview of archaeological excavations carried out in the central Negev and central Arava. Because most excavations took place at sites located along major roads in the region (often by teams of archaeologists under the direction of Avraham Negev or Rudolph Cohen) this section is largely organized according to roads.In addition, this section includes major sites in the west central Negev and lone sites such as Be’er Menuha. These include excavations carried out along the Darb es-Sultan, the later Petra – Gaza route that connected Moyat ''Awad with Oboda by way of the Ramon Crater, Mampsis and sites along both the Dead Sea – Mampsis road, as well as along the road between Mampsis and Oboda and the Ma’ale Tsafir road between Mezad Hazeva in the central Arava and Mampsis.\n\nTwo separate parties visited the site of Mampsis (Kurnub) in 1837: Gotthilf Henrich von Schubert and Lord Lindsay (von Schubert 1839: 447-451; Lord Lindsay 1839: 46-47). Like Seetzen, both these travelers passed by the site on their way back from Petra. Lord Lindsay noted the ruins of the town and one of the large dams in the ravine of Nahal Mamshit. He believed that the site was that of Elusa marked on the Tabula Peutingeriana as a town on the road between Jerusalem and Aila. In 1838 Edward Robinson, accompanied by Elihu Smith, traveled through the Negev twice, visiting Be’ersheva, Elusa, Rehovot-in-the-Negev, Nessana (Auja el-Hafir), Bir Biren (Be’erotayim) and Ain el-Quderat in northern Sinai (Robinson 1841). The confusion in the names Auja and Abde led Robinson to the same conclusion that the ruins of ancient Nessana (Auja el Hafir) were those of Oboda in spite of the fact that the true location of ‘Abde/Oboda was still known to the local Bedouin and Arab travelers through the region (Robinson 1841: 560-561; Negev 1997: 11-12). Of his visit to Rehovot-in-the-Negev, Robinson writes that the ruins were surprisingly extensive and estimated that the site could have\n\nFinally, an overview of systematic archaeological map surveys of the central Negev, published by the Israel Antiquities Authority or in press, is presented here below. Nineteenth Century Explorers The earliest research in the Negev began with accounts 7\n\nNabataean Settlement and Self-Organized Economy in the Central Negev: Crisis and Renewal\n\nFigure 1.6. Towns and forts in the Central Negev and Arava Valley, Early Roman through Byzantine periods accommodated 12,000 to 15,000 people (Robinson 1841: 289-291). Robinson went by the site of Mampsis (Kurnub) on his return trip from Petra and although he did not examine\n\nthe site closely, he repeated Seetzen’s claim that it was the ancient site of Thamara described by Eusebius (Robinson 1841: 580-594, 613-616,622, n. 4). 8\n\nPrevious Research in the Central Negev and Central Arava Valley\n\na.\n\nb. Figure 1.7a. Oboda according to Palmer (1871; Negev 1997:12); and 1.7b. Musil (1907; Negev 1997:14).\n\nIn 1870-1871 E.H. Palmer, accompanied by C.F.T. Drake, were the first western explorers to visit and describe the ruins of Oboda, Sobota, and el Mishrefe (Mizpe Shivta), as well as Mezad Yeruham located on the road between Mampsis and Oboda (Palmer 1871: 29-32, 404-405), (Fig.1.7). At Rehovot, Palmer was impressed with the size of the town. He noted the existence of numerous cisterns and reservoirs, including the large open reservoir on the southwest side of the town, as well as the churches and the remains of ancient cultivation near the site (Palmer 1871: 383-385). Palmer apparently did not visit the site of Mampsis (Kurnub) but referred to it as the ruins of Thamara near Aroer and Arad (Palmer 1871:46, 75).\n\nThe Dominican Fathers Jaussen, Savignac, and Vincent visited Oboda in 1904. They too noted the existence of the large army camp outside the town, the impressive ruins of the acropolis and the surrounding town, and extensive caves which they believed to be the necropolis of the town (Jaussen et al. 1904:403-424;1905: 74-89,235-244), (Fig.1.8). They provided detailed plans and sections of the site, as well as the Late Roman tomb, ‘en-Nusra’, which they mistakenly believed to be the tomb of King Obodas (Jaussen et al. 1905:82-89). They also provided detailed reproductions of inscriptions and wall drawings made in red ocher, probably dating to the Byzantine period, that have nearly disappeared over the last century (Jaussen et al. 1905:78).\n\nTwentieth Century Exploration Surveys\n\nIn 1913, British archaeologists, L. Woolley and T.E. Lawrence made a detailed survey (including plans, photographs, and drawings of inscriptions) of the ancient towns in the central Negev (Figs.1.8-9). On the return leg of their trip, Woolley surveyed Oboda briefly, missing the army camp (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915: 9, 28, 93107, Pls.xxiii: 2-xxv). With the exception of the en-Nusra tomb, he did not survey the caves although he did raise the possibility that they were originally tombs reused for domestic purposes (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915: 23, Pl.xxiv:1; 99-100, Figs.27-30). Woolley also noted the ash heaps and pottery east of the town as well as the presence of Hellenistic period pottery at the site (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915: 95). He provided a highly accurate plan of the bathhouse that surpassed that of Musil (Negev 1997: 21). He also provided plans of a large wine press located south of the acropolis and described the structure as similar to one at Sobota but did not recognize its function (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915: 104-105).\n\nAlois Musil was the first to explore the ruins of Oboda (Eboda/Abde/Avdat 12813/02291)1 and the surrounding area in the twentieth century. He was also the first to provide highly accurate and detailed accounts, plans, and photographs of the sites he visited (Fig.1.7). Musil spent five days surveying the ruins of Oboda in 1902 on his way from Sobata. At Oboda, he described the bathhouse, the acropolis, the churches and the surrounding town and many of the extensive man-made caves that he identified as the town’s necropolis (Musil 1907:106-151). Musil was the first to document the army camp located northeast of the town (Musil 1907:122,124, plan, Figs.94, 98). He also discovered an important Greek inscription dated 294 CE on a lintel found in situ on a tower at the southern edge of the town (Musil 1907:246, n.15). Old Israel Grid (OIG) coordinates appear here, usually in ten digits, next to the name of each site at least once throughout the text. For large sites, these coordinates fall approximately at the center of each site.\n\n1\n\n9\n\nNabataean Settlement and Self-Organized Economy in the Central Negev: Crisis and Renewal\n\na.\n\nb.

Wiegand and a group of fellow German scholars surveyed Oboda in 1916. Wiegand accurately dated the Roman army camp as Diocletianic, and he suggested that the Nabataeans founded the town (Wiegand 1920: 87, Fig.82). He refuted Musil’s claim that the extensive complex of caves was a necropolis and remarked that\n\n(Wiegand 1920: 96).

Alt’s identification of Roman army sites, 1935\n\nNelson Glueck visited Oboda several times but never conducted a true survey of the town (Negev 1997: 23). In 1958-1959, prior to his involvement in excavating the site, Avraham Negev carried out a survey of the surface pottery in order to aid in the identification of the periods of occupation (Negev 1997: IX).\n\n106). In 1986, Yeshayahu Lender examined and recorded the remains of a Nabataean fort, several surrounding structures, and caves, while conducting a map survey of the area (Lender 1988: 66-67; Lender 1990: 32-36). The site is located approximately four kms southeast of Oboda on the banks of Nahal Avdat. It was constructed along the road between Oboda and the Borot Lotz area of northern Sinai (The Way of Atharim). The fort measures 17.5×17.5 m. and consists of seven casemate rooms situated around a central courtyard.\n\nGlueck also surveyed sites along the early Petra-Gaza road, the Darb es-Sultan (the King's Road). According to Glueck, this was a major road in use from the Chalcolithic period between the central Negev and the copper mines in Wadi Feinan (Punon), (Glueck 1960: 8). He noted the presence of large campsites and ceramic sherds from the Intermediate Bronze Age and the Iron Age II period as well as Nabataean sherds at intervals along the track. He described the Darb es-Sultan as running parallel to Wadi Murrah (Nahal Zin) from Sede Boqer and then southeast to 'En Orohot (the Spring of the Caravans). From there it continued along Wadi Merzebah down to 'Ain Kharuf ('En Rahel) and 'Ain Wehbeh ('En Yahav) from whence it met a direct track across the Araba to Feinan, connecting with the King's Highway in the Edomite hills further east (ibid., 8, 12). At 'En Rahel, Glueck mistook Nabataean Early Hellenistic pottery sherds for Iron Age II ceramics by Glueck at 'En Rahel, a mistake later repeated by Rothenberg.\n\nHorvat Ma'agurah (12601/03063), a Hellenistic Nabataean site located six km northwest of Oboda on the Petra – Gaza road, was first discovered and recorded by Emmanuel Anati in 1953 and it was revisited and noted by Rudolph Cohen in 1965 (Cohen 1988-1989b: 64). The Petra – Gaza Road between Moyat 'Awad and Oboda The site of Moyat ''Awad (16528/99465) located in the central Arava Valley south of Mezad Hazeva, was built along the ancient Petra-Gaza road (Figs.1.10). Frank first discovered the site in 1934 but mistakenly identified the Nabataean caravansaerai as a Roman fort (Frank 1934: Plan 30: B). Alt suggested that the site was that of ancient Asuada, preferring to designate the site of Bir Madkur on the eastern side of the Arava as Mo'a recorded in the Beer Sheba Edict and the Madaba mosaic map (Alt 1935: 2-59), (Fig. 1.11). Nelson Glueck later surveyed the site\n\nIn 1959, Yohanan Aharoni discovered an Iron Age structure and other building remains (site 142) at Mezad Nahal Avdat (12280/01810), (Aharoni and Evenari 1960: 10512\n\nPrevious Research in the Central Negev and Central Arava Valley\n\na.\n\nb.

Abel and later, Avi-Yonah, suggested that the site should be identified as that of Mo'a of the Madaba Map, This identification was not universally accepted and their proposal was only confirmed following the recent processing of the finds discovered in subsequent excavations by Cohen (Abel 1938: 181-182; Avi-Yonah 1953: 129-156). The site was included in Rothenberg’s survey of the Arava and later Negev visited here (Rothenberg 1967: 130-132; Negev 1966: 89-98). My recent preparation of the final pottery report of excavations at this site has revealed that no Byzantine pottery was present, making its identification as Mo'a of the Madaba Map and the Beer Sheba Edict untenable. The true site of Mo'a is probably Bir Madkur as suggested by Alt.\n\nand Tsafrir 1974: 30-40). The surveyors also reported the existence of at least two milestones north of Oboda on the track between Oboda and Horvat Ma'agurah (Meshel and Tsafrir 1974: n.46). Notably, these milestones were reportedly bore Latin and Greek inscriptions, with the Greek inscriptions applied in red paint. Mampsis and Sites along the Mampsis – Dead Sea Road Musil visited Mampsis (Kurnub 15603/04827) in 1901 on his way from Hebron to Abde (Oboda), (Musil 1907: 1728, Figs. 10-13), (Fig.1.13). He described the ruins of the town, including the city wall and both churches, as well as the dams in the ravine of Nahal Mamshit. Hartmann was among the first to propose that the site was actually that of Mampsis, an identification which was eventually accepted (Hartmann 1913: 110-113).\n\nIn 1934 Frank discovered other Nabataean/Roman sites along the road connecting Moyat ''Awad with Oboda, by way of the Ramon Crater. These sites included Kh. Qasra (Qasr el-Abd/Qal’at Umm Quseir 158281/99676), Mezad Neqarot (Qasr Wadi es Siq 15096/99838) and Mezad Sha’ar Ramon (Qasr el Mahale 14393/00163), (Frank 1934: Plan 30: A; 273: pl.29; 273). A first century CE Nabataean fort, Mezad Har Massa (15493/99759), was found northwest of Kh. Qasra by Cohen’s team (Cohen 1983b: 69).\n\nIn 1933, Iliffe carried out a survey of sites containing Nabataean painted fineware sherds. These he discovered at Mampsis, Elusa, Nessana, and Tell Be’ersheva (Iliffe 1933: 133-134). Iliffe did not visit Oboda, which was too far from his itinerary (Negev 1997: 23). During his archaeological survey of Eastern Palestine in 1934, Nelson Glueck visited Mampsis. He noted the dams in Nahal Mamshit, the walled town and churches as well as masses of Nabataean, Roman and Byzantine pottery sherds found at the site (Glueck 1935: 113-115).\n\nKirk first noted the tower of Mezad Ma’ale Mahmal (14296/01098), (Kirk 1938: 231-234). Meshel and Tsafrir carried out a comphrehensive survey of the route between Sha’ar Ramon and Oboda, including Mezad Sha’ar Ramon, Mezad Ma’ale Mahmal, and Mezad Grafon (13894/01496), (Meshel and Tsafrir 1974). They provided detailed descriptions and plans of both forts and the arched cistern next to Mezad Ma’ale Mahmal (Meshel and Tsafrir 1974: 40-53), (Fig. 1.12). They also discovered several milestones at intervals along the road in the Ramon Crater and on the Nafha Heights southeast of Oboda (Meshel\n\nMampsis was included in the Archaeological Survey of Palestine in 1937-1938 directed by Kirk (Kirk 1938: 213-221). He described the features of the site, including recent damage to the East Church and other structures, reporting the removal of their stones in order to facilitate the construction of the British Police building overlooking the site. He also identified a cemetery a kilometer northeast of the town, probably the Nabataean necropolis later excavated by Negev. Kirk noted architectural differences 13\n\nNabataean Settlement and Self-Organized Economy in the Central Negev: Crisis and Renewal\n\nFigure 1.13 Mampsis according to Musil and Woolley (Wooley and Lawrence 1914-15). Mezad Hazeva and the Ma'ale Tsafir Route\n\nbetween Mampsis and the Byzantine period remains at S’baita (Sobota) and Auja Hafir (Nessana), prompting him to (accurately) suggest a Roman date for many of the buildings at Mampsis, excluding the churches. Kirk’s survey also took in Mezad Tamar (Kirk 1937: 221-225).\n\nMusil was the first to publish a plan of the site of Mezad Hazeva (‘En el Husb 17325/02436) in the central Arava Valley (Musil 1907: 207-209, Figs.114-145). In addition to the large Iron Age fortress, Musil also identified the bathhouse and other structures east of the fortress. In 1932 Frank visited the site of Mezad Hazeva (Frank 1934: 254255). Glueck visited it in 1934 and he suggested that the large structure at the site was a caravanserai erected by the Nabataeans that continued in use under the Romans. He identified the site as that of Eiesiba (Glueck 1935: 1720,115). Aharoni proposed that the site should be identified as the Biblical site of Tamar and the classical period site of Thamara mentioned in ancient sources (Aharoni 1963: 30-42).\n\nIn 1932, Frank was the first to survey Mezad Tamar, (Qasr el Juheiniye 17301/04848) a Roman fort located 12 miles east of Mampsis (Frank 1934: 257). Alt identified this site, whose Arabic name is Qasr Juheniya el-Fuaqa, with that of Thamaro/Thamara referred to in ancient sources. Gichon, the excavator of this site, accepted this identification, but most scholars it reject in favor of Mezad Hazeva (Alt 1935: 58; Aharoni 1963; Gichon 1976; Isaac 1992: 193). Kirk surveyed the site in 1937 (Kirk 1938: 221-225). Mezad ‘En Tamar (18308/04449) located at the foot of a hill near ‘En Tamar (Ain Arus) and Nahal Zin, on the southwest bank of the Dead Sea, consists of a small structure identified as a fort. It was first discovered by Frank in 1934 (Frank 1934: 259). It was noted again by Kirk and later by Rothenberg who proposed that the site was that of Thamaro/Thamara referred to in ancient sources (Kirk 1938: 224; Rothenberg 1967a: 162; 1971: 214).\n\nThe series of small forts situated along this road by way of Ma’ale Tsafir (also known as the probable biblical site of the Scorpions Ascent), linking the central Arava with the northern Negev from ‘En Hazeva to Mampsis, were first noted by E. Robinson (Robinson 1841: 178-181). Glueck also visited these sites and found and published a fourth century CE lamp discovered at Qasr es Sfar 14\n\nPrevious Research in the Central Negev and Central Arava Valley\n\nFigure 1.14a. Plan of Elusa (Negev 1988c:115)\n\nFigure 1.14b. Plan of the theater Elusa (Negev 1988c:117) visited Elusa (Khalasa/Halutza 11705/05641) in 1905 and noted the discovery of epitaphs belonging to the Roman and Byzantine periods (Jaussen et al. 1905: 254-257; Abel 1909: 89-166). Woolley and Lawrence visited the site in 1914 and drew an accurate plan, a fact that has recently been studied and discussed (Saidel and Christopherson 2005). They recognized that the town was the ancient Nabataean site of Elusa, located on the main Petra-Gaza route. They also made the important discovery of one of the earliest known Nabataean inscriptions, Aretas, king of the Nabatu, written in Aramaic script and dated to the period before 150 BCE (A. Cowley in Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915: 109, 145-146, Fig.59), (Fig. 1.14). They, and a number of researchers, reported the fact that the town was being stripped for building stone transported to Gaza. The proximity of the site to the western Negev and Gaza, and from 1900, the newly established town of Beer Sheba, ensured its destruction as a source of building stone (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915: 108-109; Bereslavsky 1940: 233-234). According to Yosef Bereslavsky, the inhabitants of Gaza, Beer Sheba, Deir el-Balah, Khan Yunis, Raphia and el-Arish, and not the local Beduin, were responsible for stripping ancient towns of their stone and contractors roved the western Negev buying up building stones to be transported to Beer Sheba and towns along the coast.\n\nFigure 1.14c. Early Nabatean inscription from Elusa (Wooley and Lawrence 1914-15: 59) (Mezad Tsafir 16032/03682), (Glueck 1935: 115-116). Harel described the route in some detail (Harel 1957). In his study of stepped roads in Roman Palestine, Kloner has suggested that the steps hewn in the ascent probably date to the second century CE (Kloner 1973: 256-257, 1998: 127). The route was again surveyed by Cohen’s team in 1982 on behalf of the Israel Dept. of Antiquities (Cohen 1983c: 65-67). Mezad Be’er Menuha This Nabataean/Roman site is located in the south central Arava near the well of Be’er Menuha (Bir Muleiha 16274/96873). Rothenberg reported the remains of a “Nabataean” tower at the site during his survey in 1960 and noted that the site was probably a major station on the Darb Ghaza road between Gaza and the Red Sea (Rothenberg 1971: 217).\n\nWoolley and Lawrence discovered the remains of the Iron Age fortress at the site of Qasr Ruheiba (11022/05020) in 1914 (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915: 40-41, Fig. 3), (Fig. 1:15, upper). Remains of a Nabataean fort were found over the Iron Age remains by Yigal Israel in 1976 during the excavation of the site under the direction of Cohen (1976b: 60).\n\nSites in the West Central Negev This area is located in the plains west of the central Negev Highlands in a region that appears to have been heavily cultivated around the centers of Elusa, Rehovot-in-theNegev, Sobota and Nessana in the Byzantine period.\n\nAt Rehovot-in-the-Negev (Kh. Ruheiba 10847/04895), Musil identified and documented a bathhouse and briefly noted some features of the town including what he believed to be a town wall (Musil 1907: 64-70), (Fig. 1.15). The detailed description and plans of the bathhouse became\n\nThe Dominican priests, Jaussen, Savingnac and Vincent, 15\n\nNabataean Settlement and Self-Organized Economy in the Central Negev: Crisis and Renewal\n\nFigure 1.15b. Kh. Ruheibeh/Rehovot in-the-Negev according to Musil (1907) detail (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915: 72-91). They noted the large double cistern in the middle of the town as well as the three churches, and they also described several private dwellings.\n\nFigure 1.15a. Qasr Ruheibeh (Wooley and Lawrence 1914-15: Fig. 3) especially important since this it was later destroyed, possibly around World War I. The ruins of a well house built during the British Mandate now occupy the site (Tsafrir 1988: 7, Ill.9). During their visit to Rehovot-inthe-Negev\n\nMusil briefly visited the site of el-Mishrefa (Mizpe Shivta 11272/03651) in 1901 and noted that it was fortified with a wall, gate, and towers situated along the west side of the site. He also noticed the small, monoapsidal church and cave dwellings along the eastern perimeter (Musil 1908 44-45, Fig. 34). Woolley and Lawrence also surveyed the site and accurately identified it as that of a monastic community (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915: 91-95). The site was visited in 1916 by Wiegand’s team from the Committee for the Preservation of Ancient Monuments from the Turkish-German Headquarters.\n\nin 1913, Woolley and Lawrence identified several churches, including the central church in the middle of the town and the northern and southern churches. They also noted the large open cistern near the bathhouse and the bathhouse well that they described as 100 ft. in depth (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915: 113-117).\n\nHuntington surveyed the site of Nessana (Auja el-Hafir/ Nizzana 09591/03174) in 1909 and drew up the only known plans of the lower town prior to its destruction by the Turks in that period. He reported the remains of two parallel colonnaded streets, six hundred meters in length (Huntington 1911: 121). By the time of Woolley and Lawrence’s survey in 1913, the colonnaded streets were no longer visible (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915 117), (Fig.1.16). They noted that the town was not very large, and the similarity between the Byzantine fortress on the acropolis at the site and that of Oboda’s from the same period.\n\nMusil visited and described the village of Kh. Sa'adi (Horvat Sa'adon 11251/04881), (Musil 1907: 78-79). In 1912, T. Kuhtreiber retraced Musil’s journey through this area touring Sa’adi and other sites in the region (Kuthreiber 1914: 15). Woolley and Lawrence continued their survey in that area, also noting the village south of Rehovot (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915: 112-113). In 1916, Wiegand and his team visited Rehovot where he refuted Musil’s claim that the town was surrounded by a wall, remarking that the houses along the outer edge of the town formed a kind of closed front instead (Wiegand 1920: 57-61). In 1933 Iliffe was the first to discover Nabataean and Hellenistic pottery in Elusa (Iliffe 1934: 132-134).\n\nWoolley and Lawrence also documented Byzantine agricultural and settlement remains south of Nessana on the road to Beraein (Be’erotayim/Bir Birein 09911/02300) and Kossaima in northern Sinai (Woolley and Lawrence 1914-1915: 121).\n\nMusil surveyed Sobota (Isbeita/Shivta 11450/03238) in July 1901 and he produced the first general plan of the 40 acre site with several of its main buildings (Musil 1907: 36-45). In 1905 Jaussen’s team visited Sobota. They were the first to discover the Byzantine cemetery located outside of the town and a Nabataean inscription dated to the reign of Aretas IV (9 BCE – 40 CE), (Jaussen et al. 1905: 256-257). Woolley and Lawrence were sufficiently impressed with the remains of the town to describe it in\n\nGlueck surveyed one site, Khirbet Hafir (Be’er Hafir 1095/1035), which he described as an “extremely large Nabataean settlement” located a few kilometers east of Beraein, (Glueck 1955b: 21-22, 1956:23). To date, the identification of this site has yet to be confirmed. 16\n\nPrevious Research in the Central Negev and Central Arava Valley\n\nFigure 1.16. Woolley and Lawrence’s visit to Auja/ Nessana (Wooley and Lawrence 1914-15: Fig. 52)\n\nFigure 1.17.

Colt’s team carried out limited excavations at Oboda and extensive excavations at Sobota and Nessana.\n\nNegev was appointed to supervise on site work under AviYonah’s supervision in 1958, and in 1959 he took over the project (Negev 1997: X). Negev carried out excavations throughout the site between 1958-1961and in 1989. The results of these excavations were published in many small articles and in two books: The Late Hellenistic and Early Roman Pottery of Nabatean Oboda (Negev 1986) and The Architecture of Oboda (Negev 1997), (Fig. 1.17). Negev’s work at the site concentrated on areas of the acropolis such as the two Byzantine churches, the Byzantine Citadel and a structure inside the temenos area that he identified as a temple. This last structure was the same “Hellenistic Building” studied by the Colt Expedition (Negev 1997: 24-38). Negev also studied the western side of the temple platform and adjoining structures (Negev 1997: 38-61). During the course of these excavations several important Nabataean and Greek inscriptions were discovered. These inscriptions date to two primary periods: the late first century BCE and the second half of the third century CE. The earliest inscription dates to the second regnal year of Aretas IV, 8/7 BCE (Negev 1997: 3). Eight Greek inscriptions that appear to have been engraved on the lintel over the main entrance to the platform portico date to the later phase of the temple in the third century. These include a dedicatory inscription dating to 267/8 CE. Although the inscriptions are written in the Greek language, the names of the worshippers appear to be Nabataean (Negev 1997: 53). Near the southeastern corner of the portico a small\n\nOboda and the Surrounding Area At Oboda (Eboda/Abde/Avdat) the Colt Expedition excavated an isolated ‘villa’ located south of the town, but they never published their results.The plans and a description of this structure were later published by Negev, who dated it (on the basis of architectural features) to the second and third centuries CE (Negev 1997: 73-79). The Colt Expedition also excavated and published a structure located between the South Church and the Byzantine Citadel, described as a “Hellenistic building” (Colt 1962: 45-47, Pl.LXVIII, Negev 1997: 24-25). P.L.O. Guy reported that the expedition carried out some preliminary work on the bathhouse that was left unfinished (Guy 1938: 13). Between the years 1958 and 1961, Avi-Yonah and Negev, sponsored by the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, directed excavations at Oboda in conjunction with the restoration project instigated by the National Parks Authority. This work produced a large quantity of important Nabataean 17\n\nNabataean Settlement and Self-Organized Economy in the Central Negev: Crisis and Renewal early fine ware discovered in the structure and elsewhere at Oboda, as \"Nabataean Sigillata,\" proved to be a form of Eastern terra sigillata, called ETS II by Gunneweg and Cypriote Sigillata by Hayes (Gunneweg et al 1988, Hayes 1977). The fact that the pottery workshop abuts a second to third century CE caravanserai (see below) on the north and a heavy midden on the south cast serious doubts about the dating of the structure to the early first century CE. A recent study by Fabian and Goren (2008) refutes Negev's identification of the structure as pottery workshop. Between 1975-1977, Negev, sponsored by the Hebrew University at Jerusalem, carried out joint excavations with R. Cohen from the Israel Department of Antiquities. They carried out trial excavations in the large military camp located northeast of the acropolis, a structure identified as a caravanserai south of the military camp, and a fourth century CE farmhouse complex east of the town (Cohen and Negev 1976: 55-57; Negev 1977a: 27-29; 1997: 7). The final report of the excavations has not yet been published (Negev 1997: XI). However, some preliminary findings were published by Cohen (Cohen 1980a: 44-46). Negev subsequently claimed that the military camp was constructed by the Nabataeans and functioned in the first century CE, a conclusion not shared by Cohen (Cohen 1982a: 45).\n\nFigure 1.18. The caravanserai at Oboda, 2nd-3rd c. CE (Cohen 2000: 94). space was discovered, which appears to have served as the temple treasury. An inscription, engraved on a marble plaque found in the southwestern staircase tower, records the names of three of Aretas’ IV children (Negev 1961: 127128, 1997: 51). In addition, a hoard of bronze figurines and other objects were also found in this area (Negev 1997: 51, Rosenthal-Heginbottom 1997: 192-202).\n\nAccording to Cohen, the caravanserai found abutting the pottery workshop on the eastern side of the site dates to the second and third century CE. This structure measures 22.5 by 31 m. and is made up of a series of rooms located around a central courtyard. This structure was rich in ceramic finds and particularly Nabataean painted ware bowls and other vessels dated to the early third century. Cohen pointed out that these bowls, which appear to be a debased version of the Nabataean fine ware tradition in decoration, form and texture, are identical to a bowl found next door in the pottery workshop, dated by Negev to the early first century CE, and in the Nabataean necropolis at Mampsis. Coins found on the floors of the structure included several dated to the late second through the third quarter of the third century CE. Above the collapse layer of the caravanserai at least 80 coins dated to the second half of the fourth c. CE were found (Cohen 1982a: 4546), (Fig. 1.18). During the 1975 excavations, Negev discovered a large house dated to the first century CE less than 100 meters from the military camp. Sixteen rooms of this structure were cleared. At least one room served as a kitchen with large ovens. Negev, impressed with the fact that several small cubicles were found throughout the structure and the poor quality of the architecture, claimed that the structure was probably a tavern or hostel (Negev 1996: 83-84). Elsewhere at the site, a pouch with coins and semi-precious stones from the region of the Indian Ocean were found in graves dated to the early first centuries of the first millennium CE (Negev 1977a: 29).\n\nNegev also excavated buildings that he described as the ‘Roman Quarter’ located south of the acropolis, including the Roman tower first discovered by Musil in 1902, the enNusra burial cave, the Byzantine bathhouse, a Byzantine dwelling and the Saints’ Cave located below the acropolis. Inscriptions from the Roman tower and the en-Nusra burial cave were of particular importance in reconstructing the history of the site. This inscription, engraved on the lintel of the entrance into the tower, dates to 293/4 CE and describes the builder as a Nabataean mason named Wa’il from Petra (Negev 1981a: 26-27, no. 13). Inscriptions found in the en-Nusra burial cave date to the mid third century and according to Negev they appear to relate exclusively to women buried there. The earliest inscription dates to July 23, 241 CE (Negev 1981a: 24-25, no.10). On the eastern edge of the site, Negev excavated a pottery workshop that he believed to have functioned between 25 BCE to around 50 CE (Negev 1974, 1986: XVII). He reported that only two coins were found in the structure. The first dates to the reign of Trajan and the second I dated generally to the third or fourth centuries CE (Negev 1986: XVIII). Contrary to Negev's initial belief that Nabataean fine painted wares were produced in this workshop, subsequent neutron activation analysis of the posttery has indicated that it was produced in or near the area of Petra (Gunneweg et al 1988: 342). Likewise, Negev's designation of another example of\n\nIn the same excavation season, a large structure located east of the “Roman Quarter” (the Byzantine town) was 18\n\nPrevious Research in the Central Negev and Central Arava Valley also investigated. This structure proved to be a farmhouse complete with a finely constructed wine press and cooking facilities dated to the fourth and fifth centuries CE. Negev reports that the building appears to have been built over an earlier Nabataean structure. Pieces of a large stone libation altar bearing a Nabataean inscription were found in the courtyard of the building. In a room next to the winepress two large jars were found sunk into the floor, which Negev believed to have been used to store wine that may have been tasted before its purchase by buyers. Elsewhere in the building plaques made from camel bones were found bearing lines of Greek script written in ink. One inscription apparently contains receipts concerning the hiring of camels and donkeys for transporting grapes from nearby vineyards (Negev 1977a: 28). Further excavations were carried out at Oboda in the 1990s by archaeologists of the Israel Antiquities Authority. These include excavations by Katz and Tahal in structures in the ‘Roman Quarter” and the excavation by Tahal of the large Byzantine period winepress located next to the southern side of the acropolis and Saints’ Cave (Tahal 1994: 112114). The exterior of the bathhouse and the pools next to the bathhouse well were excavated by Tahal in 1992 (Tahal 1994: 114-115). The excavation of the well area was resumed by Erickson-Gini in 1993. The area around the pool produced evidence that the bathhouse and the well were constructed in the fourth century CE and continued in use, after substantial renovations due to earthquake damage, in the Byzantine period. The earthquake probably occurred in the early fifth century CE, and damage related to it was detected elsewhere in the site.\n\nFigure 1.19. The 1999 excavation of the army camp at Oboda (Erickson-Gini 2002: 123) of the household left intact, possibly as the result of an epidemic that struck the town in the first half of the third century CE. Three rooms of a second structure appear to belong to a large villa dating to the first century CE located on the eastern edge of the excavation area (Erickson-Gini 2001a: 6; 2001b: 374-375). The Nabataean fort, Mezad Nahal Avdat, (12280/1810), measuring 17.5×17.5 m., was excavated in 1986 by Y. Lender (Lender 1988: 66-67), (Fig. 1.21). Nabataean pottery dated to the first and second centuries CE. An ostrakon in Nabataean script and a coin of Trajan were found in the fort. Near the fort a second building measuring 10×13.5 was excavated, producing pottery dated to the first century CE.\n\nIn 1993-1994, P. Fabian, of the Israel Antiquities Authority, excavated a domestic dwelling in the ‘Roman Quarter,’ Building “T,” and he conducted several trial excavations along the town wall east of the acropolis. Fabian’s work demonstrated that the structures in the area described by Negev as the “Roman Quarter” dated to the Byzantine period. He also discovered that Building “T” was destroyed by a devastating earthquake in the early seventh century that demolished the entire site of Oboda (Fabian 1996).\n\nThe site of Horvat Ma'agurah (the Ruin of the Resevoir) is a Hellenistic Nabataean courtyard structure, probably a caravanserai, located west of Oboda at a point overlooking Nahal Besor and the Petra-Gaza road. It is the largest Nabataean site between Oboda and Elusa (Fig.1.22). Soundings were carried out by Meshel and Cohen in 1970 and it was later excavated more extensively as part of Cohen’s map survey of the area in 1985 and 1987 (Cohen 1985: 76-78; Cohen 1988b: 64-65; Cohen 2000: 95-96). The earliest coins of the site include a Tyrian coin of the second to first centuries BCE and a coin of Aretas II (11096 BCE). A heavy decorated pestle made of alabaster, probably ceremonial in nature that may have been brought from southern Arabia, was discovered in the vicinity of the courtyard. The caravanserai is a rectangular shaped structure, 22×40 m., with rooms situated around a large, open courtyard. Wide stairs lead down to a rock cut cistern located inside the central room of the southern side of the caravanserai. Access to the staircase was later blocked,\n\nIn 1999, the military camp east of the town, previously excavated by Negev and Cohen, was excavated extensively by Fabian and Erickson–Gini, revealing over fifty percent of the total area of the camp (Fig.1.19). Results of the excavation indicate that the camp was a Roman military camp and not Nabataean as proposed by Negev (EricksonGini 2002), (Fabian 2001: 18; 2005). Further excavations were carried out by the author in a domestic quarter in Oboda dating to the fourth century CE that was destroyed in an earthquake sometime in the early fifth century CE (Fig.1.20). In addition, remains of two earlier structures were found on the eastern side of the quarter. One structure dates to the second and early third centuries CE and it appears to have been abandoned abruptly with the contents 19\n\nNabataean Settlement and Self-Organized Economy in the Central Negev: Crisis and Renewal\n\nFigure 1.20.

The small fort with corner towers, measuring 21×21 m., was constructed in the courtyard of the caravanserai. In one of the towers, a plastered bathtub and water storage installation were uncovered (Cohen 1988b: 64). A recent examination of the pottery discovered inside the fort, as well as an analysis of the bath by the author, has revealed that the fort was built by the Hasmoneans around 100 BCE. A relatively large number of Koan or imitation Koan wine jars were discovered inside the fort, similar to those found at Nessana. A coin of Aretas IV (9 BCE – 40 CE) and Herod the Great (37 – 4 BCE) and Nabataean pottery of the late first century BCE and early first century BCE are indications that the site was reoccupied by the Nabataeans in the later part of the first century BCE. It does not appear to have been inhabited at all beyond the reign of Aretas IV. The Roman milestones discovered along between Horvat Ma'agurah and Oboda may be attributed to the Roman military unit stationed in the Diocletianic army camp at Oboda. Coins dated to the late third and mid-fourth centuries CE were discovered by Y. Israel outside the caravanserai.\n\nMoyat 'Awad with the Negev Highlands through a rugged area east and north of the Ramon Crater. The site of Moyat 'Awad was excavated extensively between 1981-1985 by Cohen (Fig.1.24). Excavations were carried out in six areas. The earliest remains at the site are that of a Hellenistic Nabataean fort, probably constructed in the third century BCE, measuring 17×17 meters. It is identical to the fort constructed further north at ‘En Rahel (16623/00470) in the same period. The earliest coins found at the site are those of Alexander the Great and Philip III (336-323 BCE). Several Ptolemaic coins were discovered in the fort, as well as coins dated to the mid-second century BCE minted in the Phoenician city of Aradus. The fort was reoccupied in the late first century BCE and appears to have been in use until the early third century CE. During its latest occupation, the fort appears to have been utilized as a kind of emporium and the structure was filled with vessels stacked in the rooms situated around the courtyard. In this period the fort may have served as a perfume production site. Numerous mortars and pestles were discovered here, as well as an olive press used to press olives grown in irrigated fields north of the site. This evidence suggests that perfume production took place in the structure in the late second through early third century CE (Erickson-Gini, f.c.).\n\nMoyat 'Awad and the Early Petra – Gaza Road In the 1980s, Cohen’s teams excavated Moyat 'Awad (popularly and erroneously called Mo'a) and a series of small forts located at ‘En Erga, ‘En Rahel and ‘En Ziq. They were constructed in the Hellenistic period by the Nabataeans on what appears to be the earliest Petra – Gaza Road, the Darb es-Sultan (Fig. 1.23). This road connected\n\nOn the plain below the fort a large caravanserai, 40×40 m. in size, appears to have been constructed in the first century CE and it continued to be occupied in the second century CE. (Cohen 1981: 36-48; Cohen 2000: 76). 21\n\nNabataean Settlement and Self-Organized Economy in the Central Negev: Crisis and Renewal\n\na.\n\nb. Figure 1.25a. Mezad Erga (third century BCE) and b. Mezad ‘En Rahel third century BCE to early second second century CE occupied until the end of the second century BCE when it was apparently abandoned at the time of Alexander Jannaeus’ conquest of Gaza. The fort was reoccupied by the Nabataeans at the end of the first century BCE and remained in use until its destruction by an earthquake at the beginning of the second century CE, possibly prior to the Roman annexation of Nabataea in 106 CE.\n\nThe caravanserai contains a small bathhouse with water transported by way of an aqueduct located north of the fort to an open pool. The remains of frescos and painted stucco were discovered in a room next to the bathhouse. Other structures at the site include caves with built facades, a Late Hellenistic pottery kiln and an Early Roman structure with industrial installations on a hilltop southeast of the caravanserai (Cohen 1981: 36-38; Cohen 2000: 75-80). The fort contained evidence of Roman soldiers stationed there following the annexation of Nabataea in 106 CE. The site was suddenly abandoned sometime in the early third century after 222 CE, possibly as a result of an epidemic, and it was never reoccupied. Two Byzantine and a number of Early Islamic coins discovered at the site were apparently left there by travelers or farmers from the nearby Early Islamic village of Nahal Omer.\n\nThe fort contained well-preserved organic remains, including papyri fragments with Nabataean script. On the plain below the fort, aqueducts transported water from the spring into fields next to a farmhouse built in the Hellenistic period. Similar to Moyat 'Awad, a caravanserai appears to have been constructed in the first century CE at the foot of the hill (Erickson-Gini, Israel and Nahlieli, forthcoming).\n\nMezad ‘En Rahel, the Hellenistic Nabataean fort next to the spring of ‘En Rahel, was excavated in 1981 by Y. Israel and D. Nahlieli on behalf of the Israel Department of Antiquities (Israel and Nahlieli 1982: 35), (Fig. 1.25). This fort, located on a steep hill in view of the ancient track called the Darb es Sultan, measures 16×16 meters. Like the fort at Moyat 'Awad, it has a series of casemate rooms surrounding a small central courtyard. The fort was constructed sometime in the third century BCE. It appears to have replaced an earlier fort constructed a kilometer eastward next to the spring of ‘En Erga (16722/00466) when that structure was destroyed by an earthquake prior to its occupation. Both forts were built to guard the original Petra-Gaza road, the Darb es Sultan (the King’s Way) that ran north of the Ramon Crater by way of the springs at Ein Orahot and Ein Ziq to the vicinity of Oboda. In addition to the forts, Hellenistic black-glazed pottery was discovered north-west of 'En Rahel along this road (Y. Israel, pers. comm.).\n\nRemains of a fort, Mezad ‘En Ziq (13582/02364), built by the Nabataeans in the Early Hellenistic period, was found along the Darb es Sultan near the springs at ‘En Ziq. The remains of the fort, containing five rooms and measuring 10×15 m., are located on a steep hill overlooking the springs. It was excavated in 1984 by Cohen (Cohen 1984a: 25-26). Soundings revealed two phases of Nabataean occupation: the first dated to the first and second centuries BCE and the second phase to the first century CE. In addition, a mass grave dated to the Hellenistic period was discovered below the fort in the ruins of a Middle Bronze Age I site. This grave contained the remains of 21 women and children and only four men. One of the early burials in the grave was that of male, aged 40-50, who appears to have suffered battle injuries. The skull of this particular individual contained evidence of dental treatment (Zias and Numeroff 1986: 66-67). The remains of an aqueduct was noted near the spring (Y. Israel, pers. comm..).\n\nExcavation in the fort at ‘En Rahel revealed that it was\n\nThe Later Petra – Gaza Road via the Ramon Crater 22\n\nPrevious Research in the Central Negev and Central Arava Valley\n\nFigure 1.26. The Petra. Gaza road by way of the Ramon Crater In the late first century BCE the Nabataeans constructed stations along an ancient track between Moyat ''Awad and the Ramon Crater. This track dates to the Early Bronze Age, if not earlier, and it linked the central Arava Valley and the mines at Feinan to the Negev Highlands thorugh the Ramon Crater and the ascent of Ma'ale Zadok next to modern Mizpe Ramon. The track was apparently a secondary road used by the Nabataeans in the Hellenistic period and campsites have been dectected from that period next to Nahal Meishar and next to the spring at El Biyar (see below, Y. Israel, pers. comm..). In the late first century BCE the Nabataeans built a road station and a cistern on the banks Nahal Neqarot, and by the first half of the first century CE, they built caravanserais at Moyat ''Awad and Sha'ar Ramon. A new track was created between Sha'ar Ramon and Oboda by way of a new pass, the Ma’ale Mahmal, leading up from the Ramon Crater. This route enjoyed the advantages of fortifications and good water sources, and facilitated faster, year round caravan transport through an inhospitable area (Fig. 1.26).\n\nFigure 1.27. Mezad Neqarot CE gilded bulla from the port of Alexandria. Water supplying the fort was collected in a rock cut cistern in the valley of Nahal Omer below the fort. A small open shrine containing an an iconic betyl (small standing stone) on a small platform (motab) was found a few meters south of the structure. Nabataean painted ware bowls dated to the late second and early third centuries were found buried in situ next to the platform. Maseboth, or stelae, in groups of three were located within 100 meters of the fort and also on the Nahal Omer ridge between Moa and Kh. Qasra (Israel and Nahlieli 1998: 146-147). These appear to be typical Nabataean open-air shrines found in the Negev and eastern Sinai (Avner 1993: 166-181). Maseboth appear to be a nonfigurative creation indicating a tradition of a prohibition of graven images among the Nabataeans, a subject treated at length by J. Patrich (Patrich 1990: 185-196).\n\nThe Nabataean stations and Roman forts constructed along this route at Horvat Qasra, Mezad Har Massa, Mezad Neqarot, Sha’ar Ramon (Khan Saharonim), Mezad Ma’ale Mahmal and Mezad Grafon were investigated from the 1960s through the1980s. Excavations in the majority of these sites were carried out by Cohen on behalf of the Israel Department of Antiquities. The final report of these excavations, initiated by the late Y. Hirschfeld, is currently in progress.\n\nThe small structure of Mezad Har Massa was constructed inside a low hill between Nahal Omer and Nahal Neqarot. It was excavated in 1982-1983 by Cohen’s team (Cohen 1983b: 69). The fort measures 10×20 meters in size and the excavators suggested that it was occupied in only one phase in the first century CE. Subsequent examination of the coins and also the pottery from the site by the writer has revealed later occupation of the site in the Late Roman and Early Byzantine periods.\n\nKh. Qasra (Qasr el-Abd/Qal’at Umm Quseir) was excavated by Cohen in 1981 (Cohen 1982d: 163-164). The fort consists of a square tower 5×5.5 meters to which three rooms were added in a second phase. A coin of the Emperor Caracalla (217-211) was found in the tower, and second and third century CE pottery was found in parts of the structure. Two lead bullae were found at the site. One example discovered in the fort is a second century\n\nExcavations at Mezad Neqarot (Qasr Wadi es Siq) were carried out in 1981-1982 in four structures (Fig. 1.27). The main structure at the site is a Late Roman fort tower with an adjacent courtyard, measuring 5×8.5 meters, and a structure located a few meters eastwards (Cohen 23\n\nNabataean Settlement and Self-Organized Economy in the Central Negev: Crisis and Renewal Erickson-Gini 2001-2002). Sha’ar Ramon (Qasr el Mahale) is a large caravanserai, 42×42 meters in size, constructed near the spring of ‘En Saharonim on the eastern edge of the Ramon Crater (Fig.1.28). Probes in the caravanserai were first carried out in the 1960s by Meshel and Tsafrir (Meshel and Tsafrir 1974: 48-51). The structure was again excavated by Cohen in 1982-1983 (Cohen 1982b: 87-88; 1988c: 164-165; 2000: 85-86). Three occupational phases were found at the site: the first phase dates to the first century CE; the second phase was dated by coins and pottery to the late second and early third centuries CE, and the structure was partially reoccupied in the late third century CE. The second phase of occupation in the Late Roman period contained evidence of road services in the form of bathtubs and a large intact oven containing camel bones and cooking pots. The reoccupation in phase 3 appears to have been part of the military deployment in the area in the Diocletianic period when the army camp at Oboda and the fort at Horvat Ma'agurah were constructed. The latest ceramic evidence from the site includes African Red Slipped wares dated to that period.\n\nFigure 1.28. Sha’ar Ramon (Cohen 2000:87) 1982c: 86-87). The latter structure appears to have been constructed and occupied in the early phase of the site in the late first century BCE. It was apparently damaged in the early second century CE by the same earthquake that affected other nearby sites and destroyed the fort at 'En Rahel. The early structure has six irregularly shaped rooms around an open courtyard and the entire structure measures 12×17 meters in size. Coins found in the structure belong to Aretas IV (9 BCE - 40 CE) and Malchius II (40-70 CE). In the Late Roman fort tower, pottery dated to the late second and early third centuries CE was found and coins of the Emperor Elagabalus (218-222 CE) were found in the dump immediately outside the tower. A small watchtower, 3×4 meters in size, located on a hill east of the site was also examined. An intact covered water cistern with transverse arches, measuring 7×7 meters, is located approximately 100 meters south of the fort. The roof of the cistern is supported by three arches and the lower part of the cistern was quarried into the bedrock and covered with hydraulic plaster. The exterior of the cistern and twothirds of the interior were cleared by the writer on behalf of the Israel Antiquties Authority in order to facilitate the conservation of the structure in 1996. A small horned limestone altar, approximately 0.20 cm in height, bearing an inscription in Greek script, was found at the bottom of the cistern. The cistern appears to have been damaged in a massive earthquake that destroyed the original aqueduct and settling pool leading into the cistern. A later channel was haphazardly constructed over this destruction layer and the cistern appears to have continued in use for an undetermined period of time. The cistern is nearly an exact copy of the covered cistern discovered at ez-Zantur in Petra dated to the late first century BCE. The Neqarot cistern was probably constructed at the site to supply water for the early Nabataean station. Nabataean cisterns with transverse arches have been discovered elsewhere along the Petra – Gaza road at Mezad Ma'ale Mahmal and also on the Mampsis – Oboda road at Horvat Ha'bor (Israel and\n\nThe spring of El Biyar (14188/00362), located approximately 2.5 kms northwest of Sha’ar Ramon along an Early Bronze Age road leading toward Ma'ale Zadok, appears to have been used by the Nabataeans as a campsite in the period before the Early Roman period. A Thamudic inscription was found in the bedrock outcrop next to the site. Two coins minted in the Phoenician city of Aradus were discovered near the spring (Y. Israel, pers. comm..). A building at the site dates to the Early Islamic period (Cohen 2000: 86, 88). The small fort of Mezad Ma’ale Mahmal, 6.5×7 meters in size, was first excavated by Cohen in 1965 and again in 1982 (Cohen 1983e: 69-70). It is located at the upper point of the narrow pass, Ma’ale Mahmal, that winds 200 meters up the north face of the Ramon Crater. Two occupational phases were found at the site: the first century CE and the third century CE (dated by coins of the Emperor Gallienus). A collapsed covered water cistern located 540 meters north of the fort was also excavated. This cistern was rather large, containing ten arches and it measured 4.75×8 meters in size. It had a capacity of 150 cubit meters of water and it was supplied with runoff water collected into channels and directed into the cistern. The remains of a first century CE Nabataean structure were discovered next to the the Late Roman fort by the writer in 2004. Although only a few rooms of the structure were uncovered it may belong to a larger structure with a central courtyard. This early structure was destroyed in the early second century CE by an earthquake in which a wall along the west collapsed into the courtyard. Probes in the foundation of the Late Roman tower produced Nabataean painted ware pottery dated to the late second and early third centuries CE. Two structures were found at the site of Mezad Grafon 24\n\nPrevious Research in the Central Negev and Central Arava Valley (13885/01485) and include a square fort, 6.10×6.10 in size, and a domestic dwelling (Fig.1.29). A third small structure, 2×2 meters, probably a watchtower, was located at the top of the Grafon Pass. A rock cut cistern on the banks of Nahal Grafon located 180 m. southwest of the site supplied water for the fort. Water was collected into a wellpreserved channel, 250 meters in length directed into the cistern (Meshel and Tsafrir 1974: 41-44; Cohen 2000:90). Visual inspection of the pottery found on the surface of the site suggests that it may have been used in the Diocletianic and Early Byzantine periods. Mezad Be’er Menuha\n\nFigure 1.29. Mezad Grafon (Meshel and Tsafrir 1974: 42)\n\nThe fort at Be’er Menuha (Bir Muleiha) was excavated by R. Cohen in 1983 (Cohen 1983d: 68-69). Two building phases were reported. The first belongs to an earlier structure, probably a Nabataean caravanserai measuring 18.50×21 m., consisting of rooms situated around a wide courtyard. This structure contained finds dating to the Hellenistic Nabataean period, such as early Nabataean pottery and coins of Aretas II, and pottery and coins dating to the later first century BCE and first century CE. The excavator proposed that this structure was a Nabataean station on the north – south Arava road. A later structure, a tower, was erected in the courtyard of the earlier structure. It measures 9.5×9.5 m. and has three rooms and a staircase to an upper story. This tower appears to have been built and occupied in the Roman period, in the second and third centuries CE. Coins of Trajan and Hadrian were found in this structure.\n\n145). Negev also excavated a Nabataean necropolis dating to the first through early fourth century CE located east of the town (Negev 1971: 110-121; Negev and Sivan 1977). A Roman military cemetery also located outside the town revealed two Latin epitaphs belonging to a centurion of the Legio III Cyrenaica and a cavalryman of the Cohors I Augusta Thracum (Negev 1969: 9). Other studies of the site included those of the dams in Nahal Mamshit carried out by A. Kloner (Kloner 1973: 248-275; 1975: 167-170). Further excavations were carried out by O. Katz of the Israel Antiquities Authority in 1992 and Erickson-Gini in 19931994. The latest excavations at the site were carried out in three areas: in a midden located north of the town walls dated to first and early second centuries CE, in an area next to Building XII and inside the building (L428), and in the area under and east of the British Police building. This last area revealed a previously unknown structure, Building XXV, constructed in the late first or early second centuries CE, that was occupied in three phases until its destruction in the fourth century by an earthquake (Erickson-Gini 1995:95-96; 1997:133-134; 1999), (Fig. 1.30).\n\nMampsis and Sites along the Mampsis – Dead Sea Road The first excavations at Mampsis were carried by S. Applebaum in 1956 and 1959. Applebaum investigated an area near the walls of the western side of the town, revealing occupation layers dating no earlier than the third century CE (Applebaum 1956:191-192; 1959:30-52).\n\nExcavations were carried out at Migdal Tsafit (Mezad Zafit, Rujm el Marqab 16806/05022) in 1971 and at Mezad Tamar (Qasr el-Juheniye) between 1973-1975 by M. Gichon on behalf of Tel Aviv University in 1971 (Gichon 1971:28; 1976). The site of Migdal Tsafit consists of a small square tower, 6.15×6.15 m. in size, located on a high hill overlooking the Rotem plain and the Dead Sea – Mampsis road, northwest of Mezad Tamar. On the basis of coins found at the site, Gichon dated the earliest layer there to the Trajanic period. The tower was later reoccupied in the later part of the third century CE and appears to have been deserted in the Byzantine period.\n\nThe most extensive excavations of the site were carried by A. Negev, sponsored by the Hebrew University at Jerusalem, between 1965 and 1967, and again in 1990. His investigations were carried out in the site’s two Byzantine churches and in several large residential structures constructed in the second century CE that remained in use into the Byzantine period. Negev also excavated a Nabataean/Early Roman fo"
