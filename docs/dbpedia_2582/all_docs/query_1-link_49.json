        "text": "Artificial intelligence (AI), as defined by A.M. Turing, refers to the development of computer systems that can perform tasks requiring human-like intelligence.Footnote 1 In recent years, there has been a surge of interest in the legal issues surrounding AI-generated content, particularly about copyright. The rapid advancement of AI technology has led to questions regarding the legal status and protection of AI-generated works.Footnote 2 AI has emerged as a transformative force, revolutionizing various aspects of human life, including creating and producing artistic and literary works. However, existing copyright legislation in most countries cannot protect AI-generated works, which include creative works produced with AI technology and even computer-generated works. These involve creative content generated exclusively by computer algorithms or programs and fail to address the complex issues surrounding AI-generated works.Footnote 3\n\nUndoubtedly, human authors form the foundation of copyright, and, as such, the law protects them in recognition of their originality and creativity.Footnote 4 Hence, the author's identification is important as it is a prerequisite for “copyrightability”. Granting authors copyright entails bestowing on them two distinct sets of rights. The first set enables authors to reap the financial rewards of their creative endeavors, such as selling copyrights. The second set encompasses moral and enduring rights, including the right of paternity, which allows authors to be recognized by name, use pseudonyms, and remain anonymous, and the right to integrity, which empowers authors to refuse modifications that could harm their reputation.Footnote 5\n\nConsequently, the foundation of copyright and intellectual property law rests on the notion of human “authorship”. However, this established legislative policy has been significantly disrupted by the emergence of AI and its growing involvement as human assistants in creating diverse forms of works, including literary and artistic creations. As a result, the determination of who should be recognized as the author of such works has become a highly contentious matter, not only for policymakers but also for judicial systems.Footnote 6 Given the significant impact of AI-generated works and their substantial role in the creative process, it is now essential and unavoidable for legislative policymakers to establish a clear legal framework that defines the precise legal relationship between computers and their operators or programmers. By doing so, courts will be empowered to address the authorship of computer-generated works and allocate ownership rights accordingly.Footnote 7\n\nNotably, certain countries, such as the UK, Hong Kong, Ireland, New Zealand, and India, have taken significant steps and initiatives to address the issue of AI-generated works. These jurisdictions have taken proactive measures by amending their statutes to accommodate the copyrightability of works that involve computer-generated elements and human intervention. By doing so, they have surpassed the international legal community in providing legal clarity in this area.Footnote 8 Nevertheless, these laws do not comprehensively address those scenarios where a computer creates a work with minimal or indirect human involvement, potentially leaving a lacuna in the legal framework. By contrast, most jurisdictions worldwide still struggle to grapple with the complex issue of authorship and remain silent on this contentious matter.Footnote 9\n\nThis article aims to delve into the intricate realm of AI authorship and explore how the emergence of smart technologies may disrupt the existing copyright framework. Specifically, it focuses on determining the authorship of works created by AI. A comprehensive analysis of the prerequisites of authorship within the established legal system is necessary to address this question. Through an analytical approach, this article carefully examines the landscape of copyright law and judicial practices in various countries, including the US, the UK, and China. Additionally, it considers the copyright framework at the EU level and the judicial practices of the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The selection of these jurisdictions was based on several key considerations. The jurisdictions were chosen based on their significant impact on developing and interpreting copyright law. These jurisdictions have well-established copyright systems and have previously dealt with emerging technologies, making them relevant for our analysis. Additionally, jurisdictions were selected to represent different legal systems or approaches to copyright law, enabling a comparative analysis of how they address the issue of authorship in AI-generated works. Furthermore, consideration was given to jurisdictions where AI-generated works had been subject to legal disputes or where ongoing debates on authorship existed, ensuring the practical relevance of the analysis. The availability of research resources, including scholarly articles, legal opinions, and case law for the selected jurisdictions, was also taken into account to facilitate a comprehensive examination of the legal principles surrounding authorship. By exploring these jurisdictions, this article seeks to provide insights into the current landscape of copyright law relating to AI-generated works. It investigates the role of judicial interpretations in establishing principles to address the deadlock surrounding authorship in AI-generated works. This article aims to contribute to the field in multiple ways by exploring different jurisdictions under civil and common law legal systems. First, it strives to provide a comprehensive understanding of the attribution of authorship in cases where the production involves human intervention or is autonomously generated. Such an understanding is valuable to judges, lawyers, and legal scholars working in copyright law. Second, the critical analysis conducted can highlight potential challenges that may arise in judicial practice. This information can then be utilized to enhance judicial practices and ensure justice's effective and efficient delivery.\n\nHowever, while there has been considerable discourse and research on the legal issues surrounding AI-generated works and copyright, there appears to be a research gap in examining the specific criteria and implications of originality in AI-generated works within different legal jurisdictions. Existing literature primarily focuses on the general intersection of AI and copyright law, with limited attention given to the nuanced requirements of originality for AI-generated content. Furthermore, there is a lack of comprehensive analysis and comparison of the approaches taken by different jurisdictions in addressing the copyright protection of AI-generated works. Our research seeks to address this gap by critically examining the concept of originality in AI-generated works and exploring the divergent legal approaches across various jurisdictions, specifically focusing on the implications for copyright law.\n\nAs we navigate these complex issues, it is important to emphasize that this paper represents an ongoing dialogue in a rapidly evolving field. The conclusions and insights drawn will contribute to the broader discussions surrounding AI and copyright law, serving as a foundation for further exploration and the development of legal frameworks that can effectively address the challenges posed by AI-generated authorship."
