        "text": "2014\n\nJanuary—Germany—On February 6, 2014, prosecutors announced that in January in a Munich state court, they had charged Alexander Abit J., 27, a German man, with trying to recruit people for the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan, which is active in Afghanistan and Pakistan, by posting jihadi videos and messages on the Internet between October 2009 and January 2011. Using several aliases, according to the prosecutors, he posted audio and text messages that glorified IMU’s battle against “enemies of Islam” and killing of ­non-believers.\n\nJanuary—UK/Syria—On April 18, 2014, British officials announced an investigation into the death of Abdullah Deghayes, 18, a Briton who skipped going to university, ran away from his Brighton home in January 2014 to fight in Syria, where he was killed in recent weeks. He is the nephew of released Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Deghayes, who was held as an enemy combatant between 2002 and 2007.\n\nJanuary—Syria—At least 15 ISIS gunmen arrived in 3 cars in Rabiaa, in northwest Latakia, arrested moderate rebel guards protecting a hospital, then crashed into the building in hopes of attacking rebels receiving medical attention. Staff helped 2 rebels escape to ­al-Yamdiah Hospital. The ISIS gunmen then attacked that hospital, killing one wounded rebel and kidnapping another. The staff closed the hospital to protest the attack. ISIS freed the patient.\n\nJanuary—Syria—ISIS attacked the ­al-Biranas Hospital, a facility run by the Belgian branch of Doctors Without Borders and kidnapped 5 doctors from Belgium, Denmark, Peru, Sweden, and Switzerland. The group closed a hospital and 2 medical centers. Three were freed in April 2014; the 2 others were freed in May 2014. 14019901\n\nJanuary 1—Czech Republic—Palestinian Ambassador Jamel ­al-Jamal, 56, died of his injuries when explosives went off while he was moving an old office safe box in his apartment in Prague’s Suchdol neighborhood. His wife, 52, was taken to another hospital for shock. Senior Czech police official Martin Cervicek told Czech public television that there was no evidence of terrorist involvement. Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad Malki suggested that the safe’s door was ­booby-trapped; it had not been touched for more than 20 years before recently being moved from the old embassy building and a facility used by the Palestine Liberation Organization in the 1980s. This view was contradicted by Palestinian Embassy spokesman Nabil ­el-Fahel, who said that the safe “was used on a daily basis at the embassy and it was opened and closed almost every day.” The victim’s daughter, Rana ­al-Jamal, 30, added, “The Palestinian official account is baseless. The safe box has been in regular use—my mom (who lives there) told me that. The box was moved a day earlier and apparently something happened in the way. We, the family, believe it is a crime, and we need to find out what happened.” Police said the case involved negligence and possession of unregistered weapons that were found at the residence. The mayor of the neighborhood called for the Palestinian representation to move elsewhere.\n\nOn January 16, 2014, Czech investigators found explosives at the Palestinian embassy complex. They had earlier discovered 12 illegal weapons in the compound. Palestinian authorities told the Czechs that the weapons were gifts from the previous Czecho­slovak regime to the Palestine Liberation Organization.\n\nAP reported on March 31, 2014, that Czech investigators had determined that Ambassador Jamal ­al-Jamal did not die from a bomb in the safe. The safe was not ­booby-trapped and did not contain a bomb. His death was thus being investigated as a case of negligence.\n\nJanuary 1—Somalia—Two ­al-Shabaab suicide car bombers set off explosives during the night outside the Jazeera Hotel near Mogadishu’s Aden Adde international airport, killing 10, including government soldiers, and injuring 2 people. The second bomb went off as first responders were arriving. The hotel is popular with expats and government officials. Jihadis had warned about New Year’s celebrations. Al-Shabaab spokesman Sheikh Ali Hussein, alias Abu Jabal, told German reporters that “Yes, we did this. It was a sacred attack and hit its target. It is not the first and would not be the last. We are warning residents in Mogadishu to stay away from the areas of the infidels and ­so-called Somali government bases.”\n\nMcClatchy Newspapers reported hit and run attacks and grenade bombings against Somali military bases throughout Mogadishu.\n\nJanuary 1—Iraq—Interior Ministry spokesman Saad Maan Ibrahim announced the arrest in Baghdad of Shi’ite cleric Wathiq ­al-Batat, leader of the ­Iranian-backed Mukhtar Army militia. In November 2013, ­al-Batat took credit for 6 mortar shells that landed in Saudi Arabia, saying he was retaliating for Saudi religious decrees he deemed insulting to Shi’ites. He also said he was behind attacks against a camp hosting an Iranian opposition group. He had earlier led Iraq’s Hizballah Brigades.\n\nJanuary 2—Kenya—Two men on a motorcycle threw a grenade at the Tandoori restaurant in Mombasa’s Diani area, injuring 10 people, one of whom underwent surgery.\n\nJanuary 2—U.S.—The Chinese Consulate in San Francisco was damaged in an arson attack. The Consulate’s website said that someone pulled 2 buckets of gasoline out of a nearby van, poured it on the front of the building, and set it alight. The FBI launched an arson investigation of the incident, which caused no injuries. FBI Special Agent David Johnson said the incident was a criminal matter versus terrorism. The FBI arrested Chinese citizen with Permanent Resident status Yan Feng, 39, of San Francisco’s Daly City suburb, on January 3 after he called police. A federal affidavit said Feng told investigators that he had been hearing Chinese voices, so he believed the Consulate was involved. He was charged with causing damage to property of a foreign government and arson.\n\nJanuary 2—Tunisia—Authorities arrested 4 Ansar ­al-Shariah terrorists after nighttime gun battles in Sidi Bouzid and confiscated explosives, money, ammunition and an assault rifle.\n\nTunisian media reported on December 30, 2013, that Ansar leader Seifallah Ben Hassine had been arrested in Libya.\n\nJanuary 2—Yemen—Gunmen shot to death senior intelligence officer Colonel Marawan ­al-Moqbouli as he was riding in his car in Aden.\n\nJanuary 2—Iraq—A pickup truck bomb killed 19 people and wounded 37 on a commercial street in Balad Ruz.\n\nJanuary 2—Iraq—Al-Qaeda gunmen conducted simultaneous attacks against police stations in Ramadi and Fallujah.\n\nA sticky bomb attached to a public minibus went off in Baghdad’s Shaab district, killing 4 people and wounding 6.\n\nA bomb hit a military patrol in Mosul, killing 3 soldiers and injuring 5.\n\nA bomb went off in a Latifiyah outdoor vegetable market, killing 5 civilians and wounding 9.\n\nIn a gun battle at a military post in Latifiyah, 2 soldiers and 3 terrorists were killed and 5 other soldiers were wounded.\n\nJanuary 2—Lebanon—A bomb apparently hidden in a parked car went off in Beirut’s ­Hizballah-controlled Shi’ite suburb of Haret Hreik, killing 5 people and injuring 66. On January 4, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed credit in a website posting, saying it was a “first, small payment from the heavy account that awaits those wicked criminals.” On January 6, Abbas Karnib, 52, a Lebanese reporter who had worked for 2 decades for Hizballah’s ­al-Manar TV station, died of his wounds. He was married with 4 children.\n\nLebanese officials identified the suicide bomber as Lebanese citizen Qutaiba ­al-Satem, 19, who lived near the Syrian border. A neighbor said ­al-Satem and his brother had joined the Syrian rebels.\n\nJanuary 2—Libya—The bodies of British citizen Mark De Salis and a New Zealand woman—both teachers in Tripoli who were shot to death—were found next to their luggage near an oil and gas complex outside Sabratha.

He and 2 of his brothers were convicted in 2003 of membership in N-17. He was due to return to prison on January 8. On January 20, he posted an Internet video in which he announced that he was returning to armed action, observing, “I once again decided to make the guerrilla rifle thunder against those who stole our lives and sold our dreams to make a profit,” referring to the Greek financial crisis, attacking the media, the judiciary, the police and the extreme ­right-wing Golden Dawn party. He said the ruling coalition parties—the conservative New Democracy and the socialist Pasok—were guilty of treason, and the “price of their treason is death.” He said the financial crisis made Greece and other countries colonies of “German occupation.” “If we ever meet again, which I don’t hope (and neither should you) you will do well to kill me. Because if you take me captive again, I will leave again to fight you to the end.” On January 22, 2014, Public Order Minister Nikos Dendias announced a 4 million euros ($5.4 million) reward for information leading to the capture of terrorists, including Christodoulos Xiros.\n\nJanuary 6—Rwanda—Terrorists threw a grenade into the home of the mayor of Musanze district, killing a baby.
