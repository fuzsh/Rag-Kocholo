        "text": "Charging of dust grains in a plasma with negative ions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKim, Su-Hyun; Merlino, Robert L.\n\n2006-05-01\n\nThe effect of negative ions on the charging of dust particles in a plasma is investigated experimentally. A plasma containing a very low percentage of electrons is formed in a single-ended SF6 is admitted into the vacuum system. The relatively cold (Teâ0.2eV ) readily attach to SF6 molecules to form SF6- negative ions. Calculations of the dust charge indicate that for electrons, negative ions, and positive ions of comparable temperatures, the charge (or surface potential) of the dust can be positive if the positive ion mass is smaller than the negative ion mass and if É, the ratio of the electron to positive ion density, is sufficiently small. The K+ positive ions (mass 39amu) and SF6- negative ions (mass 146amu), and also utilizes a rotating cylinder to dispense dust into the plasma column. Analysis of the current-voltage characteristics of a Langmuir probe in the dusty plasma shows evidence for the reduction in the (magnitude) of the negative dust charge and the transition to positively charged dust as the relative concentration of the residual electrons is reduced. Some remarks are offered concerning experiments that could become possible in a dusty plasma with positive grains.\n\nHigh negative charge of a dust particle in a hot cathode discharge.\n\nPubMed\n\nArnas, C; Mikikian, M; Doveil, F\n\n1999-12-01\n\nDust particle levitation experiments in a plasma produced by a hot filament discharge, operating at low argon pressure, are presented. The basic characteristics of a dust grain trapped in a plate sheath edge in these experimental conditions are reported. Taking into account the sheath potential profiles measured with a differential emissive probe diagnostic, the forces applied to an isolated dust grain can be determined. Two different experimental methods yield approximately the same value for the dust charge. The observed high negative charge is mainly due to the contribution of the primary electrons emitted by the filaments as predicted by a simple model.\n\nExcitation of Kelvin Helmholtz instability by an ion beam in a plasma with negatively charged dust grains\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nRani, Kavita; Sharma, Suresh C.\n\n2015-02-15\n\nAn ion beam propagating through a magnetized dusty plasma drives Kelvin Helmholtz Instability (KHI) via Cerenkov interaction. The frequency of the unstable wave increases with the relative density of negatively charged dust grains. It is observed that the beam has stabilizing effect on the growth rate of KHI for low shear parameter, but for high shear parameter, the instability is destabilized with relative density of negatively charged dust grains.\n\nRole of electron temperature on charging of dust grains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKausik, S. S.; Chakraborty, M.; Saikia, B. K.\n\n2007-02-01\n\nDust grains are produced by evaporation of silver in an experimental setup consisting of a dust chamber, a plasma chamber, and a deflection chamber. Due to differential pressure between the dust and plasma chambers, the dust grains move upward and after passing through plasma they become negatively charged. These charged dust grains are then deflected by a dc field applied across a pair of deflector plates in the deflection chamber. Both from the amount of deflection and also from the floating potential, the number of charges collected on the dust grains is calculated. As the gas pressure is changed, the plasma density and the electron temperature changes. Dust charge is then calculated at each value of pressure from the deflection and floating potential. It is found that the electron temperature has a profound effect in the accumulation of charge on dust grains.\n\nMeasurements of Lunar Dust Charging Properties by Electron Impact\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAbbas, Mian M.; Tankosic, Dragana; Craven, Paul D.; Schneider, Todd A.; Vaughn, Jason A.; LeClair, Andre; Spann, James F.; Norwood, Joseph K.\n\n2009-01-01\n\nDust grains in the lunar environment are believed to be electrostatically charged predominantly by photoelectric emissions resulting from solar UV radiation on the dayside, and on the nightside by interaction with electrons in the solar wind plasma. In the high vacuum environment on the lunar surface with virtually no atmosphere, the positive and negative charge states of micron/submicron dust grains lead to some unusual physical and dynamical dust phenomena. Knowledge of the electrostatic charging properties of dust grains in the lunar environment is required for addressing their hazardous effect on the humans and mechanical systems. It is well recognized that the charging properties of individual small micron size dust grains are substantially different from the measurements on bulk materials. In this paper we present the results of measurements on charging of individual Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 dust grains by exposing them to mono-energetic electron beams in the 10-100 eV energy range. The charging/discharging rates of positively and negatively charged particles of approx. 0.1 to 5 micron radii are discussed in terms of the sticking efficiencies and secondary electron yields. The secondary electron emission process is found to be a complex and effective charging/discharging mechanism for incident electron energies as low as 10-25 eV, with a strong dependence on particle size. Implications of the laboratory measurements on the nature of dust grain charging in the lunar environment are discussed.\n\nInvestigation of Dusts Effect and Negative Ion in DC Plasmas by Electric Probes\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOh, Hye Taek; Kang, Inje; Bae, Min-Keun; Park, Insun; Lee, Seunghwa; Jeong, Seojin; Chung, Kyu-Sun\n\n2017-10-01\n\nDust is typically negatively charged by electron attachment whose thermal velocities are fast compared to that of the heavier ions. The negatively charged particles can play a role of negative ions which affect the quasi-neutrality of background plasma. To investigate effect of metal dusts and negative ion on plasma and materials, metal dusts are injected into background Ar plasma which is generated by tungsten filament using dust dispenser on Cubical Plasma Device (CPD). The CPD has following conditions: size =24x24x24cm3, plasma source =DC filament plasma (ne 1x10x1010, Te 2eV), background gas =Ar, dusts =tungsten powder (diameter 1.89micron). The dust dispenser is developed to quantitate of metal dust by ultrasonic transducer. Electronegative plasmas are generated by adding O2 + Ar plasma to compare negative ion and dust effect. A few grams of micron-sized dusts are placed in the dust dispenser which is located at the upper side of the Cubical Plasma Device. The falling particles by dust dispenser are mainly charged up by the collection of the background plasma. The change in parameters due to negative ion production are characterized by measuring the floating and plasma potential, electron temperature and negative ion density using electric probes.\n\nMeasurements of Charging of Apollo 17 Lunar Dust Grains by Electron Impact\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAbbas, Mian M.; Tankosic, Dragana; Spann, James F.; Dube, Michael J.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIt is well known since the Apollo missions that the lunar surface is covered with a thick layer of micron size dust grains with unusually high adhesive characteristics. The dust grains observed to be levitated and transported on the lunar surface are believed to have a hazardous impact on the robotic and human missions to the Moon. The observed dust phenomena are attributed to the lunar dust being charged positively during the day by UV photoelectric emissions, and negatively during the night by the solar wind electrons. The current dust charging and the levitation models, however, do not fully explain the observed phenomena, with the uncertainty of dust charging processes and the equilibrium potentials of the individual dust grains. It is well recognized that the charging properties of individual dust grains are substantially different from those determined from measurements made on bulk materials that are currently available. An experimental facility has been developed in the Dusty Plasma Laboratory at MSFC for investigating the charging and optical properties of individual micron/sub-micron size positively or negatively charged dust grains by levitating them in an electrodynamic balance in simulated space environments. In this paper, we present the laboratory measurements on charging of Apollo 17 individual lunar dust grains by a low energy electron beam. The charging rates and the equilibrium potentials produced by direct electron impact and by secondary electron emission process are discussed.\n\nDust Grain Charge above the Lunar terminator\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVaverka, Jakub; Richterova, Ivana; Nemecek, Zdenek; Safrankova, Jana; Pavlu, Jiri; Vysinka, Marek\n\nInteraction of a lunar surface with the solar wind and magnetosphere leads to its charging by several processes as photoemission, a collection of primary particles, and secondary electron emission. Nevertheless, charging of the lunar surface is complicated by a shielding of solar light and solar wind ions by hills, craters, and boulders that can locally influence the surface potential. Moreover, a presence of a plasma wake can strongly affect this potential at the night side of the Moon. A typical surface potential varies from slightly positive (dayside) to negative values of the order of several hundred volts (night side). An electric field above the charged surface can lead to a levitation of dust grains as it has been observed by several spacecraft and by astronauts during Apollo missions. Although charging and transport of dust grains above the lunar surface are in the center of interest for many years, these phenomena are not still completely understood. We present calculation of an equilibrium potential of dust grains above the lunar surface. We focus on a terminator area during the Earthâs plasma sheet crossing. We use the secondary electron emission model for dust grains which takes into account an influence of the grain size, material, and surface roughness and findings from laboratory experiments with charging of lunar dust simulants by an electron beam.\n\nElectrostatic Power Generation from Negatively Charged, Simulated Lunar Regolith\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nChoi, Sang H.; King, Glen C.; Kim, Hyun-Jung; Park, Yeonjoon\n\n2010-01-01\n\nResearch was conducted to develop an electrostatic power generator for future lunar missions that facilitate the utilization of lunar resources. The lunar surface is known to be negatively charged from the constant bombardment of electrons and protons from the solar wind. The resulting negative electrostatic charge on the dust particles, in the lunar vacuum, causes them to repel each other minimizing the potential. The result is a layer of suspended dust about one meter above the lunar surface. This phenomenon was observed by both Clementine and Surveyor spacecrafts. During the Apollo 17 lunar landing, the charged dust was a major hindrance, as it was attracted to the astronauts' spacesuits, equipment, and the lunar buggies. The dust accumulated on the spacesuits caused reduced visibility for the astronauts, and was unavoidably transported inside the spacecraft where it caused breathing irritation [1]. In the lunar vacuum, the maximum charge on the particles can be extremely high. An article in the journal \"Nature\", titled \"Moon too static for astronauts?\" (Feb 2, 2007) estimates that the lunar surface is charged with up to several thousand volts [2]. The electrostatic power generator was devised to alleviate the hazardous effects of negatively charged lunar soil by neutralizing the charged particles through capacitive coupling and thereby simultaneously harnessing power through electric charging [3]. The amount of power generated or collected is dependent on the areal coverage of the device and hovering speed over the lunar soil surface. A thin-film array of capacitors can be continuously charged and sequentially discharged using a time-differentiated trigger discharge process to produce a pulse train of discharge for DC mode output. By controlling the pulse interval, the DC mode power can be modulated for powering devices and equipment. In conjunction with a power storage system, the electrostatic power generator can be a power source for a lunar rover or other\n\nExperiments on Dust Grain Charging\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAbbas, M. N.; Craven, P. D.; Spann, J. F.; Tankosic, D.; LeClair, A.; West, E. A.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nDust particles in various astrophysical environments are charged by a variety of mechanisms generally involving collisional processes with other charged particles and photoelectric emission with UV radiation from nearby sources. The sign and the magnitude of the particle charge are determined by the competition between the charging processes by UV radiation and collisions with charged particles. Knowledge of the particle charges and equilibrium potentials is important for understanding of a number of physical processes. The charge of a dust grain is thus a fundamental parameter that influences the physics of dusty plasmas, processes in the interplanetary medium and interstellar medium, interstellar dust clouds, planetary rings, cometary and outer atmospheres of planets etc. In this paper we present some results of experiments on charging of dust grains carried out on a laboratory facility capable levitating micron size dust grains in an electrodynamic balance in simulated space environments. The charging/discharging experiments were carried out by exposing the dust grains to energetic electron beams and UV radiation. Photoelectric efficiencies and yields of micron size dust grains of SiO2, and lunar simulates obtained from NASA-JSC will be presented.\n\nDust Grain Charge in the Lunar Environment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVaverka, Jakub; Richterova, Ivana; Vysinka, Marek; Pavlu, Jiri; Safrankova, Jana; Nemecek, Zdenek\n\n2014-05-01\n\nInteraction of a lunar surface with solar wind and magnetosphere plasmas leads to it charging by several processes as photoemission, a collection of primary particles and secondary electron emission. Nevertheless, charging of the lunar surface is complicated by a presence of crustal magnetic anomalies with can generate a \"mini-magnetosphere\" capable for more or less complete shielding the surface. On the other hand, shielding of solar light and plasma particles by rocks and craters can also locally influence the surface potential as well as a presence of a plasma wake strongly changes this potential at the night side of the Moon. A typical surface potential varies from slightly positive (dayside) to negative values of the order of several hundred of volts (night side). At the night side, negative potentials can reach -4 kV during solar energetic particle (SEP) events. Recent measurements of the surface potential by Lunar Prospector and Artemis spacecraft have shown surprisingly high negative dayside surface potentials (-500 V) during the magnetotail crossings as well as the positive surface potential higher than 100 V. One possible explanation is its non-monotonic profile above a surface where the potential minimum is formed by the space charge. Dust grains presented in this complicated environment are also charged by similar processes as the lunar surface. A strong dependence of the secondary electron yield on the grain size can significantly influence dust charging mainly in the Earth's plasma sheet where an equilibrium grain potential can by different than the surface potential and can reach even the opposite sign. This process can lead to levitation of dust above a surface observed by the Surveyor spacecraft.\n\nAttraction of likely charged nano-sized grains in dust-electron plasmas\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nVishnyakov, Vladimir I., E-mail: eksvar@ukr.net\n\n2016-01-15\n\nDust-electron plasma, which contains only the dust grains and electrons, emitted by them, is studied. Assumption of almost uniform spatial electrons distribution, which deviates from the uniformity only near the dust grains, leads to the grain charge division into two parts: first part is the individual for each grain âvisibleâ charge and the second part is the common charge of the neutralized background. The visible grain charge can be both negative and positive, while the total grain charge is only positive. The attraction of likely charged grains is possible, because the grain interaction is determined by the visible charges. ThemoreÂ Â» equilibrium state between attraction and repulsion of grains is demonstrated.Â«Â less\n\nRandom dust charge fluctuations in the near-Enceladus plasma\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nYaroshenko, V. V.; LÃ¼hr, H.\n\n2014-08-01\n\nStochastic dust charge fluctuations have been studied in the light of Cassini data on the near-Enceladus plasma environment. Estimates of fluctuation time scales showed that this process can be of importance for the grains emanating from the icy moon. The analytical modeling predicts that in the dust-loaded Enceladus plasma a majority of the grains acquires fluctuating negative charges, but there might appear a minority of positively charged particles. The probability of this effect mostly depends on the ratio of the dust/plasma number densities. Our findings appear to be supported by the available Cassini Plasma Spectrometer measurements of the charged grain distributions during E3 and E5 plume flybys. The theoretical results can also provide new insights into the intricate process of particle dynamics in the inner magnetosphere.\n\nImage charge effects on electron capture by dust grains in dusty plasmas.\n\nPubMed\n\nJung, Y D; Tawara, H\n\n2001-07-01\n\nElectron-capture processes by negatively charged dust grains from hydrogenic ions in dusty plasmas are investigated in accordance with the classical Bohr-Lindhard model. The attractive interaction between the electron in a hydrogenic ion and its own image charge inside the dust grain is included to obtain the total interaction energy between the electron and the dust grain. The electron-capture radius is determined by the total interaction energy and the kinetic energy of the released electron in the frame of the projectile dust grain. The classical straight-line trajectory approximation is applied to the motion of the ion in order to visualize the electron-capture cross section as a function of the impact parameter, kinetic energy of the projectile ion, and dust charge. It is found that the image charge inside the dust grain plays a significant role in the electron-capture process near the surface of the dust grain. The electron-capture cross section is found to be quite sensitive to the collision energy and dust charge.\n\nModeling the total dust production of Enceladus from stochastic charge equilibrium and simulations\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMeier, Patrick; Motschmann, Uwe; Schmidt, JÃ¼rgen; Spahn, Frank; Hill, Thomas W.; Dong, Yaxue; Jones, Geraint H.; Kriegel, Hendrik\n\n2015-12-01\n\nNegatively and positively charged nano-sized ice grains were detected in the Enceladus plume by the Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS). However, no data for uncharged grains, and thus for the total amount of dust, are available. In this paper we estimate this population of uncharged grains based on a model of stochastic charging in thermodynamic equilibrium and on the assumption of quasi-neutrality in the plasma-dust system. This estimation is improved upon by combining simulations of the dust component of the plume and simulations for the plasma environment into one self-consistent model. Calibration of this model with CAPS data provides a total dust production rate of about 12 kg s-1, including larger dust grains up to a few microns in size. We find that the fraction of charged grains dominates over that of the uncharged grains. Moreover, our model reproduces densities of both negatively and positively charged nanograins measured by Cassini CAPS. In Enceladus' plume ion densities up to ~104cm-3 are required by the self-consistent model, resulting in an electron depletion of about 50% in the plasma, because electrons are attached to the negatively charged nanograins. These ion densities correspond to effective ionization rates of about 10-7s-1, which are about two orders of magnitude higher than expected.\n\nCOSMIC DUST AGGREGATION WITH STOCHASTIC CHARGING\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMatthews, Lorin S.; Hyde, Truell W.; Shotorban, Babak, E-mail: Lorin_Matthews@baylor.edu\n\n2013-10-20\n\nThe coagulation of cosmic dust grains is a fundamental process which takes place in astrophysical environments, such as presolar nebulae and circumstellar and protoplanetary disks. Cosmic dust grains can become charged through interaction with their plasma environment or other processes, and the resultant electrostatic force between dust grains can strongly affect their coagulation rate. Since ions and electrons are collected on the surface of the dust grain at random time intervals, the electrical charge of a dust grain experiences stochastic fluctuations. In this study, a set of stochastic differential equations is developed to model these fluctuations over the surface ofmoreÂ Â» an irregularly shaped aggregate. Then, employing the data produced, the influence of the charge fluctuations on the coagulation process and the physical characteristics of the aggregates formed is examined. It is shown that dust with small charges (due to the small size of the dust grains or a tenuous plasma environment) is affected most strongly.Â«Â less\n\nElectrostatic Charging of Lunar Dust by UV Photoelectric Emissions and Solar Wind Electrons\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAbbas, Mian M.; Tankosic, Dragana; Spann, James f.; LeClair, Andre C.; Dube, Michael J.\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe ubiquitous presence of dust in the lunar environment with its high adhesive characteristics has been recognized to be a major safety issue that must be addressed in view of its hazardous effects on robotic and human exploration of the Moon. The reported observations of a horizon glow and streamers at the lunar terminator during the Apollo missions are attributed to the sunlight scattered by the levitated lunar dust. The lunar surface and the dust grains are predominantly charged positively by the incident UV solar radiation on the dayside and negatively by the solar wind electrons on the night-side. The charged dust grains are levitated and transported over long distances by the established electric fields. A quantitative understanding of the lunar dust phenomena requires development of global dust distribution models, based on an accurate knowledge of lunar dust charging properties. Currently available data of lunar dust charging is based on bulk materials, although it is well recognized that measurements on individual dust grains are expected to be substantially different from the bulk measurements. In this paper we present laboratory measurements of charging properties of Apollo 11 & 17 dust grains by UV photoelectric emissions and by electron impact. These measurements indicate substantial differences of both qualitative and quantitative nature between dust charging properties of individual micron/submicron sized dust grains and of bulk materials. In addition, there are no viable theoretical models available as yet for calculation of dust charging properties of individual dust grains for both photoelectric emissions and electron impact. It is thus of paramount importance to conduct comprehensive measurements for charging properties of individual dust grains in order to develop realistic models of dust processes in the lunar atmosphere, and address the hazardous issues of dust on lunar robotic and human missions.\n\nCharging of Individual Micron-Size Interstellar/Planetary Dust Grains by Secondary Electron Emissions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTankosic, D.; Abbas, M. M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDust grains in various astrophysical environments are generally charged electrostatically by photoelectric emissions with UV/X-ray radiation, as well as by electron/ion impact. Knowledge of physical and optical properties of individual dust grains is required for understanding of the physical and dynamical processes in space environments and the role of dust in formation of stellar and planetary systems. In this paper, we discuss experimental results on dust charging by electron impact, where low energy electrons are scattered or stick to the dust grains, thereby charging the dust grains negatively, and at sufficiently high energies the incident electrons penetrate the grain leading to excitation and emission of electrons referred to as secondary electron emission (SEE). Currently, very limited experimental data are available for charging of individual micron-size dust grains, particularly by low energy electron impact. Available theoretical models based on the Sternglass equation (Sternglass, 1954) are applicable for neutral, planar, and bulk surfaces only. However, charging properties of individual micron-size dust grains are expected to be different from the values measured on bulk materials. Our recent experimental results on individual, positively charged, micron-size lunar dust grains levitated in an electrodynamic balance facility (at NASA-MSFC) indicate that the SEE by electron impact is a complex process. The electron impact may lead to charging or discharging of dust grains depending upon the grain size, surface potential, electron energy, electron flux, grain composition, and configuration (e.g. Abbas et al, 2010). Here we discuss the complex nature of SEE charging properties of individual micron-size lunar dust grains and silica microspheres.\n\nLaboratory Studies on the Charging of Dust Grains in a Plasma\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nXu, Wenjun\n\n1993-01-01\n\nThe charging of dust grains by the surrounding plasma is studied in a dusty plasma device (DPD) (Xu, W., B. Song, R. L. Merlino, and N. D'Angelo, Rev. Sci. Instrum., 63, 5266, 1992). The dusty plasma device consists of a rotating-drum dust dispersal device used in conjunction with an existing Q-machine, to produce extended, steady state, magnetized plasma columns. The dust density in the dust chamber is controlled by the drum rotation speed. The device is capable of generating a dusty plasma in which as much as about 90% of the negative charge is attached to the dust grains of 1-10mu m size. Measurements of the dust parameter eta, the percentage of negative charge on free electrons in the dusty plasma, are presented. The dust parameter eta is found to depend on the rotational speed of the dust chamber, plasma density and the type and size of different dust. The dust parameter eta is calculated from a pair of Langmuir curves taken with and without dust under the same conditions. The operation of the dust chamber as described above has been confirmed by the agreement between the measurements of eta and the direct mechanical measurements consisting of weighing dust samples collected within the rotation dust chamber, at different rotation rates. By varying the ratio d/lambda_ {rm D} between the intergrain distance and the plasma Debye length, the effects predicted by Goertz and Ip (Goertz, C. K., and W-H. Ip, Geophys. Res. Lett., 11, 349, 1984), and subsequently reanalyzed in a more general fashion by Whipple et al. (Whipple, E. C., T. G. Northrop, and D. A. Mendis, J. Geophys. Rev., 90, 7405, 1985), as \"isolated\" dust grains become \"closely packed\" grains, have been demonstrated experimentally (Xu, W., N. D'Angelo, and R. L. Merlino, J. Geophys. Rev., 98, 7843, 1993). Similar results are presented and compared for two types of dust, kaolin and Al_2O _3, which have been studied in the experiment.\n\nLaboratory Studies of Charging Properties of Dust Grains in Astrophysical/Planetary Environments\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTankosic, D.; Abbas, M. M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nDust grains in various astrophysical environments are generally charged electrostatically by photoelectric emissions with UV/X-ray radiation, as well as by electron/ion impact. Knowledge of physical and optical properties of individual dust grains is required for understanding of the physical and dynamical processes in space environments and the role of dust in formation of stellar and planetary systems. In this paper we focus on charging of individual micron/submicron dust grains by processes that include: (a) UV photoelectric emissions involving incident photon energies higher than the work function of the material and b) electron impact, where low energy electrons are scattered or stick to the dust grains, thereby charging the dust grains negatively, and at sufficiently high energies the incident electrons penetrate the grain leading to excitation and emission of electrons referred to as secondary electron emission (SEE). It is well accepted that the charging properties of individual micron/submicron size dust grains are expected to be substantially different from the bulk materials. However, no viable models for calculation of the charging properties of individual micron size dust grains are available at the present time. Therefore, the photoelectric yields, and secondary electron emission yields of micron-size dust grains have to be obtained by experimental methods. Currently, very limited experimental data are available for charging of individual micron-size dust grains. Our experimental results, obtained on individual, micron-size dust grains levitated in an electrodynamic balance facility (at NASA-MSFC), show that: (1) The measured photoelectric yields are substantially higher than the bulk values given in the literature and indicate a particle size dependence with larger particles having order-of-magnitude higher values than for submicron-size grains; (2) dust charging by low energy electron impact is a complex process. Also, our measurements indicate that\n\nComplex Role of Secondary Electron Emissions in Dust Grain Charging in Space Environments: Measurements on Apollo 11 and 17 Dust Grains\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nAbbas, M. M.; Tankosic, D.; Spann, J. F.; LeClair, A. C.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nDust grains in various astrophysical environments are generally charged electrostatically by photoelectric emissions with radiation from nearby sources, or by electron/ion collisions by sticking or secondary electron emissions. Knowledge of the dust grain charges and equilibrium potentials is important for understanding of a variety of physical and dynamical processes in the interstellar medium (ISM), and heliospheric, interplanetary, planetary, and lunar environments. The high vacuum environment on the lunar surface leads to some unusual physical and dynamical phenomena involving dust grains with high adhesive characteristics, and levitation and transportation over long distances. It has been well recognized that the charging properties of individual micron/submicron size dust grains are expected to be substantially different from the corresponding values for bulk materials and theoretical models. In this paper we present experimental results on charging of individual dust grains selected from Apollo 11 and Apollo 17 dust samples by exposing them to mono-energetic electron beams in the 10- 400 eV energy range. The charging rates of positively and negatively charged particles of approximately 0.2 to 13 microns diameters are discussed in terms of the secondary electron emission (SEE) process, which is found to be a complex charging process at electron energies as low as 10-25 eV, with strong particle size dependence. The measurements indicate substantial differences between dust charging properties of individual small size dust grains and of bulk materials.\n\nSaharan dust plume charging observed over the UK\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHarrison, R. Giles; Nicoll, Keri A.; Marlton, Graeme J.; Ryder, Claire L.; Bennett, Alec J.\n\n2018-05-01\n\nA plume of Saharan dust and Iberian smoke was carried across the southern UK on 16th October 2017, entrained into an Atlantic cyclone which had originated as Hurricane Ophelia. The dust plume aloft was widely noticed as it was sufficiently dense to redden the visual appearance of the sun. Time series of backscatter from ceilometers at Reading and Chilbolton show two plumes: one carried upwards to 2.5âkm, and another below 800âm into the boundary layer, with a clear slot between. Steady descent of particles at about 50âcmâsâ1 continued throughout the morning, and coarse mode particles reached the surface. Plumes containing dust are frequently observed to be strongly charged, often through frictional effects. This plume passed over atmospheric electric field sensors at Bristol, Chilbolton and Reading. Consistent measurements at these three sites indicated negative plume charge. The lower edge plume charge density was (â8.0âÂ±â3.3)ânCâmâ2, which is several times greater than that typical for stratiform water clouds, implying an active in situ charge generation mechanism such as turbulent triboelectrification. A meteorological radiosonde measuring temperature and humidity was launched into the plume at 1412 UTC, specially instrumented with charge and turbulence sensors.

Solar UV radiation and the solar wind plasma charge micron size dust grains on the lunar surface with virtually no atmosphere. The electrostatically charged dust grains are believed to be levitated and transported long distances over the lunar terminator from the day to the night side. The current models do not fully explain the lunar dust phenomena and laboratory measurements are needed to experimentally determine the charging properties of lunar dust grains. An experimental facility has been developed in the Dusty Plasma Laboratory at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center MSFC for investigating the charging properties of individual micron/sub-micron size positively or negatively charged dust grains by levitating them in an electrodynamic balance in simulated space environments. In this paper, we present laboratory measurements on charging of Apollo 17 individual lunar dust grains by low energy electron beams in the 5-100 eV energy range. The measurements are made by levitating Apollo 17 dust grains of 0.2 to 10 micrometer diameters, in an electrodynamic balance and exposing them to mono-energetic electron beams. The charging rates and the equilibrium potentials produced by direct electron impact and by secondary electron emission processes are discussed.\n\nCharged dust in Saturn's magnetosphere\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nMendis, D.

Among the phenomena discussed are the formation of waves in the F-ring, the cause of eccentricities of certain isolated ringlets, and the origin and morphology of the broad diffuse E-ring. Magnetogravitational resonance of charged dust with nearby satellites, gyro-orbital resonances, and magnetogravitational capture of exogenic dust by the magnetosphere are used to explain individual observations. The effect of a ring current associated with the charged dust is evaluated. Finally, the cosmogonic implications of the magnetogravitational theory are discussed.\n\nLunar dust charging by photoelectric emissions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nAbbas, M.

It is shown that unlike the spherical dust grain, due to nonhomogeneity of charge distribution on the spheroidal dust surface, the resultant electric forces on electrons and ions are different. This process produces some surface charge density gradient on the nonspherical grain surface. Effects of a magnetic field and other plasma parameters on the properties of the dust particulate are studied.

M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe dust charging by electron impact is an important dust charging processes in astrophysical and planetary environments. Incident low energy electrons are reflected or stick to the grains charging the dust grains negatively. At sufficiently high energies electrons penetrate the grains, leading to excitation and emission of electrons referred to as secondary electron emission (SEE). Available classical theoretical models for calculations of SEE yields are generally applicable for neutral, planar, or bulk surfaces. These models, however, are not valid for calculations of the electron impact charging properties of electrostatically charged micron/submicron-size dust grains in astrophysical environments. Rigorous quantum mechanical models are not yet available, and the SEE yields have to be determined experimentally for development of more accurate models for charging of individual dust grains. At the present time, very limited experimental data are available for charging of individual micron-size dust grains, particularly for low energy electron impact. The experimental results on individual, positively charged, micron-size lunar dust grains levitated carried out by us in a unique facility at NASA-MSFC, based on an electrodynamic balance, indicate that the SEE by electron impact is a complex process. The electron impact may lead to charging or discharging of dust grains depending upon the grain size, surface potential, electron energy, electron flux, grain composition, and configuration (Abbas et al, 2010, 2012). In this paper, we discuss SEE charging properties of individual micron-size silica microspheres that are believed to be analogs of a class of interstellar dust grains. The measurements indicate charging of the 0.2m silica particles when exposed to 25 eV electron beams and discharging when exposed to higher energy electron beams. Relatively large size silica particles (5.2-6.82m) generally discharge to lower equilibrium potentials at both electron energies\n\nELECTRIC CHARGING OF DUST AGGREGATES AND ITS EFFECT ON DUST COAGULATION IN PROTOPLANETARY DISKS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nOkuzumi, Satoshi\n\n2009-06-20\n\nMutual sticking of dust aggregates is the first step toward planetesimal formation in protoplanetary disks. In spite that the electric charging of dust particles is well recognized in some contexts, it has been largely ignored in the current modeling of dust coagulation. In this study, we present a general analysis of the dust charge state in protoplanetary disks, and then demonstrate how the electric charging could dramatically change the currently accepted scenario of dust coagulation. First, we describe a new semianalytical method to calculate the dust charge state and gas ionization state self-consistently. This method is far more efficient thanmoreÂ Â» previous numerical methods, and provides a general and clear description of the charge state of a gas-dust mixture. Second, we apply this analysis to compute the collisional cross section of growing aggregates taking their charging into account. As an illustrative example, we focus on early evolutionary stages where the dust has been thought to grow into fractal (D {approx} 2) aggregates with a quasi-monodisperse (i.e., narrow) size distribution. We find that, for a wide range of model parameters, the fractal growth is strongly inhibited by the electric repulsion between colliding aggregates and eventually 'freezes out' on its way to the subsequent growth stage involving collisional compression. Strong disk turbulence would help the aggregates to overcome this growth barrier, but then it would cause catastrophic collisional fragmentation in later growth stages. These facts suggest that the combination of electric repulsion and collisional fragmentation would impose a serious limitation on dust growth in protoplanetary disks. We propose a possible scenario of dust evolution after the freezeout. Finally, we point out that the fractal growth of dust aggregates tends to maintain a low ionization degree and, as a result, a large magnetorotationally stable region in the disk.Â«Â less\n\nExtracting lunar dust parameters from image charge signals produced by the Lunar Dust Experiment\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStanley, J.; Kempf, S.; Horanyi, M.; Szalay, J.\n\n2015-12-01\n\nThe Lunar Dust Experiment (LDEX) onboard the Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) is an impact ionization dust detector used to characterize the lunar dust exosphere generated by the impacts of large interplanetary particles and meteor streams (Horanyi et al., 2015). In addition to the mass and speed of these lofted particles, LDEX is sensitive to their charge. The resulting signatures of impact events therefore provide valuable information about not only the ambient plasma environment, but also the speed vectors of these dust grains. Here, impact events produced from LDEX's calibration at the Dust Accelerator Laboratory are analyzed using an image charge model derived from the electrostatic simulation program, Coulomb. We show that parameters such as dust grain speed, size, charge, and position of entry into LDEX can be recovered and applied to data collected during LADEE's seven-month mission.\n\nDust motions in quasi-statically charged binary asteroid systems\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nMaruskin, Jared M.; Bellerose, Julie; Wong, Macken; Mitchell, Lara; Richardson, David; Mathews, Douglas; Nguyen, Tri; Ganeshalingam, Usha; Ma, Gina\n\n2013-03-01\n\nIn this paper, we discuss dust motion and investigate possible mass transfer of charged particles in a binary asteroid system, in which the asteroids are electrically charged due to solar radiation.

We derive the nonautonomous equations of motion for charged particles and an analytic representation for their lofting conditions. Particle trajectories and temporary relative equilibria are examined in relation to their moving forbidden regions, a concept we define and discuss.

M.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe dust charging by electron impact is an important dust charging process in Astrophysical, Planetary, and the Lunar environments. Low energy electrons are reflected or stick to the grains charging the dust grains negatively. At sufficiently high energies electrons penetrate the grain leading to excitation and emission of electrons referred to as secondary electron emission (SEE). Available theoretical models for the calculation of SEE yield applicable for neutral, planar or bulk surfaces are generally based on Sternglass Equation. However, viable models for charging of individual dust grains do not exist at the present time. Therefore, the SEE yields have to be obtained by some experimental methods at the present time. We have conducted experimental studies on charging of individual micron size dust grains in simulated space environments using an electrodynamic balance (EDB) facility at NASA-MSFC. The results of our extensive laboratory study of charging of individual micron-size dust grains by low energy electron impact indicate that the SEE by electron impact is a very complex process expected to be substantially different from the bulk materials. It was found that the incident electrons may lead to positive or negative charging of dust grains depending upon the grain size, surface potential, electron energy, electron flux, grain composition, and configuration. In this paper we give a more elaborate discussion about the possible effects of the AC field in the EDB on dust charging measurements by comparing the secondary electron emission time-period (tau (sub em) (s/e)) with the time-period (tau (sub ac) (ms)) of the AC field cycle in the EDB that we have briefly addressed in our previous publication.\n\nExperimental Study of Dust Grain Charging\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nSpann, James F; Venturini, Catherine C.; Comfort, Richard H.; Mian, Abbas M.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nThe results of an experimental study of the charging mechanisms of micron size dust grains are presented.

We determine a critical gas density above which the recombination of electrons and ions on the grain surface dominates over the gas-phase recombination. For this regime, we present a self-consistent analytical model, which allows us to calculate exactly the abundances of charged species in dusty gas, without making assumptions on the grain charge distribution. To demonstrate the importance ofmoreÂ Â» the proposed approach, we check whether the conventional approximation of low grain charges is valid for typical protoplanetary disks, and discuss the implications for dust coagulation and development of the âdead zoneâ in the disk. The presented model is applicable for arbitrary grain-size distributions and, for given dust properties and conditions of the disk, has only one free parameterâthe effective mass of the ions, shown to have a small effect on the results. The model can be easily included in numerical simulations following the dust evolution in dense molecular clouds and protoplanetary disks.Â«Â less\n\nJeans instability of a dusty plasma with dust charge variations\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nHakimi Pajouh, H., E-mail: hakimi@alzahra.ac.ir; Afshari, N.\n\n2015-09-15\n\nThe effect of the dust charge variations on the stability of a self-gravitating dusty plasma has been theoretically investigated.

Two main sampling stations were established: one upstream of the dust precipitator and one downstream. In addition, dust samplers were placed at different locations between the dust discharge and the end of the mine gallery. Long-lived radioactive dust was measured using cascade impactors and nylon cyclone dust samplers, and measurement of the radioactivity on the samples was carried out by conventional methods. Radon and thoron progeny were estimated using standard techniques. Experiments were conducted under a variety of airflow conditions. A maximum radioactive dust reduction of about 40% (approximately 20% caused by gravitational settling) at a ventilation rate of 0.61 m3/sec was obtained as a result of the combined action of water scrubbing and electrostatic precipitation by the charged water spray electrostatic precipitator. This represents the optimum efficiency attained within the range of ventilation rates investigated. The dust reduction efficiency of the charged water spray decreased with increasing ventilation rate, i.e., decreasing air residence time, and hence, reduced dust cloud/charged water droplets mixing time.\n\nPlasma flow around and charge distribution of a dust cluster in a rf discharge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSchleede, J.; Lewerentz, L.; Bronold, F.

The geometry of the cluster and its position in the sheath are fixed to the experimental values, prohibiting a mechanical response of the cluster. Electrically, however, the cluster and the plasma environment, mimicking also the experimental situation, are coupled self-consistently. We find a broad distribution of the charges collected by the grains. The ion flux shows on the scale of the Debye length strong focusing and shadowing inside and outside the cluster due to the attraction of the ions to the negatively charged grains, whereas the electron flux is characterized on this scale only by a weak spatial modulation of its magnitude depending on the rf phase. On the scale of the individual dust potentials, however, the electron flux deviates in the vicinity of the cluster strongly from the laminar flow associated with the plasma sheath. It develops convection patterns to compensate for the depletion of electrons inside the dust cluster.\n\nPositive column of a glow discharge in neon with charged dust grains (a review)\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nPolyakov, D.

Numerical analysis is carried out in the diffusion-drift approximation with allowance for the interaction of dust grains with metastable neon atoms. In a discharge with a dust grain cloud, the longitudinal electric field increases. As the number density of dust grains in an axisymmetric cylindrical dust cloud rises, the growth of the electric field saturates. It is shown that the contribution of metastable atoms to ionization is higher in amoreÂ Â» discharge with dust grains, in spite of the quenching of metastable atoms on dust grains. The processes of charging of dust grains and the dust cloud are considered. As the number density of dust grains rises, their charge decreases, while the space charge of the dust cloud increases.

The study has been made for both linear and non-linear scale regime of DIA mode. The observed results have been characterized in terms of background plasma responses towards dust surface responsible for dust charge fluctuation, invoking important dusty plasma parameters, especially the ion flow speed and dust size. The linear analyses confirm the nature of instability in DIA mode in presence of dust charge fluctuation. The instability shows a damping ofmoreÂ Â» DIA mode in subsonic flow regime followed by a gradual growth in instability in supersonic limit of ion flow. The strength of non-linearity and their existence domain is found to be driven by different dusty plasma parameters. As dust is ubiquitous in interstellar medium with plasma background, the study also addresses the possible effect of dust charging dynamics in gravito-electrostatic characterization and the stability of dust molecular clouds especially in proto-planetary disc. The observations are influential and interesting towards the understanding of dust settling mechanism and formation of dust environments in different regions in space.Â«Â less\n\nPossible method for diagnosing waves in dusty plasmas with magnetized charged dust particulates\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nRosenberg, M.; Shukla, P. K.\n\n2005-05-01\n\nWe discuss theoretically a possible method for diagnosing some features of dust wave behavior in a magnetized plasma containing small (tens of nm) charged dust grains whose motion is magnetized. It is easier to magnetize a small dust particle because its charge-to-mass ratio increases as its size decreases. However, it is more difficult to use the backscattering of light from the dust as a diagnostic as the dust size decreases below the diffraction limit. The idea proposed here is to measure the reduction in transmitted UV or optical light intensity due to enhanced extinction by small metal dust particles that have surface plasmon resonances at those wavelengths. Such measurements could indicate the spatial location of the dust density compressions or rarefactions, which may yield information on the dust wave behavior, or perhaps even charged dust transport. Parameters that may be relevant to possible laboratory dusty plasma experiments are discussed.\n\nSecondary Electron Emission from Dust and Its Effect on Charging\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nSaikia, B.

Like lunar surface, dust particles are also exposed to plasmas and UV radiation and, consequently they carry electrostatic charges. During Solar Energetic Particle events (SEPs) secondary electron emission plays a vital role in charging of lunar dusts. To study the lunar dust charging during SEPs on lunar wake region, we derived an expression for lunar dust potential and analysed how it varies with different electron temperatures and grain radii. Because of high energetic solar fluxes, secondary yield (Î´) values reach up to 2.3 for 0.5 Î¼m dust grain. We got maximum yield at an energy of 550 eV which is in well agreement with lunar sample experimental observation (Anderegg et al., 1972). It is observed that yield value increases with electron energy, reaches to a maximum value and then decreases. During SEPs heavier dust grains show larger yield values because of the geometry of the grains. On the wake region, the dust potential reaches up to -497 V for 0.5 Î¼m dust grain. The electric field of these grains could present a significant threat to manned and unmanned missions to the Moon.\n\nFlow stagnation at Enceladus: The effects of neutral gas and charged dust\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOmidi, N.; Tokar, R. L.; Averkamp, T.; Gurnett, D. A.; Kurth, W. S.; Wang, Z.\n\n2012-06-01\n\nEnceladus is one of Saturn's most active moons. It ejects neutral gas and dust particles from its southern plumes with velocities of hundreds of meters per second. The interaction between the ejected material and the corotating plasma in Saturn's magnetosphere leads to flow deceleration in ways that remain to be understood. The most effective mechanism for the interaction between the corotating plasma and the neutral gas is charge exchange which replaces the hotter corotating ions with nearly stationary cold ions that are subsequently accelerated by the motional electric field. Dust particles in the plume can become electrically charged through electron absorption and couple to the plasma through the motional electric field. The objective of this study is to determine the level of flow deceleration associated with each of these processes using Cassini RPWS dust impact rates, Cassini Plasma Spectrometer (CAPS) plasma data, and 3-D electromagnetic hybrid (kinetic ions, fluid electrons) simulations. Hybrid simulations show that the degree of flow deceleration by charged dust varies considerably with the spatial distribution of dust particles. Based on the RPWS observations of dust impacts during the E7 Cassini flyby of Enceladus, we have constructed a dust model consisting of multiple plumes. Using this model in the hybrid simulation shows that when the dust density is high enough for complete absorption of electrons at the point of maximum dust density, the corotating flow is decelerated by only a few km/s. This is not sufficient to account for the CAPS observation of flow stagnation in the interaction region. On the other hand, charge exchange with neutral gas plumes similar to the modeled dust plumes but with base (plume opening) densities of Ë109 cm-3 result in flow deceleration similar to that observed by CAPS. The results indicate that charge exchange with neutral gas is the dominant mechanism for flow deceleration at Enceladus.\n\nCHARGING AND COAGULATION OF DUST IN PROTOPLANETARY PLASMA ENVIRONMENTS\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nMatthews, L.

W., E-mail: lorin_matthews@baylor.edu\n\n2012-01-01\n\nCombining a particle-particle, particle-cluster, and cluster-cluster agglomeration model with an aggregate charging model, the coagulation and charging of dust particles in plasma environments relevant for protoplanetary disks have been investigated, including the effect of electron depletion in high dust density environments. The results show that charged aggregates tend to grow by adding small particles and clusters to larger particles and clusters, and that cluster-cluster aggregation is significantly more effective than particle-cluster aggregation. Comparisons of the grain structure show that with increasing aggregate charge the compactness factor, {phi}{sub {sigma}}, decreases and has a narrower distribution, indicating a fluffier structure. Neutral aggregatesmoreÂ Â» are more compact, with larger {phi}{sub {sigma}}, and exhibit a larger variation in fluffiness. Overall, increased aggregate charge leads to larger, fluffier, and more massive aggregates.Â«Â less\n\nStudies on plasma profiles and its effect on dust charging in hydrogen plasma\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKakati, B.; Kausik, S.

R.\n\n2018-02-01\n\nThe behavior of lunar dust on the Moon surface is quite complicated compared to that on the Earth surface due to the small lunar gravity and the significant influence of the complicated electrostatic filed in the Universe. Understanding such behavior is critical for the exploration of the Moon. This work develops a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model with the elastic-perfectly plastic constitutive equation and Drucker-Prager yield criterion to simulate the electrostatic transporting of multiple charged lunar dust particles. The initial electric field is generated based on the particle-in-cell method and then is superposed with the additional electric field from the charged dust particles to obtain the resultant electric field in the following process. Simulations of cohesive soil's natural failure and electrostatic transport of charged soil under the given electric force and gravity were carried out using the SPH model. Results obtained in this paper show that the negatively charged dust particles levitate and transport to the shadow area with a higher potential from the light area with a lower potential. The motion of soil particles finally comes to a stable state. The numerical result for final distribution of soil particles and potential profile above planar surface by the SPH method matches well with the experimental result, and the SPH solution looks sound in the maximum levitation height prediction of lunar dust under an uniform electric field compared to theoretical solution, which prove that SPH is a reliable method in describing the behavior of soil particles under a complicated electric field and small gravity field with the consideration of interactions among soil particles.\n\nEffect of energetic electrons on dust charging in hot cathode filament discharge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKakati, B.; Kausik, S.

Measurements in the 75-105 km region of atomic O, negatively-charged dust, positive ions and electrons with a suite of instruments on the payload were complemented by lidar measurements of atomic Na and temperature from the nearby ALOMAR observatory. The payload passed within 2.58 km of the lidar at an altitude of 90 km. A series of coupled models is used to explore the observations, leading to two significant conclusions. First, the atomic Na layer and the vertical profiles of negatively-charged dust (assumed to be meteoric smoke particles), electrons and positive ions, can be modelled using a self-consistent meteoric input flux. Second, electronic structure calculations and Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Markus theory are used to show that even small Fe-Mg-silicates are able to attach electrons rapidly and form stable negatively-charged particles, compared with electron attachment to O2 and O3. This explains the substantial electron depletion between 80 and 90 km, where the presence of atomic O at concentrations in excess of 1010 cm-3 prevents the formation of stable negative ions.\n\nChild-Langmuir flow in a planar diode filled with charged dust impurities\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nTang Xiaoyan; Institut fuer Theoretische Physik IV, Fakultaet fuer Physik und Astronomie, Ruhr-Universitaet Bochum, D-44870 Bochum; Shukla, Padma Kant\n\nThe Child-Langmuir (CL) flow in a planar diode in the presence of stationary charged dust particles is studied. The limiting electron current density and other diode properties, such as the electrostatic potential, the electron flow speed, and the electron number density, are calculated analytically. A comparison of the results with the case without dust impurities reveals that the diode parameters mentioned above decrease with the increase of the dust charge density. Furthermore, it is found that the classical scaling of D{sup -2} (the gap spacing D) for the CL current density remains exactly valid, while the scaling of V{sup 3/2}moreÂ Â» (the applied gap voltage V) can be a good approximation for low applied gap voltage and for low dust charge density.Â«Â less\n\nLaboratory Measurements on Charging of Individual Micron-Size Apollo-11 Dust Grains by Secondary Electron Emissions\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nTankosic, D.; Abbas, M. M.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nObservations made during Apollo missions, as well as theoretical models indicate that the lunar surface and dust grains are electrostatically charged, levitated and transported. Lunar dust grains are charged by UV photoelectric emissions on the lunar dayside and by the impact of the solar wind electrons on the nightside. The knowledge of charging properties of individual lunar dust grains is important for developing appropriate theoretical models and mitigating strategies. Currently, very limited experimental data are available for charging of individual micron-size size lunar dust grains in particular by low energy electron impact. However, experimental results based on extensive laboratory measurements on the charging of individual 0.2-13 micron size lunar dust grains by the secondary electron emissions (SEE) have been presented in a recent publication. The SEE process of charging of micron-size dust grains, however, is found to be very complex phenomena with strong particle size dependence. In this paper we present some examples of the complex nature of the SEE properties of positively charged individual lunar dust grains levitated in an electrodynamic balance (EDB), and show that they remain unaffected by the variation of the AC field employed in the above mentioned measurements.\n\nCharging and shielding of a non-spherical dust grain in a plasma\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhao, L.; Delzanno, G.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe interaction of objects with a plasma is a classic problem of plasma physics. Originally, it was investigated in the framework of probe theory but more recently its interest has grown in connection with space and complex or dusty plasmas. It is customary to assume that the dust grains are spherical, and theories such as the Orbital Motion Limited (OML) theory are usually applied to calculate the dust charge. However, in nature dust grains have a variety of sizes and shapes. It is therefore natural to ask about the influence of the dust shape on the charging and shielding process. In order to answer this question, we study the charging and shielding of a non-spherical dust grain immersed in a Maxwellian plasma at rest. We consider prolate ellipsoids, varying parametrically the aspect ratio while keeping the surface area constant. The study is conducted with CPIC [1], a newly developed Particle-In-Cell code in curvilinear geometry that conforms to objects of arbitrary shape. For a plasma with temperature ratio equal to unity and for a dust grain with characteristic size of the order of the Debye length, it is shown that the floating potential has a very weak dependence on the geometry, while the charge on the grain increases by a factor of three when the aspect ratio changes from one (a sphere) to hundred (a needle-like ellipsoid). These results are consistent with the higher capacitance of ellipsoidal dust grains, but also indicate that the screening length depends on the geometry. Scaling studies of the dependence of the charging time and screening length on the aspect ratio and plasma conditions are presented, including theoretical considerations to support the numerical results.

By employing extended PoincarÃ©-Lighthill-Kuo (PLK) method, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equations are derived for the right and left moving low amplitude DIA solitons. Their trajectories and corresponding phase shifts before and after their interaction are also obtained. It is found that in negatively charged dusty plasma above the critical dust charged to ion density ratio the positive polarity pulse is formed, while below the critical dust charged density ratio the negative polarity pulse of DIA soliton exist. However it is found that only positive polarity pulse of DIA solitons exist for the positively charged dust particles case in a magnetized nonthermal plasma. The nonlinearity coefficient in the KdV equation vanishes for the negatively charged dusty plasma case for a particular set of parameters. Therefore, at critical plasma density composition for negatively charged dust particles case, the modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equations having cubic nonlinearity coefficient of the DIA solitons, and their corresponding phase shifts are derived for the left and right moving solitons. The effects of the system parameters including the obliqueness of solitons propagation with respect to magnetic field direction, superthermality of electrons and concentration of positively/negatively static dust charged particles on the phase shifts of the colliding solitons are also discussed and presented numerically. The results are applicable to space magnetized dusty plasma regimes.\n\nThe Challenge of Incorporating Charged Dust in the Physics of Flowing Plasma Interactions\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJia, Y.; Russell, C. T.; Ma, Y.; Lai, H.; Jian, L.; Toth, G.\n\n2013-12-01\n\nThe presence of two oppositely charged species with very different mass ratios leads to interesting physical processes and difficult numerical simulations. The reconnection problem is a classic example of this principle with a proton-electron mass ratio of 1836, but it is not the only example. Increasingly we are discovering situations in which heavy, electrically charged dust particles are major players in a plasma interaction. The mass of a 1mm dust particle is about 2000 proton masses and of a 10 mm dust particle about 2 million proton masses. One example comes from planetary magnetospheres. Charged dust pervades Enceladus' southern plume. The saturnian magnetospheric plasma flows through this dusty plume interacting with the charged dust and ionized plume gas. Multiple wakes are seen downstream. The flow is diverted in one direction. The field aligned-current systems are elsewhere. How can these two wake features be understood? Next we have an example from the solar wind. When asteroids collide in a disruptive collision, the solar wind strips the nano-scale charged dust from the debris forming a dusty plasma cloud that may be over 106km in extent and containing over 100 million kg of dust accelerated to the solar wind speed. How does this occur, especially as rapidly as it appears to happen? In this paper we illustrate a start on understanding these phenomena using multifluid MHD simulations but these simulations are only part of the answer to this complex problem that needs attention from a broader range of the community.\n\nKP Equation in a Three-Dimensional Unmagnetized Warm Dusty Plasma with Variable Dust Charge\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nEl-Shorbagy, Kh.

The grain charge fluctuation is incorporated through the current balance equation. Using the perturbation method, a Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation is obtained. It has been shown that the charge fluctuation would modify the wave structures, and the waves in such systems are unstable due to high-order long wave perturbations.\n\nThe effect of the ambient plasma conditions on the variation of charge on dust grains\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChakraborty, M.; Kausik, S.

A dust beam containing submicron sized silver grains was passed through plasma. The dust grains were charged by the plasma particles as well as by primary electrons from the filament. An increase in the filament current increased both the plasma density and the number density of the primary electrons. The grain charge was found out both from the deflection of the dust grains and also from the floating potential. The experimental observations shows that the secondary emission caused by the primary electrons significantly influenced and played a prominent role in the establishment of charge on the grains.\n\nEffect of confining wall potential on charged collimated dust beam in low-pressure plasma\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nKausik, S.

K.\n\n2013-05-01\n\nThe effect of confining wall potential on charged collimated dust beam in low-pressure plasma has been studied in a dusty plasma experimental setup by applying electrostatic field to each channel of a multicusp magnetic cage. Argon plasma is produced by hot cathode discharge method at a pressure of 5Ã10-4 millibars and is confined by a full line cusped magnetic field confinement system. Silver dust grains are produced by gas-evaporation technique and move upward in the form of a collimated dust beam due to differential pressure maintained between the dust and plasma chambers. The charged grains in the beam after coming out from the plasma column enter into the diagnostic chamber and are deflected by a dc field applied across a pair of deflector plates at different confining potentials. Both from the amount of deflection and the floating potential, the number of charges collected by the dust grains is calculated. Furthermore, the collimated dust beam strikes the Faraday cup, which is placed above the deflector plates, and the current (ËpA) so produced is measured by an electrometer at different confining potentials. The experimental results demonstrate the significant effect of confining wall potential on charging of dust grains.\n\nDust Charging in Saturn's Rings: Observations and Theory\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHoranyi, M.\n\n2008-12-01\n\nSaturn's rings show a variety of dusty plasma processes. The electrostatic charging and subsequent orbital dynamics of small grains can establish their size and spatial distributions, for example. Simultaneously, dust can alter the composition, density and temperature of the plasma surrounding it. The dynamics of charged dust particles can be surprisingly complex and fundamentally different from the well understood limits of gravitationally dominated motions of neutral particles or the adiabatic motion of electrons and ions in electromagnetic fields that dominate gravity. This talk will focus on recent Cassini observations at Saturn that are best explained by theories describing the effects of the magnetospheric fields and plasmas on the rings. As our best examples, we will discuss the physics describing the large-scale structure of the E-ring, and the formation of 'spokes' over the dense rings of Saturn.\n\nThe first radial-mode Lorentzian Landau damping of dust acoustic space-charge waves\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLee, Myoung-Jae; Jung, Young-Dae, E-mail: ydjung@hanyang.ac.kr; Department of Applied Physics and Department of Bionanotechnology, Hanyang University, Ansan, Kyunggi-Do 15588\n\n2016-05-15\n\nThe dispersion properties and the first radial-mode Lorentzian Landau damping of a dust acoustic space-charge wave propagating in a cylindrical waveguide dusty plasma which contains nonthermal electrons and ions are investigated by employing the normal mode analysis and the method of separation of variables. It is found that the frequency of dust acoustic space-charge wave increases as the wave number increases as well as the radius of cylindrical plasma does. However, the nonthermal property of the Lorentzian plasma is found to suppress the wave frequency of the dust acoustic space-charge wave. The Landau damping rate of the dust acoustic space-chargemoreÂ Â» wave is derived in a cylindrical waveguide dusty plasma. The damping of the space-charge wave is found to be enhanced as the radius of cylindrical plasma and the nonthermal property increase. The maximum Lorentzian Landau damping rate is also found in a cylindrical waveguide dusty plasma. The variation of the wave frequency and the Landau damping rate due to the nonthermal character and geometric effects are also discussed.Â«Â less\n\nEffects of nonthermal distribution of electrons and polarity of net dust-charge number density on nonplanar dust-ion-acoustic solitary waves.\n\nPubMed\n\nMamun, A A; Shukla, P K\n\n2009-09-01\n\nEffects of the nonthermal distribution of electrons as well as the polarity of the net dust-charge number density on nonplanar (viz. cylindrical and spherical) dust-ion-acoustic solitary waves (DIASWs) are investigated by employing the reductive perturbation method.

Matsoukas and M. Russell, J. Appl. Phys. 77, 4285 (1995)] with no exact solution. In the present work, using the system size expansion method of Van Kampen along with the linear noise approximation, a Fokker-Planck equation with an exact Gaussian solution is developed by expanding the master equation. The Gaussian solution has time-dependent mean and variance governed by two ordinary differential equations modeling the nonstationary process of dust particle charging. The model is tested via the comparison of its results to the results obtained by solving the master equation numerically. The electron and ion currents are calculated through the orbital motion limited theory. At various times of the nonstationary process of charging, the model results are in a very good agreement with the master equation results. The deviation is more significant when the standard deviation of the charge is comparable to the mean charge in magnitude.\n\nA Laboratory Study of the Charging/Discharging Mechanisms of a Dust Particle Exposed to an Electron Beam\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVenturini, C.
