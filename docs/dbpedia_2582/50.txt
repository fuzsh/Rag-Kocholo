In 1900 Auja al-Hafir was a small border crossing to British controlled Egypt but in 1912 the Ottomans enlarged the base, building a large administrative center, hospital and apartment buildings for military personnel. The water-tower and railway station were built in 1916 for the Ottoman military as part of a plan to invade Egypt and capture the Suez Canal.

With the failure of the invasion in 1917 the Turks withdrew to Beer Sheva and Allied troops then used explosives to destroy 31km of the line and 6 bridges.

In the years following WW1 most of the stone from the buildings was looted and taken to Gaza. Now only the water tower, the ruins of a few station buildings and some army barracks remain. The stone tower 11m high was topped with 2 metal tanks to supply water to the steam engines.
