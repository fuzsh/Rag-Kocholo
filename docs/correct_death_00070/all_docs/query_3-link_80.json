        "text": "The Arts and Cultural Council of the Rappahannock\n\nThe Arts and Cultural Council of the Rappahannock (ACCR) is a non-profit 501(c)(3) organization serving the city of Fredericksburg, the town of Colonial Beach, and the counties of Caroline, King George, Spotsylvania, Stafford, and Westmoreland, Virginia.\n\nCentral Rappahannock Heritage Center\n\nThe Central Rappahannock Heritage Center archives and preserves historical documents and photographs pertaining to the history and people from the counties of Caroline, Stafford, King George, Spotsylvania and the City of Fredericksburg in Virginia.\n\nFredericksburg Area Museum\n\nThe Fredericksburg Area Museum, housed in historic Town Hall/ Market House (c. 1816), has been part of the fabric of community life throughout the Fredericksburg area for nearly three decades. It tells the stories of the Fredericksburg community and regions, from the Virginia Indians pre-contact to the Black Lives Matter Movement. Their goal is to connect people to our communityâ€™s history.\n\nFredericksburg City Cemetery\n\nThe Fredericksburg City Cemetery was established in 1844. Today, it continues to tell the story of Fredericksburg's history.

Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Wilderness, and Spotsylvania--this is America's battleground, where the Civil War roared to its bloody climax. No place more vividly reflects the War's tragic cost in all its forms. A town bombarded and looted. Farms large and small ruined. Refugees by the thousands forced into the countryside. More than 85,000 men wounded; 15,000 killed--most in graves unknown.\n\nThe George Washington Foundation\n\nThe mission of The George Washington Foundation is to enhance the public understanding and appreciation of the lives, values, and legacies of George Washington, Fielding and Betty Washington Lewis, and their families.\n\nGeorge Washington's Boyhood Home at Ferry Farm\n\nHistoric Kenmore Plantation\n\nGreater Fredericksburg Tourism Partnership\n\nFXBG.com has a comprehensive list for tourists of area historic attractions within the City of Fredericksburg and the counties of Spotsylvania and Stafford, Virginia.\n\nHistoric Court Records\n\nThe information presented by Historic Court Records are primarily extracts of \"loose papers\" - the paper trail behind Court Order Book entries. Fortunately, it appears that most \"loose papers\" survived the turmoil of the Civil War even though Fredericksburg changed hands a number of times and was decimated during the 1862 Battle of Fredericksburg.\n\nHistoric Fredericksburg Foundation\n\nBoyhood home of George Washington and site of crucial Civil war battles, the Fredericksburg Virginia area boasts a storied past and a delightful old town center. The Historic Fredericksburg Foundation is devoted to preserving and revitalizing our historic environment through member events, research, grants, education, easements, building markers, and advocacy.\n\nJames Monroe Museum and Memorial Library The James Monroe Museum and Memorial Library, located in historic downtown Fredericksburg, Virginia, holds the country's largest collection of artifacts and documents related to the fifth president of the United States.\n\nWashington Heritage Museums\n\nWashington Heritage Museums is an organization with several hundred members.
