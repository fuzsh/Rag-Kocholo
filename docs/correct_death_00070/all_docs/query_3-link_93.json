His assailant, a \"whiskey-crazed\" man named Mark Tiner, fled the scene on horseback and was captured in Hancock's pasture approximately 3 ½ miles north of the city. Fahey was able to identify Tiner before dying of his wounds. Officer Fahey, according to local press, \"was an efficient officer, and fell while in the discharge of his duty.\" He is the first Austin police officer known to have died in the line of duty. Memorial located at APD Headquarters, 715 E. 8th St.\n\nOfficer John Gaines, 50, (November 19, 1913)\n\nOfficer John Gaines, the only African American officer on the Austin police force, was shot by George Booth, a deputy constable, at 6th Street and Trinity Street on November 19, 1913.

At that time, African-American officers were not allowed to arrest Caucasians. Officer Gaines and his wife, Sarah, were originally from Big Spring, Texas.

The shooting followed an argument between Officer Allen and the editor of a black newspaper in San Antonio. Officer Allen was angered by reports that he had mistreated several African-American women he had arrested. After a confrontation with the editor by the wagon yard near Red River Street, Officer Allen followed the man to Jennings' drugstore. The editor, arriving first, drew a handgun from a briefcase he had left at the store and shot Officer Allen as he entered, his own gun drawn and ready. According to a newspaper story of the time, Officer Allen was killed only thirty feet from the site where Officer John Gaines had died two years earlier.
