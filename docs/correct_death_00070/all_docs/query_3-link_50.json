        "text": "By all accounts, James Monroe Evans was the oldest child of Drewery and Theodocia Jacobs Evans. Many researchers place his birth in 1811. However, in the 1810 US Census for Montgomery County, Virginia, a very young male child was included within the household of Drury (viz., Drewery) Evans. Although it is possible that this indicates an older sibling who died young and, therefore, is otherwise unknown to history, it seems plausible to identify this child with James Monroe. Moreover, in later census records, James Monroe stated his age in 1850 as forty, in 1860 as forty-nine, and in 1870 as fifty-nine. An age of forty in 1850 is consistent with a birth year of either 1809 or 1810 and, ages forty-nine and fifty-nine in 1860 and 1870, respectively, are consistent with a birth year of either 1810 or 1811. Considering all of these records together, it seems probable that James Monroe Evans was born in Montgomery County, Virginia, in 1810. As a small child, he would have accompanied his parents and grandparents to Overton, later Fentress, County, Tennessee, and it seems likely that he grew up in this locality. There is also evidence that sometime around 1830 the household of Drewery Evans may have relocated for a short time to Morgan County, Illinois. Presumably, this included James Monroe as well as his brothers and sisters. It is not known why the family did not remain in Illinois, but returned to the vicinity of Fentress County, Tennessee, and Clinton County, Kentucky, before 1840. Perhaps, the violence of the Black Hawk War, which occurred in northern and western Illinois in the summer of 1832, motivated their return, but this is purely speculation.\n\nJames Monroe Evans and Sarah Elizabeth Hatfield were probably married in Fentress County, Tennessee, about 1836. It is family tradition that she was distantly related to the Hatfield family that later became embroiled in the famous (or infamous) feud with the McCoys. Concomitantly, a household headed by James Evans was included in the 1840 US Census for Fentress County, Tennessee, and, moreover, consisted of a young adult couple, both in their twenties, and a male and a female child, both under five years of age. Obviously, this is in exact accordance with the known family of James Monroe Evans. Alternatively, a household also headed by James Evans appeared in the 1840 US Census for Clinton County, Kentucky, and contained two very young children along with a young adult couple. (As indicated elsewhere, the households of \"Drewry\" and Carter Evans were also resident in Clinton County in 1840.) However, both children were identified as females in the population schedule, which is evidently inconsistent with identification of the oldest child of James Monroe and Sarah Elizabeth Hatfield Evans as a son, Thomas. Nevertheless, it is plausible that this could simply be an error and, accordingly, this household should be identified as that of James Monroe Evans. (Of course, the purpose of early federal censuses was merely the determination of congressional representation, therefore, such a mistake would not have been considered serious.) Within this context, it would seem certain that one (or both) of these households was, indeed, that of James Monroe and Sarah Elizabeth Hatfield Evans, but all things considered, a location in Tennessee seems more likely. (It is not impossible that they were included in the population schedules for both counties, particularly if they were relocating in the census year.) In the 1840's the extended family of Drewery Evans, including James M. and Sarah Hatfield Evans and their children, migrated to Casey County, Kentucky. Several land patents were granted to family members by the Casey County Court, among which was Kentucky Land Patent No. 13156, issued on June 29, 1849, to James Evans, which conveyed one hundred acres along Riffe Creek and the Green River. The confluence of Riffe Creek with the Green River is slightly less than two miles westward and across the main channel from the present village of Dunnville, Kentucky. A more vexing issue is that the name, \"John M. Evans\", appeared in the population schedule of the 1850 US Census for Casey County, instead of James M. Evans as would have been expected. In addition, no separate listing for any James Evans can be found; however, upon examination of the age and birthplace of John M. Evans and the names, ages, and birthplaces of other members of his household and comparison of these with independent sources, it seems almost certain that this name was recorded in error and that John M. Evans was, in fact, James Monroe Evans. Indeed, his wife's name was given as Sarah and the names of the children were Thomas, Rebecca J., Louis C., William B., Dudly, Disha, and John. Clearly, this closely accords with oral family tradition.1 Subsequently, the family of James M. and Sarah Evans can be found in the 1860 US Census for Casey County in which the children were listed as Rebecca, Lewis C., William, Doctor D., Therissa, John, Christopher C., and Mary M. Furthermore, in these census records it is evident that Therissa and Disha (or Dosha/Doshia) obviously must have been the same individual. Undoubtedly, these names are misspellings or derivatives of \"Theodocia\", which was her grandmother's given name. (Also, in subsequent census and cemetery records, the birth year for Doshia Evans appears as 1849; however, censuses of both 1850 and 1860 clearly indicate that it must have been instead 1847.) Concomitantly, it is evident that the oldest son, Thomas, must have died and a son, Christopher, and daughter, Mary, must have been born during the 1850's. Moreover, additional consideration of subsequent census records clearly supports the presumption that the first five children of James M. and Sarah Hatfield Evans were born before the family settled in Casey County, which implies their arrival after January of 1845. Even so, not long after the end of the Civil War, James Monroe and Sarah Elizabeth Hatfield Evans, together with all their surviving children and grandchildren left Casey County and moved to Scott County, Illinois. According to Mary Margaret, their youngest daughter, this happened about 1867 or 1868. The journey required more than a month and the first place the family settled after their arrival was on land presently in Winchester Township and later known as the Jake Peak farm.2 Moreover, Larry M. Evans in his research notes indicates that this would have been two or three miles southwest of the town of Winchester near the Frame Cemetery (which is located in Section One in Township Thirteen of Range Thirteen). This is supported by a plat map of Scott County published in 1873. According to further family tradition, it is said that James Monroe and his sons quickly set about clearing the land and making improvements. Subsequently, in the 1870 US Census for Scott County the households of James, Lewis, and William Evans appeared and can be identified with those of James Monroe Evans and his two sons, Lewis Carter and William Bramlet Evans. Previously, Lewis Carter Evans had married in Casey County a widow, Nancy Ann Davis Henson. She had a son and daughter from her first marriage and these two step-children, along with four younger children of their own were listed in the population schedule; all born in Kentucky. (Although, it is family tradition that one child was born on the journey from Casey County, which to be consistent would correspond to the youngest child for the household, listed in the census as \"Holland\", but which from more reliable family sources and later census records is known to have been named Harlan and born in April of 1868.) William Bramlet Evans married Mary Ann Northcutt in Scott County late in 1869 and the couple had no children at the time of the 1870 census. A more perplexing difficulty is presented by the apparent presence of a son, Jacob, instead of a daughter, Doshia, in the household of James M. and Sarah Hatfield Evans according to the 1870 population schedule. Indeed, there has been some confusion as to exact name of this child both in previous census records and family tradition, however, there has been no confusion as to gender. Nevertheless, the corresponding individual was clearly listed in these census records erroneously as a male. To remedy this difficulty, some researchers assert that the Doshia's middle name was Jacob or as is more likely, Jacobs, which was the maiden name of her grandmother. If this is so, presuming that she was not immediately present when the family was described for the census, it might have been assumed from this name that she was a male. This seems more credible if one recalls that in 1870 the Evans family would have been relative newcomers to Scott County and, consequently, would almost certainly not have been well known to the enumerator, who was presumably a local resident. Furthermore, it seems evident that the son, Christopher C., present in the household of James Monroe and Sarah Elizabeth Hatfield Evans in 1860, must have died sometime in the intervening decade since he was absent in 1870.3 A further difficulty with the 1870 population schedule is the apparent reappearance of a son named Thomas in the household. His age was given as nine, which would imply a birth year of 1860 or 1861. In contrast, in the 1900 census, Sarah Elizabeth Evans stated that she had given birth to nine children, seven of whom were then still living. Clearly, this is in conflict with identification of this child as a son of James Monroe and Sarah Elizabeth Evans (although it is possible that he was a relative).4 Moreover, in support of this conclusion, there is no evidence of this son in any later record nor at this time in history does it seem likely that the same name would have been conferred a second time to a child in the same immediate family. In passing, four other Evans households appeared in the 1870 US Census for Scott County, viz., Carter, Stephen, Drury, and William Evans. Of these, Carter H. and Malinda Rhodes Evans can definitely be identified as the younger brother and sister-in-law of James Monroe Evans. Likewise, Stephen Madison and Drury Sampson Evans were their sons and, hence, nephews of James Monroe Evans. William Evans, who was born in Tennessee, not Kentucky, was almost certainly a cousin that had become closely associated with this branch of the Evans family through marriage and, perhaps, military service. Furthermore, according to Ms. Elaine Ortman, a descendant of both James Monroe and William M. Evans, all of these Evans families migrated from Kentucky to Illinois together.\n\nJames Monroe Evans reportedly died about 1875, but the year is uncertain. He was reportedly buried in Baker Cemetery, although there seems to be no marker or record confirming this other than settled family tradition. (Baker Cemetery is also known as West Rutledge Cemetery and is located in Scott County about three to four miles west northwest of the county seat, Winchester, and two miles east of the former village of Bloomfield.) Sarah Elizabeth Hatfield Evans survived her husband until August of 1906. She reportedly lived the last few years of her life at the southwest corner of the intersection at the west end of Peak's Lane. On current maps of Scott County, it appears that this location corresponds to the intersection of Peak Lane and Moore Road about two miles southwest of Winchester. Larry M. Evans also reported that he was told by an individual who remembered the children of James M. and Sarah Evans well that they were of great size with all of the men being over six feet, four inches in height. Doctor Dudley was said to be the largest, standing six feet, seven inches tall and weighing some three hundred pounds.\n\n1. Thomas Evans, born ~1837 in Fentress Co., TN.

Rebecca Jane Evans* married John Hankins. He evidently was the father of three children from a previous marriage, viz., Julia, John, and Elizabeth (Lizzie) Hankins. Furthermore it has been reported that John and Rebecca Jane Evans Hankins had a fifth son, Jack, born in 1883; however, in the population schedule of 1900 Rebecca stated that she was the mother of four children, all still living, which implies that this is an error. In addition, there are two civil war era stones set in Winchester City Cemetery, viz., one for Corp. Jno Hankins and one for Corp. John S. Hankins. Both affirm service in Company K of the 154th Illinois Infantry. Moreover, one of these appears considerably more recent, therefore, it is likely that they refer to one and the same person, viz., John Hankins husband of Rebecca Jane Evans.\n\n2-1.

The 1880 Scott County mortality schedule reveals the death of Lora A. Evans, an infant of only eight months of age who, thus, would have been born about the month of April in the year 1879. Furthermore, the death was reported to have occurred in \"Township 13 Range 13\", which is located in the southwestern corner of Scott County and corresponds precisely with the residence of William Bramlet and Mary Northcutt Evans as reported in the corresponding population schedule as well as other sources. Within this context, it has been reported by other researchers that an unnamed infant was born to William and Mary Northcutt Evans in 1886 and in addition that this child died at or shortly after birth. Indeed, this presumption is further supported by the population schedule of the 1900 US Census for Scott County in which Mary Northcutt Evans stated that she had been the mother of seven children, six of whom were then still living. Of course, several other related and unrelated Evans families were resident in Scott County in 1880. Of these only William's two brothers, Carter and John, were resident contemporaneously in \"Township 13 Range 13\" and, as such, could have been parents of the infant. All of the others seem to have been living elsewhere within the county, particularly in the town of Winchester, and several seem to have been too old in any case. Moreover, the birth chronology of these families strongly suggests that this child was the daughter of William and Mary Northcutt Evans. Therefore, it seems likely that Lora A. Evans was in fact the unnamed infant putatively born to William and Mary Evans in 1886 and that later family researchers have simply proposed an incorrect chronology.

Evans, resident in Fentress County. However, she cannot be the same individual as Effie Evans, wife of Logan Lee Evans, since this couple appeared in both the 1920 and 1930 Scott County population schedules and there is no evidence that they ever lived outside of Illinois.

Richards, survived until 1943. Therefore, William and Daisy Evans must have divorced after only a few years of marriage. Indeed, their daughter, Stella Richards, born ~1902, appears in subsequent census population schedules as resident in in the household of Thomas and Daisy Edmonson. Concomitantly, William Richards can be identified as the youngest son of William D. and Margaret Emma Evans Richards of Casey County, Kentucky; hence, William, was Daisy's first cousin once removed. Subsequently, William lived in Jacksonville, Illinois, and married Anna M. Austin in 1912. Moreover, in the 1940 census William stated that he was divorced, presumably from Anna, and was the owner of a tavern.

Indeed, Mr. Bruce York has identified Thomas Evans, son of James Monroe Evans, as alive in Fentress County, Tennessee, in 1900; however, it seems more likely that this is a mistaken identification. In particular, this individual gave the place and time of his birth as Tennessee in October of 1862. Of course, at this time the family of James Monroe and Sarah Hatfield Evans were resident in Casey County, Kentucky. More problematical is that the census record actually stated his name as \"Than\" Evans. In all probability this is a diminutive for Jonathan and not Thomas. Although it is not impossible that some of the descendants of James Monroe and Sarah Hatfield Evans might have returned to Tennessee, there is no evidence that any of them did so.
