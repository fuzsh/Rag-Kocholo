        "text": "President James Monroe, the fifth president of the United States, was laid to rest in Hollywood Cemetery in 1858, twenty-seven years after his death in New York City. His tomb, locally known as \"The Birdcage\", was designed by Albert Lybrock and erected in 1859.\n\nThe structure is made of a granite sarcophagus that is surrounded by an ornate Gothic-style cage made from cast iron. It was labeled a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service in 1971 due to its unique architecture. In 2015, the tomb was repaired and restored to its original ivory color by the Department of General Services. The Birdcage is located in Presidents Circle overlooking the James River. Monroe's wife, daughter, and son-in-law are buried nearby."
