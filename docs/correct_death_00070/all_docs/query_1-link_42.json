        "text": "James Monroe (April 28, 1758 – July 4, 1831) was the 5th President of the United States from 1817 to 1825. Monroe was the last president who was a Founding Father of the United States and the last president from the Virginian dynasty and the Republican Generation.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBorn in Westmoreland County, Virginia, Monroe was of the planter class and fought in the American Revolutionary War. He was wounded in the Battle of Trenton with a musket ball to his shoulder. After studying law under Thomas Jefferson from 1780 to 1783, he served as a delegate in the Continental Congress. As an anti-federalist delegate to the Virginia convention that considered ratification of the United States Constitution, Monroe opposed ratification, claiming it gave too much power to the central government.\n\nHe took an active part in the new government, and in 1790 he was elected to the Senate of the first United States Congress. He gained experience as an executive as the Governor of Virginia and rose to national prominence as a diplomat in France, when he helped negotiate the Louisiana Purchase in 1803. During the War of 1812, Monroe held the critical roles of Secretary of State and the Secretary of War under President James Madison.\n\nAppearances[]\n\nIn-universe: Monroe is still acknowledged, albeit not mentioned or discussed in Olympus Has Fallen. He is shown in one of the White House's personal bedrooms belonging to Benjamin Asher as he is dressing for a meeting and talking to his son Connor.\n\nSee Also[]\n\nList of Presidents of the United States"
