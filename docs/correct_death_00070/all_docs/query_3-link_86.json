        "text": "James Monroe Williamson\n\nOn Saturday, March 15th, the town of Littleton lost one of our own, well loved and well respected retired police officer, Lieutenant James Williamson. Jim aka \"Willy\" to some of his many close friends and co-workers, was born on October 2, 1951 in the small town of Shenandoah Iowa. Jim's family relocated to Denver when Jim was just a toddler and finally to Littleton where he grew up, attending Eugene Field Elementary, Isaac Newton Junior High, and graduating from Arapahoe High school in 1969. A talented all around athlete Jim played and lettered in baseball, basketball and football. As a youth Jim was a very hard worker and while still a student often juggled two jobs at once, ultimately deciding to pursue a career in law enforcement. After graduating from high school he went on to attend nearby Arapahoe Community College where he was a star player on their basketball team. Jim then attended Metropolitan State College where he earned a degree in criminal justice and in December of 1984 received a Masters in Criminal Justice from the University of Colorado.\n\nOn August 17th,1974 Jim married his high school sweetheart, Cindy Calhoun, an elementary school teacher. Later the same year Jim was hired by the Littleton Police Dept, where he quickly ascended the career ladder, first to Sergeant and later to Lieutenant. He served for 34 years until retiring in December of 2008. Fellow Littleton officer and good friend Sean Dugan eloquently wrote...\n\n\" Jim's enthusiastic spirit, his great sense of humor, his positive attitude and friendship sustained me in some of the most difficult moments in my life and I will never forget that.\"\n\nThis sums Jim up perfectly, he was respected, appreciated and well liked by all throughout his life.\n\nEarlier during his years with Littleton Jim received a Medal of Valor after risking his own life to save a fellow officer who had been disarmed during a pursuit. Jim sustained a badly broken leg during the incident yet was able to apprehend the culprit on one leg. Jim also had the prestigious honor of attending the F.B. I. academy in Quantico , Va. for specialized training. He was one of the first , Drug Recognition Experts in the state of Colorado, and later became a trainer traveling throughout the United States to educate fellow officers in drug recognition. Later in his career Jim became an expert in the important accreditation process. Even after retiring Jim's expertise and precision in the area of accreditation was further utilized by the Colorado Bureau of Investigation, Littleton's Police Dept. and finally with the Golden Police Dept. where just one year ago Jim returned to work full time to oversee and complete the time consuming accreditation process. Jim greatly enjoyed his many months in the beautiful city of Golden surrounded by wonderful people whom he enjoyed working with tremendously.\n\nThough extremely hard working and dedicated to his work Jim balanced his professional and personal life well and he and his wife Cindy, of almost 40 years, enjoyed their life together surrounded by a long succession of lovable golden retrievers and feisty felines. Avid baseball fans and season ticket holders from day one, they frequently attended Rockies games together and with family. Jim also enjoyed traveling across the states with good friends Glenn, Russ and ....?? visiting major league baseball parks, and other popular attractions. Often seen riding on his beloved Harley Davidson. Anyone that knew Jim knew his passion for riding. Jim had a fun loving silly side as well, which was especially brought out in more recent years by his youngest niece Carly, six, whom he cherished. Always meticulous, always a serious and dedicated worker, yet what stands out the most is a caring and generous soul who laughed often and always wore a smile which will be missed forever by his loved ones.\n\nJim is survived by his mother Betty Williamson, and sister Sherry Sidell (Rick), of Missouri. His sister, Jan Hazelett of Centennial. Mother-in-law Sonja Calhoun, Susan and Marty Stuber, Michael and Sue Calhoun and Pamela Calhoun. Jim had numerous nieces and nephews and cousins. He was preceded in death by his father Robert Williamson and father- in- law Wayne Calhoun and his older brother Dale, and sister-in-law Gail.\n\nService Information"
