        "text": "Inaugural Address. “In contemplating what we have still to perform, the heart of every citizen must expand with joy when he reflects how near our government has approached to perfection; that in respect to it we have no essential improvement to make; that the great object is to preserve it in the essential principles and features which characterize it, and that is to be done by preserving the virtue and enlightening the minds of the people ...\"\n\n“Tours” eastern states and territories including Maryland, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Maine, Michigan, Vermont, and Ohio. Promotes national unity between Democratic-Republicans and Federalists. The tour has been regarded as the beginning of the “Era of Good Feelings,” a period characterized by a sense of national purpose and a desire for unity among Americans after the War of 1812.\n\nAuthorizes three diplomats to go to South America to gather information about the governments in a letter to the acting Secretary of State. The commissioners set sail on August 24th and returning in July 1818.\n\nThe First Seminole War begins after U.S. authorities attempt to capture runaway slaves living among the Seminole Indians. The Seminole people had begun hiding runaway slaves who escaped southern plantations. African descendants and Native Americans fought and won repeatedly against the United States military until Florida was forcibly acquired from Spain in 1819.\n\nWith Monroe’s agreement, Secretary of War John Calhoun directs General Andrew Jackson to confront the Seminole Indians. “. . . [A]dopt the necessary measures to terminate a conflict which it has ever been the desire of the President. . .to avoid; but which is now made necessary by their Settled hostilities.” [Andrew Jackson Papers, vol IV, p. 163.] In a letter of 12/28/1817, Monroe himself authorized Jackson to take action against the Seminoles.\n\nIn a Special Message to Congress, announces the occupation of Amelia Island (on the east coast of Florida) which had become a haven for pirates, and allegedly a haven for Venezuelan revolutionaries. States that Spain was unaware of these activities or “utterly unable to prevent them.”\n\nExecution ordered by General Jackson of two British citizens, Alexander Arbuthnot and Robert Ambrister. Both were convicted by a military tribunal of assisting US enemies in the Seminole War. This caused a diplomatic controversy and was later criticized by a report of a House Committee on Military Affairs.\n\nSigning of the Anglo-American Convention (also known as the Treaty of 1818) between Great Britain and the United States, which established the boundary between the U.S. and Canada, fishing rights, and an economic intervention on the issue of American slaves. The treaty is ratified by the Senate on 01/25/1819.\n\nSecond Annual Message to Congress. Recounts the disagreements with Spain, and the US seizure of Amelia Island which had \"become the theater of every species of lawless adventure.\" Also discusses General Jackson's actions in the Seminole War and promises to provide copies of correspondence with the General. Calls for Congress to consider legislation to \"prevent the extinction\" of \"independent savage communities.\" This would require that \"their independence as communities should cease, and that the control of the United States over them should be complete and undisputed.\" The goal would be \"to civilize them.\"\n\nThe Panic of 1819 begins and is the first widespread financial crisis in the U.S. Many factors contribute to this, including overexpansion of credit post-War of 1812, low prices of European imports, and the collapse of the export market, especially cotton prices, starting in the month of January.\n\nRep. James Tallmadge Jr. (NY) offers two amendments to a Missouri Statehood Bill that catalyze a debate on slavery. One amendment would restrict further slavery in Missouri, and the other would set a timeline for freeing enslaved persons already in the territory.\n\nSigning in Washington City of the Adams-Onis Treaty with Spain, (also known as the Transcontinental Treaty, and ratified in 1821), which ceded Florida to the U.S., renounced claims to Oregon, gained recognition of Spanish sovereignty over Texas, and established the boundary line between the U.S. and New Spain.\n\nSigns the Steerage Act of 1819, (3 Stat 488) the first U.S. law regulating the conditions of travelers arriving and departing by sea. Required U.S. customs agents to produce a written manifesto of the passengers’ demographics and set the stage for quotas and selective bans of ethnic groups.\n\nSigns an act, (3 Stat 532), authorizing the Navy to patrol and implement more control to combat the importation of slaves after its abolition, which was attempted to return African slaves who had been brought to the U.S. illegally after the abolition of the slave trade in 1808.\n\nMcCulloch v. Maryland establishes a precedent that states cannot tax federal agencies. The Supreme Court unanimously rules that the Necessary and Proper Clause grants the federal government implied powers and underscores the supremacy of the federal government over those of the states. State governments had proposed taxes on the Bank of the United States in reaction against the Bank recalling loans on land purchased from the Federal government.\n\nSigns the Missouri Compromise (3 Stat 545). The Act attempted to maintain a legislative balance between the pro-slavery South and anti-slavery North by delineating which states would be free and which would not. Maine would only be granted admission into the Union if Missouri was admitted as a slaveholding state. Monroe supported the Compromise.\n\nIn a Special Message to the House, points out that under an agreement reached 04/24/1802 with the State of Georgia, there was agreement to \"extinguish . . .the Indian title to all lands within [Georgia].\" Requests funding adequate to negotiate a treaty with the Creek Indians to return property to citizens of Georgia.\n\nSigns the Tenure of Office Act (“An Act to limit the term of office of certain officers. . . “ 3 Stat 582) limiting the term in office of many appointees to four years, unless they were reappointed.\n\nSigns \"an Act for the relief of the purchaser of public lands. . . \" (3 Stat 612) permitted land purchasers to relinquish rights to a part of the land purchased with all payments on that relinquished land applied to any debts on other lands the purchaser retains. Interest on the relinquished land will be discharged. (See entry above 01/1819, Panic of 1819)\n\nVetoes Cumberland Road Appropriation Bill, which would have provided for yearly improvements to the highway with federal funding, as he believed it was unconstitutional for the federal government to become involved in projects that warranted attention by state governments. This was Monroe’s first and only presidential veto.\n\nSeventh Annual Message to Congress articulates the “Monroe Doctrine.” States that the United States would recognize existing colonies in the Western Hemisphere, close the Western Hemisphere to future colonization, would not interfere in the internal affairs of or wars between European powers, and would interpret any attempt by a European power to control any nation in the Western Hemisphere as a hostile act against the United States. The Monroe Doctrine was met with a positive reception in Congress.\n\nIn a Special Message to Congress, addresses the fact that the US have not yet \"at their own expense extinguish for the use of Georgia the Indian title to all the lands within the State. . . \" This is not for lack of trying, and should not be done by force. \"An attempt to remove them by force would, in my opinion, be unjust.\" The best outcome would be for the tribes \"to remove beyond the limits of our present States and Territories.\"\n\nSigns into law the Tariff of 1824 (4 Stat 25), which supported local manufactures and goods by raising protective tariff rates for such products as glass, lead, iron, and wool. Meant to protect American manufacturing, instead of cheaper British commodities. Gave a source of revenue for the federal government as well as support from northeastern manufacturing states.\n\nEighth Annual Message to Congress. \"It is a cause of serious regret that no arrangement has yet been finally concluded between [the United States and Great Britain] to secure by joint cooperation the suppression of the slave trade.\" Recommends enlarging the Corps of Engineers in the interest of surveying routes for roads and canals. Recommends making \"a provision\" for General Lafayette in light of his \"important services, losses and sacrifices.\" Recommends exempting justices of the Supreme Court from circuit court duties. Discusses the interests of the United States on the Pacific Ocean and on the western coast of the continent.\n\nProclaims the Russo-American Treaty of 1824 (also called the Convention of 1824) which had been signed in St. Petersburg 04/17/1824. The treaty consolidates US claims to the Oregon territory and provides for undisturbed ocean access by US citizens and subjects. (The treaty text can be found in the Statutes at Large vol. 8, p. 302.)\n\nIn a Special Message to Congress recommends \"removal of the Indian tribes from the lands which they now occupy. . . to the country lying westward and northward thereof, within our acknowledged boundaries. . . Experience has clearly demonstrated that, in their present state, it is impossible to incorporate them in such masses, in any form whatever, into our system . . . Their degradation and extermination will be inevitable.”\n\nIn Special Message to the Senate, submits a treaty with the Creek Indians (concluded on 02/12/1825) in which they agreed to surrender their remaining lands. This was later ratified by the Senate on 03/07/1825. The treaty was subsequently recognized as fraudulent and replaced in 1826 by the Treaty of Washington.\n\nSigns an Act ( 4 Stat 101) confirming the incorporation of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company, and authorizing the company to extend the canal into the District of Columbia, subject to an investigation to be ordered by the President."
