        "text": "James Monroe Gregory was born to free per­sons of color. After his mother married Henry L. Gregory (c. 1819-1895), the family moved to Cleveland, Ohio. Among his secondary-school teachers was Laura Spelman (1839-1915), the future wife of John D. Rocke­feller (1839-1937). At the college preparatory department at Oberlin College in 1865, he was the only black student in his class. His Latin professor Giles W. Shurtleff (1831-1904), once Lieutenant Colonel of the 5th Regiment of the U.S. Colored Troops, was one of those who recommended him for appointment to West Point, but President Andrew Johnson refused approval. At one point, Gregory met General O. O. Howard (1830-1909) while Gregory was passing through Washington, DC. Several months later, General Howard sent him a letter inviting him to matriculate at the newly founded (1867) How­ard University. Gregory graduated as valedictorian in a class of three and began his career in the college preparatory department. In the next year, he married one of his former students, Fannie Emma Hagan (1856-1928), with whom he had four children. In 1876, he was promoted to full professor and served as dean for two years. Throughout the 1880s he was a leading proponent of civil rights activity in the Washington, DC, area, particularly the integration of public schools. In 1885, William Sanders Scarborough (1852-1926) hoped to become Gregory’s colleague after Wiley Lane (1852-1885), the first African American professor of Greek at Howard, died unex­pectedly, but the White administration under President William Weston Patton (1821-89) thought otherwise and chose a white man. An uproar ensued (see Grimké).\n\nGregory’s name is listed in the Proceedings of the APA for the year 1881 as one of the members elected that year, but for some reason, his name is not included with the bona fide members until 1883 (TAPA 12 (1881): 15 and TAPA 14 (1883): iv; xxxiv). In 1890, he founded the American Association of Educators of Colored Youth. In 1893, Gregory published one of the first biographies of Frederick Douglass, whom he had met as a child. Scarborough wrote the book’s introduction. In 1895 the same year that he became principal of the Manual and Industrial Training School in New Jersey he rejoined the APA (TAPA 27 (1896): iii). His son, T. Montgomery Gregory (1887-1971), a member of Harvard’s class of 1910, taught at Howard University from 1912 to 1924 and became a leading figure in the National Negro Theater Movement. Gregory is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts."
