        "text": "Transcript\n\nNARRATOR: James Monroe—the fifth president of the United States—helped negotiate the Louisiana Purchase and establish the Monroe Doctrine, an influential foreign policy.\n\nMonroe became involved in the independence movement as a teenager in Williamsburg, Virginia. He helped raid British arsenals to gain supplies for the local militia while enrolled at the College of William and Mary. He left school in 1776, at the age of 18, to fight in the American Revolution.\n\nIn December of that year, the Continental Army crossed the icy Delaware River before the Battle of Trenton. A famous painting of the crossing shows a young Monroe sitting behind George Washington, holding the American flag. Monroe did participate in the crossing, but he was probably not in the same boat as Washington. During the battle, he suffered a near-fatal shoulder wound. Monroe recovered and continued to fight through 1777 and 1778, spending the winter in between at Washington's Valley Forge camp.\n\nAt the end of 1778 he resigned from the army and returned to Williamsburg. There he studied law under Thomas Jefferson and became involved in building the new American nation.\n\nIn 1803 Jefferson—then president—sent Monroe to France to help negotiate the purchase of the port city of New Orleans. France instead offered the entire Louisiana Territory for only about three cents an acre. The Louisiana Purchase doubled the size of the United States.\n\nIn 1811 President James Madison named Monroe secretary of state. During the last months of the War of 1812, he also served as secretary of war.\n\nMonroe ran for the presidency in 1816 and won over 80 percent of the electoral vote. He was reelected four years later with no one running against him. Monroe's presidency has been described as the \"Era of Good Feeling\" because of the lack of political conflict and the growing sense of national unity.\n\nDuring his second term, Monroe introduced a policy that has become known as the Monroe Doctrine. He announced that European nations should stay out of the affairs of North and South America. If a European nation tried to form a new colony or used armed force on the Americas, it would be considered a hostile act against the United States. The Monroe Doctrine influenced the foreign policy of many presidents who followed, Theodore Roosevelt in particular.\n\nMonroe's legacy also can be found on the African continent. The capital city of Liberia was named Monrovia in honor of the president's work with the American Colonization Society. The society helped settle Liberia as a home for freed American slaves.\n\nThe name that Monroe seemed to value most, however, was Colonel. Even as president, he preferred to be called Colonel Monroe in honor of his service in the American Revolution."
