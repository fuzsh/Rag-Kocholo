Soon after joining the Continental Army at 18 (cutting short his studies at the College of William and Mary), he took part in, and was wounded during the pivotal Battle of Trenton. Having met Thomas Jefferson whilst in the army, after the war Monroe studied law under his tutelage, forging a close relationship with him and through him, with James Madison as well. Monroe embarked on a long and eventful political career that saw him become the governor of Virginia and then dispatched in a diplomatic capacity to France and Great Britain. He helped negotiate the crucial Louisiana Purchase and a few eventually unratified treaties with Britain. Prior to becoming president, Monroe also served as Secretary of State under old friend James Madison. He held this critical office governing foreign policy jointly with that of the Secretary of War during the War of 1812 against Great Britain and her allies. Taking office during a time dubbed the “Era of Good Feelings” due to burgeoning nationalist pride following the war, Madison oversaw a period when internal divides over the question of slavery began to occupy much public debate fueled by increased expansion to the West. The expansion also led to the US’ first financial crisis, the Panic of 1817. Tensions with European states too were at a high resulting in the Spanish surrender of the territory of Florida and the declaration of the Monroe Doctrine.\n\nPresidential Election Results: YearElectoral Votes1816James Monroe183Rufus King34(Votes Not Cast)41820James Monroe231 John Q.

As governor of Virginia, he struggled between treating those who planned a slave insurrection (called Gabriel’s rebellion) with mercy or severity. Over his years as diplomat, and throughout his presidency, James Monroe supported the idea of colonization (transporting enslaved African-Americans to colonies in Africa) and a solution to the issue. In fact, the capital of Liberia, a country resulting from such colonization, was named Monrovia after him. However, he presided over multiple enslaved households (including the White House) throughout his life, having been born into a wealthy slave-owning family, and being dependent on their labor on his farm properties. The only record of him having freed a slave is his deathbed wish that his manservant named Peter Marks be freed and then employed.\n\nWhat is the Monroe Doctrine?\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine is a principle of foreign policy formulated by James Monroe with his Secretary of State John Adams Quincy in 1823. It articulates US intention to stay out of Europe’s internal political matters, and it calls upon the European powers to not attempt further colonization in the Western hemisphere. The principle was not immediately referred to as the Monroe Doctrine. The name was given about 30 years later, during the presidency of James Polk, and has been an important element of the US’ foreign policy since then.\n\nWhat role did James Monroe play during the War of 1812?\n\nJames Monroe was the Secretary of State when the War of 1812 was declared (which he supported). Two years later he was also made the War Secretary, and served both roles simultaneously. Under his instruction, John Adams Quincy travelled to Ghent to negotiate the end of the war. James Monroe’s leadership during the war helped him win the election in 1816.\n\nWhat is the Missouri Compromise?\n\nThe Missouri Compromise is the bill that admitted the states of Missouri and Maine to the Union, the first as a slave state, and the second as a free state. It also prohibited slavery in all other states above the 36 degrees 30 minutes latitude (roughly the southern border of Missouri).\n\nRelated Resources:\n\nEssay on the Monroe Doctrine\n\nJames Monroe: The Era of Good Feelings\n\nThe Conquest of Florida Essay\n\nThe Tenuous Black-Indian Alliance In Florida During The 1820s\n\nJames Monroe Short Biography\n\nPrevious President: James Madison | Next President: John Quincy Adams\n\n©1996-2008.
