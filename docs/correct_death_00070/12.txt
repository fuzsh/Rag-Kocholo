About Rotogravure:

Rotogravure is a printing method using a rotary press with intaglio cylinders which allows for very high quality halftone reproductions to be printed at high speed on inexpensive paper stock. Newspapers, beginning with The New York Times, were able to make effective use of this technology, and many published regular rotogravure pictorial sections in their publications during the early 20th century.
