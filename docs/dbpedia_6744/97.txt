Hi, I applied to both the Brooks school and Andover along with others but ultimately chose Andover. Although it is likely that many would choose Andover over other boarding schools, one may find Brooks to be a more personal fit. In the end, it’s all up to the individual. To compare the two:

Andover - Located in northeastern part of MA with easy access to Boston. Non-denominational with no dress code. No Saturday classes. Large enrollment. Small class sizes. Has reputation as the most rigorous/prestigious high school.

Brooks - Also located in the same part of MA with the same access. Episcopal influence with formal dress code. Small enrollment. Small class sizes.

One could want the religious influence in a school or a small school environment such as Brooks. I chose Andover over Brooks because I wanted to be in a big school where I can make a lot of friends and still have small class sizes.

Could be as simple as getting a lot better financial offer from Brooks, or simply wanting a smaller school. Andover is big and competitive, you can easily lost there if it is not a good match. We know as many kids who loved it as the ones who did not. There is no one size that fits all, and it is often foolish to choose a school based on prestige alone.

So many people turn down Andover and Exeter and Choate and so many others. After all, many of these candidates are highly desirable and get multiple offers but can only attend one school. Also, kids and parents who are wise will chose the best fit over the perceived “best” school based on name alone.

I was recently at a BS athletic event and one school stood out and not in a good way. It was a name school and I was sincerely glad my kid said No to them last year. Their lack of sportsmanship spoke volumes about their school culture.
