Head of School Josh Wolman meets with each family to establish a path for exploring all options. The school works hand in hand with students and parents throughout the process of researching, visiting, applying, and deciding about a high school choice.\n\nCountry Day has a strong track record in placement. Over the years, we have built relationships with the representatives of boarding and day schools nationwide, and an annual Boarding School Fair held here on campus has helped many families find a great match for high school."
