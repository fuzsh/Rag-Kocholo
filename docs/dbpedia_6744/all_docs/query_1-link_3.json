        "text": "Each year, the Brooks faculty produces a master list of course proposals for Winter Term. The course concepts are the result of faculty brainstorming that’s focused on three different kinds of classes: experiential, topical and approach-based. Teachers were asked to dream big — in other words, “Think of your dream teaching moment; given boundless time and resources, what would you really like to teach?” And then, “How can we adjust that to fit the Winter Term model?”\n\nIn the fall, students sign up for a class that interests them. Each class has its own requirements, daily expectations and meeting times, however most of the Winter Term courses place an emphasis on collaborative teaching.\n\nTo create time in the school calendar for Winter Term, final exams for first-semester courses were moved to before the holiday break in December. Second semester won’t start until February — leaving January open for a month’s worth of Winter Term courses."
