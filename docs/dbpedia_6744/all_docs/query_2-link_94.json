As a community that values each member’s sense of belonging, our goal is to foster an inclusive environment in which everyone can live, work and learn free from prejudice, discrimination and marginalization. While we recognize that racism occurs both intentionally and unintentionally and is often a result of unconscious bias, we also know that its presence hinders our ability to provide the most meaningful educational experience our students will have in their lives. Therefore, at Brooks School we are united in the fight to identify, acknowledge and dismantle systems of oppression and inequality. In order to do this work effectively, we will draw on our foundation: strong community, core values, and commitment to care, support and growth of every member of the community.\n\nEEO Statement\n\nBrooks School does not discriminate on the basis of race, gender, color, sexual orientation, disability or religion in the administration of its educational policies, admission policies, employment policies, financial aid and loan programs, athletic programs and other school administered programs and activities.\n\nCovid-19 Vaccination Policy\n\nBrooks School is a COVID-19 vaccinated community.
