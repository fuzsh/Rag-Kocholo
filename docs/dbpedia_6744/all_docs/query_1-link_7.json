        "text": "Brooks students come from across the country and around the world. Brooks is a place that embraces and values all types of diversity. We seek students who bring a unique perspective to our community.\n\nIn order to make sure your application is complete before the January 15 deadline, we recommend you plan ahead to meet all of the application requirements. Candidates for whom English is a second language are required to take one of the following three tests: TOEFL (our school code for the TOEFL is 4442), IELTS or DuoLingo. The SSAT is not required for students applying for admission for the 2022-2023 academic year. An in-person or Zoom interview should be completed by February 1. Students applying from Mainland China can find additional information HERE.\n\nIf you do not believe that you can afford to pay the cost of a Brooks education, the answer is yes. If you do not qualify, we may call and ask if you want to be considered for admission without aid.\n\nThose interested in applying for financial aid should notify the admission office by checking the appropriate box on the inquiry form and on the application. The Clarity Application for financial aid should be submitted by January 15 for new families and by December 31 for returning families. Decision on financial aid awards accompany acceptances and enrollment contracts.\n\nBoth parents are expected to contribute to their childâ€™s education. Financial aid is based on ability to pay, not willingness to pay. Therefore, both parents must participate in the financial aid process. Both must complete the Clarity Application. If there are extenuating circumstances that warrant waving this requirement, a written request should be sent to the director of financial aid.\n\nSending your child to Brooks is a choice. While we do not want parents to experience economic hardship as a result of their child's enrollment, we do expect sacrifices to be made in order to maximize a contribution. For example, we assume that both able-bodied parents will work, unless they have a child at home not yet school age. Otherwise, Brooks may impute an income.\n\nBrooks assigns awards based on demonstrated need as determined by the Clarity Application. Once we determine that need exists, we look for students who will add to our community in significant ways. Families of returning students who were not previously receiving financial aid may apply if their financial situation changes significantly. Those families should contact the director of financial aid as soon as possible. We prioritize our financial aid in the following order: returning students already receiving financial aid, new students, returning students not previously receiving financial aid. We will try to help Brooks families in need, but cannot make guarantees.\n\nYou must apply annually for financial aid by December 31. All things being equal, the award will be comparable each year. The award is likely to be adjusted if your income changes significantly. You can expect that the cost of attending Brooks will go up every year. Depending on your income, you will be responsible for some portion of that increase.\n\nYes. Write a letter to the director of financial aid explaining your situation in as much detail as possible. We are willing to consider requests for adjustments; however, we do have limited funds and want to be fair to all of our qualified applicants."
