        "text": "The BLDD/Brook Joint Venture is the Architect of Record for Performing Arts and Athletic Center additions.\n\nThe joint venture delegated the design of the Athletic Center to Brook Architecture. The $18 Million, 50,000 SF facility houses a competition-size pool, gymnasium, fitness center, locker rooms, and offices. Brook also converted music spaces into science lab classrooms and the library space into language laboratory classrooms.\n\nThe Athletic Center is certified LEED Silver, incorporating a green roof, recycling center and alternative transportation elements. The swimming pool received Innovation In Design credit through the use of a UV disinfection unit that significantly reduces the amount of chlorine needed along with a regenerative media filter that saves more than 600,000 gallons of water per year."
