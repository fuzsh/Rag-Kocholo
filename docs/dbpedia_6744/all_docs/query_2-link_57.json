        "text": "In August of 2016, we opened Brooke High School with a founding class of 9th grade students in a temporary space in Dorchester. Two years later, Brooke High has moved to its new and permanent location. Within our new, state of the art 90,000 square-foot facility, the high school is adjacent to our Brooke Mattapan campus.\n\nWe are now fulfilling our long-term vision to usher Brooke students to the doorstep of college and through to college graduation. Brooke High School currently serves over 440 students in grades nine through twelve.\n\nBy continuing to focus on great teaching – guaranteeing that each student is challenged and known by her or his teachers — Brooke High School will provide students an exceptional secondary education.\n\nAt full enrollment, Brooke High School will serve 600 students from Boston and Chelsea in grades 9-12. Students from all three Brooke campuses – Brooke Roslindale, Brooke Mattapan, and Brooke East Boston — will be guaranteed a seat at Brooke High School.\n\nAt Brooke High, we have the incredible honor of providing our students with the education they deserve – one that recognizes their absolute potential, that challenges them with rigor, that surrounds them with support, and that prepares them to succeed in college and have a choice-filled future. Through our college-preparatory classes, our strong and varied clubs and sports, and our student leadership opportunities, Brooke High encourages students to find their passions and strives to develop the future leaders our country needs.\n\nKimberly Steadman Network Co-Director"
