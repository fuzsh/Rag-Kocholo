        "text": "The time I spent at Brooks were the worst years of my life. Teachers and students were wildly abusive. I had pictures taken of me when I got out of the dorm shower, coaches criticizing me on my food choices in front of my friends. Students were fighting, cheating, stealing, and doing drugs in front of the teachers and facing no repercussions. The loudest, most sensitive students were able to easily manipulate every teacher. Teachers would talk about individuals grades in front of the whole class, but getting a bad grade is hard as the average Grade at Brooks is an A-, grade inflation makes college admissions impossible.\n\nBrooks has an entitled student body made out of harsh cliques that will always be talking about every other student. I know multiple students whose parents bought them their spot in college; the ones that couldn’t went to SMU. Brooks was an awful place that I would never send my own kids to, unless they wanted to experience a cold, dog eat dog environment.\n\nI believe that one of Brooks' best aspects is the amount of educational and extracurricular opportunities available. Classes are very important, but the variety of extracurriculars that the school offers supplement students' learning. Many affinity groups, clubs, and extracurricular activities ensure that every student feels invited to try something new and be involved in the community. For example, during my freshman year at Brooks, I joined the rowing team, which allowed me to learn an unfamiliar sport and meet new people.\n\nBrooks has a very strong community on campus, however it is difficult to attend the school as a day student when the majority of students live on campus. Because most students are always on campus during the week and live in dormitories, many day students on campus such as myself often have to stay on campus until nighttime to attend events that are scheduled during the late evening.\n\nBrooks School has certainly lived up to it's motto for myself, of being the most meaningful educational experience you will receive. Besides the strong and challenging academics, my favorite part of the school is the community that is built within the school. To me the whole school feels like a big family of people who are motivated and passionate about they're interests. Although Brooks has been amazing, there are definitely a few cons with a private school that has a dress code and classes on Saturdays. Brooks has made for a busy but enjoyable high school experience and I'm glad I was able to be given the opportunity to attend the school.\n\nWent to Brooks for all 4 years and had an absolutely amazing time there. My teachers were all very good and made the effort to get to know me and help me when I needed it. The campus is beautiful, and the friends you make will literally last you a lifetime. So glad I was able to attend.\n\nThis is my daughter's first year at Brooks and she loves it. The Brooks School is a home away from home. A great community filled with kids, teachers, advisors, coaches that want to be there and want the very best for each other. My daughter has been so well supported that I am beyond thankful that she gets to attend this school for the next three years.\n\ni absolutely love this school. i came from a tiny town where i only went to school with the same kids all 14 years. i had never even known what brooks was or that boarding/day school was a thing. i applied to apply and decided to take the gamble and go. it was scary starting completely over but i needed that fresh start. the teachers are so caring and its common to have a good relationship with them. the sports are non-stressful and allow people to perform at there own level. the social setting is sometimes overwhelming but there is always people to hang out with and always activities set up by the school wether its laser tag or movie night. The best decision I have ever made was coming here. i have grown into a brand new person that I am proud of. sometimes it feels clicky and I will say there is definitely a hookup culture. I have met the most amazing friends who have always supported me through everything. THIS IS THE SCHOOL FOR YOU! GO BROOKS!!!\n\nAs a student at Brooks School, I've had the opportunity to make connections with such a diverse, caring group of people. More importantly, though, I've been able to grow as a person by trying new things, hearing from different perspectives, and stepping out of my comfort zones. I've learned how to manage and enjoy my own learning process. I'm extremely grateful for my high school experience.\n\nI have two Children who attend Brooks. Both are 4 year boarders.\n\nThe opportunity each of them has been given in attending Brooks as been incredible. They have been challenged in and out of the classroom. The academics are challenging, but are done in an environment that is always supportive, with a lot of encouragement to strive to be and do your best. My children have forged wonderful relationships with many of their teachers, advisors and coaches; ones that will last a lifetime. The school is very warm and welcoming, and has the feel of being \"home\".\n\nAthletics at Brooks are a great compliment to the academics. Brooks is always competitive in so many of their athletic teams.\n\nBrooks transitioned so quickly and so well to online learning during this past Spring when schools were forced to close. The transition was seamless for my children, and my children continued to be challenged during this remote learning time.\n\nI would highly recommend Brooks School.\n\nIf there was an option to give zero stars, I would do it. I had the worst experience anyone could ever imagine. Being a two sport varsity athlete, I did not feel part of the teams or even the community around the school. Seniors and upper class men wouldn’t even make eye contact with any lower class men and treat them like dirt.Mostly every kid there is entitled beyond words and attends brooks because they were denied at every other school they applied to . Turning into a completely art based school, thanks to their brand new 80 million dollar art building. If you like arts, music, soccer, squash, or basketball, this is by far the school for you. However, if you are not on one of those teams, you are treated very differently by both the students and teachers. The administration could care less about sports, and have coaches that are clueless about the game, can’t handle 15-18 year old teenagers, and struggle to recruit.\n\nFor the first 2 years, I absolutely loved it. I loved how tight knit the school was, the small classes and the structured schedule. But as I reached my Junior year, I started feeling like this school was too small for me. For a person that is looking for a community, Brooks can definitely provide that. Students always say hi and because most faculties also live on campus, your teachers are not just your teachers but also your coach, dorm parent and more. But if you are looking to branch out and try a bunch of new things and explore yourself, Brooks might not be the place for you. Though Brooks does try to accommodate students like that, offering independent studies and the freedom to pick and choose classes senior year, it is just not the same as some bigger schools.\n\nI loved that Brooks gave me a place to develop my own opinion and grow as a student. My teachers were amazing and supported me so much throughout my time at school. I wish that the self and community classes would change because each year felt like it had the same curriculum as the year before. I also wish that there was more of a connection between alumni and students to create many opportunities for students to pursue internships that would take over the summer. All in all, I had a very good experience, but there is always room for improvement!\n\nBrooks School was responsible for the most formative years of my life. The campus on the lake truly gave me opportunities I would not have otherwise, and for that I am grateful. The small campus and environment and the faculty made it a home away from home and a place I hold so dear in my heart. My fond memories and the people I met will stay with me forever. Thank you Brooks."
