        "text": "Welcome to the Brooks Elementary School!\n\nWe serve approximately 520 students in grades PK-5, and have about 90 highly dedicated staff members working daily with our diverse learning population. The Brooks Elementary School houses three MEEP preschool classrooms and five language-based classrooms. Along with classroom teachers, BES has specialists in physical education, music, art, Nexus,and technology. While not qualifying for Title 1, BES has two Remedial Reading teachers and one EL teacher for grades K-5.\n\nHere at the Brooks, we are committed to nurturing collaboration, imagination, and creative problem-solving. As a Responsive Classroom model school, we strive to establish and maintain an environment that supports the whole child, challenges prejudice, respects differences, and fosters a deep concern for others. The Brooks educators, staff, volunteers, parents/guardians, and students work together to provide all students and staff with a safe place to learn while allowing them to be curious and take intellectual risks to achieve high academic standards and grow to their full potential. Every member of the community pledges to “Be Kind, Be Safe, and Be Responsible’. These Brooks bees encompass all that we prioritize in our daily interactions with each other.\n\nResponsive Classroom, Michigan Model, and Zones of Regulation drive the daily routines and expectations at the Brooks School. As I previously mentioned, we focus on educating the whole child, and these programs ensure consistent language and modeling throughout the school. The staff is committed to the Responsive Classroom model. Some aspects that are implemented with fidelity include modeling expected behaviors, using logical consequences, including students in creating class rules and expectations, and creating a safe learning environment where all are welcomed and respected.\n\nWe value both frequent and open communication between home and school. Please be sure to keep your contact information up to date with the school and district so that you will receive our weekly updates and newsletters. In between communications, please feel free to contact me at any time with questions, comments, or concerns at sdemos@medford.k12.ma.us. I can also be reached via phone at 781-393-2166.\n\nOn a personal note, I am a proud mother of two beautiful daughters in their first years of college. My husband and I are now officially “empty nesters.” When I am not spending time with my family or working, I am the vice-chair of my hometown’s School Committee. My educational journey began as a special education paraprofessional in Medford 28 years ago. After spending four years in this position, I was hired as a teacher in Tewksbury Public Schools, where I spent 19 years before returning to Medford 5 years ago. I was honored to be the Assistant Principal here for three years before being hired as the principal in 2020.\n\nPlease know that I truly believe that collaboration between home and school is the key to a successful year for all students since Together Everyone Achieves More. I look forward to working with all of you this school year."
