        "text": "OUR LOCATION:\n\nBrooks School is a private Christian School located 4 miles from Eldoret town off Eldoret-Malaba road formerly Uganda Road. It is about 205 miles from the capital Nairobi to the western part of Kenya.\n\n(View using Google Map)\n\nBrooks School, as the name suggests, is derived from the Biblical brook in I Kings 17:6; “And ravens brought him bread and flesh in the morning, and bread and flesh in the evening; and he drank of the brook.“ Education is a continuous process in the life of an individual, and Brooks School plays a big role in making it possible. The brook in Brooks is the inexhaustible source of knowledge and an unfailing love of God to every child. Brooks School is a place for all God’s children; “And the children were brought knowledge in the morning and knowledge in the evening, and they drank of the word of God and their lives were improved”\n\nBrooks School is located 4 miles from Eldoret town off Uganda Road, in Uasin Gishu County of Rift Valley, Kenya, a relatively suburban area serene for learning. It was founded on 7th September 2007 with 5 children in kindergarten, two of whom were the founder’s children; Seth and Patience Salimo ages 4 and 2 respectively. Dr. Salimo and his wife Scovia Salimo, now missionaries in Kenya, had been career teachers for many years before they left to establish the school in order to serve the community they come from. Their passion was and is still to provide Christian quality education to the underprivileged families in the community.\n\nOur Purpose\n\nThe school is founded on strong Christian values. It is a non discriminatory institution that accommodates children of all faith. Our funding comes from middle income able parents who pay tuition directly to the school and 5 percentage of it is channeled to fund two categories of children; i) Orphan children who meets the criteria of being an “orphan” and ii) Bright children whose parents meet the criteria of “being poor” and and can pass the poverty criteria supported by evidence of such a poor household. The purpose of Brooks School is to make a difference in the lives of underprivileged households around and beyond it by providing quality education, basic needs like food, water and necessary scholastic materials. The founders, The Salimos, are looking forward to establishing an orphanage for the many orphans in the school in order to provide basic needs, shelter or a place to call home while in school and join their relatives during school vacation. Already over 80 children are being housed and funded through the “Adopt a Child” initiative. Brooks School is making an appeal to all well-wishers to partner with them and make a difference by “adopting” a child as more and more needy children are coming and it is our determination not turn any known need away. If you feel you want to be part of this “Adopt a Child” cause, you can contact the school by the email below.\n\nWe believe we do not need to have extra in order to give, but to give what there is to those who are less privileged in society, which is the mind of Christ. Christ warns us in James 2:16, not to say, “Go in peace; keep warm and well fed,” but does nothing about their physical needs, what good is it? We got to do something!\n\nCONTACTS.\n\nBrooks School\n\nP.O. Box 3083 – 30100\n\nEldoret, KENYA.\n\nTel: +254 782142617\n\nEmail:brooksschool07@gmail.com\n\nFounder: wfredsalimo@gmail.com"
