The single-course structure of Winter Term allows students and faculty to work together even more closely than they do in regular classes.\n\nThe Students on the Forefront of Science Program is an initiative developed by the Science Department at Brooks School. The goal of the program is to provide rising sixth-formers (between junior and senior year) with innovative experiences that will expose them to research, technology, and advanced studies in the sciences.\n\nOur Exhange Program, founded in 1986, promotes the global education of students from Brooks and its partner schools in Botswana, Hungary, Morocco, Scotland, Spain and Peru. By living abroad as residents in other school communities, our students are challenged to extend themselves to another place, another culture, another people and, most importantly, to be affected by them, to be changed by them.\n\nSomething exciting is always going on here, so please make an appointment to come visit us in person or virtually.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nHow much does Brooks School cost?\n\nBrooks School's tuition is approximately $66,900 for private students.\n\nWhat schools are Brooks School often compared to?\n\nBrooks Schoolis often viewed alongside schools like Phillips Academy Andover by visitors of our site.\n\nWhat is the acceptance rate of Brooks School?\n\nThe acceptance rate of Brooks School is 25%, which is lower than the national average of 70%.
