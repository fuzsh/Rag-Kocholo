        "text": "Testing: Brooks will be test optional for students applying for admission for the 2024-2025 academic year. All applicants can decide whether or not to submit standardized test results. Students will not be penalized for opting out of testing, nor will those who do submit scores gain an advantage. Admission decisions are based on a variety of factors, including recommendations from current teachers, transcript, extracurricular interests and achievements, and the interview.\n\nPlease note: Because we want all our students to be highly successful, all applicants for whom English is not their first language must be able to read, speak, and understand English at an advanced level of proficiency. Therefore, we require, as part of a completed application to Brooks, that all international applicants take either the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) — our school code for the TOEFL is 4442 — IELTS or Duolingo. Brooks School does not offer English as a Second Language.\n\nIn addition, students who reside in and attend school in mainland China must register and interview with our partner in China, Vericant. The deadline to complete a Vericant interview is December 1, 2024. Before a student from mainland China can schedule an interview or submit an application to Brooks, our Admission Office must first review the Vericant interview and writing sample. Once we have reviewed the Vericant interview, we will contact the student and their family to let them know if they can or they cannot move forward in the application process at Brooks."
