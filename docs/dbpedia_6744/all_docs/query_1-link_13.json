        "text": "Brooks School provides a college preparatory program for 360 students on a 270-acre campus overlooking Lake Cochichewick in North Andover, MA. Small classes allow students to work closely with teachers, fostering a relationship that is at the core of the warm, close-knit community. With a challenging academic curriculum that includes advanced placement courses, Brooks also has three signature programs that build on the school’s mission statement “to provide the most meaningful educational experience of our students’ lives.” Our Exchange Program, Students on the Forefront Internships, and Winter Term all emphasize depth of experience over breadth. Extracurricular excellence is also important at Brooks. Visual and performing arts are an integral part of school life, with classes and performances taking place in the spectacular Center for the Arts. On the athletic front, numerous teams have won New England and ISL championships in recent years.\n\nUnique Characteristics\n\nWinter Term is an intense, three-week, one-topic course of study held each January. The goal of Winter Term is to put into practice the concept of “depth over breadth”. Students on the Forefront gives Brooks students a chance to spread their wings in summer internships at hospitals, labs and STEM-based organizations ranging across the arts and humanities. The exchange program provides students with the opportunity to travel and immerse themselves in schools and communities that are different from them."
