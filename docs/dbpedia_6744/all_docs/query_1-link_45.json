        "text": "With winter still in full, frigid swing, summer might seem like just a fleeting daydream. But those long days of warm weather and sunshine are just around the corner; now is the perfect time to start planning for the summer programs at Brooks School in North Andover, Massachusetts.\n\nEstablished in 1971 and located on a pastoral campus overlooking Lake Cochichewick, the Brooks School Summer Programs cater to every child’s interests with individualized itineraries and traditional camp activities.\n\nHaving welcomed children and families for the past 46 summers, this active campus remains bustling at all hours of the day. Check out a quick rundown of everything Brooks School has to offer and see for yourself why families enjoy being part of the best kept secret in New England.\n\nDay Camp\n\nThe most quintessential and traditional form of summer camp, the Brooks School Day Camp serves all youngsters ages 4 to 13, splitting campers into age-based groups. Experienced group counselors lead kids through a wide array of activities, including archery, arts and crafts, gymnastics, boating, music, sports, swimming, performing arts, and more. To top it off, each week of camp is themed with numerous special events.\n\nSummer School\n\nFor students entering grades 7-12 looking to advance academically, the Brooks Summer School offers a variety of non-graded courses, focusing on academic enrichment instead of credit. Limited to 12 students per class, the four-week, 55-minute courses range in specialized subjects: English topics like media literacy, creative writing, and literary analysis, math courses in algebra and calculus, science subjects including physics, aeronautical engineering, and biology, general college readiness classes, and SSAT test prep. At the conclusion of the session, each student receives a detailed progress report.\n\nComputer Camp\n\nThe Computer Camp at Brooks School focuses on STEM education, offering campers ages 8 to 13 the opportunity to solve problems with hands-on activities and state-of-the-art technology. Campers will be engaged through the use of LEGO robotics, computer programming, multimedia communication, engineering design challenges, and STEM design briefs, while still enjoying a traditional camp experience with outdoor activities like swimming, tennis, and games.\n\nLeaders-In-Training\n\nGeared towards teenagers entering grade 8 and older, the Leaders-in-Training program helps participants develop and hone their leadership skills, build confidence, and show responsibility as a role model. Working amongst themselves and with other groups of campers, LITs focus on effective positive behavior management strategies and ways to communicate with younger children. After successfully completing the three-year training program, LITs, who are at least 16 years old, can apply for a staff position.\n\nSoccer Camp\n\nBrooks School has hosted the prestigious Nike Vogelsinger Soccer Academy for more than 35 years. International coaching staff lead three unique camps – the Vogelsinger Soccer Academy, Junior Camps, and Vogelsinger All-Star School. Based on age and skill level, each camp helps aspiring soccer stars work on their individual game and how to be a team player. Competitive campers will strive to reach their highest potential under the guidance of experienced athletes. Overnight options are available.\n\nExtended day and transportation\n\nThe extended day program is available from 7 a.m. – 6 p.m. and is the perfect option to accommodate working parents and busy schedules. Campers are supervised and participate in various activities from swimming and sports to arts and crafts and games.\n\nBrooks School Summer Programs offers convenient one-way and round-trip transportation throughout the Merrimack Valley and North Shore. This service provides families with a reliable option when making travel plans.\n\nWhether you choose to spend one or all eight weeks with Brooks School Summer Programs, children ages 4–18 create memories and partake in life-changing experiences. Now that the secret is out, be part of this 47-year tradition. Your summer begins at Brooks."
