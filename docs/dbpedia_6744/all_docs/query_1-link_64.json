        "text": "Riverview School is a community that values and celebrates diversity as essential to the experience of our students, staff and community. We embrace and respect differences, including but not limited to: race, socioeconomic status, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age, cultural heritage, educational background, and of course learning styles. As a community that aspires to reflect and prepare our students for the increasingly diverse world, Riverview supports and nurtures the whole child and their full identity.\n\nRiverview School values each student as an individual and acknowledges the importance of students having a voice in the development of their goals, program, and instruction. Families likewise play a crucial role, particularly in supporting students who need assistance in expressing their needs, desires, and preferences. Consistent with Riverview’s mission and whole person philosophy, the School is committed to offering interventions and identifying strengths that empower students to increase their skills in the core competencies of education, social /emotional, independent living, wellness, and vocational readiness. The overall goal is for the Riverview’s graduates to possess the skills that will offer the highest degree of access to a fulfilling life. Riverview strives to individualize programming, to be sensitive to student and family wishes when possible, and to offer reasonable accommodations that coincide with its overall approach, philosophy, and program. Riverview also recognizes its role in promoting acceptance and building awareness of the valuable contributions people with unique needs can make to the greater community."
