Don’t limit yourself to the top schools, look at some schools you wouldn’t have thought of visiting. You may be surprised at what you find!</p>\n\n<p>Is anyone else applying to Brooks / thinking of applying to Brooks? Does anyone attend / did attend? </p>\n\n<p>Post any info about Brooks here.</p>\n\n<p>Hi I am a recent graduate of Brooks. I truly enjoyed my time there and believe it is a amazing place. Although having only graduated in May, I feel comfortable saying that Brooks greatly prepared me for college. The school has an incredible faculty to name a few Mr. Alami, Mrs. Hodgeson, Mr. Hoffman, and Dusty Richards. I would like to respond to a few things in this thread. Athletics are a part of any ISL school at Brooks for your first two years you are required to participate in some kind of athletic activity for two semesters as an afternoon activity. For example my freshman year I played field hockey in the fall and rowed in the spring. Brooks has three level of teams for all sports except crew they are varsity, junior varsity, and thirds. If you have never played the sport before you will likely be placed on thirds a very relaxed way to learn the sport and be a part of team that is at the same skill level as you are. A second note on athletics Brooks is sometimes dubbed a “sports school” I believe this happens because Brooks does have pretty impressive athletic legacy at the varsity level. However, Brooks has also many opportunities to participate in the arts. There are at least four singing groups on campus, there is an improv group, plays every semester, photography classes, theater classes, drawing classes, painting classes, and pottery classes. Also the program directors are very supportive of any independent projects that a student wishes to pursue. An example of this is one of my good friend’s designed a fashion line and put on a fashion show in the squash center. Also Brooks has an incredible community service I participated in it all fours years and was the head of the community service board my senior year. Any prospective student looking to explore community service work, Brooks is a great place to do this at. Students are encouraged to got outside there comfort zone whether that be trying a new sport, taking an art class, or trying out for a play like I did my senior year. Brooks is an incredible place and I would agree that its underrated. We turn out great students who go on to incredible colleges and universities and who are well prepared for life. As the motto says: “Victuri Te Salutamus” (we greet, we about to live).</p>"
