        "text": "Reflections and Advice:\n\n1.) What do you think makes your school unique relative to other boarding schools?\n\n70/30 Boarding:Day student ratio gives the campus a unique feel. The school never feels \"empty\" and day students really feels a sense of community despite not living on campus. The dress code has relaxed since i've been there (coat and tie), but it took a lot of adjusting coming from a public school. It can feel a bit intimidating coming in as a freshman. Luckily, Brooks has a great mix of kids for being such a small school.\n\n2.) What was the best thing that happened to you in boarding school?\n\nAlthough no one admits it, the obvious end goal of any boarding school experience is to prepare you for a successful college career. And yes, Brooks did that for me. However, the only thing from Brooks that still resonates with me today are the relationships I developed there. Some of my best friends are kids I went to Brooks with. Those friends and the teachers who I saw on a daily basis were the people who helped mold me. So those who are in Brooks (or boarding school in general), don't get bogged down by the details (the new dorm, athletic fields, facilities, college statistics). All great things, sure, but look at the community of people who make up the school. Look at the relationships. That's what you're paying for, really. That's what will make a kid thrive. And that's while they'll remember.\n\n3.) What might you have done differently during your boarding school experience?\n\nI wouldn't have done anything different in my boarding school experience. My first two years at Brooks I was pretty obsessed about doing well in school and sort of burned myself out. My junior year, I started to take a step back, look at the bigger picture, and really engage with the people around me. Sure, my GPA fell a bit, but learned more in those two years than I ever had before. For kids going to boarding school, I can't emphasize enough how important it is to develop relationships with everyone around you. After four years, these will be some of the strongest friendships you will ever have. Other than that, stick to your passions. Just because you're at boarding school doesn't mean you have to give up on things that interest you. Pursue those passions 100% and share them with those around you.\n\n4.) What did you like most about your school?\n\nThe community. I don't remember most of my classes, my grades, the scores of my games. I remember the people, the friendships, and taking comfort in knowing they would always be there for me.\n\n5.) Do you have any final words of wisdom for visiting or incoming students to your school?\n\nDon't take yourself too seriously. Be respectful. Be humble. Be curious. Engage in things and people that make you excited to wake up in the morning.\n\nAcademics:\n\n1.) Describe the academics at your school - what did you like most about it?\n\nSmall class sizes were a huge draw. It forces even the most shy students to develop a relationship with their peers and teachers. For high school-aged kids, the ability to seek guidance and advice from a teacher outside the classroom is invaluable. The small student body and campus size at Brooks means you see your teachers pretty much every day whether it be in the classroom, dorms, at meals etc. They are always around and always there to help. This is a little intimidating at first, but you'll find it's one of the most special aspects of Brooks. That said, the academics are no joke. Course loads can vary depending on how many Honors/AP classes kids take, but either way, there's always a few hours of homework in the mix every day. Combine this with the fact that you have to participate in an after-school activity, and you quickly realize how crucial time management is (especially with class on Saturday). Although it can be overwhelming at times, the non-stop schedule at Brooks made the jump to a college schedule a breeze.\n\nAthletics:\n\n1.) Describe the athletics at your school - what did you like most about it?\n\nAgain, the most valuable part of my athletic experience at Brooks was my relationship with teammates and coaches. It was pretty cool to be sitting in a Biology class and then a few hours later having the guy teaching me the Krebs cycle running the show out on the water. I know a lot of schools will hire outside coaches for many sports, but at Brooks it's pretty much all in-house. The cool thing about Brooks is everyone makes a team. There are JV and Thirds options for pretty much every sport so if someone is keen to try something new, they can. That said, many of the varsity programs (hockey, field hockey, soccer to name a few) are among the best in the ISL. Brooks has also become more supportive of individual athletic pursuits. Although I competed as a varsity rower in the spring, my true passion has always been surfing. As a sponsored competitive surfer, I was granted an independent study for the fall months and surfed every day after school. I admit, it took quite a bit of convincing to make that happen, but ultimately Brooks ended up supporting my passion.\n\nDorm Life:\n\n1.) Describe the dorm life in your school - what did you like most about it?\n\nI was a day student but spent a fair bit of time in the dorms with friends. Again, the sense of community is huge here. With a school the size of Brooks the dorms also emphasize that small community feel. There's always a lot of life and energy. I found they were great places for younger students to get to know the older kids. For someone who's shy, it's easy to stick to your own group of friends in your own grade. The dorms mixed all ages together which made those relationships more natural. Older students certainly get the best choice as far as room selection is concerned. Most dorms are either single or double rooms but the size/layout of those rooms vary a great deal dorm to dorm. Each dorm has its draw (proximity to the dining hall/school building/athletic center, room size, etc) It's all personal preference, really. Blake House was the best when I was there."
