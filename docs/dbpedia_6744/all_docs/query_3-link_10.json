This event hosted family members to listen and learn about what their students have been working on at School, including a recorder recital and in-depth explanations of multiple indigenous peoples.\n\nIt was a packed weekend on the Nashoba Brooks campus for Fall Weekend!\n\nThank you to all the parent volunteers, student ambassadors, faculty members, and all other roles who contributed to making this weekend so memorable for our School."
