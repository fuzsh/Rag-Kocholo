The teachers and staff are amazing. The school is the perfect starting place for our daughter. Everyone knows all the kids names. They treat all the parents and kids so well. They have amazing events for the kids and the families and the extra curricular activities they offer are awesome. My daughter never wants to leave each day! So glad we found Oak Brook.\n\nMariana Lenox\n\nParent\n\n5 star rating\n\n5 star rating\n\n5 star rating\n\n5 star rating\n\n5 star rating\n\nI recently moved from Detroit and was worried about my 2.5 and 4.5 yr old daughters adjusting to both parents working. OBS has been a lifesaver. The transition was made easy because when the girls first get dropped off they stay together till it’s time to break apart. This decreased the anxiety of both girls. They both love going to school and it’s more of a struggle to get them to want to go home. As a parent I couldn’t ask for more caring staff and teachers. Would recommend OBS to everyone\n\nDaisy Dominguez Mills\n\nParent\n\n5 star rating\n\n5 star rating\n\n5 star rating\n\n5 star rating\n\n5 star rating\n\nSo thankful for the teachers and staff at this school! My daughter is learning so much! The environment is friendly which I love, and the teachers are always keeping me up to date with how my baby is doing! Hands up, best school ever, it’s nerve wrecking being a first time mommy, but so far, Oak Brook is making this a much smoother experience!\n\nLovina Lopez\n\nParent\n\nCome Be A Part of the Oak Brook School Family.
