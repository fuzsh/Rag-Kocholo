        "text": "We believe that weekends exist to allow for a balance of time for fun and time to relax. Students can find that through joining a 3 v. 3 basketball game, going out to a dance, heading off campus for an activity or spending time with friends in the dorm. Brooks' Community Activities Board (CAB) works with students to provide an active social calendar that offers everyone in our diverse student body with a range of fun things to do on Saturdays and Sundays.\n\nThe Community Activities Board\n\nStudents are the driving force behind the activities offered by the CAB (and facilitated by the student affairs office). The group proposes plans, gets input from fellow students and helps rally support for all the events on campus.\n\nEach week a lineup of the weekend events is emailed to students and displayed in the academic building on TV screens.\n\nOf course, informal activities for students to enjoy with teachers and dorm families are always on the agenda. Brooks often hosts faculty versus student trivia nights and basketball games.\n\nAnd most weekends include the opportunity to just relax in an \"open house\" at one of the resident faculty homes, during which students typically bake cookies or brownies and play board games for a cozy night in."
