        "text": "Your child may need to learn braille if they:\n\nhave little or no vision\n\nprefer to learn through touch\n\ncan’t see well enough to use large print books\n\nBraille is a tactile code which enables blind and vision impaired people to read. It uses the alphabet and numbers but your child reads with their fingers. It’s based on 6 raised dots in 2 columns of 3.\n\nYou can support your child to prepare to learn braille by:\n\ndeveloping fingertip sensitivity, for example playing with lots of different textures\n\nbuilding strong fingers, for example popping bubble wrap, squeezing Playdough\n\ndeveloping independent finger movement, for example playing with a keyboard\n\nYou can help your child learn braille by labelling things around your house in braille with a braille label maker.\n\nFind out more about braille:\n\nAsk your child’s QTVI. They will support you and your child to learn braille. Once your child is at nursery and school, the QTVI will give advice on what the school needs to provide. This advice is free to parents.\n\nAs advised by the local QTVI, your older child may also benefit from learning to touch type.\n\nLearn braille yourself\n\nYou may decide that you want to learn braille yourself as another way to communicate with your child.\n\nIt also means you can help them learn to read and write braille.\n\nYour child’s QTVI can advise you on this.\n\nLego recently launched Braille Bricks, which can help blind or partially sighted children and their family members to learn the alphabet and numbers.\n\nBraille equipment\n\nIf your child is learning braille, you can get equipment to help. These include:\n\nplastic braille overlays for books\n\nbraille writers – like a typewriter with special keys to create braille\n\nLook at the RNIB website for more on what is available\n\nBefore buying any expensive equipment, work with your child’s QTVI to understand what they will need, and what will be provided by their school.\n\nBraille postal library service\n\nYou can borrow books from the Clearvision Project postal library which contain both the print and braille, for free, so you can read with them and support them to learn!\n\nRSBC’s Family Support Service can help you with:\n\npractical advice about your child’s development\n\nsupport when you feel overwhelmed\n\nunderstanding your child’s vision impairment better\n\nliving as a family and being supportive of each other"
