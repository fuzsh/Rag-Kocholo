        "text": "Press Release\n\nJune 2014\n\nFor Immediate Release\n\nCONTACT: Frances Mary D'Andrea, Chair\n\nBraille Authority of North America\n\nPhone: 412-521-5797\n\nEmail: literacy2@mindspring.com\n\nThe Braille Authority of North America (BANA) is pleased to share a significant new publication—The ABCs of UEB—authored by Constance Risjord. This publication outlines the major differences between English Braille, American Edition (EBAE) and Unified English Braille (UEB). Although this is not a comprehensive instruction manual, it provides examples and practice exercises that allow people who already know EBAE to quickly build on their knowledge of braille to understand UEB. This is an extremely valuable resource that will help braille readers, transcribers, teachers, and families make the transition to UEB.\n\nBANA sincerely appreciates the work of Constance Risjord who volunteered to design and create this valuable project. We recognize and thank her for the contribution of her time, energy, and expertise.\n\nThe ABCs of UEB is available in PDF, BRF, and HTML formats on the BANA website at http://www.brailleauthority.org/unified-english-braille-ueb\n\nFor additional resource information, visit www.brailleauthority.org.\n\nYou can follow the work of BANA by signing up for BANA-Announce, a one-way email list that disseminates news and information. To join this list, send a blank email message to bana-announce-subscribe@brailleauthority.org and follow the directions in the confirmation email that will be sent in response. You can also follow BANA on Facebook and Twitter!\n\nThe Board of BANA consists of appointed representatives from seventeen member organizations of braille producers, transcribers, teachers, and consumers.\n\nThe mission of the Braille Authority of North America is to assure literacy for tactile readers through the standardization of braille and/or tactile graphics.\n\nThe purpose of BANA is to promote and to facilitate the uses, teaching, and production of braille. Pursuant to this purpose, BANA will promulgate rules, make interpretations, and render opinions pertaining to braille codes and guidelines for the provisions of literary and technical materials and related forms and formats of embossed materials now in existence or to be developed in the future for the use of blind persons in North America. When appropriate, BANA shall accomplish these activities in international collaboration with countries using English braille. In exercising its function and authority, BANA shall consider the effects of its decisions on other existing braille codes and guidelines, forms and formats; ease of production by various methods; and acceptability to readers."
