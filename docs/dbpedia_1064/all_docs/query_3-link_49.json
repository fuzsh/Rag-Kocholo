        "text": "Braille is often the first alternative format that springs to mind when creating accessible information. It is easier and cheaper to produce than many people expect and should form a part of any piece of accessible information.\n\nJust because many braille readers would ordinarily visit a destination with another person does not mean that the other person shares their interest in the contents of an interpretation sign or a guidebook. Providing braille materials pre-visit and during a visit enables a visually impaired visitor to gather information at their own pace, without relying on a sighted person to read everything for them.\n\nInside a building it is relatively easy to use braille effectively to assist visually impaired people to find their way around. The Sign Design Guide includes guidance for the consistent placing of braille at lifts and on doors for example. Outdoors it is a little trickier of course because the user has to find the sign before they can read it. It is possible to alert a visually impaired visitor to the presence of the sign by using a textured path surface. It is best to plan for visually impaired visitors that will be visiting as a part of a group or with family or friends. In these instances including braille on an existing sign at a point of interest will enable a visually impaired visitor to gather information at their own pace.\n\nUsing a tactile map to find your way around is a tall order but these tactile resources allow visually impaired visitors to understand a site, its scale and its general layout, even if they cannot actually make their way around."
