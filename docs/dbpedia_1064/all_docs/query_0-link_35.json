        "text": "Whatâ€™s the idea:\n\nA dot matrix printer modified at a low cost to work as a Braille printer Both the friends once visited a blind school for a school project where they saw much of the printing work done manually, which was quite time consuming. One of the teachers there asked them to see if anything could be done in this regard. They came back and did some background search and found that while Braille printers were available they were quite costly. Zeroing down on dot matrix printer, they decided to go ahead with their plans to develop a Braille printer of their own. Khushwant likes to play cricket and chess. He also enjoys surfing the net and making electronic gadgets like electronic stethoscope, water level indicators, LED displays etc. He wants to become an astronaut and undertake space exploration. Santokh likes learning new things. Mathematics and Physics are his favorite subjects. He also writes poems on various topics and things that inspire him. He also wants to become an aeronautical engineer. About the development of the Braille printer, he recalls while modifying the printer, there was a problem with the roller. There was not enough friction on the roller to catch the rubber tube so he and his friends used it as football for a while, which made its surface rough and thereafter it started giving desired results."
