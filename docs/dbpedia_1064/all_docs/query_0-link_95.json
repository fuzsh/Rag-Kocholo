        "text": "These day they put rhymes on everything\n\nRhymes on TV commercials\n\nRhymes on comedy sketches\n\nIt′s like a rhyme don't mean nothing no more\n\nI put rhymes on everything\n\nRhyme pages everywhere\n\nNothing′s off limits\n\nI rhyme about everything\n\nThey say one dimensional\n\nPay more attention though\n\nEvery line is intentional and what I wrote\n\nIt's not a gimmick to get more records sold\n\nIf that was the case I woulda quit a long time ago\n\nI'm still here\n\nShining glow whenever the father let′s me\n\nCut my hair off, cause I was looking kinda sketchy\n\nI could rhyme about fashion the clothes in my closet\n\nOr rhyme about the cash in my wallet\n\nI could write a song about the gas prices\n\nOr conspiracy theories on that healthcare crisis\n\nPolitics build the food pyramids and choose profits over people\n\nWe don′t die because we starve\n\nWe die because we eat\n\nThey say it's self inflicted\n\nSo the ones getting burned are the ones taking the heat\n\nWe get rhymes on everything\n\nMost the time it don′t mean anything\n\nSo, I don't hold back anything anymore\n\nAlways give my everything\n\nWe get rhymes on everything\n\nMost the time it don′t mean anything\n\nSo, I don't hold back anything anymore\n\nI put rhymes on everything\n\nSharpie and a notebook I′m leaving my mark\n\nHad to lock the flow making words rhyme is the easy part\n\nSpeak my peace and let my peace speak like graffiti art\n\nAnd give you a peace of my heart\n\nWhen I rip the beat up on loud\n\nI work with [?] before the power song\n\nNot it's on and my mike sounds nice\n\nBlame it on the [?]\n\nExtra effort to make it my best record\n\nYou can hear my pain and flesh\n\nIn every bar and measure\n\nI'm far from a super star\n\nNot a household name\n\nBut, I′m known for writing rhymes so I fan the flame\n\nFamily man many plans came but I′m still alive\n\nAfter the famine came\n\nAnd I still got passion\n\nNot for the spotlight\n\nBut, if the beats hot I'll write a rhyme right on the spot\n\nI′m not new to this\n\nCheck my track record I worked with [?]\n\nBefore you heard him on that plat record\n\nHaven't made a [?] yet\n\nHaven′t made a [?] record\n\nIf I start slaking it's a [?] that′s my last record\n\nAnd now I'm rocking with that optimist\n\nI know God is in control no matter how dark it gets\n\nSome of this songs on the radio are [?]\n\nThey are not my nemesis they see my own blemishes and imperfections\n\nMy heart was [?] redemption resonates\n\nJesus saves he came to set my record straight\n\nNow my payment ship is for the benefit of everybody\n\nSo, turn the beat up\n\nTill the speakers blow out\n\nThorns in my side [?]\n\nI be writing rhymes till the day that I role out\n\nUntil the day that I role out\n\nWriter(s): Winchester Bryan L<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
