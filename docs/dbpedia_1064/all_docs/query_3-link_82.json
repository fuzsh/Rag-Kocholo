Check it out!\n\nRegistration Deadline is February 17\n\nEnsuring access to the right materials and technology for students who are blind or visually impaired is a priority for the Assistive Technology and Accessible Educational Materials (AT&AEM) Center at OCALI.\n\n“It’s essential for students with visual impairments to have their materials at the same time as their classmates,” explains one central Ohio teacher for the visually impaired. “It’s an issue of equity. It’s an issue of allowing them to be engaged in their learning. If you don’t have your materials in front of you, how do you engage? It lets students be active learners in the moment and gain the most out of the lesson that’s going on.”\n\nEach year, the AT&AEM Center at OCALI conducts the Federal Quota Registration of Blind Students on behalf of the Ohio Department of Education, Office for Exceptional Children, to qualify for the federal quota allotment of funds to purchase accessible educational materials. These include textbooks and equipment available from the American Printing House for the Blind, Inc. (APH) for each registered student.\n\nDating back to the 1800’s, the Federal Quota Act was created for the “specific purpose of ‘manufacturing and furnishing books and other materials specially adapted for instruction’ for students who are blind in the United States and its Territories. As the first law enacted by Congress to support the education of students with visual disabilities, it has become a landmark.”\n\n“The Federal Quota program provides supplemental funding for materials and technologies to ensure access to the curriculum for blind students,” said Jen Govender, AEM Specialist. “Braille textbooks, devices such as the Refreshabraille or the Perkins Brailler, table and handheld magnification devices, and instructional materials are some of the accessible educational materials produced by the American Printing House for the Blind for eligible students through the program.\n\nIn December, a letter with instructions from the Ohio Department of Education was emailed to superintendents and/or directors requesting them to register each student who is legally blind and attending school in their district. Braille and large print textbooks and other specialized materials are expensive, so it is important to register each eligible student. The deadline to submit registration is February 17, 2023.\n\nOnce registration forms are electronically submitted and signed, the AT&AEM Center then administers the allocation based on the number of registered Ohio students who are legally blind. As early as March, teachers can start requesting materials for their new students. The Center encourages teachers to be proactive and request materials for the following year. Once requests come in, the AT&AEM Center processes and fulfills those requests. Then, teachers receive their materials and can start using them right away with their students.\n\n2023 Eligibility Requirements\n\nView the complete 2023 eligibility guidelines and more on the Obtaining AEM Federal Quota webpage https://ataem.org/obtaining-aem/federal-quota.\n\nQuestions?\n\nContact us at fqaemsupport@ocali.org,\n\nWhat’s New at OCALI\n\nOCALICONLINE 2023: Early Bird Registration Open\n\nConnect with your peers and colleagues at OCALICONLINE 2023 – the premier autism and disabilities conference – November 14-17, 2023.

Check out OCALI’s NEW Resource Crosswalk.\n\nAccess, Belonging, & Community\n\nBy Shawn Henry\n\nIf you attended OCALICONLINE this year, you likely heard me talk about the equation A + B = C, where A stands for access, B stands for belonging, and C stands for community.\n\nYou see, we cannot have true community until we have access and belonging for all. If you have belonging but not access, you are not including everyone in the equation. If you have access but not belonging, you are merely providing space but not engagement. C is only achievable when A and B are both parts of the equation.\n\nConsider the outdoor movies that communities host in their local parks. Imagine the big, colorful television screen, the cool night air, and people sitting on blankets. It’s a wonderful community experience. But, how many of them are not truly COMMUNITY experiences?\n\nWhat simple things could happen that could facilitate the A plus B equals C equation?\n\nMaybe it is ensuring that there is a paved area so that people in wheelchairs can easily get there to watch the movie and sit with their families. Perhaps it is turning on the captions on the movie so that those who are deaf and hard of hearing can read the screen. Or maybe it’s offering technology that allows those who are blind or visually impaired to experience the movie with audio descriptions.\n\nMoving From Exceptions to Expectations\n\nWhile the concept may seem simple, I often find that implementation is the most difficult. To put this equation into practice, we must intentionally ensure that we are putting these principals into action. A + B = C happens when we go from access and belonging being exceptions in our community to being expectations in our community. It becomes the rule by which we design our community experiences. We build the ramp first because everyone can use the ramp instead of building the steps first and then deciding to build a ramp.\n\nWe need the A + B = C equation to be part of the daily conversation so that instead of people with disabilities asking, “Do you have this,” they are able to ask, “Where is it?”\n\nInstead of asking, “Do you have a sensory room,” the question becomes, “Where is the sensory room?” Instead of asking, “Do you have a place where I can watch the movie from my wheelchair,” you ask, “Where is the space for me to watch the movie from my wheelchair?”\n\nThat is when we know we have made the A+ B = C equation a reality.\n\nFrom Why to How\n\nTo do this, we must build confidence within our communities to be able to ask the right questions and make the right decisions when they are designing spaces, places, and events. Instead of asking why, we need to ask how? So often, we are quick to say it’s never enough. We must start looking at small wins as true wins so that we can appreciate them and then build on them—take that one gesture and use it to start building capacity and confidence so that it snowballs into the A + B = C equation. We often think that one little change isn’t enough, so why bother with the one little change? Well, little things really do matter. Small gestures really do matter in our lives. Small gestures in our day can make a huge difference in cultivating a sense of belonging for those in our communities who most need it. We have to take the wins, big or small, and build on them until we reach true belonging and accessibility, so that we can reach a spirit of true community.\n\nCultivating Confidence & Competence\n\nSince our founding, OCALI has been focused on the three P’s—partnership, policy, and practice. It takes all three of these to build that confidence and competence within communities, but perhaps the most important is partnerships.\n\nIn the coming year, we will be prioritizing the opportunity to identify new partnerships and opportunities within our communities to cultivate this sense of belonging so that our goal of ensuring people with autism and disabilities have the opportunity to live their best lives for their whole lives is truly realized. As an organization, this is how we will make our A + B = C equation work.\n\nIt is only by working together that we can ensure that everyone in our community truly has access to and belongs to our community. It’s as simple as A + B = C. And it just adds up.\n\nOCALICON’s 16th Edition a Sweet Success\n\nConference Welcomes Record Number of Participants\n\n“I would recommend this to anyone who works with children with disabilities. There is something for everyone!”\n\n“The amount of information that I took away from this conference was amazing! I am looking forward to implementing many of the strategies I’ve learned. I will be back next year!”\n\n“It was so wonderful being able to attend virtually an international conference from my own home in New Zealand – while I would have loved a trip to America – being able to join online made it so achievable!”\n\n“I love the inclusion you all create here!”\n\nThese are just a few of the comments from participants in OCALICONLINE 2022, the premier autism and disabilities conference. This year, OCALI celebrated its “Sweet 16” from November 15-18, with over 16,000 registrants from all 50 states and 50 countries. “We are so thrilled to welcome state, national, and international leaders, educators, related services professionals, parents, and self-advocates to our largest event ever,” said Shawn Henry, executive director. “It is so inspiring to convene such an energized and passionate community to focus on solutions and strategies for addressing our biggest challenges and opportunities.”\n\nThe event opened on Tuesday with a thoughtful and candid keynote conversation between 3 luminaries, leaders, and legends in the field – Temple Grandin, Judy Heumann, and Haben Girma. Weaving in examples from their own personal and professional journeys, Temple, Judy, and Haben provided insights and observations on different ways of thinking about and approaching issues related to access, universal design, and education. One attendee commented – “I loved being able to see the conversation between these three women. It was really interesting to learn about their personal experiences, but also how those experiences can be used to make positive changes in the present and future.”\n\nAfter the opening keynote, attendees could “choose their own adventure” in selecting from over 300 sessions offered Tuesday afternoon through Friday. “We had over 60 different topics this year,” said Jill Hudson, content specialist. “From Behavior to Early Childhood to PBIS to Transition and Adulthood to Universal Design for Learning – there were numerous sessions and discussions designed to help further understanding, expand capacities, and build access and opportunities for people with disabilities. It’s a real privilege and honor to showcase and share the knowledge, understanding, and experiences of the more than 500 presenters and facilitators that participated this year. We’re so grateful for the sharing of their time, talents, and expertise.” The online Session Sorter tool lets attendees peruse the entire catalog to find sessions that best match their work and interests. “While the volume of offerings can be overwhelming, the Session Sorter really lets you fine tune your choices and schedule so you can maximize your participation in the conference, and find what works best for you,” said Hudson.\n\nCEUs and Graduate Credit were offered through a multitude of licensing agencies, organizations, and universities. Additional highlights included the 2022 Award Winners and the streaming of OCALI’s programs and projects through the OCALI Channel. “The OCALI Channel ran continuously throughout the conference,” said Simon Buehrer, event specialist. “We used it to showcase some of the projects and personalities behind our work and offerings. It’s also where our hosts, the Good Life Ambassadors, helped attendees stay on track with reminders and suggestions and re-energize between sessions.” Each afternoon was also punctuated with an Energy Break hosted by the conference team. “Those are always a fun addition to the event,” said Buehrer. “It gives everyone a chance to sit back for a few minutes to relax and recharge before jumping back into sessions and networking.”\n\nDaily 2022 highlights videos are posted on the OCALI YouTube channel. Attendees can continue to access on-demand sessions through Thursday, December 15, 2022. “We’re excited that the learning and discovery continues for a few weeks after the live event,” said Hudson. “Attendees can catch sessions they might have missed – or rewatch their favorites.”\n\n“What an amazing year,” said Henry. “We’re excited to build on this year’s gathering and continue the connections and community into the new year – and beyond.”\n\nOCALICONLINE 2023 will take place online November 14-17.

Meet Valerie and learn more about what’s new at the Lending Library.\n\nYou’re new to OCALI and the Lending Library. Tell us a little bit about yourself and your background.\n\n“I was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, and received my BA in Psychology from Otterbein University and my MLIS Degree from Kent State. I have worked in various public library branches for more than 16 years and have had a wide range of roles, including Youth Services Supervisor and Adult Services Librarian. I am also the mom of two young children, so when I am not at work, I’m spending time with my kids.”\n\nWhat are you most excited about in your new position as librarian?\n\n“I am most excited about working with this wonderful organization. I get to apply my educational knowledge and background working in libraries, but I also have opportunities for development and learning new skills. One of my professional goals this year is to extend the library’s reach and raise more awareness about OCALI by distributing information to targeted libraries across Ohio.”\n\nTell us what you’ve been working on to refresh and improve the Lending Library.\n\n“Since I started almost three months ago, there have been so many updates and new resources. We’ve been creating videos to help users register and navigate our new library site, processing curriculum kits, and the entire book collection has been shifted around to create book displays featuring new titles.”\n\nFor those who aren’t familiar, how would you describe the Lending Library?\n\n“OCALI’s Lending Library is like a traditional library, but so much more! Our library offers thousands of free materials, resources, and technology on a range of topics that are applicable to various disabilities and for all ages from early childhood to adulthood.”\n\nWho can use the Lending Library?\n\n“Anyone 18 or older who lives or works in Ohio can borrow materials from OCALI’s Lending Library. For shipping purposes, users do have to have an Ohio residential or work address. If you meet these requirements, I encourage you to explore the library and our collections. I’m sure you will find something that interests you!”\n\nWhat is the greatest benefit for educators, families, or individuals using the Lending Library?\n\n“The greatest benefit is that we have a unique library with a multitude of resources for families and educators. Our collections range from assistive technology, books, and curriculum kits, to books in braille and large print for individuals who are blind or visually impaired. We also ship everything at no cost to the user—a definite perk for any Ohioan. The great thing about OCALI’s Lending Library is that we are an extension of the organization. So, if we don’t have what someone is looking for, it’s very likely I can connect with another colleague who has what they need. If anyone has a question about our collections or is wondering if we can assist them, I encourage them to please email me at lendinglibrary@ocali.org.”\n\nAre there any kits/resources that you would like to highlight?\n\n“Yes, we have so many new curriculum support kits in our library that are designed to help support educators and their class themes/units. Some of these kits are text sets, companion kits, and shared reading kits. While there are many more to come, users can check out what’s available now.”\n\nFind What You Need at OCALICONLINE 2022\n\nThe World’s Premier Autism and Disabilities Conference\n\nWe’re just weeks away from OCALICONLINE 2022 – November 15-18.

One in five people in the United States have a disability, and after the pandemic, there are millions more newly disabled people who have been impacted by the virus. Voter turnout during the 2020 elections demonstrated the disability community’s desire for civic engagement, advocacy, and to have their voices heard.\n\nRecently, OCALI’s Family and Community Outreach director, Gwen Harshaw, sat down with Kevin Truitt, legal advocacy director at Disability Rights Ohio—a statewide, non-profit organization that fights for civil, human, and legal rights for people with disabilities across Ohio to discuss voting rights and supports available to the disability community.\n\n“Over the years, we’ve heard from people with disabilities who think they are not allowed to vote,” shares Truitt. “That’s simply not true and it’s important that we correct any misinformation that is out there and make sure that people know their rights.”\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions is that people under the care of a guardian or those in nursing homes, residential facilities, or hospitals cannot vote, which is not true. There are special processes and mechanisms in place to make it easier for people to vote. Unfortunately, most people do not know the information.\n\n“This is an important responsibility that we take on at Disability Rights Ohio—making sure that people know about all of the ways they can vote, what resources are available, and how they can get the support they need to ensure their voices are heard,” explains Truitt.\n\nThe good news is that the pandemic opened up new ways and accommodations for people with disabilities to vote like never before, including early voting, same-day registration, drop boxes, mail-in voting, and more.\n\nVoter Registration Deadline: October 11\n\nFor the November 8 election, the deadline to register—in-person, online, or by mail—is October 11. Learn more and register.\n\nFor those who need assistance registering or need help completing the form, contact Disability Rights Ohio at https://www.disabilityrightsohio.org/ or 800-282-9181. The team is there to ensure questions are answered and people feel comfortable with the voting process.\n\nAbsentee Ballots\n\nFor those who are unable to vote in-person and would like to vote via absentee ballot, the absentee ballot application deadline is Saturday at noon before Election Day. To learn more about how to how to submit an absentee ballot, visit https://www.ohiosos.gov/elections/voters/absentee-ballot/.\n\nMore to Come\n\nWatch for more information on laws to support voting rights, additional resources, etc. in a video interview coming soon.

Learn more about our new guide to assist the process.\n\nGrab-n-Go Resource Gallery Kit\n\nThis kit, available through our Lending Library, offers a variety of interventions with how-to explanations to support all learners, including those with autism spectrum disorder.\n\nHow to Use Partners and Data to Help Students Set, Refine, and Achieve Post-School Goals\n\nSchools and agencies have an overlapping responsibility to serve and engage with transition youth. Because many youth with disabilities are eligible to receive services from one or more agencies while in school, it is important to plan as a multi-agency team. By doing this, agency professionals and schools are able to come together to meet with the student and family to collaboratively fulfill their separate responsibilities, which helps to properly sequence supports and help the youth toward their adult life goals.\n\nAge-appropriate transition assessment, often called AATA or simply ‘transition assessment’ is defined by the Division on Career Development and Transition, DCDT, of the Council for Exceptional Children, as “an ongoing process of collecting data on the individual’s needs, preferences, and interests as they relate to the demands of current and future working, educational, living, personal and social environments.”\n\nThe purpose of transition assessment is different than the purpose of assessment for eligibility or progress monitoring. Transition assessment focuses on what the youth can do, their strengths, and assets. Transition assessment also compares the youth’s current profile of Preferences, Interests, Needs, and Strengths or Skills (PINS) to what they need in order to accomplish their adult life goals, which will help the team develop skill development goals, training opportunities, transition services, and other supports to help the youth prepare for their adult life.\n\nThe transition assessment planning process is designed to address five basic questions:\n\nWhat are the youth’s adult life goals?\n\nWhat are the youth’s PINS?\n\nHow well-aligned are the youth’s current skills to the set of skills needed in the future?\n\nWhat other or additional information does the team need to know?\n\nWhat assessment tools, methods, and strategies will be used to address the assessment questions?\n\nFor schools, collecting data from the transition assessment is a required part of the Individuals Education Plan (IEP) beginning no later than age 14. However, it is not always clear what data should be collected or how to interpret and use the data.\n\nThat is where the new, online AATA Planning Guide can help. The guide was designed to support IEP team members and transition-age students in thoughtfully and intentionally planning for transition assessment. The tool begins with an introduction section that focuses on building a multi-agency team to support the youth.\n\n“We hope this tool will help guide educators, youth, families, and other team members through the transition assessment planning process, making it easier to identify goals, build that full youth profile from all perspectives, and document ‘the gap’ for a student,” shares Alex Corwin, Director, Lifespan Transitions Center at OCALI. “In the end, we want to help the student and their team successfully navigate to the adult life goals and vision\n\nTwo ways learn more:\n\nJoin us virtually at 4 p.m. tomorrow, August 25, for a new InspirED episode on Planning for Transition Assessment.

Space is limited.\n\nLiving Your Moments Well With Other People\n\nWhen we talk about building and enriching stronger, more inclusive communities, there are many different ideas, theories, and formulas for how to cultivate, nurture, and sustain them effectively. These efforts can certainly be challenging, complicated—even difficult.\n\nBut what if they weren’t? What if our collective efforts as professionals, parents, self-advocates, supporters, and allies, could be strengthened and improved simply by being more familiar with each other? What if we could build better connections, networks, and relationships simply by being more involved and participating in more activities together?\n\nCould it really be that simple?\n\nWell, that’s exactly the framework that Tim Vogt, Danyetta Najoli, and Jill Mays set out to discuss and explore in a recent conversation highlighted in the latest episode of OCALI’s Inspiring Change podcast.\n\nTim and Danyetta both work for Starfire, a Cincinnati-based organization that has been building better lives for people with disabilities since 1993. Jill Mays is a development and community relations coordinator for PSU in Lebanon, Ohio.\n\n“If you’re in the space of being interested in building a more inclusive world, either through your work or through your family or through your community or for yourself, remember that strategically, it’s not all going to happen at once,” shares Vogt. “It’s going to take small steps.”\n\nTim, Danyetta, and Jill have been studying the building blocks of psychology and research around inclusion, including principles related to familiarity, quality connections, and shared activities. These principles don’t apply only to people with disabilities, but really to everyone.\n\nThe Familiarity Principle\n\nThe familiarity principle states that, as human beings, we prefer people and things that we see or experience frequently. It could be someone you see every day on your way to work, for example.\n\n“Basically, when you break this principle down, we’re talking about our comfort zones,” says Mays. “Whether it’s people with disabilities or people of different ethnicity, representation really does matter—in the media or just in our lives. It makes a difference if we see people and things around us, because it makes us more comfortable and more familiar.”\n\nQuality Connections Principle\n\nSimply put, this principle explores the characteristics of high-quality connections, including a person feeling respected, helped, and engaging in ways that are creative or playful.\n\nNajoli emphasizes the importance of quality connections and inclusion by believing that a person’s quality of life is almost in direct correlation to the person supporting them.\n\n“I would love for people to be trained and to learn continually and know that it’s not just a static way to be, but you have to continue to learn and grow,” shares Najoli. “And whatever it is for you that gets you into a space of continually learning. It can be personal coaching, life coaching, or growth and development work—anything to keep a person stretching and growing.”\n\nShared Activities Principle\n\nThis principle is designed to build trust and connections through shared interests and activities.\n\n“For me, I’ve seen when shared interests help level the playing field and people just take off their titles and labels,” explains Najoli. “During the pandemic, I saw this in my neighborhood where we put together a street concert. I thought that was a great way to endorse what I love doing because I was willing to spend time to organize it and gather the artists, and it was great seeing people just play together and enjoy music.”\n\nConnecting the Principles\n\n“What if the way to build a connected life was through these small, high-quality experiences that people got to see each other over and over, and they were respecting each other, helping each other, and playing around to invent really cool experiences,” says Vogt. “It just feels like we’ve got a huge opportunity in front of us.”\n\nSensory-Friendly Morning Offered\n\nAugust 3, 10am-1pm\n\nThe Ohio State Fair—from the rides and attractions to the concerts, shows, and the ever-famous food, the Fair is an annual event and tradition for thousands of Ohioans. At this mecca of endless fun and entertainment, fairgoers experience the bright lights, loud sounds, and distinguishable smells—you know the ones, the mouth-watering smells of funnel cakes and french fries to the unique scents coming from the animal barns. While these sensory-stimulating features may not interfere with most fairgoers’ experience, others’ senses may be heightened by these things, impacting their overall Fair experience.\n\nTo ensure all Ohioans can positively experience the Fair, OCALI has partnered with the Ohio Expo Commission to host the Fair’s Sensory-Friendly Morning on Wednesday, August 3 from 10am– 1pm. During these designated hours, fairgoers can experience a sensory-friendly morning where the lights will be lowered and the sounds turned down. For those looking to take a break, they can relax in the OCALI Quiet Room. Located in the Ohio Building, this quiet, air-conditioned space will offer a variety of low-tech and mid-tech solutions to support a variety of sensory needs, including fidgets, weighted lap pads, sensory processing toys, and more. The Quiet Room will be operational every day of the Fair, with additional enhancements provided by OCALI on Sensory-Friendly Morning.\n\n“By turning down the lights and sounds for just a few hours on a weekday morning, we hope to make the Fair a more pleasurable experience for those who need a break from exploring the many activities of the Fair,” shares Alicia Shoults, Assistant General Manager, Ohio Expo Center & State Fair.\n\nIn addition to the Sensory-Friendly Morning, the Fair will build upon its existing accessibility efforts and feature additional wheelchair/mobility charging stations and technology to connect people who are blind or have low vision to an agent who can help with navigation. These efforts are all designed to expand access and ensure inclusivity.\n\n“At OCALI, we believe in a world where everyone deserves access to their community,” explains Shawn Henry, Executive Director at OCALI. “These features at the Fair help to create a common experience with unique considerations that allow greater access for all.”\n\nOCALI and other organizations, including Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities, have partnered closely with the Ohio Expo Commission this year to carefully plan these features to improve accessibility.\n\n“When our mission and vision of inspiring change and promoting access aligns with our partner’s mission of community engagement, we allow everyone the opportunity to live their best lives,” shares Henry. “To make change happen, we need to continue to engage in partnerships where people are willing change the status quo, and that’s what this partnership with the Ohio Expo Commission has been about.”\n\nShoults agrees. “We’re thrilled to have such a strong partnership with the experts at OCALI. They have been instrumental in providing guidance that will help us to ensure that the Fair can be enjoyable for as many Ohioans as possible.”\n\nOCALI is Hiring!\n\nWe are a mission-driven team committed to promoting access and inspiring change for people with disabilities and those who live with, love, and support them.

The Ohio Department of Education works with stakeholders to set annual targets – or goals – for how districts should perform on these indicators.\n\nEvery year, districts receive a Special Education Profile that shows whether they are meeting their goals, over time, for students with disabilities. The design of the Special Education Profile helps districts use data about services and outcomes for students with disabilities to keep improving their special education programs. These data give schools answers about kindergarten readiness, achievement levels, access to general education environments, preparedness for life beyond high school, services for children with disabilities, and equitable outcomes.\n\nThe primary basis of each district’s 2021-2022 Special Education Profile is the final special education program data that districts submitted through the state’s Education Management Information System (EMIS) for the 2020-2021 school years. The Special Education Profile also reflects a district’s performance on each indicator for up to four previous years. (Source: Ohio Department of Education)\n\nResults for Students with Disabilities\n\nThe Special Education Profiles notify districts of their performance on the key indicators set forth by IDEA. Profiles also inform districts of any activities they must complete based on these indicators. The report includes data only about students with disabilities, unless otherwise shown.\n\nSolving Problems of Practice Through Data Analysis\n\nIn the May 19, 2022 InspirED episode, Shawna Benson from the Teaching Diverse Learners Center at OCALI and Andrea DiFrancesco, Education Program Specialist – Urban Support from the Ohio Department of Education model the use of a data collection template that can be populated with Special Education Profile and other data sets as a tool for problem solving. They explore a sample problem of practice that challenges the service provision for learners with disabilities. Other relevant examples could include topics such as disproportionality, LRE across subgroups, access to Tier 1 instruction across subgroups, graduation outcomes across subgroups, language and literacy outcomes across subgroups, etc.\n\nGet the Details\n\nThese are just a few of the topics explored in the recent InspirED Virtual Learning Series episode, Revisiting Special Education Profile Data: Solving Problems of Practice Through Data Analysis.\n\nFree Summer Braille Series & Other Online Resources\n\nFor 17 years, Ohio has been the recipient of a braille training grant from the Federal Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, known as the Braille Excellence for Students and Teachers (BEST).\n\nThe BEST project is a statewide program of professional development and technical assistance dedicated to braille literacy, braille instruction, braille materials, and braille technology in Ohio schools.
