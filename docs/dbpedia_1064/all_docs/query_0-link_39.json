        "text": "Braille books are important so children are introduced to reading at a young age, through physically holding a book, learning about spelling and punctuation, they can read a story and be transported to the place in the book! It is also a way of bonding and connecting with your child and sharing a book together.\n\nYPRL is committed to meeting the needs of our diverse community and have added some beautiful braille books to start our collection. We know it is so important for our children to be exposed to a literacy rich environment. To have books that have braille, print and pictures can assist children to participate in reading as they explore with their hands along with their eyes.\n\nYou can search for Braille books in our collection by typing in 'braille' on the Yarra Plenty Regional Library website, you can get started now by heading over to our catalogue!"
