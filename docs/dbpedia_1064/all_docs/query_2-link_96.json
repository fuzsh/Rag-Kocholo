        "text": "Champagne: In the process of manufacturing Champagne, riddling racks are a must have. Once the sparkling wine has began to age, it will be time for the concluding stages. Riddling is essential to the life of Champagne as it collects the sediment in bottles and deposits it near the bottle‚Äôs mouth. This sediment is what helps to bring the bubbles bursting out when you pop the cork. Champagne bottles are put on riddling racks at a 45 degree angle, comprising the two rectangular boards that have been hinged at the top of the rack. On each side of the rack, there are ten rows that contain six holes for the necks of the bottles. Due to their structure and shape, each riddling rack is capable of holding 120 bottles, although there are special models that are made to hold more. The riddler, who places the bottles, will place a bottle neck into each one of the holes on the riddling racks. There are painted lines at the bottom of each bottle, which acts as a marker for placing the bottles.\n\nLet's talk about #champagne glass ‚Äì flute! ‚ö´ The champagne #flute (French: fl√ªte √† champagne) is a stem glass with either a tall tapered conical shape or elongated slender bowl. ‚ö´ The #rim - This is the point where the wine makes contact with the drinker‚Äôs mouth. ‚ö´ The #chimney - Some glasses have a tapered, narrow section just before the rim. ‚ö´ The #bowl - This is the most important part of the glass, where the wine settles. ‚ö´ The #epicure - Some glasses have an epicure, which is an indentation at the base of the bowl to show the true color of the wine to elevate your wine experience to the fullest. ‚ö´ The #stem - Gives the glass height as well as provides something to hold. ‚ö´ The #base - Also known as the foot, is perfectly flat giving the glass stability.\n\nAre you popping some bubbly on New Year‚Äôs Eve? üçæ Watch out for that cork! It can fly out at up to 27mph. I have a friend who got a black eye from a flying cork. Follow these directions ‚¨áÔ∏è for the perfect, and safe cork pop! üçæ 1. Chill the Champagne Sparkling wines should be chilled before they are opened to reduce the pressure in the bottle and prevent the geyser effect when the cork is released. Chill in a refrigerator or in a wine bucket with ice & water. Don‚Äôt jostle the bottle before opening to prevent pressure from building. Make sure the bottle is dry before you start to open it. 2. Cut the Foil Use a foil cutter or wine key to cut the foil off the top of your champagne bottle to expose the wine cage and cork. Many bottles feature a pull tab to remove the foil, but a foil cutter trims a smooth, clean line around the top. 3. Remove the Cork Cage Lift and twist the wire tab of the cork cage counter-clockwise ~ 6 times to loosen it from over the top of the bottle. You may start to feel the cork pushing upward so it‚Äôs good to keep a thumb over the top of the bottle as you work. 4. Cover the Cork with a Towel Place a dish towel over the top of the bottle to provide an extra safety precaution to catch a flying cork. 5. Angle the Bottle and Rotate Hold the bottle at a 45-degree angle pointing away from your body (and not at anybody!). Rotate the bottle, not the cork itself or it can break in the opening of the bottle. 6. Remove the Cork As you twist the bottle, you‚Äôll feel the cork loosen and push upward. Slowly guide the cork out of the bottle. This will keep the champagne from flowing out of the bottle. And, cheers! Let's make 2024 the best ever. #nye #champagne #toast #cleancraftedwine\n\nFoiled again?! Last year, to the surprise of some, wirehoods and foils on Champagne were no longer required by law. Since then the UMC (Union des Maisons de Champagne) and AOC Champagne rules have insisted on them. Enter Michel Chapoutier, the Rhone wine merchant. Just as he was launching champagnes under his own name, he controversially suggested that wirehoods and foils had nothing to do with quality, and should be abandoned, citing corporate responsibility. There are cogent arguments for ditching foils and wirehoods. From an ecological point of view, it obviates unnecessary waste. Economically, it avoids a cost of aluminium ‚Äì which is pricier than it used to be. Cynics might suggest that foils usefully hide uneven fill heights (which would just be a deceit on the consumer). It is interesting that just as artisanal Australian Riesling producers are eschewing screwcaps in favour of corks and beeswax for environmental reasons, fizz could choose to do the same. In fact, before 1850 corks were covered with wax or tar to protect them. Such suggestion has not gone down well with the champagnois who consider the wirehoods and foils to be iconic. They are outraged. M. Chapoutier had poured a red wine without a ‚Äòheaddress‚Äô at the launch. Having secured media interest in his new champagne range, he returned to the Rhone reassuring everyone that it was just his personal view. Is this a serious point? Is it a masterclass in self-publicity at a product launch? Who knows? My grandmother always used to say ‚ÄòIf you want to get ahead get a hat‚Äô. Does that apply if you‚Äôre a bottle of fizz?\n\nLadies, if you're wearing lipstick and enjoying a glass of wine, here's a little tip to keep in mind: sip from the same location each time. Why? Well, having lipstick marks all around the rim of your glass can be a bit unsightly. Instead, take a moment to glance at your glass and ensure you're sipping from the same side each time. It's a small adjustment that can make a big difference in maintaining your elegant appearance. üíÑüç∑ What are your thoughts on wine etiquette?
