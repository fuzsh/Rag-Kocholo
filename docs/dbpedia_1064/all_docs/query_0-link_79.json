        "text": "All India Confederation of the Blind (AICB) convened a Conference on the status of Braille in the Asian region in New Delhi on 22nd and 23rd December, 2008. 119 delegates from 21 States of the country, 16 representatives from 11 countries of the Asian region and officers from leading International Organizations like International Council of Educators for Visually Impaired, Norwegian Association of the Blind and Partially Sighted and Sight Savers International participated in the Conference. The Conference deliberated upon various aspects relating to Braille development, co-ordination, Braille production, Braille teaching, awareness generation etc. All the ABU affiliates agreed on a comprehensive plan of action in the concluding session of the conference to implement in their respective regions. The complete plan of action has been given in appendix II of this report. According to this plan the affiliates agreed to initiate the efforts to achieve the following objectives: • An independent National Braille Authority will be set up in every participating country to oversee all aspects of Braille development and production; • Uniform Braille mathematics and Science code will be adopted for every participating country; • All blind children in every participating country will get all textbooks in Braille, free of cost for elementary and secondary stages of education within the next five years and the use of audio material in place of Braille textbooks will be avoided; • Braille production centers will be suitably strengthen and networked to have a much larger number of books in Braille; • Government-run mainstream libraries should have a Braille section and these should be suitably enriched; • Inclusive education programmes must ensure that Braille is properly taught to all visually impaired children; • New and progressive methods and techniques of Braille teaching should be introduced in schools; • Teachers of Braille should be provided opportunities of updating their knowledge through orientation courses from time to time devised in the concluding session of the conference. In order to achieve these objectives, all the ABU affiliates were requested time to time to forward the Plan to the concerned Government Authorities and organizations in their countries and meet their officers personally also to persuade them for implementing the action-points agreed in the plan of action. In order to monitor the progress ABU accepted the responsibility to contact its affiliates time to time and ask them for the periodical reports. Part 2: the objectives of the research • To investigate the status of implementation of the plan of action adopted during the concluding session of the conference on status of Braille in the Asian region in New Delhi on 22nd and 23rd December, 2008. • To develop a course of action for ABU for the improvement in the plan of action. A questionnaire was designed to investigate the status of efforts being made by the ABU affiliates to achieve the above objectives. . This research tool was sent to all the 28 participating organizations out of which only 10 organizations returned the filled questionnaire. In spite of the fact that the research tool was made available in three languages like English, Arabic and Russian to facilitate the affiliates with the proper understanding of the tool, only ten organizations responded after ten periodical reminders...\n\nThe visually challenged are often alienated from mainstream society because of their disabilities. This problem is even more pronounced in developing countries which often do not have the resources necessary to integrate this people group into their communities or even help them to become independent. It should therefore be the aim of governments in developing countries to provide this vulnerable people group with access to assistive technologies at a low cost. This paper describes an ongoing project that aims to provide low-cost assistive technologies to the visually challenged in Barbados. As a part of this project a study was conducted on a sample of visually challenged members of the Barbados Association for the Blind and Deaf to determine their ICT skills, knowledge of Braille and their use of assistive technologies. An analysis of the results prompted the design and creation of a low-cost Braille device prototype. The cost of this prototype was about one-half that of a commercially available device and can be used without a screen reader. This device should help create equal opportunities for the visually challenged in Barbados and other developing countries. It should also allow the visually challenged to become more independent.\n\nHadith Nabawi is the second most important sources in Islam after the Quran. It’s great compliment to the Quran for a deeper understanding of the teaching found inside it. The visually impaired people understanding of the Quran have been help out by government incentive by creating the Braille Quran. This incentive helps the visually impaired people to read the Quran using the Braille system. Even thought that Hadith is the second source of Islam but it access to it by the visually impaired people require more attention. There are less developed Braille Hadith in Malaysia. The learning of Hadith would enable the visually impaired people to appreciate and understand the Sunnah of the Prophet which is in line with the teaching of the Quran. The objective of this study is to find out the development of Braille Hadith in Malaysia. The method of this study is using qualitative method by referring to literature from books, articles, journals, etc. Early finding shows that the development ..."
