        "text": "We shall deploy existing Gurmukhi OCR, among other applications, for generation of Braille books for visually challenged to meet the current demand for Braille Books in Indian languages. These will be deployed with the help of NGOâs and government institutions. The OCR will be packaged appropriately with interfacing for Braille printing with the human operator in the loop will be implemented for the purpose of deployment.\n\nTechnology will be developed for dealing with documents having complex layout e.g newspaper and magazines. Current Gurmukhi OCR cannot deal with italicized and bold fonts. Also, the OCR fails for large point sizes. We shall remove these limitations and make the OCR more robust against font variations. Further, language specific post processing tools which can exploit performance models of the OCR can enhance the final word recognition rates.\n\nThere are a large number of scientific and research issues involved in developing technology for processing images of old books. Degradation in the quality of the pages and printed matter pose a different kind of a challenge for historical documents. Old layouts and printing technology affects appearance in a distinct way which makes application of standard OCR techniques difficult. Further, for many languages scripts and alphabets have undergone historical evolutions making current recognition systems inadequate."
