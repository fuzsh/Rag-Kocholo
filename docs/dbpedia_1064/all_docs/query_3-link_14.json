This helped me know how to assist my daughter with braille practice. My daughter really liked having a pen pal. It really encouraged her to read and compose braille daily.”\n\nBraille Brilliance has given my child the opportunity to practice and continue to learn Braille over the summer. Last year was his first year of instruction in Braille, and I thought it was a great idea for him to have summer practice. We were able to participate in one Saturday event, the Cooking Extravaganza – he had a great time! As parents, we learned some things, too!”\n\nIt has allowed my son to begin learning braille music. He loves music and is very interested in it. This will be very valuable for him when he needs to sight read music for chorus and band. The fact that it is done in the home has also been such a great aspect too.”"
