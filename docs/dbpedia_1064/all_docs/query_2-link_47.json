        "text": "LOS ANGELES March 13, 2019\n\nAn affordable system to translate standard files and display them in braille has long been the dream of blind people and educators across the world. The Duxbury Braille Translator – Orbit Edition, announced today by Orbit Research LLC and Duxbury Systems, Inc. at the CSUN Assistive Technology Conference finally makes this a reality. It is the world’s most affordable, full-featured Braille Translation and Display system, priced at a fraction of the cost of similar systems.\n\nOrbit Research, manufacturer of the Orbit Reader 20 – the world’s most affordable Braille Reader, Notetaker and Refreshable Braille Display and Duxbury Systems Inc., the developer of the Duxbury Braille Translation (DBT) – the braille translation software used by virtually all of the world’s leading braille publishers, joined forces to create the Duxbury Braille Translator – Orbit Edition.\n\nReleased initially for the Indian market, the Duxbury Braille Translator – Orbit Edition enables users to convert Microsoft Word documents, text files and HTML to braille with market-leading accuracy and ease.

The system supports 24 Indian languages including Assamese, Awadhi, Bengali, Bhojpuri, Gujarati, Haryanvi, Hindi, Kannada, Kurukh, Magahi, Maithili, Malayalam, Marathi, Meitei (Manipuri), Oriya, Punjabi, Sadri, Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi, Sylheti, Tamil, Telugu, Urdu. It translates these into contracted and un-contracted grades of braille for each language.\n\nThe joint mission of the companies was to create a low-cost ecosystem that enables students and adult users to have access to files of various common formats that are found in the school, workplace and on the internet and allow accurate and easy translation to and from braille that can be displayed on the Orbit Reader 20.\n\nThe introduction of the braille translation and display solution to the Indian braille user community is a natural continuation of both companies’ quest to promote braille literacy and offer innovative and affordable solutions to enhance access to digital and print information and improve communication between sighted and blind people.\n\nThe Duxbury Braille Translator – Orbit Edition is available for purchase with the Orbit Reader 20 or separately by calling +91-6353-512-142 or emailing sales@orbitresearch.com.\n\nAbout Orbit Research:\n\nOrbit Research develops and manufactures innovative and affordable products that enable an independent lifestyle for people who are blind or visually impaired.
