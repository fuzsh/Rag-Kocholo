        "text": "“He scoured all of British Punjab looking for families from my society who may have blind children, but there was no one like me. Eventually he found a blind school in Bombay started by American missionaries in Dadar.”\n\nThe 1300-mile distance between Lahore and Bombay was crossed via an anguished train journey, with Mehta sobbing inconsolably and his escort being his father’s nephew, Prakash Anand. Anand had an ulterior motive in visiting Bombay – he wished to become a filmmaker. “It was a bizarre experience. I was sobbing and he kept going, ‘Actor! Actor! Quiet, quiet!’. I gather he was gearing up for his chosen profession,” says the 75-year-old writer. The aspiring filmmaker dropped Mehta to the blind school in Dadar; Ved Mehta never met him again during all the three years that he spent there.\n\n“The first year-and-a-half was miserable; I had typhoid and ringworm had ravaged much of my scalp. Two boys even disappeared from the school. One of them was called Jai Singh; he was the school’s Helen Keller because he was also mute. He only grunted. The teacher hated him, claiming that he didn’t even have the manners to say, “thank you”! But how could he? He was messy, he could not read nor write. And one fine day he just disappeared.”\n\nThe five-year-old from Lahore was quite the fish out of water in his new milieu. “The school housed mainly blind beggars who had been hauled up by the cops and brought there. It was run by a Bengali America-returned gentleman called Dr Halder, who felt I needed special care, given my background. So while the rest of the kids slept on iron-framed beds with thin wooden planks, I was the only one to get a soft mattress with a mosquito net.”\n\nAlso paranoid that a Punjabi may not be able to accustom himself to Maharashtrian cuisine and the local climate, Mehta had the honour of having all his meals with “with Dr and Mrs Halder, even if I did pick up Marathi rather rapidly. Children pick up languages very fast.” Courses included basic arithmetic, English Braille and sports, which at the blind school in Dadar meant running. “I paid a heavy price for my Punjabi roots and my robust upbringing though. I ran much faster than the other kids, who were much older than me by the way. In one such race, I banged so hard into a pole that I started bleeding profusely.”\n\nMehta’s best friend here was a boy called Deoji, “a nice Christian with some vision, and without whom I would have perished.” There was also a mean bully called Abdullah, whom Mehta can not forget. After three years, it was quite obvious that he would have to move on. There were no lessons left to learn from Bombay.\n\nFrom these dim beginnings of pre-Independence India, the man has moved on to pave a path for himself with an almost crusade-like zeal. He has earned a BA from Pomona College, a BA from Oxford and an MA from Harvard. He wrote his first book at 23, and by 1984 had published 15 books in all. At the peak of his career, he did visit Bombay during the early ‘80s to find the blind school in Dadar. “I checked out my name on the register then. But I can’t seem to place the school today. Can you find it out for me? I remember it being tucked between two mills.”\n\nAn illustrious career in journalism with one of the world’s most respected magazines was equally paved with hardship, despite the right breaks. Having served as a staff writer at The New Yorker from 1961 to 1994, Mehta remembers “having a nervous breakdown because an article of mine in the 2 January 1959 issue had to go through 16 readings with the editorial team before finally going in print. That was the level of rigour that made The New Yorker the institution that it is. I worked with and under William Shawn, who when fired in 1987 by the new holding company was still mentally sharp despite being in his 80s. Things changed from hereon. But we were lavishly paid in our times. I remember writing a 29,000-word essay on Oxford philosophy. Now which magazine would allow one such an absurd luxury? A novel of mine was released through nine long articles. All these indulgences were paid for by gaining that one big advertisement for a diamond, one that only five people on the planet could afford. That was the financial logic of the magazine to pamper quality writing.”\n\nWhat made The New Yorker special, he claims, is “the iron curtain” between the advertising and the editorial department.\n\nThe powers that be then felt that mixing the commercial side of the enterprise with the editorial would corrupt the writers on board. When you ask him to comment on the journey India has made over the many years, he baulks. “Please don’t say how India has changed over the years. India is a vast, complex society. The term ‘India’, when used as an all-encompassing unit, is a glaring generalization. I studied history at Oxford, so I am sensitive to such generalizations. That said, Indians are a rather enterprising lot; for instance, they are spreading like a virus in America. They are the Modern Jews of Western civilisation.”\n\nVed Mehta was in the city for a book reading. Daddyji and Mamaji by the author are being re-published in India as part of a special eleven-book series. Daddyji is a biographical portrait of his father. Set in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it is also a story of a Hindu family from an Indian village aspiring to enter the modern world. Mamaji, a portrait of the author’s mother, is also a story where this Hindu family seeks to consolidate its place in the modern world."
