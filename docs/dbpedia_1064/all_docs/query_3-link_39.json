        "text": "After the IEP team has developed the student’s annual goals, they can begin to develop the third required component: the statement of the individualized services and supports the student requires to meet these goals. These can include special education services and any necessary related services, supplementary aids and services, and program modifications. These services and supports should enable a student to:\n\nMake progress toward meeting her academic and/or functional annual goals\n\nBe involved and make progress in the general education curriculum, and to participate in extracurricular (e.g., drama club) and other nonacademic (e.g., attending a school football game) activities\n\nParticipate in these activities with other students, both with and without disabilities\n\nThe various types of services to be considered for each student, as outlined in IDEA, are included below. Additionally, we’ve included examples of each of the four types of services and supports for Yazmina, a high-school student who is blind.\n\nService\n\nExplanation\n\nExample\n\nSpecial Education\n\nSpecially designed instruction that meets the unique needs of a student with a disability in the areas of academics, functional and behavioral skills, and/or secondary transition\n\nMore intensive and individualized instruction than is typically provided in the general education classroom\n\nProvided by an education professional with expertise in individualizing and intensifying instruction, progress monitoring, and data-based decision making\n\nYazmina receives instruction in specialized skills, including how to read and write in braille. This instruction is provided by a teacher of students with visual impairments (TVI).\n\nx\n\nteacher of students with visual impairments (TVI)\n\nA specially trained and certified teacher who provides direct or consultative special education services related to the effects of vision loss.\n\nRelated Services\n\nSupportive services necessary for that student to benefit from special education services\n\nExamples include transportation, psychological services, speech-language therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, counseling, social work services, and school health services\n\nNot allowable: services delivered by a medical doctor or those related to insertion, optimization, or maintenance or replacement of surgically implanted medical devices (e.g., cochlear implant)\n\nUsually provided one or more times per week for short periods of time (e.g., two sessions/week, 30 minutes each)\n\nThe student can receive more than one related service, based on her individual needs\n\nYazmina receives orientation and mobility (O&M) services that teach her how to use a cane to travel independently from place to place, among other skills. These services are provided by an orientation and mobility (O&M) specialist.\n\nx\n\norientation and mobility (O&M)\n\nThe sense of where one’s physical position in relation to other people, objects, and landmarks.\n\nx\n\norientation and mobility (O&M) specialist\n\nA professional who specializes in teaching travel skills to visually impaired persons, including the use of a cane, dog guide, or sophisticated electronic travel aids, as well as the sighted guide technique.\n\nSupplementary Aids and Services\n\nAccommodations or modifications that allow the student to access both education-related and nonacademic school-related activities\n\nx\n\naccommodation\n\nAn adaptation or change to educational environments and practices designed to help students overcome the challenges presented by their disabilities and to allow them to access the same instructional opportunities as students without disabilities. An accommodation does not change the expectations for learning or reduce the requirements of the task.\n\nx\n\nmodification\n\nAny of a number of services or supports that allow a student to access the general education curriculum but in a way that fundamentally alters the content or curricular expectations in question.\n\nCan also include:\n\nOther types of direct services and supports to the student (e.g., health care assistant for a student with significant health needs)\n\nSupport and training for relevant school staff (e.g., collaborative planning time for teachers)\n\nYazmina receives numerous accommodations to help her succeed in her general education classes. Some of those include:\n\nA larger desk to hold her refreshable braille display\n\nx\n\nrefreshable braille display\n\nAn output device that is connected to a computer, often in front of or under the keyboard. It consists of pins arranged in the shape of braille cells that rise and descend to form braille characters.\n\nReadings, handouts, and tests provided in alternate formats (e.g., digital text, braille)\n\nx\n\ndigital text\n\nText presented in a format in which the content is separate from the manner in which it is presented. Students have multiple options for displaying the text font (e.g., size, color) or can access the content as speech or text.\n\nExtended time on tests, because braille takes longer to read\n\nA peer sighted guide for all marching band activities (e.g., rehearsals, evening and weekend football games, parades)\n\nProgram Modifications and Supports for School Personnel\n\nSupports provided to school personnel to assist them in helping a student achieve his or her annual goals and to be involved in the general education classroom\n\nCan include things like training on special equipment, adaptations to the general education classroom, or specialized training for the general education teacher\n\nYazmina’s teachers receive training on how to use her equipment and information on the support that the TVI can provide (e.g., translating worksheets into braille).\n\nTo learn more about the last two items in this table—supplementary aids and services and program modifications or supports—we encourage you to listen to Jim Shriner in this extended IRIS Interview. In addition, he shares his thoughts on further considerations for IEP teams to keep in mind, and some of the ways that IEPs should be used by school personnel (time: 9:36).\n\nConsiderations for IEP Development\n\nNote that collaborative planning time for teachers is one example of supplementary aids and services that can be included in the IEP. Tamara McLean discusses how this is implemented in her school (time: 1:17).\n\nDetermining Appropriate Services and Supports\n\nThe statement of services in a student’s IEP must be written clearly so that the school’s commitment of resources is apparent to parents and other members of the IEP team. To develop this statement of services, the IEP team should consider the overarching question: What services and supports does the student need in order to achieve her annual IEP goals? To help them answer these questions, they can use the guiding questions below.\n\nStatement Elements\n\nGuiding Questions\n\nConsiderations\n\nType of Service\n\nWhat types of services and supports does the student need?\n\nThe services should:\n\nAddress all of the student’s annual goals (e.g., academic, functional, behavior), including those necessary to participate in extracurricular activities\n\nInclude any combination of the four types of services (listed above) necessary to address the student’s needs\n\nAddress secondary transition needs for students age 16 and older (earlier for states with younger age requirements)\n\nEmploy evidence-based practices whenever feasible\n\nx\n\nevidence-based practice\n\nAny of a wide number of discrete skills, techniques, or strategies which have been demonstrated through experimental research or large-scale field studies to be effective. Not to be confused with an evidence-based program.\n\nFrequency\n\nHow often should these services and supports be provided?\n\nCombined, the frequency and duration of services should:\n\nBe sufficiently intensive to help the student achieve her annual goals\n\nIn Shannon Carter’s case (see previous page), her IEP detailed only three class periods of individualized instruction per week, despite the fact that her reading and math skills were four to five years below grade level. Even if her annual goals had been sufficiently challenging and ambitious, the frequency and duration of services were not sufficient to enable her to make appropriate progress.\n\nBe based on the student’s needs, not on service availability. For example, the number of times per week that a student receives speech-language therapy should be based on the amount of time necessary to help her make adequate progress, not on the number of days that an SLP is currently at the school.\n\nDuration\n\nHow much time per day/week is needed for the services and supports?\n\nPerson Responsible\n\nWho will provide the services and supports?\n\nThe person responsible should:\n\nHave adequate training and expertise to be able to deliver the services\n\nBe able to implement evidence-based practices with fidelity\n\nx\n\nfidelity\n\nThe implementation of a practice or program as intended by the researchers or developers.\n\nBe able to collect and analyze data and make data-based decisions\n\nEnvironment\n\nWhere will the services and supports be provided?\n\nWhen determining environment, the IEP team should:\n\nIdentify placement only after specialized instruction, services, supports, frequency, duration, and person responsible have been determined\n\nMake a concerted effort to place—and maintain—the student in the general education setting, with the use of supplementary aids and services when necessary\n\nRecognize that, for some students, placement in more-restrictive settings may be necessary to ensure an appropriate education\n\nA student who is blind may be able to participate in more activities at a state school for the blind because everything—from the cafeteria layout to the equipment used in PE class—is designed to be accessible to students with visual disabilities. Similarly, a student who is Deaf and uses American Sign Language (ASL) may feel more included at a school where all of his teachers and peers also sign, so communication is not delayed as it passes through an ASL interpreter. Some students with health impairments whose immune systems are compromised are educated in home and hospital settings for their own safety.\n\nDocument the reasons for any decision that results in the student’s services being delivered outside of the general education setting\n\nFor more information, view the following:\n\nLRE Information Brief\n\nService Start/End Dates\n\nWhen will services begin and end?\n\nThe services should:\n\nStart immediately (e.g., the next day), unless there are extenuating circumstances to be resolved (e.g., transportation)\n\nInclude an end date within one year from the current IEP meeting. This does not mean that the services stop, however. The end date is often planned for the student’s annual review, so the services would be updated according to decisions made at that future meeting.\n\nWhen determining the student’s services, IDEA also requires that the student’s IEP team consider the following special factors and address any that are relevant.\n\nThe use of positive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS) if the student’s behaviors impede her learning or the learning of others\n\nx\n\npositive behavioral interventions and supports (PBIS)\n\nA three-tiered framework (i.e., primary, secondary, tertiary) that provides a continuum of supports and services designed to promote appropriate behaviors and to prevent and address challenging behaviors.\n\nThe language needs of the student if she has limited English proficiency\n\nIf the student is blind or has a visual disability, provide for instruction in and use of braille, unless the team determines after evaluation that braille is not appropriate\n\nThe student’s communication needs, and when the student is deaf or hard of hearing, the student’s opportunities to communicate directly with peers and teachers as well as to receive direct instruction in his or her language and communication mode.\n\nWhether a student needs assistive technology devices and services\n\nEndrew Implications for Determining Special Education Services\n\nThe student at the center of the Endrew case, Drew, had significant behavioral challenges, yet he made progress in the private school, which developed a behavioral intervention plan (BIP). His success points to two key considerations for IEP teams when they begin to determine special education services and supports:\n\nThe services should address all of the student’s needs\n\nThe services should include evidence-based practices whenever possible.\n\nServices To Address Behavior\n\nIt should come as no surprise that when Drew’s behavioral challenges were addressed at the private school his academics improved. When any student has a history of problem behavior, or if such behaviors can be readily anticipated, the student’s IEP must address that behavior. This requirement applies to all students who receive special education services, regardless of their disability category. IDEA requires that if a student with disabilities exhibits problem behaviors that impede her learning or the learning of others, the student’s IEP team shall consider the use of PBIS.\n\nAn IEP that does not address behavioral challenges may fail to provide FAPE to a student with behavior problems. Litigation has clarified that FAPE is denied when schools and/or IEP teams fail to:\n\nConsider the inclusion of PBIS in response to the student’s behavior\n\nSchedule an IEP meeting to review the IEP to address behavioral concerns after a reasonable parental request or school-based personnel become aware of problem behaviors\n\nDiscuss concerns of parents or school personnel about the student’s behavior and its effects on the student’s learning during an IEP meeting\n\nImplement the behavior supports in the student’s IEP. The student’s FAPE can also be jeopardized when behavioral supports that are not included in the IEP or that are not appropriate for the student are implemented.\n\nServices Based on Peer-Reviewed Research\n\nAnother consideration when determining services and supports for students with disabilities is to use evidence-based practices. The term evidence-based practice is used currently to refer to instructional techniques and interventions that meet peer-reviewed standards. However, there are other terms that refer to less-stringent requirements, and educators should be aware of the differences. To help clarify the terminology, the table below highlights some common terms you may encounter when searching for an EBP.\n\nEvidence-Based Practice\n\nShown to have a positive effect on student outcomes\n\nThe research design allows one to infer that the practice led to child or student improvement\n\nMultiple high-quality studies have been conducted\n\nReviewed by a reputable organization (e.g., What Works Clearinghouse)\n\nPromising Practice\n\nShown to have positive effects on learner outcomes\n\nThe research design does not clearly demonstrate that the practice led to child or student improvement\n\nInsufficient number of studies conducted to demonstrate its effectiveness\n\nResearch-Based Practice\n\nSome research studies have demonstrated positive effects on student outcomes while other studies have not\n\nBased on research that may or may not clearly demonstrate that the practice led to improved child or student outcomes\n\nMultiple studies have been conducted\n\nEmerging Practice\n\nAnecdotal evidence of effectiveness\n\nResearch has not been conducted\n\nIDEA requires that a student’s services and supports be based on peer-reviewed research (i.e., evidence-based practices) “to the extent practicable.” However, due to inherent difficulties posed by research, limited time, and lack of funding, not all educational practices and programs have been subjected to rigorous research. In the first interview below, Bryan Cook explains valid reasons for why some practices may not be evidence-based. In the second interview, he discusses the differences between evidence-based practices and promising practices and how to prioritize their use."
