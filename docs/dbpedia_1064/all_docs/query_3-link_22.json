        "text": "With the technology for visually impaired available today, we can envision an exciting future of education for both visually impaired and blind people. Here’s three great reasons to get excited:\n\nAccess: Technology gives blind students access to the same educational materials as sighted students. This means those students can utilize the same textbooks in audio format or braille for literacy, enrichment and more!\n\nEngagement: Technology for visually impaired students helps them to communicate with their teachers and peers. This helps students engage more effectively in the classroom.\n\nMobility: Assistive technology for visually impaired and blind students allows them to continue their specialized education at home. When assistive technology is mobile, education is mobile, too.\n\nAn example that encapsulates these three features is the BrailleNote Touch. This mobile device operates completely with a Braille keyboard. It has easy access to Google Docs, Dropbox, and KeyMail. Humanware designed it to help students take notes easily, research effectively, and communicate with their teachers.\n\nStill, the cost of assistive technology devices can feel defeating. But not all assistive technology for visually impaired and blind people comes in an isolated device. Rather, many of the tools are infused into hardware most of us use every day. When students know how to access those resources, they access tools that progress their education forward.\n\nAnother example, Voiceover and Talkback are the IOS and Android versions of an audible keyboard for your smart phone which are automatically installed. They both assist in navigating messages, apps, phone calls, and more. There are also applications you can download on your phone for typing accessibility.\n\nBrailleTouch is an app, designed at Georgia Tech, which gives the Braille keyboard a place on the smart phone screen. All these resources in assistive technology for visually impaired and blind people can be catalytic in obtaining a quality education.\n\nHowever, if using the newest technology sounds overwhelming, you are not alone. Navigating devices in an ever-changing world of tech is complicated. At Braille Institute, we offer technology education to make it simple. Our team has developed easy training programs to help you leverage the digital landscape one step at a time. We offer free online classes on all the latest assistive technology as we long to ensure you are getting the most out of your magnifiers, iPad, JAWS, or Android devices, etc. Don’t hesitate to contact us and meet with one of our experts during an online workshop or class, or via a one-on-one phone consultation. We are here to help you utilize the latest technology and get the best education possible.\n\nIn addition to online appointments with Technology Specialists, Braille Institute offers a variety of programs and services for visually impaired and blind people including Independent Living Skills classes, Orientation & Mobility training, Library services for audio and braille books, and much more.\n\nTo learn more, or to schedule a FREE one-on-one appointment with one of our Low Vision Specialists, call 1-800-BRAILLE (272-4553).\n\nOne-on-one consultations, classes and workshops are offered virtually at present so that you can get support and participate from the comfort and safety of your own home by either computer or phone."
