        "text": "Guest blog written by Keith Couperthwaite (a Youth Advisory Council member)\n\nWorld Braille Day, celebrated since 2019, is observed to raise awareness of the importance of Braille as a means of communication in the full realization of the human rights of blind and partially sighted people.\n\nMy brother, Malcolm, was born with Septo Optic Dysplasia, which affects the nerve connecting his eye to his brain. He is legally blind, and we are not quite sure how much he can actually see.\n\nWhen I think about my brother being blind, sometimes it makes me sad. I wish he were able to experience the world in the same way I can. Sometimes I worry about how the world will accept him with his disability. Will he get bullied in school? Will he miss out on certain things? Will he have a hard time getting a job?\n\nBeing blind has heightened his other senses incredibly, especially touch. He loves touching soft blankets, my dad’s beard and our dog, Zoey. Malcolm really benefits from having sensory toys that can help him get a better understanding of the world.\n\nHe is still too young to understand braille; however, my parents have a few braille books. He loves feeling the textures in his books as we read along – he is making a connection. My family and I get happy when we see things being adapted with braille (i.e. business cards, playgrounds, signs, etc.). I think it’s important that everyone has the opportunity to access the world.\n\nEven though he is blind, he is one of the happiest little kids I know. He is learning to adapt to the challenges that he has faced, and it’s not stopping him from enjoying life. His life is just unique, and that’s okay."
