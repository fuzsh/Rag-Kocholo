        "text": "Exemplar organisation using its power to do something magnificent. This is why we need to drive fear out of the workplace and bring out the best in people. Imagine all the latent creativity, intelligence and genius that represents a different kind of wealth. It's a beautiful thing that this kind of values based product will be commonplace for our children. It's also nice to think we can be a part of the generation that makes this transition. How can your product or service respect and strengthen humanity?\n\n❤️ Fantastic to see this product hit the market after being available exclusively through The LEGO Foundation for a couple of years. LEGO Braille Bricks will open up a whole new world of creativity and learning for both sighted and visually impaired children/adults. And now everyone can join in 🙂. I'd imagine that for many young people with visual impairments, this may be their entry point for learning braille, and what a fun way to do it. 🔗 There's even a dedicated resource with games and learning activities https://lnkd.in/e8usrzQ4 👏 the LEGO Group again have shown how their products can bring people together through play. \"Play has the power to change lives; when children play, they learn vital life-long skills...\" states Rasmus Buch Løgstrup, LEGO's Lead Designer for their Braille Bricks – I couldn't have put it better myself. 💡 Bonus: A growing number of LEGO kits are becoming available with building instructions in audio or text format for braille readers through a dedicated LEGO Audio & Braille Building portal 🔗 https://lnkd.in/et_hhc84 #InclusiveDesign #BlindnessAwarenessMonth #ProductDesign #accessibility #ToyDesign #lego #braille\n\nThis morning, I happened to see that Lego have a “Play with Braille” lego set, aimed at helping kids with visual impairment learn and practice Braille. As a side-effect, being so interactive the family around will also have an opportunity to learn, and the real magic is the tactile nature of this learning that can’t be accomplished with digital apps. I am inspired by Kate Hughes‘ recent post on graduate interview processes for folks with visual impairment, and wondered how more corporate leaders could be made aware of the challenges folks live with every day, and it occurred to me that in an increasingly digital world, the tactile reading barrier may still play a small part. Unfortunately, Braille “displays” are many thousands of dollars, and despite many advances in technology, prices are still very high compared to traditional displays - obviously a lot more complexity with moving parts etc. I have no first-hand experience with how those one-line displays parse todays complex web front-ends, or how good the supporting software is. With all the research into LED pixel displays and so on, it would be truly great to see someone pioneer a braille character (like the old 7-segment displays we used to use in school electronics projects) and make this an open-source, open-hardware device, maybe kick-starting some faster innovation in this area… In the meantime, the Lego kit is itself a little pricey - $150 AUD. https://lnkd.in/gDhgWcVa If anyone in my direct network has a child with visual impairment, and would like a kit and can’t afford one, please DM me, and I’ll arrange to get one sent to you. I’m buying one to learn with for myself and It’s a small step towards being more inclusive.\n\n✨✨Braille Lego Brick: Playing with inclusivity ✨✨ 🎉One of the greatest product innovations of this year is Lego’s new Braille Brick - a groundbreaking leap towards inclusivity. 🚂Combining the joy of tactile building with the power of Braille, this innovative product is set to redefine play for visually impaired children worldwide. 🌌The toy isn’t merely just a child’s play, it's a symbol of empowerment and inclusion. The Braille Lego Brick opens a world of possibilities for visually impaired children, fostering creativity and confidence as they engage in the universal language of fun, play and learning. 💰And guess what, it’s proving to be commerically sweet as well. Initial market response has been overwhelmingly positive, with a 30% increase in pre-orders compared to previous Lego releases. According to Lego’s lead designer, the company is “inundated with thousands of requests to make the bricks more widely available”. 🙌Lego has not only garnered praise from consumers but has also elevated the company's reputation as a socially responsible brand. Share prices have seen a steady increase, reflecting investor confidence in Lego's ability to innovate with purpose. 👏The Braille Lego Brick isn't just a product; it's a testament to the transformative power of technology and empathy, proving that innovation can be both commercially successful and socially impactful. https://lnkd.in/dav-qyqt https://lnkd.in/dViFW8-f #productstories #redlemonmedia #whatstherant\n\nNeed to mark a 90° line but can’t find your try square? That’s the problem I just found myself facing. As always, it was LEGO to the rescue. And I’d be fairly sure to say that, given how well LEGO is made, this probably gives a more accurate 90° than most squares you can buy! —— Many people still see LEGO as “just a kids toy” but it’s so much more than that. So much more. With a open mind and willingness to experiment, it can be an incredibly powerful tool for thinking, communicating, reflecting, or even woodworking. And the list goes on. What’s the most non-toy thing you’ve used LEGO for? #LEGO #LegoSeriousPlay #Creativity #Coaching #Training #Facilitation #ThinkDifferently\n\nTo play or not play Got myself a mini X-wing Lego set on a whimp (well, more like two. Gave one away to a student). Interestingly, life dilemmas always have a way of wriggling themselves into seemingly straightforward scenarios. In this case, the particular Lego set turns out to be a commemorative set for the 40th anniversary of the Return of the Jedi. I am pretty sure I keep it for another 20 years in its original packaging, it will become a fine collectible. But what is the point of that if I don't get to play with it? After all these years of being an engineer, there is an understanding that the most expensive equipment is the idle equipment. If I don't open the packaging and assemble the X-wing, it will become a very expensive purchase. #dilemma #lego"
