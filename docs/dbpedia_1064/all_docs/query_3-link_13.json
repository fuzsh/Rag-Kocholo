        "text": "Learning braille from a young age has important benefits for children with vision impairment. It can help with literacy, as braille is a much better way to understand punctuation, grammar and spelling than audio.\n\nAt RNIB, our transcription service helps people who have lost their sight to continue reading by transcribing books and other printed materials into braille and other accessible formats (like audio and print with larger font sizes). Readers can also access more than 11,000 books in braille through the RNIB Library for free.\n\nCelebrate braille by going all dotty for a good cause. By holding a Dots Raise Lots event, you’ll be raising funds which can support our braille and reading services. Register today to give the gift of reading to thousands of blind and partially sighted children and adults and help spread awareness about the marvel of braille.\n\nIntroducing braille\n\nOur range of fun and exciting introductory courses have been designed to help young children learn to read through braille.\n\nBraille through the years: past, present and future\n\nBraille is a unique tactile writing system of raised dots that blind and partially sighted people can read by touch. It was pioneered by a young Frenchman in the nineteenth century, called Louis Braille, and since then the ability to understand braille means that people with sight loss have the same access to written word as sighted people.\n\nWe're open 8am – 8pm on weekdays and 9am – 1pm on Saturdays\n\nEmail us at [email protected] or say: \"Alexa, call RNIB Helpline\""
