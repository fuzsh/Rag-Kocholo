If you require special access, contact the clerk’s office ahead of time to make sure your voting site is free of obstruction. If your precinct is not accessible, the clerk will direct you to a nearby site that is accessible.\n\n2. If you require voting assistance, ask the election workers for help; a reason for the needed assistance does not have to be stated. Two inspectors will assist you in the voting station.\n\n3. An elector who is blind, disabled, or unable to read or write may be assisted with his or her ballot by any person of the voter’s choice, except the following: the voter’s employer or agent of that employer, or an officer or agent of a union to which the voter belongs.\n\nFor more information, contact the City Clerk's Office at 517-264-4866 or 517-264-4833.\n\nVoter Assist Terminal\n\nAll states are required to provide voting equipment which permits residents with disabilities to vote a secret ballot without assistance.\n\nAll Michigan polling places are equipped with at least one Voter Assist Terminal (VAT).\n\nThe VAT machine is placed on a table with a privacy screen around the monitor to ensure the secrecy of the ballot.\n\nThe machine is equipped with a touch screen to select your choices.\n\nAlso provided is an audio version with headphone’s to use with a hand held controller with Braille features for the disabled.\n\nThere is also a printer attached to print the ballot.\n\nOnce voted the ballot is printed and should be returned to the correct precinct to be placed through the tabulator.\n\nThe Voter Assist Terminal does not count votes. Its primary use is to assist in the voting process to make sure everyone has the opportunity to vote.\n\nAnyone may use the Voter Assist Terminal to vote.\n\nVoting Precinct Map"
