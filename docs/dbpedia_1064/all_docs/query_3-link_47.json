        "text": "Family Support Specialists are found in many places:\n\nFamily network organizations,\n\nCrisis teams,\n\nHospital emergency rooms,\n\nResidential treatment facilities,\n\nOutpatient clinics and\n\nSome specialized clinics/health services.\n\nThe Oregon Health Plan (Medicaid) has funded peer delivered services provided by Family Support Specialists and Youth Support Specialists since July 2013. Coordinated care organization (CCO) members can contact their CCO to learn how to access local Family Support Specialists.\n\nOHA provides funding for counties to deliver these services to families who do not have Medicaid.\n\nSome private/commercial insurance plans offer coverage for Family Support Specialist services.\n\nEach county or region may offer Family Support Specialist services through different organizations, including family organizations such as the Oregon Family Support Network. To find your local Family Support Specialist contact, visit www.reachoutoregon.org.\n\nFunded by OHA, ​Reach Out Oregon, a part of the Oregon Family Support Network, has a \"warm line\" at 833-732-2467 for parents, families and caregivers. It also has a website and a chat room.\n\nFamily Support Specialists with special training and practical experience parenting their own children, youth or young adults answer the warmline and chat room. For issues related to mental health disorders, substance use and the complexities of physical health, they provide:\n\nInformation about community-based and statewide resources.\n\nNational and other information about parenting, behavioral health concerns and conditions, treatment and parent-to-parent connection.\n\nSupport, hope and help to make getting care as simple, meaningful and responsive as possible.\n\nTo access these services, visit www.reachoutoregon.org or call 833-732-2467.\n\nYou have many ways to share your concerns about the Oregon Health Plan. You can share concerns about the services you get through OHP. You can also share concerns about not being able to access the services you need through OHP.\n\n​If you are a coordinated care organization (CCO) member, talk to your CCO.\n\nYou can file a complaint or appeal with your CCO. If you are not in a CCO, you can file a complaint with OHP.\n\nIf you do not feel comfortable filing a complaint or appeal, you can contact OHA's Ombuds Program. They will listen to what happened and help make a change. They can do this without using your name or just make sure the solution gets made.\n\nIf you are not on the Oregon Health Plan, here are other contacts for sharing concerns about your experiences accessing appropriate care.\n\nReporting your concerns helps OHA and our partner agencies work together to improve Oregon's system of care.\n\nTo report abuse or neglect call 855-503-SAFE (7233).\n\nTo report concerns to Child Protective Services (child welfare): Call 503-945-6904 or 800-442-5238 or email dhs.info@odhs.oregon.gov.\n\nTo report concerns about foster homes and residential facilities for adults and children with Intellectual and/or Developmental Disabilities: Call Toni Larson at 503-373-0852 or 844-674-4567 or email RFO.info@oregon.gov.\n\nTo file a complaint about a health care facility, visit the Public Health Division website.\n\nTo file a complaint about a private or commercial insurance issue, call 888-877-4894 or visit the Department of Consumer and Business Services website.\n\nTo file a complaint about any aspect of Oregon's mental health and addiction services treatment system, submit OHA's complaint form."
