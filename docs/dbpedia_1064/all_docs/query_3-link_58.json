Although the test can be taken by anyone, it is intended primarily for teachers, future teachers, and other professionals whose responsibilities include teaching or producing braille. Individuals who are interested in applying for NCUEB certification are strongly encouraged to familiarize themselves with all of the information included here.\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhy Is the NCUEB Important?\n\nIf you currently hold a degree in working with either blind adults or children, you have met the curriculum requirements of a specific university. However, each professional preparation program establishes its own criteria for braille competency. By adding the designation of NCUEB certification administered by a nationally recognized credentialing organization, you will unequivocally demonstrate that you possess knowledge and skill in the use of the braille code beyond the rudimentary level. This is especially true given that most professionals in the field were trained prior to the adoption of UEB and therefore certification is even more important to demonstrate professional qualifications in reading and writing of the braille code.\n\nBack to Top\n\nWhy Become Certified?\n\nThere are a number of professions that have certification as a part of distinguishing individuals as possessing a standard of expertise. Physicians and teachers are just two examples. The existence of certifications developed in these professions is indicative proof of the need to meet specific standards that are uniformly applied to those engaging in specialized fields. The goal of the NCUEB, as any other certification process, is to:\n\nRecognize that a uniform national standard set by professionals in the field has been met.\n\nAssure employers, school administrators, colleagues, consumers, families, and other professionals that certificants possess updated and appropriate braille knowledge and skills.\n\nEnhance professional credibility.\n\nContribute to a higher degree of job satisfaction.\n\nProvide an opportunity for professional development.\n\nPrepare professionals and paraprofessionals to meet current and future needs.\n\nProvide essential information necessary for consumers to make informed choices.\n\nBack to Top\n\nMaterial Covered in the Exam\n\nThe NCUEB covers contracted literary braille as described in the Rules of Unified English Braille, 2nd Edition, 2013 and is available from the International Council on English Braille (ICEB). During the exam, test takers will be provided with the only reference material allowed. The examination consists of three sections:\n\nBraille Writing: using a braillewriter\n\nProofreading: identifying embedded errors\n\nMultiple Choice: answering questions about correct braille usage and rules\n\nBack to Top\n\nEligibility\n\nThere are no prerequisites for taking the NCUEB exam. However, it is presumed that test takers have received adequate preparation in learning to read and write the Unified English Braille code.\n\nBack to Top\n\nRegistration Process\n\nIndividuals wishing to demonstrate their proficiency in the Unified English Braille code must register and submit appropriate fees. After your registration has been processed, you will be contacted to confirm testing date, time, location, and any other relevant information related to taking the exam.
