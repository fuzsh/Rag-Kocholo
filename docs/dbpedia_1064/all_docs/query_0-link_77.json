        "text": "Welcome to Braille Books Acquired. This quarterly newsletter contains a list of Braille books recently acquired by the Centre for Equitable Library Access (CELA).\n\nIn this issue:\n\nAnnouncements\n\nUncontracted braille / fiction and non-fiction for children\n\nFiction printbraille\n\nNon-fiction printbraille\n\nFiction for children\n\nFiction for young adults\n\nNon-fiction for children and young adults\n\nFiction for adults\n\nNon-fiction for adults\n\nAnnouncements\n\nAlthough the majority of these books have been published within the last 5 years, there may be some books listed here which are older, but which were only recently added to our collection. To make this clearer for you, we include the date of the print version of each book at the end of its annotation.\n\nLetter from CELA’s Executive Director Laurie Davidson\n\nSigns of spring are everywhere! Spring seems to bring a renewed energy which is welcomed as we look ahead to a busy season for CELA.\n\nI am excited about the progress of our Expanded Delivery Options Project. We are nearing the end of the evaluation of the Envoy Connect, a low cost audiobook player, with our pilot participants. We have been receiving lots of valuable feedback from the participants and this will help us shape our plans for offering this option in the future. In addition, we are getting very close to piloting our new voice assistant (smart speaker) option. This will begin in April and we are eager to get feedback from the pilot participants. I want to offer my thanks to the dedicated Expanded Delivery Options Team who have done a fabulous job testing the new options and supporting our participants over the past few months.\n\nIn addition, CELA is beginning a strategic plan ‘refresh’ to chart our path forward until March 2024. We had initially planned to do a fulsome strategic planning process in 2021 to replace our previous strategic plan which had set our goals for 2017-2021. Our plans changed however with the impacts of the pandemic and ongoing uncertainty around our federal funding. The CELA Board felt that it made more sense to do a smaller, more focused ‘refresh’ that would bridge our current strategic plan for another two years with the intent of doing a full strategic planning process later, for 2024 and beyond. Our modest, more focused process will include small group discussions with our key stakeholders. With that in mind, in April and May, we will be seeking feedback on our strategic priorities from representatives of member libraries and patrons through our committees and user groups. We hope to have the refreshed document finalized by June 2022.\n\nAlongside these large projects, we continue to be busy with the daily work. New books from NLS and other suppliers are continually added to our collection.\n\nFinally, we are excited to share that Manitoba is the most recent province to fund CELA services for all its libraries. We are looking forward to serving the people and libraries of Manitoba as they are onboarded over the coming months, and we thank the Manitoba government for its commitment to equitable library access.\n\nHappy reading!\n\nLaurie Davidson\n\nCELA Executive Director\n\nCanada Reads Winner announced\n\nCongratulations to Michelle Good, author of Five Little Indians, which won this year’s Canada Reads battle of the books. The story follows five young Indigenous friends as they are released from residential school and must navigate the world, and the trauma from their experiences. This debut novel also won other awards including the 2020 Governor General’s Literary Award for Fiction. Five Little Indians is available in human-transcribed braille through the CELA collection.\n\nHoliday Hours\n\nPlease note that CELA and our Contact Centre will be closed for the Victoria Day holiday Monday, May 23. We will reopen with regular hours on Tuesday, May 24.\n\nBraille Books Acquired is now available by e-mail. If you would like to receive it in this format, please get in touch with the CELA Contact Centre at 1-855-655-2273, or by e-mail at help@celalibrary.ca.

Spurred by the police killings and street protests of 2020, Williams realized he could offer a perspective distinct from the almost exclusively America-centric books on race topping the bestseller lists, because of one salient fact: he has lived in Trinidad (where he was never the only Black person in the room), in Canada (where he often was), and in the United States (where as a Black man from the Caribbean, he was a different kind of \"only\"). With these essays, Williams wants to reach a multi-racial audience of people who believe that civil conversation on even the most charged subjects is possible.

This quarterly newsletter contains a list of Braille books recently acquired by the Centre for Equitable Library Access (CELA).\n\nIn this issue:\n\nAnnouncements\n\nUncontracted braille / fiction and non-fiction for children\n\nFiction printbraille\n\nNon-fiction printbraille\n\nFiction for children\n\nFiction for young adults\n\nNon-fiction for children and young adults\n\nFiction for adults\n\nNon-fiction for adults\n\nAnnouncements\n\nAlthough the majority of these books have been published within the last 5 years, there may be some books listed here which are older, but which were only recently added to our collection. To make this clearer for you, we include the date of the print version of each book at the end of its annotation.\n\nLetter from CELA’s Executive Director Laurie Davidson\n\nSigns of spring are everywhere! Spring seems to bring a renewed energy which is welcomed as we look ahead to a busy season for CELA.\n\nI am excited about the progress of our Expanded Delivery Options Project. We are nearing the end of the evaluation of the Envoy Connect, a low cost audiobook player, with our pilot participants. We have been receiving lots of valuable feedback from the participants and this will help us shape our plans for offering this option in the future. In addition, we are getting very close to piloting our new voice assistant (smart speaker) option. This will begin in April and we are eager to get feedback from the pilot participants. I want to offer my thanks to the dedicated Expanded Delivery Options Team who have done a fabulous job testing the new options and supporting our participants over the past few months.\n\nIn addition, CELA is beginning a strategic plan ‘refresh’ to chart our path forward until March 2024. We had initially planned to do a fulsome strategic planning process in 2021 to replace our previous strategic plan which had set our goals for 2017-2021. Our plans changed however with the impacts of the pandemic and ongoing uncertainty around our federal funding. The CELA Board felt that it made more sense to do a smaller, more focused ‘refresh’ that would bridge our current strategic plan for another two years with the intent of doing a full strategic planning process later, for 2024 and beyond. Our modest, more focused process will include small group discussions with our key stakeholders. With that in mind, in April and May, we will be seeking feedback on our strategic priorities from representatives of member libraries and patrons through our committees and user groups. We hope to have the refreshed document finalized by June 2022.\n\nAlongside these large projects, we continue to be busy with the daily work. New books from NLS and other suppliers are continually added to our collection.\n\nFinally, we are excited to share that Manitoba is the most recent province to fund CELA services for all its libraries. We are looking forward to serving the people and libraries of Manitoba as they are onboarded over the coming months, and we thank the Manitoba government for its commitment to equitable library access.\n\nHappy reading!\n\nLaurie Davidson\n\nCELA Executive Director\n\nCanada Reads Winner announced\n\nCongratulations to Michelle Good, author of Five Little Indians, which won this year’s Canada Reads battle of the books. The story follows five young Indigenous friends as they are released from residential school and must navigate the world, and the trauma from their experiences. This debut novel also won other awards including the 2020 Governor General’s Literary Award for Fiction. Five Little Indians is available in human-transcribed braille through the CELA collection.\n\nHoliday Hours\n\nPlease note that CELA and our Contact Centre will be closed for the Victoria Day holiday Monday, May 23.

What begins as a series of apparent terrorist attacks is revealed to be the beginning of an international chess game involving the volatile and Byzantine politics of Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Iran; the race to develop nuclear weapons in the region; the Russian mob; a burgeoning rogue terrorist organization; and an American government set back on its heels in the international arena. As the horrifying scale of the threat becomes clear, Secretary Adams and her team realize it has been carefully planned to take advantage of four years of an American government out of touch with international affairs, out of practice with diplomacy, and out of power in the places where it counts the most. 2021.\n\nWorld War II\n\n4404590 Traitors of Camp 133 by Wayne Arthurson\n\n5 volumes.

Ian Williams brings fresh eyes and new insights to today's urgent conversation on race and racism in startling, illuminating essays that grow out of his own experience as a Black man moving through the world. Spurred by the police killings and street protests of 2020, Williams realized he could offer a perspective distinct from the almost exclusively America-centric books on race topping the bestseller lists, because of one salient fact: he has lived in Trinidad (where he was never the only Black person in the room), in Canada (where he often was), and in the United States (where as a Black man from the Caribbean, he was a different kind of \"only\"). With these essays, Williams wants to reach a multi-racial audience of people who believe that civil conversation on even the most charged subjects is possible.
