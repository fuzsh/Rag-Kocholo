These lessons are designed to give families and other individuals who are sighted an understanding of braille, but not proficiency. Find out about other options to learn braille.\n\nImagine the joy on a child’s face when she reaches in her lunchbox and finds a note from her Dad or the delight on a boy’s face when he reads a birthday card from his 4th grade teacher. The “Dots for Families” braille lessons give those who are sighted the opportunity to learn some of the Unified English Braille (UEB) code so they can share in the joy of reading and writing with children.\n\nLearning Enough Braille to Support Children Who Are Braille Readers\n\nMany family members, general education teachers, or paraprofessionals want an overview and to learn enough UEB to understand what a child is reading and writing. The “Dots for Families” braille lessons allow one to get a beginning knowledge of UEB by reviewing key points for each of the 15 lessons and then completing short reading and writing exercises. Not all contractions and rules are included in the 15 lessons, but those completing them will finish with a basic level of understanding of UEB. The final lesson provides information on Nemeth code and one can see basic math problems written in both codes.\n\nThe original lessons were developed in 2004 through work Dr. L. Penny Rosenblum did for the Arizona State Schools for the Deaf and Blind Parent Outreach Program for the Visually Impaired. Thirteen years later, Dr. Rosenblum has updated the lessons in UEB.\n\nYou can complete the lessons in 2 ways:\n\nOn your own: download the PDF of each lesson, read the key points and then complete the reading and writing exercises. Answer keys are provided.\n\nIn a group: an instructor can download the lessons (including .brf files to emboss the reading exercises and for writing exercise answer keys) and present these in a class setting.\n\nTo braille the writing exercises you will need a Perkins braille writer or Perky Duck (a free computer program that allows your computer keyboard to simulate a braille writer).\n\nFree Braille Lessons to Download (PDF)\n\nBraille Lesson 1: The first 10 letters (a-j)\n\nBraille Lesson 2: Letters k-z\n\nBraille Lesson 3: Capital Indicator and Punctuation\n\nBraille Lesson 4: Numeric Indicator and More Punctuation Marks\n\nBraille Lesson 5: Alphabetic Wordsigns\n\nBraille Lesson 6: Strong Contractions, including Dot 5 Initial-Letter Contractions\n\nBraille Lesson 7: Shortform Words\n\nBraille Lesson 8: Whole Word and Part-Word Contractions\n\nBraille Lesson 9: Dots 4-5 and 4-5-6 Contractions\n\nBraille Lesson 10: Additional Shortform Words\n\nBraille Lesson 11: More Shortform Words\n\nBraille Lesson 12: Groupsigns\n\nBraille Lesson 13: Lower Wordsigns and Lower Groupsigns\n\nBraille Lesson 14: Final Letter Groupsigns\n\nBraille Lesson 15: Mathematics — UEB and Nemeth\n\nBraille-Ready Format to Download (BRF)\n\nLesson 1:\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 2\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 3\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 4\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 5\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 6\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 7\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 8\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 9\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 10\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 11\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 12\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 13\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 14\n\nReading\n\nWriting Answer Key\n\nLesson 15\n\nReading – UEB Math\n\nReading – Nemeth\n\nWriting Answer Key – UEB Math\n\nWriting Answer Key – Nemeth\n\nUEB (Unified English Braille) Chart from Duxbury\n\nHere is a PDF of a complete list of the letters of the alphabet and contractions (short ways of writing words or parts of words).
