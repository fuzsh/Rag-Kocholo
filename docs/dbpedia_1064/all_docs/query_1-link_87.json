        "text": "News\n\nlifestyle\n\nspotlight\n\nJust braille is not enough, increase exam time\n\nThis story is from March 24, 2018\n\nJust braille is not enough, increase exam time\n\nThe Gujarat Secondary Education Board (GSEB) for the first time this year had introduced braille in the class X board examination. Here's how the initiative fared.\n\nBhole continuously taps the screen of his accessibility and talk back-activated phone dialer till the correct alphabet appears. He then dials the contact and queries the receiver on the other side whether the college and the university projects are supposed to be submitted together.\n\nBhole, who is visually-challenged, gave the board exam through a writer and passed out from the School for the Blind on the Ashram Road in Ahmedabad in 2014.\n\nBhole, who did his BA from HK Arts College and is currently pursuing MA in Hindi from MP Patel college, said, âBoard rules state that a writer should be a standard junior. He should not be from the same school as that of the candidate. Till 2014, the rule specified that those scoring above 65% cannot be writers. Now, even the percentage clause has been removed.â\n\nHe added, âStill, one has to submit the details of the writer to take the permission of the DEO. The copy of the document is then submitted to the authorities to appear in the examination.â\n\nIt is to be noted that it was for the first time this year that the state government has introduced question papers for its class X GSEB examination in braille. Ironically, there arenât many takers.\n\nâIntroduction of braille in boards is a laudable move, but braille takes a lot of time. Particularly, science and technology question paper needs more time than other subjects. A writer is a much better option for visually challenged board students as one has to write a lot in these exams,â said Bhole.\n\nKalpesh Parmar has been giving his exams at the School for the Blind in braille since playgroup but, appeared for the class X board this year with the help of a writer. He said, âWith braille I cannot finish the paper in three hours. First, I will have to read the questions in braille, and then write the answers as well. To give it properly, I at least need six hours. Thus, I have opted for a writer.â\n\nParmar, whose examination centre is Mount Carmel High School, said, âEverybody including our teachers and examination authorities advised us to take the help of a writer as with braille it becomes very tough to finish the question paper in three hours. None of the eight students from my hostel are giving the exams in braille. We all have opted for writers.â\n\nNK Raval, Principal, School for the Blind, said, âThe board exam paper is of 100 marks. A specially-abled student, like deaf, mute or blind needs a minimum of 20 marks to pass. Ten blind students from our school are appearing for the class X board exam this year.â\n\nSitting in the lawn on the campus of the school established in 1908, and commonly known as the Deaf-Mutesâ Society, is its boysâ hostel warden Jayeshbhai. Keeping a watch over a group of children playing in their uniforms, communicating with each other through hand gestures, Jayeshbhai, says, âI have been here for the past 12 years.â\n\nSharing his views, he says, âAs per an estimate, 13 out of 1,000 kids born in India are hearing or visually impaired, physically handicapped, mentally retarded, or have cerebral palsy, among others. Out of 600 boys and girls registered at this school- from playgroup to GSHSEB class XII board- 200 live in the hostel. We get funds and grants from the state government.â\n\nThere are various categories of visual impairment like mild, moderately severe, severe and profound. âThose who are in the mild and moderate category can write a bit at a slow speed. Exams for visually impaired students at this school are conducted in brailleâ¦,â Jayeshbhai says and pauses on seeing a kid. After conversing with him in the language he comprehends, Jayeshbhai says, âHe has recently enrolled in the hostel here. I am going to take him to a doctor now as he is having fever. Such children are in need of love. If you shower them with love, they can even give their life for you.â\n\nOn the significance of such institutions, he says, âSocial and personal development of such children gets a boost here as compared to living at home with others who are not like them.\n\nBachcha ghar me rehta hai to murjhata rehta hai.\n\n(Such kids wither at home). We, however, ensure to keep a record of their local guardians so that they can be informed in case of an emergency. However, awareness among normal people about the issues faced by specially-abled children is increasing now.â\n\nThere are several other institutions which are working for the development and rehabilitation of such people. These are the Blind People Association, Apang Manav Mandal, Samarpan Deaf Mute School - Motera, Umang Deaf Mute School and KS Dedhiya Deaf Mute School.\n\nEven the heritage MJ Libraryâs audio-visual section became the first one in India to have been conceptualized by the municipal corporation.\n\nHarsh Trivedi, in-charge, audio-visual section of the library, who has low vision, said, âIt was established by former mayor Asit Vora on March 23, 2013 with an aim to cater to the needs of visually impaired. At present, there are over 110 registered members at this section. Most of them are totally blind and some are visually impaired. The AMC passes special budget for this section.â\n\nHe added, âVisually impaired covers both totally blind and low vision. 60% blindness in visually impaired category means the person is 60% blind and can see 40%. To get a writer, or in professional language a âscribeâ, one should have more than 40% visual impairment certificate from the Civil Hospital. Some can opt to give the exam on their own.â\n\nHarsh Trivedi, who has low vision, did not go to a special school. He has been the in-charge of the audio-visual section at the MJ Library since its establishment.\n\nHarsh, who did not go to a special school in comparison with most others like him and, did his graduation from St Xavierâs college has been writing his own papers since childhood. âThose who donât have a very good speed have to go through a writer. Besides, braille is yet to be introduced in most of the competitive exams. GATE, NET, etc have been computerised but a 100% blind person cannot see the computer screen. He will have to keep a writer.â\n\nHe however advises that it is better if such kids learn braille. âWith braille, one feels independent and more confident. He can scribble important notes, write on his own. But, if one gives the exam in braille and not through a writer, one can miss out on the time as they are given only 20 to 30 minutes etc than normal students.â\n\nThere are certain rules fixing the qualification of a writer at state-level examination but at central level, there is no criteria, he informed. âThe scribe should be a degree or class lower than the blind candidate as per state government rules. At the central level, anyone can appear for the blind candidate. At times, it happens that a junior student can read something wrong and the blind answers according to that which might not be considered right by the examiner,â he added. âBut, things are improving now. Now, special computer software for the blind are also available,â he concluded.\n\nAs per the Disabilities Act 1995, those with not less than 40% disability should be provided job by the state government. It includes those with low vision, hearing difficulties, locomotor disability or cerebral palsy.\n\nBipin Modi, Librarian, MJ informed that several visually-challenged students at the audio section who prepared for their competitive exams by listening to audio books got placed with banks.\n\nWhen contacted, librarian Bipin Modi, said, âThis year, Rs10.76 crore have been sanctioned by the AMC for the MJ Library. Out of it, Rs3 lakh is for the audio-visual section. Five to six members of the audio-visual section here, who prepared for their competitive examination by listening to the CDs and DVDs have been selected for various jobs including banks. We have more than 2700 CDs and DVDs. It is the biggest public library of Gujarat. We have digitized over 2,000 books and posted them on our website with the help of Sabarmati Ashram.â\n\nHowever, as per mayor Gautam Shahâs budget speech, the AMC had sanctioned 11.36 crore. When contacted, Ahmedabad mayor, Gautam Shah, said, âWe have provided over 2,700 CDs and several head-phones to the audio-visual section of the MJ Library to help such students. We are planning to provide more advanced CDs to them. We want to ensure their development in a cordial atmosphere and are also planning to organize a cultural programme to boost their confidence this year. With an aim to boost morale of their teachers so that they keep working toward the social welfare, we ensured that they get a good pay. If we get suggestions, we will work on those to improve the experience of visually impaired.â\n\nMukti.jain@timesgroup.com\n\nEnd of Article\n\nFOLLOW US ON SOCIAL MEDIA\n\nVisual Stories\n\nRabindranath Tagore's timeless quotes on love and life that will touch your soul\n\nLifestyle\n\nStunning pictures of Madonna Sebastian\n\nEntertainment\n\nNidhi Shah's fashionable take on sarees\n\ntv\n\nMalaika Arora looks like a vision in a Swarovski beaded white saree\n\nLifestyle\n\nâ10 largest flowers in the world\n\nLifestyle\n\n8 things new parents are doing better than the older generation\n\nLifestyle\n\nâSreeleela dazzles with graceful charm in traditional splendourâ\n\nEntertainment\n\nâElli AvrRam shines as the ultimate beach babeâ\n\nEntertainment\n\nâJyothika like a diva in sparkling outfitsâ\n\nEntertainment"
