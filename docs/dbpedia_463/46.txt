After five seasons with the Boston Bruins organization, Oskar Steen will move on to Färjestad of the Swedish Hockey League, the team announced Saturday.

The forward started his career with Färjestad, a team that helped him transition to the NHL. Steen spent three seasons with the B's 2016-19 before heading to the Providence Bruins.

Steen wished to stay with the Bruins longer but opted to go back to his home.

“It feels fantastically fun. In some way, you have longed for this day, even if you might have hoped that you would manage to stay a little longer over there,” Steen said in a statement, via Google Translate. “But Färjestad is the team in my heart and I enjoy myself very well in Karlstad, so it feels incredibly good.”

The Karlstad, Sweden native mostly played in the AHL but played 60 games with the Bruins. In four seasons, he tallied eight points on four goals and four assists with 9:08 minutes of ice time per game in Boston.

In five seasons in Providence, Steen recorded 119 points in 230 regular-season and playoff games.

"During those years, I’ve gained a lot of experience, played with very good players and learned from players who are world-class. I’ve seen and learned a lot and feel really hungry to come back and show what I’m about," Steen said.
