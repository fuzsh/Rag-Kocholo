        "text": "As we have all surmised, the Bruins could use a top six right wing.\n\nBut obtaining one from outside the organization could be difficult. They’ve got approximately $12 million in cap space, but that should be chewed up by restricted free agents Charlie McAvoy, Brandon Carlo and Danton Heinen. A trade could be made but, given their cap situation, the B’s would have to send money out to bring money in, unless it’s a reclamation project like Jesse Puljujarvi, as Sportnet’s Elliotte Friedman speculated on Wednesday.\n\nBut the trade market otherwise could be an exercise in robbing Peter to pay Paul, if you will.\n\nSo, with the start of the B’s annual Development Camp on Wednesday, we have a dark horse candidate to nominate for the job. Meet Oskar Steen, a 5-foot-9 right shot forward with Martin St. Louis-like tree trunk legs who demonstrated in the Swedish Hockey League that he can score.\n\nIn 46 games in what is widely considered the third-best pro league in the world, the 21-year-old Steen finished second on his Farjestads BK Karlstad club with 17-20-37 totals, good for 10th in the league.\n\nThe plan for him is to play at AHL Providence this year, but no one is saying it has to be for the entire season.\n\n“I think his development has gone exactly how we had hoped,” said Jamie Langenbrunner, the B’s player development coordinator. “The transformation of his body has gone from him being a little boy a few years ago to a man now. His game this year, he was a very good player in that league. Top 10 in scoring. I think his competitiveness, his willingness to get inside of people will translate probably better here than playing on the big sheet over there. I think he’ll be a very effective player for us in Providence to start and then we’ll see how quickly he puts himself on the radar for (coach Bruce Cassidy) and the guys up here.”\n\nSteen expects to be groomed as a wing, but he played as a center in Sweden last year. His success there opened the B’s eyes to other possibilities.\n\n“I think he showed us this winter that he can play center. He’s been primarily a wing the whole way and this year they moved him to center and he was very effective. I think our plan for him now is to try him at both, see which is more comfortable,” Langenbrunner said. “In general, sub 5-11 guys have trouble playing the middle in the National Hockey League. There’s not a whole lot of them. But we’ll look at him there and on the wing. I think he’ll get a chance to play with more skilled guys if he’s playing on the wing with the way we’re built with (Jack) Studnicka) and (Trent Frederic). It’s probably going to work out that way, but he’s one of those guys who gives us versatility. I know Donnie (Sweeney) and Butch talk about it all the time. Two-position players are huge and we’ll continue to try and build that in his game.”\n\nSteen sounded eager for the next step of his career. And the success of Karson Kuhlman – albeit in a small sample size – has given him hope that he won’t be buried over here, as long as he produces.\n\n“Absolutely. I mentioned Karson Kuhlman and he was up there in the playoffs and I think I have a good chance,” Steen said..\n\nSteen has powerful legs, but if anyone had any questions about his height, he believes he answered them last season in Sweden.\n\n“It was a really good season, my best so far in Sweden. I had a lot of points and had a good role in the team, I played a lot of ice time,” Steen said.\n\n“I’ve played three years pro and I’ve met players who are very big, tall and strong, so that’s very good for my game. That’s a positive.”\n\nSteen is not concerned about his size.\n\n“I think the best defender in the playoffs was (Torey) Krug, so he’s very good on the ice even though he’s small. I don’t think that’s a big problem anymore,” he said.\n\nSo how does a second line of Jake DeBrusk-David Krejci-Oskar Steen grab you? Yes, we — and Steen — are a long way from that. It’s only June, the time of year to get ahead of ourselves. And it’s never too early to start tinkering with the depth chart."
