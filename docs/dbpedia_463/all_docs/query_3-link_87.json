        "text": "Welcome to the latest installment of the “Since 2000” series. We have ranked St. Louis Blues starting goalies, head coaches, first-round picks, and captains. But wait, how are these teams built? What are ways in which players can join a team? That is right. Players can be acquired via trade. In our latest installment, we are ranking the top-ten most influential Blues trades since 2000.\n\nToo Big For One Article\n\nJust like the film version of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, just like Wrestlemania, this particular rankings is too big for just one article. As such, we will rank six-ten this week. Next week, we will finish with the top-five.\n\nRanking the Trades: Criteria\n\nEvery Blues trade since the 1999-2000 season has been looked at to determine the most influential. This was by far the hardest “Since 2000” rankings. What made it difficult was comparing trades and deciding which was more influential than the other. The list of possible trades for this top-ten list had up to 18 trades that could be considered influential. In order to narrow the list down to ten, the following criteria was considered:\n\nWhat was the reason for the trade? Was it to become a contender? Was the team selling? Was it to shake up the roster?\n\nWere any stars brought in or traded away?\n\nWere the results of a trade a surprise for a positive or negative reason?\n\nDid the trade have effects lasting a few seasons?\n\nWithout further ado, here are the top-ten most influential Blues trades since 2000.\n\nThe Top-Ten Most Influential Blues Trades Since 2000: Part 1\n\nTrade #10 February 28, 2014\n\nThe Buffalo Sabres acquired goaltender Jaroslav Halak, forward Chris Stewart, forward William Carrier, a 2015 first-round pick, and a 2016 third-round pick.The Blues acquired goaltender Ryan Miller and forward Steve Ott.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe Blues were having a great season. The team was in contention for the Central Division title and the top seed in the Western Conference. Furthermore, the Blues were in the President’s Trophy race. The Blues were legitimate Stanley Cup contenders. The Blues brought in Miller hoping he would move the needle for the Blues. The acquisition of Ott also provided the Blues with a depth forward who could play gritty when needed. However, Miller struggled in the opening round of the Stanley Cup Playoffs. Miller had a save percentage of just .897. Furthermore, Miller gave up at least three goals in five of the six games. The Blues were eliminated, ending their hopes of the franchise’s first Stanley Cup.\n\nThere are multiple reasons why this trade makes the list. While it did not work out, the fact general manager Doug Armstrong was willing to make such a big trade for a contending team showed he was willing to do what it takes if a team is a true contender. We will see an example of this next week. Furthermore, the trade brought Ott to St. Louis, where he spent the next two seasons after coming over. After retiring, Ott has served the Blues as an assistant coach for the last eight seasons.\n\nTrade #9 July 23, 2021\n\nThe New York Rangers acquired forward Sammy Blais and a 2022 second-round pick. The Blues acquired forward Pavel Buchnevich.\n\nAnalysis\n\nDo you not love trades that work out so much better than you thought? When the Blues made this trade, it seemed more like a way to bring in someone with upside on the power play. The Blues got that and so much more. In 216 games with the Blues, Buchnevich has scored 83 goals, more than he scored in 301 games with the Rangers. Furthermore, Buchnevich has become an elite scorer in the league.\n\nThe Blues ensured Buchnevich will be part of the team’s core moving forward. Buchnevich agreed to a six-year extension earlier in the summer. This trade has become such a steal for the Blues. For Buchnevich to become the player that he is at the cost the Blues gave up to get him, this is by far one of Doug Armstrong’s best trades. The trade has paid dividends already, and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\n\nTrade #8 June 23, 2017\n\nThe Philadelphia Flyers acquired forward Jori Lehtera, a 2017 first-round pick, and a conditional 2018 first-round pick.The Blues acquired forward Brayden Schenn.\n\nAnalysis\n\nSpeaking of Armstrong steals, we have another one on this list. Do not worry, more will come. The Blues traded for Schenn to add some physicality in their lineup while also bring in someone to help the power play. Schenn had an immediate impact with the team, scoring 28 goals and being named an All-Star in the 2017-18 season. Playing primarily as the team’s top centre, Schenn helped lead the Blues to the 2019 Stanley Cup Final. In the Final, Schenn scored three goals. Furthermore, Schenn’s third goal was a third period goal in Game 7 that extended the Blues lead to 3-0. Whatever concerns the Blues had of losing the lead were erased by Schenn.\n\nIn addition to the offensive success Schenn has brought to the Blues, he has also brought leadership. The Blues rewarded Schenn for his leadership by naming him the team captain prior to the beginning of last season. Schenn has consistently found ways to score 20+ goals for the Blues. His talent and leadership has influenced the Blues greatly. The trade is a no-brainer to make the list.\n\nTrade #7 June 20, 1999\n\nThe Dallas Stars acquired a 1999 second-round pick. The Blues acquired goaltender Roman Turek.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe Blues have had many great goalies in their history. Glenn Hall, Curtis Joseph, Mike Liut, Jaroslav Halak, and Jordan Binnington are just some of the many names of goalies who have had great Blues and NHL careers. Even legends like Jacques Plante (who even won a Vezina Trophy with the Blues) and Martin Brodeur spent some time with the Blues. Turek is another one. Turek only spent two seasons with the Blues, but he made the most of them. In the 1999-2000 season, Turek went 42-15-9 with a 1.95 goals against average. Turek won the Jennings Trophy that season. Furthermore, the Blues won the President’s Trophy.\n\nIt may seem odd the Turek’s trade makes the list considering he only spent two seasons with the Blues. However, Turek was a key member of the only President’s Trophy in Blues history. The 1999-2000 season was one of the best in team history. While the team failed to win the Stanley Cup, the season is one to be celebrated and remembered. That season may not have happened without Turek, making the trade for him a worthy addition to this list.\n\nTrade #6 November 24, 2008\n\nThe Toronto Maple Leafs acquired forward Lee Stempniak. The Blues acquired forward Alexander Steen and defenceman Carlo Colaiacovo.\n\nAnalysis\n\nColaiacovo had some productive years with the Blues. However, this trade makes the list because of Steen. In 12 years with the Blues, Steen wore many hats. Steen scored more than 15 goals eight times. This includes a 33-goal season in the 2013-14 season. Even when Steen’s offensive production began to dip, he reinvented his career as a defensive forward. Steen become a fourth-line player in the 2018-19 season. Playing alongside Oskar Sundqvist and Ivan Barbashev, Steen helped shut down the top lines of the Blues opponents on their way to the Stanley Cup.\n\nSteen’s time with the Blues has continued in retirement. Earlier in the summer, the Blues announced that in two seasons, Steen will take over as team’s general manager. Like the Steve Ott trade mentioned above, the Steen continues to help the Blues, even off the ice. This trade may not have seemed like much at the time, but it has become one that has already had major influence with the team and will continue to do so moving forward. Steen is truly one of the best Blues of all-time.\n\nPart 1 Final Thoughts\n\nAre you not glad this was split into two articles? There is just so much information to digest in these trades. Moreover, a case could be made for some trades on this list swapping places, or even some being left off all together. As stated earlier, this has been the hardest ranking in this series.\n\nStay Tuned\n\nPart two of this ranking will come out next week. Think about trades we did not mention today. Will they appear in the top-five? Tune in next week to find out.\n\nMain Photo: Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports"
