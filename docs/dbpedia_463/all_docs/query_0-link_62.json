        "text": "Before there was hockey, there was skiing.\n\nBefore he was staring down a shot from Washington’s Alexander Ovechkin, he was staring down Sweden’s “Åre” mountain.\n\nBefore Oskar Sundqvist became known as one of the Blues’ hardest-working players, he was tagging along with his father, Anders, a former member of the Swedish national alpine team.\n\n“I’ve been skiing my whole life,” Sundqvist said. “It’s one of my favorite things to do. It makes you very happy — for me at least.”\n\nThe 27-year-old center might still be skiing today if he hadn’t been bitten by the hockey bug at an early age, too. It’s fortunate for the Blues, who got him back in the lineup Tuesday after missing the first month of the season recovering from knee and hip surgeries. He played just 14 shifts in 9:45 of ice time, but he’s back.\n\nThe team has its fearless forward, who can trace that personality trait back to his childhood, being on the top of the mountains in Sweden with only one way down.\n\n“I remember one time … my dad took us down an actual downhill ski slope and that was kind of scary,” Sundqvist said. “It was just ice all over and it was just straight down. He was laughing while we were almost crying.”\n\nAnders Sundqvist may not have credited his son much then, but he does now.\n\n“Oskar skied a lot, and actually, he had a lot of skills,” the elder Sundqvist said recently from Sweden. “He could move pretty well. I was a little bit impressed at that time.”\n\nHis confidence on the slopes didn’t develop overnight — much like his NHL career, which blossomed after a trade from Pittsburgh in 2017. He went largely undiscussed in the deal that sent Blues enforcer Ryan Reaves to the Penguins for a first-round pick, which the Blues used on Klim Kostin. But looking back today, taking into account the team’s record with and without him in the lineup, Sundqvist might have been the biggest piece of that package.\n\nEven NHL star Sidney Crosby sings his praises.\n\nAnders Sundqvist was on the national team in the late 1970s and early ’80s, competing at the World Cup level as well as in other international competitions.\n\n“It takes a lot of courage to handle it,” he said.\n\nHe retired from the sport when he was about 30 years old, got involved in “physical studies” and later became a coach. It was that environment in which Sundqvist grew up, watching his father push the skiers to be their best.\n\n“I always kind of got it from my dad, this mindset to never give up — it doesn’t matter what it is,” Sundqvist said. “Just being around that my whole life was very helpful.”\n\nThe other aspect of skiing that helped Sundqvist, who was well into youth hockey in Sweden, was the training similarities that it took to be successful in both.\n\n“It takes a lot of leg power, and the middle part of the belly, the muscles, both in skiing and hockey,” Anders Sundqvist said. “In Sweden, a lot of the hockey coaches, the physical coaches, work a lot with alpine skiers because it’s a similar kind of work with the legs, too. So we have a lot in common actually.”\n\nAnders Sundqvist was a proponent of his son playing as many sports as possible, so he got involved in soccer, too. And while neither were thinking about this at the time, soccer also had a tie-in to hockey that helped develop him.\n\n“Oskar was playing in the middle part of the field and he was pretty good at reading the game, what’s happening,” his dad said. “It was surprising to me, the knowledge where he was on the field and his teammates.\n\n“He learned a lot (about) where the positions are, so he can read the angles. One of the coaches was talking a lot about those things when he was playing soccer — you play the ball in the triangle and move like that.”\n\nBut what really pushed Sundqvist toward the ice happened around 2006, when his father stepped away from skiing to work as a club director on the finance side for Lulea HF of the Swedish Elite League.\n\nHe went to nearly every home game and hung out in the locker room.\n\n“It was a cool experience,” Sundqvist said. “The atmosphere got me more interested in playing hockey and getting to that level.”\n\nHe looked up to the players, including one in particular — Lubos Bartecko, who had previously spent five seasons in the NHL, including three with the Blues (1998-2001).\n\n“He was their biggest star,” Sundqvist said. “It was cool to see him live. I don’t think I ever talked to him or anything because I was probably too nervous. But it was just cool to see him on the ice because, in Sweden, he was probably one of the smartest players in the league.”\n\nAnders could see his son’s mind taking shape.\n\n“It was quite unbelievable,” he said. “Something was blowing up in his mind when he was in the locker room.”\n\nStill, Sundqvist was far from being an NHL prospect and didn’t think he’d be drafted — until it actually happened.\n\n“I didn’t want to have my hopes too high,” he said. “I was just trying to do my best every day, and work my ass off and see where it takes me.”\n\nThe Blues were considering taking Sundqvist with their third-round pick (No. 87 overall), but Pittsburgh grabbed him six spots earlier. The Blues wound up with defenseman Colton Parayko when their turn came around.\n\n“That’s pretty cool,” said Sundqvist, who wasn’t aware of the fact. “(Parayko) is one of my best friends today, so it’s good to be on the same team as him. I wouldn’t want to block a shot against him, I’ll tell you that much.”\n\nThree years after being drafted, Sundqvist started out with the Penguins in 2015-16. He played most of the 2016-17 season in the American Hockey League, playing just 10 games with the Pens. He had no points through those 10 games in the NHL but was told by the organization in his exit meeting that they liked him. Shortly after that, though, they traded him to St. Louis.\n\n“I was kind of disappointed that they gave up on me, after my meeting with all the praises that they were believing in me,” Sundqvist said. “But it turned out, the trade was the best thing that would happen for my own sake.”\n\nIt didn’t seem that way, though, at the start of Sundqvist’s career in St. Louis. In his first season with the Blues, he had just one goal and five points in 42 games. And his defense wasn’t much better at five-on-five, as he was on the ice for just eight goals for and 13 against.\n\nEven though Sundqvist was making a limited salary of $675,000 in 2017-18, it was questionable whether he’d even be part of the team’s plans in 2018-19. But the Blues brought him back, and in the 11th game of the season, he netted two goals against Marc-Andre Fleury in a 5-3 victory over Vegas on Nov. 1, 2018.\n\n“They were two goals that maybe I don’t usually score — one from my knees and one going high glove on Fleury,” Sundqvist said. “It was that feeling that I can score goals that are maybe not greasy goals — I can actually shoot the puck in the net — that helped my confidence level.”\n\nHere’s the second of Sundqvist’s two goals, which handed the Blues a 3-2 lead in the second period:\n\nHe says he’s been riding a wave ever since that game.\n\n“I just started feeling that I can play at this level,” he said. “Before, it could be one mistake and the whole game would be ruined for me. But after that, I knew what my mindset needed to be, and I think that’s the part that gave me my success.”\n\nSundqvist netted 14 goals and 31 points in 74 games in the regular season, during which Crosby told Blues radio analyst Joey Vitale, who was teammates with Crosby in Pittsburgh, that the Penguins never should have traded him.\n\nHow did that make him feel?\n\n“That gives you a big boost in confidence,” Sundqvist said. “(Crosby) has been one of the best players for over a decade. I looked up to him a lot in Pittsburgh and tried to watch him because his all-around game is so good. So that was just another confidence thing that boosts you a lot.”\n\nSundqvist’s performance on the fourth line down the stretch was a strong factor in the Blues making the playoffs in 2019 and going on their Stanley Cup run. He remembered something linemate and fellow Swede Alexander Steen said that also elevated his game.\n\n“Steener is one of those guys, he knows when to boost you and when to tell you to sharpen up,” Sundqvist said. “He just grabbed me and said, ‘This is what they expect from us, and this is what we’re going to do, and we’re going to have a lot of fun doing it.'”\n\nThe Blues, of course, won the Cup, and Sundqvist followed up that season with 12 goals and 23 points in 57 games in 2019-20. Suddenly, he became the one who was drawing teammates into the battle.\n\n“I’m not the most vocal guy in the locker room, but I’m trying to lead the guys on the ice and show them the hard work, trying to get people to follow me,” Sundqvist said. “I just want to win at whatever price. I hate losing. I think everyone hates losing, but some guys maybe don’t do everything to win.\n\n“It’s been in my head to never give up — never give up on a loose puck or anything like that. I maybe don’t play the cleanest all the time. But it’s more just my mindset of winning at whatever price.”\n\nSundqvist was playing that greasy game for the Blues when they were in San Jose last March, and disaster struck. He was in front of the Sharks’ net when teammate Kyle Clifford inadvertently collided with him.\n\nSundqvist went directly to the Blues’ locker room, and a day later, an MRI exam revealed he had torn a knee ligament.\n\n“You’re kind of in a hole for the first couple of days, just thinking that everything sucks. But part of it is looking forward to the next step,” he said.\n\nSurgery was on April 6, and when it came to learning what to expect during the rehab process, Sundqvist only had to pick up the phone and call his dad. Anders had dealt with several knee injuries with other skiers throughout his career.\n\n“I was saying to my wife, ‘This is an ACL,'” his dad said, when watching the replay. “I know it’s hard coming back and it’s a lot of hard work. It’s really important that you can stretch the leg out 180 degrees like the other ones. You have to be exact with his training, what his doctors are saying. Don’t cut (time 0ff) your training and get to the next level too early.”\n\nThat wouldn’t be an issue for Sundqvist, though, because over the past few years he had also developed chronic hip pain. One began bothering him as far back as six or seven years, and the other just a few years. But because the Blues kept going deep in the playoffs, Sundqvist and the club decided to just keep rehabbing his hips, as opposed to offseason surgery, so he’d be ready for the following year.\n\nHowever, with knee surgery knocking him out for the remainder of the 2020-21 season, and the 2021-22 campaign seven months away, they decided to knock out the hip surgeries about six weeks after the knee operation.\n\nThough Sundqvist knew he’d miss at least the first month of the season, the chance to clean up his hips was worth it.\n\n“I’m able to take a little bit longer strides,” he said. “They’ve been tight for so long, so I’ve barely had any motion. I just want to be able to move them around again.”\n\nAny more from Sundqvist is a bonus for the Blues. Since the 2018-19 season, they already have a points percentage better than .650 with him in the lineup and are a tad over .500 when he’s not playing. He’s aware of that statistic, but doesn’t think about it.\n\n“It’s a boost, but you aren’t too proud of it because you want your team to win every game with you or without you,” he said.\n\nBut make no mistake, Sundqvist leads the team with his fearlessness — the player who would rather stare down a blast from Ovechkin than a steep mountain.\n\n“It kind of stings, but luckily I haven’t broken anything from a blocked shot yet, so hopefully that continues,” he said.\n\n“I would say the opposite,” his dad said. “I’m a little bit impressed by my son blocking shots from those kind of guys. But I’m still amazed that my son is playing ice hockey now and not an alpine skier.”\n\n(Top photo: Richard A. Whittaker / Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)"
