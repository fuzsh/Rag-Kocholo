        "text": "Putting too much credence on what happened in the last regular-season game between two playoff-bound teams is usually a huge mistake. Those teams are usually resting their stars and what transpires on the scoreboard is often immaterial.\n\nBut there were some interesting takeaways in the Bruins’ last regular-season game in Washington against the Capitals. While the B’s played just a couple of regulars, the Caps suited up nearly all their high-end talent. And though Washington won in the final seconds on a fluke goal, it was hard not to be impressed by how the mostly-Providence Bruins competed that night.\n\nOskar Steen was a player who stood out. Steen did not come away with any points that night, but he saw 17:00 of ice time and, with his 5-foot-9, 188-pound fire hydrant physique, the forward simply looked like he belonged.\n\nWith the influx of veteran bottom-six forwards from the free-agent market, it may be hard for the 23-year-old Swede to crack the Boston roster, but the 2016 sixth-round pick could force a tough decision for management should he show up like he did in Washington last spring.\n\n“It was big for me to play up there in the NHL, a lot of good players to play against. It was a good experience for me, especially that last game, I played a lot of minutes so it was good for me,” said Steen on Thursday before the Bruins rookies headed to Buffalo for this weekend’s Prospects Challenge. “I think I played a good game and felt good on the ice.”\n\nSteen played his first full season in North America in 2019-20, notching 7-16-23 points in 60 games in Providence that year. In last year’s truncated AHL season, he had 5-6-11 totals in 23 games. Since coming over, he’s found an identity. In just three NHL games last year, he was credited with 11 hits.\n\n“Like a lot of guys who come (from Europe), and Oskar is no exception, it takes really a year to get familiar with the pace, the strength, the size. And the mindset,” said Providence coach Ryan Mougenel. “I always say it would be as if me and Chris Kelly went over to Sweden and we were dumping the puck in and chasing it down. They’d look at us kind of funny. They play differently. So it takes some time to get acclimated to how we play. The one thing about Steener is he’s a competitive, in your face, abrasive player. I think his identity is exactly what you saw in that Washington game. I think he has the ability to get under the opponents’ skin. He has the ability to get underneath and inside of opponents. I think that’s one of his biggest attributes. And he’s another guy who’s full of life. He’s a guy you want to be around. You’re always rooting for him. Not that you root against anybody, but he’s definitely a guy you root for, the (Anton Blidhs) and the Steeners, they’re very similar in that they understand what it means to be a great teammate. And again, that’s one of the staples of being a Bruin.\n\n“He’s well on his way. I think he’s going to be knocking on the door. He’s ready, he’s hungry, he’s got a taste of the NHL and he wants to stay there. It’s up to him now. That’s part of the deal. He’s put the work in, but now it’s up to them.”\n\nBeefed-up Studnicka a player to watch\n\nWhile he won’t be participating in the Prospects Challenge, center Jack Studnicka has opened eyes in captain’s practices and in various local venues over the summer with the muscle he’s added to his formerly spindly frame.\n\nIf Studnicka, considered the B’s best prospect until a step-back year last season, can take a regular shift in the middle six then it could open possibilities for the B’s to add elsewhere (more defense, anyone?). And with David Krejci having returned to the Czech Republic and Patrice Bergeron on the last year of his deal with an undecided future, the B’s desperately need another young centerman to pop.\n\nStudnicka at least appears to have taken care of what he can control.\n\n“You forget sometimes how young these guys are,” said Mougenel. “He comes out of junior and he’s playing 28, 29 minutes. He didn’t really have that ability during the season to get stronger. He was trying to keep his body healthy, he was playing in the World Juniors. He played a lot of hockey that first year. And this was a summer where he stayed in town. I’ve obviously spent a lot of time with Jack and I’m a big fan of Jack as the person. And I think the one thing about Jack is that he’s a hockey rat, which I love. He wants to get better. And just staying in town and making that commitment to get bigger and stronger has been great. And for him, it’s visible. I was shocked. I hadn’t seen him in a couple of weeks and he’s definitely put the work in. Will it translate to his game? I’m sure it will. Again, Jack is one of those players that’s knocking on the door. You forget how young he is. He’s still on his entry level deal. But he’s a special player and the one thing that comes out of it is he did what we wanted him to do, got bigger and stronger. Now it’s up to Jack. He’s going to get some opportunity here.”\n\nNational TV schedule out\n\nThe NHL released it’s national television schedule with its new broadcast partners and the B’s will make their TNT debut on Oct. 20 when they play in Philadelphia. Their first streamed game on ESPN-plus/Hulu is on Oct. 22 from Buffalo. Their first nationally televised ESPN game will be Jan. 6, when they host the Minnesota Wild. In all the B’s will be featured 13 times on the various national platforms."
