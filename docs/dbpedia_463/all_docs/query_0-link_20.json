        "text": "For Oskar Steen, the game was slowing down. The 85-foot-rinks that once felt stifling did not seem as claustrophobic. The 5-foot-9, 195-pound Steen was hardening to the punishment that AHL strongmen itch to deliver. The shift from right wing back to center gave the right-shot Steen a bit more time to apply his processing power.\n\nThen it all stopped.\n\nIt was already a challenging first North American season for Steen. The native of Karlstad, Sweden, was trying to rewire his brain, hands, legs and feet from the 100-foot-wide sheets they had once known. The natural center could not find traction on the right side. He was adjusting to life, language and culture in America.\n\nSteen was starting to figure things out. By March 11, Providence’s final game before the AHL suspended its season, Steen had seven goals and 16 assists in 60 appearances. He was lining up behind Jack Studnicka and Trent Frederic, his fellow centers-in-training.\n\n“There’s certainly a difference the last 15 games than there has been. I think you see that a lot with European players,” Providence coach Jay Leach said on March 4. “Steener’s a very detailed guy. Once he gets his details down, he can play. It’s taken him a little while to get his details down. It’s a completely different game over here, rink, the way we play compared to the way he played over there.”\n\nThe Bruins drafted Steen in the sixth round in 2016. On March 2, 2015, former general manager Peter Chiarelli traded the sixth-round selection to Colorado with Jordan Caron for Max Talbot and Paul Carey. Two months later, once Don Sweeney assumed command, the new GM reacquired the pick by giving Colorado the rights to negotiate with Carl Soderberg, a pending unrestricted free agent.\n\nSteen was coming off a very good 2018-19 season in the Swedish Elite League. He recorded 17 goals and 20 assists in 46 games for Farjestads BK Karlstad, making him the No. 10 scorer in the league.\n\nSuch production, combined with his speed, agility, tenacity and shot, made the Bruins wonder whether he could lend a hand at right wing in Boston once he acclimated to the AHL. His skill set was similar to that of Karson Kuhlman, who had laid down the template of a Providence-to-Boston progression last season.\n\nThe difference was that Kuhlman grew up on 85-foot-wide rinks. He enjoyed four years of prep work at Minnesota-Duluth, where he won an NCAA title in 2018. The 5-foot-11, 185-pound Kuhlman scored 12 goals and 18 assists in 58 games for Providence in 2018-19.\n\nAll of this optimized Kuhlman for an NHL promotion. Steen, in comparison, was playing from behind.\n\nThe rate of Steen’s development did not proceed rapidly enough for an NHL recall this season. But the skills that have, at times, advanced disparately show promise of clicking in a more simultaneous fashion as Steen banks more reps.\n\nIf that happens, Steen could develop into a No. 3 NHL center who could shoot, distribute the puck and jostle bigger bodies. In that way, Steen shares some qualities with Claude Giroux, the skilled and stocky Philadelphia captain.\n\n“He’s always shown a willingness to get inside and skate,” Leach said. “He’s a smaller guy in stature. But he’s got some heft to him. He plays that style. Now we’re starting to see him make some plays. He’s one of our go-to guys on the penalty kill as well. He’s coming too.”\n\nLike all prospects, Steen is anxious to proceed to the varsity. He has company. Studnicka and Frederic, ahead of Steen on the depth chart and in their development, were knocking on the Boston door.\n\n“That’s who they’re going against all the time,” Leach said of his three young centers’ older competition, citing opponents such as Hershey’s Philippe Maillet and Michael Sgarbossa, both 27 years old. “And they can handle it. They’ve done it all year. That does show something. We’re excited about it. I can’t say we’ve had that many younger centermen play the roles they’re playing.”\n\nNow, like everybody else, they must practice patience.\n\n(Photo: John Tlumacki/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)"
