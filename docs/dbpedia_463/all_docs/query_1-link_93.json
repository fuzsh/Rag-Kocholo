        "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. — Dustin Penner didn’t score enough when he was an Edmonton Oilers winger but he did leave the team with one big assist when he was traded to the Los Angeles Kings — a late first-round draft pick in 2011.\n\nThe Oilers used it to take Oscar Klefbom 19th overall after the falling out with big Penner, who isn’t seen in NHL rinks anymore. He’s only on Twitter (@DustinPenner25) where he has a rabid following of 106,000. While the irreverent Penner may be done at 32 after 589 games and Stanley Cup rings for two of his fingers, Klefbom is just beginning his journey, with 60 NHL games to his credit.\n\nAnd there may have been none better than the one Klefbom played in Chicago on Friday night, where he got 26:23 of ice time — just 14 fewer seconds than the Blackhawks’ estimable Duncan Keith — had seven shots on Chicago goalie Cory Crawford and four others that were blocked or went wide, and more than held his own against Jonathan Toews.\n\n————————————————————\n\nDownload latest Oilers podcast via iTunes\n\n————————————————————\n\nKlefbom got an ‘A’ on his report card against the two-time Stanley Cup champs.\n\nHe has barely scratched the surface of how good he can be — even at six-foot-three and 204 pounds he might not have developed enough yet to push people away or battle with the Alex Ovechkins — but right now Klefbom, only 21, is quite possibly the best defenceman the Oilers have.\n\nFormer Oilers assistant coach Steve Smith — who now works for the Carolina Hurricanes, Edmonton’s opponent Sunday afternoon — said Klefbom can be a shutdown defenceman for 15 years. All this from the 19th pick, in a draft when nobody much cared about anything except whether Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, the Oilers’ first choice, was going to be big enough to complement his superior skill-set.\n\nRight now, Klefbom is the safety net for Justin Schultz to do what he does best and get up ice on the attack, but maybe Klefbom and Darnell Nurse, when he’s ready, will become a pairing.\n\nOr maybe Klefbom will become something like his boyhood friend Jonas Brodin in Minnesota, but bigger. That would be just fine.\n\n“I absolutely see myself as a shutdown guy. It’s different when you’re playing with Justin (Schultz), he’s an offensive guy and I can play more defensive, but I actually see myself as more two-way. If I play with Mark Fayne, maybe I can be the guy who plays more offence. I think I can be Brodin (the Minnesota Wild complement for Ryan Suter),” said Klefbom.\n\nAll we know for sure is Klefbom is the best thing that has happened to the Oilers in another dark season, where they are working hard for interim head coach Todd Nelson but are still in 29th place in the league. The game against the Blackhawks was a solid barometer. This wasn’t the Buffalo Sabres was playing.\n\n——————————————————-\n\nBachman gets start Sunday vs. ‘Canes\n\n——————————————————-\n\nHe’s like the young colt who’s been let out of the barn. He’s going to run with this.\n\n“A really good game for Oscar. He could have had a couple of goals, where he came off the point and was fed in the prime scoring area,” said Nelson. “He was pretty dominant, strong in the corners. You can see how strong he is when he kills a cycle in the D zone. In puck battles, he usually comes out on the right side of them. Who knows what his potential is? He keeps getting better.”\n\nKlefbom relished the yardstick game against the Hawks, who are battling for home-ice advantage with the St. Louis Blues is a possible 2-3 Central Division playoff matchup.\n\n“Chicago has a couple of guys who are top guys (Toews, Patrick Kane when healthy) in the league and it’s very nice to see I can step up in games against the Hawks and have my best game,” said Klefbom. “Actually it’s lots of fun to play against Chicago.”\n\nAlso instructional, going against Toews.\n\n“He’s very smart on the ice. You always have to stay close to him because he can do the little extra … you can’t rush at him and try to take the puck. He’s too smart,” said Klefbom. “He’s very strong, even if he’s not that big (almost identical in size to Klefbom). You have to push him in the right spots.”\n\nUnder Dallas Eakins, Klefbom was an in-and-out D. He started the season in the minors because the Oilers felt he’d be better being the alpha dog in Oklahoma City. He was brought back Nov. 4, played twice, but sat for four and was sent back for five. He got another shot on Nov. 27, and but for two scratches on Dec. 14 (against the New York Rangers) and Dec. 16 (Arizona Coyotes), he’s played 34 in a row.\n\n“When Todd came up I felt I had nothing to prove. He knows what I’m capable because I played a lot for him in OKC,” said Klefbom, who has the trust of Nelson, and also Craig Ramsay, who looks after changing and schooling the defence.\n\nKlefbom was still shaking his head at how many chances he had against the Hawks. “Seven shots … I mean I should have been able to score once,” said Klefbom, who did rip one off Crawford’s glove and the iron. “For me, it was nice to create some offence, but it (no goals) was pretty frustrating.”\n\nHe had no problem playing 26-1/2 minutes. He could play 30 some night.\n\n“It felt great … the rhythm of the game is better when you’re out so many shifts,” he said.\n\njmatheson@edmontonjournal.com\n\nFollow me on Twitter: @NHLbyMatty\n\n——\n\nEdmonton Journal hockey writer Jim Matheson talks to sports editor Craig Ellingson about the play of the Edmonton Oilers’ call-ups from the American Hockey League farm and how the remainder of the 2014-15 NHL season is mostly an audition for them, and about the team’s need to secure a future No. 1 goaltender.\n\nDownload the latest Journal Oilers podcast via iTunes\n\nMobile users, use this link: soundcloud.com/edmonton-journal-sports/oilers-podcast-march-6-2015\n\nRecent podcasts from the Journal:\n\nOilers podcast: Jeff Petry trade and the future make-up of the blueline\n\nOilers podcast: Injuries, trades and free agents (who don’t want to play in Edmonton) … oh my!\n\nOilers podcast: Culture change brings more teamwork\n\nOilers podcast: Peering into the blueline future\n\nOilers road report: Recurring roadkill\n\nOilers podcast: Ongoing shuffles at the bottom\n\nArticle content\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nNotice for the Postmedia Network\n\nThis website uses cookies to personalize your content (including ads), and allows us to analyze our traffic.
