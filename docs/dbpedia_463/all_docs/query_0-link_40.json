        "text": "Just five days ago, André Petersson’s time with HV71 appeared to be over.\n\nAnd now? Well, it looks like he’ll be staying after all.\n\nHV71’s Sporting Director, Chris Abbott, announced in a video on their official website that a meeting took place over the past weekend. We don’t know exactly what was said, but the end result is that Petersson was back training with the team at their first official practice in front of their fans on Monday.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nWe’re helped in this instance by the Canadian Chris Abbott providing his answers in English. Let’s start with how I summed things up in my previous article:\n\nA real change in culture is needed at HV, as Petersson himself said. To deliver that, Abbott has to show strong leadership. Letting an agent be seen to be calling the shots would immediately damage his authority. Pilko’s [Petterson’s agent] comments left Abbott with no choice but to accept his captain’s departure.\n\nAnd maybe that leads us to something like the truth, if a single version of the truth really exists here.\n\nAgents work for their players, not the other way around despite what some teams like to claim to save face with their fanbase. If Petersson is unhappy and wants out with a year remaining on his contract, the agent’s job is to make that happen. If achieving that means Pilko has to make himself the bad guy publicly, so be it. That’s just part of the job.\n\nMy key points were that Abbott had to be seen to be in charge and that sometimes an agent has to be the bad guy on behalf of his client. What I didn’t write, as the reports didn’t suggest this was likely at the time, was that this did still leave the door open for Petersson to be welcomed back into the fold. That could be achieved, if Petersson wanted to stay, by essentially pinning the blame on the agent.\n\nAnd so to Chris Abbott’s comments:\n\n“As far as the last week or two, there’s been some difference of view here on what the future would look like with André from his side, mainly his representation, and discussions with me. I can say, I was very happy to have a chance to sit down with André this weekend”.\n\n“It’s actually mostly, like a lot of things, chalked up to communication. And I’ve been very open with him and his side about our position and my role coming in here and, for me, that means putting the team first in all the decisions and I know that our whole group is well aware of that”.\n\nA textbook example of smoothing things over! Communication was the issue, something that could be solved by cutting out the middle man.\n\nNow, I don’t really buy that. Aljosa Pilko wasn’t going rogue here, even if his method of tweeting about it was questionable. It was a calculated strategy once Abbott made clear he was not going to honour the alleged verbal agreement between Petersson and the former HV senior management.\n\nHV’s (former) captain has one year left on his current contract. Any player would want more security than that if they could get it, especially someone of Petersson’s ability. His vital contribution to the team avoiding relegation last season would also make it understandable if he was annoyed that a new deal was not forthcoming.\n\nIt made sense for his agent to force the issue by going public with his concerns. If it paved the way for a new multi-year contract elsewhere, with HV deciding it was better to let him leave, then that would be a job well done. If it pushed HV into reconsidering their position then that would be fine too.\n\nThe latter option was not going to happen straight away. Chris Abbott has to demonstrate that his authority has not been damaged. That process has already begun …\n\nHad a very good discussion, and he [Petersson] expressed his wish to be a part of this team moving forward. I can say both the coaching staff, myself, all of André’s teammates are happy that that decision has been made. So, look forward to him fully buying into the way that we’re doing things, moving forward, and that’s putting the team first and going after this season as we should, and that’s together.\n\nIn the new Abbott era it is all about the team. So long as André Petersson toes that line, and continues to play as we all know he can, the pathway to a contract extension is there for both parties.\n\nFor now, the first step has been taken to a reconciliation. Petersson has been welcomed back into the group, Abbott has arguably enhanced his standing by showing that he won’t be pushed around, and Pilko takes the heat in a way that he won’t lose a single minute of sleep over.\n\nMeanwhile, I need to update my HV71 projected line-up again!\n\nOn Tuesday evening, as the heat of a rare sunny British summer day started to reduce, I sat at my laptop and continued work on my 2024-25 SHL preparation.\n\nThe result was a first draft of my 2024-25 team sheet for HV71. Less than 24 hours later, I’m having to make my first major revision to it.\n\nTeam captain André Petersson was notable by his absence at HV71’s opening training day on Wednesday. Sportbladet have subsequently reported that the squad were informed that he would not be returning to the team for the coming season.\n\nHow HV71 got here\n\nLast season almost ended in disaster for the Jönköping club when they narrowly escaped relegation by winning a Game Seven ‘Play-Out’ decider against Oskarshamn. With six minutes of the game left, and HV resting on a comfortable 5-0 lead, it became clear over the TV coverage that the tone in Husqvarna Garden was suddenly changing.\n\nThe relief and joy of the evening was being replaced with anger and frustration. Thirty seconds later, the production crew at TV4 cut away from the action on the ice to the action in the stands. Three white banners were being held aloft, with a very blunt message to the HV higher-ups.\n\n“The board and Nubben’s incompetence have destroyed HV’s existence”\n\n“This would never happen. Now all bridges are burned”\n\n“Resign everyone”\n\nHV’s captain, André Petersson, was interviewed by TV4 after the game and he wasted little time in making clear whose side he was on. “A change is needed”, said the captain, explaining that “it’s basically the same situation three out of the last four years and I don’t think it’s okay when we have these fans and the municipality supporting the team”.\n\nSporting Director Kent Norberg, the “Nubben” targeted in the fan’s message, was promptly ‘relieved of his duties’ and that was only the start of the off-season upheaval.\n\nYet few would have predicted that Petersson would be following Norberg out the door.\n\nAgent goes public with the dispute\n\nThings have come to a head over the past couple of weeks. On 23 July, Petersson’s agent, Aljosa Pilko, took to social media to publicly criticise HV’s new Sporting Director Chris Abbott. In summary, Pilko claims that his client had been promised a contract extension – presumably by Norberg – and Abbott was now refusing to honour that agreement.\n\nIf the claim is true then Petersson’s frustration would be understandable. No one can deny his commitment to HV in recent seasons, nor the contribution he has made to keep the team in the SHL.\n\nThe problem is, Abbott’s position is just as understandable in return. He cannot be bound by a verbal agreement that he was not party to. Petersson is presumably one of their top earners, he would certainly deserve to be, and Abbott would want to settle into his role before making such a financial commitment.\n\nThe rights and wrongs from there depend on what’s really happened. Pilko has implied that Abbott isn’t returning his calls, which would be an odd approach to take when it concerns the team’s captain. Abbott may disagree with that claim, or may feel justified in refusing to take Pilko’s calls given earlier discussions.\n\nWhat everyone can agree on is that an agent publicly ‘clowning’ a Sporting Director is usually the beginning of the end.\n\nOnly one ending\n\nA real change in culture is needed at HV, as Petersson himself said. To deliver that, Abbott has to show strong leadership. Letting an agent be seen to be calling the shots would immediately damage his authority. Pilko’s comments left Abbott with no choice but to accept his captain’s departure.\n\nAnd maybe that leads us to something like the truth, if a single version of the truth really exists here.\n\nAgents work for their players, not the other way around despite what some teams like to claim to save face with their fanbase. If Petersson is unhappy and wants out with a year remaining on his contract, the agent’s job is to make that happen. If achieving that means Pilko has to make himself the bad guy publicly, so be it. That’s just part of the job.\n\nWhilst the manner of Petersson’s impending departure will be debated, what is clear is that it is a sad end to his time with the club. And, the timing is going to cause Abbott a headache he could really do without.\n\nMy initial roster draft from Tuesday evening had HV71 turning out a potential top line of Henrik Borgström, Tanner Kero and André Petersson. The latter has now been replaced with a question mark.\n\nAbbott is going to need to work quickly to turn that question mark into a high quality replacement.\n\nSkellefteå, the reigning Swedish Hockey League (SHL) champions, have received a boost ahead of the 2024-25 season. It has just been confirmed that talented young defenseman Axel Sandin Pellikka will be spending another year with the team.\n\nThe 19-year-old has come through the junior system at Skellefteå and was selected by the Detroit Red Wings with the 17th overall pick in the 2023 NHL Player draft.\n\nSandin Pellikka’s impressive performances last season, in both the SHL and for Sweden in the World Juniors, made many assume that he would be heading to North America for the new campaign, suiting up with Detroit’s AHL affiliate Grand Rapids Griffins.\n\nInstead, he will spend another season with Skellefteå, as reported by Helen St. James of Detroit Free Press.\n\nStaying where he is comfortable\n\nThe report confirms that this was Sandin Pellikka’s decision and one that the Red Wings were happy to endorse. Their assistant director of player development, Dan Cleary, is quoted as saying, “we just don’t see the harm in it. No sense rushing him”.\n\nThe player admits that there is more to work on from a defensive standpoint in Swedish hockey. He will get the opportunity to do that in a coaching environment that he is comfortable with.\n\nSandin Pellikka’s 2023-23 season\n\nLast season was Sandin Pellikka’s first full year at the senior level, having made 22 SHL appearances in 2022-23 alongside amassing 36 points in 31 games in the J20 Nationell.\n\nHe played in 39 of Skellefteå’s 52 regular season games, with his absences coming in one block when he played for Sweden in the World Juniors and then missed approximately one month afterwards having played through an upper-body injury during the tournament.\n\nStepping up in his captain’s absence\n\nSkellefteå’s captain, Jonathan Pudas, has been the SHL points-leader among defensemen in each of the past three seasons. He played in 50 regular season games last season, but was only on the ice for four play-off games due to two separate injuries, the second of which resulted in him helping to lift the SHL trophy with one arm still in a sling.\n\nSandin Pellikka stepped up in his experienced teammate’s absence, particularly on the power-play unit. His average ice-time on the man-advantage increased in the play-offs by a whole minute compared to his regular-season mark.\n\nPudas delighted the Skellefteå fans at their trophy parade by announcing that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the team. Fitness permitting, he will resume his role as the defenseman on the top power-play unit, one that ranked 1st in the SHL last season on a 34% success rate (the team also had the best penalty-kill in the league at 88.46%).\n\nMore to do in 24-25\n\nThat should be of no concern to Red Wings fans, though. Sandin Pellikka will still get plenty of ice time on the man-advantage. More importantly, he’s already advanced with his power-play skills for his age. What matters most for his development in 2024-25 is logging 19 minutes or so of ice time, game-in, game-out, against some of the leading offensive talent in the SHL.\n\nSkellefteå will be more than happy to give him the opportunity to do just that in the coming season. That’s great news for them and great news for the Red Wings too.\n\nThe past week has seen another group of player signings in the Swedish Hockey Leagues.\n\nMoDo Making Moves\n\nPredicting which two teams may end the coming season in the relegation play-off is always very difficult, not least as you’re bound to upset their fans in the process.\n\nOne team who you could reasonably put in the group of potentials is MoDo. That would be ased on their 11th-placed finish last season and that 2024-25 will be their second season in the SHL following promotion. Just as music bands can struggle with the ‘difficult second album’, the ‘difficult second season’ can be an issue too.\n\nThe problems are usually two-fold. Firstly, some of your best players can be snapped up by more established teams now that they have shown what they can do in the top-tier. For MoDo, that’s come in the form of forward Josh Dickinson departing for Rögle and defenseman Daniel Brickley moving to Tappara Tampere in Finland.\n\nSecondly, staying up the first season often relies on retaining the team spirit that helped you get promoted in the first place and that group dynamic can be disrupted when bringing in new players if you are not careful.\n\nSo far it looks like the team has managed this process well this summer and they confirmed two more additions last week. Paul LaDue has joined from the Bridgeport Islanders in the AHL and Ludwig Byström returns to the team that gave him his professional debut as a 16-year-old back in 2010.\n\nMattias Persson of HockeyNews SE was so impressed that last Tuesday he even tipped MoDo to be a play-off team in 2024-25. If that comes true then it will be the perfect way to banish the ‘difficult second season’ curse.\n\nHV71 and Brynäs too\n\nTwo other teams you would have to put in the relegation series conversation are the team that narrowly escaped relegation in 23-24, HV71, and the team that has come up from the Allsvenskan, Brynäs. Both teams have made a number of additions over the off-season to try to keep out of the danger zone.\n\nBrynäs unsurprisingly have been especially active in building a team to step back up to the SHL. Their most recent move has been to complete their goaltender tandem by signing former Frölunda junior Ludvig Persson. Persson spent four years playing in NCAA and now returns to Sweden to compete for playing time in the crease with Erik Källgren.\n\nBrynäs benefitted from some outstanding goaltending in their promotion campaign courtesy of the Anaheim Ducks’ prospect Damian Clara. The 6’6″ goalie was selected 60th overall in the 2023 draft and was then loaned to Brynäs by Färjestad for the 23-24 season. Clara signed an Entry Level Contract with the Ducks in June and although he is expected to return to Sweden for one more season, that will be with Färjestad.\n\nAs for HV, they were one of several SHL teams linked to Finnish forward Joona Luoto this off-season and they were able to confirm that they had won this particular prize last week. The former Winnipeg Jet and Columbus Blue Jacket spent the 23-24 season in Switzerland with Bern and should be a very useful addition to HV71’s group of forwards.\n\nTeams at the top getting better as well\n\nAt the other end of the table, last season’s beaten finalists Rögle have completed what, on paper, looks to be a flawless off-season by signing Jacob Peterson. The former Frölunda and Färjestad forward returns to the SHL after three seasons in North America that included 83 NHL games combined for the Dallas Stars and San Jose Sharks.\n\nPeterson is one of 10 main new signings that Rögle have secured this off-season. Sporting Director Hampus Sjöström deserves a lot of credit for the retooling job he has done, particularly after the somewhat surprising exit of Rodrigo Abols who opted out of his contract to sign a two-way contract with the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nMeanwhile beaten semi-finalists Frölunda followed up their signing of Arttu Ruotsalainen on 12 July with the capture of Linus Weissbach over the past weekend.\n\nThe team from Göteborg has also had to recover from an unplanned departure to the NHL, in Frölunda’s case that being Jere Innala opting of his contract to sign with the Colorado Avalanche. Bringing Weissbach back home is an excellent Plan B, not least as the 26-year-old will still feel highly motivated to keep his own NHL dream alive.\n\nThe forward hasn’t been able to find a way through the Buffalo Sabres’ deep prospect system over his past three AHL seasons. He will return to Sweden determined to perform well for Frölunda and to catch another NHL team’s eye in the process.\n\nVäxjö to add one more?\n\nExpressen reported on Monday that Växjö Lakers are about to complete their summer shopping with the addition of Canadian forward Félix Robert. [NOTE: just after I published this article, Växjö confirmed the signing on their website].\n\nHe turns 25 years old on Wednesday 24th July and his birthday present will be to sign a contract to play in Europe for the first time. The centre has played in the AHL for the Syracuse Crunch over the past two seasons, with very consistent results: 34 points from 55 games in 22-23 and 34 points from 53 games in 23-24.\n\nThe news immediately puts to bed any rumours of a return for Kalle Kossila. The Finnish forward’s move to Bern was called off at the end of last week due to them finding issue with an undisclosed part of his pre-contract medical examination. Kossila had been excellent for Växjö over the past two seasons and a return to his former team might have been an option, given that they will know his recent medical history better than most.\n\nHowever, there will be no space for him once Robert arrives and HockeyNews SE reports that it is looking likely that Kossila will stay in Switzerland with Ambri-Piotta.\n\nFärjestad finally got their man on Saturday.\n\nAfter weeks of discussions, Oskar Steen has decided to return home after five seasons in North America. He has signed a 5-year contract with Färjestad and, whilst all SHL contracts tend to have an NHL opt-out, it’s a real statement of intent that Steen will be part of the Karlstad core for years to come.\n\nRoster being rebuilt\n\nAs with most SHL teams, Färjestad have had quite a bit of roster-rebuilding work to do this summer after losing several key players, particularly among their forward group. This is how they lined up for their final game of the 2023-24 season when they were dispatched from the play-offs by Rögle.\n\nTwo of the three from the top line have departed. Liam Öhgren benefitted from Färjestad’s early play-off exit by heading across to North America and making his NHL debut with the Minnesota Wild. He is on course to build on that in 2024-25, although he may start the season in the AHL. As for Victor Ejdsell, he decided to capitalise on his excellent 23-24 season by signing a lucrative contract with Bern in the Swiss National League.\n\nOscar Lawner has joined Linköping, Marcus Nilsson has moved to the Allsvenskan with Björklöven and Partik Lundh is weighing up his options having left at the end of his contract.\n\nTomasek still with the team\n\nThe good news for Färjestad is that the player we all thought was leaving, David Tomasek, remains with the team.\n\nAfter an excellent first season in Sweden, capped off by claiming a Gold Medal with Czechia at the World Championships, it was no surprise that several NHL teams were looking at him. Tomasek decided that after the season he had, and being 28-years-old, he was only going to leave if he received a one-way contract, meaning that he would be on an NHL contract rather than a two-way deal that could have seen him spending the season in the AHL.\n\nSuch an offer ultimately did not materialise, so he has backed himself to repeat or better his 23-24 campaign, which is great news for Färjestad.\n\nSeveral new additions\n\nThe signing of Steen comes two weeks after the capture of Marian Studenič, who has spent the past six seasons in North America including games in the NHL for the New Jersey Devils, Dallas Stars and Seattle Kraken.\n\nViktor Lodin has moved to Karlstad after his contract with Oskarshamn was voided after their relegation to the Allsvenskan, whilst Emil Alba makes the step up to the SHL after impressing for Södertälje over the past four seasons.\n\nHow they may start the season\n\nLodin and Alba are likely to centre two of the lines, with Linus Johansson and Joel Kellman taking that role on the other two. Steen and Tomasek can play at centre as well, but it feels more likely that they will start the season on the right-wing. Michael Lindqvist would also come into the team after finishing the 23-24 season on the injured list.\n\nAfter finishing top of the league in the regular season, it was a bitterly disappointing end to 23-24 for Färjestad. Sporting Director Rickard Wallin appears to be intent on giving his team every chance to wipe that memory away as quickly as possible. He has completed some excellent work to fill some holes this summer, with Steen being the latest quality addition,\n\nThe transfer window in football is defined by the hurricane of rumours that dominate the final couple of days before the window ‘slams shut’.\n\nAs the deadline comes into view, the irrational emotion of fans spreads to managers and owners. It doesn’t matter who the player is, all that matters is that the team signs somebody.\n\nThose teams who calmly get their work done early are sneered at, like the teacher’s pet who hands in their assignment before the rest of the class have even started to think about it. There’s no fun in doing it that way. Where’s the drama, the excitement, the buzz of taking things right down to the wire?\n\nIt doesn’t matter that every transfer window proves that the boring approach is almost always the smartest approach and that panic buying in the final hours usually works out as well as scrambling around shops late on Christmas Eve. Not only does the memory of overpaying for a present neither wanted nor needed quickly fade, the error only heightens the stakes the following year.\n\nThe NHL Free Agency period is the polar opposite. Here, the Christmas presents are frantically bought as soon as possible to avoid the dreaded sight of finding the shelves empty of anything worth buying.\n\nThe 2024 version proved to be a classic case in point.\n\nThere is an obvious reason for this: the salary cap.\n\nJust as the transfer deadline in football forces negotiations to come to a conclusion, the budget limitations that NHL teams have to work within mean that waiting out the market usually isn’t an option.\n\nThat’s especially the case for the player and his agent. Leave it too long and you’re left with two options: 1) sign with an uncompetitive team that has the cap space to pay you the money you want, or 2) compromise on the contract to sign with a good team – usually limiting it to a one-year guarantee – and hope that you have a good enough season to give you a better chance next time.\n\nIf this sounds like a good way to restrict potential inflation in salaries, you would be right.\n\nIf it looks like it’s almost designed by the team owners to work this way, you would be right again.\n\nAnd if you think that the ever-growing North American influence in English football means that a salary cap may be heading that way too, you would have got three out of three right on the money.\n\nThe latest proposals being considered in the Premier League (EPL) would be based on a system where the cap is set as a multiple, 5 is the one currently on the table, of the lowest earner from the core TV revenue and prize money. The added complication in football is that it is more of a global league market. Whether it’s a Spanish giant or a Saudi upstart, there will always be external competition that can help to push up player wages.\n\nThe NHL doesn’t have to worry about that. Much as there are wonderful leagues elsewhere, particularly here in Europe, they are not close to the NHL either in financial terms or in reputational terms.\n\nThis difference means the Free Agency frenzy we see every year in the NHL is unlikely to be heading to the EPL anytime soon. Whether that’s a good thing or a bad thing is a matter of personal taste.\n\nWhat’s not in question is that the NHL version, unlike the EPL version, always delivers. Just as it did last Monday when 160 contracts were dished out in less than 8 hours.\n\nNow we just have to wait three months for the 32 NHL teams to get back out on the ice again.\n\nThe 2024 NHL Draft was an impressive spectacle inside the Vegas Dome, one that will be hard to match when the NHL reverts back to teams not being centrally located at the same venue.\n\nWhat really matters is the boundless potential of the players whose names were called out from the podium. Here are my thoughts on some of the European player selections.\n\nNorwegian First Rounders\n\nThe biggest European story was forward Michael Brandsegg-Nygård and defenseman Stian Solberg becoming the first two Norwegians to be drafted in the First Round.\n\nBrandsegg-Nygård was selected 15th overall by the Detroit Red Wings. His impending place in draft history was all-but guaranteed by his performances in the 2023-24 season for Mora in the HockeyAllsvenskan (Swedish second tier) and for his country in both the U20 World Championships and the men’s World Championships. Most prospect rankings had him in the mid-teens and that’s exactly where he went.\n\nWatching him playing for Mora last season, whilst his skating ability and stick-handling were a cut-above his opponents, what really stood out was his fore-checking and defensive work. He wasn’t simply aggressive, he was smart with it too. He was mentally one-step ahead of the opposition, closing off the angle they wanted to take and allowing him to either poke-check or separate the attacking player from the puck. It almost felt like the Jaws music should have been playing in the arena whenever he started circling an opponent!\n\nHe has signed a one-year contract with SHL team Skellefteå for the 24-25 season, so we should be able to enjoy watching him develop in Europe for another season before he heads to North America. Hopefully that will also include a chance to watch him in the UK in September when his team travels to Sheffield to take on the Steelers in the Champions Hockey League.\n\nLike London buses, we waited years for a Norwegian First Rounder and we then got two in quick succession.\n\nStian Solberg was taken eight picks later (23rd overall) by the Anaheim Ducks. He’s spent his hockey career to date in his home country with Vålerenga and will be moving across to Sweden for 24-25 with Färjestad.\n\nLike Brandsegg-Nygård, he impressed mightily at both the J20 and men’s World Championships for Norway over the past six months, especially at the latter with his reputation as a frighteningly physical defensemen only being enhanced by his fearless approach against considerably more experienced players.\n\nThe scouting capsule about him on his Elite Prospects profile sums it up perfectly:\n\nWhat defines Solberg above everything else is his mean streak. He’s not content just repelling opponents. He wants them to be as close as possible, as it’s then easier for him to press his stick in their back. He inflicts pain every chance he gets, immobilizes opponents, and knocks them away from the front of the net.\n\nSwedish Talent\n\nThe 2024 Swedish draft pool was considered to be weaker than we’ve seen in recent years. Not only did it lack a major talent, such as 2023’s Second Overall selection Leo Carlsson, there wasn’t any clear First Round talents either.\n\nTwenty-two Swedish youngsters still had the honour of being selected across the Seven Rounds, showing how solid the country’s overall player development system remains.\n\nThe group was led by MoDo’s Lucas Pettersson. He was the one player that various draft prospect guides picked as someone who might have snuck into the tail-end of the First Round. The Anaheim Ducks selected him with the third pick in the Second Round, 35th overall.\n\nPettersson turned 18 in mid-April and had an excellent season in the J20 Nationell league, amassing 57 points across 44 games. He also impressed over his seven appearances for Sweden in the J18 World Championships during their Bronze medal campaign.\n\nHe got onto the ice for MoDo in the SHL four times in 23-24, just getting a few shifts here and there, and it will be good to watch him take the next step in his development playing more regularly for MoDo in the 24-25 season.\n\nHere are a few of his fellow drafted Swedes who I got to see a bit more of in the SHL and the HockeyAllsvenskan (HAS) this past season:\n\nJack Berglund (2nd Round, 51st overall, by Philadelphia Flyers)\n\nBerglund had a fairy-tale start to his SHL career by scoring on his debut for Färjestad against Skellefteå on 28 November. He then had a few appearances over the busy Christmas period before spending the rest of the season at Junior Levels for club and country, save for one SHL appearance against Luleå on 12 March.\n\nLinus Eriksson (2nd Round, 58th overall, by Florida Panthers)\n\nYet another product off the Djurgården production line, Eriksson split his time between their J20 (25 games) and HAS (29 games, plus 12 play-off games) teams in 2023-24. I primarily watched him during Djurgården’s play-off run, where he stood out in the Semi-Final series against Mora and then held his own in what was a bruising 4-0 loss in the Final series against Brynäs.\n\nSimon Zether (4th Round, 129th overall, by Florida Panthers)\n\nCaptain of Rögle’s J20 team, Zether was also part of their SHL team for 42 regular season games and 15 play-off games, scoring a memorable goal in the Quarter-Finals against Växjö Lakers along the way. In a somewhat surprising move, Rögle have decided to loan him to Västerås in the HockeyAllsvenskan ahead of the 24-25 season.\n\nIn announcing the news, their Sporting Director Hampus Sjöström explained that, “Simon comes to a good environment and a chance to get a good role in a good team. We believe he will be able to develop very well in Västerås and look forward to following him carefully”. Rögle’s official website worded it as him starting the season with Västerås, which may just be a literal interpretation by the English translation or could suggest that they expect he will be back with them at some point during the season.\n\nAlbin Sundin (6th Round, 183rd overall, by Edmonton Oilers)\n\nThis late-round selection caught my eye partly as an Oilers fans – and helps to balance out having to refer to two Panthers picks above – and partly because he was someone who I thought really blossomed for Frölunda during the play-offs last season. He had primarily played for their J20 team (41 games) alongside some SHL appearances (18 during the regular season), before featuring in 14 of their play-off games, averaging 14 minutes or so per game.\n\nHe’s an older prospect within the class, turning 20 in mid-August, and I’d see him more as someone who will have a good career in Europe than a future NHL player, but he appears to have a well-rounded profile and if he continues taking steps forward in his development then there’s a chance he could get an opportunity down the line.\n\nThe top-ranked SHL player\n\nTaken one place ahead of Lucas Pettersson was Malmö’s Czech defensemen Dominik Badinka, who was selected with the 34th overall pick by the Carolina Hurricanes.\n\nBadinka was a popular attraction for scouts at the Malmö Arena and across SHL venues last season, his first in Sweden. It says a lot about his maturity that he was entrusted with so much ice time (averaging over 14 minutes per game) at the SHL level for someone so young. He has both the physical tools you want, standing at 6’3”, as well as the game-reading ability and calmness that you normally only find in more experienced defensemen.\n\nCarolina feels like a good fit for him organisation-wise, although I’d expect him to have at least one more season in the SHL before heading to North America. Building on the 33 games he played in 23-24, playing plenty of minutes as a regular for Malmö, should be very beneficial for his continued development, especially in opening up his offensive potential.\n\nAnd (some of) the rest\n\nWhilst everyone knew that the San Jose Sharks would select Macklin Celebrini with the first overall pick, there was some uncertainty over which way the Chicago Blackhawks would go with the second pick. They opted to go for the defenseman route, after taking elite forward talent Connor Bedard with the first overall pick last year, and selected Artyom Levshunov. Technically he was selected out of Michigan State University, but he is a product of Belarus so we can include him on the European talent list.\n\nThere were two Russians taken in the top ten, including forward Ivan Demidov who was taken fifth overall by the Montréal Canadiens. Draftin Europe consider him to be “the best prospect to come out of Europe in the last 5 years” and if he lives up to that billing then the Habs could have a very special talent on their hands.\n\nThe New Jersey Devils selected defenseman Anton Silayev with the 10th overall pick. As with his fellow countrymen, Russia’s international tournament ban has hindered the ability of NHL scouts to get a full read on how his current potential may translate to higher-levels of play, particularly with the puck. That’s not stopped them being able to see how well he skates for someone of 6’7”, though, which is why a year ago he was being touted as a potential top three selection. The public scouting reports have summarised him as a strong bet to be a good NHL defenseman, with the potential to be a star defender if he is able to smooth some rough edges and develop his offensive game.\n\nAnd finally, centre Konsta Helenius, the top talent out of Finland, was taken with the 14th overall selection by the Buffalo Sabres. His performances in the Finnish Liiga for Jukurit at just 17 years old (he turned 18 on 11 May) were so impressive that he ended the season making history as the youngest player ever to represent Finland at the men’s World Championship. I saw a couple of Jukurit’s games in the play-offs where he shone with six points in six games and he oozed class in everything he did.\n\nKen Holland almost had another dream ending to the latest chapter in his Hall of Fame career.\n\nWhen the Edmonton Oilers appointed Jeff Jackson as their CEO of Hockey Operations on 3 August last year, the countdown on Holland’s time with the team had begun even if none of those involved were prepared to actually say it. The veteran executive had one year remaining on his contract with the Oilers and few people thought that he would be staying for longer.\n\nEarly in the 23-24 season it looked like he might not even see out that contract after his team had an appalling start to their campaign. Head Coach Jay Woodcroft carried the can for that and under new skipper Chris Knoblauch the Oilers went on an incredible roll that took them all the way to a memorable Game Seven.\n\nThe Florida Panthers ultimately ended Holland’s hopes of adding a fifth Stanley Cup to his resume and if he is to rekindle that pursuit he will do so with another team now that the Oilers have officially confirmed he will not be signing a new contract with them.\n\nHolland’s departure will not be lamented by a lot of Oilers fans. When expectations are so high, it’s inevitable that the General Manager will get the brunt of the blame when they are not met. You can’t be a genius by winning with McDavid and Draisaitl, but you can definitely be cast as the idiot if you don’t.\n\nThat’s really not entirely fair. Take Zach Hyman as an example: the free agent signing raised plenty of eyebrows when it was announced in 2021. This was not because anyone doubted that he would be a good addition to the Oilers’ roster, but that giving him a full seven-year deal worth $38.5M looked overly generous. That was particularly the opinion coming out of Toronto, albeit from there it was coloured by the Maple Leafs losing out on their former player.\n\nThree seasons into the contract and we can already judge it to be a resounding success, with the only risk being the incredibly unlikely scenario of him being utterly useless for the remaining four years. 54 regular season points from his 21-22 season was a solid start, 83 points in 22-23 and then 77 in the season just gone (including 54 goals) have been worth a lot more than the $5.5M average annual value (AAV) the Oilers have paid him.\n\nThe trouble is, you tend to be remembered for your bad deals more than your good ones. Two in particular will be part of Holland’s immediate legacy in Edmonton.\n\nJack Campbell: In the Soup\n\nWhere do we even start?\n\nThe Mikko Koskinen and Mike Smith goalie tandem somehow got the Oilers to the 2021-22 Conference Finals, yet along the way it felt like no lead was ever truly safe. They always gave the impression that they ‘had one in them’ as we say in football and, unfortunately, went on to prove that to be the case on numerous occasions.\n\nThat’s frustrating for any team. For a team with prime Connor McDavid in it, it’s the equivalent of buying an expensive one-of-a-kind sculpture and then displaying it on a rickety fold-up table.\n\nKen Holland’s main job in the 22-23 off-season was to find a good answer to his team’s questionable goaltender situation. He found Jack Campbell, who only counts as a good answer if the question is ‘name a contract that immediately looked like it would be a disaster from the moment it was announced’.\n\nYear One didn’t go well for him; Year Two started so badly that he was demoted to the AHL after 5 games and stayed there for the rest of the season. He has three years left under contract, at an AAV of $5M, and whoever takes over the decision-making in Edmonton this summer will have to find a way to get him off the balance sheet one way or another.\n\nDarnell Nurse: Difficult to Defend\n\nAnd then there’s arguably Ken Holland’s biggest error of all: signing defenseman Darnell Nurse to an eight-year, $74M contract extension in August 2021.\n\nIt’s only arguable because Nurse is a good player and, by all accounts, a very popular leader among his teammates. Having been drafted by the Oilers with the seventh overall pick in the 2013 draft, he established himself as a quality all-round NHL defenseman. He is prone to a dip in form here and there to make him more a 2nd-pairing defenseman than a true top guy, but there’s no doubt that Nurse is a player you would want on your team.\n\nNot at $9.25M per season, though, and in a salary cap sport you can’t simply dismiss the extra couple of million per year as a waste of somebody else’s money. It has a knock-on effect on the roster-building process and the cap space available to make improvements.\n\nThe great shame of this is that it puts an enormous target on Nurse’s back. Yes, we can all flippantly say that we’d happily put up with the criticism in exchange for $9.25M, but that’s not the point. This is a talented, proud professional hockey player for whom no amount of money will soften the blow of heavy criticism from increasingly large portions of his own fanbase and a diminishing role on the ice (by the end of the Stanley Cup Finals, he had been demoted to the third defensive pairing and the second penalty killing unit).\n\nHolland’s decision to commit to this contract has not only saddled his successor with an overpaid player, it’s saddled a good player with pressure that appears to be weighing down his performance even more.\n\nThe Wheel Keeps On Turning\n\nRescuing that situation will now fall to someone else, alongside the futures of 10 Unrestricted Free Agents with minimal cap space to use.\n\nWith the NHL draft beginning tomorrow, and free agency opening on Monday, that task is going to be shared among several current staff members until an appointment can be made. “We don’t have a lot of time to do things” is how Jeff Jackson put it in his media availability an hour or so ago.\n\nAs for Holland, right now he has plenty of time on his hands to do whatever he so chooses; however, I suspect it won’t be long before he’s back working in an NHL Front Office in some capacity."
