This comes as the team is set to start a three-game trip in New York against the Islanders starting Thursday night.\n\nThe Bruins are now missing a half a dozen players from their roster, the other three being Captain Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand and Craig Smith.\n\nRead More: Patrice Bergeron In COVID Protocol As NHL Deals With Expanding Cases\n\nHead Coach Bruce Cassidy during a press conference Thursday admitted that is it hard to replace these players, but that this move does open up the chance for other players to take the ice.\n\n“One door closes, another one opens for someone,” Cassidy said. “At some point you have to say ‘here’s my opportunity, here’s my moment' and have it. And that’s kind of what’s in front of us.”\n\nRead More: Boston School Committee Votes To Close Three Middle Schools\n\nWhile a Covid outbreak has hit professional hockey, basketball and football, Bruins forward Charlie Coyle said he is not concerned about another sports shutdown.\n\n“We’re just kind of expecting the unexpected, I guess. In that way, nothing’s too surprising and you can just adapt to it,” Coyle said. “[We] just hope that we have players who can play and hopefully no one else gets sick or too sick and we can keep moving forward and play and win some games.”\n\nCassidy was faithful in the league’s handling of the situation saying, “I feel we have the best leadership in the National Hockey League.”"
