        "text": "Just five days ago, André Petersson’s time with HV71 appeared to be over.\n\nAnd now? Well, it looks like he’ll be staying after all.\n\nHV71’s Sporting Director, Chris Abbott, announced in a video on their official website that a meeting took place over the past weekend. We don’t know exactly what was said, but the end result is that Petersson was back training with the team at their first official practice in front of their fans on Monday.\n\nWhat changed?\n\nWe’re helped in this instance by the Canadian Chris Abbott providing his answers in English. Let’s start with how I summed things up in my previous article:\n\nA real change in culture is needed at HV, as Petersson himself said. To deliver that, Abbott has to show strong leadership. Letting an agent be seen to be calling the shots would immediately damage his authority. Pilko’s [Petterson’s agent] comments left Abbott with no choice but to accept his captain’s departure.\n\nAnd maybe that leads us to something like the truth, if a single version of the truth really exists here.\n\nAgents work for their players, not the other way around despite what some teams like to claim to save face with their fanbase. If Petersson is unhappy and wants out with a year remaining on his contract, the agent’s job is to make that happen. If achieving that means Pilko has to make himself the bad guy publicly, so be it. That’s just part of the job.\n\nMy key points were that Abbott had to be seen to be in charge and that sometimes an agent has to be the bad guy on behalf of his client. What I didn’t write, as the reports didn’t suggest this was likely at the time, was that this did still leave the door open for Petersson to be welcomed back into the fold. That could be achieved, if Petersson wanted to stay, by essentially pinning the blame on the agent.\n\nAnd so to Chris Abbott’s comments:\n\n“As far as the last week or two, there’s been some difference of view here on what the future would look like with André from his side, mainly his representation, and discussions with me. I can say, I was very happy to have a chance to sit down with André this weekend”.\n\n“It’s actually mostly, like a lot of things, chalked up to communication. And I’ve been very open with him and his side about our position and my role coming in here and, for me, that means putting the team first in all the decisions and I know that our whole group is well aware of that”.\n\nA textbook example of smoothing things over! Communication was the issue, something that could be solved by cutting out the middle man.\n\nNow, I don’t really buy that. Aljosa Pilko wasn’t going rogue here, even if his method of tweeting about it was questionable. It was a calculated strategy once Abbott made clear he was not going to honour the alleged verbal agreement between Petersson and the former HV senior management.\n\nHV’s (former) captain has one year left on his current contract. Any player would want more security than that if they could get it, especially someone of Petersson’s ability. His vital contribution to the team avoiding relegation last season would also make it understandable if he was annoyed that a new deal was not forthcoming.\n\nIt made sense for his agent to force the issue by going public with his concerns. If it paved the way for a new multi-year contract elsewhere, with HV deciding it was better to let him leave, then that would be a job well done. If it pushed HV into reconsidering their position then that would be fine too.\n\nThe latter option was not going to happen straight away. Chris Abbott has to demonstrate that his authority has not been damaged. That process has already begun …\n\nHad a very good discussion, and he [Petersson] expressed his wish to be a part of this team moving forward. I can say both the coaching staff, myself, all of André’s teammates are happy that that decision has been made. So, look forward to him fully buying into the way that we’re doing things, moving forward, and that’s putting the team first and going after this season as we should, and that’s together.\n\nIn the new Abbott era it is all about the team. So long as André Petersson toes that line, and continues to play as we all know he can, the pathway to a contract extension is there for both parties.\n\nFor now, the first step has been taken to a reconciliation. Petersson has been welcomed back into the group, Abbott has arguably enhanced his standing by showing that he won’t be pushed around, and Pilko takes the heat in a way that he won’t lose a single minute of sleep over.\n\nMeanwhile, I need to update my HV71 projected line-up again!\n\nOn Tuesday evening, as the heat of a rare sunny British summer day started to reduce, I sat at my laptop and continued work on my 2024-25 SHL preparation.\n\nThe result was a first draft of my 2024-25 team sheet for HV71. Less than 24 hours later, I’m having to make my first major revision to it.\n\nTeam captain André Petersson was notable by his absence at HV71’s opening training day on Wednesday. Sportbladet have subsequently reported that the squad were informed that he would not be returning to the team for the coming season.\n\nHow HV71 got here\n\nLast season almost ended in disaster for the Jönköping club when they narrowly escaped relegation by winning a Game Seven ‘Play-Out’ decider against Oskarshamn. With six minutes of the game left, and HV resting on a comfortable 5-0 lead, it became clear over the TV coverage that the tone in Husqvarna Garden was suddenly changing.\n\nThe relief and joy of the evening was being replaced with anger and frustration. Thirty seconds later, the production crew at TV4 cut away from the action on the ice to the action in the stands. Three white banners were being held aloft, with a very blunt message to the HV higher-ups.\n\n“The board and Nubben’s incompetence have destroyed HV’s existence”\n\n“This would never happen. Now all bridges are burned”\n\n“Resign everyone”\n\nHV’s captain, André Petersson, was interviewed by TV4 after the game and he wasted little time in making clear whose side he was on. “A change is needed”, said the captain, explaining that “it’s basically the same situation three out of the last four years and I don’t think it’s okay when we have these fans and the municipality supporting the team”.\n\nSporting Director Kent Norberg, the “Nubben” targeted in the fan’s message, was promptly ‘relieved of his duties’ and that was only the start of the off-season upheaval.\n\nYet few would have predicted that Petersson would be following Norberg out the door.\n\nAgent goes public with the dispute\n\nThings have come to a head over the past couple of weeks. On 23 July, Petersson’s agent, Aljosa Pilko, took to social media to publicly criticise HV’s new Sporting Director Chris Abbott. In summary, Pilko claims that his client had been promised a contract extension – presumably by Norberg – and Abbott was now refusing to honour that agreement.\n\nIf the claim is true then Petersson’s frustration would be understandable. No one can deny his commitment to HV in recent seasons, nor the contribution he has made to keep the team in the SHL.\n\nThe problem is, Abbott’s position is just as understandable in return. He cannot be bound by a verbal agreement that he was not party to. Petersson is presumably one of their top earners, he would certainly deserve to be, and Abbott would want to settle into his role before making such a financial commitment.\n\nThe rights and wrongs from there depend on what’s really happened. Pilko has implied that Abbott isn’t returning his calls, which would be an odd approach to take when it concerns the team’s captain. Abbott may disagree with that claim, or may feel justified in refusing to take Pilko’s calls given earlier discussions.\n\nWhat everyone can agree on is that an agent publicly ‘clowning’ a Sporting Director is usually the beginning of the end.\n\nOnly one ending\n\nA real change in culture is needed at HV, as Petersson himself said. To deliver that, Abbott has to show strong leadership. Letting an agent be seen to be calling the shots would immediately damage his authority. Pilko’s comments left Abbott with no choice but to accept his captain’s departure.\n\nAnd maybe that leads us to something like the truth, if a single version of the truth really exists here.\n\nAgents work for their players, not the other way around despite what some teams like to claim to save face with their fanbase. If Petersson is unhappy and wants out with a year remaining on his contract, the agent’s job is to make that happen. If achieving that means Pilko has to make himself the bad guy publicly, so be it. That’s just part of the job.\n\nWhilst the manner of Petersson’s impending departure will be debated, what is clear is that it is a sad end to his time with the club. And, the timing is going to cause Abbott a headache he could really do without.\n\nMy initial roster draft from Tuesday evening had HV71 turning out a potential top line of Henrik Borgström, Tanner Kero and André Petersson. The latter has now been replaced with a question mark.\n\nAbbott is going to need to work quickly to turn that question mark into a high quality replacement.\n\nSkellefteå, the reigning Swedish Hockey League (SHL) champions, have received a boost ahead of the 2024-25 season. It has just been confirmed that talented young defenseman Axel Sandin Pellikka will be spending another year with the team.\n\nThe 19-year-old has come through the junior system at Skellefteå and was selected by the Detroit Red Wings with the 17th overall pick in the 2023 NHL Player draft.\n\nSandin Pellikka’s impressive performances last season, in both the SHL and for Sweden in the World Juniors, made many assume that he would be heading to North America for the new campaign, suiting up with Detroit’s AHL affiliate Grand Rapids Griffins.\n\nInstead, he will spend another season with Skellefteå, as reported by Helen St. James of Detroit Free Press.\n\nStaying where he is comfortable\n\nThe report confirms that this was Sandin Pellikka’s decision and one that the Red Wings were happy to endorse. Their assistant director of player development, Dan Cleary, is quoted as saying, “we just don’t see the harm in it. No sense rushing him”.\n\nThe player admits that there is more to work on from a defensive standpoint in Swedish hockey. He will get the opportunity to do that in a coaching environment that he is comfortable with.\n\nSandin Pellikka’s 2023-23 season\n\nLast season was Sandin Pellikka’s first full year at the senior level, having made 22 SHL appearances in 2022-23 alongside amassing 36 points in 31 games in the J20 Nationell.\n\nHe played in 39 of Skellefteå’s 52 regular season games, with his absences coming in one block when he played for Sweden in the World Juniors and then missed approximately one month afterwards having played through an upper-body injury during the tournament.\n\nStepping up in his captain’s absence\n\nSkellefteå’s captain, Jonathan Pudas, has been the SHL points-leader among defensemen in each of the past three seasons. He played in 50 regular season games last season, but was only on the ice for four play-off games due to two separate injuries, the second of which resulted in him helping to lift the SHL trophy with one arm still in a sling.\n\nSandin Pellikka stepped up in his experienced teammate’s absence, particularly on the power-play unit. His average ice-time on the man-advantage increased in the play-offs by a whole minute compared to his regular-season mark.\n\nPudas delighted the Skellefteå fans at their trophy parade by announcing that he had signed a five-year contract extension with the team. Fitness permitting, he will resume his role as the defenseman on the top power-play unit, one that ranked 1st in the SHL last season on a 34% success rate (the team also had the best penalty-kill in the league at 88.46%).\n\nMore to do in 24-25\n\nThat should be of no concern to Red Wings fans, though. Sandin Pellikka will still get plenty of ice time on the man-advantage. More importantly, he’s already advanced with his power-play skills for his age. What matters most for his development in 2024-25 is logging 19 minutes or so of ice time, game-in, game-out, against some of the leading offensive talent in the SHL.\n\nSkellefteå will be more than happy to give him the opportunity to do just that in the coming season. That’s great news for them and great news for the Red Wings too.\n\nThe past week has seen another group of player signings in the Swedish Hockey Leagues.\n\nMoDo Making Moves\n\nPredicting which two teams may end the coming season in the relegation play-off is always very difficult, not least as you’re bound to upset their fans in the process.\n\nOne team who you could reasonably put in the group of potentials is MoDo. That would be ased on their 11th-placed finish last season and that 2024-25 will be their second season in the SHL following promotion. Just as music bands can struggle with the ‘difficult second album’, the ‘difficult second season’ can be an issue too.\n\nThe problems are usually two-fold. Firstly, some of your best players can be snapped up by more established teams now that they have shown what they can do in the top-tier. For MoDo, that’s come in the form of forward Josh Dickinson departing for Rögle and defenseman Daniel Brickley moving to Tappara Tampere in Finland.\n\nSecondly, staying up the first season often relies on retaining the team spirit that helped you get promoted in the first place and that group dynamic can be disrupted when bringing in new players if you are not careful.\n\nSo far it looks like the team has managed this process well this summer and they confirmed two more additions last week. Paul LaDue has joined from the Bridgeport Islanders in the AHL and Ludwig Byström returns to the team that gave him his professional debut as a 16-year-old back in 2010.\n\nMattias Persson of HockeyNews SE was so impressed that last Tuesday he even tipped MoDo to be a play-off team in 2024-25. If that comes true then it will be the perfect way to banish the ‘difficult second season’ curse.\n\nHV71 and Brynäs too\n\nTwo other teams you would have to put in the relegation series conversation are the team that narrowly escaped relegation in 23-24, HV71, and the team that has come up from the Allsvenskan, Brynäs. Both teams have made a number of additions over the off-season to try to keep out of the danger zone.\n\nBrynäs unsurprisingly have been especially active in building a team to step back up to the SHL. Their most recent move has been to complete their goaltender tandem by signing former Frölunda junior Ludvig Persson. Persson spent four years playing in NCAA and now returns to Sweden to compete for playing time in the crease with Erik Källgren.\n\nBrynäs benefitted from some outstanding goaltending in their promotion campaign courtesy of the Anaheim Ducks’ prospect Damian Clara. The 6’6″ goalie was selected 60th overall in the 2023 draft and was then loaned to Brynäs by Färjestad for the 23-24 season. Clara signed an Entry Level Contract with the Ducks in June and although he is expected to return to Sweden for one more season, that will be with Färjestad.\n\nAs for HV, they were one of several SHL teams linked to Finnish forward Joona Luoto this off-season and they were able to confirm that they had won this particular prize last week. The former Winnipeg Jet and Columbus Blue Jacket spent the 23-24 season in Switzerland with Bern and should be a very useful addition to HV71’s group of forwards.\n\nTeams at the top getting better as well\n\nAt the other end of the table, last season’s beaten finalists Rögle have completed what, on paper, looks to be a flawless off-season by signing Jacob Peterson. The former Frölunda and Färjestad forward returns to the SHL after three seasons in North America that included 83 NHL games combined for the Dallas Stars and San Jose Sharks.\n\nPeterson is one of 10 main new signings that Rögle have secured this off-season. Sporting Director Hampus Sjöström deserves a lot of credit for the retooling job he has done, particularly after the somewhat surprising exit of Rodrigo Abols who opted out of his contract to sign a two-way contract with the Philadelphia Flyers.\n\nMeanwhile beaten semi-finalists Frölunda followed up their signing of Arttu Ruotsalainen on 12 July with the capture of Linus Weissbach over the past weekend.\n\nThe team from Göteborg has also had to recover from an unplanned departure to the NHL, in Frölunda’s case that being Jere Innala opting of his contract to sign with the Colorado Avalanche. Bringing Weissbach back home is an excellent Plan B, not least as the 26-year-old will still feel highly motivated to keep his own NHL dream alive.\n\nThe forward hasn’t been able to find a way through the Buffalo Sabres’ deep prospect system over his past three AHL seasons. He will return to Sweden determined to perform well for Frölunda and to catch another NHL team’s eye in the process.\n\nVäxjö to add one more?\n\nExpressen reported on Monday that Växjö Lakers are about to complete their summer shopping with the addition of Canadian forward Félix Robert. [NOTE: just after I published this article, Växjö confirmed the signing on their website].\n\nHe turns 25 years old on Wednesday 24th July and his birthday present will be to sign a contract to play in Europe for the first time. The centre has played in the AHL for the Syracuse Crunch over the past two seasons, with very consistent results: 34 points from 55 games in 22-23 and 34 points from 53 games in 23-24.\n\nThe news immediately puts to bed any rumours of a return for Kalle Kossila. The Finnish forward’s move to Bern was called off at the end of last week due to them finding issue with an undisclosed part of his pre-contract medical examination. Kossila had been excellent for Växjö over the past two seasons and a return to his former team might have been an option, given that they will know his recent medical history better than most.\n\nHowever, there will be no space for him once Robert arrives and HockeyNews SE reports that it is looking likely that Kossila will stay in Switzerland with Ambri-Piotta.\n\nFärjestad finally got their man on Saturday.\n\nAfter weeks of discussions, Oskar Steen has decided to return home after five seasons in North America. He has signed a 5-year contract with Färjestad and, whilst all SHL contracts tend to have an NHL opt-out, it’s a real statement of intent that Steen will be part of the Karlstad core for years to come.\n\nRoster being rebuilt\n\nAs with most SHL teams, Färjestad have had quite a bit of roster-rebuilding work to do this summer after losing several key players, particularly among their forward group. This is how they lined up for their final game of the 2023-24 season when they were dispatched from the play-offs by Rögle.\n\nTwo of the three from the top line have departed. Liam Öhgren benefitted from Färjestad’s early play-off exit by heading across to North America and making his NHL debut with the Minnesota Wild. He is on course to build on that in 2024-25, although he may start the season in the AHL. As for Victor Ejdsell, he decided to capitalise on his excellent 23-24 season by signing a lucrative contract with Bern in the Swiss National League.\n\nOscar Lawner has joined Linköping, Marcus Nilsson has moved to the Allsvenskan with Björklöven and Partik Lundh is weighing up his options having left at the end of his contract.\n\nTomasek still with the team\n\nThe good news for Färjestad is that the player we all thought was leaving, David Tomasek, remains with the team.\n\nAfter an excellent first season in Sweden, capped off by claiming a Gold Medal with Czechia at the World Championships, it was no surprise that several NHL teams were looking at him. Tomasek decided that after the season he had, and being 28-years-old, he was only going to leave if he received a one-way contract, meaning that he would be on an NHL contract rather than a two-way deal that could have seen him spending the season in the AHL.\n\nSuch an offer ultimately did not materialise, so he has backed himself to repeat or better his 23-24 campaign, which is great news for Färjestad.\n\nSeveral new additions\n\nThe signing of Steen comes two weeks after the capture of Marian Studenič, who has spent the past six seasons in North America including games in the NHL for the New Jersey Devils, Dallas Stars and Seattle Kraken.\n\nViktor Lodin has moved to Karlstad after his contract with Oskarshamn was voided after their relegation to the Allsvenskan, whilst Emil Alba makes the step up to the SHL after impressing for Södertälje over the past four seasons.\n\nHow they may start the season\n\nLodin and Alba are likely to centre two of the lines, with Linus Johansson and Joel Kellman taking that role on the other two. Steen and Tomasek can play at centre as well, but it feels more likely that they will start the season on the right-wing. Michael Lindqvist would also come into the team after finishing the 23-24 season on the injured list.\n\nAfter finishing top of the league in the regular season, it was a bitterly disappointing end to 23-24 for Färjestad. Sporting Director Rickard Wallin appears to be intent on giving his team every chance to wipe that memory away as quickly as possible. He has completed some excellent work to fill some holes this summer, with Steen being the latest quality addition,\n\nAlthough the NHL Free Agency market quickly ran cold, teams in the Swedish Hockey League are continuing to build their rosters. Three teams have added a new player over the past couple of days.\n\nTimrå sign Max Eisenmenger\n\nTimrå have added 25-year-old German national team centre Max Eisenmenger on a two-year contract.\n\nThe 6’4″ forward spent the 2023-24 season with Adler Mannheim in the DEL, where he played 41 times and contributed 10 points. He is no stranger to Swedish hockey as he grew up in the country, coming through the junior ranks at Södertälje and Djurgården. He also spent the 2022-23 season in the HockeyAllsvenskan with Tingsryds.\n\nThis will be his first step up to the SHL, aside from 2 appearances for Djurgården as an 18-year-old. He’s a two-way centre, but more known for his defensive work and face-off ability than someone who you would expect to be racking up too many attacking points.\n\nFrölunda sign Arttu Ruotsalainen\n\nFrölunda have been looking for two new forwards following the departures of Malte Strömwall to Switzerland with Rapperswil-Jona Lakers and Jere Innala to the NHL with the Colorado Avalanche.\n\nArttu Ruotsalainen will fill one of those vacancies after his signing was confirmed on Friday.\n\nThe Finnish forward made 35 appearances in the NHL for the Buffalo Sabres across the 2020-21 and 2021-22 seasons before heading back to Europe, spending the past two seasons in the Swiss National League. He amassed 42 points in 52 games for Kloten in 2022-23 before moving on to Lugano in 2023-24 where his production took a downturn with 14 points in 43 games.\n\nHe has good pedigree though and should fit in well at Frölunda.\n\nVäxjö sign Otto Koivula\n\nVäxjö Lakers were another team searching for some fire power after losing two key forwards this summer, in the form of Kalle Kossila and Marcus Sylvegård.\n\nTanner Kero was one of the names linked to the Lakers before he signed for SHL rivals HV71, but another of the rumoured former NHL/AHL targets has been secured in Otto Koivula.\n\nKoivula did make 28 appearances in the NHL for the New York Islanders across three seasons, but spent all of the 2023-24 season with their AHL affiliate, the Bridgeport Islanders. He was an unrestricted free agent this summer and has decided to return to Europe on a two-year contract.\n\nThe 6’5″ Finn has the type of power forward game that should really add an extra dimension to Växjö’s offensive options and it would be no surprise if he impresses enough in the SHL to make his way back to the NHL at some point.\n\nSkellefteå are the Swedish Hockey League champions for the fourth time after defeating Rögle 2-0 on Monday to win the SHL Final Series 4-1.\n\nIt’s a redemption story for Robert Ohlsson’s team after losing in the SHL Final twelve months ago to Växjö, the club’s fourth consecutive visit to the Final series that has resulted in disappointment. The team also had to bounce back from the pain of falling just short in the Champions Hockey League Final against Genève-Servette in February this year.\n\nTheir SHL gold medal has come despite being without their captain, Oscar Möller, for the entire season due to illness and with the acting captain, Jonathan Pudas, missing most of the play-offs due to injury. Both players were in the stands cheering their teammates on as the trophy was secured at the Kraft Arena.\n\nAmidst all of the storylines from their triumphant season, none have been more impactful than the result of bringing back two former NHL forwards to the SHL.\n\nThe first was the return of Oscar Lindberg, ten years after he left the team for North America. Lindberg went on to play 252 games in the NHL over five seasons before returning to Europe for spells in Switzerland and Russia. His first season back in yellow and black saw him lead the SHL with 51 points and be a driving force on and off the ice.\n\nThe second was Andreas Johnsson. He appeared to be on his way back to Frölunda, where he had won the SHL and CHL double back in 2016, before the lure of playing with his brother Jonathan helped him to sign for Skellefteå instead. He was a steady presence in the line-up, rather than a spectacular one, during the regular season (16 points from 30 games), but his heroics in the play-offs will live long in the memories of Skellefteå fans.\n\nThe team found a perfect blend of experience and young talent, with the likes of Jonathan Pudas and Pär Lindholm leading along young talent such as Elias Salomonsson and Axel Sandin-Pellikka, both of whom are likely to head to the AHL next season, whilst Linus Söderström once again proved to be a calming presence in net, finishing things off by being awarded the MVP of the Final.\n\nIt all added up to a well-rounded team, with both the best power-play and the best penalty-kill during the SHL regular season, and one that deservedly skated off the ice on Monday with golden helmets on their heads and the SHL trophy lifted high.\n\nRögle the Runners-Up\n\nAs for Rögle, the obvious disappointment of missing out in the Final has to be balanced against the tremendous achievement of making it that far.\n\nA difficult start to the season saw Cam and Chris Abbott fired as Head Coach and GM respectively in December. By February, under the leadership of Roger Hansson, the team was still looking nervously over their shoulder at the Relegation zone and making sure that they secured their SHL status.\n\nUltimately they finished 9th in the table and then went on an incredible play-off run, beating Timrå 2-0 in the opening round before blitzing their way past regular season winners Färjestad 4-0 and then the runners-up Växjö in another 4-0 sweep.\n\nEven though the Final proved to be one step too far, they were a competitive opponent throughout with the first four games of the series decided by a single goal and the fifth game being 1-0 until Skellefteå sealed the deal with an empty-net goal in the final minute.\n\nJoy for Skellefteå\n\nAfter the richly-deserved celebrations this summer, Skellefteå will start the hard work of attempting to retain their title.\n\nThe competitiveness of the SHL will make that a tough task, but they’ll be reminded regularly by their fans that they were the last club to do it in 2013 and 2014.\n\nThis season’s Promotion Series play-off in the HockeyAllsvenskan has the potential to be one for the ages.\n\nIt is a battle between two teams whose history suggests they should be battling for SHL glory, not simply the chance to play in the top-tier of Swedish hockey.\n\nBrynäs trying to bounce straight back\n\nBrynäs are looking to get back to where they belong. This is a team that had never been relegated from the top-tier of Swedish hockey (over 60 years) before disaster struck in 2023.\n\nThey finished that season second from bottom, in 13th place, and were beaten 4-1 by Malmö in the Relegation Series to condemn them to the HockeyAllsvenskan for the first time.\n\nIt wasn’t completely out of the blue. Brynäs had faced the relegation play-off series two years before where they got the better of HV71 to avoid the drop. A 10th-placed finish in 2022 was an improvement, but not one that lasted. Finally, in 2023, the unthinkable happened.\n\nThe team has responded to this blow in a perfect manner. They have finished top of the league by a distance, 17 points to be exact, winning 38 of their 52 games (5 in Overtime). They swept Nyrbo Vikings 4-0 in the Quarter-Finals and then beat Karlskoga in five games in a relatively stress-free march to the Promotion Series.\n\nHowever, none of that will matter if they fall at the final hurdle. The objective is simple: promotion at the first attempt. Anything else will be considered a failure for the second most successful team in Swedish hockey.\n\nSuccess at the second attempt for Djurgården?\n\nNo one knows that better than their Promotion Series opponents, the most successful team in Swedish hockey, Djurgården.\n\nThe 16 times champions Djurgården were relegated two years ago, in 2022, during a season in which they won only 14 games before being defeated in the Relegation Series by Timrå.\n\nThey finished fourth in the HockeyAllsvenskan last season and made it through to the Promotion Series where they lost to MoDo, so they’re aiming to go one better this time around.\n\nThey have history on their side too as this is how things played out the last time they got relegated, 12 years ago. They were relegated in 2012 and then got back up at their second attempt.\n\nNot just status at stake\n\nThe financial disparity between the SHL and HockeyAllsvenskan is considerable, with broadcasting revenue approximately one-tenth of what comes teams way in the top tier.\n\nA newly-relegated team does receive a parachute payment in their first year to soften the blow and Brynäs have used their budget well this season to give themselves a great chance of taking full advantage.\n\nIf they don’t, they’ll be in a similar position to Djurgården now, trying to find a way to put together a roster befitting the club’s history and expectations of fans without the benefit of the SHL broadcast money to fuel their budget.\n\nWho to look out for?\n\nBrynäs’s main strength is the depth of their roster and you can almost go so far as to say that they are an SHL team in the second tier.\n\nMiks Indrasis was brought in over the off-season with over 500 games in the Russian KHL under his belt and he has been everything they hoped for, finishing second in the HAS points-scoring ranks with 58 in 52 games (only bettered by Södertälje’s Marcus Eriksson’s 59 points).\n\nAmerican Jack Kopacka showed promise last season with Kristianstads in the HAS and Brynäs saw a hard-working, physical forward who had the potential to add more goals to his game. He proved them right by scoring 33 times, the most of any player in the league, and he leads the team with 6 goals in 9 play-off games.\n\nAt the other end of the ice, Brynäs made a real statement of intent in mid-October by adding defenseman Jordie Benn to their group, a veteran of other 600 NHL games. He’s one of several quality defenders playing in front of the colossus that is 6ft 6in goalie Damian Clara. The 19-year-old was taken in the Second Round of the 2023 NHL draft by the Anaheim Ducks and has been hugely impressive in the HAS this season, following it up by conceding only 12 goals combined in 7 play-off games so far.\n\nAs for Djurgården, we have to start with the evergreen Linus Klasen. He had a point-per-game season as a 38-year-old (47 points in 47 games) and, after amassing 16 points in 15 play-off games last season, he’ll be desperate to help his team get over the final hurdle this time around, potentially as fitting swansong to a brilliant career.\n\nDjurgården captain Marcus Krüger also put up 16 points in the play-offs last season. The disappointment of the Promotion Final defeat has been added to in 2023-24 due to him being sidelined for two extended spells due to injury. Thankfully for Djurgården, he’s been a consistent presence in the team since the start of March and, as a player who was part of two Stanley Cup-winning teams with the Chicago Blackhawks, having him fit and firing at this time of year has been a big factor in their progression to the Final.\n\nAt the back, they can rely on the steadying presence of goaltender Viktor Andrén. The former Brynäs goalie has started all 11 of Djurgården’s play-off games so far and you can expect him to be in between the pipes throughout the Promotion Final series.\n\nWhich way will it go?\n\nBrynäs have shown few weaknesses across the regular season, and the play-offs so far, and it’s difficult to avoid the feeling that they should go on and complete the job; however, such great expectations come with great pressure.\n\nThe first two games of the best-of-seven series will be played at Brynäs’s Monitor ERP Arena. If Djurgården can win even one of those contests then they will fancy their chances at using their home-ice advantage at Hovet over the following two games to really test their opponent’s resolve.\n\nThe sensible prediction would be for a competitive series ending in a 4-2 victory for Brynäs, but no one should be surprised if we end up with a winner-takes-all Game Seven.\n\nSeries Schedule\n\nWeds 17th – Gm 1 at Brynäs\n\nFri 19th – Gm 2 at Brynäs\n\nSun 21st – Gm 3 at Djurgården\n\nTues 23rd – Gm 4 at Djurgården\n\nFri 26th – Gm 5 at Brynäs\n\nSun 28th – Gm 6 at Djurgården\n\nTues 30th – Gm 7 at Brynäs\n\nFew games match the contrast in emotions that are produced by a final game decider of a relegation series. That was shown on Friday night when HV71 defeated Oskarshman 5-0 in Game Seven of the SHL Relegation Series.\n\nHV71\n\nFor HV71 there was joy in avoiding relegation to the HockeyAllsvenskan for the second time in four years; however it was mixed with understandable frustration. The team from Jönköping are a proud club of great tradition. Their relegation in the 2020-21 season came just four years after they had been crowned SHL Champions and was met as much with shock as it was anger.\n\nHaving achieved promotion back to the SHL at the first time of asking, the supporters were expecting that lessons had been learned and they could put those struggles behind them. Instead, the team laboured to an 11th-placed finish last season and then finished second from bottom in this campaign. Even though the final game of the best-of-seven relegation series was a comfortable victory, there was nothing comfortable about the series overall and no one among senior management at HV71 should fool themselves as to how close they were to presiding over a second disaster in four years.\n\nThe HV71 fans certainly won’t let them escape responsibility. A section had come to Husqvarna Garden armed with banners that made their thoughts clear to the higher-ups.\n\nThe message translates approximately to: “The board and Nubben’s incompetence have destroyed HV’s existence … This would never happen. Now all bridges are burned … Resign everyone”.\n\nThey waited until their team was 5-0 up before displaying the message, but the whole point of it was that it would have been just as applicable if they were 0-5 down. Narrowly avoiding relegation and being relegated certainly are two different fates, yet the two situations come back to the same failings.\n\nIt wasn’t just a pocket of fans who were feeling this way. Team captain André Petersson was asked about the banner after the game by TV4 and stated: “I don’t know if I’m the right person to solve that problem. But it’s basically the same situation three out of the last four years and I don’t think it’s okay when we have these fans and the municipality supporting the team” (Google translation of comments as reported by HockeyNewsSE).\n\nOskarshamn\n\nEveryone at Oskarshamn would happily deal with this problem. They don’t have the benefit of trying to channel their frustrations into doing better in the SHL next season. Instead, they are facing a complete overhaul and an uncertain competitive future.\n\nOskarshamn secured promotion to the SHL at the end of the 2018-19 season having lost to Leksand in the Final the previous season. It was huge moment for the club after years outside of the top-tier. Subsequently managing to stay in the SHL for five seasons shouldn’t be downplayed as an achievement for them, as Oskarshamn historically have not been among the Swedish elite, but that will be small comfort for them right now.\n\nOskarshamn know all too well how difficult it is to get out of the HockeyAllsvenskan and new Sporting Director Oscar Alsenfelt has a big job on his hands this summer.\n\nThe majority of players have exit clauses in their contracts that allow them to leave if the team falls out of the SHL. It’s previously been reported that Patrik Karlkvist has an agreement in place with Örebro and that play-off star Viktor Lodin has recently reached an agreement with Färjestad and, in truth, it will be much quicker to list the players that will stay at the club than those who will leave.\n\nThat also applies to Head Coach Martin Filander who will see his four years in Oskarshamn come to an end.\n\nFor their fans, it wasn’t just the end of a spell in the SHL, but the end of watching this group of players representing their club and their city. It will be a long summer for them as they look on at how their team’s management plots a path back to the Big Time."
