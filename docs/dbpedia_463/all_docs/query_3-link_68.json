        "text": "The Boston Bruins should consider bringing in another winger before the start of the season. After losing Jake DeBrusk, Danton Heinen, Pat Maroon, and Oskar Steen, it would not hurt for them to add to their depth on the wing.\n\nWhile the Bruins have cap space left, most of it will be given to RFA Jeremy Swayman for his next deal. As a result, if the Bruins hope to add another winger to their group, they will need to go after bargain players. When looking at the free agents still left on the board, former San Jose Sharks forward Alexander Barabanov could be worth taking a chance on.\n\nBarabanov, 30, had a down season in 2023-24, posting four goals and 13 points in 46 games. While this offensive production isn't the best, it is important to note that he had plenty of success with the Sharks in the two seasons before it.\n\nIn 2021-22 with the Sharks, Barabanov broke out in a big way, posting 10 goals and 39 points in 70 games. He followed it up by setting career highs with 15 goals, 32 assists, and 47 points in 68 games. Thus, Barabanov produced like a true top-six forward not too long ago. Could this be enough for a team like the Bruins to take a gamble on him?\n\nIf the Bruins signed Barabanov to a cheap one-year deal, he would provide them with another potential option for their top nine. At worst, he would be a solid depth forward to have around, but there is reason to believe that he could improve his offense in 2024-25 with a change of scenery.\n\nNevertheless, it will be intriguing to see if the Bruins consider targeting Barabanov. While he would not be the flashiest of signings, he would be a bounce-back candidate to watch.\n\nRecent Bruins News\n\nBruins Newcomer Is Boston's Latest Breakout Candidate\n\nFormer Bruins Forward Signs Long-Term Deal Overseas\n\nBruins: 3 Potential Free-Agent Destinations for Kevin Shattenkirk\n\nBruins Prospect Goalie Can't Be Slept On\n\nEx-Bruins Forward Could Be Target for Maple Leafs"
