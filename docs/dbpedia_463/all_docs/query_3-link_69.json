        "text": "BOSTON -- Karson Kuhlman wasn’t what anyone would call an also-ran at this time last year, but he was definitely jockeying for position among a crowded field of candidates.\n\nToday, he’s the de facto leader of at least one noteworthy pack -- the group of Bruins forwards who would love to have David Krejci and Jake DeBrusk as linemates.\n\nIn many ways Kuhlman, who turned 24 on Thursday, would seem the least likely winger to head the group. He wasn’t drafted. His NCAA career, which included a championship in his senior year (2017-18), was solid but unspectacular. He showed promise as a rookie pro last season at AHL Providence (12 goals, 30 points in 58 games), but probably not second-line NHL promise.\n\nYet there Kuhlman was last June, brought off the bench to play in Games 6 and 7 of the Stanley Cup Final, and here he is today, the most likely player to skate with DeBrusk and Krejci when the Bruins’ 2019-20 season opens Thursday in Dallas.\n\n“Confidence is a big thing,” Kuhlman said, “and getting some reps with this club last year, then being here for that playoff run, definitely helped my confidence. I felt like I was growing every day as a hockey player, on and off the ice.\n\n“This year, I want to show I can stick here, and help this team win games.”\n\nKuhlman has the endorsement from Krejci, his center for those Cup Final games last spring.\n\n“Obviously, we had some great games last year,” said Krejci, who fed Kuhlman for his first playoff goal, a third-period strike in a 5-1 Game 6 win over the Blues that helped the B’s force Game 7. “I know what to expect from him. He complements my game pretty well.”\n\nRemarkably, Kuhlman made his impression in only 19 NHL games last season -- 11 during the regular season (three goals, five points, plus-5) and eight more in the playoffs (one goal, three points, plus-1). The 5-foot-11, 185-pounder got a four-game look in mid-February, and was summoned from AHL Providence again on March 20. He never went back.\n\n“He bought in last year,” Krejci said. “He did all the little details right. Every time he got into the lineup, he brought lots of energy. At the same time, he’s got really good offensive skills, which a player like me enjoys.”\n\nIt doesn’t hurt Kuhlman that Krejci, at 33 a veteran of 12 seasons in Boston, is a supporter, since head coach Bruce Cassidy often consults Krejci about potential linemates. Kuhlman’s other advantages are Cassidy’s determination to use Weymouth’s Charlie Coyle as the Bruins’ No. 3 center instead of their No. 2 right wing, and, ironically, a minor injury Krejci sustained on Monday, in his lone pre-season game against the Flyers. That was to be free agent import Brett Ritchie’s audition as Krejci’s right wing, but it lasted only two shifts.\n\nAll the same, Kuhlman knows he’s not alone in wanting to play with DeBrusk and Krejci, a combination entering its third year. Versatile winger Danton Heinen is an option, as is third-year pro Anders Bjork, whose first two seasons have been derailed by shoulder surgeries.\n\nSo Kuhlman isn’t presuming anything. He’s hopeful that Cassidy will put him into the penalty-killing rotation to account for the departure of Noel Acciari as a free agent, “because I see that as something I’ll need to do to stay on this team.” When called for last season and during training camp, he was worked to establish chemistry with Coyle and No. 4 center Sean Kuraly.\n\n“I’m always just going to try to take care of what I can do,” Kuhlman said. “That’s to play a 200-foot game, definitely, and try to help out whoever else is on my line as much as possible.”"
