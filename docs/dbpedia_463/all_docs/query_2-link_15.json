        "text": "The 2023 NHL Draft is rapidly approaching, with Connor Bedard set to hear his name at #1 overall on June 28th. To help fans prepare, I’ve compiled a comprehensive list of the top 128 skaters in the class. Due to my limited experience in analyzing the goalie position, I decided not to rank goalies in my NHL draft rankings this year, as I felt uncertain about accurately evaluating their performance. This 2023 NHL Draft ranking was put together thanks to meticulous analysis of draft-eligible players, dedicating extensive time to evaluate their abilities. In this article, I will share my detailed assessments and rankings for the top 50 of my 128 ranked skaters. Additionally, I have provided an upside comparable for the top 32 players, offering insights into what their impact could be if they hit their highest potential.\n\nIt is important to clarify that these rankings are not necessarily indicative of the order in which players will be selected in the actual draft. Instead, they reflect my assessment of their skills and my predictions for their future achievements beyond the draft.\n\nI take pride in formulating my rankings based solely on my own observations and evaluations, rather than being influenced by other lists or rankings. When assessing players, I place great importance on their hockey IQ, as it serves as the foundation for their overall performance. A player’s mental capabilities dictate how effectively they utilize their physical tools. Even if a player possesses impressive physical skills, without strong hockey sense, their chances of achieving success are diminished. Another crucial aspect for me is a player’s work ethic. If a player demonstrates a strong work ethic, it suggests they have the motivation and determination to continuously improve. Now that you understand the key skills that hold significance to me, it becomes clear why I may favor certain players over others. Without any further delay, let’s dive into the rankings and explore the promising prospects of the 2023 NHL Draft.\n\nTait Borst’s Top 128 2023 NHL Draft Rankings\n\n1. Connor Bedard\n\nRanking Bedard was the simplest task. Not only has he lived up to the immense pre-draft hype, but he has surpassed expectations altogether. Bedard emerges as an offensive force, capable of defeating opponents using various techniques. His drag and release shot is nearly unstoppable, and when paired with his rapid hand speed, it becomes a nightmarish challenge for goalies. In addition, Bedard exhibits an intense and fiery playing style, fearlessly engaging in physicality and venturing into the gritty areas of the game. What sets Bedard apart is his exceptional ability to process the game faster than anyone else in this draft class, consistently proving himself as a generational prospect.\n\nUpside Comparable: Patrick Kane\n\n2. Adam Fantilli\n\nFantilli stands out as a player who would typically be the unanimous choice for the top-ranked position in most years. He encompasses all the qualities of a complete player, possessing size, strength, grit, and elite skill. At the NHL level, he will be relied upon in every situation, excelling as both a phenomenal penalty killer and a power play specialist. Due to his physical style of play, combined with his size and strong work ethic, Fantilli is projected to thrive in playoff scenarios. While being critical, one area for improvement that I would like to see Fantilli address is the consistency of his playmaking. Occasionally, he has a tendency to force passes or make low-percentage plays. Enhancing his ability to consistently distribute the puck would solidify his potential as a star in the making.\n\nUpside Comparable: Matthew Tkachuk\n\n3. Matvei Michkov\n\nMichkov is poised to become the most captivating narrative to follow on draft day. His undeniable skill has translated into consecutive outstanding seasons, setting unprecedented records. His shot exhibits a rapid release coupled with remarkable precision. Defenders frequently focus their attention on him, allowing Michkov to cleverly generate space for his teammates and deliver precise passes. Among the draft prospects, he stands out as one of the most imaginative players, fearlessly attempting spectacular moves that captivate spectators. While there is room for improvement in his two-way play moving forward, his offensive potential is so exceptionally high that it outweighs any concerns about his defensive abilities in my rankings.\n\nUpside Comparable: Kirill Kaprizov\n\n4. Leo Carlsson\n\nCarlsson has been a personal favorite of mine to watch this year due to his exceptional playmaking skills and remarkable vision on the ice. His ability to see and execute plays that most players miss is truly impressive. While his passing stands out as his primary offensive tool, he also displays great proficiency in stickhandling. As a taller player, Carlsson may not possess the quickest speed, but I have been thoroughly impressed with his adept use of crossovers, head fakes, and shoulder fakes to navigate through opposing defenses. However, one aspect I would like to see Carlsson improve upon is his shooting frequency. Although he possesses a strong shot, he tends to rely too heavily on his passing ability. If he incorporates a greater threat of shooting, it would create more space for his teammates, enabling him to distribute passes more effectively.\n\nUpside Comparable: Alexander Barkov\n\n5. Will Smith\n\nSmith takes charge of the NTDP’s highly talented top line, serving as the catalyst for their offensive prowess. His ability to produce highlight-reel plays seems endless. Smith possesses remarkable deception skills, skillfully utilizing hesitations to outmaneuver defenders and create opportunities for his teammates. With swift hands, he frequently embarrasses opposing defenders. His quick and accurate shot, combined with his slick stick handling and deceptive techniques, throws goaltenders off balance and leads to scoring goals. However, in order to fully capitalize on his exceptional skills, Smith should focus on improving his two-way play and skating ability. By doing so, he will maximize the advantages provided by his elite talents.\n\nUpside Comparable: Artemi Panarin\n\n6. Zach Benson\n\nBenson’s draft position is likely to be lower than it should be because of his size. However, it’s important to recognize that he is one of the most intelligent players in the draft. His ability to read the game at a rapid pace ensures he is rarely caught out of position. Benson plays with intensity and maintains a relentless work ethic. Thanks to his exceptional hockey IQ, he can execute passes that many players would miss. While his skating is average, his unwavering determination and refusal to quit give the impression of greater speed. Additionally, he displays good edge work and exhibits quick agility when maneuvering through the defense. Benson’s strengths extend to being a strong forechecker, and he possesses the versatility to excel in various game situations. It would be beneficial for him to enhance his shooting ability to further enhance his offensive skill set, although this critique is relatively minor.\n\nUpside Comparable: Brayden Point\n\n7. Ryan Leonard\n\nLeonard caught my attention in every game I watched of the NTDP this season. He possesses qualities that NHL teams will greatly appreciate. With his exceptional skill, strength, and power, he isn’t afraid to engage physically. He takes on the gritty tasks for the NTDP’s top line, displaying a personal investment and despising defeat. Leonard’s lethal shot and fearlessness in driving to the net stand out. He excels at occupying the center of the ice and causing chaos. Furthermore, he proves himself as a versatile player, thriving in all situations. His performance for the NTDP this season demonstrates his ability to step up when it matters most. Given his style of play, which is well-suited for playoff intensity, I believe NHL teams will share the same perspective.\n\nUpside Comparable: Timo Meier\n\n8. David Reinbacher\n\nReinbacher stands out as the most mature defender among the prospects in the 2023 class. His performance this season, competing against more experienced players, has been exceptional. He exhibits a well-rounded defensive game and showcases solid puck-moving abilities. Utilizing his substantial frame and impressive reach, Reinbacher effectively separates opponents from the puck and defends against rushes. Notably, as the season progressed, he displayed improved decision-making in the defensive zone, refraining from excessively chasing the play. He demonstrates excellent judgment in determining when to contribute to the offensive rush and when to prioritize defensive stability. Reinbacher boasts powerful skating skills, supported by his strong edges. However, enhancing his lateral mobility would further bolster his offensive capabilities. From my perspective, he possesses all the necessary attributes to become a dependable top-four defenseman at the professional level.\n\nUpside Comparable: Aaron Ekblad\n\n9. Tom Willander\n\nI have extensively considered whether to rank Willander or Reinbacher as my top defenseman. I have been thoroughly impressed with Willander’s progress throughout this season, as well as comparing his performance to the previous year. One standout aspect of his game is his remarkably smooth skating ability, particularly notable given his size, which enables him to elude pressure and generate offensive opportunities. While he demonstrates competence in getting shots through traffic, he could improve by capitalizing on the space he creates for himself and directing his attacks towards the net. Defensively, Willander has made significant strides this season. He exhibits enhanced composure with the puck, displays improved gap control, and effectively employs his body to disrupt opposing plays. I anticipate that his decision to join Boston University next year will prove to be highly beneficial for his development, with the program fostering his growth into a dynamic two-way defenseman with exceptional offensive capabilities.\n\nUpside Comparable: Shea Theodore\n\n10. Nate Danielson\n\nThis may be a somewhat unconventional opinion, but in my view, Danielson is one of the safest picks in this year’s draft. I understand that the term “safe pick” is often associated with players who may lack offensive potential. However, this is not the case with Danielson. He possesses all the necessary attributes to make a significant impact in the NHL. His size, speed, hands, playmaking ability, and two-way play are all impressive. While his statistics may not immediately jump out, it is essential to watch his games to fully appreciate his skills. Danielson is indeed a two-way center who excels at shutting down opposing teams’ top players, but he also possesses an impressive offensive skill set. His skating ability is already strong, and it should only improve as he continues to build muscle. Additionally, his quick hands frequently catch defenders off guard, and he occasionally pulls off highlight-reel moves. However, his greatest offensive strength lies in his exceptional playmaking ability. He consistently surprises his teammates with his ability to deliver passes that seemed impossible to get through. I firmly believe that as Danielson progresses to higher levels and competes alongside more talented players, he will surprise many with his offensive capabilities.\n\nUpside Comparable: Nico Hischier\n\n11. Dalibor Dvorsky\n\nDvorsky entered the year with considerable hype surrounding his name. While playing in the Allsvenskan, he showcased his ability to play a reliable defensive game and occasionally contribute offensively against experienced opponents. Notably, he excels as a powerplay specialist, utilizing his booming one-timer from the half wall. Dvorsky demonstrates physicality on the ice and fearlessly ventures into the gritty areas of play. He has a knack for performing well in clutch situations, thriving under the spotlight. To further elevate his game, it would be advantageous for him to become a more prominent playmaking threat, prompting defenders to give him additional space to unleash his powerful shot. Additionally, enhancing his speed and striving for greater offensive consistency would be beneficial areas of improvement for Dvorsky.\n\nUpside Comparable: Brayden Schenn\n\n12. Oliver Moore\n\nMoore undoubtedly stands out as the fastest skater in this draft class, with a notable margin separating him from the competition. While Moore did not feature on the NTDP’s highly talented first line, he was entrusted with driving his own line. He demonstrates commendable skills on both ends of the ice and exhibits a relentless work ethic as a forechecker. Moore’s versatility is evident as he is expected to contribute in all situations at the college level. Due to his exceptional speed, there are instances where he may outskate his own abilities to process the game and coordinate his movements. However, as the season progressed, he showed significant improvement in selectively utilizing his speed and managing the puck while operating at top speed. Additionally, Moore possesses a powerful shot, capable of beating goalies from long distances and while in motion. One area for growth lies in enhancing his playmaking skills, as his exceptional speed creates ample opportunities and space for his teammates.\n\nUpside Comparable: Dylan Larkin\n\n13. Gabe Perreault\n\nPerreault had a historic season this year with the NTDP. He thinks the game at such a high level and is one of the smartest players in this class. He uses deception to gain extra space to get a shot off or slide a no look pass to a teammate. His hands are good and he can pull off an occasional highlight real play. He is a hard worker and is always trying to improve his game. He isn’t the fastest skater but his IQ allows him to be in the right spots quick enough. His playmaking is superb and at times it looks like he has eyes in the back of his head. His hands are quick and smooth and he has a very accurate shot. He does a great job at slipping into space undetected for scoring chances. For him to fully take advantage of his skills I’d like to see him gain a quicker first few strides and top speed.\n\nUpside Comparable: Joe Pavelski\n\n14. Dmitri Simashev\n\nSimashev is a player who can be quite perplexing to observe. On one hand, he possesses all the necessary skills to become a top-pair offensive defenseman, but his statistics haven’t fully reflected his potential. Remarkably, considering his size, he skates exceptionally well. His fluid edge work and powerful, elongated strides are noteworthy. Furthermore, his lateral mobility and adeptness at walking the line are impressive attributes for a player of his stature. Simashev also excels as a robust defender, utilizing his physicality effectively to separate opponents from the puck. I believe that as Simashev continues to develop, he will discover how to harness all of his talents, resulting in a more prominent offensive game. It wouldn’t be far-fetched to imagine that in five years’ time, Simashev could emerge as the top defenseman in this class, provided he can fully integrate his skills.\n\nUpside Comparable: Mikhail Sergachyov\n\n15. Axel Sandin Pellikka\n\nSandin Pellika is arguably the defenseman with the highest offensive potential in this draft class. He possesses exceptional agility and displays smooth skating abilities. His lateral mobility allows him to skillfully navigate the blue line, making him a threat in offensive zone plays. Pellika excels as a breakout passer, demonstrating impressive composure even when facing pressure from opponents. His shot is quick and accurate, and he shows great proficiency in finding shooting lanes through traffic. With his diverse skill set, he has the necessary tools to excel as a power play quarterback at higher levels of play. Defensively, he is solid in handling rushes and effectively guides opposing players to the outside. If there’s room for improvement, it would be in his consistency when deciding to join offensive rushes, as he tends to exhibit passive performances at times.\n\nUpside Comparable: Shayne Gostisbehere\n\n16. Daniil But\n\nAs the season progressed, But really started to make a significant impression on me. His performance in the playoffs was nothing short of spectacular, highlighting his quick hands and impressive playmaking skills. His long reach allows him to effectively strip opponents of the puck and swiftly transition into offensive opportunities. Moreover, he possesses an exceptional shooting ability, effortlessly picking corners with his accurate release. Even when playing in the KHL, he displayed confidence and skill that was surprising, due to his relative inexperience. He demonstrates a strong understanding of the game, consistently finding open spaces in the offensive zone. However, as he continues to develop his physical presence, it would benefit him to utilize his size more effectively in winning board battles and playing a more physical style.\n\nUpside Comparable: Tage Thompson\n\n17. Andrew Cristall\n\nCristall stands out as one of the most debated prospects in this year’s draft, but in my view, his offensive potential is too compelling to overlook. Although concerns regarding his skating and defensive play hold merit, Cristall possesses a multitude of skills that can compensate for these weaknesses. Notably, he exhibits exceptional creativity when handling the puck, enabling him to outmaneuver defenders using various techniques. His rapid stick handeling, coupled with his elite vision, allow him to anticipate plays faster than most players, effectively finding open teammates with the highest scoring potential. Additionally, his adeptness at reading the flow of the game and intercepting passes further bolsters his playmaking abilities. While his top speed may currently be a vulnerability, Cristall’s ability to position himself correctly, along with his quick edges and agility, helps to mitigate this issue. It’s worth noting that when he’s not delivering pinpoint passes to his teammates, he’s unleashing pinpoint accurate shots that find the top corner of the net. With his diverse skill set and imaginative style of play, Cristall represents a high-risk, high-reward selection, and I lean towards him fulfilling his considerable upside.\n\nUpside Comparable: Trevor Zegras\n\n18. Otto Stenberg\n\nStenberg is an exceptionally skilled player who brings a high level of energy to the ice. He has the ability to drive plays and consistently create scoring opportunities. His impressive speed allows him to thrive in the game, and he possesses a rapid and precise shot release. Stenberg demonstrates a strong work ethic in all areas of the ice, contributing both offensively and defensively. He frequently positions himself well in the offensive zone, showcasing his understanding of the game. Even when playing against more experienced opponents in the SHL, Stenberg appeared comfortable and did not look out of place. Once he gains confidence and earns the trust of his coaches, he will undoubtedly become a formidable threat in the SHL.\n\nUpside Comparable: Jesper Bratt\n\n19. Matthew Wood\n\nMatthew Wood, the youngest player in college hockey this year, showcased impressive skills and contributed significantly to his team. He demonstrated his ability to control the game and effectively lead the team’s powerplay. His shooting technique is exceptional, often overpowering goalies with long-distance shots. Additionally, his passing abilities are solid, effortlessly executing no look passes. However, to further enhance his performance, he should focus on building strength to dominate board battles utilizing his sturdy physique. While his skating may be slower compared to others, his strong hockey sense compensates by positioning himself appropriately at crucial moments. With dedicated efforts to improve his skating, Matthew has the potential to become a force to be reckoned with.\n\nUpside Comparable: Tyler Seguin\n\n20. Eduard Sale\n\nSale is undeniably one of the most gifted players in the draft, boasting a wide range of exceptional skills. He possesses a large frame, impressive skating ability, quick hands, a powerful shot, and excellent vision on the ice. However, the area where Sale falls short is in maintaining a consistent work ethic. While there are moments when he showcases his immense skill and takes control of games, more often than not, he displays a passive demeanor. When he fully commits and gives his all, he becomes a force to be reckoned with, utilizing his deceptive speed to blow past defenders and demonstrating his smooth hands to maneuver around them. His powerful shot allows him to score from long distances, and his vision enables him to locate teammates in open spaces. Sale possesses all the necessary tools to become a top-tier player, but he must significantly increase his engagement level if he wishes to reach that level of success.\n\nUpside Comparable: Evgeni Kuznetzov\n\n21. Brayden Yager\n\nYager entered this season with high expectations after an impressive draft-1 performance. He excels as a skater, displaying exceptional speed right from the first few steps. His ability to leave defenders behind effortlessly is remarkable. Moreover, Yager possesses one of the quickest shot releases among the draft prospects. However, this season he encountered some bad luck in terms of goal-scoring, as he didn’t match his previous season’s goal tally. While this might raise concerns for some scouts, I believe it was a result of Yager’s increased focus on improving his playmaking skills. His development in this area has been substantial, and I appreciate his ability to impact the game in multiple ways. Nonetheless, it would be beneficial for him to work on enhancing his consistency and engagement in every play.\n\nUpside Comparable: Jeff Skinner\n\n22. Quentin Musty\n\nMusty is a physically imposing power forward with strong skills on the ice. He embraces a physical style of play, not hesitating to engage in the rougher aspects of hockey. He possesses a rapid shot release, although he could benefit from improving his shooting accuracy for greater consistency. Musty’s greatest strength lies in his playmaking abilities, excelling at locating his teammates in open areas on the ice. However, he could work on enhancing his acceleration and top speed to become even more effective. Moreover, focusing on developing his two-way game and maintaining consistent work ethic would further elevate his performance. Musty thrives when he embraces his physicality and adopts a pest-like approach to the game.\n\nUpside Comparable: Jaime Benn\n\n23. Samuel Honzek\n\nHonzek seamlessly transitioned from the Slovak men’s league to the WHL, quickly becoming a key player for the Vancouver Giants. He played a pivotal role in driving the team’s offense, consistently creating scoring opportunities. One of his notable strengths is his exceptional vision, enabling him to excel at creating space for his teammates and positioning them in high-danger areas. Honzek’s high hockey IQ allows him to analyze the game effectively, making him skilled at intercepting passes and generating turnovers through his excellent anticipation. While his skating is decent, he compensates for it with his exceptional ability to read plays and position himself accordingly. He is agile and has impressive edges for a big guy. Moreover, his shot is often underrated, featuring a quick release that catches defenders off guard. Additionally, his fast hands can surprise opponents on occasion.\n\nUpside Comparable: J.T. Miller\n\n24. Anton Wahlberg\n\nWalhberg stands out as one of my personal favorites this year, primarily due to his incredible potential and high ceiling. His physical stature is notable, leaving plenty of room for growth and improved coordination. While he already possesses a good top speed, his initial acceleration could be enhanced. What truly sets him apart are his remarkably quick hands, capable of outmaneuvering defenders and leaving them helpless. Furthermore, he excels in board battles and demonstrates a strong two-way game. Despite his big frame, I have been particularly impressed by his ability to deceive opponents while skating through the neutral zone. Additionally, his playmaking skills are a significant asset, skillfully drawing defenders towards him and locating open teammates. If Walhberg can fully harness all of his talents, he has the potential to become an exceptional player. It is highly likely that he will be underestimated and drafted at a lower position than he deserves.\n\nUpside Comparable: Roope Hintz\n\n25. Calum Ritchie\n\nRitchie had an outstanding draft-1 year, and had an impressive performance at the Hlinka Gretzky Cup. While his regular season in the OHL was average, he showcased his abilities in an impressive manner at the U18s. Ritchie’s defensive skills are highly commendable, leading his coach to rely on him for shutting down opposing teams’ top players in the OHL. He embraced this responsibility and played a disciplined game, sometimes appearing hesitant to take offensive risks. However, during the Hlinka Gretzky Cup and U18s, when he was given less defensive obligations, his offensive talents truly shone. Ritchie’s proficiency in passing and adeptness in finding and creating space for his teammates were evident. Additionally, he demonstrates good hand skills and performs at his best when he takes calculated offensive risks.\n\nUpside Comparable: Phillip Danault\n\n26. Colby Barlow\n\nBarlow had an outstanding performance in the OHL during his draft year, establishing his dominance. He played a crucial role in driving the offense for the Owen Sound team, acting as their core strength. Notably, his lower body strength is remarkable, allowing him to engage in physical play effectively. Additionally, his drag and release shooting technique is exceptionally fast, often beating goaltenders from long distances. Throughout the season, he further developed his playmaking skills, demonstrating his ability to create scoring opportunities for his teammates. Barlow poses a significant threat as a penalty killer, capitalizing on opponents’ mistakes and making them pay the price. He relentlessly pursues the puck and delivers impactful checks. With his skill set, he seems tailor-made for playoff situations, and NHL teams are likely to highly value his abilities.\n\nUpside Comparable: Brock Nelson\n\n27. Gavin Brindley\n\nBrindley displayed continuous improvement across all facets of his game throughout the season. His style of play is characterized by speed, aggression, and relentless pursuit. As a formidable forechecker, he consistently applies pressure and showcases his abilities as a solid two-way player. Birndley exhibits impressive edge work and agility, enhancing his effectiveness on the ice. While he possesses a good shot, his greatest offensive asset lies in his exceptional playmaking skills and positioning. Despite being a freshman, he earned the trust of his team and was relied upon in all game situations, particularly thriving under pressure. To further enhance his game, Birndley should focus on strengthening his physical presence to increase his success in winning board battles.\n\nUpside Comparable: Jonathan Marchessault\n\n28. Ethan Gauthier\n\nGauthier is the type of player that NHL teams will eagerly covet. He embodies the perfect combination of skill and toughness, often taking on the role of a pest on the ice. His vision and understanding of the game are impressive, allowing him to make smart decisions on the fly. While his skating ability is decent, his strong edges enable him to navigate the ice effectively. Notably, he has a natural instinct for scoring goals around the net and isn’t afraid to endure physical challenges to create scoring opportunities in tight spaces. Gauthier also excels in playing a well-rounded game, actively contributing to both ends of the ice and taking pride in disrupting opposing plays. Additionally, he is known for his physicality, unafraid to throw his body around, making him a valuable teammate in the heat of battle.\n\nUpside Comparable: Travis Konecny\n\n29. Gracyn Sawchyn\n\nSawchyn left a lasting impression on me during my observations of him this season. He stands out as a highly skilled and elusive forward. His ability to analyze the game at an elevated level and effectively solve problems is truly commendable. Sawchyn’s creativity shines through as he effortlessly executes moves that leave defenders baffled. As an exceptional passer, he consistently delivers accurate passes into high-danger areas. Although his skating ability is average, his agility and excellent edge work compensate for it. Moreover, Sawchyn exhibits remarkable stickhandling skills and possesses a quick release. To further improve his game, he should focus on building strength, as he sometimes struggles to hold onto the puck during battles.\n\nUpside Comparable: Jordan Eberle\n\n30. David Edstrom\n\nEdstrom stands out as one of my personal favorites in this class, and I believe he possesses a strong potential to succeed in the NHL. His unwavering work ethic and commitment to a physical two-way style of play set him apart. Edstrom demonstrates a solid understanding of the game, allowing him to intercept passes and dispossess opponents of the puck effectively. His strength and competitiveness on the boards result in favorable outcomes in most battles. Additionally, he exhibits a natural ability to score around the net and showcases commendable vision. Edstrom’s versatile style of play makes him capable of contributing throughout the lineup, and his consistent performance level indicates a high floor of potential. Even when facing seasoned professionals in the SHL this year, he appeared comfortable and demonstrated his offensive capabilities by consistently positioning himself well.\n\nUpside Comparable: Joel Eriksson Ek\n\n31. Maxim Strbak\n\nStrbak presents an intriguing player profile that captures attention. He displays solid defensive skills across the board and has the potential to become a shutdown defenseman. Strbak exhibits poise, strength, and decent skating ability, while also being a reliable outlet passer. His exceptional positional play allows him to effectively neutralize opposing plays. Moreover, he demonstrated glimpses of offensive potential during international tournaments this season. Notably, he showcased the ability to contribute from the point on the powerplay, displaying deception in his shooting and passing. To further enhance his offensive game, Strbak would benefit from improving his agility and speed. It is worth mentioning that his decision to join Michigan State next year under the guidance of Adam Nightingale, I expect him to have a positive impact on his development, particularly in fostering his offensive skills.\n\nUpside Comparable: Brett Pesce\n\n32. Oliver Bonk\n\nBonk showcased significant improvements in various facets of his game throughout this season. Despite his large frame, he demonstrates solid skating ability and excels as a defensively sound player who isn’t hesitant to utilize his physicality. Additionally, Bonk possesses good passing skills, although he could benefit from refining his decision-making regarding when to join the rush. His powerful shot proves effective, particularly when navigating through congested areas on the ice. Furthermore, Bonk exhibits proficiency in defending against opposing rushes and displays a penchant for finishing checks. To further elevate his game, it would be advantageous for him to enhance his agility and incorporate more deception into his passing game.\n\nUpside Comparable: Adam Larsson\n\n— End of the First Round —\n\n33. Bradley Nadeau\n\nNadeau displayed complete dominance in the BCHL this season, consistently posing a scoring threat whenever he took the ice. His standout attribute is his powerful shot, particularly his ability to deliver lethal one-timers. I would confidently rank his shot among the top 10 in this class, as it possesses remarkable speed and impressive accuracy. Nadeau’s proficiency as a shooter creates space for his teammates, allowing him to deliver well-placed passes to them in prime scoring areas. While his skating is decent, further strength development would enable him to better handle the physicality of stronger opponents.\n\n34. Noah Dower Nilsson\n\nDower Nilsson stands out as one of the most astute players in terms of positioning in this draft. While he may not possess exceptional speed, he consistently finds himself in the right place on the ice. This strategic advantage allows him to leverage his impressive playmaking skills. Dower Nilsson exhibits excellent hand-eye coordination and impeccable timing in his passing, enabling him to thread pucks through traffic directly onto his teammates’ sticks. He demonstrates commitment at both ends of the ice and performs well in a two-way capacity. Although he possesses a solid shot, Dower Nilsson often opts to utilize his long reach and skillful deking abilities to outmaneuver goaltenders and secure goals.\n\n35. Theo Lidstein\n\nLidstein exemplifies a highly mature defenseman who exhibits a professional-style game. He showcases remarkable composure when in possession of the puck. Lidstein’s active stick work and adeptness in defending against rushes are commendable. Additionally, he possesses strong skating abilities and a deceptive passing game. While he possesses a good shot, he could benefit from utilizing it more frequently. Lidstein’s positioning on the ice is highly effective, and his performance in the SHL indicates his ability to seamlessly adapt to the professional level. Moreover, his exceptional intelligence translates into consistently making sound decisions on the ice, rarely faltering in his playmaking choices.\n\n36. Tanner Molendyk\n\nMolendyk emerges as one of the premier skating defensemen in this draft class. His agility and deceptive edge work make him particularly elusive on the ice. Furthermore, he exhibits proficiency in executing precise outlet passes and defending against opposing rushes. However, there is room for improvement in his defensive positioning, as he occasionally finds himself chasing the play. When in possession of the puck, Molendyk remains composed and displays skillful escape moves. However, he could enhance his performance in board battles and refine his body positioning to minimize vulnerability along the walls.\n\n37. Luca Pinelli\n\nAs the season progressed, Pinelli’s impact on the game became increasingly apparent to me. His elevated hockey IQ and unwavering work ethic stand out as distinguishing qualities. Thanks to his exceptional edgework, Pinelli possesses impressive agility and evasiveness on the ice. His shot release is not only surprising but also remarkably quick, often catching goaltenders off guard. Pinelli has a keen ability to identify open areas and effortlessly locate teammates with no-look passes. Despite his smaller stature, he surprises with a physical presence that exceeds expectations. With his intelligence, work ethic, and solid offensive skills, Pinelli’s size becomes less of a factor in his overall effectiveness.\n\n38. Tristan Bertucci\n\nThroughout the season, Bertucci demonstrated improvement in all facets of his game. His growing confidence with the puck, enhanced positioning in the defensive zone, increased stick activity, and greater involvement in the rush all contributed to his development. Despite his larger stature, Bertucci showcases good skating ability and commendable speed. I was particularly impressed by his ability to consistently navigate shots through traffic and create ample space for his teammates when joining the rush. Moreover, Bertucci not only exhibits offensive potential but also takes pride in his defensive prowess, displaying physicality and composure when in possession of the puck.\n\n39. Mikhail Gulyayev\n\nGulyayev’s game is centered around his exceptional speed and skating ability. He demonstrates impressive agility on his edges and boasts remarkable acceleration. This enables him to effectively join the rush and skillfully maneuver along the blue line. However, I have observed that his playmaking and decision-making skills do not quite match the proficiency of his skating. While he is a decent passer, he occasionally misses opportunities or attempts to force plays that may not be the best choice. Defensively, he exhibits competence in defending against the rush, but his physical strength sometimes leads to challenges in the defensive zone, where he can be overpowered by opponents. Additionally, Gulyayev tends to overly pursue the play in the defensive zone, highlighting a need for improvement in his positioning.\n\n40. Nick Lardis\n\nFrom the moment I first watched Lardis, his exceptional speed and the sheer force of his shot caught my attention. He possesses remarkable agility and elusiveness on his skates, allowing him to effortlessly evade defenders and create scoring opportunities. What truly impresses me is his ability to make his powerful shot appear effortless. He displays finesse in changing the angle of his release point, catching goaltenders off guard with his deceptive shooting technique, even when off balance. However, it is worth noting that Lardis would benefit from improving his physical strength, as he can sometimes be overpowered by opposing players. Additionally, honing his positioning skills in the defensive zone would elevate his overall game. By refining these aspects of his play, Lardis has the potential to become an even more formidable force on the ice.\n\n41. Charlie Stramel\n\nStramel possesses all the necessary attributes to excel as a physical power forward. His passion for playing a robust style of hockey is evident, and he thrives in the gritty areas of the ice. Along the boards, he demonstrates proficiency and showcases an ability to find scoring opportunities in tight spaces. However, I have concerns regarding his hockey sense, particularly his ability to make quick decisions and position himself effectively on the ice. Despite this, I am impressed by his unwavering work ethic and determination to continually enhance his positioning and contribute to his team’s scoring efforts. While I believe he has the potential to establish himself as an NHL player, his success may be more likely in a bottom-six role unless he can refine his game processing skills.\n\n42. Kasper Halttunen\n\nHalttunen is a player with a considerable physical presence and possesses a powerful one-timer shot. While he held his own in the Finnish men’s league this year, he did not significantly influence the flow of play. He demonstrates a strong work ethic and enjoys engaging in physical play. However, I believe he could maximize his advantage as a larger player by winning more puck battles. Halttunen’s speed is not his strongest asset, and improving his acceleration and top speed would be beneficial for his game. He possesses a good instinct for scoring and is adept at finding open areas on the ice. To enhance his performance, I would like to see him develop his playmaking abilities, enabling him to create space and unleash his powerful shot more effectively.\n\n43. Koehn Ziemmer\n\nDespite typically being ranked lower than his teammate Heidt, I personally lean towards preferring Ziemmer’s style of play. What stands out to me is Ziemmer’s exceptional shooting ability and his knack for finding prime scoring opportunities in the high-danger areas. Additionally, I find that Ziemmer’s playmaking skills have notably improved since last year, and I believe they are somewhat underrated. It is worth noting that he could benefit from enhancing his acceleration and top speed, although I find his edgework to be satisfactory. Ziemmer’s impressive puck handling and his ability to score gritty goals in the crease are aspects of his game that I admire. Moreover, his aptitude for protecting the puck is another attribute that I find appealing.\n\n44. Riley Heidt\n\nI have encountered difficulties in forming a definitive opinion on Heidt. On some occasions, I have been impressed by his playmaking skills, his ability to contribute in both ends of the ice, and his physicality. However, in other games, I have only observed his impact on the powerplay and not much elsewhere. That being said, I do believe that Heidt possesses excellent vision and displays adeptness in deceiving opponents with his playmaking abilities. While his shooting could benefit from further improvement, his hands exhibit quickness and skill. He would benefit from enhancing his top speed, although I appreciate his proficiency in edgework. In my opinion, while his playmaking abilities show promise, there remains substantial room for improvement in other areas of his game.\n\n45. Juraj Pekarcik\n\nPekarcik caught my attention primarily because he was competing in the Slovak men’s league. Upon observing his performance, I was impressed by his strong work ethic and his ability to maintain solid defensive positioning. During the U18s, his offensive potential became more evident, as he showcased good vision and a nice shot. He consistently disrupts the game whenever he is on the ice, often turning defensive situations into offensive opportunities. Additionally, Pekarcik displays skillful hands and a knack for getting to the net effectively. He will be very fun to follow in the future and he has a longer runway as he is a very young draft eligible\n\n46. William Whitelaw\n\nWhitelaw is an incredibly entertaining player to watch on the ice. It’s almost a guarantee that he will embark on an end-to-end rush at least once per game, consistently creating scoring opportunities even if he doesn’t always find the back of the net. As the season progressed, Whitelaw showcased noticeable improvements in his game. Initially prone to trying to do too much individually, he has since developed a better understanding of utilizing his teammates effectively. He displays a keen ability to identify and exploit open spaces, providing his teammates with high-danger scoring chances. Despite his smaller stature, Whitelaw fearlessly drives to the net, willingly enduring physical punishment. His speed and agility are impressive, although he could benefit from enhancing his defensive work ethic.\n\n47. Jayden Perron\n\nPerron possesses exceptional skills when it comes to locating open areas on the ice. His ability to position himself effectively is truly impressive, consistently finding himself in advantageous positions. While he boasts a commendable shot, his greatest asset lies in his exceptional vision and playmaking abilities. Perron demonstrates great finesse and craftiness, often prolonging possession to create additional passing opportunities. His agility and edge work are commendable, although he could enhance his top speed. It is worth noting that Perron’s defensive zone efforts and overall consistency could use improvement. Additionally, he faces challenges in physical battles and tends to be overpowered by opponents along the boards.\n\n48. Jesse Kiiskinen\n\nKiiskinen is a player who caught my attention unexpectedly while I was observing another player. He demonstrates a commendable work ethic and consistently puts forth strong efforts at both ends of the ice. His most notable strength lies in his powerful shot, which he skillfully adjusts the angle of to create scoring opportunities. While he exhibits a willingness to engage physically, he would benefit from improving his ability to effectively utilize his body to win battles. Kiiskinen possesses decent vision, but there is room for growth in terms of seeking out higher-quality passing options instead of opting for low-danger shots.\n\n49. Danny Nelson\n\nNelson is a highly reliable and well-rounded player who consistently brings a strong presence on the ice. His physical stature provides him with an advantage, and he demonstrates a tenacious work ethic coupled with intelligent play at both ends of the rink. One of his notable assets is his proficient shot, which he can unleash with impressive speed, particularly in tight scoring areas. Moreover, Nelson’s defensive capabilities shine as he effectively neutralizes opposing teams’ top lines, showcasing his ability to shut down their offensive threats. In addition to his defensive prowess, Nelson also contributes offensively, chipping in with timely goals and key plays. While already displaying good skating ability, especially given his size, there is potential for him to further enhance his game by focusing on improving his acceleration and agility, enabling him to be even more dynamic on the ice.\n\n50. Oscar Fisker Mølgaard\n\nMølgaard is an impressively disciplined player with exceptional positional awareness. Even when competing against more experienced opponents in the SHL, he rarely finds himself out of position. He showcased his ability to hold his own in that league while also making occasional offensive contributions. While Molgaard possesses a decent shot and demonstrates solid vision on the ice, it appears that his offensive upside may be somewhat limited. However, what truly stands out about Molgaard is his reliability and composure on the defensive side of the game. His poised demeanor and defensive prowess make him a strong candidate to become a valuable shut-down forward at the next level.\n\n— End of the Top 50 —\n\nFeatured Image:\n\nEmbed from Getty Images"
