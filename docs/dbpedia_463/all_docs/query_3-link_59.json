        "text": "Dan Vladar will play his first NHL game this season and Oskar Steen will make his NHL debut, Tuesday when the Bruins play the second game of the back-to-back against the Penguins in Pittsburgh.\n\nVladar steps in as Tuukka Rask remains out of the lineup. Jaroslav Halak started the last four games, but the Bruins didn’t want to subject him to playing two nights in a row.\n\nBruce Cassidy said the Bruins’ goalie staff - Bob Essensa, Mike Dunham with consultation from general manager Don Sweeney - made the decision to choose Vladar over Jeremy Swayman.\n\n“They’re comfortable with both. I think either one would have been a good call,” Cassidy said. “The mindset of our team has to be, ‘Gotta protect him early on. Gotta play well.’ He’s got to make the saves he’s supposed to, but we can’t be breaking down in front of him all night, forcing him to win a game for us.”\n\nHalak will dress as the backup.\n\nRask looked uncomfortable as he skated to the bench for the extra skater in the March 7 loss to the New Jersey Devils and hasn’t played since. Vladar backed up Halak in Rask’s absence last week, but the Bruins added Swayman to their taxi-squad Saturday.\n\nVladar played briefly and struggled in Rask’s absence in the bubble last year. He’s 2-2 with a 1.78 GAA and a .934 save percentage this year for Providence in the AHL in 2021. Swayman, a rookie out of Maine, is undefeated as a professional at 7-0 with a 1.50 GAA and a .942 save percentage.\n\nSteen, who just turned 23, has three goals and five assists in 12 games so far this season. The native of Karlstad, Sweden is a natural center, but he’ll replace Anders Bjork on the wing to begin the game with Charlie Coyle and Nick Ritchie. Cassidy said if he looked uncomfortable, he’d consider moving Steen to center and sliding someone else to wing.\n\n“He’s played center and right wing, more center this year, but he has played right wing. He’s got a good shot,” Cassidy said. “We’ll see how it goes. If it doesn’t look like wing is working out for him we might slide him to the middle and move someone else to the right side.”\n\nRask skated by himself Tuesday and hasn’t been ruled out for Thursday’s game at Buffalo. Kevan Miller, is skating in Boston and could also rejoin the team before the end of the road trip.\n\nRelated content:\n\nBoston Bruins woes continue, fall to Pittsburgh Penguins, 4-1\n\nJake DeBrusk returns, Tuukka Rask still out for Boston Bruins game vs. Pittsburgh Penguins"
