        "text": "Canadian-Swedish ice hockey player (born 1984)\n\nFor the American Civil War general, see Alexander E. Steen.\n\nIce hockey player\n\nAlexander Lennart Steen (born 1 March 1984) is a Canadian-born Swedish former professional ice hockey player. Steen was drafted 24th overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 2002 NHL Entry Draft, and started his NHL career with Toronto. Steen was traded to the St. Louis Blues in 2008, where he played the remainder of his career. Steen won the Stanley Cup with the Blues in 2019.\n\nSteen is the son of Thomas Steen, who also played professional ice hockey and later became a conservative politician.\n\nPlaying career\n\n[edit]\n\nElitserien (2001–2005)\n\n[edit]\n\nSteen played for Frölunda HC from 1999 to 2004. He spent the 2004–05 season with Modo Hockey after a highly controversial signing.[1][2]\n\nToronto Maple Leafs (2005–2008)\n\n[edit]\n\nIn the 2002 NHL Entry Draft, Steen was selected in the first round by the Toronto Maple Leafs, 24th overall. He played his first game with the Leafs on 5 October 2005 during the season opener against the rival Ottawa Senators, and registered a minor penalty. His first career NHL goal came in the next game on 8 October against the Montreal Canadiens. This goal marked the first time a Swedish father (former Winnipeg Jets player Thomas Steen) and son both scored in the NHL (beating Robert Nilsson, son of Kent Nilsson, by 21 days). Steen scored his first career hat-trick on 4 January 2007 against the Boston Bruins, ending with a five-point game night.[3]\n\nSt. Louis Blues (2008–2020)\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 24 November 2008, Steen was traded by the Leafs, along with Carlo Colaiacovo, to the St. Louis Blues for Lee Stempniak.[4][5]\n\nOn 1 July 2010, Steen signed a four-year contract extension with the Blues.[6] He had an NHL career-high 51 points in the 2011–12 season.\n\nOn 25 September 2012, Steen returned to Modo Hockey on a short-term contract during the 2012–13 NHL lockout.\n\nHe was named the NHL First Star of the Month for October 2013, with his 11 goals leading the league, and 16 points, fourth-best.[7] With a goal and an assist against the Carolina Hurricanes on November 16, Steen extended his point streak to 13 consecutive games, the best such streak by a Blues player since Pierre Turgeon in 1999–2000.[8]\n\nSteen signed a three-year, $17.4 million contract with the Blues on 18 December 2013.[9]\n\nOn 4 April 2014, he was nominated by the St. Louis chapter of the Professional Hockey Writers' Association for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy. The trophy is awarded annually to the player \"who best exemplifies the qualities of perseverance, sportsmanship and dedication to hockey.\" Steen lead the Blues with 33 goals, and lead them in the points department as well with 62 points despite losing 11 games from a concussion in December 2013.[10]\n\nOn 23 September 2016, he signed a four-year, $23 million contract extension with the Blues.[11]\n\nSteen won the 2019 Stanley Cup Finals with the Blues, St. Louis' first Stanley Cup in their 52-year franchise history.\n\nRetirement\n\n[edit]\n\nOn 17 December 2020, Steen announced his retirement from hockey due to a back injury.[12] Steen finished his career fourth in games played, sixth in assists, and fifth in points in Blues franchise history. Additionally, he and his father are one of just four father-son duos to each obtain 600 points in the NHL.[13]\n\nPost-playing career\n\n[edit]\n\nSteen spent the 2023-24 season working in the St. Louis Blues hockey operations department as a European development consultant. On June 13, 2024, it was announced that Steen would be promoted to special assistant to the general manager, with plans to become the general manager after the 2025-26 season.[14]\n\nPersonal life\n\n[edit]\n\nAlexander Steen's father is former Winnipeg Jets star Thomas Steen, a forward who scored 817 points in 950 NHL games between 1981 and 1995. As Steen was born in Winnipeg during his father's tenure with the Jets, he has dual Canadian and Swedish citizenship; he has chosen to represent Sweden in international hockey competition.[15] Alexander has two surviving siblings — his youngest brother Amadeus died at the age of two months of a heart condition. His death was the motivation for Alex, along with family members, to create the Amadeus Steen Foundation to raise funds for, and offer support for, infant and child health care.[16]\n\nCareer statistics\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season and playoffs\n\n[edit]\n\nRegular season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM GP G A Pts PIM 1999–2000 Västra Frölunda HC SWE J18 12 3 5 8 14 2 0 0 0 2 2000–01 Västra Frölunda HC SWE J18 4 3 3 6 9 1 0 0 0 0 2000–01 Västra Frölunda HC J20 15 5 7 12 6 5 4 2 6 2 2001–02 Västra Frölunda HC J20 25 22 18 40 49 2 1 1 2 2 2001–02 Västra Frölunda HC SEL 26 0 3 3 14 10 1 2 3 0 2002–03 Västra Frölunda HC J20 2 0 2 2 0 — — — — — 2002–03 Västra Frölunda HC SEL 45 5 10 15 18 16 2 3 5 4 2003–04 Västra Frölunda HC SEL 48 10 14 24 50 10 4 6 10 14 2004–05 Modo Hockey SEL 50 9 8 17 26 6 1 0 1 4 2005–06 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 75 18 27 45 42 — — — — — 2006–07 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 82 15 20 35 26 — — — — — 2007–08 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 76 15 27 42 32 — — — — — 2008–09 Toronto Maple Leafs NHL 20 2 2 4 6 — — — — — 2008–09 St. Louis Blues NHL 61 6 18 24 24 4 0 1 1 0 2009–10 St. Louis Blues NHL 68 24 23 47 30 — — — — — 2010–11 St. Louis Blues NHL 72 20 31 51 26 — — — — — 2011–12 St. Louis Blues NHL 43 15 13 28 28 9 1 2 3 6 2012–13 Modo Hockey SEL 20 8 15 23 28 — — — — — 2012–13 St. Louis Blues NHL 40 8 19 27 14 6 3 0 3 6 2013–14 St. Louis Blues NHL 68 33 29 62 46 6 1 2 3 6 2014–15 St. Louis Blues NHL 74 24 40 64 33 6 1 3 4 2 2015–16 St. Louis Blues NHL 67 17 35 52 48 20 4 6 10 30 2016–17 St. Louis Blues NHL 76 16 35 51 53 10 3 4 7 4 2017–18 St. Louis Blues NHL 76 15 31 46 0 — — — — — 2018–19 St. Louis Blues NHL 65 10 17 27 14 26 2 3 5 2 2019–20 St. Louis Blues NHL 55 7 10 17 12 4 0 0 0 6 NHL totals 1,018 245 377 622 454 91 15 21 36 62\n\nInternational\n\n[edit]\n\nMedal record Men's ice hockey Representing Sweden Winter Olympics 2014 Sochi\n\nYear Team Event GP G A Pts PIM 2002 Sweden WJC18 8 2 6 8 8 2003 Sweden WJC 6 4 2 6 6 2004 Sweden WJC 6 2 1 3 4 2007 Sweden WC 9 2 2 4 6 2014 Sweden OG 6 1 3 4 4 Junior totals 20 8 9 17 18 Senior totals 15 3 5 8 10\n\nAwards and honours\n\n[edit]\n\nAward Year NHL Stanley Cup champion 2019 [17]\n\nSee also\n\n[edit]\n\nList of family relations in the NHL\n\nReferences\n\n[edit]\n\nBiographical information and career statistics from NHL.com, or Eliteprospects.com, or Eurohockey.com, or Hockey-Reference.com, or The Internet Hockey Database"
