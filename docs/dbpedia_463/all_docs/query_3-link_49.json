        "text": "Oskar Steen won't forget his second-period goal against the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday night for several reasons.\n\nFor starters, the score was Steen's first in the NHL since the Swedish winger debuted with the Boston Bruins last March. It was also one of the stranger goals you'll see this season.\n\nShould Bruins pursue d-man Jakob Chychrun before trade deadline?\n\nHere's what happened: The puck landed on top of the net after Nick Foligno's backhand attempt was deflected. Steen jabbed his stick into the net from underneath to pop the puck in the air -- and it dribbled off Devils goaltender Mackenzie Blackwood into the goal.\n\nSteen didn't even directly hit the puck, but his quick thinking led to his first NHL goal at TD Garden and a salute from head coach Bruce Cassidy.\n\n\"Clever, right?\" Cassidy said of Steen's goal after Boston's 5-3 win, as seen in the video above. \"The puck’s on the net, some guys might have tried to bat it off, like push it off instead of poking it up in the air.\n\n\"I'm not sure he was planning on poking it up in the air for it to go off the goalie’s back. He was probably poking it up in the air and hoping it landed on his stick on the ice and he could whack it in. So, it was a clever play. A little composure. Happy for him.\"\n\nBoston Bruins\n\nTuesday was only Steen's eighth NHL game, as the 23-year-old has spent most of his time in the minors since the Bruins drafted him 165th overall in 2016. But Steen is making a case to see more ice time: He tallied an assist in Sunday's win over the Detroit Red Wings and now has four points in five games played this season.\n\nThe Bruins need all the secondary scoring help they can get, so if Steen keeps producing, he deserves a spot on the third or fourth line.\n\n\"Especially for a guy who's not that big, he plays a courageous game,\" Cassidy added. \"So, I think people are rooting for him.\""
