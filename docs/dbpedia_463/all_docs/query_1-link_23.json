        "text": "With the regular season opener just a week away, those tough decisions that the Bruins have been talking about all training camp have arrived.\n\nThe Bruins placed 24-year-old Oskar Steen on waivers on Tuesday in the hopes of getting him through to Providence. The B’s had relatively high hopes for Steen, signing him to a two-year, one-way contract with an annual average value of $800,000 last April.\n\nSteen had come up from Providence last year and showed some flashes of being a rugged, nasty right wing who could get under opponents’ skin. He couldn’t stick at the NHL level, but there was a feeling that there was definitely something there.\n\nBut Steen did not have the greatest camp. He did score a shorthanded goal against the Rangers but he did not have the same physical presence he did when he first came up to Boston last year. In Monday’s 1-0 snoozefest of a loss in New Jersey, he had zero hits and zero shots in 13:48 of ice time.\n\nSteen’s underwhelming play was contrasted with Marc McLaughlin’s solid camp and, as of right now, the former Boston College captain has made a very good case for himself as the fourth line right wing.\n\nIn comparing the two players side by side, the only advantage that Steen had over McLaughlin was the fact that he requires waivers to be sent to Providence while the club would not have had to deal with that ramification if they decided to send McLaughlin down. But the gap in play between the two apparently was too big ignore.\n\nThis doesn’t necessarily mean McLaughlin has made the team. There is still some culling to be done from the fourth-line candidates that include Jack Studnicka, Nick Foligno, A.J. Greer, Tomas Nosek and Joona Koppanen. Teams have to get down to the 23-man roster limit by Monday.\n\nWhether Steen gets claimed will be interesting. The second year of the deal could make teams reticent to claim him. Then again, a team like Chicago, which won’t be competing for several years and will have a lot of money to spend next year, or even Buffalo, with $20 million of cap space, may think Steen is worth a flyer. Well find out at 2 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\nOdds & Ends\n\nThe B’s also placed defensemen Connor Carrick and Nick Wolff on waivers. Victor Berglund, Mike Callahan and Kai Wissmann have been assigned to Providence…\n\nSad to hear of Bob Tindall’s passing. Tindall, 86, was the B’s director of Scouting and chief scout from 1973- 2001 and was a font of information for young reporters in the days before every nugget about a prospect was just a click away. He was also the kindliest of gentlemen and a great hockey raconteur. Trips to Toronto will not be the same without seeing Bob standing outside the Bruins’ dressing room before the morning skate."
