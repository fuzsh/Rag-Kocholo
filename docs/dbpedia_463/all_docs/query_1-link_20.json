        "text": "The Bruins placed Oskar Steen on waivers Sunday after he took reps in practice with the fourth line. If he clears waivers, Steen will return to Providence.\n\nSteen was recalled in October after Boston placed Milan Lucic on long-term injured reserve. With Lucic taking an indefinite leave of absence from the team and other injuries throughout the roster, Steen found himself remaining with the NHL club.\n\nThe bottom-six forward wasn’t an every day player, and was a healthy scratch at times — including for Saturday’s overtime loss to the Los Angeles Kings on Saturday at TD Garden.\n\nIn 34 games played this season, Steen amassed just one point — a goal on Nov. 14 against the Buffalo Sabres.\n\nIt’s unclear if the Bruins will make another roster move prior to Monday’s matinee against the Dallas Stars and recall another forward. The news comes after Jakub Lauko missed Sunday’s practice with an upper-body injury that has his status unknown for Monday.\n\nThe Bruins offense has struggled since the All-Star break, having only won one game of their last six. While they’ve been able to manage a point in two of the losses, the power play has struggled mightily and the offense — despite getting shots on net — are a bit snakebitten.\n\n“If we keep playing to our identity and the process gets a little better, the results are going to come,” coach Jim Montgomery told reporters Sunday. “... I don’t think I’m as worried as maybe the outside people are, because I see a good brand of hockey.”\n\nIt will be interesting to see if another team takes a chance on Steen, or if he’ll clear waivers and return to the AHL."
