        "text": "In action for 34 games this season, the 25-year-old Steen had recorded one goal, 19 blocked shots, and 79 hits while averaging 9:04 per game for the Black and Gold this season. Steen has been a consistent part of Boston’s revolving door of fourth-line wingers post-Lucic, rotating with Jakub Lauko, Jesper Boqvist, and Johnny Beecher among others, from Patrick Brown to Georgii Merkulov.\n\nConor Ryan on Twitter: \"What a shot from Oskar Steen. 4-0 Bruins. pic.twitter.com/ZLHq7xOmkT / Twitter\"\n\nWhat a shot from Oskar Steen. 4-0 Bruins. pic.twitter.com/ZLHq7xOmkT\n\nSteen’s first and only NHL goal of the 2023-24 campaign came back in Boston’s Nov. 14 win over the Sabres.\n\nSteen’s offensive struggles weren’t all that surprising given his limited usage and the typical fourth-line deployment from the Bruins (an awful lot of defensive-zone work), but it was statistically speaking, the worst in the NHL.\n\nOne of 580 NHL players to play at least 30 games this season, Steen’s single point ranked dead last among that group of 580. Steen is also one of just two forwards (and just four players in total) in the NHL this season to play at least 300 five-on-five minutes and not record multiple points.\n\nSteen was also coming off back-to-back outings where he was given less than eight minutes of time on ice for the first time in almost a month, and his Feb. 13 outing against the Kraken was also a true ‘nothing’ kind of performance, with zero hits, zero blocks, and just one shot in 7:51 of play.\n\nSteen, who has been in Boston’s pro ranks since the 2019-20 season, has made 60 total NHL appearances for the Bruins over the last four seasons, with four goals and eight points over that span.\n\nIn the final year of a deal that comes with an $800,000 cap hit, Steen would need to appear in another 20 NHL games between now and the end of the regular season for Steen to remain an arbitration-eligible restricted free agent. If that does not happen, the 5-foot-10 Steen will be a Group 6 unrestricted free agent this summer.\n\nWith Steen on waivers, the Bruins currently have 12 healthy forwards on their NHL roster, but they could use a reinforcement by the morning, with Lauko’s status currently up in the air due an upper-body injury that kept him out of Sunday’s practice."
