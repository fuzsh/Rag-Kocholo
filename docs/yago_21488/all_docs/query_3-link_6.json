        "text": "Warren Beatty earned his first producer credit for Bonnie and Clyde, but you’d be forgiven for thinking that as an actor he acts like a producer. Fussy about minor matters, never quite in the same room as the rest of the cast, Beatty is one of the last products of the studio system. His stud reputation mystifies me: when I look at him even in earl work like Splendor in the Grass I see cute crow’s feet and solid hair, no more, which explains my hesitation about canonizing Shampoo. For that 1975 comedy to work you have to believe in Beatty as unstoppably fuckable; if you don’t, then Shampoo moves as if on Mandrax. A game supporting cast helps (Carrie Fisher, Goldie Hawn, and Jack Warden do some of their nimblest work). But when Beatty’s tics and the character mesh a miracle happens, or, rather, two miracles: his third-rate grifter in Robert Alman’s gorgeous haze of a western McCabe & Mrs. Miller and his tuff-talking but limp Clyde.\n\nAt the dawn of the Reagan eighties he directed, produced, co-wrote (theoretically), and starred in Reds, a frustrating film because its creator, a product of the old studio system,is more taken with Dr. Zhivago more than Das Kapital. I do too, much as I dislike binaries, though a movie like Reds leaves me no choice. He could’ve left everything fascinating about Louise Bryant’s frustrations and rage and still omitted the scene where she journeys across the frozen Russian steppes to save Beatty’s Jack Reed from the clutches of Jerzy Kosiński’s Zinoviev; but what happens onscreen is too many psychological zigs and zags for Diane Keaton to pull together into a coherent characterization. Maybe her concentration broke thinking about two scenes where a dog scratches on the door while Jack and Louise fuck in the bedroom. Still, Reds earned back its budget and remains an impressive achievement. Jack Warner would have collapsed at the thought of a studio movie that included aged Commie talking heads and that made Emma Goldman a hero and the only person with common sense (she indicts Soviet Communism in one of her last scenes as if she were a suspect at a show trial).\n\nHis energy indefatigable, Beatty survived the not bad Ishtar (doing a not bad job, certainly better than in The Fortune opposite pal Jack Nicholson) to star in and helm Dick Tracy, whose PR campaign rivaled the previous summer’s Batman and is better than you may remember; it looks like a WWII-era comic book, Beatty is appropriately lockjawed, and the villains are fun. He’s damn sharp in Bugsy, his best work in twenty years, despite its length. Then Annette Bening captured his heart and, for reasons unknown, his brain turned to baby laxative. I can’t explain Love Affair and Town and Country. The old producer’s way with a gimmick sold Bulworth to investors who had no clue what a horror it was — but cool soundtrack, bro. Rules Don’t Apply was charming if you let it play in the background, though like many of his films it doesn’t know when to stop.\n\nMy keepers:"
